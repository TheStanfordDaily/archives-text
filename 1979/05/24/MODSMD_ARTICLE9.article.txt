# Panic buying creating current gas crunch
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The great
toilet paper shortage began
fairly simply.
(ohnny Carson made a joke
on the "Tonight" show a
couple of years ago about
supplies of toilet paper being
tight. There really was no shor
tage — until Carson's joke.
In a matter of days, toilet
paper became a rare commod
ity. Americans, believing Car
son was serious, bought every
roll of toilet paper they could
get hold of. Soon, lots of
people had several weeks'

supply of toilet paper — but
stores had virtually none.
That phenomenon is known
as panic buying. And many ex
perts say it's a chief cause of
the current gasoline crunch.
There is little question that
there actually is a shortage of
gasoline — demand forthe fuel
has been going up at a four
percent annual pace, while oil
companies, compensating for
a shortage of crude oil, have
cut back shipments to dealers
by about 10 percent.
But analysts say that shortage

should have been easy to man
age. The lines which have ap
peared in California and
elsewhere, they say, have been
due not so much to the shor
tage itself as to motorists' per
ception that the shortage is
worse than it actually is.
That perception — built from
news reports, rumor and per
sonal experience with gas lines
— has worsened the situation,
analysts say.
"If you wake up in the morn
ing, turn on the TV and see a
news story about long gas

lines, you're going to think,
'Wow, I better go out and buy
some gas,' said one oil industry
executive.
"As I drive around and I see
people in lines at gasoline sta
tions I think I can't afford to let
my car get down to a low
level," said Michael Canes, an
analyst at the American Pet
roleum Institute, a
Washington-based industry
group. "It inclines me to think I
must fill up earlier to avoid
that."
If enough people have the
same thought, they can cause
serious problems for the na
tion's gasoline supply.
Analysts say that what hap
pens in a panic-buying situa
tion is that motorists start pul
ling up to gas pumps as soon as
the gas gauge reaches the
three-quarters mark, instead of
waiting until they're down to
one-quarter of a tank, as is
normal.
The origins of this are varied.
Many analysts say panic buying
is tripped by the first signs of
tight gasoline supplies — news
that companies are cutting
shipments to dealers or that
gas stations are closing Sun
days, cutting hours or limiting
sales to a few gallons.
By saying "top it off" instead

of "fill 'er up," motorists are
setting off a whole chain of
events that analysts say can
lead to trouble.
To begin with, the difference
between running around with
a quarter tank of gas and
three-quarters of a tank is
about 10 gallons. If all of
America's 134 million cars and
trucks made that change, 1.34
billion gallons of gasoline
would shift from the distribu
tion system to gas tanks. That's
a 42-day supply, an amount cal
led "absolutely staggering" by
Larry Goldstein of the Pet
roleum Industry Research
Foundation, an industry
group.
While that probably would
never happen, a recent Ameri
can Automobile Association
check of 40 cars coming into a
Washington, D.C., gas station
found only two actually low on
gas. The rest were topping off.
And topping off creates
problems. It takes just about as
long to buy two gallons of gas
as it does to buy 10. Although
the pumping time is a bit
longer for 10 gallons, the time
to pull up, give your order,
have the pump nozzle put into
your tank, put the nozzle back,
replace the gas cap and pay is
just about the same no matter
how much gas is bought.
So five motorists buying two
gallons each take about five
times as much time as one
motorist purchasing 10 gal
lons.
That time translates into
lines. And those lines, and
news reports of them, cause
more people to think about
topping off. Hoarding starts,
forcing gas stations to close
earlier. And motorists, seeing
stations closing, rush to buy
gas before stations close, caus
ing them to shut down even
earlier.
