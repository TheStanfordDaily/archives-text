A Stanford woman, on a recent vacation to Los
Angeles, came upon an S.C Dolly sobbing pro
tusely in the middle of the road "What's the
matter?" asked the Stanlord woman
"The most terrible thing has happened, said
the Dolly between sobs "I put on my socks this
morning and they dont match. One is red with
green stripes and the other is white with blue
stripes.
How silly, replied the Stanford woman,
somewhat put out "There are people sittng in
line four hours waiting to buy gas. nuclear reac
tors are sitting around waiting to blow up and kill
millions ol people and you re crying because
your socks don't match. Just be glad you re not
worse off
"But I am, interrupted the Dolly. "I've gdt
another pair just like these at home "
