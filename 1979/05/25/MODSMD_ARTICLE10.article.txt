# Newest Chappie half- way 'funny'
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
"Funnyness" is the name
of the new Chaparral issue,
but don't expect to find out
why until you're half-way
through reading it.
This latest issue is a curi
ous mix. Throughout, the
writing is quite good. Un
fortunately, though in
teresting, some of the best
written stories are the most
devoid of humor.
The first article, "Co-ed
Corner," is a real "so
what?" It's a peachy-keen
little piece that could be cal
led "Alice's Boring Adven
tures in Hawaii." It's even
got the obligatory sex and
drugs thrown in for good
measure. Whoopie.
Whether or not the story
has any truth to it is irrelev
ant. Bythe time you finish it,
you don't really care. What
humor there is seems very
contrived. Mercifully, how
ever, most of the story
doesn't even attempt to
elicit a chuckle.
The second piece, "lust
Looking for a Good Game,"
is typical of the first half of
the issue. The writing is very
good, but if you're looking
for a laugh, skip it.
The third composition,
"A Hell of a Guy," leads one
to think there may yet be
hope for the issue. Though
no funnier than its two pre
decessors in the magazine,
you at least feel like you

want to finish the entire ar
ticle. The ending, however,
elicits neither mirth norawe
at the "somber" message
contained therein.
Eventually, though, you
get to sections that make
the issue worth buying.
An illustrated poem,
"Straw Man," shows a sense
of the absurd mixed in with
some creative prose.
"24 Hours at Stickney,"
an outstanding piece of
writing by Mike Wilkins and
Chris Morales, is worth the
price of the magazine just
by itself. This true-to-life
story makes you really ap
preciate one of the true
culinary farces in the Palo
Alto area. If you liked
Stickney's before reading
this piece, then Wilkins and
Morales will give you the
full story behind one of
those institutions they forgot
to warn you about during
Freshman Orientation.
The final two written
pieces, "Why We Speak En
glish" and "Charlie the
Pacer," display the kind of
humor one expects from
the Chaparral. "Why We
Speak English" is enjoyable
reading from start to finish,
lending a good dose of sar
casm to the issue.
"Charlie" is a wonderfully
cynical piece by Chappie
editor Bruce Handy that will
elicit a wry smile and a good
chuckle from most readers.

The artwork, as usual, is
very good. A couple of
panels in the issue border
on "ho hum," but by and
large, the strips are quite
good. "Lovin' Bloom," an
off-the-wall piece with an
interesting twist, is well
drawn and amusing, but
let's face it: Woody Allen
did the concept much bet

ter in his "What is Sodomy"
section of Everything You
Wanted to Know About Sex.
So when you pass the
Chappie hawkers pushing
their "wares" in White
Plaza, go ahead and invest
the coins. A little patience
early in the game will be re
warded.
