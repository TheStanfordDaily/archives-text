Dear Bug Me:
Why are so many foods registered with the
Pennsylvania Dept. of Agriculture?
-S.D.
According to Bob Marburger, public informa
tion officer for the United States Dept. of Ag
riculture in San Francisco, a Pennsylvania law
requires that recipes for commercially sold
baked goods be registered with that state.
"However, the registration is no guarantee of
quality," he said.
Marburger added that the requirement began
as an antitrust move at the turn of the century.
Recipe registration was seen as one way to keep
large bakers from monopolizing the market
through possession of trade secrets.
Although the law only applies in Pennsyl
vania, manufacturers find it cheaper to print the
statement on all packaging, Marburger said.

Dear Bug Me:
Why did they put up a fence around the south
end of Lake Lagunita?
-B.C.
The $11,000 fence was erected in late April to
prevent people from parking their cars in the
bike lanes along Junipero Serra Blvd. and
swimming along unguarded sections of the
south end of the lake, said Roger Buckhout,
project manager in the facilities office.
Buckhout said the provost's office and the
University's insurance company had been wor
ried about liability problems should an accident
occur there, since the lake is technically termed
an "attractive nuisance."
Noting that joggers complain about the fence,
Buckhout said, "We're not trying to keep any
one from running." Officials are assuming that
swimmers will now park near the Boathouse and
swim off the beach.
He said a five-foot-wide path is planned inside
the fenced area for joggers, poison oak cleared
from along the path and additional shrubbery
planted that will screen some of the fence in a
few years.

Dear Bug Me:
I read the other day that student swimming
pools, hot tubs, spas, jacuzzis and other similar
equipment may have to be solar powered in the
future. Are there any plans to regulate the fossil

fueled hot tubs belonging to faculty and staff?
-J.Q.A.
"I haven't heard of any plans," said both Bob
Summers, manager of faculty-staff housing and
Karl Johnson, the campus energy conservation
specialist who helped formulate the first regula
tion.
"We may discuss this with the homeowners at
their monthly meeting," Summers added.
He said there are about 80 swimming pools
and 10 to 20 hot tubs in faculty and staff homes.
Summers noted that P.G. & E.'s new rate
structure, effective May through October, will
discourage heavy natural gas consumption by
pool owners. The new procedure requires cus
tomers to be charged a much higher rate for the
gas they burn after their regular monthly allot
ment is used.

Dea/ Bug Me:
Some friends sympathetic to the United Farm
Workers' strike say I shouldn't eat iceberg let
tuce or Chiquita bananas. I eat in the Food Ser
vice so how can I tell where my fruit and salads
are coming from?
-W.fi.
If you eat on campus you're indirectly partici
pating in the boycott. The boycotted brands are
Sun Harvest, Growers Exchange, Admiral Pack
ing, Bruce Church Inc. and J.J. Corsetti Inc., all
of Salinas, Ca. I talked with the University's
suppliers — Royal Foods of San Jose and Royal
Distributors of Redwood City — and they said
they weren't buying from these companies.
They also said they won't deliver Chiquita
bananas to the campus as long as other brands
are available.
Ed Angstadt, trade association spokesman for
the Growership of Vegetables in Salinas, said
plenty of non-boycotted brand lettuce is availa
ble at dirt cheap prices. He said the boycotted
lettuce fields are being picked by "replacement
workers" (called "scab labor" by the UFW) who
come in from other agricultural valleys.
Only about 30 percent of the lettuce pickers
use the UFW as their bargaining agent, and
many union members have continued picking
even without a contract with the growers.
