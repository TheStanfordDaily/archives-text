# Mendicants join other singers for Monday performance
## The 						old Whiffenpoofs 
### Krisan Froelich 
Yale's 1979 Whiffenpoofs left
yesterday for a trip around the
world and their first stop is
California. While on tour, the
Whiffenpoofs, Yale's counter
part to the Stanford Mendic
ants, will stop here for a con
cert Monday which will include
special appearances by the
Mendicants and Counterpoint.
"It will be sort of a mini
jamboree," said Bob Larson,
financial manager for the
Mendicants. "Hank Adams,
the founder of the Mendicants
and a Yale drop-out, will
emcee the show."
Organized in 1909, this year
marks the "Whiffs'" 70th an
niversary and their first world
tour.
"We wanted to do some
thing no other Whiffs had done
before," said Berne Burk, a
member of the group who is
handling the "California end"
of the tour.
After giving concerts in San
Francisco, Monterey and the
Los Angeles area, the group
will leave for Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Bangkok. Their tour
in Turkey and India will de
pend on the political situations
there, while their Australia per
formance will depend on the
availability of concerts. The
Whiffs will then spend six
weeks touring Europe.
Totally student-run and sup
ported, the Whiffs estimate the
cost of the trip to be $35,000.

"We borrowed part of the
money to pay our up-front ex
penses," Burk said. "But we
expect to be able to pay that off
through our concerts and re
cord sales."
To finance the rest, the
Whiffs have been "singing in
credibly hard since August,"
Burk said. To date they have
performed over 200 concerts
and during fall term were av
eraging six a week.
Some of their concerts this
year included singing at a New
York cabaret, spending a week
in Colorado, taking a trip to
Hawaii and a cruise to Ber
muda.
"Every year the Whiffs go to
Bermuda over spring break
and stay at the Castle Harbor to
sing," Burk explained. "This
year the group couldn't go be
cause Castle Harbor was re
modeling. So we went to
Hawaii instead." They also
booked themselves with a
cruise agency to provide enter
tainment on a ship as it sailed
to and from Bermuda.
The Whiffs' 15' members are
all seniors.
"We select members of the
junior class in April," Burk
said, "and most of our mem
bers have been members of
other singing groups." In addi
tion to sponsoring a formal au
dition, the established Whiffs
go to one of their prospective
member's concerts to see him
in a performance setting.
"Basically we look for people

who sing well and get along
with others," Burk said. "My
year we had 50 men put their
names up, but this year we only
had 30."
The Whiffenpoofs sing
swing, traditional college
tunes and "a lot of Cole Porter
songs, since he was a Whiffen
poof in 1913," Burk said. "It
wasn't until 1951 that jazz was
added."
Their theme song, approp
riately titled "The Whiffenpoof
Song," was made famous by
Rudy Vallee on his radio show
during the 19305.
"We always close our con
certs with that," Burk said.
"Traditionally, Whiff alums
come up and join us when we
sing it. You get a lot of men
from 1918 doddering up."
The Whiffenpoofs origi
nated in 1909 with only four
members from the Glee Club.
"They started singing and
meeting on Monday nights in a
bar called Mory's," Burk said.
"Since then we have sung at
Mory's every Monday night
during school."
The group got its name from
a 1909 Broadway show called
"Little Nemo." During the
show one of the cast members
sang a song about catching a
"whiffenpoof" fish, and the
Yale singers got their logo sev
eral years later—a dragon with
fig leaves for wings sitting
perched on a staff, an artist's
conception of a "whiffen
poof."

Francisco, Monterey and the
Los Angeles area, the group
will leave for Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Bangkok. Their tour
in Turkey and India will de
pend on the political situations
there, while their Australia per
formance will depend on the
availability of concerts. The
Whiffs will then spend six
weeks touring Europe.
Totally student-run and sup
ported, the Whiffs estimate the
cost of the trip to be $35,000.

"We borrowed part of the
money to pay our up-front ex
penses," Burk said. "But we
expect to be able to pay that off
through our concerts and re
cord sales."
To finance the rest, the
Whiffs have been "singing in
credibly hard since August,"
Burk said. To date they have
performed over 200 concerts
and during fall term were av
eraging six a week.
Some of their concerts this
year included singing at a New
York cabaret, spending a week
in Colorado, taking a trip to
Hawaii and a cruise to Ber
muda.
"Every year the Whiffs go to
Bermuda over spring break
and stay at the Castle Harbor to
sing," Burk explained. "This
year the group couldn't go be
cause Castle Harbor was re
modeling. So we went to
Hawaii instead." They also
booked themselves with a
cruise agency to provide enter
tainment on a ship as it sailed
to and from Bermuda.
The Whiffs' 15' members are
all seniors.
"We select members of the
junior class in April," Burk
said, "and most of our mem
bers have been members of
other singing groups." In addi
tion to sponsoring a formal au
dition, the established Whiffs
go to one of their prospective
member's concerts to see him
in a performance setting.
"Basically we look for people

who sing well and get along
with others," Burk said. "My
year we had 50 men put their
names up, but this year we only
had 30."
The Whiffenpoofs sing
swing, traditional college
tunes and "a lot of Cole Porter
songs, since he was a Whiffen
poof in 1913," Burk said. "It
wasn't until 1951 that jazz was
added."
Their theme song, approp
riately titled "The Whiffenpoof
Song," was made famous by
Rudy Vallee on his radio show
during the 19305.
"We always close our con
certs with that," Burk said.
"Traditionally, Whiff alums
come up and join us when we
sing it. You get a lot of men
from 1918 doddering up."
The Whiffenpoofs origi
nated in 1909 with only four
members from the Glee Club.
"They started singing and
meeting on Monday nights in a
bar called Mory's," Burk said.
"Since then we have sung at
Mory's every Monday night
during school."
The group got its name from
a 1909 Broadway show called
"Little Nemo." During the
show one of the cast members
sang a song about catching a
"whiffenpoof" fish, and the
Yale singers got their logo sev
eral years later—a dragon with
fig leaves for wings sitting
perched on a staff, an artist's
conception of a "whiffen
poof."

Yale's 1979 Whiffenpoofs left
yesterday for a trip around the
world and their first stop is
California. While on tour, the
Whiffenpoofs, Yale's counter
part to the Stanford Mendic
ants, will stop here for a con
cert Monday which will include
special appearances by the
Mendicants and Counterpoint.
"It will be sort of a mini
jamboree," said Bob Larson,
financial manager for the
Mendicants. "Hank Adams,
the founder of the Mendicants
and a Yale drop-out, will
emcee the show."
Organized in 1909, this year
marks the "Whiffs'" 70th an
niversary and their first world
tour.
"We wanted to do some
thing no other Whiffs had done
before," said Berne Burk, a
member of the group who is
handling the "California end"
of the tour.
After giving concerts in San
Francisco, Monterey and the
Los Angeles area, the group
will leave for Tokyo, Hong
Kong and Bangkok. Their tour
in Turkey and India will de
pend on the political situations
there, while their Australia per
formance will depend on the
