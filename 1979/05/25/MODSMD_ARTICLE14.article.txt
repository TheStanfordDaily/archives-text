# Odd animal behavior may be sign of quakes
## 
### Debbie Walker 
Earthquakes have terrified
mankind throughout recorded
history. They strike without
warning and topple the finest
products of the human mind
within seconds, but human
minds are not staying idle
while waiting for the next
quake.
Scientists are now investigat
ing numerous methods of pre
dicting these temblors, and
one of their most intriguing
theories is that unusual animal
behavior precedes ear
thquakes.
"This idea has been held in
disrepute fora long time," said
Dr. Leon Otis, Director of the
Psychobiology and Physiology
Lab at SRI International. "It has
always been associated with
the claims of humans who
claim to be seers or possess
special powers."
But because of recent suc
cesses with this method of
prediction in China, scientists
are beginning to take the idea
seriously.
Otis and Dr. William Kautz
are currently heading a study
funded by the United States
Geological Survey which will
ultimately determine whether

or not this theory is indeed un
shakeable.
Their Project Earthquake
Watch consists of over 750 vol
unteers living in the seismic
regions of California who have
agreed to immediately report
any unusual behavior in the
animals they are observing.
About 75 species from in
sects to house pets to zoo ani
mals are now under observa
tion.
Otis said two to three reports
of abnormal actions come in
daily, and this number occa
sionally rises to six.
However, there was not an
increase in calls prior to the
two tremors which recently
shook the Bay Area. Otis attri
buted this to the mildness of
the quakes and said that ani-»
mals have sensed much larger
ones in the past.
"Though this method is not
always consistent and they've
missed some big ones, the
Chinese have successfully
predicted 11 earthquakes on
the basis of animal behavior,"
Otis said. The People's Repub
lic of China uses many other
methods to predict ear
thquakes and is considered to

have the most advanced
methods of earthquake predic
tion.
In the winter of 1975, hiber
nating snakes slithered from
their holes and froze to death a
few days before a large quake
hit that area of the Haicheng
province. Reports of this ab
normal behavior quickly
reached the government and
the region was evacuated im
mediately so that when the
quake struck, its toll was smal
ler than it might have been.
What mysterious ability do
these snakes and other animals
have that allows them to an
ticipate an earthquake?
"Animals have sensitivities
1000 times greater than
man's," said Otis. "It is possi
ble they sense electrical or
magnetic changes in the at
mosphere, smell gasses being
released or feel minute vibrat
ory tremors. We really don't
know what it is."
But there is no point in inves
tigating the source of these
reactions until the relationship
between abnormal behavior
and earthquakes is ascer
tained, he said.
"But it's not as if we're just
waiting around for a major
quake," he said. "I'm not a
morbid character awaiting a
disaster, but we're going to
have to look at lots of reports
after the fact and conduct in
vestigations of all other pos
sibilities that could have
caused the abnormal be
havior."
Even if this theory should
prove true, it will probably
never be used as an indepen
dent means of predicting ear
thquakes because of its appa
rent inconsistency.
"The government is cur
rently looking for other pre
cursors to earthquakes, and if a
number of instruments are in
dicating the possibility of an
earthquake, this is when the
reports of abnormal animal
behavior might make a differ
ence," Otis said.
Though the results of Project
Earthquake Watch will not be
useful for several years, Otis
said some citizens are benefit

ing right now. The program has
heightened the awareness of
the volunteers who are spread
ing this knowledge through
the community as they talk to
friends.
"It's amazing how unpre
pared most people are for an
earthquake," said Otis. "Even
though we live in a hazard area,
people are not that tuned to it.
This is a big concern of the
geological survey and right
now they're working on a pub
lic education system."
Preparations for quakes are
very easy, but few people take
the time to make them, he said.
A separate supply of water
should be kept that will pro

vide each member of the
household with three gallons,
and food supplies should be
large enough to last for three
days. Homeowners should
know where the gas and elec
trical mains are so they can turn
them off immediately.
When the quake strikes, the
best place to be is under some
thing sturdy and heavy or
under a doorframe.
Beyond this, there is not
much you can do, unless, by
chance, you want to observe
your pet closely. If sedentary
old Rover suddenly becomes
as frisky as a puppy, you might
want to consider taking a quick
vacation.

"This idea has been held in
disrepute fora long time," said
Dr. Leon Otis, Director of the
Psychobiology and Physiology
Lab at SRI International. "It has
always been associated with
the claims of humans who
claim to be seers or possess
special powers."
But because of recent suc
cesses with this method of
prediction in China, scientists
are beginning to take the idea
seriously.
Otis and Dr. William Kautz
are currently heading a study
funded by the United States
Geological Survey which will
ultimately determine whether

or not this theory is indeed un
shakeable.
Their Project Earthquake
Watch consists of over 750 vol
unteers living in the seismic
regions of California who have
agreed to immediately report
any unusual behavior in the
animals they are observing.
About 75 species from in
sects to house pets to zoo ani
mals are now under observa
tion.
Otis said two to three reports
of abnormal actions come in
daily, and this number occa
sionally rises to six.
However, there was not an
increase in calls prior to the
two tremors which recently
shook the Bay Area. Otis attri
buted this to the mildness of
the quakes and said that ani-»
mals have sensed much larger
ones in the past.
"Though this method is not
always consistent and they've
missed some big ones, the
Chinese have successfully
predicted 11 earthquakes on
the basis of animal behavior,"
Otis said. The People's Repub
lic of China uses many other
methods to predict ear
thquakes and is considered to

have the most advanced
methods of earthquake predic
tion.
In the winter of 1975, hiber
nating snakes slithered from
their holes and froze to death a
few days before a large quake
hit that area of the Haicheng
province. Reports of this ab
normal behavior quickly
reached the government and
the region was evacuated im
mediately so that when the
quake struck, its toll was smal
ler than it might have been.
What mysterious ability do
these snakes and other animals
have that allows them to an
ticipate an earthquake?
"Animals have sensitivities
1000 times greater than
man's," said Otis. "It is possi
ble they sense electrical or
magnetic changes in the at
mosphere, smell gasses being
released or feel minute vibrat
ory tremors. We really don't
know what it is."
But there is no point in inves
tigating the source of these
reactions until the relationship
between abnormal behavior
and earthquakes is ascer
tained, he said.
"But it's not as if we're just
waiting around for a major
quake," he said. "I'm not a
morbid character awaiting a
disaster, but we're going to
have to look at lots of reports
after the fact and conduct in
vestigations of all other pos
sibilities that could have
caused the abnormal be
havior."
Even if this theory should
prove true, it will probably
never be used as an indepen
dent means of predicting ear
thquakes because of its appa
rent inconsistency.
"The government is cur
rently looking for other pre
cursors to earthquakes, and if a
number of instruments are in
dicating the possibility of an
earthquake, this is when the
reports of abnormal animal
behavior might make a differ
ence," Otis said.
Though the results of Project
Earthquake Watch will not be
useful for several years, Otis
said some citizens are benefit

ing right now. The program has
heightened the awareness of
the volunteers who are spread
ing this knowledge through
the community as they talk to
friends.
"It's amazing how unpre
pared most people are for an
earthquake," said Otis. "Even
though we live in a hazard area,
people are not that tuned to it.
This is a big concern of the
geological survey and right
now they're working on a pub
lic education system."
Preparations for quakes are
very easy, but few people take
the time to make them, he said.
A separate supply of water
should be kept that will pro

vide each member of the
household with three gallons,
and food supplies should be
large enough to last for three
days. Homeowners should
know where the gas and elec
trical mains are so they can turn
them off immediately.
When the quake strikes, the
best place to be is under some
thing sturdy and heavy or
under a doorframe.
Beyond this, there is not
much you can do, unless, by
chance, you want to observe
your pet closely. If sedentary
old Rover suddenly becomes
as frisky as a puppy, you might
want to consider taking a quick
vacation.

Earthquakes have terrified
mankind throughout recorded
history. They strike without
warning and topple the finest
products of the human mind
within seconds, but human
minds are not staying idle
while waiting for the next
quake.
Scientists are now investigat
ing numerous methods of pre
dicting these temblors, and
one of their most intriguing
theories is that unusual animal
behavior precedes ear
thquakes.
