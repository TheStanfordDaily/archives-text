# The 						new Counterpoint
## 
### Hank Duderstadt 
The Stanford Alumni "Half-
Century" Club called them the
"Ladies of the Mendicants."
The Mendicants wanted to title
them the "Condiments." But
"Counterpoint" is the official
name of Stanford's first female
counterpart to the singing
Mendicants.
Conceived and created by

sophomores Linda Chin and
Joyce Rogers, Counterpoint
has enjoyed amazing success
since its public debut in April.
Rogers remembered the
formative days in late winter
and said, "We decided that
we'd do something about the
lack of a women's singing
group instead of waiting
around." She described the

organization as providing a
"Mendicants experience for
women."
"I was sure we could get a
group started if we tried," she
said.
And it worked. More than 40
women showed up for audi
tions in the last week of winter
quarter.
Since then, Counterpoint
has performed for three
alumni functions, at several
other concerts and at "Splen
dor on the Grass" last Satur
day.
The group's biggest break
came last week when they won
the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion's $750 Robert Pierce
Memorial Award, given to the
"most innovative student pro
ject" of the year.
Counterpoint's music is di
verse, including everything
from '40s tunes to madrigals to
folk. Some are original, others
are student arranged.
Rogers said she felt Coun
terpoint's reception here has
been great, with strong in
terest being expressed by
many women.
The Mendicants have also
shown great support, Joyce
commented. "They've helped
a lot. They've given us a lot of

good suggestions. They even
encourage people to listen to
us and support us."
Mark Keller, a Mendicant
who doubles as bass player for
Counterpoint, agreed. He said
the Mendicants have always
felt it strange that there
wasn't a women's counterpart
to the Mendicants on campus.
There were no initial nega
tive feelings among the Men
dicants about Counterpoint,
Keller said, though he added
that the men limited their ad
vice so as to avoid any chances
of railroading the young
group.
In regards to their unusual
title, Rogers said, "We picked
it primarily because it was a
musical term, but also because
it has that other shade of mean
ing (political) in it."
But she was quick to em
phasize that the group itself
has no political orientation and
is not a feminist organization.
The next concert for Coun
terpoint will be Monday in
Kresge Auditorium, with the
Mendicants and Yale Whiffen
poofs.
Rogers said the group will
again be having auditions next
September.
