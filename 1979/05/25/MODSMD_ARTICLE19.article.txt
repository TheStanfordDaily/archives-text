# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Geiger's actions praised 
### 
Last fall, Athletic Director Andy
Geiger told the ASSU Senate that he
would consider lifting the so-called
"bottle ban" at home football
games.
On May 14, Geiger did just that,
dispensing with an unenforceable
and unnecessary rule banning al
coholic beverages from the stadium.
The rule had antagonized not only
students, but faculty and alumni as
well.

More recently, Geiger revealed
plans to reorganize the Athletic
Dept. He hopes this will result in in
creased funding for athletics here,
especially the club sports program.
Geiger has consistently de
monstrated concern for student in
terests and has dedicated himself to
the improvement of the athletic
program here. We applaud his ef
forts.
