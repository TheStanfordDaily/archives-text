# Campus Conference interview
## Lyman on draft, mascot, tuition 
### David Frank 
President Richard Lyman said that he is not "en
thusiastic for conscription," and does not think the Uni
versity has "special reason" for speaking out on the
matter.
Lyman, who made the remarks last night on KZSU's
"Campus Conference," said that the most important
reason for speaking out on the issue is that conscription
would affect a large proportion of the student popula
tion.
"But, that isn't enough to give us a very distinctive
outlook on the matter," he added.
Lyman said he disagrees with such people as Daniel
Ellsberg, who think that conscription is a threat to world
peace. He also denounced the notion that U.S. presi
dents would use a civilian draft as a weapon "without
regard for morality or national interest."
According to Lyman, the present volunteer system
could work better. The conscription question, he said, is
primarily concerned with such issues as whether the

volunteer system can maintain adequate reserves and
whether servicemen can handle highly sophisticated
equipment.
In discussing the present state of the economy, Lyman
said double-digit inflation is a "very serious threat" to
educational institutions.
The University has two alternatives in dealing with
higher costs. One of them requires raising tuition.
The other alternative calls for budget cuts which
Lyman said have been used here successfully in the past.
"Obviously," Lyman said after the program, "there is
no magic answer. A combination of alternatives is usu
ally best."
Lyman also expressed sympathy for student concern
on the school mascot issue. This week the ASSU Senate
distributed surveys to students in dormitories, asking
them which of the two proposed mascots they favor —
the tree or the griffin.
During the program, Lyman said he had not yet seen a
"groundswell of students' enthusiasm" for either of the
two proposals.
After the program, however, Lyman called it "highly
artificial" to use the results of the surveys as criteria to
determine a new mascot. "I'll have to wait and see to
determine the degree of enthusiasm and consensus,"
he said.
As for this year's rise in the number of minority applic
ants to graduate schools here, Lyman said he was satis
fied, but "a long ways from feeling complacent, because
one season doesn't establish a trend."
Lyman noted that the University seems to have had a
strong downward trend in the number of graduate
minority applications seeking admission.
After the talk show, he detailed ways in which the
University is trying to increase minority applications. He
noted efforts by the graduate dean's office which asks
departments to set and fulfill numerical goals. That of
fice is also trying to make more graduate fellowship
programs available for minority students.
During the program, Lyman also disclosed that Stan
ford supports legislative proposals calling for mandatory
retirement at age 70.
Stanford has had a mandatory retirement age of 65.
On May 15, Lyman announced that those faculty reach
ing this age between now and July 1,1982 would have the
option of remaining on duty half-time.
Lyman said a mandatory retirement age of 70 "would
ease our problems of insuring that there will be some
openings for younger people."
