## 'Me' decade on way out 
### 
For a long time freedom in the United States
has been closely associated with social and
physical mobility. The car has symbolized physi
cal mobility. It carries us swiftly and easily up to
thousands of miles in a relatively short time.
But this symbol has been somewhat tarnished
by the current gas shortage. Long waits in gas
lines have made some drivers realize that they
no longer own their cars, rather, their cars own
them.
Automobiles are only one example of the un
paralleled standard of living we have been en
joying for the last thirty years or so. Few of those
born after 1945 realize that this prosperity is
historically atypical. The era has created its own
special problems.
Ftaving the necessities for survival without
having to worry about it has created a sort of
psychic chaos in our minds. The imperatives of
survival have simply disappeared and the kind of
cooperation that was necessary to provide sub
sistence for people in an agrarian society has
also disappeared.
Self satisfied
What has replaced them are imperatives of
self-satisfaction. Our current prosperity has
freed us from the basic worries of survival and
now we are free to pursue higher, more indi
vidualistic goals.
But often we are sorely disappointed when we
do not live up to our expectations of progress.
We now have everything going for us (at least in
relation to subsistence farmers) and yet our
progess, be it physical, mental orspiritual seems
slow and difficult, even nonexistent. We quickly
fall into despair.
We can easily improve our material position.
We can work longer hours or get a better-paying

job and use the money to buy a new car or
stereo. But still we are restless. This freedom we
have is not so easy.
Work unfulfilling
More and more people are finding that
neither their money, work, nor possessions can
fill their lives. They are coming to realize that
none of these things make them free. All of
them are simply new masters for a forsaken
slave.
All our self-improvement seems to have gone
for naught. That better job, better car, better
tennis game, all fail to fill the void created
by despair of having to act on one's own.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote in his Social
Contract, "Man is born free and everywhere is in
chains. "But I have begun to think that Rousseau
got it backwards. Perhaps the correct formula is
this: "Man is born in chains, yet everywhere he
thinks he can be free."
Freedom illusory
Some people are finally relinquishing their ar
rogance. They have discarded the empty notion
that they can do it alone, that they can be free of
others. "Doing your own thing" (to the exclu
sion of others) is going the way of the au
tomobile. The freedom of both is illusory.
At last some people are sacrificing their
preoccupation with work or study or material
goods long enough to make friendships which
mitigate the stagnating loneliness our societv
caMs rugged individualism. They are finally rid
ding themselves ot a loneliness that has frus
trated their growth all along.
It seems that the "me" generation, like the
decade, is coming to an end. Reach out America.
Choose your chains, but choose them wisely.
