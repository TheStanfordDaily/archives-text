Secular ethics
In the May 2 issue of Campus
Report an article appeared re
garding Father Eugene Boyle,
chaplain of Stanford's Catholic
Newman Center, and his plans
to establish an institute for
study of ethical issues involved
in the practice of such profes
sions as business, law and
medicine.
According to the article,
Boyle has already set up some
beginning discussions with
members of the Business and
Law Schools were he feels
there is a need for a forum on
moral problems in the profes
sional disciplines. My own
opinion is that this is not only a
novel idea, but also a highly
desirable one.
However, I am disturbed by
some of Boyle's statements in
dicating that the Newman
Center in Palo Alto would
make an appropriate base for
the institute. Although he

would have his ecumenical or
ganization be independent of
the business, law and medical
schools, he stresses that it
would be interdependent with
the schools. And apparently
Boyle is quite candid about the
fact that the institute would
"complement the (Newman)
Center's original mission, mak
ing it more complete, bringing
it into a more institutional rela
tionship with the University it
self." This is because "Just as
the University may draw from
the rich traditions of theology
and religion, so the Church has
much more to learn as well."
Unlike Boyle, I do not feel
that, "It is the business of
theology ... to supply the
context within which the pro
fessions and other disciplines
examine the moral aspects of
their work." In fact, religion
has no monopoly on morality,
and it frightens me to imagine a
largely Catholic-based institu
tion sponsoring discussions

with medical students on an
issue such as abortion, where
as much objectivity as possible
is sorely needed. Discussion of
ethical problems with notions
such as individual and social
"sin," which Boyle mentions in
the article, can only serve to
confuse the participants.
A better alternative would be
a program where ethical issues
are discussed by students with
professional philosophers and
experienced doctors, lawyers
and businessmen. Such a
program would be a secular
one having no overriding
supernatural or dogmatic van
tage point, but rather the
humanistic goal of better in
forming future professionals
by means of critical, yet em
pathetic dialogue on relevant
ethical issues.

Verdict tragic
It is inconceivable that the
verdict in the Dan White case
was voluntary manslaughter
and not murder in the first de
gree. The defense contended
that White did not premeditate
the murders, but instead
"snapped" and acted in a state
of "diminished capacity" —
thus the manslaughter verdict.
It is tragic that the members
of the jury placed such cre
dence on psychiatrist's tes
timony (conjecture at best)
concerning White's state of
mind, instead of drawing con
clusions based on the facts.
The facts indicate that White
did premeditate the murders
— first, packing a gun, and
then proceeding to city hall
where he went in through a
window knowing full well he
could not enter through the
metal detectors by the doors.
This particular decision is an
outrage and a miscarriage of
justice when one remembers
that others in the past have
been given first-degree mur
der convictions based on only
circumstantial evidence.
White, on the other hand, will
receive a mere eight years in
prison at most.
In order that this type of de
cision never occurs again, the
legislature and other approp
riate law-making bodies

should be put on notice that
the "diminished capacity" laws
should be revoked. Society
must not permit the Dan White
of the future to go free.

Vital fluids diluted
I am writing to give my full
approval to Dagmara Hill's letter
"End Flouridation" (Daily, May
18) and to expand on it. As
philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach
showed, there is a close con
nection between what we eat
and drink and the general
socio-economic climate of the
country.
We must realize that to func
tion properly as intelligent, ra
tional beings we must preserve
our bodies from all contamin
ants. When it comes to our
bodily fluids, purity is of the
essence. In this light we see
that flouridation represents
merely another attempt to di
lute our vital bodily fluids,
thereby undermining the
moral fiber of this great na
tion.
Taking the historical
perspective, it becomes evi
dent that, yes, only the com
munists could be responsible
for this. Flouridation is there
fore only a part of the
worldwide communist conspi
racy to destroy the American
way of life.
If you support Motherhood,
Chevrolet and Apple-pie, you
must oppose the flouridation
of our drinking water as the vil
est manifestation yet of all that
is un-American.

Typing error
A Daily typographical error
in my piece on Bruce Franklin
(May 23) said the American
Civil Liberties Union had al
ways "liked" cases like his. The
text should have read: "The
ACLU has no intention of
dropping (the Franklin case).
Historically, they say, they
have always won cases like
this."
It is not as a hobby, but in
confidence of eventual victory,
that they are pursuing it.
