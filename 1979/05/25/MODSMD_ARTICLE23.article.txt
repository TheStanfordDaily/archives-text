## Aim of 'pro-life' forces doubted 
### 
Tim Davis, in his emotional
article "Abortion an unaccept
able solution", (Daily, May 11)
states he is speaking for
"Right-to-Life" groups (or
anti-choice groups.) He does
an excellent job of personify
ing the anti-choice movement.
His fanatic presentation of
poorly documented argu
ments are the means by which
"Right-to-Lifers" politick.
Davis calls abortion
"genocide of the poor" advo
cated by "Planned Parenthood
and the government." This is
absurd. One of the goals of
Planned Parenthood is to "as
sure that all effective means of
voluntary fertility control are
fully accessible to persons re
gardless of race, creed, color,
religion, sex, age, national ori
gin, handicap or ability to pay
(emphasis is mine).
Granted, it is a fairly large
goal, but I fail to see its connec
tion to genocide. Rather, it is a
goal to help the poor. Denying
poor women abortions (which
is a reality due to the Hyde
Amendment), traps them in a
poverty/welfare cycle. Popr
women, burdened by un
wanted children, cannot get

job training or go to work and
hence cannot upgrade their
lives.
Davis' anti-choice stand is
clearly one of maintaining
the status quo. He offers no
constructive solutions, but
simply continues his denuncia
tion of abortion.
He goes on to say that
"everyone" wants poor people
to have abortions and that
"everyone" wants the poor to
have as few children as possi
ble so as not to be a burden. I
have no idea who the
"everyone" he refers to is.
Pro-choice groups do not ad
vocate mandatory abortions
for anyone, but rather the
freedom to choose. However,
Davis is clearly advocating
mandatory pregnancy and
motherhood.
Real issue blurred
Davis' tactic of focusing on
abortion as genocide and as a
form of racism is the same sort
of sensationalism characteris
tically used by anti-choice
groups to blur the real issue
behind their movement. The
real thrust of the anti-choice
movement is a sexual moral
ity campaign. I question
whether the "Pro-Lifers" main
objective really is "promoting
responsibility in sex," as Davis
says. Rather, the "responsibil
ity" Davis speaks of is absten
tion from sex.
As he pointed out in an ear
lier article, he has no sympathy
for women "who cannot exert
self-control." Is it then the
woman's "fault" for becoming

pregnant, and must she suffer
the burden of her "immoral
ity" by bearing an unwanted
child? It is naive to believe that
if no sex education, no con
traception and no abortion are
available there will be no sex
—or at least no "promiscuous"
sex.
Davis continues his emo
tional rampage by crying that
abortion is "murder." He says
the fetus is a "human being, an
entire being by itself." While
few would deny a developing
fetus is a form of human life, its
separation from the pregnant
woman is biologically incor
rect. It is connected by a very
real placenta and is not viable
until 24 to 26 weeks after con
ception.Ninety percent of all
abortions are performed at 12
weeks or less and 50 percent at
eight weeks or less.
Opinion, not fact
Saying that the fetus is a
"person" from the time of
conception is a matter of opin
ion or religious belief, not fact.
When personhood is attained
is a matter of religion and val
ues. For example, most Protes
tant and jewish denominations
regard the fetus as a potential
human, but not a person in its
own right until birth.
A law stating that "human
life" begins at conception
would be allowing one religi
ous dogma to become law.
This would counter the ideal of
separation of church and state.
People have a right to treat the
fetus as a person if they so wish.
What is objectionable is their

insistence that the law be used
to make everyone else treat the
fetus as a person.
Davis uses an analogy of
abortion mentality to imply
that it will lead to the killing of
the elderly and handicapped.
This is a matter of conjecture
and I see no connection bet
ween abortion and homocide.
In countries were abortion has
been legal for years, like Swe
den, there is no evidence that
respect for life has diminished
or abortion leads to killing of
any persons. Children are
wanted, planned and happy.
I question the self-righteous
stand of Davis and anti-choice
groups on the abortion issue.
What is it that allows them to
speak for the "unborn"? And
why does he feel the rights of a
fetus supersede any right of a
woman to control her body
and her life? If the anti-choice
stand is really one of the "ven
eration of life", why have over
15 abortion clinics throughout
the country been bombed by
fanatic elements this year?
Abortion is not a "luxury of
life" as Davis calls it, it is a real
ity. It cannot be stressed
enough — if abortions are not
legal, women will have illegal
abortions. A woman should
not have to choose between an
illegal abortion and an un
wanted child. Her "choice"
should include the legal, safe
and accessible abortion.

People have a right to treat the
fetus as a person if they so wish.
What is objectionable is their

insistence that the law be used
to make everyone else treat the
fetus as a person.
Davis uses an analogy of
abortion mentality to imply
that it will lead to the killing of
the elderly and handicapped.
This is a matter of conjecture
and I see no connection bet
ween abortion and homocide.
In countries were abortion has
been legal for years, like Swe
den, there is no evidence that
respect for life has diminished
or abortion leads to killing of
any persons. Children are
wanted, planned and happy.
I question the self-righteous
stand of Davis and anti-choice
groups on the abortion issue.
What is it that allows them to
speak for the "unborn"? And
why does he feel the rights of a
fetus supersede any right of a
woman to control her body
and her life? If the anti-choice
stand is really one of the "ven
eration of life", why have over
15 abortion clinics throughout
the country been bombed by
fanatic elements this year?
Abortion is not a "luxury of
life" as Davis calls it, it is a real
ity. It cannot be stressed
enough — if abortions are not
legal, women will have illegal
abortions. A woman should
not have to choose between an
illegal abortion and an un
wanted child. Her "choice"
should include the legal, safe
and accessible abortion.

Tim Davis, in his emotional
article "Abortion an unaccept
able solution", (Daily, May 11)
states he is speaking for
"Right-to-Life" groups (or
anti-choice groups.) He does
an excellent job of personify
ing the anti-choice movement.
His fanatic presentation of
poorly documented argu
ments are the means by which
"Right-to-Lifers" politick.
Davis calls abortion
"genocide of the poor" advo
cated by "Planned Parenthood
and the government." This is
absurd. One of the goals of
Planned Parenthood is to "as
sure that all effective means of
voluntary fertility control are
fully accessible to persons re
gardless of race, creed, color,
religion, sex, age, national ori
gin, handicap or ability to pay
(emphasis is mine).
Granted, it is a fairly large
goal, but I fail to see its connec
tion to genocide. Rather, it is a
goal to help the poor. Denying
poor women abortions (which
is a reality due to the Hyde
Amendment), traps them in a
poverty/welfare cycle. Popr
women, burdened by un
wanted children, cannot get

job training or go to work and
hence cannot upgrade their
lives.
Davis' anti-choice stand is
clearly one of maintaining
the status quo. He offers no
constructive solutions, but
simply continues his denuncia
tion of abortion.
He goes on to say that
"everyone" wants poor people
to have abortions and that
"everyone" wants the poor to
have as few children as possi
ble so as not to be a burden. I
have no idea who the
"everyone" he refers to is.
Pro-choice groups do not ad
vocate mandatory abortions
for anyone, but rather the
freedom to choose. However,
Davis is clearly advocating
mandatory pregnancy and
motherhood.
Real issue blurred
Davis' tactic of focusing on
abortion as genocide and as a
form of racism is the same sort
of sensationalism characteris
tically used by anti-choice
groups to blur the real issue
behind their movement. The
real thrust of the anti-choice
movement is a sexual moral
ity campaign. I question
whether the "Pro-Lifers" main
objective really is "promoting
responsibility in sex," as Davis
says. Rather, the "responsibil
ity" Davis speaks of is absten
tion from sex.
As he pointed out in an ear
lier article, he has no sympathy
for women "who cannot exert
self-control." Is it then the
woman's "fault" for becoming

pregnant, and must she suffer
the burden of her "immoral
ity" by bearing an unwanted
child? It is naive to believe that
if no sex education, no con
traception and no abortion are
available there will be no sex
—or at least no "promiscuous"
sex.
Davis continues his emo
tional rampage by crying that
abortion is "murder." He says
the fetus is a "human being, an
entire being by itself." While
few would deny a developing
fetus is a form of human life, its
separation from the pregnant
woman is biologically incor
rect. It is connected by a very
real placenta and is not viable
until 24 to 26 weeks after con
ception.Ninety percent of all
abortions are performed at 12
weeks or less and 50 percent at
eight weeks or less.
Opinion, not fact
Saying that the fetus is a
"person" from the time of
conception is a matter of opin
ion or religious belief, not fact.
When personhood is attained
is a matter of religion and val
ues. For example, most Protes
tant and jewish denominations
regard the fetus as a potential
human, but not a person in its
own right until birth.
A law stating that "human
life" begins at conception
would be allowing one religi
ous dogma to become law.
This would counter the ideal of
separation of church and state.

fetus as a person if they so wish.

insistence that the law be used
