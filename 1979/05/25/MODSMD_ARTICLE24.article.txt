## Collective action flawed 
### 
I witnessed a riot the other
night. You probably read about
it in the papers. San Francis
cans, principally members of
the gay community, were pro
testing the lenient sentence
given former Supervisor Dan
White, in front of City Hall.
About 9 p.m., the demonstra
tion turned into a riot.
Two friends and I were ac
ross the street in the Opera
House, listening to the musical
madness of P.D.Q. Bach, una
ware of the full extent of the
less-innocent madness taking
place just across the street.
When we got out of the con
cert, the riot was in full swing.
My car was parked in front of
City Hall, and in trying to reach
it (unsuccessfully, it turned
out), we saw crowds of people
on City Hall Square watching as
several police cars burned and
as rioters and police clashed.
The three of us turned, left
the area and spent several
more hours in an all-night re
staurant on Market Street wait
ing for the city, the center part
of which had become a boiling
cauldron, to quiet down.
It was an archetypal example
of what democracy has be
come. Collective human action
invariably occurs in three
forms: action by the irrational
mob, action taken by a group
according to due process, or
action which combines the
two. What makes
humanity human in its politics
is due process: individuals
form a group to facilitate action
and decision-making by agre
eing to rules and procedures
which govern the group's ac
tions.
Animal impluse
What makes the human race
animal is the impluse toward
group action which abides by
no consciously determined set
of procedures. We call it mob

rule, mob violence, or the irra
tional mob. But the phenome
non hinges on one notion: the
set of procedures governing
the irrational mob is instinc
tual, emotional, perhaps con
ditioned by past experience,
but always uncontrolled by the
conscious mind.
This certainly does injustice
to the motivations for mob ac
tion. Often, the mob seeks to
redress wrongs done it, to

Protests become opportunities to dis
perse tension, to let off psychological
steam.

mete out justice fairly, to call
attention to evils done to
others. Monday night's riots
were justifiable in this respect,
as were many of the great riots
of the 1960 s.
But many example of collec
tive peaceful protest have be
come examples of social vio
lence because the protest went
beyond its original intention to
call attention to an injustice.
Protests become opportunities
to disperse tension, to let off
psychological steam.
Tensions dispelled
When this happens, the
tenuously rational justification
which motivated the protests is
trampled underfoot by the
frighteningly amoral impulses
which the human animal is
capable of when its anarchic
mind seeks the gratification of

ical action.
I cannot pass a judgment on
Monday night's mob. How
could anyone, when judgment
implies a rational basis for
choice, and when collective
violence is so firmly rooted in
human nature that it not on
ly predates, but presupposes
rational systems of action?
My question for the reader is
this: if irrational and rational
ways of action are both inex-

cisable parts of human nature,
how can human beings who
have emotional and rational
shortcomings, join in a group
to reasonably reach decisions?
Clearly no political, economic ur
social system adequately takes
account of the dual nature of
human behavior: our impulses
toward rationality and our in
stincts and emotions.
By 2 a.m., the streets around
City Hall were fairly quiet, al
though I'd heard that the riot
ing was now centered around
Castro and Polk streets. We
made it safely back to my car,
which was surprisingly un
touched aside from a dented
roof. We even had enough gas
to get home.
