North by Northwest * * # *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This superb Hitchcock thriller
finds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual
— the working titlewas noXNorth
by Northwest but The Man in Lin
coln's Nose. Cary Grant plays a
man forced into flight after he is
mistaken for a spy and a mur
derer. Eva Marie Saint, among
the best of Hitchcock's ice
beauties, plays Eve Kendall, a
woman of uncertain loyalties
who finds her life thrown into the
same "alphabet soup" (the CIA,
the FBI. . .) as Grant.
Everything gels in this lightly
picaresque story: the perfor
mances, the classic sequences —
including the famous episode
where Grant almost gets killed by
a marauding crop-dusting plane
— and the music, which is Ber
nard Herrman at his best.

Crease * '
Guild, Menlo Park
Grease is fairly inoffensive, and
I suppose it is possible to have a
very good time at it. But can't we
demand a little bit better than this
kind of calculated entertainment,
presold like one would sell
Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Grease performed as a play by
Donner last year than I did watch
ing the movie; at least the people
in Donner appeared to be enjoy
ing themselves.
Grease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feeling
must please some people, and
while Grease is hardly a good
movie, sensations like that help
make it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Battlestar Calactica
Park, Menlo Park
There's no way this movie
could be better than TV — it/s TV,
a pilot episode, to be exact.
Battlestar Galactica's premiere
episode may have been blown up
to big-screen size, but all of its
little-screen ideas have been left
intact. Even on television this
program was sadly lacking in in
terest; in their efforts to out-do
Star Wars' special effects, the
people at ABC forgot to include
any characters worth watching.
The only interesting quirk was
the casting of Lome Greene as
the leader of the space clan: he
carries American imperialism
from the old west of Bonanza to
the wide-open spaces between
planets.

Superman * * #
Biograph, Palo Alto
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's hardly
great, director Richard Donner
makes a remarkable number of
right decisions, and what the
movie lacks in childlike wonder it
makes up with an experienced
comic-book sense. The movie
survives its overlong opening
sequence (Brando trying to
sound like Olivier) and finishes
rather breathlessly. As Lois Lane,
Margot Kidder is the best thing in
the movie — she brings out the
sexiness we always knew Lois
Lane had. (1978)
—R.L.
Wifemistress * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The premise of this film is an
interesting one. A wealthy man,
who pretends that he is dead in
order to escape being tried on a
murder charge, watches in
amazement as his formerly pas
sive wife blooms as an adminis
trator and as a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's good, the
execution is not. Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor
performances as the rich man,
the movie's pacing is patchy, and
the photography is all soft-focus
and oozy. Even these might be
bearable were it not for the film's
hysterically overblown score,
which sounds like Henry Mancini
run amuck.

The Deer Hunter itltit 1/2
Bijou, Palo Alto *
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at pxcavation.
—John Nielsen

Autumn Sonata * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alio
Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman
give exciting, obsessively
single-minded performances in
this Ingmar Bergman movie
about a parent-child relation
ship. The film can often be very
frustrating, because its language
cannot do justice to either the
performances or to Bergman's
assured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.
Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.
—J.M.
Hanover Street * *
Menlo Theater, Menlo Park
Writer-director Peter Hyams
makes a romantic tear-jerker set
during WWI "just like they used
to" but doesn't stop to re
member that most of those old
movies weren't that good in the
first place. Harrison Ford strug
gles valiently amidst the syrup,
and Lesley Anne-Down delivers a
stream of sugary inanities. Ford
and Christopher Plummer work
well together in the movie's sus
penseful subplot, but the movie,
as a whole, wallows in false
romanticism.
—R.L.
Coming Home * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
"(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. )ane Fonda and Jon
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.
—R.L.

Advise and Consent *
Friday, Kresge
Otto Preminger's pretentious
and bloated adaption of Allen
Drury's comic-book novel about
Washington politics. The movie
deals with a Senate confirmation
of a Cabinet appointment, and is
about two hours too long. Pulp
like this shouldn't be treated in
such epic, serious terms, but a
director like Preminger is so in
terested in being "daring" that
lightness goes by the wayside. A
mush-minded soap opera, and
Preminger's treatment of
homosexuality here is stupid and
disgusting.
—Ron Lillejord
The Buddy Holly Story * * *
Menlo, Menlo Park
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business; his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this picture
worthwhile. Busey can sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosyncratic actor; when the
plot gets saccharine toward the
end he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Story could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a finer
hick superstar than the one we've
got right now. _ r

Alien * * * *
Northpoint, San Francisco
Ridley Scott directed this
nightmarish science-fiction
movie about a crew of a space
craft menaced by an alien with a
penchant for human flesh. Alien
is essentially a bug-eyed monster
movie from the '50s brought up
to date; under Scott's direction,
however, it has a punch and wit
that hits even the most skeptical
viewer right between the eyes.
Alien is the best thriller we've had
since /aws, and the 45-minute
long special effects finale is a
sure-fire audience pleaser. The
seven-member cast includes
Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver,
and Veronica Cartwright.
—J.M.
Comes d Horseman
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
It's not clear here whether this
movie is so enjoyable because it
revives the pleasure of the west
ern or merely exploits the vie
wer's nostalgia for the genre.
Whatever the reasons, this is a
very seductive piece of filmmak
ing, helped immeasurably by its
performers: )ane Fonda, James
Caan and )ason Robards, who
plays the heavy with malicious
joy.
—J.M.

Manhattan * ★ * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photography
by Gordon Willis. Music by
George Gershwin.

Romeo and /uliet * *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Franco Zeffirelli directed this
version of Romeo and Juliet as if
the star-crossed lovers were
merely experiencing a particu
larly acute case of turbulent pub
erty: as portrayed by Leonard
Whiting and Olivia Hussey, it
seems as if all the pair needs to
mend their differences is a tube
of Clearasil. The movie is not
without an occasional affecting
moment, but it's like listening to
a symphony played by an

amateur orchestra — you know
that any brilliance is in the score,
not the performers.
—J.M.
The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock).
)ane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, James Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics.
—R.L.
