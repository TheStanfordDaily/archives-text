Egalitarianism as a Revolt
Against Nature and Other Es
says
Murray Rothbard
Libertarian Review Press
A book — at least this book
— should not be judged by its
title.
The unfortunate and un
wieldly choice of title leads one
to expect a series of drearily
partisan polemics. Fortunately,
one's expectations are not ful
filled.
Rothbard, a leading intellec
tual of the growing libertarian
movement, provided an intro
duction to libertarian ideas and
argued for their utility in solv
ing the current crises in
America in his earlier book, For
A New Liberty.
Egalitarianism as a Revolt
Against Nature and Other Es
says, which presupposes a
nodding acquaintance with the
ideas presented in For A New
Liberty, has more ambitious
aims.
Rothbard's purpose in these
collected essays appears to be
twofold: first, to set liber
tarianism in its proper
sociological, cultural, and
world-historical context; sec
ond, to present an integrated
libertarian perspective on the
crises currently facing the
human community.
Libertarianism is too often
presented either as a disem
bodied set of abstract ideas or
as a disconnected set of posi
tions on current political is
sues. Furthermore, while re
jecting the concrete positions
of the liberal-conservative es
tablishment, too many liberta
rians retain the attitudes and
prejudices (e.g., on foreign
policy) of liberal-conservatism.
Rothbard's achievement is to
transcend these limitations
and establish libertarianism as
an integrated world view chal
lenging both the liberal
conservatism that is regnant in
the West and the feudal
socialism that is dominant in

most of the rest of the world.
In "The Anatomy of the
State" and "Left and Right: The
Prospects for Liberty,"
Rothbard sets libertarianism in
its historical context. He ar
gues that the political history of
the last five millenia is the re
cord of class conflict not bet
ween workers and capitalists
but rather between, on the one
hand, the state apparatus and
its hangers-on, and on the
other hand, the productive
members of society. He main
tains that conservatism,
socialism, and contemporary
liberalism are merely variants
of the ideologies of the Old
Order, the ancien regime of
state exploitation and
privilege.
Indeed, both Left and Right
have often been quite explicit
in rejecting the revolution of
modernity. Members of the
inner circle of American con
servative intellectuals, cen
tered around William F.
Buckley's National Review,
have sometimes stated quite
openly that their central moti
vation is a yearning for the an
cien regime combined with an
opposition to the ideas un
leashed by the French Revolu
tion.
The Left has always shown
hostility to central facets of
modernity by rejecting the
market economy and demand
ing the institution of coercive
community. With the proven
tendency of Marxism-Leninism
to produce bloody nightmares
(most recently in Cambodia)
and the insipid failure of West
ern social democracy, the
American Left has increasingly
turned in a reactionary direc
tion, rejecting even those ele
ments of modernity —
rationalism, industrialism,
material progress — which it
once supported.
The historical role of liber
tarianism, Rothbard asserts, is
to bring to fruition the world
revolution of modernity begun

by classical liberalism and to
raise the banner of liberty,
reason, and progress in oppos
ition to the Old Order of state
exploitation and mystification.
In "War, Peace, and the
State" and "Justice and Prop
erty Rights," Rothbard applies
a libertarian perspective to
central problems of the mod
ern world.
In the former, he argues that
an integrated understanding of
the libertarian principles of
non-aggression and supre
macy of the individual requires
unremitting hostility to the
war-making activities of the
nation-state. He argues that
warfare between nations invar
iably violates individual rights
and that libertarians — unlike
liberals, conservatives, and
socialists — must therefore al
ways oppose inter-state war
fare.
In the latter essay, Rothbard
argues for a concept of prop
erty that is grounded in justice.
Hiding behind the Proudho
nian dictum "Property is
theft!", socialists steal prop
erty from its rightful owners
and hand it over to the elite of
the socialist state. Implicitly
accepting the proposition
"Whatever is, is right!," con
servatives endorse the current
holdings of property, regard
less of how they were ac
quired.
Rothbard argues that liberta
rians, on the contrary, must
recognize as just only those ti
tles to property acquired
through primary acquisition,
productive labor, and volun
tary exchange. He argues that
where current property hold
ings are the result of theft —
which is the case in much of
the Third World, especially
with regard to land — liberta
rians must demand the return
of property to its rightful own
ers.
The least laudable essay in
the book is one which discus
ses women's liberation. While

Rothbard scores some valid
points against some members
of the "lunatic fringe" of the
feminist movement, he is in
sensitive to the issues which
should be central to a liberta
rian.
Rothbard must surely be
aware of the movement's his
tory: his insensitivity is inex
picable. His evident insensitiv
ity is, fortunately, not charac
teristic of libertarians; indeed,
there is an Association of Liber
tarian Feminists specifically
concerned with this issue.
The central spirit which in
fuses these essays is one of op
timism. As an organized
movement, libertarianism has
thus far been centered in the
English-speaking world: while
there have been libertarian
parties in Australia, Canada,
and the United States for sev
eral years, in the Third World a
libertarian party has been
formed only in Namibia
(Southwest Africa). However,
Rothbard maintains that the
objective historical conditions
for an end to the feudal
socialist Old Order and the
triumph of the libertarian re
volution are, in fact, even
brighter in the rest of the world
than in the U.S.
The central passion which
suffuses Rothbard's thought is
best summed up in his own
summary of the book's final es
say, "Why Be Libertarian?":
"The basic reason for one's
libertarianism should be a
passion for justice, for
sweeping away as quickly as
possible the tyranny, the
thievery, the mass murder
and enslavement, which
statism has, for too long, im
posed upon mankind. It is
only such a concern for jus
tice that can inspire the
Libertarian to try to abolish,
as quickly as he can (and far
from the Marxian sense), the
exploitation of man by
man."

war-making activities of the
nation-state. He argues that
warfare between nations invar
iably violates individual rights
and that libertarians — unlike
liberals, conservatives, and
socialists — must therefore al
ways oppose inter-state war
fare.
In the latter essay, Rothbard
argues for a concept of prop
erty that is grounded in justice.
Hiding behind the Proudho
nian dictum "Property is
theft!", socialists steal prop
erty from its rightful owners
and hand it over to the elite of
the socialist state. Implicitly
accepting the proposition
"Whatever is, is right!," con
servatives endorse the current
holdings of property, regard
less of how they were ac
quired.
Rothbard argues that liberta
rians, on the contrary, must
recognize as just only those ti
tles to property acquired
through primary acquisition,
productive labor, and volun
tary exchange. He argues that
where current property hold
ings are the result of theft —
which is the case in much of
the Third World, especially
with regard to land — liberta
rians must demand the return
of property to its rightful own
ers.
The least laudable essay in
the book is one which discus
ses women's liberation. While

Rothbard scores some valid
points against some members
of the "lunatic fringe" of the
feminist movement, he is in
sensitive to the issues which
should be central to a liberta
rian.
Rothbard must surely be
aware of the movement's his
tory: his insensitivity is inex
picable. His evident insensitiv
ity is, fortunately, not charac
teristic of libertarians; indeed,
there is an Association of Liber
tarian Feminists specifically
concerned with this issue.
The central spirit which in
fuses these essays is one of op
timism. As an organized
movement, libertarianism has
thus far been centered in the
English-speaking world: while
there have been libertarian
parties in Australia, Canada,
and the United States for sev
eral years, in the Third World a
libertarian party has been
formed only in Namibia
(Southwest Africa). However,
Rothbard maintains that the
objective historical conditions
for an end to the feudal
socialist Old Order and the
triumph of the libertarian re
volution are, in fact, even
brighter in the rest of the world
than in the U.S.
The central passion which
suffuses Rothbard's thought is
best summed up in his own
summary of the book's final es
say, "Why Be Libertarian?":
"The basic reason for one's
libertarianism should be a
passion for justice, for
sweeping away as quickly as
possible the tyranny, the
thievery, the mass murder
and enslavement, which
statism has, for too long, im
posed upon mankind. It is
only such a concern for jus
tice that can inspire the
Libertarian to try to abolish,
as quickly as he can (and far
from the Marxian sense), the
exploitation of man by
man."

Egalitarianism as a Revolt
Against Nature and Other Es
says
Murray Rothbard
Libertarian Review Press
A book — at least this book
— should not be judged by its
title.
The unfortunate and un
wieldly choice of title leads one
to expect a series of drearily
partisan polemics. Fortunately,
one's expectations are not ful
filled.
Rothbard, a leading intellec
tual of the growing libertarian
movement, provided an intro
duction to libertarian ideas and
argued for their utility in solv
ing the current crises in
America in his earlier book, For
A New Liberty.
Egalitarianism as a Revolt
Against Nature and Other Es
says, which presupposes a
nodding acquaintance with the
ideas presented in For A New
Liberty, has more ambitious
aims.
Rothbard's purpose in these
collected essays appears to be
twofold: first, to set liber
tarianism in its proper
sociological, cultural, and
world-historical context; sec
ond, to present an integrated
libertarian perspective on the
crises currently facing the
human community.
Libertarianism is too often
presented either as a disem
bodied set of abstract ideas or
as a disconnected set of posi
tions on current political is
sues. Furthermore, while re
jecting the concrete positions
of the liberal-conservative es
tablishment, too many liberta
rians retain the attitudes and
prejudices (e.g., on foreign
policy) of liberal-conservatism.
Rothbard's achievement is to
transcend these limitations
and establish libertarianism as
an integrated world view chal
lenging both the liberal
conservatism that is regnant in
the West and the feudal
socialism that is dominant in

most of the rest of the world.
In "The Anatomy of the
State" and "Left and Right: The
Prospects for Liberty,"
Rothbard sets libertarianism in
its historical context. He ar
gues that the political history of
the last five millenia is the re
cord of class conflict not bet
ween workers and capitalists
but rather between, on the one
hand, the state apparatus and
its hangers-on, and on the
other hand, the productive
members of society. He main
tains that conservatism,
socialism, and contemporary
liberalism are merely variants
of the ideologies of the Old
Order, the ancien regime of
state exploitation and
privilege.
Indeed, both Left and Right
have often been quite explicit
in rejecting the revolution of
modernity. Members of the
inner circle of American con
servative intellectuals, cen
tered around William F.
Buckley's National Review,
have sometimes stated quite
openly that their central moti
vation is a yearning for the an
cien regime combined with an
opposition to the ideas un
leashed by the French Revolu
tion.
The Left has always shown
hostility to central facets of
modernity by rejecting the
market economy and demand
ing the institution of coercive
community. With the proven
tendency of Marxism-Leninism
to produce bloody nightmares
(most recently in Cambodia)
and the insipid failure of West
ern social democracy, the
American Left has increasingly
turned in a reactionary direc
tion, rejecting even those ele
ments of modernity —
rationalism, industrialism,
material progress — which it
once supported.
The historical role of liber
tarianism, Rothbard asserts, is
to bring to fruition the world
revolution of modernity begun

by classical liberalism and to
raise the banner of liberty,
reason, and progress in oppos
ition to the Old Order of state
exploitation and mystification.
In "War, Peace, and the
State" and "Justice and Prop
erty Rights," Rothbard applies
a libertarian perspective to
central problems of the mod
ern world.
In the former, he argues that
an integrated understanding of
the libertarian principles of
non-aggression and supre
macy of the individual requires
unremitting hostility to the
