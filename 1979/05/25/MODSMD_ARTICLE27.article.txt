Random House
By publishing Sports of Our Times, a com
pilation of New York Times sportswriter Dave
Anderson's best columns, Random House
has let the rest of the sports-reading public in
on one of New York's best-kept secrets: An
derson is one of the best sportswriters in the
country.
Anderson has won the New York Sports
Writer of the Year award three of the last five
years, yet he has not achieved the notoriety
that Red Smith, his Pulitzer Prize-winning col
league at the Times, or Jim Murray of The Los
Angeles Times has.
Perhaps this is because of his style. While
Murray writes with the flashiness and fire of a
Pete Rose, Anderson writes with the fluidity
and steadiness of a Hank Aaron. Like Aaron's,
Anderson's talents are unnoticed day-by
day. When compiled, however, they signify
the heights he has achieved.
Also, like Aaron, Anderson has done his
finest work in baseball. If one might venture
that Aaron was born with a bat in his hand, it
is safe to say that Anderson entered the world
with a pen in his.
Solitary artistry
In writing about the sixth game of the 1975
World Series, considered by many to be one
of the greatest games in baseball history, An
derson defines the essence of baseball as its
"solitary artistry."
"In each case the solitary artistry was not
obscured in a trample of bodies, which oc
curs in football, or in collisions near the
backboard, which occur in basketball, or in a
scramble near the goal, which occurs in hoc
key. The solitary artistry of baseball is thereto
be seen, not obscured," Anderson writes.
Unlike most sportswriting compilations,
Sports of Our Times is garnished with com
mentary by Anderson himself. Previous
books — Jimmy Cannon's Nobody Asked
Me, But. . . . comes to mind — have been
simply the columns strung together and pub
lished. Anderson explains the circumstances
behind each column and includes items that
either could not be published or weren't
known at the time.

Anderson devotes a chapter each to three
of the greatest and/or most controversial
sports figures of the past two decades:
Aaron, Joe Namath, and Muhammad Ali. In
each of these chapters, Anderson's skill is
most apparent.
Describing Aaron's 715 th home run — "In
the decades to come, the memory of the
scene might blur. But the memory of the
sound will remain with everyone who was
here" — or Namath proudly disdaining a
wheelchair as he hobbles to a limousine
which will take him to one more appointment
with the scalpel. Anderson gives the reader
an insight into what makes each man as great
as he is. And by compiling columns so that
they cover the athlete's entire career, Ander
son shows that each man loves what he is
doing.
Loves to write
Anderson clearly loves what he is doing,
and conveys that love to the reader.
"As a sportswriter now, I'm occasionally
asked if I'm a frustrated athlete," Anderson
writes. "Those people don't understand that
I never wanted to play baseball like Stan Mu
sial and Joe DiMaggio; I wanted to write
baseball like Red Smith in the Herald-Tribune
and Jimmy Cannon in the Post. .
In The Yankees, Anderson's chronicling of
the DiMaggio years is one of the two bright
spots of the four-part book. Each writer takes
a different segment of Yankee dynasty; of the
four, only Anderson and Murray Chass suc
ceed in writing interesting chapters of Yan
kee history.
Chass, as the Times current Yankee cor
respondent, gives a man-on-the-scene view
of the troubled firing of Billy Martin, and the
success of the Yankees with and without him.
The clubhouse politics, the meddling of
owner George Steinbrenner, and the never
dull Reggie Jackson fit like characters in a
Shakesperean play under Chass's deft handl
ing.
As for the other two segments — Robert
Creamer on the Babe Ruth-Lou Gehrig years
and Harold Rosenthal on the Mickey
Mantle-Casey Stengel era — each chapter
reads like one of those dime-a-dozen
magazines that tell who is going to win the
pennant. In this case, nobody wins.

"In each case the solitary artistry was not
obscured in a trample of bodies, which oc
curs in football, or in collisions near the
backboard, which occur in basketball, or in a
scramble near the goal, which occurs in hoc
key. The solitary artistry of baseball is thereto
be seen, not obscured," Anderson writes.
Unlike most sportswriting compilations,
Sports of Our Times is garnished with com
mentary by Anderson himself. Previous
books — Jimmy Cannon's Nobody Asked
Me, But. . . . comes to mind — have been
simply the columns strung together and pub
lished. Anderson explains the circumstances
behind each column and includes items that
either could not be published or weren't
known at the time.

Anderson devotes a chapter each to three
of the greatest and/or most controversial
sports figures of the past two decades:
Aaron, Joe Namath, and Muhammad Ali. In
each of these chapters, Anderson's skill is
most apparent.
Describing Aaron's 715 th home run — "In
the decades to come, the memory of the
scene might blur. But the memory of the
sound will remain with everyone who was
here" — or Namath proudly disdaining a
wheelchair as he hobbles to a limousine
which will take him to one more appointment
with the scalpel. Anderson gives the reader
an insight into what makes each man as great
as he is. And by compiling columns so that
they cover the athlete's entire career, Ander
son shows that each man loves what he is
doing.
Loves to write
Anderson clearly loves what he is doing,
and conveys that love to the reader.
"As a sportswriter now, I'm occasionally
asked if I'm a frustrated athlete," Anderson
writes. "Those people don't understand that
I never wanted to play baseball like Stan Mu
sial and Joe DiMaggio; I wanted to write
baseball like Red Smith in the Herald-Tribune
and Jimmy Cannon in the Post. .
In The Yankees, Anderson's chronicling of
the DiMaggio years is one of the two bright
spots of the four-part book. Each writer takes
a different segment of Yankee dynasty; of the
four, only Anderson and Murray Chass suc
ceed in writing interesting chapters of Yan
kee history.
Chass, as the Times current Yankee cor
respondent, gives a man-on-the-scene view
of the troubled firing of Billy Martin, and the
success of the Yankees with and without him.
The clubhouse politics, the meddling of
owner George Steinbrenner, and the never
dull Reggie Jackson fit like characters in a
Shakesperean play under Chass's deft handl
ing.
As for the other two segments — Robert
Creamer on the Babe Ruth-Lou Gehrig years
and Harold Rosenthal on the Mickey
Mantle-Casey Stengel era — each chapter
reads like one of those dime-a-dozen
magazines that tell who is going to win the
pennant. In this case, nobody wins.

Random House
By publishing Sports of Our Times, a com
pilation of New York Times sportswriter Dave
Anderson's best columns, Random House
has let the rest of the sports-reading public in
on one of New York's best-kept secrets: An
derson is one of the best sportswriters in the
country.
Anderson has won the New York Sports
Writer of the Year award three of the last five
years, yet he has not achieved the notoriety
that Red Smith, his Pulitzer Prize-winning col
league at the Times, or Jim Murray of The Los
Angeles Times has.
Perhaps this is because of his style. While
Murray writes with the flashiness and fire of a
Pete Rose, Anderson writes with the fluidity
and steadiness of a Hank Aaron. Like Aaron's,
Anderson's talents are unnoticed day-by
day. When compiled, however, they signify
the heights he has achieved.
Also, like Aaron, Anderson has done his
finest work in baseball. If one might venture
that Aaron was born with a bat in his hand, it
is safe to say that Anderson entered the world
with a pen in his.
Solitary artistry
In writing about the sixth game of the 1975
World Series, considered by many to be one
of the greatest games in baseball history, An
derson defines the essence of baseball as its
"solitary artistry."
"In each case the solitary artistry was not
obscured in a trample of bodies, which oc
curs in football, or in collisions near the
backboard, which occur in basketball, or in a
scramble near the goal, which occurs in hoc
key. The solitary artistry of baseball is thereto
be seen, not obscured," Anderson writes.
Unlike most sportswriting compilations,
Sports of Our Times is garnished with com
mentary by Anderson himself. Previous
books — Jimmy Cannon's Nobody Asked
Me, But. . . . comes to mind — have been
