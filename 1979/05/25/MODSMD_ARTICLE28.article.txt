# Cards take 3rd in NCAAs
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Stanford's men's tennis team
closed but its season yesterday
on a winning note, defeating
Southern Methodist University
6-3 at the NCAA champion
ships at Athens, Georgia. The
win gave the Cards third place
in the team tournament and a
19-4 record on the season.

UCLA won the tournament
over Trinity, 5-3.
Peter Rennert got his first
win of the tournament when
he bested Jai DiLouie 6-4, 6-4.
The win should give Rennert a
little more confidence going
into the individual tournament
today. Rennert is seeded

eighth but has dual match wins
over No. 1 seed Kevin Curren,
No. 3 seed Fritz Buehning and
No. 4 seed Robert Van't Hof. In
the semifinal match Rennert
held a match point on Buehn
ing, but the UCLA sophomore
saved it and with that may have
turned the tide for the Bruins.
Rennert will face Mike Gan
dolfo of Clemson in the first
round.
Lloyd Bourne remained un
defeated in post season dual
match play. He defeated Mark
Turpin 6-3, 7-6 for his 12th
straight win spanning his three
year career. Bourne is un
seeded but placed in the top 16
and will meet Tommy Cain
today in first round play.
Tim Mayotte is the Cards'
final entry in the singles tour
ney. Mayotte finished up the
season with a fine 18-8 record
which earned him a place
among the top 16 players in the
nation.
Yesterday he avenged one of
his four losses with a double
tiebreaker win over Chris De
laney 7-6, 7-6. Delaney de
feated Mayotte 6-1, 7-6 in their
first match when SMU was
here earlier in the year.
Tom Cain who plays Bourne
tomorrow got by Scott Bon
durant 6-3, 6-3 and both Mark
Vines and Drew Gitlin had to
struggle before pulling
through to even the match up
at three-all after the singles.
Vines defeated Jeff Arons 7-5,
1-6, 6-0 and Gitlin took care of
Hodges 1-6, 6-3, 6-3.
The Cards once again were
tough in the doubles. In fact,
during the tournament they
won nine of 11 doubles
matches, the only losses com
ing to UCLA. Both of those los
ses were in three sets and one
in the final set tiebreaker.
Bourne and Rennert started
the festivities with a 6-2,6-2 win
over DiLouie and Turpin. Since
their early season problems
the pair have jelled as a team
and earned the No. 6 seeding
in the individual doubles tour
nament.

Leading 4-3 it was only fitting
that the team of Mayotte and
Arons, 12-0 on the year, should
nail the final spike. They de
feated Delaney and Jeff Turpin
in fine style, 6-4, 6-3, and the
Cards had defeated the team
that snapped their 40 match
win streak earlier in the year.
John Corse also got a chance
to play in his home state. He
teamed with Bondurant to de
feat Cain and Vines 7-5, 7-6 and
the Cards were an easy winner
against the team that
humiliated them earlier in the
year.
This will be the first NCAA
singles tournament experience
for all the Stanford com
petitors. Rennert and Bourne
although juniors, have never
been invited before. If Rennert
gets over his mini-slump he is a
definite contender for the title
as his past performance indi
cates. Bourne seems to be
picking up as he usually does this
time of year; he is also a
threat. Stanford's third entry
Tim Mayotte has in his first year
already established himself as
one of the top players in the
nation. All three may be just
one year away, but there is no
way they can be counted out
this year. Bondurant is the first
alternate and it is unknown yet
whether anyone will drop out
of the tournament.
In doubles Rennert and
Bourne are the Cards' only
hope.
Stanford has had the singles
champion four of the last six
years. In 1973 Sandy Mayer
took the title, in 1974 John
Whitlinger won, in 1977 Matt
Mitchell placed first and last
year John McEnroe won the
tournament.

The Cards once again were
tough in the doubles. In fact,
during the tournament they
won nine of 11 doubles
matches, the only losses com
ing to UCLA. Both of those los
ses were in three sets and one
in the final set tiebreaker.
Bourne and Rennert started
the festivities with a 6-2,6-2 win
over DiLouie and Turpin. Since
their early season problems
the pair have jelled as a team
and earned the No. 6 seeding
in the individual doubles tour
nament.

Leading 4-3 it was only fitting
that the team of Mayotte and
Arons, 12-0 on the year, should
nail the final spike. They de
feated Delaney and Jeff Turpin
in fine style, 6-4, 6-3, and the
Cards had defeated the team
that snapped their 40 match
win streak earlier in the year.
John Corse also got a chance
to play in his home state. He
teamed with Bondurant to de
feat Cain and Vines 7-5, 7-6 and
the Cards were an easy winner
against the team that
humiliated them earlier in the
year.
This will be the first NCAA
singles tournament experience
for all the Stanford com
petitors. Rennert and Bourne
although juniors, have never
been invited before. If Rennert
gets over his mini-slump he is a
definite contender for the title
as his past performance indi
cates. Bourne seems to be
picking up as he usually does this
time of year; he is also a
threat. Stanford's third entry
Tim Mayotte has in his first year
already established himself as
one of the top players in the
nation. All three may be just
one year away, but there is no
way they can be counted out
this year. Bondurant is the first
alternate and it is unknown yet
whether anyone will drop out
of the tournament.
In doubles Rennert and
Bourne are the Cards' only
hope.
Stanford has had the singles
champion four of the last six
years. In 1973 Sandy Mayer
took the title, in 1974 John
Whitlinger won, in 1977 Matt
Mitchell placed first and last
year John McEnroe won the
tournament.

lIM MAYOTTE is ready for action here on the courts of Stanford
Tennis Stadium. The freshman has achieved win after win, and his
consistent play in regular season competition has earned him the
third spot in the individual singles competition in the NCAAs.
Stanford's men's tennis team
closed but its season yesterday
on a winning note, defeating
Southern Methodist University
6-3 at the NCAA champion
ships at Athens, Georgia. The
win gave the Cards third place
in the team tournament and a
19-4 record on the season.

UCLA won the tournament
over Trinity, 5-3.
Peter Rennert got his first
win of the tournament when
he bested Jai DiLouie 6-4, 6-4.
The win should give Rennert a
little more confidence going
into the individual tournament
today. Rennert is seeded

eighth but has dual match wins
over No. 1 seed Kevin Curren,
No. 3 seed Fritz Buehning and
No. 4 seed Robert Van't Hof. In
the semifinal match Rennert
held a match point on Buehn
ing, but the UCLA sophomore
saved it and with that may have
turned the tide for the Bruins.
Rennert will face Mike Gan
dolfo of Clemson in the first
round.
Lloyd Bourne remained un
defeated in post season dual
match play. He defeated Mark
Turpin 6-3, 7-6 for his 12th
straight win spanning his three
year career. Bourne is un
seeded but placed in the top 16
and will meet Tommy Cain
today in first round play.
Tim Mayotte is the Cards'
final entry in the singles tour
ney. Mayotte finished up the
season with a fine 18-8 record
which earned him a place
among the top 16 players in the
nation.
Yesterday he avenged one of
his four losses with a double
tiebreaker win over Chris De
laney 7-6, 7-6. Delaney de
feated Mayotte 6-1, 7-6 in their
first match when SMU was
here earlier in the year.
Tom Cain who plays Bourne
tomorrow got by Scott Bon
durant 6-3, 6-3 and both Mark
Vines and Drew Gitlin had to
struggle before pulling
through to even the match up
at three-all after the singles.
Vines defeated Jeff Arons 7-5,
1-6, 6-0 and Gitlin took care of
Hodges 1-6, 6-3, 6-3.
