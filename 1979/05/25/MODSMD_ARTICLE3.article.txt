Three-part harmony
That's what members of the audience will proba
bly hear Monday night when Yale's singing group,
the Whiffenpoofs, join the Mendicants and Coun
terpoint, Stanford's new female singing group, in a
concert at Kresge Auditorium. As Krisan Froelich
writes on page 3, the Whiffenpoofs are stopping
here as part of a world-wide tour. Also on page 3,
Hank Dunderstadt profiles Counterpoint.
Pet peeves
If someday you should spot a dog playing Snoopy
— and actually talking to biids — you might want to
get under the nearest doorway. Scientists are now
studying the possibility that when an animal acts in a
peculiar way he is predicting an earthquake. Debbie
Walker reports on this research on page 3.
Happie Chappie
A new issue of the Chaparral is on the streets, and
while it may not tickle every bone in your body, it
will shake more than a few. Brad Brockbank reviews
the latest effort on page 2.
Sporting prose
Wielding a pen with the style that Hank Aaron
swings a bat, sportswriter Dave Anderson captures
memorable sports moments in his new book, Sports
of Our Times. A compilation of Anderson's best
columns, the book is reviewed by Ivan Maisel on
page 6.
