# Booters fall to Bay Area youth team

### Dean Eyre 
To most people, the "gas
shortage" has meant cutting
back on automobile trips and
counting days in terms of odd
and even allotments.
For soccer teams in the
fourth annual Stanford Invita
tional, the threatened gas sta
tion owners strike and ques
tionable availability of gas took
on a different complexion. Col
lege teams from the Northwest

and Southern California had to
cancel and were replaced by
youth league teams in the Bay
Area. The result was a preview
of women's soccer in the fu
ture.
This preview stimulated
mixed reactions from Stanford
head coach Phil Wright, lend
ing optimism to growing par
ticipation and high-level com
petition in the sport, but also
placing doubt on Stanford's

continued success.
For the first time since the
tourney originated, the hosts
failed to capture first place.
Concord United, an all-star
squad of high school age
athletes, defeated the Cardi
nals after an hour and a half of
regulation play, two ten
minute overtime periods and a
shootout tiebreaker to win the
three-day invitational.
Stanford reached the finals

by beating the Palo Alto
Wildcats and Panthers, a pair of
California Youth Soccer As
sociation 19-and-under squads
and Marin United, another all
star team.
In the Cards' 3-1 victory over
the Wildcats last Friday, Cindy
Shorney, Ellen Griep and Julie
Zender tallied. Against the
Panthers later that afternoon,
Shorney and Zender both
scored second-half goals to
overcome a 1 -0 Palo Alto lead at
halftime. Shorney also re
corded the lone goal in the
Marin match on Saturday.
In Sunday's finals pairing,
the Cards found themselves
playing catch-up again to a de
termined Concord team.
Shorney put the Cards on the
scorecard first with an assist by
Griep the first period ending at
1-0. Concord came roaring
back in the second half, taking
a 2-1 lead before Stanford tied
it up on an assist by Sue Handel
and a goal by Zender. Concord
took a 3-2 lead, but with 1:45
remaining in regulation play,
Griep and Shorney teamed up
again to even the score at three
goals apiece.
Both teams were held score
less during the ensuing over
time periods, setting the stage
for the shootout tiebreaker
used in North American Soccer
League games.
Shootouts consist of a one
on-one situation with the
goalie, alternating between the
two teams. After a whistle is
blown, the player with the ball,
starting 35 yards out from the
goalie, dribbles and shoots.
I he team with the most shoot

outs made good on five at
tempts wins the match.
Concord beat Stanford 2-1 in
the shootout, earning the
tourney's first-place trophy.
"I think we outplayed Con
cord," Wright commented on
the season's final game. "They
made three goals on four op
portunities, but I think we
would probably beat them
seven out of 10 times. We
learned something from it; it
was a positive experience."
Wright also noted the skill
level demonstrated by the
tourney's participants. "Many
of the members of the youth
teams have been playing since
they were 7 or 8 — it's good for
people to see that. It's also
good for the Athletic Depart
ment to see it, to make sure
they work to keep our program
on top."
Stanford placed three
players on the All-Tournament
squad, including Shorney at
midfield, Griep at forward and
Joan Sanders at goalkeeper.
While Stanford's first team
wrapped up its season with a
20-3-1 record last weekend, the
second squad is still compet
ing. Although 0-2 in the Stan
ford Invitational, the ll's de
feated Chasqui Wednesday af
ternoon 3-0.
Sanders, playing field
postitions instead of her usual
goalkeeping spot on the first
team, assisted Teresa Bertsch's
first-half goal. Diane Long
scored twice in the final
period, with one goal assisted
by Jennie Ferrier, against the
team of alumni and wives.
