# Swimmer Peyton has brain tumor
## 
### Associated Press 
Kim Peyton has been to the
top of the mountain in amateur
swimming. Getting there again
still matters, just not as much
as it used to.
That's because Kim Peyton
has a brain tumor.
"Right now, there is no diag
nosis," she said recently, more
than five months after she was
first stricken. "On June 5, I will
have the whole round of tests
again. It takes so long for
measurable changes to occur
there is nothing anyone can tell
me."
Peyton, a member of the
Olympic gold-medal 400-meter
relay at Montreal and the Stan
ford record-holder in three
events, was visiting a friend last
December 12 when she suf
fered seizures.
"It came upon me so fast,"
she recalls. "Five days later I
woke up in the hospital and
they told me I had a brain
tumor."
A biopsy was scheduled for
just after Christmas but Kim
convinced the doctors to delay
the surgery until March so she
could compete in the women's
collegiate national champion
ships.
Then in March, miraculously
the tumor had shrunk and doc
tors postponed the operation
again.
Next month the Stanford
junior will be examined again.
"It took me weeks to be
come myself again," she said
of the time following her re
lease from Stanford Medical
Center. "I was really airy. Sei
zures inflame your brain. I'm
back to myself now â€” except
for the drugs."
Since the tumor was disco
vered, Peyton has had to take

phenobarbital and probably
will take the drug for another
two to five years.
"I'm very emotional now,
thingscan getto me," she said.
"My defenses aren't up and
sometimes I can't cope. I've
had to deal with myself for 22
years, so I know it's the drugs."
The decision to resume
swimming last December was
the suggestion of Kim's boyf
riend Drew McDonald, a
member of the U.S. water polo
team. But the drugs have kept
her well under her previous
standards.
Not that Peyton has been
that bad. In the national meet
in March, she was sixth in the
50-freestyle, seventh in the 100
and anchored the Stanford
200-medley relay to an Ameri
can record.
But she realizes that she can
never be a world-class swim
mer again as long as she takes
drugs.
"And I just learned last week
the doctors would not certify
me to swim without drugs,"
she said. "There is an alterna
tive. Now I'm not saying I'm
going to do this, but I could
just swim in AAU meets and no
doctors would have any say
over me. The drugs are banned
in the Olympics, so if I wanted
to try for 1980, I would have to
take myself off them anyway.
"There is one drawback. If I
did have seizures again, I
would be on phenobarbital the
rest of my life. ... It is pretty
stupid to take a chance when
your goals have already been
achieved.
"I know something unex
pected could happen at any
time. It makes you realize that
you are not the chosen one."
