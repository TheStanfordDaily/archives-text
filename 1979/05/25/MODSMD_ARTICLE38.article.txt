Israel attacks Lebanese bases
Israeli warplanes strafed and bombed mountain
and coastal Palestinian bases deep inside Lebanon
for the second straight day yesterday, hours after
Palestinians shelled a northern Israeli border area.
Lebanese authorities claimed the raids caused
high civilian casualties.
Farther to the south, near El Arish, capital of the
occupied Sinai, defiant Jewish settlers who had
resisted eviction by throwing stones and vegeta
bles at Israeli soldiers, finally relented and gave up
their 10-acre farm so the area could be turned over
to Eygpt today.
In Jerusalem, a man was slightly injured when a
small bomb exploded in a suburban supermarket,
police said, but little damage was reported.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance arrived in Cairo
and immediately left by helicopter to meet in
Alexandria with President Anwar Sadat. On Sun
day the two are to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin in Beersheba, Israel, to begin
talks on Palestinian autonomy in occupied areas.
The military command in Tel Aviv announced
the aerial attack on "terrorist concentrations"
hours after a man and a woman were slightly in
jured when barrages of shells fell on northern
Israel. The command said without elaboration that
the artillery fire was returned.
Israeli military officials would not specify which
sites were hit in the mid-morning air raid, but
reports from Beirut said Israeli planes bombed
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla targets
in the Reihan mountains, 40 miles southeast of
Beirut.
Carter seeks U-2 spy clearance
Washington — With the U.S.-Soviet strategic
arms treaty-signing summit rapidly approaching,
the Carter administration is immersed in delicate
talks with Turkey aimed at winning clearance for
U-2 spy flights over that country.
The diplomatic maneuvering will have major re
percussions on the success of next month's sum
mit meeting and the fate of the SALT II treaty. The
flights over Turkey by American spy planes would
help U.S. intelligence make up for the loss of two
Iranian stations which monitored Soviet missile
tests.
The administration's success may be critical in
the Senate debate over ratification of the pact.
Influential critics like Sen. John Clenn (D-Ohio)
are saying the treaty will not be verifiable unless
the administration makes up for the loss of the
Iranian monitoring posts.
Informed sources, declining to be identified
publicly, say that sometime between now and
mid-June, when the summit is scheduled, the Un
ited States hopes to gain tacit Soviet acquiescence
for the flights.
That is the price that Turkish Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit has demanded before he will con

sider allowing the reconnaisance planes to use
Turkish airspace.
Exactly what form of Soviet acquiescence Ecevit
might demand is unclear.
Some sources say he will settle for a private
assurance, relayed by the United States from the
Soviets, that they will not retaliate against Turkey if
it allows the overflights.
House repudiates decontrol plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's plan to
remove price controls from domestic oil was
overwhelmingly repudiated by House Democrats
yesterday while Republicans demanded a better
accounting of current fuel shortages
The developments came amid what appears to
be rising congressional hostility toward the oil
industry—not just from liberals but from big oil's
traditional allies in both the House and Senate.
Expressing frustration over rising prices and
tight supplies, House Democrats approved, 138 to
69, a resolution repudiating Carter's plan to begin
lifting price controls on domestic oil June 1.
The vote, formalizing a voice vote taken the day
before, has no legal force. But it clearly added
momentum to the drive to block the president's
plan to remove price controls from oil.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill openly broke
with the president and supported the resolution.
But he later told reporters that despite Thursday's
vote, there's "no chance" that Carter will change
his mind and leave price controls on oil. I.
At the White House, Carter press secretary Jody
Powell said the Democrats' action is "clearly not in
the best interests of our country" and indicates a
failure to face up to tough problems.
United machinists ratify contract
Burlingame— Members of the Machinists
union have ratified a new contract with United
Airlines by a 3-1 margin, ending a 55-day strike
against the nation's largest domestic air line, the
union announced yesterday. United said it will
resume partial service Monday.
Union officials said the vote represented over
whelming approval by a large turnout of the un
ion's 18,600 members. The announcement of the
ratification was made by Louis Schroeder, presi
dent and general manager of District 141 of the
International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers.
Mardy Leaver, a United spokesman, said earlier
in the day that the airline's 1600 daily flights would
be back in full service a week or so after the
Memorial Day holiday.
United said it was "planning" on resuming par
tial service Monday.
Earlier in the day, the union reported the 7200-
member San Francisco local of the striking Inter
national Association of Machinists and Aerospace

Workers—the largest of the struck units—voted
for the three-year pact.
Thatcher names ambassadors
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
picked two titled and experienced career dip
lomats to represent Britain in Washington and at
the United Nations in New York.
Sir Nicholas Henderson, who was plucked from
retirement to be the new ambassador to the Un
ited States, has impeccable credentials combined
with a reputation for fun-loving eccentricity.
Sir Anthony Parsons, named ambassador to the
United Nations, was the center of some con
troversy in January when he was recalled as Bri
tain's representative in Tehran in the midst of the
Iranian revolution.
Observers said the appointments conform with
the Conservative government practice of appoint
ing career diplomats to the posts in America while
Labor governments usually name politicians.
"It was a surprise, but in the course of a long
career, one is used to the ups and downs of the
roller coaster of the foreign service," he told re
porters after his appointment Tuesday.
He replaces Ambassador Peter Jay, son-in-law of
ex-Prime Minister James Callaghan, who had
served in Washington since 1977. Thatcher had
offered the post to her Conservative party rival
Edward Heath, but the former prime minister
turned it down.
Murderer to be executed today
Starke, Fla. — Condemned murderer John A.
Spenkelink will be executed at 10 a.m. Friday,
gubernatorial aide Steve Hull said early today.
Hull said the decision on the time of execution
was made by prison Supt. David Brierton after a
three-judge federal appeals court in New Orleans
cleared the way for Spenkelink to die in the elec
tric chair.
Hull, press secretary to Gov. Bob Graham, said
Brierton informed the governor at about 12:35
a.m. today that he had set the execution time.
The new execution time was set only about an
hour after the U.S. sth Circuit Court of Appeals
swept aside the only judicial barrier to 30-year-old
Spenkelink's electrocution.
The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling—
which takes effect at 9:30 a.m. today (EST) struck
down a late-night stay issued Tuesday by U.S. Dis
trict Judge Elbert Parr Tuttle of Atlanta.
Tuttle's order was one of two that halted Spen
kelink's scheduled execution at 7 a.m. Wednes
day. The other stay was issued by U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, but it was dis
solved by the full Supreme Court.
The appeals panel ruling came in response to a
petition filed by Florida's attorney general, who
vowed Spenkelink would die before the death
warrant signed by Graham expired at noon today.

talks with Turkey aimed at winning clearance for
U-2 spy flights over that country.
The diplomatic maneuvering will have major re
percussions on the success of next month's sum
mit meeting and the fate of the SALT II treaty. The
flights over Turkey by American spy planes would
help U.S. intelligence make up for the loss of two
Iranian stations which monitored Soviet missile
tests.
The administration's success may be critical in
the Senate debate over ratification of the pact.
Influential critics like Sen. John Clenn (D-Ohio)
are saying the treaty will not be verifiable unless
the administration makes up for the loss of the
Iranian monitoring posts.
Informed sources, declining to be identified
publicly, say that sometime between now and
mid-June, when the summit is scheduled, the Un
ited States hopes to gain tacit Soviet acquiescence
for the flights.
That is the price that Turkish Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit has demanded before he will con

sider allowing the reconnaisance planes to use
Turkish airspace.
Exactly what form of Soviet acquiescence Ecevit
might demand is unclear.
Some sources say he will settle for a private
assurance, relayed by the United States from the
Soviets, that they will not retaliate against Turkey if
it allows the overflights.
House repudiates decontrol plan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's plan to
remove price controls from domestic oil was
overwhelmingly repudiated by House Democrats
yesterday while Republicans demanded a better
accounting of current fuel shortages
The developments came amid what appears to
be rising congressional hostility toward the oil
industry—not just from liberals but from big oil's
traditional allies in both the House and Senate.
Expressing frustration over rising prices and
tight supplies, House Democrats approved, 138 to
69, a resolution repudiating Carter's plan to begin
lifting price controls on domestic oil June 1.
The vote, formalizing a voice vote taken the day
before, has no legal force. But it clearly added
momentum to the drive to block the president's
plan to remove price controls from oil.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill openly broke
with the president and supported the resolution.
But he later told reporters that despite Thursday's
vote, there's "no chance" that Carter will change
his mind and leave price controls on oil. I.
At the White House, Carter press secretary Jody
Powell said the Democrats' action is "clearly not in
the best interests of our country" and indicates a
failure to face up to tough problems.
United machinists ratify contract
Burlingame— Members of the Machinists
union have ratified a new contract with United
Airlines by a 3-1 margin, ending a 55-day strike
against the nation's largest domestic air line, the
union announced yesterday. United said it will
resume partial service Monday.
Union officials said the vote represented over
whelming approval by a large turnout of the un
ion's 18,600 members. The announcement of the
ratification was made by Louis Schroeder, presi
dent and general manager of District 141 of the
International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers.
Mardy Leaver, a United spokesman, said earlier
in the day that the airline's 1600 daily flights would
be back in full service a week or so after the
Memorial Day holiday.
United said it was "planning" on resuming par
tial service Monday.
Earlier in the day, the union reported the 7200-
member San Francisco local of the striking Inter
national Association of Machinists and Aerospace

Workers—the largest of the struck units—voted
for the three-year pact.
Thatcher names ambassadors
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
picked two titled and experienced career dip
lomats to represent Britain in Washington and at
the United Nations in New York.
Sir Nicholas Henderson, who was plucked from
retirement to be the new ambassador to the Un
ited States, has impeccable credentials combined
with a reputation for fun-loving eccentricity.
Sir Anthony Parsons, named ambassador to the
United Nations, was the center of some con
troversy in January when he was recalled as Bri
tain's representative in Tehran in the midst of the
Iranian revolution.
Observers said the appointments conform with
the Conservative government practice of appoint
ing career diplomats to the posts in America while
Labor governments usually name politicians.
"It was a surprise, but in the course of a long
career, one is used to the ups and downs of the
roller coaster of the foreign service," he told re
porters after his appointment Tuesday.
He replaces Ambassador Peter Jay, son-in-law of
ex-Prime Minister James Callaghan, who had
served in Washington since 1977. Thatcher had
offered the post to her Conservative party rival
Edward Heath, but the former prime minister
turned it down.
Murderer to be executed today
Starke, Fla. — Condemned murderer John A.
Spenkelink will be executed at 10 a.m. Friday,
gubernatorial aide Steve Hull said early today.
Hull said the decision on the time of execution
was made by prison Supt. David Brierton after a
three-judge federal appeals court in New Orleans
cleared the way for Spenkelink to die in the elec
tric chair.
Hull, press secretary to Gov. Bob Graham, said
Brierton informed the governor at about 12:35
a.m. today that he had set the execution time.
The new execution time was set only about an
hour after the U.S. sth Circuit Court of Appeals
swept aside the only judicial barrier to 30-year-old
Spenkelink's electrocution.
The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling—
which takes effect at 9:30 a.m. today (EST) struck
down a late-night stay issued Tuesday by U.S. Dis
trict Judge Elbert Parr Tuttle of Atlanta.
Tuttle's order was one of two that halted Spen
kelink's scheduled execution at 7 a.m. Wednes
day. The other stay was issued by U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, but it was dis
solved by the full Supreme Court.
The appeals panel ruling came in response to a
petition filed by Florida's attorney general, who
vowed Spenkelink would die before the death
warrant signed by Graham expired at noon today.
Israel attacks Lebanese bases
Israeli warplanes strafed and bombed mountain
and coastal Palestinian bases deep inside Lebanon
for the second straight day yesterday, hours after
Palestinians shelled a northern Israeli border area.
Lebanese authorities claimed the raids caused
high civilian casualties.
Farther to the south, near El Arish, capital of the
occupied Sinai, defiant Jewish settlers who had
resisted eviction by throwing stones and vegeta
bles at Israeli soldiers, finally relented and gave up
their 10-acre farm so the area could be turned over
to Eygpt today.
In Jerusalem, a man was slightly injured when a
small bomb exploded in a suburban supermarket,
police said, but little damage was reported.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance arrived in Cairo
and immediately left by helicopter to meet in
Alexandria with President Anwar Sadat. On Sun
day the two are to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin in Beersheba, Israel, to begin
talks on Palestinian autonomy in occupied areas.
The military command in Tel Aviv announced
the aerial attack on "terrorist concentrations"
hours after a man and a woman were slightly in
jured when barrages of shells fell on northern
Israel. The command said without elaboration that
the artillery fire was returned.
Israeli military officials would not specify which
sites were hit in the mid-morning air raid, but
reports from Beirut said Israeli planes bombed
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla targets
in the Reihan mountains, 40 miles southeast of
Beirut.

industry—not just from liberals but from big oil's
traditional allies in both the House and Senate.
Expressing frustration over rising prices and
tight supplies, House Democrats approved, 138 to
69, a resolution repudiating Carter's plan to begin
lifting price controls on domestic oil June 1.
The vote, formalizing a voice vote taken the day
before, has no legal force. But it clearly added
momentum to the drive to block the president's
plan to remove price controls from oil.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill openly broke
with the president and supported the resolution.
But he later told reporters that despite Thursday's
vote, there's "no chance" that Carter will change
his mind and leave price controls on oil. I.
At the White House, Carter press secretary Jody
Powell said the Democrats' action is "clearly not in
the best interests of our country" and indicates a
failure to face up to tough problems.
United machinists ratify contract
Burlingame— Members of the Machinists
union have ratified a new contract with United
Airlines by a 3-1 margin, ending a 55-day strike
against the nation's largest domestic air line, the
union announced yesterday. United said it will
resume partial service Monday.
Union officials said the vote represented over
whelming approval by a large turnout of the un
ion's 18,600 members. The announcement of the
ratification was made by Louis Schroeder, presi
dent and general manager of District 141 of the
International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers.
Mardy Leaver, a United spokesman, said earlier
in the day that the airline's 1600 daily flights would
be back in full service a week or so after the
Memorial Day holiday.
United said it was "planning" on resuming par
tial service Monday.
Earlier in the day, the union reported the 7200-
member San Francisco local of the striking Inter
national Association of Machinists and Aerospace

Workers—the largest of the struck units—voted
for the three-year pact.
Thatcher names ambassadors
London — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has
picked two titled and experienced career dip
lomats to represent Britain in Washington and at
the United Nations in New York.
Sir Nicholas Henderson, who was plucked from
retirement to be the new ambassador to the Un
ited States, has impeccable credentials combined
with a reputation for fun-loving eccentricity.
Sir Anthony Parsons, named ambassador to the
United Nations, was the center of some con
troversy in January when he was recalled as Bri
tain's representative in Tehran in the midst of the
Iranian revolution.
Observers said the appointments conform with
the Conservative government practice of appoint
ing career diplomats to the posts in America while
Labor governments usually name politicians.
"It was a surprise, but in the course of a long
career, one is used to the ups and downs of the
roller coaster of the foreign service," he told re
porters after his appointment Tuesday.
He replaces Ambassador Peter Jay, son-in-law of
ex-Prime Minister James Callaghan, who had
served in Washington since 1977. Thatcher had
offered the post to her Conservative party rival
Edward Heath, but the former prime minister
turned it down.
Murderer to be executed today
Starke, Fla. — Condemned murderer John A.
Spenkelink will be executed at 10 a.m. Friday,
gubernatorial aide Steve Hull said early today.
Hull said the decision on the time of execution
was made by prison Supt. David Brierton after a
three-judge federal appeals court in New Orleans
cleared the way for Spenkelink to die in the elec
tric chair.
Hull, press secretary to Gov. Bob Graham, said
Brierton informed the governor at about 12:35
a.m. today that he had set the execution time.
The new execution time was set only about an
hour after the U.S. sth Circuit Court of Appeals
swept aside the only judicial barrier to 30-year-old
Spenkelink's electrocution.
The three-judge panel's unanimous ruling—
which takes effect at 9:30 a.m. today (EST) struck
down a late-night stay issued Tuesday by U.S. Dis
trict Judge Elbert Parr Tuttle of Atlanta.
Tuttle's order was one of two that halted Spen
kelink's scheduled execution at 7 a.m. Wednes
day. The other stay was issued by U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, but it was dis
solved by the full Supreme Court.
The appeals panel ruling came in response to a
petition filed by Florida's attorney general, who
vowed Spenkelink would die before the death
warrant signed by Graham expired at noon today.
