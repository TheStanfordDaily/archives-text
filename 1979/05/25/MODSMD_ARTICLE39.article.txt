# Panel examines social aspects of energy use

### Laura Erickson 
The United States must realize that
any energy decision it makes will
greatly affect society, according to
three specialists at a forum on social
and political aspects of energy use.
Charles Ryan, University engineer
ing professor; Mark Reader, Arizona
State University political science pro
fessor; and Willis Harman, director
of the Center for the Study of Re
search Policy here, spoke in Skilling
Auditorium Wednesday.
"The structure of the social system
controls the energy flow and the
energy flow reflects the structure of
the social system," Ryan said.
Energy availability has influenced
man's evolution, he added, noting
that primitive man's invention of ag
riculture increased the amount of
energy he could control and made
him more sedentary. Cities and the
intellectual life emerged as a result.
Reader, speaking against nuclear
energy, said he did "not believe we
can live with the fissioned atom for
very much longer without losing life,
liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness."
One problem that concerned
Reader was the proliferation of nuc
lear weapons accompanying that of
nuclear power. He warned that the
nuclear cycle may have to be

watched so carefully that Americans
would lose their freedom. "How can
one maintain freedom with a system
that requires total social control?"
The nuclear power cycle creates
social hierarchies and inequality
among nations, Reader added. He
also was worried about the problem
of radioactive waste and was distres
sed by the values that would be re
quired for man to live with nuclear
energy.
Harman said changes in values and
attitudes would make the difference
in the amount of energy people con
sumed. A study which he and others
carried out, predicted California's
energy use over the next 75 years.
One scenario portrayed an increase
in energy consumption, while in
another the per capita energy con
sumption had been cut in half.
In the latter picture, Californians
still maintained a high standard of
living. "They would just spend more
time cleaning up after themselves,"
he said, adding that changes which
cut the energy use in half were
minor, mainly reflecting a change in
attitudes.
The forum was sponsored by the
Democratic Socialist Organizing
Committee.
