Despite the urgingof U.S. Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa, Hoover Institution senior
research fellow Edward Teller has
decided not to seek the 1980 Repub
lican Senate nomination.
He would have been campaigning
for the California seat held by Demo
crat Alan Cranston.
Teller, a Nobel physicist, decided
not to run partly because he suffered
an apparent heart attack May 9,
Hayakawa explained last week.
In an interview, the senator said
Teller has been hospitalized in

"good condition" and is undergoing
tests.
He is expected to return home to
day, his secretary said.
Teller, 71, is known as "Father of
the H-bomb," and is one of four
California academics whom
Hayakawa has tried to recruit to run
against Cranston.
"Why am I doing it? This is some
thing out of respect for Senator
Cranston, whom I think is a very skill
ful politician," Hayakawa said.
Teller could not be reached for
comment.
