# Senate defers Nom Com vote, debates nominations procedure
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate hastily voted on several provisions
during the 30 minutes that it managed to keep the 11
senators necessary for a quorum last night.
The senate was forced to adjourn before acting on
Nominations Committee recommendations for Univer
sity committee student appointments. COP members
Tom Cart and Sibby Freeman had urged the senators to
approve that list to allow its scheduled presentation to
the administration and the Board of Trustees May 31.
In its longest debate of the evening, the senate discus
sed the merits of investigating the qualifications of
nominated students before voting. A motion to table the
measure failed as the missing quorum was discovered
immediately.
The senate certified the BASH slate as the winner in
the Senior Class president election, by approving a sup
plemental report submitted by Assistant Elections
Commissioner Chris Noonan.
Summary approved
In a traditional move, the senate approved the year
end financial summary of Financial Manager Bill Lape, in
which he said the ASSU should break even in the aggre
gate by Aug. 31. The senators also approved his choices

for next year's student project managers and assistant
financial managers.
A $200 bonus for exceptional work was granted to
outgoing Flicks director Jay Roach, as were bonuses of
$150 apiece to Recycling Center directors Lisa Joyce and
Jeff Ryan and Lecture Notes manager Bruce Bendix.
The senate commended Consumer Affairs Committee
director Tom Virden on an active first year and voted to
spend up to $100 from the consumer affairs fund to
finance the printing of a campus map denoting lighted
corridors, bike paths and call boxes.
Virden reported that "unless something drastic hap
pens this summer," mail will be delivered to all dorms
beginning autumn quarter.
Final action was taken on the Academic Organizations
Board's detailed allocations for autumn quarter.
Left in cold
The senate was dismissed before it could consider
guest professorship recommendations and a $25 dona
tion to the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade for
a "Rock 'n' Revolt" concert.
Sen. Brett Kingstone's resolution for the University to
establish and sponsor a public speaking and debate
program for the entire student body also was left in the
cold.
