# Baby formula manufacturers defend marketing policies

### Nancy Koehn 
Bristol-Myers Co. and American Home Products
Corp. officials have defended their infant formula mar
keting practices in separate letters to the University.
These letters came in response to University letters
sent April 16 expressing concern over company market
ing and distribution techniques in developing countries.
The University has consistently written letters of re
commendation and criticism to companies and corpora
tions in which it owns stock when it acts on various
shareholder resolutions.
In a letter dated May 11, Frank Sprole, vice-chairman
of the board of directors for Bristol-Myers, wrote, "We
object in stronger terms to your questioning of our stan
dard of responsibility."
Addressed to Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president for
public affairs here, Sproles' letter acknowledged the
company's receipt of the April 16 letter from William
Eberle, chairman of the University Board of Trustees
Select Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR).
The University, which owns 1700 shares of Bristol-
Myers stock, abstained from voting on a shareholder
resolution that the company cease all distribution of free
samples of infant formula.
The committee letter to Bristol-Myers said, "The re
cord, including the company's own responses, shows
misleading market practices, instances of label direc
tions in a language not spoken in the country of sale and
other practices that increase the likelihood of unsafe use
of the company's product."
Sprole replied to the SCIR allegation that Bristol-
Myers' formula directions are not printed in a language
spoken in the country of sale by explaining company
practices in Haiti. He said that company formula direc
tions are not printed in Creole, the native language,
because it would be impractical to do so.
According to Sprole, "There are practically no in
stances where labels for any product are printed in
Creole." He added that Creole is rarely found in written
form.
The Bristol-Myers official did not discuss company
practices in any other country.
Sprole also did not address the other SCIR complaints
— that Bristol-Myers was giving misleading marketing
practices and practices increasing the probability of un
safe use of Bristol-Myers' formula.
He noted, "The problems of infant nutrition and
health in the Third World are not simple nor are the
solutions to them." He explained that "Bristol-Myers
recognizes and accepts a responsibility for sharing in
efforts to improve infant nutrition."
Sprole also criticized the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC), a Washington-based organization
established by the University and other institutions in

1970 to gather and correlate information on shareholder
resolutions.
He said, "It was disturbing to us (Bristol-Myers) that
your committee (SCIR) had relied principally on the re
port of the Investor Responsibility Research Center,
Inc., in reaching its determination concerning the issue.
It is our impression that the overall presentation of that
group decidedly favored the (shareholders) propo
nents' position."
The University Commission on Investment Responsi
bility (CIR), a group of students, faculty, alumni and staff
which advises the SCIR on shareholder resolutions, fre
quently utilizes IRRC information in making its recom
mendations, according to Fred Hillier, chairman of CIR
and a professor of operations research here.
In a May 3 letter to Rosenzweig, Carol Emerling, cor
porate secretary for American Home Products Corp.,
defended company marketing methods in developing
countries, saying "We (the corporation) have taken sev
eral steps in the past few years to try to assure proper use
of products."
Emerling's letter came in response to a SCIR letter,
drafted April 16, expressing concern over corporate
marketing and labeling techniques of infant formula.
For two years, the SCIR has supported shareholder
proposals calling on American Home Products to estab
lish a committee to review marketing and distribution of
infant formulas.
According to Emerling, the company "is changing all
of (its) foreign labeling to make clear (its) long-standing
company policy that supports breast feeding as being
the best nutrient for infants."
She added, "The pictorial instructions on the infant
formula cans are being clarified and local languages
have been widely used in the written instructions."
She denied that infant formula use is harmful, saying,
"We have continued to review the accusations made
against us by those who have been promoting the view
that infant formula use is necessarily harmful. We have
found that the facts contradict a great many of these
charges."
She stated, "As for our infant formula products, let me
say that no one has questioned their excellent nutri
tional quality. I believe they are generally regarded as
being a nutrient very close to mother's milk."
William Massy, University vice-president of finance
and a steady attendant of SCIR meetings, had little
comment on the company letters.
He noted that the company replies "don't change the
fact that we (SCIR) are glad we wrote to them (the com
paniesj."
He added that "it's not uncommon for management to
disagree with what our (SCIR) letters say." Massy indi
cated that SCIR would continue to write letters of re
commendation and concern to company management.

quently utilizes IRRC information in making its recom

In a May 3 letter to Rosenzweig, Carol Emerling, cor
porate secretary for American Home Products Corp.,
defended company marketing methods in developing
countries, saying "We (the corporation) have taken sev
eral steps in the past few years to try to assure proper use
of products."
Emerling's letter came in response to a SCIR letter,
drafted April 16, expressing concern over corporate
marketing and labeling techniques of infant formula.
For two years, the SCIR has supported shareholder
proposals calling on American Home Products to estab
lish a committee to review marketing and distribution of
infant formulas.
According to Emerling, the company "is changing all
of (its) foreign labeling to make clear (its) long-standing
company policy that supports breast feeding as being
the best nutrient for infants."
She added, "The pictorial instructions on the infant
formula cans are being clarified and local languages
have been widely used in the written instructions."
She denied that infant formula use is harmful, saying,
"We have continued to review the accusations made
against us by those who have been promoting the view
that infant formula use is necessarily harmful. We have
found that the facts contradict a great many of these
charges."
She stated, "As for our infant formula products, let me
say that no one has questioned their excellent nutri
tional quality. I believe they are generally regarded as
being a nutrient very close to mother's milk."
William Massy, University vice-president of finance
and a steady attendant of SCIR meetings, had little
comment on the company letters.
He noted that the company replies "don't change the
fact that we (SCIR) are glad we wrote to them (the com
paniesj."
He added that "it's not uncommon for management to
disagree with what our (SCIR) letters say." Massy indi
cated that SCIR would continue to write letters of re
commendation and concern to company management.
Bristol-Myers Co. and American Home Products
Corp. officials have defended their infant formula mar
keting practices in separate letters to the University.
These letters came in response to University letters
sent April 16 expressing concern over company market
ing and distribution techniques in developing countries.
The University has consistently written letters of re
commendation and criticism to companies and corpora
tions in which it owns stock when it acts on various
shareholder resolutions.
In a letter dated May 11, Frank Sprole, vice-chairman
of the board of directors for Bristol-Myers, wrote, "We
object in stronger terms to your questioning of our stan
dard of responsibility."
Addressed to Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president for
public affairs here, Sproles' letter acknowledged the
company's receipt of the April 16 letter from William
Eberle, chairman of the University Board of Trustees
Select Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR).
The University, which owns 1700 shares of Bristol-
Myers stock, abstained from voting on a shareholder
resolution that the company cease all distribution of free
samples of infant formula.
The committee letter to Bristol-Myers said, "The re
cord, including the company's own responses, shows
misleading market practices, instances of label direc
tions in a language not spoken in the country of sale and
other practices that increase the likelihood of unsafe use
of the company's product."
Sprole replied to the SCIR allegation that Bristol-
Myers' formula directions are not printed in a language
spoken in the country of sale by explaining company
practices in Haiti. He said that company formula direc
tions are not printed in Creole, the native language,
because it would be impractical to do so.
According to Sprole, "There are practically no in
stances where labels for any product are printed in
Creole." He added that Creole is rarely found in written
form.
The Bristol-Myers official did not discuss company
practices in any other country.
Sprole also did not address the other SCIR complaints
— that Bristol-Myers was giving misleading marketing
practices and practices increasing the probability of un
safe use of Bristol-Myers' formula.
He noted, "The problems of infant nutrition and
health in the Third World are not simple nor are the
solutions to them." He explained that "Bristol-Myers
recognizes and accepts a responsibility for sharing in
efforts to improve infant nutrition."
Sprole also criticized the Investor Responsibility Re
search Center (IRRC), a Washington-based organization
established by the University and other institutions in

1970 to gather and correlate information on shareholder
resolutions.
He said, "It was disturbing to us (Bristol-Myers) that
your committee (SCIR) had relied principally on the re
port of the Investor Responsibility Research Center,
Inc., in reaching its determination concerning the issue.
It is our impression that the overall presentation of that
group decidedly favored the (shareholders) propo
nents' position."
