# Profs help steer Voyager through space with radar

Two professors here are among a team of scientists
that is using radiowaves to lead NASA's Voyager mission
to Jupiter and the outer planets.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Von Eshleman, the team
leader, said the two Voyager spacecraft emit radiowaves
which are tracked by stations from Spain to Australia,
using radar antennae similar to that of the Stanford Dish.
He said the University facility's only involvement with
the project was "to run a test (last fall) with Voyager II to
determine if an alternative communication technique
would work." NASA requested the test, which proved
successful, because the satellite's standard communica
tion system had malfunctioned.
Scheduled stops
The first Voyager craft passed Jupiter in March and will
reach Saturn in 1980. The other craft should fly by Jupiter
in July before continuing on to Uranus and Neptune.
According to Eshleman, the first craft discovered sul
phur, oxygen and other matter in the usually empty
"torus" of 10, a Jupiter moon. A torus is an orbiting
body's path around its mother planet.
Eshleman said that 10, the solar system's most volcani
cally active body, is the source of this debris and that
scientists detected it through changes in radiowave fre
quency and amplitude.
The path of the wave stream between each craft and an

earthbound tracking station form a link, Eshleman said.
This link might be compared to a long, knotted string
that connects a person to a kite he is flying. Each regu
larly spaced knot represents a wavelength, Eshleman
said, and if the kite flyer loosens his grip, he could count
the knots as the string slipped through his fingers.
Eshleman said that scientists count wavelengths as
they are transmitted by the spacecraft, rating their size
and frequency.
Benefits seen
Undergraduate and graduate students have benefit
ted from the Voyager project, even though the Dish is
not involved. Eshleman said that three students are help
ing him and Dr. Len Tyler (the other Stanford team
member) plan and analyze the radio experiments for
NASA.
He explained that past research involving the Dish has
"led groups here into a number of different areas,"
including outer-planetary exploration.
In the 19605, the Dish was used as a tracking station for
the Pioneer mission, which laid the groundwork for
Voyager. Pioneer explored and measured the density,
velocity and turbulence of solar phenomena using
radiowave emitting craft, Eshleman said.
