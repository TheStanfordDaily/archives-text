Class List Sign-Up
Autumn Quarter 1979-80
There will not be Advance Registration in Spring
Quarter for Autumn Quarter 1979-80. Instead there
will be a Class List Sign-Up for current students to
sign class lists for those courses requiring it. Courses
will be listed on Autumn Program Cards that will be
available at the "Autumn Program Cards" window
in the lobby of the Old Union beginning May 29.
Signing of Class Lists will begin May 29 according to
the schedule in the Time Schedule (available at the
I Information window in the lobby of the Old Union.)
Each student should bring his or her ID to get a
Program Card. No advisors' signatures will be
required on the Autumn Program Cards and only
courses that require signing class lists should be
shown. Students who do not need to sign class lists
should not fill out and turn in Autumn Program
Cards. The last day to pick up Program Cards is
June 5, but Class Lists can be signed through June 6.
The cards should be turned in at the Class List
windows by June 6 and will be returned to students
at Autumn Quarter Registration.
