# Middle East speakers differ on peace format
## 
### Karen Veninga 
A "comprehensive and conclu
sive" peace was advocated by all
three speakers at a debate on the
Middle East held at the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity Thursday night, but
beyond this, the three speakers dif
fered concerning what a just peace
would entail.
Michel Nabti, a Middle East
specialist and resident fellow at
Trancos, began the debate by com
menting on the current peace treaty
between Egypt and Israel. The treaty
clarifies Israeli and Egyptian posi
tions and minimizes the possibility of
war between Israel and the Arab
states, Nabti said.
But Nabti added he wonders how
long this treaty will be effective.
"You do not separate a country like
Egypt from a body (the Arab world),
which is a major organ of this body
and expect that body to function or
derly and in a balanced fashion."
The United States has never been
seen as a neutral party, but partisan
towards Israel and a major creator of
the Israeli state, Nabti said. At the
moment, there is a "volatile, fluid"
situation in the Middle East where
radical elements in the Arab states
are turning towards the Soviet Union
for leadership.
Moderate states angered
Some of the moderate states, such
as Saudi Arabia and Jordan are
angered by their exclusion from the
peace treaty negotiations, Nabti

explained. In the past few weeks
Saudi Arabia has been contemplating
establishing diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union.
Nabti said that if there is a peace
treaty it "should be a comprehen
sive, conclusive peace treaty in the
Arab world and the Middle East at
large with all parties concerned in
volved." The real problem in the
Middle East is the Palestinian prob
lem, he said.
Udi Miron, an Israeli graduate stu
dent in communication here disag
reed. Miron said that the conflict is
between the Arab countries and Is
rael. "The Palestinians got caught in
between," he explained.
"The Palestinians should turn
around, stop being puppets and de
mand cooperation from the Arab na
tions as well as Israel," he said. Israel
is afraid that the Arab world will be
used as "bait to hook Israel into a
difficult situation." According to Mi
ron, the Arabs use the Palestinians to
cause disorder along the borders.
Even if the Israelis decided to leave
Israel there would be no Palestinian
state. Syria, Jordan and Egypt would
dominate the Palestinians.
The Palestinians should demand
cooperation from the Arab states be
cause of the large numbers of Pales
tinians outside of Israel, Miron said.
For example, the Palestinians make
up 50 percent of the population of
Jordan.

Sami Suleiman, a Palestinian student at the Business School, and Michel Nabti, a
Middle East specialist at Hoover, were two of the participants last Thursday in a
debate on peace in the Middle East.
Miron praised Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's "peace initiative,"
when Sadat visited Jerusalem. Miron
described it as a "leading step toward
peace" and "a dream come true." He
said that Israel is ready for conces
sions and believes that the peace tre
aty is a step toward peace.
Israel has given up an area three
times larger than Israel by giving up
the Sinai, Miron said. He added that
"99 percent of the Israelis are ready
to make concessions of one kind or
another when the other side also
shows signs of changing their at
titudes and are ready to live with us in
one way or another."
Miron said he regards the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) as a
"Frankenstein" that "the Arab world
itself sometimes doesn't know how
to control." At one point a member
of the audience noted Israeli attacks
on the Palestinian refugee camps.
Miron then asked, "Why are you so
quiet about the terrorists? Why not
call Yassir Arafat a murderer?"
Sami Suleiman, a Palestinian cur
rently at the Business School here,
said that "we (the Palestinians) as a
people, deprived and oppressed,
have the right to use any means to
further what we want." Suleiman
said the PLO is the only organization
that represents the Palestinians. He
said he does not "value the life of a
Palestinian more than the life of an
Israeli" and said he does not con
done the killings by the PLO, but un
derstands the reasons for the ter
rorism.
A Palestinian, deprived of his own
land, government and identity takes

the position that "if my life is misera
ble, I'll make the life of the other
miserable."
Suleiman said that the Palestinians
live on the assumption that the lews
in Palestine have no right to be there
and that they (the Palestinians) will
make life on the borders so misera
ble that the Israelis will know that
they have taken Palestinian land.
Suleiman was born in Palestine
and said he considered it his country.
He asked, "It the Jews kept their
promise to go back to Palestine after
2000 years, why is it so strange for the
Palestinians to want their home back
after 30 years?"
The Egypt-Israeli peace treaty does

not treat Palestinian self
determination or their right to have a
government of their own, Suleiman
said. "For Sadat to get the Sinai and
sell out the West Bank and Gaza Strip
is not fair and not just." He added
that "any situation that does not take
the interests of each party in consid
eration is a short-range solution."
Suleiman said that "we (the Pales
tinians) aspire to be treated equally
and have an identity of our own . . .
self-determination in a state we can
call our own." He said that "if you
(the Israelis) don't want to live with
us, let us have a state for the Jorda
nians, a state for the Israelis and a
state for the Palestinians."
