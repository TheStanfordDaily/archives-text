# Middle East speakers differ on peace format
## 
### Karen Veninga 
A "comprehensive and conclu
sive" peace was advocated by all
three speakers at a debate on the
Middle East held at the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity Thursday night, but
beyond this, the three speakers dif
fered concerning what a just peace
would entail.
Michel Nabti, a Middle East
specialist and resident fellow at
Trancos, began the debate by com
menting on the current peace treaty
between Egypt and Israel. The treaty
clarifies Israeli and Egyptian posi
tions and minimizes the possibility of
war between Israel and the Arab
states, Nabti said.
But Nabti added he wonders how
long this treaty will be effective.
"You do not separate a country like
Egypt from a body (the Arab world),
which is a major organ of this body
and expect that body to function or
derly and in a balanced fashion."
The United States has never been
seen as a neutral party, but partisan
towards Israel and a major creator of
the Israeli state, Nabti said. At the
moment, there is a "volatile, fluid"
situation in the Middle East where
radical elements in the Arab states
are turning towards the Soviet Union
for leadership.
Moderate states angered
Some of the moderate states, such
as Saudi Arabia and Jordan are
angered by their exclusion from the
peace treaty negotiations, Nabti

explained. In the past few weeks
Saudi Arabia has been contemplating
establishing diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union.
Nabti said that if there is a peace
treaty it "should be a comprehen
sive, conclusive peace treaty in the
Arab world and the Middle East at
large with all parties concerned in
volved." The real problem in the
Middle East is the Palestinian prob
lem, he said.
Udi Miron, an Israeli graduate stu
dent in communication here disag
reed. Miron said that the conflict is
between the Arab countries and Is
rael. "The Palestinians got caught in
between," he explained.
"The Palestinians should turn
around, stop being puppets and de
mand cooperation from the Arab na
tions as well as Israel," he said. Israel
is afraid that the Arab world will be
used as "bait to hook Israel into a
difficult situation." According to Mi
ron, the Arabs use the Palestinians to
cause disorder along the borders.
Even if the Israelis decided to leave
Israel there would be no Palestinian
state. Syria, Jordan and Egypt would
dominate the Palestinians.
The Palestinians should demand
cooperation from the Arab states be
cause of the large numbers of Pales
tinians outside of Israel, Miron said.
For example, the Palestinians make
up 50 percent of the population of
Jordan.
