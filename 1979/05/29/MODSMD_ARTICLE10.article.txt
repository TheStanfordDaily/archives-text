# THE
						STAN FORD DAILY OPINIONS
## John Paval University proceedings fair 
### 
Contrary to Lise Giraud's opinion (Daily, May
22 and May 23), former Stanford Prof. Bruce
Franklin should not be considered a martyr.
Giraud argued that the University's case is
"tinged with enough injustice, hypocrisy, ven
gefulness and waste to leave an indelible stain."
The fault, though, would seem to lie more in the
posturing and rhetoric of the critics than in the
University's position.
Rhetoric aside, let the following be clear:
Franklin was not fired forexpressinghis political
views. Numerous faculty members here openly
opposed the Vietnam War without suffering his
fate.
Stanford took pains to give Franklin special
consideration and a fair hearing. Rather than
pressing any action in the courts, the University
followed the mannerly procedure of an
academic review board and tried to adhere care
fully to "due process" in that context.
The Advisory Board recommended removing
Franklin only after consideration, argument and
deliberation. I am told the vote on the board was
divided in the end, hardly the stuff of kangaroo
courts or "hanging judges."
Giraud maintains that the former professor
"never once committed a violent act" against
any person. But in fact,he contributed to vio
lence which affected (and was intended to af
fect) the whole community. Eyewitness reports
indicated he more or less helped to incite a riot.
University not plaintiff
Giraud calls the University "vengeful," as if
Stanford were the plaintiff in the ongoing court
case. While Franklin presses the case, the Uni
versity is simply defending the earlier decision
of Franklin's former chosen colleagues.
We are told the University's defense is a
"waste" of time, energy and money. But when a
principle is tried in the courts (as, for instance,
in the Daily's recent Supreme Court fight) the
issues transcend the expense.
What are the limits for the involvement of
professors in mass action which results in the
destruction of University property, or anyone's
property? What is the distinction between free
dom of expression and outright, illegal action?
Where does the University's identity and exis

tence end, and where does the faculty
members' own personal freedom meet it?
Not paltry issues
These are not paltry issues. We can hardly
afford not to work through them now, while not
beset by confusing events. Heaven knows the
University did not seek out the opportunity to
remove Franklin. In the midst of great stress and
unrest, a careful and thoughtful procedure was
followed.
Regardless of one's feelings about the deci
sion, the concern for due process and fairness in
that situation is a credit to the University. Under
any circumstances, we should hope that Stan
ford can continue to stand for that approach to
conflict.
The bitterness of the latest criticism is shock
ing. Venom must be in endless supply when
friends of the University (Trustees Morris Doyle
and Robert Brown) are to be attacked for help
ing out in its defense. Lacking substantial criti
cism, Ciraud resorted to innuendo, implied
slurs about personal profiteering.
Facts aside
All facts aside (and they seem to be cast aside
by the critics), were the University being de
fended by complete outsiders, no doubt other
baseless innuendos could be fashioned. Let's
face it, these are low blows.
The courts may find that the University's pro
ceedings in the Franklin matter ended in error. If
so, the University will have to do some re
thinking about the issues involved. Should the
court decide in Stanford's favor, however, I
wonder from the tone of recent criticism
whether there will be equivalent re-thinking
from the other point of view.
In any event, the record will show an
evenhanded and careful disposition throughout
the matter on the University's side, a far cry from
the character slurs, innuendo and irrelevancies
that some would use to distort the record. Diat
ribes such as we have been reading do not serve
to clear the air; they poison the atmosphere of
discourse.
