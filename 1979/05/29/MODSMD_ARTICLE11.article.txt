## Iranian revolution loses direction 
### 
Few events hold the poten
tial to alter world history as the
ongoing drama in Iran.
Following the overthrow of
the hated shah and the estab
lishment of the Islamic Repub
lic, the eyes of the world have
been transfixed on that part of
the globe. Iran is an important
country. First, it is one of the
world's leading oil producers.
Second, it could figure promi
nently in the power struggle in
an exceedingly sensitive area.
Last and more important, the
Iranian experience, from op
pression to freedom, trans

cends the boundaries of the
country.
A revolution of this mag
nitude inevitably experiences
growing pains. Following the
fervor of belligerence, jubila
tion of victory and vengeance
toward foes, the stark realities
of running a country invariably
ensue.
Iran wandering
It is the subsequent estab
lishment of the institutions and
norms of government that can
distinguish radical political
changes. Yet Iran is still
helplessly wandering to find it

self.
Nobody can deny the impor
tance of the religious infras
tructure in the success of the
Iranian movement. Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and his fol
lowers played a protagonist's
role throughout the revolu
tion.
Yet the ayatollah has ex
pended his utility. He is
hopelessly stuck to an anac
hronistic ideology according to
which everything can emanate
and be interpreted through the
Koran. He proposes a iconoc
lastic theocracy. He is largely
unaware that both Iran and the
rest of the world have surpas
sed the age of "Cod's state."
Revolution marred
The ayatollah's attitudes to
ward women, and freedom of
speech, his defensiveness and
abhorrence of criticism, mar
the scope of the revolution.
His attitude towards
"Zionism" leaves people be
mused. Not'all critics of his re
gime are Jews or agents of Is
raeli propaganda.
His edict that "the press
must print only what the
people want" (read "what the
ayatollah wants") poses a seri
ous threat towards freedom of
the press and no less infringe
ment and censorship than the
shah practiced. Ayandegan,
Teheran's leading daily news

paper, stopped publishing in
protest.
The trials and executions, al
though probably befitting in
most cases, did not improve
the ayatollah's image. Few
people inside or outside Iran
would claim that the right to
counsel or appeal are products
of Western degeneration.
Prospects sad
If Khomeini is the best that
can be produced out of such
monumental struggle as the
Iranian movement, it is a sad
prospects for many who strive
for national liberation. People
in countries such as Chile,
Pakistan, Nicaragua and Saudi
Arabia are anxiously watching
the developments in Iran. They
must be disappointed.
The Iranian revolution does
not belong only to the Iranian
people. Instead it is an event
that has international reper
cussions. This is why many of
us who supported the Iranian
uprising and applauded the
overthrow of the shah are now
grieved at the sorry state of af
fairs in that country.
Too many things are at stake
and it would be unfortunate if
they were left in the hands of a
man such as Ayatollah Kho
meini.
