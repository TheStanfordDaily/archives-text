# Uses relaxation and visualization
## LaVelle walks across bed of glass 
### Debbie Walker 
"One . . . Two . . . Three."
On the count of three, Steve
LaVelle lowered his fist onto
the triggering mechanism, and
the two steel sides of the trap
snapped onto the upper part of
his hand with force that could
break the leg of anyone who
stepped on such a trap.
He smiled and walked about
the room talking casually as on
lookers watched the steel
bands biting into his flesh.
"Right now I'm pretending
that my arm is made of cold,
rolled steel," LaVelle said in an
unstrained voice. "The two
sides of this trap are feather pil
lows. Actually, I feel pressure,
but I am experiencing no
pain."
When two men finally re
moved the clamps from LaVel
le's hand by applying their full
body weight on either side of
the trap, both sides of his hand
had deep indentations. But,
there was no visible bleeding
and he moved his hand with
ease.
LaVelle performed a series of
stunts Wednesday at KZSU as
he demonstrated pain and
thought control and powers
which he himself cannot exp
lain.
No trances
The performer was quick to
distinguish his acts from those
of a hypnotist or magician, say
ing that he does not employ
trances or slight of hand. He
claimed a magician would
never allow his audience to ob
serve him at such close range.
He did everything he could to
assure his audience that no
tricks were being played.
Surrounded by a small group
that kept within inches of him,
LaVelle let cotton balls
drenched in lamp oil burn on
his palm until the flesh was red.
He also walked across a bed of
jagged glass. To prove that he
was not using secret gimmicks,
he showed onlookers that his
feet were smooth and uncal
loused, and then proceeded to
step on any piece of glass
selected by the audience.
As he prepared to walk ac
ross the glass in his bare feet,
LaVelle said, "I'm not going to
see this glass when I walk ac
ross it. What I am going to see
is a cbld river bed with little
rocks at the bottom."
Uri Geller
Many have compared
LaVelle to Uri Geller because
of his mysterious abilities to
casually endure situations that
would bring others great pain
or injury. LaVelle, however,
thinks that most of his abilities
can be developed in everyone.
"Everyone can do these
things," LaVelle said. "They're
not supernatural; in fact,
they're very natural. They
come from being aware of the
fact that you're perfect."
LaVelle defined his
technique as a combination of
relaxation and visualization. A
hypnotist for five years, LaVelle
said he based his technique on
the belief that you can do any
thing awake that you can do
under hypnosis.
The former hypnotist said

that inhibitions are highly limit
ing and prevent most people
from realizing the full
capacities available to human
beings.
Thought control
He demonstrated one of
these capacities in the realm of
thought control. Five film jars,
four containing water and one
containing acid, were placed
behind LaVelle's back and a
KZSU disc jockey rearranged
them. LaVelle placed his finger
over each container and
watched the DJ closely. He
rapidly located the acid.
"I have just demonstrated a
method of reading thoughts
through the way one breathes
and moves," explained
LaVelle.
LaVelle defined this further
through an analogy.
"If there's a faucet dripping
during the day, you hardly
notice it, but at night, when
you're lying in bed, you be
come fully aware of that drip

ping faucet as you focus all of
your attention on it. That's
what I just did. I stilled my
body, quieted my thoughts
and focused my total attention
on his breathing and move
ments."
'Open line'
LaVelle said his technique
differs from others such as
Transcendental Meditation
and many of the oriental arts
because it emphasizes the im
portance of body, mind and
spirit equally. He said it is
necessary to keep an "open
line between mind and body,
and the spirit will just flow."
LaVelle is currently working
in conjunction with the Holis
tic Health movement. The
American Holistic Medical As
sociation defines its goals as
achieving "a state of well
being in which the individual's
body, mind, emotions and
spirit are in tune with the
natural cosmic and social envi
ronment."

LaVelle's unique abilities fall
under a small category of the
movement's concerns which
also include "diet, exercise
and other methods of better
living."
Much control
Ruth Kirk, an active member
in the holistic movement, said
"the control that Steve shows
proves that every individual
has a great deal more control
over their body than we have
been taught to believe."
LaVelle will be doing a series
of demonstrations throughout
the Bay Area until the end of
next month. He will also be
teaching a two-part class on his
technique through the Whole
Life Center and School in Palo
Alto.
"No one really wants to walk
on glass and hold fire in his
hand," he said, "but people
should develop the full
capabilities of their bodies.
There may be a time when they
really need them."

thinks that most of his abilities
can be developed in everyone.
"Everyone can do these
things," LaVelle said. "They're
not supernatural; in fact,
they're very natural. They
come from being aware of the
fact that you're perfect."
LaVelle defined his
technique as a combination of
relaxation and visualization. A
hypnotist for five years, LaVelle
said he based his technique on
the belief that you can do any
thing awake that you can do
under hypnosis.
The former hypnotist said

that inhibitions are highly limit
ing and prevent most people
from realizing the full
capacities available to human
beings.
Thought control
He demonstrated one of
these capacities in the realm of
thought control. Five film jars,
four containing water and one
containing acid, were placed
behind LaVelle's back and a
KZSU disc jockey rearranged
them. LaVelle placed his finger
over each container and
watched the DJ closely. He
rapidly located the acid.
"I have just demonstrated a
method of reading thoughts
through the way one breathes
and moves," explained
LaVelle.
LaVelle defined this further
through an analogy.
"If there's a faucet dripping
during the day, you hardly
notice it, but at night, when
you're lying in bed, you be
come fully aware of that drip

ping faucet as you focus all of
your attention on it. That's
what I just did. I stilled my
body, quieted my thoughts
and focused my total attention
on his breathing and move
ments."
'Open line'
LaVelle said his technique
differs from others such as
Transcendental Meditation
and many of the oriental arts
because it emphasizes the im
portance of body, mind and
spirit equally. He said it is
necessary to keep an "open
line between mind and body,
and the spirit will just flow."
LaVelle is currently working
in conjunction with the Holis
tic Health movement. The
American Holistic Medical As
sociation defines its goals as
achieving "a state of well
being in which the individual's
body, mind, emotions and
spirit are in tune with the
natural cosmic and social envi
ronment."

LaVelle's unique abilities fall
under a small category of the
movement's concerns which
also include "diet, exercise
and other methods of better
living."
Much control
Ruth Kirk, an active member
in the holistic movement, said
"the control that Steve shows
proves that every individual
has a great deal more control
over their body than we have
been taught to believe."
LaVelle will be doing a series
of demonstrations throughout
the Bay Area until the end of
next month. He will also be
teaching a two-part class on his
technique through the Whole
Life Center and School in Palo
Alto.
"No one really wants to walk
on glass and hold fire in his
hand," he said, "but people
should develop the full
capabilities of their bodies.
There may be a time when they
really need them."

Steve LaVelle uses pain and thought control while walking across a bed of jagged glass. He said he
imagines the glass as "a cold river bed with little rocks at the bottom."
"One . . . Two . . . Three."
On the count of three, Steve
LaVelle lowered his fist onto
the triggering mechanism, and
the two steel sides of the trap
snapped onto the upper part of
his hand with force that could
break the leg of anyone who
stepped on such a trap.
He smiled and walked about
the room talking casually as on
lookers watched the steel
bands biting into his flesh.
"Right now I'm pretending
that my arm is made of cold,
rolled steel," LaVelle said in an
unstrained voice. "The two
sides of this trap are feather pil
lows. Actually, I feel pressure,
but I am experiencing no
pain."
When two men finally re
moved the clamps from LaVel
le's hand by applying their full
body weight on either side of
the trap, both sides of his hand
had deep indentations. But,
there was no visible bleeding
and he moved his hand with
ease.
LaVelle performed a series of
stunts Wednesday at KZSU as
he demonstrated pain and
thought control and powers
which he himself cannot exp
lain.
No trances
The performer was quick to
distinguish his acts from those
of a hypnotist or magician, say
ing that he does not employ
trances or slight of hand. He
claimed a magician would
never allow his audience to ob
serve him at such close range.
He did everything he could to
assure his audience that no
tricks were being played.
Surrounded by a small group
that kept within inches of him,
LaVelle let cotton balls
drenched in lamp oil burn on
his palm until the flesh was red.
He also walked across a bed of
jagged glass. To prove that he
was not using secret gimmicks,
he showed onlookers that his
feet were smooth and uncal
loused, and then proceeded to
step on any piece of glass
selected by the audience.
As he prepared to walk ac
ross the glass in his bare feet,
LaVelle said, "I'm not going to
see this glass when I walk ac
ross it. What I am going to see
is a cbld river bed with little
rocks at the bottom."
Uri Geller
Many have compared
LaVelle to Uri Geller because
of his mysterious abilities to
casually endure situations that
would bring others great pain
or injury. LaVelle, however,
thinks that most of his abilities
can be developed in everyone.
"Everyone can do these
things," LaVelle said. "They're
not supernatural; in fact,
