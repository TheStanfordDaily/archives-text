# Marriott's Great America: thrills, plastic and apple pie
## 
### Brian Aronstam 
The Marriott Corporation
unabashedly claims that "there
are two great places to leave
your heart in Northern Califor
nia — San Francisco and Mar
riott's Great America."
After visiting the $50 million
Santa Clara amusement park,
some patrons might feel that
they have left more than their
hearts, as a day there may eas
ily cost each guest over $15.
Although visitors need pay
only the adult admission fee of
$9.75 to enjoy all of the rides
and shows as often as they
wish, the expense seldom
ends there.
The park does not permit
outside food and beverages,
and Great America's snack
stands and restaurants charge
from 75 cents for a candied
apple to $10 or more for a chic
ken dinner.
Despite the cost, however,
Marriott, the operator of more
than 700 hotels, restaurants
and airline kitchens, predicts
that 2.5 million Bay Area resi
dents and tourists will click
Great America's turnstiles in
1979.
Three years old
Opened in 1976 in what used
to be a fruit orchard off of the
Bayshore Freeway, Great
America is divided into five
areas that celebrate particular
periods in American history.

Through architecture, music
and costumes themed to rep
resent each era, Marriott re
creates a 1770s New England
seaport, a turn-of-the-century
county fair, a rural town of the
'20s, New Orleans of the 1850s,
and the Klondike during the
gold rush.
With these themes, Marriott
offers in a slightly different ver
sion the theme park concept
introduced by Walt Disney in
1955 when he opened Disney
land in Anaheim.
Alternative
Like Disney, Marriott tries to
provide its customers an alter
native to the grimy and sleazy
scene that often prevails at
shopping center and
boardwalk-style amusement
parks.
John Poimiroo, public affairs
manager of the park said that
no one "wants to put up with
filth, run-down rides, hooli
gans and poor quality food."
The public, he said, "wants a
high level of quality" at
amusement parks — "color,
excitement, and a place to
forget their problems."
To offer and maintain this
sort of attraction, the corpora
tion must draw more adults —
and their money — than the
traditional amusement parks;
as Disney once said, "You're
dead if you aim only for kids.
Adults are only grown up kids

anyway."
Disney formula
Marriott thus mixes thrill
rides that are almost juvenile in
their simplicity with historic
themes that supposedly appeal
to more serious adults. Blend
ing fun with education, Mar
riott uses the Disneyland for
mula that recouped Disney's
initial investment of $17million
in four years and has brought
Disney's organization an an
nual after-tax return of about
15 percent ever since.
Marriott is not alone in its
use of the Disney recipe. Ten
other corporations and inde
pendent entrepreneurs oper
ate a score of theme parks in
the nation's major metropoli
tan areas.
For many of these busines
ses — including Anheuser-
Busch, Taft Broadcasting, and
the Penn Central Railroad, as
well as Marriott — the theme
parks not only provide addi
tional revenues but also boost
sales in the corporations' other
activities, from selling beer to
renting hotel rooms.
j. Willard Marriott, chairman
of the board, recognized this
potential when he attended
the 1971 opening of Disney
World in Florida and re
marked, "What we need
around our hotels are some of
those Magic Kingdoms."
So Marriott built two king

doms — one in Santa Clara and
another in Gurnee, Illinois (a
Chicago suburb). Both sites
had been pinpointed by de
mographic studies as areas
having strong economies and
active populations.
Although there was no Mar

riott hotel in either area, the
corporation did build one next
to the Santa Clara park. The
corporation believes that its
other activities have benefitted
from the theme parks.
According to Poimiroo, "the
name 'Marriott' is so visual" in

the park's promotion that, the
publicity calls attention to the
corporation's other activities.
As a result, he said, people
now know that the same com
pany which brings them Great
America also brings them
Bob's Big Boy restaurants and
Farrell's ice cream parlors.
After they have a good time
at the park, the corporation
reasons, people are more
likely to visit the corporation's
restaurants and hotels.
Measly return
Great America may boost
profits elsewhere in the corpo
ration, but the Santa Clara park
itself provides a measly rate of
return of its own investment —
5 percent versus 13 percent for
the corporation as a whole.
Poimiroo claimed that the
theme park business is "not
the kind where you make giant
rushes" in revenues. The

theme park's profits during its
six-month season surpass
those in the corporation's
other activities, he added, but
the rate of return drops when
computed for the whole year.
Then, he said, expensive off
season maintenance costs
drive down the profit level.
The rate of return may drop
even lower this year if gasoline
shortages prevent families who
live a long distance from the
park — and who make up the
bulk of Great America's sum
mer trade — from driving to
the Bay Area.
Benefit from shortages
At the moment, Poimiroo
said,.the park appears to be
nefit from the shortages, be
cause many Santa Clara valley
residents who might otherwise
drive to vacation spots in the
mountains or at the beaches

instead come to Great
America.
Poimiroo added, however,
that "if gas does not loosen up,
the summer could be tough."
If Great America does have a
difficult summer, it will not be
for a lack of effort on Marriott's
part. Since opening in 1976, the
corporation has aggressively
pursued both new and repeat
visitors by opening a major
new attraction each year.
In 1977, Marriott added the
$1.5 million Tidal Wave roller
coaster, in 1978 the $3 million
Pictorium movie theater, and
this year the $1 million obser
vation tower.
Future plan*
In the next five years, Mar
riott plans to add a small zoo
whgre children may pet ani
mals and engage in what
Poimiroo calls "a 'meet the
goat' type of thing." The cor
poration may also build a sixth
theme area, The Great South
west.
Marriott also plans to con
tinue to stage new music and
dance shows every year, be
cause each new production,
Poimiroo said, draws the atten
tion of the press and thereby
earns the park free publicity.

Attractions that opened this
year include "To Fly," a film of
America's history of flight, and
Music! America! '79!, in which
18 freshly-scrubbed young per
formers sing and dance their
way through a revue of Ameri
can music.
Regardless of the nature of
the shows, it is, as Poimiroo
said, "the hardware" — the
park's assorted thrill rides —
that "bring the people out."
Tidal Wave
The Tidal Wave is unques
tionably the park's scariest at
traction. The ride catapults 28
passengers in seven cars up to
55 miles per hour in 4.2 sec
onds, whirls them upside
down through a 76-foot loop,
shoots them up a 140-foot
ramp and stops. For barely a
second. The cars then zoom
back down through the loop
past the station and up a ramp
at the opposite end, before
coasting back into the station.
Another "scream coaster,"
the Turn of the Century, works
well as a warm-up to the Tidal
Wave. Its six four-passenger
cars climb and dive 95 feet be
fore racing through two
corkscrew turns that literally
make the passengers' hair
stand on end.

Great America has a fair as
sortment of alternate attrac
tions that whirl, hurl and spin
patrons without the happy ter
rors of the super thrillers.
Some principle
Most rides, however, oper
ate on the same principle, cast
ing riders through the air in
some outlandish fashion. After
you have left your stomach in
mid-air for the twentieth time,
you may begin to search for
more diversions for your $9.75.
The park has a collection of
midway games in which pat
rons may try to win a colorful
stuffed animal by pitching
baMs, coins, darts and other
projectiles at or into milk cans,
bottles and other receptacles.
Wherever they go in the
park, visitors encounter re
minders of the Americana
theme. In addition to the
shows and decor, you will en
counter a barbershop quartet,
a marching band playing John
Phillip Souza and American
flags of every era.
'Fun-filled'
Poimiroo calls it "fun-filled,
wholesome nostalgia at its
best;" a plaque at the entrance
to the park puts it in a more
reverential tone:
"As you go through this park

may you enjoy many fun-filled
hours and take with you a last
ing sense of the greatness of
America."
Unlike the $160 million Dis
neyland complex, Great
America does not offer any
version of Disney's audio
animatronics — the plastic
humans and animals that sing,
dance and frolic to the delight
of all tourists. Without these
performers, the park does not
provide the element of fantasy
that abounds at Disney's king
dom.
Further, Great America's his
toric buildings lack the detail
that characterizes the struc
tures in Disneyland. The vistas
at Great America do not en
compass wonders like Disney's
picturesque and artificial castle
and mountain. The major
landmarks at the Santa Clara
park are the cold steel towers
of the thrill rides.
Butwith its crew of eager and
clean-cut high school stu
dents, Great America offers
light-hearted and courteous
service. And with its thrill rides
and wholesome shows, the
park provides more than a
day's worth of innocent
amusement.

theme. In addition to the
shows and decor, you will en

Phillip Souza and American
flags of every era.
'Fun-filled'
Poimiroo calls it "fun-filled,
wholesome nostalgia at its
best;" a plaque at the entrance
to the park puts it in a more
reverential tone:
"As you go through this park

may you enjoy many fun-filled
hours and take with you a last
ing sense of the greatness of
America."
Unlike the $160 million Dis
neyland complex, Great
America does not offer any
version of Disney's audio
animatronics — the plastic
humans and animals that sing,
dance and frolic to the delight
of all tourists. Without these
performers, the park does not
provide the element of fantasy
that abounds at Disney's king
dom.
Further, Great America's his
toric buildings lack the detail
that characterizes the struc
tures in Disneyland. The vistas
at Great America do not en
compass wonders like Disney's
picturesque and artificial castle
and mountain. The major
landmarks at the Santa Clara
park are the cold steel towers
of the thrill rides.
Butwith its crew of eager and
clean-cut high school stu
dents, Great America offers
light-hearted and courteous
service. And with its thrill rides
and wholesome shows, the
park provides more than a
day's worth of innocent
amusement.

The Marriott Corporation
unabashedly claims that "there
are two great places to leave
your heart in Northern Califor
nia — San Francisco and Mar
riott's Great America."
After visiting the $50 million
Santa Clara amusement park,
some patrons might feel that
they have left more than their
hearts, as a day there may eas
ily cost each guest over $15.
Although visitors need pay
only the adult admission fee of
$9.75 to enjoy all of the rides
and shows as often as they
wish, the expense seldom
ends there.
The park does not permit
outside food and beverages,
and Great America's snack
stands and restaurants charge
from 75 cents for a candied
apple to $10 or more for a chic
ken dinner.
Despite the cost, however,
Marriott, the operator of more
than 700 hotels, restaurants
and airline kitchens, predicts
that 2.5 million Bay Area resi
dents and tourists will click
Great America's turnstiles in
1979.
Three years old
Opened in 1976 in what used
to be a fruit orchard off of the
Bayshore Freeway, Great
America is divided into five
areas that celebrate particular
periods in American history.

Through architecture, music
and costumes themed to rep
resent each era, Marriott re
creates a 1770s New England
seaport, a turn-of-the-century
county fair, a rural town of the
'20s, New Orleans of the 1850s,
and the Klondike during the
gold rush.
With these themes, Marriott
offers in a slightly different ver
sion the theme park concept
introduced by Walt Disney in
1955 when he opened Disney
land in Anaheim.
Alternative
Like Disney, Marriott tries to
provide its customers an alter
native to the grimy and sleazy
scene that often prevails at
shopping center and
boardwalk-style amusement
parks.
John Poimiroo, public affairs
manager of the park said that
no one "wants to put up with
filth, run-down rides, hooli
gans and poor quality food."
The public, he said, "wants a
high level of quality" at
amusement parks — "color,
excitement, and a place to
forget their problems."
To offer and maintain this
sort of attraction, the corpora
tion must draw more adults —
and their money — than the
traditional amusement parks;
as Disney once said, "You're
dead if you aim only for kids.
Adults are only grown up kids

anyway."
Disney formula
Marriott thus mixes thrill
rides that are almost juvenile in
their simplicity with historic
themes that supposedly appeal
to more serious adults. Blend
ing fun with education, Mar
riott uses the Disneyland for
mula that recouped Disney's
initial investment of $17million
in four years and has brought
Disney's organization an an
nual after-tax return of about
15 percent ever since.
Marriott is not alone in its
use of the Disney recipe. Ten
other corporations and inde
pendent entrepreneurs oper
ate a score of theme parks in
the nation's major metropoli
tan areas.
For many of these busines
ses — including Anheuser-
Busch, Taft Broadcasting, and
the Penn Central Railroad, as
well as Marriott — the theme
parks not only provide addi
tional revenues but also boost
sales in the corporations' other
activities, from selling beer to
renting hotel rooms.
j. Willard Marriott, chairman
of the board, recognized this
potential when he attended
the 1971 opening of Disney
World in Florida and re
marked, "What we need
around our hotels are some of
those Magic Kingdoms."
So Marriott built two king

doms — one in Santa Clara and
another in Gurnee, Illinois (a
Chicago suburb). Both sites
had been pinpointed by de
mographic studies as areas
having strong economies and
active populations.
Although there was no Mar

riott hotel in either area, the
corporation did build one next
to the Santa Clara park. The
corporation believes that its
other activities have benefitted
from the theme parks.
According to Poimiroo, "the
name 'Marriott' is so visual" in

the park's promotion that, the
publicity calls attention to the
corporation's other activities.
As a result, he said, people
now know that the same com
pany which brings them Great
America also brings them
Bob's Big Boy restaurants and
Farrell's ice cream parlors.
After they have a good time
at the park, the corporation
reasons, people are more
likely to visit the corporation's
restaurants and hotels.
Measly return
Great America may boost
profits elsewhere in the corpo
ration, but the Santa Clara park
itself provides a measly rate of
return of its own investment —
5 percent versus 13 percent for
the corporation as a whole.
Poimiroo claimed that the
theme park business is "not
the kind where you make giant
rushes" in revenues. The

theme park's profits during its
six-month season surpass
those in the corporation's
other activities, he added, but
the rate of return drops when
computed for the whole year.
Then, he said, expensive off
season maintenance costs
drive down the profit level.
The rate of return may drop
even lower this year if gasoline
shortages prevent families who
live a long distance from the
park — and who make up the
bulk of Great America's sum
mer trade — from driving to
the Bay Area.
Benefit from shortages
At the moment, Poimiroo
said,.the park appears to be
nefit from the shortages, be
cause many Santa Clara valley
residents who might otherwise
drive to vacation spots in the
mountains or at the beaches

instead come to Great
America.
Poimiroo added, however,
that "if gas does not loosen up,
the summer could be tough."
If Great America does have a
difficult summer, it will not be
for a lack of effort on Marriott's
part. Since opening in 1976, the
corporation has aggressively
pursued both new and repeat
visitors by opening a major
new attraction each year.
In 1977, Marriott added the
$1.5 million Tidal Wave roller
coaster, in 1978 the $3 million
Pictorium movie theater, and
this year the $1 million obser
vation tower.
Future plan*
In the next five years, Mar
riott plans to add a small zoo
whgre children may pet ani
mals and engage in what
Poimiroo calls "a 'meet the
goat' type of thing." The cor
poration may also build a sixth
theme area, The Great South
west.
Marriott also plans to con
tinue to stage new music and
dance shows every year, be
cause each new production,
Poimiroo said, draws the atten
tion of the press and thereby
earns the park free publicity.

Attractions that opened this
year include "To Fly," a film of
America's history of flight, and
Music! America! '79!, in which
18 freshly-scrubbed young per
formers sing and dance their
way through a revue of Ameri
can music.
Regardless of the nature of
the shows, it is, as Poimiroo
said, "the hardware" — the
park's assorted thrill rides —
that "bring the people out."
Tidal Wave
The Tidal Wave is unques
tionably the park's scariest at
traction. The ride catapults 28
passengers in seven cars up to
55 miles per hour in 4.2 sec
onds, whirls them upside
down through a 76-foot loop,
shoots them up a 140-foot
ramp and stops. For barely a
second. The cars then zoom
back down through the loop
past the station and up a ramp
at the opposite end, before
coasting back into the station.
Another "scream coaster,"
the Turn of the Century, works
well as a warm-up to the Tidal
Wave. Its six four-passenger
cars climb and dive 95 feet be
fore racing through two
corkscrew turns that literally
make the passengers' hair
stand on end.

Great America has a fair as
sortment of alternate attrac
tions that whirl, hurl and spin
patrons without the happy ter
rors of the super thrillers.
Some principle
Most rides, however, oper
ate on the same principle, cast
ing riders through the air in
some outlandish fashion. After
you have left your stomach in
mid-air for the twentieth time,
you may begin to search for
more diversions for your $9.75.
The park has a collection of
midway games in which pat
rons may try to win a colorful
stuffed animal by pitching
baMs, coins, darts and other
projectiles at or into milk cans,
bottles and other receptacles.
Wherever they go in the
park, visitors encounter re
minders of the Americana
theme. In addition to the
shows and decor, you will en
counter a barbershop quartet,
a marching band playing John
Phillip Souza and American
flags of every era.

said, "the hardware" — the
park's assorted thrill rides —
that "bring the people out."
Tidal Wave
The Tidal Wave is unques
tionably the park's scariest at
traction. The ride catapults 28
passengers in seven cars up to
55 miles per hour in 4.2 sec
onds, whirls them upside
down through a 76-foot loop,
shoots them up a 140-foot
ramp and stops. For barely a
second. The cars then zoom
back down through the loop
past the station and up a ramp
at the opposite end, before
coasting back into the station.
Another "scream coaster,"
the Turn of the Century, works
well as a warm-up to the Tidal
Wave. Its six four-passenger
cars climb and dive 95 feet be
fore racing through two
corkscrew turns that literally
make the passengers' hair
stand on end.

Great America has a fair as
sortment of alternate attrac
tions that whirl, hurl and spin
patrons without the happy ter
rors of the super thrillers.
Some principle
Most rides, however, oper
ate on the same principle, cast
ing riders through the air in
some outlandish fashion. After
you have left your stomach in
mid-air for the twentieth time,
you may begin to search for
more diversions for your $9.75.
The park has a collection of
midway games in which pat
rons may try to win a colorful
stuffed animal by pitching
baMs, coins, darts and other
projectiles at or into milk cans,
bottles and other receptacles.
Wherever they go in the
park, visitors encounter re
minders of the Americana
theme. In addition to the
shows and decor, you will en
counter a barbershop quartet,
a marching band playing John
Phillip Souza and American
flags of every era.
'Fun-filled'
Poimiroo calls it "fun-filled,
wholesome nostalgia at its
best;" a plaque at the entrance
to the park puts it in a more
reverential tone:
"As you go through this park

may you enjoy many fun-filled
hours and take with you a last
ing sense of the greatness of
America."
Unlike the $160 million Dis
neyland complex, Great
America does not offer any
version of Disney's audio
animatronics — the plastic
humans and animals that sing,
dance and frolic to the delight
of all tourists. Without these
performers, the park does not
provide the element of fantasy
that abounds at Disney's king
dom.
Further, Great America's his
toric buildings lack the detail
that characterizes the struc
tures in Disneyland. The vistas
at Great America do not en
compass wonders like Disney's
picturesque and artificial castle
and mountain. The major
landmarks at the Santa Clara
park are the cold steel towers
of the thrill rides.
Butwith its crew of eager and
clean-cut high school stu
dents, Great America offers
light-hearted and courteous
service. And with its thrill rides
and wholesome shows, the
park provides more than a
day's worth of innocent
amusement.

The Marriott Corporation
unabashedly claims that "there
are two great places to leave
your heart in Northern Califor
nia — San Francisco and Mar
riott's Great America."
After visiting the $50 million
Santa Clara amusement park,
some patrons might feel that
they have left more than their
hearts, as a day there may eas
ily cost each guest over $15.
Although visitors need pay
only the adult admission fee of
$9.75 to enjoy all of the rides
and shows as often as they
wish, the expense seldom
ends there.
The park does not permit
outside food and beverages,
and Great America's snack
stands and restaurants charge
from 75 cents for a candied
apple to $10 or more for a chic
ken dinner.
Despite the cost, however,
Marriott, the operator of more
than 700 hotels, restaurants
and airline kitchens, predicts
that 2.5 million Bay Area resi
dents and tourists will click
Great America's turnstiles in
1979.
Three years old
Opened in 1976 in what used
to be a fruit orchard off of the
Bayshore Freeway, Great
America is divided into five
areas that celebrate particular
periods in American history.

Through architecture, music
and costumes themed to rep
resent each era, Marriott re
creates a 1770s New England
seaport, a turn-of-the-century
county fair, a rural town of the
'20s, New Orleans of the 1850s,
and the Klondike during the
gold rush.
With these themes, Marriott
offers in a slightly different ver
sion the theme park concept
introduced by Walt Disney in
1955 when he opened Disney
land in Anaheim.
Alternative
Like Disney, Marriott tries to
provide its customers an alter
native to the grimy and sleazy
scene that often prevails at
shopping center and
boardwalk-style amusement
parks.
John Poimiroo, public affairs
manager of the park said that
no one "wants to put up with
filth, run-down rides, hooli
gans and poor quality food."
The public, he said, "wants a
high level of quality" at
amusement parks — "color,
excitement, and a place to
forget their problems."
To offer and maintain this
sort of attraction, the corpora
tion must draw more adults —
and their money — than the
traditional amusement parks;
as Disney once said, "You're
dead if you aim only for kids.
Adults are only grown up kids

anyway."
Disney formula
Marriott thus mixes thrill
rides that are almost juvenile in
their simplicity with historic
themes that supposedly appeal
to more serious adults. Blend
ing fun with education, Mar
riott uses the Disneyland for
mula that recouped Disney's
initial investment of $17million
in four years and has brought
Disney's organization an an
nual after-tax return of about
15 percent ever since.
Marriott is not alone in its
use of the Disney recipe. Ten
other corporations and inde
pendent entrepreneurs oper
ate a score of theme parks in
the nation's major metropoli
tan areas.
For many of these busines
ses — including Anheuser-
Busch, Taft Broadcasting, and
the Penn Central Railroad, as
well as Marriott — the theme
parks not only provide addi
tional revenues but also boost
sales in the corporations' other
activities, from selling beer to
renting hotel rooms.
j. Willard Marriott, chairman
of the board, recognized this
potential when he attended
the 1971 opening of Disney
World in Florida and re
marked, "What we need
around our hotels are some of
those Magic Kingdoms."
So Marriott built two king

doms — one in Santa Clara and
another in Gurnee, Illinois (a
Chicago suburb). Both sites
had been pinpointed by de
mographic studies as areas
having strong economies and
active populations.
Although there was no Mar

riott hotel in either area, the
corporation did build one next
to the Santa Clara park. The
corporation believes that its
other activities have benefitted
from the theme parks.
According to Poimiroo, "the
name 'Marriott' is so visual" in

the park's promotion that, the
publicity calls attention to the
corporation's other activities.
As a result, he said, people
now know that the same com
pany which brings them Great
America also brings them
Bob's Big Boy restaurants and
Farrell's ice cream parlors.
After they have a good time
at the park, the corporation
reasons, people are more
likely to visit the corporation's
restaurants and hotels.
Measly return
Great America may boost
profits elsewhere in the corpo
ration, but the Santa Clara park
itself provides a measly rate of
return of its own investment —
5 percent versus 13 percent for
the corporation as a whole.
Poimiroo claimed that the
theme park business is "not
the kind where you make giant
rushes" in revenues. The

theme park's profits during its
six-month season surpass
those in the corporation's
other activities, he added, but
the rate of return drops when
computed for the whole year.
Then, he said, expensive off
season maintenance costs
drive down the profit level.
The rate of return may drop
even lower this year if gasoline
shortages prevent families who
live a long distance from the
park — and who make up the
bulk of Great America's sum
mer trade — from driving to
the Bay Area.
Benefit from shortages
At the moment, Poimiroo
said,.the park appears to be
nefit from the shortages, be
cause many Santa Clara valley
residents who might otherwise
drive to vacation spots in the
mountains or at the beaches

instead come to Great
America.
Poimiroo added, however,
that "if gas does not loosen up,
the summer could be tough."
If Great America does have a
difficult summer, it will not be
for a lack of effort on Marriott's
part. Since opening in 1976, the
corporation has aggressively
pursued both new and repeat
visitors by opening a major
new attraction each year.
In 1977, Marriott added the
$1.5 million Tidal Wave roller
coaster, in 1978 the $3 million
Pictorium movie theater, and
this year the $1 million obser
vation tower.
Future plan*
In the next five years, Mar
riott plans to add a small zoo
whgre children may pet ani
mals and engage in what
Poimiroo calls "a 'meet the
goat' type of thing." The cor
poration may also build a sixth
theme area, The Great South
west.
Marriott also plans to con
tinue to stage new music and
dance shows every year, be
cause each new production,
Poimiroo said, draws the atten
tion of the press and thereby
earns the park free publicity.

Attractions that opened this
year include "To Fly," a film of
America's history of flight, and
Music! America! '79!, in which
18 freshly-scrubbed young per
formers sing and dance their
way through a revue of Ameri
can music.
Regardless of the nature of
the shows, it is, as Poimiroo
said, "the hardware" — the

skyline.
instead come to Great
America.
Poimiroo added, however,
that "if gas does not loosen up,
the summer could be tough."
If Great America does have a
difficult summer, it will not be
for a lack of effort on Marriott's
part. Since opening in 1976, the
corporation has aggressively
pursued both new and repeat
visitors by opening a major
new attraction each year.
In 1977, Marriott added the
$1.5 million Tidal Wave roller
coaster, in 1978 the $3 million
Pictorium movie theater, and
this year the $1 million obser
vation tower.
Future plan*
In the next five years, Mar
riott plans to add a small zoo
whgre children may pet ani
mals and engage in what
Poimiroo calls "a 'meet the
goat' type of thing." The cor
poration may also build a sixth
theme area, The Great South
west.
Marriott also plans to con
tinue to stage new music and
dance shows every year, be
cause each new production,
Poimiroo said, draws the atten
tion of the press and thereby
earns the park free publicity.

Attractions that opened this
year include "To Fly," a film of
America's history of flight, and
Music! America! '79!, in which
18 freshly-scrubbed young per
formers sing and dance their
way through a revue of Ameri
can music.
Regardless of the nature of
the shows, it is, as Poimiroo
said, "the hardware" — the
park's assorted thrill rides —
that "bring the people out."
Tidal Wave
The Tidal Wave is unques
tionably the park's scariest at
traction. The ride catapults 28
passengers in seven cars up to
55 miles per hour in 4.2 sec
onds, whirls them upside
down through a 76-foot loop,
shoots them up a 140-foot
ramp and stops. For barely a
second. The cars then zoom
back down through the loop
past the station and up a ramp
at the opposite end, before
coasting back into the station.
Another "scream coaster,"
the Turn of the Century, works
well as a warm-up to the Tidal
Wave. Its six four-passenger
cars climb and dive 95 feet be
fore racing through two
corkscrew turns that literally
make the passengers' hair
stand on end.

Great America has a fair as
sortment of alternate attrac
tions that whirl, hurl and spin
patrons without the happy ter
rors of the super thrillers.
Some principle
Most rides, however, oper
ate on the same principle, cast
ing riders through the air in
some outlandish fashion. After
you have left your stomach in
mid-air for the twentieth time,
you may begin to search for
more diversions for your $9.75.
The park has a collection of
midway games in which pat
rons may try to win a colorful
stuffed animal by pitching
baMs, coins, darts and other
projectiles at or into milk cans,
bottles and other receptacles.
Wherever they go in the
park, visitors encounter re
minders of the Americana
theme. In addition to the
shows and decor, you will en
counter a barbershop quartet,
a marching band playing John
Phillip Souza and American
flags of every era.
'Fun-filled'
Poimiroo calls it "fun-filled,
wholesome nostalgia at its
best;" a plaque at the entrance
to the park puts it in a more
reverential tone:
"As you go through this park

may you enjoy many fun-filled
hours and take with you a last
ing sense of the greatness of
America."
Unlike the $160 million Dis
neyland complex, Great
America does not offer any
version of Disney's audio
animatronics — the plastic
humans and animals that sing,
dance and frolic to the delight
of all tourists. Without these
performers, the park does not
provide the element of fantasy
that abounds at Disney's king
dom.
Further, Great America's his
toric buildings lack the detail
that characterizes the struc
tures in Disneyland. The vistas
at Great America do not en
compass wonders like Disney's
picturesque and artificial castle
and mountain. The major
landmarks at the Santa Clara
park are the cold steel towers
of the thrill rides.
Butwith its crew of eager and
clean-cut high school stu
dents, Great America offers
light-hearted and courteous
service. And with its thrill rides
and wholesome shows, the
park provides more than a
day's worth of innocent
amusement.

The behind-the-scenes projection system of Great America's new Pictorium Theater features a four-foot
diameter take-up reel that operates on a horizontal rather than vertical plane. The projector uses two
miles of super 70mm film for a single 30-minute movie.
