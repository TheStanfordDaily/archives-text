# Marriott's Great America: thrills, plastic and apple pie
## 
### Brian Aronstam 
The Marriott Corporation
unabashedly claims that "there
are two great places to leave
your heart in Northern Califor
nia — San Francisco and Mar
riott's Great America."
After visiting the $50 million
Santa Clara amusement park,
some patrons might feel that
they have left more than their
hearts, as a day there may eas
ily cost each guest over $15.
Although visitors need pay
only the adult admission fee of
$9.75 to enjoy all of the rides
and shows as often as they
wish, the expense seldom
ends there.
The park does not permit
outside food and beverages,
and Great America's snack
stands and restaurants charge
from 75 cents for a candied
apple to $10 or more for a chic
ken dinner.
Despite the cost, however,
Marriott, the operator of more
than 700 hotels, restaurants
and airline kitchens, predicts
that 2.5 million Bay Area resi
dents and tourists will click
Great America's turnstiles in
1979.
Three years old
Opened in 1976 in what used
to be a fruit orchard off of the
Bayshore Freeway, Great
America is divided into five
areas that celebrate particular
periods in American history.

Through architecture, music
and costumes themed to rep
resent each era, Marriott re
creates a 1770s New England
seaport, a turn-of-the-century
county fair, a rural town of the
'20s, New Orleans of the 1850s,
and the Klondike during the
gold rush.
With these themes, Marriott
offers in a slightly different ver
sion the theme park concept
introduced by Walt Disney in
1955 when he opened Disney
land in Anaheim.
Alternative
Like Disney, Marriott tries to
provide its customers an alter
native to the grimy and sleazy
scene that often prevails at
shopping center and
boardwalk-style amusement
parks.
John Poimiroo, public affairs
manager of the park said that
no one "wants to put up with
filth, run-down rides, hooli
gans and poor quality food."
The public, he said, "wants a
high level of quality" at
amusement parks — "color,
excitement, and a place to
forget their problems."
To offer and maintain this
sort of attraction, the corpora
tion must draw more adults —
and their money — than the
traditional amusement parks;
as Disney once said, "You're
dead if you aim only for kids.
Adults are only grown up kids

anyway."
Disney formula
Marriott thus mixes thrill
rides that are almost juvenile in
their simplicity with historic
themes that supposedly appeal
to more serious adults. Blend
ing fun with education, Mar
riott uses the Disneyland for
mula that recouped Disney's
initial investment of $17million
in four years and has brought
Disney's organization an an
nual after-tax return of about
15 percent ever since.
Marriott is not alone in its
use of the Disney recipe. Ten
other corporations and inde
pendent entrepreneurs oper
ate a score of theme parks in
the nation's major metropoli
tan areas.
For many of these busines
ses — including Anheuser-
Busch, Taft Broadcasting, and
the Penn Central Railroad, as
well as Marriott — the theme
parks not only provide addi
tional revenues but also boost
sales in the corporations' other
activities, from selling beer to
renting hotel rooms.
j. Willard Marriott, chairman
of the board, recognized this
potential when he attended
the 1971 opening of Disney
World in Florida and re
marked, "What we need
around our hotels are some of
those Magic Kingdoms."
So Marriott built two king

doms — one in Santa Clara and
another in Gurnee, Illinois (a
Chicago suburb). Both sites
had been pinpointed by de
mographic studies as areas
having strong economies and
active populations.
Although there was no Mar

riott hotel in either area, the
corporation did build one next
to the Santa Clara park. The
corporation believes that its
other activities have benefitted
from the theme parks.
According to Poimiroo, "the
name 'Marriott' is so visual" in

the park's promotion that, the
publicity calls attention to the
corporation's other activities.
As a result, he said, people
now know that the same com
pany which brings them Great
America also brings them
Bob's Big Boy restaurants and
Farrell's ice cream parlors.
After they have a good time
at the park, the corporation
reasons, people are more
likely to visit the corporation's
restaurants and hotels.
Measly return
Great America may boost
profits elsewhere in the corpo
ration, but the Santa Clara park
itself provides a measly rate of
return of its own investment —
5 percent versus 13 percent for
the corporation as a whole.
Poimiroo claimed that the
theme park business is "not
the kind where you make giant
rushes" in revenues. The

theme park's profits during its
six-month season surpass
those in the corporation's
other activities, he added, but
the rate of return drops when
computed for the whole year.
Then, he said, expensive off
season maintenance costs
drive down the profit level.
The rate of return may drop
even lower this year if gasoline
shortages prevent families who
live a long distance from the
park — and who make up the
bulk of Great America's sum
mer trade — from driving to
the Bay Area.
Benefit from shortages
At the moment, Poimiroo
said,.the park appears to be
nefit from the shortages, be
cause many Santa Clara valley
residents who might otherwise
drive to vacation spots in the
mountains or at the beaches

carousel — a double decker which towers 100 feet above the park's
skyline.
