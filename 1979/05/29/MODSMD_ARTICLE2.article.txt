# Whatever happened to the anti-war protesters of '69?
## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
Time warp — just like any other reunion, but not
quite.
At how many reunions do the participants tour
the buildings they trashed, sat-in at and took over,
only to adjourn to Columbae House to look at
news clips of a demonstration in which they were
tear-gassed?
At how many reunions in Bowman Oak Grove
do the alums reminisce about the time they dis
rupted a Board of Trustees' meeting at the nearby
Faculty Club and ate the trustees' eclairs?
Not many. But this one was Saturday's 10-year
get-together of 125 members of the April 3 Move
ment (A3M), a group of people from the University
who sat in at the Applied Electronics Laboratories
(AEL), took over Encina Hall and demonstrated at
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the spring
of 1969.
War involvement
The issues were the University's involvement in
the Vietnam War effort, and in a larger sense, the
war as a whole.
As Stewart Burns, now an activist in the Abalone
Alliance, an anti-nuclear group, said, "There was a
feeling that we had to stop the war in very concrete
terms. We were also trying to build a movement to
stop the war."
An ex-protester who asked not to be named
added that "SRI was a minor question, but it was a
focus" around which to promote the anti-war
movement in general.
The A3M began on April 3, 1969, when more
than 300 persons met in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and voted to demand that SRI be brought under
tighter University control. One week later, hun
dreds of students sat-in at AEL to prevent the con
tinuation of war-related research there.
"The research at SRI and AEL was crucial to the
war," Burns said. "There is some evidence that
research was going on at AEL on smart bombs used
in 1972 against the North Vietnamese offensive."
The Academic Council voted a week later to end
many kinds of secret research at the University,
including some that was being conducted at AEL,
but controversy continued over SRI and its ties to
the University.
A trustee committee met on campus with stu
dent representatives. Many students who watched
the meeting over closed-circuit television in
Memorial Auditorium walked out. After several
hours of discussion they took over Encina Hall
early on the morning of May 1. They left that morn
ing under threat of arrest. Many were later sus
pended.

The trustees, however, severed University ties
with SRI instead of tightening them as the A3M
members demanded. More than 400 students sub
sequently blocked roads near the SRI building in
the Stanford Industrial Park and were dispersed by
police using tear gas.
But what did the trials and tribulations of the
protests achieve? Doron Weinberg was then a
teaching fellow at the Law School, a prominent
member of A3M and moderator of many of the
mass meetings. He pointed both to the end of the
war and additions to "the political lexicon" over
the past 10 years. The range of "what people con
sider legitimate political opinion has increased,"
he said.
Limit options
He added that the Vietnam War and public reac
tion to it helped limit U.S. options for international
involvement. He mentioned Angola and Iran as
places where U.S. action may have been deterred
by the scars of the Indochina experience.
Phil Trounstine, now a reporter for the San Jose
Mercury, was more pessimistic about the move
ment's impact on the University.
"I think Stanford is right back where it was 10
years ago," he said. "I don't think Stanford has
much more of a moral conscience now."
Country club
Paul Rupert, now an administrator in San Fran
cisco, said he feels that circumstances have
changed in other ways, too. He said that when he
was a freshman here in 1963, Stanford was a coun
try club.
"The strangest part is that it is amazingly more of
one now. It's reverting with a vengeance" to what
it was like then, he said.
People who were part of the A3M still have a lot
of political and social consciousness, Rupert ad
ded.
Trounstine said most people "still have the same
set of social beliefs and have found new ways of
doing what they feel is socially beneficial. People
still have the anti-imperialist attitude the A3M
spawned and nurtured."
Weinberg, though, noted a distinct difference
between activism then and now. He said that now,
"the causes are more diffuse. The raw numbers of
people somehow involved (politically active) are at
least as great," but they are not all concerned with
the same issue as people were with Vietnam.
Vietnam War
But on Saturday, everybody was concerned with
the Vietnam War once again, and with their roles
in protesting it.
Lenny Siegel, another A3M member was charac

terized as the "big brother, welcome-to-the
movement radical." He recalled a saying that
originated when Durand Building was repeatedly
trashed — "People who do war research shouldn't
live in glass buildings."
Siegel said he never registered at the University
after the trustee disruption incident. "I've always
wanted to finish Stanford, but it's still here," he
said.
Other people had their share of reminiscences
to contribute, too.
"Remember the time the police were watching
us from a helicopter and we spelled out 'FUCK
YOU' in drill formation?"
According to a list of addresses and occupations
compiled by the sponsor of the reunion, the
Pacific Studies Center (PSC), the most common
occupation of A3M veterans who attended the
reunion is law. One-sixth of them are lawyers. The
next most common professions are writers and
reporters, followed by natural scientists, academi
cians and administrators.
Most of the ex-protesters on the PSC list still live
in the area, one-third of them in the south penin
sula and another third in the rest of the Bay Area.
Fifteen percent live in the East, and 10 percent in
the rest of California.
But statistics aside, the reunion was people com
ing together again. People watching the films of
the demonstration at SRI and laughing and point
ing at people they knew.
It was people talking about how getting the invi
tation to the reunion made them feel very old,
people rehashing the protests and people like
Siegel, saying that they look back fondly on the
days of student activism that shaped their lives.
