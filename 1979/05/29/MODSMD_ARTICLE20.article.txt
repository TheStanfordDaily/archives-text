# Bourne, Rennert are All-America
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne were both named to
the 1979 College All-America
team yesterday. Rennert, who
took over the top spot when
Matt Mitchell turned pro back
in March, enjoyed a fine sea
son which included dual match
wins over Kevin Curren, Fritz
Buehning and Robert Van't
Hof, three of the top five
ranked players in the college
ranks this year.
His success gained him the
number eight seeding in the
NCAA tournament last week.

Rennert lived up to his seeding
when he reached the quarter
finals of the tournament before
being knocked off by Fritz
Buehning 6-3, 6-2.
In the earlier rounds Rennert
defeated Mike Candolfo of
Clemson 6-4, 6-4, Matt Wool
ridge of UC-lrvine 6-1, 4-6, 6-4
and his most impressive win of
the tournament, a surprisingly
easy 6-3, 6-2 win over Trinity's
Ben McKown.
McKown had been playing
extremely well of late. In fact
he had taken over the top spot
on his team from Eric Iskersky.

Rennert, who has completed
his academic work for this
quarter, has gone to New York
to take a well deserved vaca
tion with his best friend, John
McEnroe, before starting the
summer tennis season.
Stanford's other All-America
player Lloyd Bourne reached
the round of 32 in the singles
tournament where he dropped
a 6-2, 6-4 decision to number
seven seed Eddie Edwards of
Pepperdine. Bourne easily
took care of SMU's Tommy
Cain in the first round 6-0,6-3.
Bourne has the distinction of

having never lost a post season
singles match. With four vic
tories in this year's tournament
he upped his winning streak to
12.
In Stanford's best showing
this year the two All-America
selections enjoyed a fine dou
bles tournament, reaching the
semifinals. Seeded sixth they
scored a straight set victory
over top seeded Buehning and
Blaine Willenborg of UCLA 6-2,
6-4 in the quarterfinals. That
was the end of the line though
as they were beaten badly by
Iskersky-McKown 6-1, 6-0 in
the semis. After winning the
opening game they dropped
the next 12 to lose by the lop
sided score.
Probably the most disap
pointing and frustrating sea
son's end belonged to
freshman Tim Mayotte.
Mayotte held triple match
point at 2-4 in the final set tieb
reaker against Ricardo Acuna
of Northwest Louisiana State.
Acuna turned the tide with
three pinpoint passing shots
and snatched the victory. The
loss left Mayotte one point shy
of making the All-America
team in his freshman year.
Next year he will be a shoe-in
for the team.
In fact, Mayotte will proba
bly be among the top seeds in
next year's tournament. He de
feated Florida's Kevin Cook
6-1, 6-1 in first round action.
Mayotte, along with Rennert
and Bourne, was named to this
year's Junior Davis Cup team
and will enjoy an expense free
summer of tennis play courtesy
of the United States Tennis As
sociation.
Injuries made room for Stan
ford's Scott Bondurant and Jim
Hodges to get their first taste of
NCAA individual competition.

Bondurant, the tournament's
first alternate, defeated Buddy
Bowman of Arkansas 6-3, 7-6.
It was a good win for the
Stanford freshman. Bowman
was a finalist at the National 21
championships last summer.
Bondurant and Hodges, the
doubles tournament second
alternate, almost came up with

a big upset in the first round.
They pushed tournament
finalists Iskersky-McKown to
three sets 6-4, 0-6, 6-2.
In more local action team
captain Greg Hing defeated
two seeded players to reach
the quarterfinals of the Moun
tain View Open tournament.
Hing, a sophomore, was on the

short end of a 6-4, 6-2 score
with Joe Meyers, an ex-San
Jose State top player.
Hing and teammate Alan
Blumberg also reached the
quarterfinals of the doubles.
Seeded sixth they lost a tight
2-6, 6-2, 7-6 decision to third
seed Meyers and Australian
Wayne Crowley.

doubles in the individual tournament.

JUNIOR LLOYD Bourne found himself in the No. 2 spot in the Cardinal lineup this year after Matt
Mitchell's departure, and he displayed performances worthy of that position throughout the season.

Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne were both named to
the 1979 College All-America
team yesterday. Rennert, who
took over the top spot when
Matt Mitchell turned pro back
in March, enjoyed a fine sea
son which included dual match
wins over Kevin Curren, Fritz
Buehning and Robert Van't
Hof, three of the top five
ranked players in the college
ranks this year.
His success gained him the
number eight seeding in the
NCAA tournament last week.

Rennert lived up to his seeding
when he reached the quarter
finals of the tournament before
being knocked off by Fritz
Buehning 6-3, 6-2.
In the earlier rounds Rennert
defeated Mike Candolfo of
Clemson 6-4, 6-4, Matt Wool
ridge of UC-lrvine 6-1, 4-6, 6-4
and his most impressive win of
the tournament, a surprisingly
easy 6-3, 6-2 win over Trinity's
Ben McKown.
McKown had been playing
extremely well of late. In fact
he had taken over the top spot
on his team from Eric Iskersky.

Rennert, who has completed
his academic work for this
quarter, has gone to New York
to take a well deserved vaca
tion with his best friend, John
McEnroe, before starting the
summer tennis season.
Stanford's other All-America
player Lloyd Bourne reached
the round of 32 in the singles
tournament where he dropped
a 6-2, 6-4 decision to number
seven seed Eddie Edwards of
Pepperdine. Bourne easily
took care of SMU's Tommy
Cain in the first round 6-0,6-3.
Bourne has the distinction of

having never lost a post season
singles match. With four vic
tories in this year's tournament
he upped his winning streak to
12.
In Stanford's best showing
this year the two All-America
selections enjoyed a fine dou
bles tournament, reaching the
semifinals. Seeded sixth they
scored a straight set victory
over top seeded Buehning and
Blaine Willenborg of UCLA 6-2,
6-4 in the quarterfinals. That
was the end of the line though
as they were beaten badly by
Iskersky-McKown 6-1, 6-0 in
the semis. After winning the
opening game they dropped
the next 12 to lose by the lop
sided score.
Probably the most disap
pointing and frustrating sea
son's end belonged to
freshman Tim Mayotte.
Mayotte held triple match
point at 2-4 in the final set tieb
reaker against Ricardo Acuna
of Northwest Louisiana State.
Acuna turned the tide with
three pinpoint passing shots
and snatched the victory. The
loss left Mayotte one point shy
of making the All-America
team in his freshman year.
Next year he will be a shoe-in
for the team.
In fact, Mayotte will proba
bly be among the top seeds in
next year's tournament. He de
feated Florida's Kevin Cook
6-1, 6-1 in first round action.
Mayotte, along with Rennert
and Bourne, was named to this
year's Junior Davis Cup team
and will enjoy an expense free
summer of tennis play courtesy
of the United States Tennis As
sociation.
Injuries made room for Stan
ford's Scott Bondurant and Jim
Hodges to get their first taste of
NCAA individual competition.

Bondurant, the tournament's
first alternate, defeated Buddy
Bowman of Arkansas 6-3, 7-6.
It was a good win for the
Stanford freshman. Bowman
was a finalist at the National 21
championships last summer.
Bondurant and Hodges, the
doubles tournament second
alternate, almost came up with

a big upset in the first round.
They pushed tournament
finalists Iskersky-McKown to
three sets 6-4, 0-6, 6-2.
In more local action team
captain Greg Hing defeated
two seeded players to reach
the quarterfinals of the Moun
tain View Open tournament.
Hing, a sophomore, was on the

short end of a 6-4, 6-2 score
with Joe Meyers, an ex-San
Jose State top player.
Hing and teammate Alan
Blumberg also reached the
quarterfinals of the doubles.
Seeded sixth they lost a tight
2-6, 6-2, 7-6 decision to third
seed Meyers and Australian
Wayne Crowley.

JUNIOR LLOYD Bourne found himself in the No. 2 spot in the Cardinal lineup this year after Matt
Mitchell's departure, and he displayed performances worthy of that position throughout the season.
Here, Bourne is shown playing for the first time in Maples Pavilion. He had another triumph Sunday,
when he was named to the 1979 college All-America team after the NCAA tournament in Athens,
Georgia.
