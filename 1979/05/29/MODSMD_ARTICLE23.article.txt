# Daily staff upset by ASSU Senate
## 
### 
For the first time all year, the ASSU Senate was able to
come to a unanimous decision in less than three hours as
the senators scored a miraculous 16-4 victory over The
Stanford Daily in a weekend Softball game at Roble Field.
The all-male senate team was paced by the strong hitting
of senators from all constituencies and umpiring by former
ASSU co-president Andrew Goldenkranz.
Numerous errors in the field resulted in the loss by the
coed Daily squad. "It was our worst defensive display since
the Dupie affair," said Daily first baseman Mike Charlson.
In addition, the Daily offensive attack was uninspired as
the "pitching" of senatorGeoff Baskir held the Daily to only
four runs in the seven-inning slugfest.
Meanwhile, Daily pitching could not hold off the senate
attack as one ball after another soared into the deep out
field. Three different Daily pitchers failed to stop the slug
gers.
Many of the 16 senate runs came on multi-run homers.
"The only people we could count on for outs were (Senate
Chairperson George) Drysdale, Baskir and (ASSU Flicks
Manager and team ringer Jay) Roach," said shortstop Kurt
Cobb. "If it weren't for loach's popups and strikeouts, we
might still be in the third inning."
The game featured few outbursts thanks to Umpire Gol
denkranz' plea early in the fourth inning to "keep politics
out of the game."
Senators, visibly pleased with the outcome, thanked
Daily players for their hapless performance.
One senator was quoted as saying he hoped Daily repor
ters would become as complacent when reporting on the
senate because "maybe then some people would stop ask
ing us what we're doing and we wouldn't have to be embar
rassed by saying 'nothing' anymore."

Senate. The senate won the contest, although they had to "borrow" a
player from the Daily staff in order to make a nine-man quorum.
