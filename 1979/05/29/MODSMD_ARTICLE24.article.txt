# Seattle's Sikma grew up quick
## 
### 
Seattle (AP) — He is long and
lanky, 230 pounds of Illinois
farm boy stretched over a
6-foot-11 frame that is topped
off by a distinguishing mop of
blond, Prince Valiant-style
hair.
If the Seattle SuperSonics go
on to beat the Washington Bul
lets and win their first National
Basketball Association champ
ionship in the franchise's 12-
year history, it will be because
lack Sikma grew up in a hurry.
"He's very mature for a
young man of 23," said Seattle
teammate John Johnson. "I
guess playing in two champ
ionship series in two years,
against people like Wes Unseld
and Elvin Hayes, does that to
you."
In last year's finals, Sikma
played forward, where he did
battle against Hayes. This year,
as the starting center for the
Sonics, he has been exchang
ing pushes and shoves,
grimaces and grunts, with his
Washington counterpart, Un
seld. One look at Sikma after a

game tells you that going up
against UnseljJ is no easy task.
"After playing Wes, I'm a tired
man," said Sikma, who scored
21 points and grabbed 17 re
bounds Sunday as the Sonics
beat the Bullets 105-95 to take a
2-1 lead in the best-of-seven
final series, which resumes to
night. The bruises on Sikma's
pale skin and the sweat that
caked his hair confirmed that
self-diagnosis.
"When you play Wes, you've
got to use your strength more
than anything else," said
Sikma. "Wes is a strong player
who gets good position and
knows all the tricks. He's so
strong, I'm more tired after I
play him than anyone else."
Unseld stands 6-7 and is
listed at 245 pounds — al
though he probably weighs
more — and every ounce of it is
muscle. He most resembles a
huge block of granite, with one
vital difference: Unseld has el
bows and forearms, and 11
seasons of NBA pivot play have
taught him how to best utilize

those weapons.
Sikma, by contrast, is a babe
in the woods. This is only his
second pro season after being
a relatively unheralded first
round draft choice from Illinois
Wesleyan. He was a starting
forward and backup center as a
rookie and did not take over
the pivot job full time until Tom
LaGarde went down with a
knee injury in December.
Sikma finished the season as
the fifth-leading rebounder in
the NBA with 12.4 per game.
And his scoring average of 15.6
ranked third on the Sonics. He
was one of six players in the
league to score 1000 points and
grab 1000 rebounds.
Sikma's success is no sur
prise to Bullets coach Dick
Motta.
"I first saw him at the NAIA
tournament, where you have
32 teams playing in one day,"
recalled Motta. "I liked him
then and knew he would be a
good pro."
Sikma, who is nicknamed
"Banger" for the aggressive

way he hits the boards, is av
eraging 16.3 points and 13.3
rebounds in the finals. He has
earned Unseld's respect.
"I'm not surprised he's scor
ing because he has scored all
year long." said Unseld. "He's
nearly 7-feet tall, he shoots
well and he can usually turn
and get his shot off over me."
