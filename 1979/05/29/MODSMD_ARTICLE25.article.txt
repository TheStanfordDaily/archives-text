# Mears wins Indianapolis 500
## 
### 
Indianapolis (AP) — It's been
a fast trip to the top, but all
whiz-kid Rick Mears can see
from the racing world's highest
perch is a long road ahead and
little time to rest.
"Winning this race is what
the sport is all about, but it
doesn't mean you've got time
to relax," the Bakersfield,
California, resident said yes
terday after an I'/i-hour photo
and autograph session at the

Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
"Now I'm going home for a
few days but I'm already think
ing about my next race," he
said "I'll go after victory in that
one at Trenton, N.J., on June 10
just as hard as I went after this
one."
Mears, who was to learn
what his share would be from
the $1 million purse at the tradi
tional Victory Banquet late yes
terday, has moved rapidly to

the upper echelons of auto rac
ing.
His racing career began with
motorcycles and dune buggies
about a decade ago, while a
California teen-ager thriving
on spaghetti and pranks. And
he still does both, says Dina,
his wife of seven years.
"I remember right after we
were married, he kept me run
ning for almost an hour hold
ing a frog in his hand. We have

a lot of them around our home
and he still fools around with
them because he knows they
scare me," she said yesterday
as she lounged near the track.
Sunday's victory was only his
second start in the race, which
he won before a crowd of more
than 300,000 fans who jammed
the Speedway.
Veteran A.). Foyt, the only
driver to win here four times
and the second-place finisher
behind Mears in Sunday's 63rd
running of the Indy 500, is one
of those who predicts a bright
future for the 27-year-old.
"If he gets the right breaks
he could be the A.J. of the 80s,"
said Foyt earlier this month.
Mears only led the racefor2s
of its 200 laps. He gained the
lead for good with 19 laps to go
when teammate Bobby Unser
slowed down after losing his
fourth gear.
Unser, who was leading at
the time, finished fifth in his
bid to win here for the third
time. Mike Mosley, who re
corded his best performance in
12 starts here was third.
It was the first time Mosley
finished higher than 10th since
his first start in 1968. He
finished less than three sec
onds behind Foyt, who coasted
past the finish line after his
motor quit.
Danny Ongais, who survived
a crash which destroyed his
team's top car on May 12,
finished fourth after starting
from the ninth row.
Cordon Johncock, the 1973
winner, was sixth while Howdy
Holmes took seventh in his
first ride here.
