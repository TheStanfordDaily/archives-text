# Golfer Watson takes a break
## 
### 
Dublin, Ohio (AP) — There's some good news
for golf's touring pros: Tom Watson is taking a
couple of weeks off.
"The U.S. Open is my next tournament, and
I'm really looking forward to it," Watson, a Stan
ford graduate, said after scoring his fourth vic
tory of the season in the Memorial Coif Tour
nament.
"I've had a chance to win it twice. That's the
one I really want to win, the one I've been look
ing forward to all year," Watson said. "It's nice
to be going into it with the idea you're playing
well."
And, said host lack Nicklaus, no one really
knows how well Watson is playing.
"There is no telling how well Tom could have
played this week if someone had pressed him,"
Nicklaus said Sunday.
But no one did.
He started the gloomy, cloudy, final round
with a 4-stroke lead, built it to 7 at one point and
eventually won with ease by a 3-shot margin. He
had a final round of 71 and, at 3-under-par 285
was the only man in the field to break par on
Nicklaus' demanding Muirfield Village Coif
Club course.
And Nicklaus, long the dominant player in the
game, hailed Watson as the new No. 1.
"Tom's playing so much better than anyone
else in the game, his confidence is so much
better than anyone else in the game today, it

seems he would have to play poorly for anyone
to beat him," Nicklaus said.
And the recent record supports that state
ment.
Watson now has won four times this season
and been second in four other events. In 14
starts, he's been sixth or better 10 times. He's
averaging more than $25,000 in winnings each
start. So with him skipping the next two weeks,
there's another $50,000 available for the other
pros.
In the 2% years since the start of the 1977
season, he has won 14 times, including the 1977
British Open. In that period he has collected
$1,026,956 — the fastest any player has ever won
$1 million.
He now has $353,874 for the year with 8 to 10
tournaments yet to play. That total is exceeded
only by the $362,429 he won last year. His win
nings are almost double those of the No. 2 man,
Lanny Wadkins ($177,773).
Miller Barber, a 48-year-old veteran and the
only man with any chance at all to catch Watson
in the final round, eventually finished second in
the Memorial, shooting a final 70 for 288.
Nicklaus had a terrible last round, shooting
79. He finished at 299 and still has not won this
year.
But, said Watson, "the Nicklaus era is not
over. He's the greatest ever to play the game.
He's too good not to win again."
