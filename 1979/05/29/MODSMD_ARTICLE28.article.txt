# Freeze-dried books returning to Meyer Basement shelves

### Tom Woolf 
The books are returning to the shelves of the Meyer
Basement Library in the aftermath of the November 4
flood.
Sally Buchanan, the new conservation officer for the
libraries here, said she hopes that 80 percent of the
damaged books in all subject areas will be back on the
shelves by autumn quarter.
The flood began when a broken pipe poured water
into Meyer Basement and soaked about 45,000 books in
varying degrees.
The books were immediately transported to commer
cial freezers in San Jose to prevent further damage by
mold or mildew. They were then freeze-dried in vacuum
chambers provided by the Lockheed Aircraft Corpora
tion. That process was completed on March 12.
"On the whole," Buchanan said, "the vacuum process
did a good job in helping to preserve the paper."
From the chambers provided by Lockheed, the books
have been taken to Old Terman Junior High School in
Palo Alto. Each book is being cleaned. It is then re-

turned, rebound or held for more extensive repairs,
according to Buchanan.
"So far approximately 12,000 books have (been) re
turned (to Meyer Basement)," Buchanan said, "and 1500
to 2500 books a week are going back." Of these "not
more than several hundred" needed to be replaced,
Buchanan said.
In fact, the reconditioning process has worked so well
that there are "many, many books that only an expert
would be able to tell were damaged in the flood,"
Buchanan said.
The success of this process owes much to the "quick
actions of the Stanford community," Buchanan said.
Students banded together with librarians and faculty
members to load the books on trucks which transported
all the books to freezers within 48 hours after the flood.
It was through their help that "we managed to preserve
these books in as good condition as we have," she said.
Students are still needed to help restack books in
Meyer Basement, according to Buchanan, "The faster
the books get back on the shelf, the faster they'll be
available for use."
