# DC-10s grounded by FAA
## Air crash death count may rise 
### 
Chicago (AP) — An infant and a very young
child were among those killed in the nation's
worst airline disaster — babies who may not
have been listed as passengers and included in
the count of 273 dead, authorities said yester
day.
Dr. Robert Stein, the Cook County medical
examiner, said yesterday that he has seen the
bodies of "an infant and a very young child" in
the temporary morgue set up in an American
Airlines hangar.
But an American spokesman said shortly after
Stein's news conference that the airline knew
of no infants aboard Flight 191, which crashed
Friday after leaving O'Hare International Air
port.
Stein said he didn't know if the discovery of
the infant's and the young child's bodies raised
the death count, or if the two were listed among
the passengers and crew.
None of the 271 persons aboard American
Airlines Flight 191 from Chicago to Los Angeles
survived the crash. Two persons on the ground
were killed when the jumbo jet rolled over on
its side just seconds after take-off and flew into
the ground, crashing on her nose and a wingtip
and flashing into flame.
The plane's left engine tore loose and
smashed down on an O'Hare runway before
the crash, and investigators are trying to deter
mine how the loss of the engine was connected

to the crash. A broken bolt from the engine
mounting was found in grass beside the run
way, and its loss apparently caused the engine
to fall off.
At the crash site Monday, Elwood "Woody"
Driver, vice chairman of the National Transpor
tation Safety Board, said the two remaining en
gines on Flight 191 were "at full power" when
the crash occurred. He said the two engines
should have provided sufficient power to keep
the DC-10 in the air.
"We have found what caused the left engine
to fall off," said Driver, referring to the broken
bold. "But we have not found for sure what
caused the plane to crash."
Driver said it may take two to four months to
complete the investigation.
Langhorne Bond, head of the Federal Avia
tion Administration, said he believed it would
have been impossible for any pilot to bring the
crippled plane under control and coax it to a
safe emergency landing.
Several aviation officials have said since the
accident that the airplane should have been
able to fly without one of its engines.
"That comment is not correct," Bond said at a
new conference yesterday.
"There is no licensing or certification process
of any sort to provide for an aircraft flying with
out an engine. Itwould unquestionably fly, and
very safely, without power from the engine,"

said Bond, emphasizing the word "power."
But there is not certification procedure for
flying without a whole engine assembly," said
Bond, himself a pilot. "There is no pilot training
to deal with that eventuality; no aircraft has
ever been in the air under those circumstances.
There is no reason to think that once that en
gine came off the airframe, that it would fly."
Meanwhile, maintenance workers at airlines
using DC-10s were busy yesterday inspecting or
replacing the bolts that hold the wing engines
on the giant aircraft, but little of no delay in
service was expected, spokesmen for the com
panies said.
In some cases, the inspections began before
the Federal Aviation Administration issued its
order yeserday requiring all U.S. operated
DC-10 jetliners to undergo the inspection or be
grounded by midnight yesterday, PDT. accord
ing to the spokesmen.
The order was based on an "alert service bul
letin" issued Sunday to users of the plane by
the manufacturer of the DC-10, McDonnell-
Douglas.
That company is standing behind its aircraft,
according to Don Hanson, a spokesman for the
company.
The DC-10 has been involved in two previous
fatal incidents before Friday's Chicago crash,
Hanson said.
