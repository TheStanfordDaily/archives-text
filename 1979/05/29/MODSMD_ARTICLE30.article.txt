Israel releases Arab prisoners
Jerusalem — Israel released 16 Arab prisoners yester
day as a goodwill gesture to Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat, and three Israeli navy ships prepared to pass
through the Suez Canal in another symbolic step toward
normalized relations between the former enemies.
Sadat said yesterday that Egyptian and Israeli ministers
would start working immediately on procedures for
opening the borders between the two countries, saying
it would give "momentum to the peace process."
Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
accompanied by Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, agreed
to the open-border policy and release of prisoners dur
ing a series of meetings Sunday.
The Israelis did not identify the released prisoners,
but said 10 had been held in administrative detention
without specific charges. The six remaining prisoners
were listed as minor offenders, meaning they had been
convicted by military courts of security offenses not
involving the loss of life.
Nine of the detainees were released into the West
Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip or northern
Sinai, an Israeli military spokesman said. The other
seven detainees were sent to Egypt, the spokesman said.
Israeli sources indicated that other Arab prisoners
may be released soon.
Three landing craft, the first Israeli navy vessels to
enter the Suez Canal under the Israeli-Egyptian peace
treaty, arrived at the canal's southern entrance en route
to an Israeli port on the Mediterranean.
An Israeli civilian cargo vessel, the Ashdod, made the
passage on April 28 with a crew of 22, but no cargo.
Sadat, speaking to reporters yesterday, did not make
clear how freely Egyptians and Israelis will be able to
cross the open border. Egyptian officials said they inter
preted the agreement "in the narrowest limits" as mean
ing that official groups may pass freely between the two
countries. They said it does not mean immediate unre
stricted border crossings for Israeli and Egyptian civi
lians.
Chemical pesticide tank explodes
Pittsburg, Ca. — A newly installed 600-gallon tank used
in making pesticides will remain closed indefinitely after
a weekend explosion killed two men and injured 101
others, Dow Chemical Co. said yesterday.
"The chemical reaction was thoroughly researched
and tested," said Jack Jones, public relations director at
Dow's plant 35 miles northeast of San Francisco.
"We're baffled," he added. "We thought we knew
everything about it."
Three teams of Dow researchers were called in to
attempt to find the cause of Saturday's blast. The
California Occupational Safety and Health Administra
tion also sent investigators.
The tank that exploded was used to heat iron powder
and liquid chlorine to produce ferric chloride, a chemi
cal used in making pesticides.
For unexplained reasons, Dow officials said the temp
erature in the tank suddenly jumped from a normal 284
degrees t0464 degrees. The resulting explosion spewed
metal fragments and chemical fumes. Damage was esti
mated at $1 million.
Monte Manwill, business manager of the Interna
tional Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and As
bestos Workers Local 16, which represents 65 plant
workers, said there had been leaks at the tank on two
separate occasions before the explosion.
He said the leaks had made five men ill.
Jones denied their had been reports of previous leaks.
Jack Simon Wright, 48, of Oakley, said Gabriel Mar

tinez, 64, of San Francisco were killed in the explosion.
The injured were treated at local hospitals and most of
them were released.
House liberals battle target budget
Washington — House liberals, still upset with the 1980
target budget, are vowing to carry their butter-over-guns
battle into the next phase of the congressional budget
process: the appropriations bills.
When the House returns from its Memorial Day break
tomorrow, the Appropriations Committee will begin
churning out those bills to pay for government programs
in fiscal 1980, which starts Oct. 1.
And leading liberals made it clear last week that they
will try to amend the House money bills to reduce
spending for defense and boost it for social programs.
House liberals had joined with conservatives, upset
with continued deficit spending, to block temporarily
approval of the $532 billion target budget last week. It
was finally passed Thursday by a six-vote margin.
Although the target budget only sets tentative spend
ing levels for broad categories of government programs,
its approval last week was necessary before Congress
could begin appropriating money.
The 1980 target budget closely parallels President
jimmy Carter's spending recommendations.
The House will also return from its Memorial Day
break to continued debate over the president's plan to
phase out domestic oil pricecontrols starting Friday. The
decontrol is expected to lead to higher oil and gas
prices.
Despite an overwhelming vote in the House Democra
tic Caucus last week against the president's decision,
decontrol opponents concede they will be unable to
block the action before Friday.
However, aides to Rep. Toby Moffett (D-Conn.) say he
will try to tack an amendment onto an Energy Depart
ment authorization bill this summer that would restore
controls.
Fast-spreading fire kills six
Westwood, Mass. — A fast-spreading fire swept
through a three-story house in this Boston suburb yes
terday morning, killing a man and his five young chil
dren and seriously injuring his wife.
Another woman and her two daughters, who lived in
an apartment on the first floor, escaped the flames, fire
officials reported.
The dead were identified as Robert Harrison, 36; and
his children, Michelle, 10; Robert, 7; Patrick, 4; Katie, 3;
and Teddy, 2.
Catherine Harrison, 34, was listed in poorcondition in
the intensive care unit at nearby Norwood Hospital suf
fering from smoke inhalation.
The Harrisons' paper boy, returning from his morning
route, saw the smoke and heard Mrs. Harrison scream
ing for help from a third-floor window of the
Washington Street home.
The youth, Brian Roach, 13, said he tried to get Mrs.
Harrison to crawl along a ledge toward the front of the
house to the roof of a porch. Another neighbor joined
him and urged the woman to throw the children out to
him, Brian said.
