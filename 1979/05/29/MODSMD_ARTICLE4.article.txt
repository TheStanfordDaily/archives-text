# Food costs here to rise 9.1% next year

Benjamin Franklin once said that
"in this world nothing is certain but
death and taxes." Among many other
inevitabilities Franklin could have
listed is rising food prices. Next
year's University board rates will rise
9.1 percent to keep pace with the
inflationary spiral of food costs, and
the situation here is by no means ex
ceptional.
Next year's board rates will be
$1351 for the 19-meal-per-week plan,
$1270 for the 14-meal-per-week plan
and $1189 for the 10-meal-per-week
plan, according to University Food
Service Manager Maxine Anderson.
The 150 food service companies
dishing out meals to some 3100
schools and colleges across the
country are feeling the pinch as well.
Although nearly 11 million students
provide a market worth about $2 bill
ion a year, companies that forecasted
8 percent increases in their own costs

over the past year were hit with a 15
percent rise in food costs.
According to restaurant industry
statistics, the Food Cost Index (FCI),
which reflects price changes for
goods sold in primary markets and is
weighted to reflect the relative im
portance of specific commodities in
average restaurant food purchases,
advanced 5.7 percent in 1977, 11.2
percent in 1978 and during the first
three months of this year rose 17 per
cent, according to a report by the
National Restaurant Association.
This figure compares with Univer
sity Food Service estimate of a 19.5
percent increase in food costs alone.
According to statistics recently re
leased by the food service here, bet
ween May 1978 and May 1979 prices
for roast beef rose 36 percent,
cheese 30 percent, pork chops and
peanut butter 15 percent and to--
mato sauce 16 percent.
Just how do the University and

other schools cope with these soar
ing prices? While some food service
companies are trying to recoup their
losses by cutting costs and negotiat
ing better contracts, others are
abandoning contracts where costs
have risen faster than the prices they
negotiated up to 16 months ago, ac
cording to an article in the April 23
issue of Business Week.
More and more companies are in
sisting on contracts with escalator
clauses to allow for inflation. Saga
Corp., one of the nation's largest
food catering services, is experi
menting with credit cards and other
"pay-for-what-you-eat" systems, in
lieu of the usual flat board rate, ac
cording to Business Week.
Improvements are also being
made in management and merchan
dising. ARA Food Services Co. of
Philadelphia, the nation's largest in
stitutional feeder, has launched a
computerized food purchasing,

production and service system that it
claims has cut costs as much as 18
percent. The system involves portion
control and new ways of determining
how students will choose from a mul
tiple choice menu, Business Week
said.
Saga has initiated a waste education
program for students, who do not eat
up to 5 percent of the food they take,
Business Week also said.
Anderson said she believes that
"asking students to cut down on
waste" would result in substantial
savings. The food service is also try
ing to reduce costs by serving more
fish and chicken instead of beef, said
Anderson.
The University is able to meet costs
every year through the profits it
makes in serving food to summer
conferences. "We try to make
money on the conferences so that we
can give it back to the students," said
Anderson.
