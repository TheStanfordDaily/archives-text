# University debaters win highest honors in Berkeley competition
##

Last year the team from Stanford
left with moose antlers. This year's
team of Paul Cassell and Brett Kings
tone left with top honors to give
Stanford its first win in three years
over UC-Berkeley in theB3rd Voltaire
Debate.
Cassell captured first place, while
his partner Kingstone received sec
ond in this annual event between
Stanford and Berkeley.
The Voltaire Debate is the oldest
collegiate debate in the United
States, and Berkeley currently leads
the series 42-41.
Sponsored in part by the French
consulate in San Francisco, the de
bate was established to honor the
French writer Voltaire. Each year a
topic is chosen that relates to France.
This year's debate resolution was
that France should rejoin NATO.
Stanford argued the negative posi
tion.
Lacks program
Because Stanford lacks a formal
debate program, the intensity,
though not the quality, of the Vol
taire Debates has diminished. Last
November during Big Came Week a
make-up debate was held, and the
Stanford debaters entered Ber
keley's Evans Auditorium wearing
moose antlers and Big Came buttons
and carrying golf bags and irrelevant
books such as the Hite Report.
Kingstone explained, "I guess they
were caught up with Big Came Week
and presenting the Stanford image.
Still, they debated hard, but Berkeley
won."
Unlike Stanford, Berkeley does
have a debate program. According to
Cassell, Berkeley spends about
$10,000 to $20,000 a year, includ
ing salaries for a coach and four assis
tants. Kingstone said, "I was very im
pressed by the debaters from Ber
keley. You could tell they had
academic training. They were very
fluent and had good arguments."
Cassell and Kingstone did not re

ceive coaching or any of the other
benefits of a debate program. In fact,
before the Voltaire Debates, Kings
tone said he had never debated, al
though he had done much public
speaking.
His success, he explained, is due
to the great help he received from his
partner Paul, whom he praised as an
excellent debater.
Without a debate program, Stan
ford was very fortunate to have won
this year, let alone participate. For if
Cassell and Kingstone had not en
tered, there might not have been any
Stanford representatives. Cassell
said he believes that the disinterest
in debate here will continue unless
there is funding and a department to
support a program.
Kingstone, an ASSU senator, said
he plans to remedy the situation at
this Thursday's senate meeting. Act
ing on a suggestion from Political
Science Prof. Robert Horn, Kings
tone plans to submit a resolution cal
ling for the University to include
rhetoric and public speaking courses
in its undergraduate curriculum.
Circulate petition
He said he also intends to circulate
a petition calling for similar action
and will present it to Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadou
rian.
Kingstone explained, "These
courses would benefit the Stanford
student body as a whole. Many stu
dents will be in positions in the fu
ture that will require such speaking
skills."
Because of the rule preventing first
place finishers from returning, Cas
sell will not be able to compete in
next year's 84th Voltaire Debate.
Kingstone will return, however.
"Nextyearthe series will be 42 t042.1
can promise you that," Kingstone
said. If he succeeds, he'll join not
only Cassell, but also such past Stan
ford winners as U.S. Senator Frank
Church and Congressman Pete
McCloskey.
