## Balanced nuclear approach needed 
### 
The sun is a nuclear reactor.
More precisely, it is a
gravitationally-contained,
protium-fueled, thermonuc
lear fusion reactor.
In the wake of the Three Mile
Island accident, and given the
tendency of many anti-nuclear
groups to portray the sun as
totally safe and beneficent, it is
worth briefly considering the
very substantial dangers due to
the sun.
Radiation from the sun
yearly produces first-degree
burns, sunburn, in millions of
people; it often produces
more severe burns and occa
sionally produces severe ef
fects leading to death. Pro
longed exposure to the sun's
radiation can lead to skin
cancer and, ultimately, death.
Enormous explosions
known as solar flares occasion
ally erupt on the sun's surface
and emit high-energy sub
atomic particles (solar cosmic
rays) which, on reaching the
earth, can induce mutations in
human genetic material.
No shielding
There is no shielding what
soever around the sun. What
little shielding we possess
around the earth is made up
largely of a layer of the atmos
phere consisting of an unstable
form of oxygen (ozone). Many
scientists believe this ozone
layer to be so fragile that it can
be endangered by a small con
centration of fluorocarbons
commonly used, until re
cently, as propellants in
aerosol cans.
Nor is there, of course, any
containment system or shut
down mechanism for the sun.
Numerous nuclear reactors of
similar construction to the sun
have in fact been observed to
explode in enormous explo
sions known as novae and
supernovae: the result of such
an explosion by the sun would
be the demise of the human
race.
If one is willing to unques
tioningly believe the experts in
such matters, astrophysicists,
one can be assured that the sun
is safe from such explosions;
however, the experts' theories
have proven less than perfect
and are, in fact, in contradic
tion with the results of current
experiment (the so-called
"solar neutrino experiment").
Every dav dangers
The point of listing these
dangers is not to inaugurate
an anti-solar movement but to
emphasize the real and sub
stantial dangers with which we
unthinkingly live every day.
All human activities, includ
ing the production, transporta

tion and use of energy, are
dangerous. Thousands of
people have died as the result
of the collapse of hydroelectric
dams, natural gas explosions
and pollution due the burning
of gasoline and coal. A recent
controversial study reported in
Science (February 29) suggests
that some "soft" energy
sources, such as wind and solar
power, may involve total risks
substantially greater than the
risks accompanying natural
gas, hydroelectricity or nuclear
power.
A rational debate on nuclear
power should be concerned
with the relative dangers, costs
and benefits of nuclear energy
as compared to alternatives
(including conservation).
Irrational approach
The often irrational ap
proach to questions of nuclear
safety tends to overshadow
important political questions
which should be (but rarely
are) raised concerning the nuc
lear industry.
In its origin and develop
ment, nuclear energy is the
child of the American state.
That tie of filiation must be se
vered.
All government subsidies to
any stage of the nuclear
industry-research and de
velopment, fuel processing,
waste disposal, etc. — should
be ended.
The Price-Anderson Act,
which limits the liability of a
nuclear company in the event

of a major disaster, should be
immediately repealed. If the
chance of a major disaster is as
small as the nuclear industry
maintains, the industry should
be willing to bear the financial
risks or buy the insurance to
cover a disaster.
If the chance of a disaster is
so high as to make such risk
bearing by the industry un
economical, then nuclear
plants should not be operated
or built.
End government franchises
The practice of govern
ment's granting monopoly
franchises to power companies
and regulating the companies
via compliant public utility
commissions should be en
ded. The current system allows
power companies to pass on to
their customers the cost of
constructing new facilities
(nuclear or otherwise) without
regard to whether such con
struction is economically jus
tified.
The umbrella provided the
nuclear industry by the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission
should be removed. At pre
sent, private persons or groups
believing a reactor to be unsafe
must either work through the
regulatory process or chal
lenge the commission in court
on the grounds of procedural
irregularities or capacious
ness. Given the inevitable ties
between an agency and the in
dustry it regulates, the proba
ble outcome of the existing

system is obvious.
The appropriate reform is to
abolish the NRC and to allow
private persons or groups to
sue a utility directly on the sub
stantive grounds that it im
poses upon them a risk sub
stantially higher than the nor
mal background risks of every
day life.
The power companies —
nuclear or conventional —
should be stripped of their
special privileges, subjected to
a regime of strict liability, and
compelled to submit to the
rigors of laissez-faire
capitalism.

capitalism.

The sun is a nuclear reactor.
More precisely, it is a
gravitationally-contained,
protium-fueled, thermonuc
lear fusion reactor.
In the wake of the Three Mile
Island accident, and given the
tendency of many anti-nuclear
groups to portray the sun as
totally safe and beneficent, it is
worth briefly considering the
very substantial dangers due to
the sun.
Radiation from the sun
yearly produces first-degree
burns, sunburn, in millions of
people; it often produces
more severe burns and occa
sionally produces severe ef
fects leading to death. Pro
longed exposure to the sun's
radiation can lead to skin
cancer and, ultimately, death.
Enormous explosions
known as solar flares occasion
ally erupt on the sun's surface
and emit high-energy sub
atomic particles (solar cosmic
rays) which, on reaching the
earth, can induce mutations in
human genetic material.
No shielding
There is no shielding what
soever around the sun. What
little shielding we possess
around the earth is made up
largely of a layer of the atmos
phere consisting of an unstable
form of oxygen (ozone). Many
scientists believe this ozone
layer to be so fragile that it can
be endangered by a small con
centration of fluorocarbons
commonly used, until re
cently, as propellants in
aerosol cans.
Nor is there, of course, any
containment system or shut
down mechanism for the sun.
Numerous nuclear reactors of
similar construction to the sun
have in fact been observed to
explode in enormous explo
sions known as novae and
supernovae: the result of such
an explosion by the sun would
be the demise of the human
race.
If one is willing to unques
tioningly believe the experts in
such matters, astrophysicists,
one can be assured that the sun
is safe from such explosions;
however, the experts' theories
have proven less than perfect
and are, in fact, in contradic
tion with the results of current
experiment (the so-called
"solar neutrino experiment").
Every dav dangers
The point of listing these
dangers is not to inaugurate
an anti-solar movement but to
emphasize the real and sub
stantial dangers with which we
unthinkingly live every day.
All human activities, includ
ing the production, transporta

tion and use of energy, are
dangerous. Thousands of
people have died as the result
of the collapse of hydroelectric
dams, natural gas explosions
and pollution due the burning
of gasoline and coal. A recent
controversial study reported in
Science (February 29) suggests
that some "soft" energy
sources, such as wind and solar
power, may involve total risks
substantially greater than the
risks accompanying natural
gas, hydroelectricity or nuclear
power.
A rational debate on nuclear
power should be concerned
with the relative dangers, costs
and benefits of nuclear energy
as compared to alternatives
(including conservation).
Irrational approach
The often irrational ap
proach to questions of nuclear
safety tends to overshadow
important political questions
which should be (but rarely
are) raised concerning the nuc
lear industry.
In its origin and develop
ment, nuclear energy is the
child of the American state.
That tie of filiation must be se
vered.
All government subsidies to
any stage of the nuclear
industry-research and de
velopment, fuel processing,
waste disposal, etc. — should
be ended.
The Price-Anderson Act,
which limits the liability of a
nuclear company in the event

of a major disaster, should be
immediately repealed. If the
chance of a major disaster is as
small as the nuclear industry
maintains, the industry should
be willing to bear the financial
risks or buy the insurance to
cover a disaster.
If the chance of a disaster is
so high as to make such risk
bearing by the industry un
economical, then nuclear
plants should not be operated
or built.
End government franchises
The practice of govern
ment's granting monopoly
franchises to power companies
and regulating the companies
via compliant public utility
commissions should be en
ded. The current system allows
power companies to pass on to
their customers the cost of
constructing new facilities
(nuclear or otherwise) without
regard to whether such con
struction is economically jus
tified.
The umbrella provided the
nuclear industry by the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission
should be removed. At pre
sent, private persons or groups
believing a reactor to be unsafe
must either work through the
regulatory process or chal
lenge the commission in court
on the grounds of procedural
irregularities or capacious
ness. Given the inevitable ties
between an agency and the in
dustry it regulates, the proba
ble outcome of the existing

system is obvious.
The appropriate reform is to
abolish the NRC and to allow
private persons or groups to
sue a utility directly on the sub
stantive grounds that it im
poses upon them a risk sub
stantially higher than the nor
mal background risks of every
day life.
The power companies —
nuclear or conventional —
should be stripped of their
special privileges, subjected to
a regime of strict liability, and
compelled to submit to the
rigors of laissez-faire
capitalism.
