Comments on:
—Lise Giraud's article on the
Franklin case (Daily, May 23).
Bravo, Lise! You have my vote
as spokesperson for sanity
and justice any day. Your
editorial makes me wonder if I
am a valued employee or
merely another tax deduction
to cover the University's other
"pursuits."
—Patricia Nabti's editorial on Is
rael being sheltered from criti
cism. Right on! I mentioned
once to a Jewish friend of mine
of what I saw to be fascist ten
dencies in Israeli society. She
didn't speak to me for a week.
—The ludicrous debate over
homosexuality being a sin. The
Bible was written by men
(notorious homophobes) —
supposedly inspired by the
Holy Spirit, but as humans
surely with their own bias. That
being the case, I don't put too
much stock in the truth as per
that particular edition of the

Good Book, especially the Old
Testament.
I believe in a wise and loving
God who wants more for his/
her children than this level of
inanity (insanity!). Christ
didn't make any comments on
the subject of homosexuality
but he seemed to cover all the
bases when he said, "Let those
who are without sin cast the
first stone." And that was in de
fense of an adulteress!
Surely we have more impor
tant issues to debate than
whether homosexuals are sin
ners. That's about as relevant
as how many angels danced on
the head of a pin. I, too, hope
we don't need another Gay
Awareness Week. Rather, I
would prefer to see gays incor
porated into society as the
worthwhile human beings that
theyare. Surely this represents
God's love.

Indirect adieu
It is no campus secret that
numerous Planning Office staff
members, including myself,
have been fired by the Busi
ness and Finance Office, effec
tive August 31, ostensibly be
cause of reorganization and
zero-base budgeting.
I wish to explain why I, for
one, will be leaving Stanford
on that date, presumably with
out official recognition of my
departure or of my contribu
tions here, such as they may
have been, over the past 23
years.
A proverbial "gold-watch re
tirement" send-off would be
inappropriate because I'm not
ready to retire, don't want to
and have no intention of doing
so. I could not participate
graciously in this type of
travesty, nor embarrass my
friends by expecting them to
attend. An anniversary recog
nition event with commenda
tions for two decades of devo
tion to the University would be
equally out of place under the
circumstances.
Consequently, before I "just
fade away" like one of Douglas
Mac Arthur's aging generals, I
want to express my apprecia
tion of and. aftectuon for the
many faculty, staff and stu
dents it has been my pleasure
and privilege to have worked
with over the years.
The glowing memories of
ourstimulating give-and-takes,
plus my belief that the campus
is a better place because
of these tussles, is some
thing that can never be wiped
out by the Business and Fi
nance Office's insensitive man
ipulations. I am happy to be
able to say that I do not as
sociate the entire University
with what is being done to the
Planning Office.
I hope you, my friends and
colleagues, will understand
the reason for this indirect
adieu through the columns of

our campus periodical, and
why I am communicating with
you now before the end of this
quarter. When you return next
fall to continue the University's
mission, I shan't be here. Cod
bless you all.

Mean spirit
In what strikes me as a re
markably mean-spirited com
munication to The Stanford
Daily, Soviet "defector" Vladis
lav Krasnov hinted that activist
Angela Davis is one of "their"
spies.
He used a technique of in
nuendo that reaches down to
the standards set 30 years ago
by the unspeakable Richard
Nixon and the late Sen. Joe
McCarthy by suggesting that
we might advantageously ex
change "our home-grown
malcontents: Angela Davis,
Jane Fonda, Bella Abzug and,
for good measure, Daniel
Ellsberg" for an equal number
of Soviet dissidents.
One wonders what Krasnov
has "defected" from. Certainly
his letter shows no under
standing whatsoever of the
principles on which this nation
was founded.
Reading between the lines,
we can guess how Kraznov
would deal with critics of gov
ernment policy in the United
States, were his hands free.
I suggest that before Krasnov
uses the 'chummy first
person-pfural-possessive ad
jective "our" again, in a like
connexion, he learn a bit more
about what "we" — a good
many of us at least — stand for
in this country.
Krasnov might begin by
studying the Bill of Rights, al
though I fear that he will find it
a subversive document, en
tirely too tolerant of the rights
of "malcontents" to speak out.

I suggest that before Krasnov
uses the 'chummy first
person-pfural-possessive ad
jective "our" again, in a like
connexion, he learn a bit more
about what "we" — a good
many of us at least — stand for
in this country.
Krasnov might begin by
studying the Bill of Rights, al
though I fear that he will find it
a subversive document, en
tirely too tolerant of the rights
of "malcontents" to speak out.

Comments on:
—Lise Giraud's article on the
Franklin case (Daily, May 23).
Bravo, Lise! You have my vote
as spokesperson for sanity
and justice any day. Your
editorial makes me wonder if I
am a valued employee or
merely another tax deduction
to cover the University's other
"pursuits."
—Patricia Nabti's editorial on Is
rael being sheltered from criti
cism. Right on! I mentioned
once to a Jewish friend of mine
of what I saw to be fascist ten
dencies in Israeli society. She
didn't speak to me for a week.
—The ludicrous debate over
homosexuality being a sin. The
Bible was written by men
(notorious homophobes) —
supposedly inspired by the
Holy Spirit, but as humans
surely with their own bias. That
being the case, I don't put too
much stock in the truth as per
that particular edition of the

Good Book, especially the Old
Testament.
I believe in a wise and loving
God who wants more for his/
her children than this level of
inanity (insanity!). Christ
didn't make any comments on
the subject of homosexuality
but he seemed to cover all the
bases when he said, "Let those
who are without sin cast the
first stone." And that was in de
fense of an adulteress!
Surely we have more impor
tant issues to debate than
whether homosexuals are sin
ners. That's about as relevant
as how many angels danced on
the head of a pin. I, too, hope
we don't need another Gay
Awareness Week. Rather, I
would prefer to see gays incor
porated into society as the
worthwhile human beings that
theyare. Surely this represents
God's love.

Indirect adieu
It is no campus secret that
numerous Planning Office staff
members, including myself,
have been fired by the Busi
ness and Finance Office, effec
tive August 31, ostensibly be
cause of reorganization and
zero-base budgeting.
I wish to explain why I, for
one, will be leaving Stanford
on that date, presumably with
out official recognition of my
departure or of my contribu
tions here, such as they may
have been, over the past 23
years.
A proverbial "gold-watch re
tirement" send-off would be
inappropriate because I'm not
ready to retire, don't want to
and have no intention of doing
so. I could not participate
graciously in this type of
travesty, nor embarrass my
friends by expecting them to
attend. An anniversary recog
nition event with commenda
tions for two decades of devo
tion to the University would be
equally out of place under the
circumstances.
Consequently, before I "just
fade away" like one of Douglas
Mac Arthur's aging generals, I
want to express my apprecia
tion of and. aftectuon for the
many faculty, staff and stu
dents it has been my pleasure
and privilege to have worked
with over the years.
The glowing memories of
ourstimulating give-and-takes,
plus my belief that the campus
is a better place because
of these tussles, is some
thing that can never be wiped
out by the Business and Fi
nance Office's insensitive man
ipulations. I am happy to be
able to say that I do not as
sociate the entire University
with what is being done to the
Planning Office.
I hope you, my friends and
colleagues, will understand
the reason for this indirect
adieu through the columns of

our campus periodical, and
why I am communicating with
you now before the end of this
quarter. When you return next
fall to continue the University's
mission, I shan't be here. Cod
bless you all.

Mean spirit
In what strikes me as a re
markably mean-spirited com
munication to The Stanford
Daily, Soviet "defector" Vladis
lav Krasnov hinted that activist
Angela Davis is one of "their"
spies.
He used a technique of in
nuendo that reaches down to
the standards set 30 years ago
by the unspeakable Richard
Nixon and the late Sen. Joe
McCarthy by suggesting that
we might advantageously ex
change "our home-grown
malcontents: Angela Davis,
Jane Fonda, Bella Abzug and,
for good measure, Daniel
Ellsberg" for an equal number
of Soviet dissidents.
One wonders what Krasnov
has "defected" from. Certainly
his letter shows no under
standing whatsoever of the
principles on which this nation
was founded.
Reading between the lines,
we can guess how Kraznov
would deal with critics of gov
ernment policy in the United
States, were his hands free.
I suggest that before Krasnov
uses the 'chummy first
person-pfural-possessive ad
jective "our" again, in a like
connexion, he learn a bit more
about what "we" — a good
