## Mideast issue distorted 
### 
Misconceptions and exaggerations are no
thing new to either side of the Palestinian-Israeli
question, but I find Yehuda Koren's (Daily, May
24) colossal distortion of the situation offensive.
His claim that Jordan is home to the Palesti
nians is baseless. Jordan, a historical nonentity
created by British imperial legerdemain, could
barely support its own pre-1948 population and
does not want to be home to those whom Koren
persists in labeling "so-called" Palestinians, as if
the adjective could erase their origin.
In 1947, there were more than a million Pales
tinian Arabs; simply because of Israeli con
quest, are they supposed to change their citi
zenship, their allegiance and their residence to
Jordan? Should Jordan perhaps be consulted?
In any case, Jordan is only 10 percent arable,
and is incapable of supporting the entire Pales
tinian community. None of this prevents Koren
from graciously granting that the Palestinians
can have all the rights and privileges of citizen

ship "in their own land." (Here I assume he
means Jordan, regardless of the fact that these
people were born in Jerusalem, Jaffa and
Bethlehem, or that their families may have lived
in "so-called" Israel for hundreds of years).
A further flaw in Koren's article — one shared
by others on both sides of the dispute — is that
he tries to make the Israeli stance towards the
Palestinians more palatable by citing Arab mis
treatment of Jews. Exposing repression by "the
other side" does not justify one's own mis
deeds. Indeed, if such accusations could justify
their own violations of human rights, both the
Israelis and the Palestinians would be singularly
blameless peoples.
Perhaps I am the stooge of Arab propaganda,
but it would seem to me that Koren, as an Israeli
activist, should come to terms with the grie
vances of the' Palestinians, instead of distorting
and inflaming the situation.
