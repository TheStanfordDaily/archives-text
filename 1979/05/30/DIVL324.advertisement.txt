ing several minutes, the missing base player fi
nally arrived amidst a reek of Colombian Gold

hit the conductor In the back row ol trie or
chestra, the base players calmly pulled oul from
their base cases submachine guns and shot the
man to pieces The moral of ttie story—Never
strike Owl when the basists are loaded
