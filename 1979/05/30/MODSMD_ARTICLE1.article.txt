# DC-10s grounded as first lawsuit filed
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The nation's
entire DC-10 fleet was ordered
grounded immediately yesterday
because of "potentially dangerous
deficiencies" in the assembly hold
ing the engine to the wing.
Meanwhile, the first lawsuit stem
ming from the nation's worst air dis
aster was filed yesterday as the last
remains of bodies were still being re
covered from the wreckage of the
American Airlines DC-10 jet at
Chicago's O'Hare International Air
port.
A $15.75 million damage suit was
filed on behalf of the wife and son of
Hans Jurgen Kahl, 35, of Austria, who
was aboard Flight 191 Friday when it
took off from O'Hare, rolled to its
left, then exploded in an orange ball
of flame as it cartwheeled into a
grassy field a quarter mile northwest
of the airport.
None of the listed 271 passengers
and crew members survived the
crash. Two persons on the ground
also died.
Attorney Phil Corboy of Chicago
filed the suit in U.S. District Court
asking $5.25 million each from
American Airlines; McDonnell
Douglas, the manufacturer of the
DC-10; and General Electric, man
ufacturer of the engine that broke
loose from the aircraft.
'Structural defects'
The suit charges that the plane was
structurally defective, that the en
gine was not properly mounted and
that the airline didn't provide "the
highest degree of safety." The suit
includes a $250,000 claim for "the
pain, anxiety and suffering by Mr.
Kahl just before the crash."
"I'm sure there will be many suits
like this," said Corboy, who
specializes in personal injury law
suits.
The Los Angeles-bound flight lost
its left engine on takeoff, and a bro
ken bolt from the engine assembly
found along the runway prompted
the Federal Aviation Administration
on Sunday to order an inspection of
engine bolts on DC-10s.
But FAA Administrator Langhorne
Bond indicated the DC-10's prob
lems go further than just the bolt that
failed.
Informed sources told The As
sociated Press earlier yesterday that
the planes would be grounded be
cause of the discovery of "metal
fatigue."
Airbus grounded
The grounding order also applies
to A-300 Airbuses, a European-made
wide-bodied jetliner, but there are
few operated by U.S. airlines. The
engine and wing pylons are of the
same design as those on the DC-10,
the FAA said.
Bond said inspections carried out
since Friday's crash have turned up
defects in the assemblies that hold
the engines to the wings of an un
specified number of DC-10s owned
by United and Northwest airlines.
Shortly before Bond announced
the grounding of the planes,
McDonnell Douglas Corp., manufac
turer of the DC-10, said an inspection
in Chicago had turned up a crack on
an engine mounting on a United Air
lines DC-10.
Officials said each plane will be
permitted to return to service after its
inspection by airline mechanics, who
are licensed by the FAA.
Even atter the aircraft are returned
to service, Bond said, the engine

mountings will be inspected every 10
days or every 100 flying hours —
which ever comes first — until the
FAA develops a permanent inspec
tion plan.
He declined to estimate how long
his order would keep the planes on
the ground, but said it was possible
the jets could be back in the air in two
or three days.
"I hope that it will not disrupt U.S.
air traffic. But if that is necessary, that
will be the case," he said.
Dan Henkin, a spokesman for the
Air Transport Association, which
represents the airline industry, said
the grounding of the DC-10s and
A-300 Airbuses represents the loss of


Prof. Ronald Hilton
12 percent of the available passenger
capacity of U.S. airlines.
He said there will be some incon
venience to passengers, but added
that the airlines are trying to substi
tute other aircraft for DC-10s where
possible.
On Monday, Bond had ordered in
spection of the bolts that help hold
the engines to the DC-10 wings and
ordered mechanics to visually in
spect the pylon area of the assembly
at the same time. When those in
spections turned up "potentially
dangerous deficiencies," he ordered
the planes grounded.
Bond also said he was ordering a
review of inspection procedures for
engine mountings for all wide
bodied aircraft, including Loc
kheed's L-1011 and Boeing's 747, in
addition to the McDonnell Douglas
Corp.'s DC-10 and the Airbus.

tion plan.
He declined to estimate how long
his order would keep the planes on
the ground, but said it was possible
the jets could be back in the air in two
or three days.
"I hope that it will not disrupt U.S.
air traffic. But if that is necessary, that
will be the case," he said.
Dan Henkin, a spokesman for the
Air Transport Association, which
represents the airline industry, said
the grounding of the DC-10s and
A-300 Airbuses represents the loss of


Prof. Ronald Hilton
12 percent of the available passenger
capacity of U.S. airlines.
He said there will be some incon
venience to passengers, but added
that the airlines are trying to substi
tute other aircraft for DC-10s where
possible.
On Monday, Bond had ordered in
spection of the bolts that help hold
the engines to the DC-10 wings and
ordered mechanics to visually in
spect the pylon area of the assembly
at the same time. When those in
spections turned up "potentially
dangerous deficiencies," he ordered
the planes grounded.
Bond also said he was ordering a
review of inspection procedures for
engine mountings for all wide
bodied aircraft, including Loc
kheed's L-1011 and Boeing's 747, in
addition to the McDonnell Douglas
Corp.'s DC-10 and the Airbus.
Washington (AP) — The nation's
entire DC-10 fleet was ordered
grounded immediately yesterday
because of "potentially dangerous
deficiencies" in the assembly hold
ing the engine to the wing.
Meanwhile, the first lawsuit stem
ming from the nation's worst air dis
aster was filed yesterday as the last
remains of bodies were still being re
covered from the wreckage of the
American Airlines DC-10 jet at
Chicago's O'Hare International Air
port.
A $15.75 million damage suit was
filed on behalf of the wife and son of
Hans Jurgen Kahl, 35, of Austria, who
was aboard Flight 191 Friday when it
took off from O'Hare, rolled to its
left, then exploded in an orange ball
of flame as it cartwheeled into a
grassy field a quarter mile northwest
of the airport.
None of the listed 271 passengers
and crew members survived the
crash. Two persons on the ground
also died.
Attorney Phil Corboy of Chicago
filed the suit in U.S. District Court
asking $5.25 million each from
American Airlines; McDonnell
Douglas, the manufacturer of the
DC-10; and General Electric, man
ufacturer of the engine that broke
loose from the aircraft.
'Structural defects'
The suit charges that the plane was
structurally defective, that the en
gine was not properly mounted and
that the airline didn't provide "the
highest degree of safety." The suit
includes a $250,000 claim for "the
pain, anxiety and suffering by Mr.
Kahl just before the crash."
"I'm sure there will be many suits
like this," said Corboy, who
specializes in personal injury law
suits.
The Los Angeles-bound flight lost
its left engine on takeoff, and a bro
ken bolt from the engine assembly
found along the runway prompted
the Federal Aviation Administration
on Sunday to order an inspection of
engine bolts on DC-10s.
But FAA Administrator Langhorne
Bond indicated the DC-10's prob
lems go further than just the bolt that
failed.
Informed sources told The As
sociated Press earlier yesterday that
the planes would be grounded be
cause of the discovery of "metal
fatigue."
Airbus grounded
The grounding order also applies
to A-300 Airbuses, a European-made
wide-bodied jetliner, but there are
few operated by U.S. airlines. The
engine and wing pylons are of the
same design as those on the DC-10,
the FAA said.
Bond said inspections carried out
since Friday's crash have turned up
defects in the assemblies that hold
the engines to the wings of an un
specified number of DC-10s owned
by United and Northwest airlines.
Shortly before Bond announced
the grounding of the planes,
McDonnell Douglas Corp., manufac
turer of the DC-10, said an inspection
in Chicago had turned up a crack on
an engine mounting on a United Air
lines DC-10.
Officials said each plane will be
permitted to return to service after its
inspection by airline mechanics, who
are licensed by the FAA.
Even atter the aircraft are returned
to service, Bond said, the engine

mountings will be inspected every 10
days or every 100 flying hours —
which ever comes first — until the
FAA develops a permanent inspec
tion plan.
He declined to estimate how long
his order would keep the planes on

the jets could be back in the air in two
or three days.
