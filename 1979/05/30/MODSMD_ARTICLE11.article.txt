## The 						Quad: 84 years of photographs 
### Chris Yates 
"If life were only a perpetual
Junior Hop, philosophers
could never wonder again
whether or not it were worth
living."
So laments a coed writing a
piece entitled "Society at Stan
ford" which appeared in the
first volume of the Stanford
Quad in 1894. The first edition
of Stanford's yearbook, or an
nual as it was called then, was
published by the junior class as
a gift to the senior class. Its
editors justified their choice of
name — "The Quad" — be
cause of its "snap and vigor—a
marked charactistic of the Uni
versity."
Volume I had few pictures in
comparison to recent year
books. Instead, much space
was devoted to written fea
tures. For example, one full
page was devoted to the
"Smoking Club" including a
list of those privileged enough
to be designated "Holy Smok
ers."
In another feature Jane Stan
ford herself lent some sage ob
servations to the fledgling pub
lication. Quad editors noted
that "Mrs. Stanford has herself
said that until her son was sev
eral years of age, she lived what
she considers 'a selfish life,' al
though we, who know her
now, can hardly believe that
such words could ever apply to
her."
Missed two years
Since 1894 the Quad has
been published annually ex
cept for a two-year lapse in
1972 and 1973. During these
two years no yearbook was
published, largely as a result of
financial difficulties, according
to Daily articles at the time. In
previous years, hundreds of
yearbooks had been left un
sold, causing the Quad to go in

debt over $11,000.
At the time, Ed Riddell, Quad
editor, said, "there just isn't
enough interest in college
yearbooks anymore. There
doesn't seem to be any future
in a Quad.
Stephen DeLeers, who will
edit the 1980 Quad, also attri
butes the Quad's demise to
student apathy toward a year
book, noting that much of the
students' energy and interest
was instead directed toward
ending the Vietnam War of the
early 19705.
The 1971 Quad provides a
vivid illustration of this period,
contrasting a picture of the
mini-skirted Dollies riding a
float in the Rose Parade with a
stark montage of riot-garbed
police, student protesters and
boarded-up campus buildings.
Quad publication was re
sumed in 1974 and, aided by
contributions from the athletic
department and alumni, the
Quad was able to make a profit
that year.
DeLeers, a junior majoring in
English, is enthusiastic about
prospects for next year's
book. He said that, "although
the yearbook tradition has not
been really strong here, I hope
to change that attitude during
the next year."
Some of the changes he
plans include a rule that no pic
ture will be printed, regardless
of the importance of its sub
ject, unless artistically "it can
stand on its own merit." In ad
dition, DeLeers said the 1980
Quad will be "picture inten
sive" but with the addition of
more copy.
"Now, when a book comes
out, we can look at pictures
and appreciate them, but 20
years from now they might be
meaningless" without
explanatory copy, he said.

Sometime next week the
84th volume of the Quad is ex
pected to arrive. According to
Henry Garcia, current editor of
the Quad,this book will be un
ique in many ways.
"This year we tried to let
each section develop on its
own, instead of conforming to
a central theme," said Garcia.
In addition, he notes that the
book has a new section cover
ing news stories of the year,
ranging from the petty (instal
lation of new water-saving
shower heads on campus) to
the earthshaking (Moscone-
Milk killings and revolution in
Iran).
"Right now, students may
not think this section is too
useful, but 20 years from now
we're going to find these
(stories) valuable in remember
ing the times," he said.
Good finances
Garcia, who will next year
take over for Betsie Danner as
business manager of the Quad,
plans to solicit donations from
outside the University. "The
Quad is in fairly good financial
shape now, but next year we're
going to have it in excellent
shape by starting some good

traditions," Garcia said.
In addition, Garcia said he
sees a need for a stronger
Quad organization with a more
central authority. He is also in
terested in obtaining a spon
sor, either a faculty member or
someone from the Alumni As
sociation.
DeLeers said he is currently
putting together a Quad staff
for next year, and will be re
cruiting through fall quarter. In
addition, he is encouraging
people to contribute work.
"Nineteen-eighty should not
be told through the eyes of two
or three people. There are lots
of people in the community
who take pictures, and each
one has their own special
way of looking at the place,"
DeLeers said.
The 1979 Quad should be on
sale in White Plaza during
Dead Week, according to Gar
cia. Included in every book will
be a questionnaire soliciting
comments and suggestions
for the yearbook staff.
"This (the Quad) is also a
product, not just an artistic en
deavor, and I want to give the
customers what they want,"
DeLeers said.
