# Dust 'fingerprints' may nab polluters
## 
### Associated Press 
Scientists say they have de
veloped a way to "fingerprint"
tiny airborne dust particles, a
technique which may someday
take the guesswork out of nab
bing pollution culprits.
"Now we have a tool that can
tell you if a piece of dust came
from a steel mill, a power plant,
or is road dust," said Edward
Fasiska, president of Materials
Consultants & Laboratories of
Murrysville. "This is the first
technique that can do this."
"Until now environmental
agencies really didn't know
where the source of particu
lates was," Fasiska said. "All
they knew was how much pol
lution there was in a given
area."
A scientist for the Environ

mental Protection Agency said
the technique "has a lot of
promise," but needs more
study.
The idea behind the
technique is simple:
Pollution samples are
analyzed, particle by particle,
with computerized equipment
that identifies the shape and
chemical makeup of pieces so
tiny they may not be visible to
the naked eye.
The implications are enorm
ous. Not only would the EPA
and local agencies have
specific information on who is
polluting and by how much,
but industry no longer would
have to spend precious capital
on controls that might not be
doing the intended job, Fasiska
said.
