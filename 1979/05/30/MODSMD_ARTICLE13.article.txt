# Students to manage $83,000 Blyth fund
## 
### Rose Chan 
Over $83,000 will go into the
hands of 11 eager under
graduates when the Universi
ty's first Blyth Fund Board of
Directors assumes manage
ment June 1.
The board is free to invest
the money in stocks, debt in
struments, warrant options
and cash equivalents — any
thing but commodities, ac
cording to board chairman
Michael McNabb, a sopho
more.
"We feel really lucky to have
this," said Assistant Dean of
Students Margaret Ann Fidler.
"It's just a fabulous opportun
ity for practical application."
Fidler and the University's Di
rector of Finance Rodney
Adams are board advisers.
The original grant of $75,000
came from a former associate
of the late Charles Blyth, a Uni
versity trustee who founded
the Blyth stockbroking firm.
Since the money was put into
the University's merge pool
last December, it has grown to
over $83,000. •
"Future investment deci
sions really depend on the
character of the board,"
McNabb said. "I would guess
that the board will be conserva
tive, but I myself will try to be

more speculative. They (board
members) really shouldn't be
afraid to make mistakes."
The donor and his wife, who
wish to remain anonymous,
are more interested in seeing
how well the members of the
group work together than in
seeing how much money they
make, according to McNabb.
They would also like to see
how the new board compares
with a similar board estab
lished at Occidental College in
1976.
Unless other concrete prop
osals are made, the money will
be placed in a money market
over the summer, said
McNabb.
More long-term investment
decisions have not been made,
but the board members said
they have done some thinking
on their own. McNabb was re
cently reported as saying that
his personal investment pre
ferences are money market
funds which invest in commer
cial paper and "T-bills," Treas
ury notes that return about 10
percent interest in six months.
Board member Lydia Huang,
a junior, said, "My personal
opinion is that we should put
the major portion of the money
in long-term investments and
Blue Chip stocks. Then you can

use a small portion of the
money in more short-term
liquid assets that will yield
fairly stable returns — like T
bills and the money market.
Then another small portion
could be used for speculative
purposes."
The Blyth Fund's provisions
protect against overspecula
tive investment by setting
limits on the amount risked in
actions like buying on margin,
selling short and investing in
options or warrants.
Freshman Ahmad Sami,
freshman Ken Perez and junior
in economics Jean Wood make
up the executive board.
Comprising the rest of the
Board are:
James Barnett, junior in politi
cal science; Denise Bradley,
sophomore; Corrine Carza,
junior in economics; Janine
Cershon, sophomore; How
ard Gleicher, junior in electri
cal engineering; and Kenneth
Nunn, junior in international
relations.

Alternates are Christopher
Greene, Jeffrey Raikes, John
Knight and Arch Meredith.
Advisers Fidler and Adams
do not expect to have a large
role in decision-making.
"At the first meeting, I stipu
lated that I would answer ques
tions and make observations if
I felt they were really getting
off the track," said Adams.
Each term on the Board lasts
from April 1 to March 31. Fidler
expects that applications for
next year will be taken in
winter quarter.
This year's board members
were chosen from 130 applic
ants who responded to an ad in
the Daily in early spring calling
for undergraduates interested
in investments.
"We were looking for
people who would work well
together — some with experi
ence and some who were
genuinely interested but who
hadn't had as much direct ex
perience," said Fidler. The
selection committee also

looked for leadership abilities,
integrity and responsiblity.
Fields of interest, academic
subjects taken, ethnic
background and special skills
such as accounting and com
puter programming were also
considered to give the group
the desired diversity.
The question of what to do
with the money earned has
been broadly settled. Fifty-per
cent of investment income
goes for student directors' ex
penses, such as subscriptions
to periodicals and travel, office
and convention expenses.
McNabb said the Board has
discussed sponsoring semi
nars next year for students in
terested in investments.
Twenty-five percent of in
vestment income is donated to
the institution and the remain
ing 25 percent is put back into
the fund.
"It's challenging — and it's
not like a monopoly game,"
said Perez. "These are real
stakes."
