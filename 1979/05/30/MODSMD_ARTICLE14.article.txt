## Anarchism means liberty 
### 
/ am an anarchist, I am a ragged clown.
-Margaret Hoy
... an anarchist society, a society which or
ganizes itself without authority, is always in exis
tence, like a seed beneath the snow, buried
■under the weight of the state and its bureauc
racy, capitalism and its waste, privilege and its
injustices, nationalism and its suicidal loyalties,
religious differences and their superstitious
separatism.
-Colin Ward, in Anarchy in Action
Before anything else, anarchism is a positive
philosophy. It does not mean chaos, it means
the organization of society by function, guided
by the principle that no person shall dominate
another.
A look at some of the chapter headings in
Colin Ward's wonderful book might show this:
"The Theory of Spontaneous Order," "The Dis
solution of Leadership," "Harmony through
Complexity," "Topless Federations," "Play as
an Anarchist Parable."
; We anarchists feel that we can, and will, order
pur lives around the principles of cooperation,
harmony and freedom instead of competition,
hierarchy and domination. At first glance, this
may seem very idealistic, indeed Utopian, but
nothing could be further from the truth.
What is to be done?
Anarchism asks, simply, what is to be done
and what is the best way to do it? We live on an
incredibly rich planet, we are a talented species,
and yet we have brought ourselves and our
planet to the edge of destruction.
Instead of working for ourselves, we work for
others as hired wage-slaves; instead of govern
ing ourselves, we are governed; instead of liv
ing, we consume. It need not be so.
* Underneath the shit that is piled on our daily
lives, we still continue to play, to create, to love.
We must uncover our real lives.
If we dig down to what is important, we will
Dot only find a living society but also a way back
from the ecological/nuclear abyss state
capitalism and state socialism have brought us
to.
Technology crucial
This does not mean going back to a pre
technological society. Technology is crucial to
our overpopulated world. But technology
should not be an end; nor should it be a means
to profit, to domination.
Machines should serve life, not death.
Technology must harmonize with nature or it
will destroy nature, leaving nothing but a lifeless
iron sphere.
Emma Goldman said "If I can't dance, I don't
want to be in your Revolution." Anarchist re
volution calls for each individual to have the
opportunity to do what is real and positive in

their lives.
After you grow older, how often will you
dance free in the sun in the middle of the day?
Do they dance in the Bank of America building
when the sun melts the morning fog in San Fran
cisco? I doubt it. There are too many things to
do, too many loans to South Africa and agribusi
ness, too much money.
President A.W. Clausen of Bank of America
might say, "You crazy hippie, there have always
been banks, there will always be banks, society
couldn't exist without us."
Question all
Clausen is uninformed — and unquestioning.
He will not make a very good anarchist. For
anarchists, everything is to be questioned.
Daniel Ellsbergand Noam Chomsky questioned
the government (a perfect place for anarchists
— as both of them are — to start) and discovered
the Vietnam War was an imperialist adventure.
Anarchists critique everything — education
(A.S. Neill, Ivan lllich, Francisco Ferrer), institu
tional medicine (Thomas Szasz), science
(Feyerbard), even that great, ancient domina
tion of patriarchy.
Feminism, as the critique of perhaps the old
est system of oppression — the grandaddy of
them all, represents a crucial step in the quest
for a free, anarchistic society. Many anarchists,
being men, have failed to make this step. Their
anarchism is incomplete.
But most anarchists are open to feminism be
cause they hold that all authority must be ques
tioned, all systems of domination ended, and
what is real — like the life force of women,
long-suppressed by patriarchy — must be liber
ated.
What is anarchy
"Anarchy is freedom, the right of all people to
lead the life that suits them best, in voluntary
cooperation with the people around them. We
believe in a collective approach in which people
are free to share in the resources of the earth, in
the work, and in the wealth produced. We want
no one to be poor or to become rich at the
expense of others. We don't want to be bosses
or to be bossed around.
No politician or government can give us this
freedom. Nowhere in the world, in "com
munist" countries or "democratic" ones, do
people have the freedom that all humans desire.
No one, person or group, can give freedom "to"
us. Women and men, as individuals and in
groups, we can change our lives and our soci
ety."
