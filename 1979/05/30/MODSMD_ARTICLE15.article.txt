Foreign languages
It is encouraging to read that
faculty and administrators are
devising new "tracks" that will
lead to a more coherent cur
riculum at Stanford. They are
willing to admit the shortcom
ings of the liberal S.E.S.-
inspired programs that prolif
erated during the last decade.
Perhaps not everyone will
agree that the old "Western
Civ" course was as deficient as
they imply, but the need to re
turn to standards and coher
ence via new channels is in
deed a healthy sign.
But what about the foreign
language requirement,
abolished by a thin majority in
the late 19605? At a time when
President Jimmy Carter has ap
pointed a commission to inves
tigate the decline of foreign
language study nationwide,
Stanford remains strangely si
lent on the issue.
The harm done by dropping
the foreign-language require
ment will long be with us.
There is a generation of stu
dents who did not chance
upon foreign language study
when it was early enough to be
meaningful.
They were nourished on lit
erature in translation. They saw
first-year language courses re
legated to second-class status
in the humanities curriculum
and were free to draw their
own conclusions. So did the
high schools. This explains
why there is now a national

crisis in foreign language
study.
For a university that prides it
self on being in the forefront of
change, this is a serious issue.
If we really want to reverse the
trend that led to illiteracy in the
1960s by introducing some
structure to the curriculum, we
can ill afford to neglect the
most structured discipline of
all. The new programs in the

humanities will continue to be
sorely lacking until the
foreign-language requirement
is restored.

Mob vengeful
Our lawmakers, by their so
called cries of outrage against
the verdict in the Dan White

case, have shown their pro
found ignorance of, and con
tempt for, our legal system.
These politicos need an
elementary civics lesson in "t
-rial by jury."
Seeing the vengeful mob in
San Francisco's streets was dis
gusting enough, but hearing
the politicians' bloodthirsty
statements of support for "re
volutionary justice" made my

stomach turn. How low will
these people stoop for a few
votes?
