## Lettuce growers get unfair publicity 
### 
Many people, in supporting the United
Farmworkers (UFW), have attacked
lettuce growers and have called for
boycotts. Yet no one has considered a
number of important points.
The lettuce grower usually gets about 10
percent of what the consumer pays — 5-6
cents per head. Of this, 2.4 cents go to the
farmworkers.
From the remaining, the farmer must
pay rent or property taxes, irrigation ex
penses, equipment and fuel costs (the av
erage tractor now costs around $50,000,
and I need not mention the price of gas),
seed costs and fertilizer costs, among
others. And, of course, if he profits, he
pays income tax.
2.4 cents per head may not sound like
much, but it adds up. Six people applied
for every position left open by a striking
worker in the Salinas Valley this winter
because the wages are good. No skills,
education, work experience or knowledge
of English are required to obtain a posi
tion, either.

Between 1970 and 1978, there was an
increase of almost 80 percent in the dollar
amount of farmworkers' wages. Yes, infla
tion has caused the "real wages" of
farmworkers to decline, just as inflation
has caused everyone's "real wages" to de
cline by the same percentage. Even the
growers.
Farmers take risks
Farmworkers get paid for every hour
they work, a good deal in an uncertain
business. Farmers often invest hours and
dollars in crops that never sell. Most
lettuce growers took huge losses during
the recent drought.
Yet when the lack of supply last year
drove price offers up to more than $20 per
box, the growers themselves imposed an
$8-per-box limit on the price of lettuce.
Those few who hadn't lost their crops pro
fited, but much less than they could have.
Some of them even recovered losses in
curred during the drought.
As the wages of farmworkers are quickly

rising, the cost of reliable equipment that
can replace them is quickly falling. When
the former finally exceeds the latter, there
will be no employment for the farmwor
kers. Is this what the farmworkers want?
No.
Banana boycott useless
Many people are calling for a boycott of
Chiquita Bananas, because Chiquita and
Sun Harvest (the nation's largest lettuce
grower) are both owned by United Brands
Company.
Unfortunately, Chiquita is not a large
enough part of United Brands fora boycott
to severely hurt them. Those who will suf
fer are the innocent farmworkers who
help produce Chiquita Bananas.
The growers are the subject of many ac
cusations and misunderstandings. I hope
the facts presented here have cleared a
few of them up.
