# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS
## Mark Robeck Tangible non-sexist approach needed 
### 
I think that in his article,
"Combat Reverse Sexism,"
(Daily, May 22) Gary Furlong
made an honest attempt to un
derstand sexism, but he was
destined to fail because his
abstract approach to the issue
ignores the almost invisible so
cial inequity which remains
after the establishment of
equal legal rights.
First, the question of a man
running the women's escort
service. If all else were equal, a
man could have a right to hold
such authority.
The problem with his argu
ment is that everything else
isn't equal. In fact, the need for
a women's escort service is a
blatant example of men's
power over women.
"But he hasn't even commit
tedacrimeagainstawoman," I
hear you cry. I might add, "Fie
may do a damn good job."
However, the objections
raised against his appointment
were that it was tacit support of
the patriarchal social system in
which the man protects the
woman from other men.
Whether a man uses or
abuses his authority doesn't
matter because it still gives a
position of power to a man on
the one issue of which women
themselves should take con
trol.
Furlong an example
I agree with Furlong's posi
tion that some women hurt the
feminist movement when they
claim that men can't under
stand women's problems, but
Furlong himself doesn't un
derstand the problems. Fie is a
prime example why some
women stop trying to explain
their position.

A man can for the most part,
but never completely, under
stand how it feels to be a
woman by taking a woman's
perspective and Dy question
ing the basic assumptions of
patriarchal society.
One such assumption is the
naturalism argument, which
takes the biological differences
between the sexes and ex
trapolates them into the social
realm.
Furlong says some women
propound vandalism and prior
restraint of the press as means
of making men come to terms
with sexism and understand
women's position.
Censorship distracts
I dislike prior restraint of the
press and vandalism as much

as Furlong does, but not for the
same reasons. I dislike these
efforts because they divert at
tention away from the issues.
They also represent a lack of
faith in people's ability to un-

A man can come close to understanding
how it feels to be a woman by taking a
woman's perspective and questioning the
basic assumptions of patriarchal society.

derstand issues through the
free (not as free as one would
like) association of ideas.
The people who supposedly
favor such restraints are the
very people who understand
that sexual innuendos are de
grading and that a pimp-and

prostitute theme is not harm
less.
Their abilities and know
ledge should be used to de
velop ways to deal sensitively
and effectively with sexism.

After all, one can't expect a
person who has been incul
cated with sexist thinking to
understand more than an
abstract notion of equality
when they are first confronted
with the topic of sexism.
