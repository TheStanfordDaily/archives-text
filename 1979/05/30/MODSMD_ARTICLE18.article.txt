## Base justice on retribution 
### 
In the past few weeks our
criminal courts have passed
three sentences which by most
standards would be consi
dered quite lenient: 14 years
for Laurence Singleton who kid
napped, raped and cut the
arms off a 14-year-old girl;
eight years for Theodore
Streleski's murder of Prof. De-
Leeuw; and the voluntary
manslaughter conviction of
Dan White, which implies a
sentence in the five-to-10 year
range. For many of us, one or
all of these decisions has of
fended our sense of justice.
What is the source of this in
dignation? Am I merely vindic
tive? To find out, I must first
attempt to distinguish between
vengeance and justice.
My dictionary doesn't help.
It defines vengeance as a par
ticular philosophy of justice:
that which would return injury
for injury. However, there is a
passion associated with re
venge that need not — should
not — be associated with jus
tice.
Justice should be impersonal
in the sense that it is concerned
with fair and deserved
punishment for a given crime.
After that is established there is
room for personal considera
tions in the form of mercy.
No true justice
It is not self-evident to me
that there is any true justice
which can be realized. No
punishment will bring back the
dead. However, my intuition
does suggest that some ap
proximations to real justice can
be made.
It may be dangerous for me
to trust those intuitions com
pletely (which is why I confer
with others), but it may be even
more dangerous for me to
deny them.
Let me return to the distinc
tion between criminal and
crime, or, more generally, be

tween the agent and the moral
action, be it good or bad.
The separate consideration
of "sin" and "sinner" is central
to Christian ethics (abhor the
former, love the latter).
I try to follow the boss's or
ders and love Theodore
Streleski as myself. All that I
have read in the papers
suggests that he is a very moral
person; his ethics appear to be
carefully thought out and con
sistently followed.
Consider his philosophy?
Does love compel me to
keep an open mind toward his
moral philosophy? God forbid!
I may not be able to judge his
soul but I certainly intend to
judge his moral philosophy: it
is vile.
None of us, I hope, favors
any legal restrictions on what a
person believes or even
preaches, justice applies to ac
tions, not thoughts, so it makes
no sense to talk of justice until
after he commits his murder.
Then we are forced to claim
that we have a right to declare
that our value system superse
des his (for him there are occa
sions when murder is accepta
ble) if we are to punish him.
However, as human institu
tions, the courts are still unable
to judge souls, only actions.
The question then arises,
can they rightly administer
punishment without overstep
ping these bounds? I believe
so, but I think a careful consid
eration of the possible reasons
for punishing criminals is in
order.
Three concerns
There are three: to deter
rehabilitate the crim
inal, and/or to provide retribu
tion — that is, to punish the
criminal simply because he or
she deserves it.
We all know that prisons are
next to useless for rehabilita
tion. We also know that torture
is really the best deterrent. And
most of us automatically recoil
at the idea of retribution; it
sounds utterly barbaric.
I hate to have to say this, but
I'm afraid we must take the
principle of retribution seri

ously— not revenge against an
individual, but rather the
balancing of a criminal act with
a punishing act. If not, we must
be prepared to forego criminal
punishment and perhaps even
throw out the concept of jus
tice.
Certainly, the connection
between justice and punish
ment will be permanently se
vered. Criminal justice will be
come a branch of medicine
(psychiatry) with compulsory
"treatments."
Mercy, too
Fortunately there is also
mercy. It is good that mercy
should coexist with justice, but
the two can never intermingle
or they will undermine each
other. To call premeditated
murder second-degree mur
der or manslaughter is not
merciful, it is just a wishy
washy notion of justice.
If White had simply confes
sed without defense and re
quested the penalty which he
himself favored, he would
have regained my respect.
Then, had I been the judge, I
would have been inclined to
impose a far lighter sentence.
That is what mercy means to
me.
Instead, his lawyers and
psychiatrists sacrificed what
ever human dignity he had left
in order to save his miserable
skin. As for Streleski, it makes
no sense to talk about mercy
because he doesn't think his
action was wrong.
Finally, there is Singleton,
whom I am reluctant to men
tion because I know I couldrl't
find it in my heart to show any
mercy toward him.
I believe that the current
crisis in our legal system is only
one symptom of a moral sick
ness that is pandemic. Shout
ing opinions won't help. In the
field of morality there are no
experts. The law is in your
heart. Dig for it.

should coexist with justice, but
the two can never intermingle
or they will undermine each
other. To call premeditated
murder second-degree mur
der or manslaughter is not
merciful, it is just a wishy
washy notion of justice.
If White had simply confes
sed without defense and re
quested the penalty which he
himself favored, he would
have regained my respect.
Then, had I been the judge, I
would have been inclined to
impose a far lighter sentence.
That is what mercy means to
me.
Instead, his lawyers and
psychiatrists sacrificed what
ever human dignity he had left
in order to save his miserable
skin. As for Streleski, it makes
no sense to talk about mercy
because he doesn't think his
action was wrong.
Finally, there is Singleton,
whom I am reluctant to men
tion because I know I couldrl't
find it in my heart to show any
mercy toward him.
I believe that the current
crisis in our legal system is only
one symptom of a moral sick
ness that is pandemic. Shout
ing opinions won't help. In the
field of morality there are no
experts. The law is in your
heart. Dig for it.

In the past few weeks our
criminal courts have passed
three sentences which by most
standards would be consi
dered quite lenient: 14 years
for Laurence Singleton who kid
napped, raped and cut the
arms off a 14-year-old girl;
eight years for Theodore
Streleski's murder of Prof. De-
Leeuw; and the voluntary
manslaughter conviction of
Dan White, which implies a
sentence in the five-to-10 year
range. For many of us, one or
all of these decisions has of
fended our sense of justice.
What is the source of this in
dignation? Am I merely vindic
tive? To find out, I must first
attempt to distinguish between
vengeance and justice.
My dictionary doesn't help.
It defines vengeance as a par
ticular philosophy of justice:
that which would return injury
for injury. However, there is a
passion associated with re
venge that need not — should
not — be associated with jus
tice.
Justice should be impersonal
in the sense that it is concerned
with fair and deserved
punishment for a given crime.
After that is established there is
room for personal considera
tions in the form of mercy.
No true justice
It is not self-evident to me
that there is any true justice
which can be realized. No
punishment will bring back the
dead. However, my intuition
does suggest that some ap
proximations to real justice can
be made.
It may be dangerous for me
to trust those intuitions com
pletely (which is why I confer
with others), but it may be even
more dangerous for me to
deny them.
Let me return to the distinc
tion between criminal and
crime, or, more generally, be

tween the agent and the moral
action, be it good or bad.
The separate consideration
of "sin" and "sinner" is central
to Christian ethics (abhor the
former, love the latter).
I try to follow the boss's or
ders and love Theodore
Streleski as myself. All that I
have read in the papers
suggests that he is a very moral
person; his ethics appear to be
carefully thought out and con
sistently followed.
Consider his philosophy?
Does love compel me to
keep an open mind toward his
moral philosophy? God forbid!
I may not be able to judge his
soul but I certainly intend to
judge his moral philosophy: it
is vile.
None of us, I hope, favors
any legal restrictions on what a
person believes or even
preaches, justice applies to ac
tions, not thoughts, so it makes
no sense to talk of justice until
after he commits his murder.
Then we are forced to claim
that we have a right to declare
that our value system superse
des his (for him there are occa
sions when murder is accepta
ble) if we are to punish him.
However, as human institu
tions, the courts are still unable
to judge souls, only actions.
The question then arises,
can they rightly administer
punishment without overstep
ping these bounds? I believe
so, but I think a careful consid
eration of the possible reasons
for punishing criminals is in
order.
Three concerns
There are three: to deter
rehabilitate the crim
inal, and/or to provide retribu
tion — that is, to punish the
criminal simply because he or
she deserves it.
We all know that prisons are
next to useless for rehabilita
tion. We also know that torture
is really the best deterrent. And
most of us automatically recoil
at the idea of retribution; it
sounds utterly barbaric.
I hate to have to say this, but
I'm afraid we must take the
principle of retribution seri

ously— not revenge against an
individual, but rather the
balancing of a criminal act with
a punishing act. If not, we must
be prepared to forego criminal
punishment and perhaps even
throw out the concept of jus
tice.
Certainly, the connection
between justice and punish
ment will be permanently se
vered. Criminal justice will be
come a branch of medicine
(psychiatry) with compulsory
"treatments."

should coexist with justice, but
the two can never intermingle
