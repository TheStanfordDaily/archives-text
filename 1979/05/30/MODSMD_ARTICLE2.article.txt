# Tennis' Anne Gould retires
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
University women's tennis coach
Anne Gould unexpectedly resigned
from her post effective August 31,
Athletic Director Andy Geiger an
nounced yesterday.
Gould, 27, ends her four-year
reign to continue work towards a
master's degree in education at the
University.
"I really enjoy teaching — teach
ing, more of like physical education
orsomething like that. In coaching,"
Gould said, "there are unforeseen
things. They can be a challenge, or
they can wear on you."
The explosion of the women's ath
letic movement, which has gone
from a low-key to a big-league at
mosphere in just a few years, played
a role in Gould's decision.

"Women's athletics has become a
high-pressure situation," Gould
said. "Because of the profes
sionalism, it is more high-powered
than one might think. It is not some
thing I enjoy all the time."
The "professionalism" has been
very evident at Stanford, where
Gould led her teams to one national
championship and two second-place
finishes in the last three seasons.
Nonetheless, her decision was one
on which she dwelled forquite some
time, she said.
"I seriously considered not com
ing back this year," Gould said, "but
I wasn't really sure it was the right
step after last year.
"Probably some of the fondest
memories of my life have come out
of coaching," Gould added. "For
me, coaching isn't something I want

to do for the rest of my life."
Gould's last efforts as coach will be
spent towards the AIAW National
Championships, held June 4 to 12 at
The University of lowa.
"I told everyone now because not
everyone is going to the AIAWs,"
Gould said. "There is a strong possi
bility I won't see the rest, and I owe it
to them to tell them in person."
Gould does not think her resigna
tion will hurt the team's performance
in the tournament, in which Stanford
should be seeded third.
"I don't think it will havea negative
effect at all," Gould said. "If I did, I
wouldn't have told them. You never
know, sometimes something like
this has good side effects."
Gould's coaching record in her
four years here (exclusive of next
week's tournament) is 45-9 (.833).
Under her tutelage, Stanford players
have achieved All-America status 12
times, including current Cardinals
Kathy Jordan and Susie Hagey.
The search for a successor to
Gould will begin soon, and Gould
added that the players will have some
input towards who it will be. Not that
she is going to disappear.
"I will be around a lot. I will always
be available," Gould said. "It's not
like I'm goingtoAlaskaoranything."
