# New constitution challenged
## Criticism of Khomeini increasing

Tehran, Iran (AP) — Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, once virtually unchallenged in
revolutionary Iran, is coming under in
creasing criticism from jurists, liberal
politicians, leftists and even his own gov
ernment officials.
In statements that are often carefully
and indirectly worded, the 79-year-old
Khomeini is being accused of seeking to
pound everything in Iran into an Islamic
mold, ignoring principles of justice and
press freedom and failing to recognize the
realities of present-day Iran.
In response, Khomeini is stepping up
his own attacks on opponents, accusing
them of treason and lack of respect
for Islam. Many Iranians believe the
forthcoming publication of a draft con
stitution for Iran will spur even more bitter
controversy around the ayatollah's ideas.
Virtually all public figures still pay hom
age to Khomeini as the key figure behind
the overthrow last February of Shah Reza
Pahlavi. None of the criticism of the Mos
lem clergyman so far has suggested that
Iran would be better off with the shah back
in power.
But gradually critics have been chipping
away at the practices of Khomeini's re
gime.
Khomeini-appointed Prime Minister
Mehdi Bazargan told a television inter
viewer Monday night that armed re
volutionary committees in the country —
which consider themselves directly re
sponsible to Khomeini—have interfered

repeatedly in government business.
Asked about the government the new
constitution will set up, he said, "it would
be impossible for any president or any
government to work under such cir
cumstances."
Hassan Nazih, a confidant of the ayatol
lah and chief of the National Iranian Oil
Co., told the national Bar Association Sun
day in a speech that created a nationwide
stir that "all political, economic and judi
cial affairs" cannot be forced into an Is
lamic mold.
The Iranian legal profession has largely
been kept on the sidelines while the re
gime's system of revolutionary justice has
executed more than 200 persons since
February in special Islamic tribunals.
Nazih said the Bar Association would
send a delegation to Khomeini "to clarify
some misunderstandings that have arisen
regarding the position of the judiciary in
an Islamic society."
An announcement yesterday by the Bar
Association called for approval of the new
constitution by a constitutional assembly,
rather than in a simple yes-or-no referen
dum. The official Pars news agency quoted
a group of jurists yesterday as saying they
will stage a sit-in unless the National
Jurists' Association is given a say in compil
ing the constitution.
"The jurists expressed fear that they may
be confronted with a fait accompli insofar

as the constitutional law is concerned/'
Pars said.
Meanwhile, several small political par
ties have also called for more respect of
freedom of the press. This amounts to in
direct criticism of Khomeini, who has
sharply attacked the national daily
Ayandegan, which then shut down for
several days. Khomeini also praised an "Is
lamic association" of workers at the
Kayhan newspaper for taking over publica
tion from regular journalists.
Most Iranians still have only a vague no
tion about Khomeini's ideas for an Iranian
Islamic republic. The constitution spelling
them out has been delayed for over two
months.
Liberals and leftists have expressed con
cern that priests will be given a strong rofe
in the country, putting civilian leadership
in second place. Khomeini declared in an
angry speech last week that "those who
talk about Islam without the clergy are
traitors, by design or inadvertence."
"Anyone who wants a political system
without God or the holy Koran (the Mos
lem holy book) is our enemy," Khomeini
said. But he insisted that Moslem priests
"are not opposed to human rights and
freedoms."
Khomeini declared that people who
"eliminate Islam from references to our
regime are out of step with the revolu
tion."
