# Sorority costs seem justifiable
## 
### Alisa Terrell 
The benefits of joining a na
tional sorority apparently merit
the expense. This spring ap
proximately 170 Stanford
women opted to join one of
the seven sororities here, de
spite the costs of pledging, in
itiation, monthly dues, and
other fees.
Pledging fees range from $15
to $30, while initiation fees
range from $60 to $140. In all
sororities except Alpha Omega
Pi, both of these two fees are
sent directly to the national
sororities. Only half of the $30
pledging fee for Alpha Omega
Pi is sent to the national or
ganization, whilethe other half
stays with the local chapter, ac
cording to Becky Gonzales,
Alpha Omega Pi president.
In return for this expendi
ture, all sorority members re
ceive a lifetime subscription to
their sorority's magazine and a
certificate of membership. The
money from pledging and in
itiation also supports scholar
ships for members, conven
tion expenditures, insurance
and other services, and con
tributions to the sorority's
philanthropy organization, ac

cording to Melinda Homer,
treasurer of Alpha Phi.
The discrepancy between
the initation costs of the
sororities is often evened out
by additional fees. Lower initi
ation costs often do not include
the cost of a sorority pin. For
members of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, the purchase of a pin
is a required additional ex
pense which ranges from $10
to $120, unless a member is
given one, according to Trea
surer Vicki Dils. In Alpha
Omega Pi, members are not
required to buy a pin, but
"everyone does," according to
Gonzales. Pins for that sorority
cost from $30 to $75.
Members of Pi Phi, who pay
$65 for initation, are required
to pay national dues of $20 an
nually, according to Sharon
Ullman, the treasurer. Kappa
Kappa Gamma members pay
an additional $20 besides their
$60 initiation fee for a miscel
laneous national and alumni
fund.
Each sorority also has a
house corporation or building
fund charge that members are
required to pay once. Here,
this cost ranges from $50 to $75

and is intended to be used for
the maintenance, improve
ment, and upkeep of
sororities' houses. Several
sororities currently use this
money for the upkeep of their
off-campus meeting places.
Social and chapter dues for
the sororities range from $30 to
$60 a quarter. This money is
used to buy chapter supplies
and fund the various social ac
tivities for each sorority. These
social activities include frater
nity and sorority mixers, bar
becues, trips to the city, for
mals, and tailgaters, according
to Dils.
"When I look at all of the
things we do socially, the cost
is very much worth it," said
Ullman.
Cost, however, has been an
important factor for several
girls who decided not to
pledge, or have de-pledged or
de-activated.
"The price wasn't out of my
means, but I didn't feel it was
worth it to belong to a sorority.
I wasn't getting enough out of
it," said Martha Eichoff, who
de-pledged from a sorority last
spring. "The money could be
better spent elsewhere," she

said.
Homer, Alpha Phi treasurer,
said she has heard no com
plaints from members about
the national or local costs of
being in a sorority.
"There is a lot more benefit
to being in a sorority than just
your years at college," Homer
said.. "I think one of the big
benefits is the later connec
tions with alum associations."
Ann Bremner, who served as
a rush counselor this spring,
said that "not that many girls
were worried about the
money.
"I think that the girls that
were interested in sororities
were aware of the costs,"
Bremner said.
All of the sororities allow
members to pay on an install
ment plan, if necessary. Scho
larships and loans are available
through the national organiza
tions.
"We have a flexible special
billing plan in which almost
anything goes, but the girl is
ultimately responsible for pay
ing for herself," said Mary
Anne Fochek, treasurer of
Kappa Alpha Theta.

spite the costs of pledging, in
itiation, monthly dues, and
other fees.
Pledging fees range from $15
to $30, while initiation fees
range from $60 to $140. In all
sororities except Alpha Omega
Pi, both of these two fees are
sent directly to the national
sororities. Only half of the $30
pledging fee for Alpha Omega
Pi is sent to the national or
ganization, whilethe other half
stays with the local chapter, ac
cording to Becky Gonzales,
Alpha Omega Pi president.
In return for this expendi
ture, all sorority members re
ceive a lifetime subscription to
their sorority's magazine and a
certificate of membership. The
money from pledging and in
itiation also supports scholar
ships for members, conven
tion expenditures, insurance
and other services, and con
tributions to the sorority's
philanthropy organization, ac

cording to Melinda Homer,
treasurer of Alpha Phi.
The discrepancy between
the initation costs of the
sororities is often evened out
by additional fees. Lower initi
ation costs often do not include
the cost of a sorority pin. For
members of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, the purchase of a pin
is a required additional ex
pense which ranges from $10
to $120, unless a member is
given one, according to Trea
surer Vicki Dils. In Alpha
Omega Pi, members are not
required to buy a pin, but
"everyone does," according to
Gonzales. Pins for that sorority
cost from $30 to $75.
Members of Pi Phi, who pay
$65 for initation, are required
to pay national dues of $20 an
nually, according to Sharon
Ullman, the treasurer. Kappa
Kappa Gamma members pay
an additional $20 besides their
$60 initiation fee for a miscel
laneous national and alumni
fund.
Each sorority also has a
house corporation or building
fund charge that members are
required to pay once. Here,
this cost ranges from $50 to $75

and is intended to be used for
the maintenance, improve
ment, and upkeep of
sororities' houses. Several
sororities currently use this
money for the upkeep of their
off-campus meeting places.
Social and chapter dues for
the sororities range from $30 to
$60 a quarter. This money is
used to buy chapter supplies
and fund the various social ac
tivities for each sorority. These
social activities include frater
nity and sorority mixers, bar
becues, trips to the city, for
mals, and tailgaters, according
to Dils.
"When I look at all of the
things we do socially, the cost
is very much worth it," said
Ullman.
Cost, however, has been an
important factor for several
girls who decided not to
pledge, or have de-pledged or
de-activated.
"The price wasn't out of my
means, but I didn't feel it was
worth it to belong to a sorority.
I wasn't getting enough out of
it," said Martha Eichoff, who
de-pledged from a sorority last
spring. "The money could be
better spent elsewhere," she

said.
Homer, Alpha Phi treasurer,
said she has heard no com
plaints from members about
the national or local costs of
being in a sorority.
"There is a lot more benefit
to being in a sorority than just
your years at college," Homer
said.. "I think one of the big
benefits is the later connec
tions with alum associations."
Ann Bremner, who served as
a rush counselor this spring,
said that "not that many girls
were worried about the
money.
"I think that the girls that
were interested in sororities
were aware of the costs,"
Bremner said.
All of the sororities allow
members to pay on an install
ment plan, if necessary. Scho
larships and loans are available
through the national organiza
tions.
"We have a flexible special
billing plan in which almost
anything goes, but the girl is
ultimately responsible for pay
ing for herself," said Mary
Anne Fochek, treasurer of
Kappa Alpha Theta.
The benefits of joining a na
tional sorority apparently merit
the expense. This spring ap
proximately 170 Stanford
women opted to join one of
the seven sororities here, de
spite the costs of pledging, in
itiation, monthly dues, and
other fees.
