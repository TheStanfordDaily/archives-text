Summer quarter on the Farm
has the reputation of often being
insufferably boring. We won't
dispute that. However, news is al
ways breaking, and the Daily will
be doing its best to bring you that
news twice each week. On June
26, the Daily will begin its "all
the-news-that-fits-we'll-print"
coverage of events on and around
the Stanford campus. Most of the
best features of the regular Daily
will be continued — Cinemas
cope, Bay Area Events, Classified
Ads, incomplete news coverage,
Opinions columns, . . . wait a mi

nute . . . incomplete news cover
age??
That's not supposed to happen
. . . but then, that's what this ad is
all about. We need your help to
make that incomplete news
coverage complete. We need your
time . . . only a few hours each
week if that's what you can give —
but we do need that. If you've
never written anything in your life,
give it a try anyway. We'll even pay
you for the effort (not much, but
enough to send you to the
movies).
