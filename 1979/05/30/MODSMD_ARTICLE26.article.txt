## Rock/michael london Rubinoos hit their stride; drum up converts along the way 
### 
Overheard after last Friday's
Rubinoos concert in the park
ing lot of the Keystone Palo
Alto: A well-tanned clean-cut
Stanford student turned to his
date and cried, "Wow, that's
the first time in my life I've re
ally gotten into rock and roll!"
"Yeah," the girl agreed, still
breathless from dancing. "Be
fore tonight, my idea of a great
show was seeing Loggins and
Messina."
Chalk up two more converts.
The Rubinoos gained plenty
last week, playing exhilarating
shows at the Old Waldorf on
Thursday night and the Keys
tone on Friday.
The concerts marked a re
turn to home for the
Berkeley-bred foursome, who
just completed a 60-date na
tional tour as the opening act
for Elvis Costello.
The Rubinoos took the stage
at the Old Waldorf wearing
their usual T-shirts, tennis
shoes and toothpaste smiles.
They looked like the "nice"
friends your kid brother used
to bring home, the ones your
mother wanted you to be just
like.
The show started slowly on
Thursday night. Lead singer
John Rubin looked and
sounded tired. The first few
songs, drawn from the
Rubinoos' latest album, Back
to the Drawing Board! were
well-played but uninspired.
Things changed quickly
though, as lead guitarist (and
songwriter) Tommy Dunbar
took control of the stage and
the crowd.
The Rubinoos play a music
brand of mid-'6os pop, drawing
heavily on "bubblegum" rock.
With the diminutive Dunbar in
control, the sense of sheer fun
was irresistible. He picked
furiously at his guitar, twisting
his face and his body like a
clown, parodying all the famil
iar poses of rock performers.
Schlock-rock
Between songs Dunbar
poked repeated jabs at
heavy-metal schlock-rock,
threatening at one poi nt to do a
Thin Lizzy medley, and con
tinually heaping abuse on
California favorite Van Halen.
Underneath the Rubinoos'
mocking tone is solid musi
cianship. Dunbar, at 22, has
developed into a first-rate

guitarist. His solos were re
markably agile, fluid and clean.
Donny Spindt, the band's
buoyant drummer, has im
proved tremendously of late.
His explosive rhythms urged
on the group, often threaten
ing to steal the show from his
front-line mates.
The Rubinoos' vocals, long
their distinctive feature, were
as sweet as ever. Rubin's lead
singing was backed up by
dazzling harmonies; on their
cover of Dance, Dance, Dance,
the band sounded as good live
as the Beach Boys did on the
studio original.
As the end of the hour-long
set approached, the Rubinoos
hit their stride.
Heavy-metal parody
"Rock and Roll is Dead (But
We Don't Care)," a heavy
metal parody, set a frantic pace
which carried through the en
core. The Rubinoos played
with reckless abandon, the
stage a scene of barely control
led chaos. Gangly bass player
Royse Ader charged around
like a panic-stricken giraffe,

Dunbar and Rubin duelled on
guitar from every imaginable
position and Spindt sat pound
ing away on drums with an
enormous grin on his face. De
spite the tongue-in-cheek
theatrics, the music remained
consistently good.
The final song was a breath
less remake of the Seeds' '60s
hit, "Pushin' Too Hard." By the
end, the Rubinoos' enthusiasm
had conquered the club, and
the exuberant audience was
having as much fun watching
as the band was having
onstage.
Less intimate
Friday night at the Keystone
Palo Alto, the Rubinoos' con
cert went less smoothly. The
Keystone is far less intimate
than the Old Waldorf, and its
size placed a strain on the
Rubinoos' stage show.
The biggest problem was a
muddled sound system that
drowned most of the vocals
and guitar-work.
Undaunted, the Rubinoos
romped through two sets with
their usual vigor. They played

several new songs, each
stamped with Dunbar's flair for
writing uniquely catchy pop
melodies, reminiscent of the
early McCartney-Lennon com
positions. It would seem to be
only a matter of time and pub
licity before the Rubinoos
crack the top-40 record charts.
The Archies
The Keystone show also in

cluded cover versions of two
notable oldies: The Archies'
bubblegum classic "Sugar,
Sugar," which the Rubinoos
pulled off with completely
straight faces; and Steppen
wolf's "Born to be Wild,"
which they played as a wonder
ful, hysterically-inflated decla
ration of adolescent rapture.
Turning to opening acts:

Thursday night at the Old Wal
dorf, Pearl Harbor and the Exp
losions started the festivities.
Pearl's wild gyrations gener
ated a great deal of energy, but
her original material was un
even.
The two standout numbers
were "Drivin,' " a soon-to-be
released single, and "Shut Up

and Dance," which even had
one of the stodgy Old Waldorf
waitresses swinging her hips in
the aisle.
The opening act at the Keys
tone on Friday was "San Jose's
finest," the Cornell Hurd
Band. Their music was as
thoroughly forgettable as their
name.


The Company's touring production of The Fantasticks, the longest
running off-Broadway musical, will be performed tomorrow in Tre
sidder Main Lounge at 8 p.m. Featured are (from bottom clockwise)
Kyle Treadway, Chris Kelly, Jodi Corwin, Kirk Lawson and Steve
Shafer.

Heavy-metal parody
"Rock and Roll is Dead (But
We Don't Care)," a heavy
metal parody, set a frantic pace
which carried through the en
core. The Rubinoos played
with reckless abandon, the
stage a scene of barely control
led chaos. Gangly bass player
Royse Ader charged around
like a panic-stricken giraffe,

Dunbar and Rubin duelled on
guitar from every imaginable
position and Spindt sat pound
ing away on drums with an
enormous grin on his face. De
spite the tongue-in-cheek
theatrics, the music remained
consistently good.
The final song was a breath
less remake of the Seeds' '60s
hit, "Pushin' Too Hard." By the
end, the Rubinoos' enthusiasm
had conquered the club, and
the exuberant audience was
having as much fun watching
as the band was having
onstage.
Less intimate
Friday night at the Keystone
Palo Alto, the Rubinoos' con
cert went less smoothly. The
Keystone is far less intimate
than the Old Waldorf, and its
size placed a strain on the
Rubinoos' stage show.
The biggest problem was a
muddled sound system that
drowned most of the vocals
and guitar-work.
Undaunted, the Rubinoos
romped through two sets with
their usual vigor. They played

several new songs, each
stamped with Dunbar's flair for
writing uniquely catchy pop
melodies, reminiscent of the
early McCartney-Lennon com
positions. It would seem to be
only a matter of time and pub
licity before the Rubinoos
crack the top-40 record charts.
The Archies
The Keystone show also in

cluded cover versions of two
notable oldies: The Archies'
bubblegum classic "Sugar,
Sugar," which the Rubinoos
pulled off with completely
straight faces; and Steppen
wolf's "Born to be Wild,"
which they played as a wonder
ful, hysterically-inflated decla
ration of adolescent rapture.
Turning to opening acts:

Thursday night at the Old Wal
dorf, Pearl Harbor and the Exp
losions started the festivities.
Pearl's wild gyrations gener
ated a great deal of energy, but
her original material was un
even.
The two standout numbers
were "Drivin,' " a soon-to-be
released single, and "Shut Up

and Dance," which even had
one of the stodgy Old Waldorf
waitresses swinging her hips in
the aisle.
The opening act at the Keys
tone on Friday was "San Jose's
finest," the Cornell Hurd
Band. Their music was as
thoroughly forgettable as their
name.


The Company's touring production of The Fantasticks, the longest
running off-Broadway musical, will be performed tomorrow in Tre
sidder Main Lounge at 8 p.m. Featured are (from bottom clockwise)
Kyle Treadway, Chris Kelly, Jodi Corwin, Kirk Lawson and Steve
Shafer.
Overheard after last Friday's
Rubinoos concert in the park
ing lot of the Keystone Palo
Alto: A well-tanned clean-cut
Stanford student turned to his
date and cried, "Wow, that's
the first time in my life I've re
ally gotten into rock and roll!"
"Yeah," the girl agreed, still
breathless from dancing. "Be
fore tonight, my idea of a great
show was seeing Loggins and
Messina."
Chalk up two more converts.
The Rubinoos gained plenty
last week, playing exhilarating
shows at the Old Waldorf on
Thursday night and the Keys
tone on Friday.
The concerts marked a re
turn to home for the
Berkeley-bred foursome, who
just completed a 60-date na
tional tour as the opening act
for Elvis Costello.
The Rubinoos took the stage
at the Old Waldorf wearing
their usual T-shirts, tennis
shoes and toothpaste smiles.
They looked like the "nice"
friends your kid brother used
to bring home, the ones your
mother wanted you to be just
like.
The show started slowly on
Thursday night. Lead singer
John Rubin looked and
sounded tired. The first few
songs, drawn from the
Rubinoos' latest album, Back
to the Drawing Board! were
well-played but uninspired.
Things changed quickly
though, as lead guitarist (and
songwriter) Tommy Dunbar
took control of the stage and
the crowd.
The Rubinoos play a music
brand of mid-'6os pop, drawing
heavily on "bubblegum" rock.
With the diminutive Dunbar in
control, the sense of sheer fun
was irresistible. He picked
furiously at his guitar, twisting
his face and his body like a
clown, parodying all the famil
iar poses of rock performers.
Schlock-rock
Between songs Dunbar
poked repeated jabs at
heavy-metal schlock-rock,
threatening at one poi nt to do a
Thin Lizzy medley, and con
tinually heaping abuse on
California favorite Van Halen.
Underneath the Rubinoos'
mocking tone is solid musi
cianship. Dunbar, at 22, has
developed into a first-rate

guitarist. His solos were re
markably agile, fluid and clean.
Donny Spindt, the band's
buoyant drummer, has im
proved tremendously of late.
His explosive rhythms urged
on the group, often threaten
ing to steal the show from his
front-line mates.
The Rubinoos' vocals, long
their distinctive feature, were
as sweet as ever. Rubin's lead
singing was backed up by
dazzling harmonies; on their
cover of Dance, Dance, Dance,
the band sounded as good live
as the Beach Boys did on the
studio original.
As the end of the hour-long
set approached, the Rubinoos
hit their stride.
