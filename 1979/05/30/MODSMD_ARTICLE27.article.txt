## Edelman enticing; 'High school' reeks 
### 
You're The One
Randy Edelman
Arista
Every so often, a gifted songwriter
emerges whose songs have both the
melodic power to impress performers,
who subsequently record them, and sub
stantial public appeal, leading to a hit.
Every once in a long while, the gifted
songwriter is also an accomplished per
former. Such an artist is Randy Edelman.
Edelman has written hits for Barry Manilow
("Weekend in New England") and the
Carpenters ("You"), and has had his songs
sung by numerous artists, from Dionne
Warwick to Bing Crosby. Additionally,
Edelman has previously released four solo
albums, which have established his com
petent musicianship and expertise at in
terpreting for vinyl his own songs.
Ballad
Which brings us to You're the One,
Edelman's latest album. You're the One is,
as have been Edelman's previous albums,
a primarily balladic effort. On the best
songs, Edelman is as enticing as ever.
"Don't Let Go of Me" is a light, catchy,
synthesizer-predominated love song with
enough spunk to become a hit. "You're
the One," a somewhat ominous sounding
easy listening number, keepsthe listener's
interest, and still manages to end on an up
note. "My Heart Got in the Way" takes off
on the "love is blind" theme, sounding
quite a bit like the mildly sweeping "Up
town, Uptempo Woman" from Edelman's
Fairwell Fairbanks album.
The album's two standouts, "Thirty
Years Old (Mom)" and "All Along the
Rhine," are softly delivered songs on
which Edelman and his piano are featured,
with little other accompaniment.
These songs remind one of Edelman's
first album, the obscure The Laughter and
the Tears, on which instrumentation other
than piano is sparse, poignantly accentuat
ing Edelman's clear melodies and sensitive
lyrics. The effect here is just as favorable,
as Edelman torments over leaving home in

the former tune, and as he gracefully
travels down the Rhine river in the latter
tune (which has a hymn-like soothing
quality to it).
Mediocre
Unfortunately, the remainder of the
album is untypically (for Edelman)
mediocre, and thus Edelman skirts the
same pitfall which renders his Prime Cuts
album his least satisfactory. Especially
weak are the two non-original tunes Edel
man has included here: "If This is Love"
and "Night Music." The former sounds as
if it were written for someone with a one
octave-range voice (shades of Barry Man
ilow's lesser works?), while the latter
sounds like an attempt to write a song
using two notes.
Overall, this is not Edelman's finest
work. It falls short of the overall excellence
of his last album, "If Love is Real," a con
sistently enjoyable album. But there are
enough high points on this album to give it
merit. Perhaps "You're the One" is not
really the one, or singularly wonderful,
but in the field of albums by singer
songwriters, it's one up on lots of the
other ones.
Rock 'N' Roll High School
Various Artists
Sire
Rock 'n' Roll High School (the movie to
which this album is the soundtrack) con
cerns a high school which is last in
academicsand last in sports. The students'
only interest is music. There's a female
student who idolizes the Ramones and
eventually gets to one of their concerts
and meets them, much to the chagrin of
the 'square' rulers of the high school. One
thing leads to another and in the end,
through some less than Academy Award
fetching antics, the Ramones blow up the
high school, give a concert and everyone's
happy.
Soundtrack
Now we've got a soundtrack album to
this movie. And, well, I haven't seen the

movie, but if it's comparable in quality to
this record, it's got to be as schlocky as it
sounds from the plot. The soundtrack to
Rock 'n' Roll High School is a collection of
a couple of bonifide hits, several songs
which never were hits, and several songs
which were, and still are, hits. Included in
the last category are most of the Ramones
numbers, which occupy nearly all of side
one of this disk (one Ramones tune, the
popish "I Want You Around," escapes this
classification, probably due in no small
part to wiz Phil Spector's remix).
Apart from the Ramones stuff, we've got
P.J. Soles (the female lead in the movie)
singing the bad-'6os-esque "Rock 'N' Roll
High School," one of the very same songs
the Ramones immortalized way back at the
beginning of this disk. The only thing bet
ter about this version is that Soles, not
being a singer by trade, can't scream as
loud.
That beautiful, intelligently crafted, sure
to be classic of 1973 "Smokin' in the Boys'
Room" (this is reportedly one of Bruce
Springsteen's paperboy's favorite songs)
is here. Interestingly enough, Nick Lowe's
"So it Goes," an amusing and obvious
rip-off of "Boys' Room," is also included
on this album.
Remainder
The remainder of the album consists of
the mechanical "Come Back Jonee" by
Devo, "Teenage Depression" by Eddie
and the Hot Rods (fairly mindless and loud
new wave, and I'd be depressed too, if I
had made this one), the true rock and roll
classic "School Days" by Chuck Berry, the
pleasantly spacy, but somehow pointless
in this collection "Energy Fools the Magi
cian" by Brian Eno, the balladic "A Dream
Goes On Forever" by Todd Rundgren, and
the inevitable and mindless ode (but I like
it) "School's Out" by Alice Cooper.
Alas, there you have it. A collection of
songs which, overall, reeks something aw
ful, but reeks it so consistently that it's
almost bearable. Rush out and buy it now.
Or better yet, see the movie: it doesn't
linger.
