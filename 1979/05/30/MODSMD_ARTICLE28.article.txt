## The 						Company celebrates, rejuvenates the '60s in 'Hair'

They wander into the audi
ence strewing flowers, incense
floating around them, suede
fringe swinging to the beat of
the taped rock. I study the
stage — a bare structure with a
few platforms to the right, scaf
folding for the band in the
back, and a rope swing on the
left. Someone gives me a
daisy: "You don't look like
you're really having fun."
I smile. "When does the
show start?"
He shrugs, "Whenever the
audience is ready." He hands a
stick of incense to an elderly
woman and weaves off.
The cast dances through the
aisles, clapping to the music,
and without any prompting the
audience starts clapping too,

singing along with a protest
song. More than a play, this is a
party warming up, a celebra
tion (and everyone knows it's
going to be good because now
the audience is ready).
The cast disappears and the
band struts onstage, confi
dent, exuberant. When last
season's LSJUMB drum major,
Dave Ford, starts hooting, so
does the crowd. The band be
gins a slow, mystic intro and
through the gloom chains of
actors enter from all sides of
Cubberley Auditorium. Sud
denly they're holding hands
and ceremoniously walking
over us, from one chair arm to
another. The response is im
mediate applause. Hair has be
gun.
William Swinton, as Hud,
stands center stage, looking
very small and alone, a red spot
making him glow eerily in the

darkness. He begins a rich, re
ligious "Aquarius" and soon,
lit in an unworldly blue, the rest
of the cast joins him. Their
number fills the extended
stage, their reaching arms are
everywhere: inward, to each
other, outward, to the audi
ence, and upward, to the gods.
Forty-eight arms stretch out in
a gesture that embodies the
quest of the '60s, a search for
truths, love, peace and free
dom.
We are now their age.
Self-proclaimed
When Hair first opened in
1967, the self-proclaimed
American tribal rock musical
was composed of hippies,
people older than we ever
could possibly be. In the prog-

ram, director Alllan Rivlin says,
"Relevance has been thrust
upon it (Hair) by congressmen,
energy secretaries, and gener
als."
The Company's production
of Hair couldn't have been
more aptly timed. Despite the
passage of 12 years, Hair's
questions concerning energy,
pollution and the draft remain
pertinent. While "the
psychedelic stone age" is quite
gone, Hair's college audience
understands the situation, the
statements, presented by the
tribe of hippies. When the cast
shouts, "Hell no, we won't
go," the audience shouts
along. The empathy is almost
tangible.
Although the show's sparse
dialogue does not permit plot
complexity, the cast manages
to develop fairly well-rounded
characters through voice and

action. The story revolves
around Claude, the spiritual
leader of the tribe, his confu
sion about "moment to mo
ment living on the streets,"
and his relationship with his
best friend, Berger, and being
drafted.
A dreamer
Claude, a dreamer from
Flushing who pretends to bean
Englishman, desires stability
without obligations. Berger,
the energetic leader of the
tribe, scorns his friend's fluc
tuations between social mores
and hippie life. Further com
plications are added by a chain
of unrequited love: a pregnant
Jeanie loves Claude; Claude
loves Sheila; Sheila loves
Berger, and Berger loves a

"psychedelic urchin" in San
Francisco.
The tribe responds to
Claude's draft notice with
jokes and anger but no sup
port. He tries to resist familial
and social pressures to enter
the army but cannot without
help from Berger. In the army,
through death, Claude finally
escapes all his confusion and
becomes an invisible man.
Richard Butterfield portrays
a thoughtful, bewildered and
insecure Claude. Butterfield's
Claude, "the most beautiful
beast in the forest," goes
beyond a conceited veneer
and reveals an inner struggle
between tribal/peer values
and social obligations. His
clear, resonant voice can be
rousing, as in ''I Got Life," or
poignant, as in "Where Do I
Go" and"The Flesh Failures."
Dan Gunther is the high

spirited Berger. On stage,
Cunther's charismatic pre
sence seems the backbone of
energy for the cast. Cunther's
voice is pleasing, his spirit in
fectious. He never stops mov
ing and dances in an almost
vaudevillian style. Though
Berger's person and
philosophy tempt, the charac
ter's irresponsibility, even in
love and friendship, keep him
from being one-sided.
Sheila
Renee Richards also creates
a rounded character in her
Sheila. Despite Sheila's caref
ree attitude, as in "I Believe in
Love," she also holds tradi
tional attitudes in her relation
ship with Berger. Richards'
"Easy To Be Hard" is powerful

and moving, as is her "Good
Morning Starshine." The lat
ter, a cheery tune sung on
Claude's last evening with the
tribe, proves striking in its con
text.
The production is particu
larly impressive in the depth of
its talent. Naturally, the three
leads sing and act well but so
does everyone in the cast.
Drue Bralove gives us a con
vincingly drugged out and
abandoned leanie. When she
is pulled away from Claude for
the last time, her sorrow holds
the audience silent. John Pom
fret adds much humor as the
sexually confused Mick Jagger
fan: "I'm not a homosexual
. . . but I'd love to go to bed
with him.'' Julie Henry plays
both Abe Lincoln and delivers a
teasing, night-clubbish "White
Boys." The list goes on.
Director Rivlin manages his
large cast well through the fre
quent scene changes. The
show moves surprisingly
quickly through its three
hours. The interpretation of
characters provides a balance
of laughter and sensitivity.
Choreography
Dawn Todd's choreog
raphy, which consists basically
of modern dance, with ele
ments of jazz and ballet, is vis
ually interesting. Todd
choreographed simple move
ment that, when performed by
many, looks complex.
The band, directed by Peter
Maradudin, plays good solid
rock without drowning out the
singers. No one stands out in
the band since all the musi
cians play very well. They
prove adept at styles ranging
from the country twangy
"Don't Put It Down," to a rauc

ous "Hair."
Light design, also by
Maradudin, adds tremend
ously to Hair's atmosphere.
While the actors are occasion
ally in shadow, the special
lighting effects amend any
faults. Strobe lighting imparts
an unreal, frightening quality
to a hallucination scene. Al
though not so startling,
Maradudin's blue lighting of
tl».e stage backdrop makes the
band look as if they stand at the
edge of a netherland, that life
lies in front of them, on the
stage.
Immediacy
Although Hair is over, it's dif
ficult not to speak in the pre
sent tense about the show.
There was an immediacy to the
production that lingers after

the last bows were taken, and
the applause finally died down.
Surely a reviewer loses credi
bility when only praise is of
fered but criticisms (yes, there
was an occasional buzz in the
sound system, true, the
make-up could have been less
obvious. . .) seems petty in
comparison to the ac
complishments of the Com
pany's production.
Producer Todd Harris and
his troupe deserve high praise
for presenting a view of the '60s
that is neither one-sided nor
trite; that is germane because
it deals with the ageless human
quest fortruth, love, peaceand
freedom. The closing song,
"The Flesh Failures (Let the Sun
Shine In)" rises above its dirge
like beginnings and becomes a
prayer for the future.

They wander into the audi

floating around them, suede
fringe swinging to the beat of

stage — a bare structure with a
few platforms to the right, scaf
folding for the band in the
back, and a rope swing on the
left. Someone gives me a
daisy: "You don't look like
you're really having fun."
I smile. "When does the
show start?"
He shrugs, "Whenever the
audience is ready." He hands a
stick of incense to an elderly
woman and weaves off.
The cast dances through the
aisles, clapping to the music,
and without any prompting the
audience starts clapping too,

singing along with a protest
song. More than a play, this is a
party warming up, a celebra
tion (and everyone knows it's
going to be good because now
the audience is ready).
The cast disappears and the
band struts onstage, confi
dent, exuberant. When last
season's LSJUMB drum major,
Dave Ford, starts hooting, so
does the crowd. The band be
gins a slow, mystic intro and
through the gloom chains of
actors enter from all sides of
Cubberley Auditorium. Sud
denly they're holding hands
and ceremoniously walking
over us, from one chair arm to
another. The response is im
mediate applause. Hair has be
gun.
William Swinton, as Hud,
stands center stage, looking
very small and alone, a red spot
making him glow eerily in the

darkness. He begins a rich, re
ligious "Aquarius" and soon,
lit in an unworldly blue, the rest
of the cast joins him. Their
number fills the extended
stage, their reaching arms are
everywhere: inward, to each
other, outward, to the audi
ence, and upward, to the gods.
Forty-eight arms stretch out in
a gesture that embodies the
quest of the '60s, a search for
truths, love, peace and free
dom.
We are now their age.
Self-proclaimed
When Hair first opened in
1967, the self-proclaimed
American tribal rock musical
was composed of hippies,
people older than we ever
could possibly be. In the prog-

ram, director Alllan Rivlin says,
"Relevance has been thrust
upon it (Hair) by congressmen,
energy secretaries, and gener
als."
The Company's production
of Hair couldn't have been
more aptly timed. Despite the
passage of 12 years, Hair's
questions concerning energy,
pollution and the draft remain
pertinent. While "the
psychedelic stone age" is quite
gone, Hair's college audience
understands the situation, the
statements, presented by the
tribe of hippies. When the cast
shouts, "Hell no, we won't
go," the audience shouts
along. The empathy is almost
tangible.
Although the show's sparse
dialogue does not permit plot
complexity, the cast manages
to develop fairly well-rounded
characters through voice and

action. The story revolves
around Claude, the spiritual
leader of the tribe, his confu
sion about "moment to mo
ment living on the streets,"
and his relationship with his
best friend, Berger, and being
drafted.
A dreamer
Claude, a dreamer from
Flushing who pretends to bean
Englishman, desires stability
without obligations. Berger,
the energetic leader of the
tribe, scorns his friend's fluc
tuations between social mores
and hippie life. Further com
plications are added by a chain
of unrequited love: a pregnant
Jeanie loves Claude; Claude
loves Sheila; Sheila loves
Berger, and Berger loves a

"psychedelic urchin" in San
Francisco.
The tribe responds to
Claude's draft notice with
jokes and anger but no sup
port. He tries to resist familial
and social pressures to enter
the army but cannot without
help from Berger. In the army,
through death, Claude finally
escapes all his confusion and
becomes an invisible man.
Richard Butterfield portrays
a thoughtful, bewildered and
insecure Claude. Butterfield's
Claude, "the most beautiful
beast in the forest," goes
beyond a conceited veneer
and reveals an inner struggle
between tribal/peer values
and social obligations. His
clear, resonant voice can be
rousing, as in ''I Got Life," or
poignant, as in "Where Do I
Go" and"The Flesh Failures."
Dan Gunther is the high

spirited Berger. On stage,
Cunther's charismatic pre
sence seems the backbone of
energy for the cast. Cunther's
voice is pleasing, his spirit in
fectious. He never stops mov
ing and dances in an almost
vaudevillian style. Though
Berger's person and
philosophy tempt, the charac
ter's irresponsibility, even in
love and friendship, keep him
from being one-sided.
Sheila
Renee Richards also creates
a rounded character in her
Sheila. Despite Sheila's caref
ree attitude, as in "I Believe in
Love," she also holds tradi
tional attitudes in her relation
ship with Berger. Richards'
"Easy To Be Hard" is powerful

and moving, as is her "Good
Morning Starshine." The lat
ter, a cheery tune sung on
Claude's last evening with the
tribe, proves striking in its con
text.
The production is particu
larly impressive in the depth of
its talent. Naturally, the three
leads sing and act well but so
does everyone in the cast.
Drue Bralove gives us a con
vincingly drugged out and
abandoned leanie. When she
is pulled away from Claude for
the last time, her sorrow holds
the audience silent. John Pom
fret adds much humor as the
sexually confused Mick Jagger
fan: "I'm not a homosexual
. . . but I'd love to go to bed
with him.'' Julie Henry plays
both Abe Lincoln and delivers a
teasing, night-clubbish "White
Boys." The list goes on.
Director Rivlin manages his
large cast well through the fre
quent scene changes. The
show moves surprisingly
quickly through its three
hours. The interpretation of
characters provides a balance
of laughter and sensitivity.
Choreography
Dawn Todd's choreog
raphy, which consists basically
of modern dance, with ele
ments of jazz and ballet, is vis
ually interesting. Todd
choreographed simple move
ment that, when performed by
many, looks complex.
The band, directed by Peter
Maradudin, plays good solid
rock without drowning out the
singers. No one stands out in
the band since all the musi
cians play very well. They
prove adept at styles ranging
from the country twangy
"Don't Put It Down," to a rauc

Light design, also by
Maradudin, adds tremend
ously to Hair's atmosphere.
While the actors are occasion
ally in shadow, the special
lighting effects amend any
faults. Strobe lighting imparts
an unreal, frightening quality
to a hallucination scene. Al
though not so startling,
Maradudin's blue lighting of
tl».e stage backdrop makes the
band look as if they stand at the
edge of a netherland, that life
lies in front of them, on the
stage.

Although Hair is over, it's dif

ter's irresponsibility, even in
love and friendship, keep him
from being one-sided.
Sheila
Renee Richards also creates
a rounded character in her
Sheila. Despite Sheila's caref
ree attitude, as in "I Believe in
Love," she also holds tradi
tional attitudes in her relation
ship with Berger. Richards'
"Easy To Be Hard" is powerful

and moving, as is her "Good
Morning Starshine." The lat
ter, a cheery tune sung on
Claude's last evening with the
tribe, proves striking in its con
text.
The production is particu
larly impressive in the depth of
its talent. Naturally, the three
leads sing and act well but so
does everyone in the cast.
Drue Bralove gives us a con
vincingly drugged out and
abandoned leanie. When she
is pulled away from Claude for
the last time, her sorrow holds
the audience silent. John Pom
fret adds much humor as the
sexually confused Mick Jagger
fan: "I'm not a homosexual
. . . but I'd love to go to bed
with him.'' Julie Henry plays
both Abe Lincoln and delivers a
teasing, night-clubbish "White
Boys." The list goes on.
Director Rivlin manages his
large cast well through the fre
quent scene changes. The
show moves surprisingly
quickly through its three
hours. The interpretation of
characters provides a balance
of laughter and sensitivity.
Choreography
Dawn Todd's choreog
raphy, which consists basically
of modern dance, with ele
ments of jazz and ballet, is vis
ually interesting. Todd
choreographed simple move
ment that, when performed by
many, looks complex.
The band, directed by Peter
Maradudin, plays good solid
rock without drowning out the
singers. No one stands out in
the band since all the musi
cians play very well. They
prove adept at styles ranging
from the country twangy
"Don't Put It Down," to a rauc

ous "Hair."
Light design, also by
Maradudin, adds tremend
ously to Hair's atmosphere.
While the actors are occasion
ally in shadow, the special
lighting effects amend any
faults. Strobe lighting imparts
an unreal, frightening quality
to a hallucination scene. Al
though not so startling,
Maradudin's blue lighting of
tl».e stage backdrop makes the
band look as if they stand at the
edge of a netherland, that life
lies in front of them, on the
stage.
Immediacy
Although Hair is over, it's dif
ficult not to speak in the pre
sent tense about the show.
There was an immediacy to the
production that lingers after

the last bows were taken, and
the applause finally died down.
Surely a reviewer loses credi
bility when only praise is of
fered but criticisms (yes, there
was an occasional buzz in the
sound system, true, the
make-up could have been less
obvious. . .) seems petty in
comparison to the ac
complishments of the Com
pany's production.
Producer Todd Harris and
his troupe deserve high praise
for presenting a view of the '60s
that is neither one-sided nor
trite; that is germane because
it deals with the ageless human
quest fortruth, love, peaceand
freedom. The closing song,
"The Flesh Failures (Let the Sun
Shine In)" rises above its dirge
like beginnings and becomes a
prayer for the future.

Sheila
They wander into the audi
ence strewing flowers, incense
floating around them, suede
fringe swinging to the beat of
the taped rock. I study the
stage — a bare structure with a
few platforms to the right, scaf
folding for the band in the
back, and a rope swing on the
left. Someone gives me a
daisy: "You don't look like
you're really having fun."
I smile. "When does the
show start?"
He shrugs, "Whenever the
audience is ready." He hands a
stick of incense to an elderly
woman and weaves off.
The cast dances through the
aisles, clapping to the music,
and without any prompting the
audience starts clapping too,

singing along with a protest
song. More than a play, this is a
party warming up, a celebra
tion (and everyone knows it's
going to be good because now
the audience is ready).
The cast disappears and the
band struts onstage, confi
dent, exuberant. When last
season's LSJUMB drum major,
Dave Ford, starts hooting, so
does the crowd. The band be
gins a slow, mystic intro and
through the gloom chains of
actors enter from all sides of
Cubberley Auditorium. Sud
denly they're holding hands
and ceremoniously walking
over us, from one chair arm to
another. The response is im
mediate applause. Hair has be
gun.
William Swinton, as Hud,
stands center stage, looking
very small and alone, a red spot
making him glow eerily in the

darkness. He begins a rich, re
ligious "Aquarius" and soon,
lit in an unworldly blue, the rest
of the cast joins him. Their
number fills the extended
stage, their reaching arms are
everywhere: inward, to each
other, outward, to the audi
ence, and upward, to the gods.
Forty-eight arms stretch out in
a gesture that embodies the
quest of the '60s, a search for
truths, love, peace and free
dom.
We are now their age.
Self-proclaimed
When Hair first opened in
1967, the self-proclaimed
American tribal rock musical
was composed of hippies,
people older than we ever
could possibly be. In the prog-

ram, director Alllan Rivlin says,
"Relevance has been thrust
upon it (Hair) by congressmen,
energy secretaries, and gener
als."
The Company's production
of Hair couldn't have been
more aptly timed. Despite the
passage of 12 years, Hair's
questions concerning energy,
pollution and the draft remain
pertinent. While "the
psychedelic stone age" is quite
gone, Hair's college audience
understands the situation, the
statements, presented by the
tribe of hippies. When the cast
shouts, "Hell no, we won't
go," the audience shouts
along. The empathy is almost
tangible.
Although the show's sparse
dialogue does not permit plot
complexity, the cast manages
to develop fairly well-rounded
characters through voice and

action. The story revolves
around Claude, the spiritual
leader of the tribe, his confu
sion about "moment to mo
ment living on the streets,"
and his relationship with his
best friend, Berger, and being
drafted.
A dreamer
Claude, a dreamer from
Flushing who pretends to bean
Englishman, desires stability
without obligations. Berger,
the energetic leader of the
tribe, scorns his friend's fluc
tuations between social mores
and hippie life. Further com
plications are added by a chain
of unrequited love: a pregnant
Jeanie loves Claude; Claude
loves Sheila; Sheila loves
Berger, and Berger loves a

"psychedelic urchin" in San
Francisco.
The tribe responds to
Claude's draft notice with
jokes and anger but no sup
port. He tries to resist familial
and social pressures to enter
the army but cannot without
help from Berger. In the army,
through death, Claude finally
escapes all his confusion and
becomes an invisible man.
Richard Butterfield portrays
a thoughtful, bewildered and
insecure Claude. Butterfield's
Claude, "the most beautiful
beast in the forest," goes
beyond a conceited veneer
and reveals an inner struggle
between tribal/peer values
and social obligations. His
clear, resonant voice can be
rousing, as in ''I Got Life," or
poignant, as in "Where Do I
Go" and"The Flesh Failures."
Dan Gunther is the high

spirited Berger. On stage,
Cunther's charismatic pre
sence seems the backbone of
energy for the cast. Cunther's
voice is pleasing, his spirit in
fectious. He never stops mov
ing and dances in an almost
vaudevillian style. Though
Berger's person and
philosophy tempt, the charac
ter's irresponsibility, even in
love and friendship, keep him
from being one-sided.
Sheila
Renee Richards also creates
a rounded character in her
Sheila. Despite Sheila's caref
ree attitude, as in "I Believe in
Love," she also holds tradi
tional attitudes in her relation
ship with Berger. Richards'
"Easy To Be Hard" is powerful

and moving, as is her "Good
Morning Starshine." The lat
ter, a cheery tune sung on
Claude's last evening with the
tribe, proves striking in its con
text.
The production is particu
larly impressive in the depth of
its talent. Naturally, the three
leads sing and act well but so
does everyone in the cast.
Drue Bralove gives us a con
vincingly drugged out and
abandoned leanie. When she
is pulled away from Claude for
the last time, her sorrow holds
the audience silent. John Pom
fret adds much humor as the
sexually confused Mick Jagger
fan: "I'm not a homosexual
. . . but I'd love to go to bed
with him.'' Julie Henry plays
both Abe Lincoln and delivers a
teasing, night-clubbish "White
Boys." The list goes on.
Director Rivlin manages his
large cast well through the fre
quent scene changes. The
show moves surprisingly
quickly through its three
