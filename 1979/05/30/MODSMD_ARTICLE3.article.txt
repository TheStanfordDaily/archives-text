# Prof claims Soviets attack U.S. oil flow
## Anti-Semitism could disrupt Mideast 
### Jenny Smith 
A recent Soviet government article
attacking Judaism as a religion is only
part of a propaganda plan to weaken
the United States by "aiming at U.S.
oil supplies," according to Emeritus
Prof. Ronald Hilton.
By playing on anti-Israeli senti
ments in the Middle East, the Soviets
are attempting to encourage other
countries to reduce or eliminate oil
exports to Israel, says Hilton, editor
of the World Affairs Report, journal of
the California Institute of Interna
tional Studies.
In the long run, U.S. oil supplies
will be threatened because of its ag
reement to ensure a full oil supply for
Israel, according to Hilton.
"An open attack on Jews and
Freemasonry broke out," says Hil
ton, "with the publication in Kom
somolskaya Pravda of an article by
Soviet Prof. Valezy Emilyanov urging
the Central Committee of the Com
munist Party 'to form a large anti-
Zionist and anti-Masonic front,' simi
lar to the anti-fascist front of the
1930s and 19405.
"Emilyanov went on to urge the
launching of a campaign" against
Zionism and Freemansonry and their
common source, Judaism, Hilton
says.
'Much larger picture'
The anti-Jewish propaganda ''is
only a small part of a much larger
picture," a plan to weaken U.S. oil
supplies, he says.
Hilton explains that anti-Jewish
sentiments in the Middle East have
already caused Iran to cut off oil ex
ports to Israel. In addition, Saudi
Arabia will cut off Egypt's oil imports,
and has already prohibited Egyptian
workers from working in Arab oil
fields.
The U.S. government has already
committed itself to supplying Israel
with oil, Hilton says."The question
is, how much oil are we supposed to
give Israel and Egypt?" That com
mitment would naturally decrease

U.S. oil supplies, according to Hil
ton.
In addition, increased anti-)ewish
sentiments in Middle Eastern oil
producing countries might cause
them to limit supplies to the United
States if they feel that Israel and Egypt
are being supplied with U.S. oil.
One danger of a decrease in U.S.
oil supplies, Hilton said, is that the
U.S. government has said that if our
supplies are threatened, force will be
used to regain them.
"Two things will happen if that oc
curs," Hilton said. "First, there will
be an uproar in the United States
similar to that during Vietnam.
Americans will not want to get in
volved in such action.
"Secondly, Europe will not sup
port the United States on this, and
we will be fighting alone."
Showdown
Hilton says, "If it came to a show
down, the behavior of the U.S.
would resemble that of France in
World War II because of the same
lack of national will and consensus."
In essence, he says, the survival of
the United States is at stake; "I am
worried that no one here is saying
anything about it. It is much more
than a question of anti-Semitism."
Emilyanov's article was published
four months ago. Since then, Soviet
anti-Semitic sentiments have inten
sified because of increased aware
ness of the emigration of Jews to the
United States as a result of U.S. pres
sure. "The question the Soviets are
asking is, 'why can the Jews leave
Russia and no one else?' " Hilton
says.
U.S. demands
The Soviet government is comply
ing with U.S. demands for Jewish
emigration, Hilton said, "because
the Soviets want the SALT II agree
ment to pass, and because they want
the most favored state in trade status
from the United States."
The Soviet consulate in San Fran
cisco would not comment on the

already caused Iran to cut off oil ex
ports to Israel. In addition, Saudi
Arabia will cut off Egypt's oil imports,
and has already prohibited Egyptian
workers from working in Arab oil
fields.
The U.S. government has already
committed itself to supplying Israel
with oil, Hilton says."The question
is, how much oil are we supposed to
give Israel and Egypt?" That com
mitment would naturally decrease

U.S. oil supplies, according to Hil
ton.
In addition, increased anti-)ewish
sentiments in Middle Eastern oil
producing countries might cause
them to limit supplies to the United
States if they feel that Israel and Egypt
are being supplied with U.S. oil.
One danger of a decrease in U.S.
oil supplies, Hilton said, is that the
U.S. government has said that if our
supplies are threatened, force will be
used to regain them.
"Two things will happen if that oc
curs," Hilton said. "First, there will
be an uproar in the United States
similar to that during Vietnam.
Americans will not want to get in
volved in such action.
"Secondly, Europe will not sup
port the United States on this, and
we will be fighting alone."
Showdown
Hilton says, "If it came to a show
down, the behavior of the U.S.
would resemble that of France in
World War II because of the same
lack of national will and consensus."
In essence, he says, the survival of
the United States is at stake; "I am
worried that no one here is saying
anything about it. It is much more
than a question of anti-Semitism."
Emilyanov's article was published
four months ago. Since then, Soviet
anti-Semitic sentiments have inten
sified because of increased aware
ness of the emigration of Jews to the
United States as a result of U.S. pres
sure. "The question the Soviets are
asking is, 'why can the Jews leave
Russia and no one else?' " Hilton
says.
U.S. demands
The Soviet government is comply
ing with U.S. demands for Jewish
emigration, Hilton said, "because
the Soviets want the SALT II agree
ment to pass, and because they want
the most favored state in trade status
from the United States."
The Soviet consulate in San Fran
cisco would not comment on the
matter.
