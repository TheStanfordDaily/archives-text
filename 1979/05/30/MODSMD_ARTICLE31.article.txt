New Rhodesian PM 'hopeful'
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Bishop Abel
Muzorewa was sworn in yesterday as
Rhodesia's first black prime minister and de
clared he was "more confident and more
hopeful every day" about the future of the
troubled nation he inherits after nine decades
of white rule.
Josiah Cumede, elected Monday, was sworn
in as president, then formally asked the black
Methodist Muzorewa to form a government.
The outdoor ceremony at the State House,
combining colonial-era pomp and tribal jubila
tion, was the last before the new government
takes charge at midnight tomorrow.
Sharing the stage with the black leaders
were outgoing white Prime Minister lan Smith,
winding up 15 years as leader of the white
minority government, and Chief Justice Hec
tor Mac Donald, resplendent in the white wig
and red robe of British colonial days.
Rhodesia broke unilaterally from Britain in
1965 to avert black-majority rule.
Judge in drug probe killed
San Antonio, Texas — A federal judge was
shot and killed yesterday as he left his apart
ment, the second time in seven months that an
official involved in West Texas drug investiga
tions was the target of a shooting.
The victim, U.S. District judge John Wood
Jr., 63, had been under protection by federal
marshals, but he recently told them he no
longer needed their help.
Wood's landlady at the Chateau Dijon
apartments said, however, that the judge had
told her he felt his life might be in danger.
Wood had been granted protection in
November, after Assistant U.S. Attorney James
Kerr, chief prosecutor in the drug cases, nar
rowly escaped death when his car was riddled
by bullets as he sat in it.
Federal authorities had no immediate com
ment on Wood's shooting, but law enforce
ment officers were searching for a man driving
a small red car. Eyewitnesses told police the
assailant was in his early 20s and had curly hair.
Wood apparently had tried to start his car
and had gotten out when he was confronted
by his killer, police said. He was shot once in
the lower back and was pronounced dead on
arrival at 9:30 a.m. at Northeast Baptist Hospi
tal.
Truckers may strike over fuel
Los Angeles — The nation's independent
truck owner-operators could stage a nation
wide strike in protest of soaring diesel fuel
prices if the government doesn't act to in

crease fuel allotments and deregulate truck
ing, an industry spokesman said yesterday.
"Getting the fuel has been as big a problem
as prices," said Mike Parkhurst, president of
the Independent Truckers Association. "A lot
of truck stops are rationing fuel, in some cases
just enough to get a trucker about 20 miles."
Parkhurst said he petitioned the federal De
partment of Energy on May 18 to allocate 100
percent of fuel needs to truck stops. At the
same time, he also petitioned the federal In
terstate Commerce Commission to de
regulate trucking to fill up empty trucks and
allow independent truckers to compete.
Parkhurst said he had been in telephone
contact with both agencies, but would not
elaborate on the content of the conversations.
However, he said a press conference was
scheduled for this morning.
At that conference, Parkhurst said the
strategy the truckers might take would be out
lined, but he refused to say if that strategy
included a shutdown, although he indicated
many truckers were leaning in that direction.
Walkout follows Dow blast
Pittsburg, Ca. — About 50 asbestos workers
stayed away from their jobs yesterday at a Dow
Chemical Co. plant where a weekend explo
sion left two men dead.
"They said they just didn't feel like working
today in view of what happened Saturday,"
said company spokesman Jack Jones. "Also,
many of them said they had doctors appoint
ments."
Officials of Local 16 of the International As
sociation of Heat and Frost Insulators and As
bestos Workers said the union would call
another meeting this morning to determine if
they would return to work.
They refused to characterize the workers
taking the day off as constituting a work stop
page.
An explosion Saturday in a newly installed
600-gallon tank used to make pesticides killed
two workers and sent more than 100 people to
the hospital for treatment. Most of the injured
were released. Glass, metal fragments and a
cloud of chlorine gas spewed into the sky.
Jones said the tank area had been closed and
no workers would be assigned to the pes
ticides producing unit until an investigation by
Dow engineers is completed.
The 50 asbestos workers were not Dow
employees but were part of a subcontractor.
Jones said all Dow employees had returned to
work.
Dow officials agreed Monday not to operate
any chemical units if insulation workers are
nearby. They also agreed to allow union rep
resentatives to tour the site.

Damages from the explosion were estimated
at $1 million.
PG&E seeks millions in hikes
San Francisco — Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
yesterday asked the state Public Utilities
Commission for an annual $131 million in
crease in electric rates and a $303.2 million
annual natural gas rate hike to offset higher
fuel costs.
The new rates would raise an average resi
dential customer's monthly bill $1.19 for elec
tricity and $2.43 for gas, according to Leland
Gardner, PG&E rate department manager.
This is a 10.7 percent overall increase for
typical households using 6000 kilowatt hours
of electricity and 840 therms of gas annually.
Gardner said the increases are needed to
pay higher costs of natural gas, fuel oil and
electricity purchased from suppliers.
Anti-abortion law upheld
San Francisco — A California law blocking
the use of state funds for 95 percent of Medi-
Cal abortions was ruled constitutional yester
day by the state Court of Appeal.
The 2-1 decision ruled that the Budget Act of
1978, which excludes such funds for elective
abortions, was "not unconstitutional."
An attorney for the Committee to Defend
Reproductive Rights said the group will go to
the California Supreme Court immediately for
a stay pending appeal.
But the court found the Act conflicts with
federal law in that it does not pay for certain
abortions where severe and long lasting physi
cal health damage to the mother would result if
a pregnancy were carried to term.
Because of this, the case was sent back to
San Francisco Superior Court with directions
that an injunction be issued against the Act
"only to the extent necessary" to conform with
the Court of Appeal's views.
The restrictions placed on such abortions by
the law had been stayed by the Court of Appe
als while it considered the matter.
The Committee, various other welfare and
health care rights organizations, three physi
cians, one patient and one taxpayer had chal
lenged the provisions of the 1978 budget law.
'America's Sweetheart' dies
Hollywood — Mary Pickford, who as
"America's Sweetheart" kept an age of inno
cence alive on the silver screen during the
roaring '20s, died yesterday at Santa Monica
Hospital of a stroke, her secretary said.
Secretary Linda Humphries said Pickford,
86, had been in apparently good health until

Friday, when her husband, actor-musician
Charles "Buddy" Rogers, entered her bed
room and found her in a failing condition.
He summoned a doctor, and Pickford was
rushed to the hospital, where her condition
deteriorated.
Death came about 2 p.m. PDT.
Pickford had been entertaining a house
guest, she said, and was visiting with her every
day until Friday.
"She was a strong-minded woman and she
fought for her life," said Humphries. "But her
age was against her."
Her secretary said Pickford never revealed
why she quit the movies at age 40 — after
making more than 200 films between 1909 and
1933 — but the actress had told friends she
preferred to be remembered as she appeared
in herheyday — asweet, spunky, innocent and
wholesome girl with golden tresses.
Sonics win 114-112
Seattle — Guards Gus Williams and Dennis
Johnson combined for 68 points, including
eight in overtime last night, as the Seattle
SuperSonics outfought the Washington Bul
lets 114-112.
The Sonics now lead 3-1 in the National Bas
ketball Association's playoff finals.
The SuperSonics can wrap up the first
championship in their 12-year history with a
victory Friday night in Landover, Md. If
Washington wins that game, the best-of-seven
series would come back for Game Six Sunday
at the Coliseum, where Seattle has won 25 of
its last 26 outings.
It was a rugged, almost brutal game, with a
host of players on each team getting in foul
trouble. By the end, the Bullets' entire front
line had fouled out.
Stocks decline slightly
New York — Stock prices declined slightly in
quiet trading yesterday as energy worries kept
a damper on the market.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
coming off a 5.63 loss last week before the
Memorial Day weekend, dropped another 3.73
to 832.55.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
totaled 27.04 million shares, down from 27.81
million Friday.
Today's weather
