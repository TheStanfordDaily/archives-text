## Carter grants extra authority in case of gas shortage 
### 
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday he has signed an executive order giving the na
tion's governors authority to help alleviate gasoline
shortages this summer.
At a nationally broadcast news conference, the presi
dent said the order gives the governors authority to
require that some gasoline stations remain open on
weekends, to set minimum purchases to avoid topping
off tanks, and to institute an odd-even celling system to
avoid long lines.
Carter, who also was called upon to defend his fre
quent travel by helicopter in a time of gasoline shortage,
said the order would "simply make it more convenient
for drivers to purchase gasoline" but will not save fuel.
He said continued "care, planning and conservation"
would be necessary throughout the summer to avoid
lines at gasoline pumps as well as spot shortages.
The president said the nation could expect a "mild
increase" in the supply of oil "which should help al
leviate spot shortages." But he cautioned that "at best"
the gasoline available would only equal last summer's
supply, even though the demand has increased.
He again called upon Americans to conserve, saying
the Memorial Day weekend just ended — when many

travelers used public transportation — shows it is possi
ble.
The White House later released a "fact sheet" specify
ing that the order allows governors to act in the absence
of emergency powers granted by state legislatures.
Asked pointedly why he has traveled by helicopter
twice in recent weeks on fishing trips, Carter replied,
"It's much less expensive."
Without citing the actual cost, Carter said helicopter
travel was less expensive than a motorcade that required
a "very large entourage including seven or eight car
loads of press" as well as police guarding each intersec
tion the motorcade passed.
On private trips such as the fishing expeditions, how
ever, the "pool reporters" who accompany the presi
dent are limited to two small vans.
Turning to inflation, Carter said he intended to "stick
with" his voluntary anti-inflation program though "it's
going to require some time for it to be effective."
He said the alternative of mandatory wage-price con
trols was unacceptable, even though the current wage
guideline of 7 percent falls far short of the increase in
inflation. Over the past three months, prices have been
increasing at an annual rate of 13.9 percent.
