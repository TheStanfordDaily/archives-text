# In interview, assistant dean criticizes policy
## Minority law admissions suffer from 'lack of commitment' 
### Pamela Johnson 
The Law School has historically shown "a basic
lack of commitment to the minority student," ac
cording to La Doris Cordell, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs at the Law School. And, she said, she
feels minorities have suffered because of this lack
of commitment.
"I think the Law School has come a long way
since 1968 and 1969 when the first black and
Chicano lawyers graduated but I believe that the
school must do more to attract and recruit
(minorities), especially in financial areas," Cordell
said in an interview.
"Minority students are discouraged when they
learn that the first minorities were graduated only
ten or eleven years ago; they feel unwanted."
Cordell says minority women suffer most from this
lack of commitment.
"The minority women are having a problem just
staying in the profession,"Cordell explained.
so few role models, many women feel that
perhaps both a career and a family is simply an
impossibility."
Cordell said that when the pressures of career
and family mount, the career is usually the first to
go. "The most common situation, though, is that
of the single or divorced woman who doesn't want
to be."
Recently, at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund's

commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Brown
vs. Board of Education, Cordell said shewas seated
next to a woman who said she was bitter, '"I
shouldn't have to be alone. Why do I have to be
alone?'"
The Law School needs to re-evaluate its criteria
tor admission, as some minorities don't under
stand the importance of preparation for the Law
School Admissions Test (LSAT), says Cordell.
Many potentially successful students are lost be
cause of this lack of understanding, Cordell ad
ded.
One answer, she said she believes, is in the
financing of LSAT preparatory courses at several
undergraduate institutions, another is bringing
minority applicants to the campus for personal
interviews.
Increase applicant pool?
These two solutions, according to Cordell,
would increase the pool of minority applicants and
make the admission decision less dependent on
standardized test scores. "This year, I was given
the opportunity to fly five minority applicants out;
three of them will be here in the fall. . . I think that
many of the applicants from the East Coast are
reluctant to venture out to California; they don't
know what's out here.
"I'm using all my resources—alumni, faculty,

students and staff," Cordell said.
Emily Canales, assistant director of admissions
at the Business School, said she believes that the
Business School is committed to minority recruit
ment. "Active recruitment of minorities has been
going on since the late 60's; there is no doubt that
improvements could be made, but given the re
sources that we have, we feel we're doing a good
job."
"Presently we're conducting an uncontrolled
experiment to attract minorities," said Dr. John
Steward, associate dean of students at the Medical
School. "But," he added, "we won't have any
meaningful data for two to three years. The effect
of the Bakke decision is undeterminable until next
fall because of the adjustments students make
over the summer, but more minority students are
holding places this year than last."
In an effort to bring minority women together
on substantive legal issues, the University will host
a series of discussions and seminars here July 5-7. |
Minority women attorneys from all over California j
will be invited to hear panelists from across the
nation. Cordell said she believes that getting Stan
ford to host this meeting is important because it
shows that the problems of minority women
lawyers have been recognized by a respected in
stitution.
