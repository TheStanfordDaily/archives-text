# Students work with disturbed youth
## 
### Kerri Culbertson 
Frustrating, exasperating,
encouraging, re
warding. Volunteers at the
Peninsula Children's Center
(PCC) use all these words to
describe working with a dis
turbed child.
PCC, at 3860 Middlefield
Road in Palo Alto, is a day
treatment center for disturbed
children. A private, non-profit
program, it serves children be
tween the ages of three and 18
who range from being moder
ately disturbed to severely dys
functional. Autistic, schizop
hrenic and behaviorally disor
dered are diagnostic labels car
ried by many of them.
PCC, together with the
SWOPSI program, have de
veloped a successful two
quarter course entitled "Work
ng Effectively with Disturbed
Children," which allows stu
dents here to work directly
with the center. Initially or
ganized six years ago, the
course had to be discontinued
last year due to lack of student
interest. Nevertheless, the
volunteer program is doing
well again this year.
And luckily so. PCC staff
members say the volunteers
are essential to the program.
"We could not survive with
out the help of the volun
teers," said Janina Nadaner,
PCC staff member and one of
the two SWOPSI instructors.
The children sometimes need
one-on-one attention, and it
could not be met without the
help of the volunteers, she
explained.
Six hours weekly
In the SWOPSI class, stu
dents are required to put in a
minimum of six hours each
week working with the chil
dren.
Each student is assigned to a
staff member and under that
person's supervision, works
with a small group of children
or adolescents.
The volunteers are encour
aged to discuss the day's ac
tivities with the staff member,
usually a child therapist, in an
effort to learn how to use a var
iety of treatment and special
education techniques.
Discussing the treatment
processes with the child
therapist is important, not only

to maximize the volunteer's
learning, but also to make the
volunteer a useful aide to the
child therapist and to the dis
turbed children, staff members
said.
The first step into a clas
sroom holding nine or 10 dis
turbed children and one staff
member is an uneasy experi
ence. Volunteers are often
confused as to how and when
to treat the children. "Should I
discipline them, or let them
be? How much disciplining is
necessary to enforce the rules?
Should I physically punish a
disturbed child?" Answers are
learned mostly through ex
perience and through the gui
dance of the child therapist.
Frustrating, uneasy
"There were some frustrat
ing and uneasy times," recalls
volunteer Lissy Clad. "For in
stance, at the very beginning,
getting to know the kids and
their individual problems was
hard. I had to get to know each
problem separately.
"A lot that made my experi
ence a good one, was my child
therapist," Glad continued.
"We would always stav after

school and he would explain
the children's problems so that
I could understand them, so
we wouldn't be clueless as to
what to do in the classroom."
In addition to the minimum
six hours of volunteer work at
PCC, the SWOPSI student is
required to attend a two-hour
lecture-discussion seminar
each week where assigned
readings are discussed along
with experiences at the center.
Practical skills of discipline and
forming expectations are also
covered.
"The seminars make it more
relevant to the student," said
Nadaner. "They try to pull to
gether the experiences the
volunteers encounter while
working directly with the chil
dren."
Students who have worked
at PCC usually describe it as a
rewarding experience.
'Great' experience
"It was great," Clad said, "I
want to go back to visit. Just
having the kids say 'hi' to me
the minute I walk in the door,
or having them say that they
want to work with me, or hav
ing them run up and hug me,

was really neat."
But this is not to say that
there were not difficult times,
as well.
"The part that bothered me
the most was that when I left, I
didn't see any change. The kids
hadn't improved in the five
months I was there," said vol
unteer Laurie Heist. "I love the
kids, but it was just frustrat
ing."
Aside from the SWOPSI
course, many volunteers work
through the Human Biology
program which allows students
to use the volunteer work as
credit for the workshop re
quirement.
Other students are merely
volunteers. They range from
freshmen to graduate students
and from psychology majors to
history majors.
And most are not intending
to go into a field dealing with
disturbed children, but rather,
are just taking advantage of an
opportunity to learn what it is
like to work with a disturbed
child.
"It's a unique experience,"
said one volunteer, "some
thing I won't soon forget."

interest. Nevertheless, the
volunteer program is doing
well again this year.
And luckily so. PCC staff
members say the volunteers
are essential to the program.
"We could not survive with
out the help of the volun
teers," said Janina Nadaner,
PCC staff member and one of
the two SWOPSI instructors.
The children sometimes need
one-on-one attention, and it
could not be met without the
help of the volunteers, she
explained.
Six hours weekly
In the SWOPSI class, stu
dents are required to put in a
minimum of six hours each
week working with the chil
dren.
Each student is assigned to a
staff member and under that
person's supervision, works
with a small group of children
or adolescents.
The volunteers are encour
aged to discuss the day's ac
tivities with the staff member,
usually a child therapist, in an
effort to learn how to use a var
iety of treatment and special
education techniques.
Discussing the treatment
processes with the child
therapist is important, not only

to maximize the volunteer's
learning, but also to make the
volunteer a useful aide to the
child therapist and to the dis
turbed children, staff members
said.
The first step into a clas
sroom holding nine or 10 dis
turbed children and one staff
member is an uneasy experi
ence. Volunteers are often
confused as to how and when
to treat the children. "Should I
discipline them, or let them
be? How much disciplining is
necessary to enforce the rules?
Should I physically punish a
disturbed child?" Answers are
learned mostly through ex
perience and through the gui
dance of the child therapist.
Frustrating, uneasy
"There were some frustrat
ing and uneasy times," recalls
volunteer Lissy Clad. "For in
stance, at the very beginning,
getting to know the kids and
their individual problems was
hard. I had to get to know each
problem separately.
"A lot that made my experi
ence a good one, was my child
therapist," Glad continued.
"We would always stav after

school and he would explain
the children's problems so that
I could understand them, so
we wouldn't be clueless as to
what to do in the classroom."
In addition to the minimum
six hours of volunteer work at
PCC, the SWOPSI student is
required to attend a two-hour
lecture-discussion seminar
each week where assigned
readings are discussed along
with experiences at the center.
Practical skills of discipline and
forming expectations are also
covered.
"The seminars make it more
relevant to the student," said
Nadaner. "They try to pull to
gether the experiences the
volunteers encounter while
working directly with the chil
dren."
Students who have worked
at PCC usually describe it as a
rewarding experience.
'Great' experience
"It was great," Clad said, "I
want to go back to visit. Just
having the kids say 'hi' to me
the minute I walk in the door,
or having them say that they
want to work with me, or hav
ing them run up and hug me,

was really neat."
But this is not to say that
there were not difficult times,
as well.
"The part that bothered me
the most was that when I left, I
didn't see any change. The kids
hadn't improved in the five
months I was there," said vol
unteer Laurie Heist. "I love the
kids, but it was just frustrat
ing."
Aside from the SWOPSI
course, many volunteers work
through the Human Biology
program which allows students
to use the volunteer work as
credit for the workshop re
quirement.
Other students are merely
volunteers. They range from
freshmen to graduate students
and from psychology majors to
history majors.
And most are not intending
to go into a field dealing with
disturbed children, but rather,
are just taking advantage of an
opportunity to learn what it is
like to work with a disturbed
child.
"It's a unique experience,"
said one volunteer, "some
thing I won't soon forget."
Frustrating, exasperating,
encouraging, re
warding. Volunteers at the
Peninsula Children's Center
(PCC) use all these words to
describe working with a dis
turbed child.
PCC, at 3860 Middlefield
Road in Palo Alto, is a day
treatment center for disturbed
children. A private, non-profit
program, it serves children be
tween the ages of three and 18
who range from being moder
ately disturbed to severely dys
functional. Autistic, schizop
hrenic and behaviorally disor
dered are diagnostic labels car
ried by many of them.
PCC, together with the
SWOPSI program, have de
veloped a successful two
quarter course entitled "Work
ng Effectively with Disturbed
Children," which allows stu
dents here to work directly
with the center. Initially or
ganized six years ago, the
course had to be discontinued
last year due to lack of student
interest. Nevertheless, the
