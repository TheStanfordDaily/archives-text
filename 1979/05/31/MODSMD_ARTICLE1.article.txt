# Little gas improvement seen for June
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Optimism among
some government officials and in
dustry experts over June gasoline
supplies is being dampened by
further cutbacks by several major oil
companies in the formulas they use
to allocate gasoline to dealers
But in Washington, White House
press secretary Jody Powell repeated
yesterday the administration's opin
ion that May was the worst month for
oil supplies and that the situation in
June and July would be "somewhat
improved."
Companies figure their allocations
to dealers as a percentage of the
gasoline supplied last year. Some
have raised the percentage for June,
and a few others have left the figure
unchanged from May. But reduc
tions announced by Gulf, Conoco
and Texaco and hinted at by Shell

may mean little or no improvement
in gasoline supplies in June, analysts
say.
Demand higher in June
Gasoline demand is traditionally
higher in June than in May, as vaca
tions begin and warm weather en
courages driving.
There may be some hope, how
ever, for improvement in gas availa
bility on the West Coast, where the
gas crunch has hit hardest.
Standard Oil of California, which
does much of its business in the
Western part of the nation, has in
creased its allocations to dealers
from about 83 percent of year-ago
levels in May to 90 percent of year
ago levels in June.
And Gulf, although planning to cut
back in the East, is asking the Energy
Dept. for permission to raise its allo

cation west of the Rockies, where it
has about 3 percent of the total gas
market.
Elsewhere, Gulf will be giving
dealers 80 percent of what they got
last June, after giving them a 90 per
cent allocation in May; Texaco is cut
ting its June allocation to 70 percent
from 80 percent in May; and Conoco
will reduce its June allocation to 75
percent from 80 percent.
Although the firm has not yet made
an official announcemnt, executives
at Shell say the June allocation will
likely be 75 percent, compared to 80
percent in May.
The allocation figures are some
what deceptive, however. Texaco's
70 percent allocation, for example,
does not mean that the company will
have 30 percent less gasoline in June
than it did in June 1978. That just rep

resents what the firm is shipping to
dealers who do not qualify for special
breaks.
Under federal law, Texaco and
other companies must continue to
supply agricultural, public service
and other customers deemed essen
tial with the same amount of fuel they
received last year. In addition, they
are allowed to give more to dealers
that have been particularly hard hit,
and to adjust supplies for increases
in sales.
As a result, Texaco said its 70 per
cent June allocation will result in its
total gasoline sales being 99 percent
of what they were under 80 percent
allocation in May. And analysts esti
mate that 80 percent allocations to
dealers mean that total supplies will
be about 92 percent of last year's
levels.
