## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — The
California Court of Appeals, in
a major decision yesterday
ruled that school district resol
utions — in this case one to
close down a Palo Alto school
— are not subject to a referen
dum vote by the people.
The 3-0 opinion held that
school districts are administra
tive agencies of the state for
the local operation of the state
school system.
"It is firmly held that acts and
resolutions of administrative
agencies of the state are not
subject to referendum by local
electors," said the court, ad
ding that a superior court has
no jurisdiction on any action
seeking to put a resolution to a
vote.
Because of the drastic reduc
tion in funding brought about
mainly by the passage of last
year's Proposition 13 and re
quirement for a balanced

budget, the Board of Education
of the Palo Alto Unified School
District voted to close Cubber
ley High School.
A group of voters and"The
Take Time to Plan Committee"
processed a referendum peti
tion calling for rescision of the
closing or submitting the ques
tion to voters. When the board
declined to take action, the
matter went to court.
Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge Stanley Evans or
dered the board to file and
process the referendum peti
tion.
Then, the appeal court had
stayed further proceedings
pending its ruling.
In the Palo Alto situation, the
court said, the board was
under statutory compulsion to
operate schools under a re
duced and balanced budget,
adding that closing Cubberley
High would result in an annual
saving of $850,000.
