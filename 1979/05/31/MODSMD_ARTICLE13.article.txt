Power companies like Pacific Gas and Electric
and supporters of nuclear power bewail exces
sive public interference in operating nuclear
power plants and warn that without nuclear
power to supply our energy, the integrity of our
country and of our individual freedoms will be
threatened. But they ignore the fact that nuclear
power itself is contradictory to our individual
freedoms.
A functioning nuclear power plant is only one
link in a whole chain of processing that also
includes mining the uranium, purifying it and
then disposing of the potpourri of radioactive
substances generated by the nuclear reaction.
Each link in this chain requires security to

Nuclear power . . . requires
centralization and control by a
few people in business and
government.

prevent the potential misuse of some of these
dangerous substances by members of our soci
ety or by other societies without nuclear
weapons but with operating nuclear plants.
Such a nuclear economy must police each step,
guard the waste and maintain secrecy. An
economic and political infrastructure whose
prime concern is security is incompatible with
the freedom and openness necessary for demo
cracy.
Nuclear power, because of the risks and the
high technology involved, also requires cen
tralization and control by a few people in busi
ness and government. Such closed control of
energy by a few is also incompatible with demo
cratic participation. It reduces our control over
our own lives by making us more dependent on
this small number of energy brokers.
Moreover, nuclear power violates our basic
freedoms by exposing members of society to
radiation. Although total background radiation
from existing nuclear power plants, when aver
aged across society, is slight, significant propor
tions of our population have been, and continue
to be, exposed to substantial doses of radiation.
Uranium miners breathe the radon gas given
off during the mining process. Dr. Helen Cal
dicott, a leading critic of the nuclear industry,
has found that 20 to 50 percent of all uranium
miners have died of lung cancer.
The waste from uranium processing, called

tailings, also emits radon. People in Grand Junc
tion, Colorado, for example, used tailings to
build houses, hospitals and roads.unaware of
the risks. Now there is an increased incidence of
congenital deformities among babies born in
these houses.
Also, people around nuclear power plants,
besides being exposed to a higher level of
background radiation in general, have been ex
posed to a variety of radiation leaks from acci
dents at storage facilities and plants themselves.
Three Mile Island was only the most recent and
best publicized accident.
Radioactive strontium, calcium and
plutonium from such leaks remain in the envi
ronment for hundreds, even hundreds of
thousands of years. During this time they are
concentrated in the food chain and are dis
persed.
The cancers these alpha and beta emitters
cause is not traceable to the original source. The
danger is all the greater for its invisibility.
Claims that radiation from nuclear plants is
insignificant because it is small compared to
existing background radiation are fallacious.
Existing background radiation levels cause tens
of thousands of cancers every year. Any increase
in this level, from x-rays or nuclear power
plants, increases the number of cancers.
Are we willing to accept an ethic that involves
the equivalent of involuntary x-rays for mem
bers of our society now and for thousands of
years to come?
There is no free market for nuclear energy.
The government funds the uranium purification
process. When insurance companies were un
willing to cover the potential damages from nuc
lar plants, the federal government stepped in
with the Price-Anderson Act to relieve the com
panies of their responsibility fordamages result
ing from their actions.
But what are the alternatives to a nuclear
economy? Many renewable sources of energy
do not use up the earth's non-renewable capital
stocks of fossil fuels or uranium.
Several alternatives are already well-de
veloped, including solar, wind, geothermal,
biomass, tidal and simple conservation mea
sures. In addition, there are new ways of using
our remaining capital resources, such as
squeezing oil out of shale. All these sources
could potentially fill our energy needs if we
were willing to accept a higher, more realistic
price for our energy.
