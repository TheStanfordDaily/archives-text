## Solution eludes problem of terrorism 
### 
Although most people be
lieve that terrorism is a new
phenomenon, political assassi
nation is as old as western
civilization. Terroristic organi
zations date to the 13th cen
tury, with an Arab group called
the Ismaili, or the Assassins,
which survived over a century.
The Middle East saw another
major period of terror in the
1940 s when Zionist groups at
tacked the British colonial gov
ernment. Prime Minister
Menachem Begin led the
largest of the Israeli terrorist
groups, the Irgun.
But terrorism has never been
a Middle Eastern monopoly.
The Irish Republican Army has
been 112 ighti ng more or less con
tinuously since the 1800s. Latin
America has been plagued with
violence every since the Con
quistadors conquered the
Incas using terroristic
methods.
Despite the long tradition of
terrorism, though, its re

surgence in the last decades
have brought with it some dis
tinctly new features. Television
and other forms of instantane
ous media have given terrorists
an infinitely expanded power
to reach a wide spectator audi
ence.
Assassinations and kidnap
pings today are choreog
raphed for the media to
achieve the greatest possible
impact on an international au
dience. International terror
has become commonplace:
Japanese terrorists fly from
Tokyo to New York, Paris and
Rome to attack Israeli interests
for the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The PLO's oper
ations are funded, in part, by
Argentine kidnappings and
the government of Libya.
The terrorist arsenal now in
cludes surface-to-air missiles
and we must face the specter of
attacks of mass violence with
nuclear weapons, botulism
virus, anthrax spores, and so

on. It is estimated that while
tens to a few hundred casual
ties can be expected from fire
arms or small bombs and a
hundred thousand casualties
from a small atomic weapon,
an attack with anthrax could
claim several million lives.
Emergency procedures in the
event of a threat or an actual
attack have not been formu
lated.
There is still no clear agree
ment on the strategy a state can
or should follow to prevent a
terrorist operation or how to
negotiate with armed terrorists
with hostages. We hear so
often that all governments
have adopted the official U.S.
strategy of no negotiation.
Vet governments have acted
inconsistently, more often
than not disregarding the offi
cial strategy of no negotiation.
A recent CIA survey showed
that terrorists can expect "83
percent chance of success
where safe passage or exit, for
the terrorists themselves or for

others, was the sole demand;
and 29 percent chance of full
compliance with all demands."
Moreover, the American
strategy has not hindered ter
rorist operations. The same
survey showed that terrorists
can expect an 87 percent prob
ability ot taking hostages when
that is their object and a 79 per
cent chance that all members
of the team would escape alive.
Dealing with an emergency
is one thing, preventing it
another. |ust as no clear and
consistent strategy has been
devised to deal with terrorists
in a crisis situation, there is lit
tle agreement on how to pre
vent terrorists from making an
attack.
The tactic called target
hardening, making a potential
target difficult to attack, has
been shown to work in certain
cases. Relatively simple search
procedures in airports have all
but eliminated skyjacking in
the United States.
But other targets are not as
easy to harden. How is it possi
ble to control the movements
of all people along the whole
route an official must travel to
get from his or her home to
office. And can a government
protect not only high state offi
cials but minor functionaries
and wealthy civilians who may
be the targets of a terrorist as
sault?
To United States has
avoided the rash of terrorism
that has swept Europe; but no
thing prevents widespread
political violence from erupt
ing in this country. A law sanc
tioning government investiga
tions into personal activities
may be "necessary" toensure
public safety. Vet, is such an
abridgement of personal free
doms acceptable? A strategy to
prevent terrorist activities may
one day be necessary; yet it
will always be a delicate ba
lance between civil rights and
civil order.

Although most people be
lieve that terrorism is a new
phenomenon, political assassi
nation is as old as western
civilization. Terroristic organi
zations date to the 13th cen
tury, with an Arab group called
the Ismaili, or the Assassins,
which survived over a century.
The Middle East saw another
major period of terror in the
1940 s when Zionist groups at
tacked the British colonial gov
ernment. Prime Minister
Menachem Begin led the
largest of the Israeli terrorist
groups, the Irgun.
But terrorism has never been
a Middle Eastern monopoly.
