## Woe unto hissers 
### 
Sunday night, the Flicks fea
tured Romeo and Juliet, and
the reaction of some of the au
dience was intriguing. Friar
Laurence said to Romeo, who
is overcome with woe:
Art thou a man? thy form
cries thou art:
Thy tears are womanish . . .
whereupon several people his
sed. Can someone who
reacted sibilantly please write a
letter to the Daily to explain
their reasons? I can only come
up with these:
—You feel that Shakespeare
should have been aware that to
use the word "womanish" in
this way subtly oppresses wo
man, tying her to "weaker"
traits such as weeping and thus
infringing on her right to act
"masculinely."
—You would have liked to
see Friar Laurence let Romeo
cry, since men have as much
right as women to vent their
emotions. Men have for too
long been stifled under the ac
cusation of acting
"femininely."
—You condemn director
FrancoZefferelli forlackingthe

foresight to censor Shakes
peare on such a touchy issue.
—You were just trying to be
funny.
Do you think you express
yourself viably by hissing?
Don't you worry that by hissing
so crassly you tread dreadfully
near philistinism, not to men
tion boorishness? Or do you
think we shouldn't set up sac
red cows, not even
Shakespeare—that no one
should escape the wrath of
your righteous hiss?
