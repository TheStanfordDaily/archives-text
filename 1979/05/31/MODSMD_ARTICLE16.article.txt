# Physics labeled

Once again, cartoonist Gil
Morales has ruthlessly
exploited a campus
stereotype, this time at the ex
pense of the physics major. In
last Friday's Dupie (Daily, May
25), Morales callously pokes
fun at a short, sun-glassed nerd
type, who, judging from his
blank expression, is a physics
major.
The comic strip finds our
physics majorand Dupie at the
beach, jumping to catch an in

cident frisbee with angular
momentum omega. As both
are suspended ballet-like in
the air, our nerd experiences
what Morales mockingly de
scribes as a "physics hallucina
tion:" force diagrams sud
denly appear; angles, vel
ocities, and distances are im
mediately labelled, and the
correct equations of motion
magically present themselves.
Morales seems to be
suggesting that even at play,
the physics major is unable to
deal with reality in the normal
way, and occasionally lapses
into altered states of con
sciousness, subjecting every
thing to his cold, mathematical
interpretation of life. This sim
ply is not true.
The physics major always
sees everything in terms of
physics. After four years' im
mersion in time-consuming
problem sets and abstruse
theoretical textbooks he can
remember little else.
The physi.cs major under
stands that all reality reduces
ultimately to physics, and this
realization conditions and in
forms his world view. That this
perspective is the usual and
not, as Morales alleges, the oc
casional frame of mind, is
shown by the physics major's
usual, and not occasional,
complete inability to com
municate with other human
beings.
Morales' negative attitude
towards physics and physicists
is most blatantly portrayed in
the final two fr?mes. Here, the
physics major's frantic leap
falls pathetically short, and the
frisbee glides effortlessly into
Dupie's waiting arms.
Morales is suggesting, no
doubt, that physics is an insuf
ficient means of conducting
normal human activity. But if
our nerd had only labelled his
axes correctly, he would have
caught the frisbee with room to
spare.
