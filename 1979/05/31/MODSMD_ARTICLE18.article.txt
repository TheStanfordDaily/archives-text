I have never considered my
self to he a Communist. I don't
consider myself to he one now.
But something about the group
Prairie Fire, which played
White Plaza Tuesday, hit a re
sponsive chord in me.
What bothered me about the
whole scene that day was the
reaction, or lack of it, from the

onlookers. To be brief, the
band was musically very tight
and professional, especially
since they had only been play
ing together for one month.
The majority of passers-by
heard the songs, but did not
really listen. Though I would
grant that some of the state
ments made in the group's
songs were extreme, the issues
they addressed were nonethe
less very real.
The group impressed me as a
70s version of the '60s Jeffer
son Airplane. What Prairie Fire
was asking was nothing more
than the Airplane's "Look
what's happening out in the
streets." In this case, however,
the "streets" are Iran, the Sup
reme Court and the general
state of the nation.
But nobody here wanted to
really listen. "You shouldn't
mix politics and music," said
one student. Sorry, I can't buy
that. I don't necessarily advo
cate a return to the '60s, but
Prairie Fire exemplifies a cru
cial role in society — that of
spokesperson for social
change.
They care. Do we?
