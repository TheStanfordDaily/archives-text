# Write creatively
## 
### 
I am writing this letter as an
appeal, an appeal to the stu
dents, faculty and friends of
Stanford. The Daily is not the
only publication on campus.
There are many other news
papers, a few journals, and
several literary publications.
There are, however, no
magazines or pamphlets which
print students' literary work
exclusively.
Granted, the Sequoia puts
out a special edition for stu
dents, but that edition is seen
only once a year, if that often. I
submitted several poems to
the Sequoia early in winter
quarter, and have yet to re
ceive either rejection or accep
tance.
I feel it is important to have a
frequent, consistent publica
tion devoted exclusively to
students. Thereare many aspir
ing writers here. This univer
sity has one of the finest
English/creative writing de
partments in, probably, the
world.
The University experience
should not be one of discour
agement. When a graduate or
undergraduate leaves Stan
ford, he should be prepared

for a professional career not
only in mind, but in spirit.
Some say that lack of accep
tance builds character, teaches
one to "stand on his own two
feet." But does a child that is
ignored by his parents grow
strong, or does he become in
troverted, inactive, and bitter
with depression? It depends
on the individual; if, however,
one potential Steinbeck is
thwarted, the University has
defeated its own purpose.
It is as much the students'
responsibility to demand a
change as it is the faculty's and
the administration's responsi
bility to be sensitive to our
needs. I applied for funds for a
student publication, cutting
corners everywhere I could to
bring down the cost. SCIRE re
fused to assist the publication
because, among other
reasons, I was asking for too
little money.

They also felt a relatively
small staff (the minimum
number of students required
to begin a voluntary organiza
tion is five) would not be able
to do a professional job. This
seems rather ironic since
SCIRE consists of only three or
four part-time workers.
In any event, they suggested
we consult other sources for
financial support, and increase
the staff size. That is what I am
doing.
We need your financial, bod
ily and poetic support. The
publication needs workers,
editors, and, of course, sub
mitters. The specific nature of
the work we solicit will be de
termined by the staff, but it will
all have one thing in common:
it will be the result of student
creativity here.
