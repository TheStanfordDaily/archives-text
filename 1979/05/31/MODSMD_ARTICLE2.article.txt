# Reverses earlier decision
## University lifts ban on custodian vacations 
### Mark Nassutti 
In an unexpected reversal, the
University last Friday granted six cus
todial employees their scheduled
summer vacations, overturning a de
cision made by the Residence Man
ager's office April 4.
The reversal came after the af
fected workers staged a demonstra
tion, confronted administration offi
cials and filed a grievance with the
University.
The six employees had been con
cerned that their vacation plans
would be disrupted. At the time of
the original decision denying their
vacations, the prospects for settling
the matter before summer appeared
bleak.
Varrie Booker Jr., one of the six
workers, had been planning to take
his vacation during the month of
July. He hoped to take his family back
to his home in Texas.
No vacations
Everything was set until April 4
when Rob Ramirez, manager of Resi
dence and Fraternities Maintenance,

and his assistant, Ollie Slayton, an
nounced in a letter mailed to Slayton
on that day that "no vacations or
non-medical leave of absenses"
would be granted for the June 18 to
August 31 period, when the Summer
Conference Program is held.
Slayton defended his office's ac
tion, saying that the persons whose
vacations were denied were "experi
enced people in key places."
Booker and the other employees
were stunned by the decision. Ac
cording to Sue Frey, field representa
tive of United Stanford Employees
(USE), the union representing the
workers, the University never before
had placed such a restriction on
employees' vacations.
Confrontation appeared inevita
ble. The workers involved met with
Slayton, Frey said, and filed a grie
vance.
But according to Frey, the workers
were skeptical; they felt that by the
time the complaint got through the
grievance procedure, it would be
summer and too late to make a dif

ference.
Confrontation
On May 15 the workers took mat
ters intotheirown hands. Along with
union officials and community sup
porters they stormed into the Resi
dence Manager's office located
under Crothers Memorial Hall and
confronted Ramirez and Slayton.
It was this move, Frey said, that
prompted the reversal of the deci
sion. "I think once we made it known
to the community, management
started to realize how unfair it was.
We're really pleased that Stanford
was responsive."
The University agreed to grant all
six workers the vacations they had
requested.
But mum was the word from within
the Housing Management office as
to why the original decision was re
versed. When asked about the rever
sal, Ed Scoles, director of Housing
Management, said, "I think we're
getting into some areas that I don't
want to discuss in the newspaper."
Ramirez, also asked about the re

versal, said that his office "did take
things (originally) on a per-case
basis. We reached what we thought
was a fair decision."
He added, however, that after
further consideration his office
found that they "could accommo
date those extra people. I wouldn't
say we were in error, but we found
we could be a little more flexible than
we had thought previously."
According to Frey, Tom Matteoli,
Employee Relations Representative
in the Personnel Dept., worked out
the final settlement with Scoles.
