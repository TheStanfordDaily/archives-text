## Athletes unduly spoiled 
### 
When I was 17, I was frequently asked
whether I would take advantage of a tennis scho
larship if it were offered to me. I took the ques
tion to mean this: would I use this scholarship to
pay for my education?
I knew that a scholarship meant a pheno
menal commitment: long hours of practice, sac
rifices and constant performance. It never oc
curred to me to "take advantage of a scholar
ship" by skipping practices, coming and going
as I pleased, using foul language on the court,
turning pro in the middle of season, in short,
being a prima donna. If the University would pay
for my education, I felt I would owe the coach,
the athletic department, and the University
more than I was willing to give. So, I always
answered no.
Since coming here and playing on the varsity
tennis team, I have learned that other athletes
simply do not share my ideals. I am disgusted by
the attitude taken by many tennis players on
scholarship, and by athletes in general. Many
disclosed to me that they would "screw" the
University at the first opportunity — a fine com
petitive attitude. Many have turned pro right
before or during the tennis season to take re
venge. That is close to $30,000 of ingratitude.
I have been involved with tennis at the local,
regional and national level and have witnessed
the same abominable behavior everywhere.
Perhaps the Victorian epigram should hold true
for the athlete: "Athletes should be seen and
not heard."
I've seen and heard it all, from cheating to
temper tantrums. I thought that once people left
juniorcompetition they would leave their imma
ture antics behind. But their behavior continues
into college and professional sports.
The crucial question is this: How did such
athletes become so obnoxious, so ungrateful.

and so disrespectful? Ranting and raving are in
excusable. I wonder whether the coaches, sup
posed "father figures" and "model human be
ings" instill this behavior or simply overlook it.
Even the athletic department seems to hold
Vince Lombardi's credo above everything else:
"Winning isn't everything, it is the only thing."
There seems to be no guidance or develop
ment of athletes into individuals with noble and
honest ideals.
I worked in the athletic department one fall
quarter and was appalled by the special treat
ment many athletes were given. They were en
couraged to take the easiest academic route.
Interviews were arranged continually, and
athletic personnel turned on the charm the mi
nute one of their "darlings" walked into the
office. Why? Because one guy can throw a foot
ball farther than the next?
A good athlete has been endowed with a spe
cial talent, but so have concert pianists and
Nobel Prize winners. The latter two are well
behaved.
What an athlete has to learn is this: their per
formance doesn't count for much in this world.
Sports are merely games; they are not all there is
to life. The discipline learned through training
should be used to deal with issues of living.
Athletes often take sports too seriously, becom
ing rude and vile human beings.
Perhaps this behavior is inevitable in a society
that places too much importance on sports.
From the day athletes start working out, they are
led to believe that their performance is all that
counts. Parents pamper, coaches coddle, and
universities give big, fat scholarships. All this
leads to uncontrollable egos.
Granted, not all athletes are as I have de
scribed. But it seems to me that more and more
are becoming so.
