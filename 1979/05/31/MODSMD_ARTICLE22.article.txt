-from Good as Gold
Much of Joseph Heller's suc
cess as a writer is a function of
his familiarity with a state of
mind known to all of us, a state
of mind whose contemporary
dominance may be one of the
distinguishing characteristics
of our age. The conviction that
the world is run by persons
who do not knowwhat theyare
doing, or by persons either in
capable or too capable of ad
mitting that they know exactly
what they are doing, is cer
tainly old enough, but in Hel
ler's hands this idea is given re
sounding immediacy and im
portance. The lockjaw grin of

the bureaucracy; the lone sane
howl of a victim; the ways by
which a victim can make the
life of the enemy miserable —
these are the means by which
Heller arms us against an in
sane age. A rational, good, in
telligent person can do strang
er and more disruptive things
than the biggest asshole on
earth — that'sthe vision of Hel
ler's best work (Catch-22), and
the most lasting of its tenets.
And now Joseph Heller has
written Good as Cold, in which
he attempts to update his dis
tinctively circular genius. The
narrative beast that had inha
bited his first book had been
somehow absent from his sec
ond effort, Something Hap
pened (hard to remember; not
nearly as good; a long, slow,
expertly articulated middle
class whine). But it is very
much present in Good as Gold,
in a way unavoidably reminis
cent of its presence in Catch
-22. In Good as Gold, however,
the beast squats (purportedly)
over Washington, D.C. rather
than a miniscule island in the
Mediterranean, over Henry
Kissinger and Lyndon Johnson
rather than Milo Minderbinder
and General Dreedle, over a
partially sympathetic aging wri
ter rather than a treasonously
clear-headed bombardier,
over what Heller calls "the
Jewish experience" rather than

that of a strangely familiar
group of fighter pilots.
"What was that?"
"I don't know."
"Could you say it again?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know?"
"I really don't know."
Joseph Heller's greatest
literary strength, aside from
the seriousness of his position,
his sense of humor and his
command of the language, is
his distinctively rabid narrative
voice. At his best Joseph Heller
is perpetually uprooting a
reader, playing practical jokes
on him, exposing him to con
siderable abuse and convinc
ing him that he likes it. He
changes tone frequently, and
with no warning. He sets overly
inflated, almost burlesque
characters against serious,
realistic humans, leaving us
often with the impression that
the latter are not in the novel
by choice. Heller frequently
takes a distanced, impartial
perspective on one page and
abandons it on the next; he
writes comedy and then turns
on the reader for laughing at
what was funny. He takes us
into his confidence, assures us
that he understands, and when
we're not looking he sneaks
around behind and kicks us
down a flight of stairs.
Holy cow? Would you mind
repeating that one for the

mike?. . .
"Certainly. I don't know."
This is false. At his best
Joseph Hller's voice is per
petually uprooting a reader,
while Heller himself takes re
fuge at other points in his writ
ing. In Catch-22 he had
chained himself to the figure of
Yossarian, and chained Yossa
rian to a war, and then gradu
ally distanced himself and his
hero from a strange narrative
voice. We were in such a way
planted in an unbelievable
world, in an unbelievable
book, like a twentieth-century
Alice drafted and sent to war.
Yossarian and Heller acted ra
tionally and sanely, or irration
ally and insanely for rational
and sane reasons, and they ac
cordingly attracted our sym
pathies because nobody else in
the book is bound by any kind
of logic. (This is particularly
true of the narrator. Among the
major conflicts in Catch-22 is
Yossarian's struggle with a nar
rator who forgets what he is
talking about, or seems to,
who wanders away from im
pending truths with excruciat
ing nonchalance, who tells a
story once and then again with
entirely different facts.)
"That's something that's al
ways puzzled me, Ron If
Richard Nixon was second
rate, what in the world is third
rate?"

"Henry Kissinger."
"You rate Henry Kissinger
below Richard Nixon?"
"Only in intelligence and
wit. In character and credibility
they're about the same."
Good as Gold is not nearly as
good as Catch-22. There are
many problems with it. In
Good as Cold Joseph Heller
turns on the reader with more
frequency and vehemence
than ever before, going so far
as to threaten to tell us from
time to time that we are wast
ing our energies on this book,
that it was written in a great
hurry, that it shouldn't have
been published now because it
isn't ready. And sometimes it is
tempting to take him at his
word, and throw the book
away, particularly after pas
sages in which Heller admits
defeat.
Once again, as Gold found
himself preparing to lunch with
someone - Spotty Weinrock -
the thought arose that he was
spending an awful lot of time in
this book eating and talking.
There was not much else to be
done with him. I was putting
him into bed a lot with Andrea
and keeping his wife in the
background. For Aculpulco, I
contemplated a hectic mixup
which would include a sensual
Mexican television actress and
a daring attempt to escape in
the nude through a second

story bedroom window, while
a jealous lover crazed on
American drugs was beating on
the door with his fists. Cer
tainly he would soon meet a
school teacher with whom he
would fall madly in love, and I
would shortly hold out to him
the tantalizing prospect of
being the country's first jewish
secretary of state, a promise
that I did not intend to keep.
Gold does spend an awful lot
of time in this book eating and
talking. When he is not eating
and talking he is cheating on
his wife, hoping for a govern
ment appointment, hating
himself and everyone he
knows. He is not a sympathetic
character. His views are
aligned with theviewsof Heller
in much the same way that Yos
sarian's were, but in this case
the author and his hero have
made themselves unsympathe
tic. No doubt this was inten
tional, but it still is problema
tic, since it leaves a reader
without a means by which he
can unravel this book. A lot of it
is boring, as a result, since a lot
of it has no point. Heller says as
much here and there but that
really doesn't help, in much
the same way that admitting
one's sin's doesn't justify
further sinning.
"Bite your tongue."
"Where else would you
rather be?"
"Bite it all the way off."

Vet the hardest thing about
disliking this book is coming
up with examples. Whatever
else he is Joseph Heller is one
of the truly distinctive voices in
20th century fiction — his fai
lures are thus as interesting as
anything on the market. That's
whatGoodas Gold is, I think. It
isn't really about the Jewish
experience, and never really
gets to Washington, and the
dominant image is of Heller at
the typewriter with nothing
more to say — yet for some
reason, in retrospect, it was a
lot of fun to read. It is signific
ant that Good as Gold ends at
precisely the point where it
began — with Cold preparing
to write the book that he has
long been promising. In effect
what we have here is a 400 page
digression from Cold's effort
— and Joseph Heller writes the
finest digressions in print.
Read it, if you've nothing bet
ter else to do.

Good as Gold is not nearly as
good as Catch-22. There are
many problems with it. In
Good as Cold Joseph Heller
turns on the reader with more
frequency and vehemence
than ever before, going so far
as to threaten to tell us from
time to time that we are wast
ing our energies on this book,
that it was written in a great
hurry, that it shouldn't have
been published now because it
isn't ready. And sometimes it is
tempting to take him at his
word, and throw the book
away, particularly after pas
sages in which Heller admits
defeat.
Once again, as Gold found
himself preparing to lunch with
someone - Spotty Weinrock -
the thought arose that he was
spending an awful lot of time in
this book eating and talking.
There was not much else to be
done with him. I was putting
him into bed a lot with Andrea
and keeping his wife in the
background. For Aculpulco, I
contemplated a hectic mixup
which would include a sensual
Mexican television actress and
a daring attempt to escape in
the nude through a second

story bedroom window, while
a jealous lover crazed on
American drugs was beating on
the door with his fists. Cer
tainly he would soon meet a
school teacher with whom he
would fall madly in love, and I
would shortly hold out to him
the tantalizing prospect of
being the country's first jewish
secretary of state, a promise
that I did not intend to keep.
Gold does spend an awful lot
of time in this book eating and
talking. When he is not eating
and talking he is cheating on
his wife, hoping for a govern
ment appointment, hating
himself and everyone he
knows. He is not a sympathetic
character. His views are
aligned with theviewsof Heller
in much the same way that Yos
sarian's were, but in this case
the author and his hero have
made themselves unsympathe
tic. No doubt this was inten
tional, but it still is problema
tic, since it leaves a reader
without a means by which he
can unravel this book. A lot of it
is boring, as a result, since a lot
of it has no point. Heller says as
much here and there but that
really doesn't help, in much
the same way that admitting
one's sin's doesn't justify
further sinning.

-from Good as Gold
Much of Joseph Heller's suc
cess as a writer is a function of
his familiarity with a state of
mind known to all of us, a state
of mind whose contemporary
dominance may be one of the
distinguishing characteristics
of our age. The conviction that
the world is run by persons
who do not knowwhat theyare
doing, or by persons either in
capable or too capable of ad
mitting that they know exactly
what they are doing, is cer
tainly old enough, but in Hel
ler's hands this idea is given re
sounding immediacy and im
portance. The lockjaw grin of

the bureaucracy; the lone sane
howl of a victim; the ways by
which a victim can make the
life of the enemy miserable —
these are the means by which
Heller arms us against an in
sane age. A rational, good, in
telligent person can do strang
er and more disruptive things
than the biggest asshole on
earth — that'sthe vision of Hel
ler's best work (Catch-22), and
the most lasting of its tenets.
And now Joseph Heller has
written Good as Cold, in which
he attempts to update his dis
tinctively circular genius. The
narrative beast that had inha
bited his first book had been
somehow absent from his sec
ond effort, Something Hap
pened (hard to remember; not
nearly as good; a long, slow,
expertly articulated middle
class whine). But it is very
much present in Good as Gold,
in a way unavoidably reminis
cent of its presence in Catch
-22. In Good as Gold, however,
the beast squats (purportedly)
over Washington, D.C. rather
than a miniscule island in the
Mediterranean, over Henry
Kissinger and Lyndon Johnson
rather than Milo Minderbinder
and General Dreedle, over a
partially sympathetic aging wri
ter rather than a treasonously
clear-headed bombardier,
over what Heller calls "the
Jewish experience" rather than

that of a strangely familiar
group of fighter pilots.
"What was that?"
"I don't know."
"Could you say it again?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know?"
"I really don't know."
Joseph Heller's greatest
literary strength, aside from
the seriousness of his position,
his sense of humor and his
command of the language, is
his distinctively rabid narrative
voice. At his best Joseph Heller
is perpetually uprooting a
reader, playing practical jokes
on him, exposing him to con
siderable abuse and convinc
ing him that he likes it. He
changes tone frequently, and
with no warning. He sets overly
inflated, almost burlesque
characters against serious,
realistic humans, leaving us
often with the impression that
the latter are not in the novel
by choice. Heller frequently
takes a distanced, impartial
perspective on one page and
abandons it on the next; he
writes comedy and then turns
on the reader for laughing at
what was funny. He takes us
into his confidence, assures us
that he understands, and when
we're not looking he sneaks
around behind and kicks us
down a flight of stairs.
Holy cow? Would you mind
repeating that one for the

mike?. . .
"Certainly. I don't know."
This is false. At his best
Joseph Hller's voice is per
petually uprooting a reader,
while Heller himself takes re
fuge at other points in his writ
ing. In Catch-22 he had
chained himself to the figure of
Yossarian, and chained Yossa
rian to a war, and then gradu
ally distanced himself and his
hero from a strange narrative
voice. We were in such a way
planted in an unbelievable
world, in an unbelievable
book, like a twentieth-century
Alice drafted and sent to war.
Yossarian and Heller acted ra
tionally and sanely, or irration
ally and insanely for rational
and sane reasons, and they ac
cordingly attracted our sym
pathies because nobody else in
the book is bound by any kind
of logic. (This is particularly
true of the narrator. Among the
major conflicts in Catch-22 is
Yossarian's struggle with a nar
rator who forgets what he is
talking about, or seems to,
who wanders away from im
pending truths with excruciat
ing nonchalance, who tells a
story once and then again with
entirely different facts.)
"That's something that's al

sane age. A rational, good, in
telligent person can do strang
er and more disruptive things
than the biggest asshole on
earth — that'sthe vision of Hel
ler's best work (Catch-22), and
the most lasting of its tenets.
And now Joseph Heller has
written Good as Cold, in which
he attempts to update his dis
tinctively circular genius. The
narrative beast that had inha
bited his first book had been
somehow absent from his sec
ond effort, Something Hap
pened (hard to remember; not
nearly as good; a long, slow,
expertly articulated middle
class whine). But it is very
much present in Good as Gold,
in a way unavoidably reminis
cent of its presence in Catch
-22. In Good as Gold, however,
the beast squats (purportedly)
over Washington, D.C. rather
than a miniscule island in the
Mediterranean, over Henry
Kissinger and Lyndon Johnson
rather than Milo Minderbinder
and General Dreedle, over a
partially sympathetic aging wri
ter rather than a treasonously
clear-headed bombardier,
over what Heller calls "the
Jewish experience" rather than

that of a strangely familiar
group of fighter pilots.
"What was that?"
"I don't know."
"Could you say it again?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know?"
"I really don't know."
Joseph Heller's greatest
literary strength, aside from
the seriousness of his position,
his sense of humor and his
command of the language, is
his distinctively rabid narrative
voice. At his best Joseph Heller
is perpetually uprooting a
reader, playing practical jokes
on him, exposing him to con
siderable abuse and convinc
ing him that he likes it. He
changes tone frequently, and
with no warning. He sets overly
inflated, almost burlesque
characters against serious,
realistic humans, leaving us
often with the impression that
the latter are not in the novel
by choice. Heller frequently
takes a distanced, impartial
perspective on one page and
abandons it on the next; he
writes comedy and then turns
on the reader for laughing at
what was funny. He takes us
into his confidence, assures us
that he understands, and when
we're not looking he sneaks
around behind and kicks us
down a flight of stairs.
Holy cow? Would you mind
repeating that one for the

mike?. . .
"Certainly. I don't know."
This is false. At his best
Joseph Hller's voice is per
petually uprooting a reader,
while Heller himself takes re
fuge at other points in his writ
ing. In Catch-22 he had
chained himself to the figure of
Yossarian, and chained Yossa
rian to a war, and then gradu
ally distanced himself and his
hero from a strange narrative
voice. We were in such a way
planted in an unbelievable
world, in an unbelievable
book, like a twentieth-century
Alice drafted and sent to war.
Yossarian and Heller acted ra
tionally and sanely, or irration
ally and insanely for rational
and sane reasons, and they ac
cordingly attracted our sym
pathies because nobody else in
the book is bound by any kind
of logic. (This is particularly
true of the narrator. Among the
major conflicts in Catch-22 is
Yossarian's struggle with a nar
rator who forgets what he is
talking about, or seems to,
who wanders away from im
pending truths with excruciat
ing nonchalance, who tells a
story once and then again with
entirely different facts.)
"That's something that's al
ways puzzled me, Ron If
Richard Nixon was second
rate, what in the world is third
rate?"

"Henry Kissinger."
"You rate Henry Kissinger
below Richard Nixon?"
"Only in intelligence and
wit. In character and credibility
they're about the same."
Good as Gold is not nearly as
good as Catch-22. There are
many problems with it. In
Good as Cold Joseph Heller
turns on the reader with more
frequency and vehemence
than ever before, going so far
as to threaten to tell us from
time to time that we are wast
ing our energies on this book,
that it was written in a great
hurry, that it shouldn't have
been published now because it
isn't ready. And sometimes it is
tempting to take him at his
word, and throw the book
away, particularly after pas
sages in which Heller admits
defeat.
Once again, as Gold found
himself preparing to lunch with
someone - Spotty Weinrock -
the thought arose that he was
spending an awful lot of time in
this book eating and talking.
There was not much else to be
done with him. I was putting
him into bed a lot with Andrea
and keeping his wife in the
background. For Aculpulco, I
contemplated a hectic mixup
which would include a sensual
Mexican television actress and
a daring attempt to escape in
the nude through a second

story bedroom window, while
a jealous lover crazed on
American drugs was beating on
the door with his fists. Cer
tainly he would soon meet a
school teacher with whom he
would fall madly in love, and I
would shortly hold out to him
the tantalizing prospect of
being the country's first jewish
secretary of state, a promise
that I did not intend to keep.
Gold does spend an awful lot
of time in this book eating and
talking. When he is not eating
and talking he is cheating on
his wife, hoping for a govern
ment appointment, hating
himself and everyone he
knows. He is not a sympathetic
character. His views are
aligned with theviewsof Heller
in much the same way that Yos
sarian's were, but in this case
the author and his hero have
made themselves unsympathe
tic. No doubt this was inten
tional, but it still is problema
tic, since it leaves a reader
without a means by which he
can unravel this book. A lot of it
is boring, as a result, since a lot
of it has no point. Heller says as
much here and there but that
really doesn't help, in much
the same way that admitting
one's sin's doesn't justify
further sinning.
"Bite your tongue."
"Where else would you
rather be?"
"Bite it all the way off."

Vet the hardest thing about
disliking this book is coming
up with examples. Whatever
else he is Joseph Heller is one
of the truly distinctive voices in
20th century fiction — his fai
lures are thus as interesting as
anything on the market. That's
whatGoodas Gold is, I think. It
isn't really about the Jewish
experience, and never really
gets to Washington, and the
dominant image is of Heller at
the typewriter with nothing
more to say — yet for some
reason, in retrospect, it was a
lot of fun to read. It is signific
ant that Good as Gold ends at
precisely the point where it
began — with Cold preparing
to write the book that he has
long been promising. In effect
what we have here is a 400 page
digression from Cold's effort
— and Joseph Heller writes the
finest digressions in print.
Read it, if you've nothing bet

-from Good as Gold
Much of Joseph Heller's suc
cess as a writer is a function of
his familiarity with a state of
mind known to all of us, a state
of mind whose contemporary
dominance may be one of the
distinguishing characteristics
of our age. The conviction that
the world is run by persons
who do not knowwhat theyare
doing, or by persons either in
capable or too capable of ad
mitting that they know exactly
what they are doing, is cer
tainly old enough, but in Hel
ler's hands this idea is given re
sounding immediacy and im
portance. The lockjaw grin of

the bureaucracy; the lone sane
howl of a victim; the ways by
which a victim can make the
life of the enemy miserable —
these are the means by which
Heller arms us against an in
sane age. A rational, good, in
telligent person can do strang
er and more disruptive things
than the biggest asshole on
earth — that'sthe vision of Hel
ler's best work (Catch-22), and
the most lasting of its tenets.
