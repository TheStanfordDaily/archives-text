# FAA continues DC-10 inspections
## 
### Associated Press 
Dozens of DC-10 jumbo jets lifted
off again yesterday just hours after
the wide-bodied jets were grounded
for safety checks, but federal officials
said other DC-10s had failed to pass
inspection.
Most airports reported only minor
schedule disruptions yesterday and
officials at the eight U.S. airlines
which fly the jetliners predicted that
service would be back on schedule
within hours.
Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA), said yesterday that some
DC-10s had failed safety inspections
and still were grounded, but he
didn't know how many.
He said about half of the 134
DC-10s owned by U.S. airlines had
passed inspection and were either
cleared for flight or already have re
turned to the air.
The planes were grounded by the
FAA after an American Airlines DC-10
jet crashed on takeoff Friday from
Chicago's O'Hare International Air
port, killing 274 persons.
Foreign airlines
The FAA order removed from ser
vice 12 percent of the available seats
on domestic airlines. It was not bind
ing on foreign airlines, but many
nevertheless grounded their DC-10s

for inspection on Tuesday. Yester
day, most reported that their service,
too, was returning to normal.
The FAA order came after United
Airlines mechanics found a crack in
what United spokesman Dave
Ostwald called "a pylon spar web, a
horizontal reinforcing place," on
one of its DC-10s.
United spokesman Chuck Novak
said yesterday that mechanics had
not reported deficiencies on other
DC-10s. He could not predict when
United's 37 DC-10s would all be re
turned to service.
United assigned DC-8s and 727 jets
to most of its 61 DC-10 flights
scheduled for yesterday, Novak said,
but 16 flights were canceled.
Airport officials around the coun
try reported few problems yesterday.
In New York, Chicago, Baltimore,
Washington, Kansas City, Dallas-Fort
Worth and Denver, officials said op
erations were nearly normal.
Stranded passengers
But at many of those airports
thousands of passengers were
stranded Tuesday when their flights
were either canceled or delayed. At
Chicago's O'Hare, 3200 passengers
were temporarily stranded when 16
DC-10 flights were canceled, accord
ing to American Airlines spokesman
Joseph Scott.

"We just couldn't move in enough
planes to replace all the DC-10s," he
said. "Logistically, it was impossi
ble."
At London's Gatwick Airport,
about 1000 people were held up
when Britain's Civil Aviation Author
ity grounded the nine American-built
DC-10s flown by British carriers. All
nine jets had been cleared for flight
yesterday.
Ground crews for Freddie Laker's
Skytrain worked through the night
on Laker's six DC-10s, which re
turned to service yesterday between
London, New York and Los Angeles.
Sleepless night
Laker spent a sleepless night over
seeing the mechanics' work. Red
eyed, with ;.leeves still rolled up, he
told repciters, "I can't put my hand
on my heart after 40 years in the bus
iness to say it's totally foolproof. It
isn't. The average passenger is enti
tled to be nervous. Our job is to reas
sure them to the limit of our ability.
This we have done."
Other foreign airlines grounding
their DC-10s for safety inspections
included Scandinavian, Lufthansa,
Alitalia, Icelandic, Singapore Air
lines, Japan Airlines, Philippine Air
lines, Iberia, Nigerian Airways and
Air New Zealand.
World Airways had its six DC-10s
flying again yesterday morning. At
Trans International Airlines,
spokesman Rich Slakoss said all
three DC-10s had been inspected
and were flying on schedule.
A Continental Airlines official said
yesterday that "minor discrepan
cies" were found in five of its 15 DC
10s.
"There is no serious problem.
There is nothing major. These are
just small things we found that we
want to fix ourselves," said Conti
nental Vice President Joe Daley.
At Continental, Daley said 10 of the
carrier's 15 DC-10s would return to
the air yesterday; three others were
expected to be back in service late
today. Two DC-10s were scheduled
to return to the air on June 30, he
said.

National spokesman Walt Rob
shaw said inspection of all National's
16 DC-10s was completed in time to
resume normal service yesterday af
ternoon.
American spokesman Dave Frailey
said seven of the airline's 30 DC-10s
were scheduled to return to service
yesterday.
Eight of the 22 Northwest Orient
jumbo jets had been inspected at
mid-day yesterday and the rest were
to be done so that scheduled service
could resume by midnight, said
spokesman Brent Baskfield.
He said the airline ferried two 747
jumbo jets between Minneapolis-St.
Paul and Seattle early yesterday to
retrieve passengers stranded by the
DC-10 groundings and put eight
extra 727 jets into service to replace
the DC-10s.
