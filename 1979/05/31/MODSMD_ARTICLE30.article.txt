Clashes continue in Lebanon
Rockets and artillery shells slammed across the
Israeli-Lebanese border from both sides yesterday
and Lebanon called on the United Nations to in
tervene. Lebanese state radio reported five civi
lians killed north of the border but no casualties
were reported in Israel.
Palestinians claimed it was the ninth straight day
of Israeli attacks, but Israel said it was the first time
in aweek its artillery was involved in the hostilities,
implying that Lebanese Christians were doing
what fighting there was.
The Israeli military command said yesterday's
fight was brief. It said several Katyusha rockets had
been fired at northern Israel from Lebanese territ
ory, prompting "a few minutes" of return Israeli
fire at Palestinian targets about 9:30 a.m.
The Israelis have steadfastly denied Palestinian
and Lebanese claims that their forces have been
shelling Palestinian bases regularly for more than a
week.
Lebanese provincial authorities, and Palestinian
guerrilla spokesmen, described "unrelenting" ar
tillery bombardment from daybreak to noon, with
Israeli planes flying overhead and boats cruising
off shore. Besides the five dead, three other per
sons were wounded, Lebanese radio said.
At the United Nations in New York, Lebanon
asked for an urgent meeting of the Security Coun
cil to discuss the "rapidly deteriorating situation
in southern Lebanon."
Iran repulses Arab uprising
Khoramshahr, Iran — Weeks of discontent
among Iran's autonomy-minded Arab minority
exploded yesterday into a bloody showdown bet
ween armed Arabs and government troops in this
city at the heart of oil-rich Khuzestan province.
State radio reported 21 persons killed, and Mos
sadegh Hospital said at least 102 lay injured after a
day of arson and shooting in this city of 100,000.
State radio reported other clashes and at least
three deaths in the neighboring city of Abadan,
site of the world's largest oil refinery.
The army repulsed an attempt by the rebellious
Arabs to take over Khoramshahr, state radio said,
but shooting continued after sunset and gunmen
swarmed through the narrow streets. Revolutio
nary guardsmen assisting the army troops manned
sandbag barricades on almost every corner.
Iran's Arabs are an ethnic minority in a Moslem
but non-Arab nation. In Khuzestan, where they

numberabout2 million, they claim to bea majority
and are pressing for a greater share of the oil
profits, appointment of more Arab officials, grea
ter use of Arabic language and an end to what they
say is discrimination in employment.
Pope's youthful romance told
Vatican City — Three days before his historic
papal trip to Poland, Italy's leading newsmagazine
reported yesterday that Karol Wojtyla, the future
Pope John Paul 11, had a youthful romance with a
girl who is now a leading Polish actress.
The Vatican had no immediate comment, but it
has denied previous reports that the pope was
engaged or even married during World War 11,
before being ordained.
Panorama devoted its cover story to "Karol and
Halina," identifying the girl as Halina Krolikiewicz
Kwiatkowska, now the 57-year-old star of the Starv
Theater in Krakow. The magazine said she is sepa
rated from Polish scriptwriter Tadeusz Kwiat
kowska.
Karol and Halina's "tender story," "love story"
began when he was 14, and they saw each other
occasionally until her eventual marriage in 1945, it
said. A year later, Wojtyla was ordained a priest.
The war temporarily disrupted the romance,
Panorama said, but both were active in the Polish
underground and occasionally were together.
The authors, Italian journalists Stefano de An
dreis and Marcella Leone, said the article was
based on interviews in Poland.
Dymally suit claims illegal raid
Los Angeles — Former Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally
filed a $10 million suit yesterday in Superior Court
against state Attorney General George Deukme
jian and others, claiming alleged violations of civil
rights in connection with the search of offices be
longing to Dymally's attorney.
"I have rights and my rights were violated," said
Dymally. "The damage that the attorney general
has done cannot be easily repaired — a potential
loss of income, embarrassment in public and a
total fraud upon myself and the public at large."
Attorney Edward Masry said the suit, which
seeks $10 million in punitive damages and an un
specified amount in general damages, is based on
the allegedly illegal search and seizure of Dymal
ly's personal and confidential files from the
lawyer's office.
Masry's offices were raided April 5 by inves

tigators for the attorney general who said they
were looking for evidence of possible criminal acts
— including unreported political contributions.
Deukmejian's office reportedly suspected
members of the Morningland Church in Long
Beach of paying Dymally $10,000 in return for his
influence in stopping church investigations. Both
Morningland and Dymally were Masry's clients.
But Masry alleges the office was raided because
his firm had begun an investigation of Mike Curb
during last fall's campaign to unseat Dymally for
lieutenant governor.
State income tax cut unlikely
Sacramento — There is probably no chance that
the state will give taxpayers another $1 billion in
come tax cut this year, Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy said yesterday.
The state cut income taxes $1 billion last year as
an election-year, tax-cutting fever hit the Capitol
in the wake of Proposition 13.
Both McCarthy and Gov. Jerry Brown proposed
another $1 billion tax cut early this year. But
McCarthy told reporters yesterday the money fora
tax cut would undoubtedly be needed for such
things as school funding and retroactive cost-of
living increases for state workers and welfare reci
pients.
"You have got to make a judgment on how
much money you want to put into the school sys
tem so you can comply with the Serrano order" to
equalize school district spending, McCarthy said.
"You've got to make a judgment on whether you
want to give any level of cost-of-living increases to
state employees and to public assistance reci
pients."
