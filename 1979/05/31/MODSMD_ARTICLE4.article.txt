Believe it or not!
Construction of the long-delayed Albers Wall was restarted yesterday,
according to Roge» Cairns of Facilities Planning and Construction. Cairns
said workers plan to install the white bricks, which make up one side of the
structure, for the next two weeks. In the meantime, Cairns said, work will
begin on the steel bars which will be installed later on the other face of the
wall. Cairns said it would be "several weeks" before the entire job is
completed. "This is a specialty job," he explained. "It must be done with
care."
