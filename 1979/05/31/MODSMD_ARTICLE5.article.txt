# Holocaust scholar criticizes law limiting war crime prosecution
## 
### Tom Woolf 
"Hate will be unleashed in every democratic country
in the world" if West Germany fails to rescind its statute
of limitations on war crimes, Rabbi Abraham Cooper
said in a talk at the Old Union Clubhouse yesterday.
Cooper, who is an active leader of the Simon Wie
senthal Center for Holocaust Studies in Los Angeles,
told an audience of about 35 people that the statute of
limitations should be abolished so that certain war
crimes can be prosecuted at any time in the future.
The already once extended statute would make it im
possible to prosecute war crimes involving first-degree
murder after January 1, 1980.
Delegation
Earlier this month Cooper went to West Germany as
part of an American delegation which discussed the fate
of war criminal legislation. The delegation, consisting of
two congressmen, several survivors of the Holocaust,
prominent members of various religions and others,
met with German leaders, including Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt.
In an interview before the speech Cooper said
Schmidt is going "overboard to be cooperative." He is
"trying to de-politicize the issue" and even made a
strong statement for abolition of the statute in his role as
a member of Germany's parliament.
The American delegation's visit to West Germany
came in reply to Schmidt's appeal for an open dialogue
between West Germany and international Jewry,
Cooper said.
In that same appeal, Cooper added, Schmidt asked
the leaders of churches in Germany to step forward and
offer their views. So far, however, no church has taken a
stand on the issue. The "silence of the churches was the
most depressing part of the trip," Cooper said.
20-year limit
The West German statute of limitations dates back to
1871. The 20-year limit seemed like the maximum time
span that prosecution and evidence could even re
motely reach, Cooper said.
When the Federal Republic of Germany was formed in
1949 the law was not repealed.
After the war many powerful German war leaders
sought and gained political asylum in foreign countries,

where, Cooper said, they remained largely safe from
prosecution and publicity.
Cooper said he doesn't expect the "German republic
to suddenly wake up" and start hurriedly prosecuting all
war criminals. They have prosecuted 660 to date, Cooper
said.
Only the statute of limitations for first-degree murder
was extended. Less serious war crimes such as man
slaughter can no longer be prosecuted unless the crimi
nals were indicted before the statute of limitations ran
out, Cooper said.
Indirect involvement
Many of those indicted have claimed only indirect
involvement in Nazi war crimes in order to fall under the
unextended statute of limitations. "Already thousands
have escaped" this way, Cooper said.
The delegation spent much of its time talking to those
opposed to the removal of the statute, he said. He noted
that those opposed to the removal of the statute for
constitutional reasons were often amongst the first to
support the denial of constitutional rights in the case of
terrorist gangs.
Cooper said he expects that the vote which comes
within the next two months will be close. The issue has
become a political rather than a moral one in the 496
member Bundestag, the German parliment. But the vote
has to be on moral grounds, Cooper said. Those on both
sides of the issue who are afraid to speak up for political
reasons should be allowed to vote their conscience, not
their political affiliations, he said.
Some French statutes of limitations on war crimes
have already expired, Cooper noted. One French war
criminal absent from his trial was convicted and sen
tenced to death, but he had obtained asylum in Spain
and was not extradicted. The statute of limitations for
the carrying out of his sentence had expired.
Cooper said that contrary to popular myth, Nazi war
criminals are not helpless, old cripples. In fact, Cooper
asserted, these men could still have an impact on politi
cal and intellectual life.
Although the fear of punishment has, until now, kept
these people silent and powerless, Cooper said that he
wonders what may happen when all their hate is re
leased into the world.
