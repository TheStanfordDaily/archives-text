# British critic blames media for 'moral crisis'
## 
### Gayle Mayers 
Malcolm Muggeridge, a distin
guished British journalist and so
cial commentator, yesterday
criticized the mass media as being
responsible for "the erosion of
moral standards on which our
traditional way of life has been
based."
In a lecture on "The True Crisis
of Our Time" at the Hoover
Memorial Building, Muggeridge
attacked television as "the
greatest fabricator and purveyor
of fantasy that has ever existed."
Public awareness of the crisis
which today exists in Western
Civilization is "to some extent
muffled, if not obliterated by the
media," he said.
Muggeridge said that the only
obvious use of many of the so
called crises covered by the media
is "to sustain the editorials and
talk shows."
Gullible intelligentsia
News coverage "enables the
individual to continue in a state of
total vacuity," Muggeridge said.
Muggeridge gave an example of

what he called the gullibility ot
"Western intelligentsia." As a cor
respondent in Russia in the 1930s
he had facetiously misinformed a
visiting correspondent that Rus
sians were lining up outside the
shops because the workers were
"so ardently bent on building
socialism" that they could not be
persuaded to rest. Muggeridge
told the visitor that "the Soviet
government arranged lines so that
at least while standing in queues
they could be resting."
Neurotic passion
The lines were actually due to
shortages, but Muggeridge's exp
lanation was what appeared in the
press.
Speculating on what future his
torians would think of our civiliza
tion, Muggeridge described
Western society as having "on the
one hand a neurotic passion to
increase consumption, sustained
by every sort of imbicilic persua
sian" and the other, "ever increas
ing hunger . . . among the so
called backward or underde
veloped countries."

Muggeridge likened the televi
sion commercials to the type of
persuasions used by A/itch doc
tors when selling their wares.
Relationships demolished
He criticized acceptance of the
idea that change necessarily
means progress. He added that in
the "course of laying up treasures
on earth in the form of increasing
GNP (Cross National Product)"
human relationships are being
demolished. He said our search
for affluence could lead to total
deprivation.
Muggeridge, who described
himself as a "knockabout jour
nalist" was editor of Punch, a
British satirical magazine. He said
humor is "an expression of the
disparity between human aspira
tion and human performance."
Muggeridge conceded that his
job was not made easy by the
British sense of humor. "Nobody
could imagine anything more dif
ficult . . . than making my tellow
countrymen laugh,'' he said.
