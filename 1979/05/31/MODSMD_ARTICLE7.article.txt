# Robert Stone discusses Vietnam, his writing and himself
## 
### Karen Wada 
This is not about the life of
Robert Stone. But, in a way, it
is. It's about a month he spent
in Vietnam, what he did then
and what it did to him. This,
like his novel, Dog Soldiers, is
about the fighting and the
people affected by it, and
about neither of these. Some
thingsdon't make much sense.
Wars and writers' lives, for in
stance.
Stone went to Vietnam in
1971, with an idea for a book
and the desire to find "what we
were and what we were doing
there." He wanted to research

the heroin scene for an adapta
tion of the Ramayana, an an
cient Indian tale of pursuit in a
fantasy world. "I always was
fascinated by that. There's
something to taking the stuff of
legend and reducing it to the
level of ordinary realism and
having it reverberate."
But, once he was there, "the
plot structure dropped away
and the people became real to
me. The mythic element was
reinforced—Vietnam is a
supernatural place—but, sud
denly, I wanted to write about
how it was with America.
About the war, no, about the

people who had been in the
war."
He frowns. "A lot of Ameri
cans were there for screwy and
pretentious reasons. I suppose
mine was as screwy and pre
tentious as anybody's.
"But, I had been living in
London and had been hearing
this American reality second
hand. People who'd been
there were very much on my
mind. I had to get over there to
understand what it was. If I
wanted a right to an opinion, I
had to pay my moral dues."
The risks also intrigued him.
"I think everybody who went

over was influenced by that. I
talked with Mike Herr (author
of Dispatches) and he felt the
same way. It was part of the
whole experience."
Stone wasn't in Vietnam long
enough to find all he wanted,
especially about the elusive
dope scene. "I started with the
understanding that what I'd
find would befairly minimal. In
my bad French, I wished I had
(talked with and) learned more
about the Vietnamese. But, I
did see a lot . . . some very
dreamlike occurrences . . .the
places I went, because of my
doing the dope scene, were in

credible."
Stone's conversation pro
ceeds less by the rules of logic
than by free association. He is a
soft-edged man whose words
and thoughts sometimes melt
together. Yet, beneath this,
one senses the hard, clear
voice that produced Dog Sol
diers, a part of Stone which he
admits must be "prodded out
(of me), taken piece by piece."
For him, Vietnam wasn't the
kind of place you pasted in a
scrapbook. "It was hard to
make a reality connection. Ex
periences are fragmented, var
ied more than deep. I don't
mean to be cryptic, but I can't
give you a coherent response.
It all comes out in the book, I
think."
Yet, Stone insisted, Dog Sol
diers is not a Vietnam novel. "It
could be anywhere outside the
U.S., where there is the classic
outside intervention. That it
happened there is incidental."
And, its characters could be

any caught in a world they can
not control. "Nobody under
stood what was happening
with the war. It's a banal point,
but technology simply out
stripped our understanding.
There's this American tradi
tion, the 'Can Do Spirit.' We hit
the final resting place, though.
Can't do, this time, but nobody

Robert Stone's novel, Dog
Soldiers, won the National
Book Award in 1975. His first
novel, Hall of Mirrors, won the
Houghton Mifflin Fellowship
and William Faulkner Award in
7967. He received a Wallace
Stegner Fellowship in 1962 and
a Guggenheim Fellowship in
1970. His fiction has appeared
in New American Review and
Best American Short Stories.
He has taught at several col
leges and now is a lecturer in
the Creative Writing F'rogram
here.

saw that.
"Nobody meant to kill all
those people. Nobody sat in
Washington thinking about
masses of deaths. But, one step
atter another and we treated a
monster . . . weapons that
were literally monstrous. We
got ahead of ourselves and we
found nobody was on top.
Everybodywas caught up in it."
Stone was affected not so
much by the blood and bombs,
but by the mentality behind
them. "We can talk about the
irrationality of life but it
doesn't mean very much to the
people stuck in it." He com
pared the war to the making of
a bad movie. "All this equip
ment and men being moved
around. All out of control, in
the service of a delusion, with
nothing at the core."
But, this has happened many
times and will happen again,
he said. History is nothing but
"games played over and over
and people not learning any
thing at all."
Yet, "it's necessary to make a
leap of faith sometimes ... to
select an illusion and live with
it. I suppose I have a long
range optimism that whatever
moved the world to con
sciousness that first time can
come again."
Writers, according to Stone,
should deal with "how it is.
That's the only thing that mat
ters. Of course, with me, I've
got that old American writer's
disease. I want to encompass
the entire American experi
ence in one book. I want to tell
how all of it is."
That has preoccupied him
for as long as he remembers.
He said he has always wanted
to write, but he has never
known why. His upbringing
was "very far from that sort of
thing. It didn't seem available
to me. The tradition of my fam
ily didn't make it realistic. It
was too high falutin'."
Born in Brooklyn in 1937,
Stone grew up on the West
Side. "The people at school
pounded it into my head that I
couldn't succeed. I didn't get
on with them and they didn't
get on with me. I was an impos-
sible kid, not a good student."
So, he entered the Navy at
17. "It was expected."
He did go to college after the
service, but quit because he
was working nights at the New
York Daily News. "I'm pretty
much self-edutated. I haven't
felt I've missed a thing. Of
course, self-educated people
have gaps. Obsessives. I don't
feel uneducated at all. But,
then I've never seen myself as
academically inclined."
So, why is he a college lec
turer?
"The gods of irony brought it
to be."
Stone the teacher said he has
no information to give his writ
ing students. "All I can do is
point out the basic mistakes
they may be too close (to their
work) to see." He once wrote
an article for The Atlantic
Monthly on Vietnam deserters,
"the most boring story I've
ever done. I was trying to make
them look better than they
were. I was trying to justify my
view of the war. I was taking
. . . (but) I didn't realize it. I
was too involved with what I
was saying."
Stone said he also offers his

students feedback. "They
bring with them all they have.
By giving them responses I can
help them refine these skills."
That seems to have worked
for him. After the Navy and the
Daily News, he spent a year in
New Orleans, mainly because
he couldn't afford to get out. "I
was with the woman I'm mar
ried to ... we didn't have two
dimes to rub together. We
lived by the day . . . We did
every kind of job just to get
by."
He finally made it back to
New York, where he worked
on "schlock" newspapers until
he decided to write his first
novel, Hall of Mirrors, based on
his New Orleans experience.
"I wouldn't have got any
where with it if it weren't for a
Stegner Fellowship from Stan
ford. It changed my life en
tirely. It was the encourage
ment, the feedback. This was
the first time any institution,
any part of what I saw as this
monolith, had any time for
me."
Stone arrived in Palo Alto in
1962, Hall of Mirrors partially
begun. He left a few years later,
the book partially finished.
"I didn't know people lived

like this. . . that places like this
existed. I'd seen them only
from trains. I liked California. I
was hanging around the Kesey
scene. I still see a lot of those
people. Ken and I are very
good, old friends. Our world

views are dissimilar. Our meet
ing ground is our old times.
We've been out in all the
weather."
The Kesey crowd and Stan
ford turned into burden and
blessing. Stone became what
the book jackets called "an ac
tive participant in the
counterculture," which
meant, he said, "hanging
around a lot of dope and driv
ing in crazy vehicles."
"I had fun and I wouldn't
trade it, but I had to go to black
and white New York to finish
the book. I wasn't getting any
work done. It cost me time."
Time doesn't seem to con
cern him now. "At this point in
my life, I see lots of diagrams.
Characters. Plots. I'm going to
write forever. I want to make
sense of things, to give my
view. I also want to get away
from myself. All my characters
and none of them are like me.
I'd rather make things up.
They're truer than real things."
He's trying to write "for
somebody out there, some
body who thinks like me and
has my sensibility. Somebody
who doesn't exist." He laughs.
"Maybe, I'm just kidding my
self."
