# Prof claims House has 'sneaked' draft legislation
## 
### 
For the first time in history, the
U.S. Congress has "sneaked" draft
legislation through as a rider on a
"routine money bill," History Prof.
Paul Seaver told 250 persons at an
antidraft rally in White Plaza yester
day.
The bill is expected to reach the
floor of the House next week, where
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
has said he will amend it to include
women.
"I believe in women's rights and I
believe with equal rights women
should share equal obligations,"
McCloskey said in Washington yes
terday. "Many jobs in the Army can
be done by women."
However, McCloskey added that
women should not be assigned to
combat units.
If passed in its current form, Sea
ver said, the routine drafting of 18-
year-olds will become effective in
January 1981, allowing congressmen
some leeway in the 1980 election
campaigns.
The draft rider has already been
heard before a subcommittee of the
House Armed Services Committee,
which heard it without public input,
Seaver said.
On May 21 the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee listened to 10
groups, "nine of whom opposed it,"
Seaver said.
The rally, called by Stanford Stu

dents Against Conscription (SAC),
also heard an impassioned plea for
draft resistance from David Harris,
former student body president here
and antidraft activist.
Harris recalled that he had been
coming to White Plaza, first as a
student, over the past 15 years to
fight conscription, and said, "I'm
getting sick of it."
The draft, he said, gives the gov
ernment "military latitude" to re
spond to emergencies anywhere in
the world without the consent of
those sent to serve.
Without being able to participate

in that kind of a decision, young
Americans 10 years ago were being
sent to Vietnam. This produced
55,000 dead and 300,000 wounded,
maimed, or disabled, he said.
Now, "after 10 years of lying and
deceiving, they can't get the same
blank check right back again," Harris
said, to prolonged cheers and
applause.
Government policy, he charged,
hasn't changed in any aspect since
the Vietnam days or since the draft
was abolished.
"They're still asking for totalitarian
power, the suspension of all con
stitutional rights and liberties," he
said.
Government policy
"If we're in a national emergency
that requires a draft," Harris said,
"let Congress stand up and say so
honestly.
"Old people make the emergen
cies that young people must die for,"
he added.
He urged his student audience "to
prepare for passage of the draft this
summer" and "get organized to
handle it.
"You must make up your mind
whether to sign up, because you
cannot cooperate with to
talitarianism without becoming part
of it yourself."
Harris, who served a term in fed
eral prison as a conscientious objec
tor, said: "Don't be misled this time.
Refuse to let another 55,000 be
sacrificed—lying face down in a rice
paddy."
No memorials
There are memorials to all those
who fought in the wars from the Re
volution to World War 11, Harris said,
but there is none for those who
fought and died in Vietnam.
"There's no memorial for them un
less you speak for them!" he said.
"The only defense for liberty is stand
ing up in defense of your own!"
His talk was applauded and
cheered for more than two minutes.

For the first time in history, the
U.S. Congress has "sneaked" draft
legislation through as a rider on a
"routine money bill," History Prof.
Paul Seaver told 250 persons at an
antidraft rally in White Plaza yester
day.
The bill is expected to reach the
floor of the House next week, where
Rep. Paul McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
has said he will amend it to include
women.
"I believe in women's rights and I
believe with equal rights women
should share equal obligations,"
McCloskey said in Washington yes
terday. "Many jobs in the Army can
be done by women."
However, McCloskey added that
women should not be assigned to
combat units.
If passed in its current form, Sea
ver said, the routine drafting of 18-
year-olds will become effective in
January 1981, allowing congressmen
some leeway in the 1980 election
campaigns.
The draft rider has already been
heard before a subcommittee of the
House Armed Services Committee,
which heard it without public input,
Seaver said.
On May 21 the Senate Armed Ser
vices Committee listened to 10
groups, "nine of whom opposed it,"
Seaver said.
The rally, called by Stanford Stu

dents Against Conscription (SAC),
also heard an impassioned plea for
draft resistance from David Harris,
former student body president here
and antidraft activist.
Harris recalled that he had been
coming to White Plaza, first as a
student, over the past 15 years to
fight conscription, and said, "I'm
getting sick of it."
The draft, he said, gives the gov
ernment "military latitude" to re
spond to emergencies anywhere in
the world without the consent of
those sent to serve.
Without being able to participate

in that kind of a decision, young
Americans 10 years ago were being
sent to Vietnam. This produced
55,000 dead and 300,000 wounded,
maimed, or disabled, he said.
Now, "after 10 years of lying and
deceiving, they can't get the same
blank check right back again," Harris
said, to prolonged cheers and
applause.
Government policy, he charged,
hasn't changed in any aspect since
the Vietnam days or since the draft
was abolished.
"They're still asking for totalitarian
power, the suspension of all con
stitutional rights and liberties," he
said.
Government policy
"If we're in a national emergency
that requires a draft," Harris said,
"let Congress stand up and say so
honestly.
"Old people make the emergen
cies that young people must die for,"
he added.
He urged his student audience "to
prepare for passage of the draft this
summer" and "get organized to
handle it.
"You must make up your mind
whether to sign up, because you
cannot cooperate with to
talitarianism without becoming part
of it yourself."
Harris, who served a term in fed
eral prison as a conscientious objec
tor, said: "Don't be misled this time.
Refuse to let another 55,000 be
sacrificed—lying face down in a rice
paddy."
No memorials
There are memorials to all those
who fought in the wars from the Re
volution to World War 11, Harris said,
but there is none for those who
fought and died in Vietnam.
"There's no memorial for them un
less you speak for them!" he said.
"The only defense for liberty is stand
ing up in defense of your own!"
His talk was applauded and
cheered for more than two minutes.
