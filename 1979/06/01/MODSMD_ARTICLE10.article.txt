# Hong Kong flooded with Vietnam refugees

### 
Hong Kong (AP) — This tiny
British colony, inundated by a
torrent of refugees from Viet
nam and the biggest wave of
Chinese immigration in 17
years, insists better-endowed
nations must help it deal with
the international problem of

homeless, stateless persons.
Hong Kong's small navy and
handful of marine launches,
small planes and helicopters
are incapable of stopping the
flow of refugees arriving from
Vietnam in steadily increasing
numbers aboard small boats

and freighters.
Since January, more than
33,000 refugees from Vietnam
have crowded into this island
colony, more than five times
the number who arrived in all
of 1978.
The latest arrivals were 1029
Vietnamese who sailed into
Hong Kong harbor aboard 15
fishing boats last weekend,
shortly after 1400 Vietnamese
beached a freighter on an
offshore island. An additional
982 have been stranded on a
freighter just outside territorial
waters since they were rescued
from two sinking boats in the
South China Sea.
So far this year, the number
of legal immigrants from China
stands at 46,700, up 160 percent
from the same period last year.
Police said they have rounded
up and sent back 29,000 illegal
refugees from China, com
pared with 10,000 in the same
period last year. But they esti
mate that for every one caught,
three elude border patrols and
lose themselves in this teeming
city.
The huge influx has created
serious economic and social
problems for Hong Kong. Most
of the colony's 4.7 million
people live in the 39 square
miles of Hong Kong Island and
Kowloon Peninsula, and al

most half of them live in
government-subsidized hous
ing. There are 700,000 already
on waiting lists for public hous
ing.
All the Vietnamese here,
many of them ethnic Chinese,
are awaiting resettlement in
other countries, but few coun
tries are willing to take them.
Chief Secretary lack Cater
said only 4 percent of the Viet
namese refugees who arrived
here since 1975 have been
resettled—mostly in the Un
ited States. Officials privately
say they fear most of the home
less will be stuck in the colony
permanently.

The government is spending
about $} 000 a day on their
food alone.
"Resettlement is not a prob
lem for Hong Kong nor for the
countries of Southeast Asia to
solve—this is an international
problem requiring concerted
international actions," Cater
recently told the Legislative
Council, the colony's lawmak
ing body.
"It demands and requires a
much greater effort on the part
of the nations of the world, and
especially on the part of those
well-endowed with resources,
who undoubtedly could do
more to help."
