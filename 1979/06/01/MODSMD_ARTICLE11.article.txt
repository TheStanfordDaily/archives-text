# King of Swing turns 70 in N.Y.

### 
New York (AP) — Could it be
that Benny Goodman is still the
"sensible Jewish boy" who
"ran like hell all the way home"
after smoking a marijuana
cigarette outside a Chicago
nightclub 55 years ago?
The king of Swing, who
turned 70 Wednesday, insists
with a laugh: "I am not all that
stable."
Vet that second reefer is still
waiting to be smoked.
Decades after being recog
nized as the world's greatest
jazz clarinet player, Goodman
typically is taking nothing for
granted. Daily practice ses
sionsbegin with the same mus
ical scales he learned in
Chicago when he was 10.
He maintains "every note
counts" and advises: "You
can't do it by memory. You
have to work at it. Your fingers
have to be limber. Your body
has to be in shape."
They are old-fashioned mes
sages from an old-fashioned
man who always managed dar

ing, new sounds on the
clarinet.
The quiet man with the glas
ses, whose looks years ago
were compared to those of an
assistant chemistry professor,
has always been the calm fix
ture in the middle of the swirl
ing musical storm he created.
His secret is no secret at all.
His work ethic is as rigid and
his work habits as steady as his
clarinet-playing has always
been experimental and spec
tacular.
"If you want to play in Car
negie Hall, then practice," he
said.
Goodman still does, though
he has been to the famed con
cert hall and back.
His music has kept millions
dancing through the night—
yet these days Goodman usu
ally goes to bed by 10 p.m.,
with his radio tuned to classical
music.
Disco, he says, "is not for
me. There's a sameness to it
that's unbelievable. It's bor
ing."
