# Policy regarding dead week broad
## 
### Andrew Rich 
"Dead week is a period of
reduced social and extra
curricular activity preceding
final examinations. Its purpose
is to permit students to con
centrate on academic work and
to prepare for final examina
tions."
So says the Dead Week Pol
icy Statement, adopted by the
Faculty Senate lastautumn. But
students often complain that
professors not only hold clas
ses, but give additional as
signments during dead week.
Actually, these practices are
not necessarily counter to the
policy. Though "no graded
homework assignments, man
datory quizzes or examinations
should be given during dead

week," according to the pol
icy, there are exceptions. For
example, when such assign
ments or quizzes are routine
parts of the class, or in lab clas
ses, they are permissable.
Take-home exams may be
handed out but not collected
during dead week. Projects or
papers which the students
have been sufficiently warned
about may also be due then.
Though the senate has pre
viously adopted statements
about dead week, according to
Associate Registrar Robert
Houghton, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies
thought a little more explana
tion would help clarify their
policy.
If a student feels that what a

particular professor is doing is
not in compliance with this pol
icy, he "should really first see
the professor," Houghton
said.
"Some students have gone
to the Ombudsman/'
Houghton added, but the re
gistrar's office "would be wil
ling to pick it up. We are more
than willing to contact the pro
fessor."
Other schools handle their
pre-examination periods diffe
rently. Harvard has a two-week
reading period before finals.
Though classes generally do
not meet during this period,
"not all classes observe it.
Most of the sciences don't,"
said Harvard Associate Regis
trar Douglass Gardener.
"Those classes that do ob
serve the reading period will
assign additional work," Gar
dener added.
Stanford considered a read
ing period, according to
Houghton, but "the University
didn't want to change the na
ture of dead week." Some of
the reasons included the fact
that the quarter schedule did
not leave enough time, and
that many classes aren't adapt
able to a completely free
period. Under this system, the
professor has the option to de
cide which is more important.
End-quarter examinations
are also specifically outlined
here. Students are expected to
resolve any conflicts regarding
exams at the beginning of the
quarter when they enroll in
classes. Final exam schedules,

as well as both the dead week
policy and exam policy, are
printed in the Time Schedule
each quarter.
Harvard differs in this re
spect also. Their final exam
period lasts 11 days, with a
morning and afternoon exam
period each day. Even more in
teresting, the examinations are
scheduled atter the semester
begins. With the help of a
computer, the registrar's office
picks the exam groups for each
day in such a manner as will
give the fewest number of stu
dents two exams in one day.
When conflicts arise, the af
fected students are contacted
personally, in order to resolve
the problems.
The finals system at UC-
Berkeley is similar to Stan
ford's. There are three finals
each day for a week with each
class's final determined ahead
of time and listed at the begin
ning of the quarter.
"It can happen that, because
a student must complete re
quirements, he cannot
schedule his finals as he wants
them," said Cal Admissions
Advisor Mike McLaughlin, but
usuallyyou "can scheduleyour
finals as early or late'as you
want to."
While the finals system at
Berkeley resembles Stanford's,
their dead week policy does
not. In fact, they don't have a
dead week. Classes continue
right up to the Friday of the
10th week of the quarter, and
final exams begin the following
week.
