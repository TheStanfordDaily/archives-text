## Support the Pub Board 
### 
The ASSU Publications Board is suffer
ing these days. Suffering from the same
disease which has affected many student
organizations on campus — apathy.
But when we speak of the Pub Board,
we believe more is at stake than just los
ing a few "alternative" publications.
This year, the Pub Board allocated
$7000 to 13 publications. Without that
money, few of those publications would
have made it off the presses.
The Pub Board was also responsible
for the Student Directory. The award
winning rape education pamphlet pub
lished here this year received much of its
production costs from the Pub Board,
too.
The Pub Board has the potential of af
fecting the lives of every student on
campus. Instead, because of disinterest,
it is slowly drifting into nonexistence.
The publications it sponsors are going
with it.
The Pub Board was one of the lowest
vote-getting fee assessment proposals
approved this year, indicating that many
people don't care about it.
Moreover, Pub Board Chairman Ray
Thomas reports that every alternative
publication on campus is suffering from
staffing problems. These publications
are vital to ensure a continued free inter
change of ideas and perspectives in this
University community. Currently, it
would appear that interest such an
interchange has dwindled.
This year alone, Thomas reports
Winds, the Asian American publication,
has had to cancel a number of issues
simply because of lack of staff. Sequoia,
the literary magazine, wanted to put out

an all-student issue this year, but
Thomas says the response was less than
outstanding. Aurora, the feminist news
paper, has seen its staff drop to four ac
tive people, and Thomas says they ex
pect only two will return next year.
Moreover, general Pub Board funding
projects like the Student Directory, the
Blotter, and the Money Book are not
realizing the return they could because
there are not enough people. "The pro
jects are below par, Thomas says, "be
cause we have to depend on already
overworked staff from the other publica
tions."
The key is that the publications need
student support, and they need it now.
People are still needed through the
summer to ensure that the Money Book
and the Directory will produce enough
of a profit to fund some publications
next year. And in the fall, people will be
needed to ensure that the Pub Board
allocations are put to good use, to help
inform the public of different perspec
tives on the issues, and to shed addi
tional light on the substance of the is
sues themselves.
It is incumbent upon this community
to support every publication on campus.
In any society— but especially in a Uni
versity setting — such an attitude is im
perative lest an end to free interchange
and healthy discussion of the issues re
sult.
Without student participation in alter
native publications, the day will quickly
arrive when the sum total of "perspec
tive" from this campus will come from
the pages of the Daily, Campus Report
and the Observer.
