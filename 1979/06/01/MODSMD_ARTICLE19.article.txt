# Search immunity for non-suspects
## 
### 
When police were using search
warrants to raid newspaper offices
to find evidence of crimes which
journalists did not commit, many
people were enraged that the press
would dare to claim it should be
immune from these searches. Yet,
as we editorialized last June after
losing our'case over a police search
of our offices in the U.S. Supreme
Court, it would not be long before
innocent citizens and others who
held confidential information —
doctors, clergymen and lawyers —
found themselves at the mercy of
police officers armed with search
warrants.
In the last few months, California
Attorney General George Deukme
jian has searched lawyers' offices
three times. Deukmejian, who is
making former attorney general
Evelle Younger look like a pillar of
the Bill of Rights, has said lawyers
do not have stronger protection
against these searches than any
other person. Last September,
Santa Clara County District Attor
ney Louis Bergna used a search
warrant to seize materials from
the county Public Defender's Of
fice. (Bergna has also used search
warrants to look for evidence in the
files of Stanford Hospital and this
newspaper.) These searches have

come in the wake of the Supreme
Court's decision, but the idea isn't
that new for California prosecutors,
as a San Diego defense attorney
had his offices searched in 1976,
whileourcasewas beingappealed.
Prosecutors seem to be forget
ting that the attorney-client
privilege is protected by law, and,
even if the Supreme Court feels
people have no protection from
these searches under the Fourth
Amendment, the right to legal
counsel and the right not to in
criminate ourselves are still guaran
teed by other amendments. These
basic cornerstones of our nation
are destroyed when prosecutors
can paw through attorneys' files to
see what their clients might have
told them.
Perhaps if prosecutors could be
searched, these authoritarian sear
chers would be halted. But since
lawyers can't search prosecutors
and see what "evidence" they
have, it seems the only solution is
legislation. Last fall, a bill was intro
duced in the California Legislature
to protect all non-suspects from
searches unless certain conditions
could be shown. Under strong
pressure, legislators struck out the
passages of the bill which v\ould
have protected lawyers, businesses

and other citizens and only passed
a law which protects journalists.
However, following Deukme
jian's searches, the Assembly Jus
tice Committee passed Assembly
Bill 1609 last week which would pro
tect all non-suspects from further
searches. We hope this bill be
comes law quickly, for it seems this
is the only way to leash overzealous
prosecutors who think they are br
inging us "law and order" by emas
culating some of our dearest con
stitutional rights.
Several bills are pending in Con
gress which would protect from
these searches everyone in the
country who is not a suspect, but
since virtually all the searches
against non-suspect journalists, la
wyers and doctors have occurred in
California, it is imperative that the
legislature and the governor act
immediately on this matter.
In the meantime, it should be
remembered that the prosecutors
who are conducting these searches
are elected officials, and the judges
who issue the search warrants are
either elected or appointed by
elected officials. Those people who
feel that these searches have no
place in this state should consider
letting their public officials know
what they think of these actions.
