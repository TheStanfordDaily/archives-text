Carl Danner, a senior here,
caught a glimpse of a country that
has been off limits to Americans
for a quarter-century when he vis
ited North Korea for the World
Table Tennis Championships in
May.
Danner traveled with the 42-
member American defegation as a
journalist for Table Tennis Topics,
a magazine he helps edit. The
American group was the first al
lowed in North Korea since the
Korean War ended in 1953.
The Americans placed 15th in
men's and women's competition,
while China fared best in the
biannual championships, accord
ing to Danner.
The visit evoked memories of a
1971 trip to China by another
American table tennis team which
helped pave the way to normaliza
tion of U.S.-China relations.
In an interview Danner warned
against drawing the parallel to
U.S.-North Korean relations. The
United States has no diplomatic
ties with North Korea and the
American visit was not sanctioned
by the State Dept., according to
Danner.
Embarrassment?
"The State Department didn't
want us to go," he said. "I think
we were an embarrassment to
them because our trip violated of
ficial U.S. policy which treats
North Korea as a hostile nation,"
Danner explained.
Until recently, the feeling bet
ween the United States and the
communist state has been
mutual. During their visit, how
ever, Danner said that the North
Koreans made "a tremendous ef

fort" to make the American dele
gation, one of 60 teams, feel wel
come.
"They did their best to hide
anti-American propaganda," he
said, though Danner managed to
buy several current North Korean
stamps which condemned "U.S.
imperialism."
Pyongyang
Danner said he was impressed
by Pyongyang, the capital of
North Korea, "especially since the
city was destroyed by the Ameri
cans in the Korean War." Danner
described the city as "very clean
with lots of new buildings,
boulevards and trees."
Pyongyang seemed like a
showpiece to Danner, but as far as
he could tell, a legitimate one,
with an efficient subway system
and numerous apartment build
ings.
The only thing missing from the
city was people, Danner said.
Streets were virtually empty and
those North Koreans the Ameri
