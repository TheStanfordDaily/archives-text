### Susan Essoyan 
Carl Danner, a senior here,
caught a glimpse of a country that
has been off limits to Americans
for a quarter-century when he vis
ited North Korea for the World
Table Tennis Championships in
May.
Danner traveled with the 42-
member American defegation as a
journalist for Table Tennis Topics,
a magazine he helps edit. The
American group was the first al
lowed in North Korea since the
Korean War ended in 1953.
The Americans placed 15th in
men's and women's competition,
while China fared best in the
biannual championships, accord
ing to Danner.
The visit evoked memories of a
1971 trip to China by another
American table tennis team which
helped pave the way to normaliza
tion of U.S.-China relations.
In an interview Danner warned
against drawing the parallel to
U.S.-North Korean relations. The
United States has no diplomatic
ties with North Korea and the
American visit was not sanctioned
by the State Dept., according to
Danner.
Embarrassment?
"The State Department didn't
want us to go," he said. "I think
we were an embarrassment to
them because our trip violated of
ficial U.S. policy which treats
North Korea as a hostile nation,"
Danner explained.
Until recently, the feeling bet
ween the United States and the
communist state has been
mutual. During their visit, how
ever, Danner said that the North
Koreans made "a tremendous ef

fort" to make the American dele
gation, one of 60 teams, feel wel
come.
"They did their best to hide
anti-American propaganda," he
said, though Danner managed to
buy several current North Korean
stamps which condemned "U.S.
imperialism."
Pyongyang
Danner said he was impressed
by Pyongyang, the capital of
North Korea, "especially since the
city was destroyed by the Ameri
cans in the Korean War." Danner
described the city as "very clean
with lots of new buildings,
boulevards and trees."
Pyongyang seemed like a
showpiece to Danner, but as far as
he could tell, a legitimate one,
with an efficient subway system
and numerous apartment build
ings.
The only thing missing from the
city was people, Danner said.
Streets were virtually empty and
those North Koreans the Ameri


Carl Danner
cans happened to meet generally
looked the other way, he said.
North Koreans, from stewar
desses on Democratic Peoples
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Airlines
to children on the street, all wore
Kim 11-Sung buttons.
Personality cult?
Kim, president of the DPRK, has
built up an overwhelming per
sonality cult, according to ban
ner. A 70-foot statue and hun
dreds of smaller ones of "our be
loved father" dominate the city,
Danner said. Large murals
throughout the city depict the
66-year-old Kim with "the
people."
Danner said he found that the
North Koreans "have no perspec
tive." Everything that goes right in

North Korea is attributed to Kim,
he said. The question of succes
sion in case of Kim's death did not
arise during the visit, but Ameri
cans believe Kim's son is being
groomed for his father's position.
The main goal of North Ko
reans' appears to be reunification
of Korea, according to Danner.
North Koreans said the only obs
tacle to peaceful reunification was
U.S. troops based in South Korea.
'Shocked disbelief'
Danner said he was surprised
by a lack of North Korean interest
in and knowledge of the outside
world. He said that when an
American asked a North Korean
interpreter whether he knew a
man had been landed on the
moon, the interpreter reacted
with "shocked disbelief."

Americans were free to walk
around the city and take pictures
for the first few days, Dannersaid.
But the freedom did not last long
because a couple of members of
the U.S. delegation "did some
stupid things." Also, the North
Koreans seemed worried about
the aggressive way the Americans
were using theirfreedom, Danner
said. Thereafter the group was ac
companied by guides.
"Except for the ever-present
propaganda in public places, the
city resembled any new European
city, Danner, a native New Yorker,
said.
The countryside was "wetter
than California" with abundant
rice paddies and wheat fields.
Danner likened it to scenes from
the television series M'A'S'H.

stupid things." Also, the North
Koreans seemed worried about
the aggressive way the Americans
were using theirfreedom, Danner
said. Thereafter the group was ac
companied by guides.
"Except for the ever-present
propaganda in public places, the
city resembled any new European
city, Danner, a native New Yorker,
said.
The countryside was "wetter
than California" with abundant
rice paddies and wheat fields.
Danner likened it to scenes from
the television series M'A'S'H.
Carl Danner, a senior here,
caught a glimpse of a country that
has been off limits to Americans
for a quarter-century when he vis
ited North Korea for the World
Table Tennis Championships in
May.
Danner traveled with the 42-
member American defegation as a
journalist for Table Tennis Topics,
a magazine he helps edit. The
American group was the first al
lowed in North Korea since the
Korean War ended in 1953.
The Americans placed 15th in
men's and women's competition,
while China fared best in the
biannual championships, accord
ing to Danner.
The visit evoked memories of a
1971 trip to China by another
American table tennis team which
helped pave the way to normaliza
tion of U.S.-China relations.
In an interview Danner warned
against drawing the parallel to
U.S.-North Korean relations. The
United States has no diplomatic
ties with North Korea and the
American visit was not sanctioned
by the State Dept., according to
Danner.
Embarrassment?
"The State Department didn't
want us to go," he said. "I think
we were an embarrassment to
them because our trip violated of
ficial U.S. policy which treats
North Korea as a hostile nation,"
Danner explained.
Until recently, the feeling bet
ween the United States and the
communist state has been
mutual. During their visit, how
ever, Danner said that the North
Koreans made "a tremendous ef

fort" to make the American dele
gation, one of 60 teams, feel wel
come.
"They did their best to hide
anti-American propaganda," he
said, though Danner managed to
buy several current North Korean
stamps which condemned "U.S.
imperialism."
Pyongyang
Danner said he was impressed
by Pyongyang, the capital of
North Korea, "especially since the
city was destroyed by the Ameri
cans in the Korean War." Danner
described the city as "very clean
with lots of new buildings,
boulevards and trees."
Pyongyang seemed like a
showpiece to Danner, but as far as
he could tell, a legitimate one,
with an efficient subway system
and numerous apartment build
ings.
The only thing missing from the
city was people, Danner said.
Streets were virtually empty and
those North Koreans the Ameri


Carl Danner
cans happened to meet generally
looked the other way, he said.
North Koreans, from stewar
desses on Democratic Peoples
Republic of Korea (DPRK) Airlines
to children on the street, all wore
Kim 11-Sung buttons.
Personality cult?
Kim, president of the DPRK, has
built up an overwhelming per
sonality cult, according to ban
ner. A 70-foot statue and hun
dreds of smaller ones of "our be
loved father" dominate the city,
Danner said. Large murals
throughout the city depict the
66-year-old Kim with "the
people."
Danner said he found that the
North Koreans "have no perspec
tive." Everything that goes right in

North Korea is attributed to Kim,
he said. The question of succes
sion in case of Kim's death did not
arise during the visit, but Ameri
cans believe Kim's son is being
groomed for his father's position.
The main goal of North Ko
reans' appears to be reunification
of Korea, according to Danner.
North Koreans said the only obs
tacle to peaceful reunification was
U.S. troops based in South Korea.
'Shocked disbelief'
Danner said he was surprised
by a lack of North Korean interest
in and knowledge of the outside
world. He said that when an
American asked a North Korean
interpreter whether he knew a
man had been landed on the
moon, the interpreter reacted
with "shocked disbelief."

Americans were free to walk
around the city and take pictures
for the first few days, Dannersaid.
But the freedom did not last long
because a couple of members of
the U.S. delegation "did some
stupid things." Also, the North
Koreans seemed worried about
the aggressive way the Americans
were using theirfreedom, Danner
said. Thereafter the group was ac
companied by guides.
