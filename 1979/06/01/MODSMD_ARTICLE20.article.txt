Is winning all?
I've heard the phrases "win
ner takes all," "everyone loves
a winner," "it's win or no
thing," and others in a similar
vein so many times that I
thought I had surely become
deadened to them. Not so. Last
Saturday I was jolted back into
realizing the unhappy truth of
what they were saying.
The locale: Stanford's varsity
tennis courts.
The occasion: Stanford vs.
UCLA in tennis.
The attendance: Predomin
antly Stanford supporters.
The scenario: Bondurant (S)
beats Metz (UCLA): crowd be
comes ecstatic. Arons (S)
edges Freeman (UCLA): crowd
goes wild with joy and praises.
Hodges (S) loses to Brescia
(UCLA) in a close match:
crowd silent, they even look
away from Hodges.
Second locale Maples Pavil
ion, later the same day.
The occasion: Stanford and
UCLA player introductions.
The attendance: Essentially
the same as above.
The scenario: Bondurant in
troduced; crowd roars its ap
proval. Arons introduced;

crowd in pandemonium,
Arons — Bondurant hug each
other. Hodges introduced;
crowd again silent, and
players, too, ignore him.
Has Hodges acquired leper
status? Was he always unpopu
lar? Or has America let this
"Cult of Winning" attitude get
too far?

Conflict of interest
Space forbids a full answer to
John Paval (Daily, May 29) on
the firing of English Assoc.
Prof. Bruce Franklin, but a few
points should be addressed.
Paval, who apparently draws
his information on the case
from "eyewitness reports
(that) indicated that he
(Franklin) more or less helped
to incite a riot" — a beguiling
legal concept and mind
boggling font of possibilities
for being severed from the
University's employ — says,
with more faith than facts, that
"heaven knows the University
did not seek out the opportun
ity to remove Franklin."
They did, though, freeze his

salary for several years, deny
him the promotion his de
partment had unanimously re
commended for him. They also
produced hundreds of photo
graphs of hi m taken at a speech
by diplomat Henry Cabot
Lodge, also attended by some
700 other people, to sustain
their charge (not even upheld
by the Advisory Board) that he
had disrupted the event.
All of the photos, inciden
tally, showed Franklin sitting
with his little boy on his lap. It
seems heaven needs a bit of
education.
"Friends of the University
are attacked for helping out in
its defense," says Paval. The
"friends" are Morris Doyle and
Robert Brown, who, as Stan
ford trustees, are defendants
in the suit the American Civil
Liberties Union brought
against the University on
Franklin's behalf.
They are also partners in the
firm of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown and Enerson, the attor
neys paid — out of University
funds — for "helping out in its
defense," that is helping out
themselves, among others.
According to public Internal

Revenue Service figures {Daily,
Dec. 2, 1976), McCutchen,
Doyle, Brown and Enerson re
ceived $199,585 from Univer
sity funds in 1972, when the
Franklin suit was first brought.
It made them the third-highest
paid "persons compensated by
the University for professional
services."
In 1973, with the suit fairly
active in the courts, they
moved up to second highest,
with $228,411.
In fust those two years, trus
tees Doyle and Brown must
have collected their share, as
partners, of close to $430,000
paid for legal work (of which
the Franklin suit was doubtless
a substantial part) to their firm
by the University whose funds
are in their trust.
Such costs, like everything
else, have surely risen consid
erably in the years since then.
Paval says piously the "issues
transcend the expense." I say
the expense is an issue, and so
is the trustees' role in the case.
Offhand, it doesn't seem all
that holy.
