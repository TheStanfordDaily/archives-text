## 'We cannot have any more war' 
### 
Make no mistake about it.
The Third World War is on its
way. And it will be a disaster. As
my friend, scientist Albert
Einstein, said just before his
death, a third world war will
engulf three-quarters of the
world. Einstein said it simply:
"We cannot have any more
war."
Is it too late? I don't think so.
In 1916, I was involved in the

Battle of Verdun, a battle in
which one million young
people lost their lives. Follow
ing that horrid battle, I wrote
this poem:
War
Soldier, dance, embrace me
fast;
a million eyes admire you,
the nation's idol. While you
dance,
your brow will grow a laurel
wreath:
You rise above the law.
How proud you wear your col
ored coat.
Not the civilian, you belong
to every girl with sprouting
breasts.
Oh boy, when you have gained
a medal,
you put self Cod in awe.
And where the flag, there is the
cross:
you will be blessed with sacred
mouth.
Your mother waves a last
farewell.
She smiles and does not dare
to weep,
for glory is in season.
And when you meet your
enemy,
you are a man, he is a man.
And though you never saw his
face,
hit first and have no consci
ence trips.
A thinking soldier — treason!
Your head and heart be jolly
light,

march and invade, strew death
about—
Oh soldiers' joy! When you re
turn
you march with music through
the streets;
your girl carries your gun.
Does fate wrap you in a canvas
shroud,
know this: Our Cod has much
to do.
When you were hit He saw
tears flow
from a mother's cheek on the
other side.
She, too, prayed for her son.
But you ascend, a soldier's
grave
with cross assures next life with
Christ.
What never a human eye has
seen,
no hope has hoped, is your re
ward —
you fell, God loves you more.
And here on earth, a thousand
years
sing of a hero's sacrifice.
Memorial Day is mother's
praise.
Come, youth, the grateful na
tion calls,
let flags and trumpets soar!
The colored coat waits for you,
too.
How it enhances manliness!
How it prepares your chest for
medals!
On every finger hangs a
sweetheart—
you are creation's pride.

War is my name, youth dance
with me!
I'm sexless lust, I'm blas
phemy!
I love the woman, love the
man,
embrace the child in mother's
womb,
I'm murder sanctified!
After I read this poem to 5000
students at San Jose State Uni
versity shortly after the begin
ning of the Vietnam War, a
group of 22 tore up their draft
cards. It was at that time that I
understood that American
youth sees war differently than
those in my native Germany.
You see, the Nazis thought
that war was glory. Hitler once
said, "We want 'brutal youth'
with which I will become mas
ter of the world."
But American youth wants
peace. And peace is what we
must strive for. We must form a
world youth community, as
Einstein himself proposed, to
create the "cosmic man," that
is man with a cosmic consci
ence, man who is conscious oi
one man and one humanity.
This was Einstein's message,
and it is mine. Peace is our only
solution.

this poem:
War
Soldier, dance, embrace me
fast;
a million eyes admire you,
the nation's idol. While you
dance,
your brow will grow a laurel
wreath:
You rise above the law.
How proud you wear your col
ored coat.
Not the civilian, you belong
to every girl with sprouting
breasts.
Oh boy, when you have gained
a medal,
you put self Cod in awe.
And where the flag, there is the
cross:
you will be blessed with sacred
mouth.
Your mother waves a last
farewell.
She smiles and does not dare
to weep,
for glory is in season.
And when you meet your
enemy,
you are a man, he is a man.
And though you never saw his
face,
hit first and have no consci
ence trips.
A thinking soldier — treason!
Your head and heart be jolly
light,

march and invade, strew death
about—
Oh soldiers' joy! When you re
turn
you march with music through
the streets;
your girl carries your gun.
Does fate wrap you in a canvas
shroud,
know this: Our Cod has much
to do.
When you were hit He saw
tears flow
from a mother's cheek on the
other side.
She, too, prayed for her son.
But you ascend, a soldier's
grave
with cross assures next life with
Christ.
What never a human eye has
seen,
no hope has hoped, is your re
ward —
you fell, God loves you more.
And here on earth, a thousand
years
sing of a hero's sacrifice.
Memorial Day is mother's
praise.
Come, youth, the grateful na
tion calls,
let flags and trumpets soar!
The colored coat waits for you,
too.
How it enhances manliness!
How it prepares your chest for
medals!
On every finger hangs a
sweetheart—
you are creation's pride.

War is my name, youth dance
with me!
I'm sexless lust, I'm blas
phemy!
I love the woman, love the
man,
embrace the child in mother's
womb,
I'm murder sanctified!
After I read this poem to 5000
students at San Jose State Uni
versity shortly after the begin
ning of the Vietnam War, a
group of 22 tore up their draft
cards. It was at that time that I
understood that American
youth sees war differently than
those in my native Germany.
You see, the Nazis thought
that war was glory. Hitler once
said, "We want 'brutal youth'
with which I will become mas
ter of the world."
But American youth wants
peace. And peace is what we
must strive for. We must form a
world youth community, as
Einstein himself proposed, to
create the "cosmic man," that
is man with a cosmic consci
ence, man who is conscious oi
one man and one humanity.
This was Einstein's message,
and it is mine. Peace is our only
solution.

1934.)
