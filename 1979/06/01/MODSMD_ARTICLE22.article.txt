# Carter and Min
## Oh Ned completely off base 
### 
Okay. We've finally had it.
We can take a comic strip
that's just not funny. This
phenomenon is nothing new
to the Daily reader. We can
even let another display of
casual sexism pass unnoticed,
as wild and crazy coeds plot to
seduce unsuspecting rape es
corts.
It was even getting to be fun
to watch a cartoon cutie slap
her hand over her face in the
last frame of every issue,
though that trend has recently
subsided.
But it's really insulting when
a cartoonist naively exploits
popular viewpoints in a feeble
attempt to gain popularity.
Theoretically, it's great to
see current issues being rep
resented in Daily strips. But
when a cartoonist crosses the
line into the realm of editoriali
zation, he or she must assume
the accompanying respon
sibilities.
Subtlety?
First, the cartoonist's point is
most effective if the issue is
handled artfully, and with
some degree of subtlety.
(Rood's punchline in this strip
is about as subtle as nuclear
warfare.)
But above all, the cartoonist
assumes the burden of being
informed about the issue in
question. Nobody likes a
bandwagon jumper, especially
over our morning Wheaties.
In the May 25 strip, we find
laughable, lovable Oh Ned and
her buddies attending a draft
debate. The comments floating
from the stage bear no re
semblance whatsoever to Rep.
Pete McCloskey's (R-Menlo
Park), actual conviction. The
"quote" in the third frame
states, "I can't sleep at night
knowing our armed force con
sists mainly of minorities."
KKK clothes
Following this statement, Oh
Ned is seen drifting into re

veries of McCloskey in KKK
garb, overseeing the hanging
of some minority individual,
with the cryptic slogan ROOTS
lurking beneath the grass.
Deep, eh?
We, the incensed letter writ
ers, stand heartily opposed to
the draft. We are also dis
turbed bv McCloskey's prop
osal. However, anyone famil
iar with the congressman's re
cord over the past decade and
a half would bequiteconfident
that he is not, and has never
been, a racist.
McCloskey's objection to a
primarily minority army arises

from his concern that the bur
den of the casualties suffered
abroad would be shouldered
by those minority groups.
Regardless of one's stand on
the draft issue, this distinction
must be realized, and McClos
key's mindless attackers be
made responsible for their
mindless indictments.

Editor's note: Janine Rood has
decided not to submit any
more Oh Ned! cartoons.
