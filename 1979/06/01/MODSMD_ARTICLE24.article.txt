The Bella Vista
13451 Skyline Drive
Woodside
851-1229
Twisting up on Old La Honda
Road, right on Skyline Blvd.,
six and three quarter miles on
the left, you stumble upon the
Bella Vista Restaurant just
when you've given up hope of
ever finding it. It's not a large
place, a summer home, set
back against the trees.
The front door sticks slightly
and a fire burns in the lounge.
'Beautiful view,' the Bella Vista
has been named aptly. Seated
at our corner table, the valley
and bay stretched out at our
feet, framed by tall trees.
Changing from yellow daylight
to pink twilight and then twink
ling evening lights, you can
lose yourself in the view and
settle back to enjoy a pleasant
evening with a good friend.
The menu is simple, the
plaid-shirted waiters attentive.
Seafood entrees include
Halibut ($10), Salmon ($10),
Abalone ($11.50) and Scalone.

a mixture of ground abalone
and scallops formed into pat
ties and fried ($8.75). A range of
steaks from Filet Mignon ($l2)
to Prime Rib ($11), fill out the
menu with two chicken dishes
and Frog legs ($10) completing
the entree list.
Soup and salad as well as a
baked potato and vegetable
are included as part of the price
of the entree guaranteeing that
the dinerwill not leave hungry.
Fresh sour dough bread and
sliced salami started out the
meal. Following closely was a
tasty romaine salad topped with
little Bay shrimp and a good
house dressing. Choice of
soups, Mock Turtle, Mines
trone and onion, followed the
salad. The soup was the
weakest part of the meal and
could easily be skipped.
A good sized New York steak
($11) was cooked exactly to
order and surrounded by crisp
buttered peas and a large
baked potato. A generous
amount of fresh sour cream

and sweet butter which came
along with the entree made for
a baked potato lovers dream.
My enterprising dinner com
panion settled upon the Frogs
Legs, a first time dining experi
ence for both of us. Looking
exactly like a long-leggsd
jumping frog, the meat was de
licately flavored and seasoned
with a touch of garlic.
Although a little chewy, the
meat of the frog was tasty, and
well-prepared, definitely
worth ordering at the Bella
Vista. For those who like more
traditional offerings, Chicken
Saute Sec ($7.75) and Pan-Fried
Chicken ($7.25) were also av
ailable.
Finishing our wine, the lights
had begun to flicker below u's.
Coffee and dessert rounded
off the meal. The cheesecake
($1.50) was delicious but unfor
tunately they had run out ot
Dynamite Mousse ($1.5(1) ■
The Bella Vista has a colorful
history going back to the '20s
and Prohibition. Tucked away
in the woods, the proprietor
would serve home-made wine
to thirsty patrons. The wood
paneled restaurant has a dedi
cated clientele but there, is al
ways some one new, according
to Hogan. Relying mainly on
word-of-mouth advertising,
the Bella Vista is doing well and
reservations are recom
mended even on week-nights\
Closed Mondays, the restaur
ant is open until 10 p.m. and
thecocktail lounge until 2 a.m;
The Bella Vista is worth £
trek, gas shortage not>-
withstanding, for a special
evening above it all in Woodr
side.

ling evening lights, you can
lose yourself in the view and
settle back to enjoy a pleasant
evening with a good friend.
The menu is simple, the
plaid-shirted waiters attentive.
Seafood entrees include
Halibut ($10), Salmon ($10),
Abalone ($11.50) and Scalone.

a mixture of ground abalone
and scallops formed into pat
ties and fried ($8.75). A range of
steaks from Filet Mignon ($l2)
to Prime Rib ($11), fill out the
menu with two chicken dishes
and Frog legs ($10) completing
the entree list.
Soup and salad as well as a
baked potato and vegetable
are included as part of the price
of the entree guaranteeing that
the dinerwill not leave hungry.
Fresh sour dough bread and
sliced salami started out the
meal. Following closely was a
tasty romaine salad topped with
little Bay shrimp and a good
house dressing. Choice of
soups, Mock Turtle, Mines
trone and onion, followed the
salad. The soup was the
weakest part of the meal and
could easily be skipped.
A good sized New York steak
($11) was cooked exactly to
order and surrounded by crisp
buttered peas and a large
baked potato. A generous
amount of fresh sour cream

and sweet butter which came
along with the entree made for
a baked potato lovers dream.
My enterprising dinner com
panion settled upon the Frogs
Legs, a first time dining experi
ence for both of us. Looking
exactly like a long-leggsd
jumping frog, the meat was de
licately flavored and seasoned
with a touch of garlic.
Although a little chewy, the
meat of the frog was tasty, and
well-prepared, definitely
worth ordering at the Bella
Vista. For those who like more
traditional offerings, Chicken
Saute Sec ($7.75) and Pan-Fried
Chicken ($7.25) were also av
ailable.
Finishing our wine, the lights
had begun to flicker below u's.
Coffee and dessert rounded
off the meal. The cheesecake
($1.50) was delicious but unfor
tunately they had run out ot
Dynamite Mousse ($1.5(1) ■
The Bella Vista has a colorful
history going back to the '20s
and Prohibition. Tucked away
in the woods, the proprietor
would serve home-made wine
to thirsty patrons. The wood
paneled restaurant has a dedi
cated clientele but there, is al
ways some one new, according
to Hogan. Relying mainly on
word-of-mouth advertising,
the Bella Vista is doing well and
reservations are recom
mended even on week-nights\
Closed Mondays, the restaur
ant is open until 10 p.m. and
thecocktail lounge until 2 a.m;
The Bella Vista is worth £
trek, gas shortage not>-
withstanding, for a special
evening above it all in Woodr
side.
