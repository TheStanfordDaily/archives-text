# History professors combine study with personal interest

Some scholars here may
seem to think only in terms
of "publish or perish,"
while others see their writ
ing and research as a labor
of love on a favorite subject.
History professors Estelle
Freedman and Paul Robin
son take different ap
proaches to studying their
field, yet both write about
interests close to their

hearts. Robinson is begin
ning to write a book about
the operas of composer
Verdi and their place in the
19th century; Freedmanwill
publish her research next
year on female prison re
forms and all-female crimi
nal institutions.
"I've loved opera since I
was a college student," said
Robinson. "At some point a
few years ago I realized that
what I had been preoc
cupied with — opera — I'd
make the focus of my re
search.
Robinson said he wants to
write more than a music his
tory — he wants to use Ver
di's operas as "cultural ar
tifacts" that can highlight
European ideas and intellec
tual currents of the late 18th
and 19th centuries.
"The point is to see how
things hang together in a
given period of time," he
explained. "I'm looking at
these operas against a
background of culture and
trying to find their affinities
with the art or the literature
or the politics of the time.
"Part of writing the book
is just sitting down and lis
tening," Robinson con
tinued. "The operas them
selves suggest possible

connections with things I
can read about in the litera
ture.
Robinson said Verdi
composed his first operas
while the Italian states were
being reunified. Much of
Europe was in revolution
and Karl Marx was writing of
class conflict.
"Verdi was concerned
about the meaning of na
tional revolution and about
the individual being
swamped in the group,"
Robinson said.
The second section of
Robinson's book, "The
Oedipal Drama," analyzes
the middle-period Verdi
operas which have themes
of family problems.
"These operas articulate
the agonies and gratifica
tions of family life," he
explained. 'They're all
about the tragedy of unre
strained parental love and
unrestrained protective
ness. Typically there's a
lovely duet between a father
and daughter, or mother
and son."
Although Verdi's last
operas are his greatest,
Robinson said they are also
the most difficult to place in
his history of ideas.
"It's easy to locate the is
sues in Verdi's early career,
but later on he's not so easy
to tag. Like all great men,
he's no longer provincial
and tied to an age."
Robinson warns that
"making an object of scho
larship something you love
can be dangerous."
"If you're not careful (all
your scholarship) can de
hydrate things and take the
charm out of them," he
said.
While Robinson writes
away in his apartment,
Freedman searches through
the dank basements of 100-
year-old prisons. Her
studies of the women who
wanted to reform all-female
prisons will be published
next year in Their Sister's
Keepers.
Freedman, an active
feminist, began her re
search as a Ph.D. thesis in
1973. At that time the gov
ernment had just begun re
integrating men's and wo
men's prisons after more
than a century of separa
tion. Several law students
looking at the equal rights

implications of the move
asked Freedman about the
history of the women's
prison system. Learning that
little was known on this sub
ject, she began her own re
search.
Freedman looked at
diaries of inmates, refor
mers' magazine articles and
public speeches and actual
prison records to find out
how female criminals were
treated and who the women
were who wanted to reform
the system.
At the Framingham, Mas
sachusetts prison Freedman
met an elderly librarian who
knew of some old ledger
books kept in the prison
basement which had case
histories of every prisoner
since the building's open
ing. Freeman recalls the lib
rarian telling her, "You
don't want to look at them
— they're so old and dusty."
"Well, I looked at them
and they were a goldmine!"
she said.
Using computers to re
duce the bulk of the data,
Freedman learned that in
the late 19th and early 20th
centuries most women
were convicted for either
"crimes against public or
der" or "crimes against
chastity."

"However, men were
seen as the root of the wo
men's crimes," Freedman
said.
To reform these "fallen
women" the female war
dens sought a "domestic
model" prison, a family en
vironment geared toward
promoting such values as
domesticity and mother
hood. Many of these wo
men's prisons often had
nurseries, said Freedman.
