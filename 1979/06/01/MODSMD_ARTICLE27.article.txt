# Should Cowell start an abortion service?

### Carlin Chrisman 
"If Cowell had an abortion
service, and I needed one, I'd
definitely use it," said junior
Linda Peinecke, who partici
pated in an informal sampling
of students who were asked if
they thought an abortion ser
vice is needed at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center.
"I think there'd be a lot of
emotional and psychological
problems involved in having an
abortion, and I wouldn't feel
comfortable just going to a
doctor I didn't know," she con
tinued. "The fact that they al
ready have my medical re
cords, they know me, and the
support I'd anticipate from the
counselors would make an
abortion service worthwhile
for me."
Peinecke's response was
one of a diverse set of reactions
to the idea of an abortion ser
vice at Cowell. Convenience
and psychological support
were the two reasons most
often cited in favor of the idea.
"I'd go to Cowell because of
the convenience — I'd want to
take care of it as quickly and
reasonably as possible," said
senior Clenda Anderson. "I'd
just assumed Cowell would
have abortions. It makes a lot
of sense to have full health care
at Cowell — that's what a stu

dent health center should be
for."
Her words echoed the
philosophy of Maura Eastman,
assistant administrator at Cow
ell Student Health Center at
Berkeley, where abortions
have been available to regis
tered students for two years.
"We like to think we're lead
ers in health care," she said.
"We consider abortion a
necessary part of full health
coverage."
The abortion service at Ber
keley was begun in response to
student demand and the desire
of the health center to fully
meet the needs of the stu
dents.
"We feel this approach is bet
ter for continuity of care,"
explained Eastman. "This way a
counselor can follow through
the whole procedure with the
student, available at all times
when she may desire it. This is
more humanistic, less sterile
than outside referrals."
An abortion at Berkeley costs
$190, which is usually covered
in the student's health insur
ance policy as minor surgery.
Mar'on Bairos, psychologist
at Stanford's Cowell, de
scribed the current counseling
system for students who find
they are pregnant with an un
wanted child. "Once we know

the blood test is positive, we
begin discussing the woman's
alternatives," she said.
"If she wants an abortion, we
tell her of the options availa
ble: private doctors, clinics,
Planned Parenthood and Stan
ford Hospital. The woman can
make her appointment here,
from my office. After the abor
tion, we have follow-up coun
seling."
"The expense is handled in
different ways," continued
Bairos. "Abortions generally
cost $175 to $185 in this area. At
Planned Parenthood they are
$140."
According to Charlotte
Siegel, clinical social worker,
60 students each year are
counseled at Cowell for abor
tion. "I've discussed the idea
of having an abortion service at
Cowell with the director, Jim
McClenahan, but we haven't
felt there was a pressing need
togotothe expense," she said.
"I feel comfort and support
are the most important points.
Having an abortion isan impor
tant state, it's a decision
making time, a time for review.
The woman comes out a little
stronger after."
Siegel emphasized that
Cowell administrators are not
opposed to the idea of having
an abortion service, but that

they see a lack of urgency in
the matter.
"If there were no community
resources, I'd be ready to
move," she said, "but not as
things are. I don't think we
should close the door on the
issue though."
"Confidentiality is of the ut
most concern for many of the
women I counsel," affirmed
Siegel. "I doubt if you could
really accomplish it at Cowell.
I've had women who went to
San Francisco for their abor
tions to make certain no one
knew about it."
"I don't think abortion
should just be a treatment like
any other," said one woman.
"It shouldn't be a pedestrian
experience. But I believe that
women should have the
choice. If there were an
adequate demand I can see in
stituting an abortion service at
Cowell."
"On the whole I'd be in favor
of it," said a male student who
asked not to be identified. "I'd
be willing to pay a fee assess
ment to start an abortion ser
vice at Cowell. I don't think it
should be an alternative to
contraception, but women
shouldn't have to assume the
burden of pregnancy."
McClenahan explained
what the process would be for
instituting an abortion service
at Cowell. "We would need a
doctor to spend more time
here — we presently have one
part-time gynecologist," he
said. "We'd also need a vac
uum aspirator, but the physical
facilities wouldn't have to be
modified.
"I doubt if the cost would be
too high to start having abor
tions at Cowell, but I don't
think it could be absorbed in
Cowell's budget,"he said.
"In practice, the general
philosophy of the health ser
vice is not to pay for services
which apply to a small percen
tage of the students," he con
tinued. "For example, a stu
dent who needs allergy shots
has to pay for them individu
ally. You'd probably have to
have some kind of student
consensus to raise the initial
funds, and after that the cost
could be individually paid."
"Abortions aren't a part of
student health coverage now
because it's not like any other
medical procedure. It's more
controversial, more expensive,
and more complicated than,
for example, removing a wart.
For us, it's gotten down to a
matter of costs, and we don't
feel the cost would make it
worthwhile. Of course, it's har
der to determine the
psychological cost to the wo
man," McClenahan reflected.

doctor I didn't know," she con
tinued. "The fact that they al
ready have my medical re
cords, they know me, and the
support I'd anticipate from the
counselors would make an
abortion service worthwhile
for me."
Peinecke's response was
one of a diverse set of reactions
to the idea of an abortion ser
vice at Cowell. Convenience
and psychological support
were the two reasons most
often cited in favor of the idea.
"I'd go to Cowell because of
the convenience — I'd want to
take care of it as quickly and
reasonably as possible," said
senior Clenda Anderson. "I'd
just assumed Cowell would
have abortions. It makes a lot
of sense to have full health care
at Cowell — that's what a stu

dent health center should be
for."
Her words echoed the
philosophy of Maura Eastman,
assistant administrator at Cow
ell Student Health Center at
Berkeley, where abortions
have been available to regis
tered students for two years.
"We like to think we're lead
ers in health care," she said.
"We consider abortion a
necessary part of full health
coverage."
The abortion service at Ber
keley was begun in response to
student demand and the desire
of the health center to fully
meet the needs of the stu
dents.
"We feel this approach is bet
ter for continuity of care,"
explained Eastman. "This way a
counselor can follow through
the whole procedure with the
student, available at all times
when she may desire it. This is
more humanistic, less sterile
than outside referrals."
An abortion at Berkeley costs
$190, which is usually covered
in the student's health insur
ance policy as minor surgery.
Mar'on Bairos, psychologist
at Stanford's Cowell, de
scribed the current counseling
system for students who find
they are pregnant with an un
wanted child. "Once we know

the blood test is positive, we
begin discussing the woman's
alternatives," she said.
"If she wants an abortion, we
tell her of the options availa
ble: private doctors, clinics,
Planned Parenthood and Stan
ford Hospital. The woman can
make her appointment here,
from my office. After the abor
tion, we have follow-up coun
seling."
"The expense is handled in
different ways," continued
Bairos. "Abortions generally
cost $175 to $185 in this area. At
Planned Parenthood they are
$140."
According to Charlotte
Siegel, clinical social worker,
60 students each year are
counseled at Cowell for abor
tion. "I've discussed the idea
of having an abortion service at
Cowell with the director, Jim
McClenahan, but we haven't
felt there was a pressing need
togotothe expense," she said.
"I feel comfort and support
are the most important points.
Having an abortion isan impor
tant state, it's a decision
making time, a time for review.
The woman comes out a little
stronger after."
Siegel emphasized that
Cowell administrators are not
opposed to the idea of having
an abortion service, but that

they see a lack of urgency in
the matter.
"If there were no community
resources, I'd be ready to
move," she said, "but not as
things are. I don't think we
should close the door on the
issue though."
"Confidentiality is of the ut
most concern for many of the
women I counsel," affirmed
Siegel. "I doubt if you could
really accomplish it at Cowell.
I've had women who went to
San Francisco for their abor
tions to make certain no one
knew about it."
"I don't think abortion
should just be a treatment like
any other," said one woman.
"It shouldn't be a pedestrian
experience. But I believe that
women should have the
choice. If there were an
adequate demand I can see in
stituting an abortion service at
Cowell."
"On the whole I'd be in favor
of it," said a male student who
asked not to be identified. "I'd
be willing to pay a fee assess
ment to start an abortion ser
vice at Cowell. I don't think it
should be an alternative to
contraception, but women
shouldn't have to assume the
burden of pregnancy."
McClenahan explained
what the process would be for
instituting an abortion service
at Cowell. "We would need a
doctor to spend more time
here — we presently have one
part-time gynecologist," he
said. "We'd also need a vac
uum aspirator, but the physical
facilities wouldn't have to be
modified.
"I doubt if the cost would be
too high to start having abor
tions at Cowell, but I don't
think it could be absorbed in
Cowell's budget,"he said.
"In practice, the general
philosophy of the health ser
vice is not to pay for services
which apply to a small percen
tage of the students," he con
tinued. "For example, a stu
dent who needs allergy shots
has to pay for them individu
ally. You'd probably have to
have some kind of student
consensus to raise the initial
funds, and after that the cost
could be individually paid."
"Abortions aren't a part of
student health coverage now
because it's not like any other
medical procedure. It's more
controversial, more expensive,
and more complicated than,
for example, removing a wart.
For us, it's gotten down to a
matter of costs, and we don't
feel the cost would make it
worthwhile. Of course, it's har
der to determine the
psychological cost to the wo
man," McClenahan reflected.
"If Cowell had an abortion
service, and I needed one, I'd
definitely use it," said junior
Linda Peinecke, who partici
pated in an informal sampling
of students who were asked if
they thought an abortion ser
vice is needed at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center.
"I think there'd be a lot of
emotional and psychological
problems involved in having an
abortion, and I wouldn't feel
comfortable just going to a
doctor I didn't know," she con
tinued. "The fact that they al
ready have my medical re
