"The scholarship awards are generous and
prestigious. They enable people who would not
usually do overseas studies or research to do so.
The experience is a compliment to anyone's
studies or work.''
Marcia Makino, fellowship adviser at the
Bechtel International Center, recently discus
sed opportunities tor overseas graduate study.
Applications tor the 1980 Fulbright-Hayes,
Churchill, Marshall and Rhodes Scholarships
are now available at the Overseas Resource
Center in Bechtel. Of the four programs, the
Fulbright grant offers the broadest selection of
host countries; students have their choice of
studying in 50 nations from Argentina to Zaire.
"One does not need to have been overseas to
qualify for these scholarships. One need only
fulfill the basic qualifications," Makino said.
Applicants must be U.S. citizens who hold a
bachelor's degree or equivalent and who have a
proficiency in the language of the host country.
Awards range from full grants, which cover all
expenses, to grants which cover only the costs
of transportation overseas.
"I encourage people to begin applying now
rather than wait until September to avoid the
rush to get letters of recommendation, trans
cripts, language certificates and counseling,"
said Makino.
Established under the Mutual Education and
Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, the purpose of
the Fulbright grants is to increase mutual under
standing between the people of the United
States and other countries through student ex
change and transfer of knowledge and skills.

The grants allow for nine months of graduate
study or independent academic research ab
road. They may also be used for professional
training overseas in the creative and performing
arts.
So far this year 11 of the 57 Stanford applicants
have already been accepted for the 1979-80 Ful
bright program.
"This is probably because we promote the
program more, and the students here are
perhaps more internationally oriented than at
other colleges," said Lee Ziegler, director of
Bechtel. "We are traditionally strong."
Most Fulbright scholars are involved in
humanities and social science fields, but many
grants are also available for math, science and
technology, Makino said. The 1978-79 Stanford
awardees are now studying applied physics in
Yugoslavia, anthropology in Spain, plant
physiology in Germany, law in Italy and com
munications in Mexico.
Students may also pick up applications for
Rhodes, Marshall and Churchill scholarships
which fund a year of study in the United King
dom. The Rhodes scholarship is for the Univer
sity of Oxford while the Marshall award can be
used at any university in Great Britain or North
ern Ireland. Stanford applicants will compete
with others from the western region for four
Marshall and four Rhodes Scholarships.
The Churchill Foundation scholarships are for
the study of engineering, mathematics and sci
ence at Churchill College, Cambridge Univer
sity. "All these scholarships are based on merit
rather than on financial need," Makino em
phasized.
