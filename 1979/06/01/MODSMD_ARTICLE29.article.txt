# Fieldman's school held here
## College Republicans active 
### Dianne Cahoon Senior staff writer 
Foregoing the normal
Memorial Day weekend plea
sures of casually languishing in
the sun or busily pursuing
more erudite undertakings in
the library, seven Stanford stu
dents cloistered themselves
for two and a half days in a
niche in the Business School to
study the art of political per
suasion.
The occasion was a Califor
nia student Fieldman school,
run by members of the College
Republican National Commit
tee (CRNC) and sponsored by
the Stanford College Republi
cans. Twenty-five students
from around the state learned
the techniques involved in or
ganizing a youth campaign,
from "Recruitment" to "Rais
ing the Bucks" to "Election Day
Activities."
The concept of a Fieldman's
school for college students was
formalized around 1970 and is
constantly evolving, according
to program director and CRNC
Vice-Chairman Frank Lavin.
"It was one of the things that
got me in (to College Republi
cans)," Lavin said. "I was so
overwhelmed by the energy
and the techniques employed.
People really get gung-ho into

(the project aspect ot the train
ing)."
Lavin, who delivered five
wide-ranging lectures at the
school, exemplifies the truly
dedicated political animal.
A senior International Poli
tics major at the Georgetown
School of Foreign Service, he
admitted that "I was active in
Teenage Republicans before I
knew I was a Republican." He
said he chose College Republi
cans (CRs) because "I wanted
an organization with impact;
one that did things." A desire
to attend the 1972 Republican
National Convention in Miami
also influenced his decision
somewhat, he said.
Since that formulative state,
Lavin has served in diverse
functions. He was president of
the Georgetown CRs, state
executive director of the Dis
trict of Columbia CR founda
tion, editor of the CR national
newsletter, a five-state reg
ional CR director and national
executive director of the CRs.
He has also worked as a coor
dinator for several national
campaigns.
As a member of the U.S.
Youth Council, he has met with
student exchange organiza
tions abroad and presented
CRs to international groups, as
well as hosting visiting foreign

delegations.
This year he has been par
ticularly active, he said. He has
contributed to about 10
Fieldman schools and travelled
to 19 different states.
Heannounced his candidacy
for the next two-year term as
National Chairman on Feb. 10.
Although he is unopposed for
the election later this month in
Washington, D.C., his cam
paign expenses have totalled
$15,000 so far.
He outlined his three main
objectives as national chair
man: 1) to expand the current
30,000-member, 600-chapter
CR organization to encapsulate
more of the country's 11 mill
ion students on 3100 cam
puses; 2) to improve CR public
relations, so that "people
know who we are"; and 3) "to
get outside financing for our
limited budget."
After completing his term of
office, Lavin said he hopes to
leave the country as a member
of the diplomatic corps and to
someday hold elective office.
Stanford CR president Rob
Kinsey classified the Fieldman
school as "a good experience
to meet with CRs from around
the state and a chance to gain
new understanding and in
sights into political cam
paigns."


Cherubic anticipation
Three tots anxiously await the clown parade which marks a highlight of the Pickle Family Circus. The
Circus will play a benefit performance here this weekend for child care facilities, with circus tents going
up today on the playing fields near El Camino. The clown parade will begin tomorrow at 11 a.m. with
children invited to join up in costume. Tickets for the shows are $3 for adults and $1.50 for children at the
gate. Beneficiaries will be the Children's Center of the Stanford Community, the Escondido Nursery
