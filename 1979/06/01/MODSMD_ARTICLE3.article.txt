# ARLO students push container recycling
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stores now label food packages with unit prices,
ingredients and nutritional value to accomodate
increasing consumer awareness. But what about
the container itself? Until recently, little effort was
made to tell consumers how to recycle the pac
kages.
Thanks to the efforts of four students here in
volved in an Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) project this quarter, that neglect is being
attended to —and the results can be seen at the
Co-op Market on California Ave. in Palo Alto.
Besides an introductory sign near the store's
entrance, there are now individual labels where
soft drinks, beer and wine are located. The labels
separate containers into reusable, recyclable and
non-recyclable categories.
The actual labels consist of color-coded versions
of the familiar "recycle" logo—a circle of in
tertwining arrows. A green label indicates "good"
containers, yellow symbolizes "0.k.," and red
with a slash through the emblem means a non
reusable container.
The project originated last quarter as part of a
SWOPSI course on solid waste problems and solu
tions. The basic planning for the Co-op project
began during that class, but it was implemented by
Julie )omo, Matt Winston, Charlie Segerstrom and
Katy Swaim last Saturday. Bob Wenzlau of the Palo
Alto Recycling Center, who was an instructor in
the SWOPSI course along with Swaim, has also
continued work on the project.

Reusable packages are the most desirable, since
they usually are the least energy-intensive to put
back into the stores. Returnable bottles are exam
ples of this container category.
Depleted resources
Recyclable containers use more energy before
they return to the shelves, but are still making
rapidly depleted resources work repeatedly, as
with aluminum drink cans, tin cans or thin "one
way" glass bottles.
Containers which are discouraged in the prog
ram are plastic, paper or bimetal (i.e. aluminum
steel cans), since they are not readily suitable for
reuse.
Response to the project from both the Co-op
management arid the product buyers for the chain
has been positive, according to Swaim.
"The program has been received very favora
bly," she said. "The buyers told us that they will try
to evolve their marketing program (to stress reuse
and recycling as much as possible). They're with us
all the way."
Other Co-op branches
"Co-op does really well in stocking reusable
containers," she noted. Swaim explained that the
student group hopes to spread the recycling ef
forts throughout the store and to five other Co-op
branches in the Palo Alto area by the end of June.
With assistance from the city of Berkeley Recycling
Center public awareness personnel, seven Co-op
stores there may also join the list.
Getting the project to work in Safeway stores

would be "a dream," she added.
The project has already received exposure in the
Bay Area, including a three-minute spot, which
was repeated every day for one week by KCBS, a
San Francisco news format radio station, and also
appeared on the Friday evening news of Channel
4, the local CBS affiliate.
Consumer awareness
Coordinating informational activities with the
Palo Alto Recycling Center, the students hope to
increase consumer awareness on the topic, espe
cially illustrating that reuse of containers is not
only sensible environmentally, but also economi
cally, since recycling lowers material, labor and
energy costs. A preliminary survey conducted by
the ARLO group indicates a current low public
awareness.
"We learned that people don't think of the pac
kages when they buy," Swaim said. However,
given incentives for recycling, that attitude can
change, she explained. To further their survey
work, the Stanford Center for Innovation in Re
search and Education (SCIRE) is funding computer
tabulation.
As one of the newly-appointed project mana
gers of the ASSU Recycling Center, Swaim will
represent the University on the Santa Clara
County Recyclers, aiding recycling efforts around
the county. Combining her Co-op and ASSU pro
ject interests, Swaim also hopes to implement a
consumer program in The Store at Tresidder Un
ion.

the county. Combining her Co-op and ASSU pro
ject interests, Swaim also hopes to implement a
consumer program in The Store at Tresidder Un
ion.
Stores now label food packages with unit prices,
ingredients and nutritional value to accomodate
increasing consumer awareness. But what about
the container itself? Until recently, little effort was
made to tell consumers how to recycle the pac
kages.
Thanks to the efforts of four students here in
volved in an Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) project this quarter, that neglect is being
attended to —and the results can be seen at the
Co-op Market on California Ave. in Palo Alto.
Besides an introductory sign near the store's
entrance, there are now individual labels where
soft drinks, beer and wine are located. The labels
separate containers into reusable, recyclable and
non-recyclable categories.
The actual labels consist of color-coded versions
of the familiar "recycle" logo—a circle of in
tertwining arrows. A green label indicates "good"
containers, yellow symbolizes "0.k.," and red
with a slash through the emblem means a non
reusable container.
The project originated last quarter as part of a
SWOPSI course on solid waste problems and solu
tions. The basic planning for the Co-op project
began during that class, but it was implemented by
Julie )omo, Matt Winston, Charlie Segerstrom and
Katy Swaim last Saturday. Bob Wenzlau of the Palo
Alto Recycling Center, who was an instructor in
the SWOPSI course along with Swaim, has also
continued work on the project.

Reusable packages are the most desirable, since
they usually are the least energy-intensive to put
back into the stores. Returnable bottles are exam
ples of this container category.
Depleted resources
Recyclable containers use more energy before
they return to the shelves, but are still making
rapidly depleted resources work repeatedly, as
with aluminum drink cans, tin cans or thin "one
way" glass bottles.
Containers which are discouraged in the prog
ram are plastic, paper or bimetal (i.e. aluminum
steel cans), since they are not readily suitable for
reuse.
Response to the project from both the Co-op
management arid the product buyers for the chain
has been positive, according to Swaim.
"The program has been received very favora
bly," she said. "The buyers told us that they will try
to evolve their marketing program (to stress reuse
and recycling as much as possible). They're with us
all the way."
Other Co-op branches
"Co-op does really well in stocking reusable
containers," she noted. Swaim explained that the
student group hopes to spread the recycling ef
forts throughout the store and to five other Co-op
branches in the Palo Alto area by the end of June.
With assistance from the city of Berkeley Recycling
Center public awareness personnel, seven Co-op
stores there may also join the list.
Getting the project to work in Safeway stores

would be "a dream," she added.
The project has already received exposure in the
Bay Area, including a three-minute spot, which
was repeated every day for one week by KCBS, a
San Francisco news format radio station, and also
appeared on the Friday evening news of Channel
4, the local CBS affiliate.
Consumer awareness
Coordinating informational activities with the
Palo Alto Recycling Center, the students hope to
increase consumer awareness on the topic, espe
cially illustrating that reuse of containers is not
only sensible environmentally, but also economi
cally, since recycling lowers material, labor and
energy costs. A preliminary survey conducted by
the ARLO group indicates a current low public
awareness.
"We learned that people don't think of the pac
kages when they buy," Swaim said. However,
given incentives for recycling, that attitude can
change, she explained. To further their survey
work, the Stanford Center for Innovation in Re
search and Education (SCIRE) is funding computer
tabulation.
As one of the newly-appointed project mana
gers of the ASSU Recycling Center, Swaim will
represent the University on the Santa Clara
County Recyclers, aiding recycling efforts around
the county. Combining her Co-op and ASSU pro
ject interests, Swaim also hopes to implement a
consumer program in The Store at Tresidder Un
ion.
