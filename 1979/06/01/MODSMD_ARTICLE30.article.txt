# What will be the effects?
## Carter's oil decontrol begins today 
### 
Washington (AP) — Oil de
control. Is it a statistician's
shell game? A businessman's
boon? A poor person's poison?
Today, Americans start to find
out as the Carter administra
tion begins to lift the govern
ment's price ceilings on
domestic oil. The phase-out
will take more than two years.
The Energy Department says
decontrol may boost the aver
age price of domestic oil $5 per
barrel by next year, but a con
sumer group says the rise will
be more like $45.
And this is only one of the
controversies marking the new
era.
Supporters argue that de
control will cut demand for oil,
stimulate exploration and pro
duction, improve the balance
of payments, and diminish de
pendence on oil imports.
Opponents charge that de
control will punish low-income
Americans, feed inflation, in
crease unemployment, slow
economic growth, make the oil
companies richer, and make
Americans even more vulnera
ble to the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
What is known is that today
newly discovered oil—below
$10 per barrel under
controls—will go up to
world-market prices, nearing
$15 per barrel now. Oil from
existing wells—and controls
on these were complicated—
will rise slightly each month
until it also is at world-market
prices.
Will cut demand
No one disputes that higher
oil prices will cool demand. But
there is disagreement over
how much and whether even
the most optimistic prediction
makes decontrol economical.
President Jimmy Carter says
the increase in oil prices would
cut demand by as much as
290,000 barrels a day in 1985.
The Congressional Budget Of
fice says it's only 210,000 bar
rels.
But even 290,000 barrels rep
resent only 1.6 percent of
1985's expected daily con
sumption. That's so small itcan
be achieved through mandat
ory thermostat settings, says
Lee White of the citizen
lobby group Consumer Energy
Council of America.
Many economists doubt
demand for gasoline, diesel
fuel and heating oil is very re
sponsive to price because
these are necessities. Since
1972, heating oil prices rose
nearly 200 percent; consump

tion was up 17 percent. Gas
prices more than doubled, yet
demand rose 16 percent.
Energy Dept. officials argue
that demand would have been
even higher without increases.
They say, too, higher prices
can hasten the "threshold"
where consumers may finally
alter buying habits.
Stimulates oil supply
In recent years, domestic
crude production has fallen
about 10 percent, while addi
tions to petroleum reserves
have fallen even more steeply,
the oil industry's American Pet
roleum Institute reports.
It blames much of the de
cline on prices that are low and
don't justify the cost of explor
ing and developing scarce
domestic oil.
Lifting price controls, the
Energy Dept. says, will stimu
late production of 740,000 to
840,000 more barrels of crude
daily in 1985; the Congres
sional Budget Office puts that
figure at 405,000 barrels.
While any increase should
help meet rising demand, op
ponents wonder if the extra oil
is worth the price. Says James
Flug of the consumer lobby
Energy Action: "If you are sel

ling me 10 barrels of oil at $10 a
barrel, and I want an extra bar
rel, and you . . . won't provide
that eleventh barrel unless I
payyou $12 per barrel forall 11
barrels . . . the real cost of the
eleventh barrel is $32, not $12."
Aids balance of payments
The Energy Dept. says de
control should improve the
U.S. balance of payments by
$1.5 billion next year and $13
billion in 1985 because greater
domestic production should
cut imports, if demand doesn't
increase too rapidly. Few de
control opponents reject this,
but they question whether the
benefit outweighs decontrol's
disadvantages.
Decontrol feeds inflation
The administration projects
that Carter's decontrol plan
will boost inflation 0.6 to 0.9
percent by 1983, depending on
the level of OPEC prices. Con
gress' budget office agrees
with that analysis.
But there's a hitch: Both as
sume OPEC prices will rise 3
percent faster than U.S. infla
tion. Since Iran's revolution,
however, OPEC prices have
risen about 25 percent — dou
ble the inflation rate.
The Carter administration says

decontrol will add about $100 a
year to the average expense of
a family of four, including in
creases for gasoline, heating
oil, and other oil-based goods.
The Congressional Budget Of
fice predicts the actual cost will
be closer to $175.
Both projections are based
on OPEC prices rising far
slower than at present, which
could mean even the $175 es
timate is too low.
