Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a neces
sary one. Here, Allen begins to
deal with the problems he so
completely solves in his latest
movie, the brilliant Manhattan.
This schematic, tragic story of a
family in crisis is purposefully
sterile; Woody forces himself to
repress his comic side; what re
sults is painful, uneven — yet of
ten, somehow, brilliant.
Woody's errors here are those
of a man who's more than a little
unsure of himself; he overplays
obvious symbolism, and his at
tempts for Bergmanesque
touches are, more often than
not, flaccid imitations. Yet
Woody coaxes great perfor
mances from a superb ensemble
cast, and Maureen Stapleton lit
erally stands out as the only per
son to bringcolorand vibrancy to
the otherwise pale and lifeless
family in the film.

Guild, Menlo Park
Grease is fairly inoffensive, and
I suppose it is possible to have a
very good time at it. But can t we
demand a little bit better than this
kind of calculated entertainment,
presold like one would sell
Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by
Donner last year than I did watch
ing the movie; at least the people
in Donner appeared to be enjoy
ing themselves.
Grease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feeling
must please some people, and
while Grease is hardly a good
movie, sensations like that help
make it the ultimate in pacitiers.

Four people involved in a

directed this phenomenal study
of the relativity of the"truth."
The end result may be viewed in
one of two ways: all people are

One of last year's most promis

its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) pulls off one or two nice
scenes but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow of all is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part

Very wry. Like a Thufber story

it must continually o.utwit its au
dience. _ : ,
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and

through the picture with obsti

Battlestar Galactica

There's no way this movie
cou Id be better than TV — it is TV,

Battlestar Calactica's premiere
episode may have been blown up
to big-screen size, but all of its
little-screen ideas have been left
intact. Even on television this
program was sadly lacking in in
terest; in their efforts to out-do
Star Wars' special effects, the
people at ABC forgot to include
any characters worth watching.
The only interesting quirk was
the casting of Lome Greene as
the leader of the space clan: he
carries American imperialism
from the old west of Bonanza to
the wide-open spaces between
planets. j

Foul Play * *
Guild, Menlo Park
This movie entertains you, all
right; but it's entertainment by
the numbers. Colin Higgins
wrote and directed this piece of
cloned Hitchcock; he relies on
his stars and his big, dumb music
to get by. Thank God one of his
stars is Goldie Hawn. She gets a
chance to strut here, and in this
movie she's a gem lying amongst
the ordinary. Featuring the
California coastline, San Fran

and change is in the air: the girls J
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para

necessarily obscures the subject

This superb thriller, which uses

excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per

high gear even when the direc

In the end, an emotionally mov

Not a great movie, but for

of a man who's more than a little

Grease is fairly inoffensive, and

I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by

in Donner appeared to be enjoy

Grease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its

by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a

must please some people, and

Sunday, Mem Aud
Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a neces
sary one. Here, Allen begins to
deal with the problems he so
completely solves in his latest
movie, the brilliant Manhattan.
This schematic, tragic story of a
family in crisis is purposefully
sterile; Woody forces himself to
repress his comic side; what re
sults is painful, uneven — yet of
ten, somehow, brilliant.
Woody's errors here are those
of a man who's more than a little
unsure of himself; he overplays
obvious symbolism, and his at
tempts for Bergmanesque
touches are, more often than
not, flaccid imitations. Yet
Woody coaxes great perfor
mances from a superb ensemble
cast, and Maureen Stapleton lit
erally stands out as the only per
son to bringcolorand vibrancy to

family in the film.

ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat and
Wizards) pulls off one or two nice
scenes but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with
crudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow of all is the film's ending:
after more than two hours we are
informed that this is merely Part
I _ come back in a year or so for
more details. (1978)

Heaven Can Wait ★★★★
Biograph, Palo Alto
Very wry. Like a Thufber story
without the brte. Dependant for
its success upon machinations of
the plot,that come; totally out of
the biue — if the movie is to work
it must continually o.utwit its au
dience. _ : ,
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistance and a stubborn
sense that he's been
(Strange as it sounds, h«'s good
at ttiis, pnd his efforts are sup

Battlestar Galactica
Park, Menlo Park
There's no way this movie
cou Id be better than TV — it is TV,
a pilot episode, to be exact.
Battlestar Calactica's premiere
episode may have been blown up
to big-screen size, but all of its
little-screen ideas have been left
intact. Even on television this
program was sadly lacking in in
terest; in their efforts to out-do
Star Wars' special effects, the
people at ABC forgot to include
any characters worth watching.
The only interesting quirk was
the casting of Lome Greene as
the leader of the space clan: he
carries American imperialism
from the old west of Bonanza to
the wide-open spaces between
planets. j

Foul Play * *
Guild, Menlo Park
This movie entertains you, all
right; but it's entertainment by
the numbers. Colin Higgins
wrote and directed this piece of
cloned Hitchcock; he relies on
his stars and his big, dumb music
to get by. Thank God one of his
stars is Goldie Hawn. She gets a
chance to strut here, and in this
movie she's a gem lying amongst
the ordinary. Featuring the
California coastline, San Fran
cisco and, oh yes, Chevy Chase.

Picnic at Hanging Rock ** * i
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine, ,
atmospheric tale about four j
schoolgirls who disappear on a ,
field trip to the hanging rock i
natural formation in Australia. J
The date is Valentine's Day, IWO, i
and change is in the air: the girls J
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
jane Fonda and lack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and
straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, lames Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how vou take
its politics. r l

(1978) Set in 1968, Coming
Home is a drama about people at

undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi

for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel

Sunday, Mem Aud
Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a neces
sary one. Here, Allen begins to
deal with the problems he so
completely solves in his latest
movie, the brilliant Manhattan.
This schematic, tragic story of a
family in crisis is purposefully
sterile; Woody forces himself to
repress his comic side; what re
sults is painful, uneven — yet of
ten, somehow, brilliant.
Woody's errors here are those
of a man who's more than a little
unsure of himself; he overplays
obvious symbolism, and his at
tempts for Bergmanesque
touches are, more often than
not, flaccid imitations. Yet
Woody coaxes great perfor
mances from a superb ensemble
cast, and Maureen Stapleton lit
erally stands out as the only per
son to bringcolorand vibrancy to
the otherwise pale and lifeless
family in the film.

Grease *
Guild, Menlo Park
Grease is fairly inoffensive, and
I suppose it is possible to have a
very good time at it. But can t we
demand a little bit better than this
kind of calculated entertainment,
presold like one would sell
Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by
Donner last year than I did watch
ing the movie; at least the people
in Donner appeared to be enjoy
ing themselves.
Grease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feeling
must please some people, and
while Grease is hardly a good
movie, sensations like that help
make it the ultimate in pacitiers.

Harold and Maude ★ * *
Biograph, Palo Alto
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodriess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Gordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack

Manhattan * ★ * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photography
by Cordon Willis. Music by
George Gershwin.

\orma Rae * * * *
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile mill where she works.
Saiiy Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
—I.M.

Alien ★ * * *
Northpoint, San Francisco
Ridley Scott directed this
nightmarish science-fiction
movie about a crew of a space
craft menaced by an alien with a
penchant for human flesh. Alien
is essentially a bug-eyed monster
movie from the '50s brought up
to date; under Scott's direction,
however, it has a punch and wit
that hits even the most skeptical
viewer right between the eyes.
Alien isthebestthrillerwe'vehad

long special effects finale is a
sure-fire audience pleaser. The
seven-member cast includes
Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver,
and Veronica Cartwright.

The Godfather * # * *
Saturday, Cubberley
The greatest gangster movie
ever made, but it's a lot more
than that in the end. Writer
director Francis Ford Coppola
takes Mario Puzo's epic, pulpy
book and dares to take chances
with it. That is, he accepts the
book's dimensions and its tone
and comes up with something
greater than anyone (except
Coppola?) expected: a big, juicy,
lustful and violent look at the

The Deer Hunter
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's also among the best
war movies ever made. Very little
of the "tell 'em I died for Betty"
bullshit that John Wayne types
keep croaking on the shores of
Iwo Jima; the movie puts you
face to face with the horror of the
thing.
The actors rise over the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies —
they make sure that we hardly
ever notice. In the picture's cent
ral performance, Robert De Niro
is starkly individualistic in much
the same way that he has been
starkly individualistic in practi
cally everything else he's made —
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen — sometimes unbelieva
bly wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays
an attempt at pxcavation.

criminal subculture in America.
Marlon Brando fills his cheeks
with orange peels and talks in a
tired, beaten, worldwise voice;
the film revolves around his
compelling presence as the Cod
father. Al Pacino, lames Caan,
Diane Keaton, the late |ohn
Cazale and Talia Shire became
famous through their supporting
roles; you're attracted and repel
led by all of them. Three hours of
flashy, lurid excitement made by
a writer-director whose sense of
flashiness and luridness (as well
as just about every other impor
tant movie sense) is just about
the best around.

If you liked the book by Sports

terested in about 10 too many
things, and this movie often ap
pears to be falling apart, but Burt
Reynolds does an amazing fake
Cary Grant impression and
camps his way through — saving
the movie. With )ill Clayburgh

Four people involved in a
rape-murder give their accounts
of what happened; each one's
story differs, but each story may
be equally true. Akira Kurosawa
directed this phenomenal study
of the relativity of the"truth."
The end result may be viewed in
one of two ways: all people are
liars, or all people are honest, in
their own fashion. Toshiro
Mifune is a member of the super
lative cast. In Japanese, with sub
titles. (1951)
