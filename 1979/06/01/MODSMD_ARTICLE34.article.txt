# Spring football deemed a success
## Dowhower looks at individuals 
### Robert Reed 
•\ tew players couldn't make
it because they were running
track. Some others couldn't be
there because they were in
jured. One guy on the team
was injured while he was out
running track. And another
was ineligible because of
academic problems. Yet, all
things considered, new Head
Football Coach Rod
Dowhower has termed his
team's spring practice a suc
cess.
Dowhower said that practice
"was successful, mainly be
cause we found out about
some individuals—which is
what we set out to do."
Another reason Dowhower
felt spring practice was a suc
cess was because his staff was
able to "technically" improve
the offensive line.
"Over the course of spring
practice, what we were trying
to do was refine our
techniques," Dowhower
explained.
Dowhower said that tackles
Brian Holloway and Andre
Hines both showed improve
ment, as did returning starting
guard Paul Hibler, along with
Mike Neill and Charles Bed
lord.
"We feel good about offen
sive line in general,"
Dowhower said.
But the offensive line was
not plagued by injuries as were
other positions.

"The coordination of the in
side linebackers with the out
side linebackers and the down
linemen was an important as
pect of this spring,"
Dowhower said.
At running back, with Darrin
Nelson injured seriously and
Jim Brown being knocked out
of spring practice by a knee st
rain, positions were filled by
players who hadn't played be
fore.
But what about Nelson? Will
he return this fall?
"Medically, the operation
was a success," Dowhower
said. "Athletically speaking, I
don't think we will know any
thing until August."
He explained that'there will
be a long rehabilitation pro
cess ahead of Nelson. How
ever, he was optimistic.
Steve Budinger, at inside
linebacker, is already aware
that his comeback year won't
come this fall, as he will just be
learning how to run again
when practice resumes in Au
gust. And Tom Hall, who was
moved from outside to inside
linebacker just hours before he
suffered his injury, will also
have a long road back.
With the loss of Robbie
Chapman who is academically
ineligible, the Cards were left
with a big hole in the secon
dary, and have done some
juggling. MovedMo free safety
now is Steve Foley, while
strong safety was tried on by

Rick Cervais.
"(Gervais) is very quick, he's
very good on run support, and
will provide us with something
at strong safety we haven't
had—speed," Dowhower
explained.
Vet, despite the absence of
these and other players,
Dowhower's staff tried not to
make any special allowances
for their loss during spring
practice.
"We worked very hard not to
change anything," Dowhower
said. He explained that spring
practice allows the team to ex
periment, to do some things
they wouldn't normally do,
while becoming closer knit,
gaining a little respect for each
other, and developing the skill
level needed for the Cards'
sophisticated style of play.
Dowhower said the outside
linebacker position, with Milt
McColl, Kevin Bates, and Terry
Rennaker, along with chal
lenger Jay Summers, is a
strength of the club.
"Overall on defense, we just
need to take one more step in
the fall," Dowhower main
tained. He said the defense just
needs to tighten up.
Despite the apparent loss of
several key players on the de
fense, Dowhower doesn't feel
his team will be lacking leader
ship.
"In the past, people looked
to one person, but I'd like to
think that we're playing so well
together that we look toward
one another."
There are some who argue
that spring practice is unneces
sary. Dowhower disagrees.
"(Spring practice) gives us an
opportunity to further develop
our style of offense and de
fense, to work with all our
players, to really take a good,
hard look at some individuals
who did not have a lot of op
portune >n the fall to show
what thev can do, and it also
relates to the tact that people
develop at dnterent rates,"
Dowhower explained.
Dowhower said that in
spring pra. tice "we all find out
a little bi* more about ourse
lves."
As a new head coach,
Dowhower said spring practice
allowed him a chance to de
velop a better teeling for the
team as a whole that will be

crucial in the fall.
But what about the fall?
"Stanford will bea team that,
properly put together and
through development in our
pre-conference games, will
provide stiff competition for
anybody," Dowhower
said.
"The key to how we do will
depend on how consistent we
become."
Though Dowhower's Cards
will run the same complex of
fense as did Bill Walsh's teams,
there will be a few differences.
Dowhower said these differ
ences will be primarily because
of the players he has and will
be more of a shift in emphasis
than anything else.
"We'll play to our
strengths," Dowhower
explained.
Dowhower also said that he
will try to place more emphasis
on fundamentals and physical
defense this year than in the
past.
"The key is to maintain con
centration and to play hard,"
Dowhower explained. "Unless
an individual is tested, unless
he is pushed, he never finds
out about himself."
Dowhower's spring practice
tested many players who were
there, but perhaps a greater
test will come for those who
were not.
