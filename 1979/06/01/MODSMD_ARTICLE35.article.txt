# Sonics may take NBA title tonight

Landover, Md. (AP) — Once again the Washington Bullets face
elimination, and this time history is giving them a little push as
well.
Three teams have dug themselves out of 3-1 holes in earlier
playoff rounds, including these same Bullets, who did it in the
Eastern Conference finals against San Antonio.
"It will be tougher this time," warned Washington guard Kevin
Grevey. "Seattle is not San Antonio. Seattle is a much better
team, especially defensively."
Nonetheless Grevey feels the Bullets can make history. "We
can still win this thing," he declared. "There isn't anybody on this
team who doesn't think we can still win."
No way, say the Sonics, although they temper their talk with
polite caution.
Seattle moved within one victory of the summer vacation and
the first championship in the franchise's 12-year history with a
pulsating 114-112 overtime victory Tuesday night behind 36
points by Gus Williams, 32 points by Dennis lohnson and 20
points, 17 rebounds and 5 blocked shots by )ack Sikma.
It was a brutally physical game in which four players fouled
out—Washington's entire front line of Elvin Hayes, Bobby Dan
dridge and Wes Unseld, and Seattle's Shelton. There were 34
fouls called against Washington and 25 against Seattle, including
just 2 against the home team in the final 16Vi minutes.
That disparity prompted Washington Coach Dick Motta to
criticize the officiating, claiming that his team was the victim of
Doug Moe's outburst. Moe, the coach of the San Antonio Spurs,
had lambasted the referees after his team lost its seventh game
against Washington, an outburst for which he was fined $3,000 by
NBA Commissioner Larry O'Brien.
However, Motta did see a bright side to the overtime defeat.
"We played well enough to win, but we didn't," he said, "but
that doesn't mean we're out of it. We've been down 3-1 before
and come back. This team has fought adversity all year long. I told
them after the game, 'Play like this and we'll win it.'"
Washington's improved play Tuesday night is just one thing
that will keep the Sonics on their toes tonight. There is also the
spectre of last spring, when Seattle led 3-2 in the championship
series only to get blown out 117-82 at Washington, then lose the
title 105-99 in Game 7 at Seattle.
