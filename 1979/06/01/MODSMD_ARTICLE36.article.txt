## 'Sportstock' could fund post college athletics

I sat huddled in the drizzling
weather inside the futuristic
and beautiful Strahov Stadium.
Then the crowd, myself in
cluded, rose to its feet. A
deafening roar arose as the
runners entered the home
stretch.

Sports analysis

I was in Prague, Czechos
lavakia viewing the European
Track and Field Champion
ships. For two days I saw every
nation of Europe, as rep
resented by their wild spec
tator sections, rant and rave for
their celebrities.
I was thrilled as the East
German sprinted to a European
800-meter record of 1:43.7, a
time which, like most of the
meet's marks, and never been
equalled by an American. This
man was able to outdo any
American performance, not
because his natural ability or

effort was greater than any
American, but because his
country and his people sup
ported his endeavor both fi
nancially and morally.
In our country this kind of
fan identification and support
just does not exist in post
college athletics. The so-called
Olympic sports currently need
this kind of support, both for
the sake of the fans' entertain
ment and the athletes' needs, if
they are to survive at highly
competitive internationally
levels.
Pro football and basketball
teams have most of our
greatest male athletes, but
here the athletes are detached
from the fans. These major pro
sports will always be most
popular because they are such
an awesome display of talent
and grace. However, fans have
little identification with those
they watch; why support or
even watch someone who has
no association with you? Pro
basketball television ratings

have plummetted. Pro baseball
attendances are down. A de
cline is predicted for pro foot
ball.
Alternatively, post-college
Olympic sports should incor
porate a fan-athlete identifica
tion mechanism in an athletic
funding structure. These
sports can become as popular
as pro sports if fans can feel
they are a part of the athletic
endeavor.
American collegiate sports
creates this feeling. When
Stanford scores a touchdown,
all the student fans and all the
thick-walleted alumni also
score a touchdown.
A plan I have termed
"Sportstock" could be the
answer. The Olympic sports
must rely upon the most pow
erful incentive system we have
lor funding — American busi
ness. Under this plan a number
of companies would start sup
port programs for a number ot
Olympic sport athletes or an
Olympic sport team. Each
company would not pay a
penny, but would issue their
own "sportstock'' to eager in
dividual supporters for a price.
Free advertising would be the
incentive for businesses to
begin such a program. The
funds raised from selling
"sportstock" would pay for the
training and traveling expenses
incurred by the athlete.
Shares of a company's
"sportstock" would be valued
as a close tie to the company
team. Token dividends could
possibly be awarded to
"sportstock" holders. Most ot
the contributors will be com
pany executives or stockhol
ders; dividends create the
image of a worthy investment.
A small return, no matter how
token, would make them feel a
vital part of the program.
This is where the contribut
ing incentive lies — in making
contributors feel a part of the
team effort. These incentives
tor buying "sportstock" shares
are therefore the same as the
incentives for athletically
minded alumni to contribute
to university teams.
Furthermore, the athletes
would be required to work for
the company part-time. This
would create a closer relation
ship between the athlete and
his or her supporters. The
athlete could legally wear the
company name when he com
petes. The company could
then be sure they are aiding
athletes who are conscienci
ous people.
This plan is not the only ans
wer for our athletes, but it is
one proposal. Olympic sports
in America are on the rise. A
revolutionary program like
"sportstock" will be needed to
tie the bond between the tan
and athlete.

ders; dividends create the
image of a worthy investment.
A small return, no matter how
token, would make them feel a
vital part of the program.
This is where the contribut
ing incentive lies — in making
contributors feel a part of the
team effort. These incentives
tor buying "sportstock" shares
are therefore the same as the
incentives for athletically
minded alumni to contribute
to university teams.
Furthermore, the athletes
would be required to work for
the company part-time. This
would create a closer relation
ship between the athlete and
his or her supporters. The
athlete could legally wear the
company name when he com
petes. The company could
then be sure they are aiding
athletes who are conscienci
ous people.
This plan is not the only ans
wer for our athletes, but it is
one proposal. Olympic sports
in America are on the rise. A
revolutionary program like
"sportstock" will be needed to
tie the bond between the tan
and athlete.
I sat huddled in the drizzling
weather inside the futuristic
and beautiful Strahov Stadium.
Then the crowd, myself in
cluded, rose to its feet. A
deafening roar arose as the
runners entered the home
stretch.

Sports analysis

I was in Prague, Czechos
lavakia viewing the European
Track and Field Champion
ships. For two days I saw every
nation of Europe, as rep
resented by their wild spec
tator sections, rant and rave for
their celebrities.
I was thrilled as the East
German sprinted to a European
800-meter record of 1:43.7, a
time which, like most of the
meet's marks, and never been
equalled by an American. This
man was able to outdo any
American performance, not
because his natural ability or

effort was greater than any
American, but because his
country and his people sup
ported his endeavor both fi
nancially and morally.
In our country this kind of
fan identification and support
just does not exist in post
college athletics. The so-called
Olympic sports currently need
this kind of support, both for
the sake of the fans' entertain
ment and the athletes' needs, if
they are to survive at highly
competitive internationally
levels.
Pro football and basketball
teams have most of our
greatest male athletes, but
here the athletes are detached
from the fans. These major pro
sports will always be most
popular because they are such
an awesome display of talent
and grace. However, fans have
little identification with those
they watch; why support or
even watch someone who has
no association with you? Pro
basketball television ratings

have plummetted. Pro baseball
attendances are down. A de
cline is predicted for pro foot
ball.
Alternatively, post-college
Olympic sports should incor
porate a fan-athlete identifica
tion mechanism in an athletic
funding structure. These
sports can become as popular
as pro sports if fans can feel
they are a part of the athletic
endeavor.
American collegiate sports
creates this feeling. When
Stanford scores a touchdown,
all the student fans and all the
thick-walleted alumni also
score a touchdown.
A plan I have termed
"Sportstock" could be the
answer. The Olympic sports
must rely upon the most pow
erful incentive system we have
lor funding — American busi
ness. Under this plan a number
of companies would start sup
port programs for a number ot
Olympic sport athletes or an
Olympic sport team. Each
company would not pay a
penny, but would issue their
own "sportstock'' to eager in
dividual supporters for a price.
Free advertising would be the
incentive for businesses to
begin such a program. The
funds raised from selling
"sportstock" would pay for the
training and traveling expenses
incurred by the athlete.
Shares of a company's
"sportstock" would be valued
as a close tie to the company
team. Token dividends could
possibly be awarded to
"sportstock" holders. Most ot
the contributors will be com
pany executives or stockhol
ders; dividends create the
image of a worthy investment.
A small return, no matter how
token, would make them feel a
vital part of the program.
This is where the contribut
ing incentive lies — in making
contributors feel a part of the
team effort. These incentives
tor buying "sportstock" shares
are therefore the same as the
incentives for athletically

to university teams.

his or her supporters. The

then be sure they are aiding

and athlete.
