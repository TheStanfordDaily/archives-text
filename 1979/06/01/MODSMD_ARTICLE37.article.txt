# Biz School wins IM meet
## 
### Kevin Macgillivray 
The intramural swimming
and diving meet has been
completed and the results have
been released. In the All-
University division, Biz School
ran away with the title, swim
ming past Sigma Chi, Madera,
and a cast of many.
The Biz School stole the
crown using depth. The
businessmen captured only
two first place finishes, and
one of those was in a relay. But,
by continually placing particip
ants in the top five, they scored
well and ended up with a com
fortable margin over the field.
