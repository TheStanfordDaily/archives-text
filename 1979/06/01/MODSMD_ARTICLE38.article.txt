# Independents dominate IM softball
## 
### Kevin Macgillivray 
It looks as though it might be an off-year
for frats, grad schools and living resi
dences, as the intramural softball playoffs
find a whole slew of "independent" teams
flooding the semifinals and finals. Of the
16 teams left in the six division playoff pic
ture, eight are playing "unattached."
In men's A-league, the No. 3-ranked
Stags have reached the finals with their
11-inning semifinal victory over the Zetes,
8-7. The Stags will square off with the Theta
Delts, 3-2 victors over the top-seeded Phi
Delts. This A-league final will take place at
12 noon tomorrow on the softball field
behind Sunken Diamond.
In men's B-league, a name familiar to IM
sports fans has popped up onre again
FACE, the No. 3 seed, h*s advanced into

the semifinals by virtue of 12-0 and 7-1
scores in earlier rounds. They will be faced
by the winner of the Trancos-Kappa Sigma
quarterfinals.
The other half finds two real surprises in
the semifinals. Both the No. 1 and No. 4
seeds were beaten in the quarterfinals by a
couple of independents. The 3 Why's pul
led a big upset by upending the top
ranked Woosies, 5-4. Then, the Incompe
tents downed the Donner√üheas, 5-1.
These two teams have played very well so
far in the tournament, but do not count on
either one of them to win it all. The other
bracket looks much stronger.
Men's C-league action is well along and
presents a final match-up between the
Kunbags and Hillel.

Some old standbys have made it
through the women's A-league competi
tion and the finals look to be very exciting.
Taste of Honey defeated the Crrrls in their
half of the draw, and the Biz Ms. dropped
Lathrop in a very offensive affair, 17-15. In
women's B-league, the top-seeded Seedy
Gourmets face Roble in Saturday's final.
Roble pulled an upset earlier by clowning
the second-ranked freshwomen, Trancos,
8-7.
The coed division is not as far along as
the others and therefore, there is still a
quarterfinal match left to be played. In that
quarterfinal, Kappa Sig meets Who Are
We, with the winner to challenge Biz-118 in
one semifinal. The other semifinal finds
the No. 2-ranked club, the Incompetents,
and their opponent, Eucalypto.
