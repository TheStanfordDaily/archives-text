Bolt did not cause DC-10 tragedy
Washington — The DC-10 bolt found on the runway
near the site of the nation's worst air disaster did not
cause the accident but was broken as a result of it, an
investigator said yesterday.
"The bolt had broken in an overstress condition,
rather than a fatigue condition," Michael Marks, chief
metallurgist for the National Transportation Safety
Board told the board in a briefing. "As far as can be
ascertained so far, the bolt broke as a result of the
accident," he said.
Initially, investigators blamed the bolt for the crash of
the American Airlines DC-10 that killed 274 people out
side Chicago last Friday. The plane lost its left wing
engine, one of three on the plane, before it hit the
ground.
Airlines were ordered to inspect similar bolts on other
DC-10s. During that initial inspection other problems in
the engine-to-wing mounting area were found and the
Federal Aviation Administration ordered the entire fleet
of DC-10s grounded for a more thorough inspection.
Two United Airlines mechanics said yesterday that
during the initial inspection they found one DC-10 with
problems so severe that an engine might have dropped
from it.
"The pylon might have separated from the wing," said
mechanic Ernest Cigliotti.
Late yesterday afternoon the FAA reported that 103
DC-10s had passed the inspection and were cleared for
flight. Officials at the eight U.S. airlines that use DC-10s
counted a total of 112 cleared. FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar said "problems" were found on 37 DC-10s during
the inspections.
Carter, oil firms discuss gas crisis
Washington — President Jimmy Carter summoned
oil company officials to a White House meeting on short
notice yesterday for a talk about the rising price and
shrinking supply of gasoline.
The White House said it expected more than a dozen
industry representatives at the meeting with the presi
dent and Energy Secretary lames Schlesinger that appa
rently was arranged hurridly on Wednesday.
At the same time, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill
(D-Mass.), faced with a deep division in his party over
energy issues, called top Democrats to a meeting to
discuss what role Congress should play in presenting
the public with the facts of energy shortages.
"How do you get to the bottom of it? I don't know how
you get to the bottom of it," O'Neill said. "We don't
have any magic answers."
As evidence of the split among House Democrats, the
party caucus voted 138-69 last week to oppose Carter's
plan for a gradual lifting of crude oil price controls. The
first part of the president's decontrol plan goes into
effect today.

Zimbabwe statehood proclaimed
Salisbury, Zimbabwe Rhodesia — Prime Minister Abel
Muzorewa ushered in the new state of Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia at the stroke of midnight last night, declaring it
"the victorious minute we have struggled for and waited
for over 88 years of colonial domination and subjuga
tion."
The brief radio and television address by the country's
first black prime minister, along with a government
gazette proclamation, were the only official acts marking
the inception of the new state—which was saddled from
birth with international isolation, escalating civil war and
factional rivalries.
The gazette proclamation ended the 15-year white
minority administration of Prime Minister lan Smith and
officially transferred government powers to Muzorewa
and his Cabinet of 11 blacks and five whites. The new
ministers will be sworn in today, with Smith now a
minister-without-portfolio.
Economic indices take record fall
Washington — A key government measure of
economic trends dropped a record 3.3 percent in April
and some private economists said the nation could be
nearing a mild recession.
But a Commerce Department economist called that
conjecture premature and said the figures "may indicate
a healthy breathing spell. We have to wait until next
month to be more certain," said Theodore Torda.
The Commerce Department said yesterday the sharp
decline in the composite index of 10 economic indi
cators exceeded the 3 percent drop in September 1974,
during the depths of the last recession.
The April decline in the composite index was the
fourth in the last six months and comes at a time when
many private economists are predicting a mild recession
during the last half of 1979.

At the same time, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill
(D-Mass.), faced with a deep division in his party over
energy issues, called top Democrats to a meeting to
discuss what role Congress should play in presenting
the public with the facts of energy shortages.
"How do you get to the bottom of it? I don't know how
you get to the bottom of it," O'Neill said. "We don't
have any magic answers."
As evidence of the split among House Democrats, the
party caucus voted 138-69 last week to oppose Carter's
plan for a gradual lifting of crude oil price controls. The
first part of the president's decontrol plan goes into
effect today.

Zimbabwe statehood proclaimed
Salisbury, Zimbabwe Rhodesia — Prime Minister Abel
Muzorewa ushered in the new state of Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia at the stroke of midnight last night, declaring it
"the victorious minute we have struggled for and waited
for over 88 years of colonial domination and subjuga
tion."
The brief radio and television address by the country's
first black prime minister, along with a government
gazette proclamation, were the only official acts marking
the inception of the new state—which was saddled from
birth with international isolation, escalating civil war and
factional rivalries.
The gazette proclamation ended the 15-year white
minority administration of Prime Minister lan Smith and
officially transferred government powers to Muzorewa
and his Cabinet of 11 blacks and five whites. The new
ministers will be sworn in today, with Smith now a
minister-without-portfolio.
Economic indices take record fall
Washington — A key government measure of
economic trends dropped a record 3.3 percent in April
and some private economists said the nation could be
nearing a mild recession.
But a Commerce Department economist called that
conjecture premature and said the figures "may indicate
a healthy breathing spell. We have to wait until next
month to be more certain," said Theodore Torda.
The Commerce Department said yesterday the sharp
decline in the composite index of 10 economic indi
cators exceeded the 3 percent drop in September 1974,
during the depths of the last recession.
The April decline in the composite index was the
fourth in the last six months and comes at a time when
many private economists are predicting a mild recession
during the last half of 1979.

ing yesterday amid fresh evidence of a slowing

points.
Today's weather

ings. Cooler inland. Lows in the 50s. Highs in upper 50s

Bolt did not cause DC-10 tragedy
Washington — The DC-10 bolt found on the runway
near the site of the nation's worst air disaster did not
cause the accident but was broken as a result of it, an
investigator said yesterday.
"The bolt had broken in an overstress condition,
rather than a fatigue condition," Michael Marks, chief
metallurgist for the National Transportation Safety
Board told the board in a briefing. "As far as can be
ascertained so far, the bolt broke as a result of the
accident," he said.
Initially, investigators blamed the bolt for the crash of
the American Airlines DC-10 that killed 274 people out
side Chicago last Friday. The plane lost its left wing
engine, one of three on the plane, before it hit the
ground.
Airlines were ordered to inspect similar bolts on other
DC-10s. During that initial inspection other problems in
the engine-to-wing mounting area were found and the
Federal Aviation Administration ordered the entire fleet
of DC-10s grounded for a more thorough inspection.
Two United Airlines mechanics said yesterday that
during the initial inspection they found one DC-10 with
problems so severe that an engine might have dropped
from it.
"The pylon might have separated from the wing," said
mechanic Ernest Cigliotti.
Late yesterday afternoon the FAA reported that 103
DC-10s had passed the inspection and were cleared for
flight. Officials at the eight U.S. airlines that use DC-10s
counted a total of 112 cleared. FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar said "problems" were found on 37 DC-10s during
the inspections.
Carter, oil firms discuss gas crisis
Washington — President Jimmy Carter summoned
oil company officials to a White House meeting on short
notice yesterday for a talk about the rising price and
shrinking supply of gasoline.
The White House said it expected more than a dozen
industry representatives at the meeting with the presi
dent and Energy Secretary lames Schlesinger that appa
rently was arranged hurridly on Wednesday.

(D-Mass.), faced with a deep division in his party over
