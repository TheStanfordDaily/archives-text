# Lyman answers pension inquiries
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
On retirement, the average faculty member
here faces a "truly miserable pension," according
to a letter from 46 professors published in Wed
nesday's Campus Report.
However, President Richard Lyman noted at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting that increases in
faculty retirement pensions would necessitate
cuts from funds in other areas.
The president's remarks came in response to the
letter published in the University's weekly news
paper for faculty and staff. The letter urged Lyman
to continue full-time employment and University
contributions to pension funds past age 65.
Lyman told the senate, "The total size of the pie
isn't going to change because we start worrying
about it."
Under present University retirement programs,
a person receiving a salary of $36,000 a year "learns
(upon retirement) that his pension, before taxa
tion, will be something less than $12,000," accord
ing to the faculty letter.
The faculty recommendations add that under a
"modest rate of 8 percent inflation, this $12,000
will be reduced to $8100 in five years."
Lyman agreed with the faculty that current pen

sions pose problems, saying, "There's real cause
of worry here." He continued, "Changed
economic and political conditions change the
problems we face."
He added that "there's no simple solution as
long as inflation is out of control as it plainly is."
Lyman said May 15 that faculty members who
reach age 65 between now and July 1,1982, would
have the option of continuing to work at the Uni
versity on a half-time basis. On May 24, Lyman
announced that the University supports state
legislative proposals to institute a mandatory re
tirement age of 70.
California currently has no mandatory retire
ment age while federal law calls for a compulsory
retirement at age 70.
The University has enforced a mandatory re
tirement age of 65 but many of the retired faculty
have been recalled on a part-time basis, according
to Acting Provost Gerald Lieberman.
The faculty letter to Lyman said the president's
half-time employment option is "neither logical or
ethical." According to the faculty letter, anything
less than a full-time option "would be as dis
criminatory as no option at all since the University
still proposes to end its contribution to pension
funds when faculty members reach the age of 65

whether they retire or not."
According to Lyman, the half-time employment
proposal would further progress in the appoint
ment of women and minority faculty members.
The faculty letter argues, however, that there is
no direct correlation between retirements and
opportunities for young scholars. Citing a survey
of the local chapter of the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) for qualification, fa
culty members state, "In Stanford's current prac
tices retirements have not played a significant part
in hiring patterns."
At the faculty senate meeting, Lyman said he
finds the faculty statement that retirement does
not affect hiring patterns "incomprehensible"
and noted that "80 percent of those faculty mem
bers retiring in the last five years have been re
placed at the non-tenure or junior faculty level."
In other business yesterday, the faculty senate
voted to discontinue the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs as a committee of the Academic
Council after lengthy debate. The senate also
voted to establish an undergraduate degree of
Bachelor of Arts and Sciences. Previously, the
University has allowed students completing the
requirements for bachelor of arts and a bachelor
of science to designate only one on their diploma.
