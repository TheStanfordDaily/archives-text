# Wage-price enforcement ruled illegal
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — In a major blow
to President )immy Carter's anti
inflation program, a federal judge
ruled yesterday that Carter has over
stepped his constitutional power in
trying to enforce his wage-price
guidelines.
U.S. District judge Barrington Par
ket said neither the Constitution nor
Congress gave Carter authority to
threaten to deny federal contracts to
companies that violate his "volun
tary" guidelines.
The decision does not prevent the
president from using his influence—
"benign jawboning" in the judge's
words—to obtain purely voluntary
support for his guidelines from busi
ness and labor.

But it disarms the administration of
a big club to enforce the guidelines.
And it adds another crack in the
seven-month-old program, which
has been crumbling under the
weight of mounting union opposi
tion and an inflation rate that is now
running at 14 percent a year.
White House press secretary jody
Powell said the administration may
ask for a stay of the judge's decision
pending an appeal. Powell added the
decision "does not invalidate the
voluntary guidelines either in fact or
in law."
Carter's chief inflation adviser,
Alfred Kahn, acknowledged that the
ruling strips the program of an im
portant enforcement tool but said

this does not mean that the
guidelines "have failed or will be
abandoned."
Both Kahn and Powell said the
force of adverse publicity used
against guideline violators remains a
potent weapon in winning com
pliance.
The ruling was a major victory for
the AFL CIO and nine member un
ions, which challenged the legality of
Carter's guidelines in a suit filed in
March. In a rare showing of support,
a group of Republican congressmen
subsequently filed court papers
backing labor's position.
The AFL-CIO argued that the use of
penalties converts Carter's program
into mandatory controls, which only

Congress can impose.
AFL-CIO President George Meany
hailed the ruling and urged Carter
"to develop an anti-inflation prog
ram that deals effectively with the
real causes of inflation within the
constitutional limits" the judge set.
The wage guideline calls for a 7
percent annual limit on pay and
fringe benefit increases, although
larger settlements are allowed be
cause of several exemptions.
To obtain compliance, the ad
ministration had threatened to bar
violators from bidding on federal
contracts worth $5 million or more.
Altogether, an estimated $40 billion
to $56 billion a year in government
purchases would be affected.
