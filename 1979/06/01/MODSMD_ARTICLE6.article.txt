At a meeting hastily assembled by members of the Council of Presi
dents last night, the ASSU Senate officially approved its Nominations
Committee's recommendations for next year's student representatives
on University committees.
From an application pool of 224 individuals, the Nom Com appointed 37
women and 64 men to fill the available positions. COP member Sibby
Freeman said that the committee "made an attempt at affirmative action"
in the three areas relatively underrepresented in the applicant pool:
national minorities (blacks, Asian Americans, Chicanos and Native
Americans), women and graduate students.
After the appointments report was unanimously passed, Chairperson
George Drysdaie noted that this is the first year in which committee
nominations have been presented to both the senate and the administra
tion on schedule.
In an earlier decision, the Senate readily passed a resolution to estab
lish a public speaking and debate program within one of the academic
departments of the University. The bill was proposed by Sen. Brett Kings
tone, a member of last week's winning Voltaire debate team, and spon
sored by Political Science Profs. Robert FHorn and Hubert Mar
shall. Kingstone termed the Senate's action "a positive motion" and a
worthwhile move, in light of Stanford's former excellence in the field,
which was dissoK ed several years ago by a funding transfer to the Drama
Dept.
The Senate voted to accept the Guest Professorship Board's recom
mendations of Hayden White and Vincent Navarro for next year.
White, an international historian at UC-Santa Cruz and author of
Metahistory, will teach a course or courses on the philosophy of history,
the theories of interpretation, or on the French philosopher Foucault next
spring quarter.
He was classified as an interdisciplinary scholar with interests in several
areas, including history as literary fiction, by Guest Professorship Board
member Carey Perloff.
Navarro, a professor in the Department of Public Health at Johns
Hopkins, is a leading specialist on the economics of public health care.
"In view of the human biology program here and (Sen. Edward) Ken
nedy's bill, his class will be extremely important," said Jay Modrall,
member of the Guest Professorship Board.
Navarro will teach here either next autumn or winter.
The senate had belatedly initiated support for Allard Lowenstein, an
arbitrator for Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and a former United Nations ambas
sador on human rights and U.S. congressman, for a guest professorship
job.
Upon voting, the senators demurred to the Guest Professorship
Board's five months of extended labor and desire for a strong intellectual
influx outside the political arena.
