At a meeting hastily assembled by members of the Council of Presi
dents last night, the ASSU Senate officially approved its Nominations
Committee's recommendations for next year's student representatives
on University committees.
From an application pool of 224 individuals, the Nom Com appointed 37
women and 64 men to fill the available positions. COP member Sibby
Freeman said that the committee "made an attempt at affirmative action"
in the three areas relatively underrepresented in the applicant pool:
national minorities (blacks, Asian Americans, Chicanos and Native
Americans), women and graduate students.
After the appointments report was unanimously passed, Chairperson
George Drysdaie noted that this is the first year in which committee
nominations have been presented to both the senate and the administra
tion on schedule.
In an earlier decision, the Senate readily passed a resolution to estab
lish a public speaking and debate program within one of the academic
departments of the University. The bill was proposed by Sen. Brett Kings
tone, a member of last week's winning Voltaire debate team, and spon
sored by Political Science Profs. Robert FHorn and Hubert Mar
shall. Kingstone termed the Senate's action "a positive motion" and a
worthwhile move, in light of Stanford's former excellence in the field,
which was dissoK ed several years ago by a funding transfer to the Drama
Dept.
The Senate voted to accept the Guest Professorship Board's recom
mendations of Hayden White and Vincent Navarro for next year.
