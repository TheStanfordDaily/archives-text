# Moodymobile awes Congress
## 
### 
Detroit (AP) — Is that 84 miles
per gallon diesel car for real?
Or does it get 94.5 miles per
gallon, as one of its developers
says a TV crew got with it — 66,
as observed by a government
engineer — or 48, estimated by
an industry engineer?
Or is it a 73.9 miles per gallon
car, the mileage its backers say
they got on the 840-mile trip
from their base near Daytona
Beach, Fla., to Washington,
where congressmen ooh'ed
and ah'ed over it?
Does it accelerate to 60 mph
in 17 seconds — or 23 ? — or 42 ?
The figures illustrate the
confusion the
"Moodymobile," shown to
Congress with fanfare earlier
this month, has brought in the
auto industry.
The confusion will not be
cleared up until the car under
goes the standard tests re
quired by the Environmental
Protection Agency before cars
can be sold — and no one
knows when that will be.
Ralph Moody, who used to
build race cars for Ford Motor
Co., and Mike Shetley, his
partner in the firm of Old Car
Reproductions Inc., took a
Mercury Capri and put a mod
ified small diesel engine in it.
The 84 miles per gallon fi
gure they announced grabbed
headlines immediately. Shet
ley says that figure was ob
tained at a steady mph on the
race tack at Daytona Beach.
Some industry engineers
were headed for Florida to look

the car over. But Shetley said in
a telephone interview that he
would not let them tear it
down: "We don't want them to
know how we do it" because
"there's a process patent in
volved."
Shetley and Moody have said
they will sell the car, using
bodies supplied by the
Lincoln-Mercury Division of
Ford Motor Co., as soon as it
passes the EPA emissions tests.
It would cost $2000 to $4000
over the ordinary sticker price.
They can sell up to 4000 cars
if a prototype meets EPA pollu
tion standards, but to sell more
than that, they need to pass a
50,000-mile durability test.
Lincoln-Mercury confirms it
is interested, but says further
talks must await EPA certifica
tion.
For certification, Shetley said
he will run a 4000-mile test at
Daytona Beach, truck the car to
a testing firm in Livonia, Mich.,
and not let EPA take possession
of it.
"There must be some confu
sion," said Ernie Rosenberg,
chief of the auto regulatory
management staff for EPA in
Washington. He noted that
EPA can permit manufacturers
to do their own tests, but ad
ded, "We have not said we are
willing to waive our confirmat
ory tests."
Moody's skills are highly re
spected in Detroit, and the Big
Three companies are trying to

find out as much as they can.
Detroiters recall two similar
wonder cars — both highly ex
perimental and never put into
production. A Ford Pinto pow
ered by a Nissan diesel got 80.8
miles per gallon at a steady 45
mph in 1976. A special diesel
VW Rabbit built for the U.S.
Department of Transportation
got 55 miles per gallon on the
stop-and-start EPA city driving
test in 1977, and 80 miles per
gallon at a steady 30 mph.
Like Moody's car, both the
Pinto and the VW used tur
bochargers, which use energy
in the exhaust to force more air
into the cylinders.
"There doesn't seem to be
any secret as to what he has
done, as far as we can tell. He's
an old racing hand and knows
every trick there is," said a
senior engineer with a Big
Three company who agreed to
an interview on condition that
no names be used.
What has Moody done?
According to Bill Winemas
ter, marketing director of Per
kins Engine Co., whose 50-
horsepower, four-cylinder
model Moody uses, Moody
found that the Capri needed
only 12 horsepower to propel it
on a level road with no wind at
55 mph, and "matched the
horsepower to the car."
The engine achieves about
65 horsepower when the tur
bocharger turns on for heavy
loads such as hills, Winemaster
said.

gallon, as one of its developers
says a TV crew got with it — 66,
as observed by a government
engineer — or 48, estimated by
an industry engineer?
Or is it a 73.9 miles per gallon
car, the mileage its backers say
they got on the 840-mile trip
from their base near Daytona
Beach, Fla., to Washington,
where congressmen ooh'ed
and ah'ed over it?
Does it accelerate to 60 mph
in 17 seconds — or 23 ? — or 42 ?
The figures illustrate the
confusion the
"Moodymobile," shown to
Congress with fanfare earlier
this month, has brought in the
auto industry.
The confusion will not be
cleared up until the car under
goes the standard tests re
quired by the Environmental
Protection Agency before cars
can be sold — and no one
knows when that will be.
Ralph Moody, who used to
build race cars for Ford Motor
Co., and Mike Shetley, his
partner in the firm of Old Car
Reproductions Inc., took a
Mercury Capri and put a mod
ified small diesel engine in it.
The 84 miles per gallon fi
gure they announced grabbed
headlines immediately. Shet
ley says that figure was ob
tained at a steady mph on the
race tack at Daytona Beach.
Some industry engineers
were headed for Florida to look

the car over. But Shetley said in
a telephone interview that he
would not let them tear it
down: "We don't want them to
know how we do it" because
"there's a process patent in
volved."
Shetley and Moody have said
they will sell the car, using
bodies supplied by the
Lincoln-Mercury Division of
Ford Motor Co., as soon as it
passes the EPA emissions tests.
It would cost $2000 to $4000
over the ordinary sticker price.
They can sell up to 4000 cars
if a prototype meets EPA pollu
tion standards, but to sell more
than that, they need to pass a
50,000-mile durability test.
Lincoln-Mercury confirms it
is interested, but says further
talks must await EPA certifica
tion.
For certification, Shetley said
he will run a 4000-mile test at
Daytona Beach, truck the car to
a testing firm in Livonia, Mich.,
and not let EPA take possession
of it.
"There must be some confu
sion," said Ernie Rosenberg,
chief of the auto regulatory
management staff for EPA in
Washington. He noted that
EPA can permit manufacturers
to do their own tests, but ad
ded, "We have not said we are
willing to waive our confirmat
ory tests."
Moody's skills are highly re
spected in Detroit, and the Big
Three companies are trying to

find out as much as they can.
Detroiters recall two similar
wonder cars — both highly ex
perimental and never put into
production. A Ford Pinto pow
ered by a Nissan diesel got 80.8
miles per gallon at a steady 45
mph in 1976. A special diesel
VW Rabbit built for the U.S.
Department of Transportation
got 55 miles per gallon on the
stop-and-start EPA city driving
test in 1977, and 80 miles per
gallon at a steady 30 mph.
Like Moody's car, both the
Pinto and the VW used tur
bochargers, which use energy
in the exhaust to force more air
into the cylinders.
"There doesn't seem to be
any secret as to what he has
done, as far as we can tell. He's
an old racing hand and knows
every trick there is," said a
senior engineer with a Big
Three company who agreed to
an interview on condition that
no names be used.
What has Moody done?
According to Bill Winemas
ter, marketing director of Per
kins Engine Co., whose 50-
horsepower, four-cylinder
model Moody uses, Moody
found that the Capri needed
only 12 horsepower to propel it
on a level road with no wind at
55 mph, and "matched the
horsepower to the car."
The engine achieves about
65 horsepower when the tur
bocharger turns on for heavy
loads such as hills, Winemaster
said.
Detroit (AP) — Is that 84 miles
per gallon diesel car for real?

gallon, as one of its developers

engineer — or 48, estimated by
an industry engineer?
