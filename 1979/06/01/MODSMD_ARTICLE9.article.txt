Dear Bug Me:
I am a registered student now and will be again
m the fall. Why won t the Athletic Dept. allow us
to use any of the facilities this summer if we will
be living and working here on campus but are
not registered for summer sessionf
- A.R.
It you are indeed working for the University
this summer, you should apply to your depart
ment secretary for a "courtesy" card. A faculty
staff card will also allow you to buy books ahead
ot registered students.
If you are not registered but are working on an
academic project that carries over to fall, your
academic department can request these
privileges for you, said Robert Young, associate
director of athletics.
So many summer visitors, on campus for
University-sponsored programs, try to use the
athletic facilities that the University needs some
way to control entrance to those facilities,
Young said. He noted that with the high number
of summer visitors, the pools and golf course
get more use than at any other time.

Dear Bug Me:
What's with this Marguerite schedule? ' 3m in
the habit of riding it to the Stanford Shopping
Center at lunch time. Today I waited from 11:55
a.m. until 12:20 p.m. In fact, during the last two
weeks the bus hasn't come between 11:55 a.m.
and 12:15 p.m. It's frustrating to spend half of
one's lunch hour waiting for a bus that advertises
a 10-minute schedule.
-A.D.
John Pipkin, traffic manager, said the buses
should be running on time now, after their
schedules were upset in the last five to six weeks
by maintenance problems. Pipkin added that a
fleet of buses runs 12 hours straight, no stop
ping, and that they finally rebelled against the
wear and tear. He blamed potholed streets for
some ot the problems, but said that all but one
of the buses are back in operation now.

Dear Bug Me:
Who is responsible for cleaning up the litter
from around Tresidder? I never cease to be an
noyed by the ill-kempt appearance of the cam
pus, and this area is especially blighted.
- K.L.
The University, through Tresidder Union,
T.D.S., (the managers of the Transition and the

Coffee House), and Marcel's are all responsible
for keeping the lounge areas and patios clean.
Jeff Nelson, facilities manager for Tresidder
Union, admitted to a bad trash problem there
right now, but Andy Brooks, food service coor
dinator for T.D.S., said, "We feel we are keeping
the tables and chairs clean."
Nelson said he has had managerial problems
arranging his workers' schedules so they can
clean up the patio areas during peak-use times.
He said he has also ordered more trash contain
ers.
Brooks said he is doing the best he can to keep
the areas clean, but that it isn't "economically
feasible" to hire more people. Part of the prob
lem, he said, is that "Stanford students don't
always pick up after themselves." He added that
if students have complaints they can leave them
with the Transition cashiers or in his office at the
north end of the lounge.

Last week I erroneously reported that no
Chiquita bananas or United Farm Workers
boycotted lettuce is being served in the dining
halls.
I cited the five struck growers' produce as
objects of the boycott, when in fact the boycott
covers almost all brands of iceberg lettuce. The
only brand not on the boycott list is a company
that ships mostly to eastern markets. Virginia
Varkonyi, food service manager at Stern, said
most of the lettuce used in salads is this iceberg
variety, the kind most students prefer. Thus our
ruffage is not U.F.W. approved.
Several cases of Chiquita bananas showed up
on campus after distributors stated they would
not deliver that brand if at all possible. The Lee-
Ray-Tarantino Co. of San Francisco said only
Chiquita bananas were ripe for delivery last Fri
day. Not true, said its competitors, Royal Dis
tributing of San lose, which added that ripe Dole
and Del Monte brands were available on the
market. Both suppliers said they will not deliver
Chiquitas in the future.
Varkonyi said students can meet with their
food service committees if they want to help
decide what foods are served. Dining hall kitch
ens are also open for those who want to check
the brands on the banana boxes.

ruffage is not U.F.W. approved.
Several cases of Chiquita bananas showed up
on campus after distributors stated they would
not deliver that brand if at all possible. The Lee-
Ray-Tarantino Co. of San Francisco said only
Chiquita bananas were ripe for delivery last Fri
day. Not true, said its competitors, Royal Dis
tributing of San lose, which added that ripe Dole
and Del Monte brands were available on the
market. Both suppliers said they will not deliver
Chiquitas in the future.
Varkonyi said students can meet with their
food service committees if they want to help
decide what foods are served. Dining hall kitch
ens are also open for those who want to check
the brands on the banana boxes.

Dear Bug Me:
I am a registered student now and will be again
m the fall. Why won t the Athletic Dept. allow us
to use any of the facilities this summer if we will
be living and working here on campus but are
not registered for summer sessionf
- A.R.
It you are indeed working for the University
this summer, you should apply to your depart
ment secretary for a "courtesy" card. A faculty
staff card will also allow you to buy books ahead
ot registered students.
If you are not registered but are working on an
academic project that carries over to fall, your
academic department can request these
privileges for you, said Robert Young, associate
director of athletics.
So many summer visitors, on campus for
University-sponsored programs, try to use the
athletic facilities that the University needs some
way to control entrance to those facilities,
Young said. He noted that with the high number
of summer visitors, the pools and golf course
get more use than at any other time.

Dear Bug Me:
What's with this Marguerite schedule? ' 3m in
the habit of riding it to the Stanford Shopping
Center at lunch time. Today I waited from 11:55
a.m. until 12:20 p.m. In fact, during the last two
weeks the bus hasn't come between 11:55 a.m.
and 12:15 p.m. It's frustrating to spend half of
one's lunch hour waiting for a bus that advertises
a 10-minute schedule.
-A.D.
John Pipkin, traffic manager, said the buses
should be running on time now, after their
schedules were upset in the last five to six weeks
by maintenance problems. Pipkin added that a
fleet of buses runs 12 hours straight, no stop
ping, and that they finally rebelled against the
wear and tear. He blamed potholed streets for
some ot the problems, but said that all but one
of the buses are back in operation now.

Dear Bug Me:
Who is responsible for cleaning up the litter
from around Tresidder? I never cease to be an
noyed by the ill-kempt appearance of the cam
pus, and this area is especially blighted.
- K.L.
The University, through Tresidder Union,
T.D.S., (the managers of the Transition and the

Coffee House), and Marcel's are all responsible
for keeping the lounge areas and patios clean.
Jeff Nelson, facilities manager for Tresidder
Union, admitted to a bad trash problem there
right now, but Andy Brooks, food service coor
dinator for T.D.S., said, "We feel we are keeping
the tables and chairs clean."
Nelson said he has had managerial problems
arranging his workers' schedules so they can
clean up the patio areas during peak-use times.
He said he has also ordered more trash contain
ers.
Brooks said he is doing the best he can to keep
the areas clean, but that it isn't "economically
feasible" to hire more people. Part of the prob
lem, he said, is that "Stanford students don't
always pick up after themselves." He added that
if students have complaints they can leave them
with the Transition cashiers or in his office at the
north end of the lounge.

Last week I erroneously reported that no
Chiquita bananas or United Farm Workers
boycotted lettuce is being served in the dining
halls.
I cited the five struck growers' produce as
objects of the boycott, when in fact the boycott
covers almost all brands of iceberg lettuce. The
only brand not on the boycott list is a company
that ships mostly to eastern markets. Virginia
Varkonyi, food service manager at Stern, said
most of the lettuce used in salads is this iceberg
variety, the kind most students prefer. Thus our
ruffage is not U.F.W. approved.
