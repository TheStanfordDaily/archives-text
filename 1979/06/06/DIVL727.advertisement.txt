World Invocation Day
June 9, 1979
A day for people of all faiths
Those who use the Great Invocation voice the basic needs of
mankind today: the need for light and love, and an understanding
of the divine will. This Invocation belongs to no one individual
or group; it belongs to all humanity. You can join others the
world over on World Invocation Day by using this prayer:
TNK GKE\T 1 INVOCATION
From the point of Light within the Mind of God
Let li<il)t .stream lortli into the minds of men.
