# Maintenance neglect and management of housing criticized
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
Foundations of Jordan, Durand and other Row
houses have been crumbling for years due to
geological characteristics of their locations.
Thirteen houses are slated for major replacement
or repair work on fire escapes this summer, when
code violations were indicated as early as last
November.
These are just two of the problems allegedly
caused by a history of poor management in Service
Operations (formerly Plant Services), the University
department responsible for campus maintenance.
Jason Mavis, director of Service Operations, at
tributes the problems faced by his department to a
legacy of mismanagement which originated in the
mid 19505.
But students, house managers, some Service Op
erations employees and the University ombudsman
say there are still problems.
According to Tom Mills, manager of Building
Maintenance Planning and Scheduling, the prob
lem with the foundations on the Row is due to their
position over a geological stream bed. He explained
that changes in the water table cause the ground
under the building to shift, damaging the founda
tions.
Mills' office is currently undertaking a com
prehensive structural survey of all Row houses, but
Mills said the survey should have been done eight
/ears ago. An earlier check could have prevented or
at least spotted the damage to the buildings sooner.
Last November the University received notice
from the fire marshall that fire escapes in 13 build
ings on the Row no longer met building safety code

requirements.
Ed Scoles, associate Service Operations director
for Housing, Food Services and Conferences, attri
buted the delay in solving those problems to dif
ficulties in redesigning fire escapes according to
safety codes.
But Scoles confirmed that there have been no
interim measures provided in case there is a fire
during the seven months between identification of
the problem and resolution.
Other buildings on the Row have major deficien
cies in electrical wiring systems. Several rooms in
Phi Psi house have no light fixtures, but only wires
with bare bulbs hanging from the ceiling.
The Beta house and Phi Psi both were missing
basic furnishings such as desks, dressers, book
shelves and trash cans at the beginning of the
academic year.
According to Mavis, "until this year there has
never been a set program to evaluate what goes into
a student room."
What there is in these houses is often broken or
substandard, according to Scott Gill, former house
manager of the Betas. Some of the desks in the
house are "too small to do any studying on. They
also fall apart."
Only this spring has an inventory been taken of
the furnishings in student residences. Diana Con
klin, assistant director of the Row said, "It seems to
me (that) no one has recognized the needs of the
houses. Sometimes I get the feeling that the old
houses are orphans. All they get are hand-me
downs if they get anything."
She added, "I think the University needs to de

velop a consumer service orientation — keeping in
mind who their customers are — the students. Our
problem is how to do it. But our goal should be
meeting basic needs."
But meeting basic needs has not been the goal of
Service Operations, according to most critics. Keith
Light, administrative assistant for the Crothers halls
and former Residence Manager's Office (RMO) rep
resentative on the Row said that problems are hand
led in a crisis management mode.
Dennis McEnnerny, house associate (RA) of Phi
Psi, said that often it is the house that screams the
loudest and goes the farthest with their complaints
that gets the necessary work done.
McEnnerny told of his house's difficulties in ob
taining a refrigerator for their kitchen.
"Our house managerwent intothe RMO and they
said 'Sorry, it's not in the budget.' The next day she
went to (University) Ombudsman (John Goheen)
and the day after we had a refrigerator," he said.
Problems arise also because there is no plan for
regular repairs.
Mills said that, indeed, there is no plan for regular
periodic maintenance in residences.
He explained, however, that his office is in the
process of organizing a maintenance plan in order
to budget for expenses such as the replacement of
items which reach their life expectancy. "You know
that mattresses are going to wear out in seven years."
Last summer, however, Service Operations had
to spend $20,000 to replace mattresses that were up
to 15 years old, according to Light. In addition, 170
desks were purchased to replace broken, small or
