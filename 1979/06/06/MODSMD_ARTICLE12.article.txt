## Gotta find a way to take it all in 
### 
Levels of reality are getting dif
ficult here. I sit in my room listen
ing to a recording of the Broadway
version of Hair, still high on the
energy and perspective of last
weekend's production, glancing
through the weekly Campus Re
port. A headline reads,
"Soviets think they can win a
nuclear war with the West,
Hoover study claims."
(I get up from an anti-draft rally
this afternoon to go to work shelv
ing music books.)
. . mail order rifles shoot the
muscles,
"256 Vietcong captured. .
The article reads, "The main ob
jectives of such a strike would be
to destroy the capability of the
U.S. to organize a strong coun
terstrike; to achieve a preponder
ance of residual nuclear power;

Our lives are short -
so much to do, to
enjoy and share. Why
is there no sense of
that kind of reality?
... I don't
understand.

and, if that does not end the war,
to intensify the effort and destroy
the total military-economic po
tential of the U.S."
"How can people be so heart
less. .
I sing along, straightening the
blanket on my bed.
"Although such a war would
clearly involve enormous destruc
tion, in the Soviet view it would
not be the end of the world . . .
Nations could recover, especially
the Soviet Union."
Why? They all say how, but no
one talks about why. How could
anyone have those kinds of goals?
Why? — It just doesn't make any
sense. What on our Earth for?
. . facing a dying nation of
moving paper fantasy, listening
for the new-told lies. .
It's so goddamned incom
prehensible that we can't just
leave each other alone. Psychol
ogy text sitting on the desk. What
kind of blindnesss is a military
aggressive policy?
". . . is there an answer in their
sweet faces? . . . Follow the neon
in young lovers' eyes. .

. . establishing measures for
postwar occupation and control
of each of the probable theaters of
military operations, both conti
nental and intercontinental."
(Tomorrow is my mother and
stepfather's anniversary, gotta
remember to call them. . .)
Reality. Psych chapter 19, exis
tential neurosis — no, my life has
purpose.
". . . easy to give in, easy to
help out. .
Trembling and tears; ungrasp
able, helpless confusion. Why do
they, or we, want to take the
world? Our lives are short — so
much to do, to enjoy and share.
Why is there no sense of that kind
of reality?
. .Oh my Cod your skin is
soft, I love your face. .

A quote from President Lyman
in another Campus Report article,
"There may be all kinds of waysof
dealing with the problem of gen
eral conscription. I don't know.''
I don't understand. Impulse. I
want to take out full-page ads in
the New York Times asking
Brezhnev why. Talking to him,
talking to our Congress as naked
human beings. Why?
(Dorm cat stalks by my window.
The stars are out now.)
"In planning a war, the Soviets
focus on the outcome and in par
ticular on the postwar political
environment."
". . . Let the Sunshine,
Let the Sunshine in,
the Sunshine in!. .
(Freshman Patricia Rose smiles
usually.)
