## Dropping out of an irrelevancy 
### 
I'm bored.
I'm bored because I'm studying
life instead of living it. I've put my life
safely inside a little box on my shelf
and labeled it "Future — don't
touch." I'm in school.
At school I learn to think academi
cally. I learn how to analyze a subject
until it no longer has any beauty,
meaning or purpose. I learn how to
freeze-dry the most fascinating of
ideas into a neat, compact eight
and-a-half-by-eleven typed
double-spaced format.
I learn how to view people as
things. I learn how to talk about
something like "passion" in a calm,
rational manner. And I think, calmly
and removed, about my life, as it sits
on my shelf.
I learn how I can become a better

part of something that was set up
long before I was born. The status
quo. The system. Academia. Stan
ford.
Secondary service
I've reached the conclusion that —
for me, at least — Stanford is a sec
ondary reference source in the pur
suit of life. It's one step removed
from the real thing. And not as good.
"So what the fuck are you doing
here?" you ask.
Good question.
Looking back at my life so far, I see
myself as one of those little push
cars. The toy kind with the flywheel
that you rev up and rev up and finally
put down on the ground so it goes in
any direction you want.

I was put down in Pasadena,
pointed north. Before I started,
someone said "this is the game you
are going to play, and these are the
rules."
'Vroom!'
I learned quickly. "Vroom!" I said,
with an unthinking smile, as I sped
down the straight and narrow path.
"Vroom!" I said as I went through
high school. I did very well. Last time
I checked, I was winning the race.
Rah. Rah.
I came to college.
There were different rules. Less
stringent. Or at least they looked that
way.
"We want you to ask questions,"
they said.
"Really?" I asked, delighted.
"Yes. You're young and rebellious
and you should ask lots of questions.
And when you're done asking ques
tions, we have the answers for you,
too. You see, we're older and wiser
and we've thought about all these
important things."
"Thank you."
Benevolent dictatorship
So here I am. My little push car is
vrooming along smoothly, under the
rule of a dictatorship so benevolent
and so wonderful that it has a smile
like Fred Hargadon.
The rules are clear, but they seem
to offer so much freedom within
their structure. And how could I
question such a structure?
So I play the game. And like any
one I've ever met here who thinks at
all, I ask questions. Lots of questions.
I ask lots of "whys" and a couple of
"whats." I ask questions that I think
are deep and important.
Sometimes I walk around, depre
ssed and looking like Mr. Natural,
asking "Why? Tell me why?" That is,
after all, what I'm supposed to do
. . . Right?
It's been two years now. I peer up
from my books, trying not to look
disappointed, and ask, "So this is
life?"
"No, this is school," my roommate
answers.
"But I want things like passion and
love and laughter and life."
"You should go see Hair."
'I got lite'
I go see Hair. Hair says:
I got life, mother,
I got laughs, sister,
I got freedom, brother,
I got good times, man.
But that's not the way it is.
I got units, mother,
I got papers, sister,

I got midterms, brother,
I got deadlines, man.
The song that hits me is "Where do
I go?" But it has different words, too.
And it ends, "Will I ever discover why
I live and die?"
Must get serious
Not at this rate. So now I have to
get serious. More serious than I like
to get. I'm 19 years old, and my little
push car is still on the straight path it
started on. And it will go and go and
go until someday someone or some
thing picks it off the track and then
I'll die. And all/hose questions I
never answered won't matter.
"C'est la vie?"
"Bitch, bitch, bitch," say the
rules. "School is much better than a
lot of things. You should be glad
you're here."
"Yes, that'strue. I could be shining
shoes. Or peeling potatoes. Or sel
ling advertising. But my guess is that
it could be a lot better, too."
So I decide to drop out of school.
Or stop out. I plan to work until I get
enough money to leave the country,
and I'll see the rest of the world. I'll
come up with something.

I peer up from my
books, trying not to
look disappointed, and
ask, 'so this is lifeV
'No, this is school/ my
roommate answers.

"Oh, look!" says the cynical
reader. "Watch the idealist fall on his
ass. .
Maybe so. Maybe I'll come back to
school and kiss the books I read
from. I'll wonder why I ever left a
place so comfortable and safe — al
beit dry and complacent — as
academia. I'll see. But I won't give up
before I start. Again.
To anyone reading this who's
completely happy here and wonders
what I'm talking about, forgive me
for taking your time.
And to anyone who understands
what I'm saying, and for whom this
article strikes a note somewhere, do
me a favor — don't let this article be
any sort of cathartic experience for
you. Catharsis is nothing more than
Aristotle's way of masturbating. Give
it some thought. Please.
Bye.
