"Spend an hour every day re
jecting the ideas of others and
thinking things out for yourse
lves. This will be hard. ..."
—Albert Einstein
Four years here. And al
though I have learned much
and varied information about
things I never conceived of be
fore, I have not learned to
love. ... By which I mean
that this University's cur
riculum and living environ
ment do nothing to foster em
pathy and care between
people. Consequently, this
University fails to generate any
ideas about what individuals
can actually do to reduce suf
fering and increase happiness
in this world.
Listen. I know that 80 million
and 10 million young children
suffer, respectively, from sec
ond- and third-degree (severe)
malnutrition. I can even go into

detail about the etiology and
the effects of the diarrheal dis
eases which will kill 50 percent
of them before they grow up.
Yet for all my concern and
tears I cannot begin to save
them. Indeed, there has not
been one course on this cam
pus which deals in a general
way with international health
problems or policies.
Sources of education
In retrospect, I must admit
that I've learned far more out
side the classroom than within,
from people like Chris Cray,
David Werner, Steve
Omohundro and Lise Ciraud.
And the most important
single thing I know I've learned
is that every day we continue to
ignore our ability to con
sciously choose and live ac
cording to an ethical system of
our own honest creation.
Instead, most of us live and
make plans according to a
hodge-podge of interests and
handed-down moralities
which have been conditioned
intousbyouraffluent, egocen
tric, consumer environment.
An example: I asked my
ethics professor what were his
own conclusions about a sys
tem of values. His reply: he
had not thought about actually

applying ethical questions to
the choices in his own life.
Local world view
Similarly, Stanford educa
tion tends to perpetuate only a
very local and simplified
awareness of the human condi
tion. The average under
graduate will most likely never
confront the foll<sWing types of
data:
—13.3 million refugees were
reported homeless worldwide
during 1978;
—10 to 20 million Chinese
have been executed/killed dur
ing our generation;
—tens of thousands of
documented tortures continu
ously occur in Turkey, the
Philippines, Uruguay, Chile,
Iran, Russia, South Africa, In
donesia and South Korea;
—200 million people con
tracted malaria this past year;
—entire races and cultures

of people are being eradicated
in every continent: the pyg
mies in Zaire, Aborigines in
Australia, Cinta Larga and Ache
Indians in South America to
name just a very few.
Contemporary genocide
Of the genocide of the Ache
Indians, Auschwitz survivor
Elie Wiesel writes, "/ didn't
know that 30 years after the col
lapse of the Nazi regime, men
and women were still living
under its inhuman spell. . . .
But our society prefers not to
know all that. Silence
everywhere."
How do I console the billion
crying souls I've only learned
to hear?
Another contemporary
tragedy: Imprisoned, starved,
poisoned, crushed, beheaded,
castrated, classically con
ditioned, 100 million primates,
dogs and other animals die
each year in U.S. institutions
like Stanford.
Hundreds of millions of
other feeling beings each year
end their immobile, crowded
and miserable lives in factory
farms. Billions more die
throughout the world: har
pooned, burnt-alive, leg
trapped, decompressed or
starved because their home

environment has been de
stroyed.
Not helpless
Nevertheless, I am fully con
vinced that I, and others, can
learn to act to eliminate every
problem I've mentioned and
more. Big words, I can't even
make those closest to me
happy.
A memory: Michael alone
could cry about these things
with me, in the dorm lounge,
for he would not shield his
gentle heart from the sadness
around him. Listen to what he
wrote before dropping out of
this manifestly debasing in
stitution:
"Not only were others being
harmed, I myself, for all my crit
ical attitude.could not remain
unaffected by the competi
tiveness, the grade-grubbing,
the obsession with future go
als, the personal ambition, the
material extravagance, the
alienation and the passivity
one finds at Stanford."
Love as sin
I'm sorry. Love has no place
in The Stanford Daily, let alone
in a society based on acquisi
tive self-interest. I recently
found out that my own family
despises and distrusts
homosexuality. Last week two
males were tried and executed
in Iran for loving each other.
Four years. I know all the
quarks; I understand the de
mographic history of England;
and I know influential people.
But I cannot put my arm
around someone who is obvi
ously lonely and upset and say,
"I know how you feel," and
work out such despair.
Make no mistake: I'm in
love.

self as a mixed-up senior.)
