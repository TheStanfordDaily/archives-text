Edge for students
In his letter (Daily, May 31),
Andrew Schaub stated "there
are no magazines or pamphlets
which print students' literary
work exclusively."
We, the editors of Edge
magazine, would like to state
emphatically that he is mista
ken.
Edge is Stanford's magazine
of fantasy and science fiction,

published quarterly. It is run by
an all-student staff, and it is de
voted exclusively to the fiction,
poetry, and art of Stanford stu
dents. We feel that Edge pro
vides an excellent outlet for the
creative talent that the Stan
ford students have to offer,
and we invite their participa
tion.
