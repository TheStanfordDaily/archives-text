# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Burbie et al. Third World program needs Kofi 
### 
We represent an ad hoc coal
ition of Third World student
organizations at Stanford who
are concerned about the lack
of adequate Third World scho
larship at Stanford.
What is demanding our at
tention at this moment is the
tenure fight of Prof. Tetteh Kofi
of the Food Research Institue
(FRI). It is our belief that the
loss of Kofi will be another
serious blow to the develop
ment of Third World scholar
ship at this University.
That is why we unequivocally
support his tenure. It has been
endorsed by many eminent
professors both inside and
outside of the Stanford com
munity, including loan Robin
son of Cambridge, Lawrence
Klein of the University of
Pennsylvania, Alain d'Jarvy of
UC-Berkeley, John Gurley and
Gerald Meier (both in the
Economics Dept. here) and
Henry Levin of the School of
Education, also at the Univer
sity.
We might further point out
that even those of the conser
vative perspective (such as
Peter Duignan of the Hoover
Institution) have endorsed Kofi
for tenure.
Our concern about the qual
ity of the education provided
by the University is long
standing. Third World students
who felt the intellectual vac
uum in ethnic studies and

Third World scholarship
fought to include those sub
jects in the University's
academic structure. Though
black studies and ethnic
studies departments were set
up at other universities, the
University established only
"programs."
This meant that scholars
from the Thi rd World would be
hired to teach in the programs
only through traditional de
partments. Kofi was one such
scholar who was mandated to
teach courses on the
economies of the Third World.
No mechanism
What has become increas
ingly apparent over the years is
that the departments and the
deans do not have a formal
mechanism to evaluate such
scholars fairly and effectively.
For example, it is clear that in
Kofi's case FRI was oblivious to
Third World scholarship. It has
refused to evaluate Kofi's work
in alternative paradigms and
does not want such paradigms
associated with itself.
We are also aware of several
serious irregularities which
have been committed by the
faculty, especially the director.
For instance, Kofi was not
evaluated for tenure on the
basis of the criteria (terms of
reference) set forth in his con
tract; he was also denied
cost-of-living increases which
had been granted to the rest of
the faculty.
As a matter of fact, the dis
dain the FRI has for Third
World scholarship was shown
when FRI attempted to remove
Kofi's courses from this year's
Courses and Degrees.
Endorse
It is our sincere desire that
the provost endorse Third
World scholarship as a legiti
mate field of inquiry. Kofi is
one of the very few who is de
dicated to the development of
such scholarship.
His publication and teaching
record (as evidenced by the

consistently favorable reports
given in the ASSU Course
Evaluation each year and let
ters from his students to the
deans and the provost such as
the one dated June 6, 1978,
from his FRI 133 and 134 clas
ses), together with his services
to the University, are a matter
of public record.
One further point — we are
shocked by the irregularities
committed in Kofi's tenure re
view and hold FRI authorities
fully responsible. We are ref
raining at this time from under
taking a full investigation of the
situation, awaiting the out
come of its deliberations and

the normal grievance process.
However, if the University is
truly concerned about having
quality professors in diverse
fields and perspectives —
minority perspectives in par
ticular — the administration
should treat Kofi's grievances
with all seriousness and over
turn the outcome of the earlier
proceedings, giving him te
nure.
(Junior Diane Burbie was this
year's president of the Black
Students Union. Representa
tives of other minority organi
zations here signed the letter as
well.)
