## Clerical workers need to unionize 
### 
We rarely hear about issues such as un
ionization which confront University
employees, but they deserve our atten
tion. Union membership is an important
subject now because the contract cur
rently in effect between the University and
United Stanford Employees (USE) is due to
expire on August 31. In order to under
stand the importance of this contract, we
must first understand the situation of the
union and its membership here on cam
pus.
The current USE bargaining unit — a
group of University employees who have
been recognized by the University and the
National Labor Relations Board as having
collective bargaining rights and with
whom the University must negotiate a
contract — includes only service, mainte
nance and technical workers. The large
body of clerical workers (not to mention
professional and supervisory employees)
are not legally part of the bargaining unit,
though they may individually join the un
ion.
Service, maintenance and technical
workers comprise a bargaining unit of
about 1300 people who are represented by
USE in their dealings with the University.
Routinely, benefits won for the members
of the bargaining unit are also given by the
University to other employees. Superfi
ciary, there appears to be little reason for
employees such as clerical workers who
are currently not part of the bargaining
unit to agitate for membership. However,
union membership is still important, both
for the sake of the union itself and for its
members.
Clerical workers here at Stanford — the
vast majority of which are women — are at
the bottom of the pay scale. The Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Women's As
sociation has gathered statistics which
show that in the past six years the average
woman working at SLAC received a salary
only 63-64 percent of the salary of the aver
age man working at SLAC. These figures
do not necessarily represent the situation
of clerical workers in the University itself,
but they do represent a pattern which re

curs everywhere in the nation.
Nationally women earn 57 percent of
what men earn. Several factors create this
dichotomy, one of which is the fact that
because women have traditionally made
up the temporary and part-time work
force, they have been channeled into the
lowest-paying, least-skilled occupations.
The clerical workers' situation is in need of
careful scrutiny. SLAC's statistics de-

workers have shown no pay
improvement in the past six
years relative to other
workers there.

monstrate that clerical workers have
shown no pay improvement in the past six
years relative to other workers there.
The large pay-scale differential between
occupations which are traditionally male
dominated and those which are domi
nated largely by females is further aggra
vated when the low-paying, traditionally
female clerical field is not unionized. For
instance, the starting salary for the lowest
University classification of clerical work
ers, Administrative Assistant I, a skilled
occupation, is $1057 per month. In con
trast, Maintenance Person I, which is a
traditionally male position and is un
ionized, starts at $1083, but virtually the
only requirement for the job is a driver's
license. The absence of the union exacer
bates the long-entrenched dichotomy in
the work force.
Despite the fact that the University gives
benefits won by USE for the members of its
bargaining unit to other workers, the
union offers the workers protection they
are otherwise not guaranteed. Most obvi

ously, it offers greater job security. Also, a
worker who is legally part of the bargain
ing unit has legal recourse and a broad
base of support for his or her grievances.
A non-union worker's cause can be
taken up by the union, but USE's only bar
ganing tool in such a case is publicity.
Since the worker is not technically part of
the bargaining unit, the union has no legal
clout in resolving the problem. The Uni
versity's grievance procedure is relatively
receptive to major individual troubles, but
in cases in which fine lines must be drawn
and investigating done, individual pleas
are often powerless, and union support is
crucial.
Including clerical workers in the bar
gaining unit would add strength to USE's
negotiating power vis-a-vis the University
and would allow focusing, when neces
sary, on issues relating particularly to the
clerical workers.
Yet clerical workers remain non
unionized. The move toward the union
must come from within; there must be a
desire for improvement and a choice
made that union membership is the best
way to effect that change. Many factors
complicate such a clear-cut choice, how
ever. Minimal all-University communica
tion between workers exists.
Stanford tries to foster a great deal of
"community feeling" in its employees,
which makes any feelings of dissatisfac
tion akin to disloyalty, as in "don't bite the
hand that feeds." In the clerical profes
sion, the supervisor's expectation often is
that the worker will "keep things running
smoothly," in which case a worker's move
to unionize is viewed as "rocking the
boat."
What must be remembered is that un
ionization is not the workers' move to
exploit their employer, but to prevent
being exploited. The root of the matter lies
in the concept that there is power in num
bers — power which lends the worker
safety from exploitation.

exploit their employer, but to prevent
being exploited. The root of the matter lies
in the concept that there is power in num
bers — power which lends the worker
safety from exploitation.

We rarely hear about issues such as un
ionization which confront University
employees, but they deserve our atten
tion. Union membership is an important
subject now because the contract cur
rently in effect between the University and
United Stanford Employees (USE) is due to
expire on August 31. In order to under
stand the importance of this contract, we
must first understand the situation of the
union and its membership here on cam
pus.
The current USE bargaining unit — a
group of University employees who have
been recognized by the University and the
National Labor Relations Board as having
collective bargaining rights and with
whom the University must negotiate a
contract — includes only service, mainte
nance and technical workers. The large
body of clerical workers (not to mention
professional and supervisory employees)
are not legally part of the bargaining unit,
though they may individually join the un
ion.
Service, maintenance and technical
workers comprise a bargaining unit of
about 1300 people who are represented by
USE in their dealings with the University.
Routinely, benefits won for the members
of the bargaining unit are also given by the
University to other employees. Superfi
ciary, there appears to be little reason for
employees such as clerical workers who
are currently not part of the bargaining
unit to agitate for membership. However,
union membership is still important, both
for the sake of the union itself and for its
members.
Clerical workers here at Stanford — the
vast majority of which are women — are at
the bottom of the pay scale. The Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Women's As
sociation has gathered statistics which
show that in the past six years the average
woman working at SLAC received a salary
only 63-64 percent of the salary of the aver
age man working at SLAC. These figures
do not necessarily represent the situation
of clerical workers in the University itself,
but they do represent a pattern which re

curs everywhere in the nation.
Nationally women earn 57 percent of
what men earn. Several factors create this
dichotomy, one of which is the fact that
because women have traditionally made
up the temporary and part-time work
force, they have been channeled into the
lowest-paying, least-skilled occupations.
The clerical workers' situation is in need of
careful scrutiny. SLAC's statistics de-

improvement in the past six
years relative to other
workers there.

monstrate that clerical workers have
shown no pay improvement in the past six
years relative to other workers there.
The large pay-scale differential between
occupations which are traditionally male
dominated and those which are domi
nated largely by females is further aggra
vated when the low-paying, traditionally
female clerical field is not unionized. For
instance, the starting salary for the lowest
University classification of clerical work
ers, Administrative Assistant I, a skilled
occupation, is $1057 per month. In con
trast, Maintenance Person I, which is a
traditionally male position and is un
ionized, starts at $1083, but virtually the
only requirement for the job is a driver's
license. The absence of the union exacer
bates the long-entrenched dichotomy in
the work force.
Despite the fact that the University gives
benefits won by USE for the members of its
bargaining unit to other workers, the
union offers the workers protection they
are otherwise not guaranteed. Most obvi

ously, it offers greater job security. Also, a
worker who is legally part of the bargain
ing unit has legal recourse and a broad
base of support for his or her grievances.
A non-union worker's cause can be
taken up by the union, but USE's only bar
ganing tool in such a case is publicity.
Since the worker is not technically part of
the bargaining unit, the union has no legal
clout in resolving the problem. The Uni
versity's grievance procedure is relatively
receptive to major individual troubles, but
in cases in which fine lines must be drawn
and investigating done, individual pleas
are often powerless, and union support is
crucial.
Including clerical workers in the bar
gaining unit would add strength to USE's
negotiating power vis-a-vis the University
and would allow focusing, when neces
sary, on issues relating particularly to the
clerical workers.
Yet clerical workers remain non
unionized. The move toward the union
must come from within; there must be a
desire for improvement and a choice
made that union membership is the best
way to effect that change. Many factors
complicate such a clear-cut choice, how
ever. Minimal all-University communica
tion between workers exists.
Stanford tries to foster a great deal of
"community feeling" in its employees,
which makes any feelings of dissatisfac
tion akin to disloyalty, as in "don't bite the
hand that feeds." In the clerical profes
sion, the supervisor's expectation often is
that the worker will "keep things running
smoothly," in which case a worker's move
to unionize is viewed as "rocking the
boat."
What must be remembered is that un
ionization is not the workers' move to
exploit their employer, but to prevent
being exploited. The root of the matter lies
in the concept that there is power in num
bers — power which lends the worker
safety from exploitation.
