# Second mishap in seven months
## Library addition flooded 
### Emily Sachar 
For the second time in seven months, the University
libraries have been flooded. The most recent flood,
which occurred last weekend at the new $12 million
Green Library addition did not damage books or furni
ture, but damage costs to carpet and the building struc
ture may exceed $250,000, according to Robert Beth,
director of Risk Management for the University.
The loss is covered by builder's risk insurance which
the University purchased from Fireman's Fund Insur
ance Company.
The flood was caused by an automatic fire sprinkler
which broke and released thousands of gallons of water
down the main stairwell of the four-story structure.
Workers discovered seeping water near basement ceil
ings at 7:30 a.m. Monday when they entered the base
ment level.
The workers then turned off the sprinkler, which had
been spewing out five gallons of water per minute, ac
cording to Roger Cairns, project manager of Facilities
Properties.
There is no way of knowing when the sprinkler broke
and began releasing water, since everything appeared
norma! when workers left the construction site and
locked the project Friday afternoon, Cairns added.

An automatic water flow alarm, which would have
warned that the sprinkler was active, was not hooked up
at the time of the accident.
Damage to the stairwell, which had extensive wood
paneling, to the basement and to the first floor of the
building, was widespread.
Nearly $200,000 of carpeting, some still enclosed in
plastic wrapping, may have been damaged, as was at
least $100,000 of wood paneling. Workers unrolled the
carpet to dry outside on the plaza connecting Green
Library with Meyer Library.
Beth said that a total damage estimate to the carpeting
and other building structures won't be known for at least
six months.
Both the University and Dickman Construction Co., a
Mountain View firm, will employ research teams to in
vestigate the cause of the accident and to assess the
property damage, Beth said.
The library building contract required that the Univer
sity purchase insurance to protect itself, Dickman and all
subcontractors. The insurance protects all of them from
loss to their property unless damage was a result of
contractor error.
"For instance, if the wrong type of sprinkler was put in
and we find that was the cause of the accident, it is
conceivable that Fireman's Fund (Insurance Co.) would
attempt to collect from the subcontractor who installed
and selected that sprinkler," Beth said.
The sprinklers were installed by Robinson Sprinkler
Co.
Beth said that another possible cause of the accident
might be a poorly manufactured sprinkler.
The sprinkler flood will not postpone the scheduled
opening of Green Library in January 1980, Cairns said.
A broken fire main near the same place as the most
recent flooding damaged 40,000 books in the Meyer
Basement Library last Nov. 4.
The cause of that flood has still not been completely
determined, Cairns said.


Workers move one of the rolls of carpet damaged when a
sprinkler head broke in the new Green Library addition this
past weekend, spraying water into the third floor at a rate of
five gallons per minute. Several rolls of carpeting, some of it

already installed in the building, were damaged as was some
wood paneling. Sources said the loss could total more than
$250,000.
