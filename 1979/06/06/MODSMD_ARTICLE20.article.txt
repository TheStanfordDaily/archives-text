Minority progress
After reading the article
(Daily, May 30) "Minority law
admissions suffer from 'lack of
commitment,' " I find it neces
sary to supplement it with the
following information:
—To date, 65 minority stu
dents have been admitted to
the first-year class. This figure
represents the second highest
number of admittees in the his
tory of the school, the highest
being 68 in 1974.
—To date, a minimum of 32
minority students will enter
with the class of 1982. This fi
gure represents the highest
number of minority enrollees
at the law school since 1972.
Thus, minorities will compose
about 20 percent of the enter
ing class.
—A majority of the law
school faculty members and
minority law students have
volunteered hours of their
time to telephone minority
admittees to encourage them
to enroll.
—The alumni have made
numerous efforts to encourage
minority admittees to come.
Specifically they have written,
telephoned and given financial
incentives such as the "fly
back" program noted in your
article.
—I personally spent a total of
41 consecutive days traveling
throughout the United States
in the fall of 1978 recruiting,
and another two weeks per
sonally visiting all of the minor
ity admittees this spring, all of
this being done with the finan
cial and moral support of the
law school administration.
It is unfortunate that the
above information, which was
shared with the reporter in my
interview, was omitted from
the article. Of noteworthy im

portance, too, is the fact that
while the pool of minority
applicants has decreased due
to the increasingly higher ad
mission standards, the "take"
this year is substantially higher
than in the past.
While I appreciate the con
tinued concern and interest of
the Daily in the subject of
minority admissions, this is an
issue on which everyone
should have a clear and ba
lanced statement of facts.

As a student of life, I would
like to respond to the letter
from Rev. Bo Reahard en
titled "Gayness is Sinful" (Dai
ly, May 15).
As a member of the gay
community, I would like to
voice the dismay that many of
us shared at this person's deep
misunderstanding of the
meaning of "Gay Awareness
Week" at Stanford.
—On the Bible's view of
homosexuality. That the Bible
has a multitude of interpreta
tions is common knowledge.
Much theological research
exists which contradicts the
theory that the Bible con
demns homosexuality.
There are many gay Christ
ians and many large gay Christ
ian organizations. Reahard
should state his theological
opinions as such, and not as if
they were fact.
—On learned behavior. The
statement that a behavior is
learned says nothing about the
capacity to unlearn it norabout
the desirability of unlearning
it.
Social science has been un

able to make any definitive
statements abou* the cause or
origin of homosexuality or
sexuality of any form. After all,
heterosexuality is learned also.
—On our life of "fear and
depression." There is no par
ticular pain and agony as
sociated with living a gay lifes
tyle in itself, only in trying to
coexist with such ignorant,
judgemental people as
Reanard.
I would like to assure the
reverend that, contrary to the
efforts of people like himself,
most of us are already happy,
healthy and "truly free to enjoy
sex," without his help. We do
not want to be "cured."
—On the prayer for the last
"Gay Awareness Week". This
final plea makes it very clear
that, as gay citizens of this
earth, our work has just begun.

I was delighted to read in the
Daily (May 29) that Stanford
debaters won the Voltaire de
bate with Berkeley despite the
fact that there is no formal de
bate training here. I, like Brett
Kingstone and Political Science
Prof. Robert Horn, think that
it is a deplorable mistake that
there, are no regular rhetoric
and debate courses supported
by a department in the Univer
sity undergraduate cur
riculum.
I have sponsored an under
graduate special in speech arts
for the past three years in the
hope that eventually it would
become a regular part of the
undergraduate curriculum.
Despite fine teaching by a
series of experienced students

and full enrollments, nothing
has happened.
I would like to add my full
support to the efforts of Kings
tone and Horn in their move to
present Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian with a resolu
tion supporting speech arts at
the undergraduate level.

In light of the two responses
(Daily, May 24 and 30) to my
article on sexism, {Daily, May
22), I offer some clarification.
First, I was neither attacking
Aurora itself nor attempting to
define sexism in it. What I
criticized was the actions of a
group of self-named
"feminists" who angrily went
to the Daily, demanded and
eventually got two "Dupie"
comic strips censored. This
censorship, impeding the flow
of opinions and ideas, is
wrong, even in the name of a
good cause like the women's
movement. The attitude of
these "feminists" — that it is
"okay for our cause, because
we are in the right" — is unac
ceptable in the extreme.
Second, in both Freccero's
and Robeck's replies, they
claim I miss the point as to why
they object to a man running
the escort service. They claim I
don't undertsand the reason
ing behind their not wanting a
man. What I state is that there
is no acceptable rationalization
for not wanting him simply be
cause he is male. I can't accept
discrimination based solely on
sex for a good reason, a bad
reason, or any reason what
soever. That type of rationali
zation is the foundation of
what we call "sexism" and "ra

cism.
Their point that a man is
once again put in a "protec
tor's" role is a valid one, and one
that deserves a second
thought, but it is not a justifica
tion for blatant sexual dis
crimination. Let's not
rationalize ourselves into
thinking it is anything else.
The whole point of my arti
cle, one that Freccero missed
completely and Robeck skirted,
is that this over-reactive, self
righteous, alienating attitude
of the more extreme feminists
is destructive to the women's
movement as a whole. It alien
ates many men and women
alike.
Contrary to Robeck's holier
than-thou attitude, I can and
do understand the frustration
of being discriminated against
for innate factors like race or
sex. I know that many men are
insensitive to a woman's posi
tion in this male-dominated
society, and I understand why
women react as they do.
But it does not justify their
extreme attitude which serves
to increase the gap, not shor
ten it. Sexism committed by
either men on one end of the
spectrum, or by women on the
other, is equally destructive
overall.
I ask only what they demand
of society in general: treat my
self and all men and women as
individuals. Don't make mine,
or that of the head of the escort
service, or anyone's sex the
main factor in dealing with
people. When that ceases to
occur, when feminist energy is
channeled into a pro-woman
rather than anti-everyone else
attitude, they will be surprised
at the support they will gain.

In light of the two responses
(Daily, May 24 and 30) to my
article on sexism, {Daily, May
22), I offer some clarification.
First, I was neither attacking
Aurora itself nor attempting to
define sexism in it. What I
criticized was the actions of a
group of self-named
"feminists" who angrily went
to the Daily, demanded and
eventually got two "Dupie"
comic strips censored. This
censorship, impeding the flow
of opinions and ideas, is
wrong, even in the name of a
good cause like the women's
movement. The attitude of
these "feminists" — that it is
"okay for our cause, because
we are in the right" — is unac
ceptable in the extreme.
Second, in both Freccero's
and Robeck's replies, they
claim I miss the point as to why
they object to a man running
the escort service. They claim I
don't undertsand the reason
ing behind their not wanting a
man. What I state is that there
is no acceptable rationalization
for not wanting him simply be
cause he is male. I can't accept
discrimination based solely on
sex for a good reason, a bad
reason, or any reason what
soever. That type of rationali
zation is the foundation of
what we call "sexism" and "ra

cism.
Their point that a man is
once again put in a "protec
tor's" role is a valid one, and one
that deserves a second
thought, but it is not a justifica
tion for blatant sexual dis
crimination. Let's not
rationalize ourselves into
thinking it is anything else.
The whole point of my arti
cle, one that Freccero missed
completely and Robeck skirted,
is that this over-reactive, self
righteous, alienating attitude
of the more extreme feminists
is destructive to the women's
movement as a whole. It alien
ates many men and women
alike.
Contrary to Robeck's holier
than-thou attitude, I can and
do understand the frustration
of being discriminated against
for innate factors like race or
sex. I know that many men are
insensitive to a woman's posi
tion in this male-dominated
society, and I understand why
women react as they do.
But it does not justify their
extreme attitude which serves
to increase the gap, not shor
ten it. Sexism committed by
either men on one end of the
spectrum, or by women on the
other, is equally destructive

Minority progress
After reading the article
(Daily, May 30) "Minority law
admissions suffer from 'lack of
commitment,' " I find it neces
sary to supplement it with the
following information:
—To date, 65 minority stu
dents have been admitted to
the first-year class. This figure
represents the second highest
number of admittees in the his
tory of the school, the highest
being 68 in 1974.
—To date, a minimum of 32
minority students will enter
with the class of 1982. This fi
gure represents the highest
number of minority enrollees
at the law school since 1972.
Thus, minorities will compose
about 20 percent of the enter
ing class.
—A majority of the law
school faculty members and
minority law students have
volunteered hours of their
time to telephone minority
admittees to encourage them
to enroll.
—The alumni have made
numerous efforts to encourage
minority admittees to come.
Specifically they have written,
telephoned and given financial
incentives such as the "fly
back" program noted in your
article.
—I personally spent a total of
41 consecutive days traveling
throughout the United States
in the fall of 1978 recruiting,
and another two weeks per
sonally visiting all of the minor
ity admittees this spring, all of
this being done with the finan
cial and moral support of the
law school administration.
It is unfortunate that the
above information, which was
shared with the reporter in my
interview, was omitted from
the article. Of noteworthy im

portance, too, is the fact that
while the pool of minority
applicants has decreased due
to the increasingly higher ad
mission standards, the "take"
this year is substantially higher
than in the past.
While I appreciate the con
tinued concern and interest of
the Daily in the subject of
minority admissions, this is an
issue on which everyone
should have a clear and ba
lanced statement of facts.

Cay Awareness
As a student of life, I would
like to respond to the letter
from Rev. Bo Reahard en
titled "Gayness is Sinful" (Dai
ly, May 15).
As a member of the gay
community, I would like to
voice the dismay that many of
us shared at this person's deep
misunderstanding of the
meaning of "Gay Awareness
Week" at Stanford.
—On the Bible's view of
homosexuality. That the Bible
has a multitude of interpreta
tions is common knowledge.
Much theological research
exists which contradicts the
theory that the Bible con
demns homosexuality.
There are many gay Christ
ians and many large gay Christ
ian organizations. Reahard
should state his theological
opinions as such, and not as if
they were fact.
—On learned behavior. The
statement that a behavior is
learned says nothing about the
capacity to unlearn it norabout
the desirability of unlearning
it.
Social science has been un

able to make any definitive
statements abou* the cause or
origin of homosexuality or
sexuality of any form. After all,
heterosexuality is learned also.
—On our life of "fear and
depression." There is no par
ticular pain and agony as
sociated with living a gay lifes
tyle in itself, only in trying to
coexist with such ignorant,
judgemental people as
Reanard.
I would like to assure the
reverend that, contrary to the
efforts of people like himself,
most of us are already happy,
healthy and "truly free to enjoy
sex," without his help. We do
not want to be "cured."
—On the prayer for the last
"Gay Awareness Week". This
final plea makes it very clear
that, as gay citizens of this
earth, our work has just begun.

Debate needed
I was delighted to read in the
Daily (May 29) that Stanford
debaters won the Voltaire de
bate with Berkeley despite the
fact that there is no formal de
bate training here. I, like Brett
Kingstone and Political Science
Prof. Robert Horn, think that
it is a deplorable mistake that
there, are no regular rhetoric
and debate courses supported
by a department in the Univer
sity undergraduate cur
riculum.
I have sponsored an under
graduate special in speech arts
for the past three years in the
hope that eventually it would
become a regular part of the
undergraduate curriculum.
Despite fine teaching by a
series of experienced students

and full enrollments, nothing
has happened.
I would like to add my full
support to the efforts of Kings
tone and Horn in their move to
present Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian with a resolu
tion supporting speech arts at
the undergraduate level.

Sexist views
In light of the two responses
(Daily, May 24 and 30) to my
article on sexism, {Daily, May
22), I offer some clarification.
First, I was neither attacking
Aurora itself nor attempting to
define sexism in it. What I
criticized was the actions of a
group of self-named
"feminists" who angrily went
to the Daily, demanded and
eventually got two "Dupie"
comic strips censored. This
censorship, impeding the flow
of opinions and ideas, is
wrong, even in the name of a
good cause like the women's
movement. The attitude of
these "feminists" — that it is
"okay for our cause, because
we are in the right" — is unac
ceptable in the extreme.
Second, in both Freccero's
and Robeck's replies, they
claim I miss the point as to why
they object to a man running
the escort service. They claim I
don't undertsand the reason
ing behind their not wanting a
man. What I state is that there
is no acceptable rationalization
for not wanting him simply be
cause he is male. I can't accept
discrimination based solely on
sex for a good reason, a bad
reason, or any reason what
soever. That type of rationali
zation is the foundation of
what we call "sexism" and "ra

cism.
Their point that a man is
once again put in a "protec
tor's" role is a valid one, and one
that deserves a second
thought, but it is not a justifica
tion for blatant sexual dis
crimination. Let's not
rationalize ourselves into
thinking it is anything else.
The whole point of my arti
cle, one that Freccero missed
completely and Robeck skirted,
is that this over-reactive, self
righteous, alienating attitude
of the more extreme feminists
is destructive to the women's
movement as a whole. It alien
ates many men and women
alike.
Contrary to Robeck's holier
than-thou attitude, I can and
do understand the frustration
of being discriminated against
for innate factors like race or
sex. I know that many men are
insensitive to a woman's posi
tion in this male-dominated
society, and I understand why
women react as they do.
But it does not justify their
extreme attitude which serves
to increase the gap, not shor
ten it. Sexism committed by
either men on one end of the
spectrum, or by women on the
other, is equally destructive
overall.
I ask only what they demand
of society in general: treat my
self and all men and women as
individuals. Don't make mine,
or that of the head of the escort
service, or anyone's sex the
main factor in dealing with
people. When that ceases to
occur, when feminist energy is
channeled into a pro-woman
rather than anti-everyone else
attitude, they will be surprised
at the support they will gain.
