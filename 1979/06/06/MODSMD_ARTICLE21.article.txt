## The
						volume in retrospect 
### 
Today marks the last regular issue of <
Volume 175, so tradition dictates that Ii
spend a few inches to review my tenure
as editor. I hope you'll bear with me.
Volume 175 was not an easy one.
Some problems which can only be de
scribed as extraordinary cropped up to
make it one of the more difficult vol
umes in recent years. But generally, I
feel the staff came through for the com
munity fairly well.
We are still a long way from perfec
tion, and I for one have found myself
wondering why it is that so many of the
goals I had for my volume will not be
realized. I cannot report that the Daily is
meeting its full responsibility to the
community in all areas of coverage.
Still, we are trying, and I think we are
moving toward the goal. Compared with
last year's spring volume, we are running
25 percent more copy. We increased our
emphasis on student organizations and
local features inside, relying more on
our own writers than on wire copy. Our
coverage of minority affairs continued to
increase at an exponential rate.
Despite our problems, I believe the
Daily continues to be one of the best
college newspapers in the nation.
Still, the Daily suffers from an image
problem — a problem generated more
by people outside the walls of Storke
Building who are simply unaware of
what is involved with producing a news
paper, even on a small scale.
Vou see, unless you have been here to
take the thing through, it is difficult to
comprehend the myriad of problems an
editorcan encounter in agiven evening.
All you on the outside see is the Once
Around the Quad announcement you
submitted two weeks before deadline
which didn't appear; orthat story, prom
ised you by the editor in charge, which
wasn't on page 3 as expected; or that
photograph of the cast of your play
which was identified as the cast of
another.
Rightfully, you are upset with errors
and omissions. (Though frankly I doubt

you are upset by them as much as I.) And
the point is raised that no matter how
understaffed we are, no matter how
many ad offsets were missing, no matter
how many late stories had to be edited,
no matter how many other things the
editors had to do that day, there is no
excuse for screwing it up.
In all honesty, I have to agree with that
to an extent. But the word perspective
comes in here: the world seems to lose
sight of the fact that we are human. Hon
est to God, I do not sit in my office all
week long trying to figure out new ways
to anger group A or organization B. It
really does not please me to see things
go wrong.
I don't say it's an excuse for things
going wrong. Merely, when dealingwith
people here, people must keep in mind
that we are not machines programmed
to crank out a newspaper. We are stu
dents, trying to learn something. And we
are human beings with unique
backgrounds and biases.
No, it's not an excuse; it is a fact of life.
Fortunately, the Daily affords more of
an opportunity than elsewhere to do
something about problems. The fact is
that the number of errors is likely to be
higher when people have to do more
work.
So the solution is to join the staff and
make life easier for everyone. If the
community is going to demand the high
standards it deserves from an ostensibly
voluntary organization, then it must lend
a hand. I hope people will remember
that next fall.
In addition, continue to bring your
suggestions and complaints to ouratten
tion. Unless we are aware of your con
cerns, there is little we can do to remedy
problems.
That's it. My preaching session is
complete. I hope that you have found
the Daily useful during Volume 175 — at
least on occasion. Thank you for giving
me the opportunity to serve this com
munity, which I love. And thank you for
allowing me to serve this newspaper,
which I love even more.
