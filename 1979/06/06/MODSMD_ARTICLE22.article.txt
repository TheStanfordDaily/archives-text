## Overseas luxury elusive 
### 
From the "Partying '79" spe
cial issue (Daily, May 3) one
might get the impression that
Stanford overseas life is all din
ing, dallying and drinking. I,
too, shared that conviction
when I arrived at the Universi
ty's Cliveden campus in Eng
land this spring. The beautiful
gardens, the stately home and
the laid-back two-quarter vete
rans were all convincing signs
of decadent luxury.
But by the end of week one,
my fantasies of tranquility were
dispelled. Those student vete
rans were not limp with British
ale; they were battle-scarred
survivors of the overseas ex
perience. And as time passed,

the overriding theme of my ex
perience was quite simple:
"What the hell am I doing
here?"
It's not that I don't like it
here; I love it. It will almost
certainly be the most enjoyable
and practical part of my Uni
versity education. Butdon'tbe
lieve for a second that it's all
luxury. I consider myself lucky
to be alive.
The trip over augured what I
was up against. Stanford or
ganized a charming flight that
sauntered from Los Angeles to
New York to Zurich to Paris.
Sauntered, because 21-hours
of yoga positions deposited
the London-bound Clivedenites
only as far as a Paris hotel. My
diary comments, "Nice shot."
Facing a train, ferry and bus the
next morning, I swore to char
ter a cruise missile next time.
Now, you might think that
gradual immersion into foreign
lands would have eased the
cultural shock of the overseas
transition. But nothing is more
shocking than watching
throngs of "mellow" Califor
nians stampede toward John
F. Kennedy Airport's 18-and
over bars. Or easing your air
line seat back into immediate
Swiss and French cursing.
British culture soon hit me
no less gingerly. Almost hitme,
to be absolutely correct. While
crossing a street instinctively
looking left, Rolls Royces and
Triumphs skidded to a halt at
my right. They drive the other
way over here — better get
used to it, I thought.
But what happens when they
live the 'other way?" When
punk rock, pubs and potatoes
replace the American milk
shakes, Michelob and money?
When toilets flush like Mount
Vesuvius, and natives do with
out real burgers, pizza and ice
cream? When they don't even
have drinking fountains? You
get out a map and curse Welsh
city names like "Glyncorrwg."
Ah, but one should digest
the culture, not the food, I'm
told. Great. I was about to
scream "round trip" anyway. I
scavenge the house for maps,,
tea bags and English-American
dictionaries and venture out
side. After unsuccessfully
thumbing a ride for several mi
nutes, I switch to the correct
side of the road and im
mediately get a lift. My
backpack shrinks with my
pride as I squeeze into the
European world of small-car
compactness.
One thing I was unprepared
for was foreign interrogation
on American trivia. Not the
"who was the 1962 Cy Young

award-winner" type that you
have a chance at, but the "what
was the percentage crime in
crease resulting from the Arab
oil embargo in L.A. preceding
Elvis Presley's death" variety
that leave you wondering
about the question and not the
answer.
I got quite good at lying; it
was necessary to avoid con
troversy and embitterment. I
can now tell you quite with a
straight face that:
Disneyland is the happiest
place in the whole wide world,
—it never, ever rains in
California, and
—New York City is a great
town to visit.
There were other moments
when my overseas theme be
came "what is hell doing
here?" Such as when I was re
ceived at the Northern Ireland
border by British machine
guns, camouflaged soldiers
and armored vehicles. Or
when a thunderstorm eroded
away my sleeping bag founda
tion atop a Cornwall cliff. Or
when I was caught hitch-hiking
on British motorways amid
70-mph traffic, foul weather
and herds of cows and sheep.
Those were the desperate
moments when the "Any
where But Here" hitch-hiking
signs came out.
One incident epitomized my
overseas experience.
I thought I had succeeded in
escaping American billboards,
commercialism, and fast life
one day in Southern Wales. I
was engaging in warm conver
sation with a Welshman amid
rolling green hills and pacify
ing tranquility. America was
not with me on this ride, I
thought, not in fact, form, or
speed-of-life.
Suddenly, two silver flashes
pierced the scene ahead of me
with a thunder, speed and
nearness which sent me reel
ing under the dashboard. I
popped my head up to catch
glimpses of what were now two
dots on the horizon growing
ever smaller. A huge smile met
my questioning look to the
Welsh countryman. "Relax,
they're yours," he said. I re
mained befuddled, but then
suddently it hit me. Of course,
they were U.S. Air Force Fight
ers.
Now I'm asking broader
questions that I never consi
dered before. Like "What the
hell are we doing here?" I can't
wait to hit the European conti
nent.
