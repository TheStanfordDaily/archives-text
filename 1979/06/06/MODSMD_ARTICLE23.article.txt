# Three of seven schools affected
## Committees still search for deans 
### Samuel Howe 
Shake-ups and resignations over the
past year have left three of the seven
schools in the University searching for
new deans as this school year draws to a
close.
The chairman of the search committee
for a dean for the School of Education said
that a "small number of names" was sub
mitted to President Richard Lyman May 7,
and that Lyman will choose a dean from
those names shortly.
However, the chairmen of search com
mittees at the School of Business and the
School of Medicine have both said that it
will probably take a few months or longer
to make final recommendations to the
president.
Earlier this year, Geophysics Prof. Allan
Cox was named dean of the School of
Earth Sciences and will replace current
Dean Richard )ahns Sept. 1
Education search committee chairman
William Miller, former provost, withheld
the names of the candidates submitted to
Lyman, but said he expected the new dean
at the School of Education to be chosen
well before Dean Arthur Coladarci steps
down Sept. 1. Coladarci has been dean of
the No. 1 ranked School of Education for

nine years.
Hans Weiler, associate professor of
education and political science and vice
chairman of the committee, said that the
committee conducted its search begin
ning in )une ot last year. Weiler said close
to 100 names were discussed, and that the
committee "seriously considered" about a
dozen people.
The two criteria the committee used in
its consideration were "scholarly standing
and stature in the profession" and "proof
of administrative ability," according to
Weiler.
Business School Prof. Charles
Horngren, chairman of the search com
mittee there, denied a published report
which said that IBM chairman Frank Cary
would be tapped to replace Arjay Miller,
who retires as dean July 1.
The article, which appeared in the San
lose Mercury, said that Cary was a "strong
candidate" to succeed Miller. He must re
tire from IBM before January 1981. Cary,
58, received a degree from the Business
School in 1948 and has been with IBM
since then. Other figures rumored to be
under consideration include former De
fense Secretary Robert McNamara, ac
cording to the article.

However, Horngren denied the report,
saying Cary was not a candidate and that
"the committee has not talked to him." He
said that the committee is still taking
names and has already given considera
tion to almost 100 candidates. Horngren
said, "It looks like it won't be until early
fall" before a decision is reached.
Clayton Rich, former vice president for
medical affairs and dean of the Med
School, resigned his post effective )an. 1,
1979 amid controversies ranging from ques
tions over Med Center billing practices to
student dissatisfaction with a tuition hike.
On Rich's resignation, it was decided
that the twin responsibilities of his job
would be split. A search for a vice
president for medical affairs is being con
ducted before a Med School dean will be
sought.
Thomas Merigan, professor of medicine
and head of the Division of Infectious Dis
eases, heads the search committee for a
vice president.
That decision will not be reached in the
near future, Merigan said, though he ad
ded, "We hope (to have a vice president)
within six months, before the end of the
year." Merigan did say that a short list of
candidates was being developed, includ
ing "about a dozen names."
