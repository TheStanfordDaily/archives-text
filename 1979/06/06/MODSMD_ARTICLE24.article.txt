# Trustees to receive new dorm report
## 
### Mike Charlson 
The University is moving
ahead with plans to construct a
new complex of 800 under
graduate housing spaces, and a
report on the progress of the
program will be presented to
University trustees at their
meeting here next week.
Associate Dean for Residen
tial Education Norman Robin
son told members of the Ad
visory Committee on New Re
sidences that he plans to give
trustees a slide presentation on
the housing system as it pre
sently exists with the key
theme being "diversity."
Robinson said the slide show
will be followed up next fall
with more detailed plans for
the dormitory project. At that
fall meeting, the administra
tion will ask trustees to ap

prove the idea of building the
housing complex which could
cost as much as $25 million.
According to Dean of Stu
dents james Lyons, the ad
ministration had originally
planned to bring that detailed
proposal to the board this
spring, but after starting the
planning in earnest, it was
found that planning an 800-unit
facility was more difficult than
had been anticipated.
As a result, it was decided to
engage an architectural firm,
Eshrick, Homsey, Dodge and
Davis of San Francisco, as
"consultants in planning," and
plan the project more com
pletely before going to the
board for approval.
Much of the project plan
ning is going on at weekly
meetings of the Advisory

Committee. The committee,
comprised of students, faculty
and staff, is considering a host
of building proposals and eat
ing options plus additional
proposed recreational and ac
tivity facilities which some
would like to see in the hous
ing complex.
The complex, to be built in
the horse pasture west of
Lagunita Court, will probably
include three 50-person Row
Houses, a 350-per son
connected-house dormitory
similar to Lagunita and a 300-
person building of suites.
The suites are the only hous
ing option not presently a part
of the housing system, Robin
son said. Though actual num
bers are not finalized, it is ex
pected that four to six students
would share a suite, with pri
vate bedrooms for each stu
dent opening into a relatively
large common living room.

Dormitory residents would
eat in a large "Lagunita-type"
dining hall while suite resi
dents would be eating in a new
set of eating clubs to be con
structed on the site.
Last week, several represen
tatives of the architectural firm
made their first visit to campus
to tour and live in the Univer
sity housing system.
The new facility may open as
soon as September 1982,
Robinson said. Some 350
spaces in the complex will take
the place of Manzanita Park
spaces in the undergraduate
housing pool with the addi
tional spaces being incremen
tal units, making housing avail
able to more students.
Manzanita will not be torn
down under the current plan.
Instead, it will be converted
into single graduate housing
and kept in service until 1990
under current projections.
