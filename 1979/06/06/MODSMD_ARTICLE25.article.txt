A second flood saga
In addition to damage to $200,000 of carpeting, last weekend's Green Library flood left floors and
ceilings damaged and weakened by water seepage. Planners working at the site say, however, that
completion of the $12 million library facility will proceed on schedule. The building will open to
the public in January 1980.
