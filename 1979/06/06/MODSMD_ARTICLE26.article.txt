Dear Bug Me:
All over campus I've seen a small black and
white poster with the silhouette of a boy playing
a flute. There's no writing on it to identify who
put it up. What's going on here?
-E.M.
Unfortunately I can't helpyou. The posterwas
put up without University clearance, on garbage
cans, bollards, and walls all over campus. Unless
my art history serves me wrong, I think the de
sign is taken from Manet's "The Fifer," 1866.
Some in the Art Dept. believe the poster may
have been put up to promote a local arts and
crafts show, but so far as I can tell, this is conjec
ture. Officials at some local arts and crafts
societies said they didn't know anything about
the poster.
Dear Bug Me:
This is regarding wasteful and excessive light
ing at the hospital. Lights are left on in the
clinics after they close, in storage areas, and in
patient bedrooms when not in use. I've written
two letters to Gary Mecklenburg, an adminis
trator, and inquired at engineering. Nothing
seems to have changed in two months. What is
one to do?
-L.A.G.
The best thing to do, if you have the energy, is
to keep calling Dr. Richard Plancone, chairman
of the Resource Conservation Committee, at
497-6801. His committee is charged with alerting
Hospital employees of the need to conserve
energy, and communicating employee sugges
tions to the Fngineering Department for correc
tion.
Placone's committee has not met for several
weeks since it's been "waiting for the Engineer
ing Dept. to appoint someone who is responsi
ble for the electricity here."
The new man is Warren Weeks, associate di
rector of utilities, whose number is 497-5472. He
will be redesigning a number of the electrical

circuits to avoid these energy wastes.
Weeks explained that "large portions of build
ings are on one switching circuit." This means
the lights must be turned off all at once from a
central location. Redesign and new switches are
expensive, however, and "with the low rates we
get for power, it doesn't always make economic
sense" to add new hardware.
Thomas Harder, staff engineer at the Hospital,
noted that "the Univerisity will get stuck with
the cost of redesigning the circuits" in the new
wing of the Hospital.
Depending on Week's conclusions about cor
rections, and on the utility staff budget, some of
those abuses you noted may be corrected in a
month or so, Harder said.
Dear Bug Me:
I'm a visiting professor here this quarter from
Harvard, and my curiosity has been aroused by
the following phenomena. Could you please
offer explanations?
Why does the fountain in the northwest
corner of the Memorial Court not work, and why
is that electric wire attached to it?
Why are there phony snakes hanging from the
eaves of the Court in the northwest corner? If it is
to scare away the swallows, any naturalist could
have advised that swallows aren't that stupid.
L.W.
Warren Garde, building inspector for the
University, says the fountain should be working
sometime this week. It has been turned off
pending the finishing of some details on the
newly remodeled computer science building
adjacent to it.
He says the attached wire was used as a
"ground" by the phone company for an un
specified purpose, serves no function now, and
will be removed.
As tor your query about the snakes, you are
right, 1 must concede. They surely are there, but
I can't tell you why.
