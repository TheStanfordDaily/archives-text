# Tresidder worker files grievance

### David Frank 
The maintenance staff at Tre
sidder Union feel their super
visor, Facilities Manager Jeff
Nelson, should be replaced,
according to Mike Harris, pres
ident of the United Stanford
Employees (USE).
Harris, also a maintenance
worker at Tresidder, said the
workers want to replace Nel
son with Au Kau Lee, a mainte
nance worker who applied and
was rejected for the facilities
manager post.
Lee had served five months
as temporary facilities manager
before Nelson was hired.
Recently, Nelson re
primanded Lee for failing to
complete a work order. Lee
was supposed to install a motor
for the ventilation system in
Tresidder Union. Since the job
required two workers, Lee
asked Nelson for a helper, Lee
said.
Nelson offered to help him,
but Lee refused his help. Lee
said that Nelson lacked the
technical knowledge neces
sary to install the motor. The
motor, however, was success
fully installed the next morning
by Lee and a custodian helper
(assigned by Nelson) who had
no more knowledge about
how to install the motor than
Nelson himself, Lee conceded.
Nelson said he preferred not
to comment on the incident.
Lee subsequently filed a
grievance saying he was "un
justly reprimanded."
Lee was outraged. "I
couldn't believe I got this re
primand. I cannot be my
supervisor's supervisor. His
qualifications are supposed to
bebetterthan mine. Heshould
know more than I do."
Nelson blames disputes with
Lee and others on a lack of
communication.
He pointed to attempts by
Tresidder management to set
tle the differences and estab
lish a liaison between him and
the maintenance staff.
The staff's biggest demand,
according to Harris, is for the
position of a Day Lead Person.
A Day Lead, Harris said, would
act as "a buffer" between Nel
son and the staff by giving
workers their technical and
custodial orders.
Harris said the staff wanted
Lee to be the Day Lead because
of his technical knowledge and
custodial experience.
Tresidder management
didn't buy the workers' prop
osal. "We weren't convinced a
Day Lead was necessary," Ellie
Oppenheim, assistant director
of Tresidder, said.
The management instead
sent a proposal to the Person
nel Office offering to reclassify

Lee as a Technical Mainte
nance Leader. The Technical
Leader would have given Lee
'he authority to give only tech
nical orders such as ordering
materials and inspecting re
pairs.
Proposal rejected
However, the Personnel Of
fice rejected this proposal.
Harris said the workers now
want the management to either
give them the Day Lead person
or "fire us all."
Harris also added that the
management should take a
careful look at Nelson's per
formance when his job comes
up for its six-month perfor
mance evaluation this month.
Much of the problem, Harris
said, has resulted "because the
management doesn't want to
admit they made a mistake hir

ing Nelson."
The job description issued
last October for the facilities
manager vacancy called for a
person "who will be responsi
ble for custodial and technical
maintenance of . . . Tresidder
Union."
According to Harris, man
agement hired Nelson despite
the fact that Lee had "much
more" technical knowledge
and just as much custodial
maintenance ability.
"What it amounts to," Harris
said, "is that Ellie(Oppenheim)
is going to train this kid at our
expense."
Nelson was 'best candidate'
Oppenheim maintains that
she felt that Nelson was the
"best candidate" for the
facilities manager position.
"That doesn't mean there

aren't problems and that there
isn't room for improvement on
Jeff's part. But I have no inten
tion of letting hitn go."
kelson himself admitted that
"on the technical side, Lee has
more knowledge . . . I've
never had anyone as experi
enced as him working forme."
In addition to Lee's grie
vance with Nelson, Lee has
also filed state and federal
charges of racial and age dis
crimination, according to Sue
Frey, USE field representative.
Lee, who is 65 and of
Chinese ancestry, claims Tre
sidder discriminated against
him because of his age. He
filed the racial discrimination
charges because of the lack of
minority managers at Tresid
der.
