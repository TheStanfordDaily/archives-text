# Ronald McDonald House opens
## 
### Pamela Johnson 
The fifth Ronald McDonald
house in the nation was
opened here last month, and a
two-year dream became real
ity. The house, like its four
predecessors, provides a
home away from home for the
families of children receiving
treatment for catastrophic
illnesses.
For $5 a night families can
stay in one of the 13 bedrooms
with use of the community
style kitchen, family, living and
play rooms.
The idea for a house was
conceived about eight years
ago when a member of the
Philadelphia Eagles, whose son
suffered from leukemia, de
cided that parents shouldn't
have to camp out at the bed
side of their children.
With the aid of local
McDonald's restauranteurs,
the first Ronald McDonald
House came into being. Since
then houses have been
opened in Chicago, Atlanta
and Denver.
The opening of the Stanford
house, which was first prop
osed in March 1977, was the
culmination of work by the
Children's Hospital Parents
Group and 155 McDonald's re
staurant owners and operators
in the Northern California and
Northern Nevada areas.
The restauranteurs spon
sored two major fundraisers
and promotions specifically for
the house, raising a total of
$200,000.
Money from these two
fundraisers plus an additional
$100,000 of direct donations
from the McDonald's owners
and operators made complete
renovation of the house possi

ble. The parents, in charge of
furnishing the house, raised
$56,000.
Since its opening less than
three weeks ago, many families
have stayed in the Ronald
McDonald house. One parent
said, "It's beautiful to be able
to share with other parents."
loelle Davis, affectionately
described as "an ear and a
shoulder," manages the
house. Responsible for guest
registration, house mainten
ance and general operation of
the house, Davis said she was
chosen because the parents'
group wanted someone who

could relate to the parents
from a parent's perspective.
Davis, who lives with her
husband and child in an apart
ment adjacent to the house,
marvels at the families' strides
toward openness and honesty.
"The most common questions
in the kid's discussions," she
said, are usually "How many
shots do you have to get?" and
"How much blood did they
take?"
"The parents who feel they
must put up an 'everything's
okay' front at the hospital feel
comfortable enough to admit
their fears here," said Vicki

Applegate, director of com
munication at Children's Hos
pital. Applegate made the ini
tial contacts for the house
here.
Forty houses are now being
planned nationally as well as
one in Australia and Ontario.
The houses will probably all
share a common drawback if
they are anything like the local
house. This problem was cited
by one of the parents. "The
real pain," she complained, "is
when you meet and feel so
deeply about the people, and
then you have to leave."
