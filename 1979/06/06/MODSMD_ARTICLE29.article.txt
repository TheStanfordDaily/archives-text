# Savings interest to rise
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Ameri
cans will earn a quarter of a
percentage point more on
passbook savings accounts and
get even higher interest on
new, four-year accounts start
ing July 1, the nation's banking
regulators decided last week.
The three major bank
boards, in separate meetings,
also voted to eliminate
minimum deposit require
ments on certificate accounts,
except for the $10,000 money
market certificates. And they
voted to reduce penalties if
savings are withdrawn before
the certificates mature.
The actions were taken in an
effort to give Americans a bet
ter return on their savings at a
time when inflation is running
well above 10 percent and
eroding what people set aside
in savings and certificate ac
counts.
They do not, however, go as

far as the changes recom
mended by President Jimmy
Carter. The president asked
Congress to consider phasing
out all interest ceilings on sav
ings that he said "are costing
the American people billions
of dollars in lost interest annu
ally."
The actions by the Federal
Reserve Board, Federal Home
Loan Bank Board and Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. will
affect interest rates available
from commercial banks, fed
erally insured savings and loan
associations and savings
banks.
Retained in the decisions is
the traditional quarter of a per
centage point interest rate dif
ferential that thrift institutions
have been granted to help
them attract money for home
mortgages.
Still, the U.S. League of Sav
ings Associations, a trade

group, criticized the decision.
The new interest rates, it said in
a statement, "will mean an in
crease in the already-high
home mortgage interest rates
too. . . . Borrowers will have to
pay the bill." Mortgage rates
now exceed 11 percent in some
areas.
