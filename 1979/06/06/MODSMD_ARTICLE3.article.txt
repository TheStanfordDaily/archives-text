# Stanford escapes nationwide cheating crisis
## 
### Susan Owen 
Stanford is not part of the "ethics crisis" that a recent
study said is sweeping through American colleges and
universities, according to Dean of Student Affairs lames
Lyons.
The Carnegie Council of Policy Studies on Higher
Education recently released an 86-page report which
said that at least 8.8 percent of American undergraduates
feel that in order to get the grades they want some form
of cheating is necessary. This is an increase of 1.3 per
cent over 1969.
According to the council's report, "a substantial mis
use by students of public/financial aid . . . inflation of
grades by faculty members . . . competitive rewarding
of academic credits by some departments and some
institutions for insufficient and inadequate work . . .
inflated and misleading advertising by some institutions
in the search for students" have all contributed to the
so-called ethics crisis.
Many faculty members, universities and colleges are
frantically searching for students to fill the ranks of
freshman classes in the 1980s and 19905. This situation is
"likely ... to make some colleges even more reluctant
to insist on ethical conduct by students and (make the
institutions) even more likely to engage in improper
conduct themselves," according to the Carnegie report.
In April a poll conducted by The Daily Princetonian
revealed that more than one-third of Princeton Univer
sity undergraduates cheated at least once during their
four-year careers, The New York Times reported. This
figurewas significantly higherthan the one reported in a
poll conducted by the student-run Undergraduate
Honor Committee which oversees Princeton's system of
unproctored examinations, the Times said.
A survey conducted two years ago at North
Carolina State University at Raleigh indicated that 170 of
its 17,000 students cheated at least once during the
school year, yet only 35 incidents were reported, the
Washington Post reported.
Officials at the University of Maryland, eager to boost
both their national reputation and academic standards,
have turned their attention to the university's "rampant"
cheating problems, hoping to create a more efficient
honor system which will prompt more faculty members
to bring cheaters up on charges, according to the Post.
Lyons, however, said, "The rest of the world may be
getting more or less dishonest compared to us," but the
"extraordinarily" low level of dishonesty among stu
dents has been shown to have remained essentially the
same over the 15-year period between 1961 and 1976.
In 1961 a national poll was conducted by the U.S.
Office of Education in which the honesty level of the
students here ranked very high compared to other
American colleges and universities, according to Lyons.
In 1976 a Stanford survey was conducted by Sally Cole,
director of research for the Office of Student Affairs, in
which similar questions covering such topics as "pad
ding"' of bibliographies and taking an exam for another
student were asked of a random sampling of anonymous
undergraduate and graduate students here.

According to a report prepared by Cole, there was "no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976."
Lyons said, "People are always saying that things can't
possibly be as good as the golden days of yesteryear, but
they are."
When asked how often they used crib notes during an
examination, 94 percent of the students who took the
survey responded "never" in both 1961 and 1976.
Fewer students "plagiarized from published material"
in 1976 than in 1961. Some 79 percent of the students
taking the 1961 survey said they had never plagiarized
compared to 85 percent in the 1976 survey.
Also, fewer students in 1976 said they turned in papers
either partly or entirely done by other students. Some 92
percent in the 1961 survey said they had never done this,
while % percent said they hadn't in the 1976 survey.
Lyons said he believes that the consistently low level
of cheating can be attributed primarily to the Universi
ty's small size, creating a sense of pride and community
and an absence of a feeling of anonymity among stu

dents.
"If you were to go into a huge lecture room with
perhaps 700 other students, chances are you wouldn't
know the person sitting next to you. There would be
little chance fora feeling of commitment or responsibil
ity; you wouldn't care if he saw you cheat, and he
wouldn't care either. But if you knew him, you wouldn't
do something which would lower his esteem for you."
Lyons added that "students generally said they hadn't
cheated, nor had they ever seen anybody else cheat, yet
they felt that cheating must be going on."
There was also a notable drop (from 25 percent to 10
percent) in the number of students who said they would
either report an offender or ask that he report himself.
There was also a drop (from 76 percent to 46 percent) in
"expressed support for value statements concerning
honesty, especially those with a universal toneâ€”e.g.,
'Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified,"'
Cole said.
may be linked to what Ombudsman John Goheen refers
to as the "invisibility" of the Honor Code. "Most stu
dents," Goheen said, "do not have a careful knowledge
of the Honor Code. Rather, they have a vague idea that
something like this exists."
According to Cole's report, only 13 percent of the
undergraduates described themselves as "well-in
formed about the obligations of the Honor Code," while
83 percent cited the signing of the blue books as their
single greatest source of information about the Honor
Code.
The effectiveness of the Honor Code must neverthe
less rest with what the people in the system tolerate, not
with the system itself, Lyons said. Unlike the proctoring
system used by Harvard for generations, the Stanford
honor system forces students to take responsibility for
the collective enforcement of honor onto themselves
and avoids placing faculty members into the roles of
"academic policemen," Lyons said.
"The Honor Code can only reflect the dominant values
of the institution. It doesn't shape them, but reinforces
them and reminds students and faculty that we feel this
way," he added.
Lyons said he believes that most students would be
"very upset" if they observed a decline in the integrity of
Stanford's scholarship.
"Most students that come here are not interested in
playing games or representing someone else's work as
their own, but in finding out what their professors really
think about their work. A student probably wouldn't
react if his roomate failed to footnote a few sentences in
a paper. But if he saw him copy his paper word-for-word
out of a dusty old journal, he'd react."

83 percent cited the signing of the blue books as their
single greatest source of information about the Honor
Code.
The effectiveness of the Honor Code must neverthe
less rest with what the people in the system tolerate, not
with the system itself, Lyons said. Unlike the proctoring
system used by Harvard for generations, the Stanford
honor system forces students to take responsibility for
the collective enforcement of honor onto themselves
and avoids placing faculty members into the roles of
"academic policemen," Lyons said.
"The Honor Code can only reflect the dominant values
of the institution. It doesn't shape them, but reinforces
them and reminds students and faculty that we feel this
way," he added.
Lyons said he believes that most students would be
"very upset" if they observed a decline in the integrity of
Stanford's scholarship.
"Most students that come here are not interested in
playing games or representing someone else's work as
their own, but in finding out what their professors really
think about their work. A student probably wouldn't
react if his roomate failed to footnote a few sentences in
a paper. But if he saw him copy his paper word-for-word
out of a dusty old journal, he'd react."
Stanford is not part of the "ethics crisis" that a recent
study said is sweeping through American colleges and
universities, according to Dean of Student Affairs lames
Lyons.
The Carnegie Council of Policy Studies on Higher
Education recently released an 86-page report which
said that at least 8.8 percent of American undergraduates
feel that in order to get the grades they want some form
of cheating is necessary. This is an increase of 1.3 per
cent over 1969.
According to the council's report, "a substantial mis
use by students of public/financial aid . . . inflation of
grades by faculty members . . . competitive rewarding
of academic credits by some departments and some
institutions for insufficient and inadequate work . . .
inflated and misleading advertising by some institutions
in the search for students" have all contributed to the
so-called ethics crisis.
Many faculty members, universities and colleges are
frantically searching for students to fill the ranks of
freshman classes in the 1980s and 19905. This situation is
"likely ... to make some colleges even more reluctant
to insist on ethical conduct by students and (make the
institutions) even more likely to engage in improper
conduct themselves," according to the Carnegie report.
In April a poll conducted by The Daily Princetonian
revealed that more than one-third of Princeton Univer
sity undergraduates cheated at least once during their
four-year careers, The New York Times reported. This
figurewas significantly higherthan the one reported in a
poll conducted by the student-run Undergraduate
Honor Committee which oversees Princeton's system of
unproctored examinations, the Times said.
A survey conducted two years ago at North
Carolina State University at Raleigh indicated that 170 of
its 17,000 students cheated at least once during the
school year, yet only 35 incidents were reported, the
Washington Post reported.
Officials at the University of Maryland, eager to boost
both their national reputation and academic standards,
have turned their attention to the university's "rampant"
cheating problems, hoping to create a more efficient
honor system which will prompt more faculty members
to bring cheaters up on charges, according to the Post.
Lyons, however, said, "The rest of the world may be
getting more or less dishonest compared to us," but the
"extraordinarily" low level of dishonesty among stu
dents has been shown to have remained essentially the
same over the 15-year period between 1961 and 1976.
In 1961 a national poll was conducted by the U.S.
Office of Education in which the honesty level of the
students here ranked very high compared to other
American colleges and universities, according to Lyons.
In 1976 a Stanford survey was conducted by Sally Cole,
director of research for the Office of Student Affairs, in
which similar questions covering such topics as "pad
ding"' of bibliographies and taking an exam for another
student were asked of a random sampling of anonymous
undergraduate and graduate students here.

According to a report prepared by Cole, there was "no
convincing evidence that the level of individual acts of
cheating has changed between 1961 and 1976."
Lyons said, "People are always saying that things can't
possibly be as good as the golden days of yesteryear, but
they are."
When asked how often they used crib notes during an
examination, 94 percent of the students who took the
survey responded "never" in both 1961 and 1976.
Fewer students "plagiarized from published material"
in 1976 than in 1961. Some 79 percent of the students
taking the 1961 survey said they had never plagiarized
compared to 85 percent in the 1976 survey.
Also, fewer students in 1976 said they turned in papers
either partly or entirely done by other students. Some 92
percent in the 1961 survey said they had never done this,
while % percent said they hadn't in the 1976 survey.
Lyons said he believes that the consistently low level
of cheating can be attributed primarily to the Universi
ty's small size, creating a sense of pride and community
and an absence of a feeling of anonymity among stu

dents.
"If you were to go into a huge lecture room with
perhaps 700 other students, chances are you wouldn't
know the person sitting next to you. There would be
little chance fora feeling of commitment or responsibil
ity; you wouldn't care if he saw you cheat, and he
wouldn't care either. But if you knew him, you wouldn't
do something which would lower his esteem for you."
Lyons added that "students generally said they hadn't
cheated, nor had they ever seen anybody else cheat, yet
they felt that cheating must be going on."
There was also a notable drop (from 25 percent to 10
percent) in the number of students who said they would
either report an offender or ask that he report himself.
There was also a drop (from 76 percent to 46 percent) in
"expressed support for value statements concerning
honesty, especially those with a universal toneâ€”e.g.,
'Under no circumstances is cheating ever justified,"'
Cole said.
may be linked to what Ombudsman John Goheen refers
to as the "invisibility" of the Honor Code. "Most stu
dents," Goheen said, "do not have a careful knowledge
of the Honor Code. Rather, they have a vague idea that
something like this exists."
According to Cole's report, only 13 percent of the
undergraduates described themselves as "well-in
formed about the obligations of the Honor Code," while
83 percent cited the signing of the blue books as their
single greatest source of information about the Honor
Code.
