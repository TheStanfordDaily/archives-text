I was a little dubious about
driving to San Jose to review
the Menara Moroccan Re
staurant, with gas lines what
they are. But once there I was
treated to one of the most de
licious, and certainly the most
relaxing dinner I have ever
eaten.
As I walked in the front door
I was overwhelmed by the
spaciousness and opulence of
the interior. The ceilings have
been wallpapered in rich
brown patterns, and the floors
covered with plush, red carpet.
In the center of the foyer is a
large, in-ground fountain
made of white tile.
One has the choice of sitting
on luxurious couch sections
which run along the entire
perimeter of the dinning room
or leather floor cushions which
are strewn around the outside
half of the low dining table.
The seating is very comfortable
and open for improvisation —
rearrange the pillows around if
you like.
The menu was a confusion of
French for me, but part of the
fun of the dining ceremony
was having the waiter explain
the different dishes. There are
three complete dinners from
which to choose: Le Diner Me
nara ($13.95), the specialty of
the house, features lamb and
chicken. Le Diner Rabati
($14.95) features hare and
lamb. And the other dinner
($12.95) offers the choice of
one entree from six, among
them Brochette de Kabab,
Tajine de Lapin Paprika (hare
and paprika), and Tajine
d'Agneali Camama (lamb and
onions). The only stipulation is
that all the guests at one table
partake of the same dinner.
Before the meal, an exotic
teapot and golden urn are
brought to the table for the
traditional hand washing since
almost the entire meal is eaten
with the fingers.

The opening salad, Salade
Marocaines, is a spicy mixture
of finely chopped bell peppers
and tomatoes spread out on a
serving plate with an eggplant
and lettuce centerpiece.
B'stila, the appetizer, is a tan
talizing combination of bone
lesschicken, almonds, and egg
in a thin pastry dough topped
with powdered sugar and cin
namon — delicious.
The first entree, Tajine de
Poulet aux Citrons (chicken
with lemons), is a whole rock
cornish game hen, to be
shared by two people, cooked
in a ginger sauce, that is so
tender and juicy it just falls off
the bones.
Lham Mrhosia (lamb with
honey), the second entree, is

lamb served in honey with
whole almonds — very tasty
and my favorite.
Couscous aux legumbres
(the vegetables), is an assort
ment of cooked carrots, bell
peppers,zucchini, raisins, and
garbanzo beans on a bed of
finely chopped rice.
Throughout the meal
freshly baked Moroccan
bread is brought to the table.
A plate of fresh fruit, consist
ing of several apples,
tangerines, digs, dates, and a
banana is served for dessert.
To top off the evening a very
refreshing glass of mint tea
(The a la Menthe) is served,
which leaves the diner feeling
very warm and content.
The Menara Moroccan Re

staurant was started two years
ago by Pravin Patel, Shivlal
Patel, and Arvind Shah. The
three owners did all the in
terior design and decorating
themselves.
The restaurant was a visual
and gastronomic delight. We
had plenty of time to enjoy the
Moroccan feast, taking over
twoand a half hoursfordinner,
and at no time did we feel
rushed. The prices are expen
sive, but the food is excep
tional.
The restaurant is open every
night, except Sunday, from 6 to
10 for dinner. On Friday and
Saturday evenings it features
belly dancers. Reservations are
recommended.
