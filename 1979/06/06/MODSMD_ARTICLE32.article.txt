Caravansary Restaurant is all
that its name implies. Mid East
ern, relaxing, delicious — it is a
more pleasant oasis in San
Francisco, a city of overpriced
unauthentic foreign restaur
ants.
Caravansary began seven
years ago as a small coffee store
in Berkeley and has expanded
to include the three-story Sut
ter Street establishment whose
first two floors sell gourmet
coffee, cuisine and cookware,
while the third floor features
the restaurant itself. Caravan
sary owners also sell gourmet
coffee in Mill Valley, and have
just opened the Orient Express
Restaurant at 1 Market Plaza.
Caravansary Restaurant's
owners (Kajag and Hildy Sar
kissian, Ortrun Neiser, and
Setrark Injaian, who is also a
chef) are themselves Middle
Eastern. Injaian has been in the
United States for 20 years, and
his success story seems as im
pressive as Caravansary's. Al
though his father was a cook

for royalty in Jerusalem, Injaian
himself began his culinary
career in America as a bus boy
at Khayyam.
However, when tasting In
jaian's cusines, one becomes
certain that his advancement
has been based on merit. The
cuisine at Caravansary Re
staurant is excellently pre
pared, and according to my
Lebanese companion, served
in the true Middle Eastern
style.
Our meal did not begin with
the ordinary offering of soup
and salad so relentlessly served
at less distinctive restaurants.
Rather, Caravansary offers an
unusual selection of Middle
Eastern cold hors d'oeuvres
served with crispy pita bread.
The Tabuleh, made from bul
ghar wheat, chopped parsley,
onions and tomatoes was spicy
yet not overpowering and its
flavor was most unusual. The
second dip, Tammon, was
made from garbanzo beans,
and while tasty, its flavor was
not so exotic. Babaghannish,
the third appetizer, was our
favorite. Made from eggplant
and sesame seeds, it had the

consistency of and tasted a lit
tle like, an onion dip, yet its
flavor was richer, spicier and
more interesting.
However, my entree, Chic
ken Tebaka ($8.50) was quite
unique. This boneless breast of
chicken was marinated for 24
hours in pomegranate juice,
then pressed and baked in
lemon butter, garlic and herbs.
It was well prepared, yet its
tomato taste was too over
powering. These exotic chic
ken dishes change daily. The
other two poultry entrees of
fered are Chicken Ceras which
is stuffed with raisin, wild rice,
and pinenut and baked in dark
rum and sherry sauce; and
Chicken Tsi Tsi Celli which is
baked in pomegranate sauce
and crushed walnuts.
While the Mantar Kabob was
more familiar tasting, it was
unusually good. This generous
portion of charbroiled top
round of lamb stuffed with
mushrooms was tender and
generous, its seasoning flavor
ful yet subtle.
From Caravansary's dessert
list which included cheese
cake and Baklava, we chose

chocolate mousse, which was
extremely thick and smooth,
rich and chocolaty, yet not too
sweet. With our desert we
were also served Cafe
Amaretto, just one of Caravan
sary's coffees, which was
equally good.
Caravansary merits its name
simply for its well-prepared au
thentic Middle Eastern food,
but also for its attractive decor
and efficient, personable ser
vice.
The waiters themselves are
hospitable and make one feel
most comfortable. Eager to
explain the different entrees,
they are more than courteous
and concerned, they are shyly
sweet. When one learned that
my companion was Lebanese,
he brought us a brandy, pulled
up a chair and attempted to
converse with us in broken En
glish.
Personable, yet respectful,
this waiter embodies Caravan
sary's special oasis spirit of re
laxation and fine dining, so un
ique in the unauthentic and
ordinary restaurant world.
