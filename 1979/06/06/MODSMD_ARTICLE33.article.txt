# Elegant French cuisine subtlety for the wealthy

L'Orangerie
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
(415) 776-3600
Driving east on O'Farrell in
San Francisco there are several
blocks crammed with peep
shows, stores and massage par
lors. Just as you reach the end
of this strip, where there could
be one last sleezy restaurant,
there is instead L'Orangerie. A
very elegant, very French re
staurant serving classical haute
cuisine. The first indication
that this is not a peep show
joint is the very tidy tan awning
stretching across the sidewalk

from front door to the valet
parking sign ($2.75 for the
evening).
The valet parking charge is
indicative of two guidelines for
the evening. First, everything is
a la carte — a separate (addi
tional) price for each item,
from parking to entree to side
dish. Second, a guideline
which effectively overrides the
first: cast aside all considera
tions about cost; frugality is
anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie.
In keeping with its name,
L'Orangerie is decorated as if it
were located amidst an orange
grove. The illusion of a white
trellis is created along the walls
of the long, rectangular dining
room. The tables are arranged
in two rows, with a central aisle
leading from front door to
kitchen. Mydinnerpartnerand
I sat side by side on a two
person couch facing the rest of
the room. The room was small
enough, and the couch soft
enough to create a very com
fortable elegance.
With menus in hand, and
with the assistance of a very
kind maitre d' hotel, we or
dered the Sole du Pas-de-
Calais Meuniere ($14.25) and
Carre de Pore a L'Orangerie
($10.50), with Asperges Hol
landaise (asparagus on the
side, $4 per person). For an ap
petizer we sampled the Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup,
$3). Each portion of the meal
was beautifully presented.
The soup arrived in its own
tureen with enough for a sec
ond and third helping. It had a
very smooth texture and gentle
flavor. The Salade Panachee
bore no resemblance to the
average green salad. It con
sisted of sliced mushrooms, ar
tichoke hearts, celery, water
cress and no lettuce, in a light
vinaigrette sauce.

The presentation of the en
trees at the table was classically
done. The sole was skillfully
cooked at the table side. And
indeed it tasted as good as it
looked. A large, rolling table
with a warming compartment
contained the Carre de Pore, or
pork ribs. A very long, slender
rib roast was revealed when
the cover was rolled back. Sev
eral slices were cut off the end,
carefully arranged on the plate,
and covered with an orange
and cognac sauce. This dish is
the house specialty and is ex
cellently done. The pork is cut
in thin strips, is of a good tex
ture, and the sauce is a delicate
combination of flavors.
After our entrees, our as
paragus, our wine and a short
respite, we moved on to de
ssert. Although we are long
time devotees of the Souffle
Grand Marnier, we passed it up
this time for the Souffle aux
Framboises (with strawberries,
$5 per person). The fruit flavor
was very delicate and light —
an excellent souffle. This
seemed an especially good way
to end this dinner. It was sweet
as are desserts, but light and
fresh enough so that it doesn't
make the diner uncomfortably
full.
Without the wine and a
cocktail before dinner, our bill
totaled $52. With beverage, tax
and tip it was almost $80 for
two.
The theme in flavors at
L'Orangerie is discretion. No
thing in the dinner assaults
your palate. Eat slowly and let
the tastes linger. For the palate
cultured in haute cuisine, this
is undoubtedly a fine restaur
ant. For the less refined appe
tites, the subtleties and the
price may make L'Orangerie
the wrong choice for a San
Francisco dinner.

petizer we sampled the Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup,
$3). Each portion of the meal
was beautifully presented.
The soup arrived in its own
tureen with enough for a sec
ond and third helping. It had a
very smooth texture and gentle
flavor. The Salade Panachee
bore no resemblance to the
average green salad. It con
sisted of sliced mushrooms, ar
tichoke hearts, celery, water
cress and no lettuce, in a light
vinaigrette sauce.

The presentation of the en
trees at the table was classically
done. The sole was skillfully
cooked at the table side. And
indeed it tasted as good as it
looked. A large, rolling table
with a warming compartment
contained the Carre de Pore, or
pork ribs. A very long, slender
rib roast was revealed when
the cover was rolled back. Sev
eral slices were cut off the end,
carefully arranged on the plate,
and covered with an orange
and cognac sauce. This dish is
the house specialty and is ex
cellently done. The pork is cut
in thin strips, is of a good tex
ture, and the sauce is a delicate
combination of flavors.
After our entrees, our as
paragus, our wine and a short
respite, we moved on to de
ssert. Although we are long
time devotees of the Souffle
Grand Marnier, we passed it up
this time for the Souffle aux
Framboises (with strawberries,
$5 per person). The fruit flavor
was very delicate and light —
an excellent souffle. This
seemed an especially good way
to end this dinner. It was sweet
as are desserts, but light and
fresh enough so that it doesn't
make the diner uncomfortably
full.
Without the wine and a
cocktail before dinner, our bill
totaled $52. With beverage, tax
and tip it was almost $80 for
two.
The theme in flavors at
L'Orangerie is discretion. No
thing in the dinner assaults
your palate. Eat slowly and let
the tastes linger. For the palate
cultured in haute cuisine, this
is undoubtedly a fine restaur
ant. For the less refined appe
tites, the subtleties and the
price may make L'Orangerie
the wrong choice for a San
Francisco dinner.

L'Orangerie
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
(415) 776-3600
Driving east on O'Farrell in
San Francisco there are several
blocks crammed with peep
shows, stores and massage par
lors. Just as you reach the end
of this strip, where there could
be one last sleezy restaurant,
there is instead L'Orangerie. A
very elegant, very French re
staurant serving classical haute
cuisine. The first indication
that this is not a peep show
joint is the very tidy tan awning
stretching across the sidewalk

from front door to the valet
parking sign ($2.75 for the
evening).
The valet parking charge is
indicative of two guidelines for
the evening. First, everything is
a la carte — a separate (addi
tional) price for each item,
from parking to entree to side
dish. Second, a guideline
which effectively overrides the
first: cast aside all considera
tions about cost; frugality is
anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie.
In keeping with its name,
L'Orangerie is decorated as if it
were located amidst an orange
grove. The illusion of a white
trellis is created along the walls
of the long, rectangular dining
room. The tables are arranged
in two rows, with a central aisle
leading from front door to
kitchen. Mydinnerpartnerand
I sat side by side on a two
person couch facing the rest of
the room. The room was small
enough, and the couch soft
enough to create a very com
fortable elegance.
With menus in hand, and
with the assistance of a very
kind maitre d' hotel, we or
dered the Sole du Pas-de-
Calais Meuniere ($14.25) and
Carre de Pore a L'Orangerie
($10.50), with Asperges Hol
landaise (asparagus on the
side, $4 per person). For an ap
petizer we sampled the Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup,
$3). Each portion of the meal
was beautifully presented.
The soup arrived in its own
tureen with enough for a sec
ond and third helping. It had a
