# Margaret Jacks Hall: Comp Sci, Boys Town get a new $6.5 million home
## 
### 
A dilapidated old Quad building, affectionately known
as 460, and $6.5 million can combine, with sufficient
reflux time and heat, to make beautiful music together.
It's true. The University proved it with Margaret Jacks Hall,
the newly opened, reconstructed Building 460.
The new structure, which took 2V2 years to complete,
houses the Computer Science Dept. and the Boys Town
Center. And though it is still in what the University terms
"the activation phase/' the building's beauty is evident.
The old charm of the Quad is preserved as you
approach the heavy wooden front doors (top left), but the
old seems to blend into the new, looking out from the
entrance (top right). The polished wood banisters and the
dim interior lighting add to the effect as does the staircase
which wraps around and down and through the central
lobby (center right).
It is expected that the building will soon be a hub of
activity, but now many rooms are pretty much empty save
for a few students taking a musical study break (bottom
right) and some lone computer enthusiasts working on a
few extra terminals (extra, that is, until the LOTS crew
discovers them) in a third-floor room (bottom left).
