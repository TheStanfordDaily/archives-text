Judge grounds DC-10s
Washington — A U.S. District Court judge told the
Federal Aviation Administration to ground all Un
registered DC-10s yesterday, but delayed the effect of
his order and the FAA halted the drafting of a directive
that would have kept the planes out of the air.
"We are not grounding the planes tonight," said FAA
spokesman Dennis Feldman.
Feldman made the announcement less than half an
hour after he had said his agency was drafting an order
that would have grounded the planes immediately. He
had said the directive would have prohibited "the air
carriers from continued operation of the DC-10 model
series aircraft."
The word from the FAA came after hours of vacillation
by government attorneys after they informally asked the
U.S. Court of Appeals to delay the effect of the ground
ing order issued by U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson
Jr.
Royce Lamberth, chief of the U.S. Attorney's office
civil division, said he asked the appeals court for a stay
"so we don't have to issue a grounding order tonight."
Pope challenges communist Poles
Czestochowa, Poland — In the strongest statement of
his visit home, Pope John Paul II yesterday challenged
Poland's communist government to respect religious
freedom, the full range of human rights and"the real
needs of the church."
If it does so, the pope said, there can be an "authentic
dialogue" between church and state, even though the
beliefs are "diametrically opposed" to Marxism's view of
the world.

The pope's speech put the government on notice that
the Polish church will continue to press for respect for
"the cause of fundamental human rights, including re
ligious liberty."
He delivered the 5000-word major policy address on
church-state relations to a closed meeting of Poland's 70
bishops.
It was the fourth day of the former Cardinal Karol
Wojtyla's triumpnant return to his homeland, his first
since assuming the popacy last October.
The government issued no statement on the pope's
declarations, but signs of tension appeared for the first
time as he pressed ahead with his defense of Roman
Catholics, who comprise 80 percent to 90 percent of
Poland's 35 million citizens.
USSR, China seek reconciliation
Moscow — As the U.S.-Soviet summit nears, the Soviet
Union and China, the two rival powers of the communist
world, warily approached each other yesterday with the
idea of warming their long-chilly relations.
The Soviets said they were ready to begin talks with
China this summer "aimed at reducing tensions" that
have kept the two countries feuding for two decades.
Indications from Peking were that the Chinese regarded
the idea favorably.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Peking said the Krem
lin proposal, made Monday by Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko in a memorandum to the Chinese Embassy
here, was "under study."
Market advances in busy session
New York — Paced by energy, casino and auto issues,
the stock market recorded a broad advance yesterday in
the busiest session of the past six weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 9.44
points to 831.34, its largest increase since it tallied a
14.47-point rise on May 17. Advances led declines by
almost 3-1 among New York Stock Exchange-listed is
sues.
