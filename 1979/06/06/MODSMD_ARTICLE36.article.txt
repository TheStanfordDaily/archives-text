# Board to consider Building 120
## 
### Mike Charlson 
Several construction projects, including the $10.5 mill
ion reconstruction of Building 120 in the Quad, are ex
pected to receive approval from the Board of Trustees
when it meets next week.
Building 120, expected to house the Communication
and Sociology Depts. following refurbishing, will be the
third major reconstruction project on the front outer
Quad in recent years, and it will be the most expensive,
by about $2.5 million.
The project is being funded from three sources: (1) a
$2 million gift from the Irvine Foundation, (2) $4.1 mill
ion from University capital reserves and (3) $4.5 million
from money borrowed through the California Educa
tional Facilities Authority.
Bids for the project will be accepted starting in August
with completion expected by September 1981.
Trustees are also expected to approve a $313,000 pro
ject to expand University Stores and the Athletic Dept.'s
Intercollegiate Sports Weight Training program.
Though unrelated in function, both programs need

additional space, so it was decided to ask the board to
approve an addition on the Stores' Bonair Siding facility
which the two will share. The site will allow access to the
weight training facility from sports playing fields near
there and will also be convenient to the stores facility.
University Stores acts as the supply outlet for the en
tire University.
Completion of the project is expected by September.
In other matters, the board will be asked to approve
budgets totalling $24 million for next year's auxiliary
activities including the Athletic Dept., Tresidder Union,
the Student Housing and Food Service and the Univer
sity Press.
Overall, the auxiliaries plan to break even, save a
$53,000 deficit from the Student Housing and Food Ser
vice. Much of that deficit will result from pressure on the
budget for money needed to repairold residences. Next
year, over $1.8 million will be spent from the repair
reserves to upgrade older residences, according to the
proposed budget.
