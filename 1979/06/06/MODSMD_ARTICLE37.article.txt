Burglar convicted
A Mountain View man, arrested for a series of dormit
ory burglaries last Valentine's Day, was found guilty of 8
of 9 counts, Stanford Police Services Detective Don Lillie
reported.
Danny Dominguez, 33, of 2175 University Ave., Moun
tain View, was found guilty Friday by San Jose Superior
Court Judge Marilyn Zurcher.
Fourteen student witnesses were heard during the
trial, Lillie said.
Court records showed that Dominguez prowled vari
ous campus dormitories in the Stern-Wilbur-Cowell
area of campus, taking small amounts of cash from wal
lets and purses.
Dominguez also was on probation from a previous
conviction and a charge of violation of probation was
added to the others, Lillie said.
Judge Zurcher set sentencing for later this month.

Canine craze
Freshman Bruno Bauer is recovering from an eight
inch gash to his right buttock after a drunk Doberman bit
him Friday. Bauer and freshman Brad Armstrong, resi
dents of Florence Moore, were playing frisbee outside
the dorm after dinner Friday. A keg of beer was sitting on
the lawn with a catch basin beneath it. The unidentified
dog, which had been playing with the students and
lapping up the beer, then bit Bauer.
The dog was taken to County Animal Patrol for obser
vation, according to Stanford Police Services Detective
Don Lillie. It is quite unlikely the dog has rabies, Lillie
added.
