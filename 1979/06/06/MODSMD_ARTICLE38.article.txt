# Cardinals strive for AIAW title

Stanford's women's tennis team
wraps up its season this week at the
AIAW Championship at the Univer
sity of lowa. Stanford, the defending
champion, is seeded third in the
tournament behind top-ranked USC
and UCLA.
After winning the national title last
year, Stanford returned six of seven
starters, the only loss to graduation
being No. 6 Nancy Rudd. The retur
ners included AIAW singles finalist,
doubles champion and team Most
Valuable Player Kathy Jordan, her sis
ter, doubles champion Barbara Jor
dan, two-time National Doubles
Champions and 1978 singles quarter
finalists Susie Hagey and Diane
Morrison and the winner of the deci
sive doubles match in the AIAW team
final, Donna Rubin and Caryn Hertel.
Besides these starters Marianne
Ingard, Corinne Nevinny and Pat
Varga were also returning from the
National Championship team.
The team also had an excellent re
cruiting year. Alycia Moulton headed
the list of first-year players. Moulton,
ranked sixth in the junior ranks and
second among high schoolers was
touted as one of the most talented
players ever to come to Stanford. Sue
Rasmussen and Julia Leighton,

ranked No. 18 and No. 35 respec
tively in national junior play,were the
others.
Lisa Cordon, the No. 6 ranking
player in Northern California, and
Andrea Markl rounded out the
freshman class.
The Cardinals and USC, who no
doubt had perhaps the best recruit
ing year in women's tennis, both
looked stronger than last year and it
seemed almost taken for granted that
the two teams would once again
meet in the team finals at lowa to
decide who was No. 1.
A severe blow was dealt to the
Card women before the season even
began. Three time All-American Bar
bara Jordan decided to pass up her
final year of eligibility and join the
pro ranks.
The Cards nonetheless had a rela
tively easy time with their first six op
ponents, winning the matches by
lopsided scores.
Lady Luck however did not help
the Cards out in the crucial matches.
A shoulder injury to Morrison
limited the talented senior in the
USC match, which helped the Tro
jans escape with a 5-4 win.
One week after the home matches
against the Southern California
school, Morrison announced that

she was leaving the team in order to
try to qualify for Wimbledon next
month.
The loss of Jordan and Morrison
meant the elevation of Rasmussen
and Hertel into starting positions.
Rasmussen responded with a 6-3
dual match record while Hertel was
5-1 prior to the final regular season
match with UCLA.
The Cards however dropped a 5-4
decision to UCLA to close out at 9-4
overall. Despite the close score the
match was decided early. The Bruins
won 5 of the six outdoor matches to
clinch the match before Jordan and
Moulton made the score respectable
by taking all three of the indoor
matches.
Coach Ann Gould, who an
nounced her resignation last week to
complete work on her master's de
gree, is nonetheless optimistic about
the team's chances to repeat as Na
tional Champions.
"Despite our losses to USC and
UCLA, we feel we have a chance to
retain the national title," she said.
The competition in the tournament
will be strong, but with the talent,
experience and poise present on our
team, we could reach the finals and
come through with another champ
ionship."
The Cards are led by sophomore
Jordan, who is currently the top
ranking amateur in the world and
No. 14 among the Women's Tennis

Association professional rankings.
Moulton should also be among the
top five seeds. Moulton, who com
piled a perfect 7-0 record in her first
year on the Farm, established herself
as the top freshman in the country by
defeating the top-ranked freshman
Maria Fernandez twice in dual
matches and UCLA's No. 1 player,
All-American Dana Gilbert, in tour
nament action.
Hagey, 5-4 on the year will be
closing out a fine college career this
week. She is the only senior on the
team.
Rounding out the starters for the
AIAW Championships are Rubin,
Rasmussen and Hertel. The doubles
pairing are Jordan-Moulton (5-0),
Hagey-Rasmussen (0-0) and Rubin-
Hertel (1-1).
After easily winning the regional
qualifying and finishing the regular
season undefeated, Jordan and
Moulton seem to be the team to beat
in the individual tournament.
The Cards may be hurt though, in
doubles by a lack of experience.
Rasmussen-Hagey have not played
together at all and Rubin-Hertel just
two times, although they did play to
gether last year.
If the Cards are to repeat they will
have to beat No. 6 ranked Miami to
day, UCLA tomorrow in the semi
finals and No. 1 ranked USC Friday in
the finals.
