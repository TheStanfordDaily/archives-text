# Pre-professional attitudes blamed
## Number of language majors down 
### Kathy Sheil 
In the last decade, the number of undergraduates
majoring in foreign languages here has dropped from
115 to 65, according to statistics released by the
Academic Planning Office (APO).
The change has been cited by The Stanford Observer
and Campus Report as an example of the overall decline
in the Humanities. But while the number of majors has
declined, total undergraduate course enrollment has
shown a slight increase.
While agreeing that interest in the humanities has
declined, professors from the foreign language depart
ments disagree on the extend of the decline. Calling the
statistics a "big problem," they said that the figures were
"misleading."
"They make it seem worse than it actually is," said
Walter Lohnes, chairman of the German Studies Dept.
Lohnes said, however, that there is "no doubt that,
nationwide, language figures have gone down." He
added that he sees the "recent trend toward pre
professionalism" as the cause.
Julia Maurice, a French major here, said "It's the
image of the pre-meds, pre-law, all the so-called 'good'
majors that are more 'practical'" that turn people away
from majoring in the humanities and consequently
foreign languages.
The emphasis on career-oriented education seems to
be a factor in choosing a major.
Anne Goldman, another French major, said, "In most
of the (upper division) courses I have taken, the em
phasis has been on literature. It turns people off. It's

really not a practical thing."
Goldman chose to major in French "because I want to
go into international relations, and it will help to have
the language background."
Another factor is that in the sciences, for example,
grants, fellowships and other awards for advanced study
are more easily obtained, Goldman said.
One of the reasons that total undergraduate enroll
ments have not declined along with the number of
majors is the existence of the Overseas Studies Program,
Franco said. "The campuses are very important," in this
respect, she said. "People come back very enthused to
continue."
Prof. Makoto Ueda, chairman of the Asian Languages
Dept. said that the "more rigid" requirements for a
foreign language major are probably a factor in the de
cline. Most undergraduates would have to decide early
whether to major in a foreign language and "students
like to keep their options open," he said.
An East Asian Studies major was introduced to offer a
more flexible, broadly-based alternative to the language
major, he said. "We encourage students to branch out
to other studies. We are not that concerned with the
drop in majors."
The foreign language departments have developed
different "areas of concentration" in order to make
them more flexible and to attract more majors.
These areas include language/linguistics, literature
and a combination of language, literature and fields
such as history and political science.
