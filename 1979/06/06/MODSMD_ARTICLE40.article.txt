# Card netters end satisfying season
## 
### Jeff Brandon 
"This was the most satisfying team
I've ever had here at Stanford," said
Dick Could of this year's Stanford
tennis team. "They were a young
team, but they improved every time
they walked on the court."
The Cardinals faced the toughest
schedule in the nation, matching
strokes with schools ranked in the
top eight 12 times in dual matches. In
fact, of the 23 matches played, 21
were against opponents ranked in
the nation's top 25. The Cards came
out of it all with a 19-4 record and a
third place finish in the nationals.
This was not your typical Stanford
tennis team that is right in the thick of
things all year long. Instead, this was
a late blooming team that did not es
tablish itself as a legitimate conten
der until the final weeks of the sea
son.
The season started out well
enough. In a rare move Gould
emptied his bench and used 11
players in handing UC-lrvine a
bV 2 -2Vi loss.
The Cards ran into trouble. Nine
years running Stanford had won the
Northern California Intercollegiate
Tournament and once again, this
year they were the favorite. How
ever, California, boasting their best
team in years, pulled off several key
upsets and won the title easily. The
Cards had some standout perfor
mances though. Matt Mitchell
reached the singles finals before a
bad back forced him to default. Jim
Hodges reached the semifinals be
fore losing to Mitchell and the
freshman team of Tim Mayotte and
Scott Bondurant took the doubles ti
tle.
Then on March 6, following a 9-0
whitewashing of Foothill, Mitchell,
co-captain of the team, announced at
a special team meeting that he had
decided to skip the rest of his senior
year and join the pro circuit. This
coupled with the fact that three
year-starter John Rast had been out
since November with a slipped disc,
left junior Peter Rennert as the lone
singles starter from last year's dream
team.
Two days later the Cards defeated
San Jose for the team's 40th straight

dual match win and No. 200 in the
career of coach Gould.
The Cards then traveled to Los
Angeles for their annual run-in with
USC and UCLA who were at the then
No. 1 and No. 2 rank positions in the
country.
The Cards continued to struggle.
They barely defeated Cal 5-4 at Ber
keley and finished second at Ojai,
largely on the strength of Rennert
and Lloyd Bourne taking the doubles
title. It wasn't until May that the
Cards really got on track. However,
by this time they had dropped to No.
7 in the national rankings.
Off their final showing against
UCLA the Cards earned the No. 4
seeding in the NCAA tournament.
They defeated Michigan 7-2 and pre
viously undefeated Princeton 7-2,
before losing to UCLA 6-2. They
came back the next day to defeat the
same SMU team that had beaten
them badly earlier.easily 6-3 to take
third place honors.
The outlook for next year can be
nothing but bright for Stanford's
netmen. The Cards lose but two
seniors, and return their entire start
ing lineup. It will be a dogfight bet
ween Bourne, Mayotte and Rennert
for the top spot next year.
Outside the top three it appears to
be wide open, although Bondurant,
Arons and Hodges have the inside
track right now. The competition
promises to be fierce. Sophomores
Alan Blumberg, Andy Chase, Greg
Hing and Jeff Jones have endured
two years on the bench and will
come back determined to reach the
top six.
John Corse, undefeated in his high
school career, spent the year on the
sidelines trying to make the transi
tion to the college game, while junior
Peter Morris tried to get back into
things after a two year layoff.
The top athlete on the team, Jim
Miller, lacks tournament experience
but will be getting that this summer
and could challenge for a starting
spot. Add to that list incoming
freshman David Siegler who won the
Southern California Pro Circuit this
winter after graduating early. So, the
Cards once again will be stacked next
year and they won't be happy finish
ing third.
