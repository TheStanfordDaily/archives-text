# Tracksters' showings sometimes spectacular

The Stanford men's track team did not enjoy a highly victorious season this
spring. There were great moments, new stadium and meet records set, and
personal bests dropped consistently. But a tough schedule combined with
numerous injuries hurt the Cardinals as the season aged.
To start things off, San Jose State downed the Cards 89-64 in San Jose.
Stanford coach Payton Jordan's strongest runners, whom he believed to be
the real point gatherers of the team, were edged by San Jose track men.
But from there the Cards went on a winning streak downing Hayward
twice (110-52, 92-71), Fresno (111-51) and Occidental (100-53). The field
events were improving with every meet. Darrin Nelson was overwhelming in
the long jump with jumps of 25'4Vi". Clay Bullwinkel had come into his own
on the triple jump with jumps of 25' plus. Brian Holloway and Rick Buss
formed a one-two punch in the shot put and discus, Holloway putting 52'11"
for a lifetime best and Buss flinging the discus 172' 2".
On the track, talented freshmen balanced out several consistent perfor
mers from the upper classes. Bill Gail logged an 8:53.6 in the 3000-meter
steeple chase, Rod Berry had several good days in the 5000-meter run, and
the team of Mark Stillman and John Schaer made first and second place
finishes in the 800 look easy.
The sprinters were even more devastating in the four-meet winning streak.
In the 400-meter relay, Nelson, Ken Margerum, Gordon Banks, and Rick
Gervais ran a 40.3 and beat Hayward twice, Fresno and Occidental. Nelson
and Margerum were the stars of the 100, with Nelson, Banks, and Gervais
helping out in the 200 with an average of 23.5.
Unfortunately for the Cards, things began to go downhill after the second
Hayward meet. In the Stanford Invitational Relays San Jose State and Cal
edged the Cards in too many departments thus putting Stanford third out of
16 teams.
Then came the meet at UCLA and disaster. While attempting to better his
mark in the long jump, Nelson injured his leg badly. The Cards continued of
course, but lost 101-53.
When the word came through that Nelson was to be out for the season,
Jordan had to fill the gap. But even as he attempted this, more injuries were
being sustained. Margerum, Robert Miaocco, Gary Shumway, Gervais and
high jumper Kent Doyle were all out with minor injuries and unable to
compete at the Double Dual Meet in Berkeley against Cal, USC and UC
LA. The Cards were looking thin that day, and the lack of personnel
showed on the scoreboard. UCLA ran them down 101-53. On the road again
in Los Angeles, USC beat them 105-43. The season had taken a very ugly turn.
In the Big Meet at Stanford, Jordan did everything possible in assigning
athletes, hoping to collect points. He knew they were thin, and at a great
disadvantage against the Cal team. The opposition came in droves and the
Cards were taken by the huge margin of 117-37.
Stanford track men wouldn't give up in that meet as they refused to slow
down against USC and UCLA. Jordan had good reason to say what he did
repeatedly after each meet whether won or lost.
"This is a tough bunch, real competitors, and I'm darned proud."
