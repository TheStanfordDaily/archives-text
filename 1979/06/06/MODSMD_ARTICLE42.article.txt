# Golfer Voss' modesty well earned
## 
### John Doane 
The way Sally Voss talks about
herself, you'd think she was a dull
and uninteresting person, cer
tainly not worthy of any space in a
newspaper.
"You're doing a feature on
me?" she squeaked. "Who put
you up to this ?"
But don't let her fool you. Voss,
the only senior on this year's wo
men's golf team has collected so
many awards and trophies that se
vere arm cramps result from try
ing to write them all down. And
with her effervescent personality
and academic achievements, she
certainly has a lot to be modest
about.
Voss' recent accomplishments
on the golf course include being
named Ail-American, and winning
titles at the 1978 San Francisco City
Championships, the Maryland
State Amateur tourney, the
Washington D.C. Amateur
Championships, and the Univer
sity of Arizona tournament. In ad
dition, Voss was low medalist at
both the California State Amateur
Champioships and the Trans-

Nationals. Shewas also runner-up
at the 1979 S.F. City Champion
ships and the Arizona State Uni
versity Championships.
The Bethesda, Md. native will
tee off for the last time as a Stan
ford student later this month at
the AIAW Championships in
Stillwater, Oklahoma.
"I think we've got a fighting
chance at being in the top ten,"
said Voss. "We've really done
pretty well."
Along with sophomores Linda
Bowman and Patty Pichon,
freshmen Debbie Barbario and
Barbara Ann Wright, Voss and the
Cardinals have qualified for the
national tourney for the first time
as a team, finishing second to San
Jose State in Northern California.
But according to Voss, more
than players' talent has been re
sponsible for Stanford's rising
women's golf squad.
"We've got excellent facilities,"
said Voss, noting that Stanford is
one of two colleges in the U.S. to
have its own on-campus course.
The athletic department has
also provided the women's golf

team with a lot of support, Voss
said.
"Joe Ruetz didn't wait for Title
IX to give us backing," said Voss.
"And Andy Ceiger and Ray Young
have really helped us."
But the greatest reason for the
women's golf team's rise has been
coach Bruce Summerhays.
"Bruce has really built a suc
cessfdl program for us," said
Voss. "He's just a marvelous per
son, a fantastic coach." Sum
merhays, who also coaches the
men's team, is "one of the top
golfers in Northern California,"
according to Voss, noting that he
has represented the United
States at the Ryder Cup, and has
won several pro titles in this area.
"I wanted to leave pro golf open
as an option for next year," Voss
said. "But it looks like I'll be pretty
busy."
Voss will be "busy" at San
Diego's Medical School next fall,
where she will begin her first year
as a medical student.
"I really need to go into some
thing like medicine," said Voss.
"It will be a challenge. Being a

doctor is a continual education,
you can never get stale."
Reflecting on her years at Stan
ford, Voss noted that " one of the
most important things about Stan
ford is the setting. You can go to
San Francisco or the ballet. .
With regards to the "Stanford
image," Voss has an attitude
perhaps startling to many.
"As far as pure, intellectual
academics is concerned, I don't
think Stanford is one of the top
schools in the country," Voss
said.
Nevertheless, Voss still feels
that academics is only half of the
education. Noting that people
have to be outstanding to get
through the rigorous admissions
process here, Voss feels that
people with Stanford degrees also
have a "common sense" attractive
to many employers.
Despite her acceptance to
UCSD and several other medical
schools, Voss retains her mod
esty.
"I was lucky," she says.
.But don't let Sally Voss fool you.

SENIOR GOLFER Sally Voss has racked up numerous honors, both academic
and athletic, during her four years at Stanford. But her modesty spurred an
unlikely reaction to recognition when the near-to-be graduate asked "Who
put you up to this?"
