# Nelson determined to play ball
## 
### Mike Oneal 
Fcr two months, ever since
the Stanford-UCLA dual track
meet in March, the Stanford
campus has been waiting —
waiting to find out if the Cardi
nal's star running back, Darrin
Nelson, would be back to his
darting and spinning ways
come fall. i
Nelson tore a tendon in his
leg at the meet and there have
been rumors that he would
never play again, that he could
never play by September, and
that he would never be the
same Darrin Nelson, who in
two quick years ripped off 2000
yards and snagged 102 passes.
But, as Stanford's new head
coach Rod Dowhower said,
"News travels fast around
here," and as spring quarter
draws to a close, things are
looking up for Stanford foot
ball.
"I expect I'll be able to run

pretty well by mid-July, and I'm
sure I'll be back in the fall,"
said the 5-foot-9 sophomore.
"The leg is really strong right
now. I mean I can jog, but it
atrophied quite a bit in the cast
and I have to build it up as well
as work on extension."
The injury, a severed hamstr
ing tendon, was a serious one.
Nelson ripped the ligament
right off the bone during the
long jump as he extended off
the board. He had already won
the event, and was jumping to
beat his own record of 25-
feet-4.
"I was running like normal
and jumping like normal and it
just snapped. It really was a
freak accident," said Nelson of
the attempt.
The doctors aren't quite as
optimistic as Nelson, though
they have given him nothing
but good reports. Dr. Fred
Behling, who did the opera

tion, feels that no one will
know whether or not Nelson
can play this fall until late Au
gust.
At this point, though, the re
habilitation process is going
well and it's all pretty much up
to the Cardinal running back,
who spends from 3 to 5 hours
in the training room every day.
Coach Dowhower feels that
the optimistic Nelson can do
anything he wants to if he puts
his mind to it, and Nelson has
definitely put his mind to it.
"Human emotions are really
something," the coach said
and Nelson said he is thinking
positively.
"The only thing that gets me
down about the whole process
is that it is really boring — don't
ever hurt your leg!" he said.
Dowhower, in his first year
as head coach, is faced with a
real challenge in preparing for
the upcoming season. Not only
must he plan for a season with
out Nelson, but also a season
without linebacker Steve
Budinger and outside
linebacker Tom Hall, each of
whose return is even more
questionable than Nelson's.
Coach Dowhower is confident,
though, that the Cards can
make up for the losses if need
be.
"Stanford has a tradition of
being able to rise to the occa
sion," he said. "I'm not saying
that we can replace a man
that's gained 2000 yards and
caught 101 passes in two years
or replace the leadership Dar
rin has given us through exam
ple, but I am saying that the
whole team can take up the
slack.
"All the injuries were a blow
to me because of my high re
gard for each of the players,
not because of a win-loss re
cord."
There is no denying, though,
that the loss of a true spark like
Nelson would hurt the team as
there are so many intangibles a
player of this caliber offers any

team. Stanford can stand to
lose these players and do well,
but the loss would still be de
vastating.
Although Nelson is fully op
timistic about his leg and the
team, he is also practical.
"The offense will be just as
good as last year and the run
ning game will be better," he
said, "but as far as my playing is
concerned, if the leg is not 100
percent, then I won't play. I
expect it will be, but if not I still
have to walk when I'm done
playing football."
As far as his personal life,
Nelson, always the positive
thinker, said that it hasn't really
bothered him that much. He
has always been optimistic.
"At first all I could think was
'Why me?' but I got over that in
the hospital," he said. "The
cast was what bothered me the
most because I couldn't do the
things I normally do. People
always had to help me to move
around. But now I can move
freely and the leg doesn't
bother me at all."
This type of thinking is what
makes Nelson keep pushing
through those grueling hours
of therapy. Presumably, it is
also what makes him break out
from a pack of defenders when
it seems that all is lost only to
run for a touchdown.
"I just consider this a rest,"
Nelson said. "I needed one
anyway after football, school
work and track, and this was
just a hard way to get one. I'll
be back."
He doesn't expect to have to
give up anything as a result of
the injury, including track.
One would expect that track
would be the last thing on his
mind, but the 1978 second
team football Ail-American
with the questionable knee
said the other day, "You know,
I'm dying to just get my leg
healed and go back out to try
the long jump again just to see
if I can do it."
He'll be back.
