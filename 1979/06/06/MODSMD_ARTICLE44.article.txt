### 
The Stanford Daily Redhots,
softball giants, soundly de
feated the Administration Lac
keys last weekend to complete
their first winning season in
memory. The Daily won the
Roble Field contest 14-3.
TheDa//y, led by the pitching
of Jeff Powell and Brad
Brockbank and backed up by
an hermetically sealed infield,
held the Lackeys to only seven
hits.
Meanwhile, the Lackeys
looked hapless, especially in
the first inning when the Daily
ripped pitcher Robert
Rosenzweig, University vice
president for public affairs, for

six runs on nine hits.
The Lackey infield was paced
by Marv "Raoul" Herrington,
director of police services.
But Herrington alone could
not stop the Daily attack even
after the pressmen had con
sumed two cases of beer.
Lackey shortstop Dan Wil
liams, director of Tresidder
and Daily landlord, said he had
a bet riding on the game's out
come: if the Lackeys lose, he
said, the Daily office gets air
conditioning.
"lust kidding guys," a sweat
ing Williams said after the
game.
