The Stanford lacrosse team
won the California Collegiate
Championship by beating
UC-Santa Barbara 12-11 last
Saturday in a close game
played on the UCLA campus.
Stanford rallied from an 8-3
deficit in the second quarter to
upset the favored UCSB team
which had previously handed
the Cards their only collegiate
loss.
Stanford was led by at
tackmen Rick Valentine and
Tom Drelles, who each scored
four goals, and the outstanding
goalkeeping of tri-captain
Denny Childs. Childs was sup
ported by the strong perfor
mances of defensemen Rich
Ward, Steve Kuptz, Chuck Re
nner and Mark Melberg, who
checked Santa Barbara's pow
erful scorers.
However, the victory truly
represented a strong team ef
fort as coach Sam Sadtler's
squad, which had already lost
players due to injuries earlier
in the season, was forced to
play without several key scor
ers.
The shorthanded Stanford
team scored first, but soon was
overwhelmed by Santa Barba
ra's blistering attack which
quickly ran up eight goals.
Midway through the second
quarter Stanford's defense
came alive and began to shut
down the overconfident Santa
Barbara team.
Behind 8-5 at halftime, the
Cards continued to battle back
despite minor injuries to sev
eral midfielders including
freshman sensation Chris
Romer. However, sparked by

the scoring of Valentine, Drel
les and Romer, the Cards tied
UCSB 10-10 early in the fourth
quarter with five minutes left.
Stanford gained the lead 11-10,
but Santa Barbara quickly
equalled the score. Stanford
continued its aggressive team
play and with less than two mi
nutes remaining, Drelles
whipped a slicing shot past the
UCSB goalie for his third score
of the fourth quarter.
The sturdy Card defense
held off a desperate Santa Bar
bara team to preserve the win.
Though not officially
sanctioned beyond California,
the title effectively gives Stan
ford the Pacific Championship
as Stanford and UCSB are gen
erally recognized as the best
American collegiate lacrosse
teams on the West Coast.
The Cards had advanced to
the title game by beating UC-
Berkeley 8-3. These victories
capped a long successful 18-
week season for the Stanford
team which finished with a 13-5
overall record and a 9-1 mark in
intercollegiate play.
The team should be even
better next year as the third
man squad is only losing three
seniors to graduation.
In a California Collegiate
All-Star game which followed
Stanford'svictory the Southern
Division beat the North 10-5.
Named to the Northern All-Star
team were Stanford's goalie
Childs, attackman Valentine,
midfielders Kirk Phelps, Peter
Werner, Peter Stamats and de
fensemen Kuptz and Ward.
In addition, Childs was voted
Most Valuable Goalie on the
West Coast.
