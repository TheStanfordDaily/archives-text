# Card nine finishes fifth
## 
### Cathy Dickerson 
It just as easily could have
been the Stanford baseball
team on its way to Omaha,
Nebraska for the NCAA champ
ionship. The University of
Arizona, which finished league
play with 17 wins and 13 losses,
won the regional playoffs it
hosted and is in Omaha as the
team representing the Pac-10
conference.
UCLA, the strong first-place
finisher in the Southern Divi
sion, faced tough competition
in its regional and lost to Cal
State Fullerton in the deciding
game of its playoffs.
Stanford matched both
UCLA and Arizona in wins and
losses this year, posting two
wins and one loss against each
of the opponents at home in
Sunken Diamond and losing
two out of three to each team
on the road. But the Cardinals
completed the season with a
13-17 record iri league, a fifth
place finish, and didn't ad
vance into any playoffs.
Ten seniors leave the team

this year never having been in
post-season competition.
Bruce Fiala, Card pitcher
with 27 career wins — the most
of any pitcher in Stanford
baseball history — ends his col
lege career on a high note.
Fiala compiled a 10-win 4-loss
record his senior year: the first
10-win performance by a Stan
ford pitcher in the past eight
years.
Other pitchers graduating
include ace left hander |oe
LoPresti, Brian Harrison, Rob
Irwin, Mark Abbondola and
]erry Battenberg.
Behind the plate, the Cards
lose their first-string catcher
and most inspirational player,
Bruce Walters. John Pyle
graduates after an impressive
single season at first base, and
Mike Codiroli and Larry
Reynolds leave the outfield
after four years of varsity ac
tion.
Reynolds, one of the quieter
members of the team, closed
out the season with a running

24-game hitting streak that no
one even knew about. The
two-sport athlete batted .336
this year, drove in 31 runs and
stole 31 of 35 attempted bases.
According to assistant
baseball coach Dean Stotz, the
Cards have had a good recruit
ing year and many new faces
will appear on the diamond
next year.
Paul Zuvella will lead the
Cardinals into their second
year of Pac-10 competition next
year as a senior. Zuvella, the
second baseman who finished
the year with a .342 overall bat
ting average, 44 RBI and 15
doubles, was the only member
of the Stanford team to be cho
sen by Pac-10 coaches for the
all-league team. Zuvella also
received most valuable player
honors from the Stanford

team.
Also returning next year will
be versatile Phil Wilson, who
entered Stanford as a highly
touted shortstop, spent his
freshman year filling in for in
jured catcher Walters and this
year moved into the hot corner
at third base. Wilson has
proven himself capable at any
position and speculation is that
he may move to a new spot on
the diamond next year.
Before looking ahead to next
year — his fourth as head
coach — Mark Marquess
summed up this season saying,
"It had its disappointments,
but looking back, it was an out
standing year. I said at the start,
if we all gave 100 percent we'd
come out okay, and we have.
We really came on at the end of
the season."
