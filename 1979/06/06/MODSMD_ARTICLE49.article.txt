For the first time ever, Stanford sponsored a
women's varsity track program this year. Coach
Laurel Treon described the new phenomena as
"exciting" and noted that the season's sustained
interest of 30 members had expanded to an even
larger group by the season's finale.
Team members Ann Thrupp, Joanne Ernst,
Meg Gardiner, Therese Lamb, Annette Mungai
and )ohnna Hansen along with last year's club
sport coach Holly Houston worked toward the
establishment of a women's varsity team with
then-Athletic Director Joe Ruetz.
When AndyGeiger took the helm from Ruetz,
he "quickly" granted the desired varsity status
to women's track around March 1, Treon said.
" I he base of interest and the opportunity for a
good competitive scheduJe for our first year
has established the team," she said. "We were
representative in all of our meets, with the ex
ception of the large California Invitational."
Treon called the April 14, Stanford Invitational
the "big highlight" of the season for the team.
With a total of 57 points, Stanford garnered sec
ond place behind Hayward State's 86 tallies in
the five-team meet.
"It was outstanding team effort," but several
individuals stood out. Sophomore Colleen
Dolan picked up 10 points, as the team's high
individual scorer, in the field events. Thrupp
and Ernst gathered six individual points apiece,
and Denise Torrey earned five points.
Sophomore Andrea Cheek and freshman Hil
ary Hall chalked up nine and six notches respec
tively from combined individual-relay efforts.
"It was the meet we chose to point to for this
year," Treon said.
Evidently she was satisfied with the results of
eight season bests, four lifetime personal re
cords and 11 school records.
Another important achievement for the Cardi
nals' maiden year was Thrupp's qualification for
the Nationals in the 10,000-meters with a time of
36:24.0 minutes.

At last month's awards banquet, Ernst was
named the Most Valuable Track Athlete. She
holds the school record of 10:42 in the 3000-
meters and was a valuable member of the two
mile relay team.
Treon classified Ernst as "a consistent per
former throughout the season and a model" for
the rest of the women.
Dolan was awarded the Most Valuable Field
Award for her outstanding work in the weight
events.
"She really did a super job," Treon said of
Dolan.
Cheek was recognized as the Most Dedicated
team member and "one of our top performers."
Mungai was voted by her teammates as Most
Inspirational.
Hall, "a very versatile and extremely dedi
cated" trackster won the Coach's Award. She
created the school record in the long jump of
16'1 and Va" and ran on the 400-meter relay and
the mile relay.
"Things are looking extremely promising" for
next year, Treon said. "This is an exciting time in
the development of the sport. The women
wanted progress and did the work necessary to
get going this year.
"I have a positive attitude about the future,"
she said.
Indeed, Treon has already hauled in three top
recruits and is still pursuing junior college trans
fers for next year.
Kim Schnurpfeil, the 20th fastest high school
200-runner in the nation, Nor-Cal runner of the
year in cross-country and victor of the Nor-Cal
cross-country championships last autumn, has
already signed a letter of intent with Treon.
Pam Donald, a 19'5" long jumper with times of
11.0 in the 100-yards and 56.0 in the 440-yards,
and Mary Osborne, one of the top high school
javelin throwers in the country with a best mark
of 175'6", have also endorsed letters of intent.
"We want to become as competitive a unit as
we possibly can," Treon emphasized.
