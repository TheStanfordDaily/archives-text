A red hot manual
Pre-meds rejoice! A Stanford medical student,
Donald Solomon, has the inside line on entry into
medical school, and he lays it all out in a neat little
primer that comes complete with personal anec
dotes. Judging by Paul Weium's review on page 3,
you might want to pick up a copy of the book so you
can study it over the summer.
On the way back
No doubt that right about now you can't wait to
get back to the campus this fall. But if it makes
prospects for September any brighter, Darrin Nel
son says he's sure that he'll be back on the gridiron
for a third full season as running back. Mike Oneal
interviews the star on page 12, joining the Daily's
review of spring sports that begins on page 11.
The space cadet's spaceship
Those plastic flying disks can do amazing things
— sail, spin, turn, dip and fall. If you think you'd also
like to do that while you're throwing one of those
disks, you might want to try a combination pipe-disk
called a Buzzbee that is now available from an east
ern firm. On page 20, Brad Brockbank describes this
spin-off that lets you do just that.
Sinful and seductive
Only in the Daily, of course.
On page 14, Jim Mattson reviews a film so hor
rendous that it disgusts the bats which furnish
guano for Cinema Scope. On the same page, but on
a more positive note, Cyrus Cassells previews a new
jazz album that integrates the captivating work of
two unique musicians — Charles Mingus and Joni
Mitchell. In addition, the Daily's restaurant, jazz
and book critics take one last stab at recent produc
tions, reminding us that the entertainment of sum
mer is just around the corner.
