# Crew strokes to season's end

Stanford Crew brought the 1979 racing season to a close May 30
with an awards banquet and party.
Of the trophy recipients, Ken Radtke received the Most Valu
able Freshman award for stroking the first frosh-8. Dan Leonard,
the only sophomore on the varsity-8 received the Most Improved
award. Kirk Wilson, a senior and seven man on the varsity-8,
received the Length and a Half Fast award for outstanding service
to the crew both on and off the water.
Frosh coach Mark Crosenbaugh presented a new award, the
Co-Captain Plaque, to senior Trey Nicoud, who was also desig
nated Most Valuable Oarsman. Co-Captain Nicoud will be re
placed by Fred Storey. Graduating captain Tom "Captain Car
mack" Saftig will be replaced by Carl Taussig.
Saftig was also named to the all Pac-10 boat.
Patti Cashman received the Most Valuable Oarswoman award.
The out-going captain of the women's crew will be replaced by
|oni Freitas. Jocelyn Kearing, a frosh, will serve as women's co
captain next season.
The crew suffered many hardships this year but still turned out
competitive boats. Stanford has long operated out of a boathouse
opposite Charlie Brown's in Redwood City, but the crew was
evicted from the boathouse this past fall and forced to tear it
down.
The crew was forced to make a coaching change in the middle
of fall term.
The only experienced oarswoman, Patti Cashman, was forced
to miss several races because of a back injury.
Despite these setbacks, the crew managed to win. The men's
varsity-8 came from behind to defeat San Diego State, it defeated
USC four times this season, and took third in the Western Sprints.
The woman's novice-8, after falling to top-seeded Washington
by a second, finished the season spectacularly in defeating
Washington State and Long Beach State.
The boats should be even faster next season: With the help of
Conn Findley, the crew will have a new boathouse. Phil Waters
will be returning as head coach. Patti Cashman is the only
graduating oarswoman. And, the cew is going to step up recruit
ing efforts.
