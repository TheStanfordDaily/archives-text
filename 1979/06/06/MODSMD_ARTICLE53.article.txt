### 
Making a movie as bad as
The French Woman is no mean
achievement. This epic of soft
porn and general ineptitude
joins a shimmering firmament
of high-grade howlers.
Joining the bad-movie elite
isn't easy. It took all the
schlock genius of Robert Stig
wood to make last summer's
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Heart's Club Band into a
member of this select group.
The French Woman made the
grade without having a single
Bee Gee in the cast.
Another way to gain mem
bership is to prepare an ad
campaign which makes the
movie look as though it might
approach the interest level of
The National Enquirer. It's hard
to forget (however much one
tries) last spring's much
maligned classic The Creek Ty
coon — in this one a mil
lionaire named Tomasis mar
ries the wife of assassinated
President Jack Cassidy. The
French Woman is successfully
abominable without being
sued for libel by a single
widowed First Lady.
Yet a third way to make a
Truly Terrible Movie is to have
a script with jokes so
hackneyed that even fans of
Gilligan's Island might squirm
in discomfort. Neil Simon, the
Rod McKuen of American
comedy, poo-pooed and
doo-dooed The Cheap Detec
tive to glory. The French
Woman is hackneyed without
having to resort to even a
single bathroom joke.
The French Woman enters
the hall of fame without the as
sistance of Robert Stigwood,
Neil Simon or Jacqueline
Onassis. For those who deal
with the rise of artistic crappola
in history, The French Woman
might someday be required
viewing.
First, one must note its in
spired scenario construction.
It takes something bordering
on true genius to produce a
story which, despite lovingly
photographed sex and vio
lence, has virtually no intrinsic
interest.
Even a bad script is nothing
without rotten characters. The
French Woman has a surplus.
The title character is a high
class madame who supplies
high class prostitutes to high
class government officials.
When asked why she chose her
profession, Madame Claude

replies that it was out of a de
sire to "control those who
dominate the world." At least
she, unlike the filmmakers, has
some goal in mind other than
merely to make a quick buck
(imagine how far the makers of
The French Woman might have
gone had they set out to con
trol the world-dominators
rather than just the box office).
But even crummy charac
terizations might not make a
movie award-winning bad. The
French Woman takes spoiled
ingredients and covers them
over with a glaze of what
amounts to cinematic leprosy:
bad acting execrably dubbed.
Although I'm certain the
French Embassy would deny it

if pressed, this film was made
in France with the characters
speaking French. They now
speak a language found only in
select foreign films: dubese —
a language which bears no rela
tion to any tongue spoken in
any known country.
Someday, I'm certain,
someone will assemble a
pantheon of bad cinema. The
French Woman will be there. I
can see the "coming attrac
tions" trailer they'll prepare for
it. Emblazoned across the sc
reen in lettersoffirewill be "So
seldom has so little talent pro
duced so little and made so
much money."
It's the hack's fondest
dream.


Why are these men smiling? The Bee Gee's place in the guano hall of
fame, up to now thought to be unassailable, is being threatened by a
new release from France: The French Woman. Jim (soon-to-be sum-

; —— —j
mer entertainment editor) Mattson explains why this crap classic will
wipe that shit-eating grin right from these men's lips and deposit it
into unnumbered Swiss bank accounts.

campaign which makes the
movie look as though it might
approach the interest level of
The National Enquirer. It's hard
to forget (however much one
tries) last spring's much
maligned classic The Creek Ty
coon — in this one a mil
lionaire named Tomasis mar
ries the wife of assassinated
President Jack Cassidy. The
French Woman is successfully
abominable without being
sued for libel by a single
widowed First Lady.
Yet a third way to make a
Truly Terrible Movie is to have
a script with jokes so
hackneyed that even fans of
Gilligan's Island might squirm
in discomfort. Neil Simon, the
Rod McKuen of American
comedy, poo-pooed and
doo-dooed The Cheap Detec
tive to glory. The French
Woman is hackneyed without
having to resort to even a
single bathroom joke.
The French Woman enters
the hall of fame without the as
sistance of Robert Stigwood,
Neil Simon or Jacqueline
Onassis. For those who deal
with the rise of artistic crappola
in history, The French Woman
might someday be required
viewing.
First, one must note its in
spired scenario construction.
It takes something bordering
on true genius to produce a
story which, despite lovingly
photographed sex and vio
lence, has virtually no intrinsic
interest.
Even a bad script is nothing
without rotten characters. The
French Woman has a surplus.
The title character is a high
class madame who supplies
high class prostitutes to high
class government officials.
When asked why she chose her
profession, Madame Claude

replies that it was out of a de
sire to "control those who
dominate the world." At least
she, unlike the filmmakers, has
some goal in mind other than
merely to make a quick buck
(imagine how far the makers of
The French Woman might have
gone had they set out to con
trol the world-dominators
rather than just the box office).
But even crummy charac
terizations might not make a
movie award-winning bad. The
French Woman takes spoiled
ingredients and covers them
over with a glaze of what
amounts to cinematic leprosy:
bad acting execrably dubbed.
Although I'm certain the
French Embassy would deny it

if pressed, this film was made
in France with the characters
speaking French. They now
speak a language found only in
select foreign films: dubese —
a language which bears no rela
tion to any tongue spoken in
any known country.
Someday, I'm certain,
someone will assemble a
pantheon of bad cinema. The
French Woman will be there. I
can see the "coming attrac
tions" trailer they'll prepare for
it. Emblazoned across the sc
reen in lettersoffirewill be "So
seldom has so little talent pro
duced so little and made so
much money."
It's the hack's fondest
dream.


Why are these men smiling? The Bee Gee's place in the guano hall of
fame, up to now thought to be unassailable, is being threatened by a
new release from France: The French Woman. Jim (soon-to-be sum-

; —— —j
mer entertainment editor) Mattson explains why this crap classic will
wipe that shit-eating grin right from these men's lips and deposit it
into unnumbered Swiss bank accounts.
