Joni Mitchell just keeps
changing, expanding — soar
ing to new heights of artistic
achievement. Next week the
album of songs which she col
laborated on with the late,
legendary jazz bassist
composer Charles Mingus will
hit the stores, and if the set she
performed as the closing act of
the 1979 Berkeley Jazz Festival
is any indication, the album
promises to be a major musical
work of our period — a
breakthrough album.
The album, entitled simply
Mingus as a tribute, contains
six songs which the late com
poser wrote especially for
Mitchell, and two of Mingus'
most famous tunes, "Good
bye Pork Pie Hat," and "Self-
Portrait in Three Colors," all of
which Mitchell has set lyrics to.
The songs are intercut with
Mingus in conversation, and
the cover is graced with three
impressionistic portraits of
Mingus created by Mitchell,
who is also an accomplished
painter.
Lofty project
The Mingus-Mitchell collab
oration began early last spring,
when Mingus, seriously ill with
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
contacted Mitchell about a
very lofty project he Ffad in
mind. He wanted to set T.S.
Eliot's "Four Quartets" to
music, using Mitchell to do a
"lining" or colloquial interpre
tation of the text, as in the Bap
tist church where one person

reads a passage out of the Bi
ble, and another interprets it
into colloquial language.
Mitchell, after re-reading Eliot,
not so surprisingly declined,
citing the sheer difficulty and
audacity of the project. She fi
gured that her working rela
tionship with Mingus had
come to a quick end.
But several weeks later Min
gus called to tell her he had
written several songs for her to
put words to, which he had en
titled, "Joni One Through Six."
She flew to New York to meet
him, and ended up working on
the project for over a year,
shelving several other projects
which came up, and traveling
often to New York and to
Mexico — where Mingus spent
his last days — continuing and
finally completing the work
after Mingus' death in January.
Intensely emotional
For Mitchell, the collabora
tion has been "a very dramatic
life lesson" and "a chance to
breathe new life into a classical
form." It's also clearly been a
strong, intensely emotional
experience for her, one which
has added a new depth and
dimension to her work.
Charlie Mingus, who died
this year at age 56, was, ironi
cally, at the time of his physical
decline and death, just begin
ning to receive the recognition
he had long deserved as a
great, highly unconventional
genius of jazz. Mingus, who
has almost everywhere been

described as "volcanic," was a
complex, highly emotional,
ornery sometimes even violent
man, who lived a life of
paradox and frustration, of al
ternating brilliance and de
spair.
Continually surprising
He was known to do almost
anything to get his fellow
musicians to give their utmost.
He was perhaps the quintes
sential jazz eccentric, the very
soul of wild, seek-the
madness-of-the-moment jazz
improvisation. His music is
continually surprising; pas
sages seem to erupt out of
nowhere, and his pieces often
end up in musical places com
pletely different from where
they started. It is one out of the
many ironies of Mingus' life,
that the black musician from
Watts should have his music in
terpreted to a vast American
public after his death by
America's most respected
white, female singer
songwriter.
Eccentrics?
Although Mingus and
Mitchell are, on the surface,
worlds apart in experience,
both musicians are valued as
being eccentrics in their own
idioms, and closer reflection
suggests that their collabora
tion is not as unlikely as it ini
tially seems. Since her trium
phant Court and Spark-Miles of
Aisles period, Joni Mitchell has
become increasingly involved
in jazz and musical experimen

tation. Her style, since her Hej
ira album, has relied heavily on
a riff-like expansion of simple
melody lines, an essentially
jazz technique which has ena
bled her to create complex
lyric lines of alternating sylla
ble lengths.
As her music has grown
more difficult, daring and in
novative, Mitchell's lyrics have
become more and more poetic
and refined. In The Hissing of
Summer Lawns, her most un
derrated and misunderstood
album — a work of enormous,
eccentric beauty — she ex
perimented with sometimes
surreal or stream-of
consciousness lyrics. The lyrics
to "A Strange Boy" on the Hej
ira album come closer to being
real poetry — capable of stand
ing alone without the music —
than any I've ever heard. It's no
wonder that Mingus, in the last
year of his life, chose Mitchell,
the most literate, poetic
songwriter in popular music,
to give voice to his music.
Setting lyrics to jazz is a dif
ficult feat, and from the four
Mingus tunes Mitchell per
formed at the Berkeley Festi
val, it's clear that she has more
than risen to the challenge.
Many jazz fans will, I'm sure,
be curious to hear what Mitch
ell has done with the classic
"Goodbye, Porkpie Hat," the
great, elegant song which is
almost a Mingus signature
piece. I think they're going to
be surprised and maybe even
moved, for the lyrics Joni
Mitchell has put to the piece
are just about devastating to
anyone who knows something
about Mingus' life, and the life
of the tenor saxophonist, Les
ter Young, to whom the song
was originally dedicated.

Mitchell has managed to put
into the lyrics the figures of
Young and Mingus, as well as
herself, to create a stunningly
effective song, which is also a
poetic, musical meditation on
changing racial attitudes in
America. In the song Mitchell
describes how Young and his
white wife were once ousted
from their hotel bed by angry
whites, and then contrasts the
ugly episode with her own in
terracial relationship in con
temporary New York. At one
point she sings of "... a dark
age when the bandstands had a
thousand ways of refusing a
black man admission . . .black
musician ... In those days
they put him in an underdog
position . . . cellars and chit
terlings. . . ." Thank God, that
Mingus, who raged all of his
life against white oppression
and the shoddy treatment of
black musicians in his early
days, lived to hear Mitchell's
lyrics.
At the Berkeley festival
Mitchell also sang a fast, funny,
captivating be-bop song about
Las Vegas titled "Fool's
Paradise," wherein Mitchell
meets up with an excessively
lucky dry cleaner from Des
Moines, who "could put a coin
in the door of a john and get 20
for one," and a song called
"God Must Be a Bogeyman," a
tune which is more thoughtful
than its title suggests about
coming to terms with God.
An interesting request
Perhaps the song which
showed most successfully
Mitchell's artistry and ease
with her new material, was the
beautiful, musing "A Chair in
the Sky," in which Mitchell

"becomes" Mingus and singsa
graceful, at times even humor
ous song about the conflicting
emotions the composer must
have felt as he confronted the
real possibility of his death. At
the Bread and Roses Festival
last September Mitchell intro
duced the song with an in
teresting request: "When I
sing this song, imagine me to
be about 'this big,' (says
Mitchell, stretching her arms
to simulate Mingus' hefty fi
gure), and high-yellow, and
pissed off, and romantic, and
seriously ill, hopefully not fi
nally ill, and staring out the
window of the 44th floor of a
building in New York which
overlooks the Hudson River."
Genuinely inspired
The Mingus-Mitchell collab
oration seems a truly integ
rated blending of two highly
unique, even great musicians.
Mingus appears, for the most
part, to have toned down his
sometimes wild melodies in
order to accommodate Mitch
ell's singing style, and Mitchell
has filtered her lyrics through
Mingus' sensibility in a way
that seems remarkable —
genuinely inspired. She sings,
with strength and assurance,
witty, poignant, evocative lines
to Mingus' sinuous, complex
melodies.
Mitchell's Mingus album is,
in fact, just that — a posthum
ous collection of tunes by
Charlie Mingus, to which Joni
Mitchell has added not only
her brilliant lyrics, but perhaps
more importantly, her own
fame and musical reputation,
to bring Mingus' music to a vast
audience, which otherwise
might never have appreciated
his greatness.
