## Alto saxophonists continue to make jazz history 
### 
Live and Well in japan
Benny Carter
Pablo
Several recent releases
document the continued emi
nence of some of the classic
alto saxophonists in jazz his
tory. Pablo has made available
a stellar recording of Benny
Carter's band in Tokyo, while
Galaxy records (Fantasy re
cord's young mainstream
label) has brought out a first
rate album by the rarely re
corded Art Pepper.
It is perhaps appropriate that
Benny Carter's album, Live and
Well in Japan, begins with a
long rendition of Johnny
Hodge's composition "Squatty
Roo." Hodges was, along with
Carter, among the two or three
greatest alto saxophonists of
the swing era. Now Carter is
undoubtedly the leading ex
ponent of that style of alto play
ing, and his tribute to Hodges
reveals his full-bodied tone
(somewhat heavier than
Hodge's) and sharp rhythmic
drive.
In recent years Carter has
developed his abilities as a
trumpeter, and (unlike many
multi-instrumentalists) his abil
ity on that instrument almost
matches his more-heralded
work on the alto. On a medley
of Louis Armstrong songs,
Benny contrives a touching
melodic rendition of "Confes
sin' That I Love You," while
trumpeter Cat Anderson
sounds remarkably like
Satchmo himself on "When It's
Sleepy Time Down South." Joe
Newman provides a vocal im
itation of Armstrong on "When
You're Smiling" which cap
tures not only the distinctive
quality of hisvoice, butalsothe
slurs and rhythmic nuances
which characterized Arm
strong's singing.

Carter is ably assisted by a
rhythm section made up of Nat
Pierce on piano (who has been
recording regularly, during the
past few years, on the Concord
label), George Duvivier on
bass, and Harold |ones on
drums. Leonard Feather, in his
liner notes, rightfully points
out the ironic fact that this ex
cellent group never played
publicly in the country in
which it was organized.
Art Pepper Today
Art Pepper
Galaxy
The Art Pepper release, sim
ply entitled Art Pepper Today,
is a real treat. Pepper,
bothered off and on by drug
problems during the past two
decades, has rarely recorded
with major labels. In the mid

'50s Pepper was hailed as one
of the heirs to Charlie Parker;
he combined Parker's melodic
brilliance with a much lighter
tone in the style of Lee Konitz.
But the next 10 years, which
should have been the most
creative period in Pepper's
career, saw the alto
saxophonist passing most of
his time in prison.
The new Galaxy release is
quite possibly the best album
Pepper has ever recorded. The
long ballad "Patricia," which
opens the second side is an
unmistakable gem, and fea
tures superb solos from both
Pepper and pianist Stanley
Cowell. Cowell is impressive
throughout the album; he con
tributes a particularly fascinat
ing solo on Pepper's composi
tion "Miss Who," which is
based on the chords to "Sweet
Georgia Brown."
Pepper's autobiography
Straight Life will be published
by Macmillan in the fall and
will, with luck, help to boost
this alto saxophonist to the
level of success he has long de
served. Pepper's all too long
absence from the music scene
has been an unfortunate turn
of events for jazz fans.
The Live-liest
Eddie lefferson
Muse
While on the subject of alto
saxophonists, mention should
be made of the last release by
the late Eddie lefferson, The
Live-liest (a rather gruesome
name when one considers Jef
ferson's recent death) oh Muse
records. Vocalist Jefferson is
joined by altoists Richie Cole
and Eric Kloss, both of whom
are among the premier young
saxophonists in jazz. Both Cole
and Kloss are amazingly adept
at be-bop (as demonstrated on

a previous duet album re
corded on Muse) and their
solos, on such be-bop stan
dards as "Groovin' High,"
"Confirmation" and "Parker's
Mood," are a real delight.
In My Prime
Art Blakey
Timeless
Another fine young alto
saxophonist, Robert Watson,
demonstrates his considerable
abilities on Art Blakey's recent
release In My Prime. The al
bum, originally released in
Holland, is only available on
import â€” alas, another irony:
America having to buy its jazz
from Europe is about as under
standable as America selling oil
to the Arabs.
Watson, who hails from Kan
sas City (the home of Charlie

Parker, the patron saint of all
modern alto players), shows
considerable talent both as a
composer and as an impro
viser. He features a very full
bodied tone and a powerful at
tack. His composition "To See
Her Face" is one of the album's

definite highlights, and fea
tures strong solos from his
band members James Williams
on piano and Valery
Ponomarev.
Ponomarev, a Russian exile,
is a story in himself. He fea
tures a clean-toned style, much

in the tradition of Clifford
Brown and Fats Navarro, and a
fine melodic sense. His high
register is somewhat insecure,
but overall Ponomarev impre
sses me as being one of the two
orthree bestyoung trumpeters
in jazz.
