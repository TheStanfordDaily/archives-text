## Betty Carter exuberant 
### 
A small, but appreciative audience was
treated to an exuberant set by Betty Carter at the
vocalist's May 27 concert at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Carter enchanted the audience
with a combination of jazz standards and vener
able popular songs.
She opened with a slow, haunting version of
Monk's " 'Round Midnight," which was taken in
3/4, rather than the usual 4/4. " Round Mid
night" sets up a series of difficult chord changes
which would stymie most vocalists, but through
which Carter's voice glided with remarkable
ease. Carter changed the melody of Monk's
piece, and also used lyrics much different from
the ones which generally accompany the song.
This description shows in essence what radi
cal transformations Carter brings to her mate
rial. As noted, she used a different rhythm,
melody and different lyrics from those tradi
tionally associated with the composition. In
deed Carter's brilliance lies primarily in herabil
ity to change even the simplest songs into a
cornucopia of musical richness.
A similar transition took place in Carter's ver
sion of "My Favorite Things," which was taken,
this time, at 4/4, rather than the usual waltz
tempo. Carter's scat singing, on fast numbers
such as this one, is a marvel to hear. One might

be tempted to repeat the time-honored cliche,
and say that Carter uses her voice like an instru
ment; but in all honesty, she uses it like several
instruments.
This is partly due to Carter's admirable vocal
range. The upper part of her range is clear and
boisterous, but even more pleasing (at least to
my ears) are her beautifully resonant low notes.
But Carter's abilities are most evident in her
approach to slow ballads, which comprised
nearly half of her set. Several of her numbers
were taken so slowly that one could have easily
counted to 10 between each beat. Music of this
naturedemands the utmost control, both on the
part of the singer and (perhaps even more im
portantly) on the part of her rhythm section.
Both were up to the occasion.
Note should be made of the fine support
which Carter received from her supporting
musicians, particularly from the talented pianist
John Hicks who has worked with Carter for sev
eral years. Hicks has put together a persuasive
style which blends the best elements of such
diverse stylists as McCoy Tyner and Bud Powell.
Even more importantly, he showed a sensitivity
to Carter's music which really contributed a
great deal to the overall quality of the perfor
mance.
