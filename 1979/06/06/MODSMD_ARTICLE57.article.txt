1! New Varsity, Palo Alto

I! father and mother; her father
| died but her mother survived to
p press charges. Claude Chabrol,
one of the main figures in the
I French "New Wave" in film in the
j) '60s, directed this intelligent,
L slow-moving examination of the
|l infamous French murder trial.
J1 Violette became a cause celebre
t for the '20s surrealists; any of the
U fire of the movement that this

I! movie's depth comes from the
bravura performance of Isabelle

: she captures the spoiled, con
-1 fused air of this curiously sym
| pathetic murderess.

There's no way this movie
j could be better than TV — it/sTV,
j a pilot episode, to be exact.
I Battlestar Calactica's premiere
j] episode may have been blown up
j to big-screen size, but all of its

intact. Even on television this

The Lacemaker * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Claude Coretta directed
Isabelle Huppert in this gentle
film about a young woman who is
too vulnerable to cope with the
loss of love. Huppert gives a per
formance so assured that it
becomes difficult to separate
character from actress — one
leaves the theater awed by the
performance, but a little curious
as to which was which.
—).M.

The French Woman
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The French Woman takes us
back to the halcyon days when
the word French in a movie title
meant it was going to be dirty.
This is a very stupid movie about
a French madame who seeks to
control the men who dominate
the Earth. It would all be very
laughable — and maybe even a
little bit enjoyable — if it weren't
all taken with such ludicrous
seriousness. The French Woman
joins the pantheon of truly great
bad movies.
—J.M.
Ra\homon - * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Four people involved in a
rape-murder give their accounts
of what happened; each one's
story differs, but each story may
be equally true. Akira Kurosawa
directed this phenomenal study
of the relativity of the"truth."
The end result may be viewed in
one of two ways: all people are
liars, or all people are honest, in
their own fashion. Toshiro
Mifune is a member of the super
lative cast. In lapanese, with sub
titles. (1951)
—J.M.

Coming Home * * * *
Old Mill, Mountain View
(1978) Set in 1%8, Coming
Home is a drama about people at
home dealing with the Vietnam
War. The Bruce Dern character is
undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. )ane Fonda and |on
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel
lent, and Hal Ashby's direction is
excellent throughout.
—Ron Lillejord

A Dream of Passion * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
lules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting. Two women have an exp
losive encounter. One is a suc
cessful but self-doubting actress
who is rehearsing the role of
Medea. The other is a woman
who is imprisoned for the very
crime that made Medea notori
ous: she has slaughtered her
own children.
The film has more murky reg
ions than it should, and tries a
little too hard. Vet, Dassin probes
regions of desire and rage that
are usually hidden, and scores
most of his emotional points
triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Crease *
Guild, Menlo Park
Crease is fairly inoffensive, and
I suppose it is possible to have a
very good time at it. But can't we
demand a little bit better than this
kind of calculated entertainment,
presold like one would sell
Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by

Dormer last year than I did watch
ing the movie; at least the people
in Donner appeared to be enjoy
ing themselves.
Crease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feeling
must please some people, and
while Crease is hardly a good
movie, sensations like that help
make it the ultimate in pacifiers.
—R.L.

Rollerball *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Director Norman Jewison
proves that he's no Stanley Kub
rick; he tries to attach a lot of
deep existential meaning to what
essentially is a show of the "good
ol' ultraviolence" and fails miser
ably. But the good ol' ultra
violence, the deathsport of Rol
lerball, is rendered with solid
technique, and for those of you
who think that getting real ag
gressive during finals week is a
good thing, the fast-paced multi
ple deaths here ought to make
you feel really great. With lames
Caan and John Houseman.
—R.L.
The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and

straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, fames Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics. H l
The Deer Hunter * # ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft. But it's also
among the best war movies ever
made. Very little of the "tell em I
died for Betty'' bullshit that |ohn

Wayne types keep croaking on
the shores of Iwo Jima; the movie
puts you face to face with the
horr s of the thing. Robert De
Niro is starkly individualistic in
the film's central performance,
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen, but there is a master
piece buried in here somewhere,
and it more than repays an at
tempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
Harold and Maude * * *
Biograph, Palo Alto
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodriess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Cordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.
—).M.

Alien * * * *
Northpoint, San Francisco
Ridley Scott directed this
nightmarish science-fiction
movie about a crew of a space
craft menaced by an alien with a
penchant for human flesh. Alien
is essentially a bug-eyed monster
movie from the '50s brought up
to date; under Scott's direction,
however, it has a punch and wit
that hits even the most skeptical
viewer right between the eyes.
Alien is the best thriller we've had
since laws, and the 45-minute
long special effects finale is a

sure-fire audience pleaser. The
seven-member cast includes
Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver,
and Veronica Cartwright.
—J.M.
Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.
—J.M.
Norma Rae * ★ * *
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who

- u
fights to have a union put in at the jj
textile mill where she works, j]
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An ■ Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.
-J.M.

u
Manhattan * * * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
'70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photography
by Cordon Willis. Music by
George Gershwin.

11 seems only fitting that this quarter's last Cinemascope page pay tribute to the man who had a hand
in starting it all: photographer Eadweard Muybridge. Legend has it that Leland Stanford, after making
a bet about how a horse moves when it's running, hired Muybridge to prove it. Muybridge's results,
some of which are shown on this page, not only won Stanford's bet but indirectly gave rise to a whole
new art form: the motion pic ture.

field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography

sometimes dreamlike, some

Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly

hilarious and oddly disturbing.

in starting it all: photographer Eadweard Muybridge. Legend has it that Leland Stanford, after making
a bet about how a horse moves when it's running, hired Muybridge to prove it. Muybridge's results,
some of which are shown on this page, not only won Stanford's bet but indirectly gave rise to a whole

Isabelle Huppert in this gentle
film about a young woman who is
too vulnerable to cope with the

The French Woman
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The French Woman takes us
back to the halcyon days when
the word French in a movie title
meant it was going to be dirty.
This is a very stupid movie about
a French madame who seeks to
control the men who dominate
the Earth. It would all be very
laughable — and maybe even a
little bit enjoyable — if it weren't
all taken with such ludicrous
seriousness. The French Woman
joins the pantheon of truly great
bad movies.

Four people involved in a
rape-murder give their accounts

be equally true. Akira Kurosawa
directed this phenomenal study
of the relativity of the"truth."
The end result may be viewed in
one of two ways: all people are
liars, or all people are honest, in
their own fashion. Toshiro
Mifune is a member of the super

titles. (1951)

(1978) Set in 1%8, Coming

undefined, and the movie occa
sionally suffers from poor transi
tions, but it more than makes up
for these deficiencies with its un
derstanding of the look and feel
of the time. )ane Fonda and |on
Voight (as a paraplegic) are excel

excellent throughout.

A Dream of Passion * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
lules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting. Two women have an exp
losive encounter. One is a suc
cessful but self-doubting actress
who is rehearsing the role of
Medea. The other is a woman
who is imprisoned for the very
crime that made Medea notori
ous: she has slaughtered her
own children.
The film has more murky reg
ions than it should, and tries a
little too hard. Vet, Dassin probes
regions of desire and rage that
are usually hidden, and scores
most of his emotional points
triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Crease *
Guild, Menlo Park
Crease is fairly inoffensive, and
I suppose it is possible to have a
very good time at it. But can't we
demand a little bit better than this
kind of calculated entertainment,
presold like one would sell
Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by

Dormer last year than I did watch
ing the movie; at least the people
in Donner appeared to be enjoy
ing themselves.
Crease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feeling
must please some people, and
while Crease is hardly a good
movie, sensations like that help
make it the ultimate in pacifiers.

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power

been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy

lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and

straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, fames Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics. H l
The Deer Hunter * # ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft. But it's also
among the best war movies ever
made. Very little of the "tell em I
died for Betty'' bullshit that |ohn

Wayne types keep croaking on
the shores of Iwo Jima; the movie
puts you face to face with the
horr s of the thing. Robert De
Niro is starkly individualistic in
the film's central performance,
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen, but there is a master
piece buried in here somewhere,
and it more than repays an at
tempt at excavation.

Harold and Maude * * *
Biograph, Palo Alto

free love and in the inherent
goodriess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Cordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.

Alien * * * *
Northpoint, San Francisco
Ridley Scott directed this
nightmarish science-fiction
movie about a crew of a space
craft menaced by an alien with a
penchant for human flesh. Alien
is essentially a bug-eyed monster
movie from the '50s brought up
to date; under Scott's direction,
however, it has a punch and wit
that hits even the most skeptical
viewer right between the eyes.
Alien is the best thriller we've had
since laws, and the 45-minute
long special effects finale is a

sure-fire audience pleaser. The
seven-member cast includes
Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver,
and Veronica Cartwright.

The Deer Hunter * # ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft. But it's also
among the best war movies ever
made. Very little of the "tell em I
died for Betty'' bullshit that |ohn

Wayne types keep croaking on
the shores of Iwo Jima; the movie
puts you face to face with the
horr s of the thing. Robert De
Niro is starkly individualistic in
the film's central performance,
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen, but there is a master
piece buried in here somewhere,
and it more than repays an at
tempt at excavation.
—John Nielsen
Harold and Maude * * *
Biograph, Palo Alto
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodriess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Cordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.

Alien * * * *
Northpoint, San Francisco
Ridley Scott directed this
nightmarish science-fiction
movie about a crew of a space
craft menaced by an alien with a
penchant for human flesh. Alien
is essentially a bug-eyed monster
movie from the '50s brought up
to date; under Scott's direction,
however, it has a punch and wit
that hits even the most skeptical
viewer right between the eyes.
Alien is the best thriller we've had
since laws, and the 45-minute
long special effects finale is a

sure-fire audience pleaser. The
seven-member cast includes
Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver,
and Veronica Cartwright.
—J.M.
Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.

Norma Rae * ★ * *
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who

- u
fights to have a union put in at the jj
textile mill where she works, j]
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An ■ Unmarried
Woman was small — the em

Woody Allen completes his

hilarious and oddly disturbing.

The French Woman
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The French Woman takes us
back to the halcyon days when
the word French in a movie title
meant it was going to be dirty.
This is a very stupid movie about
a French madame who seeks to
control the men who dominate

seriousness. The French Woman

Four people involved in a

The end result may be viewed in

A Dream of Passion * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
lules Dassin's screenplay re
tells the Medea myth in modern
setting. Two women have an exp
losive encounter. One is a suc
cessful but self-doubting actress
who is rehearsing the role of
Medea. The other is a woman
who is imprisoned for the very
crime that made Medea notori
ous: she has slaughtered her
own children.
The film has more murky reg
ions than it should, and tries a
little too hard. Vet, Dassin probes
regions of desire and rage that
are usually hidden, and scores
most of his emotional points
triumphantly.
—Elliot Klein
Crease *
Guild, Menlo Park
Crease is fairly inoffensive, and
I suppose it is possible to have a
very good time at it. But can't we
demand a little bit better than this
kind of calculated entertainment,
presold like one would sell
Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by

Dormer last year than I did watch
ing the movie; at least the people
in Donner appeared to be enjoy
ing themselves.
Crease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feeling
must please some people, and
while Crease is hardly a good
movie, sensations like that help
make it the ultimate in pacifiers.

lerball, is rendered with solid
technique, and for those of you

good thing, the fast-paced multi

you feel really great. With lames

losive encounter. One is a suc
cessful but self-doubting actress
who is rehearsing the role of
Medea. The other is a woman
who is imprisoned for the very
crime that made Medea notori
ous: she has slaughtered her
own children.
The film has more murky reg
ions than it should, and tries a
little too hard. Vet, Dassin probes
regions of desire and rage that
are usually hidden, and scores
most of his emotional points
triumphantly.

Crease *
Guild, Menlo Park
Crease is fairly inoffensive, and
I suppose it is possible to have a
very good time at it. But can't we
demand a little bit better than this
kind of calculated entertainment,
presold like one would sell
Ultra-Brite toothpaste?
I had a lot more fun watching
Crease performed as a play by

Dormer last year than I did watch
ing the movie; at least the people
in Donner appeared to be enjoy
ing themselves.
Crease has an astounding
quantity of varied colors in its
shot composition, and they flash
by at a dizzying pace. While
watching it, I felt like a kid with a
kaleidoscope equipped with
headphones. That kind of feeling
must please some people, and
while Crease is hardly a good
movie, sensations like that help
make it the ultimate in pacifiers.

Rollerball *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Director Norman Jewison
proves that he's no Stanley Kub
rick; he tries to attach a lot of
deep existential meaning to what
essentially is a show of the "good
ol' ultraviolence" and fails miser
ably. But the good ol' ultra
violence, the deathsport of Rol
lerball, is rendered with solid
technique, and for those of you
who think that getting real ag
gressive during finals week is a
good thing, the fast-paced multi
ple deaths here ought to make
you feel really great. With lames
Caan and John Houseman.

The China Syndrome * * * *
Palo Alto Square
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, has
been perversely vindicated by
the recent events at Three Mile
Island. Those who called the
movie "unrealistic" are hard to
find now (maybe they're out buy
ing Columbia Pictures stock),
lane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are
excellent in this flashy mix of
political commentary and

straight genre thriller. The per
formances keep the movie in
high gear even when the direc
tor, fames Bridges, loses his
nerve and refuses to take charge.
In the end, an emotionally mov
ing film, no matter how you take
its politics. H l
The Deer Hunter * # ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
A very rough draft. But it's also
among the best war movies ever
made. Very little of the "tell em I
died for Betty'' bullshit that |ohn

Wayne types keep croaking on
the shores of Iwo Jima; the movie
puts you face to face with the
horr s of the thing. Robert De
Niro is starkly individualistic in
the film's central performance,
and occasionally he restores the
movie when things get pushed
out of shape. And The Deer
Hunter is more than a little mis
shapen, but there is a master
piece buried in here somewhere,
and it more than repays an at
tempt at excavation.

Harold and Maude * * *
Biograph, Palo Alto
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodriess of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated for an
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Cordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.

Alien * * * *
Northpoint, San Francisco
Ridley Scott directed this
nightmarish science-fiction
movie about a crew of a space
craft menaced by an alien with a
penchant for human flesh. Alien
is essentially a bug-eyed monster
movie from the '50s brought up
to date; under Scott's direction,
however, it has a punch and wit
that hits even the most skeptical
viewer right between the eyes.
Alien is the best thriller we've had
since laws, and the 45-minute
long special effects finale is a

sure-fire audience pleaser. The
seven-member cast includes
Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver,
and Veronica Cartwright.

Picnic at Hanging Rock * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Peter Weir directed this fine,
atmospheric tale about four
schoolgirls who disappear on a
field trip to the hanging rock
natural formation in Australia.
The date is Valentine's Day, 1900,
and change is in the air: the girls
are nearing adolescence and the
Victorian era is about to be re
placed by the less genteel world
of the 20th century. Weir
supplies no solution to his para
ble — it's a rite of passage that
necessarily obscures the subject
from view. Story, photography
and music blend to create a
sometimes dreamlike, some
times nightmarish film.
—J.M.
Norma Rae * ★ * *
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who

- u
fights to have a union put in at the jj
textile mill where she works, j]
Sally Field gives an assured and
very likeable performance as
Norma Rae; her days as "the Fly
ing Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited charac
ter. This is a "small" movie in the
same way that An ■ Unmarried
Woman was small — the em
phasis is more on characteriza
tion than on action. Ron Leibman
co-stars as a New York union
agitator.

Manhattan * * * *
Palo Alto Square
'S Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his
'70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few master
pieces of this decade. Manhattan
is a bitterly funny examination of
a city and a lifestyle. It bites close
enough to the bone to be both
hilarious and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel
Hemingway and Meryl Streep.
Written by Woody Allen and
Marshall Brickman. Photography
by Cordon Willis. Music by
George Gershwin.

11 seems only fitting that this quarter's last Cinemascope page pay tribute to the man who had a hand
in starting it all: photographer Eadweard Muybridge. Legend has it that Leland Stanford, after making
a bet about how a horse moves when it's running, hired Muybridge to prove it. Muybridge's results,
some of which are shown on this page, not only won Stanford's bet but indirectly gave rise to a whole
new art form: the motion pic ture.
