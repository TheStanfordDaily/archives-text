The Nabokov-Wilson
Letters
Edited by

Two of perhaps the
strongest literary per
sonalities of recent times,
Vladimir Nabokov and Ed
mund Wilson, carried on for
over 30 years a sometimes
friendly, often strained, but
always revealing corres
pondence which, under the
editorship of Simon Kar
linsky, was finally published
last month in a handsome,
carefully annotated volume
by Harper & Row.
Nabokov, renowned au
thor of acknowledged
modern classics of fiction
such as Lolita and Pale Fire,
and Wilson, one of the most
respected and prolific liter
ary critics of this century,
had a great deal in common
besides their argumentative
natures. Wilson was one of
the first to befriend the im
poverished Nabokov when
the Russian exile fled the
Nazi blight which was
creeping over Europe and
immigrated to America in
1940. He helped Nabokov to
publish his fiction, now
written in English, and
Nabokov in turn served as a
sounding-board for Wil
son's ideas on Russian liter
ature.
Vet their letters reveal
that the relationship was
rather one-sided. Nabokov
is always expressing
gratitude for this or that
favor that Wilson has done
for him: "You are a magi
cian," he tells the critic after
Wilson has been instrumen
tal in getting a story of his
accepted by The Atlantic
Monthly. It seems that all
Wilson ever got out of the
friendship was the pleasure
of matching wits with a
major talent and a febrile
mind.
Almost all of the letters in
this collection, in fact, are
oriented toward Nabokov.
Part of that bias comes as a
result of sheer lopsided
ness; Nabokov's letters are
much more numerous and
invariably longer than Wil
son's.
Because of that orienta

tion, this collection throws
far more light on the com
plex personality of
Nabokov, while Wilson re
mains shadowed in the
background. And that per
sonality is an aloof, re
served, even haughty one.
The highest that the emo
tions of either writer ever
soar is Nabokov's declara
tion to Wilson that "you are
one of the very few people
. . . whom I keenly miss
when I do not see them."
Wilson, in turn, tells
Nabokov that "our conver
sations have been among
the few consolations of my
literary life through these
last years."
Perhaps the increasingly
competitive tone of the Wil
son letters stems directly
from frustration with
Nabokov's frequent decla
ration of the supremacy of
his own judgment. Even
though in jest, Nabokov
possessed the kind of ego
that caused him to write to
Wilson, "once and (or all
you should tell yourself that
in these questions . . . you
are wrong and I am right,
always." When Wilson
takes up chess, Nabokov
archly tells him, "I hope you
will soon be playing well
enough for me to beat you."
Wilson, clearly stymied
and even hurt by Nabokov's
constant refusal to ap
preciate the authors and
books that he recommends,
such as Henry )ames and
Andre Malraux, responds
by pecking away at the
Nabokov ego. "It is only oc
casionally that your English
goes off the track," he
writes to the proud author.
Clearly, then, these let
ters provide a crucial
backdrop for the eventual
falling-out of Wilson and
Nabokov, which occurred
when Wilson wrote in 1965 a
highly critical review of
Nabokov's four-volume an
notated translation of Alek
sandr Pushkin's Eugene
Onegin. Those who are in
terested in establishing mo
tives for Wilson's attack will
not fail to point at the 25
years of exasperation that
Wilson experienced when
dealing with Nabokov's
(and his own) ego.
