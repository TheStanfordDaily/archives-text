On Human Nature
Edward O. Wilson
Harvard University Press
260 pp. $12.50
The development of each
individual organism can be
thought to follow the path of a
ball rolling down a sloping
landscape of ridges and gul
leys. There are many different
paths it can take. If we push the
ball gently we can make it go
down one gulley instead of
another but we can change its
path only so much. The land
scape is the genetic potential
that, given the right environ
ment, will allow the organism
to develop to its fullest. To so
much everyone agrees.
The disagreement in the
nature/nurture debate arises
over the degree to which an
organism and more impor
tantly human beings are genet
ically determined. How much
control do we have over our
lives? How much are we a pro
duct of the environment we
live in?
Is sociobiology, which first
received public attention a few
years back with the publication
of Edward O. Wilson's
Sociobiology, an oversimplifi
cation of the issue?
It was the last chapter of Wil
son's book, that deals with the
broad range of social behavior
trom insects to man, that stir
red so much controversy. His
claim is that human nature has
to be examined with genetic
evolution in mind. The central
dogma of sociobiology is that
organisms exist to facilitate the
propagation of genes; we are
no exception.
Wilson's contention is that
human behavior such as ag
gression and altruism is more
genetic in nature than social
scientists are willing to admit.
Wilson's new book, On
Human Nature, is intended to
calm the waters of the heated
debate that followed
Sociobiology, but it seems Wil
son is likely to stir them some
more instead.
More controversy
The problem is that Wilson
takes a bigger bite than he can
chew. Sociobiology is for Wil
son the primary science of man
which will bring social science
to the level of the exact sci
ences. The fact that many re
spectable scientists have called
his bluff does not bother Wil
son in the least.

In the first chapter of On
Human Nature Wilson puts
forward two dilemmas that
should not be new to soul
searching college students.
The first is that mankind has no
particular place to go. We have
no goal external to our biologi
cal nature; secondly, that even
though all educated people be
lieve that beyond material
needs lies the realization of in
dividual potential, the ques
tion of which end this potential
should realize is unanswered.
Sociobiology will allow us to
select "a more deeply under
stood and enduring code of
moral values." If taken at face
value, this statement makes
Wilson guilty ot the naturalistic
fallacy. What should be is not
logically dependent on what is.
We cannot sidestep our gene
tic predispositions. We have to
come to terms with the dark

sides of our nature and create an
environment in which they will
not develop.
Altruism
The dogma of the "selfish
gene" has given us a novel
perspective on altruism: it is
worthwhile to give your life for
your siblings but not for your
mother-in-law.
In this genetic calculus it is
the propagation of a particular
genotype that' is of evolutio
nary importance. Any ant in an
anthill is expendable since all
are genetically identical. By
contrast, for most higher or
ganisms only sacrifice for the
benefit of closest relatives is
justifiable.
We are pragmatic animals,
our loyalties, unlike those of
the social insects, are flexible.
We do not throwour lives away
like ants. This is why we will
ultimately be able to coexist.

If genes play such a crucial
role in our behavior, what does
our freedom consist of? Wil
son's answer reduces the prob
lem to an empirical question.
Our behavior is free to the ex
tent it cannot be predicted. It is
predictable statistically, but we
as individuals are governed by
a particular form of the
Heisenberg uncertainty prin
ciple: when we examine the
behavior of the individual, we
change it.
Extravagant
The overall problem with the
book is that Wilson tries to un
ravel the mysteries of human
nature in a little over 200 pages.
Among other topics dealt with
are human sexuality, religion
and differences between men
and women. Interspersed
throughout the book are
examples from modern day
politics and anthropology.
Sociobiology is just not de
veloped enough as a theory to
support such extravagant
claims. If sociobiology is not
going to be dismissed as
another form of pop-culture, it
will have to produce more re
sults.

Anthropology Prof. Wil
liam Durham, well-known op
ponent of sociobiology, points
out that sociobiologists have
grossly underestimated the
power of cultural evolution. A
mere correlation between
theories of evolutionary biol
ogy and behavior are no basis
to infer causality. Though there
does not seem to be a coherent
theory of cultural change
which can adequately explain
why we find particular cultural
practices, this does not give
reason to infer that ethics, al
truism or homosexuality are
genetically determined. Cul
tural practices are maintained
precisely because of their sur
vival value for human beings.
On Human Nature is more
like a rough sketch of a theory
that has so far not contributed
anything to the understanding
of ourselves. It is never quite
clear how genetics ties into the
Middle East situation or the
search for meaning in our lives.
If you are looking for a care
fully worked out scientific ar
gument or philosophy, don't
look for it here.
