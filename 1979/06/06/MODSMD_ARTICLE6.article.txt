# Foreign students not judged differently in admissions process
## 
### Rose Chan 
Foreign students here are
not judged by special criteria
or under a quota system in the
admissions process or in the
granting of financial aid, ac
cording to University officials.
The 1600 foreign students
here represent 80 nations.
They make up 21.3 percent of
the graduate student popula
tion and 2.5 percent of the un
dergraduate population.
Canadians make up the
largest foreign student popula
tion here, followed by students
from Taiwan, Iran, Japan,
Mexico and Hong Kong.

Because foreign student ap
plications are handled exactly
the same way as those of U.S.
citizens, the admissions offices
often have problems obtaining
student records. For example,
some countries "don't issue
records the same way the Un
ited States does," said Joan
Hanley of the foreign students
department of graduate stu
dent admissions. The only
added requirement for their
admissions is that they pass the
Test of English as a Second
Language. Student credentials
must often be accompanied by
explanations of the foreign

school's grading system and
translations of records into En
glish.
Naivete
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Fred Hargadon said
foreign students often have a
"naivete" about the admis
sions process, in that they
don't understand the impor
tance of such requirements as
tests and grades and believe
they can get into the University
because of their parents' influ
ence or because of wealth. The
first pamphlet which the Uni
versity sends to prospective
undergraduate applicants de

liberately discourages students
who would never meet the re
quirements and thereby lessens
the costs of handling paper
work for those students, Har
gadon said.
The University does not re
cruit foreign students, said
Hanley, although some de
partments, such as the School
of Education and the Food Re
search Institute, have ex
tended invitations to students
in the past. Most "recruiting"
is likely to be done by indi
vidual professors who recom
mend that a student come to
Stanford.
Separate statistics are not
kept for foreign students ap
plying at the undergraduate
level, but this year, 2450
students applied for the fall
quarter graduate programs.
Because there is no quota sys
tem, it is impossible to say what
percentage of these students
will be accepted. But Hanley
said that about 60 percent of
those who are admitted will
come.
Financial aid
"On the whole, the foreign
student coming into Stanford
brings his own money. But a
few are given financial aid â€”
just like a U.S. student," said
Hanley. Out of 169 foreign un
dergraduates, 75 are sup
ported by a financial aid pac
kage.
However, these students are
usually working at on-campus
jobs instead of receiving loans.
"We really shy away from
giving loans to foreign stu
dents because often they can't
repay them," said Mary
Roberts, assistant director of
Undergraduate Financial Aids.
She mentioned the difficulty
some students have in taking
money out of their home
countries.
The University is careful not
to admit anyone who may not
be able to complete their
studies because of finances,
said Mollie Goetz of graduate
awards. In order to get visas,

foreign students must show
evidence of financial support.
"It is a very prevalent at
titude of foreign students that
if they can only get here by
whatever ruses, money will be
forthcoming from the univer
sity," she said. "After all,
America is 'the land of oppor
tunity.' "
"Foreign students are not
usually given aid for their first
year," Roberts said. "But we
endeavor to help them if they
have substantial need."
Foreign undergraduates
come from quite wealthy
families, said Mitchell Hall,
student adviser at Bechtel In
ternational Center. Their pa
rents are often diplomats,
military people or private
businessmen with interna
tional interests.
At the graduate level," a
large number of foreign stu
dents come because they have
funding from their countries,"
said Goetz. Funding comes
from foreign governments,
commercial companies,
foreign universities.
The graduate departments
don't discriminate or give pre
ference to foreign students in
granting awards, said Goetz.
The University has no separate
scholarship fund for foreign
students and gives no tuition
waivers. Competition is based
on academic qualifications and
is very stiff. "There really isn't
too much aid offered," said
Hanley.
Out of 1256 graduate stu
dents, 400 have full University
support and 67 have partial
support.
Most outside support for
foreign students is for further
study in the sciences. Electrical
engineering is by far the most
popular department, with 162
foreign students. Business,
civil engineering and educa
tion are the next most popular
majors.
In a survey done by Hall of 60
foreign undergraduates, 20
planned to major in engineer

ing, 10 in economics and seven
in biology. Ten remained un
declared.
Different interests
The backgrounds, interests
and reasons for coming to
Stanford differ between
foreign graduate and under
graduate students.
"I think for the graduate stu
dents, it is clearly for their
career advancement," said
Hall, "and to get training they
may not be able to get in their
home country."
Hall's survey of foreign un
dergraduates shows that
weather and the West Coast
location were almost as impor
tant to them as Stanford's
academic reputation. "Per
sonal referrals, having relatives
nearby, parents' wishes, the
friendly tone of applications
procedures, visited the school
and liked it and a more flexible
academic system" were other
popular reasons.
"It's close to home, and it's
got a great exchange program
with the French universities,"
said Yvonne Hsieh, a first-year

Ph.D. candidate in French iit
erature from Vancouver, B.C.
"I didn't want to go to the
University of Hong Kong, and I
came to Stanford because it
was on the West Coast, and
there aren't many choices,"
said Edward Chan, a co
terminal electrical engineering
student.
Graduate students form and
join national student organiza
tions and frequent the Interna
tional Center much more than
their younger counterparts,
said Hall.
Undergraduate students
tend to have lived in two or
more nations before coming
here. "Consequently, it is all
the more striking that so many
of them appear so American in
dress, manner and speech,"
concluded Hall in his survey.
"The graduate students are
generally more shaped in their
home culture," said Hall,
"whereas the undergraduates
are very cosmopolitan and
seem to have strong pressures
on them to blend in."
