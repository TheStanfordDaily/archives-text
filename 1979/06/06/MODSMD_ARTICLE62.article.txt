# Text of Trustee Select Committee statement on bank loans to Chile, infant formula sales
## 
### 
Following is an April 10 statement from the Trustee
Select Commmittee on Investment Responsibility
concerning recent stock proxy issues:
Bank loans to Chile
Wells Fargo and Chase Manhattan
Shareholder resolutions for each of these banks would
require that they cease making loans to the government of
Chile and its instrumentalities The Committee decided to
abstain from voting on both One member voted to cast the
proxies for management
The Committee recognized the gravity of the deprivations
of human rights committed by the government of Chile. Such
conduct is deplorable wherever it occurs, and, unhappily it
occurs widely throughout the world, as reports of our own
government and other public and private agencies attest
However, if the existence of political repression on the
part of a nation's government were the sole test, then
American business, and universities for that matter, would
be required to avoid most of the nations of the world
But the Committee believes that the proper test is both
more complex and difficult to apply In the case of bank
loans, for example, it includes a weighing ot short- and long
term consequences and a broader and deeper assessment
of the performance of governments in relation to the

political, social, and economic well-being of their citizens
The case of South Africa, involving as it does, blatant,
systematic, legally sanctioned repression of the nation's
majority, based solely on their race or color, presents a clear
instance of justifying the end of loans to the government
The case is less clear in Chile, as it seems to the Com
mittee will be true in most other cases that are likely to come
before it In general the Committee believes that it is unlikely
to have the evidence or the depth of understanding required
to make so difficult a judgment
The Committee does wish to note that both Wells Fargo
and Chase Manhattan have developed criteria to guide their
international lending activities. Without wishing to judge the
adequacy of either set of criteria, the Committee commends
the effort and urges both banks to continue to refine their
standard as more evidence accumulates, and to maintain
carefully adherence to those standards.
Infant formula sales
The Committee cast Stanford's votes on shareholder
resolutions from three corporations involved in the sale of
infant formula in developing countries Differences in the
texts of the resolutions, as well as different results in each
case The reasons for the vote in each case follow
Bristol Meyers: The Committee decided to abstain from
voting on this resolution even though it was convinced from

the evidence before it that Bristol Meyers Company's
marketing practices fall short of the standard of respon
sibility required of a company selling a food to be used by
infants.
Specifically, the record, including the company's own
responses, shows misleading marketing practices, in
stances of label directions in a language not spoken in the
country of sale, and other practices that increase the
likelihood of unsafe use of the company's product Fur
thermore the company's record in response to justified
criticism has been to make inadequate changes, and those
only grudgingly
Had the proposal been more narrowly drawn, the
Committee would have voted for it. However, the recom
mendation that the company end the distribution of all free
samples, including those to the medical profession might
well work against the goal of responsible use of a product
that properly used, can be benficial to significant numbers of
mothers and children
In sum, the Committee's decision should be understood
as a sign of dissatisfaction with Bristol Meyers Company's
response to this problem, but dissatisfaciton, too, with the
proposed remedy
Abbott Laboratories: The Committee has cast the
University's proxies in support of management While the
underlying issues are the same as in the other two cases the

Committee considered, the Committee was impressed by
the diligence with which Abbott Laboratories has addressed
the problem Its code of marketing ethics is generally
considered the most progressive in the industry, and the
company has acted to enforce its own code.
The establishment of a review committee, as called for in
the resolution, would add little to the company's own efforts,
and the Committee believes that Abbot deserves a vote of
confidence for the way in which it is dealing with the
problem
American Home Products: The Committee voted to
cast Stanford's proxies in favor of the shareholder resolution
to ask the company to establish a committee to review its
marketing and distribution of infant formula This resolution
is identical to one proposed last year for which the University
voted.
There is no evidence in the record to show that American
Home Products has acted on its own initiative to improve its
marketing practices. The Committee urges American Home
Products to follow the example set by Abbott Laboratories
and to demonstrate in effective ways its concern for the
adverse consequences of its own practices.
