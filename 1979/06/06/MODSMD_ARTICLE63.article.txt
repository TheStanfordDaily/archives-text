Chase Manhattan Bank
Following is a May 2 letter from A. Wright Elliott,
senior vice-president and group executive, Chase
Manhattan Bank, to William D Eberle, chairman of the
Trustee Select Committee on Investment Respon
sibility, and Robert M. Rosenzweig, vice-president for
public affair';:
I am writing with regard to your letter ot April 16 to David
Rockefeller on the subject of the "Chilean resolution" at our
recent Annual Meeting.
First, let me say that we are very appreciative of the fact
that you have advised us of the action which your Select
Committee took, and more import > r iily, for letting us know
how you arrived at that position We are firm believers that
every attempt should be made to achieve a higher level of
understanding on such issues—certainly between com
panies and their shareholders, in general, but perhaps more
important, between a bank such as Chase and a shareholder
such as Stanford University.
As you can imagine, this is a terribly important issue
which has been and continues to be a high priority for our
management. It is precisely because of this that the "criteria
to guide international lending," to which you referred, were
developed. This is an area which we continue to monitor.
Let me assure you that we would welcome the op
portunity to make our views known to the Select Committee
in the future, should such an occasion arise.
There was one thing that puzzled me which I'd appreciate
clarification upon In your letter you said that the Committee
"voted against" the resolution, whereas on the document
that was attached it stated that the Committee "decided to
abstain." We would be interested in which action was taken
Again, many thanks for writing to us.
Following Ik Rosenzweig's reply:
Thank you for your good letter of May 2, 1979 and thank
you too, for the gentle way in which you called attention to
the double message in our letter of April 16 Stanford, in fact,
abstained on the Chile resolution.
Wells Fargo Bank
Following is a May 3 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig of Stanford from George F. Caulfield, senior vice
president of public relations for Wells Fargo Bank:
We appreciate your writing to Wells Fargo & Company

regarding your position on the shareholder proposals on
loans to Chile and South Africa and your concern about the
conditions in those countries.
We share your concerns. It is our hope that within the
coming year the pressures brought upon the governments of
the countries by U S companies will produce some
progressive steps
Along this line, we were encouraged by a Wall Street
Journal report this week of a South African panel recom
mending a softening of apartheid practices, and by a recent
Washinqton Post story citing economic and social im
provements in Chile Both articles indicate the action of
American business in encouraging change has been
producing positive results, albeit much more slowly than we
may desire
Wp ' ink you for commending our establishment of
criteria to guide our international lending activities I sense
from your statement and our conduct as a bank that Wells
Fargo and Stanford are not far apart on these issues, and I
would anticipate our postures will move even closer together
in the coming year
Bristol-Myers
Following is a May 11 letter to Rosenzweig of
Stanford from Frank A Sprole, vice-chairman of the
board, Bristol-Myers Company:
We acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 16 ad
vising us of the reason for the Select Committee's abstention
on voting on the resolution with respect to the marketing and
distribution of infant formula products in underdeveloped
nations submitted to the shareholders meeting of Bristol-
Myers Company, held on April 19, 1979
We were deeply distressed that the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility did not see fit to contact the
company with respect to the steps which it had taken to
answer the criticisms of the proponents of the resolution.
This is particularly true in light of the close relationship
between our company and the Oncology Center of the
Stanford Medical School. That relationship, I might add. is
based on mutual respect and a mutual desire to rid mankind
of a terrible disease We object in the strongest terms to
your questioning our standard of responsibility
We recognize that our proxy statements did not ex
tensively respond to many of the points which have been
raised in the infant formula controversy during the past few
years
The statement was brief on the advice of counsel, since
one of the proponents had instituted litigation against the
company with respect to prior proxy-soliciting material on
the same issue several years ago This lawsuit was even

tually won by the company in the court of original jurisdic
tion, and subsequently the lawsuit was settled by the sub
mission of certain material from the company and the
proponents to our stockholders. A copy of this brochure is
enclosed for your information.
It occurs to us that the University would be well-advised
to meet with representatives of the company, as well as
proponents of the resolution, prior to reaching any deter
mination concerning the vote on a particular resolution. We
would have been delighted to meet with you to discuss these
matters and clarify some of the points to which your reasons
for abstention from voting were addressed
For instance, you mention "label instructions in a
langugage not spoken in the country of sale." The
proponents have continually mentioned the fact that labels
for our product in Haiti are not in the language generally
spoken by the natives which is Creole. Our labels originally
were Spanish/English Effective in the second half of 1978,
the labels were changed to French/English We have been
informed that there are practically no instances where labels
for any product in Haiti are printed in Creole. Creole is rarely
found in written form.
As you are undoubtedly aware, during the past few years
the subject of infant feeding practices in developing
countries has received considerable attention from in
ternational health-care organizations, academic groups, and
governments.
Unfortunately, some of the available information greatly
oversimplifies and sometimes distorts the issue. It is our
impression that the overall presentation of that group
decidedly favored the proponents' position
Also enclosed is a copy of a periodical entitled The
Lactation Review, which contains an article on page 21 by
Lee Edson; a well-known science writer. This article is a well
balanced and intelligent discussion of the issue which clearly
addresses the immense complexity of fhe problem. I
commend it to you
We will be delighted to meet with the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility at any time to discuss the issues
involving our company

Service.
American Home Products
Following is a May 3 letter to Eberle and Rosenzweig
of Stanford from Carol Q. Emerling, secretary of
American Home Products Corporation:
Mr Laporte asked me to reply to your letter of April 16,

1979 and to thank you for this opportunity to respond to your
expressed concerns about the marketing of infant formula
products in developing countries.
Let me first assure you that since the time the issue of
possible misuse of our or any other company's infant for
mula products was first raised, we have taken the situation
very seriously, and we continue to do so.
We have taken several steps in the past few years to try
to assure proper use of our products. We are changing all of
our foreign labeling to make clear our long-standing com
pany policy that we support breast feeding as being the best
nutrient for infants. The pictorial instructions on the infant
formula cans are being clarified, and local languages have
been widely used in the written instructions. Even more
explicit pictorial instructions are being distributed in the
developing countries.
In addition, all of our professional service represen
tatives, who formerly were called mothercraft personnel,
were placed on straight salary with no commission or any
other type of remuneration for them related to sales.
We have continued to review the accusations made
against us by those who have been promoting for quite some
time the view that infant formula use is necessarily harmful.
We have found that the facts contradict a great many of
these charges We hope that these facts will become more
widely known as time goes on,
You will perhaps be interested to know that the Third
World countries, such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and
Taiwan, with the lowest infant mortality rates are among
those having the highest incidence of infant formula feeding
In fact, Singapore's infant mortality rate is lower than that
of the U.S. In Taiwan, almost the only infant malnutrition
experienced occurs in areas where breast feeding is the
predominant practice And in India, which is among the
countries with the highest infant mortality rates in the world,
our infant formula products are not sold
As for our infant formula products, let me say that no one
has questioned their excellent nutritional quality I believe
they are generally regarded as being a nutrient very close to
mother's milk
Our Wyeth division, which makes and distributes our
infant formula products, is a pharmaceutical company. It
markets infant formula in the same professional manner it
markets its other products. That is to say, we do not ad
vertise to consumers. We market by educating doctors and
other health professionals about the composition, nutritional
value, and proper use of our infant formula
Thank you again for allowing us the chance to share this
information with you.

American Home Products
Following is a May 3 letter to Eberle and Rosenzweig
of Stanford from Carol Q. Emerling, secretary of
American Home Products Corporation:
Mr Laporte asked me to reply to your letter of April 16,

1979 and to thank you for this opportunity to respond to your
expressed concerns about the marketing of infant formula
products in developing countries.
Let me first assure you that since the time the issue of
possible misuse of our or any other company's infant for
mula products was first raised, we have taken the situation
very seriously, and we continue to do so.
We have taken several steps in the past few years to try
to assure proper use of our products. We are changing all of
our foreign labeling to make clear our long-standing com
pany policy that we support breast feeding as being the best
nutrient for infants. The pictorial instructions on the infant
formula cans are being clarified, and local languages have
been widely used in the written instructions. Even more
explicit pictorial instructions are being distributed in the
developing countries.
In addition, all of our professional service represen
tatives, who formerly were called mothercraft personnel,
were placed on straight salary with no commission or any
other type of remuneration for them related to sales.
We have continued to review the accusations made
against us by those who have been promoting for quite some
time the view that infant formula use is necessarily harmful.
We have found that the facts contradict a great many of
these charges We hope that these facts will become more
widely known as time goes on,
You will perhaps be interested to know that the Third
World countries, such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and
Taiwan, with the lowest infant mortality rates are among
those having the highest incidence of infant formula feeding
In fact, Singapore's infant mortality rate is lower than that
of the U.S. In Taiwan, almost the only infant malnutrition
experienced occurs in areas where breast feeding is the
predominant practice And in India, which is among the
countries with the highest infant mortality rates in the world,
our infant formula products are not sold
As for our infant formula products, let me say that no one
has questioned their excellent nutritional quality I believe
they are generally regarded as being a nutrient very close to
mother's milk
Our Wyeth division, which makes and distributes our
infant formula products, is a pharmaceutical company. It
markets infant formula in the same professional manner it
markets its other products. That is to say, we do not ad
vertise to consumers. We market by educating doctors and
other health professionals about the composition, nutritional
value, and proper use of our infant formula
Thank you again for allowing us the chance to share this
information with you.

Chase Manhattan Bank
Following is a May 2 letter from A. Wright Elliott,
senior vice-president and group executive, Chase
Manhattan Bank, to William D Eberle, chairman of the
Trustee Select Committee on Investment Respon
sibility, and Robert M. Rosenzweig, vice-president for
public affair';:
I am writing with regard to your letter ot April 16 to David
Rockefeller on the subject of the "Chilean resolution" at our
recent Annual Meeting.
First, let me say that we are very appreciative of the fact
that you have advised us of the action which your Select
Committee took, and more import > r iily, for letting us know
how you arrived at that position We are firm believers that
every attempt should be made to achieve a higher level of
understanding on such issues—certainly between com
panies and their shareholders, in general, but perhaps more
important, between a bank such as Chase and a shareholder
such as Stanford University.
As you can imagine, this is a terribly important issue
which has been and continues to be a high priority for our
management. It is precisely because of this that the "criteria
to guide international lending," to which you referred, were
developed. This is an area which we continue to monitor.
Let me assure you that we would welcome the op
portunity to make our views known to the Select Committee
in the future, should such an occasion arise.
There was one thing that puzzled me which I'd appreciate
clarification upon In your letter you said that the Committee
"voted against" the resolution, whereas on the document
that was attached it stated that the Committee "decided to
abstain." We would be interested in which action was taken
Again, many thanks for writing to us.
Following Ik Rosenzweig's reply:
Thank you for your good letter of May 2, 1979 and thank
you too, for the gentle way in which you called attention to
the double message in our letter of April 16 Stanford, in fact,
abstained on the Chile resolution.
Wells Fargo Bank
Following is a May 3 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig of Stanford from George F. Caulfield, senior vice
president of public relations for Wells Fargo Bank:
We appreciate your writing to Wells Fargo & Company

regarding your position on the shareholder proposals on
loans to Chile and South Africa and your concern about the
conditions in those countries.
We share your concerns. It is our hope that within the
coming year the pressures brought upon the governments of
the countries by U S companies will produce some
progressive steps
Along this line, we were encouraged by a Wall Street
Journal report this week of a South African panel recom
mending a softening of apartheid practices, and by a recent
Washinqton Post story citing economic and social im
provements in Chile Both articles indicate the action of
American business in encouraging change has been
producing positive results, albeit much more slowly than we
may desire
Wp ' ink you for commending our establishment of
criteria to guide our international lending activities I sense
from your statement and our conduct as a bank that Wells
Fargo and Stanford are not far apart on these issues, and I
would anticipate our postures will move even closer together
in the coming year
Bristol-Myers
Following is a May 11 letter to Rosenzweig of
Stanford from Frank A Sprole, vice-chairman of the
board, Bristol-Myers Company:
We acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 16 ad
vising us of the reason for the Select Committee's abstention
on voting on the resolution with respect to the marketing and
distribution of infant formula products in underdeveloped
nations submitted to the shareholders meeting of Bristol-
Myers Company, held on April 19, 1979
We were deeply distressed that the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility did not see fit to contact the
company with respect to the steps which it had taken to
answer the criticisms of the proponents of the resolution.
This is particularly true in light of the close relationship
between our company and the Oncology Center of the
Stanford Medical School. That relationship, I might add. is
based on mutual respect and a mutual desire to rid mankind
of a terrible disease We object in the strongest terms to
your questioning our standard of responsibility
We recognize that our proxy statements did not ex
tensively respond to many of the points which have been
raised in the infant formula controversy during the past few
years
The statement was brief on the advice of counsel, since
one of the proponents had instituted litigation against the
company with respect to prior proxy-soliciting material on
the same issue several years ago This lawsuit was even

tually won by the company in the court of original jurisdic
tion, and subsequently the lawsuit was settled by the sub
mission of certain material from the company and the
proponents to our stockholders. A copy of this brochure is
enclosed for your information.
It occurs to us that the University would be well-advised
to meet with representatives of the company, as well as
proponents of the resolution, prior to reaching any deter
mination concerning the vote on a particular resolution. We
would have been delighted to meet with you to discuss these
matters and clarify some of the points to which your reasons
for abstention from voting were addressed
For instance, you mention "label instructions in a
langugage not spoken in the country of sale." The
proponents have continually mentioned the fact that labels
for our product in Haiti are not in the language generally
spoken by the natives which is Creole. Our labels originally
were Spanish/English Effective in the second half of 1978,
the labels were changed to French/English We have been
informed that there are practically no instances where labels
for any product in Haiti are printed in Creole. Creole is rarely
found in written form.
As you are undoubtedly aware, during the past few years
the subject of infant feeding practices in developing
countries has received considerable attention from in
ternational health-care organizations, academic groups, and
governments.
Unfortunately, some of the available information greatly
oversimplifies and sometimes distorts the issue. It is our
impression that the overall presentation of that group
decidedly favored the proponents' position

Fargo and Stanford are not far apart on these issues, and I

Bristol-Myers
Following is a May 11 letter to Rosenzweig of
Stanford from Frank A Sprole, vice-chairman of the
board, Bristol-Myers Company:
We acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 16 ad
vising us of the reason for the Select Committee's abstention
on voting on the resolution with respect to the marketing and
distribution of infant formula products in underdeveloped
nations submitted to the shareholders meeting of Bristol-
Myers Company, held on April 19, 1979
We were deeply distressed that the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility did not see fit to contact the
company with respect to the steps which it had taken to
answer the criticisms of the proponents of the resolution.
This is particularly true in light of the close relationship
between our company and the Oncology Center of the
Stanford Medical School. That relationship, I might add. is
based on mutual respect and a mutual desire to rid mankind
of a terrible disease We object in the strongest terms to
your questioning our standard of responsibility
We recognize that our proxy statements did not ex
tensively respond to many of the points which have been
raised in the infant formula controversy during the past few
years
The statement was brief on the advice of counsel, since
one of the proponents had instituted litigation against the
company with respect to prior proxy-soliciting material on
the same issue several years ago This lawsuit was even

tually won by the company in the court of original jurisdic
tion, and subsequently the lawsuit was settled by the sub
mission of certain material from the company and the
proponents to our stockholders. A copy of this brochure is
enclosed for your information.
It occurs to us that the University would be well-advised
to meet with representatives of the company, as well as
proponents of the resolution, prior to reaching any deter
mination concerning the vote on a particular resolution. We
would have been delighted to meet with you to discuss these
matters and clarify some of the points to which your reasons
for abstention from voting were addressed
For instance, you mention "label instructions in a
langugage not spoken in the country of sale." The
proponents have continually mentioned the fact that labels
for our product in Haiti are not in the language generally
spoken by the natives which is Creole. Our labels originally
were Spanish/English Effective in the second half of 1978,
the labels were changed to French/English We have been
informed that there are practically no instances where labels
for any product in Haiti are printed in Creole. Creole is rarely
found in written form.
As you are undoubtedly aware, during the past few years
the subject of infant feeding practices in developing
countries has received considerable attention from in
ternational health-care organizations, academic groups, and
governments.
Unfortunately, some of the available information greatly
oversimplifies and sometimes distorts the issue. It is our
impression that the overall presentation of that group
decidedly favored the proponents' position
Also enclosed is a copy of a periodical entitled The
Lactation Review, which contains an article on page 21 by
Lee Edson; a well-known science writer. This article is a well
balanced and intelligent discussion of the issue which clearly
addresses the immense complexity of fhe problem. I
commend it to you
We will be delighted to meet with the Committee on In
vestment Responsibility at any time to discuss the issues
involving our company

American Home Products
Following is a May 3 letter to Eberle and Rosenzweig
of Stanford from Carol Q. Emerling, secretary of
American Home Products Corporation:
Mr Laporte asked me to reply to your letter of April 16,

1979 and to thank you for this opportunity to respond to your
expressed concerns about the marketing of infant formula
products in developing countries.
Let me first assure you that since the time the issue of
possible misuse of our or any other company's infant for
mula products was first raised, we have taken the situation
very seriously, and we continue to do so.
We have taken several steps in the past few years to try
to assure proper use of our products. We are changing all of
our foreign labeling to make clear our long-standing com
pany policy that we support breast feeding as being the best
nutrient for infants. The pictorial instructions on the infant
formula cans are being clarified, and local languages have
been widely used in the written instructions. Even more
explicit pictorial instructions are being distributed in the
developing countries.
In addition, all of our professional service represen
tatives, who formerly were called mothercraft personnel,
were placed on straight salary with no commission or any
other type of remuneration for them related to sales.
We have continued to review the accusations made
against us by those who have been promoting for quite some
time the view that infant formula use is necessarily harmful.
We have found that the facts contradict a great many of
these charges We hope that these facts will become more
widely known as time goes on,
You will perhaps be interested to know that the Third
World countries, such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and
Taiwan, with the lowest infant mortality rates are among
those having the highest incidence of infant formula feeding
In fact, Singapore's infant mortality rate is lower than that
of the U.S. In Taiwan, almost the only infant malnutrition
experienced occurs in areas where breast feeding is the
predominant practice And in India, which is among the
countries with the highest infant mortality rates in the world,
our infant formula products are not sold
As for our infant formula products, let me say that no one
has questioned their excellent nutritional quality I believe
they are generally regarded as being a nutrient very close to
mother's milk
Our Wyeth division, which makes and distributes our
infant formula products, is a pharmaceutical company. It
markets infant formula in the same professional manner it
markets its other products. That is to say, we do not ad
vertise to consumers. We market by educating doctors and
other health professionals about the composition, nutritional
value, and proper use of our infant formula
Thank you again for allowing us the chance to share this
information with you.

Chase Manhattan Bank
Following is a May 2 letter from A. Wright Elliott,
senior vice-president and group executive, Chase
Manhattan Bank, to William D Eberle, chairman of the
Trustee Select Committee on Investment Respon
sibility, and Robert M. Rosenzweig, vice-president for
public affair';:
I am writing with regard to your letter ot April 16 to David
Rockefeller on the subject of the "Chilean resolution" at our
recent Annual Meeting.
First, let me say that we are very appreciative of the fact
that you have advised us of the action which your Select
Committee took, and more import > r iily, for letting us know
how you arrived at that position We are firm believers that
every attempt should be made to achieve a higher level of
understanding on such issues—certainly between com
panies and their shareholders, in general, but perhaps more
important, between a bank such as Chase and a shareholder
such as Stanford University.
As you can imagine, this is a terribly important issue
which has been and continues to be a high priority for our
management. It is precisely because of this that the "criteria
to guide international lending," to which you referred, were
developed. This is an area which we continue to monitor.
Let me assure you that we would welcome the op
portunity to make our views known to the Select Committee
in the future, should such an occasion arise.
There was one thing that puzzled me which I'd appreciate
clarification upon In your letter you said that the Committee
"voted against" the resolution, whereas on the document
that was attached it stated that the Committee "decided to
abstain." We would be interested in which action was taken
Again, many thanks for writing to us.
Following Ik Rosenzweig's reply:
Thank you for your good letter of May 2, 1979 and thank
you too, for the gentle way in which you called attention to
the double message in our letter of April 16 Stanford, in fact,
abstained on the Chile resolution.
Wells Fargo Bank
Following is a May 3 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig of Stanford from George F. Caulfield, senior vice
president of public relations for Wells Fargo Bank:
We appreciate your writing to Wells Fargo & Company

regarding your position on the shareholder proposals on
loans to Chile and South Africa and your concern about the
conditions in those countries.
We share your concerns. It is our hope that within the
coming year the pressures brought upon the governments of
the countries by U S companies will produce some
progressive steps
Along this line, we were encouraged by a Wall Street
Journal report this week of a South African panel recom
mending a softening of apartheid practices, and by a recent
Washinqton Post story citing economic and social im
provements in Chile Both articles indicate the action of
American business in encouraging change has been
producing positive results, albeit much more slowly than we
may desire
Wp ' ink you for commending our establishment of
criteria to guide our international lending activities I sense
from your statement and our conduct as a bank that Wells
Fargo and Stanford are not far apart on these issues, and I
would anticipate our postures will move even closer together
in the coming year
