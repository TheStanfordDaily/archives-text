## Text of letters from Stanford officials to corporate executives on South Africa proxy issues—and company replies 
### 
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and
colored employees, but concluded that these have been
insufficient and do not constitute adequate movement
toward compliance with the Sullivan Principles.
Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, U.S. Steel Corporation (April 27y.
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies in support of a shareholder
resolution calling on the company to forego expansion of its
operations in South Africa. You may recall that Stanford
voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The
Committee was not persuaded that anything had changed in
the intervening period to cause it to change its mind.
At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the
Committee recognized that it is imperfect in several
respects, but its main thrust —the importance of en
couraging trade union organization among black workers —
was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade
unions can be a major instrument for the improvement of the
lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where
they exist, but to liquidate loans to the government as soon
as existing commitments make that possible, and to enter
into no new loans.
The case of South Africa is virtually unique in the world It
is a case in which the laws of the nation impose blatant and
systematic deprivations on the majority of the population,
based solely on race and color While Stanford has not in the
past voted against loans to the private sector, the arguments
for ending loans to the government seems clear and com
pelling
The Committee voted against resolutions calling on the
bank to end loans to Communist bloc nations In contrast to
the South Africa resolution, this one was vague, overly
broad, and did not demonstrate even the possibility that the
action called for might affect the evil complained against
The Committee's vote, therefore, should not be understood
as a judgment by it of the relative size or seriousness of
human rights deprivations in one country as against another.
— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy
votes in support of a shareholder resolution which calls on
Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that
shows Exxon to be among the most progressive of American
corporations in the management of the South African
operations. Management deserves commendation and
support for those efforts. /Our Committee believes that
American business can, by the power of enlightened
example, help to produce change in South Africa for those
who suffer most from apartheid; it also believes that, in
general, expansion is the wrong course for American
business in the absence of evidence that the system, itself,
is being dismantled.
To bring enlightened pressure in existing operations is a
constructive act; to expand in the face of aovernment in
transigence seems to display indifference to a social system
that is universally condemned by people of conscience.
We recognize that the message we are conveying to you
is a mixed one, but we believe that it reflects reality in a very
difficult set of circumstances. We hope that Exxon
management will see fit to announce that it does not intend
to expand its operations in South Africa
— Exxon response
Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,
manager, Investor Relations Division, Exxon Cor
poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we
cannot pretend that the actions of Exxon are having a major
impact on the well-being of nonwhites in the Republic as a
whole However, we believe that our policies and per
formance have been beneficial to all our employees, in
cluding our nonwhite employees Their future welfare would
seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and
colored employees, but concluded that these have been
insufficient and do not constitute adequate movement
toward compliance with the Sullivan Principles.
Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, U.S. Steel Corporation (April 27y.
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies in support of a shareholder
resolution calling on the company to forego expansion of its
operations in South Africa. You may recall that Stanford
voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The
Committee was not persuaded that anything had changed in
the intervening period to cause it to change its mind.
At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the

was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade

lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where

— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy
votes in support of a shareholder resolution which calls on
Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that
shows Exxon to be among the most progressive of American
corporations in the management of the South African
operations. Management deserves commendation and
support for those efforts. /Our Committee believes that
American business can, by the power of enlightened
example, help to produce change in South Africa for those
who suffer most from apartheid; it also believes that, in
general, expansion is the wrong course for American
business in the absence of evidence that the system, itself,
is being dismantled.
To bring enlightened pressure in existing operations is a
constructive act; to expand in the face of aovernment in
transigence seems to display indifference to a social system
that is universally condemned by people of conscience.
We recognize that the message we are conveying to you
is a mixed one, but we believe that it reflects reality in a very
difficult set of circumstances. We hope that Exxon
management will see fit to announce that it does not intend
to expand its operations in South Africa
— Exxon response
Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,
manager, Investor Relations Division, Exxon Cor
poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we
cannot pretend that the actions of Exxon are having a major
impact on the well-being of nonwhites in the Republic as a
whole However, we believe that our policies and per
formance have been beneficial to all our employees, in
cluding our nonwhite employees Their future welfare would
seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and
colored employees, but concluded that these have been
insufficient and do not constitute adequate movement
toward compliance with the Sullivan Principles.
Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, U.S. Steel Corporation (April 27y.
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies in support of a shareholder
resolution calling on the company to forego expansion of its
operations in South Africa. You may recall that Stanford
voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The
Committee was not persuaded that anything had changed in
the intervening period to cause it to change its mind.
At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the
Committee recognized that it is imperfect in several
respects, but its main thrust —the importance of en
couraging trade union organization among black workers —
was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade
unions can be a major instrument for the improvement of the
lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where
they exist, but to liquidate loans to the government as soon
as existing commitments make that possible, and to enter
into no new loans.
The case of South Africa is virtually unique in the world It
is a case in which the laws of the nation impose blatant and
systematic deprivations on the majority of the population,
based solely on race and color While Stanford has not in the
past voted against loans to the private sector, the arguments
for ending loans to the government seems clear and com
pelling
The Committee voted against resolutions calling on the
bank to end loans to Communist bloc nations In contrast to
the South Africa resolution, this one was vague, overly
broad, and did not demonstrate even the possibility that the
action called for might affect the evil complained against
The Committee's vote, therefore, should not be understood
as a judgment by it of the relative size or seriousness of
human rights deprivations in one country as against another.
— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy
votes in support of a shareholder resolution which calls on
Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that
shows Exxon to be among the most progressive of American
corporations in the management of the South African
operations. Management deserves commendation and
support for those efforts. /Our Committee believes that
American business can, by the power of enlightened
example, help to produce change in South Africa for those
who suffer most from apartheid; it also believes that, in
general, expansion is the wrong course for American
business in the absence of evidence that the system, itself,
is being dismantled.
To bring enlightened pressure in existing operations is a

transigence seems to display indifference to a social system
that is universally condemned by people of conscience.
We recognize that the message we are conveying to you
is a mixed one, but we believe that it reflects reality in a very
difficult set of circumstances. We hope that Exxon
management will see fit to announce that it does not intend
to expand its operations in South Africa
— Exxon response
Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,
manager, Investor Relations Division, Exxon Cor
poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we
cannot pretend that the actions of Exxon are having a major

formance have been beneficial to all our employees, in
cluding our nonwhite employees Their future welfare would
seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and
colored employees, but concluded that these have been
insufficient and do not constitute adequate movement
toward compliance with the Sullivan Principles.
Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, U.S. Steel Corporation (April 27y.
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies in support of a shareholder
resolution calling on the company to forego expansion of its
operations in South Africa. You may recall that Stanford
voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The
Committee was not persuaded that anything had changed in
the intervening period to cause it to change its mind.
At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the
Committee recognized that it is imperfect in several
respects, but its main thrust —the importance of en
couraging trade union organization among black workers —
was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade
unions can be a major instrument for the improvement of the
lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where
they exist, but to liquidate loans to the government as soon
as existing commitments make that possible, and to enter
into no new loans.
The case of South Africa is virtually unique in the world It
is a case in which the laws of the nation impose blatant and
systematic deprivations on the majority of the population,
based solely on race and color While Stanford has not in the
past voted against loans to the private sector, the arguments
for ending loans to the government seems clear and com
pelling
The Committee voted against resolutions calling on the
bank to end loans to Communist bloc nations In contrast to
the South Africa resolution, this one was vague, overly
broad, and did not demonstrate even the possibility that the
action called for might affect the evil complained against
The Committee's vote, therefore, should not be understood
as a judgment by it of the relative size or seriousness of
human rights deprivations in one country as against another.
— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy
votes in support of a shareholder resolution which calls on
Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that
shows Exxon to be among the most progressive of American
corporations in the management of the South African
operations. Management deserves commendation and
support for those efforts. /Our Committee believes that
American business can, by the power of enlightened
example, help to produce change in South Africa for those
who suffer most from apartheid; it also believes that, in
general, expansion is the wrong course for American
business in the absence of evidence that the system, itself,
is being dismantled.
To bring enlightened pressure in existing operations is a
constructive act; to expand in the face of aovernment in
transigence seems to display indifference to a social system
that is universally condemned by people of conscience.
We recognize that the message we are conveying to you
is a mixed one, but we believe that it reflects reality in a very
difficult set of circumstances. We hope that Exxon
management will see fit to announce that it does not intend
to expand its operations in South Africa
— Exxon response
Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,
manager, Investor Relations Division, Exxon Cor
poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we
cannot pretend that the actions of Exxon are having a major
impact on the well-being of nonwhites in the Republic as a
whole However, we believe that our policies and per
formance have been beneficial to all our employees, in
cluding our nonwhite employees Their future welfare would
seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and
colored employees, but concluded that these have been
insufficient and do not constitute adequate movement
toward compliance with the Sullivan Principles.
Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, U.S. Steel Corporation (April 27y.
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies in support of a shareholder
resolution calling on the company to forego expansion of its
operations in South Africa. You may recall that Stanford
voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The
Committee was not persuaded that anything had changed in
the intervening period to cause it to change its mind.
At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the
Committee recognized that it is imperfect in several

was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade
unions can be a major instrument for the improvement of the
lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where
they exist, but to liquidate loans to the government as soon
as existing commitments make that possible, and to enter
into no new loans.
The case of South Africa is virtually unique in the world It
is a case in which the laws of the nation impose blatant and
systematic deprivations on the majority of the population,
based solely on race and color While Stanford has not in the
past voted against loans to the private sector, the arguments
for ending loans to the government seems clear and com
pelling
The Committee voted against resolutions calling on the
bank to end loans to Communist bloc nations In contrast to
the South Africa resolution, this one was vague, overly
broad, and did not demonstrate even the possibility that the
action called for might affect the evil complained against
The Committee's vote, therefore, should not be understood
as a judgment by it of the relative size or seriousness of
human rights deprivations in one country as against another.
— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and

We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford

Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until

poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and

economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in

The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and

We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the

We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted

National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in

occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and
colored employees, but concluded that these have been
insufficient and do not constitute adequate movement
toward compliance with the Sullivan Principles.
Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, U.S. Steel Corporation (April 27y.
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies in support of a shareholder
resolution calling on the company to forego expansion of its
operations in South Africa. You may recall that Stanford
voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The
Committee was not persuaded that anything had changed in
the intervening period to cause it to change its mind.
At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the
Committee recognized that it is imperfect in several
respects, but its main thrust —the importance of en
couraging trade union organization among black workers —
was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade
unions can be a major instrument for the improvement of the
lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where
they exist, but to liquidate loans to the government as soon
as existing commitments make that possible, and to enter
into no new loans.
The case of South Africa is virtually unique in the world It
is a case in which the laws of the nation impose blatant and
systematic deprivations on the majority of the population,
based solely on race and color While Stanford has not in the
past voted against loans to the private sector, the arguments
for ending loans to the government seems clear and com
pelling
The Committee voted against resolutions calling on the
bank to end loans to Communist bloc nations In contrast to
the South Africa resolution, this one was vague, overly
broad, and did not demonstrate even the possibility that the
action called for might affect the evil complained against
The Committee's vote, therefore, should not be understood
as a judgment by it of the relative size or seriousness of
human rights deprivations in one country as against another.
— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy
votes in support of a shareholder resolution which calls on
Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that
shows Exxon to be among the most progressive of American
corporations in the management of the South African
operations. Management deserves commendation and
support for those efforts. /Our Committee believes that
American business can, by the power of enlightened
example, help to produce change in South Africa for those
who suffer most from apartheid; it also believes that, in
general, expansion is the wrong course for American
business in the absence of evidence that the system, itself,
is being dismantled.
To bring enlightened pressure in existing operations is a
constructive act; to expand in the face of aovernment in
transigence seems to display indifference to a social system
that is universally condemned by people of conscience.
We recognize that the message we are conveying to you
is a mixed one, but we believe that it reflects reality in a very
difficult set of circumstances. We hope that Exxon
management will see fit to announce that it does not intend
to expand its operations in South Africa
— Exxon response
Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,
manager, Investor Relations Division, Exxon Cor
poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we
cannot pretend that the actions of Exxon are having a major
impact on the well-being of nonwhites in the Republic as a
whole However, we believe that our policies and per
formance have been beneficial to all our employees, in
cluding our nonwhite employees Their future welfare would
seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and

Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent

At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the

Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the

evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead

To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief

The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of

Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,

— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy
votes in support of a shareholder resolution which calls on
Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that
shows Exxon to be among the most progressive of American
corporations in the management of the South African
operations. Management deserves commendation and
support for those efforts. /Our Committee believes that
American business can, by the power of enlightened
example, help to produce change in South Africa for those
who suffer most from apartheid; it also believes that, in
general, expansion is the wrong course for American
business in the absence of evidence that the system, itself,
is being dismantled.
To bring enlightened pressure in existing operations is a
constructive act; to expand in the face of aovernment in
transigence seems to display indifference to a social system
that is universally condemned by people of conscience.
We recognize that the message we are conveying to you
is a mixed one, but we believe that it reflects reality in a very
difficult set of circumstances. We hope that Exxon
management will see fit to announce that it does not intend
to expand its operations in South Africa
— Exxon response
Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,
manager, Investor Relations Division, Exxon Cor
poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we
cannot pretend that the actions of Exxon are having a major
impact on the well-being of nonwhites in the Republic as a
whole However, we believe that our policies and per
formance have been beneficial to all our employees, in
cluding our nonwhite employees Their future welfare would
seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and
colored employees, but concluded that these have been
insufficient and do not constitute adequate movement
toward compliance with the Sullivan Principles.
Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, U.S. Steel Corporation (April 27y.
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies in support of a shareholder
resolution calling on the company to forego expansion of its
operations in South Africa. You may recall that Stanford
voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The
Committee was not persuaded that anything had changed in
the intervening period to cause it to change its mind.
At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the
Committee recognized that it is imperfect in several
respects, but its main thrust —the importance of en
couraging trade union organization among black workers —
was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade
unions can be a major instrument for the improvement of the
lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where
they exist, but to liquidate loans to the government as soon
as existing commitments make that possible, and to enter
into no new loans.
The case of South Africa is virtually unique in the world It
is a case in which the laws of the nation impose blatant and
systematic deprivations on the majority of the population,
based solely on race and color While Stanford has not in the
past voted against loans to the private sector, the arguments
for ending loans to the government seems clear and com
pelling
The Committee voted against resolutions calling on the
bank to end loans to Communist bloc nations In contrast to
the South Africa resolution, this one was vague, overly
broad, and did not demonstrate even the possibility that the
action called for might affect the evil complained against
The Committee's vote, therefore, should not be understood
as a judgment by it of the relative size or seriousness of
human rights deprivations in one country as against another.
— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy

Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that

Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,

poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we

seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
Following are the substantive portions of letters sent
to corporate executives by William Eberle, chairman of
the Board of Trustees Select Committee on Investment
Responsibility, and Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
for public affairs, concerning the University's stock
proxy votes.
In each case, recipients were told the University
would be most interested in their comments on these
matters and advised that the University would make
public any replies which were received.
Phillips Petroleum
To: W.F. Martin, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Phillips Petroleum Company (April 27).
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast Stan
ford's proxy votes in support of a shareholder resolution
which calls on Phillips Petroleum to withdraw from its South
African holdings if significant progress toward compliance
with the Sullivan Principles is not made by the end of 1979
In casting these votes, the Committee was aware of the
steps taken by management with respect to black and

Management's assertion that its powers are limited
because it owns only 50© of Phillips Carbon Black are not
persuasive in the absence of evidence that the company had
made genuine efforts to move toward compliance but has
been frustrated by the resistance of the coowners
We hope, by the end of the year, to see a serious effort to
put the Sullivan Principles into effect, and we shall look for
evidence of those efforts in evaluating similar shareholder
resolutions in the future.
— Phillips response
Following is a May 21 letter to Rosenzweig of Stan
ford from Sloan K. Childers, vice-president, public af
fairs, Phillips Petroleum Company.
This is in response to your and Mr. Eberle's letter to Mr
W F Martin advising us that the Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility of Stanford University had cast its
proxy votes in favor of the stockholder resolution concerning
South Africa and why it did so Mr. Martin has asked that I
reply
We regret the Committee's decision to support the
resolution as, in our opinion, we have urged and are urging
the Company's compliance with the principles to the extent
possible consistent with our ownership.
As you may know, a vice-president of Phillips has the
responsibility of working with the Board of Directors of the
carbon black company to implement improvements in ac
cordance with the Sullivan Principles He has been to South
Africa twice and met with the Board for this purpose, visiting
the plants of other endorsers of the principles while there.
After his return about two months ago from his most recent
trip, he reported improvements are being made although
major structural alterations will be necessry to effect the
desegregation of the dining, comfort, and other facilities
The responsibile official is staying abreast of the situation
and will continue his visits periodically and press for further
compliance with the principles
U.S. Steel
To: David M. Roderick, chairman of the board and chief

The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of

voted in support of a similar resolution last year. The

At the same time, the Committee asked us to convey to
management its praise for U.S. Steel'«'6trong support of the
Urban Foundation through its partner, Anglo Transvaal
Consolidated Investments. That important enterprise
provides one of the few reasons to believe that effective and
enlightened action is possible in South Africa, by South
Africans. Support of its activities is, indeed, commendable.
Union Carbide
To: William S. Sneath, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Union Carbide Corporation (April
27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsiblity of the
Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to abstain
from casting its proxies on the shareholder resolution calling
for Union Carbide to withdraw from its South African
business operations. The Committee asked us to convey to
you the reasons for its abstention.
Stanford University has attempted to examine the merits
of each case in which it has been called on to judge whether
a company in which it owns stock should continue to do
business in South Africa, Clearly, underlying such a practice
is the view that, however abhorrent the evil of apartheid, it is
possible for American business, by enlightened action and
example, to ameliorate its effects for those who suffer most
from them
Central to that belief is corporate adherence to the
Sullivan Principles Our Committee was not convinced by the
evidence available to it that Union Carbide has been as
vigorous in putting those principles into action as its
responsibilities require it to be
Those responsibilities seem to us clear. Union Carbide
was an early signer of the Sullivan Principles, and its ac
tivities in the mining industry are a critical part of South
Africa's economic strength. That combination gives Union
Carbide a unique opportunity to demonstrate the con
structive force of progressive practices.
We have abstained because we do not believe that the
company has vigorously pursued the opportunity available to
it We shall look with great interest for further evidence in the
year ahead
Eastman Kodak
To: Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Eastman Kodak Company (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes against a shareholder resolution
urging further limitations with respect to Kodak's sales in
South Africa
In casting these votes the Committee was impressed by
evidence that Eastman Kodak has been a ieade r among
American business in adopting progressive policies in South
Africa We were explicitly asked to commend management
for tneir actions, and to urge that the company use its
demonstrated concern as the basis for even further im
provement In that spirit, the Committee hopes that
management will examine caretufty the possibility that its

present policy governing the possible use of its products for
repressive purposes might be improved by being made more
explicit and perhaps more comprehensive We have no
specific langauge to propose, but management's past
record leads us to believe that careful study of the matter
could be productive and enhance still further Eastman
Kodak's reputation for enlightened policy in this very
troublesome area.
Mobil Oil
To: Rawleigh Warren, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Mobil Oil Corporation (April 27V'
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of Mobil Oil. The Committee voted
against the resolutions concerning oil for Rhodesia and price
fixing, but voted in favor of the resolution which urges Mobil
Oil to be more receptive to the organization of black labor
unions in its South African operations. The Committee
wished us to convey to you its reasons for that last vote
In casting the University's votes for this resolution, the
Committee recognized that it is imperfect in several
respects, but its main thrust —the importance of en
couraging trade union organization among black workers —
was important enough to overcome the defects. There is a
substantial body of informed opinion to which the Committee
gave heavy weight, that holds that the development of trade
unions can be a major instrument for the improvement of the
lives of black workers. Some companies have
responded in their South-Africa operations, and we believe
that all American companies have a similar obligation if
they're to justify their presence in South Africa as a force for
change for the better.
The Committee noted management s response that its
policies with respect to unionization in South Africa are not
different from its policies elsewhere The Committee
believes that this misses the essential point that South
Africa is different from any place else in which the company
does business That difference—systematic suppression of
the nation's majority, based solely on their race and color—
requires American companies doing business in South
Africa to fit their policies to that nation's extraordinary
circumstances Unionization of black workers is a par
ticularly good example of a case in which Mobil Oil can
respond creatively and progressively, as others are doing,
and thereby justify by its actions the claim that its presence
in South Africa is beneficial to those who most need help.
Bank of America
To: A. W. Clausen, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. Bank of America (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's votes on several shareholder resolutions before
the annual meeting of the Bank of America
In addition to voting against a shareholder resolution
involving loans and perquisites of corporate officers, the
Committee cast the University's votes on two other issues,
and we have been asked to convey the reasons for them to
you.
The Committee cast the University's proxies for a
resolution calling on the Bank of America to make no new
loans to the government of South Africa or its in
strumentalities In casting its votes, the Committee
recognized that it is sometimes the case that existing loans
contain explicit or implicit commitments for renewals at the
expiration date of the original loan. The Committee would
expect the bank to honor such binding commitments where
they exist, but to liquidate loans to the government as soon
as existing commitments make that possible, and to enter
into no new loans.
The case of South Africa is virtually unique in the world It
is a case in which the laws of the nation impose blatant and
systematic deprivations on the majority of the population,
based solely on race and color While Stanford has not in the
past voted against loans to the private sector, the arguments
for ending loans to the government seems clear and com
pelling
The Committee voted against resolutions calling on the
bank to end loans to Communist bloc nations In contrast to
the South Africa resolution, this one was vague, overly
broad, and did not demonstrate even the possibility that the
action called for might affect the evil complained against
The Committee's vote, therefore, should not be understood
as a judgment by it of the relative size or seriousness of
human rights deprivations in one country as against another.
— B of A response
Following is a May 7 letter to Eberle and Rosenz
weig from A. W Clausen, president, BankAmerica
Corp.:
Thank you for your letter of April 27 explaining the
Stanford Investment Responsibility Committee's votes on
shareholder proposals considered at Bank America's recent
annual meeting.
As you read in Bank America's proxy statement, we find
more similarities than differences in the proposals to cease
doing business with the Government of South Africa and
communist governments and countries
These proposals would have us decide which govern
ments BankAmerica should do business with abroad on the
basis of their respective threats to human rights. While your
committee treats South Africa as a unique case, from our
perspective the adoption of a human rights standard with
regard to South Africa would require that we recognize its
applicability generally.
Your committee also distinguishes between the
resolutions on the grounds that the communist resolutions
were vague and overly broad and also failed the pragmatic
test of possibly ameliorating the evil complained of
Regarding your first point, the drafter of one of the
communist country resolutions closely followed the
language of the South African resolution, while the other
communist country resolution was quite detailed and
enumerated exactly which countries were deemed com
munist entities.
As to the test of pragmatism, it is not clear to us that the
withdrawal of public sector funding in South Africa would
have a positive effect upon ending apartheid It may interest
you to know that, at the annual meeting, the proponent of
one communist country resolution argued for yet another
"pragmatic distinction boycotting of communist countries
would not require that other nations (presumably including
South Africa) be boycotted because these other nations do
not threaten America's security.
In addition, while a pragmatic test may have appeal
among concerned shareholders, it is perhaps a more ap
propriate consideration for the U.S. government to employ
than for private corporations doing business worldwide
Despite our differing positions on these resolutions, you
should know that we share your basic concerns about
apartheid ,
Bank America's lending in South Africa is restrained,
there being no loans outstanding to the Republic of South
Africa at this time. Lending continues primarily to the private
sector for short-term, trade-related transactions, with the
total loan portfolio considerably reduced from year-ago
levels.

Exxon
To: Mr. C.C. Garvin, Jr., chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, Exxon Corporation (May 11):
We are writing to inform you of the decision by the Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees to cast the University's proxy
votes in support of a shareholder resolution which calls on
Exxon to refrain from further investment in South Africa until
the government commits itself to ending apartheid.
The Committee noted with approval the evidence that
shows Exxon to be among the most progressive of American
corporations in the management of the South African
operations. Management deserves commendation and
support for those efforts. /Our Committee believes that
American business can, by the power of enlightened
example, help to produce change in South Africa for those
who suffer most from apartheid; it also believes that, in
general, expansion is the wrong course for American
business in the absence of evidence that the system, itself,
is being dismantled.
To bring enlightened pressure in existing operations is a
constructive act; to expand in the face of aovernment in
transigence seems to display indifference to a social system
that is universally condemned by people of conscience.
We recognize that the message we are conveying to you
is a mixed one, but we believe that it reflects reality in a very
difficult set of circumstances. We hope that Exxon
management will see fit to announce that it does not intend
to expand its operations in South Africa
— Exxon response
Following is a May 25 letter from Matthew F. Kane,
manager, Investor Relations Division, Exxon Cor
poration to William D. Eberle and Robert M. Rosenzweig.
Mr Garvin has asked me to acknowledge the receipt of
your recent letter. We appreciate the Select Committee on
Investment Responsibility's commendation of the
management of our South African operations.
Enclosed for you and your associates are three copies of
the publication, "Highlights of Exxon's Operations in South
Africa." [On file at News & Publications Service ] We believe
that this statement provides a comprehensive description of
our activities in and policies regarding that nation
For your information, Exxon has long supported the
"Statement of Principles" concerning employment practices
in South Africa which was developed and promoted mainly
by Reverend Leon Sullivan We believe that the principles in
the statement, copy enclosed, are compatible with Exxon's
own long standing objectives and existing programs and
actions in South Africa
The primary incentive for Exxon's affiliates to adopt
progressive employment practices in South Africa, as
elsewhere, has been one of enlightened self-interest. Given
the limited size and scope of our business in South Africa, we
cannot pretend that the actions of Exxon are having a major
impact on the well-being of nonwhites in the Republic as a
whole However, we believe that our policies and per
formance have been beneficial to all our employees, in
cluding our nonwhite employees Their future welfare would
seem to depend, among other things, upon an adequate and
growing economic base
The question of the impact of U.S. business operations on
the South African policy of apartheid is an issue which is
being raised by responsible, thoughtful individuals and
groups, and equally by the multinational corporations with
operations there It is an issue that requires continuing fact
finding and analysis of all on-going developments—
economic, political, social as well as philosophical. As stated
in the 1979 Proxy Statement, any future decision regarding
investment in South Africa will take most carefully into
account the conditions prevailing at that time.
Thank you for taking the time to write on an issue of
concern to us all.
Ford Motor Co.
To: Henry Ford 11, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Ford Motor Company, (May 11):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
Stanford's proxies in support of a shareholder resolution
calling on the company to halt sales by its South African
subsidiary of vehicles and parts to the military and police
forces of that nation.
In casting these votes, the Committee was quite con
scious of Ford's deserved reputation as one of the most
progressive of American companies doing business in South
Africa. The Committee commends Ford management for its
early subscription to the Sullivan Principles, its con
scientious efforts to make them work, and its recognition of a
blaqk trade union. If American business can have a con
structive effect in South Africa, the policies and practices of
the Ford Motor Company will have made an important
contribution.
The issue raised by the resolution is a different one,
however. There is no question that the sales at issue, if made
by Ford from its domestic production, would be contrary to
American government policy. The Committee concluded
that, even though American policy does not reach the sales
in question because the actual production is carried out in
South Africa, Ford should not be satisfied to rest its policy on
that technical distinction.
The purpose of the embargo on sales to the police and
military in South Africa seems clear and the policy sound.
We believe that Ford should honor that purpose, even
though the law does not require it to do so, because it is right
to do so, and because doing so is consistent with the
enlightened stance Ford has adopted in other aspects of its
South African operations.
We should report in conclusion that the Committee noted
the dispute over the possible effect of the (South African)
National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that Ford
were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to the
Committee unlikely that the government would, in fact, in
voke the provisions of that Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequence of such an action, were it to
occur.
General Motors
To: Thomas A. Murphy, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer, General Motors Corporation
(May 23):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has voted to cast
the University's proxies on two issues before General Motors
stockholders involving the company's South African
operations. The University's votes were cast against the
shareholder resolution which called on the company to
withdraw from South Africa and in favor of the resolution
asking the company to halt sales of vehicles, spare parts,
and services to the South African military and police.
The Ccwimittee was moved to its vote on the latter
resolution by the knowledge that the sales at issue, if made
from General Motors' domestic production, would be
contrary to American government policy. The Committee
concluded that, even though American policy does not reach
the sales in question because the actual production is
carried out in South Africa, GM should not be satisfied to rest

its policy on that technical distinction. The purpose of the
American embargo on sales to the police and military in
South Africa is clear and the policy sound. We believe that
GM should honor that purpose, even though the law does not
require it to do so. because it is right to do so. and because
to do so is consistent with the forward-looking stance GM
has adopted in other aspects of its South African operations.
The Committee noted the dispute over the possible effect
of the National Supplies Procurement Act, in the event that
GM were to adopt the policy being urged on it. It seemed to
the Committee doubtful that the government would, in fact,
invoke the provisions of the Act and require the sales in
question, and therefore the Committee reached no con
clusions about the consequences of such an action, were it
to occur.
Finally, we were asked to convey to you our disap
pointment that GM failed to complete the questionnaire on
its South African activities sent it by the South African
Review Service of IRRC.
In order not to burden management with a host of
separate requests for information, many colleges and
universities have been relying on organizations like IRRC to
provide them with a common body of information on the
issues that will be before them each year. It is essential that
management cooperate in that effort or the system cannot
work, companies will be taxed even more heavily by
requests for different information in different formats, and
the quality of institutional decision-making will suffer. We
strongly urge GM management to cooperate in the future.
We would be most interested in your comments on these
matters we should tell you that it is our practice to make
public both our letter to management and replies to them.
