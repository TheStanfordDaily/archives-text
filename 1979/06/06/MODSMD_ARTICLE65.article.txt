# Investment in Chile
## 
### 
To: Howard B. Keck, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, Superior Oil Company (May 11):
We are writing to inform you that the Select Committee
on Investment Responsibility of the Stanford University
Board of Trustees has cast the University's proxy votes
against a shareholder resolution which would have had
Superior Oil Company refrain from further investment in
Chile.
It was the Committee's view that the resolution's
proponents had not carried the burden of demonstrating that
the company's activities contribute to substantial social
injury in Chile, or that limiting those activities would mitigate
the deprivations of human rights with which the government
of Chile has been charged.
At the same time, we were asked by the Committee to
convey to you its serious misgivings about the unwillingness
of management to explain its opposition to the resolution
either to its own stockholders or to the Investor Respon
sibility Research Center, a group on which we are heavily
dependent for information about shareholder resolutions.
Our Committee has made a serious effort to avoid reflexive
or doctrinaire responses to the issues that have come before
it. The refusal of management to provide a thoughtful but
tress for its position not only makes our task more difficult,
but inevitably raises a question about the sensitivity of
management to the possibility that its actions may have
adverse consequences, and that those consequences
should be considered in corporate deliberations.
As you will see from the copy of the enclosed letter to
IRRC, the Committee was also displeased with the way in
which the issue was presented by that group. To what extent
those deficiencies were related to the company's un
willingness to cooperate we cannot say, but that a statement
from the company would have balanced the presentation we
have no doubt at all. We urge management to be more
forthcoming in the future.
Following is a May 14 letter from Rosenzweig of
Stanford to Margaret Carroll, executive director, In
vestor Responsibility Research Center, Inc.:
Enclosed for your information is a copy of a letter we
have written to Mr. Howard Keck of Superior Oil Company on
behalf of the Select Committee on Investment Responsibility
of the Stanford University Board of Trustees
You will note that while our Committee was critical of
management for its refusal to present its side of the case, it
was also critical of IRRC for what seemed —in tone at
least —an unbalanced presentation of the case.
The Committee was struck, for example, by the
statement that Sueprior Oil is the highest price stock traded
on the New York Stock Exchange. While that is true, it has no
bearing on the issue that might well be interpreted as an
indirect and gratuitous effort to portray the company as rich
and powerful in contrast to those who are challenging it.
We do not, of course, know why that particular fact was
thought relevant, but we do urge IRRC to avoid calling into
question the dispassionate nature of its analyses by in
cluding irrelevant, and to some pejorative, characterizations.
