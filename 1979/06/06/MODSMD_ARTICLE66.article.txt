To: Lyman C. Hamilton, Jr., president and chief
executive officer, International Telephone and
Telegraph (April 27):
The Select Committee on Investment Responsibility of
the Stanford University Board of Trustees has cast the
University's proxy votes on two shareholder resolutions
before your annual meeting. The Committee voted against
the resolution calling for the establishment of a Political
Contributions Review Committee, and it abstained from
voting on the resolution which would bar from a seat on the
board of directors any individual who had authorized or
directed the expenditure of ITT's assets for political pur
poses
T he Commitee believes that the matters to which these
resolutions are addressed are of serious concern and that
continuing scrutiny by management is required in order to
avoid abuses of the kind disclosed in recent years. It con
cluded, however, that a review committee of the kind called
for in the resolution would not be an effective Instrument for
that purpose; assuring legal and ethical conduct by em
ployees or agents of a corporation is a responsibility of
management, and that duty will not be enhanced by the
establishment of a special committee
Our Committee has abstained from the resolution dealing
with membership on the board of directors because it
believed the resolution to be too blunt an instrument to be
useful. To be effective, either for punishment or deterrence,
restraints on conduct must be sensitive to degrees o* in
dividual culpability and to the circumstances In which
alleged unethical conduct was committed The resolution
allows of no such distinctions, but simply bars trom board
membership any individual involved to any degree in the
proscribed behavior. Were the conduct involved less
serious, the Committee would have voted against the
resolution. That it abstained should be taken by management
as a sign of the Committee's serious concern With the issue
and its hope that management will demonstrate its own
eoncern in strona and effective ways
