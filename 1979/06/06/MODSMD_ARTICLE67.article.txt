# Feminist explores love/duty sex roles
## 
### Kathy Andrews 
."The emergence of new paradigms in
sociobiology, especially those relating to
selfish and altruistic genes, has seemed to
call for recognition," said Pennsylvania
State sociology Prof. Emerita Jessie Ber
nard last Thursday.
Bernard's speech was the main feature
of the "Rethinking the Family: Some
Feminist Questions" lecture series spon
sored by the Center for Research on
Women this quarter.
A nationally renowned author, Bernard
explained-to an overflow audience at
Meyer Forum Room that sociobiologists
use a genetic paradigm to explain what she
called "the love and/or duty ethos of the
female world."
According to the paradigm, selfishness
and altruism are sex-linked characteristics.
"V" chromosomes transmit selfish traits
while "X" chromosomes impart altruistic
traits. Thus males uniformly tend to be
more aggressive than females. By corol
lary, females specialize for altruism.
Some sociobiologists explain this al
truism in terms of kinship relations, Ber
nard continued.
They assert that altruism motivates
mothers to make more sacrifices than
fathers for their more helpless offspring.
However, this behavior is somewhat self
ishly motivated. Since females contribute
more to fetal development in bisexual re
production, theyare more deeply commit
ted to protecting their "investment" in the
offspring's welfare than fathers are.
But Bernard challenged the altruistic
gene concept. "We know from the history
of infanticide and current exposes on
abused children that a considerable
number of female bodies do not carry
such genes. And a considerable number of
male bodies are carrying the caring gene,"
she said.
For Bernard, "The weight of the argu
ment seems to tall on the cultural side,"
instead of the genetic side.
Even sociobiologists concede that the
traits are culturally modifiable, she added.
Bernard also said she detected a masculine
bias in the sociobiological view.
"This is such a male style of thinking, in
terms of this investment bit," she noted.
Bernard also outlined and disputed the
sociobiological explanation of females' re
lationships with males outside the kinship
context.

According to Bernard, "There is some
sort of sociobiological imperative for
human males to feel superior to females.
Women must therefore sacrifice and hide
their own lights under a bushel basket."
Some sociobiologists use body lan
guage data to support their altruistic gene
concept, she said. By studying the lan
guage, gestures and smiles exchanged
during encounters between men and wo
men, they conclude that women act in a
subordinate, altruistic manner.
Bernard cited one such study that
showed women smile more often at men
than men do at women. In addition,
women seem to smile at men even in situa
tions that do not call for a smile.
The sociobiologists therefore postulate
that, "The smile is women's badge of ap
peasement, rather than a signal of plea
sure or friendship," Bernard explained.
Because the sociobiologists believe

women use smiles to grant superior status
to men, they consider it a mild form of
altruism, she added.
However, Bernard cited other evidence
that showed body language was more cul
turally than genetically determined.
"There are aspects of body movement
and vocal pitch that differ between the
sexes, but they are greatly overshadowed
by the learned aspects," she stated.
While allowing that human beings are
genetically programmed, Bernard said she
rejected the idea that all genetic prog
ramming is sex-linked.
"I've arrived somewhat circuitously at
the common argument: let's deal with in
dividuals one by one, on their own terms,"
she said. "Open the gate to women who
want to compete for the top prizes. Make
place for the men who want to serve
others instead of dominating all the
others. In brief, roll with the genetic
punch."

State sociology Prof. Emerita Jessie Ber
nard last Thursday.
Bernard's speech was the main feature
of the "Rethinking the Family: Some
Feminist Questions" lecture series spon
sored by the Center for Research on
Women this quarter.
A nationally renowned author, Bernard
explained-to an overflow audience at
Meyer Forum Room that sociobiologists
use a genetic paradigm to explain what she
called "the love and/or duty ethos of the
female world."
According to the paradigm, selfishness
and altruism are sex-linked characteristics.
"V" chromosomes transmit selfish traits
while "X" chromosomes impart altruistic
traits. Thus males uniformly tend to be
more aggressive than females. By corol
lary, females specialize for altruism.
Some sociobiologists explain this al
truism in terms of kinship relations, Ber
nard continued.
They assert that altruism motivates
mothers to make more sacrifices than
fathers for their more helpless offspring.
However, this behavior is somewhat self
ishly motivated. Since females contribute
more to fetal development in bisexual re
production, theyare more deeply commit
ted to protecting their "investment" in the
offspring's welfare than fathers are.
But Bernard challenged the altruistic
gene concept. "We know from the history
of infanticide and current exposes on
abused children that a considerable
number of female bodies do not carry
such genes. And a considerable number of
male bodies are carrying the caring gene,"
she said.
For Bernard, "The weight of the argu
ment seems to tall on the cultural side,"
instead of the genetic side.
Even sociobiologists concede that the
traits are culturally modifiable, she added.
Bernard also said she detected a masculine
bias in the sociobiological view.
"This is such a male style of thinking, in
terms of this investment bit," she noted.
Bernard also outlined and disputed the
sociobiological explanation of females' re
lationships with males outside the kinship
context.

According to Bernard, "There is some
sort of sociobiological imperative for
human males to feel superior to females.
Women must therefore sacrifice and hide
their own lights under a bushel basket."
Some sociobiologists use body lan
guage data to support their altruistic gene
concept, she said. By studying the lan
guage, gestures and smiles exchanged
during encounters between men and wo
men, they conclude that women act in a
subordinate, altruistic manner.
Bernard cited one such study that
showed women smile more often at men
than men do at women. In addition,
women seem to smile at men even in situa
tions that do not call for a smile.
The sociobiologists therefore postulate
that, "The smile is women's badge of ap
peasement, rather than a signal of plea
sure or friendship," Bernard explained.
Because the sociobiologists believe

women use smiles to grant superior status
to men, they consider it a mild form of
altruism, she added.
However, Bernard cited other evidence
that showed body language was more cul
turally than genetically determined.
"There are aspects of body movement
and vocal pitch that differ between the
sexes, but they are greatly overshadowed
by the learned aspects," she stated.
While allowing that human beings are
genetically programmed, Bernard said she
rejected the idea that all genetic prog
ramming is sex-linked.
"I've arrived somewhat circuitously at
the common argument: let's deal with in
dividuals one by one, on their own terms,"
she said. "Open the gate to women who
want to compete for the top prizes. Make
place for the men who want to serve
others instead of dominating all the
others. In brief, roll with the genetic
punch."
