# High-flying disk popular

The old adage is: "Build a better mousetrap,
and the world will be knocking at your door."
But here's a new one: "Build a better flying disk,
and the world will be getting high while they
toss it."
No joke. A company in Long Island, N.Y., is
now marketing a flying disk with a difference.
Altered Perception, a company comprised of 10
people, has added a screened chamber and a
mouthpiece to the center of their flying disk,
threatening to make the casual, mellow image of
the saucer player even more mellow and casual.
Dorian Dale, one of the 10 people at Altered
Perception, said he thought the concept of a
flying disk/pipe "seemed to be pretty logical. A
lot of disks are sold in this country."
Dale said information he had indicated that 75
percent of the people who purchased disks also
got high.
A lot of people seem to agree. According to
Dale, 60,000 of the Buzzbees — as they are called
— have been sold since the company started
less than a year ago.
Dale added that national disk champions John
Kirtland, Victor Malafronte and Laura Engel are
all satisfied customers, as are rock group Jeffer

son Starship members Paul Kantner and Craig
Chaquico.
Naturally, the police are getting into the act —
but not in the way one might expect. Dale re
ported that the local police there have asked for
donations of the Buzzbee and that one of the
members of Altered Perception is on the police
force.
Dale said the cultural focus on the sale of
smoking paraphernalia, which has aroused
heated debate in some cities, has had a paradox
ical effect on paraphernalia sellers like Altered
Perception. Television shows like Edwin New
man's NBC News Special on marijuana smoking,
which puts the sale of paraphernalia in a nega
tive light, "also gives us exposure," Dale said.
First reactions to the Buzzbee by disk players
here were favorable.
"It's fairly heavy," said one member of the
disk team here. "It's not affected by the wind
very much. It flies really well — better than a
comparably-sized disk without a pipe."
Another disk player said, "Despite its uncon
ventional aerodynamic design it flies very well.
Considering its dual function, what it lacks in
flying ability, it more than makes up in smoking
convenience."
