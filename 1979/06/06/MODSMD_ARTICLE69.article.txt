# Rape victim urges senate to stiffen assault penalties

### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” Sixteen-year-old
Mary Vincent, with artificial limbs to re
place the arms that were hacked off by a
rapist, urged the Legislature Monday to
increase sentences for rape.
"Rape convicts should get the punish
ment they deserve. They don't get the
punishment, and I don't think that's fair,"
Vincent said at a news conference after
flying here to testify.
"I don't think the rapist gets punished
enough," she added in testimony before
the committee. "I've got to live with hooks
on my arms the rest of my life. Why can't
he live the rest of his life in prison?"
The bill she supported, SBSOO by Sen.
Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), was approved
by the Senate Finance Committee on a 10-1
vote and sent to the Senate floor.
Robbins said one of its provisions might
have added 10 years to the sentence of
Lawrence Singleton, the man convicted of
raping Vincent.
The girl, who had left her parents' Las
Vegas, Nev., home, was picked up while
hitchhiking, raped, mutilated and

dumped in a ditch near Modesto last Sep
tember. Singleton, convicted of attemp
ted murder, rape, mayhem and several
other charges, was sentenced to 14 years,
4 months in prison, and could be paroled
earlier.
"It's an embarrassment that the laws
passed by the California Legislature would
not permit the judge to sentence the rapist
to more than 14 years, 4 months," Robbins
told reporters.
Vincent is back with her parents and said
she is going to school and learning to
bowl. She appeared ill at ease at the news
conference.
But her lawyer, Gloria Allred of Los Ang
les, who arranged the appearance, said
Vincent "is starting at an early age to un
derstand her responsibilities as a citizen."
Robbins' bill would make a number of
changes in rape law, but the one that
would have affected Vincent's case was
added only last week at the request of
Allred.
