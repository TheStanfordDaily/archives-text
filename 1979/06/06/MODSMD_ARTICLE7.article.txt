# Kayak very maneuverable

"You get to compete with
something that never really lets
you win — the whitewater."
The thrill of kayaking is the
main reason why Pam Miller,
a graduate student here who
covers whitewater events for
World Publishing Co., is
hooked.
"I started kayaking after I co
vered a kayak race as a college
newspaper reporter," she said.
"I saw the race and I was
hooked."
Smaller and more maneuv
erable than a canoe, the kayak
is completely enclosed except
for a small opening in the
center for the occupant. The
boat can be paddled or sailed.
The commercial kayak is de
rived from an Eskimo hunting
craft with a sealskin cover on a
light framework.
Dave Riffle, head of the
Loma Prieta Paddlers in Moun
tain View, converted from
canoeing to kayaking several
years ago. Riffle and Miller
both said they enjoyed getting
out in the woods and seeing
new areas of the country
through kayaking.
Miller said the vigorous
physical activity involved in
kayaking made her feel relaxed
and healthy. "Kayaking is just

as fun for women as men, but
sometimes women get them
selves psyched out before they
even try," she said.
Kayaking is particularly
popular in this part of the
country because of the abun
dance of good rivers in
California, according to
kayakist Bill Lomax. Rivers in
this area include the Stanis
laus, the south fork of the
American River and the Rus
sian River.
Kayaking does require some
instruction in technique and
safety precautions. Riffle said
he teaches an introductory
course through the Mountain

View Dept. of Parks and Recre
ation. The course culminates in
a river trip, he said. In addition
the Loma Prieta Paddlers, part
of the Sierra Club, organize
trips for beginners each
month.
For those interested in
kayaking, purchasing and rent
ing equipment is not a prob
lem. Lomax said Loma Prieta
rents equipment for trips that it
sponsors. There are also sev
eral stores in the area that sell
equipment.
Next time you feel cooped
up in the smog and heat of Palo
Alto, you may want to consider
kayaking in ice cold, river wa
ter.

Many former canoers have become hooked on kayaking. Smaller and
more maneuverable than a canoe, the kayak is derived from an
Eskimo hunting craft.
