Following is a March 14 letter to James D. Finley,
chairman ot the board and chief executive officer, J. P.
Stevens & Co. from William Eberle and William Massy of
Stanford.
We are writing to inform you that the Board of Trustees of
Stanford University, acting through its Trustee Select
Committee on Investment Responsibility, has decided to
abstain from voting on proposal 5, and to vote against
proposals 6 and 7 on this year's proxy ballot.
The Committee asked especially that its views on
proposal 5 be conveyed to management The Committee
strongly supports the purposes of proposal 5, namely, to
improve the company's record on labor relations matters
and to have the company develop, put into practice and
report on strong affirmative action efforts in the context of
effective personnel policies
It is the Committee's view that the J P Stevens Company
has been deficient in those areas, and it would have cast
Stanford's votes in support of the proposal but for the
requirement that the proposed review committee contain
non-Company members The Committee viewed that aspect
of the resolution as contrary to sound management prin
ciples and unnecessary to the achievement of the
resolution's purposes
In general, however, the Committee was impressed and
troubled by evidence that J P Stevens Company has failed
to live up to the standard of personnel policy and action that
universities, themselves, hold and that the preponderance of
business enterprises have long taken as normal and ex
pected The Committee would hope for tangible evidence of
improvement in the company's performance
You should know that it is our practice to make public
letters such as this, as well as responses to them from
company officers

Following is a March 23 letter to William D. Eberle
chairman of the Trustee Select Committee on In
vestment Responsibility, and William F. Massy vice
president for business and finance, from Margaret T.
Huh, secretary, J. P. Stevens & Co., Inc., Stevens Tower,
1185 Avenueof the Americas, New York, NY. 10036.
We appreciate your letter of March 14, 1979 in which you
took the time to explain the basis upon which you voted the
shares of Stevens stock held by Stanford University, and the
expression of your views concerning Proposal 5 in our 1979
Proxy Statement
As Mr Finley reported during last year's Annual Meeting,
the Stevens Board of Directors in September, 1977,
established an Ad Hoc Committee comprised of all outside
directors to review the Company's labor relations policies
and practices That Committee engaged in a detailed
examination and in February 1978 issued a report supportive
of the course of action pursued by the Company I am certain
that if the Board should in the future consider it appropriate
to engage in a similar review of labor relations matters, the

Ad Hoc Committee will be reactivated.
Subsequent to the August 1977 decision of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit finding the Company in
contempt, we established extensive compliance procedures
both to insure fulfillment of the Company's obligations under
that decision and to underscore our commitment to comply
fully with the labor laws. A supervisory educational and
training program is provided to alert our supervisors and
managers to their responsibility for labor law compliance.
These procedures were made applicable throughout the
Company, and were supported by concomitant disciplinary
and retraction policies with the intention of making our
compliance undertakings "fail safe." In conjunction with
such policies and procedures, we established a Compliance
Committee headed by the Director of Industrial Relations
and including among its members a Company attorney and
the senior manufacturing officer who is also a Company
Director The Compliance Committee continually supervises
and monitors the Company's compliance program The
results of this program have been gratifying and the reaction
of the NLRB favorable.
With respect to personnel policies and equal employment
opportunity, we have written personnel policies for both
salaried and hourly employees, and we are fully committed
to the precepts of equal employment opportunity. As a
contractor with the federal government, we have in place
written affirmative action programs, including programs to
hire veterans and the handicapped, covering all of our plant
and administrative locations and we seriously seek to meet
our affirmative action goals.
Our affirmative action performance was previously
audited by the Defense Supply Agency and is now audited by
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, and such audits
have consistently shown our progress to be satisfactory. We
shall continue to make every effort to reach our affirmative
action objectives.
In sum, the matters which you have referred to in your
March 14 letter are not vacuums within Stevens. On the
contrary, they are subjects which are in the forefront of our
priorities, which are receiving the continuing attention of all
levels of management, and with respect to which the Board
of Directors is kept periodically informed. To interject the
Board more directly in the implementation and ad
ministration of these policies and procedures by the
establishment of a permanent Board committee would make
the Board an operating arm of management. I believe I can
accurately state that the Stevens Board, in common with the
boards of most companies, perceives its functions as in
cluding the establishment of policy and the monitoring of
total corporate performance but not the involvement in
operational matters Furthermore, we do not believe that the
establishment of such a Review Committee would result in
any materi&J difference either in the effort which the
Company is making or in the results which it is achieving with
regard to the matters referred to. »
We are pleased that you gave us an opportunity to
respond to your concerns. If either of you or if any other
member of the Committee on Investment Responsibility
would like to discuss these matters in more detail, and if you
have occasion to be in New York, I will arrange a meeting
with the appropriate officers of the Company
