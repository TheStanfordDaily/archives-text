# Sidney Drell- physicist, teacher, humanitarian

### Robin Millington 
Sidney Drell, deputy direc
tor of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) and a
professor in the Arms Control
and Disarmament Program is a
soft-spoken dynamo in his var
ious fields of work.
Drell, who has been here
since 1956, was instrumental in
laying the groundwork for the
creation of SLAC in the early
19605.
"My primary activity is as a
theoretical physicist," Drell
said.
He said he became involved
in the issue of arms control
around 1960, "when it was
realized that scientists in gen
eral and physicists in part played
a significant role in World War
11. People felt the need that the
scientific community be part of
the national security of the
country."
"I was persuaded by this ar
gument," he said. "The most
pressing problem of this gen
eration is to control nuclear
weapons to prevent nuclear
war, and I can't emphasize that
enough."
Drell is an adviser on a
number of national commit
tees, including the National
Security Council and the Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency.
"He has been an adviser to
every president since
Eisenhower," said Coit
Blacker, research associate ot
the Arms Control and Disar
mament Program here. "He's
at the top of the field. There are
only two or three scientists in
the western world that are of
his caliber,"
Drell speaks in generalities
about his work and refers to his
personal feelings as what
"one" would feel.
"More often than not, he'll
tell you he's not an expert on a
subject and then go ahead and
tell you more about the subject
than most people in the field,"
said junior Kirk Radke, a stu
dent of Drell's.
Drell explained that he be
came involved with his advis
ory positions concerning arms
control because "one feels
there is an opportunity to make
an effort."
Drell is a man who has ac
complished many things in his
life but who has not placed
himself on a pedestal because
of his prestige.
"He doesn't draw some arti
ficial compartment and put his
students in it and put faculty
somewhere else above them,"
Blacker said. "I don't know
anyone who doesn't like Sid
ney Drell."
SLAC Prof. James Bjorken,
who has written two books
with Drell, said that Drell is
"very much a humanist, a
warm person who cares about
people."
Drell's compassion for

people has been demonstrated
in his efforts to aid his friends
Dr. Nohim Meiman and Andrei
Sakharov, considered dissi
dents in the Soviet Union.
"One of the really beautiful
moments of my life was a year
ago when Sakharov asked me
to be his substitute fora human
rights award in Washington.
I consider him a living saint."
Recently Drell organized a
petition that was signed by 118
members of the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences asking
the Soviet government to allow
Meiman to emigrate to Israel.
Drell explained that he has
special feelings for Meiman
because they published papers
simultaneously on the same
topic in theoretical physics in
1964-65.
Aside from his work in
physics and arms control, Drell
is also a teacher.
"He's one of the few people
that when he lectures, stu
dents can stop and ask ques
tions and he patiently answers
them without getting irri
tated," Blacker said about his i'
colleague.
During the Vietnam era,
Drell recalled that he was con
sidered "a war professor" be
cause of his work with the gov
ernment in the area of nuclear
arms. His main concern, how
ever, was, and is, to rid the
world of what he terms "the
balance of terror."
"I was thrown out of a clas
sroom at the University of
Rome, where I was on sabbati
cal in 1972 because I was an
adviser to the government. It
was a time when passions
where high and I was tainted by
association.
"The class insisted on sub
jecting me to an inquisition be
fore I could teach," he said.
They then took a vote on
whether or not Drell would be
allowed to teach. "I found that
unacceptable," he said.
Sidney Drell is a physicist, a
government adviser, a teacher,
and a humanitarian. He is a
man who has achieved tre
mendously in all of these pur
suits.
