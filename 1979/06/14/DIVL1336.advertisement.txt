FOOD I
FOR I
THOUGHT. I
We want you to think of the Transition
at Tresidder Union whenever you're
hungry. The Transition is a friendly, I
comfortable place to eat with your fel
low students, faculty, and staff.
Our food is prepared right here in our
own kitchen —using quality ingredients,
care and imagination.
You can come in for a wake up cup of
coffee, a breakfast omelet, hotcakes,
or fresh fruit bowl; get a hot full course
lunch or dinner, a bowl of thick home
made soup qi chili; share a whole pizza I
with friends or get a piece just for your
self; have a hot carved-meat sandwich,
a hot dog, or a burger and fries; even
get tacos, burritos and tostadas; and
then top it all off with a soft drink, shake,
soda, ice cream or frozen yogurt.
So whenever you're hungry, think of the
Transit on, we've thought of you.
The Transition at Tresidder Union:
homestyle food from 8 AM 'til 11 PM
Monday thru Friday (8 AM 'til 6 PM
Saturday—9 AM 'til 4 RM Sunday.) 0
