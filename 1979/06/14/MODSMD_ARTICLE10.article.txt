# Senior Class Presidents review year
## 
### 
This weekend marks the end
of our term as Senior Class
Presidents, but that occasion is
less significant than most
others during these last, packed
three days. The Class Plaque,
Baccalaureate Service, Class
Day Luncheon, SLAC tours
(what?), receptions, The Night
Before, and commencement it
self seem to cater to the whole
range of human experience.
Yet one really wonders
whether even such a large as
sortment of activities will be re
levant or meaningful to a class
whose feelings about this
weekend are so divsrse.
For some of us, commence
ment is the culmination of four
(or maybe even 20!) years of dil
liglent preparation: education
ally, socially, physically and
(gulp) perhaps even vocation
ally we are now "ready" for
something. This weekend is

our well deserved Grand
Finale.
For others of us, graduation
is merely an anti-climax: one of
life's ceremonial pauses that is
designed more for our parents
than for ourselves. They are the
proud and enthusiastic audi
ence — we the indifferent cast.
Undoubtedly, however, the
weekend will evoke all of
those feelings (and more) about
graduation.
An inspirational speech
might send you reminiscing
while the tug of an impatient
relative will quickly confront
you with certain logistical
drudgeries. Throughout the
weekend you will be pulled —
both literally and figuratively —
in many different directions.
Yet despite all of the emo
tional and physical confusion,
the four of us hope that you
won't lose sight of the fact that
graduation is something to
celebrate.
Whatever you may feel about
the University, your parents or
the ceremony — you know that
you h.ive accomplished some
thing here, you know that you
have made some sacrifices, and
you know that this weekend
represents a certain milestone
in your life. You deserve to bask
in it for a while.
We have a lot riding on your
feeling that way: we've
spent the last three months try
ing to make about half of this
weekend's activities happen.
The underlying motivation for

our efforts has been the feeling
that senior years and gradua
tion are special, and we hope
you'll join in the celebration
which this weekend attempts to
be.
The sheer numbers of people
will make an "institutional"
atmosphere unavoidable at
times, and we probably won't
be accused of being overly inti
mate.
But making these events
morp meaningful is vour job.

Go to them with the friends,
family and other relatives
whom you care about. Don't
feel you have to go to every
thing, but don't miss too much
either. If you have to rush
around, also pause to absorb
the beauty of the occasion.
Have a Happy Commence
ment Weekend.
