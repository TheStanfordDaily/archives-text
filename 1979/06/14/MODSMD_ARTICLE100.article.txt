# California's bountiful opportunities for rest and recreation
## 
### 
There will always be days
and weekends when you'll
want to get out from under the
shadow of Hoover Tower.
There will also be moments
when you will want to get away

but will only have the time or
means to go a few miles.
Whatever the case, you can
get away from it all at a count
less number of fun, beautiful
and interesting places in north
ern California. Some are just
down the street, while others
are across the state, but almost
all have such enjoyable features

that after a visit to one or more,
you will probably return think
ing that life at Stanford only be
gins on The Farm.
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-
minute bike ride away, lie the
Palo Alto Baylands, a favorite
stop-over for birds traveling on
the Pacific Flyway. These
birds, including egrets, willets,
ducks and more ducks, feed
closest to the shore at the ebb of
a very high tide. An interpre
tive center at the Baylands
(329-2506) schedules films and
lectures about Bay ecology, and
all visitors are welcome to take
their own tour over the marsh
lands on miles of inter
connecting wooden walkways.
The Stanford foothills behind
Lake Lagunita offer good views
of the Bay, a place to go on a
mini-hike and many lovely
spots for picnicking. A number
of stairways over the fence ad
jacent to Junipero Serra Blvd.
enable you to pick your own
trail.
Foothills Park, up Page Mill
Road, is only open to Palo Alto
residents, but if you can find a
phone bill or something else
bearing a Palo Alto address,
you can get in to enjoy the open
spaces. Dusk is the time to
watch the small groups of deer
that feed on the watered green
grass.
Rock climbers meet at Castle
Rock State Park on Skyline
Boulevard for bouldering, and
botanists, bird watchers, and
hikers enjoy its wandering
trails.
Huddart Park, located on
Kings Mtn. Road in Woodside,
is only 30 minutes away from
campus by car. Drivers and
bicyclists who want to take a
scenic route to the park rhould
drive out Sand Hill Road to Por
tola Road, turn right and then

continue on Old Country Road
to Woodside Road. Turn right
there, and then left on Kings
Mountain. The park offers na
ture trails, volleyball courts,
picnic areas and other recrea
tional facilities.
In California, of course, one
naturally thinks of beaches, but
in this area, they are mainly for
surfing and sunning; even the
best of swimmers should be
wary of the cold waters and
strong undertow.
Before you head for the
ocean, check the weather re
port. The beaches are often
foggy, even when Stanford is
roasting. In mid-winter, how
ever, you can often enjoy a
sunny day on an uncrowded
stretch of sand.
Highway 1 between Half
Moon Bav and Santa Cruz is
dotted with spectacular, cliff

bordered beaches; some of the
favorites include San Gregorio
and Pomponio. For those who
prefer to sun without a suit,
there's the public beach at
Bonny Dune, 10 miles north of
Santa Cruz, and the private
beach one mile north of the
state beach at San Gregorio.
In the winter, you can also
usually see magnificent
elephant seals at Ano Nuevo
beach, to which they migrate
during the mating season. And
it you simply must go ocean
swimming, the beaches in the
Santa Cruz area and south are
relatively safe — but still cold.
Among the most popular of
these are those near the seaside
communities of Aptos (Seaside
Beach has a cement ship) and
Capitola.
In Santa Cruz you can com
plement a visit to the beach
with an afternoon or evening at
the Boardwalk, a colorful
Coney Island-style amusement
park that has an old wooden
rollercoaster, arcades and
other attractions.
For day trips or longer, Big
Basin, home of fine stands of
California Redwoods and
wildlife, is just an hour and a
half away by car, or four to five
hours by bike. Head up Page
Mill Road to Skyline Boulevard,
then turn left, keeping your

eyes open for signs to Big Basin
and breathtaking views of
mountains and the sea. It's a
right turn on Highway 9 and
then down Highway 236 to the
park headquarters. From there,
hundreds of miles of trails can
lead you to mountain peaks or
down to the ocean.
Or, take two hours by car to
drive down to Point Lobos Pre
serve, a beautiful seascape area
complete with sea otters, ocean
sprav and hiking trails. Point
Lobos is approximately seven
miles past Carmel, itself a
charming place to visit if you
like to shop.
Also nearby is the beautiful
Del Monte Forest, home of
some of the world's finest golf
courses (Pebble Beach, Spyg
lass Hill and Cypress Point) and
the magnificent 17 Mile Drive.
Along the drive you will see
California seascape at its finest:
gnarled Monterey pines, rug
ged shoreline and a pounding
surf. It costs a few dollars to
enter the forest and to take the
drive, but it definitely is
worthwhile.
If, after viewing the coastline
at Carmel, you wish to see
more, drive south about 20
miles to the Big Surarea, where
the Pacific crashes into dramatic
towering cliffs. Be sure to bring
your cdmera.

Monterey, just north of Car
mel, has a wharf area that
houses many fine seafood re
staurants and that brings back
memories of John Steinbeck's
Cannery Ron*.
Springtime is the best time to
see five of the world's 10 high
est waterfalls, in Vosemite Na
tional Park, but autumn in the
park has its virtues, too; Yose
mite then is crisp, cool and
beautiful, and the summer
crowds are gone. Yosemite is
about four hours from Palo
Alto. The best view of the mag
nificent valley is seen from the
Pohono Trail, ari easy-walking,
uncrowded trail which runs
along the southern rim.
It is best to tour the valley by
foot or bicycle; by traveling at a
placid rate, you can take in the
full splendor of the falls and
glacier-carved mountains.
Lake Tahoe is an easy four
hour drive from Stanford, and
its glorious vistas are unques
tionably worth the time and ex
pense. In the early fall and late
spring, you can catch rays
under a warm alpine sun, and
in the winter, you can enjoy
cross-country skiing, ice skat
ing and some of the world's
finest downhill ski resorts.

Beach has a cement ship) and
Capitola.
In Santa Cruz you can com
plement a visit to the beach
with an afternoon or evening at
the Boardwalk, a colorful
Coney Island-style amusement
park that has an old wooden
rollercoaster, arcades and
other attractions.
For day trips or longer, Big
Basin, home of fine stands of
California Redwoods and
wildlife, is just an hour and a
half away by car, or four to five
hours by bike. Head up Page
Mill Road to Skyline Boulevard,
then turn left, keeping your

eyes open for signs to Big Basin
and breathtaking views of
mountains and the sea. It's a
right turn on Highway 9 and
then down Highway 236 to the
park headquarters. From there,
hundreds of miles of trails can
lead you to mountain peaks or
down to the ocean.
Or, take two hours by car to
drive down to Point Lobos Pre
serve, a beautiful seascape area
complete with sea otters, ocean
sprav and hiking trails. Point
Lobos is approximately seven
miles past Carmel, itself a
charming place to visit if you
like to shop.
Also nearby is the beautiful
Del Monte Forest, home of
some of the world's finest golf
courses (Pebble Beach, Spyg
lass Hill and Cypress Point) and
the magnificent 17 Mile Drive.
Along the drive you will see
California seascape at its finest:
gnarled Monterey pines, rug
ged shoreline and a pounding
surf. It costs a few dollars to
enter the forest and to take the
drive, but it definitely is
worthwhile.
If, after viewing the coastline
at Carmel, you wish to see
more, drive south about 20
miles to the Big Surarea, where
the Pacific crashes into dramatic
towering cliffs. Be sure to bring
your cdmera.

Monterey, just north of Car
mel, has a wharf area that
houses many fine seafood re
staurants and that brings back
memories of John Steinbeck's
Cannery Ron*.
Springtime is the best time to
see five of the world's 10 high
est waterfalls, in Vosemite Na
tional Park, but autumn in the
park has its virtues, too; Yose
mite then is crisp, cool and
beautiful, and the summer
crowds are gone. Yosemite is
about four hours from Palo
Alto. The best view of the mag
nificent valley is seen from the
Pohono Trail, ari easy-walking,
uncrowded trail which runs
along the southern rim.
It is best to tour the valley by
foot or bicycle; by traveling at a
placid rate, you can take in the
full splendor of the falls and
glacier-carved mountains.
Lake Tahoe is an easy four
hour drive from Stanford, and
its glorious vistas are unques
tionably worth the time and ex
pense. In the early fall and late
spring, you can catch rays
under a warm alpine sun, and
in the winter, you can enjoy
cross-country skiing, ice skat
ing and some of the world's
finest downhill ski resorts.

There will always be days
and weekends when you'll
want to get out from under the
shadow of Hoover Tower.
There will also be moments
when you will want to get away

but will only have the time or
means to go a few miles.
Whatever the case, you can
get away from it all at a count
less number of fun, beautiful
and interesting places in north
ern California. Some are just
down the street, while others
are across the state, but almost
all have such enjoyable features

that after a visit to one or more,
you will probably return think
ing that life at Stanford only be
gins on The Farm.
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-
minute bike ride away, lie the
Palo Alto Baylands, a favorite
stop-over for birds traveling on
the Pacific Flyway. These
birds, including egrets, willets,
ducks and more ducks, feed
closest to the shore at the ebb of
a very high tide. An interpre
tive center at the Baylands
(329-2506) schedules films and
lectures about Bay ecology, and
all visitors are welcome to take
their own tour over the marsh
lands on miles of inter
connecting wooden walkways.
The Stanford foothills behind
Lake Lagunita offer good views
of the Bay, a place to go on a
mini-hike and many lovely
spots for picnicking. A number
of stairways over the fence ad
jacent to Junipero Serra Blvd.
enable you to pick your own
trail.
Foothills Park, up Page Mill
Road, is only open to Palo Alto
residents, but if you can find a
phone bill or something else
bearing a Palo Alto address,
you can get in to enjoy the open
spaces. Dusk is the time to
watch the small groups of deer
that feed on the watered green
grass.
Rock climbers meet at Castle
Rock State Park on Skyline
Boulevard for bouldering, and
botanists, bird watchers, and
hikers enjoy its wandering
trails.
Huddart Park, located on
Kings Mtn. Road in Woodside,
is only 30 minutes away from
campus by car. Drivers and
bicyclists who want to take a
scenic route to the park rhould
drive out Sand Hill Road to Por
tola Road, turn right and then

continue on Old Country Road
to Woodside Road. Turn right
there, and then left on Kings
Mountain. The park offers na
ture trails, volleyball courts,
picnic areas and other recrea
tional facilities.
In California, of course, one
naturally thinks of beaches, but
in this area, they are mainly for
surfing and sunning; even the
best of swimmers should be
wary of the cold waters and
strong undertow.
Before you head for the
ocean, check the weather re
port. The beaches are often
foggy, even when Stanford is
roasting. In mid-winter, how
ever, you can often enjoy a
sunny day on an uncrowded
stretch of sand.
Highway 1 between Half
Moon Bav and Santa Cruz is
dotted with spectacular, cliff

bordered beaches; some of the
favorites include San Gregorio
and Pomponio. For those who
prefer to sun without a suit,
there's the public beach at
Bonny Dune, 10 miles north of
Santa Cruz, and the private
beach one mile north of the
state beach at San Gregorio.
In the winter, you can also
usually see magnificent
elephant seals at Ano Nuevo
beach, to which they migrate
during the mating season. And
it you simply must go ocean
swimming, the beaches in the
Santa Cruz area and south are
relatively safe — but still cold.
Among the most popular of
these are those near the seaside
communities of Aptos (Seaside

Capitola.
