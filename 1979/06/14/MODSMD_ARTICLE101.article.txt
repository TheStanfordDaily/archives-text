# Explore different worlds in The City
## 
### 
Just about no one leaves
Stanford without having spent
at least one night on the town in
San Francisco. But some stu
dents, perhaps, see The City by
simply rushing about to all the
sights, riding the cable cars and
checking out the North Beach
scene. They leave town with no
greater impression than if they
had toured downtown Omaha.
With all of its geological, cul
tural, and sociological diver
sity, however, San Francisco
has very unique and positive
aspects for the visitor who takes
the time to seek them out.
It seems that of the many
who come to The City, those
who wander quietly through its
neighborhoods, down its side
streets, into its parks and along
its waterfront sense that there
is something quite special about
it. Indeed, San Francisco is a
city of neighborhoods. In each
of the dozens of residential dis
tricts, one can find commercial
blocks that cater to the particu
lar and peculiar needs of those
who live there.
Explore them one by one: the
Mission, an area ignored on of
ficial tourist maps, is the home
of the Hispanic ethnic groups.
North Beach, situated between
Columbus Avenue and Tele
graph Hill, has Italian coffee
houses, bakeries and trattorie,
and Washington Square Park,

where the local residents like to
take the sun.
Around Castro Street below
Market, the shops and restaur
ants cater mostly to the local
gay community, making it one
of San Francisco's most impor
tant cultural and political cen
ters.
There are other great streets
for walkers. A stroll past the
shops on Clement Street will
lead you to the Palace of the
Legion of Honor, a museum
which commands a sweeping
view of the Golden Gate
Bridge. A walk down Union
Street west of Van Ness will
take you past antique shops,
boutiques and singles bars; a
walk down Polk Street between
Broadway and Sutter will take
you past antique shops,
boutiques and gay bars.
Stopping in the art galleries
in the downtown area of Grant,
Post and Sutter can also be a
pleasant way to spend a quiet
afternoon in The City.
You won't want to stop
exploring until you've planted
your feet in Pacific Heights, the
Marina, Chinatown, the
Japanese Center, the Haight
and manv other areas. In each
district you visit you'll discover
a favorite restaurant, a special
place to sit and have coffee and
some unexpected sights that
you'll want to revisit. That's

what getting to know San Fran
cisco is about.
And of course, don't forget
Golden Gate Park, a day's ex
cursion in itself. Besides woods
and frisbee fields and bike
paths that stretch to the sea,
you can find the Japanese Tea
Garden, the M.H. DeYoung
Museum (558-2887) and the
California Academy of Sci
ences, with its aquarium (752-
8268), terrarium and
planetarium (752-8268).
The Exploratorium (563-
7337) in the Palace of Fine Arts
is a free "touchy-feely" science
museum, a particularly enjoy
able spot to visit. While you're
there, you might ask museum
officers about making reserva

tions for the Tactile Gallery,
another fun way to spend part
of a day in San Francisco.
You won't have any trouble
finding the standard tourist
favorites, such as the cable cars.
Many can be crowded on
weekends, but plan nonethe
less to ride one of the Powell or
California Street cable cars
some warm, starry evening. Do
not miss walking across the
Golden Gate Bridge either,
even if it's shrouded in a brac
ing fog.
At the top of Telegraph Hill,
Coit Tower offers one of the in
numerable vistas of The City
and the Bay. You can get there
by following Lombard Street up
the hill.

dents, perhaps, see The City by
simply rushing about to all the
sights, riding the cable cars and
checking out the North Beach
scene. They leave town with no
greater impression than if they
had toured downtown Omaha.
With all of its geological, cul
tural, and sociological diver
sity, however, San Francisco
has very unique and positive
aspects for the visitor who takes
the time to seek them out.
It seems that of the many
who come to The City, those
who wander quietly through its
neighborhoods, down its side
streets, into its parks and along
its waterfront sense that there
is something quite special about
it. Indeed, San Francisco is a
city of neighborhoods. In each
of the dozens of residential dis
tricts, one can find commercial
blocks that cater to the particu
lar and peculiar needs of those
who live there.
Explore them one by one: the
Mission, an area ignored on of
ficial tourist maps, is the home
of the Hispanic ethnic groups.
North Beach, situated between
Columbus Avenue and Tele
graph Hill, has Italian coffee
houses, bakeries and trattorie,
and Washington Square Park,

where the local residents like to
take the sun.
Around Castro Street below
Market, the shops and restaur
ants cater mostly to the local
gay community, making it one
of San Francisco's most impor
tant cultural and political cen
ters.
There are other great streets
for walkers. A stroll past the
shops on Clement Street will
lead you to the Palace of the
Legion of Honor, a museum
which commands a sweeping
view of the Golden Gate
Bridge. A walk down Union
Street west of Van Ness will
take you past antique shops,
boutiques and singles bars; a
walk down Polk Street between
Broadway and Sutter will take
you past antique shops,
boutiques and gay bars.
Stopping in the art galleries
in the downtown area of Grant,
Post and Sutter can also be a
pleasant way to spend a quiet
afternoon in The City.
You won't want to stop
exploring until you've planted
your feet in Pacific Heights, the
Marina, Chinatown, the
Japanese Center, the Haight
and manv other areas. In each
district you visit you'll discover
a favorite restaurant, a special
place to sit and have coffee and
some unexpected sights that
you'll want to revisit. That's

what getting to know San Fran
cisco is about.
And of course, don't forget
Golden Gate Park, a day's ex
cursion in itself. Besides woods
and frisbee fields and bike
paths that stretch to the sea,
you can find the Japanese Tea
Garden, the M.H. DeYoung
Museum (558-2887) and the
California Academy of Sci
ences, with its aquarium (752-
8268), terrarium and
planetarium (752-8268).
The Exploratorium (563-
7337) in the Palace of Fine Arts
is a free "touchy-feely" science
museum, a particularly enjoy
able spot to visit. While you're
there, you might ask museum
officers about making reserva

tions for the Tactile Gallery,
another fun way to spend part
of a day in San Francisco.
You won't have any trouble
finding the standard tourist
favorites, such as the cable cars.
Many can be crowded on
weekends, but plan nonethe
less to ride one of the Powell or
California Street cable cars
some warm, starry evening. Do
not miss walking across the
Golden Gate Bridge either,
even if it's shrouded in a brac
ing fog.
At the top of Telegraph Hill,
Coit Tower offers one of the in
numerable vistas of The City
and the Bay. You can get there
by following Lombard Street up
the hill.
