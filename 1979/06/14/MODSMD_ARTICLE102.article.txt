# San Francisco's performing groups show added luster
## 
### 
The California Reflex, that
quick glance over the shoulder
to see what the East Coast is up
to, is on the decline among the
producers of San Francisco's
performing arts.
In the past, the word "pro
vincial" on the lips of visiting
New Yorkers or Bostonians was
enough to start heads turning
toward the traditional centers
of culture. Now, however, The
City's music and drama com
munity is on the verge of trans
forming the Bay Area into one
of the world's capitals of the
performing arts.
The Symphony, the Ballet
and the Opera'have all been in
San Francisco for more than
four decades. During this time,
none of them has been com
pletely devoid of brilliance, but
neither have they consistently
inspired ecstatic reviews. The
problem took the form of a vici
ous circle of belief creating fact
creating belief; top calibre ar
tists would not risk theircareers
by venturing out into what they
considered a cultural trough,
and thus they assured that the
area would remain in the
depths of philistinism.
Symphony
The Symphony was founded
in 1911 by members of the small
but influential community of
classical music patrons which
has existed here almost since
The Citv's birth.
In the succeeding 50 years,
the orchestra went through a
number of artistic ups and
downs, but Josef Krips, ap
pointed music director in 1963,
started the Symphony on the
road to permanent improve
ment. Seiji O/awa took the
reins in 1970 and held them
until two seasons ago.

Waart, formerly a principle
guest conductor, begins his

Ballet
The Ballet has the distinction
ol being the oldest classical bal
let company in the United
States. Founded in 1933, the
company has suffered — and
still suffers, in the opinion of

many — when compared with
the American Ballet Company
of New York.
The Ballet is directed by Lew
Christensen and Michael
Smuin.
Opera
The Opera was founded in
1923. The company has been in
the forefront of American opera
consistently, having staged 18
U.S. premieres, as well as two
world premieres, and having
provided the American opera
debut of Renata Tebaldi and Sir
Georg Solti. General Director
Kurt Herbert Adler has been
the major force in opera in the
western United States for many
years and has played an impor
tant role in forming offshoots of
the Opera, such as the Western
Opera Theater and the Brown
Bag Opera.
Theater
The most dramatic recent
improvement in San Francis
co's performing arts has taken
place in the realm of theatre.

Writing in San Francisco Theatre,
Berkeley Repertory Theatre As
sociate Director Douglas
Johnson said that "20 years ago,
when I was about to leave high
school to pursue a career in
theatre, the Bay Area was a
wasteland, theatrically speak
ing."
Since then, however, there
has been "a veritable boom of
theatrical activity — one
whose quality and quantity ri
vals most of the major met
ropolitan centers in the coun
try."
Leading the way in dramatic
activity is the American Con
servatory Theatre (ACT), which
is perhaps The City's strongest
candidate for a superlative rat

ing, when compared with simi
lar companies across the coun
try. William Ball, the troupe's
founder, conceived of ACT
while he was in England study
ing repertory theatre. Disen
chanted on his return with
what he calls "those cold, icy
New York performances," he
started the company 13 years
ago in Pittsburgh. In 1966 the
troupe set out looking for a new
home, and, after brief stops in
Westport, Chicago, Phoenix
and the Stanford Summer Fes
tival, it came to rest in the Geary
Theater.
It took four seasons for the
company to become firmly es
tablished (i.e. fiscally sound),
but now that it is solvent, the
company continues to improve,

refine and innovate. It is now
the largest company of its kind
in the country, with roughly 10
plays in repertory at any one
time and an annual budget of $4
million.
Civic Light Opera
The Civic Light Opera, now
in its 41st year, brings four
Broadway musicals to The City
each year. Founded by Homer
Curran, for whom the Curran
Theatre is named, and Edward
Lester, the Light Opera has
been a consistently successful
enterprise.
About 80 other theatre
troupes make their home in the
Bay Area. These range from the
New City Theatre, presenting
works of social and political vis
ion from the working class

point of view, to the Chamber
Theatre Group, presenting an
integration of music and choir
in performances of Sacred
Theatre, to the Alameda Little
Theatre to the improvisational
Action Theatre.
Some of the better known
companies of the Bay Area in
clude the Berkeley Mime
Troupe, the Berkeley Repertory
Company, California Actors
Theatre, and the San Francisco
Mime Troupe. In addition, a
number of companies are
oriented toward specific racial
or cultural groups. Included in
this category are the Asian
American Theatre Workshop,
the Black Repertory Group,
Teatro Latino and the Women's
Ensemble.

Symphony
The Symphony was founded
in 1911 by members of the small
but influential community of
classical music patrons which
has existed here almost since
The Citv's birth.
In the succeeding 50 years,
the orchestra went through a
number of artistic ups and
downs, but Josef Krips, ap
pointed music director in 1963,
started the Symphony on the
road to permanent improve
ment. Seiji O/awa took the
reins in 1970 and held them
until two seasons ago.

Ballet
The Ballet has the distinction
ol being the oldest classical bal
let company in the United
States. Founded in 1933, the
company has suffered — and
still suffers, in the opinion of

many — when compared with
the American Ballet Company
of New York.
The Ballet is directed by Lew
Christensen and Michael
Smuin.
Opera
The Opera was founded in
1923. The company has been in
the forefront of American opera
consistently, having staged 18
U.S. premieres, as well as two
world premieres, and having
provided the American opera
debut of Renata Tebaldi and Sir
Georg Solti. General Director
Kurt Herbert Adler has been
the major force in opera in the
western United States for many
years and has played an impor
tant role in forming offshoots of
the Opera, such as the Western
Opera Theater and the Brown
Bag Opera.
Theater
The most dramatic recent
improvement in San Francis
co's performing arts has taken
place in the realm of theatre.

Writing in San Francisco Theatre,
Berkeley Repertory Theatre As
sociate Director Douglas
Johnson said that "20 years ago,
when I was about to leave high
school to pursue a career in
theatre, the Bay Area was a
wasteland, theatrically speak
ing."
Since then, however, there
has been "a veritable boom of
theatrical activity — one
whose quality and quantity ri
vals most of the major met
ropolitan centers in the coun
try."
Leading the way in dramatic
activity is the American Con
servatory Theatre (ACT), which
is perhaps The City's strongest
candidate for a superlative rat

ing, when compared with simi
lar companies across the coun
try. William Ball, the troupe's
founder, conceived of ACT
while he was in England study
ing repertory theatre. Disen
chanted on his return with
what he calls "those cold, icy
New York performances," he
started the company 13 years
ago in Pittsburgh. In 1966 the
troupe set out looking for a new
home, and, after brief stops in
Westport, Chicago, Phoenix
and the Stanford Summer Fes
tival, it came to rest in the Geary
Theater.
It took four seasons for the
company to become firmly es
tablished (i.e. fiscally sound),
but now that it is solvent, the
company continues to improve,

refine and innovate. It is now
the largest company of its kind
in the country, with roughly 10
plays in repertory at any one
time and an annual budget of $4
million.
Civic Light Opera
The Civic Light Opera, now
in its 41st year, brings four
Broadway musicals to The City
each year. Founded by Homer
Curran, for whom the Curran
Theatre is named, and Edward
Lester, the Light Opera has
been a consistently successful
enterprise.
About 80 other theatre
troupes make their home in the
Bay Area. These range from the
New City Theatre, presenting
works of social and political vis
ion from the working class

point of view, to the Chamber
Theatre Group, presenting an
integration of music and choir
in performances of Sacred
Theatre, to the Alameda Little
Theatre to the improvisational
Action Theatre.
Some of the better known
