# Fabled films brighten nearby theaters
## 
### 
The fare ranges from vintage
'30s sophisticated comedies to
soon-to-be-classics of the '80s.
The films run in double bills,
and for a little less than vou'd
have to pay to see one film in a
first-run house.
The facilities which feature
these fine movies are the New
Varsity and the Festival Cinema
in downtown Palo Alto.
Both theatres offer an alterna
tive to regular movie-house
programming. By attending the
tlicks at these theatres, one can
refine his or her movie tastes
with a classic—be it one featur
ing Bogart or Nicholson,
Lubitsch or Hitchcock, or the
work of film artists from over
seas.
It is not unusual to find capac
ity crowds at both theatres, and
the reason is simple: they offer
bills that are entertaining-—and
often challenging — and that
meet the discerning tastes ot an
educated audience.
To those who have not yet
refined their movie tastes

(especially it the theatre back
home has just finished a nine
month engagement of Orca the
Killer Whale), a selection of films
such as Casablanca, Harold ami
Maude, and The Philadelphia
Story provides the best oppor
tunity to become a cinephile.
During the great cinema
years of the '30s and '4l)s (
movie-goers went to grand,
ornate theatres in which foot
ball field-sized curtains swung
back to reveal the silver screen.
Though the trend now is to split
these halls into three or more
"movie closets," the New Var
sity has maintained a theatre
built in the '30s and with seat
ing for 700 in the style of the old
movie palaces.
Since its rebirth as a repertory
theatre in May 1474, the Varsity
has expanded its range of films
from the old favorites—such as
The Maltese Falcon and The
Wizard of Oz —and recent
classics—such as Annie Hall and
Dr. Straiitfelovi to include new
art movies, such as Chushing

lira, Renaldo ami Clara and The
Serpent's Egg.
In addition, the Varsity
draws the late-night crowds on
Fridays and Saturdays with
midnight shows of recent rock
films and super-cult hits, such
as Yessongs, The Song Remain*
the Same and The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.
Those enjoying the cinematic
fare and who desire more than
popcorn and soda to abate their
appetites can enjoy the
theatre's restaurant and bar.
The menu includes veal picatta
and a wide assortment of cre
pes, with prices in the $5 to $10
range.
Explorers of downtown Palo
Alto can also discover the Festi
val Cinema, 475 Hamilton
Ave., within a block of the New
Varsity, 456 University Ave.
(the theatres back up to the
same parking lot).
Formerly a theatre specializ
ing in lesser-known musicals,
the Festival has been running
week-long engagements of vin

tage films since June 1973.
Among the most popular
bills are double Hitchcock fea
tures, sophisticated comedies
of the '30s and En
glish films of the '50s
The terrific part about attend
ing these films is that you can
often find the accompanying
feature (which vou probably
never had heard of) as enjoy
able as the old standard you
went to see.
The college-town community
of Palo Alto provides the per
fect atmosphere for these
theatres. Schedules ot the films
slated for the next two or
three months are printed and
distributed by both houses, and
they are available at the
theatres and on campus.
So, put down your books,
discover the true meaning of
cinema, get out, have fun, eat
some popcorn. If you go
through four years of college
without visiting these fine es
tablishments, you'll regret it.
