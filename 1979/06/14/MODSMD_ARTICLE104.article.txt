# Something else that's special about SF – its nightclubs

Newark has discos. Cleve
land has discos. Even Marriott's
Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Peter
Frampton. Los Angeles has a
stadium capable of accomodat
ing Peter Frampton. Los
Angeles has two stadiums cap
able of accomodating Peter
Frampton if you count
Anaheim (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied qual
ity. Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
enough — even the most
branch office of all branch office
metropoli go to pains to see that
this is true. Quality of perfor
mance aside, it just goes to
show that it was a mistake to
leave lowa in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't get
what you want, but you get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except night
clubs, that is. San Francisco's
nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Kil
ler, distinguish this city from
every inhabited community
outside the New York State
lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance,
which holds somewhere near
eight times as many human be
ings. No one knows why this is
so of course, except for the oc
casional smartass who argues
that San Franciscans are a race
of supremely intelligent hippie
freaks.
There are, again, many
species in the nightclub genus.
The City has, for example,
sleazy dives where you can
simulate living in Detroit, and
more than its share of estab
lishments catering to the Carol
Doda crowd. And if you went
to Exeter, no need to worry,
there are exclusive places,
where obloquy and scorn await
a fool without a tie.
And between these
extremes — hold your
breath — The City has up
wards of a billion zillion "mis
cellaneous" nighclubs, ranging
all the way from the red
velvet-and-Frank Gorshen
posh of the Fairmont Hotel to
the jump-up-and-down

paralyzed-for-life what-kind
of-funny-pills did-you-say
they-were oh-my-god
they're-turning-into-reptiles
contentment of Mabuhay Gar
dens. San Francisco, in short,
has many, many establish
ments designed to provide you
with entertainment and/or
dancing and/or grounds of im
bition at night.
Of course it is very hard to
find one's way around when
one doesn't know where to go.
It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't in
clude a guide to the good ones.
On that note we begin to
draw the noose . . .
Did 1 happen to hear some
one out there ask for nighclub
advice? You in the back with the
calculator? Very good. There
are several such establishments
between here and Marin that
could do with special mention.
The Great American Music
Hall, the Old Waldorf, the
Keystone Berkeley, the Keys
tone Palo Alto, Keystone
Korner and Christo's come in
stantly to mind, which leaves
out a few, but we'll probably get
to them in just an instant or
two. (Most obviously the list
above doesn't include The
Boarding House, which re
ceives special mention in parag
raphs to your upper right). Oh
yes, and there's the Bistro, and
the Palms, and ....
Excuse me, do 1 see another
hand? You in the warm-up
suit? Yes, 1 do suppose it's true
that a laundry list won't help
much, owing to considerable
diversity as to what in reality
constitutes a truly mythic ex
perience beyond anyone's wil
dest dreams. 1 see your point.
Some people do value dancing
space more than they value per
fect acoustics, and that does
make it difficult to give worth
while advice. Almost impossi
ble, in fact.
But wait. Most people here
have not even been to a
nighclub, and for that reason it
would do you good if 1 listed
what you should look for. What
follows are the rules by which
one should judge a nightclub
(examples included).
Ahem.
Rule number one of Night

club Choosery specifically pro
hibits parties of the first part
from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quo
tient stars generally end up in
stadiums, with high boredom
quotient warm-up acts. Night
clubs depend on medium-small
entertainers. "Medium-small"
generally has to do only with
album sales, however, as does
"high fame quotient;" the point
is that you ought not to wait all
year for your favorite group.
They'll sell out anyway, if they
play in a nightclub, so what a
true clubber ought to do is ex
periment with his ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
tough for most college stu
dents. It requires that you
admit the existence of a flaw.
Yet it is important, and we
should shed our misconcep
tions eventually. So remember
this: despite the popularity of
component stereo systems with
multi-colored dials and
switches, most of humanity is
unable to tell a good sound sys
tem from a dixie cup on a string.
It follows from that, that
though sound systems vary in
nightclubs, this doesn't matter
to most people.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
The Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their
shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever
hear anyone complain about it?
At the Old Waldorf — a favo
rite haunt of Peter Tosh/Patti
Smith/Warren Zevon types —
it is surprising how badly the
music is mixed ("mixing" is re
lated to amplification which has
to do with electricity. OK?).
And Great America's beautiful
gold-leaf interior can some
times send a trumpet solo into
an ear in a disconcerting man
ner. But both places simply
don't need perfect acoustics, be
cause there are very few perfect
ears; those so blessed can find
what they need at nearly every
jazz club. (Keystone Korner, for
example. That's a jazz place,
and jazz places are frequented
by people who demand near
perfect acoustics —they have it
because they need it, but other
places don't).
So that's rule two, to be noted

especially by rock fans: it
doesn't make much difference
if the weak middle range of a
system is matched by a blown
out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd
you like. There's a world of dif
ference between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and
the rest of mankind as we know
it, for example. You gots to
know which ilk you like or else
it could ruin an evening.
And Mabuhay is a perfect
example. There is music, to be
sure — though neo-fascists
prefer to call it "sick punk rock
crap" — but someitmes it
seems as if the music is less of
an attraction than the seething
masses themselves. They have
a distinctive crowd, to say the
least, and bridge players would
be uncomfortable. The music
does attain near-mythic stature
with a greater than average fre
quency, but if you're looking
for an evening tree of flying
ashtrays this simply isn't your
place. GAMH is calm, theKeys
tones are relatively Bohemian,
and the Waldorf is rowdy-but
controlled, and surprisingly
even cross-over crowds are af
fected bv these reputations. It
doesn't mean that Herb Albert

could play Mabuhay and bring
the world to an end, or that
Johnny Rotten wouldn't notice
that things were quieter in the
Venetian Room, but certain
clubs do have certain types of
crowds, and they tend to be dis
tinctive.
Rule, three has to do with tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in drink
and food prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would be sore afraid if
they had to sleep in an alley.
And the multitudes adhered to
the commandments of the gol
den calf of tuition, and called in
advance to find out the drink
minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got
The Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and you like it,
go back. Frequent the places
that treat you like you want to
be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID
check and a jerk who laughs
and says you don't look 13 can
be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space

might also turn things around.
Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmos
phere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition
of "pleasant ..."
David Allen runs the Board
ing House, the finest club in
San Francisco. There are other
clubs and other owners who
damn-near hold their own with
Allen, but for now, he holds the
market on the near-perfect
building-run-by-a patriarch
of-the-stars market. After all,
either the man or his edifice has
helped launch the careers of
Kenny Rankin, Lilly Tomlin,
Richard Pryor, Robert Klein
and Steve Martin. The BH has
frequently been described as
"the perfect comedy room,"
and its reputation is deserved.
The Boarding House is a
dumpy-looking place with
dirty walls that sits between
and underneath some dumpy
looking buildings on Bush
Street in San Francisco. But
once a show starts there, all ar
chitectural grumbling ceases.
The funny walls, it becomes
apparent, are funny because
they are acoustically perfect, so
much so that even the deafest
among us will marvel at the
sound. The BH is a relatively

small club, seating only a little
over 200 persons, but it often
features Neil Young, Martin,
Joan Baez and Robin Williams.
Boarding House tickets gen
erally run about $6 a show,
though they vary according to
the stature and lust for wealth
of whoever is appearing —
Allen runs a restaurant
downstairs for those who wish
to bribe their way into front row
seats. (Eat first, sit close to the
stage. It works like that). In ad
dition to comedy, the BH fea
tures nearly everything else
that moves — they got rock,
rock-folk, and folk-inflected
rock-soul; they got occasional
bad acts and generally good
acts, and a lot of sleeper sensa
tions.
And if this reads like an A-l
exercise in Korean influence
peddling to you, well tough.
Every critic has his favorite, and
this place deserves one hell of a
plug. So here it is — the Board
ing House, on Bush Street, is a
quality nightclub. All self re
specting nightclub groupies
will swear by it. Go there.
In any case, check a few of
these places out. It could be
edifying, maybe. Sooner or
later your myth is bound to
come up.
