# Cultivate your taste buds at a local winery
## 
### 
Not that visiting wineries is
the only thing to do in northern
California, but there really are
not too many areas in this part
of the state that do not have at
least one winery in the
neighborhood.
Sure enough, several
wineries are situated within a
few miles of the University. For
those who do not have the
means to visit the fabled Napa
vitners or the wineries to the
south, the local establishments
offer good wines in a pleasant
atmosphere.
Because, however, they are
all quite small, it is prudent to
call ahead to ensure that some
one is around to give a talk on
their wines â€” not to mention a
taste of them as well.
Page Mill Winery (948-0958)
is on Page Mill Road, not far
beyond Interstate 280; Sherrill
Cellars (851-1932) is under the
post office in Woodside; and
Woodside Vineyards (851-7475)
is half-a-mile up Kings Mtn.
Road, toward Huddart Park.
Each of these wineries, which

usually open for tasting one
weekend a month, reflect the
family-operation approach that
is blossoming elsewhere in the
United States. They do not
make very much wine, and
therefore, they can sell it on the
premises without the added
expense of distributors and re
tailers. They also do not pre
tend to make wines for a mass
market, and thus they can make
their products with distinctive
tastes and smells.
All three winemakers are
charming and knowledgable
people, making visits to their
wineries a real delight.
As for Napa, the countryside
is beautiful, and it does have
more wineries than one could
adequately cover in a week. Un
fortunately, however, it suffers
from its fame, because the
wineries are crowded, and the
wine that they serve is rarely
their best. In addition, because
they cater to a national
market, they give presentations
on their wines that tend to re
flect the standards of Madison

Avenue.
A much closer and more hos
pitable area for sampling wines
may be found south of Stanford
in the Santa Clara Valley. Paul
Masson, Mirassou and other
large vitners have fine tour
programs and elegant tasting
rooms, and they offer several
excellent wines for sampling.
A little further south, the
Hecker Pass wineries provide
an interesting contrast to those
in the vallev; instead of

technology and corporate capi
tal, one finds in Hecker Pass a
love for the soil and the
painstaking traditions that go
into the making of their wines.
Hecker Pass is about a 45 mi
nute drive from Stanford.
From U.S. 101, drive into Mor
gan Hill and turn right on state
Route 152, toward Watsonville.
Follow the highway to where it
dead ends in Hecker Pass Road.
At that point, several
wineries are within walking

distance of each other. Picnic
areas are convenient, and the
rolling hills make bicycle explo
ration of the area very pleasant.
The Live Oak winery has a
fascinating tasting room and a
very colorful owner, Peter Scag
lioti, who concentrates on mak
ing inexpensive jug wines.
The Bertero winery has more
of a space-age archtictural style
and a wider range of wines to
sample, but its hosts do not
have Scaglioti's somewhat un
usual philosophies about life.
The Fortino and Hecker Pass
wineries are owned by brothers
who hate each other, but they
make good, hearty red wines.
Back along the highway,
there is Kirigan Cellars, where
one can taste their Malvasia
Bianca, and Sycamore Cellars,
off of the Uvas Road turnoff.
