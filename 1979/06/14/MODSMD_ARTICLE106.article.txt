# Rockin' the Bay
## 
### 
Because of San Francisco's
role in the development of rock
music, the Bay Area has an ex
tremely good reputation in the
music industry. Bands and ar
tists of varying size and fame
ususally include a spot in the
area on their itineraries.
What follows is a summary of
the main arenas and pavilions
in the area that host touring
music performers:
Cow Palace. A large, general
purpose auditorium that fea
tures performers likely to draw
crowds of more than 10,000.
Capacity: about 13,000. Geneva
and Santos, San Francisco (off
Bayshore Blvd., near Brisbane).
Oakland-Alameda County
Coliseum Stadium and Arena.
Bill Graham's Days on the
Green, which usually feature
four or five big name perfor
mers, are held at the stadium,
which can hold 60,000, give or
take a few. The arena is of the
basketball and hockey variety
and has a capacity of about
16,000. Fair acoustics. Hegen
berger Rd. and Highway 17,
Oaklard.
Zellerbach Auditorium.
Very nice. An acoustically
superb auditorium on the UC-
Berkeley campus near Bancroft
Ave. The auditorium tends to
have the more mellow variety
of entertainers.
Greek Theatre. Designed in
the shape of an ancient Greek
amphitheatre, this gift of the in
imitable William Randolph
Hearst is built out of slabs of
granite, which bounce the
sound around and, on hot
days, reflect the heat. Capacity:
about 9,000. In the rear of the

campus, next to the stadium.
Paramount Theatre. A very
comfortable and enjoyable
place to hear good music.
Capacity: approximately 3200.
Broadway and West Grand,
Oakland.
Berkeley Community
Theatre. Not as new as Zeller
bach but newer than
Paramount. Excellent acous
tics. Capacity: approximately
3500. Ashton and Grove, Ber
keley.
Concord Pavilion. An in
teresting combination of out
door reserved and "festival"
seating, the pavilion has a co
vered section of seats and a
separate, surrounding grass
arÂ£a. The sound in the reserved
seats is sometimes too loud, be
cause the music has to be heard
in the festival area. Capacity:
approximately 5000. 2000
Kirker Pass Road, Concord.
Center for the Performing
Arts. Perhaps the best au
ditorium in the Bay Area, it is
less than eight years old. Capac
ity: about 3000. Almaden and
Park, San Jose.
Leavey Center. A new,
large-on-the-outside, small
on-the-inside basketball pavil
ion. Those seated far from the
stage can get a tinny echo.
Capacity: about 4500. Univer
sity of Santa Clara, Santa Clara.
Circle Star Theatre. The re
volving stage of this theatre
in-the-round usually earns the
scorn of performers, but the
theatre's acoustics are more
than adequate. Capac
ity: approximately 2000. 1717
Industrial Road, San Carlos.
