# How to get from here to there in the Bay Area
## 
### 
Taking the wrong path and getting lost in
the forest certainly ranks among mankind's
most enduring fears. In the Bay Area, the
paths may take the form of 12 land highways,
the wolves tandem trailer trucks and the
swamps stretches of interminably red traffic
lights, but the troubles of getting around are
no less bothersome here than they are in the
Amazon basin and the Siberian steppes.
Maps, of course, were invented to take the
guesswork out of traveling from A to B. But if
A happens to be the Stanford campus and B
happens to be anywhere farther afield than
downtown Palo Alto, a map does almost
more harm than good to the unexperienced
traveller. Should he follow the heavy red line
which looks as if it ought to be a major
thoroughfare? Or is it in fact a traffic-snarled
thicket of stop lights, stop signs and left hand
turners? Or, foregoing the use of his car,
should he ride the bus which follows the
route marked out in blue, or maybe see if he
could take a train?
What he should do is use the following as a
general guide and refer frequently to the ac
companying map. Given enough time and
diligence, he could probably figure it all out

for himself, but no true humanitarian would
want to make him do it.
The first thing to bear in mind is that local
topography plays a large part in determining
the direction and nature of the lines of trans
portation. The Bay to the east and the hills to
the west accentuate the peninsularity of San
Francisco and environs. The towns and cities
between San Francisco and San Jose can be
thought of as pearls (or more aptly, beans) on
a multi-stranded necklace. The two main
strands are the Bayshore Freeway (Highway
101), which can be considered the eastern
border of Peninsula civilization, and In
terstate 280, which is the western border. In
between run several minor strands for grea
ter or lesser stretches between the two ends.
The most important of these are EI Camino
Real (Highway 82), with which everyone
soon becomes familiar, and Alameda de las
Pulgas (known to the south as Foothill Ex
pressway), which ranges from residential to
rural — and thus is much easier to negotiate
than El Camino.
Which north-south route to take is best
determined by the length of the trip. If it is
not a grteat distance, El Camino is satisfac
tory; if it is several miles, the Alameda be

comes more worthwhile, and if it is further,
one of the freeways is the only reasonable
choice.
Carless
For the carless, the San Mateo County
Transit District operates bus service between
various points in Palo Alto, including a pair
on or near campus, and destinations along El
Camino to the north all the way to San Fran
cisco.
Which of the two freeways to take to San
Francisco is the subject of an on-going con
troversy. Long-time residents tend to line up
behind 101. They claim it is faster than 280.
On the other hand, 280 (officially named the
Junipero Serra Freeway, after the Spanish
monk wh first explored this part of Califor
nia) is designated "the world's most beautiful
freeway." Whether this title is deserved or
not is a matter of personal taste, but 280 is
indisputably the pleasanter of the two roads;
it is newer,wider, smoother, and much more
rural than its bavside counterpart. It is also
easier to reach from campus: it has access
ramps off Page Mill, Alpine and Sand Hill
Roads. The Bayshore, in contrast, is sepa
rated from the University by a forbidding
sequence of traffic hindrances regardless of

which approach is attempted — Willow
Road, University Avenue or Embarcadero
Road.
It is not necessary, however, to have a car
to get toThe City. The Southern Pacific Rail
road runs 17 trains daily from Palo Alto to San
Francisco and an equal number back. The
ride is comfortable and the depot is located
just off campus near the El Camino-
University Avenue overpass.
One ingenious and little known alternative
route is to take the Peerless Stage bus service
from the Palo Alto Greyhound Terminal (on
Alma Street) over the Dumbarton Bridge to
Fremont and take BART (acronymic for Bay
Area Rapid Transit). The route is partly above
ground, partly subterranean; it goes through
Oakland, most of the popular destinations in
San Francisco and winds up in Daly City.
The problem with going carless is getting
around The City. But as it turns out, this is
more easily done than said. In addition to
BART, San Francisco has its famous cable
cars and a full complement of public buses.
While not recommended for scantily clad
young beauties of either sex, this public

transportation is fairly safe and quick and not
really all that unbearable.
The possibilities for east-west travel are
more limited. Highway 84 crosses the Dum
barton Bridge from the East Bay and runs all
the way to the Pacific coast via Redwood City,
Woodside and La Honda. Highway 92 cros
ses the San Mateo Bridge and passes through
San Mateo on its way to Half Moon Bay. Both
these roads become narrow country lanes
when they climb into the hills to the west.
They intersect Skyline Boulevard at the crest
of the highlands and end at Route 1, which
runs along the coast.
To escape this area altogether, there are
five main routes. To the north, the best choice
is Highway 101, which is also the preferred
route south. (The exception to this rule is
when the destination is Santa Cruz and vicin
ity, in which case Highway 17, the major
north-south route of the East Bay which in
tersects 280 in San Jose, is the way to go). To
Sacramento and points north or west, the Bay
Bridge and Interstate 80 is the accepted route.
Points southeast can be reached by the im
probable Highway 152. This branches off 101
in Gilroy about 25 miles south of San Jose.

tory; if it is several miles, the Alameda be

comes more worthwhile, and if it is further,
one of the freeways is the only reasonable
choice.
Carless
For the carless, the San Mateo County
Transit District operates bus service between
various points in Palo Alto, including a pair
on or near campus, and destinations along El
Camino to the north all the way to San Fran
cisco.
Which of the two freeways to take to San
Francisco is the subject of an on-going con
troversy. Long-time residents tend to line up
behind 101. They claim it is faster than 280.
On the other hand, 280 (officially named the
Junipero Serra Freeway, after the Spanish
monk wh first explored this part of Califor
nia) is designated "the world's most beautiful
freeway." Whether this title is deserved or
not is a matter of personal taste, but 280 is
indisputably the pleasanter of the two roads;
it is newer,wider, smoother, and much more
rural than its bavside counterpart. It is also
easier to reach from campus: it has access
ramps off Page Mill, Alpine and Sand Hill
Roads. The Bayshore, in contrast, is sepa
rated from the University by a forbidding
sequence of traffic hindrances regardless of

which approach is attempted — Willow
Road, University Avenue or Embarcadero
Road.
It is not necessary, however, to have a car
to get toThe City. The Southern Pacific Rail
road runs 17 trains daily from Palo Alto to San
Francisco and an equal number back. The
ride is comfortable and the depot is located
just off campus near the El Camino-
University Avenue overpass.
One ingenious and little known alternative
route is to take the Peerless Stage bus service
from the Palo Alto Greyhound Terminal (on
Alma Street) over the Dumbarton Bridge to
Fremont and take BART (acronymic for Bay
Area Rapid Transit). The route is partly above
ground, partly subterranean; it goes through
Oakland, most of the popular destinations in
San Francisco and winds up in Daly City.
The problem with going carless is getting
around The City. But as it turns out, this is
more easily done than said. In addition to
BART, San Francisco has its famous cable
cars and a full complement of public buses.
While not recommended for scantily clad
young beauties of either sex, this public

transportation is fairly safe and quick and not
really all that unbearable.
The possibilities for east-west travel are
more limited. Highway 84 crosses the Dum
barton Bridge from the East Bay and runs all
the way to the Pacific coast via Redwood City,
Woodside and La Honda. Highway 92 cros
ses the San Mateo Bridge and passes through
San Mateo on its way to Half Moon Bay. Both
these roads become narrow country lanes
when they climb into the hills to the west.
They intersect Skyline Boulevard at the crest
of the highlands and end at Route 1, which
runs along the coast.
To escape this area altogether, there are
five main routes. To the north, the best choice
is Highway 101, which is also the preferred
route south. (The exception to this rule is
when the destination is Santa Cruz and vicin
ity, in which case Highway 17, the major
north-south route of the East Bay which in
tersects 280 in San Jose, is the way to go). To
Sacramento and points north or west, the Bay
Bridge and Interstate 80 is the accepted route.
Points southeast can be reached by the im
probable Highway 152. This branches off 101
in Gilroy about 25 miles south of San Jose.

Taking the wrong path and getting lost in
the forest certainly ranks among mankind's
most enduring fears. In the Bay Area, the
paths may take the form of 12 land highways,
the wolves tandem trailer trucks and the
swamps stretches of interminably red traffic
lights, but the troubles of getting around are
no less bothersome here than they are in the
Amazon basin and the Siberian steppes.
Maps, of course, were invented to take the
guesswork out of traveling from A to B. But if
A happens to be the Stanford campus and B
happens to be anywhere farther afield than
downtown Palo Alto, a map does almost
more harm than good to the unexperienced
traveller. Should he follow the heavy red line
which looks as if it ought to be a major
thoroughfare? Or is it in fact a traffic-snarled
thicket of stop lights, stop signs and left hand
turners? Or, foregoing the use of his car,
should he ride the bus which follows the
route marked out in blue, or maybe see if he
could take a train?
What he should do is use the following as a
general guide and refer frequently to the ac
companying map. Given enough time and
diligence, he could probably figure it all out

for himself, but no true humanitarian would
want to make him do it.
The first thing to bear in mind is that local
topography plays a large part in determining
the direction and nature of the lines of trans
portation. The Bay to the east and the hills to
the west accentuate the peninsularity of San
Francisco and environs. The towns and cities
between San Francisco and San Jose can be
thought of as pearls (or more aptly, beans) on
a multi-stranded necklace. The two main
strands are the Bayshore Freeway (Highway
101), which can be considered the eastern
border of Peninsula civilization, and In
terstate 280, which is the western border. In
between run several minor strands for grea
ter or lesser stretches between the two ends.
The most important of these are EI Camino
Real (Highway 82), with which everyone
soon becomes familiar, and Alameda de las
Pulgas (known to the south as Foothill Ex
pressway), which ranges from residential to
rural — and thus is much easier to negotiate
than El Camino.
Which north-south route to take is best
determined by the length of the trip. If it is
not a grteat distance, El Camino is satisfac
tory; if it is several miles, the Alameda be

comes more worthwhile, and if it is further,
one of the freeways is the only reasonable
choice.
