LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint lacques aux
Pointes d'Aspcrges (Mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) andFeuillete
d'Huitre au Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are offered.
As for the entrees, they are

sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
Elegant French-style beans and
a nicely broiled tomato give a
colorful and textural balance to
the presentation of this dish.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, hot apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
for two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives

Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Suzette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95), and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for
what would otherwise be an
uninteresting decor.
LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeuvres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine. The
Terrine Maison a I'Artnagnac was
an unflawed but unexceptional
rendition of home-made pate.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck
flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
All entrees are served with
side dishes of fresh vegetables
and potatoes, which, for once,
were noticeably cooked to per

fection.
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pommes (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75). The excellence
of the coffee was a rare treat.
Les Provinces is a dining ex
perience which can easily com
pete with San Francisco's
French cuisine.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
An excellent cup of coffee

rounds out the meal.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the backroom.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range
in price from $3.95 to $5.50.
Two little known dishes,
Caponadda al tonno (tuna, to
matoes and onions) and insalata
di mare (marinated squids with
shrimps) reflect the important
influence of the sea in the Ita
lian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modes
to's pasta dishes are designed
to be complete meals. In this
case, the waiter's advice is
worth heeding: split the pasta
dish. The Agnolotti alia crema
(round disks of pasta stuffed
with chicken, cheese, and
ham), Gnocchi Verdi al sugo
(small potato flower dumpl
ings), Guanciali al Funghi (pil
lows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings.
Our top recommendation is
panzotti alia crema di noci stile
manuelina (stuffed pasta with
ricotta and walnut sauce).
The regular mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main
courses fill out Modesto's
menu.
The desserts included the
standard fare of ice cream,
zabaglione, sherberts and creme
caramel.
A fine espresso rounds out the
meal.
The waiters, many of whom

are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft candle
light, and the quiet charm of the
lights of the Bay make Modes
to's well worth returning to.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quitely
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers,
and candle light and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandana
vian Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 for one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal; Cheese cake, assorted
cakes and pastries (all $1.60),
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream ($1.25) and
Creme Caramel ($1.50) easily
triumph over your calorific con
science.
The Gatehouse also has a
huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for lunch
from 11:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.;
and for Sunday Brunch from 10
a.m. until 2:30 p.m. For Friday
and Saturday evenings, reser
vations are recommended.

MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, devoted
clientele Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romania ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.20) we chose Lin
guine Von-
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with sea food ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from such
fish dishes as Sole Meuniere
($9.95) and Sole Florentine with
Shrimp ($10.50) to Chicken al
Forno Arturo ($8.25) and Steak
Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.,
Through Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m., and 6-10 p.m.
FOURNOU'S OVEN
Stanford Court Hotel
905 California
San Francisco
989-1910
Fournou's is a restaurant of
some renown and it deserves its
reputation independent of its
exclusive mother establish
ment.
All areas of the menu are
well-balanced and difficult
choices present themselves
equally in the appetizer and en
tree categories.
Even the wine list is some
thing to get excited about. It
contains perhaps the most
comprehensive listing of small
California wineries of quality.
Chardonnays and cabernets are
especially well-represented.
It is for its dishes "from the
ovens" that Fournou's is fam
ous. In fact the ovens are in
plain sight in the "old" part of
the restaurant.
The dessert selection has
something for everyone — Pro
fiteroles, fresh strawberry tar
telette, brie and even
cheesecake.
Moreover, both the menu
and the wine list offer the
traveler at Stanford Court and
the diner the gastronomique
best of California.
