Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279
El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to ev
erything sampled, clearly were
the best items on the menu. Cal
los a la Mttdrilena (Tripe Madrid
style $2.50), Dabadana Asturiana
(casserole of white beans, ham,
chorizo and pork $2.75) and
Chorizo Salteado (sauteed
chorizo $2.50), are three of the
rarer items in the appetizer
category. Calamares Rebuzados
(breaded baby squid with le
mon) is a best buy at $2.50. A
huge plate of the squid would
have been more than enough
for a main course. And they
were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil
and vinegar dressing, is
superb.
Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50.
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Maritiera ($16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this" dish

would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you
can choose between the classic
flan, the Budin de Pan (bread
pudding) or theNatillas (special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super
hot sauce to the tamales, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estrel
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie

bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis
hes to please most anyone's
tastes.
Some of the house entrees
are particularly noteworthy.
Especially delightful is the La
Posada Tostada which is the
biggest tostada you've probably
ever seen. Do yourself a favor
and only order one. The second
will go to waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the
shopping center from 11:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.
Asian
MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View*
969-3232
Among the great conglomer
ation of inauthentic,

"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Captonese, Man
darin and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef«
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
the "most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalleled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuis\ne, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with

some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE
STAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
premier Nguyen Ton Joan the
Mekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never over
power the ingredients' own
character. The distinct but sub
tle spicing and the fresh ingre
dients reflects the great care in

preparation of food at the
Mekong.
Notable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries. The
Mekong offers a very civilized
but casual atmosphere.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cooke v.
Their simple diet of thin-sliceu,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century
A.D. The Chinese added veget
ables and other ingredients,
and the cuisine became known
as the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars) are
in for a new treat — an entree
bar! Dinner is priced at $4.95
and includes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh veg
etables, including shredded
carrots, onions, celery, cab
bage, bean sprouts and cilan

tro, are next.
Everything is topped oft by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one
spoke English very well. Col
onel Lee's might be just the tic
ket if you are looking for some
thing truly unusual.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent
Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties.
