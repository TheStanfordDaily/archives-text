# Making students aware of Stanford's financial needs
## Senior Pledge Program asks for commitment 
### Alisa Terrell 
The Senior Pledge Program
for the Class of 1979 is off to
a slow but steady start. The
student-initiated, student-run
fund raising program which
kicked off in the beginning of
April has thus far received
pledges from only 6.9 percent
of the approximately 1500
seniors graduating this month.
The program encourages
seniors to make a three-year
non-binding pledge to the Uni
versity that will be tax
deductible. The pledges are
confidential, and seniors may
designate where they want the
money to be applied. Seniors
are urged to contribute to some
thing that has been important
to them here at the University,
such as Overseas Studies,
Ram's Head, the Band or the
Glee Club. A total pledge of $50
is suggested, which can be paid
in installments of $10, $15 and
$25 during the three-year
period.
A core committee of seven
seniors has worked to coordi

nate the program since Autumn
Quarter. In April about 40 vol
unteers began to contact
seniors in their dorms person
ally, giving them brochures de
scribing the program. Off
campus seniors received infor
mation in the mail and were
then contacted by phone.
The purpose of the Senior
Pledge Program is to educate
students to the financial needs
of the University, according to
julee Peterson, one of the core
committee co-chairmen.
Seniors who contribute now
will be more likely to contribute
in the future. Also, strong par
ticipation by recent graduates
in a pledge program encour
ages corporations and founda
tions to give money to the Uni
versity, she said.
The Senior Pledge Pro
gram is not intended to take
in big bucks," said Dennis
Franks, a member of the core
committee. "We're looking for
a high percentage of the class
making small contributions.

People like to see what kind of
support graduates show."
But with tuition costs rising
annually, many seniors ques
tion the University's need for
additional money from those
already burdened by high tui
tion costs.
"After having paid $8000 a
year for four years, I figure even
$10 will do me a lot more good
now than it will do them," said
one senior.
However, the University is
heavily dependent on private
gifts from seniors and alumni,
according to Larry Owen, a
management associate in the
Management and Financial
Planning office. Private support
accounts for 33.1 percent of the
needed funds for the cost of an
education here, he said.
The University relies heavily
on such small gifts. Last year4s
percent of the Annual Fund
donations were less than $25,
according to Franks.
The program began last year.
By last August, 18 percent of
the graduating seniors of 1978
had participated in either the
Senior Pledge Program or the

similar pledge program in the
Engineering Dept., according
to Wendy Bennett, director of
student development programs
for the Annual Fund. This year
it looks as if the Senior Pledge
Program is "not going to be as
successful as last year," Bennett
said.
"Last year I think we were
helped by the controversy over
the South African investment
issue," Bennett said. "People
boycotting the Pledge Program
because of South African in
vestment stirred up enough
controversy over contributing
to the University that the
Pledge Program got a lot of at
tention.
"This year people seem to be
pretty apathetic, but 1 have high
expectations for the program.
One of our goals is an overall,
long-range consciousness rais
ing to the needs of the Univer
sity."
Bennett said that an impor
tant aspect of the program was
the student volunteers.
"Their involvement, energy
and enthusiasm are important
factors in this program," she
said.

One volunteer noted that he
had learned a lot about
fundraising from his experi
ence with the Program.
"It's not the most enjoyable
thing to call up people, espe
cially friends, and ask for
money," he said. "You get the
few clowns who tell you you're
full of shit, but the nice people
make it all worth while."
Participation in senior pledg
ing is much higher at East
ern schools with similar prog
rams. In 1978, 30 percent of the
seniors at Harvard pledged,
while 40 percent at Princeton
and 35 percent at Dartmouth
did the same.
Volunteer Denise Irusta
explained this by saying, "A lot
of people are disenchanted
with giving money to the Uni
versity. They don't look at it
from the point of view of what
Stanford is giving them.
"Although our program is
new, it is successful in that
we're educating people to the
needs of the University. As
people become more and more
informed, they'll start giving,"
she said.
