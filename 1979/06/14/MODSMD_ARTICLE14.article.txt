# Alumni Association offers varied programs

So you've just joined the il
lustrious ranks of the many
famous, infamous and other
wise unknown Stanford
alumni, ... So what?
Unbeknownst to you, some
one besides your family, your
nearest and dearest friends and
possibly you yourself has noted
the glorious significance of your
graduation — the Stanford
Alumni Association.
The Alumni Association is
not part of the same institution
that has taken your money for
the past four years of your life in
return, some contend, for an
"educa'tion."
"We're in business as an in
dependent association to pro
vide service," said Director Wil
liam Stone, a University alum
nus.
Since he trekked across the
Quad two years ago from his
position as assistant to Presi
dent Richard Lyman, one of
Stone's main goals has been to
increase the involvement of
young alumni in the Associa
tion.
Around 500 undergraduates
are members, thanks largely to
the Association's sly dealings
with parents. "We send publi
cations to students' homes and
even occasionally let parents
join. We overlook their lack of
judgment in not coming here
themselves," Stone explained.
/ /T ast year I told the
Lifreshmen parents that
their students won't write
them, so we will."
This past year the Alumni
Association worked closely
with senior class activities,
sponsored Stanford-in-
Government, provided starv
ing students with counselor
jobs at its Sierra Camp, hosted
Class Day activities and pub
lished a special senior edition of
its quarterly Almanac for your
perusal.
They awarded one of your

classmates the newly
created J.E. Wallace Sterling
award for leadership. And one
of your Senior Class Presidents,
Amy Breck, served on the As
sociation's 24-member Board of
Trustees.
After missing out on all those
events, why should you be in
terested in the Alumni Associa
tion now? Stone would advise
you not to dismiss your op
tions.
Membership in the Associa
tion is "a good way to stay in
touch," he said. "If something
you want comes up, you can
take advantage of it."
Those options entail a wide
range of projects and un
usual opportunities. To dispel
one common but incorrect
stereotype, Stone said, "We are
not just a martini weenie outfit.
We don't just hold tailgaters
and cocktail parties." In other
words, the Association is not
just an organizer for pre
football game happy hours.
Besides running the ever
popular retreats at the Sierra
Camp and the ski chalet, the
Alumni Association offers
many educational programs.
The Association hosted the
12-speaker Campus Confer
ence for 1600 people last month
and will hold about six, 10-day
courses this summer.
On a grander scale, profes

sors travel with alumni on
study tours throughout the
world — to Africa, down the
Danube, to Japan, in the Ae
gean and to Florence, just to
name a few.
The Association also com
missions faculty scholars to
write for The Stanford Magazine,

which publishes "pop scholar
ship" twice annually, and three
to four additions of its Portable
Stanford series per year.
Both publications allow
alumni to keep up with the
academic discovery and re
search here, according to
Stone. The Portable Stanford, de
scribed by Stone as "unique,"
captivates about 11,000 sub
scribers at $3.95 an issue with
such topics as economics by
George Shultz, stress man
agement, poetry and the next
issue on birth control.
About 250 faculty members
work for the Association in
some capacity each year. Stone
said, "I see more faculty here
than when I worked for Presi
dent Lyman,"
"We're very much into Stan
ford and the community, al
though technically separate,"
Stone said. The University
owns the Association building
and land, he added, but the
50,000-member Association it
self is legally detached from the
University.
Only 20 percent of all
private-college alumni organi
zations are independently
based. Stone said that inde
pendence allows the Associa
tion to benefit from added flexi
bility while at the same time in
directly contributing to Stan
ford's financial welfare.
Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig,
also the University representa
tive on the Association execu
tive board, explained that the
Association "does not engage
in fundraising" for explicit and
long-standing reasons. The As
sociation can "serve the Uni

versity best by not asking for
money," he said. "Its job is to
provide services and to keep
people happy."
Nonetheless, the University
does benefit monetarily from
the efforts of the Association.
"There is a high correlation
between University gifts and
involvement in the Alumni As
sociation," said David Fulton,
communications director of the
Office of Development. "It is a
tremendous benefit to the Uni
versity and an organization
we've always worked very
closely with," he said.
Rosenzweig pointed out that
people active in the Alumni As
sociation "tend to fundraise for
the University. They're not two
separate groups of people." He
said that if the Association did
not exist, "we'd have to invent
it."
The Association is now com
pleting construction of a
$250,000 addition to house
those employees who were
forced to work in a trailer by
Memorial Church this year. The
financial means for the addition
were drawn out of the life
membership fund, according to
Stone.
Stone said that many Associ
ation projects run a de
ficit, but he added that the de
ficits are paid for with member
ship fees so the Association as a
whole breaks even on its $4.25
million annual budget.
"I don't see us needing to
make a profit," Stone said. "We
pay for our programs by
broadening our base of mem
bership.
"Here, you get back what
you buy" when you join, he
said.

Though legally separate, the Association maintains close ties with the University while providing a
myriad of services for members.
