# Class gift to benefit Lathrop lot, SURE
## 
### 
The Class of 1979 will donate
three park benches to the
University and give $200 to
Students United for Rape
Elimination (SURE) as the class
gifts, according to the senior
class presidents.
The official presentation of
the gifts will take place at the
Class Day luncheon Saturday.
The benches, valued at $200
each, will be placed in the
"former desert" between Lat
hrop House and the post office.
That area is presently being
landscaped after sitting for
years with an overgrowth of
weeds. The entire project, in
cluding placement of the
benches, will be completed
within a month.
Senior Class President Leslie
Crozier said money constraints
prevented the class from giving
some of the more ambitious
gifts seniors' had suggested
such as sodding the Quad, pro
viding additional lighting along
some bike paths, or giving a
scholarship for a student in
women's studies.

//TA7e only had $800 to
VV spend and $800 isn't
enough to do alot of big
things," Crozier said.
"The area (where the
benches will be placed) has
been vacant and ugly for so
long," that it seemed an ap
propriate gift for a group with
limited funds.
Concerning the $200 gift to
SURE, Crozier said, "We felt
we wanted to give to a worth
while cause." She said some of
the other organizations consi
dered, such as Children's Hos
pital, had other sources of
funds, but SURE is a new or
ganization .
SURE provides escorts for
female students at night from
8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. The
group was organized this year,
following a series of sexual as
saults on campus, in response
to a growing awareness of the
rape issue on campus.
Ideas on what to give the
University came from a straw
poll of seniors conducted in
White Plaza earlier this year.
