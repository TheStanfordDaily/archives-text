LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feuillete
d'Huitre an Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are ot'ered.
As tor the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, not apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.

LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeurres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck

flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pommes (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75).
L'ORANGERIE
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep
shows and massage parlors on

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French
restaurant serving classical
haute cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and
everthing is expensive. Frugal
ity is anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole da Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
($14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and
the Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is
an excellent side dish. Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup)
is a superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52,
and with beverages, tax and tip,
it was almost $80 tor two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire tor men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
tor two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives
Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
L'OMELETTE
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direc
tion of owner-chef Louis Borel
as a fine French restaurant serv
ing excellent food in a friendly

and efficient manner.
Dinner at L'Omelette in
cludes soup du jour, salad,
fresh vegetable du jour and
potato or rice. Also available for
an extra charge are any of the 10
appetizers, onion soup
gratinee, a large array of de
sserts, a choice of beverages
and any selection from the
eight-page wine list.
Indecision when choos
ing a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the
regular offerings, which in
clude such diverse choices as
Paupiette de Sole Deauville
($9.75), fillet of sole with
creamed lobster sauce, mus
hrooms and shrimp, and Civet
de Lapm, Chasseur ($8.95), rab
bit, hunter's style, L'Omelette
serves a variety of house
specialties that change daily.
LA GUINGUETIE
593 Woodside Road
Redwood City
369-7364
The menu is typically French
and includes such dishes as ter
riiie (similar to pate), escargots,
frogs' legs and duck a I'orange
along with more familiar meat
dishes. However, the house
particularly prides itself on its

seafood, fresh daily, and on its
Southern (Provencal) French
cuisine, which requires genera
ous quantities of butter, tomato
and garlic. Provencal cuisine is
not grand; rather it is a particu
lar stvle of cuisine de famille (fam
ily cooking).
Most entrees are priced from
$8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highv
seasoned fish stew from Marse
ille) and veal in champagne
sauce ($ll each). All entrees in
clude the soup of the day, a
plain salad (with a good vinaig
rette dressing) and fresh veget
ables.
The surroundings are pleas
ant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh
flowers on each table. The at
mosphere is relaxed, and you
mav set vour own pace tor the
meal; the service, while not per
fect, is good-natured and unob
trusive.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed, Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative

to restaurants within a similar
price range (the Good Earth,
Mama Ney's and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
ot marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back tor more.
Salad is included in the price
of all dinner items (with no limit
on how many times you can go
back to refill vour plate), or can
be ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8, an exquisite
presentation ot red caviar,
whole artichoke, chilled
smoked salmon, and brie
cheese served with a split of
champagne.
Desserts are simple and re
flect a preference tor "the or
ganic."
Chinese and
Oriental
MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomer

ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Man
darine and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken and
the mustard sauce with which it
is served may not please every
American. This is not a poor re
flection on the kitchen, but
rather it means that American
tastes are not accustomed to all
the tastes of Chinese cooking.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the rnu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent

Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.
HSI-NAN
75 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
323-6550
Hsi-nan specializes in Szec

huan cookery, renowned for its
hot and spicy dishes, and the
spicing here is more distinct
and hotter than other
Szechuan-style restaurants in
the area. It is "the way the dis
hes should be prepared," says
the owner, but the hotness can
be altered to suit your taste.
The food is excellent, but the
prices are quite reasonable;
about $5 should do you nicely
unless you want to add beer.
The Chicken in Peking sauce
is a must for aficionados of hot
black bean sauce, and the Szec
huan shredded beef is a
"knockout" dish in generous
portion.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE
STAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great

people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
Eremiere Nguyenton Hoan, the
lekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never over
power the ingredients' own
character.
Noteable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
Perhaps one of the finest
traditions in the Stanford area,

Ming's offers surprisingly in
expensive meals in a pleasant
setting.
Set just off Highway 101 at
the end of Embarcadero Road,
Ming's offers a broad range of
Cantonese cuisine and has
done so since 1956.
The menu includes five basic
dinners, ranging in price from
$7.50 to $15, and supplements
these with numerous a la carte
o'fferings.
The atmosphere is pleasant
in the large dining rooms, and
service is prompt and attentive.
Reservations are advised, or
you can take your chances and
wait for your table in the bar,
where hot hors d'oeuvres are
served regularly along with
moderate quality drinks.
Mexican
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis
hes to please most anyone's
tastes.
Some of the house entrees
are particularly noteworthy.
Especially delightful is the La
Posada Tostada which is the
biggest tostada you've probably
ever seen. Do yourself a favor
and only order one. The second
will go to waste.

Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the
shopping center from 11:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estral
lita. Estrallita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humungous portions of qual
ity tare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super

hot sauce to the tamaies, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estral
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get bv easilv with
$4.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers,
and candlelight and wine. Not

that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandana
vian Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 tor one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal.
HUGO'S MARKET
Rickey's Hyatt House
Palo Alto
493-8000
One important thing to re
member about Hugo's Market,
go hungry!
In between, you can choose a
variety of entrees ranging from
the expected steaks, New York
(9 oz. $11.95,12 oz. $14.50) and
Filet Mignon ($14.95) to more
exotic seafood selections such
as Crabmeat Cannelloni Floren
tine ($10.25), pasta shells filled
with crabmeat and spinach.
Attentive, unobtrusive ser
vice continues from the mo
ment you walk in the door
through the free after-dinner
liquer. The wine includes a
good selection of California
wines complete with small
maps of the different wine reg
ions.
Extensive does not quite
cover the range of salad choices
included with the price of the
entree.
Conservative decor and at
tentive service mark Hugo's
Market.
AUGUSTO'S RESTAURANT
856 West El Camino Real
Mountain View
965-1869
At Augusto's Restaurant, the
initial impression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
characterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun."
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The bill

for two of us, less wine, but in
cluding one drink each, was
$40 Without the<? la carte salad,
and with less expensive de
ssert. that price would be closer
to $30.
The price of the entree (which
averages around $10 or $11) in
cludes a green salad or soup du
jour, and a side dish of vegeta
bles. -
In short, for the best in liaut
cuisine and/or the most formal of
eventngs go somewhere else
But for good European food, in
a triendiv. relaxed atmosphere,
Augusto's is a pleasant even
ing.-
MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, deVoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia Romagna
($5.20), we chose Linguine Von
gole to share.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two) and mushroom ($5).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from such
fish dishes as Sole Meuniere
($9.95) and Sole Florentine with
Shrimp ($10.50) to Chicken til
Forno Arturo ($8.25) and Steak
Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena s decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifulh
painted screens and chan
deliers.
The capsule reviews which

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomer

ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Man
darine and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken and
the mustard sauce with which it
is served may not please every
American. This is not a poor re
flection on the kitchen, but
rather it means that American
tastes are not accustomed to all
the tastes of Chinese cooking.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the rnu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent

Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.
HSI-NAN
75 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
323-6550
Hsi-nan specializes in Szec

huan cookery, renowned for its
hot and spicy dishes, and the
spicing here is more distinct
and hotter than other
Szechuan-style restaurants in
the area. It is "the way the dis
hes should be prepared," says
the owner, but the hotness can
be altered to suit your taste.
The food is excellent, but the
prices are quite reasonable;
about $5 should do you nicely
unless you want to add beer.
The Chicken in Peking sauce
is a must for aficionados of hot
black bean sauce, and the Szec
huan shredded beef is a
"knockout" dish in generous
portion.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE

This restaurant offers great

people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
Eremiere Nguyenton Hoan, the
lekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten

Noteable among the entrees

Set just off Highway 101 at

done so since 1956.
The menu includes five basic

$7.50 to $15, and supplements
these with numerous a la carte

LA POSADA

For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis

Some of the house entrees

Especially delightful is the La

LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estral
lita. Estrallita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humungous portions of qual
ity tare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super

hot sauce to the tamaies, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estral
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get bv easilv with

HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers,
and candlelight and wine. Not

that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandana
vian Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 tor one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal.
HUGO'S MARKET
Rickey's Hyatt House
Palo Alto
493-8000
One important thing to re
member about Hugo's Market,
go hungry!
In between, you can choose a
variety of entrees ranging from
the expected steaks, New York
(9 oz. $11.95,12 oz. $14.50) and
Filet Mignon ($14.95) to more
exotic seafood selections such
as Crabmeat Cannelloni Floren
tine ($10.25), pasta shells filled
with crabmeat and spinach.
Attentive, unobtrusive ser
vice continues from the mo
ment you walk in the door
through the free after-dinner
liquer. The wine includes a
good selection of California
wines complete with small
maps of the different wine reg
ions.
Extensive does not quite
cover the range of salad choices
included with the price of the
entree.
Conservative decor and at
tentive service mark Hugo's
Market.
AUGUSTO'S RESTAURANT
856 West El Camino Real
Mountain View
965-1869
At Augusto's Restaurant, the
initial impression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
characterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun."
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The bill

for two of us, less wine, but in
cluding one drink each, was
$40 Without the<? la carte salad,
and with less expensive de
ssert. that price would be closer
to $30.
The price of the entree (which
averages around $10 or $11) in
cludes a green salad or soup du
jour, and a side dish of vegeta
bles. -
In short, for the best in liaut
cuisine and/or the most formal of
eventngs go somewhere else
But for good European food, in
a triendiv. relaxed atmosphere,
Augusto's is a pleasant even

MADDALENA'S CONTI

544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, deVoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia Romagna
($5.20), we chose Linguine Von
gole to share.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two) and mushroom ($5).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from such
fish dishes as Sole Meuniere
($9.95) and Sole Florentine with
Shrimp ($10.50) to Chicken til
Forno Arturo ($8.25) and Steak
Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena s decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifulh
painted screens and chan
deliers.
The capsule reviews which

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feuillete
d'Huitre an Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are ot'ered.
As tor the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, not apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.

LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeurres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck

flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pommes (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75).
L'ORANGERIE
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep
shows and massage parlors on

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French
restaurant serving classical
haute cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and
everthing is expensive. Frugal
ity is anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole da Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
($14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and
the Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is
an excellent side dish. Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup)
is a superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52,
and with beverages, tax and tip,
it was almost $80 tor two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire tor men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
tor two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives
Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
L'OMELETTE
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direc
tion of owner-chef Louis Borel
as a fine French restaurant serv
ing excellent food in a friendly

and efficient manner.
Dinner at L'Omelette in
cludes soup du jour, salad,
fresh vegetable du jour and
potato or rice. Also available for
an extra charge are any of the 10
appetizers, onion soup
gratinee, a large array of de
sserts, a choice of beverages
and any selection from the
eight-page wine list.
Indecision when choos
ing a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the
regular offerings, which in
clude such diverse choices as
Paupiette de Sole Deauville
($9.75), fillet of sole with
creamed lobster sauce, mus
hrooms and shrimp, and Civet
de Lapm, Chasseur ($8.95), rab
bit, hunter's style, L'Omelette
serves a variety of house
specialties that change daily.
LA GUINGUETIE
593 Woodside Road
Redwood City
369-7364
The menu is typically French
and includes such dishes as ter
riiie (similar to pate), escargots,
frogs' legs and duck a I'orange
along with more familiar meat
dishes. However, the house
particularly prides itself on its

seafood, fresh daily, and on its
Southern (Provencal) French
cuisine, which requires genera
ous quantities of butter, tomato
and garlic. Provencal cuisine is
not grand; rather it is a particu
lar stvle of cuisine de famille (fam
ily cooking).
Most entrees are priced from
$8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highv
seasoned fish stew from Marse
ille) and veal in champagne
sauce ($ll each). All entrees in
clude the soup of the day, a
plain salad (with a good vinaig
rette dressing) and fresh veget
ables.
The surroundings are pleas
ant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh
flowers on each table. The at
mosphere is relaxed, and you
mav set vour own pace tor the
meal; the service, while not per
fect, is good-natured and unob
trusive.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed, Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative

to restaurants within a similar
price range (the Good Earth,
Mama Ney's and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
ot marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back tor more.
Salad is included in the price
of all dinner items (with no limit
on how many times you can go
back to refill vour plate), or can
be ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8, an exquisite
presentation ot red caviar,
whole artichoke, chilled

between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade

Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of

not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even

THE GATEHOUSE

of starched linen, fresh flowers,

that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the

AUGUSTO'S RESTAURANT

At Augusto's Restaurant, the

Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not

$40 Without the<? la carte salad,
and with less expensive de

Now in its second year and

for any self-professed French or

Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi

The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni

Maddalena's offers salads a la

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a

tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feuillete
d'Huitre an Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are ot'ered.
As tor the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur

A good cross section of de

LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeurres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck

flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
Standing out from the list of

ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar

L'ORANGERIE

San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French
restaurant serving classical
haute cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and
everthing is expensive. Frugal
ity is anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole da Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
($14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and
the Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is
an excellent side dish. Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup)
is a superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52,
and with beverages, tax and tip,
it was almost $80 tor two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire tor men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
tor two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives
Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
L'OMELETTE
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direc
tion of owner-chef Louis Borel
as a fine French restaurant serv
ing excellent food in a friendly

and efficient manner.
Dinner at L'Omelette in
cludes soup du jour, salad,
fresh vegetable du jour and
potato or rice. Also available for
an extra charge are any of the 10
appetizers, onion soup
gratinee, a large array of de
sserts, a choice of beverages
and any selection from the
eight-page wine list.
Indecision when choos
ing a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the
regular offerings, which in
clude such diverse choices as
Paupiette de Sole Deauville
($9.75), fillet of sole with
creamed lobster sauce, mus
hrooms and shrimp, and Civet
de Lapm, Chasseur ($8.95), rab
bit, hunter's style, L'Omelette
serves a variety of house
specialties that change daily.
LA GUINGUETIE
593 Woodside Road
Redwood City
369-7364
The menu is typically French
and includes such dishes as ter
riiie (similar to pate), escargots,
frogs' legs and duck a I'orange
along with more familiar meat
dishes. However, the house
particularly prides itself on its

seafood, fresh daily, and on its
Southern (Provencal) French
cuisine, which requires genera
ous quantities of butter, tomato
and garlic. Provencal cuisine is
not grand; rather it is a particu
lar stvle of cuisine de famille (fam
ily cooking).
Most entrees are priced from
$8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highv
seasoned fish stew from Marse
ille) and veal in champagne
sauce ($ll each). All entrees in
clude the soup of the day, a
plain salad (with a good vinaig
rette dressing) and fresh veget
ables.
The surroundings are pleas
ant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh
flowers on each table. The at
mosphere is relaxed, and you
mav set vour own pace tor the
meal; the service, while not per
fect, is good-natured and unob
trusive.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed, Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative

to restaurants within a similar
price range (the Good Earth,
Mama Ney's and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
ot marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back tor more.
Salad is included in the price
of all dinner items (with no limit
on how many times you can go
back to refill vour plate), or can
be ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8, an exquisite
presentation ot red caviar,
whole artichoke, chilled
smoked salmon, and brie
cheese served with a split of
champagne.
Desserts are simple and re
flect a preference tor "the or
ganic."
Chinese and
Oriental
MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomer

ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Man
darine and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken and
the mustard sauce with which it
is served may not please every
American. This is not a poor re
flection on the kitchen, but
rather it means that American
tastes are not accustomed to all
the tastes of Chinese cooking.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the rnu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent

Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.
HSI-NAN
75 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
323-6550
Hsi-nan specializes in Szec

huan cookery, renowned for its
hot and spicy dishes, and the
spicing here is more distinct
and hotter than other
Szechuan-style restaurants in
the area. It is "the way the dis
hes should be prepared," says
the owner, but the hotness can
be altered to suit your taste.
The food is excellent, but the
prices are quite reasonable;
about $5 should do you nicely
unless you want to add beer.
The Chicken in Peking sauce
is a must for aficionados of hot
black bean sauce, and the Szec
huan shredded beef is a
"knockout" dish in generous
portion.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE
STAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great

people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
Eremiere Nguyenton Hoan, the
lekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never over
power the ingredients' own
character.
Noteable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
Perhaps one of the finest
traditions in the Stanford area,

Ming's offers surprisingly in
expensive meals in a pleasant
setting.
Set just off Highway 101 at
the end of Embarcadero Road,
Ming's offers a broad range of
Cantonese cuisine and has
done so since 1956.
The menu includes five basic
dinners, ranging in price from
$7.50 to $15, and supplements
these with numerous a la carte
o'fferings.
The atmosphere is pleasant
in the large dining rooms, and
service is prompt and attentive.
Reservations are advised, or
you can take your chances and
wait for your table in the bar,
where hot hors d'oeuvres are
served regularly along with
moderate quality drinks.
Mexican
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis
hes to please most anyone's
tastes.
Some of the house entrees
are particularly noteworthy.
Especially delightful is the La
Posada Tostada which is the
biggest tostada you've probably
ever seen. Do yourself a favor
and only order one. The second
will go to waste.

Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the
shopping center from 11:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estral
lita. Estrallita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humungous portions of qual
ity tare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super

hot sauce to the tamaies, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estral
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get bv easilv with
$4.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal

The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52,
and with beverages, tax and tip,
it was almost $80 tor two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire tor men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
tor two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives
Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
L'OMELETTE

L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direc

as a fine French restaurant serv
ing excellent food in a friendly

and efficient manner.
Dinner at L'Omelette in
cludes soup du jour, salad,
fresh vegetable du jour and
potato or rice. Also available for
an extra charge are any of the 10
appetizers, onion soup
gratinee, a large array of de
sserts, a choice of beverages
and any selection from the
eight-page wine list.
Indecision when choos
ing a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the
regular offerings, which in
clude such diverse choices as
Paupiette de Sole Deauville
($9.75), fillet of sole with
creamed lobster sauce, mus
hrooms and shrimp, and Civet
de Lapm, Chasseur ($8.95), rab
bit, hunter's style, L'Omelette
serves a variety of house
specialties that change daily.
LA GUINGUETIE
593 Woodside Road
Redwood City
369-7364
The menu is typically French
and includes such dishes as ter
riiie (similar to pate), escargots,
frogs' legs and duck a I'orange
along with more familiar meat
dishes. However, the house
particularly prides itself on its

seafood, fresh daily, and on its
Southern (Provencal) French
cuisine, which requires genera
ous quantities of butter, tomato
and garlic. Provencal cuisine is
not grand; rather it is a particu
lar stvle of cuisine de famille (fam
ily cooking).
Most entrees are priced from
$8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highv
seasoned fish stew from Marse
ille) and veal in champagne
sauce ($ll each). All entrees in
clude the soup of the day, a
plain salad (with a good vinaig
rette dressing) and fresh veget
ables.
The surroundings are pleas
ant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh
flowers on each table. The at
mosphere is relaxed, and you

WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed, Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative

to restaurants within a similar
price range (the Good Earth,
Mama Ney's and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
ot marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back tor more.
Salad is included in the price
of all dinner items (with no limit
on how many times you can go
back to refill vour plate), or can
be ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8, an exquisite
presentation ot red caviar,
whole artichoke, chilled

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomer

ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac

Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken and
the mustard sauce with which it
is served may not please every
American. This is not a poor re
flection on the kitchen, but
rather it means that American
tastes are not accustomed to all
the tastes of Chinese cooking.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the rnu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent

Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.
HSI-NAN
75 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
323-6550
Hsi-nan specializes in Szec

huan cookery, renowned for its
hot and spicy dishes, and the
spicing here is more distinct
and hotter than other
Szechuan-style restaurants in
the area. It is "the way the dis
hes should be prepared," says
the owner, but the hotness can
be altered to suit your taste.
The food is excellent, but the
prices are quite reasonable;
about $5 should do you nicely
unless you want to add beer.
The Chicken in Peking sauce
is a must for aficionados of hot
black bean sauce, and the Szec
huan shredded beef is a
"knockout" dish in generous
portion.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE
STAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great

people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
Eremiere Nguyenton Hoan, the
lekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never over
power the ingredients' own
character.
Noteable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
Perhaps one of the finest
traditions in the Stanford area,

Ming's offers surprisingly in
expensive meals in a pleasant
setting.
Set just off Highway 101 at
the end of Embarcadero Road,
Ming's offers a broad range of
Cantonese cuisine and has
done so since 1956.
The menu includes five basic
dinners, ranging in price from
$7.50 to $15, and supplements
these with numerous a la carte
o'fferings.
The atmosphere is pleasant
in the large dining rooms, and
service is prompt and attentive.
Reservations are advised, or
you can take your chances and
wait for your table in the bar,
where hot hors d'oeuvres are
served regularly along with
moderate quality drinks.
Mexican
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis
hes to please most anyone's
tastes.
Some of the house entrees
are particularly noteworthy.
Especially delightful is the La
Posada Tostada which is the
biggest tostada you've probably
ever seen. Do yourself a favor
and only order one. The second
will go to waste.

Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the
shopping center from 11:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estral
lita. Estrallita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humungous portions of qual
ity tare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super

hot sauce to the tamaies, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estral
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get bv easilv with
$4.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers,
and candlelight and wine. Not

that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandana
vian Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 tor one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal.
HUGO'S MARKET
Rickey's Hyatt House
Palo Alto
493-8000
One important thing to re
member about Hugo's Market,
go hungry!
In between, you can choose a
variety of entrees ranging from
the expected steaks, New York
(9 oz. $11.95,12 oz. $14.50) and
Filet Mignon ($14.95) to more
exotic seafood selections such
as Crabmeat Cannelloni Floren
tine ($10.25), pasta shells filled
with crabmeat and spinach.
Attentive, unobtrusive ser
vice continues from the mo
ment you walk in the door
through the free after-dinner
liquer. The wine includes a
good selection of California
wines complete with small
maps of the different wine reg
ions.
Extensive does not quite
cover the range of salad choices
included with the price of the
entree.
Conservative decor and at
tentive service mark Hugo's
Market.
AUGUSTO'S RESTAURANT
856 West El Camino Real
Mountain View
965-1869
At Augusto's Restaurant, the
initial impression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
characterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun."
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The bill

for two of us, less wine, but in
cluding one drink each, was
$40 Without the<? la carte salad,
and with less expensive de
ssert. that price would be closer
to $30.
The price of the entree (which
averages around $10 or $11) in
cludes a green salad or soup du
jour, and a side dish of vegeta
bles. -
In short, for the best in liaut
cuisine and/or the most formal of
eventngs go somewhere else
But for good European food, in
a triendiv. relaxed atmosphere,
Augusto's is a pleasant even
ing.-
MADDALENA'S CONTI

544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, deVoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia Romagna
($5.20), we chose Linguine Von
gole to share.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two) and mushroom ($5).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from such
fish dishes as Sole Meuniere
($9.95) and Sole Florentine with
Shrimp ($10.50) to Chicken til
Forno Arturo ($8.25) and Steak
Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena s decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifulh
painted screens and chan
deliers.
The capsule reviews which
follow are condensed versions
ot restaurant reviews which
have appeared in the Daily this

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feuillete
d'Huitre an Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are ot'ered.
As tor the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, not apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.

LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeurres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck

flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pommes (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75).
L'ORANGERIE
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep
shows and massage parlors on

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French
restaurant serving classical
haute cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and
everthing is expensive. Frugal
ity is anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole da Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
($14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and
the Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is
an excellent side dish. Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup)
is a superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and

Hsi-nan specializes in Szec

huan cookery, renowned for its
hot and spicy dishes, and the
spicing here is more distinct
and hotter than other
Szechuan-style restaurants in
the area. It is "the way the dis
hes should be prepared," says
the owner, but the hotness can
be altered to suit your taste.
The food is excellent, but the
prices are quite reasonable;
about $5 should do you nicely
unless you want to add beer.
The Chicken in Peking sauce
is a must for aficionados of hot
black bean sauce, and the Szec
huan shredded beef is a
"knockout" dish in generous
portion.

For those who enjoy excellent

The service is pleasant and at

LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estral
lita. Estrallita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humungous portions of qual
ity tare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super

hot sauce to the tamaies, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estral

of caution: it is difficult to man

great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced

with a choice of homemade

Sole Florentine, one of the

Perfectly cooked vegetables

accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal

544 Emerson
Palo Alto

Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, deVoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia Romagna
($5.20), we chose Linguine Von
gole to share.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two) and mushroom ($5).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from such
fish dishes as Sole Meuniere
($9.95) and Sole Florentine with
Shrimp ($10.50) to Chicken til
Forno Arturo ($8.25) and Steak

Just as the excellent cuisine

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feuillete
d'Huitre an Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are ot'ered.
As tor the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, not apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.

LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeurres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck

flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pommes (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75).
L'ORANGERIE
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep
shows and massage parlors on

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French
restaurant serving classical
haute cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and
everthing is expensive. Frugal
ity is anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole da Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
($14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and
the Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is
an excellent side dish. Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup)
is a superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52,
and with beverages, tax and tip,
it was almost $80 tor two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire tor men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
tor two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives
Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
L'OMELETTE
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direc
tion of owner-chef Louis Borel
as a fine French restaurant serv
ing excellent food in a friendly

and efficient manner.
Dinner at L'Omelette in
cludes soup du jour, salad,
fresh vegetable du jour and
potato or rice. Also available for
an extra charge are any of the 10
appetizers, onion soup
gratinee, a large array of de
sserts, a choice of beverages
and any selection from the
eight-page wine list.
Indecision when choos
ing a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the
regular offerings, which in
clude such diverse choices as
Paupiette de Sole Deauville
($9.75), fillet of sole with
creamed lobster sauce, mus
hrooms and shrimp, and Civet
de Lapm, Chasseur ($8.95), rab
bit, hunter's style, L'Omelette
serves a variety of house
specialties that change daily.
LA GUINGUETIE
593 Woodside Road
Redwood City
369-7364
The menu is typically French
and includes such dishes as ter
riiie (similar to pate), escargots,
frogs' legs and duck a I'orange
along with more familiar meat
dishes. However, the house
particularly prides itself on its

seafood, fresh daily, and on its
Southern (Provencal) French
cuisine, which requires genera
ous quantities of butter, tomato
and garlic. Provencal cuisine is
not grand; rather it is a particu
lar stvle of cuisine de famille (fam
ily cooking).
Most entrees are priced from
$8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highv
seasoned fish stew from Marse
ille) and veal in champagne
sauce ($ll each). All entrees in
clude the soup of the day, a
plain salad (with a good vinaig
rette dressing) and fresh veget
ables.
The surroundings are pleas
ant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh
flowers on each table. The at
mosphere is relaxed, and you
mav set vour own pace tor the
meal; the service, while not per
fect, is good-natured and unob
trusive.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed, Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative

to restaurants within a similar
price range (the Good Earth,
Mama Ney's and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
ot marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back tor more.
Salad is included in the price
of all dinner items (with no limit
on how many times you can go
back to refill vour plate), or can
be ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8, an exquisite
presentation ot red caviar,
whole artichoke, chilled
smoked salmon, and brie
cheese served with a split of
champagne.
Desserts are simple and re
flect a preference tor "the or
ganic."
Chinese and

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomer

ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Man
darine and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken and
the mustard sauce with which it
is served may not please every
American. This is not a poor re
flection on the kitchen, but
rather it means that American
tastes are not accustomed to all
the tastes of Chinese cooking.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the rnu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent

Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feuillete
d'Huitre an Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are ot'ered.
As tor the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, not apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.

LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeurres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck

flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pommes (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75).
L'ORANGERIE
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French
restaurant serving classical
haute cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and
everthing is expensive. Frugal
ity is anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole da Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
($14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and
the Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is
an excellent side dish. Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup)
is a superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52,
and with beverages, tax and tip,
it was almost $80 tor two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire tor men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
tor two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives
Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
L'OMELETTE
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direc
tion of owner-chef Louis Borel
as a fine French restaurant serv
ing excellent food in a friendly

and efficient manner.
Dinner at L'Omelette in
cludes soup du jour, salad,
fresh vegetable du jour and
potato or rice. Also available for
an extra charge are any of the 10
appetizers, onion soup
gratinee, a large array of de
sserts, a choice of beverages
and any selection from the
eight-page wine list.
Indecision when choos
ing a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the
regular offerings, which in
clude such diverse choices as
Paupiette de Sole Deauville
($9.75), fillet of sole with
creamed lobster sauce, mus
hrooms and shrimp, and Civet
de Lapm, Chasseur ($8.95), rab
bit, hunter's style, L'Omelette
serves a variety of house
specialties that change daily.
LA GUINGUETIE
593 Woodside Road
Redwood City
369-7364
The menu is typically French
and includes such dishes as ter
riiie (similar to pate), escargots,
frogs' legs and duck a I'orange
along with more familiar meat
dishes. However, the house
particularly prides itself on its

seafood, fresh daily, and on its
Southern (Provencal) French
cuisine, which requires genera
ous quantities of butter, tomato
and garlic. Provencal cuisine is
not grand; rather it is a particu
lar stvle of cuisine de famille (fam
ily cooking).
Most entrees are priced from
$8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highv
seasoned fish stew from Marse
ille) and veal in champagne
sauce ($ll each). All entrees in
clude the soup of the day, a
plain salad (with a good vinaig
rette dressing) and fresh veget
ables.
The surroundings are pleas
ant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh
flowers on each table. The at
mosphere is relaxed, and you
mav set vour own pace tor the
meal; the service, while not per
fect, is good-natured and unob
trusive.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed, Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative

to restaurants within a similar
price range (the Good Earth,
Mama Ney's and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
ot marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back tor more.
Salad is included in the price
of all dinner items (with no limit
on how many times you can go
back to refill vour plate), or can
be ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8, an exquisite
presentation ot red caviar,
whole artichoke, chilled
smoked salmon, and brie
cheese served with a split of
champagne.
Desserts are simple and re
flect a preference tor "the or
ganic."
Chinese and
Oriental
MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomer

ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Man
darine and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken and
the mustard sauce with which it
is served may not please every
American. This is not a poor re
flection on the kitchen, but
rather it means that American
tastes are not accustomed to all
the tastes of Chinese cooking.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the rnu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent

Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.
HSI-NAN
75 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
323-6550
Hsi-nan specializes in Szec

huan cookery, renowned for its
hot and spicy dishes, and the
spicing here is more distinct
and hotter than other
Szechuan-style restaurants in
the area. It is "the way the dis
hes should be prepared," says
the owner, but the hotness can
be altered to suit your taste.
The food is excellent, but the
prices are quite reasonable;
about $5 should do you nicely
unless you want to add beer.
The Chicken in Peking sauce
is a must for aficionados of hot
black bean sauce, and the Szec
huan shredded beef is a
"knockout" dish in generous
portion.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE
STAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great

people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
Eremiere Nguyenton Hoan, the
lekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never over
power the ingredients' own
character.
Noteable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
Perhaps one of the finest
traditions in the Stanford area,

Ming's offers surprisingly in
expensive meals in a pleasant
setting.
Set just off Highway 101 at
the end of Embarcadero Road,
Ming's offers a broad range of
Cantonese cuisine and has
done so since 1956.
The menu includes five basic
dinners, ranging in price from
$7.50 to $15, and supplements
these with numerous a la carte
o'fferings.
The atmosphere is pleasant
in the large dining rooms, and
service is prompt and attentive.
Reservations are advised, or
you can take your chances and
wait for your table in the bar,
where hot hors d'oeuvres are
served regularly along with
moderate quality drinks.
Mexican
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis
hes to please most anyone's
tastes.
Some of the house entrees
are particularly noteworthy.
Especially delightful is the La
Posada Tostada which is the
biggest tostada you've probably
ever seen. Do yourself a favor
and only order one. The second
will go to waste.

Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the
shopping center from 11:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estral
lita. Estrallita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humungous portions of qual
ity tare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super

hot sauce to the tamaies, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estral
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get bv easilv with
$4.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers,
and candlelight and wine. Not

that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandana
vian Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 tor one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal.
HUGO'S MARKET
Rickey's Hyatt House
Palo Alto
493-8000
One important thing to re
member about Hugo's Market,
go hungry!
In between, you can choose a
variety of entrees ranging from
the expected steaks, New York
(9 oz. $11.95,12 oz. $14.50) and
Filet Mignon ($14.95) to more
exotic seafood selections such
as Crabmeat Cannelloni Floren
tine ($10.25), pasta shells filled
with crabmeat and spinach.
Attentive, unobtrusive ser
vice continues from the mo
ment you walk in the door
through the free after-dinner
liquer. The wine includes a
good selection of California
wines complete with small
maps of the different wine reg
ions.
Extensive does not quite
cover the range of salad choices
included with the price of the
entree.
Conservative decor and at
tentive service mark Hugo's
Market.
AUGUSTO'S RESTAURANT
856 West El Camino Real
Mountain View
965-1869
At Augusto's Restaurant, the
initial impression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
characterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun."
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The bill

for two of us, less wine, but in
cluding one drink each, was
$40 Without the<? la carte salad,
and with less expensive de
ssert. that price would be closer
to $30.
The price of the entree (which
averages around $10 or $11) in
cludes a green salad or soup du
jour, and a side dish of vegeta
bles. -
In short, for the best in liaut
cuisine and/or the most formal of
eventngs go somewhere else
But for good European food, in
a triendiv. relaxed atmosphere,
Augusto's is a pleasant even
ing.-
MADDALENA'S CONTI

544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, deVoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia Romagna
($5.20), we chose Linguine Von
gole to share.
Maddalena's offers salads a la

mav set vour own pace tor the
meal; the service, while not per
fect, is good-natured and unob
trusive.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed, Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative

to restaurants within a similar
price range (the Good Earth,
Mama Ney's and Chef Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a seri
ous following. Here the display
ot marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming
back tor more.
Salad is included in the price
of all dinner items (with no limit
on how many times you can go
back to refill vour plate), or can
be ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight
entrees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8, an exquisite
presentation ot red caviar,
whole artichoke, chilled
smoked salmon, and brie
cheese served with a split of
champagne.
Desserts are simple and re
flect a preference tor "the or
ganic."
Chinese and
Oriental
MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomer

ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Cantonese, Man
darine and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Dishes such as the Salt Baked
Chicken show how Mui Kiang
does not make concessions to
western tastes. The chicken and
the mustard sauce with which it
is served may not please every
American. This is not a poor re
flection on the kitchen, but
rather it means that American
tastes are not accustomed to all
the tastes of Chinese cooking.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the rnu
shu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent

Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.
HSI-NAN
75 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
323-6550
Hsi-nan specializes in Szec

huan cookery, renowned for its
hot and spicy dishes, and the
spicing here is more distinct
and hotter than other
Szechuan-style restaurants in
the area. It is "the way the dis
hes should be prepared," says
the owner, but the hotness can
be altered to suit your taste.
The food is excellent, but the
prices are quite reasonable;
about $5 should do you nicely
unless you want to add beer.
The Chicken in Peking sauce
is a must for aficionados of hot
black bean sauce, and the Szec
huan shredded beef is a
"knockout" dish in generous
portion.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE
STAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great

people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
Eremiere Nguyenton Hoan, the
lekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never over
power the ingredients' own
character.
Noteable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
Perhaps one of the finest
traditions in the Stanford area,

Ming's offers surprisingly in
expensive meals in a pleasant
setting.
Set just off Highway 101 at
the end of Embarcadero Road,
Ming's offers a broad range of
Cantonese cuisine and has
done so since 1956.
The menu includes five basic
dinners, ranging in price from
$7.50 to $15, and supplements
these with numerous a la carte
o'fferings.
The atmosphere is pleasant
in the large dining rooms, and
service is prompt and attentive.
Reservations are advised, or
you can take your chances and
wait for your table in the bar,
where hot hors d'oeuvres are
served regularly along with
moderate quality drinks.
Mexican
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis
hes to please most anyone's
tastes.
Some of the house entrees
are particularly noteworthy.
Especially delightful is the La
Posada Tostada which is the
biggest tostada you've probably
ever seen. Do yourself a favor
and only order one. The second
will go to waste.

Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the
shopping center from 11:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estral
lita. Estrallita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrallita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humungous portions of qual
ity tare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super

hot sauce to the tamaies, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estral
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get bv easilv with
$4.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers,
and candlelight and wine. Not

that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandana
vian Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 tor one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal.
HUGO'S MARKET
Rickey's Hyatt House
Palo Alto
493-8000
One important thing to re
member about Hugo's Market,
go hungry!
In between, you can choose a
variety of entrees ranging from
the expected steaks, New York
(9 oz. $11.95,12 oz. $14.50) and
Filet Mignon ($14.95) to more
exotic seafood selections such
as Crabmeat Cannelloni Floren
tine ($10.25), pasta shells filled
with crabmeat and spinach.
Attentive, unobtrusive ser
vice continues from the mo
ment you walk in the door
through the free after-dinner
liquer. The wine includes a
good selection of California
wines complete with small
maps of the different wine reg
ions.
Extensive does not quite
cover the range of salad choices
included with the price of the
entree.
Conservative decor and at
tentive service mark Hugo's
Market.
AUGUSTO'S RESTAURANT
856 West El Camino Real
Mountain View
965-1869
At Augusto's Restaurant, the
initial impression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
characterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun."
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The bill

for two of us, less wine, but in
cluding one drink each, was
$40 Without the<? la carte salad,
and with less expensive de
ssert. that price would be closer
to $30.
The price of the entree (which
averages around $10 or $11) in
cludes a green salad or soup du
jour, and a side dish of vegeta
bles. -
In short, for the best in liaut
cuisine and/or the most formal of
eventngs go somewhere else
But for good European food, in
a triendiv. relaxed atmosphere,
Augusto's is a pleasant even
ing.-
MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, deVoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia Romagna
($5.20), we chose Linguine Von
gole to share.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two) and mushroom ($5).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from such
fish dishes as Sole Meuniere
($9.95) and Sole Florentine with
Shrimp ($10.50) to Chicken til
Forno Arturo ($8.25) and Steak
Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena s decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifulh
painted screens and chan
deliers.
