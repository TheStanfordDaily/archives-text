LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feuillete
d'Huitre an Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are ot'ered.
As tor the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, not apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.

LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors
d'oeurres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck

flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarte aux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pommes (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75).
L'ORANGERIE
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep
shows and massage parlors on

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French
restaurant serving classical
haute cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and
everthing is expensive. Frugal
ity is anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole da Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
($14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and
the Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is
an excellent side dish. Potage
Parisien (potato and leek soup)
is a superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up
to the Souffle Grand Marnier or
the Souffle aux Framboises ($5)

which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52,
and with beverages, tax and tip,
it was almost $80 tor two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
