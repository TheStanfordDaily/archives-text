# Andrew Young: a hard-talking ambassador
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
To most people, Andrew
Young is just .mother
member ol the Georgia mafia,
one of President Jimmy Carter's
political appointees. Young's
reputation in popular circles is
of a small man in a big world, a
man who on the surface may. do
well in his job as Ambassador to
the United Nations, but who
regularly "shoots his mouth
off" on foreign policy issues,
doing more to embarrass the
United States than anything
else.
But to those who know An
drew Young beyond the banner
headlines proclaiming his "gaf
fes," Young is an intelligent, ar
ticulate and hard-working
man, who has dedicated his life
to serving fellow blacks. First as
a Unitarian minister in
Thomasville, Ga., then as aide
to Martin Luther King, Jr., later
as a congressman from Geor
gia, and now as ambassador.
What he says sometimes ap
pears foolish when taken out of
context, but given a chance to
explain himself, Young appears
to know what he is talking
about and has good ideas on
how to solve the problems his
job involves.
In short, to those who don't
know, Young speaks foolishly.
To those who know, Young
speaks bluntly and with pur
pose.
Which is good for a man
about to address the graduating
class of this University. Young
was the first choice of the Class
ot '79, agreeing within one
week to speak at commence
ment.
A capacity crowd of more
than 13,000 is expected to hear
Young at the 88th annual com
mencement exercises Sunday
morning.
According to Senior Class
President Leslie Crozier,
reaction from the class has been
mixed, but mostly good.
The administration, she said,
has indicated no displeasure
with Young, though there were
some letters to the Alumni As
sociation questioning the
choice.
But Young is not unfamiliar
with controversy. As Martin
Luther King's aide, he helped

organize and lead the civil
rights movement in the '60s.
This is perhaps whv Young
does so well with the African
nations. They can identify with
him, and he understands their
problems.
Since his appointment in
1977, Ambassador Young has
devoted most of his energies to
combating apartheid and help
ing young nations in Africa.
And his strategies are practical.
Dealing with new nations,
for example, Young has no
blind fear of communism. He
figures that new governments
will seek assistance from the
more competent big power, not
theone with the right ideology.
"The force with the most ap
peal in the underdeveloped
world is not any ideology —
communist or capitalist — but
competence," he said.
Young advocates lining up
with the most competent and
intelligent forces in new coun
tries, rather than seeking to
support those with more "cor
rect" ideologies.
"For years, I've seen my
country back losers because it
likes puppets it can control.
We've had a long string of
them. I think it's much more in
our interests to work with the
most intelligent, energetic and
effective leadership we can
find," he said.
New governments, he says,
become Marxist only because
their fledgling governments,
showing socialistic tendencies,
are rejected by the United
States. That leaves them no al
ternative but the Soviet Union.
' ' T don't have any particular
-Lsympathy for Marxist
governments," Young says,
"but I do have sympathy for
liberation movements and
newly independent govern
ments. In 1975, the representa
tive of the Neto government in
Angola came to me as a con
gressman and said, 'Please
don't do to us what you did to
Cuba. Don't force us to be to
tally dependent on the Rus
sians.' "
As Young has pointed out, it
is hard to see what we as a na
tion have gained by ignoring
Castro's Cuba for the past 20

years.
And as for his "foot-in
mouth" statements, which
taken by themselves appear
ill-considered, give Young a
chance to explain and he will
show that he does think prob
lems through and does have
sound logical reasons for what
he has to say.
For example, he recently said
"Cuba is doing in Africa what
we should be doing."
A perfect example. But wait.
"What the Cubans are doing
right," Young said, "is provid
ing the Africans with technical
help. They're giving them ag
ricultural assistance. They're
sending doctors and teachers
and training people to run fish
ing fleets. They're supplying
the kind of basic support that
African nations so desperately
need. We could be doing that.
I'm not talking about sending
troops. I think we can win
places like Angola and Mozam
bique away from the Russians if
we give them some simple, in
expensive economic help."
To a lot of people, that makes
sense.
