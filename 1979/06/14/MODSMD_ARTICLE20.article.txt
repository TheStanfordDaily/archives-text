So now that you're here, and now that you've gotten to
know Stanford and now that you've gone out and checked
out all the restaurants and bars and discos around here,
you re probably wondering what to do next.
Ever thought of being a reporter?
You're probably saying "Who, me?" Well, yeah, you. If
you know how to write and ask questions, and can imagine
yourself doing it in the company of other budding jour
nalists, why not give The Stanford Daily a try?
It can be a lot of fun. We may not all be Steinbecks, but at
least there's the possibility. Steinbeck used to write for the
Daily. So who knows?
And you will probably enjoy it, too. We only publish
twice a week during the summer so that means two things
important to beginning journalists. Deadlines aren't that
deadly, and there's a lot more time for editors to sit down
with you and work on basics or fine-tuning your writing
and reporting.
And there are all kinds of opportunities. If you like news,
there are all kinds of investigative and spot news reporting
stories just waiting to be written. You can help cover the
negotiations between the University and United Stanford
Employees. You can investigate the new air conditioning
system in Meyer Library (some people say it's even hotter
than it used to be).
And if you liked those restaurants, and would like to see
more of them, you can write reviews.
And if news, sports and entertainment don't excite you,
how about features? There are stories out there just dvint* to
be written. J "
We even have opportunities for those not typewriter
inclined. For you camera buffs out there, we have our own
lab here and plenty of pictures to take. Break into the world
of photojournalism.
So come on in to the Daily offices and ask for Brad or Mark.
We II point you to the right department, give you a tour of
the place, and get you settled in. Think about it. It's a good
experience, and it's fun besides.
