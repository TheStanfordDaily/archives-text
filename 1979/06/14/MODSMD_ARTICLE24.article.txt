Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity was founded out of a
very simple but intense love
and memory of a mother and
father for their son, but its ide
als were so broad as to include
the education of all children
and the desire to teach people
to do something useful with
their lives.
Leland Stanford was born in
1824 in Waterliet, New York.
He never received the univer
sity education that was to mean
so much to him forothers in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later appren
ticed himself to a law firm in
Albany. He was admitted to the
New York and Wisconsin bars.
His future wife, Jane Lat
hrop, was born in Albany, New
York, in 1828. She was the
daughter of moderately well
to-do parents, and received the
normal private school educa
tion that was fitting for girls of
her day.
The Stanfords were married
in 1850. In 1852, Leland went
alone to San Francisco to begin
his business ventures. Jane
stayed behind in New York
until 1853 to care for her ailing

father, to whom she was very
close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then mewed to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until a tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a
new life they moved to Sac
ramento via Nicaragua in 1856;
Leland's father had told them
that California was the place to
be.
In Sacramento, Leland
purchased his brothers' store,
and then began his political life.
In 1856, he helped to organize
Sacramento's Republican
party. Four years later, he was
chosen as a delegate to the
Chicago convention, where he
supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1861 as governor
of California. As former Stan
ford student, and later presi
dent, Ray Lyman Wilbur wrote
in his memoirs, "as governor of
California he had led in the bat
tle to keep California in the
Union against those who
wanted it to follow the South or
to set it up as a separate repub
lic." In 1905, he was to be
elected to the United States Se
nate.

Stanford museum docent
and chairman of the Stanford
Familv Portfolio Peg Haneberg
says that Leland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the stand
ing armies of Europe were a
waste of time and manpower,"
she says."He believed that dis
putes should be settled by arbit
ration."
The same year, 1863, Stan
ford and three other men
formed the Central Pacific Rail
road. of which he later was

elected president. Later, a
series of complicated mergers
consolidated several railroads
into the Central Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at the University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized
by some historians as a robber
barron," he adds. "If he was
really so despicable he

wouldn't have been liked so
much by his employees."
At first the railroad was con
sidered to be a risky financial
venture, but it later proved to
be a most lucrative investment,
as it was later to help support
the University. To celebrate the
first transcontinental line, Le
land drove a golden spike in a
ceremony in Promontory,
Utah, in 1869.
Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some mea
sure of play. In 1870 he bought

his first race horse, named Oc
cident. He later bred, trained,
and raced horses very success
fully; one year his horse won a
world's record. When the horse
died, Kentucky racers were re-
I ieved.
An investment in the
California Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but

only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete, and, in spite of the
low five-cent fare for riding the
cable cars, the stock eventually
made him an even wealthier
man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881, he bought
a vineyard in Vina, Ca., and
tried to make table wine. Ac
cording to Haneberg, he in
vested a lot of money in wine
and made good brandy, but
never got good table wine.
'Farmer at heart'
Hansen says that Stanford
was a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
"He was a pioneer of viticul
ture," he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina
were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France tor champagne,
but they failed and became
brandy. His Weidel Winery at
Mission San Jose still produces
