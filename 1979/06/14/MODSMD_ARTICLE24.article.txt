### 
Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity was founded out of a
very simple but intense love
and memory of a mother and
father for their son, but its ide
als were so broad as to include
the education of all children
and the desire to teach people
to do something useful with
their lives.
Leland Stanford was born in
1824 in Waterliet, New York.
He never received the univer
sity education that was to mean
so much to him forothers in the
founding of his university. In
stead, he was educated at coun
try schools and later appren
ticed himself to a law firm in
Albany. He was admitted to the
New York and Wisconsin bars.
His future wife, Jane Lat
hrop, was born in Albany, New
York, in 1828. She was the
daughter of moderately well
to-do parents, and received the
normal private school educa
tion that was fitting for girls of
her day.
The Stanfords were married
in 1850. In 1852, Leland went
alone to San Francisco to begin
his business ventures. Jane
stayed behind in New York
until 1853 to care for her ailing

father, to whom she was very
close.
Settled in California
The Stanfords then mewed to
Wisconsin, where they lived
until a tragic fire destroyed Le
land's law library. To start a
new life they moved to Sac
ramento via Nicaragua in 1856;
Leland's father had told them
that California was the place to
be.
In Sacramento, Leland
purchased his brothers' store,
and then began his political life.
In 1856, he helped to organize
Sacramento's Republican
party. Four years later, he was
chosen as a delegate to the
Chicago convention, where he
supported Lincoln.
Stanford gradually became
more of a political influence with
his election in 1861 as governor
of California. As former Stan
ford student, and later presi
dent, Ray Lyman Wilbur wrote
in his memoirs, "as governor of
California he had led in the bat
tle to keep California in the
Union against those who
wanted it to follow the South or
to set it up as a separate repub
lic." In 1905, he was to be
elected to the United States Se
nate.

Stanford museum docent
and chairman of the Stanford
Familv Portfolio Peg Haneberg
says that Leland was a pacifist.
Arbitrator
"He believed that the stand
ing armies of Europe were a
waste of time and manpower,"
she says."He believed that dis
putes should be settled by arbit
ration."
The same year, 1863, Stan
ford and three other men
formed the Central Pacific Rail
road. of which he later was

elected president. Later, a
series of complicated mergers
consolidated several railroads
into the Central Pacific System.
Ralph Hansen, chief librarian
at the University libraries, says
that Leland and his three as
sociates were known as the "big
four."
"He has been characterized
by some historians as a robber
barron," he adds. "If he was
really so despicable he

wouldn't have been liked so
much by his employees."
At first the railroad was con
sidered to be a risky financial
venture, but it later proved to
be a most lucrative investment,
as it was later to help support
the University. To celebrate the
first transcontinental line, Le
land drove a golden spike in a
ceremony in Promontory,
Utah, in 1869.
Stanford's business adven
tures allowed him some mea
sure of play. In 1870 he bought

his first race horse, named Oc
cident. He later bred, trained,
and raced horses very success
fully; one year his horse won a
world's record. When the horse
died, Kentucky racers were re-
I ieved.
An investment in the
California Street Cable Railroad
Franchise made Stanford an
even wealthier man. He tried to
talk his influential friends into
investing in the company, but

only a few were willing to take
the chance; he bought most of
the shares himself.
The cable was completed in
1877. Because Stanford never
did anything halfway, the cable
was made the best in the world
by a new method of molding
concrete, and, in spite of the
low five-cent fare for riding the
cable cars, the stock eventually
made him an even wealthier
man.
Stanford wasn't successful at
everything. In 1881, he bought
a vineyard in Vina, Ca., and
tried to make table wine. Ac
cording to Haneberg, he in
vested a lot of money in wine
and made good brandy, but
never got good table wine.
'Farmer at heart'
Hansen says that Stanford
was a "farmer at heart," and
made his first money by selling
crops he grew himself.
"He was a pioneer of viticul
ture," he continues. "The
reasons for his failure at Vina
were soil problems." Stanford
planted 3000 acres of grapes
from France tor champagne,
but they failed and became
brandy. His Weidel Winery at
Mission San Jose still produces
successfully.
Jane had meanwhile made
her husband her career, and the
two were very close. Because of
her husband's many personal
and business interests, she
knew many famous people,
traveled widely, and lived well.
1 lansen says that "Jane's out
standing characteristic was that
she was deeply religious. Her
life centered in her belief in im
mortality and Jesus Christ."
Jane supported Catholic
charities, but neither she nor
Leland belonged to any particu
lar church.
Charitable
"She was charitable, but she
didn't toot her horn about it,"
1 lansen continues. "She estab
lished kindergarten in Menlo
Park and San Francisco."
In his memoirs, Wilbur de
scribes Jane as "never a beauti
ful woman — some thought she
resembled Queen Victoria in
general appearance, which
rather pleased her. She had a
commanding presence and
friendly dignity which only a
great heart, courage and strong
convictions and character can
give."
Up until their 18th year of
marriage, the Stan fords re
mained childless. Finally, in
1868 in Sacramento, Leland Jr.
was born. Jane was 40 at the
time of his birth; according to
Stanford Art Museum docent
Glenda Northway, he was her
"precious jewel."
Leland Jr. had everything a
child could want. He was taken

. . . any place good for raising race horses ought
to be good for students.

on trips abroad, was educated
by the best tutors. For a while
he attended Heald Business
College in San Francisco.
Unspoiled
Yet Haneberg says that he
wasn't spoiled; research has it
that as a child his uncle bought
him a pair of boots he had been
longing for. He loved the boots,
and slept in them the first night.
The next day, he saw a poor boy
who had no shoes, so Leland Jr.
gave him his boots.
Hansen says that Leland Jr.,
was very intelligent, had a good
sense of humor and enjoyed
playing boyish pranks. Yet "he
was brought up to be aware of
the responsibilities that wealth
brought."
In his memoirs, Wilbur
writes that Leland and Jane had
a "happy and dignified home
life" and trained their son in a
"sensible and careful way • • .
for responsibility that he would
handle wisely and well their

vast fortune which they
thought would become his. . ."
The joys of parentood were
not long to last for Leland and
Jane. While the family was vac
ationing in Istanbul, Leland Jr.
contracted typhoid fever. He
got worse in Naples and Rome,
and in 1884 died in Florence. I le
was 16.
Tremendous blow
The Stanfords had been very
close; the loss of an onlv child
was a tremendous blow.
In his father's dreams, it is
said that Leland Jr. appeared
and said, "live for humanity."
When he awoke, Leland said,
"California's children shall be
my children." Thus Leland
founded Leland Stanford
Junior University.
Jane, as a memorial to her
son, established the Leland
Stanford Junior Museum,
Museums were her son's pas
sion and lifelong dream; the fall
he was 16, he had planned to
enter Harvard and study
courses pertaining to the run
ning of a museum.
Cornerstone laid
The cornerstone for the new
University was laid on May 14
in 1887 — it would have been
Leland Jr.'s 19th birthday. In a
copper box in the cornerstone,
the Stanfords placed, among
other documents pertaining to
the organization of the Univer
sity, a photograph of their son.
The University was to open
four years later.
According to Wilbur, Sen.
Stanford had no trouble choos
ing the site for his University.

Although the Stanfords had
various houses, Palo Alto was
home, so he chose his Palo Alto
farm.
"The Senator's opinion,"
writes Wilbur, "was that any
place that was good for raising
race horses ought to be good for
students."
Wilbur continues, "I particu
larly liked Mr. Stanford's idea
of what education should be,
that it should be for 'direct use
fulness in life.' He wanted it to
break away from the tradition
bound classical and philosophi
cal programs of some of the
older eastern institutions, and
to develop along the more prac
tical and scientific lines in
which Cornell University, the
Johns Hopkins University and
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology were pioneering.
Jordan first president
"He wanted for president of
the new Western institution a
man of courage and initiative,

scientifically trained, who
could "see and try new ways of
doing things. Such a man he
found in David Starr Jordan."
Wilbur, who entered Stan
ford in 1892, wrote of his early
impressions of the physical ex
pansiveness and vastness of the
University. "We came along El
Camino Real, then a narrow
dirt road. . . We swung up to
the University buildings, which
were then only what we call
now the Inner Quadrangle
(Memorial Church had not yet
been built).
"With the buff sandstone
wall, red-tiled roofs, and long
sandstone arcades they were
delightfully different from any
educational buildings we had
ever seen."
Unlike many universities,
from the beginning Stanford
was coed. Women were housed
in Roble 1 fall; the men in Encina
Hall. Hansen says that Encina
has been "slowly remodeled"
and now houses offices, the
Economics Department and the
Food Research Institute.
Women 'favored'
Jane was not particularly
pleased that women were ac
cepted at Stanford, Hanberg
says that Leland "favored"
women. But Jane went along
with her husband's wishes, and
in spite of her misgivings,
women were respected and
given equal rights.
To welcome the women, Jane
gave tea parties at their Palo
Alto home, the site of the pre
sent Children's Hospital.
Hansen explains that "the
founding grant doesn't prohibit
women; in 1899, women began
to increase. Jane became con
cerned that more women than
men would attend the Univer
sity that had been dedicated to
her son."
He adds that a clause to the
founding grant prohibited
more than 500 women. "Up
until the early '30s, they were
known as the "Stanford 500.' It
was later rescinded by the trus
tees."
No tuition
In the early days there was no
tuition; Leland believed that all
his "children" should be enti
tled to an education. Students
were responsible for paying
their own miscellaneous ex
penses, and the University
charged $4 .50 weekly for room
and board.
Wilbur wrote that in his first
year at Stanford, one of those
miscellaneous expenses was
laundry. A "quiet, friendly
chap" came to Wilbur's room at
Encina and asked if Wilbur
wanted to send his laundry to a
"San Jore company of which he
was the Stanford agent. He
promptly got my limited busi
ness." The quiet, friendly chap
was Herbert Hoover.

Stanford suffered the usual
growing pains that any new
educational institution could be
expected to encounter. Wilbur
writes that "not only was the
university undergoing organi
zation, with educational pro
cesses in debate at practically
every meeting of the faculty,
but the students themselves
were likewise developing their
own organizations, their athle
tic teams, their debating, liter
ary and musical societies and
fraternities. . .
"A good many. . .new tradi
tions evaporated with one trial,
some lasted a little longer, a few
became a lasting part of Stan
ford life. With the trial and error
method there developed good
leadership and some rather un
i'lue and appropriate cus
toms. . . Wo were starting from
the very beginning."
Stanford's death
In spite of its growing pains,
the University continued
smoothly enough for two years.
But the young University was
devastated by the death of its
founder in 1893.
There was some question if
the Univeisity could survive fi
nancially after Leland's death.
The estate was tied up in court
for some time. Jane, who had a
massive jewelry collection sec
ond only to the queen of Eng
land, established the Jewel
Fund, the money of which was
used to pay for salaries and
books.
Hansen says that because of
Jane's firm, single-minded de
termination to do what she
wanted, she "plunged full
speed ahead" to save the Uni
versity.
"When Leland died, the
lawyers advised her to close the
University," Hansen says.
"She refused, saying, if the

school closed down I would
have nothing to live for.' The
University became her son;
every energy and dollar mus
tered went to the University. It
was part of her Christian zeal.
In 1905, Jane died.
There was much confusion as
to the cause of her death. Wil
bur and Haneberg concur that
death was caused by a heart at
tack. Rumors at the time had it
that she was poisoned with
strychnine by a maid .
Another shock was to come
to the University, this time in
the form of the massive 1906
earthquake. The new Outer
Quad, much of the museum,
the library, the gym, arches and
Jane's beloved, recently-built
Memorial Church were badly
damaged. The statue of
biologist Agassiz, located in
front of Jordan Hall, fell head
first into the pavement. A stu
dent and fireman were killed.
Wilbur wrote that the Uni
versity was relieved that Jane
wasn't alive to see the damage,
as that in itself would have kil
led her. "It was just a case of
starting all over again.
"Starting all over again"
meant immediately beginning
restoration of the damaged
buildings. Wilbur writes that
President Jordan issued a
statement saying that "the ac
tual needs of the growing Uni
versity" would be first consi
dered. "No backward" steps
were taken in repairs, nor were
faculty numbers reduced.
President Jordan, Wilbur
writes, "drew some
philosophical lessons from the
earthquake, commenting that
"forever man must rise above
his own creations.' " The
young university soon fully re
covered.
