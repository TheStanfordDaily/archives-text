# More than just a tower
## Hoover Institution houses researchers, carilloneur 
### 
Everyone knows that once
you have become an alumnus,
the institution which graduated
you immediately starts to solicit
funds from you and does not
stop until you do. Under this
kind of constant duress,
everyone eventually gives a lit
tle something. Some even vol
unteer money — perhaps as a
tax dodge. Herbert Hoover was
a rare exception.
Not only did Hoover offer
money, he also offered ideas —
such as founding the Food Re
search Institute and encourag
ing the development of a busi
ness school.
Probably his greatest con
tribution to Stanford was the
creation of one of the world's
most complete collections of in
formation on 20th century wars
and revolution.
The Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace is a
majorcenter foradvanced scho
larship in political science, his
tory, economics and interna
tional law.
As student guides in the
tower point out to visitors, the
institution has the third largest
archives in the nation — the
largest private archives.
It contains over 1,250,000
volumes, including govern
ment documents, as well as
3000 archive units, which are
private collections of papers,
letters, memos, pamphlets,
diaries and other documents.
Subscriptions to newspapers

and periodicals have resulted in
more than 30,000 titles being on
file.
Investigate opportunities
What all these numbers sig
nify to a scholar is the possibil
ity to thoroughly investigate a
subject — whether it be an in
tensive study of a particular
country, war, or revolution, or
a broad, comparative look at a
political or historical phenome
non. The institution has pub
lished 275 volumes since 1919
when Hoover founded it.
Examples of recent publica
tions are: "The Stalinist Terror
in the Thirties," "The North
Korean Economy," "Truman,
the Jewish Vote, and the Crea
tion of Israel," "Yearbook on
International Communist Af
fairs: 1973 (seventh in a series)"
and "A Chinese-English Dic
tionary of Communist Chinese
Terminology."
As American Relief Ad
ministration Director in Europe
during World War I, Hoover
began his collection with the
help of Stanford professors Ep
hraim Adams and Ralph Lutz.
He hoped that the materials
they gathered would provide
the data with which future his
torians could work. Lutz be
came the institution's director
in 1925.
Until 1939, the collected
materials were stored in various
places on campus — many in
the main library. The library
was not really prepared to store

the masses of documents the
collecting team sent back at the
end of the war.
Recognizing the need for a
separate building, the founders
set about raising money. By
1939, they were ready to start
the tower, which was dedicated
in 1941.
285-foot tower
The 285-foot tower holds the
library and main archives —
there are 17 levels of stacks — as
well as administrative and re
search offices, two rea'ding
rooms, two display rooms of
Hoover memorabilia and a 35-
bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Bel
gium for the 1939-40 World's
Fair and were later donated to
Hoover by the Belgian Ameri
can Educational Foundation.
Hoover gave them to the in
stitution, which placed them on
top of the tower.

fessor james Angell plays the
carillon occasionally in the
evening during the summer.
'Angell's music'
As "Angell's music" de
scends from the heights above,
Hoover staffers are constantly
seeking new items for all their
collections. Although the in
stitution began as a vehicle to
study World War I, Hoover's
statement of purpose that it
"promote peace" throughout
the world led to its expansion
and constant acquisitions.

The Soviet and Chinese col
lections are especially large.
Hoover particularly encour
aged three areas of interest
which are still pursued today:
domestic problems, interna
tional studies and scholarship
fellowships.
The library is divided into re
gional and special collections:
Africa, East Asia, Eastern
Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the
British Labor Collection, the
Nicolaevskv Collection and the
New Left Collection.
That same call for the promo
tion of peace has led to the in
stitution's striving to serve as a
dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest
solutions and uncover trends in
the world through its research
and publications.
As well as employing a staff
of permanent researchers and
archivists, the institution
makes its holdings available to
Stanford students and faculty
and all other scholars.
Recently a fellows program
has been established in three
areas: public affairs, peace and
national affairs.
The fellowships are given to
selected applicants and allow
them to spend time "in unre

stricted and creative work."
Peace fellows
The projects of the three
peace fellows must investigate
"the phenomena of peace," the
fellowship founders decreed.
Public affairs fellowships are
designed to train about three
people a year to work for legis
lators and national adminis
trators.
The institution was blessed
from the very beginning with
more money than a comparable
public archives might find.
Hoover was always t>n hand to
provide funds, and in 1922 he
gave 5200,000 through the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. *
Endowment and reserve
funds are now over
512,000,000. Gifts to the institu
tion have risen to over
$2,000,000 a year. In 1971,
alumnus David Packard (co
founder of Hewlett-Packard)
gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now consi
dered an independent body
within the University, not just
its stepchild in the backroom.
The stacks, which lurk mys
teriously in the middle floors of
the building, are open only to
the eves of the librarians and
archivists.
