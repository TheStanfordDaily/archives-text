# Getting around â€“ tips for novice navigators
## 
### 
Taking the wrong path and
getting lost in the forest cer
tainly ranks among mankind's
most enduring fears. In the Bay
Area, the paths may take the
form of 12 lane highways, the
wolves tandem trailer trucks
and the swamps stretches of in
terminably red traffic lights, but
the troubles of getting around
are no less bothersome here
than they are in the Amazon
basin and the Siberian steppes.
Maps, of course, were in
vented to take the guesswork
out of traveling from A to B. But
it A happens to be the Stanford
campus and B happens to be
anywhere farther afield than
downtown Palo Alto, a map
does almost more harm than
good to the inexperienced
traveler. Should he follow that
heavy red line which looks as if
it ought to be a major
thoroughfare? Or is it in fact a
traffic-snarled thicket of stop
lights, stop signs and left tur
ners? Or, foregoing the use of
his car, should he ride the bus
which follows the route marked
out in blue, or maybe see if he
could take a train?
The first thing to bear in mind
is that local topography plays a
large part in determining the di
rection and nature of the lines
of transportation. The Bay to
the east and the hills to the west
accentuate the peninsularity of
San Francisco and environs.
The towns and cities between
San Francisco and San Jose can
be thought of as pearls (or more
aptly, beans) on a multi
stranded necklace. The two
main strands are the Bavshore
Freeway (Highway 101), which
can be considered the eastern
border of Peninsula civilization,
and Interstate 280 which is the

western border. In between run
several minor strands, tor grea
ter or lesser stretches between
the two ends. The most impor
tant of these are El Camino Real
(Highway 82), with which
everyone soon becomes famil
iar, although few realize how
remarkably uniform it is over its
entire 50 mile length, and
Alameda de las Pulgas (known
to the south as Foothill Ex
pressway) which ranges from
residential to rural and con
sequently is much easier and
faster going than El Camino.
Which north-south route to
take is best determined accord
ing to the length of the trip. If
the destination is not a great
distance, El Camino is satisfac
tory; if it is several miles, the
Alameda starts to become more
worthwhile; and if it is further,
one of the freeways is the only
reasonable choice.
Carless
For the carless, the San
Mateo County Transit District
operates bus service between
various points in Palo Alto, in
cluding a pair on or near cam
pus, and destinations along El
Camino to the north all the way
to San Francisco.
Which of the two freeways to
take to San Francisco is the sub
ject of an ongoing controversy.
Longtime local residents tend
to line up behind 101. They
claim it is faster than 280. On
the other hand, 280 (officially
named the Junipero Serra
Freeway, after the Spanish
monk who first explored this
part of California) is designated
"the world's most beautiful
freeway." Whether this title is
deserved or not is a matter of
personal taste, but 280 is indis
putably the pleasanter of the

two roads; it is newer, wider,
smoother, and much more rural
than its bay-side counterpart. It
is also easier to reach from cam
pus: it has access ramps off
Page Mill, Alpine and Sand I lill
Roads. The Bay shore, in con
trast, is separated from the
University by a forbidding
sequence of traffic hindrances
regardless of which approach is
attempted.
It is not, however, necessary
to have a car to get to the City.
The Southern Pacific Railroad
runs daily from Palo Alto to San
Francisco. The ride is comforta
ble and the depot is located just
off campus near the El
Camino-University Avenue
overpass.
BART
One ingenious and little
known alternative route is to
take the Peerless Stage bus ser
vice from the Palo Alto
Greyhound Terminal (on Alma
Street) over the Dumbarton
Bridge to Fremont and take

BART (acronymic for Bay Area
Rapid Transit). The route is
partly above ground, partly
subterranean, and goes
through Oakland, most of the
popular destinations in San
Francisco and winds up in Dalv
City.
The problem with going car
less is getting around the City.
But as it turns out, this is more
easily done than said. In addi
tion to BART, San Francisco has
its famous cable cars and a full
complement of public buses.
While not recommended tor
scantily clad young beauties of
either sex, the public transpor
tation is fairly safe and quick
and not really all that unbeara
ble.
The possibilities foreast-west
travel are more limited. High
way K4 crosses the Dumbarton
Bridge from the East Bay and
runs all the way to the Pacific
coast via Redwood City, Wood

side and La Honda. Highway
92 crosses the San Mateo Bridge
and passes through San Mateo
on its way to Half Moon Bay.
Both these roads become nar
row country lanes when they
climb into the hills to the west.
To escape this area al
together, there are five main
routes. To the north, the best
choice is Highway 101, which is
also the preferred route south.
(The exception to this rule is
when the destination is Santa
Cruz and vicinity, in which case
Highway 17, the major north
south route of the East Bay
which intersects 280 in San
Jose, is regrettably but unav
oidably the way to go.) To Sac
ramento and points north or
east, the Bay Bridge and In
terstate 80 is the accepted route.
Points south or west can best be
reached by the improbably
Highway 152. This branches off
101 in Gilroy about 25 miles
south of San Jose.
