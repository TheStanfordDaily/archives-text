# Bay Area has a lot to offer
## 
### 
There is a lot to be said for Son Francisco, but
no speech on the sights of the Bay Area should
stop there. The last word has not been spoken
until the names of such localities as Sausalito and
Tiburon, Mount Tamalpais and Point Reyes,
Berkeley and Santa Cruz have been mentioned.
Water is the most significant geographical fea
ture of the Bay Area. It plays a crucial role in
determining the character of San Francisco and
environs. Its efficacy as a physical barrier can be
judged bv comparing San Francisco and Marin
counties: separated by the relatively modest 1000
yard expanse of the Golden Gate, the City packs
14,000 people in every square mile, while Marin
appears to consist of row upon row of apparently
lifeless hills.
But Marin is by no means without attractions.
The oppulent homes of Sausalito and Tiburon,
for example, are a spectacle. (The per capita in
come of the latter community is in the top 10 of
the country.)
Prison
Just to the north of Tiburon's carefully
groomed peninsula the monolithic walls of San
Quentin State Penitentiary can be seen. It isn't so
convenient to the City, perhaps, but the guard
towers command a fine view of the Bay.
To gain access to Marin's Pacific coastline, it is
necessary to take one of the climbing, winding
roads out of Mil! Valley. After ascending the
steep slopes of Mount Tamalpais (pronounced
tam-al-PIE-as), these routes eventually join
Highway 1, the coast road.
Separated from Marin only by <he five mile
expanse of the Bay, the group of cities collectively
known as the East Bay seem to be a world apart.
The mood of the area, set in large part of Oak
land, is more business-like than that of San Fran
cisco, and, perhaps because of the chronic fog,

everything seems grayer.
Berkeley is a notable exception, however. The
city itself reminds some people of the well
known college towns of the East Coast such as
Cambridge and New Haven.
The University of California campus in Ber
keley has attractions of its own. Vestiges of the air
of protest and radicalism, of long hair and drugs
still survive in the outdoor life of street vendors
and performers at the student center. Behind the
academic and residential buildings, the natural
beauty of the foothills is preserved in Tilden and
Wildcat Regional Parks.
Napa Valley
About an hour's drive to the northwest from
San Francisco is California's premium wine
country, the Napa Valley. The terrain itself is not
dramatic, composed chiefly of dry, gently, rol
ling hills, .met the town of has never in
spired lyric descriptions. The wine, however,
speaks for itself and has no need to apologize to
anyone. The most difficult part of a tasting tour is
the drive home afterwards.
Other bays
San Francisco's may be the biggest, but it is not
the only bay in the Bay Area. Two bays to the
south have given rise to several seaside towns ot
picturesque character.
Half Moon Bay, located on the coastal indenta
tion of the same name, is most noted for its sea
food restaurants and busy harbor.
Santa Cruz is stationed at the northern limit of
Monterey Bay. Considered at one time a retire
ment community, the summer resort was trans
formed bv the establishment of a University ot
California campus there in 1960. Santa Cruz is
best known for its (relatively) warm-water
beaches and its roller coaster.
