# Hanna House is local landmark
## 
### Catherine Saar 
When Frank Lloyd Wright
patterned Hanna House after a
bee's honeycomb, he was try
ing to "break open the box" of
conventional square and re
ctilinear buildings.
From the outside, the "Hon
eycomb House" fits naturally
into a knoll at 737 Frenchman's
Road on the Stanford Campus.
It only hints at the architectural
masterpiece it really is.
Former provost William Mil
ler calls it a piece of sculpture.
It'salsoa "terrificsetting foren
tertaining," he says.
Built in 1937, Hanna House
commands a view of the cam
pus and the foothills. Accord
ing to Miller, fog, moonlight or
the changing seasons change
the character a nd appearance of
the house.
Once inside, however, the
complexity and the beauty of a
home that effectively brings the
outside indoors, is inescapable.
Its redwood floors , natural and
indirect lighting, and its cascad
ing fountain of stairs, help to
make the house "a total con
cept."
The hexagon, a commonly
occuring shape in nature, sub
tley characterizes every ele
ment of the house. One of the
sides of a hexagon is the unit of
which all dimensions of the

house are multiples. Wright felt
that its obtuse (120 degree)
angle was more suited to
human movement than the
right angle. He used it in the
layout, the landscaping, and in
much of the built-in furniture of
the Honeycomb House.
The result: a home that is fas
cinating, spacious and efficient.
The use of the hexagonal
angle makes the rooms flow to
gether in a U shape around the
kitchen. A submerged fireplace
that burns logs vertically, and
the kitchen form the "core" of
the house.
The flow of room with room
creates an openness that Pro
fessor and Mrs. Paul Hanna re
quired when they commis
sioned Wright to design their
home in 1935.
Hanna, emeritus professor of
education, is now a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover In
stitution. He and his wife made
a gift of their home to the Uni
versity in 1975. They expressed
the wish that it become the re
sidence for a series of distin
guished visiting professors.
The Hannas spent two years
with Wright planning the
house. They wanted a home
that was-suitable for entertain
ing large numbers of guests,
and able to meet the needs of a
changing family.

Wright attempted to ac
comodate the Hannas wishes.
He made all the rooms, except
the kitchen and baths, open
outside onto terraces. In the
Hannas words, "We are always
finding new ways to go out."
With window walls, overlook
ing the campus and the footh
ills, Wright created a feeling of
open, or continuous space.
The house was built in five
phases to meet the financial
needs of the Hannas. The main
house and the carport were
built first. Then, in 1957, ac
cording to the original design,
Wright remodeled the bedroom
study area of the house since
the Hanna's children were
grown up and moved out.
Two final stages remain. The
guest house and the hobby
shop are to be remodeled into
caretakers quarters.
Many delays confronted the
Hannas when they were build
ing their home. Not only was
Wright busy with other pro
jects, but he constantly sent
new and different plans to
them.
Paul Hanna talks of working
with the genius of Wright. "His
mind never stopped working to
make the house more beautiful
and more efficient. He kept
sending plans. The house never
stood still. It was always un
dergoing modifications to im
prove it.

"We thoroughly enjoyed our
40 years association with Mr.
Wright. He used to visit us and
immediately go to the organ
and sit down and improvise for
20 or 30 minutes. Suddenly,
he'd jump up and say, 'Let's
rearrange the furniture.' And it
always seemed to look better
when he finished."
Until funds are available to
endow a visiting professorship,
President Lyman has desig
nated Hanna House as the Pro
vost's residence ad interim. Ac
cording to Lyman, the duties of
the University Provost "have
grown to include many official
functions which can only be ac
comodated in a home built on
the scale of the Honeycomb
House."
The living room can comfort
ably entertain 100, or cozily
hold two or three as a result of
its U shape. The cathedral ceil
ing and the carpeting make its
acoustics superb. Paul Hanna
often had musicians perform
for large groups.
At least 800 people view the
house each year at receptions. It
has been placed on the National
Register of Historic Places and
has been designated by the
American Institute of Ar
chitects as one of the 17 build
ings designed by Wright to be
retained as an example of his
contribution to American cul
ture.

The house not only enchants
quests, but also strangers. Pas
serbys often come up the
driveway to take pictures or just
to get a closer look.
Miller tells of one incident
where he was leaving late for a
meeting. A stranger drove up
and demanded that he be
shown the inside of the house
immediately.
In response to such demand,
the Stanford Museum has set
up tours every second and
fourth Thursday of the month
at 2 p.m. Reservations are
necessary. The tours are free
and can be arranged by calling
the Committee for Art office at
497-3469.
These tours will not be avail
able during July and August
when new Provost Don Ken
nedy and his family plan to
move in.
During a trip to Japan, the
Hannas were able to secure a
generous endowment gift from
the Nissan Motor Co. for the
maintenance and preservation
of their home.
