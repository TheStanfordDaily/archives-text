# For drama buffs, there's summer theatre
## 
### 
The Drama Department
opens this week (June 24-June
30) with its first Contemporary
Theater Workshop, an inten
sive training program for ac
tors, designers and technical
staff, which will feature three
full-length productions and at
least five one-act plays.
The workshop, directed by
Prof. Wendell Cole, will bring
together about 40 students,
selected from all age groups,
levels of experience, and parts
of the world, according to Lee
Fisher, the department's public
relations coordinator.
She said the students would
take classes in acting, move
ment, theater history and
theory, besides working on all
aspects of the productions.
"It's going to be a tight, care
fully planned schedule," she
explained. "They'll have re
hearsals and commitments —
to the shop and to their acting
— every day.
"We want to create a reper
tory environment ... to pro
vide them with that total group
experience."
Tennessee Williams' The
Glass Menagerie, directed by
Robert Lane, heads the Little
Theater Series of full-length
American plays. The show, de
signed by Michael Ramsaur,
will run July 11-14 and 18-21.
Lane describes Menagerie as
"a classic, poignant, partly au
tobiographical story about Wil
liams trying to come to terms
with his own family and the ef
fect of this departure (to be

come a playwright) on his
mother and sister.
"It's a memory play, full of
pathos, an elegy of reconcilia
tion with a painful past. . . and
yet, at times, it is unexpectedly
funny."
Following it will be Sam
Shephard's Mad Dog Blues, di
rected by Robert Egan and de
signed by John Rathman. Like
many works bv the Pulitzer
winning Shepard, Blues is a
wild trip through the hyped-up
language and burnt-out lives of
a group of rock musicians.
It runs July 25-28 and August
1 -4.
John Guare's The House of
Blue Leaves ends the series, Au
gust 8-11 and 15-18. Director
Robert Lane and designer
Wendell Cole hope to create
what Lane calls "a wild (atmos
phere) for a zany comedy about
a man who works in a zoo and
wants to be a songwriter. He
surrounds himself with an odd
assortment of characters, in
cluding his wife and mistress
(both of whom live with him)
. . . it's all very sad and eccen
tric."
Curtain time for the plays is 8
p.m. in the Little Theater, lo
cated on the side of Memorial
Auditorium near the Graduate
School of Business. Tickets will
be sold at the Drama Depart
ment office. Room 144, in the
back hall of the auditorium.
The free Nitery Series of
one-acts will run Wednesdays
through Fridays at noon, plus
midnight shows Fridays, with

dates to be announced. The
Nitery is the 590 wing of the Old
Union.
The series will include a play
by Wolfgang Bauer, directed by
Jim Carmody; Elaine May's Not
Enough Rope, directed by Kathy
Lubar; Murray Schisgal's The
Typist, directed by Debra
Skriba; Dan Wright's The Feast,
directed by Tony Curiel; and A
Cabaret of Breehtain Songs, di
rected by Miriam Yahil-Wax.
"We had wanted to make this
into an ail-American season,
but we had to consider cast size
and availability," Fisher
explained. "So, we opened it
up to be an all-contemporary
selection."
Cole said the drama depart
ment had presented few con
temporary plays in recent years
because of the difficulty in find
ing suitable material. "The 70s
are an unusual time in that we
have so few important playw
rights and plays," he said.
"We're in a transitional period,
I guess . . . Maybe another
Albee will turn up tomorrow
. . . but for now, well, Glass
Menagerie is 30 years old. . . .
We just don't have very much
to work with."
Joining Cole on the summer
workshop faculty are Robert
Lane, a doctoral candidate in
drama, who directed Univer
sity productions of Edward
Bond's The Sea in 1977 and
Shaw's Major Barbara last
winter; and Robert Egan, an as
sistant drama professor at the
University of Washington,

Seattle, who directed the 1976
MaratlSade here.
Alsoon the staff are Juan Val
enzuela, a University lecturer in
actor's movement; Michael
Ramsaur, production coor
dinator; Paul Murgatroyd,
technical director; and Barbara
Cleveland, costumer.
Daniel Birnbaum, a Univer
sity graduate, now working at
UC-San Diego, will be musical
coordinator.
Though it is designed as a

self-contained 8-unit program,
the workshop will open its clas
ses in acting, actor's movement
and American theater to non
workshop participants, Fisher
said.
Auditions, though, are gen
erally limited to workshop
members, but anyone in
terested should contact the de
partment.
