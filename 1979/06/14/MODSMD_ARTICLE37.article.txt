# Comfort varies at campus libraries

Three types of edifice domi
nate the academic landscape:
the classroom, the student resi
dence and the library.
In the prevailing pattern of
thought, the non-concrete con
tents of each of the three tend to
be emphasized while their
material structures, after the in
itial encounter, are glanced
over.
Without passing judgment
on such questions as whether
attention is better paid to the
professor's lecture or the color
of the classroom's walls, or
whether a university should
better spend money on a strong
residential education program
or more and better dorm bat
hrooms, one can at least con
clude that the books a library
contains are not its only impor
tant aspect.
Perhaps libraries were origi
nally intended solely as re
positories of printed know
ledge and experience. It is a fact
of nature, however, that stu
dents seeking that knowledge
and experience are inclined to
settle themselves in its physical
midst. Thus libraries have a
dual function: they are
storehouses of information and
temples of communion with
that information.
Green Library is a good exam
ple of a library predominantly
storehouse in conception. It
does an excellent job of keeping
a great many books (almost a
million at last count) dry and
free from the depradations of
hungry rodents, but most find
it relatively non-conducive to
serious study. It is full of echos
and winter-time drafts (both
aggravated if not caused by the
high ceilings of the study
areas), and the chairs and tables
belong to an older, less up
holstered age.
The undergraduate library,
Mever, appears, in contrast, to
be considered by many superla
tive in its function as a temple of
communion. One can go in, for
example, at 11:30 on a typical
Saturday night and find almost
as many students there as
books, all raptly communing,
barely able to tear themselves
away as closing time nears.
Most of the other libraries on
campus fall somewhere bet
ween these extremes. Some,
small and intimate, have highly
variable atmospheres. The

Classics Library, for exam pie, is
at times an excellent place to
study, quiet and with the smell
of erudition in the air, while at
other times some of the physi
cal fixtures of the department
such as the graduate students
make it wholly inhospitable.
Many of the departmental
libraries (the Math, Psychology
and Philosophy Libraries, for
example) fall into this category.
Some of the middle-sized lib
raries strike the best balance be
tween the two functions. Nota
ble in this respect are the Art
and Architecture Library (gen
erally good atmosphere, al
though the furniture could be
more comfortable), and the
Physics and Chemistry Lib
raries (both comfortable and
well-maintained but afflicted
with oddly impersonal atmos
pheres â€” perhaps a quirk of the
lighting).
Some students commune
best in an atmosphere of
anonymity, perhaps because
they can immerse themselves in
their studies the more com
pletely the less obtrusion their
physical selves create. For
them, the larger libraries are
best.
The Earth Sciences Library
(study areas well-integrated
among the books with comfort
able furniture, although the
height of the ceiling and the
large windows keep the temp
erature cool, especially in the
winter), and the Biology Lib
rary (large and varied study
areas as well as outside patios)
are both among the Universi
ty's finest.
Also in this category are the
graduate school libraries. These
include the Business Library
(well-furnished and comforta
ble), the Law School Library
(plush, although frequently
suffering from extremes of
temperature) and Lane Medical
Library (not the best facility for
study).
The undergraduate should
be warned, however, that he
may be welcomed considerably
less enthusiastically in some of
these places than others. The
quality of his reception may
even vary from day to day. The
East Asia Collection in the Lou
Henry Hoover Building is also
an uncertain quantity in this re
gard.
