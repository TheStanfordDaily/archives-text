# The
						Rock – a haunting reminder of the past
## Alcatraz remains an empty shell of the hated and feared prison it once was

th.it we control, although I
guess this is the most famous
part," said Bill Wh.ilen, .i Ciol
den C..ite National Recreation
\rea official, nodding toward
the tiny linger of rock across the
Bay.
Alcatra/ Island lay quietly in
the water, whipped by a chilly
wind, pummelled hv the Pacific
Ocean's blue waves. The one
time home of Al ( apone was
greeting visitors who had no in
tention of staving more than a
tew hours.
Alcatraz, once the object of
more fear and hate than any
place else in America, opened
to the public in 1 1 >73 for t he first
time since Mexico ceded the is
land m IS4K
I ruin 1934, when federal
prison administrators made the
island a home tor America's in
idirigibles, until 1%3, when of
ficials declared it obsolete, few
i iti/ens could honestly claim
neutral feelings for" I he Rock
l or millions ot Americans,
\lcatraz represented protec
tion, a fortress where the gov
ernment held unmitigated evil
at bav I or others, Alcatra/ was
a monument to barbarous
cruelty, a continuing reminder
ot America's failures, lo the
handful of men who actually
served time there, it was at once
a living hell, a worse existence
than they could ever have im
agined, and paradoxically, a
coveted mark of high status in
the underworld.
Psychological myth
"Alcatraz was founded on a
psychological myth," VVhalen
said. "It was a place that would
make the public feel safe from
the criminals ot the l l )ruis,
that would make the public feel
we've really taken care of those
guvs.'
"At the same time, there was
a lot lit trouble in existing pris
ons, a lot of riots and violence,
and this was something the
prison people could use as a
disciplinary measure.
"They really built up the
image of Alcatraz . . . no one
was ever taken to other prisons
tor release, because the prison
people wanted to build up the
image that you never get off
1 lie Rock.'
"Even today, the Bureau ot
Prisons is reluctant to talk about
it to us," he said.
A little over a mile from
Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz
still has an air of ominous en
ticement that the years of isola
tion have not dimmed.
A large sign warns: KEEP
oi l US Gov't Property. The
water tower, looming high

above the island, bears a diffe
rent message: "Home of the
Free Indian — Welcome," a re
mnant ot thi' lengthy occupa
tion ot the island by militant In
dians at the start ot this decade.
The automated lighthouse
watches over the empty settle
ment, warning away unwary
boats.
Alcatraz has been dead 14
years now, and it shows. Shat
tered windows in the old yel
low administration building
give it .1 blind, hollow look;
rusted bars reek of decay.
"See it you can teel the at
mosphere, trv to imagine
you're a prisoner here," guide
Jerry Rombourg advised vis
itors Even the most skeptical
lelt a small chill as the ferry pul
led away from the island and
headed back to fisherman's
Military installation
Alcatraz began as a militar\
installation. Flie island is solid
rock, with structures built on
two levels, rhe lower area was
constructed by the military,
with the idea ot keeping the
enemy out A great deal ot the
upper level was built or altered
by the prison authorities to
keep another sort of enemy in.
rhe two areas are connected
by an intricate series of stair
ways and catwalks, rusted and
sprouting weeds in many cases.
A winding road, carved out of
solid stone, winds its way up
the jagged hill.
"All the island's piping and
wiring is contained in a tunnel
underneath this road," Rom
bourg told visitors as they
trudged up the hill. "They built
it into the road because it was
the only way to protect it from
the wind and the sea." The
tunnel caused a number of
problems, though.
"Every time there was an es
cape, or an escape attempt, the
prison authorities had to crawl
through all the tunnels to see if
the prisoners were hiding in
there. And once or twice a week
they had to go through it to see
if the prisoners were hiding any
contraband," Rombourg said.
When Alcatraz was young,
there were about 40 terraced
gardens on the island, tended
by inmates who got outside
the cellblock for good behavior.
The island's vegetarv anarchy
today stems from the old gar
dens.
Little remains in the war
den's office to indicate that it
was once the command post of
a maximum security system
covering an area ot 12 acres. An
old desk rots quietly in one
corner, on the wall is a rusted

brown spot, once a control
panel that lit up it trouble flared
anywhere on the island.
"The warden had some
pretty tough ideas about sec
urity," Rombourg recounted.
"He would send guards out to
the rifle range, and tell them to
practice during the morning as
the prisoners marched by on
their way to work."
Past the warden's office is the
old visitor's area — a dark,
parched, peeling room, still
heavy with the stench of loneli
ness. In this dimly-lit room
wives and children sat, waiting
to catch a glimpse of husbands
and fathers — through a one
toot square window with inch
thick glass.
They spoke only through
telephones.
On the other side of the win
dow was the heart and soul of
Alcatraz — if it had such a thing
— the three cell blocks. Here
the Al Capones and Robert
Strouds lived out desperate
year after desperate year,
watching the San Francisco
skyline ]ust a mile away.
Here they stayed, in a pain
fully small nine by ti\ e foot cell,
with a folding cot, stool, sink,
toilet, light bulb, and folding
bench and table. And their
time.
'Silent days'
"From to were
what's known as 'the silent
davs.' " Rombourg intoned as
\ .sitors moved among the cells.
"The prisoners were not al
lowed to talk to each other.
Thev got a three-minute break
on weekends. Evervone got to
be prettv proficient in arm lan
guage, shoulder language, sign
language, am kind but spo
ken.
"Reading material was non
existent. In the prison library
there were hardlv anv books to
read . . . mail did not exist. An
inmate could have one \isit a
month," Rombourg added He
told visitors to go into the cells:
"But don't shut the doors.
We've already' had a couple
people locked in."
The ti nv cells prod uce now
as thev must have produced
then a feeling of quiet, desol

ate hopelessness. Visitors
walked inside, gazing in won
der at the bleak walls, and con
versation died out. In one sec
tion of "Broadway" — the main
cell block — they examined the
pockmarked floor where prison
guards dropped concussion
grenades to break up a riot in
1946.
Others wandered back and
looked at the narrow utility
tunnel running between the cell
blocks. In 1946, Alcatraz in
mates won a major concession:
twice a week, guards would
turn on a small radio at the end
of the tunnel. By kneeling be
side a small air vent under the
sink in each cell, the prisoner
could hear the radio echo
through the tunnel.
The utility tunnel has served
other purposes from time to
time, in 1962, three inmates
painstakingly tunneled out the
back of their cells into the tun
nel and climbed out the cell
block skylight. They were never
seen again.
Like the other three men who
escaped from"The Rock,"
they're presumed dead. Any
one who could get away,
psychiatrists say, would surely
have bragged about it by now.
Solitary
Past the main cell block is the
isolation and segregation block
— or solitary, if you prefer. Dis
ciplinary cases could spend up
to 19 days at a time in solitary,
where the prison served them
onlv two meals a week. The rest
of the time they got bread and
water,
It that wasn't enough, they
went to "the hole" a cell with
nothing but a blanket in it. If an
inmate was too noisv in the
hole, an outer door could be
closed, cutting off all light and
most sound from the outside.
Here, in the solitary block,
Robert Stroud the Birdman
ol Alcatraz - spent his time in
cell 41. Stroud, sentenced to
death, won a commutation ol
sentence: to lite in solitary con
tinement. "That was a rather
unusual sentence," Rombourg
noted.
Outside the isolation block is
the main yard, where inmates

got a tow minutes to exercise
each week. The yard had space
for basketball, handball, and
shuffleboard.
But most inmates spent their
time huddling against the sharp
Bay wind, gazing out across the
water at the San Francisco
docks and counting seagulls —
which were after all, alive and
free. By standing on the top
step at the side of the yard they
could see the Bay, the Golden
Gate Bridge, a bit of fog
shrouded San Francisco skyline
— and the ever-present guard
tower.
Now the yard, like every
thing else on Alcatraz, is dead.
The tour headed back toward
the dock, where the ferry
waited. Rombourg pointed out
the remnants of the apartment
buildings where a third of Al
catraz' guards lived with their
families when the prison was in
operation.
Ali that remains of them now
are three huge mounds of life
less concrete beside the shat
tered corpse of a guard tower,
symbolic of Alcatraz itself — an
island which died of old age.
The era which spawned Alcat
raz is dead too; the only sur
prise is that the island managed
to live on for so long afterward.
The only life now on "the
rock" is the vegetation that
peeks out everywhere — but
that, too, is doomed. Alcatraz
really is solid rock; when the
military took over the island, it
dynamited huge holes in the
ground and filled them with
dirt.
Now the soil is eroding away,
and soon only rock will remain.
Alcatraz will simply be a lifeless
hump in the Bay, a bare de
serted place of despair and
crumbled hope. The lighthouse
will stay, a marker for the
world's largest grave.
It the touring group did not
feel a change when they step
ped onto the island, they cer
taink felt one as thev left. Voi
ces rose, laughter returned, and
evervone eagerly watched the
approach of the San Francisco
docks. Almost no one turned to
look at the lighthouse, winking
through the afternoon foe.
