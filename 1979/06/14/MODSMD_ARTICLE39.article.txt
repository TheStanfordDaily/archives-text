# The 						Zoo â€” home of 'bizarre' DJs, spot news, good tunes

With 15 students, a $1500 grant and much en
thusiasm, January 1947 marked the birth of Stan
ford's non-commerical radio station KZSU, then
known as KSU.
The fledgeling station, now located under
neath Memorial Auditorium, was originally re
ceived by campus dormitories through a closed
circuit system.
That closed circuit AM network has undergone
many transformations since its inception 32 years
ago. The metamorphosis has resulted in an im
pressive 500 watt non-commercial FM network
which is becoming, as station manager Mike Di
martino brags "the alternative station."
Affectionally called the Zoo by its staff, KZSU
is staffed by approximately 150 individuals, 25
percent of which are non-students, said Dimar
tino.
Although the station is a "student organiza
tion" it is often necessary to accept past students
to perform intricate engineering tasks, Dimartino
explained.
"Of course," said Dimartino, "practically
everybody wants to become a D.J." And due to
the Zoo's large turnover of personnel, it's rather
easy to become one.
There is a three unit class offered by the Un
dergraduate Specials Dept. which gives training
sessions for prospective D.J.s, said Dimartino.
Beginners work with the closed circuit AM net
work to perfect techniques before advancing to
the FM broadcast.
"However," he added, "most people get into
KZSU without the class, especially those who
work in news."
On the average, Dimartino said, "by your sec
ond quarter of work you'll have your own
show."
"Just be persistent," says one D.J. "You'll get
in. It may take awhile, but you'll get in."
Of course, for those who are not loquaciously
inclined, there are plenty of other opportunities
at KZSU. The Zoo can always use dedicated
people in business, programming, news, public
affairs, station publicity, sports reporting, pro
duction and especially engineering, said Dimar
tino.
This may be because the Zoo is growing in
prominence. "We're moving into the big time,"
says Dimartino. "We're getting more and more
recognition bv the large record companies."
He attributes this success to diverse types of

music, special showsand more interesting news
casts. The Zoo plays everything from Devo to the
Eagles, and each D.J. plays what he or she likes.
Accordingly, all tastes are satisfied, says the
manager. They also produce a variety of special
programs. The Zoo airs the Palo Alto City Coun
cil meetings on Mondays.
But one of the more interesting aspects of the
new Zoo is their increase in interviews. In addi
tion to the regular campus conferences and jazz
interviews aired every week, the Zoo is attempt
ing to get big name personalities on the station.
Just recently, the Zoo has interviewed such top
personalities as Walter Matthau, the rock group
Boston, and the lead group from Splendoron the
Grass, Couchois, Dimartino recounted.
When asked why he puts in the 25 hours a
week, Dimartino replied, "Well, it's really relax
ing in a way. Although there's the pressure to get
the next cut (record) on, and havoc all around,
you can really relax."
He added, "Everyone who works down here is
in love with music. They all know some artist
well, and we find out trivia tidbits from each
other that make the work even more interest
ing."
Bizarre Dave Bayer, disc jockey extraordinaire
does it "just because its fun." He believes that
most D.J.s do it because of this fun factor. "It's
just fun piecing together a show, doing public
service announcements and basically just mak
ing the whole thing work."
Bayer, who is one of 53 licensed D.J.s at the
Zoo, claims that no one should decide not to
become a D.J. merely because you have to earn a
third class commercial license. The FCC's license
is easy for any Stanford student to obtain, he
says.
The freedom enjoyed by a D.J. is one of the
most attractive aspects of the job, says Bayer.
"They can do virtually anything that they want
to," he said. Bayer attested to having his "mo
ments of craziness." In defense of these times he
says, "Yes, we could be just another radio sta
tion. But why should we?"
During his show from two to six on Wednes
day afternoons, Bayer receives many requests
from avid listeners, but as with manv large com
mercial stations, doesn't play all of them.
"Sometimes the requests just don't fit the
show." But like most D.J.s at the Zoo, Bayer tries
to honor all requests.
