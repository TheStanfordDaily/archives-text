# Job prospects remain good for graduating seniors, law, med and biz students

In the last 10 years, "there has
always been an increase in the
rate of employment for Stan
ford students," said Ralph Kel
ler, director of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC), and despite the threat
of recession, job prospects for
the present graduating class
should be "quite good, possibly
better than last year."
The only exceptions are those
students graduating with lib
eral arts degrees, said Keller,
who do not intend to go on to
graduate school.
According to Keller, place
ment of those students are
given top priority at the CPPC.
Such students often have dif
ficulty finding any job oppor
tunities and starting salaries are
usually comparable to salaries
earned bv graduates trom other
universities and colleges, said
Keller.
Starting salaries tor students
with a Bachelor of Science de
gree, however, are usually "a
shade higher" than their coun
terparts from other univer
sities, said Keller.
What distinguishes Stanford
liberal arts graduates trom
other graduates is that thev
usually advance taster once
they find a job, Keller said.
According to Rick Reis, di
rector of Engineering and

Science Placement at CPPC, the
major difficulty for students
with science, math or en
gineering degrees is trying to
choose the best of five or six
offers and not assuming that
any one of them is the best pos
sible.
"Engineers are often
stereotyped as having a
mechanical way of adding up
all the possible advantages and
disadvantages of a potential job
and somehow coming up with a
number to decide for them,"
but job-choosing, whether for
an engineer or an English
major, is an "emotional pro
cess," Reis said.
One factor which has exacer
bated the employment situa
tion for many job-seekers is the
sheer number of graduating
students which "leap-frogged"
in the '60s, said Keller. "There
are twice as many students
graduating as 10 years ago, and
five times as manv as in 1950."
According to Keller, manv
more people are seeking |obs in
order to maintain* a certain
standard of living and offset ris
ing inflation.
According to a recent article
in Btitnn'ss Week, said Keller, a
person earning $25,000 this
vear would have to earn 555.000
by 1985 in order to keep up with
inflation. "Salaries, including
starting salaries, are decreasing
in terms of real dollars," s,nd

Keller.
Besides the greater volume of
competition, said Keller,
jobs have tended to become
more and more specialized.
Business and industry which
constitute about 80 percent of
the job opportunities in
America, have begun to realize,
however, that don't
have to be deeply steeped in all
the technical aspects of a par
ticular job and that students
that graduate from here with
liberal arts degrees can become
quite successful. What they
need is the opportunity," said
Keller.
Over the past several years
only 50 percent of the Stanford
graduating classes have actu
ally gone on to graduate school
and further specialization, al
though 85 percent to 90 percent
claimed as college freshmen
that thev planned to do so, said
Keller.
"Many are basically tired of
school and want to do some
thing else for at least a little
while. We need to be very ag
gressive for those students,"
said Keller, "but we feel they
generally compete very well."
Many liberal arts majors have
thus been able to move into
marketing or personnel work in
which the nature ot the person
is often more significant than
