In the last 10 years, "there has
always been an increase in the
rate of employment for Stan
ford students," said Ralph Kel
ler, director of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC), and despite the threat
of recession, job prospects for
the present graduating class
should be "quite good, possibly
better than last year."
The only exceptions are those
students graduating with lib
eral arts degrees, said Keller,
who do not intend to go on to
graduate school.
According to Keller, place
ment of those students are
given top priority at the CPPC.
Such students often have dif
ficulty finding any job oppor
tunities and starting salaries are
usually comparable to salaries
earned bv graduates trom other
universities and colleges, said
Keller.
Starting salaries tor students
with a Bachelor of Science de
gree, however, are usually "a
shade higher" than their coun
terparts from other univer
sities, said Keller.
What distinguishes Stanford
liberal arts graduates trom
other graduates is that thev
usually advance taster once
they find a job, Keller said.
According to Rick Reis, di
rector of Engineering and

Science Placement at CPPC, the
major difficulty for students
with science, math or en
gineering degrees is trying to
choose the best of five or six
offers and not assuming that
any one of them is the best pos
sible.
"Engineers are often
stereotyped as having a
mechanical way of adding up
all the possible advantages and
disadvantages of a potential job
and somehow coming up with a
number to decide for them,"
but job-choosing, whether for
an engineer or an English
major, is an "emotional pro
cess," Reis said.
One factor which has exacer
bated the employment situa
tion for many job-seekers is the
sheer number of graduating
students which "leap-frogged"
in the '60s, said Keller. "There
are twice as many students
graduating as 10 years ago, and
five times as manv as in 1950."
According to Keller, manv
more people are seeking |obs in
order to maintain* a certain
standard of living and offset ris
ing inflation.
According to a recent article
in Btitnn'ss Week, said Keller, a
person earning $25,000 this
vear would have to earn 555.000
by 1985 in order to keep up with
inflation. "Salaries, including
starting salaries, are decreasing
in terms of real dollars," s,nd

Keller.
Besides the greater volume of
competition, said Keller,
jobs have tended to become
more and more specialized.
Business and industry which
constitute about 80 percent of
the job opportunities in
America, have begun to realize,
however, that don't
have to be deeply steeped in all
the technical aspects of a par
ticular job and that students
that graduate from here with
liberal arts degrees can become
quite successful. What they
need is the opportunity," said
Keller.
Over the past several years
only 50 percent of the Stanford
graduating classes have actu
ally gone on to graduate school
and further specialization, al
though 85 percent to 90 percent
claimed as college freshmen
that thev planned to do so, said
Keller.
"Many are basically tired of
school and want to do some
thing else for at least a little
while. We need to be very ag
gressive for those students,"
said Keller, "but we feel they
generally compete very well."
Many liberal arts majors have
thus been able to move into
marketing or personnel work in
which the nature ot the person
is often more significant than
his or her degree oi specializa
tion, said Keller. It help, how
ever to have taken courses like
statistics, computer science and
math.
According to Keller,
economics majors for example,
generally fare better than man\
students with Bachelor ot Arts
degrees because many of them
have taken those courses arid
can "speak their language —
literally."
It has also become very expen
sive to employ students with
master's degrees from business

school, for example, whose
mean salary begins at about
$25,000 compared to $11,000 or
$12,000 for an employee with a
baccalaureate degree, Keller
said.
Hiring students with MBAs
has also been known to gener
ate morale problems among
worker* in a competitive office
situation, Keller said.
I his has caused a move
ment towards what some
people refer to as the 'two-for
one system' in which busines
ses hire two students with bac
calaureate degrees tor the price
of one with a master's degree,"

said Keller.
However, according to
Marianne Pettersson, recruit
ing coordinator at the Graduate
School of Business, Stanford's
MBA graduates have not been
affected by the two-for-one sys
tem.
"Tt looks like another good
Ayear for the graduates,"
said Pettersson. "There were
even more recruiters than last
year." For 300 graduating stu
dents this year, 279 company
recruiters were scheduled to in
terview students at the busi
ness school between November
and mid-February — an almost
one-to-one ratio, she said.
Only 235 actually came, said
Pettersson, "mainly because of
a lack of student interest; stu
dents already had their op
tions."
TheStanford Law School and
Medical School are also having
"another good year," according
to Gloria Pyzka, director of
placement at the Law School
and Dr. Kenneth Vosti, as
sociate dean for student affairs
at the Medical School.
According to Pyzka, almost
75 percent of the graduating
class is going into private law
firms which generally handle
corporate business practice.
The rest of the class opted for a
range of jobs including gov
ernment internships, judicial
clerkships, public interest and
legal services and non-legal ac
tivities.
Those students who haven't
selected jobs are either "limit
ing themselves geographically
or targetting specific substan

tive areas," said Pyzka. Also,
said Pyzka, most students are
either moving back to their
home regions (usually secon
dary metropolitan areas or to
wards four major metropolitan
areas — Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco, New York City and
Washington, D.C.
Starting salaries for these
graduates can hit over
$30,000 in the top law firms in
New York City, said Pyzka, and
can range down to $16,000 or
$17,000 in regional metropoli
tan areas.
According to Pyzka, how
ever, this does not reflect a
gross disparity in relative stan
dards of living. "New York is an
expensive place to live," said
Pyzka, "and salaries compete
regionally."
Last April Vosti announced
that 70 percent of the Medical
School graduates were able to
match one of their top three
choices for internships in medi
cal schools around the country
on the basis of academic record

and career goals.
Matches were made through
the National Resident Matching
Program which gathers data
from senior interns and hospi
tals around the country who
have listed their top choices.
Student and hospital prefer
ences are then sent to a central
computer office which does the
final matching.
According to Vosti, 41 per
cent of the students were in
terested in internal medicine
rather than a more specialized
field of study which reflects
their desire for flexibility in de
cisions concerning postdoctoral
fellowships.
Many students find the West
Coast an attractive place to
begin their internships, said
Vosti. Those students who
spent their undergraduate as
well as graduate years here,
however, are encouraged to
seek different settings for
further study. "A new and dif
ferent set of dogma would be
profitable," said Vosti.

cisions concerning postdoctoral
fellowships.
Many students find the West
Coast an attractive place to
begin their internships, said
Vosti. Those students who
spent their undergraduate as
well as graduate years here,
however, are encouraged to
seek different settings for
further study. "A new and dif
ferent set of dogma would be
profitable," said Vosti.
In the last 10 years, "there has
always been an increase in the
rate of employment for Stan
ford students," said Ralph Kel
ler, director of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC), and despite the threat
of recession, job prospects for
the present graduating class
should be "quite good, possibly
better than last year."
The only exceptions are those
students graduating with lib
eral arts degrees, said Keller,
who do not intend to go on to
graduate school.
According to Keller, place
ment of those students are
given top priority at the CPPC.
Such students often have dif
ficulty finding any job oppor
tunities and starting salaries are
usually comparable to salaries
earned bv graduates trom other
universities and colleges, said
Keller.
Starting salaries tor students
with a Bachelor of Science de
gree, however, are usually "a
shade higher" than their coun
terparts from other univer
sities, said Keller.
What distinguishes Stanford
liberal arts graduates trom
other graduates is that thev
usually advance taster once
they find a job, Keller said.
According to Rick Reis, di
rector of Engineering and

Science Placement at CPPC, the
major difficulty for students
with science, math or en
gineering degrees is trying to
choose the best of five or six
offers and not assuming that
any one of them is the best pos
sible.
"Engineers are often
stereotyped as having a
mechanical way of adding up
all the possible advantages and
disadvantages of a potential job
and somehow coming up with a
number to decide for them,"
but job-choosing, whether for
an engineer or an English
major, is an "emotional pro
cess," Reis said.
One factor which has exacer
bated the employment situa
tion for many job-seekers is the
sheer number of graduating
students which "leap-frogged"
in the '60s, said Keller. "There
are twice as many students
graduating as 10 years ago, and
five times as manv as in 1950."
According to Keller, manv
more people are seeking |obs in
order to maintain* a certain
standard of living and offset ris
ing inflation.
According to a recent article
in Btitnn'ss Week, said Keller, a
person earning $25,000 this
vear would have to earn 555.000
by 1985 in order to keep up with
inflation. "Salaries, including
starting salaries, are decreasing
in terms of real dollars," s,nd

Keller.
Besides the greater volume of
competition, said Keller,
jobs have tended to become
more and more specialized.
Business and industry which
constitute about 80 percent of
the job opportunities in
America, have begun to realize,
however, that don't
have to be deeply steeped in all
the technical aspects of a par
ticular job and that students
that graduate from here with
liberal arts degrees can become
quite successful. What they
need is the opportunity," said
Keller.
Over the past several years
only 50 percent of the Stanford
graduating classes have actu
ally gone on to graduate school
and further specialization, al
though 85 percent to 90 percent
claimed as college freshmen
that thev planned to do so, said
Keller.
"Many are basically tired of
school and want to do some
thing else for at least a little
while. We need to be very ag
gressive for those students,"
said Keller, "but we feel they
generally compete very well."
Many liberal arts majors have
thus been able to move into
marketing or personnel work in
which the nature ot the person
is often more significant than
his or her degree oi specializa
tion, said Keller. It help, how
ever to have taken courses like
statistics, computer science and
math.
According to Keller,
economics majors for example,
generally fare better than man\
students with Bachelor ot Arts
degrees because many of them
have taken those courses arid
can "speak their language —
literally."
It has also become very expen
sive to employ students with
master's degrees from business

school, for example, whose
mean salary begins at about
$25,000 compared to $11,000 or
$12,000 for an employee with a
baccalaureate degree, Keller
said.
Hiring students with MBAs
has also been known to gener
ate morale problems among
worker* in a competitive office
situation, Keller said.
I his has caused a move
ment towards what some
people refer to as the 'two-for
one system' in which busines
ses hire two students with bac
calaureate degrees tor the price
of one with a master's degree,"

said Keller.
However, according to
Marianne Pettersson, recruit
ing coordinator at the Graduate
School of Business, Stanford's
MBA graduates have not been
affected by the two-for-one sys
tem.
"Tt looks like another good
Ayear for the graduates,"
said Pettersson. "There were
even more recruiters than last
year." For 300 graduating stu
dents this year, 279 company
recruiters were scheduled to in
terview students at the busi
ness school between November
and mid-February — an almost
one-to-one ratio, she said.
Only 235 actually came, said
Pettersson, "mainly because of
a lack of student interest; stu
dents already had their op
tions."
TheStanford Law School and
Medical School are also having
"another good year," according
to Gloria Pyzka, director of
placement at the Law School
and Dr. Kenneth Vosti, as
sociate dean for student affairs
at the Medical School.
According to Pyzka, almost
75 percent of the graduating
class is going into private law
firms which generally handle
corporate business practice.
The rest of the class opted for a
range of jobs including gov
ernment internships, judicial
clerkships, public interest and
legal services and non-legal ac
tivities.
Those students who haven't
selected jobs are either "limit
ing themselves geographically
or targetting specific substan

tive areas," said Pyzka. Also,
said Pyzka, most students are
either moving back to their
home regions (usually secon
dary metropolitan areas or to
wards four major metropolitan
areas — Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco, New York City and
Washington, D.C.
Starting salaries for these
graduates can hit over
$30,000 in the top law firms in
New York City, said Pyzka, and
can range down to $16,000 or
$17,000 in regional metropoli
tan areas.
According to Pyzka, how
ever, this does not reflect a
gross disparity in relative stan
dards of living. "New York is an
expensive place to live," said
Pyzka, "and salaries compete
regionally."
Last April Vosti announced
that 70 percent of the Medical
School graduates were able to
match one of their top three
choices for internships in medi
cal schools around the country
on the basis of academic record

and career goals.
Matches were made through
the National Resident Matching
Program which gathers data
from senior interns and hospi
tals around the country who
have listed their top choices.
Student and hospital prefer
ences are then sent to a central
computer office which does the
final matching.
According to Vosti, 41 per
cent of the students were in
terested in internal medicine
rather than a more specialized
field of study which reflects
their desire for flexibility in de
cisions concerning postdoctoral
fellowships.

have listed their top choices.
Student and hospital prefer
ences are then sent to a central
computer office which does the
final matching.
According to Vosti, 41 per
cent of the students were in
terested in internal medicine
rather than a more specialized
field of study which reflects
their desire for flexibility in de
cisions concerning postdoctoral
fellowships.
Many students find the West
Coast an attractive place to
begin their internships, said
Vosti. Those students who
spent their undergraduate as
well as graduate years here,
however, are encouraged to
seek different settings for
further study. "A new and dif
ferent set of dogma would be
profitable," said Vosti.
In the last 10 years, "there has
always been an increase in the
rate of employment for Stan
ford students," said Ralph Kel
ler, director of the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center
(CPPC), and despite the threat
of recession, job prospects for
the present graduating class
should be "quite good, possibly
better than last year."
The only exceptions are those
students graduating with lib
eral arts degrees, said Keller,
who do not intend to go on to
graduate school.
According to Keller, place
ment of those students are
given top priority at the CPPC.
Such students often have dif
ficulty finding any job oppor
tunities and starting salaries are
usually comparable to salaries
earned bv graduates trom other
universities and colleges, said
Keller.
Starting salaries tor students
with a Bachelor of Science de
gree, however, are usually "a
shade higher" than their coun
terparts from other univer
sities, said Keller.
What distinguishes Stanford
liberal arts graduates trom
other graduates is that thev
usually advance taster once
they find a job, Keller said.
According to Rick Reis, di
rector of Engineering and

Science Placement at CPPC, the
major difficulty for students
with science, math or en
gineering degrees is trying to
choose the best of five or six
offers and not assuming that
any one of them is the best pos
sible.
"Engineers are often
stereotyped as having a
mechanical way of adding up
all the possible advantages and
disadvantages of a potential job
and somehow coming up with a
number to decide for them,"
but job-choosing, whether for
an engineer or an English
major, is an "emotional pro
cess," Reis said.
One factor which has exacer
bated the employment situa
tion for many job-seekers is the
sheer number of graduating
students which "leap-frogged"
in the '60s, said Keller. "There
are twice as many students
graduating as 10 years ago, and
five times as manv as in 1950."
According to Keller, manv
more people are seeking |obs in
order to maintain* a certain
standard of living and offset ris
ing inflation.
According to a recent article
in Btitnn'ss Week, said Keller, a
person earning $25,000 this
vear would have to earn 555.000
by 1985 in order to keep up with
inflation. "Salaries, including
starting salaries, are decreasing
in terms of real dollars," s,nd

Keller.
Besides the greater volume of
competition, said Keller,
jobs have tended to become
more and more specialized.
Business and industry which
constitute about 80 percent of
the job opportunities in
America, have begun to realize,
however, that don't
have to be deeply steeped in all
the technical aspects of a par
ticular job and that students
that graduate from here with
liberal arts degrees can become
quite successful. What they
need is the opportunity," said
Keller.
Over the past several years
only 50 percent of the Stanford
graduating classes have actu
ally gone on to graduate school
and further specialization, al
though 85 percent to 90 percent
claimed as college freshmen
that thev planned to do so, said
Keller.
"Many are basically tired of
school and want to do some
thing else for at least a little
while. We need to be very ag
gressive for those students,"
said Keller, "but we feel they
generally compete very well."
Many liberal arts majors have
thus been able to move into
marketing or personnel work in
which the nature ot the person
is often more significant than
his or her degree oi specializa
tion, said Keller. It help, how
ever to have taken courses like
statistics, computer science and
math.
According to Keller,
economics majors for example,
generally fare better than man\
students with Bachelor ot Arts
degrees because many of them
have taken those courses arid
can "speak their language —
literally."
It has also become very expen
sive to employ students with
master's degrees from business

school, for example, whose
mean salary begins at about
$25,000 compared to $11,000 or
$12,000 for an employee with a
baccalaureate degree, Keller
said.
Hiring students with MBAs
has also been known to gener
ate morale problems among
worker* in a competitive office
situation, Keller said.
I his has caused a move
ment towards what some
people refer to as the 'two-for
one system' in which busines
ses hire two students with bac
calaureate degrees tor the price
of one with a master's degree,"

said Keller.
However, according to
Marianne Pettersson, recruit
ing coordinator at the Graduate
School of Business, Stanford's
MBA graduates have not been
affected by the two-for-one sys
tem.
"Tt looks like another good
Ayear for the graduates,"
said Pettersson. "There were
even more recruiters than last
year." For 300 graduating stu
dents this year, 279 company
recruiters were scheduled to in
terview students at the busi
ness school between November
and mid-February — an almost
one-to-one ratio, she said.
Only 235 actually came, said
Pettersson, "mainly because of
a lack of student interest; stu
dents already had their op
tions."
TheStanford Law School and
Medical School are also having
"another good year," according
to Gloria Pyzka, director of
placement at the Law School
and Dr. Kenneth Vosti, as
sociate dean for student affairs
at the Medical School.
According to Pyzka, almost
75 percent of the graduating
class is going into private law
firms which generally handle
corporate business practice.
The rest of the class opted for a
range of jobs including gov
ernment internships, judicial
clerkships, public interest and
legal services and non-legal ac
tivities.
Those students who haven't
selected jobs are either "limit
ing themselves geographically
or targetting specific substan

tive areas," said Pyzka. Also,
said Pyzka, most students are
either moving back to their
home regions (usually secon
dary metropolitan areas or to
wards four major metropolitan
areas — Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco, New York City and
Washington, D.C.
Starting salaries for these
graduates can hit over
$30,000 in the top law firms in
New York City, said Pyzka, and
can range down to $16,000 or
$17,000 in regional metropoli
tan areas.
According to Pyzka, how
ever, this does not reflect a
gross disparity in relative stan
dards of living. "New York is an
expensive place to live," said
Pyzka, "and salaries compete
regionally."
Last April Vosti announced
that 70 percent of the Medical
School graduates were able to
match one of their top three
choices for internships in medi
cal schools around the country
on the basis of academic record

and career goals.
Matches were made through
the National Resident Matching
Program which gathers data
from senior interns and hospi
tals around the country who
have listed their top choices.
Student and hospital prefer
ences are then sent to a central
computer office which does the
final matching.
According to Vosti, 41 per
cent of the students were in
terested in internal medicine
rather than a more specialized
field of study which reflects
their desire for flexibility in de
cisions concerning postdoctoral
fellowships.
Many students find the West
Coast an attractive place to
begin their internships, said
Vosti. Those students who
spent their undergraduate as
well as graduate years here,
however, are encouraged to
seek different settings for
further study. "A new and dif
ferent set of dogma would be
profitable," said Vosti.
