# Rockin' the Bay

### 
In general, San Francisco and
the Bay Area have an extremely
good reputation in the music
industry. Bands and artists of
varying size and fame often try
to include San Francisco on
their itinerary. A summary of
what you can expect from
facilities and promoters follow:
Cow Palace. A general
purpose, large, basketball-type
auditorium. Only major acts
with a large draw play the Cow
Palace. Parking is a bit of a has
sle, as is traffic when leaving.
Bill Graham tends to use this
place more than other promot
ers. Capacity: about 13,000.
Geneva and Santos, San Fran
cisco (near South San Fran
cisco).
Oakland Coliseum/Stadium.
What can I say about a baseball
stadium? Location of Bill
Graham's Days on the Green,
Great on warm days. Capacity;
about 60,000. The Coliseum is
the basketball/hockey part of
the complex. It is much like the
Cow Palace, except nicer and
newer. Capacity: approxi
mately 16,000. Hegenberger
Road and Highway 17, Oak
land.
Zellerbach Auditorium.
Nice, nice, very nice. An acous
tically superb auditorium.
Tends to have more mellow
acts. Capacity: 3500. UC-
Berkeley campus.
Greek Theatre. Pleasant set
ting in the design of an ancient
Greek amphitheatre. Can be a
bit uncomfortable on a very hot
day. The building stone some
times bounces the sound
around. Capacity: about 9000,
UC-Berkeley campus.
Paramount Theatre. An ex
tremely comfortable and enjoy
able place to hear good music in
the heart of Oakland. One of
the best. Capacity: approxi
mately 3200. Broadway and
West Grand, Oakland.
Berkeley Community
Theatre. Another great one.

Not lis new as Zellerbach, but
newer than the Paramount. Ex
cellent acoustics. Capacity: ap
proximately 3500. Ashton and
Grove, Berkeley.
Concord Pavilion. An in
teresting combination of out
door reserved and "festival"
seating. It includes a covered
section of seats with a sur
rounding and separated grass
area. The sound in the reserved
seats is sometimes made too
lound so that the "festival"
seats can hear. Capacity: ap
proximately 5000. 2000 Kirker
Pass Road, Concord.
San Jose Civic Auditorium.
A basketball, boxing and wre
stling auditorium. Much like
Winterland acoustically with a
similar layout. Capacity: about
2750. Market and West Carlos,
San Jose.
Center for the Performing
Arts. In my opinion, the best
auditorium in the Bay Area.
Less than seven years old, with
comfortable seats. A real joy.
Capacity: approximately 3000.
Almaden and Park, San Jose.
Leavey Center. A newish,
large-on- the-outside, small -
on-the-inside basketball pavil
ion. If you're not close to the
stage, the sound can have a
tinny echo. Capacity: about
4500. University of Santa Clara
campus, Santa Clara.
Circle Star Theatre. The re
volving stage earns mixed re
views, though the acoutstics
are good. No rock —R&B, soul
and jaz/ predominate with an
occasional act aimed at the
older crowd. Capacity: approx
imately 2000. 1717 Industrial
Road, San Carlos.
The Farm. Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and Memorial Au
ditorium are not bad places.
Frost Amphitheatre is by far the
best outdoor facility in the Bay
Area. Maples is tolerable as
basketball places go — the spe
cial suspension floor gives any
concert added bounce.


Among the various campus locations for rock concerts, Maples
Pavilion can be one of the more unusual. Its special suspension
flooring designed to protect the knees of basketball players gives a
concert, such as the one by Steven Stills (pictured) a little extra
bounce.

ion. If you're not close to the
stage, the sound can have a
tinny echo. Capacity: about
4500. University of Santa Clara
campus, Santa Clara.
Circle Star Theatre. The re
volving stage earns mixed re
views, though the acoutstics
are good. No rock —R&B, soul
and jaz/ predominate with an
occasional act aimed at the
older crowd. Capacity: approx
imately 2000. 1717 Industrial
Road, San Carlos.
The Farm. Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and Memorial Au
ditorium are not bad places.
Frost Amphitheatre is by far the
best outdoor facility in the Bay
Area. Maples is tolerable as
basketball places go — the spe
cial suspension floor gives any
concert added bounce.


Among the various campus locations for rock concerts, Maples
Pavilion can be one of the more unusual. Its special suspension
flooring designed to protect the knees of basketball players gives a
concert, such as the one by Steven Stills (pictured) a little extra
bounce.
In general, San Francisco and
the Bay Area have an extremely
good reputation in the music
industry. Bands and artists of
varying size and fame often try
to include San Francisco on
their itinerary. A summary of
what you can expect from
facilities and promoters follow:
Cow Palace. A general
purpose, large, basketball-type
auditorium. Only major acts
with a large draw play the Cow
Palace. Parking is a bit of a has
sle, as is traffic when leaving.
Bill Graham tends to use this
place more than other promot
ers. Capacity: about 13,000.
Geneva and Santos, San Fran
cisco (near South San Fran
cisco).
Oakland Coliseum/Stadium.
What can I say about a baseball
stadium? Location of Bill
Graham's Days on the Green,
Great on warm days. Capacity;
about 60,000. The Coliseum is
the basketball/hockey part of
the complex. It is much like the
Cow Palace, except nicer and
newer. Capacity: approxi
mately 16,000. Hegenberger
Road and Highway 17, Oak
land.
Zellerbach Auditorium.
Nice, nice, very nice. An acous
tically superb auditorium.
Tends to have more mellow
acts. Capacity: 3500. UC-
Berkeley campus.
Greek Theatre. Pleasant set
ting in the design of an ancient
Greek amphitheatre. Can be a
bit uncomfortable on a very hot
day. The building stone some
times bounces the sound
around. Capacity: about 9000,
UC-Berkeley campus.
Paramount Theatre. An ex
tremely comfortable and enjoy
able place to hear good music in
the heart of Oakland. One of
the best. Capacity: approxi
mately 3200. Broadway and
West Grand, Oakland.
Berkeley Community
Theatre. Another great one.

Not lis new as Zellerbach, but
newer than the Paramount. Ex
cellent acoustics. Capacity: ap
proximately 3500. Ashton and
Grove, Berkeley.
Concord Pavilion. An in
teresting combination of out
door reserved and "festival"
seating. It includes a covered
section of seats with a sur
rounding and separated grass
area. The sound in the reserved
seats is sometimes made too
lound so that the "festival"
seats can hear. Capacity: ap
proximately 5000. 2000 Kirker
Pass Road, Concord.
San Jose Civic Auditorium.
A basketball, boxing and wre
stling auditorium. Much like
Winterland acoustically with a
similar layout. Capacity: about
2750. Market and West Carlos,
San Jose.
Center for the Performing
Arts. In my opinion, the best
auditorium in the Bay Area.
Less than seven years old, with
comfortable seats. A real joy.
Capacity: approximately 3000.
Almaden and Park, San Jose.
Leavey Center. A newish,
large-on- the-outside, small -
on-the-inside basketball pavil
ion. If you're not close to the
stage, the sound can have a
tinny echo. Capacity: about
4500. University of Santa Clara
campus, Santa Clara.
Circle Star Theatre. The re
volving stage earns mixed re
views, though the acoutstics
are good. No rock —R&B, soul
and jaz/ predominate with an
