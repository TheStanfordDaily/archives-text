Newark has discos. Cleveland has
discos. Omaha has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capable of ac
comodating Led Zeppelin. Seattle has a
really big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless) acts like
Aerosmith in there. Los Angeles has
two stadiums capable of accomodating
Aerosmith if you count Anaheim (the
Rams did).
And every place has symphonies, al
beit of varied quality. Every place also
has Roller Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most every
thing, if you look long enough — even
the most branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance aside, it
just goes to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place. Maybe
out there you can't get what you want,
but you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs, that is.
San Francisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this city from every inha
bited community outside New York
state lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance, which holds
somewhere near eight times as many
inhabitants, and it offers more variety
than LA, tor example, which holds eight
times as many human beings. No one
knows why this is true of course, except
for the occasional smartass who argues
that San Franciscans are a race of sup
remely intelligent hippie freaks —
whatever the reason, it remains a True
Fact that nightclubs here are thriving.
There are, again, many species in the
nightclub genus. We have, for example,
sleazy dives where you can simulate liv
ing in Detroit, and more than our share
of establishments catering to the Carol
Doda crowd. And if you went to Exeter,
no need to worry, there are exclusive
places, where obloquy and scorn await a
fool without a tie.
And between these extremes — hold
your breath — the City has upwards of a
billion zillion "miscellaneous" night
clubs, ranging all the way from the red
velvet-and-Frank Gorshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the jump-up-and
dow n, pa ra I yzed - to r-1 i fe, w ha t-ki nd -of
funny-pills-did-you-say-they-were?
Oh-my-god-they're-turning-in to
reptiles contentment of Mabuhay Gar
dens.
San Francisco, in short, has manv,
many establishments designed to pro
vide you with entertainment and/or
dancing and/or grounds for imbibing at
night.
Of course it is very hard to find one's
way around when one doesn't always
know where to go. It isn't always good
to have a billion zillion nightclubs if your

conferees issue doesn't at least include a
guide to the good ones.
On that note, we begin to draw the
noose. . . .
Did I happen to hear someone out
there ask for nightclub advice? You in
the back with calculator in one hand and
Michelob in the other? Very good. There
urc several such establishments between
here and Marin County that could do
with special mention — if you insist, I
will force myself to reveal the location of
a few.
The Great American Music Hall, the
Old Waldorf, the Keystone Berkeley,
the Keystone Palo Alto, Bimbo's in the
City, Keystone Korner and Christo's
come instantaneously to mind. Oh yes,
and there's the Bistro, and the Palms,
and. . . .
Excuse me, do I see another hand?
You in the warm-up suit? Yes, 1 do sup
pose it's true that a laundry list won't
help much, owing to considerable di
versity as to what in reality constitutes a
truly mythical experience beyond any
one's wildest dreams. I see your point.
Some people value dancing space more
than they value perfect acoustics, and
that does make it difficult to give
worthwhile advice. Almost makes it im
possible, in fact.
But wait. Most people here have
never even been to a nightclub, and for
that reason it would do you good if I
listed what you should look for. There
are immutable principles in any busi
ness. So go grab a pencil, or grab a friend
with a pencil, and write down all of the
following. Please? What follows are the
rules by which one should judge a
nightclub (examples included). Ahem.
Rule number one of nightclub choos
ery specifically prohibits parties of the
first part from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with high
boredom quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that nightclubs depend
on medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has to do
only with album sales, however, as does
the "high fame quotient" — the'point is
that you ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out anyway,
if they play in a nightclub, so what true
clubbers ought to do is experiment with
their ears.
And you should know in advance that
rule number two is tough for a great
many people. It requires that you admit
the existence of a flaw. Yet it /s impor
tant, and we should shed our miscon
ceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite the popu
larity of component stereo systems with
multi-colored dials and switches, most
of humanity is unable to tell a good
sound system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that although
sound systems vary in nightclubs, to

most people it doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The Great
American Music Hall and the Old Wal
dorf have acoustic drawbacks, despite
their shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever hear any
one complain about it? At the Old Wal
dorf — a favorite haunt for Peter Tosh I
Patti Smith / Warren Zevon types — it is
surprising how badly the music is mixed
("mixing" is related to amplification
which has to do with electricity. OK?)
And Great America's beautiful gold-leaf
interior can sometimes send a trumpet
solo into an ear in a disconcerting mo
ment.
But both places simply don't need per
fect acoustics, because there are very
few perfect ears. Those so blessed can
find what they need at nearly every jazz
club. (Keystone Korner for example.
That's a jazz place, and one of the best
anywhere. Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they need it,
but other places don't).
So that's rule two, to be noted espe
cially by rock fans — it doesn't make
much difference if the weak middle
range of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential to know
what kind of crowd you like. There's a
world of difference between Mabuhay
Gardens — variety crowds and the rest
of mankind as we know and love it, for
example — you have to know which ilk
you really enjoy or else it coud destroy
an evening.
The Mabuhay is a perfect example.
There is music, to be sure, though neo
fascists prefer to call it "sick punk rock
crap." But sometimes it seems as jf the
music is less of an attraction than the
seething masses themselves. The
Mabuhay has a distinctive crowd, to say
the least, and bridge players would be
uncomfortable. The music doe* attain
near-mythic status with greater than av
erage frequency, but if you're looking
foran evening free of flying ashtrays this
simply isn't your place.
The Keystone Palo Alto has more of a
straight rock crowd — kids who've seen
the Greg Kihn Band 49 times in the last
two years — but it's a good, not-too
sedate club, and it has the added advan
tage of being close by, unlike the
Mabuhay, where you have to drive up to
the City in order to get your face
threatened by sharp objects.
The sound system at the Keystone is
loud — in order to aid that Communist
conspiracy (sometimes called rock 'n'
roll) aimed at destroying the ears and
morals ot America's youth (oh, what are
they doing to us, ma?) The Keystone
features most of the hot local acts (such
as the Rubinoos and Greg Kihn) as well
as occasional big names (like George
Thorogood, Chuck Berry and Roy
Buchanon). Tickets run in $5.50 to $7.50
price range.
The Great American Music Hall is re
latively calm, and the Waldorf is
rowdy-but-controlled, and surpris
ingly, even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations.
That doesn't mean that Herb Alpert
could play the Mabuhay and bring the
world to an end, or that Johnny Rotten

wouldn't notice that things were quieter
in the Venetian Room, but certain clubs
do have certain types of crowds, and
they tend to be distinctive.
Differences in food and drink prices
begat rule number three. And 10, the
multitudes were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required when re
turn is made to Palo Alto, and they were
told that they would have to sleep in an
alley. And the multitude adhered to the
commandments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule number four,
everybody got the Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you like you
wanted to be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID check and
the jerk who laughs and says you don't
look 13 can be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space might turn
things around. Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmosphere, once
you've made up your mind as to your
definition of "pleasant."
In any case, check a few of these
places out. It could be edifying, maybe.
Sooner or later your myth is bound to
come up.
Now for some editorializing. David
Allen runs the Boarding House, the
finest club in San Francisco. There are
other clubs and other owners who damn
near hold their own with Allen, but for
now he has a corner on the building
run-by-a-patriarch-of-Ihe-stars mar
ket.
After all, either the man or his edifice
has helped launch the careers of Kenny
Rankin, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor,
Richard Klein and Steve Martin — the
BH has frequently been described as
"the perfect comedy room," and its
reputation is deserved.
The Boarding House is an empty
looking place with dirty walls that sits
between and underneath some dumpy
looking buildings on Bush Street in San
Francisco. Vet once a show starts there all
architectural grumbling ceases. The
tunny walls, it becomes apparent, are
funny because they are acoustically per
fect, so much so that even the deafest
among us will marvel at the sound. The
BH is a relatively small club, with a
capacity of only about 2()0 people, yet it
was the site of performances by Neil
Young and Steve Martin.
Boarding House tickets generally run
about $6 a show, though they vary ac
cording to the stature and lust for wealth
of whoever is appearing. Allen runs a
restaurant downstairs for those who
wish to bribe their way into front-row
seats. (Eat tirst, sit close to the stage. It
works like that). In addition to comedy
the BH features nearly everything else
that moves — they have rock, rock-folk,
and folk-intlected-rock-soul; they have
occasional bad acts and generally good
acts, and a lot of sleeper sensations.
And if this reads like an A-l exercise
in Korean influence peddling to you,
well tough. Every critic (!) has his favo
rite, and this place deserves one hell of a
plug. So here it is — the Boarding
House, on Bush Street, is a quality
nightclub. All self-respecting night club
groupies will swear by it. Go there.


The Keystone Palo Alto is one of many night clubs in the Bay Area. It features jazz and
a good blend of rock 'n' roll, and is located nearby.

Newark has discos. Cleveland has
discos. Omaha has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capable of ac
comodating Led Zeppelin. Seattle has a
really big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless) acts like
Aerosmith in there. Los Angeles has
two stadiums capable of accomodating
Aerosmith if you count Anaheim (the
Rams did).
And every place has symphonies, al
beit of varied quality. Every place also
has Roller Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most every
thing, if you look long enough — even
the most branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to see that this

just goes to show that it was a mistake to

uncomfortable. The music doe* attain
near-mythic status with greater than av
erage frequency, but if you're looking
foran evening free of flying ashtrays this
simply isn't your place.
The Keystone Palo Alto has more of a
straight rock crowd — kids who've seen
the Greg Kihn Band 49 times in the last
two years — but it's a good, not-too
sedate club, and it has the added advan
tage of being close by, unlike the
Mabuhay, where you have to drive up to
the City in order to get your face
threatened by sharp objects.
The sound system at the Keystone is
loud — in order to aid that Communist
conspiracy (sometimes called rock 'n'
roll) aimed at destroying the ears and
morals ot America's youth (oh, what are
they doing to us, ma?) The Keystone
features most of the hot local acts (such
as the Rubinoos and Greg Kihn) as well
as occasional big names (like George
Thorogood, Chuck Berry and Roy
Buchanon). Tickets run in $5.50 to $7.50
price range.
The Great American Music Hall is re
latively calm, and the Waldorf is
rowdy-but-controlled, and surpris
ingly, even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations.
That doesn't mean that Herb Alpert
could play the Mabuhay and bring the
world to an end, or that Johnny Rotten

wouldn't notice that things were quieter
in the Venetian Room, but certain clubs
do have certain types of crowds, and
they tend to be distinctive.
Differences in food and drink prices
begat rule number three. And 10, the
multitudes were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required when re
turn is made to Palo Alto, and they were
told that they would have to sleep in an
alley. And the multitude adhered to the
commandments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule number four,
everybody got the Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you like you
wanted to be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID check and
the jerk who laughs and says you don't
look 13 can be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space might turn
things around. Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmosphere, once
you've made up your mind as to your
definition of "pleasant."
In any case, check a few of these
places out. It could be edifying, maybe.
Sooner or later your myth is bound to
come up.
Now for some editorializing. David
Allen runs the Boarding House, the
finest club in San Francisco. There are
other clubs and other owners who damn
near hold their own with Allen, but for
now he has a corner on the building
run-by-a-patriarch-of-Ihe-stars mar
ket.
After all, either the man or his edifice
has helped launch the careers of Kenny
Rankin, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor,
Richard Klein and Steve Martin — the
BH has frequently been described as
"the perfect comedy room," and its
reputation is deserved.
The Boarding House is an empty
looking place with dirty walls that sits
between and underneath some dumpy
looking buildings on Bush Street in San
Francisco. Vet once a show starts there all
architectural grumbling ceases. The
tunny walls, it becomes apparent, are
funny because they are acoustically per
fect, so much so that even the deafest
among us will marvel at the sound. The
BH is a relatively small club, with a
capacity of only about 2()0 people, yet it
was the site of performances by Neil
Young and Steve Martin.
Boarding House tickets generally run
about $6 a show, though they vary ac
cording to the stature and lust for wealth
of whoever is appearing. Allen runs a
restaurant downstairs for those who
wish to bribe their way into front-row
seats. (Eat tirst, sit close to the stage. It
works like that). In addition to comedy
the BH features nearly everything else
that moves — they have rock, rock-folk,
and folk-intlected-rock-soul; they have
occasional bad acts and generally good
acts, and a lot of sleeper sensations.
And if this reads like an A-l exercise
in Korean influence peddling to you,
well tough. Every critic (!) has his favo
rite, and this place deserves one hell of a
plug. So here it is — the Boarding
House, on Bush Street, is a quality
nightclub. All self-respecting night club
groupies will swear by it. Go there.


The Keystone Palo Alto is one of many night clubs in the Bay Area. It features jazz and
a good blend of rock 'n' roll, and is located nearby.

Newark has discos. Cleveland has
discos. Omaha has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capable of ac
comodating Led Zeppelin. Seattle has a
really big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless) acts like
Aerosmith in there. Los Angeles has
two stadiums capable of accomodating
Aerosmith if you count Anaheim (the
Rams did).
And every place has symphonies, al
beit of varied quality. Every place also
has Roller Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most every
thing, if you look long enough — even
the most branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance aside, it
just goes to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place. Maybe
out there you can't get what you want,
but you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs, that is.
San Francisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this city from every inha
bited community outside New York
state lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance, which holds
somewhere near eight times as many
inhabitants, and it offers more variety
than LA, tor example, which holds eight
times as many human beings. No one
knows why this is true of course, except
for the occasional smartass who argues
that San Franciscans are a race of sup
remely intelligent hippie freaks —
whatever the reason, it remains a True
Fact that nightclubs here are thriving.
There are, again, many species in the
nightclub genus. We have, for example,
sleazy dives where you can simulate liv
ing in Detroit, and more than our share
of establishments catering to the Carol
Doda crowd. And if you went to Exeter,
no need to worry, there are exclusive
places, where obloquy and scorn await a
fool without a tie.
And between these extremes — hold
your breath — the City has upwards of a
billion zillion "miscellaneous" night
clubs, ranging all the way from the red
velvet-and-Frank Gorshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the jump-up-and
dow n, pa ra I yzed - to r-1 i fe, w ha t-ki nd -of
funny-pills-did-you-say-they-were?
Oh-my-god-they're-turning-in to
reptiles contentment of Mabuhay Gar
dens.
San Francisco, in short, has manv,
many establishments designed to pro
vide you with entertainment and/or
dancing and/or grounds for imbibing at
night.
Of course it is very hard to find one's
way around when one doesn't always
know where to go. It isn't always good
to have a billion zillion nightclubs if your

conferees issue doesn't at least include a
guide to the good ones.
On that note, we begin to draw the
noose. . . .
Did I happen to hear someone out
there ask for nightclub advice? You in
the back with calculator in one hand and
Michelob in the other? Very good. There
urc several such establishments between
here and Marin County that could do
with special mention — if you insist, I
will force myself to reveal the location of
a few.
The Great American Music Hall, the
Old Waldorf, the Keystone Berkeley,
the Keystone Palo Alto, Bimbo's in the
City, Keystone Korner and Christo's
come instantaneously to mind. Oh yes,
and there's the Bistro, and the Palms,
and. . . .
Excuse me, do I see another hand?
You in the warm-up suit? Yes, 1 do sup
pose it's true that a laundry list won't
help much, owing to considerable di
versity as to what in reality constitutes a
truly mythical experience beyond any
one's wildest dreams. I see your point.
Some people value dancing space more
than they value perfect acoustics, and
that does make it difficult to give
worthwhile advice. Almost makes it im
possible, in fact.
But wait. Most people here have
never even been to a nightclub, and for
that reason it would do you good if I
listed what you should look for. There
are immutable principles in any busi
ness. So go grab a pencil, or grab a friend
with a pencil, and write down all of the
following. Please? What follows are the
rules by which one should judge a
nightclub (examples included). Ahem.
Rule number one of nightclub choos
ery specifically prohibits parties of the
first part from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with high
boredom quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that nightclubs depend
on medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has to do
only with album sales, however, as does
the "high fame quotient" — the'point is
that you ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out anyway,
if they play in a nightclub, so what true
clubbers ought to do is experiment with
their ears.
And you should know in advance that
rule number two is tough for a great
many people. It requires that you admit
the existence of a flaw. Yet it /s impor
tant, and we should shed our miscon
ceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite the popu
larity of component stereo systems with
multi-colored dials and switches, most
of humanity is unable to tell a good
sound system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that although
sound systems vary in nightclubs, to

most people it doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The Great
American Music Hall and the Old Wal
dorf have acoustic drawbacks, despite
their shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever hear any
one complain about it? At the Old Wal
dorf — a favorite haunt for Peter Tosh I
Patti Smith / Warren Zevon types — it is
surprising how badly the music is mixed
("mixing" is related to amplification
which has to do with electricity. OK?)
And Great America's beautiful gold-leaf
interior can sometimes send a trumpet
solo into an ear in a disconcerting mo
ment.
But both places simply don't need per
fect acoustics, because there are very
few perfect ears. Those so blessed can
find what they need at nearly every jazz
club. (Keystone Korner for example.
That's a jazz place, and one of the best
anywhere. Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they need it,
but other places don't).
So that's rule two, to be noted espe
cially by rock fans — it doesn't make
much difference if the weak middle
range of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential to know
what kind of crowd you like. There's a
world of difference between Mabuhay
Gardens — variety crowds and the rest
of mankind as we know and love it, for
example — you have to know which ilk
you really enjoy or else it coud destroy
an evening.
The Mabuhay is a perfect example.
There is music, to be sure, though neo
fascists prefer to call it "sick punk rock
crap." But sometimes it seems as jf the
music is less of an attraction than the
seething masses themselves. The
Mabuhay has a distinctive crowd, to say
the least, and bridge players would be
uncomfortable. The music doe* attain
near-mythic status with greater than av
erage frequency, but if you're looking
foran evening free of flying ashtrays this
simply isn't your place.
The Keystone Palo Alto has more of a
straight rock crowd — kids who've seen
the Greg Kihn Band 49 times in the last
two years — but it's a good, not-too
sedate club, and it has the added advan
tage of being close by, unlike the
Mabuhay, where you have to drive up to
the City in order to get your face
threatened by sharp objects.
The sound system at the Keystone is
loud — in order to aid that Communist
conspiracy (sometimes called rock 'n'
roll) aimed at destroying the ears and
morals ot America's youth (oh, what are
they doing to us, ma?) The Keystone
features most of the hot local acts (such
as the Rubinoos and Greg Kihn) as well
as occasional big names (like George
Thorogood, Chuck Berry and Roy
Buchanon). Tickets run in $5.50 to $7.50
price range.
The Great American Music Hall is re
latively calm, and the Waldorf is
rowdy-but-controlled, and surpris
ingly, even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations.
That doesn't mean that Herb Alpert
could play the Mabuhay and bring the
world to an end, or that Johnny Rotten

wouldn't notice that things were quieter
in the Venetian Room, but certain clubs
do have certain types of crowds, and
they tend to be distinctive.
Differences in food and drink prices
begat rule number three. And 10, the
multitudes were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required when re
turn is made to Palo Alto, and they were
told that they would have to sleep in an
alley. And the multitude adhered to the
commandments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule number four,
everybody got the Final Clue. When you

quent the place that treated you like you

power of a pleasant atmosphere, once
you've made up your mind as to your
definition of "pleasant."

Of course it is very hard to find one's
way around when one doesn't always
know where to go. It isn't always good
to have a billion zillion nightclubs if your

conferees issue doesn't at least include a
guide to the good ones.
On that note, we begin to draw the
noose. . . .
Did I happen to hear someone out
there ask for nightclub advice? You in
the back with calculator in one hand and
Michelob in the other? Very good. There
urc several such establishments between
here and Marin County that could do
with special mention — if you insist, I
will force myself to reveal the location of
a few.
The Great American Music Hall, the
Old Waldorf, the Keystone Berkeley,
the Keystone Palo Alto, Bimbo's in the
City, Keystone Korner and Christo's
come instantaneously to mind. Oh yes,
and there's the Bistro, and the Palms,
and. . . .
Excuse me, do I see another hand?
You in the warm-up suit? Yes, 1 do sup
pose it's true that a laundry list won't
help much, owing to considerable di
versity as to what in reality constitutes a
truly mythical experience beyond any
one's wildest dreams. I see your point.
Some people value dancing space more
than they value perfect acoustics, and
that does make it difficult to give
worthwhile advice. Almost makes it im
possible, in fact.
But wait. Most people here have
never even been to a nightclub, and for
that reason it would do you good if I
listed what you should look for. There
are immutable principles in any busi
ness. So go grab a pencil, or grab a friend
with a pencil, and write down all of the
following. Please? What follows are the
rules by which one should judge a
nightclub (examples included). Ahem.
Rule number one of nightclub choos
ery specifically prohibits parties of the
first part from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with high
boredom quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that nightclubs depend
on medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has to do
only with album sales, however, as does
the "high fame quotient" — the'point is
that you ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out anyway,
if they play in a nightclub, so what true
clubbers ought to do is experiment with
their ears.
And you should know in advance that
rule number two is tough for a great
many people. It requires that you admit
the existence of a flaw. Yet it /s impor
tant, and we should shed our miscon
ceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite the popu
larity of component stereo systems with
multi-colored dials and switches, most
of humanity is unable to tell a good
sound system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that although
sound systems vary in nightclubs, to

most people it doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The Great
American Music Hall and the Old Wal
dorf have acoustic drawbacks, despite
their shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever hear any
one complain about it? At the Old Wal
dorf — a favorite haunt for Peter Tosh I
Patti Smith / Warren Zevon types — it is
surprising how badly the music is mixed
("mixing" is related to amplification
which has to do with electricity. OK?)
And Great America's beautiful gold-leaf
interior can sometimes send a trumpet
solo into an ear in a disconcerting mo
ment.
But both places simply don't need per
fect acoustics, because there are very
few perfect ears. Those so blessed can
find what they need at nearly every jazz
club. (Keystone Korner for example.
That's a jazz place, and one of the best
anywhere. Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they need it,
but other places don't).
So that's rule two, to be noted espe
cially by rock fans — it doesn't make
much difference if the weak middle
range of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential to know
what kind of crowd you like. There's a
world of difference between Mabuhay
Gardens — variety crowds and the rest
of mankind as we know and love it, for
example — you have to know which ilk
you really enjoy or else it coud destroy
an evening.
The Mabuhay is a perfect example.
There is music, to be sure, though neo
fascists prefer to call it "sick punk rock
crap." But sometimes it seems as jf the
music is less of an attraction than the
seething masses themselves. The
Mabuhay has a distinctive crowd, to say
the least, and bridge players would be
uncomfortable. The music doe* attain
near-mythic status with greater than av
erage frequency, but if you're looking
foran evening free of flying ashtrays this
simply isn't your place.
The Keystone Palo Alto has more of a
straight rock crowd — kids who've seen
the Greg Kihn Band 49 times in the last
two years — but it's a good, not-too
sedate club, and it has the added advan
tage of being close by, unlike the
Mabuhay, where you have to drive up to
the City in order to get your face
threatened by sharp objects.
The sound system at the Keystone is
loud — in order to aid that Communist
conspiracy (sometimes called rock 'n'
roll) aimed at destroying the ears and
morals ot America's youth (oh, what are
they doing to us, ma?) The Keystone
features most of the hot local acts (such
as the Rubinoos and Greg Kihn) as well
as occasional big names (like George
Thorogood, Chuck Berry and Roy
Buchanon). Tickets run in $5.50 to $7.50
price range.
The Great American Music Hall is re
latively calm, and the Waldorf is
rowdy-but-controlled, and surpris
ingly, even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations.
That doesn't mean that Herb Alpert
could play the Mabuhay and bring the
world to an end, or that Johnny Rotten

wouldn't notice that things were quieter
in the Venetian Room, but certain clubs
do have certain types of crowds, and
they tend to be distinctive.
Differences in food and drink prices
begat rule number three. And 10, the
multitudes were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required when re
turn is made to Palo Alto, and they were
told that they would have to sleep in an
alley. And the multitude adhered to the
commandments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule number four,
everybody got the Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you like you
wanted to be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID check and
the jerk who laughs and says you don't
look 13 can be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space might turn
things around. Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmosphere, once
you've made up your mind as to your
definition of "pleasant."
In any case, check a few of these
places out. It could be edifying, maybe.
Sooner or later your myth is bound to
come up.
Now for some editorializing. David
Allen runs the Boarding House, the
finest club in San Francisco. There are
other clubs and other owners who damn
near hold their own with Allen, but for
now he has a corner on the building
run-by-a-patriarch-of-Ihe-stars mar
ket.
After all, either the man or his edifice
has helped launch the careers of Kenny
Rankin, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor,
Richard Klein and Steve Martin — the
BH has frequently been described as
"the perfect comedy room," and its
reputation is deserved.
The Boarding House is an empty
looking place with dirty walls that sits
between and underneath some dumpy
looking buildings on Bush Street in San
Francisco. Vet once a show starts there all
architectural grumbling ceases. The
tunny walls, it becomes apparent, are
funny because they are acoustically per
fect, so much so that even the deafest
among us will marvel at the sound. The
BH is a relatively small club, with a
capacity of only about 2()0 people, yet it
was the site of performances by Neil
Young and Steve Martin.
Boarding House tickets generally run
about $6 a show, though they vary ac
cording to the stature and lust for wealth
of whoever is appearing. Allen runs a
restaurant downstairs for those who
wish to bribe their way into front-row
seats. (Eat tirst, sit close to the stage. It
works like that). In addition to comedy
the BH features nearly everything else
that moves — they have rock, rock-folk,
and folk-intlected-rock-soul; they have
occasional bad acts and generally good
acts, and a lot of sleeper sensations.
And if this reads like an A-l exercise
in Korean influence peddling to you,
well tough. Every critic (!) has his favo
rite, and this place deserves one hell of a
plug. So here it is — the Boarding
House, on Bush Street, is a quality
nightclub. All self-respecting night club
groupies will swear by it. Go there.


The Keystone Palo Alto is one of many night clubs in the Bay Area. It features jazz and
a good blend of rock 'n' roll, and is located nearby.

Newark has discos. Cleveland has
discos. Omaha has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capable of ac
comodating Led Zeppelin. Seattle has a
really big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless) acts like
Aerosmith in there. Los Angeles has
two stadiums capable of accomodating
Aerosmith if you count Anaheim (the
Rams did).
And every place has symphonies, al
beit of varied quality. Every place also
has Roller Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most every
thing, if you look long enough — even
the most branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance aside, it
just goes to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place. Maybe
out there you can't get what you want,
but you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs, that is.
San Francisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this city from every inha
bited community outside New York
state lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance, which holds
somewhere near eight times as many
inhabitants, and it offers more variety
than LA, tor example, which holds eight
times as many human beings. No one
knows why this is true of course, except
for the occasional smartass who argues
that San Franciscans are a race of sup
remely intelligent hippie freaks —
whatever the reason, it remains a True
Fact that nightclubs here are thriving.
There are, again, many species in the
nightclub genus. We have, for example,
sleazy dives where you can simulate liv
ing in Detroit, and more than our share
of establishments catering to the Carol
Doda crowd. And if you went to Exeter,
no need to worry, there are exclusive
places, where obloquy and scorn await a
fool without a tie.
And between these extremes — hold
your breath — the City has upwards of a
billion zillion "miscellaneous" night
clubs, ranging all the way from the red
velvet-and-Frank Gorshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the jump-up-and
dow n, pa ra I yzed - to r-1 i fe, w ha t-ki nd -of
funny-pills-did-you-say-they-were?
Oh-my-god-they're-turning-in to
reptiles contentment of Mabuhay Gar
dens.
San Francisco, in short, has manv,
many establishments designed to pro
vide you with entertainment and/or
dancing and/or grounds for imbibing at
night.
Of course it is very hard to find one's

Now for some editorializing. David
Allen runs the Boarding House, the
finest club in San Francisco. There are
other clubs and other owners who damn
near hold their own with Allen, but for
now he has a corner on the building
run-by-a-patriarch-of-Ihe-stars mar
ket.
After all, either the man or his edifice
has helped launch the careers of Kenny
Rankin, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor,
Richard Klein and Steve Martin — the
BH has frequently been described as
"the perfect comedy room," and its
reputation is deserved.
The Boarding House is an empty
looking place with dirty walls that sits
between and underneath some dumpy
looking buildings on Bush Street in San
Francisco. Vet once a show starts there all
architectural grumbling ceases. The
tunny walls, it becomes apparent, are
funny because they are acoustically per
fect, so much so that even the deafest
among us will marvel at the sound. The
BH is a relatively small club, with a
capacity of only about 2()0 people, yet it
was the site of performances by Neil
Young and Steve Martin.
Boarding House tickets generally run
about $6 a show, though they vary ac
cording to the stature and lust for wealth
of whoever is appearing. Allen runs a
restaurant downstairs for those who
wish to bribe their way into front-row
seats. (Eat tirst, sit close to the stage. It
works like that). In addition to comedy
the BH features nearly everything else
that moves — they have rock, rock-folk,
and folk-intlected-rock-soul; they have
occasional bad acts and generally good
acts, and a lot of sleeper sensations.
And if this reads like an A-l exercise
in Korean influence peddling to you,
well tough. Every critic (!) has his favo
rite, and this place deserves one hell of a
plug. So here it is — the Boarding
House, on Bush Street, is a quality
nightclub. All self-respecting night club
groupies will swear by it. Go there.


The Keystone Palo Alto is one of many night clubs in the Bay Area. It features jazz and
a good blend of rock 'n' roll, and is located nearby.

Newark has discos. Cleveland has
discos. Omaha has discos. Even Mar
riot's Great America has discos.
Houston has a stadium capable of ac
comodating Led Zeppelin. Seattle has a
really big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless) acts like
Aerosmith in there. Los Angeles has
two stadiums capable of accomodating
Aerosmith if you count Anaheim (the
Rams did).
And every place has symphonies, al
beit of varied quality. Every place also
has Roller Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most every
thing, if you look long enough — even
the most branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance aside, it
just goes to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place. Maybe
out there you can't get what you want,
but you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs, that is.
San Francisco's nightclubs, even more
than Herb Caen and the Zodiac Killer,
distinguish this city from every inha
bited community outside New York
state lines. The City has more night
clubs than LA, for instance, which holds
somewhere near eight times as many
inhabitants, and it offers more variety
than LA, tor example, which holds eight
times as many human beings. No one
knows why this is true of course, except
for the occasional smartass who argues
that San Franciscans are a race of sup
remely intelligent hippie freaks —
whatever the reason, it remains a True
Fact that nightclubs here are thriving.
There are, again, many species in the
nightclub genus. We have, for example,
sleazy dives where you can simulate liv
ing in Detroit, and more than our share
of establishments catering to the Carol
Doda crowd. And if you went to Exeter,
no need to worry, there are exclusive
places, where obloquy and scorn await a
fool without a tie.
And between these extremes — hold
your breath — the City has upwards of a
billion zillion "miscellaneous" night
clubs, ranging all the way from the red
velvet-and-Frank Gorshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the jump-up-and
dow n, pa ra I yzed - to r-1 i fe, w ha t-ki nd -of
funny-pills-did-you-say-they-were?
Oh-my-god-they're-turning-in to
reptiles contentment of Mabuhay Gar
dens.
San Francisco, in short, has manv,
many establishments designed to pro
vide you with entertainment and/or
dancing and/or grounds for imbibing at
night.
Of course it is very hard to find one's
way around when one doesn't always
know where to go. It isn't always good
to have a billion zillion nightclubs if your

conferees issue doesn't at least include a
guide to the good ones.
On that note, we begin to draw the
noose. . . .
Did I happen to hear someone out
there ask for nightclub advice? You in
the back with calculator in one hand and
Michelob in the other? Very good. There
urc several such establishments between
here and Marin County that could do
with special mention — if you insist, I
will force myself to reveal the location of
a few.
The Great American Music Hall, the
Old Waldorf, the Keystone Berkeley,
the Keystone Palo Alto, Bimbo's in the
City, Keystone Korner and Christo's
come instantaneously to mind. Oh yes,
and there's the Bistro, and the Palms,
and. . . .
Excuse me, do I see another hand?
You in the warm-up suit? Yes, 1 do sup
pose it's true that a laundry list won't
help much, owing to considerable di
versity as to what in reality constitutes a
truly mythical experience beyond any
one's wildest dreams. I see your point.
Some people value dancing space more
than they value perfect acoustics, and
that does make it difficult to give
worthwhile advice. Almost makes it im
possible, in fact.
But wait. Most people here have
never even been to a nightclub, and for
that reason it would do you good if I
listed what you should look for. There
are immutable principles in any busi
ness. So go grab a pencil, or grab a friend
with a pencil, and write down all of the
following. Please? What follows are the
rules by which one should judge a
nightclub (examples included). Ahem.
Rule number one of nightclub choos
ery specifically prohibits parties of the
first part from following only high fame
quotient stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with high
boredom quotient warm-up acts — you
must remember that nightclubs depend
on medium-small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has to do
only with album sales, however, as does
the "high fame quotient" — the'point is
that you ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out anyway,
if they play in a nightclub, so what true
clubbers ought to do is experiment with
their ears.
And you should know in advance that
rule number two is tough for a great
many people. It requires that you admit
the existence of a flaw. Yet it /s impor
tant, and we should shed our miscon
ceptions eventually.
So remember this — despite the popu
larity of component stereo systems with
multi-colored dials and switches, most
of humanity is unable to tell a good
sound system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that although
sound systems vary in nightclubs, to

most people it doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The Great
American Music Hall and the Old Wal
dorf have acoustic drawbacks, despite
their shared habit of featuring high
quality acts. But did you ever hear any
one complain about it? At the Old Wal
dorf — a favorite haunt for Peter Tosh I
Patti Smith / Warren Zevon types — it is
surprising how badly the music is mixed
("mixing" is related to amplification
which has to do with electricity. OK?)
And Great America's beautiful gold-leaf
interior can sometimes send a trumpet
solo into an ear in a disconcerting mo
ment.
But both places simply don't need per
fect acoustics, because there are very
few perfect ears. Those so blessed can
find what they need at nearly every jazz
club. (Keystone Korner for example.
That's a jazz place, and one of the best
anywhere. Jazz places are frequented by
people who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they need it,
but other places don't).
So that's rule two, to be noted espe
cially by rock fans — it doesn't make
much difference if the weak middle
range of a system is matched by a
blown-out middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential to know
what kind of crowd you like. There's a
world of difference between Mabuhay
Gardens — variety crowds and the rest
of mankind as we know and love it, for
example — you have to know which ilk
you really enjoy or else it coud destroy
an evening.
The Mabuhay is a perfect example.
There is music, to be sure, though neo
fascists prefer to call it "sick punk rock
crap." But sometimes it seems as jf the
music is less of an attraction than the
seething masses themselves. The
Mabuhay has a distinctive crowd, to say
the least, and bridge players would be
uncomfortable. The music doe* attain
near-mythic status with greater than av
erage frequency, but if you're looking
foran evening free of flying ashtrays this
simply isn't your place.
The Keystone Palo Alto has more of a
straight rock crowd — kids who've seen
the Greg Kihn Band 49 times in the last
two years — but it's a good, not-too
sedate club, and it has the added advan
tage of being close by, unlike the
Mabuhay, where you have to drive up to
the City in order to get your face
threatened by sharp objects.
The sound system at the Keystone is
loud — in order to aid that Communist
conspiracy (sometimes called rock 'n'
roll) aimed at destroying the ears and
morals ot America's youth (oh, what are
they doing to us, ma?) The Keystone
features most of the hot local acts (such
as the Rubinoos and Greg Kihn) as well
as occasional big names (like George
Thorogood, Chuck Berry and Roy
Buchanon). Tickets run in $5.50 to $7.50
price range.
The Great American Music Hall is re
latively calm, and the Waldorf is
rowdy-but-controlled, and surpris
ingly, even cross-over crowds are af
fected by these reputations.
That doesn't mean that Herb Alpert
could play the Mabuhay and bring the
world to an end, or that Johnny Rotten

wouldn't notice that things were quieter
in the Venetian Room, but certain clubs
do have certain types of crowds, and
they tend to be distinctive.
Differences in food and drink prices
begat rule number three. And 10, the
multitudes were told not to forget that
gasoline is sometimes required when re
turn is made to Palo Alto, and they were
told that they would have to sleep in an
alley. And the multitude adhered to the
commandments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find out
the drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule number four,
everybody got the Final Clue. When you
choose a club, and like it, go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you like you
wanted to be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy ID check and
the jerk who laughs and says you don't
look 13 can be considerable, and a place
that has extra dancing space might turn
things around. Never underestimate the
power of a pleasant atmosphere, once
you've made up your mind as to your
definition of "pleasant."
In any case, check a few of these
places out. It could be edifying, maybe.
Sooner or later your myth is bound to
come up.
Now for some editorializing. David
Allen runs the Boarding House, the

other clubs and other owners who damn

The Boarding House is an empty

architectural grumbling ceases. The

fect, so much so that even the deafest

Boarding House tickets generally run
about $6 a show, though they vary ac
cording to the stature and lust for wealth
of whoever is appearing. Allen runs a
restaurant downstairs for those who
wish to bribe their way into front-row
