have appeared in the Daily this
year. Prices quoted are approx

range in any particular restaur
ant. Bon apetit!
Frozen Yogurt
Within biking distance of
campus, there are several estab
lishments which offer frozen
yogurt as an alternative to ice
cream.
However, not all frozen
yogurt is alike. It varies tre
mendously in taste, quality,
price and nutritional value.
TRESIDDER
Stanford Campus
Stale toppings, high prices
and low quality yogurt were
what we found at Tresidder.
They serve Knudsen yogurt, in
famous in the yogurt world for
its unhealthful additives, such
as gums, excessive stabilizers,
corn syrup and refined sugar.
Here we found the highest
price around: a staggering 19
cents per ounce.
YOGURT VILLAGE
4546 El Camino Real
Los Altos
948-1790
This store was the only one
which had a chocolate flavor
made without sugar. It tasted
creamy, like soft frosty ice
cream. A cantelope-half, filled
with yogurt and covered with
toppings, is one of their special
ties. Seventeen cents per
ounce.
Yogurt Village is opening a
new branch at the Stanford
Shopping Center in early July.
It will offer eight flavors and 26
toppings.

DOWNTOWN YOGURT
SHOPPE
107 Town and Country Village
Palo Alto
327-2558
This shop, which serves
Alta-Dena vogurt, serves daily
a variety of flavors and top
pings as well as yogurt sundaes
and pies. Lemon, strawberry
and peaches and cream flavors
were sampled. The lemon was
tangy though chalky tasting,
strawberry was very refreshing
and the combination of peach,
and vanilla yogurts was re
miniscent of fresh peaches with
cream.
Prices were 16 cents per
ounce. Downtown is open 11
a.m.-10 p.m., six days a week
and 12-9 p.m. on Sunday.
SWENSEN'S
440 University Ave.
Palo Alto
328-6869
Offering a hand-packed fro
zen yogurt dessert, Swensen's
was disappointing. The flavors
were too sugary and
processed-tasting, even though
the yogurt had been made on
the premises. Average prices;
14 cents per ounce.
BASKIN-ROBBINS
267 University Ave.
Palo Alto
325-2100
Although Baskin-Robbin's
frozen yogurt ranked slightly
above that offered by Swen
sen's, it did not come close to
Old Uncle Gaylord's. The "For
Chocolate Lovers Only" flavor
was yogurty tasting and laced
with chocolate bits but it was
not anything special, nor were
any of the other flavors. Thir
teen cents per ounce.

OLD UNCLE GAYLORD'S
636 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-1809
On a side street in Palo Alto,
we found a wonderful surprise:
healthful, hand-cranked,
natural frozen yogurt. It is de
licious and really tastes like
yogurt. Uncle Gaylord's is a de
light for the yogurt and "quality
food" lover.
Yogurt flavors range from the
very tangy and unusual
oliberry to a naturally-sweet
date and honey. Remember the
way that vanilla always smells
in the bottle? That wonderful
smell is the taste of Gaylord's
vanilla frozen yogurt.
For late night yogurt crav
ings, Old Uncle Gaylord's is
open later than any other local
shop — until midnight. Prices
are average, at 14 cents per
ounce.
THE GOOD EARTH
RESTAURANT
185 University Ave.
Palo Alto
321-9449
The Good Earth is one of the
best deals around for frozen
yogurt. They have one daily
flavor of the Alta-Dena brand
yogurt, which has a high nutri
tional value and low calorie and
chemical content. The Good
Earth offers various dishes and
toppings as well as delicious
shakes combining fruit, yogurt
and juice.
In addition to high quality
and convenient location, the
Good Earth has the cheapest
price in the area for frozen
yogurt: 11 cents per ounce. The
restaurant serves frozen yogurt
7:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m., daily.

French
LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiv and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an liors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feu illete
d'Huitre au Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are offered.
As for the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
Elegant French-style beans and
a nicely broiled tomato give a
colorful and textural balance to
the presentation of this dish.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, hot apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.
LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors

d'oeuvres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine. The
Terrine Maison a I'Armagnac was
an unflawed but unexceptional
rendition of home-made pate.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Nortnande (roast duck
flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
All entrees are served with
side dishes of fresh vegetables
and potatoes, which, for once,
were noticeably cooked to per
fection.
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarteaux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pom tries (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75). The excellence
of the coffee was a rare treat.
Les Provinces is a dining ex
perience which can easily com
pete with San Francisco's
French cuisine.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
for two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope of
Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25), Steak
Diane L'Auberge a la Louis
($13.50) and Chicken Saude
with Artichokes and Chives
Jerusalem ($9.25), only begin to
suggest all the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Suzette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95), and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for
what would otherwise be an
uninteresting decor.
LA GUINGUETTE
593 Woodside Road
Redwood City
369-7364
The menu is typically French
and includes such dishes as ter
rine (similar to pate), escargots,
frogs' legs and duck a I'orange
along with more familiar meat
dishes. However, the house
particularly prides itself on its
seafood, fresh daily, and on its
Southern (Provencal) French
cuisine, which requires gener
ous quantities of butter, tomato
and garlic. Provencal cuisine is
not grand; rather it is a particu
lar style of cuisine defainille (fam
ily cooking).
Most entrees are priced from
$8 to $9.50, with two excep
tions: the Bouillabaisse (highy
seasoned fish stew from Marse
ille) and veal in champagne
sauce (sll each). All entrees in
clude the soup of the day, a
plain salad (with a good vinaig
rette dressing) and fresh veget
ables. The soup was leek and
potato on this occasion; the
vegetables were zucchini, car
rots and potatoes — the green
vegetable just barely cooked.
All portions are generous, and
their presentation pleasing to
the eye.
Although the wine list is
small, it comprises French and
California wines; there is also a
California house wine by the
carafe.
The surroundings are pleas
ant and unpretentious, with
subdued lighting and fresh
flowers on each table. The at
mosphere is relaxed, and you
may set your own pace for the
meal; the service, while not per
fect, is good-natured and unob
trusive.
TWO SISTERS CREPERIE
355 State
Los Altos
941-2782
Two Sisters is an excellent
place to escape the noisy, hectic
world for a quiet, relaxing and
casual dinner.
The Two Sisters Creperie is a
delightful dining experience.
The service is friendly and var
ied, with the waitress, man
ager, and one of the chefs all

taking part. The dinners are
solid, but the salads and the de
sserts are the outstanding offer
ings.
The dinner menu features en
tree crepes, with other entrees
— Quiche Lorraine ($5.25) and
Crab Quiche ($5.75) — also of
fered along with a daily special
such as Leg of Lamb ($6.50) or
Prime Rib au jus ($8.50).
There are a variety of appetiz
ing salads to choose from in
cluding a large plate from the
extensive salad bar ($3).
The entree crepes, ranging
from $5.25 to $6.25, include
choice of soup or salad bar, and
rice pilaf. A very nice feature of
the menu is that for an addi
tional $2 the extra hungry diner
can order a second crepe.
The desserts were works of
art. The Jamaican Pleasure
($2.25), a crepe filled with van
illa ice creame, banana slices
sauteed in brown sugar, butter
and rum, topped with a whip
ped cream and nuts, was a trop
ical dream. The Fantasy Fudge
Crepe ($2.25), a warm crepe
stuffed with vanilla ice cream
and smothered in hot fudge
sauce is a must for the sundae
fiend.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices, and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are priced
between $5 and $8, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and co
vered with a light white sauce.
Perfectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average rice
accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is
not masked by heavy sauces.
Both oversalting and oversauc
ing are frequent faults of even
the best French restaurants.
An excellent cup of coffee
rounds out the meal.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the backroom.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and

northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range
in price from $3.95 to $5.50.
Two little known dishes,
Caponadda al tonno (tuna, to
matoes and onions) and insalata
di mare (marinated squids with
shrimps) reflect the important
influence of the sea in the Ita
lian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modes
to's pasta dishes are designed
to be complete meals. In this
case, the waiter's advice is
worth heeding: split the pasta
dish. The Agnolotti alia crema
(round disks of pasta stuffed
with chicken, cheese, and
ham), Gnocchi Verdi al sugo
(small potato flower dumpl
ings), Guanciali al Furtghi (pil
lows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings.
Our top recommendation is
panzotti alia crema di noci stile
manuelina (stuffed pasta with
ricotta and walnut sauce).
The regular mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main
courses fill out Modesto's
menu.
The desserts included the
standard fare of ice cream,
zabaglione, sherberts and creme
caramel.
A fine espresso rounds out the
meal.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft candle
light, and the quiet charm of the
lights of the Bay make Modes
to's well worth returning to.
AUGUSTO'S RESTAURANT
856 West El Camino Real
Mountain View
965-1869
At Augusto's Restaurant, the
initial impression is "tacky." By
the end of the evening the
characterization was more of
"inadvertent home-spun."
Make no mistake, however,
the less formal style does not
compromise the prices. The bill
for two of us, less wine, but in
cluding one drink each, was
$40. Without the<; la carte salad,
and with less expensive de
ssert, that price would be closer
to $30.
The price of the entree (which
averages around $10 or $11) in
cludes a green salad or soup du
jour, and a side dish of vegeta
bles.

Topping off the evening, in
stead of plain black coffee
(which was a little weak), you
could take on a Cafe Nero or
Cafe Diablo.
In short, for the best in haut
cuisine and/or the most formal of
evenings, go somewhere else.
But for good European food, in
a friendly, relaxed atmosphere,
Augusto's is a pleasant even
ing.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quitely
elegant — somewhere in bet
ween a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers,
and candle light and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandana
vian Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread (sl2 for two;
$6.50 for one) provide a unique
dinner alternative.
Dessert was the highpoint of
the meal; Cheesecake, assorted
cakes and pastries (all $1.60),
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream ($1.25) and
Creme Caramel ($1.50) easily
triumph over your calorific con
science.
The Gatehouse also has a
huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for

dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for lunch
from 11:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.;
and for Sunday Brunch from 10
a.m. until 2:30 p.m. For Friday
and Saturday evenings, reser
vations are recommended.
THE PROUD POPOVER
Stanford Shopping Center
Palo Alto
326-0272
The "special" this Monday
evening is stuffed fresh sole
reads the chalk board. Potted
palms flank the wide, white
door into the entry hall of the
Proud Popover at the Stanford
Shopping Center. Cool yellow
walls reflect the flickering light
of the candles and the glint of
the brass holders. Under the ris
ing octagonal rotunda, the col
onial decor provides a pleasant
setting for dinner.
Our attentive and thoughtful
waiter set the mood for the
evening. The atmosphere at the
Popover can be characterized as
warm and conducive to a quiet,
private conversation.
The menu offers variety;
soup, salads, chicken, fish,
prime rib, lamb and vegetables.
Hot, fresh popovers, with but
ter arrived in the bread basekt!
Mixed green salad with a Ched
dar cheese house dressing, and
Clam Chowder, both very
tasty, set us on the path to culi
nary adventure.
The food was prepared well
and served hot at the table. In
addition, each dish was taste
fully arranged.
The Proud Popover serves a
daily lunch of fruit daiquiries,
quiche and salads. They have a
Sunday Brunch menu of four
specialty dishes. It is a moder
ately priced restaurant — din
ners range from $5.75 to $10
and include soup or salad and
vegetable.
So if you are interested in a
quiet dinner or a pleasant lunch
accompanied by excellent ser
vice, try the Proud Popover.
HUGO'S MARKET
Rickey's Hyatt House
Palo Alto
493-8000
One important thing to re
member about Hugo's Market,
go hungry!
In between, you can choose a
variety of entrees ranging from
the expected steaks, New York
(9 oz. $11.95, 12 oz. $14.50) and
Filet Mignon ($14.95) to more
exotic seafood selections such
as Crabmeat Cannelloni Floren
tine ($10.25), pasta shells filled
with crabmeat and spinach.
Attentive, unobtrusive ser
vice continues from the mo
ment you walk in the door
through the free after-dinner
liquer. The wine includes a
good selection of California
wines complete with small
maps of the different wine reg
ions.
Extensive does not quite
cover the range of salad choices
included with the price of the
entree.
The entrees were served with
crisp buttered carrots and crun
chy snow peas, a pleasant side
dish. From the seafood selec
tions, the Barbecued Giant
Prawns ($13.95) were a little bit
of a disappointment.
The New York steak with
sauteed mushrooms was a
satisfying piece of beef, well
cooked and served.
Conservative decor and at
tentive service mark Hugo's
Market.
PAPRIKAS FONO
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
441-1223
Originality and uncom
promising standards have
reaped rewards for Laslo and
Paulette Fono, owners of San
Francisco's most accomplished
moderately-priced restaurant,
located in Ghirardelli's Square.
With faithfulness to old fam
ily recipes, Paprika's Fono pro
vides the diner with a taste of
things different.
In the center of the large din

ing room, suspended over hot
coals hangs a wide cast iron pot,
full of the traditional Hungarian
Gulyas soup (goulash).
Preparation and service are of
the caliber one expects to find in
a higher-priced restaurant.
From the nomadic herdsman
of the Great Plains comes the
most expensive item on the list,
the Hortobagyi Mixed Grill
($11.95), a hearty array of beef
fillet, skewered lamb,
homemade sausage, and ten
der pork steak. Chicken Paprikas
($7.95), the national dish, is
made with a rich paprikas
sauce some may find a little too
different — the Egri Beef Tokany
or Veal Tokany ($6.95 and $8.25
respectively), incorporating
more subtle tastes of red wine
and mushrooms, are recom
mended for those who are look
ing for a less exotic dish.
All but two of the dinner of
ferings are served with Magyar
sour salads (tomato, cucumber
or fresh red beet), and/or side
dishes. The bread is langos
($1.50), a lightly fried peasant
cake you rub with garlic. Be
sure and try it.
Paprika's Fono is open daily
11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday
to 9 p.m. Reservations are not
required.
MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, devoted
clientele Maddalena's is a must
forany self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romania ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.20) we chose Lin
guine Von-
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with sea food ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from such
fish dishes as Sole Meuniere
($9.95) and Sole Florentine with
Shrimp ($10.50) to Chicken al
Forno Arturo ($8.25) and Steak

Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.,
Through Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m., and 6-10 p.m.
FOURNOU'S OVEN
Stanford Court Hotel
905 California
San Francisco
989-1910
Fournou's is a restaurant of
some renown and it deserves its
reputation independent of its
exclusive mother establish
ment.
All areas of the menu are
well-balanced and difficult
choices present themselves
equally in the appetizer and en
tree categories.
Even the wine list is some
thing to get excited about. It
contains perhaps the most
comprehensive listing of small
California wineries of quality.
Chardonnays and cabernets are
especially well-represented.
It is for its dishes "from the
ovens" that Fournou's is fam
ous. In fact the ovens are in
plain sight in the "old" part of
the restaurant.
The dessert selection has
something for everyone — Pro
fiteroles, fresh strawberry tar
telette, brie and even
cheesecake.
Moreover, both the menu
and the wine list offer the
traveler at Stanford Court and
the diner the gastronomique
best of California.
Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279
El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to ev
erything sampled, clearly were
the best items on the menu. Cal
los a la Madriletia (Tripe Madrid
style $2.50), Dabadana Asturiana
(casserole of white beans, ham,
chorizo and pork $2.75) and
Chorizo Salteado (sauteed
chorizo $2.50), are three of the
rarer items in the appetizer
category. Calamares Rebozados
(breaded baby squid with le
mon) is a best buy at $2.50. A
huge plate of the squid would

have been more than enough
for a main course. And they
were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil
and vinegar dressing, is
superb.
Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50.
But opt for the Paella Velcti
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizoand shellfish. The
Paella Maritiera ($16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you
can choose between the classic
flan, the Budin de Pan (bread
pudding) or the Natillas (special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
CASA REAL
721 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-0959
Casa Real is an ideal place for
that quick and inexpensive
meal when you just don't feel
like the local hamburger hang
out. The food is the standard
Mexican restaurant menu, but
it is well prepared and the ser
vice is quite pleasant. The loca
tion, literally right off campus,
is quite convenient too.
Meals can be enjoyed inside
or outside on the patio. Wine
and beer from Mexico compli
ment the meal. The atmosphere
is casual and relaxed.
Lunch is served from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Monday through Fri
day and from 11:30 a.m. t02:30
p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
Dinner, generally under $5, is
served from 6 p.m. until about
10 p.m.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere, La
Posada is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is some
what high (approaching $20 for
dinner for two), at least for a
Mexican restaurant, but the ex
cellence of the food makes it
well worth it. The menu is ex
tensive and diverse, with dis
hes to please most anyone's
tastes.
Some of the house entrees
are particularly noteworthy.
Especially delightful is the La
Posada Tostada which is the
biggest tostada you've probably
ever seen. Do yourself a favor
and only order one. The second
will go to waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the
shopping center from 11:30
p.m. to 11 p.m.

LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita
was run by nuns, with the pro
fits of the restaurant going to
their religious cause. Today the
elderly ladies seem to be ab
sent, but the food is still excel
lent and the service faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super
hot sauce to the tamales, en
chiladas and chile rellenos. An
outstanding value is the gar
gantuan chicken or beef burrito
($3), with grand chunks of meat
in and atop it. Tostadas with
guacamole are very fine as well.
I cannot recommend Estrel
lita highly enough. But a word
of caution: it is difficult to man
age more than two main items
at one sitting. Famous doggie
bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
Chinese and
Oriental
MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View#
969-3232
Among the great conglomer
ation of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining ex
perience in Mountain View.
Mui Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is
the only restaurant in the Un
ited States that features the dis
tinguished Hakka cuisine.
Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prep
aration are the keys to Hakka
food. Sauces and spices are
used to enhance, rather than
smother, the ingredients. Thus
Hakka food successfully com
bines the distinctive charac
teristics of Captonese, Man
darin and other styles of
Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chef's own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang'sSalt Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
the "most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalleled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU's
Corner of El Camino Real
and San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-26%
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine, Chef Chu's is
extremely popular with Stan
ford people because it combines
uncommonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu
sliu pork which is definitively
done at Chef Chu's. Served
with silk-thin crepes, it is dis
tinct from the pancakes found
at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50 for
dinners), Chef Chu's is a lively
and fun place to dine, especially
with a large group of people.
THE CHINA LiON

Palo Alto

China Lion, though only two
and a half years old, is estabish
ing a reputation for excellent
Chinese food. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner

and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Man
darin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner
which include old favorites but
also offer many specialties. And
if you call first and tell them
how many people are in your
group, the owner will prepare
you a specially selected dinner.
In addition, anything not on the
menu will be promptly pre
pared on request.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
for a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5, but it
is worth it to splurge and pay
the $7.25 for the Lobster Chic
ken Ball.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE RE
STAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
premier Nguyen Ton Joan the
Mekong offers 23 entrees and
five soups all reasonably priced
at about $3 a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses

marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never over
power the ingredients' own
character. The distinct but sub
tle spicing and the fresh ingre
dients reflects the great care in
preparation of food at the
Mekong.
Notable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries. The
Mekong offers a very civilized
but casual atmosphere.
MENARA MOROCCAN RE
STAURANT
41 East Gish Road
San Jose
998-1583
« I was a little dubious about
driving to San Jose to review
the Menara Moroccan Restaur
ant, with gas lines what they
are. But once there 1 was treated
to one of the most delicious,
and certainly the most relaxing
dinner 1 have ever eaten.
One has the choice of sitting
on luxurious couch sections
which run along the entire
perimeter of the dining room or
leather floor cushions which are
strewn around the outside half

of the low dining table.
There are three complete
dinners from which to choose.
Le Diner Menara ($13.95), the
specialty of the house, features
lamb and chicken, Le Diner
Rabati ($14.95) features hare
and lamb. And the other dinner
($12.95) offers the choice of one
entree from six, among them
Brochette de Kabab, Tajine de
Lapin Paprika (hare and pap
rika),! and Tajine d' Agneali
Gautama (lamb and onions). The
only stipulation is that all the
guests at one table partake of
the same dinner.
The restaurant was a visual
and gastronomic delight. The
prices are expensive, but the
food is exceptional.
The restaurant is open every
night, except Sunday, from 6 to
10 for dinner. On Friday and
Saturday evenings it features
belly dancers.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced,

roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century
A.D. The Chinese added veget
ables and other ingredients,
and the cuisine became known
as the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars) are
in for a new treat — an entree
bar! Dinner is priced at $4.95
and includes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh veg
etables, including shredded
carrots, onions, celery, cab
bage, bean sprouts and cilan
tro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one
spoke English very well. Col
onel Lee's might be just the tic
ket if you are looking for some
thing truly unusual.
