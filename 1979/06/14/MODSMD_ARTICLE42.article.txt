Frozen Yogurt
Within biking distance of
campus, there are several estab
lishments which offer frozen
yogurt as an alternative to ice
cream.
However, not all frozen
yogurt is alike. It varies tre
mendously in taste, quality,
price and nutritional value.
TRESIDDER
Stanford Campus
Stale toppings, high prices
and low quality yogurt were
what we found at Tresidder.
They serve Knudsen yogurt, in
famous in the yogurt world for
its unhealthful additives, such
as gums, excessive stabilizers,
corn syrup and refined sugar.
Here we found the highest
price around: a staggering 19
cents per ounce.
YOGURT VILLAGE
4546 El Camino Real
Los Altos
948-1790
This store was the only one
which had a chocolate flavor
made without sugar. It tasted
creamy, like soft frosty ice
cream. A cantelope-half, filled
with yogurt and covered with
toppings, is one of their special
ties. Seventeen cents per
ounce.
Yogurt Village is opening a
new branch at the Stanford
Shopping Center in early July.
It will offer eight flavors and 26
toppings.

DOWNTOWN YOGURT
SHOPPE
107 Town and Country Village
Palo Alto
327-2558
This shop, which serves
Alta-Dena vogurt, serves daily
a variety of flavors and top
pings as well as yogurt sundaes
and pies. Lemon, strawberry
and peaches and cream flavors
were sampled. The lemon was
tangy though chalky tasting,
strawberry was very refreshing
and the combination of peach,
and vanilla yogurts was re
miniscent of fresh peaches with
cream.
Prices were 16 cents per
ounce. Downtown is open 11
a.m.-10 p.m., six days a week
and 12-9 p.m. on Sunday.
SWENSEN'S
440 University Ave.
Palo Alto
328-6869
Offering a hand-packed fro
zen yogurt dessert, Swensen's
was disappointing. The flavors
were too sugary and
processed-tasting, even though
the yogurt had been made on
the premises. Average prices;
14 cents per ounce.
BASKIN-ROBBINS
267 University Ave.
Palo Alto
325-2100
Although Baskin-Robbin's
frozen yogurt ranked slightly
above that offered by Swen
sen's, it did not come close to
Old Uncle Gaylord's. The "For
Chocolate Lovers Only" flavor
was yogurty tasting and laced
with chocolate bits but it was
not anything special, nor were
any of the other flavors. Thir
teen cents per ounce.

OLD UNCLE GAYLORD'S
636 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-1809
On a side street in Palo Alto,
we found a wonderful surprise:
healthful, hand-cranked,
natural frozen yogurt. It is de
licious and really tastes like
yogurt. Uncle Gaylord's is a de
light for the yogurt and "quality
food" lover.
Yogurt flavors range from the
very tangy and unusual
oliberry to a naturally-sweet
date and honey. Remember the
way that vanilla always smells
in the bottle? That wonderful
smell is the taste of Gaylord's
vanilla frozen yogurt.
For late night yogurt crav
ings, Old Uncle Gaylord's is
open later than any other local
shop — until midnight. Prices
are average, at 14 cents per
ounce.
THE GOOD EARTH
RESTAURANT
185 University Ave.
Palo Alto
321-9449
The Good Earth is one of the
best deals around for frozen
yogurt. They have one daily
flavor of the Alta-Dena brand
yogurt, which has a high nutri
tional value and low calorie and
chemical content. The Good
Earth offers various dishes and
toppings as well as delicious
shakes combining fruit, yogurt
and juice.
In addition to high quality
and convenient location, the
Good Earth has the cheapest
price in the area for frozen
yogurt: 11 cents per ounce. The
restaurant serves frozen yogurt
7:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m., daily.

French
LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building
on Universiv and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when
the dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an liors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with
asparagus — $6.50) and Feu illete
d'Huitre au Curry (baked oyster
in curry sauce in pastry —
$6.95) are especially nice. Four
delightful soups ($2 to $3.50)
are offered.
As for the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce — $13.75) was truly ex
ceptional, offering another sur
prise — fois gras in the sauce.
Elegant French-style beans and
a nicely broiled tomato give a
colorful and textural balance to
the presentation of this dish.
A good cross section of de
sserts include hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawber
ries, hot apple tart, mousse au
chocolat and selected cheeses.
LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the many over
priced and generally second
rate French restaurants on the
peninsula, Les Provinces has
proved to be one of the finer
exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors

d'oeuvres, ranging in price
from $3 for delicious ham cre
pes to $4 for smoked salmon
and Escargots De Bourgoine. The
Terrine Maison a I'Armagnac was
an unflawed but unexceptional
rendition of home-made pate.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out
side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Nortnande (roast duck
flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and sherry sauce
($11.25).
All entrees are served with
side dishes of fresh vegetables
and potatoes, which, for once,
were noticeably cooked to per
fection.
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts are the follow
ing three items: Tarteaux Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude aux Pom tries (hot
apple tart, $2); and Souffle Grand
Marnier ($3.75). The excellence
of the coffee was a rare treat.
Les Provinces is a dining ex
perience which can easily com
pete with San Francisco's
French cuisine.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on
the Peninsula were La Tour and
Les Provinces. At least one
other, L'Auberge, may deserve
the same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is
considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional conti
nental recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
for two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy
an exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
