# The 						Bay – the Peninsula's air conditioner
## Ravaged by time, pollution and urban swell, now saved from further landfill 
### 
To the Europeans who first explored and later set
tled the San Francisco Peninsula, the Bay must have
seemed a fruitless desolate, loathsome do
main. The surrounding land may have been fertile,
but the expanse of water seemed from the first an
obstacle to progress.
When the Portola-Serra expedition of 1869 disco
vered the Bay, one member noted in his diary that
"The expedition strove to reach Point Reyes, but was
hindered by an immense arm of the sea, which, ex
tending to a great distance inland, compelled them to
make an enormous circuit for that purpose. In con
sequence of this and other difficulties, the greatest of
all being the absolute want of food, the expedition was
compelled to turn back."
At the time of the gold rush, in the 1850 sand after,
so little esteemed was the Bay that submerged lots
were sold by the municipalities of San Francisco and
other cities with the understanding that the purchas
ers would fill in their property and make it "useful."
This practice continued until the early part of this
century, at which time the state legislature was obli
gated to step in and settle the complex inter-municipal
disputes which were flaring around the usage of the
Bay. This resulted only in a juggling of roles, however:
instead of disposing of water rights, the cities could
only acquire them on the condition that "improve
ments" be made within 10 years.
It was not until the last decade that the Bay Area's
citizens started to acquire an appreciation for the blue
expanse. In 1962 the city of Berkeley, following the
lead of a dozen other Bayside communities, formu
lated a plan which would double its land area by filling
in 4000 acres of wetlands. Compared to other propos
als circulating at the time, this was quite a modest sum.

San Mateo County, for example, encouraged by an
impromptu consortium of foothill developers who
were selling the earth removed from their excavations
and truckers who were buying and reselling it at a
profit as Bay fill, had decided to push its shoreline two
to three miles further out into the water.
The Berkeley scheme, however, galvanized a small
but determined group of conservationists into action.
After months of unrelenting effort during which the
group's members consulted engineers, economists,
sociologists and city planners about the necessity of
the fill, they presented their case to the Berkeley City
Council. When the filling plans were withdrawn, the
Save the Bay Movement spread to other communities.
Two years after the movement's inception, the issue
became one of such political potency that a bill was
passed by the state legislature establishing the San
Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Com
mission and calling for a detailed study of the issue.
The Commission was directed to examine "All the
characteristics of the Bay, including . . . the ecological
balance of the Bay, the economic interests in the Bay,
including the needs of the Bay Area population for
industry and employment."
In a report entitled "Smog and Weather," for exam
ple, it was stated that "the waters of the Bay play a
significant part in helping to determine the climate in
the region: they serve as a 'heat reservoir,' moderating
the extremes of temperature; they make possible the
smooth flow of cooling winds from the ocean; and
their existence helps prevent smog."
If as little as 25 per cent of the Bay were filled, the
report said, a significant increase in summertime
temperatures and a decrease in both winter tempera
tures and rainfall around the Bay would result.

The intuitively obvious conclusion that the Bay is a
complex ecosystem was borne out by the half dozen
reports dealing with tidal movement, sedimentation,
pollution, fish and wildlife, marshes and mudflats,
and salt, sand, and shells. The conclusions of each of
these reports start, "The Bay is a single physical
mechanism, in which actions affecting one part may
also affect other parts," and they end with an assess
ment of the harm which would result from "any reduc
tion in the surface or volume of the Bay."
While the study was being conducted, the Commis
sion had been empowered to regulate local fill of the
Bay. Even before all the evidence was in, the commis
sion believed strongly enough that Bay fill was de
leterious that it permitted only 359 acres to be filled in
four years, a fraction of the amount which previously
had been filled annually.
"It requires little imagination to picture the Bay reg
ion without the Bay," wrote Harold Gilliam in 1969 in
his chronicle of the Bay's preservation, "Between the
Devil and the Deep Blue Bay." "It is only necessary to
look at many another U.S. city, surrounded by mile
after mile of tract houses, asphalt-encircled shopping
centers, factories and freeways — endless stretches of
suburbs, choked by traffic, begrimed by smog.
"However, it requires considerable imagination,
and a great deal of ingenuity, to picture this region if its
greatest natural resource were preserved and de
veloped to its fullest potential. Thjs kind of vision of
what the Bay might become has been set forth by the
Bay Conservation and Development Commission in
the comprehensive plan it developed for the Bay and
its shores."
