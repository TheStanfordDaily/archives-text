# City discos provide variety, even Oz
## 
### 
So John Travolta you're not.
Even your choicest clothes can't
get you a spot on Soul Train.
Well, what of it?
Within one hour you can be
in San Francisco, where you
can choose from a number ol
the country's finest discos.
Anyone in search ot a wild
time, with or without the per
sonal trimmings, can be ac
commodated here.
After looking at a few of the
City's numerous discos, I
selected the following three
which stood out because ot
their diversity, flair and high
energy.
Sitting atop the St. Francis
one finds "Oz," a landmark lor
a distinctly "class" night on the
town. Upon entering, I was
dazzled by the opulence ol the
plush interior. The decor isdoni
in natural tones, smartly ac
cented by twinkling white
lights and abundant greenery.
The clientele is tor the most
part dressed to wound any
mortal's heart. The manage
ment suggests attire that befits
casual elegance, which trans
lates roughly into no jeans or
cords allowed — even it they
are Fiorucci's latest. Patrons
range from the voungand weal
ths to the old and wealthy (ob
viously a kev factor here).
The dance floor is a bit small,
but remains relatively un

crowded. The music is current
and it you'll permit mo, fairly
hot, affording an excellent op
portunity for both dance and
conversation. Drinks are good,
but expensive. As an added
bonus, //o/s il'ocvrcs are brought
by vour table periodically.
Although the cost may be
high, "Oz" will provide an ex
tremely enjoyable end to a
memorable evening.
Changing locales, 1 moved
across town toward Broadway
and"The City" disco. Loud,
pulsating music and the fren
zied gyrations of dancing
bodies gives "The City" its
highly energetic atmosphere.
Unlike "Oz," the dance floor
is huge, yet you will find it
packed from end to end on al
most every night. Once a pre
dominantly gay disco, it is now
a favorite of singles and young
couples. An elaborate lighting
system, one of the finest in San
Francisco, keeps the action fast
paced.
Dress is according to taste,
adding to an overall "anything
goes" mood and allowing a
wide spectrum to pick from.
Drinks are wonderful (strong as
hell) and reasonable priced.
The management can be
sticky with IDs, so make sure
you have yours handy. This is a
must visit for even the most
casual disco fan.

At 11 p.m., San Francisco's
hottest late night disco is just
beginning to move. Enormous
palm trees decorate the interior
of this converted warehouse,
where a diverse and devoted
clientele dances tirelessly until
dawn. This is the "Trocadero
Transfer," perhaps the most
complete disco experience in
town.
The mood inside is definitely

reflective of this area — unpre
dictable, unbelievable and al
ways very enjoyable. Boasting
the largest dance floor in the
Bay Area, the "Trocadero" also
offers the finest in sound and
light systems.
If the dancing gets too hectic
for you and you need a break,
you can play pinball upstairs, or
sit by the juice bars, downing
complimentary apple juice or

munching on assorted fruits.
No alcohol is served at the
"Trocadero" which allows it to
stay open past two, so take
heed and come prepared.
While it is a popular night spot
for visiting entertainers, the
"Trocadero Transfer" offers
locals a chance to experience
the ultimate in disco fever, the
San Francisco way.

Unlike "Oz," the dance floor
is huge, yet you will find it
packed from end to end on al
most every night. Once a pre
dominantly gay disco, it is now
a favorite of singles and young
couples. An elaborate lighting
system, one of the finest in San
Francisco, keeps the action fast
paced.
Dress is according to taste,
adding to an overall "anything
goes" mood and allowing a
wide spectrum to pick from.
Drinks are wonderful (strong as
hell) and reasonable priced.
The management can be
sticky with IDs, so make sure
you have yours handy. This is a
must visit for even the most
casual disco fan.

At 11 p.m., San Francisco's
hottest late night disco is just
beginning to move. Enormous
palm trees decorate the interior
of this converted warehouse,
where a diverse and devoted
clientele dances tirelessly until
dawn. This is the "Trocadero
Transfer," perhaps the most
complete disco experience in
town.
The mood inside is definitely

reflective of this area — unpre
dictable, unbelievable and al
ways very enjoyable. Boasting
the largest dance floor in the
Bay Area, the "Trocadero" also
offers the finest in sound and
light systems.
If the dancing gets too hectic
for you and you need a break,
you can play pinball upstairs, or
sit by the juice bars, downing
complimentary apple juice or

munching on assorted fruits.
No alcohol is served at the
"Trocadero" which allows it to
stay open past two, so take
heed and come prepared.
While it is a popular night spot
for visiting entertainers, the
"Trocadero Transfer" offers
locals a chance to experience
the ultimate in disco fever, the
San Francisco way.
