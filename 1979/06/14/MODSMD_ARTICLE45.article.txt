# Peninsula discos flourish
## 
### 
There .ire .is many different types of discos in
any American city as there are classes, races and
cliques to fill them, and the Bay Area is no excep
tion. Both ends of the spectrum are covered, from
the psychedelic funk disco to the intimate little
supper club and everything in between.
Palo Alto's HI Rancho Disco seems to be a rep
resentative example of a disco in its purest form.
The room comes alive under a $8000 lighting
system; colored lights form a star over the dance
floor and extend to all corners of the room. Spot
lights alternate with a strobe in an almost con
tinuous assault on the eyes.
The dance floor is large and obviously the focal
point of HI Rancho. It is surrounded by tables and
chairs, most occupied only by coats and purses
on any weekend, or maybe a worn-out couple,
numbed from the waist down, but still irresistibly
tapping their feet to Donna Summer's latest hit.
Filling the dance floor are dancers of all types.
In one corner, a young couple looking like prime
candidates for a Carol Burnett comedy routine try
desperately to pick up the beat.
Stars of the evening
On the other side of the dance floor, vying fora
little room in which to boogie, the stars of the
evening are doing their thing, delirious with
disco fever.
A till imposing-looking black man in a white
tuxedo and brilliant red shirt lilts his dazzlingly
clad partner into the air, spins her around and
brings her back down into a perfect execution of
the splits.
Two older couples stare, completely enthral
led "That's whv i come here," one of them said.

"The people-watching is recreation in itself."
One of the most popular discos in the Bay Area
has only one thing in common with El Rancho:
that same disco music. Tingle's in San Mateo is
not a typical disco. In fact, the disco is almost a
side to the club- .e atmosphere that strikes you
the minute you walk in.
A multi-faceted establishment, Tingle's at
tracts all types, from the curious tourist (Tingle's
is located in the Dunfey Hotel) to the avid
backgammon player and the serious dancer.
A half an hour wait
On a Saturday night, expect a half-hour wait
just to get in. Once past the elegantly dressed
doorman who makes sure that no denim or cor
duroy will ever pass through the front door, it
may take a minute to find the dance floor. It may
even be a hopeless cause to find a place to sit, or
even a corner to stand out of the line of fire of the
bustling cocktail hostesses.
The attitude underlying Tingle's is one of
sophistication. The regulars wear fashionably
expensive clothing; none of the flashy tuxedos or
sparkling dresses are seen there.
People mingle as though they were at an
anonymous party that just happened to have a
dance floor and some records. Because Tingle's is
part of a hotel, it fills with many over-thirty cus
tomers, which may partly explain the lack of
dazzling disco intensity.
That same intensity is also lost in the sheer size
of the place. Rather than a high-charged disco or
small club, Tingle's is an expensive and seem
ingly successful entertainment center.
