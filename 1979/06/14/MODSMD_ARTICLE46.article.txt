Each of us has a special reason for making Stan

ford home for four years. For some, it is the hope
of becoming "a member of the family of educated

men and women," as one Eastern school phrases
it. For others, it is the promise of financial success.
Still others choose Stanford because "Mom or
Dad went here" or because it's close to the ro
mance and verve of San Francisco.
Students who join the staff of The Stanford
Daily make that decision for a variety of reasons.
A school newspaper may be the most familiar
place on campus for a freshman who worked on
the high school paper. For those pursuing jour
nalism as a career, the Daily is, as a professor in
the Communication Department has said, "the
most realistic communications lab around." Daily
alumni have gone on to jobs with such news
gathering organizations as The Wall Street Jour
nal, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington
Post, The Boston Globe and various wire services,
to name just a few.
Even students not interested in a career in jour
nalism join the Daily. Reporting helps develop
writing skills, while interviewing provides oppor
tunities to meet new people.
After a few days on the staff, the camaraderie
and friendships can become important reasons to

work for the Daily. There is something uniquely
rewarding about working with other people in a
collective enterprise, especially when its result is
published five days a week. The lure of the Daily
as a place to spend spare time becomes contagi
ous.
Those who commit time to the Daily and learn
some of the tricks of the trade frequently become
one of the editors. Among other tasks, this means
making decisions about the newspaper, the pro
duct of the independent Stanford Daily Publish
ing Corporation, an organization with an annual
budget of more than $400,000.
As a former editor once said, working on the
Daily can give a student "a feeling that he knows
what's happening here and that he can influence
events." Readers may criticize the Daily, but they
do listen.
So what can you do? It's simple, join us. Previ
ous experience is welcome but not necessary.
There are tasks for all levels of skill and for people
with little or lots of time.
