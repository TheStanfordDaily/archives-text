Well, welcome to Stanford!
Orientation is a special, im
portant time for new students
here — freshmen and transfers
alike — and the University has
planned for all of the newcom
ers orientation programs that
include scores of meetings and
activities for the curious and the
bewildered,geared to introduce
them to the campus' social and
academic life.
Below, we list some of the
more important events
scheduled for the next five
days.
Freshman programs
As freshmen move in on
Wednesday, the Universitv will
host a special Parents Day
program from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
at the Bowman Alumni Flouse.
The program, quite frankly,
is intended to keep parents
busy — introducing them to the
University and familiarizing
them with the campus — while
their sons and daughters
explore their dorms and meet
their roommates.
From 4:30 to 5:30, however,
all freshmen and their parents
are invited to attend receptions

in the residences. Then, after
dinner, at 6:30 in Memorial Au
ditorium, Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon (name sound
familiar?) will introduce Presi
dent Richard Lyman, who will
give a welcoming address. He
will be followed by Herant
Katchadourian, Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies, who will
give an introduction to the un
dergraduate curriculum at
Stanford.
Thursday morning, believe it
or not, is exam time, as the Uni
versity will hold foreign lan
guage placement exams at vari
ous locations around campus
from 8 to 10 a.m.
At 10:30, faculty members
will visit the residences for in
troductory talks and small dis
cussion groups, after which
they will join students for
lunch.
That afternoon, from 1 to 5,
the Women's Center will host a
welcoming reception for all
new women students.
Advising teams
At 5 p.m., the Resident Fel
lows in each residence will hold
a sherry hour and will intro
duce the residences'faculty ad

vising "teams. '
The advisors in each house
have been assigned on the basis
of information supplied by the
freshmen during the summer
on their preliminary academic
interests. The advisors work
with the Resident Fellows and
the RA's to counsel the stu
dents, and they may consel any
student, regardless of which
students they have been as
signed.
Thursday evening the ad
visors will stay in the dorms for
a candelight dinner, and then
student performing groups, in
cluding the Mendicants, will
entertain.
Friday morning is mostly a
settling-in time, but Friday af
ternoon, the University has
scheduled programs designed
to introduce students to the
major areas of academic study.
At 12:30 in Kresge Au
ditorium, professors will de
scribe the pre-med curriculum.
At 1:30 in the Terman Engineer
ing Center, engineering classes
will be discussed. Three pre
sentations will then be given in
Memorial Auditorium: one on
the humanities at 2:30, another
on the social sciences at 3:30,
and a third on natural sciences/
technology/math at 4:30. Each
presentation will last about 45
minutes.
Throughout orientation
week, the four ethnic orienta
tion groups — Asian Ameri
can, Black, Chicanoand Native
American — will sponsor ac
tivities open to all interested
students. A complete schedule
of their activities appears on
page 7 of this issue.
Dancing
After dinner in the resi
dences, folk dancing for be
ginners, experts and those
in-between will be held on the
Tresidder deck, starting at 9.
"Back in the Saddle," a con
temporary West Coast swing

band, will perform under the
stars in the Old Union cour
yard.
Saturday afternoon at 1:30,
there's the Army football game,
for which the Food Service will
provide sack lunches. And that
night, after barbecues at the re
sidences, "Rooftop Magic," a
student rock band, will enter
tain on the Tresidder deck.
Sunday afternoon will be
play-time, as the University
holds Field Day at 3. The after
noon in the sun at the deGuerre
pools will include (for starters)
swimming, volleyball, various
races, frisbee throwing and
backgammon. Box suppers will
be provided.
Transfer programs
Although fewer in number
than the freshmen, transfer
students make up an important
part of the campus community,
and the University has some
orientation activities planned
for them as well.
Thursday afternoon, the
University will hold an
academic fair at which all of the
academic departments will
have tables set up and rep
resentatives available to answer
any questions that transfers
might have.
Thursday evening, after a
sit-down dinner in Tresidder's
large lounge, Lyman will wel
come transfers to the Univer
sity, and the student perform
ing group, Ram's Head, will en
tertain.
Friday afternoon, transfers
may join one of the tours leav
ing for Jasper Ridge, SLAC, the
Imagerium and the athletic
facilities, and Friday evening,
they may attend a barbecue at
Roble Field.
Saturday before the game
there will be brunch in the Old
Union courtyard, and finally on
Sunday, there will be Field
Day, which is open to all.
Monday morning is registra
tion . . . and the rest is
second-nature.
