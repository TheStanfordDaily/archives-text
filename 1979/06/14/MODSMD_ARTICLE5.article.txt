# From 'Senior Rag' to radioactive waste
## Variety of items to be put under class plate '79 
### Julie Ericksen 
Slightlv bigger than a bread
box and tilled with
memories tor the class of 197SJ,
this year's time capsule is just
about ready to take its place
underneath the new 1979 plate,
at the head of that long line ot
class plates in front of Memorial
Church.
T he time to be there will be 10
a.m. on Class Dav, Saturday,
when the capsule will actually
be em placed.
Some two dozen selected

items make up the list ot what
goes inside.
As enumerated by Senior
Class President Leslie Crozier,
these items include: one com
plete volume of The Senior Rag
newsletter, one Quad, one copy
of the Commencement Issue of the
Daily, a Senior Almanac which
has addresses of class members
and has a photographic biog
raphy ot the class, a senior
T-shirt, one program trom
Class Dav and a commence
ment program.

Representing this year's
more memorable athletic
triumphs will be a stub trom a
Bluebonnet Bowl ticket, and a
cap from the NCAA waterpolo
championship.
There will be a copy of the
Daily's "incriminating front
page picture" of the Senior Hal
loween party at the
Mausoleum, as well as one blue
chip from Senior Casino Night.
A program from this year's
Ham's Head production of
Gaieties and one from its spring

musical. Kiss Me Kate will also
be included.
One campus parking ticket, a
Blue Book, and a "thick en
velope" reminiscent ot impor
tant (i.e. Stanford's) acceptance
letters should be things mean
ingful to almost all seniors, as
should a canceled Spring Quar
ter tuition receipt.
Paired with the tuition receipt
will be a gasoline sales re
ceipt, because it is "almost as
precious" this year.

One ot the strongest items
possiblv destined tor preserva
tion is to be a |ar of radioactive
waste, which the class presi
dents are trying to collect.
Crozier said it is unclear
whether the waste can be had
without "super-big hassles."
Finally, the capsule will hold
one freeze-dried book from the
flood in Meyer Library's base
ment last November, a sorority
pin, one "O" burger with ev
erything, one beer from the
Coffee House (new this year)
and a champagne cork, the sig
nificance of which "will be bet
ter understood after gradua
tion," said Crozier.
Each class decides when their
time capsule may be opened
up. To date, none of the old
capsules in the Quad have ever
been unearthed.
This year's class has decided
that their's is to be opened
without fail on the 50th an
niversary of graduation, for all
of you soon-to-be-alums who
will be around.
Tradition has it that each year
all the seniors throw in their
Spring Quarter student ID
cards as a final inclusion, before
the plate is put down.
This year will be no excep
tion, and all seniors are ex
pected to take their IDs to the
ceremony at 10 a.m. in the
Quad Saturday.
