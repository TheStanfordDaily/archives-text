## ... while forgetting about some of the older traditions 
### Wendy Jalonen 
Puzzling over that row of
numbered bronze plaques in
front of Memorial Church?
Those plaques, set in the tiles of
the Quad since 1892, conceal
one of the few remaining Stan
ford traditions.
Each graduating class over
the years has interred a time
capsule containing the
memorabilia of its short era at
Stanford — everything from
armbands to Saturday Night
Fever.
But other Stanford traditions
have not stood so well the test
of changing times and col
legiate whims. Some conven
tions out of Stanford archives
that today's incoming freshmen
never need concern themselves
with include:

• Only seniors can wear
cords.
• No freshmen men allowed
on the Row.
• No smoking in the Quad.
• No women on the steps of
the Law building (now Political
Science).
• No corsages at Stanford
dances except the Senior Ball.
• Sharing rides with anyone
waiting under the big oak by
the History Corner.
• Only skirts on women
beyond the Post Office.
• Candy or flowers for
women locked out after closing
hours.
• No men in women's dorms
except in social rooms.
• No women alone in men's
dorms, fraternities or off cam
pus apartments.

• Hello Day in the Fall when
everyone says Hi.
• The Bonfire on the night be
fore Big Game.
The demise of many of these
traditions came with women's
liberation and the sexual re
volution of the '60s. Others just
faded into a past that held such
scriptures more highly.
Some "new traditions," such
as following the Band to The
City the night before Big Game,
have even risen to take their
places.
But beware freshmen wo
men: if a senior man promises
you that a kiss at midnight
under a full moon in the middle
of the Quad will turn you into a
Stanford woman, don't laugh.
That's one Stanford tradition
that's still going strong.
