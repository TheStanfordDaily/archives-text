# Stanford's rise to prominence: its days of glory and protest...
## ... its post-war fall from innocence 
### Brian Aronstam "Wah-hoo! Wah-hoo! L-S-J-U! Stan-ford" 
The chant of some 400 stu
dents reverberated through the
inner quadrangle as Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford
mounted a flower-covered plat
form to dedicate a new univer
sity.
Built on their Palo Alto horse
farm, the university had been
named by the Stanfords after
their late son, Leland Junior,
who had succumbed to tvphus
in IHH4.
As the dedication ceremonies
commenced on that bree/y Oc
tober 1, 1891, none of the as
sembled students and guests

"Who foresinv in 1945 that within 20 years discussion of our national
problems would have so much to say about ghettos, schools, pollution, civil
rights?. . . The old order has changed, yielding to the new, and we ponder
ways of dealing with the new." -President J.E. Wallace Sterling, 1968

could anticipate the school's
role in shaping the America that
emerged in the '50s, '60s and
'70s; they could not know that
Stanford would help to develop
America's technology and then
to question its morality.
On that Indian summer day
88 years ago, all was innocent
and untainted; the University,
saiil its new president, David
Starr Jordan, was "hallowed by
no traditions, hampered by
none. Its finger-posts all point
forward."
For the next 50 years, the
University did move forward,
surviving financial troubles
when its founders died and
physical devastation ■ when
struck by the 1906 earthquake.
The school moved forward

quietly, however, because it did
not replicate the philosophical
and classical curricula of the
Eastern colleges.
Because the senator believed
that education should be di
rected toward "usefulness in
life," the University stressed a
practical education that pre
pared the students for success
in the professions. Because the
senator scorned the curriculua
of the Eastern schools — "Of all
the young men who come to me
with letters of introduction
from the East," he said, "the
most helpless are college young
men —" his University for
years to come would never in
vite comparison with them.

In 1912, Frederick Terman, a
freshman that year and later a
University provost, found that
the University had the reputa
tion of being "a well regarded
but not great scholarly institu
tion. "The school, he recalled in
a Daily interview last year, "had
a few points of national distinc
tion," but it did not have nearly
"the star-studded faculty" that
a school such as Harvard had.
Fourteen years later, Rixford
Snyder, a freshman then and
later a history professor here,
considered Stanford "a very
fine regional university." How
ever, he added, he and his
classmates "in no way" be
lieved that Stanford ranked
"with Harvard or Princeton or
Yale or MIT."

The Depression almost
ruined whatever reputation the
University did have by the end
of the '20s. Private donations
shrank and enrollments de
clined, and the University had
difficulty maintaining its exist
ing facilities — let alone con
structing new ones. The lib
raries fell behind in their acquis
itions; the science and engineer
ing laboratories could not ac
quire new equipment.
Furthermore, though World
War 11 restored the health of the
nation, it did little to check
Stanford's flagging fortunes.
The University, Terman recal
led, emerged from the war as
"an underprivileged institu

tion," one that had neither con
tributed significantly to nor be
nefitted from "any of the excit
ing engineering activity as
sociated with the war."
It was not until after the war
that Stanford's fortunes began
to change — dramatically — as
Provost Terman recognized
and capitalized on the federal
government's continued in
terest in military research at
universities.
"As the end of the war ap
proached," Terman wrote in
1962, it was clear that the gov
ernment would continue to
support defense-related re
search; such activity was seen
as "necessary to maintain our
future military position." Even
then, Terman said, "one could

see a troubled world ahead."
Because of this foresight,
Terman continued, "Stanford
go* really a two- or three-year
head start on nearly every other
university in the country in re
search activity."
Terman helped to bring to
Stanford in 1946 two federal
contracts that keyed the Uni
versity's post-war emergence
as a vigorous and prestigious
school: one contract helped
physicist Felix Bloch exploit the
results of a remarkable discov
ery, nuclear magnetic reso
nance, and earn him a Nobel
Prize, and another supported
research in electronics.
This latter contract became
the basis of a $5 million annual
research program that would
help to attract 200 electronics
firms to within 50 miles of the
University.
The companies now include
such industrial giants as Lock
heed, IBM and General Elec
tric, and, Terman said, they
have provided the Peninsula
with "an exciting environment
that aids in the recruiting of fa
culty." In addition, Terman
continued, the firms help Stan
ford's competitive position "by
providing attractive consulting
opportunities for faculty mem
bers."
Indeed, one could say that
the government research grants
were, as J.E. Wallace Sterling,
president of the University
from 1949-68 said, "a hidden
form of federal aid."
The University, however, did
not draw all of its support from
the federal treasury, because it
also benefitted from a Ford
Foundation grant of $24 mill
ion, which the University
matched with a $72 million
fund-raising effort of its own.
These contributions, the Daily
reported at the time, completed
a $100 million donation drive
that set a new record for pri
vate support in capital cam
paigns of American univer
sities.
As donations increased,
Stanford also acquired a sig
nificant amount of income from
its 8250 acres of land, among
the most valuable in the nation.
Establishing the Stanford
Shopping Center and the Stan
ford Industrial Park in the '50s,
the University started to bring
in from leases revenues that
now total more than $1 million
annually.
The expanded income started
to produce visible returns in the
early '60s when, in 1961, the
Newsservice reported that the
graduate schools' "continuing
effort to recruit top talent from
all sections of the country
reaped an especially rich har
vest from Harvard, Princeton
and Yale."
In 1963, the News Service re
ported comparable gains in the

undergraduate classes, point
ing out that the freshmen men
had a median grade point aver
age (CPA) ot 3.8, while the
women had a median GPA of
3.9. In 1954, by contrast, the
News Service could report only
that a third of the freshman
class had had an "A" average in
high school.
In 1964, the University placed
12 departments in the top 10 of
the country, compared to five in
1954 and two in 1925 (as mea
sured by the American Council
of Education). The University
had unquestionably moved
into the upper echelons of
higher education, but much of
the funds that had made possi
ble the school's rise to promi
nence had come from the fed
eral government in support of
classified weapons research.
During the Cold War of the
'50s and early '60s, few mem
bers of the University commun
ity questioned the legitimacy of
such support; most held to the
belief, expressed by Terman,
that "science and technology
(were) vital to the national wel
fare" and that "if America was
to meet the challenge of Rus
sia," universities would have to
acquire "a new importance."
The studehts of the '60s,
however, felt differently; they
had grown up in peace, not
war, and they believed that
government research funds
should support humane, not
destructive, activities. More
concerned about the nation's
social welfare than its military
defense, the new generation of
students prompted Sterling to
ask in 1968:
"Who foresaw in 1945 that
within 20 years public discus
sion of our national domestic
problems would have so much
to say about ghettos and urban
renewal, about schools, about
air and water pollution, about
natural conservation, about

civil rights . . . The old order
has indeed changed, yielding
place to the new, and we probe
and ponder ways of dealing
with the new."
In the years that followed,
the University would indeed
struggle to adapt to the new.
In April 1969, new President
Kenneth Pitzer carried to the
Board of Trustees a message
from students calling for an end
to the campus' classified re
search. Pitzer told the Board
that it should "pay heed to the
voices of change."
One week later, more than
400 students staged a peaceful
nine day sit-in at the applied
electronics laboratory (AEL) to
protest its $2 million classified
weapons research program.
The Daily editorialized that the
protestors couldn't be sure

they had found "the most effec
tive way to bring about the
changes they (saw) as so vital."
Nonetheless, the Daily con
tinued, "the will of those who
are concerned with the direc
tion of this society must be ex
pressed, and it must be expres
sed quickly. People are dying.
More citizens must be led to
share the urgency that is being
expressed at AEL."
In May 1969, 200 students,
members of the radical April 3
Movement (A3M), seized En
cina Hall in support of demands
to bring the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) under tighter
control and to end its classified
research.
Some of the demonstrators
smashed glass doors and
gained entrance to locked of
fices by force, and the next day,


If the Daily is any indication of campus sentiment, the Stanford community a month before Pearl
Harbor had developed a keen awareness of the growing crises abioad. At the same time, however,
it was not about to be distracted from important intramural contests at home.

Calling for an end to ROTC classes on campus, about 25 stu
dents jammed the military justice class of Maj. C. Darrell Kirk
land in April 1970. The demonstrators disrupted the class by
chanting "off ROTC," hoping, as one student said, "To turn that
classroom into our classroom."
the Daily editorialized that the
sit-in stood as "a monument to
misguided student revolt, re
volt sure to achieve nothing it
seeks, unless it seeks destruc
tion."
The Board of Trustees re
jected the demands of A3M and
decided to cut the University's
ties with SRI, but the Academic
Senate approved a ban on vir
tually all of the University's
classified research activity.
In the spring of 1970, 500 stu

dents and faculty members
gathered in Memorial Church
to protest the presence of Re
serve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) programs on campus,
and a few weeks after that, stu
dents and faculty staged an
anti-ROTC strike that brought
almost all U ni versify classes to a
standstill.
The Faculty Senate voted
shortly thereafter to end credit
for ROTC classes, and by June
1973, the ROTC programs had

been phased out altogether.
In the intervening years,
other protests would stir the
campus, and many students,
demonstrating against the draft
and the war in Indochina,
would participate in marches,
rallies and sit-ins that ended in
mass arrests and the explosion
of tear gas cannisters.
But as the American role in
Vietnam diminished, and as the
draft came to an end, most
members of the University

community directed their atten
tion away from Stanford's polit
ical affairs and toward the more
traditional concerns of educa
tion. In October 1972, Provost
William Miller told the D<i//y
that the era of "confrontation
type politics" on campus was
over.
Joel Smith, vice president for
development—and in the early
'70s dean of student affairs —
said last spring, "It simply is a
fact that the protest movement
was a faint facsimile of itself
when selective service ended."
Economic factors also played
a part in the return to a more
peaceful campus. With the re
cession of 1973, many students
persuaded themselves that
their future security demanded
greater devotion to their books.
Recalling the "dramatic cul
tural change" between 1970
and 1974, Smith said, "There
came a generation of students
in the earlv '70s who were the
brothers and sisters of people
who had been damaged by the
'60s.
"There came a generation
who . . . knew of casualties,
and they turned to a straighter,
more secure course."
In April 1977, however, stu
dents resurrected memories of
the campus in the Vietnam era,

as they raised their voices in
protest against a different, if not
new, form of University in
volvement in foreign affairs.
This time, the protesters cal
led for an end to the Universi
ty's investments in corpora
tions doing business with the
apartheid nation of South Af
rica. To call attention to their
views, 500 demonstrators
staged a peaceful 16 hour sit-in
at the Old Union, and, after fail
ing to disperse, 294 were ar
rested.
Organized by the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible
Investment (SCRIP), the clap
ping and chanting protesters
demanded that the Trustees
vote the University's 94,000
shares in Ford Motor Company
in favor of a shareholder resolu
tion mandating withdrawal
from South Africa.
The Board, however, voted
to abstain on the Ford resolu
tion, choosing instead to make
its views known in writing to
the president of Ford and to the
executives of other University
supported corporations doing
business with South Africa.
This last spring, the Board
reversed this position, voting to
support a shareholder resolu
tion that would force Wells
Fargo Bank — of which the

University holds 186,250 shares
— to end loans to the apartheid
regime.
The Board also supported a
moratorium on loans to Chile's
repressive government by both
Wells Fargo and Chase Manhat
tan banks, concluding that the
loans "contribute to substantial
social injury."
The Trustees added, how
ever, that if political repression
were the sole test for invest
ment in nations, both American
business and universities
would have to "avoid most of
the nations of the world."
In later actions, the Board
would support shareholder
proposals calling for "nonex
pansion" of corporate activity
in South Africa — proposals
that would end sales by Ford,
for example, to the South Afri
can police and military.
The Daily editorialized that it
was "pleased with the trustees'
actions," though it added that
the Board did not go far
enough. The University, the
Daily said, should "begin draft
ing its own resolutions calling
for the withdrawal (of the cor
porations) from South Africa."
Echoing a sentiment expres
sed in the SRI controversy a de
cade earlier, the Daily added:
"We do not feel that Univer

sity divestment from non
progressive corporations is the
answer. We feel the University
can have a greater impact if it
works from within."
Now, as the University be
gins its 89th year, it does not
encounter the specters of vio
lence and vehement reaction
that haunted it 10 years ago.
But as it continues to deal
with the complicated world
which, in the last 25 years, it has
directly helped to build and
shape, it finds itself in the mid
dle of conflict over contempor
ary global issues.
The University now provides
much more than Senator Stan
ford had originally hoped — a
practical education that might
be preparatory to a professional
career.
Rather, it provides both a
philosophical and practical
education, an education
strengthened by the prestige of
a quarter-century of outstand
ing research and a decade of
conscientious — if sometimes
contentious — social and politi
cal debate.

ping and chanting protesters
demanded that the Trustees
vote the University's 94,000
shares in Ford Motor Company
in favor of a shareholder resolu
tion mandating withdrawal
from South Africa.
The Board, however, voted
to abstain on the Ford resolu
tion, choosing instead to make
its views known in writing to
the president of Ford and to the
executives of other University
supported corporations doing
business with South Africa.
This last spring, the Board
reversed this position, voting to
support a shareholder resolu
tion that would force Wells
Fargo Bank — of which the

University holds 186,250 shares
— to end loans to the apartheid
regime.
The Board also supported a
moratorium on loans to Chile's
repressive government by both
Wells Fargo and Chase Manhat
tan banks, concluding that the
loans "contribute to substantial
social injury."
The Trustees added, how
ever, that if political repression
were the sole test for invest
ment in nations, both American
business and universities
would have to "avoid most of
the nations of the world."
In later actions, the Board
would support shareholder
proposals calling for "nonex
pansion" of corporate activity
in South Africa — proposals
that would end sales by Ford,
for example, to the South Afri
can police and military.
The Daily editorialized that it
was "pleased with the trustees'
actions," though it added that
the Board did not go far
enough. The University, the
Daily said, should "begin draft
ing its own resolutions calling
for the withdrawal (of the cor
porations) from South Africa."
Echoing a sentiment expres
sed in the SRI controversy a de
cade earlier, the Daily added:
"We do not feel that Univer

sity divestment from non
progressive corporations is the
answer. We feel the University
can have a greater impact if it
works from within."
Now, as the University be
gins its 89th year, it does not
encounter the specters of vio
lence and vehement reaction
that haunted it 10 years ago.
But as it continues to deal
with the complicated world
which, in the last 25 years, it has
directly helped to build and
shape, it finds itself in the mid
dle of conflict over contempor
ary global issues.
The University now provides
much more than Senator Stan
ford had originally hoped — a
practical education that might
be preparatory to a professional
career.
Rather, it provides both a
philosophical and practical
education, an education
strengthened by the prestige of
a quarter-century of outstand
ing research and a decade of
conscientious — if sometimes
contentious — social and politi
cal debate.

In May 1977 about 450 demonstrators marched on President Richard Lyman's office demanding
that the University vote for shareholder resolutions against investment in South Africa.
The chant of some 400 stu
dents reverberated through the
inner quadrangle as Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford
mounted a flower-covered plat
form to dedicate a new univer
sity.
Built on their Palo Alto horse
farm, the university had been
named by the Stanfords after
their late son, Leland Junior,
who had succumbed to tvphus
in IHH4.
As the dedication ceremonies
commenced on that bree/y Oc
tober 1, 1891, none of the as
sembled students and guests

"Who foresinv in 1945 that within 20 years discussion of our national
problems would have so much to say about ghettos, schools, pollution, civil
rights?. . . The old order has changed, yielding to the new, and we ponder
ways of dealing with the new." -President J.E. Wallace Sterling, 1968

could anticipate the school's
role in shaping the America that
emerged in the '50s, '60s and
'70s; they could not know that
Stanford would help to develop
America's technology and then
to question its morality.
On that Indian summer day
88 years ago, all was innocent
and untainted; the University,
saiil its new president, David
Starr Jordan, was "hallowed by
no traditions, hampered by
none. Its finger-posts all point
forward."
For the next 50 years, the
University did move forward,
surviving financial troubles
when its founders died and
physical devastation ■ when
struck by the 1906 earthquake.
The school moved forward

quietly, however, because it did
not replicate the philosophical
and classical curricula of the
Eastern colleges.
Because the senator believed
that education should be di
rected toward "usefulness in
life," the University stressed a
practical education that pre
pared the students for success
in the professions. Because the
senator scorned the curriculua
of the Eastern schools — "Of all
the young men who come to me
with letters of introduction
from the East," he said, "the
most helpless are college young
men —" his University for
years to come would never in
vite comparison with them.

In 1912, Frederick Terman, a
freshman that year and later a
University provost, found that
the University had the reputa
tion of being "a well regarded
but not great scholarly institu
tion. "The school, he recalled in
a Daily interview last year, "had
a few points of national distinc
tion," but it did not have nearly
"the star-studded faculty" that
a school such as Harvard had.
Fourteen years later, Rixford
Snyder, a freshman then and
later a history professor here,
considered Stanford "a very
fine regional university." How
ever, he added, he and his
classmates "in no way" be
lieved that Stanford ranked
"with Harvard or Princeton or
Yale or MIT."

The Depression almost
ruined whatever reputation the
University did have by the end
of the '20s. Private donations
shrank and enrollments de
clined, and the University had
difficulty maintaining its exist
ing facilities — let alone con
structing new ones. The lib
raries fell behind in their acquis
itions; the science and engineer
ing laboratories could not ac
quire new equipment.
Furthermore, though World
War 11 restored the health of the
nation, it did little to check
Stanford's flagging fortunes.
The University, Terman recal
led, emerged from the war as
"an underprivileged institu

tion," one that had neither con
tributed significantly to nor be
nefitted from "any of the excit
ing engineering activity as
sociated with the war."
It was not until after the war
that Stanford's fortunes began
to change — dramatically — as
Provost Terman recognized
and capitalized on the federal
government's continued in
terest in military research at
universities.
"As the end of the war ap
proached," Terman wrote in
1962, it was clear that the gov
ernment would continue to
support defense-related re
search; such activity was seen
as "necessary to maintain our
future military position." Even
then, Terman said, "one could

see a troubled world ahead."
Because of this foresight,
Terman continued, "Stanford
go* really a two- or three-year
head start on nearly every other
university in the country in re
search activity."
Terman helped to bring to
Stanford in 1946 two federal
contracts that keyed the Uni
versity's post-war emergence
as a vigorous and prestigious
school: one contract helped
physicist Felix Bloch exploit the
results of a remarkable discov
ery, nuclear magnetic reso
nance, and earn him a Nobel
Prize, and another supported
research in electronics.
This latter contract became
the basis of a $5 million annual
research program that would
help to attract 200 electronics
firms to within 50 miles of the
University.
The companies now include
such industrial giants as Lock
heed, IBM and General Elec
tric, and, Terman said, they
have provided the Peninsula
with "an exciting environment
that aids in the recruiting of fa
culty." In addition, Terman
continued, the firms help Stan
ford's competitive position "by
providing attractive consulting
opportunities for faculty mem
bers."
Indeed, one could say that
the government research grants
were, as J.E. Wallace Sterling,
president of the University
from 1949-68 said, "a hidden
form of federal aid."
The University, however, did
not draw all of its support from
the federal treasury, because it
also benefitted from a Ford
Foundation grant of $24 mill
ion, which the University
matched with a $72 million
fund-raising effort of its own.
These contributions, the Daily
reported at the time, completed
a $100 million donation drive
that set a new record for pri
vate support in capital cam
paigns of American univer
sities.
As donations increased,
Stanford also acquired a sig
nificant amount of income from
its 8250 acres of land, among
the most valuable in the nation.
Establishing the Stanford
Shopping Center and the Stan
ford Industrial Park in the '50s,
the University started to bring
in from leases revenues that
now total more than $1 million
annually.
The expanded income started
to produce visible returns in the
early '60s when, in 1961, the
Newsservice reported that the
graduate schools' "continuing
effort to recruit top talent from
all sections of the country
reaped an especially rich har
vest from Harvard, Princeton
and Yale."
In 1963, the News Service re
ported comparable gains in the

undergraduate classes, point
ing out that the freshmen men
had a median grade point aver
age (CPA) ot 3.8, while the
women had a median GPA of
3.9. In 1954, by contrast, the
News Service could report only
that a third of the freshman
class had had an "A" average in
high school.
In 1964, the University placed
12 departments in the top 10 of
the country, compared to five in
1954 and two in 1925 (as mea
sured by the American Council
of Education). The University
had unquestionably moved
into the upper echelons of
higher education, but much of
the funds that had made possi
ble the school's rise to promi
nence had come from the fed
eral government in support of
classified weapons research.
During the Cold War of the
'50s and early '60s, few mem
bers of the University commun
ity questioned the legitimacy of
such support; most held to the
belief, expressed by Terman,
that "science and technology
(were) vital to the national wel
fare" and that "if America was
to meet the challenge of Rus
sia," universities would have to
acquire "a new importance."
The studehts of the '60s,
however, felt differently; they
had grown up in peace, not
war, and they believed that
government research funds
should support humane, not
destructive, activities. More
concerned about the nation's
social welfare than its military
defense, the new generation of
students prompted Sterling to
ask in 1968:
"Who foresaw in 1945 that
within 20 years public discus
sion of our national domestic
problems would have so much
to say about ghettos and urban
renewal, about schools, about
air and water pollution, about
natural conservation, about

civil rights . . . The old order
has indeed changed, yielding
place to the new, and we probe
and ponder ways of dealing
with the new."
In the years that followed,
the University would indeed
struggle to adapt to the new.
In April 1969, new President
Kenneth Pitzer carried to the
Board of Trustees a message
from students calling for an end
to the campus' classified re
search. Pitzer told the Board
that it should "pay heed to the
voices of change."
One week later, more than
400 students staged a peaceful
nine day sit-in at the applied
electronics laboratory (AEL) to
protest its $2 million classified
weapons research program.
The Daily editorialized that the
protestors couldn't be sure

they had found "the most effec
tive way to bring about the
changes they (saw) as so vital."
Nonetheless, the Daily con
tinued, "the will of those who
are concerned with the direc
tion of this society must be ex
pressed, and it must be expres
sed quickly. People are dying.
More citizens must be led to
share the urgency that is being
expressed at AEL."
In May 1969, 200 students,
members of the radical April 3
Movement (A3M), seized En
cina Hall in support of demands
to bring the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) under tighter
control and to end its classified
research.
Some of the demonstrators
smashed glass doors and
gained entrance to locked of
fices by force, and the next day,


If the Daily is any indication of campus sentiment, the Stanford community a month before Pearl
Harbor had developed a keen awareness of the growing crises abioad. At the same time, however,
it was not about to be distracted from important intramural contests at home.

Calling for an end to ROTC classes on campus, about 25 stu
dents jammed the military justice class of Maj. C. Darrell Kirk
land in April 1970. The demonstrators disrupted the class by
chanting "off ROTC," hoping, as one student said, "To turn that
classroom into our classroom."
the Daily editorialized that the
sit-in stood as "a monument to
misguided student revolt, re
volt sure to achieve nothing it
seeks, unless it seeks destruc
tion."
The Board of Trustees re
jected the demands of A3M and
decided to cut the University's
ties with SRI, but the Academic
Senate approved a ban on vir
tually all of the University's
classified research activity.
In the spring of 1970, 500 stu

dents and faculty members
gathered in Memorial Church
to protest the presence of Re
serve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) programs on campus,
and a few weeks after that, stu
dents and faculty staged an
anti-ROTC strike that brought
almost all U ni versify classes to a
standstill.
The Faculty Senate voted
shortly thereafter to end credit
for ROTC classes, and by June
1973, the ROTC programs had

been phased out altogether.
In the intervening years,
other protests would stir the
campus, and many students,
demonstrating against the draft
and the war in Indochina,
would participate in marches,
rallies and sit-ins that ended in
mass arrests and the explosion
of tear gas cannisters.
But as the American role in
Vietnam diminished, and as the
draft came to an end, most
members of the University

community directed their atten
tion away from Stanford's polit
ical affairs and toward the more
traditional concerns of educa
tion. In October 1972, Provost
William Miller told the D<i//y
that the era of "confrontation
type politics" on campus was
over.
Joel Smith, vice president for
development—and in the early
'70s dean of student affairs —
said last spring, "It simply is a
fact that the protest movement
was a faint facsimile of itself
when selective service ended."
Economic factors also played
a part in the return to a more
peaceful campus. With the re
cession of 1973, many students
persuaded themselves that
their future security demanded
greater devotion to their books.
Recalling the "dramatic cul
tural change" between 1970
and 1974, Smith said, "There
came a generation of students
in the earlv '70s who were the
brothers and sisters of people
who had been damaged by the
'60s.
"There came a generation
who . . . knew of casualties,
and they turned to a straighter,
more secure course."
In April 1977, however, stu
dents resurrected memories of
the campus in the Vietnam era,

as they raised their voices in
protest against a different, if not
new, form of University in
volvement in foreign affairs.
This time, the protesters cal
led for an end to the Universi
ty's investments in corpora
tions doing business with the
apartheid nation of South Af
rica. To call attention to their
views, 500 demonstrators
staged a peaceful 16 hour sit-in
at the Old Union, and, after fail
ing to disperse, 294 were ar
rested.
Organized by the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible
Investment (SCRIP), the clap
ping and chanting protesters
demanded that the Trustees
vote the University's 94,000
shares in Ford Motor Company
in favor of a shareholder resolu
tion mandating withdrawal
from South Africa.
The Board, however, voted
to abstain on the Ford resolu
tion, choosing instead to make
its views known in writing to
the president of Ford and to the
executives of other University

This last spring, the Board

University holds 186,250 shares

repressive government by both
Wells Fargo and Chase Manhat
tan banks, concluding that the

social injury."

ties with SRI, but the Academic
Senate approved a ban on vir
tually all of the University's
classified research activity.
In the spring of 1970, 500 stu

dents and faculty members
gathered in Memorial Church
to protest the presence of Re
serve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) programs on campus,
and a few weeks after that, stu
dents and faculty staged an
anti-ROTC strike that brought
almost all U ni versify classes to a
standstill.
The Faculty Senate voted
shortly thereafter to end credit
for ROTC classes, and by June
1973, the ROTC programs had

been phased out altogether.
In the intervening years,
other protests would stir the
campus, and many students,
demonstrating against the draft
and the war in Indochina,
would participate in marches,
rallies and sit-ins that ended in
mass arrests and the explosion
of tear gas cannisters.
But as the American role in
Vietnam diminished, and as the
draft came to an end, most
members of the University

community directed their atten
tion away from Stanford's polit
ical affairs and toward the more
traditional concerns of educa
tion. In October 1972, Provost
William Miller told the D<i//y
that the era of "confrontation
type politics" on campus was
over.
Joel Smith, vice president for
development—and in the early
'70s dean of student affairs —
said last spring, "It simply is a
fact that the protest movement
was a faint facsimile of itself
when selective service ended."
Economic factors also played
a part in the return to a more
peaceful campus. With the re
cession of 1973, many students
persuaded themselves that
their future security demanded
greater devotion to their books.
Recalling the "dramatic cul
tural change" between 1970
and 1974, Smith said, "There
came a generation of students
in the earlv '70s who were the
brothers and sisters of people
who had been damaged by the
'60s.
"There came a generation
who . . . knew of casualties,
and they turned to a straighter,
more secure course."
In April 1977, however, stu
dents resurrected memories of
the campus in the Vietnam era,

as they raised their voices in
protest against a different, if not
new, form of University in
volvement in foreign affairs.
This time, the protesters cal
led for an end to the Universi
ty's investments in corpora
tions doing business with the
apartheid nation of South Af
rica. To call attention to their
views, 500 demonstrators
staged a peaceful 16 hour sit-in
at the Old Union, and, after fail
ing to disperse, 294 were ar
rested.
Organized by the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible
Investment (SCRIP), the clap
ping and chanting protesters
demanded that the Trustees
vote the University's 94,000
shares in Ford Motor Company
in favor of a shareholder resolu
tion mandating withdrawal
from South Africa.
The Board, however, voted
to abstain on the Ford resolu
tion, choosing instead to make
its views known in writing to
the president of Ford and to the
executives of other University
supported corporations doing
business with South Africa.
This last spring, the Board
reversed this position, voting to
support a shareholder resolu
tion that would force Wells
Fargo Bank — of which the

University holds 186,250 shares
— to end loans to the apartheid
regime.
The Board also supported a
moratorium on loans to Chile's
repressive government by both
Wells Fargo and Chase Manhat
tan banks, concluding that the
loans "contribute to substantial
social injury."
The Trustees added, how
ever, that if political repression
were the sole test for invest
ment in nations, both American
business and universities
would have to "avoid most of
the nations of the world."
In later actions, the Board
would support shareholder
proposals calling for "nonex
pansion" of corporate activity
in South Africa — proposals
that would end sales by Ford,
for example, to the South Afri
can police and military.
The Daily editorialized that it
was "pleased with the trustees'
actions," though it added that
the Board did not go far
enough. The University, the
Daily said, should "begin draft
ing its own resolutions calling
for the withdrawal (of the cor
porations) from South Africa."
Echoing a sentiment expres
sed in the SRI controversy a de
cade earlier, the Daily added:
"We do not feel that Univer

sity divestment from non
progressive corporations is the
answer. We feel the University
can have a greater impact if it
works from within."
Now, as the University be
gins its 89th year, it does not
encounter the specters of vio
lence and vehement reaction
that haunted it 10 years ago.
But as it continues to deal
with the complicated world
which, in the last 25 years, it has
directly helped to build and
shape, it finds itself in the mid
dle of conflict over contempor
ary global issues.
The University now provides
much more than Senator Stan
ford had originally hoped — a
practical education that might
be preparatory to a professional
career.
Rather, it provides both a
philosophical and practical
education, an education
strengthened by the prestige of
a quarter-century of outstand
ing research and a decade of
conscientious — if sometimes
contentious — social and politi
cal debate.

In May 1977 about 450 demonstrators marched on President Richard Lyman's office demanding
that the University vote for shareholder resolutions against investment in South Africa.
The chant of some 400 stu
dents reverberated through the
inner quadrangle as Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford
mounted a flower-covered plat
form to dedicate a new univer
sity.
Built on their Palo Alto horse
farm, the university had been
named by the Stanfords after
their late son, Leland Junior,
who had succumbed to tvphus
in IHH4.
As the dedication ceremonies
commenced on that bree/y Oc
tober 1, 1891, none of the as
sembled students and guests

"Who foresinv in 1945 that within 20 years discussion of our national
problems would have so much to say about ghettos, schools, pollution, civil
rights?. . . The old order has changed, yielding to the new, and we ponder
ways of dealing with the new." -President J.E. Wallace Sterling, 1968

could anticipate the school's
role in shaping the America that
emerged in the '50s, '60s and
'70s; they could not know that
Stanford would help to develop
America's technology and then
to question its morality.
On that Indian summer day
88 years ago, all was innocent
and untainted; the University,
saiil its new president, David
Starr Jordan, was "hallowed by
no traditions, hampered by
none. Its finger-posts all point
forward."
For the next 50 years, the
University did move forward,
surviving financial troubles
when its founders died and
physical devastation ■ when
struck by the 1906 earthquake.
The school moved forward

quietly, however, because it did
not replicate the philosophical
and classical curricula of the
Eastern colleges.
Because the senator believed
that education should be di
rected toward "usefulness in
life," the University stressed a
practical education that pre
pared the students for success
in the professions. Because the
senator scorned the curriculua
of the Eastern schools — "Of all
the young men who come to me
with letters of introduction
from the East," he said, "the
most helpless are college young
men —" his University for
years to come would never in
vite comparison with them.

In 1912, Frederick Terman, a
freshman that year and later a
University provost, found that
the University had the reputa
tion of being "a well regarded
but not great scholarly institu
tion. "The school, he recalled in
a Daily interview last year, "had
a few points of national distinc
tion," but it did not have nearly
"the star-studded faculty" that
a school such as Harvard had.
Fourteen years later, Rixford
Snyder, a freshman then and
later a history professor here,
considered Stanford "a very
fine regional university." How
ever, he added, he and his
classmates "in no way" be
lieved that Stanford ranked
"with Harvard or Princeton or
Yale or MIT."

The Depression almost
ruined whatever reputation the
University did have by the end
of the '20s. Private donations
shrank and enrollments de
clined, and the University had
difficulty maintaining its exist
ing facilities — let alone con
structing new ones. The lib
raries fell behind in their acquis
itions; the science and engineer
ing laboratories could not ac
quire new equipment.
Furthermore, though World
War 11 restored the health of the
nation, it did little to check
Stanford's flagging fortunes.
The University, Terman recal
led, emerged from the war as
"an underprivileged institu

tion," one that had neither con
tributed significantly to nor be
nefitted from "any of the excit
ing engineering activity as
sociated with the war."
It was not until after the war
that Stanford's fortunes began
to change — dramatically — as
Provost Terman recognized
and capitalized on the federal
government's continued in
terest in military research at
universities.
"As the end of the war ap
proached," Terman wrote in
1962, it was clear that the gov
ernment would continue to
support defense-related re
search; such activity was seen
as "necessary to maintain our
future military position." Even
then, Terman said, "one could

see a troubled world ahead."
Because of this foresight,
Terman continued, "Stanford
go* really a two- or three-year
head start on nearly every other
university in the country in re
search activity."
Terman helped to bring to
Stanford in 1946 two federal
contracts that keyed the Uni
versity's post-war emergence
as a vigorous and prestigious
school: one contract helped
physicist Felix Bloch exploit the
results of a remarkable discov
ery, nuclear magnetic reso
nance, and earn him a Nobel
Prize, and another supported
research in electronics.
This latter contract became
the basis of a $5 million annual
research program that would
help to attract 200 electronics
firms to within 50 miles of the
University.
The companies now include
such industrial giants as Lock
heed, IBM and General Elec
tric, and, Terman said, they
have provided the Peninsula
with "an exciting environment
that aids in the recruiting of fa
culty." In addition, Terman
continued, the firms help Stan
ford's competitive position "by
providing attractive consulting
opportunities for faculty mem
bers."
Indeed, one could say that
the government research grants
were, as J.E. Wallace Sterling,
president of the University
from 1949-68 said, "a hidden
form of federal aid."
The University, however, did
not draw all of its support from
the federal treasury, because it
also benefitted from a Ford
Foundation grant of $24 mill
ion, which the University
matched with a $72 million
fund-raising effort of its own.
These contributions, the Daily
reported at the time, completed
a $100 million donation drive
that set a new record for pri
vate support in capital cam
paigns of American univer
sities.
As donations increased,
Stanford also acquired a sig
nificant amount of income from
its 8250 acres of land, among
the most valuable in the nation.
Establishing the Stanford
Shopping Center and the Stan
ford Industrial Park in the '50s,
the University started to bring
in from leases revenues that
now total more than $1 million
annually.
The expanded income started
to produce visible returns in the
early '60s when, in 1961, the
Newsservice reported that the
graduate schools' "continuing
effort to recruit top talent from
all sections of the country
reaped an especially rich har
vest from Harvard, Princeton
and Yale."
In 1963, the News Service re
ported comparable gains in the

undergraduate classes, point
ing out that the freshmen men
had a median grade point aver
age (CPA) ot 3.8, while the
women had a median GPA of
3.9. In 1954, by contrast, the
News Service could report only
that a third of the freshman
class had had an "A" average in
high school.
In 1964, the University placed
12 departments in the top 10 of
the country, compared to five in
1954 and two in 1925 (as mea
sured by the American Council
of Education). The University
had unquestionably moved
into the upper echelons of
higher education, but much of
the funds that had made possi
ble the school's rise to promi
nence had come from the fed
eral government in support of
classified weapons research.
During the Cold War of the
'50s and early '60s, few mem
bers of the University commun
ity questioned the legitimacy of
such support; most held to the
belief, expressed by Terman,
that "science and technology
(were) vital to the national wel
fare" and that "if America was
to meet the challenge of Rus
sia," universities would have to
acquire "a new importance."
The studehts of the '60s,
however, felt differently; they
had grown up in peace, not
war, and they believed that
government research funds
should support humane, not
destructive, activities. More
concerned about the nation's
social welfare than its military
defense, the new generation of
students prompted Sterling to
ask in 1968:
"Who foresaw in 1945 that
within 20 years public discus
sion of our national domestic
problems would have so much
to say about ghettos and urban
renewal, about schools, about
air and water pollution, about
natural conservation, about

civil rights . . . The old order
has indeed changed, yielding
place to the new, and we probe
and ponder ways of dealing
with the new."
In the years that followed,
the University would indeed
struggle to adapt to the new.
In April 1969, new President
Kenneth Pitzer carried to the
Board of Trustees a message
from students calling for an end
to the campus' classified re
search. Pitzer told the Board
that it should "pay heed to the
voices of change."
One week later, more than
400 students staged a peaceful
nine day sit-in at the applied
electronics laboratory (AEL) to
protest its $2 million classified
weapons research program.
The Daily editorialized that the
protestors couldn't be sure

they had found "the most effec
tive way to bring about the
changes they (saw) as so vital."
Nonetheless, the Daily con
tinued, "the will of those who
are concerned with the direc
tion of this society must be ex
pressed, and it must be expres
sed quickly. People are dying.
More citizens must be led to
share the urgency that is being
expressed at AEL."
In May 1969, 200 students,
members of the radical April 3
Movement (A3M), seized En
cina Hall in support of demands
to bring the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) under tighter
control and to end its classified
research.
Some of the demonstrators
smashed glass doors and
gained entrance to locked of
fices by force, and the next day,


If the Daily is any indication of campus sentiment, the Stanford community a month before Pearl
Harbor had developed a keen awareness of the growing crises abioad. At the same time, however,
it was not about to be distracted from important intramural contests at home.

Calling for an end to ROTC classes on campus, about 25 stu
dents jammed the military justice class of Maj. C. Darrell Kirk
land in April 1970. The demonstrators disrupted the class by
chanting "off ROTC," hoping, as one student said, "To turn that
classroom into our classroom."
the Daily editorialized that the
sit-in stood as "a monument to
misguided student revolt, re
volt sure to achieve nothing it
seeks, unless it seeks destruc
tion."
The Board of Trustees re
jected the demands of A3M and
decided to cut the University's
ties with SRI, but the Academic
Senate approved a ban on vir
tually all of the University's
classified research activity.
In the spring of 1970, 500 stu

dents and faculty members

been phased out altogether.
In the intervening years,
other protests would stir the

demonstrating against the draft
and the war in Indochina,
would participate in marches,
rallies and sit-ins that ended in
mass arrests and the explosion
of tear gas cannisters.

Vietnam diminished, and as the

ask in 1968:
"Who foresaw in 1945 that
within 20 years public discus
sion of our national domestic
problems would have so much
to say about ghettos and urban
renewal, about schools, about
air and water pollution, about
natural conservation, about

civil rights . . . The old order
has indeed changed, yielding
place to the new, and we probe
and ponder ways of dealing
with the new."
In the years that followed,
the University would indeed
struggle to adapt to the new.
In April 1969, new President
Kenneth Pitzer carried to the
Board of Trustees a message
from students calling for an end
to the campus' classified re
search. Pitzer told the Board
that it should "pay heed to the
voices of change."
One week later, more than
400 students staged a peaceful
nine day sit-in at the applied
electronics laboratory (AEL) to
protest its $2 million classified
weapons research program.
The Daily editorialized that the
protestors couldn't be sure

they had found "the most effec
tive way to bring about the
changes they (saw) as so vital."
Nonetheless, the Daily con
tinued, "the will of those who
are concerned with the direc
tion of this society must be ex
pressed, and it must be expres
sed quickly. People are dying.
More citizens must be led to
share the urgency that is being
expressed at AEL."
In May 1969, 200 students,
members of the radical April 3
Movement (A3M), seized En
cina Hall in support of demands
to bring the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) under tighter
control and to end its classified
research.
Some of the demonstrators
smashed glass doors and
gained entrance to locked of
fices by force, and the next day,


If the Daily is any indication of campus sentiment, the Stanford community a month before Pearl
Harbor had developed a keen awareness of the growing crises abioad. At the same time, however,
it was not about to be distracted from important intramural contests at home.

Calling for an end to ROTC classes on campus, about 25 stu
dents jammed the military justice class of Maj. C. Darrell Kirk
land in April 1970. The demonstrators disrupted the class by
chanting "off ROTC," hoping, as one student said, "To turn that
classroom into our classroom."
the Daily editorialized that the
sit-in stood as "a monument to
misguided student revolt, re
volt sure to achieve nothing it
seeks, unless it seeks destruc
tion."
The Board of Trustees re
jected the demands of A3M and
decided to cut the University's
ties with SRI, but the Academic
Senate approved a ban on vir
tually all of the University's
classified research activity.
In the spring of 1970, 500 stu

dents and faculty members
gathered in Memorial Church
to protest the presence of Re
serve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) programs on campus,
and a few weeks after that, stu
dents and faculty staged an
anti-ROTC strike that brought
almost all U ni versify classes to a
standstill.
The Faculty Senate voted
shortly thereafter to end credit
for ROTC classes, and by June
1973, the ROTC programs had

been phased out altogether.
In the intervening years,
other protests would stir the
campus, and many students,
demonstrating against the draft
and the war in Indochina,
would participate in marches,
rallies and sit-ins that ended in
mass arrests and the explosion
of tear gas cannisters.
But as the American role in
Vietnam diminished, and as the
draft came to an end, most
members of the University

community directed their atten
tion away from Stanford's polit
ical affairs and toward the more
traditional concerns of educa
tion. In October 1972, Provost
William Miller told the D<i//y
that the era of "confrontation
type politics" on campus was
over.
Joel Smith, vice president for
development—and in the early
'70s dean of student affairs —
said last spring, "It simply is a
fact that the protest movement
was a faint facsimile of itself
when selective service ended."
Economic factors also played
a part in the return to a more
peaceful campus. With the re
cession of 1973, many students
persuaded themselves that
their future security demanded
greater devotion to their books.
Recalling the "dramatic cul
tural change" between 1970
and 1974, Smith said, "There
came a generation of students
in the earlv '70s who were the
brothers and sisters of people
who had been damaged by the
'60s.
"There came a generation
who . . . knew of casualties,
and they turned to a straighter,
more secure course."
In April 1977, however, stu
dents resurrected memories of
the campus in the Vietnam era,

as they raised their voices in
protest against a different, if not
new, form of University in
volvement in foreign affairs.
This time, the protesters cal
led for an end to the Universi
ty's investments in corpora
tions doing business with the
apartheid nation of South Af
rica. To call attention to their
views, 500 demonstrators
staged a peaceful 16 hour sit-in
at the Old Union, and, after fail
ing to disperse, 294 were ar
rested.
Organized by the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible
Investment (SCRIP), the clap
ping and chanting protesters
demanded that the Trustees
vote the University's 94,000
shares in Ford Motor Company
in favor of a shareholder resolu
tion mandating withdrawal
from South Africa.
The Board, however, voted
to abstain on the Ford resolu
tion, choosing instead to make
its views known in writing to
the president of Ford and to the
executives of other University
supported corporations doing
business with South Africa.
This last spring, the Board
reversed this position, voting to
support a shareholder resolu
tion that would force Wells
Fargo Bank — of which the

University holds 186,250 shares
— to end loans to the apartheid
regime.
The Board also supported a
moratorium on loans to Chile's
repressive government by both
Wells Fargo and Chase Manhat
tan banks, concluding that the
loans "contribute to substantial
social injury."
The Trustees added, how
ever, that if political repression
were the sole test for invest
ment in nations, both American
business and universities
would have to "avoid most of
the nations of the world."
In later actions, the Board
would support shareholder
proposals calling for "nonex
pansion" of corporate activity
in South Africa — proposals
that would end sales by Ford,
for example, to the South Afri
can police and military.
The Daily editorialized that it
was "pleased with the trustees'
actions," though it added that
the Board did not go far
enough. The University, the
Daily said, should "begin draft
ing its own resolutions calling
for the withdrawal (of the cor
porations) from South Africa."
Echoing a sentiment expres
sed in the SRI controversy a de
cade earlier, the Daily added:
"We do not feel that Univer

sity divestment from non
progressive corporations is the
answer. We feel the University
can have a greater impact if it
works from within."
Now, as the University be
gins its 89th year, it does not
encounter the specters of vio
lence and vehement reaction
that haunted it 10 years ago.
But as it continues to deal
with the complicated world
which, in the last 25 years, it has
directly helped to build and
shape, it finds itself in the mid
dle of conflict over contempor
ary global issues.
The University now provides
much more than Senator Stan
ford had originally hoped — a
practical education that might
be preparatory to a professional
career.
Rather, it provides both a
philosophical and practical
education, an education
strengthened by the prestige of
a quarter-century of outstand
ing research and a decade of
conscientious — if sometimes
contentious — social and politi
cal debate.

In May 1977 about 450 demonstrators marched on President Richard Lyman's office demanding
that the University vote for shareholder resolutions against investment in South Africa.
The chant of some 400 stu
dents reverberated through the
inner quadrangle as Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford
mounted a flower-covered plat
form to dedicate a new univer
sity.
Built on their Palo Alto horse
farm, the university had been
named by the Stanfords after
their late son, Leland Junior,
who had succumbed to tvphus
in IHH4.
As the dedication ceremonies
commenced on that bree/y Oc
tober 1, 1891, none of the as
sembled students and guests

"Who foresinv in 1945 that within 20 years discussion of our national
problems would have so much to say about ghettos, schools, pollution, civil
rights?. . . The old order has changed, yielding to the new, and we ponder
ways of dealing with the new." -President J.E. Wallace Sterling, 1968

could anticipate the school's
role in shaping the America that
emerged in the '50s, '60s and
'70s; they could not know that
Stanford would help to develop
America's technology and then
to question its morality.
On that Indian summer day
88 years ago, all was innocent
and untainted; the University,
saiil its new president, David
Starr Jordan, was "hallowed by
no traditions, hampered by
none. Its finger-posts all point
forward."
For the next 50 years, the
University did move forward,
surviving financial troubles
when its founders died and
physical devastation ■ when
struck by the 1906 earthquake.
The school moved forward

quietly, however, because it did
not replicate the philosophical
and classical curricula of the
Eastern colleges.
Because the senator believed
that education should be di
rected toward "usefulness in
life," the University stressed a
practical education that pre
pared the students for success
in the professions. Because the
senator scorned the curriculua
of the Eastern schools — "Of all
the young men who come to me
with letters of introduction
from the East," he said, "the
most helpless are college young
men —" his University for
years to come would never in
vite comparison with them.

In 1912, Frederick Terman, a
freshman that year and later a
University provost, found that
the University had the reputa
tion of being "a well regarded
but not great scholarly institu
tion. "The school, he recalled in
a Daily interview last year, "had
a few points of national distinc
tion," but it did not have nearly
"the star-studded faculty" that
a school such as Harvard had.
Fourteen years later, Rixford
Snyder, a freshman then and
later a history professor here,
considered Stanford "a very
fine regional university." How
ever, he added, he and his
classmates "in no way" be
lieved that Stanford ranked
"with Harvard or Princeton or
Yale or MIT."

The Depression almost
ruined whatever reputation the
University did have by the end
of the '20s. Private donations
shrank and enrollments de
clined, and the University had
difficulty maintaining its exist
ing facilities — let alone con
structing new ones. The lib
raries fell behind in their acquis
itions; the science and engineer
ing laboratories could not ac
quire new equipment.
Furthermore, though World
War 11 restored the health of the
nation, it did little to check
Stanford's flagging fortunes.
The University, Terman recal
led, emerged from the war as
"an underprivileged institu

tion," one that had neither con
tributed significantly to nor be
nefitted from "any of the excit
ing engineering activity as
sociated with the war."
It was not until after the war
that Stanford's fortunes began
to change — dramatically — as
Provost Terman recognized
and capitalized on the federal
government's continued in
terest in military research at
universities.
"As the end of the war ap
proached," Terman wrote in
1962, it was clear that the gov
ernment would continue to
support defense-related re
search; such activity was seen
as "necessary to maintain our
future military position." Even
then, Terman said, "one could

see a troubled world ahead."
Because of this foresight,
Terman continued, "Stanford
go* really a two- or three-year
head start on nearly every other
university in the country in re
search activity."
Terman helped to bring to
Stanford in 1946 two federal
contracts that keyed the Uni
versity's post-war emergence
as a vigorous and prestigious
school: one contract helped
physicist Felix Bloch exploit the
results of a remarkable discov
ery, nuclear magnetic reso
nance, and earn him a Nobel
Prize, and another supported
research in electronics.
This latter contract became
the basis of a $5 million annual
research program that would
help to attract 200 electronics
firms to within 50 miles of the
University.
The companies now include
such industrial giants as Lock
heed, IBM and General Elec
tric, and, Terman said, they
have provided the Peninsula
with "an exciting environment
that aids in the recruiting of fa
culty." In addition, Terman
continued, the firms help Stan
ford's competitive position "by
providing attractive consulting
opportunities for faculty mem
bers."
Indeed, one could say that
the government research grants
were, as J.E. Wallace Sterling,
president of the University
from 1949-68 said, "a hidden
form of federal aid."
The University, however, did
not draw all of its support from
the federal treasury, because it
also benefitted from a Ford
Foundation grant of $24 mill
ion, which the University
matched with a $72 million
fund-raising effort of its own.
These contributions, the Daily
reported at the time, completed
a $100 million donation drive
that set a new record for pri
vate support in capital cam
paigns of American univer
sities.
As donations increased,
Stanford also acquired a sig
nificant amount of income from
its 8250 acres of land, among
the most valuable in the nation.
Establishing the Stanford
Shopping Center and the Stan
ford Industrial Park in the '50s,
the University started to bring
in from leases revenues that
now total more than $1 million
annually.
The expanded income started
to produce visible returns in the
early '60s when, in 1961, the
Newsservice reported that the
graduate schools' "continuing
effort to recruit top talent from
all sections of the country
reaped an especially rich har
vest from Harvard, Princeton
and Yale."
In 1963, the News Service re
ported comparable gains in the

undergraduate classes, point
ing out that the freshmen men
had a median grade point aver
age (CPA) ot 3.8, while the
women had a median GPA of
3.9. In 1954, by contrast, the
News Service could report only
that a third of the freshman
class had had an "A" average in
high school.
In 1964, the University placed
12 departments in the top 10 of
the country, compared to five in
1954 and two in 1925 (as mea
sured by the American Council
of Education). The University
had unquestionably moved
into the upper echelons of
higher education, but much of
the funds that had made possi
ble the school's rise to promi
nence had come from the fed
eral government in support of
classified weapons research.
During the Cold War of the
'50s and early '60s, few mem
bers of the University commun
ity questioned the legitimacy of
such support; most held to the
belief, expressed by Terman,
that "science and technology
(were) vital to the national wel
fare" and that "if America was
to meet the challenge of Rus
sia," universities would have to
acquire "a new importance."
The studehts of the '60s,
however, felt differently; they
had grown up in peace, not
war, and they believed that
government research funds
should support humane, not
destructive, activities. More
concerned about the nation's
social welfare than its military
defense, the new generation of
students prompted Sterling to
ask in 1968:
"Who foresaw in 1945 that
within 20 years public discus
sion of our national domestic
problems would have so much
to say about ghettos and urban
renewal, about schools, about
air and water pollution, about
natural conservation, about

civil rights . . . The old order
has indeed changed, yielding

from 1949-68 said, "a hidden
form of federal aid."
The University, however, did
not draw all of its support from
the federal treasury, because it
also benefitted from a Ford
Foundation grant of $24 mill
ion, which the University
matched with a $72 million
fund-raising effort of its own.
These contributions, the Daily
reported at the time, completed
a $100 million donation drive
that set a new record for pri
vate support in capital cam
paigns of American univer
sities.
As donations increased,
Stanford also acquired a sig
nificant amount of income from
its 8250 acres of land, among
the most valuable in the nation.
Establishing the Stanford
Shopping Center and the Stan
ford Industrial Park in the '50s,
the University started to bring
in from leases revenues that
now total more than $1 million
annually.
The expanded income started
to produce visible returns in the
early '60s when, in 1961, the
Newsservice reported that the
graduate schools' "continuing
effort to recruit top talent from
all sections of the country
reaped an especially rich har
vest from Harvard, Princeton
and Yale."
In 1963, the News Service re
ported comparable gains in the

undergraduate classes, point
ing out that the freshmen men
had a median grade point aver
age (CPA) ot 3.8, while the
women had a median GPA of
3.9. In 1954, by contrast, the
News Service could report only
that a third of the freshman
class had had an "A" average in
high school.
In 1964, the University placed
12 departments in the top 10 of
the country, compared to five in
1954 and two in 1925 (as mea
sured by the American Council
of Education). The University
had unquestionably moved
into the upper echelons of
higher education, but much of
the funds that had made possi
ble the school's rise to promi
nence had come from the fed
eral government in support of
classified weapons research.
During the Cold War of the
'50s and early '60s, few mem
bers of the University commun
ity questioned the legitimacy of
such support; most held to the
belief, expressed by Terman,
that "science and technology
(were) vital to the national wel
fare" and that "if America was
to meet the challenge of Rus
sia," universities would have to
acquire "a new importance."
The studehts of the '60s,
however, felt differently; they
had grown up in peace, not
war, and they believed that
government research funds
should support humane, not
destructive, activities. More
concerned about the nation's
social welfare than its military
defense, the new generation of
students prompted Sterling to
ask in 1968:
"Who foresaw in 1945 that
within 20 years public discus
sion of our national domestic
problems would have so much
to say about ghettos and urban
renewal, about schools, about
air and water pollution, about
natural conservation, about

civil rights . . . The old order
has indeed changed, yielding
place to the new, and we probe
and ponder ways of dealing
with the new."
In the years that followed,
the University would indeed
struggle to adapt to the new.
In April 1969, new President
Kenneth Pitzer carried to the
Board of Trustees a message
from students calling for an end
to the campus' classified re
search. Pitzer told the Board
that it should "pay heed to the
voices of change."
One week later, more than
400 students staged a peaceful
nine day sit-in at the applied
electronics laboratory (AEL) to
protest its $2 million classified
weapons research program.
The Daily editorialized that the
protestors couldn't be sure

they had found "the most effec
tive way to bring about the
changes they (saw) as so vital."
Nonetheless, the Daily con
tinued, "the will of those who
are concerned with the direc
tion of this society must be ex
pressed, and it must be expres
sed quickly. People are dying.
More citizens must be led to
share the urgency that is being
expressed at AEL."
In May 1969, 200 students,
members of the radical April 3
Movement (A3M), seized En
cina Hall in support of demands
to bring the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) under tighter
control and to end its classified
research.
Some of the demonstrators
smashed glass doors and
gained entrance to locked of
fices by force, and the next day,


If the Daily is any indication of campus sentiment, the Stanford community a month before Pearl
Harbor had developed a keen awareness of the growing crises abioad. At the same time, however,
it was not about to be distracted from important intramural contests at home.

Calling for an end to ROTC classes on campus, about 25 stu
dents jammed the military justice class of Maj. C. Darrell Kirk
land in April 1970. The demonstrators disrupted the class by
chanting "off ROTC," hoping, as one student said, "To turn that
classroom into our classroom."
the Daily editorialized that the
sit-in stood as "a monument to
misguided student revolt, re
volt sure to achieve nothing it
seeks, unless it seeks destruc
tion."
The Board of Trustees re
jected the demands of A3M and
decided to cut the University's
ties with SRI, but the Academic
Senate approved a ban on vir
tually all of the University's
classified research activity.
In the spring of 1970, 500 stu

dents and faculty members
gathered in Memorial Church
to protest the presence of Re
serve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) programs on campus,
and a few weeks after that, stu
dents and faculty staged an
anti-ROTC strike that brought
almost all U ni versify classes to a
standstill.
The Faculty Senate voted
shortly thereafter to end credit
for ROTC classes, and by June
1973, the ROTC programs had

been phased out altogether.
In the intervening years,
other protests would stir the
campus, and many students,
demonstrating against the draft
and the war in Indochina,
would participate in marches,
rallies and sit-ins that ended in
mass arrests and the explosion
of tear gas cannisters.
But as the American role in
Vietnam diminished, and as the
draft came to an end, most
members of the University

community directed their atten
tion away from Stanford's polit
ical affairs and toward the more
traditional concerns of educa
tion. In October 1972, Provost
William Miller told the D<i//y
that the era of "confrontation
type politics" on campus was
over.
Joel Smith, vice president for
development—and in the early
'70s dean of student affairs —
said last spring, "It simply is a
fact that the protest movement
was a faint facsimile of itself
when selective service ended."
Economic factors also played
a part in the return to a more
peaceful campus. With the re
cession of 1973, many students
persuaded themselves that
their future security demanded
greater devotion to their books.
Recalling the "dramatic cul
tural change" between 1970
and 1974, Smith said, "There
came a generation of students
in the earlv '70s who were the
brothers and sisters of people
who had been damaged by the
'60s.
"There came a generation
who . . . knew of casualties,
and they turned to a straighter,
more secure course."
In April 1977, however, stu
dents resurrected memories of
the campus in the Vietnam era,

as they raised their voices in
protest against a different, if not
new, form of University in
volvement in foreign affairs.
This time, the protesters cal
led for an end to the Universi
ty's investments in corpora
tions doing business with the
apartheid nation of South Af
rica. To call attention to their
views, 500 demonstrators
staged a peaceful 16 hour sit-in
at the Old Union, and, after fail
ing to disperse, 294 were ar
rested.
Organized by the Stanford
Committee for a Responsible
Investment (SCRIP), the clap
ping and chanting protesters
demanded that the Trustees
vote the University's 94,000
shares in Ford Motor Company
in favor of a shareholder resolu
tion mandating withdrawal
from South Africa.
The Board, however, voted
to abstain on the Ford resolu
tion, choosing instead to make
its views known in writing to
the president of Ford and to the
executives of other University
supported corporations doing
business with South Africa.
This last spring, the Board
reversed this position, voting to
support a shareholder resolu
tion that would force Wells
Fargo Bank — of which the

University holds 186,250 shares
— to end loans to the apartheid
regime.
The Board also supported a
moratorium on loans to Chile's
repressive government by both
Wells Fargo and Chase Manhat
tan banks, concluding that the
loans "contribute to substantial
social injury."
The Trustees added, how
ever, that if political repression
were the sole test for invest
ment in nations, both American
business and universities
would have to "avoid most of
the nations of the world."
In later actions, the Board
would support shareholder
proposals calling for "nonex
pansion" of corporate activity
in South Africa — proposals
that would end sales by Ford,
for example, to the South Afri
can police and military.
The Daily editorialized that it
was "pleased with the trustees'
actions," though it added that
the Board did not go far
enough. The University, the
Daily said, should "begin draft
ing its own resolutions calling
for the withdrawal (of the cor
porations) from South Africa."
Echoing a sentiment expres
sed in the SRI controversy a de
cade earlier, the Daily added:
"We do not feel that Univer

sity divestment from non
progressive corporations is the
answer. We feel the University
can have a greater impact if it
works from within."
Now, as the University be
gins its 89th year, it does not
encounter the specters of vio
lence and vehement reaction
that haunted it 10 years ago.
But as it continues to deal
with the complicated world
which, in the last 25 years, it has
directly helped to build and
shape, it finds itself in the mid
dle of conflict over contempor
ary global issues.
The University now provides
much more than Senator Stan
ford had originally hoped — a
practical education that might
be preparatory to a professional
career.
Rather, it provides both a
philosophical and practical
education, an education
strengthened by the prestige of
a quarter-century of outstand
ing research and a decade of
conscientious — if sometimes
contentious — social and politi
cal debate.

In May 1977 about 450 demonstrators marched on President Richard Lyman's office demanding
that the University vote for shareholder resolutions against investment in South Africa.
The chant of some 400 stu
dents reverberated through the
inner quadrangle as Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford
mounted a flower-covered plat
form to dedicate a new univer
sity.
Built on their Palo Alto horse
farm, the university had been
named by the Stanfords after
their late son, Leland Junior,
who had succumbed to tvphus
in IHH4.
As the dedication ceremonies
commenced on that bree/y Oc
tober 1, 1891, none of the as
sembled students and guests

"Who foresinv in 1945 that within 20 years discussion of our national
problems would have so much to say about ghettos, schools, pollution, civil
rights?. . . The old order has changed, yielding to the new, and we ponder
ways of dealing with the new." -President J.E. Wallace Sterling, 1968

could anticipate the school's
role in shaping the America that
emerged in the '50s, '60s and
'70s; they could not know that
Stanford would help to develop
America's technology and then
to question its morality.
On that Indian summer day
88 years ago, all was innocent
and untainted; the University,
saiil its new president, David
Starr Jordan, was "hallowed by
no traditions, hampered by
none. Its finger-posts all point
forward."
For the next 50 years, the
University did move forward,
surviving financial troubles
when its founders died and
physical devastation ■ when
struck by the 1906 earthquake.
The school moved forward

quietly, however, because it did
not replicate the philosophical
and classical curricula of the
Eastern colleges.
Because the senator believed
that education should be di
rected toward "usefulness in
life," the University stressed a
practical education that pre
pared the students for success
in the professions. Because the
senator scorned the curriculua
of the Eastern schools — "Of all
the young men who come to me
with letters of introduction
from the East," he said, "the
most helpless are college young
men —" his University for
years to come would never in
vite comparison with them.

In 1912, Frederick Terman, a
freshman that year and later a
University provost, found that
the University had the reputa
tion of being "a well regarded
but not great scholarly institu
tion. "The school, he recalled in
a Daily interview last year, "had
a few points of national distinc
tion," but it did not have nearly
"the star-studded faculty" that
a school such as Harvard had.
Fourteen years later, Rixford
Snyder, a freshman then and
later a history professor here,
considered Stanford "a very
fine regional university." How
ever, he added, he and his
classmates "in no way" be
lieved that Stanford ranked
"with Harvard or Princeton or
Yale or MIT."

The Depression almost
ruined whatever reputation the
University did have by the end
of the '20s. Private donations
shrank and enrollments de
clined, and the University had
difficulty maintaining its exist
ing facilities — let alone con
structing new ones. The lib
raries fell behind in their acquis
itions; the science and engineer
ing laboratories could not ac
quire new equipment.
Furthermore, though World
War 11 restored the health of the
nation, it did little to check
Stanford's flagging fortunes.
The University, Terman recal
led, emerged from the war as
"an underprivileged institu

tion," one that had neither con
tributed significantly to nor be
nefitted from "any of the excit
ing engineering activity as
sociated with the war."
It was not until after the war
that Stanford's fortunes began
to change — dramatically — as
Provost Terman recognized
and capitalized on the federal
government's continued in
terest in military research at
universities.
"As the end of the war ap
proached," Terman wrote in
1962, it was clear that the gov
ernment would continue to
support defense-related re
search; such activity was seen
as "necessary to maintain our
future military position." Even
then, Terman said, "one could

see a troubled world ahead."
Because of this foresight,
Terman continued, "Stanford
go* really a two- or three-year
head start on nearly every other
university in the country in re
search activity."
Terman helped to bring to
Stanford in 1946 two federal
contracts that keyed the Uni
versity's post-war emergence
as a vigorous and prestigious
school: one contract helped
physicist Felix Bloch exploit the
results of a remarkable discov
ery, nuclear magnetic reso
nance, and earn him a Nobel
Prize, and another supported
research in electronics.
This latter contract became
the basis of a $5 million annual
research program that would
help to attract 200 electronics
firms to within 50 miles of the
University.
The companies now include
such industrial giants as Lock
heed, IBM and General Elec
tric, and, Terman said, they
have provided the Peninsula
with "an exciting environment
that aids in the recruiting of fa
culty." In addition, Terman
continued, the firms help Stan
ford's competitive position "by
providing attractive consulting
opportunities for faculty mem
bers."
Indeed, one could say that
the government research grants
were, as J.E. Wallace Sterling,
president of the University
from 1949-68 said, "a hidden
form of federal aid."
The University, however, did
not draw all of its support from
the federal treasury, because it
also benefitted from a Ford
Foundation grant of $24 mill
ion, which the University
matched with a $72 million
fund-raising effort of its own.
These contributions, the Daily
reported at the time, completed
a $100 million donation drive
that set a new record for pri
vate support in capital cam
paigns of American univer
sities.
As donations increased,
Stanford also acquired a sig
nificant amount of income from
its 8250 acres of land, among
the most valuable in the nation.
Establishing the Stanford
Shopping Center and the Stan
ford Industrial Park in the '50s,
the University started to bring
in from leases revenues that
now total more than $1 million
annually.
The expanded income started
to produce visible returns in the
early '60s when, in 1961, the
Newsservice reported that the
graduate schools' "continuing
effort to recruit top talent from
all sections of the country
reaped an especially rich har
vest from Harvard, Princeton
and Yale."
In 1963, the News Service re
ported comparable gains in the

undergraduate classes, point
ing out that the freshmen men
had a median grade point aver
age (CPA) ot 3.8, while the
women had a median GPA of
3.9. In 1954, by contrast, the
News Service could report only
