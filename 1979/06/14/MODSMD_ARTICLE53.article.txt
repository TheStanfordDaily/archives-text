# Visions of red tile & sandstone: an historical tour of the campus
## 
### 
When Diivid Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
of 1841 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head of
S.in Francisco Bay. Bounding it
on the southwest rises . . . the
Sierra de la Santa C'ru/ — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its
cloak ot redwood, oak and
madrono diversified bv thickets
of chemisal. . . .

"On the east, opposing the
given ridges ot the I ioly Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south ot San Francisco, its
favorable climate assured by its
situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. I eland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San I rancisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanford's
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 (.rant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of technology, and the

prominent landscape architect,
Frederick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grain fields below,
at a point that marks one corner
of the Inner Quadrangle. The
senator felt the flat site was
more practical for later expan
sion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the grounds
and the buildings, but it re
mained for the young Boston
architect, Charles Allerton

Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richardso
nian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive halt-circle
arches supported by short col
umns with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church and
three engineering buildings,
Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women were ready for
the Universitv'sopening on Oc
tober 1, 1841.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les-

son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White
of Cornell pronounced the
Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for4s seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused
millions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church to
wer, with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel
of Memorial Church, and the
concussion blew out the front
wall. The rose window and the
huge Venetian mosaic of the

Sermon on the Mount that had
graced the facade lay as rubble
in the inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization — was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed .
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known
as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in
May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction
project that was begun in 1886
and that has been intermit
tently continued up to the pre
sent.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved bv the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central por
tion running from El Camino
Real to the back boundary in the
foothills.
I he areas designated for light
industrial, commercial, profes
sional and residential leases lie
on either side of the academic
reserve, along San Francisquito
Creek and along Page Mill
Road.
Academic facilities
Within the 5000 acre
academic reserve are:
— the academic plant — the
quads and other classroom
buildings, laboratories, lib
raries, residence halls, athletic
facilities — which occupies2ooo
acres.
— homes for faculty mem
bers, which take up 500 acres;
— and some 2500 acres that

lie in open land, including the
arboretum, golf course and the
foothill lands used for space
probing antennae and research
in nuclear physics and biologi
cal sciences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the president and his staff, date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the outer
quad was completed in 1903,
the same year that Memorial
Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of con
struction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanford's deep religious faith,
though tliev were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and be
nevolent Creator, and that
obedience to 1 lis laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
in the original plans, the
central site now occupied by the
church was reserved for it,
though construction was defer
red. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow de
termined that the church
would be built as a memorial to
him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permission
to copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict
ing the historv of redemption.
The largest mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 figures,
depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spir ?,
housing clocks and chimes, v\ is
never rebuilt.
Hoover's erection
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) houses the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution,
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
material to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of

this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who prom
ote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hitler
and the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War 1, the au
ditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11.
The main auditorium seats 1700
and Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot landscaped
area donated to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons.
The focal point of the plaza is a
tall, free-form fountain exe
cuted in bronze by San Fran
cisco sculptor Aristides Demet
rios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which con
tains several student services —
the plaza is a campus cros
sroads.
Tresidder, named in memory
of Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
alumnus and fourth president
of the University, contains the
usual student union facilities of
food service, small store,
lounge and student govern
ment offices. In addition, it con
tains a community center with
meeting rooms, music listening
rooms, art gallery and record,
tape and reading libraries.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San
Francisco into its quarters in
1959. The $21 million structure
consists of three sections the
hospital, the outpatient clinics
and the teaching laboratories
and classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million
facility. The school resides in
four buildings: the Robert
Crown library, which can seat
the entire law student body at

the same time; Frederick I.
Richman Hall, which contains
the classrooms and moot court;
the James Irvine Gallery, which
contains the faculty and stu
dent meeting rooms and
lounges; and 600-person
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains a
unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings, oak
dotted savannahs, chaparral,
redwoods, streams and pools.
The preserve is used regularly
for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the world's most produc
tive and varied programs of
ionospheric and interplanetary

radio investigation. Its scien
tists made the first radar contact
with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary
gases bv means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along
Sand Hill Road. The $114 mill
ion machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1%6, fires the
electron down a straight slen
der tube rather than whirling
protons in circles, as most atom
smashers do. The machine de
velops an energy of 20 billion
electron volts.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s end, the Univer
sity draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the
early '60s in which the Univer-

sity has attempted to meet its
big post-war expansion in stu
dents and faculty.
vn the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements,
including campus landmarks
such as Maples Pavilion, Meyer
Library, the Green Library an
nex, the Terman Engineering
Center and the Mudd chemis
try building.
Now, however, as the Uni
versity stabilizes its population,
it plans fewer major building
projects for the next 10 years.
According to Assistant Pro
vost Susan Schofield, the Uni
versity's appearance will not
change dramatically in the next
decade, though it may go ahead
with plans for a new music facil
ity behind Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and a new $25 million,
800-student dormitory complex

on the west side of Lagunita
Court. The dorm, Schofield
said, could be open as early as
September 1482.
But construction projects
such as these do depend largely
on the beneficence of Univer
sity donors (including the fed
eral government), and in this
inflationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.
If, however, Stanford does
attract the required support, it
might continue to build right
through the 100 th anniversary
of that day in 1886 when
Senator Stanford decided to lo
cate his new university on the
site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding
horses ought to be good
enough for teaching students.

buildings' buff sandstone was freighted from a quarry south of San Jose.


In 45 seconds the great 1906 earthquake took two lives at the
University and caused millions of dollars of damage.


The Frederick E. Terman Engineering Center, opened in 1977,
is a gift from the Hewlett and Packard families. The center is
noted for its energy efficient construction.
