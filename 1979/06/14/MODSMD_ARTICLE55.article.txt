# COP promises 'open door'
## 
### 
Promising to have an open
door to student concerns, Sibby
Freeman, Laura Mead, Tom
Gart and Mary Leßalanc next
week resume their one year
term as members of the ASSU
Council of Presidents.
Elected last spring by 59.4
percent of the students voting,
the Freeman slate ran on a
well-defined platform that
promised more student in
volvement in the ASSU gov
ernment and the University as a
whole.
"Anyone who is frustrated
can come to us," Gart, a junior
and former ASSU senator, said
in April. "We'd like all the
people we talked to door-to
door" during the campaign to
"come see us with ideas—we'll
have an open door."
The co-presidents em

phasized during the campaign
their experience in dealing with
student affairs.
Freeman, a Masters candi
date in Anthropology, has
worked for four years as a resi
dent assistant and administra
tive assistant in Roble Hall.
Mead, a senior in Human
Biology, has served as chairper
son of the Tresidder Program
Board and as a member of the
Governance Task Force.
Senior Anthropology major
Leßlanc has also been a
member of the Tresidder Prog
ram Board and of other Univer
sity committees.
As an ASSU senator, Gart
was associate chairperson of
the senate Rules Committee.
"We have the tools to work
with and the ideas to imple
ment efficient policy," Gart
said. Mead added, "We think
that we can work in the system
and still bring (in) new ideas."
Mead also said that her "big
emphasis" was "to get Tresid
der remodeled, because the
University needs a gathering
spot for students."
Gart, recalling "the frustra
tions" of his year in the senate,
said that he would work closely
with the senators to provide a
stong and representative voice
in University policy-making.
Leßlanc plans to concentrate
her energies on women's issues
and academic affairs, listing

among her priorities the crea
tion of an umbrella organiza
tion for the campus' women's
groups, the development of
greater awareness of women's
safety problems and the at
tainment of more tenured
women professors.

Freeman's interests are fo
cused on the University's resi
dence system and on graduate
affairs. It is in the student resi
dences, he said, that "day-to
day accomplishments take
place and where things can be
effectively changed."
