# Now about the person sharing your room...

Although the rumor goes
around every year that
freshman roommates are as
signed on the basis of height,
there's a lot more to the selec
tion process than that.
Staffers at the Academic In
formation Center (AIC) use
academic, cultural and ex
tracurricular factors to assign
freshmen roommates within
each dorm. They try to assign
matches who are mostly diver
sified in these areas but who
st.ll have some common in
terests and background. Hob
bies, community activities,
sports interests and academic
majors are all considered.
But two people with the same
specific academic interest — or
in the same varsity sport —
usually do not wind up to
gether, because that tends to
encourage inter-room competi
tion.
Little things can make a dif

ference. If someone has played
in a symphony orchestra, for
example, the AIC will not
match that musician with
someone who plays hard rock
all night, without having care
tully considered all of the fac
tors.
The staffers usually pair
Californians with non-
Californians, because the na
tives can often help the state's
newcomers settle in.
The AIC staffers do try to ac
comodate students with special
requests, though they will not
honor requests for a specific
roommate. The AIC tends to
feel that freshmen should be
exposed to someone of a diffe
rent background who they have
never met before.
Friends who have requested
a room together will be put in
the same complex or on the
same side of campus, however,
if other factors don't override.
