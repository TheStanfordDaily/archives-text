# ACADEMIA
## Special programs broaden the horizons of new students 
### Lynne Dombrowski 
"Why are Hamlet, Falstaff,
Lear, juliet and Cleopatra more
alive than you and I?"
This question, asked entic
ingly in Approaching Stanford, is
answered in one of the more
than 70 freshman seminars of
fered here this year.
The University's freshman
seminar program, now in its
15th year, is one of three special
programs that the University
offers to new students to make
their academic lives more
stimulating.
The other programs are
Freshman English and
Freshman Advising.
Since the University intro
duced the seminar program,
John Goheen, professor
emeritus of philosophy and
University ombudsman, has

been associated with it, and he
now heads the program's
Dean's Advisory Committee.
Not enough courses
Asked recently about this
year's offerings in the program,
Goheen said, "We don't have
enough." Although the Uni
versity, he continued, has tried
to provide enough openings in
the program to satisfy the need
of all, "there will be a lot of
people who will be disap
pointed."
Goheen himself teaches a
freshman seminar, and he be
lieves that it and the others give
students a special chance "to
meet closely with a faculty
member." Thanks to the small
size of the seminars, he said,
the students in them have an
"unusual" opportunity for dis
cussion and association with

other students and professors.
"Where the content is suc
cessful and stimulating," he
added, the seminars "open up a
whole new horizon for
freshmen."
The course offerings vary
from year to year, though the
more popular seminars — such
as Goheen's "Philosophy in
Literature" and Douglas Davis'
"Man and His Law" — have
been offered for as many as 10
years.
The number one seminar in
1978-79, judging by freshman
demand, was "The Bible as Lit
erature." This year, the most
popular is "The Scientific and
Humanistic Perspective in the
Modern World," taught by
Helen Brooks, a recent recipient
of a Stanford Ph. D. in English.
Frosh English
The freshmen seminars are
occasionally linked with
another longstanding program,
Freshman English. This prog
ram, however, has been de
signed to help students meet
the University's written com
position requirement, and, un
like the seminar program, it is
not intended to give students
another option for their class
schedule.
Still, the program does offer
new students a wide sole*,
tion of courses from which they
may choose to satisfy the re
quirement.
Yet another program with

which freshmen quickly
become familiar is the advising
program, which involves
members of the University's fa
culty and staff. Tania Granoff,
Information Services Coor
dinator said that this year
about 250 advisors will work
with the freshmen and transfer
students and that each advisor
will have about eight new ad
visees.
Granoff also said that the
program offers those "for
whom everything is new a
chance to make contact With an
adult who has been in the Uni
versity system." The advisors,
she continued, should be used
as "a sounding board, a men
tor," each advisor, "ideally,
would become a friend."
Granoff cautioned, however,
that an advisor is not "an encvc

lopedia of information" and
that some students and ad
visors might be confused or
have mistaken expectations
about what the role of an ad
visor is. Granoff said that dis
cussion between the advisor
and the student of the latter's
academic and professional
goals might help to avoid these

problems.
The Peer Advising Program,
now in its second year, intro
duces upperclassmen to the
advising process by having
them work with specific
freshmen advisors. Last year,
the Learning Assistance
Center, coordinator ot the pro
ject, used Trancos, an a 1 1 -

freshmen dorm, as a trial case,
assigning to it 10 peer advisors.
This year, three all-freshmen
dorms — Branner, Arroyo,
and Rinconada — will partici
pate in the program and will
have in all about 40 peer ad
visors and two coordinators as
signed to them.
