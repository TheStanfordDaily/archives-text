# Western Culture classes rate high

The Western Culture prog
ram begins its second year
here with the possibility loom
ing of its becoming a require
ment for all students, rather
than just another series of elec
tives.
Consisting of seven three
quarter sequences of classes,
the program, said its coor
dinator and Professor of En
glish Ron Rebholz, provides its

students "with a sense of ori
gins and continuity.
"It's good to prefer some
thing after contemplating it,
after reflecting on it,"he said,
"rather than just preferring it
because it is what one has im
mediately inherited from one's
folks."
The Faculty Senate will prob
ably decide this fall whether or
not to institute a Western Cul
ture sequence as a University
requirement. Stanford has not
had such a requirement since
the Western Civilization classes
were abandoned about 10 years
ago.
Great works
This year the University will
again offer Western Culture
1,2,3, a series of classes that was
introduced as a pilot program
last year and which em
phasizes, Rebholz said, "great
works of the culture, from the
ancient world to the earlier 20th
century."
These classes, Rebholz con
tinued, averaged 80 students
per quarter last year and re

ceived a "very, very favorable"
response, "both to the courses
and to the teachers."
In 1979-80, the Western Cul
ture program is expanding to
include four relatively new
three-quarter sequences, as
well as three other series of
popular and longstanding clas
ses.
Of the former, there is, in ad
dition to Western Culture 1,2,3,
"Ideas in Western Culture A, B,
C," classes that are offered by
the Philosophy and Religious
Studies departments and that
study "The Birth of Western
Philosophy," "Faith and
Reason," and"The World De
mystified."
The Western Culture prog
ram also includes a sequence ot
courses that each quarter
studies the development of a
different theme in literature.
This series — "Western Cul
ture: A Thematic Approach" —
Rebholz said, is "a collabora
tive, almost comparative, litera
ture course."
The fourth track that's being

offered for the first time this
year, and that will begin Winter
quarter and continue next
spring and fall, is "Western
Culture and Technology 11,12,
13, an offering of the Program
in Values, Technology and Soc
iety.
According to Rebholz, the
professors in these classes will
"try to do something extremely
exciting and difficult, which is
to place technology in its histor
ical context, to understand the
role of technology in the de
velopment of Western culture."
The other three options
within the Western Culture
program are the Structured
Liberal Education program
(SLE); Humanities 61, 62, 63;
and History 1,2,3. The latter,
Rebholz said, will have a re
vised syllabus, so as to include
some material from the period
prior to the Reformation.
Rebholz also said that open
ings remain in all of the sequ
ences except SLE, and he en
courages entering students to
give one or more of them a trv.
