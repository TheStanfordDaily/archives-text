# At the Learning Assistance Center
## Good students get better 
### 
At Stanford, where the aver
age high school grade point av
erage of entering freshmen is
3.8, some of the most popular
classes teach students how to
study.
Offered by the Learning As
sistance Center (LAC), the
courses help students improve
their reading and vocabulary
abilities and sharpen their
learning skills.
But unlike learning centers at
many other schools, the LAC is

not primarily a remedial
centerâ€”though students with
academic problems are cer
tainly encouraged to take ad
vantage of the LAC's facilities.
The LAC designs its prog
rams to serve the needs of very
bright, able learners, and thus it
not only helps students learn
more efficiently, but it also of
fers nine classes that teach stu
dents the skills of tutoring and
peer counseling.
In addition, the center pro

vides non-credit workshops on
time management, test prep
aration and test anxiety, and it
offers a full range of reference
material on reading and study
skills.
Located in Meyer 123, the
LAC has served more than 1000
students a year since its incep
tion in 1972. Although the
center is funded by theOrfice of
the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, more than 10 percent of
the student clients are graduate
students.
The center has helped to de
velop tutoring programs in in
dividual departments, such as
the Physics Reference Frame,
the Chemistry Information
Room and the Math Consulting
Center, and it has also de
veloped courses and services
for faculty and staff.
Students may enroll in credit
courses or the non-credit work
shops, or they may drop in at
the center anytime during the
quarter for individual help.
