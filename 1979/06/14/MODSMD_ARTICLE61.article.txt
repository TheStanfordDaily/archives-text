I never let my schooling in
terfere with my education,"
Mark Twain once said.
The writer could not have
been more right, because stu
dents in rigorous academic
programs often find that their
classwork shelters them from
the realities and rigors of the
"real" world—and perhaps
leads them to a misunderstand
ing of it.
The Office of Extra De
partmental Programs attempts
to correct this potential problem
with four programs designed to
round out undergraduates'
academic education. Funded by
the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies, the prog
rams offer student oppor
tunities to conduct research, to
participate in group or indi
vidual student-initiated pro

jects and to work in the com
munity.
Student-initiated projects
and internships are offered for
academic credit by the Student
Center for Innovation in Re
search and Education (SCIRE).
It also draws on a $4000 fund to
help finance innovative pro
jects not intended for academic
credit.
The center also serves as a
clearinghouse of information
on research and internship op
portunities on campus and in
the area.
The Undergraduate Research
Opportunities program offers
students a chance to do profes
sional research for a professor
in any one of a number of fields.
The office fills research jobs in
six general categories: engineer
ing, social science, humanities,

education/psychologv, the
physical sciences and biology/
medicine. About 1 (X) professors
offer more than 120 research
positions throughout the year.
The office also enourages
students to design their own re
search projects, using the prog
ram office as their resource.
Students in all projects receive
credit at the rate of one unit per
three hours academic work per
week, and, according to Laura
Selznick, program director,
"about five percent of the posi
tions are paid."
The Undergraduate Special
Program offers a curriculum
that resembles those provided
by free universities —except
that Stanford's program enjoys
a bit more legitemacy and sup
port.
This year, the program will

provide courses that encom
pass a wide variety of topics,
including, for example, "Cor
poration and Society," "Intro
duction to Ornithology," "Op
era Seminar" (in which stu
dents buy opera tickets instead
of books), "Stock Options,"
"I'araphychology Seminar,"
"Unexplained Phenomena"
(the Loch Ness monster strikes
again) and "Women and Com
petence: Responding to Social
Change."
The Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) was initiated by stu
dents in 1969 in an effort to in
volve students in solving ur
gent social and political prob
lems. In the past, SWOPSI
workshops have enabled stu
dents to work with exceptional
children, to study the role of
women in local government
and to teach swimming to
nearby disabled children.
SWOPSI workshops com
bine academic analysis with di
rect action. Every workshop in
cludes an "action project," such
as writing and publishing a
booklet, organizing a public
forum or film series, or volun
teering in a community agency.
Workshops for the Autumn
Quarter include: Whales and
Whaling, Politics and Action
and The Politics of Radiation.
SWOPSI also serves as a re
source center for the develop
ment by students of public
events and programs ofan edu
cational nature. In addition,
though the majority of the in
structors in SWOPSI courses
are members of the community,
students are welcome to work
with SWOPSI in the develop
ment and instruction of their
own workshops.

pass a wide variety of topics,
including, for example, "Cor
poration and Society," "Intro
duction to Ornithology," "Op

The Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) was initiated by stu
dents in 1969 in an effort to in
volve students in solving ur
gent social and political prob
lems. In the past, SWOPSI
workshops have enabled stu
dents to work with exceptional
children, to study the role of
women in local government
and to teach swimming to
nearby disabled children.
SWOPSI workshops com
bine academic analysis with di
rect action. Every workshop in
cludes an "action project," such
as writing and publishing a
booklet, organizing a public
forum or film series, or volun
teering in a community agency.
Workshops for the Autumn
Quarter include: Whales and
Whaling, Politics and Action
and The Politics of Radiation.
SWOPSI also serves as a re
source center for the develop
ment by students of public
events and programs ofan edu
cational nature. In addition,
though the majority of the in
structors in SWOPSI courses
are members of the community,
students are welcome to work
with SWOPSI in the develop
ment and instruction of their
own workshops.
