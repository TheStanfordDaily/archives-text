# Classes you won't want to miss

### Brad Brockbank 
The most common miscon
ception among entering stu
dents who have nerd-like ten
dencies is that the freshman
class schedule must consist of
such courses as Math 41,
Chemistry 31 and Physics 21.
While each of these classes
begins a well-attended, infor
mative series of courses here at
Stanford, anyone who piles
two out of three on the same
study list may find themselves
getting to know intimately the
carrels of Meyer Library.
If you find yourself with a
roommate who shows signs of
impending nerd-ism, it is up to
you to set that person back on
the road to peace of mind and
time away from the library.
Fortunately, Stanford offers a
number of popular courses
which avoid the rigorous
problem-set lifestyle of math,
physics and chem.
The following is a list of a
number of courses that many
returning students have found
interesting, enjoyable and
thought-provoking. The list is
by no means complete, but it
should aid you in the prepara
tion of a balanced course
schedule.
Survey courses
Survey courses are designed
to give students a broad over
view of a subject, without the
rigorous detail of upper divi
sion courses. Some of the more
popular are:
Economics 1: This course,
taught by the respected John
Gurley, is one of the most
widely-taken courses each fall.
Students are taught the basics
of economic theory and
analysis, and though these
might be a bit tedious at times,
they are considered extremely
valuable for students today.

Psychology 1: Taught by
Phillip Zimbardo, a nationally
renowned expert on shyness
(among other things), this class
is lively and interesting and will
not load you down with work.
History 1: Modern Europe: A
difficult but very rewarding
course. Although the workload
is significant, it is, for the most
part, enjoyable.
Art 1: The subject matter is
the strong point of this course,
which is billed as "a topical in
troduction to the history and
appreciation of architecture,
sculpture and painting."
Anthropology 1: Social and
Cultural Anthropology, taught
by Arthur Wolf, is the first
course of a quasi-sequence
which is gaining in popularity.
Anthro 1 and 2 (Problems in
Anthropology) are both fas
cinating courses that give stu
dents an appreciation of the di
versity of the human species.
Philosophy 1: God, Self and
World. Your basic survey
course in a field that few have
experience with (but many find
very intriguing). Athletics for
the mind.
Lesser Known,
but recommended
Besides the survey courses,
there are also a number of
courses that are not as large but
still receive high praise from
those who have taken them.
These include:
Political Science 35: How
Nations Deal with Each Other.
A good general course for
everyone and especially re
commended for students who
may wish to continue in his
tory, political science or inter
national relations.
Political Science 10: Ameri

can Government — everything
you wanted to know about it,
and didn't care to ask. This
course has a significant work
load, but most students have
found it very valuable.
Applied Physics 15: The Na
ture of the Universe. An ex
cellent overview of the Big
Picture — our universe —
covering discussion of all sorts
of fascinating phenomena. The
workload is relatively light and
makes a fine addition to course
schedules which inlcude more
intensive classes.
Humanities 61: Western
Thought and Literature. "The
World ot Classical Antiquity,"
taught by Antony Raubitschek,
is popular in part because of the
reputation of this fine instruc
tor.

not load you down with work.
History 1: Modern Europe: A
difficult but very rewarding
course. Although the workload
is significant, it is, for the most
part, enjoyable.
Art 1: The subject matter is
the strong point of this course,
which is billed as "a topical in
troduction to the history and
appreciation of architecture,
sculpture and painting."
Anthropology 1: Social and
Cultural Anthropology, taught
by Arthur Wolf, is the first
course of a quasi-sequence
which is gaining in popularity.

Anthropology) are both fas
cinating courses that give stu
dents an appreciation of the di
versity of the human species.
Philosophy 1: God, Self and
World. Your basic survey
course in a field that few have
experience with (but many find
very intriguing). Athletics for
the mind.
Lesser Known,
but recommended
Besides the survey courses,
there are also a number of
courses that are not as large but
still receive high praise from
those who have taken them.
These include:

ture of the Universe. An ex
cellent overview of the Big
