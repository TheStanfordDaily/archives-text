# Checking out the libraries
## 
### 
Although originally lib
raries may have been in
tended as repositories of
printed knowledge — and
no more — they are now
buildings in which students
seeking knowledge may set
tle for protracted periods.
Libraries today thus have
a function: they serve as
storehouses of information,
and they offer themselves as
places to commune with that
information.
Stanford's Cecil B. Green
Library is a good example of
a library that is predomin
antly storehouse in concep
tion: it does an excellent job
of keeping a great many
books (almost a million at
last count) dry and free form
the depradations of hungry

rodents, and it is relatively
non-conducive to serious
studying.
The library is also full of
echos and wintry drafts
(both aggravated, if not
caused, by the study areas'
high ceilings), and it has
chairs and tables that belong
to an older, less upholstered
age.
On the other hand,
Meyer, the undergraduate
library, excels in its function
as a temple of communion.
Students may enter Meyer
on a Saturday afternoon and
find it filled with academic
devotees, all raptly com
muning, barely able to tear
themselves away as closing
time nears.

The Earth Sciences Lib
rary has comfortable furni
ture and study areas well
integrated among the books,
but the. building's
large windowsand high ceil
ings keep the library's temp
eratures a bit too cool.
The Biology Dept. Library
has large and varied study
areas, as well as outside
patios, and it is probably one
of the University's finest lib
raries.
The graduate school lib
raries should not be ignored:
the Business Library is well
furnished and comfortable,
and the Law School Library
is plush, though it fre
quently suffers from uncom
fortable extremes of temper
ature.
