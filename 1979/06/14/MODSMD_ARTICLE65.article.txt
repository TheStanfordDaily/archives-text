# ADMINISTRATION
## For the third time ever: Dean Hargadon admits all 
### 
Editor's note: While some freshmen might not be the least bit
surprised that they were accepted by Stanford, and others might
be utterly baffled by their admission - considering which
friends back home did NOT get in - Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon appears relatively content with his admissions pro
cess.
He talked about the annual rite of spring recently with a Daily
staffer who himself just went through the admission process.
After this Daily interview, the third in less than two years, we
are pleased to inform Dean Hargadon that we have accepted the
majority of his answers.

How do you go about selecting the 2500 students you
admit out of the 12,000 who apply?
It's kind of a winnowing process. There isn't a set of
measures, all of which are graded on the same scale, all of
which are toted up at the end ... I hate to use this
analogy, (but) it's like cream rising to the top, though that
doesn't mean there isn't a heck lot more cream that rises
than we can scoop out for our freshman class.
It's clear that if anyone read 12,000 applications and
had any experience at it that he'd select 90 percent of the
same people we end up selecting, because they do sort
out.
But we don't start out looking at a low set of scores and
say, "Aha, out of it." We actually almost out of curiosity
ask why someone with those low scores (would) want to
apply. We don't start out and say, "Here's someone with
high scores: automatically in." We look at it and say,
"Gee, that's an awfully good set of scores; I wonder if
they've had a good academic program, what their in
terests are, how lively they are."
Which elements of an application — such as grades,
test scores, recommendations, the essay — are the most
important? How do you balance them?
We don't balance them in the sense of structuring the
freshman class, because remember, we don't know
which 1500 of the 2500 admitted are going to come. But
there are a lot of areas (that are important); the main ones
are academic: "Does the candidate have a good solid
academic program?"
It is true that a student with more modest test scores but
a very solid performance and a very good academic prog
ram will have a better chance of getting in than someone
with a lot of ability but not much accomplishment in
academic terms — that is, having taken a really light
academic program or having taken any kind of program
and not done well.
So grades and academic program are really key, and
then the test scores. The test scores give you a feel for the
special skills of each candidate and the competition in
each school. If someone has a lot of high test scores in
science areas (for example), you may be sitting on a very

top science student ....
But never is it one thing alone; it is a combination of
things. And then the energy level — that's the brag sheet
part. We know a lot of (what makes) residential education
is students bumping off against each other — so you
would not want to pick 1500 who ended up sitting in their
rooms never doing anything — never being in the or
chestra, never being in any of the dorm plays ... A lot of
what goes on in this place is what students do ....
Now, for the most part, because there are blue chip
musicians and blue chip athletes, we don't look at the
candidates and say, "Aha, here's someone who's played
soccer and been editor of the newspaper and they will
come and play soccer and be editor." But you know that
chances are that they are going to come and do something
They are going to get out and meet people, participate

and contribute. (We) can make choices that take the
academic thing and then ask for plusses beyond that in
terms of how they are going to contribute to each other as
they go through.
The whole application seems to be a bit more relaxed
than most. The book essay — the now traditional book
essay — for example; what kinds of things do you learn
from that?
The former traditional book essay. Well, we think of an
application as a set ot hooks — eight or nine hooks. We
don't know among the people out there who are going to
apply who's going to hang their hats on which hooks. So
we don't have so many points for the essay. What we
have is an application that is brief enough that they're
going to complete it but open enough that they get to
show themselves in the areas that they're best in.
We stuck for a long time with a question that we think
has no right or wrong answer; if we had trick
questions — (such as,) "Who would be your favorite per
son in the 19th century?" — an awful lot of candidates
would spend time trying to figure out who my favorite
person in the 19th century would have been.
So we try to have it so that it's open and so that they can
use it in a fairly broad way. For some, it will be so well
done that it will catch our eye; for a lot of them, it's just out
of reach and they won't do much at all ....
Now we are changing that question, for the sake of
reading something different. The thing we do most is
read applications; we like reading them; it's time
consuming but important. But we have to change for
ourselves, once and awhile, and I got this great idea this
summer while re-reading this book, Here at The New
Yorker, that had something about somebody's favorite
game, which was to ask somebody, "If you had to sum
yourself up in one adjective, what would it be?"
So we decided two things this year: we're still going to
use one page (for essays), but we're going to have two
brief essays. One will say, "Each of us can be described by
a number of adjectives, but if you had to select one, what

would you select, and why?" And we think they'll have a
good time with that.
Now the first reaction we had was that they'll look at
the rest of the application and see the kinds of things
we're asking the teachers about and then pick one of
those areas. That's okay, because the task in that is not
seeing all the adjectives people apply; it's selecting the
one that they think best summarizes and then explaining
why ....
It then struck us that while that (question) might be
great tor those who are fairly introspective, (it would not
be so great for) the one who's really out there in the
boondocks and (who) wouldn't even think in those
terms. So the second one they have to answer is, "What
event or person has most influenced you up to this point
and why?"
It's not that we say that there are certain good events to
have and certain good adjectives to have. It's a vehicle for
them to say, "I'm Kent Walker, and this is how you get to
know me a little better than you can know me otherwise
by my grades and my test scores."
How does the class of '83 differ from past classes?
I'm not sure that it really differs, and that may be a good
or bad thing ... I don't know because 1 don't know what
they'll be like going through. There are more minority
students, but the absolute numbers are not that much
greater. We were this last year in the year after (the Alan)
Bakke (case), and we were watching the percentage in
crease .... We were happy that we didn't have any
fallback in that.
Were you trying to implement affirmative action?
Yes, but in the sami 1 way that we have done (so) in the
past. We make special efforts to identify minority stu
dents across the country and get them interested.
But being a minority student doesn't carry extra
weight in the admissions process?
No. Background is the big factor, and experience, and
