# Admissions boss reveals amazing secrets
## 
### 
it's true that for most minority students, their background
would really be different from (that of) many of the other
candidates we see. But there are many non-minority stu
dents who have backgrounds similar in nature, at least
socio-economically, and we have also always made sure
that that was a factor that we looked at as well for non
minority students.
We have never been in and hope never to be in a situa
tion where a class is structured so that in any characteris
tic you can name there's only one kind of student who fits
that characteristic, whether it be socio-economic or any
thing else.
Was the quality of applicants this year as high as it has
been in the past?
Yes, but I made a point (in a memo sent last year to high
schools criticizing the lack of college preparation given to
many high school students) that we were not making too
many claims thitf the quality of applicants had fallen here
But we have had requests for 15,000 copies of that letter
from schools, teachers and school boards all over. What
you sense is that (there are many people) who are con
cerned that one shouldn't have to drop a language to take
driver's ed. To the extent that we were able to support
the people in those L"hools who want (stronger prog
rams), that memo has served a good purpose.
It's also been used by students who don't have a strong
counseling program; we can send that memo because it
illustrates some kinds of academic programs ....
I would not blame everything on Proposition 13, by the
way; I think that it becomes a handy excuse for a lot of
other things, because all over the country, if you asked
parents to take a vote, you wouldn't have very many
academic courses left in the schools at all ....
We aren't saying you shouldn't have Band and other
things; we're just saying that it shouldn't be a question of
(one or the other) and that the schools are not offering a
lot of the solids that they ought to be.
How do you handle some of the pressures you're
under to admit "special" candidates — athletes, sons
and daughters of alumni, and so on?

We keep the pressure pretty much at bay, because they
allow us to be relatively independent. No one has ever
told us you have to admit someone. We get a lot of strong
expressions of interest on behalf of good athletes and
alumni children and from people who might give (the
University) a lot of money. Surprisingly enough, we get
to call them as we see them.
We take into consideration athletic ability, (but) we
want to know that they're worth being taken into consid
eration. We do that for music, too, and for art; you can
have abilities that can be relatively graded and ranked.
But we disappoint people as often as we please them by
our decisions. (Being) the child of alumni is a factor, but
it's only a matter of everything being equal and we have
to make a choice.
Why do you think students come to Stanford instead
of other prestige schools?
1 think most students apply *o a school like Stanford
because of its name. The name applies to a lot of things,
and how it gets that name varies over a period of time . . .
it can be professors who are well known; it can be the
reputation of its component parts.
But I would sense that for more than other kinds of
schools, (the decision to come here) is based on academic
perceptions — that is, that the University offers a person
an academic program; that if one graduates from here that
the degree will mean something.
They also come because they know people are here and
say it'sa good experience — that they've enjoyed it. They
come because the student body is varied, in the sense that
we're not a state school, so that the majority of our stu
dents are not from just the state. If a lot of different kinds
of people apply, get admitted and enroll, it becomes a
varied student body and people are attracted to that.
At the end of the freshman year here we ask the
freshmen, "What was the most important thing to you in
the freshman year?" Not surprisingly, top of the list is,
"All the other students." That doesn't mean they're ig
noring the academic or the faculty or anything like that; it
simply means that that is part of the education.
Also it's residential, so people are deciding to apply to
a university where they'd like to live on campus.

When you go out to prospective applicants, how do
you protray Stanford's strengths and weaknesses?
I'm one who doesn't believe that you have to make the
thing seem like more than it is. It's a great opportunity
with a lot of resources. What we say in our bulletin and
when we go to schools is that much of what we experi
ence here depends on how the student uses those re
sources. All you can do is bring them together ....
I talk in terms of probabilities: the probabilities are
higher that we'll get a first-rate faculty member at a school
like this; the probabilities are higher th.it the variety of
courses that are really good will exist here; the prob
abilities are higher that it will be more interesting for
students. But in any given case, we don't guarantee
(these) to anybody.
I hat's why, unlike other schools, we don't bend
people's arms after we admit them to enroll here; we
think that that's their decision at that point and we
couldn't say that you could only do well if you went to
Stanford ....
People grow and they grow at different paces and in
different parts ot their lives, so that they may grow so
cially at one pace and academically at another pace. We
don't predict what everyone's going to do their freshman
or sophomore year or whatever, and so I can't guarantee
that the best student in the world won't come here and
just (find it to) be the wrong place.
How do you think Stanford has changed in all these
years?
I don't know. It's harder foradmissions people to sense
changes than people sitting outside, partly because we
know too much.
Sure the student body now has changed from the stu
dent body (of) five years ago, 20 years ago. The change is
in the students, the secondary schools, their preparation,
the kinds of things that interest them. People do think
more about jobs now; if I were them I'd be thinking more
about jobs now too. Given an economy which is not in the
greatest shape, it's not surprising that the people we see
don't see the world as their parents saw it and as their
younger brothers and sisters probably will see it.
But admissions officers tend to see the individuals, and

I find it very hard to generalize about a class. I'm like the
rest: I have mv own areas where 1 don't have anv exper
tise but I have a lot of opinions. I will generalize about
football teams. But I happen to sit here and have a fair
amount of expertise which leads me not to have very
many general opinions.
How much longer are you going to be Dean of Admis
sions?
I don't think about more than one year at a time . . . . 1
tend to like what I do now. I don't discount doinu some
thing else, but I (am one who feels that I) never get this
job done well enough. So I'm not in the position where I
think I've mastered it at all, and that probably keeps meat
it more than anything else.

it's true that for most minority students, their background
would really be different from (that of) many of the other

eration. We do that for music, too, and for art; you can
have abilities that can be relatively graded and ranked.
But we disappoint people as often as we please them by
our decisions. (Being) the child of alumni is a factor, but
it's only a matter of everything being equal and we have
to make a choice.
Why do you think students come to Stanford instead
of other prestige schools?
1 think most students apply *o a school like Stanford
because of its name. The name applies to a lot of things,
and how it gets that name varies over a period of time . . .
it can be professors who are well known; it can be the
reputation of its component parts.
But I would sense that for more than other kinds of
schools, (the decision to come here) is based on academic
perceptions — that is, that the University offers a person
an academic program; that if one graduates from here that
the degree will mean something.
They also come because they know people are here and
say it'sa good experience — that they've enjoyed it. They
come because the student body is varied, in the sense that
we're not a state school, so that the majority of our stu
dents are not from just the state. If a lot of different kinds
of people apply, get admitted and enroll, it becomes a
varied student body and people are attracted to that.
At the end of the freshman year here we ask the
freshmen, "What was the most important thing to you in
the freshman year?" Not surprisingly, top of the list is,
"All the other students." That doesn't mean they're ig
noring the academic or the faculty or anything like that; it
simply means that that is part of the education.
Also it's residential, so people are deciding to apply to
a university where they'd like to live on campus.

When you go out to prospective applicants, how do
you protray Stanford's strengths and weaknesses?
I'm one who doesn't believe that you have to make the
thing seem like more than it is. It's a great opportunity
with a lot of resources. What we say in our bulletin and
when we go to schools is that much of what we experi
ence here depends on how the student uses those re
sources. All you can do is bring them together ....
I talk in terms of probabilities: the probabilities are
higher that we'll get a first-rate faculty member at a school
like this; the probabilities are higher th.it the variety of
courses that are really good will exist here; the prob
abilities are higher that it will be more interesting for
students. But in any given case, we don't guarantee
(these) to anybody.
I hat's why, unlike other schools, we don't bend
people's arms after we admit them to enroll here; we
think that that's their decision at that point and we
couldn't say that you could only do well if you went to
Stanford ....
People grow and they grow at different paces and in
different parts ot their lives, so that they may grow so
cially at one pace and academically at another pace. We
don't predict what everyone's going to do their freshman
or sophomore year or whatever, and so I can't guarantee
that the best student in the world won't come here and
just (find it to) be the wrong place.
How do you think Stanford has changed in all these
years?
I don't know. It's harder foradmissions people to sense
changes than people sitting outside, partly because we
know too much.
Sure the student body now has changed from the stu
dent body (of) five years ago, 20 years ago. The change is
in the students, the secondary schools, their preparation,
the kinds of things that interest them. People do think
more about jobs now; if I were them I'd be thinking more
about jobs now too. Given an economy which is not in the
greatest shape, it's not surprising that the people we see
don't see the world as their parents saw it and as their
younger brothers and sisters probably will see it.
But admissions officers tend to see the individuals, and

I find it very hard to generalize about a class. I'm like the
rest: I have mv own areas where 1 don't have anv exper
tise but I have a lot of opinions. I will generalize about
football teams. But I happen to sit here and have a fair
amount of expertise which leads me not to have very
many general opinions.
How much longer are you going to be Dean of Admis
sions?
I don't think about more than one year at a time . . . . 1
tend to like what I do now. I don't discount doinu some
thing else, but I (am one who feels that I) never get this
job done well enough. So I'm not in the position where I
think I've mastered it at all, and that probably keeps meat
it more than anything else.

it's true that for most minority students, their background
would really be different from (that of) many of the other
candidates we see. But there are many non-minority stu
dents who have backgrounds similar in nature, at least
socio-economically, and we have also always made sure
that that was a factor that we looked at as well for non
minority students.
We have never been in and hope never to be in a situa
tion where a class is structured so that in any characteris
tic you can name there's only one kind of student who fits
that characteristic, whether it be socio-economic or any
thing else.
Was the quality of applicants this year as high as it has
been in the past?
Yes, but I made a point (in a memo sent last year to high
schools criticizing the lack of college preparation given to
many high school students) that we were not making too
many claims thitf the quality of applicants had fallen here
But we have had requests for 15,000 copies of that letter
from schools, teachers and school boards all over. What
you sense is that (there are many people) who are con
cerned that one shouldn't have to drop a language to take
driver's ed. To the extent that we were able to support
the people in those L"hools who want (stronger prog
rams), that memo has served a good purpose.
It's also been used by students who don't have a strong
counseling program; we can send that memo because it
illustrates some kinds of academic programs ....
I would not blame everything on Proposition 13, by the
way; I think that it becomes a handy excuse for a lot of
other things, because all over the country, if you asked
parents to take a vote, you wouldn't have very many
academic courses left in the schools at all ....
We aren't saying you shouldn't have Band and other
things; we're just saying that it shouldn't be a question of
(one or the other) and that the schools are not offering a
lot of the solids that they ought to be.
How do you handle some of the pressures you're
under to admit "special" candidates — athletes, sons
and daughters of alumni, and so on?

We keep the pressure pretty much at bay, because they
allow us to be relatively independent. No one has ever
told us you have to admit someone. We get a lot of strong
expressions of interest on behalf of good athletes and
alumni children and from people who might give (the
University) a lot of money. Surprisingly enough, we get
to call them as we see them.
We take into consideration athletic ability, (but) we
want to know that they're worth being taken into consid

I hat's why, unlike other schools, we don't bend
people's arms after we admit them to enroll here; we
think that that's their decision at that point and we
couldn't say that you could only do well if you went to
Stanford ....
People grow and they grow at different paces and in
different parts ot their lives, so that they may grow so
cially at one pace and academically at another pace. We
don't predict what everyone's going to do their freshman
or sophomore year or whatever, and so I can't guarantee
that the best student in the world won't come here and
just (find it to) be the wrong place.
How do you think Stanford has changed in all these
years?
I don't know. It's harder foradmissions people to sense
changes than people sitting outside, partly because we
know too much.
Sure the student body now has changed from the stu
dent body (of) five years ago, 20 years ago. The change is
in the students, the secondary schools, their preparation,
the kinds of things that interest them. People do think
more about jobs now; if I were them I'd be thinking more
about jobs now too. Given an economy which is not in the
greatest shape, it's not surprising that the people we see
don't see the world as their parents saw it and as their
younger brothers and sisters probably will see it.
But admissions officers tend to see the individuals, and

I find it very hard to generalize about a class. I'm like the
rest: I have mv own areas where 1 don't have anv exper
tise but I have a lot of opinions. I will generalize about
football teams. But I happen to sit here and have a fair
amount of expertise which leads me not to have very
many general opinions.
How much longer are you going to be Dean of Admis
sions?
I don't think about more than one year at a time . . . . 1
tend to like what I do now. I don't discount doinu some
thing else, but I (am one who feels that I) never get this
job done well enough. So I'm not in the position where I
think I've mastered it at all, and that probably keeps meat
it more than anything else.
