# Richard Lyman
## A 						president who loves challenges – & has more than his share of them 
### Karen Veninga 
As he rides his bicycle to and
from work in Building 10 in the
Inner Quadrangle, there is no
mistaking the ruddy face, the
bow tie and the horn-rimmed
glasses. President Richard Ly
man's poised and wizened ex
pression are instantly recog
nized by students who, on their
way to class, share their com
mute with him.
But if almost all students
know what Lyman looks like,
far fewer know what he is like,
know that he shares their incli
nation to challenge their intel
lectual capacities and energy
potential's by embroiling him
self in a multitude of organi
zations, commitments and
causes.
Indeed, the word "chal
lenge" seems to follow Richard
Lyman around.
Robert Rosenzweig, the Uni
versity's vice president for pub
lic affairs, believes that Lyman
"has an unusual ability to chal
lenge people and to accept their
challenges."
Bill Stone, director of the
Alumni Association and Ly
man's assistant for five and a
half years, says that the presi
dent is "very challenging to
work for;" when Stone went to
the Association, "trading one
boss for 50,000 was about an
even trade."
According to Stone, Lyman
"got at you if you did not do
your homework; the quantity of
material he has control of is
staggering."
As much as Lvman chal
lenges others, he challenges
himself, assuming respon
sibilities that include much
more than the concerns he ad
dresses as president.
Trustee of the Rockefeller
Foundation. Trustee of the
Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching.
Member of the National Coun
cil on the Humanities and
chairman of its Committee on
Public and State Programs. Di
rector of IBM. And more.
Lyman himself wonders
sometimes whether the overall
time commitment to these ac
tivities might not be too
great. Taken altogether, how
ever, he believes that the out
side commitments improve the
University's standing and
reputation and assist him in
his performance as president.
"There is a good deal to be

said for the notion that if you
stick too narrowly to your ad
ministrative job within one in
stitution that your view is going
to be too narrow," Lyman said
in an interview with the Daily
last month.
In his work as committee
chairman for the National
Council on the Humanities, for
example, he deals with those
aspects of the council's work
that are, he said, furthest re
moved from a university such
as Stanford — media programs
and special museum exhibits.
"The only relevance" found
in the work, he said, is found in
"its irrelevance. It's another
way of looking at the problem

of bringing the humanities to
bear on a whole population,"
rather than just those who
might attend a university.
Lyman believes, therefore,
that administrators should take
advantage of opportunities "to
have their minds stretched bv
•coming into contact with prob
lems and people outside the
University."
Even as director of IBM — a
corporation which is certainly

not as close to the University in
spirit as some of the public ser
vice organizations that he
works for — Lyman finds
that working on "the
problems of organizational
management in a multi
national corporation are not as
totally irrelevant" to a univer
sity as they might seem.
"Large organizations have a
lot in common, no matter what
the purposes of the organiza
tion might be," he said.
As a result of his work for
IBM, Lyman might perhaps be
able to "stretch" his approach
to two challenges that face large
private institutions: inflation
and government regulation.

Discussing the Carter Ad
ministration's proposal to form
a new Department of Educa
tion, which he opposes, Lyman
said, "The strength of our edu
cational system at all levels has
been in its local roots and con
trol." A federal government, he
said, might "in the long run"
pre-empt that control.
"Bureaucracies take on a life
of their own," Lyman said,
"and the safeguards that are

put in against them this week
aren't very helpful three years
from next Tuesday under a dif
ferent administration and a
bureaucracy that's learning to
feel its oats."
Lyman is one of seven au
thors of Bureaucrats and Brain-
f >ower: Government Regulation of
Universities, a book which main
tains that the government is en
croaching on university affairs.
He concedes that he has be
come, as he said, "what the
world calls a 'tired liberal,'" one
who is more skeptical than he
used to be of the government's
capacity to do good.
"I am more sympathetic now
than I would have been 15 years
ago" to the belief that "market
solutions have a lot going for
them, provided they are com
patible with social justice,"
Lyman said.
He is more sympathetic to
this view, though market solu
tions, when faced with the chal
lenge of inflation, might neces
sitate difficult cutbacks at the
University. Predicting fewer
new faculty appointments in
the years ahead, Lyman said,
"The only way we're going to
do new things is to diminish or
cut out some old things."
Although "almost every
body" favors spending on the
academic, he continued,
"something often comes along
where you realize that if you
don't spend the money ad
ministratively everybody suf
fers.
"It's like people complaining
•about the state of the roads
around here," Lvman said. "I
always say, 'Wouldn't you
rather have the money go into
faculty salaries?' Well, the ans
wer is 'yes' until I break an axle
in a pothole." The allocation of
University resources involves,
therefore, "a constant series of
debates over things that are
very hard to compare."
However the University does
spend its money, it has not seen
the last of its tuition hikes, be
cause Stanford, Lyman said,
would rather raise tuition than
permit itself to become a
mediocre institution.
"If people are going to pay
the money to go to an indepen
dent institution," he said,
"they're not going to be content
to go to a so-so independent in
stitution. They want to go to the
best that they can.
"I think that we will be one of
the beneficiaries of that because
this place has a very strong
reputation, for all its faults."
Public schools — and their
dramatically lower tuitions —
thus do not pose an immediate
threat to Stanford, though the
day has passed, Lyman said,
when private schools can pro
fess a monopoly on quality
education.
Independent institutions, he
said, can attract students with a
number of features that set
them apart from public schools,
such as a smaller size and a
smaller student-faculty ratio.
In the long run, however, the
increasing gap in tuition bet
ween the two sectors mav be
come, as Lyman said, "a recipe
for strangulation of the inde
pendents."
When Lyman became presi
dent in September 1970, the
University's virtues probably
seemed irrelevant to many on
campus, because Stanford was
then being rocked by tumultu
ous protest. Lyman
followed into office Kenneth
Pitzer, who resigned after a 19
month term engulfed by some
of the largest demonstrations in
the University's history —
including an anti-war protest
in April 1970 that brought clas
ses to a standstill for two weeks.
When Lyman entered office
nine years ago, he said that he
would do everything possible
to prevent a recurrence of the
violent student-police confron
tations that rocked the campus
during the anti-war protest of
that spring.
At the same time, however,
he assured students that he was
"not trying to keep people from
making us, by legitimate
means, confront problems
which some of us may not be

terribly eager to confront.
"We have to preserve order,"
he declared, "because it we do
not, someone else who does not
understand the delicate fabric
of the university will come in
and do it."
Lyman did not enter office
with the full support of the
University community; it took
groups opposed to his ap
pointment only 32 hours from
the time of its announcement to
stage a protest, chanting "Give
him the axe!"
The Daily warned in its "wel
coming" editorial that Lyman
was "brutally rough in conver
sation" and that his "forceful
opinions take on the aspect of
aloofness and insensitivity."
However, the Daily con
tinued, Lyman was "unques
tumftMv the best man for the
job. He is sympathetic for the
most part to student grie
vances. He listens and observes
well."
Protests would reoccur on
campus for the next two years,
and Lyman, balancing the
needs of free speech and non
violence, would steer the Uni
versity through them. As for his
"insensitivity," Lyman said re
cently that his forthright ap
proach was an asset during the
unrest:
"One of the sources of the
campus revolution was cer
tainly a feeling that
straightforwardness and hon
est statements from authorities
were not common. Even if the
people listening to you heard
things they didn't want to hear,
they reacted better, respected
you more, if they thought they
were getting what you really be
lieved than if they thought they
were getting rhetoric and
baloney."
Lyman became president
after having served as vice pres
ident and provost between 1967
and 1970. He had arrived on
campus in 1958, after having
taught at Washington Univer
sity in St. Louis. A 1917 Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of Swar
thmore, Lyman earned an A. M.
in 1948 and a Ph. D. in 1954 in
history from Harvard.
He was appointed by Stan
ford's History Department as
an associate professor, and, in
1964, he became a full professor
and associate dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences. Lyman will be 56 on Oc
tober 18.
The issues that have chal
lenged him in the last five years
are surely not as bitter as those
that faced him at the beginning
of the decade, but they have in
volved matters that influence
the University's academic
character.
In addition to the continuing
debate over economics and the
University's role as a private in
stition, Lvman has contributed
to the recent discussions about
undergraduate education — in
particular, the reinstatement of
the Western Civilization re
quirement (withdrawn during
the campus upheavals.)
"To get away from the toxic
effects of a requirement,"
Lyman said, he has supported
the call for a western culture re
quirement that might be fulfil
led in six or seven different
ways. At the same time, he has
continued to back the "alterna
tive courses offered by the Stan
ford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI), the

Stanford Center for Innovative
Research and Education
(SCIRE) and the Action Re
search Liaison Office
(ARLO) — all brainchjlds of
the late '60s and early '70s.
These classes, Lyman said,
comprise "a significant part" of
the University's undergraduate
curriculum. "We set limits on
the amount of SCIRE,
SWOPSI, etc., that a student
can take," Lyman said, "and
then say, 'OK, take it and some
of it will probably turn out to be
some of the most exciting
things you've done and some of
it may turn out to be junk.'
"We don't pretend that we
maintain the same quality con
trol on that that we try to main
tain in other areas," Lyman
continued. These classes make
possible .i "flexibility, # on the
margins that is very useful,
very important."
Outside of the classroom,
Lyman hopes that during his
tenure he has helped to open
up the University to "groups
that virtually didn't exist here
until the mid-'6os —
disadvantaged minorities."
(In 1970, minorities com
prised six percent of the Uni
versity's undergraduate en
rollment, and about five per
cent of its graduate enrollment.
In 1978, those figures had risen
to 11 percentand nine percent.)
It is in the nature of a Univer
sity to entertain, if not to foster,
controversy, and Lyman —
whether deciding in 1972 to
dismiss Professor of English 11.
Bruce Eranklin for inciting the
use of violence or refusing in
1977 the request of students
that he recommend to the
Board of Trustees divestment in

South Africa — has had his
share of controversy.
Lyman, for his part, wishes
that controversies more often
involved "real controversies in
which there are two sides argu
ing with each other and less
often a blast from one side to a
sympathetic audience — the
two audiences being almost to
tally different.
"There is never enough
openness to new ideas," he
said. "It's not our nature to be
open to new ideas."
But it such be the nature of
controversies, administrative
decisions must still be made;
such is the challenge of the
president's office.
Drawing a comparison bet
ween administrators and jour
nalists, Lyman said, "Each has
to reach decisions before all the
evidence is in. If you (as a jour
nalist) have not learned enough
about your story to write a good
story, you'll write a mediocre
story, but a story you will write.
"If an administrator must
make a decision and has not got
all the evidence that he ought to
have, nevertheless, a decision
will probably get made."
If, as some might claim, the
decision too often leaves some
thing to be desired, the defi
ciency is perhaps inescapable at
an academic institution.
"Universities are not tightly
managed," Lyman said. "They
are not very hierarchical. The
president has more power to
say 'no' than to say 'yes'; he has
more power to stop things from
happening than to make them
happen by far.
"That's one of the reasons
why he's often in an unpopular
position."


'The only way we're going to do new things is to
cut out some old things.'


'If people are going to pay to go to an independent institution, they're not
going to be content going to a so-so institution. We will be the beneficiaries
of that.'
