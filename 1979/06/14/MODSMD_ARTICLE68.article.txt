W.B. (Bliss) Carnochan has

since September 1975. A scho
lar of 18th century English liter
ature, Carnochan came to the
University in 1960 after receiv
ing from Harvard his A.8.,
A.M. and Ph.D. He was chair
man of the English Department
from 1971-73, during which
time Associate Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin was dismissed. While
personally disagreeing with the
decision to fire Franklin, Car
nochan won recognition for his
ability to maintain cohesion
within the department during
the Advisory Board hearings on
the Franklin case.


Joel Smith is in charge of one
of the University's most impor
tant offices—that which raises
money. An Oxford graduate
and former president of Deni
son University, Smith was ap
pointed in 1977, after having
served as assistant to the vice
president for development. In
that position, Smith helped the
University move into the sec
ond spot, behind Harvard, in
total gift support among private
universities.


John J. Schwartz, legal ad
visor to the president, is re
sponsible for the hiring, train
ing and supervising of all uni
versity attorneys and their sup
porting staff. Schwartz came to
Stanford in 1968 as an assistant
professor of physics. After serv
ing as counsel for medical af
fairs, he was promoted to assis
tant vice president in 1976 and
to associate vice-president at
the medical school in 1977.


The former administrator of
the Food and Drug Administra
tion (FDA), Donald Kennedy,
became vice president and pro
vost on August 1. A biology
professor and essentially the
founder of the Human Biology
program here, Kennedy said
upon resigning the FDA post in
April that the University was
"an amazing place, a remarka
ble institution" to which he was
"delighted" to return. As pro-

vost, Kennedy is responsible to
the president for administra
tion of the entire academic
program, including the seven
schools and all of the libraries,
except the Hoover Institution.
Kennedy is a highly regarded
academic administrator, having
been mentioned as candidate
for the presidencies of Yale and
the University of Chicago when
those positions were open a
few years ago.


The vice provost and dean of
undergraduate studies is the
originator of Stanford's most
popular course, Human Sexual
ity. Herant Katchadourian, a
psychiatrist, said when ap
pointed in 1976 that the dean
"should provide an institu
tional ear for all those con
cerned with undergraduate

education." In class, he blends
the matter-of-fact with dead
pan humor; once, after show
ing a series of bar graphs which
break down the rates and forms
of sexual release among various
populations,he remarked, "You
may be thinking: 'Enough of
this bull, bring out the guitars
and let us sing of love.' "


Robert Rosenzweig has been
vice president for public affairs
since the office was created in
1974. Rosenzweig is responsi
ble for the University's federal,
state and community govern
ment relations, its news and
publications services and its
public events program. He in
sists, however, that he is not a
public relations man; the Uni
versity, he asserts, has "a duty
to inform the public even if it
involves saying things about
people they just as soon keep
quiet."


William F. Massy, a profes
sor in the Graduate School of
Business since 1962, is the Uni
versity's vice president for bus
iness and finance. He super
vises the University's "support
functions"—police services,
service operations, the Univer
sity press and the 8000 acres of
Stanford land. He has served as
a financial consultant to United
Airlines and Coca-Cola, among
many other companies.


Jim Lyons has been dean of
student affairs since 1972, when
he left a similar position at
Haverford College in Pennsyl
vania. Lyons coordinates the
entire structure of services pro
vided for the students by the
University, including the hous
ing system and Tresidder
Memorial Union. In addition,
he is an ex officio member of the
Honor Code Commission and
acts as an advocate of certain
student needs with councils of
the University.
