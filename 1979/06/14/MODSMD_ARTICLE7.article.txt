# Returning alumni may recognize campus
## New construction to decline in next decade 
### Sara Lessley 
Hammers pounding.
Workmen calling.
Machines whirring and grind
ing. Jackhammers drilling.
Dust and dirt and detours.
These are all familiar sights
and sounds here on campus
where construction and reno
vation work seem to go on end
lessly. Members of the 1979
graduating class have seen a
number of changes in (he phys
ical appearance of the Univer
sity since they were freshmen.
And during the next decade or
so, when these alumni return to
campus, they will continue to
find new and upgraded struc
tures.
But tor returning campus vis
itors in the next decade there
won't be as many dramatic dif
ferences as there have been in
the past, according to Director
of Planning Phil Williams. Wil
liams said he hopes the campus
"will look a lot nicer in smaller
ways" — which includes im
proving landscaping and in
terior refurbishing especially in
the areas where majorconstruc
tion has been taking place.
Stanford's so-called "Second
Great Stone Age" building
boom is coming to a conclusion
after the major construction
drives launched during the '60s
and 70s wind to a close, Wil
liams said.
After World War 11, there was

"a significant expansion in stu
dents and faculty that was not
met in the physical plant," As
sistant Provost Susan Schofield
said, and so recent intensive
construction has been an effort
to "catch up."
But the University has com
pleted a large part of that drive
to increase the available build
ing space to match the growth
Stanford experienced as it be
came a major research institute
after the war, Williams said.
In addition, the University is

now in a "state of equilibrium"
— essentially at a stable popula
tion since there is no dramatic
increase in student enrollment
or faculty planned, he said.
Some of the smaller "con
solidation, tidying up and
landscaping" improvements
Williams foresees will include
the conversion of Galvez Street
from Hoover Tower to Meyer
Library into a landscaped
pedestrian mall, and the recon
struction of Serra Street in front

of the Quad. Both projects are
funded, and the Galvez mall is
expected to be completed this
summer.
Other major changes that
may change the look of the
University in years to come, ac
cording to Schofield, would in
clude construction of a new
music facility, probably to be lo
cated behind Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. She added that the
long-range goal is a completely
integrated music facility in one
location. This might eventually

free the department's present
building — the Knoll above
Florence Moore — for other
academic uses or perhaps stu
dent housing.
Another academic research
building may be constructed for
the Medical School in the next
decade to take care of expand
ing research needs, Schofield
said.
Also, the University may
add a new building to the


Work continues on the $8 million reconstruction of History
Corner, but after completion, fewer major building projects are
expected to start in the next 10 years. According to Phil Williams,
director of planning, the "Second Great Stone Age," Stanford's

building boom of the last decade, is coming to a close. That means
students graduating now will likely be able to recognize the
campus when they return.
present engineering facilities
which would probably house
integrated systems work — a
new field combining electrical
engineering and computer sci
ence. Work in that area is now
being done in various campus
locations, Schofield said.
One of the projects with the
biggest impact on under
graduates would be the con
struction of the proposed 800-
student dormitory complex on
the west side of Lagunita Court,
Schofield said.

The housing project is pre
sently in the planning stages.
Since January, a committee of
some 22 students, faculty and
administration personnel have
been meeting as the Advisory
Committee on New Resi
dences.
The residence complex, ex
pected to cost some $25 million,
will may open as early as Sep
tember 1982.
Other housing projects may
include additional faculty hous

ing near Peter Coutts and Page
Mill roads, and housing with
preference for faculty and staff
located in the area between Oak
Creek Apartments and the
Children's Hospital.
The complete renovation of
the buildings on the front of the
Quad will be completed within
the next few years, Schofield
said.
Work on those buildings
began nearly 20 years ago in
what has been called an effort to

"preserve the inner city." Since
all the structures are more than
80 years old, some renovation
or reconstruction was needed
to bring the facilities up to cur
rent building standards and
adapt the interior space to
modern needs. The last of the
work, on Building 120, should
be completed in 1961.
Also within the next 10 years,
Schofield said she hopes to see
the completion of Campus

Drive West, which would con
nect the Campus Drive loop,
making the road a complete cir
cle.
The major construction pro
jects are largely dependent on
donations, Williams said. In the
past, federal government
money has helped tund some ot
the major reconstruction, in
cluding some of the Quad
buildings, hut higher education
is no longer such a high priority
for the government, he said
