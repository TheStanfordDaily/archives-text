# Returning alumni may recognize campus
## New construction to decline in next decade 
### Sara Lessley 
Hammers pounding.
Workmen calling.
Machines whirring and grind
ing. Jackhammers drilling.
Dust and dirt and detours.
These are all familiar sights
and sounds here on campus
where construction and reno
vation work seem to go on end
lessly. Members of the 1979
graduating class have seen a
number of changes in (he phys
ical appearance of the Univer
sity since they were freshmen.
And during the next decade or
so, when these alumni return to
campus, they will continue to
find new and upgraded struc
tures.
But tor returning campus vis
itors in the next decade there
won't be as many dramatic dif
ferences as there have been in
the past, according to Director
of Planning Phil Williams. Wil
liams said he hopes the campus
"will look a lot nicer in smaller
ways" — which includes im
proving landscaping and in
terior refurbishing especially in
the areas where majorconstruc
tion has been taking place.
Stanford's so-called "Second
Great Stone Age" building
boom is coming to a conclusion
after the major construction
drives launched during the '60s
and 70s wind to a close, Wil
liams said.
After World War 11, there was

"a significant expansion in stu
dents and faculty that was not
met in the physical plant," As
sistant Provost Susan Schofield
said, and so recent intensive
construction has been an effort
to "catch up."
But the University has com
pleted a large part of that drive
to increase the available build
ing space to match the growth
Stanford experienced as it be
came a major research institute
after the war, Williams said.
In addition, the University is

now in a "state of equilibrium"
— essentially at a stable popula
tion since there is no dramatic
increase in student enrollment
or faculty planned, he said.
Some of the smaller "con
solidation, tidying up and
landscaping" improvements
Williams foresees will include
the conversion of Galvez Street
from Hoover Tower to Meyer
Library into a landscaped
pedestrian mall, and the recon
struction of Serra Street in front

of the Quad. Both projects are
funded, and the Galvez mall is
expected to be completed this
summer.
Other major changes that
may change the look of the
University in years to come, ac
cording to Schofield, would in
clude construction of a new
music facility, probably to be lo
cated behind Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. She added that the
long-range goal is a completely
integrated music facility in one
location. This might eventually

free the department's present
building — the Knoll above
Florence Moore — for other
academic uses or perhaps stu
dent housing.
Another academic research
building may be constructed for
the Medical School in the next
decade to take care of expand
ing research needs, Schofield
said.
Also, the University may
add a new building to the


Work continues on the $8 million reconstruction of History
Corner, but after completion, fewer major building projects are
expected to start in the next 10 years. According to Phil Williams,
director of planning, the "Second Great Stone Age," Stanford's

building boom of the last decade, is coming to a close. That means
students graduating now will likely be able to recognize the
campus when they return.
