# The 						world gathers at the I-Center
## 
### 
For the more than 1600
foreign students here, the
Bechtel International Center is
the point of welcome and a
locale of home hospitality.
But just as importantly, the
1-Center is a campus meeting
place for all members of the
University community in
terested in foreign culture and
events.

Every Tuesday, for example,
the center hosts a luncheon
speaker who discusses current
topics in world affairs. On
Wednesdays and Thursdays,
small groups of American and
foreign students gather at the
center for lunch and to ex
change views on topics such as
The Importance of Technology
in Society and Socialism and

Communism in Europe. These
discussions have been a tradi
tion at the center for more than
20 years.
A Thursday evening film
series features cross-cultural
themes, and Evenings Abroad,
presented on weekends, high
lights the cultural aspects of
particular regions around the
world.
On other nights of the week,
the center offers duplicate
bridge, folk dancing and cafes,
and Sunday Supper, featuring
international cuisine prepared
by the representatives of
nationalities on campus.
English-in-Action gives
Americans the opportunity to
help individual students,
post-doctoral scholars and
spouses perfect their conversa
tional English, and a language
exchange program enables
American students learning a
foreign language to practice
with native speakers.
Americans interested in
study, travel or short-term
employment abroad should
visit the Overseas Resource
Center, which has extensive lit
erature and information on all
aspects of foreign travel. The
ASSU provides the center a
travel advisor who helps with
charter flights and overseas car
purchases. The center also
serves as the campus headquar
ters for overseas fellowships,
including the Fullbright,
Rhodes and Marshall.
The 1-Center facilities include
a reading room that houses do
zens of foreign periodicals, a
kitchen, meeting room, dar
kroom, ping pong, volleyball,

pool table, barbequeand patio.
The center gives priority for use
of the facilities to those ac
tivities which are international
in nature and which encourage
interaction between Americans
and their colleagues from ab
road.
The center publishes a bi
weekly newsletter, available on
request, that describles all of
the upcoming activities, and it
also lists its events in the Daily's
Once Around the Quad.
Open every day of the year,
the center is located on
Lagunita Drive and Mayfield
Ave., in between Tresidder
Union and the Florence Moore
dormitory.

Speaking last year at one of the International Center's Tuesday
luncheons, Richard McCormack, former U.S. deputy political
advisor to the United Nations, said that the Soviet Union's milit
ary power is roughly equivalent to that of the United States.
