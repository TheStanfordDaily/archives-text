# CPPC has Job & career information

If and when students think
about what they are going to do
after they leave Stanford, they
might think about visiting the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC), located in
White Plaza next to the
bookstore.
As its name indicates, the
CPPC helps students make de
cisions about their careers and
find them jobs after graduation,
tion.
The center has done quite
well in meeting these goals; in
all but one of the last 12 years,
for example, the CPPC has in
creased its job placement rate,
while placement centers at
other schools have had increas
ing difficulty finding jobs for
their graduates.

Ralph Keller, director of the
CPPC, said that he does "not
know of any center (at any
other college) that has a career
planning program as extensive
as this one. We help individu
als get their act together so they
have as good a chance as possi
ble" to get the jobs they want,
he said.
Although the CPPC helps
guide students toward possible
careers, it does not, Keller said,
"tell a student what to do, or
decide for them what their
needs are."
Each year, the center or
ganizes about 100 seminars and
workshops that deal with
career options and oppor
tunities. These meetings also
consider the pros and cons of

job hunting, methods of re
sume writing and means to im
prove self-assessment.
In addition, the center offers
individual counseling by per
manent staff members and
trained peer counselors, and it
maintains a library stocked with
literature on career oppor
tunities.
Any student, student spouse
or alumnus may register with
the CPPC and receive a weekly
list of jobs available in different
areas of specialization, such as
liberal arts and teaching.
Those who register may also
establish and maintain at the
CPPC a career file that contains
resumes and letter of recom
mendation. On request, the
center will send copies of the

file to prospective employers
and graduate schools.
"We send over 25,000 files
each year," Keller said. "We
have taken a lot of pride in our
placement files so that when
they go out from here, they look
better than anvbodv else's."
The CPPC also helps arrange
campus interviews and com
pany recruiting efforts, making
it possible for students to meet
with representatives of more
than 500 companies each year.
Finally, the center operates
the Student Employment Of
fice, which handles part-time
and temporary employment in
the area.
