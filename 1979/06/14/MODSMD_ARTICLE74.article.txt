# Alumni Assoc. serves students, too
## 
### 
Many students believe that
alumni associations do no more
than throw tailgaters before
football games and send out
newsletters begging for money
to support the dear old alma
mater.
With the Stanford Alumni
Association, however, that is
definitely not the case.
The association takes an ac
tive and productive role in the
life of the University, providing
services that facilitate student
access to alumni across the na
tion.
Alumni Contact Service
Perhaps the most valuable
service offered to students is
the Alumni Contact Service,
through which students seek
ing information on various
career opportunities may con
tact alumni working in the dif

ferent professions. The associa
tion has listed in loose-leaf
notebooks at the Bowman
Alumni House the names of
participating alumni in Boston,
New York, Los Angeles,
southwestern Washington and
Oregon and, soon, the Bay
Area.
The contact service is not a
placement service, but alumni
who participate do indicate
whether they might have full
time, part-time or summer jobs
available to students.
Washington employers
The Alumni Association also
supports the Stanford-in-
Government (SIC) program,
which helps students find jobs
and internships at all levels of
government —particularly the
federal.
Each spring, SIG sends lob

byists to Washington, D.C., to
contact potential employers
and to find housing in which
students might reside during
their Washington stay.
Brunches
In the winter and spring the
association sponsors senior
brunches, and, in the fall and
spring, individual alumni clubs
sponsor freshmen and senior
parties for students in their
cities.
• In addition, the association
offers a number of scholar
ships, including the Pierce
Memorial Award, a $750 cash
grant presented to a student or
group of students interested in
a project that, does not meet
normal University funding
criteria.
Last year, the award went to
Counterpoint, a new women's

singing group on campus.
The J.E. Wallace Sterling
Award, presented for the first
time on Class Day in June 1979,
is given to a student nominated
by members of the senior class
and key administrators and fa
culty members for achievment
in academics, athletics and
community service.
With a membership of
47,000, the Alumni Association
has one of the highest percen
tages of graduates as members
of any alumnus
organization — nearly 50 per
cent, versus about 18 percent
for organizations at comparable
schools.
Independent
The association is totally in
dependent of the University
and engages in no fund-raising
for Stanford; that function is
within the purview of the Uni
versity's Office of Develop
ment.
Supported by membership
dues, the association offers
many programs specifically de
signed for alumni —including
summer alumni colleges, reun
ions and travel-study
programs—and it operates a
chalet at Alpine Meadows and a
family lodge at Fallen Leaf Lake
near Lake Tahoe.
Students interested in one or
more of the association's prog
rams are encouraged to drop by
the association's office at the
Alumni House.
