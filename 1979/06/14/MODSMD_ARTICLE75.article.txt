## Group airs gays' concerns

"The GPU is a safe place for
gay people, where they can be
themselves with no pretenses,
saysRhioHiersch, the treasurer
of the Gay People's Union
(GPU).
Located on the second floor
of the Old Firehouse, the GPU
has been active in the gay com
munity here and in Palo Alto for
many years. However, Hiersch
said in an interview with the
Daily last month, though the
GPU has had in the past a large
non-student segment, it now is

composed mostly of students.
Attributing this to the chang
ing attitude of society toward
gays, Hiersch said, "People are
'coming out' younger now;
first-year students are less in
timidated" about saying they
are gay than they were a few
years ago.
The struggle for gay rights is
closely related to the struggle
for women's rights, and,
Hiersch said, "the GPU is look
ing forward to more active in
volvement from the women's
movement."
In addition, he said, he hopes
that the GPU will be more in
volved politically, because sev
eral bills that protect gay rights
are in the state legislature, and
the legislators are not hearing
much from the gay
communityâ€”at least not as
much since the defeat of Prop
osition Six,an anti-gay initiative
on the California ballot last
November.
One of the CPU's upcoming
functions, therefore, will be a
letter writing party, the goal of
which will be to inform politi
cians of gay activities, needs
and concerns.
The CPU's structure pro
vides for many levels of in
volvement. According to
Hiersch, the GPU has a steering
committee that organizes
events and activities, and, for
those with less time or inclina
tion to participate, the group
holds gatherings throughout
the week.

On Tuesdays, the women's
collective holds its meetings; on
Wednesdays, the GPU hosts
get-togethers with refresh
ments and other good spirits;
and on Thursdays, the GPU
features one or more special
events â€”including films, guest
speakers and gay-related enter
tainment.
In addition, Andrew Lisac,
another active member of the
GPU said, the GPU is organiz
ing a newspaper to cover events
in the gay community and to
give community meVnbers a
chance to express themselves
on gay issues.
Lisac hopes to start produc
tion of the monthly paper in the
fall, and, he said, he already has
"seven good staff members and
a poet." One proposed name
for the paper is The Stanford
Gayly.
Hiersch said that the news
paper would try to help other
gay organizations know about
activities here and to help those
outside the gay community bet
ter understand gays.
Lisac said, "A lot of people
are not really sure what 'gay' is
before they come to Stanford.
They come to the Bay Area and
see a few stereotyped gays.
Then they meet someone in the
dorm who is gay and does not
fit and they get all confused."
Hiersch said that the atmos
phere here is generally progres
sive and that "bigotry" is a very
