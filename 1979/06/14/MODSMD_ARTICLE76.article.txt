# Freshman into senior—a metamorphosis
## 
### 
Freshmen year at Stanford.
That first day you wonder
why you were stupid enough to
show up. You feel outclassed
and ridiculous, standing alone
in a mob of everyone else's
friends.
You're the only one without
perfect teeth, five tennis rac
kets, and 800s on the SAT.
Only you miss your first lec
ture because you can't find the
classroom.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) the folks next door
played Led Zeppelin until 4
a.m.; (b) food service spaghetti
gave you indigestion; c) you
didn't study enough (at all), so
you hide in UGLY all day to
avoid embarrassing disaster.

Your room looks like Camp
Pendleton, your roommate like
Albert Einstein and the night
after orientation you start
counting the days until Christ
mas.
Senior year at Stanford.
That first day you check out
the freshmen and wonder who
was crazy enough to let them
in.
You are "at home" because
you recognize half the faces
around you Yuu can rattle off
Mem Chu, HooTow, SLAC and
Dink as you plan the year's
"mick" classes and practical
jokes.
You miss your first class be
cause you're too hung over to
get out of bed.

You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) you realize the course
is a lot harder than it's sup
posed to be; b) your friends hit
the beach that day; c) you know
the teacher's aide and he'll let
you take the test later if you give
him a stab at a good excuse.
Your room looks like hell,
your roommates are licking the
lint off of the carpet and every
morning after you start count
ing the hours until the next
party.
Somewhere between
"freshmen" and "senior" lies
most of a sampling of up
perclassmen's opinions of Stan
ford learning and lifestyle.
They say they found their
first year on the Farm "full of
knocks and highs," and every
year after "great for doing what
you want."
"You come here expecting to
study and work like hell for
grades," said a pre-med senior.
"They tell you the pressure is
terrific, that only rich, smart
kids go there, so watch out.
"The classes are tough but
there are easy ones too. And
some people are dumber than
you.
"That feeling of awe and war
iness lasts two months."
By November of freshman
year, most students questioned
said they had hit the pits of
studying and were ready to
realize that only the hard-core
grad-school-bound really have
to worry about grades.
"You decide you can get
away with living a little," said a
junior Communication maior.
"The important thing is to
stay in perspective. You've got
to see that games are great but
play them only when you can.
If you tlunk out, you aren't
helping anybody."

Balancing work and play is
the hardest job for freshmen,
upperclassmen said.
"You reach a point where
you can become jock, nerd, par
tier or whatever," said a senior
biology major. "You pick a rut
then dig deep.
"The roles help especially
when you've got to handle
emotional problems like
homesickness or pressure to
acheive."
Though less than 20 percent
of the upperclassmen ques
tioned found freshman year
"very unsettling emotionally,"
most said that they got "the
jumps" now and then.
"You can't reconcile being
where you are with anything,"
explained a junior economics
major. "You want familiarity,
safety, home."
But "in that span from Sep
tember to March you change.
You grow a shell that protects
you from emotional problems.
If you don't, you've got trouble.
"You grow so much that if
you don't grow up, you'll go
crazy."

Freshmen year at Stanford.
That first day you wonder
why you were stupid enough to
show up. You feel outclassed
and ridiculous, standing alone
in a mob of everyone else's
friends.
You're the only one without
perfect teeth, five tennis rac
kets, and 800s on the SAT.
Only you miss your first lec
ture because you can't find the
classroom.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) the folks next door
played Led Zeppelin until 4
a.m.; (b) food service spaghetti
gave you indigestion; c) you
didn't study enough (at all), so
you hide in UGLY all day to
avoid embarrassing disaster.

Your room looks like Camp
Pendleton, your roommate like
Albert Einstein and the night
after orientation you start
counting the days until Christ
mas.
Senior year at Stanford.
That first day you check out
the freshmen and wonder who
was crazy enough to let them
in.
You are "at home" because
you recognize half the faces
around you Yuu can rattle off
Mem Chu, HooTow, SLAC and
Dink as you plan the year's
"mick" classes and practical
jokes.
You miss your first class be
cause you're too hung over to
get out of bed.

You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) you realize the course
is a lot harder than it's sup
posed to be; b) your friends hit
the beach that day; c) you know
the teacher's aide and he'll let
you take the test later if you give
him a stab at a good excuse.
Your room looks like hell,
your roommates are licking the
lint off of the carpet and every
morning after you start count
ing the hours until the next
party.
Somewhere between
"freshmen" and "senior" lies
most of a sampling of up
perclassmen's opinions of Stan
ford learning and lifestyle.
They say they found their
first year on the Farm "full of
knocks and highs," and every
year after "great for doing what
you want."
"You come here expecting to
study and work like hell for
grades," said a pre-med senior.
"They tell you the pressure is
terrific, that only rich, smart
kids go there, so watch out.
"The classes are tough but
there are easy ones too. And
some people are dumber than
you.
"That feeling of awe and war
iness lasts two months."
By November of freshman
year, most students questioned
said they had hit the pits of
studying and were ready to
realize that only the hard-core
grad-school-bound really have
to worry about grades.
"You decide you can get
away with living a little," said a
junior Communication maior.
"The important thing is to
stay in perspective. You've got
to see that games are great but
play them only when you can.
If you tlunk out, you aren't
helping anybody."

Balancing work and play is
the hardest job for freshmen,
upperclassmen said.
"You reach a point where
you can become jock, nerd, par
tier or whatever," said a senior
biology major. "You pick a rut
then dig deep.
"The roles help especially
when you've got to handle
emotional problems like
homesickness or pressure to
acheive."
