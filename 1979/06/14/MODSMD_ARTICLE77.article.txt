# ASSU: for the more offbeat of services
## 
### 
The Associated Students of
Stanford University offers a
large number of special services
for members of the campus
community.
The ASSU Lecture Notes
Service appoints students to
take notes from selected
courses—usually the largest
and most popular—and then
duplicates them for distribution
to subscribers.
The ASSU's T-shirt service
enables individuals or groups
to buy and design shirts with
a logo of their choice.
At Memorial Auditorium
every Sunday evening, the
ASSU screens the Sunday
Flicks—major films at a low
price.
On the more prosaic side, the
ASSU runs a linen service off

campus and rents out re
frigerators designed to forestall
dormitory munchy attacks.
The ASSU Course Guide rates
classes and professors accord
ing to their value and teaching
quality. Compiled from student
evaluations filled out in most
classes at the end of each quar
ter, the guide is available in the
dorms.
The ASSU offers a variety of
ancillary services, including a
ride board that competes with
those at UCLA and UC Ber
keley in the number of rides of
fered to distant corners of
North America
Finally, the ASSU offers a
series of non-credit classes,
which in the past have included
mixology (bartending) and auto
mechanics.
