# Anticipate action in fall athletics
## 
### Peter Finch 
Sure, everybody knows that
Stanford has a top-notch foot
ball team. And most everybody
knows that for the last two
years the Cardinals have gained
berths and been victorious in
postseason bowl games.
But what many incoming
students don't realize is that
Stanford also has five other
quality fall sports programs.
The Card water polo team,
for example, is no less than the
number one squad in the coun
try. Last year Stanford racked
up the best regular-season re
cord in the nation en route to
its fourth straight Pacific-10
Conference championship and
a spot in the, NCAA tourna
ment.
There the Cards battled their
way through the ranks before
finally meeting rival California
in the championship finals. It
was no easy match, as both

teams battled through three
overtime periods. Finally, an
exhausted but nonetheless very
happy Stanford team walked
away from the pool with a 7-6
victory and a national title.
It wasn't the first time the
Cards had ever played for the
championship, though. Three
years ago, in 1976, they brought
the water polo crown to The
Farm. And two years ago, in
Dante Dettamanti's initial
coaching campaign, Stanford
placed third at the NCAAs. In
addition, the Cards have amas
sed a staggering 86-10 record
over the past four years.
Of course, this year's squad is
not exactly the same as any of
the others. Missing from the
1978 team are three collegiate
All-Americas in Doug Burke,
Robby Arnold and Tom
Angelo. Returning, however,
are All-Americas Jody
Campbell, Alan Mouchawar

and John Gansel.
Campbell, a sophomore, is
considered to be one of the top
hole men in the country. He is a
member of both the U.S. Junior
and Senior National teams and
may very well represent the
U.S. at the 1980 Olympic
Games.
Dettamanti, last year's Pac-10
Coach of the Year, called
Campbell "probably the most
mobile hole man in the coun
try" and a "triple threat," refer
ring to his skill in gaining posi
tion, scoring out of the hole and
fast breaking.
Mouchawar, also a sopho
more, was selected to the All-
America team in 1978. Interest
ingly enough, he was not even
a starter on last year's squad.
He will start this year, though,
and should contribute im
measurably to the Cards' pros
pects with his powerful outside
shooting.
For the past two years John
Gansel, a member of both the
U.S. Juniorand Senior National
teams, has been considered the
top goalie in the nation. Last
year he held his opponents to
less than half of his own team's
output.
But, as Dettamanti reminds,
"John not only blocks the ball,
but he directs the defense and is
also a catalyst for our fast breaks
with his excellent outlet pas
ses."
Pitching in for the Cards as
well will be the experienced
Randy Kalbus, a quick player
who seems always to be in mo
tion. Also in the swim is Chris
Kelsey, a sophomore who
makes up for his lack of size by
outsmarting his opponents,
and Steve Smith, a big, fast
athlete.
There are 12 incoming
freshmen vying for spots, too.
Heading that group are two
outstanding recruits in James
Bergeson and Greg Lambert.
Bergeson, called the top high
school player in the nation, is
practically assured a spot on the
Card first string. For the past
three years he has been voted to
the High School All-America
team, and twice he was named
the Southern California Player
of the Year.
"He's one of the top high
school players I've ever seen,"
said Dettamanti. "Most coaches
agree that he's the best player
ever at the high school level."
Lambert, the other top re
cruit, comes from nearby Await
High and is the son of former

Stanford and U.S. Olympic
coach Art Lambert. The
younger Lambert also is not
without his share of accolades.
Named a High School All-
America twice and grabbing a
couple of trophies as the CCS
Player of the Year in his junior
and senior years, Lambert will
assuredly see lots of action in
his first season here.
Dettamanti is confident
about his team's outlook this
season, and with good reason.
He's had what he refers to as
"without a doubt the best re
cruiting of any college in the
country for the last two years."
And that spells success.
* * * # *
The Stanford soccer team has
not been without its share of
success lately either. At one
time a weak and rarely pros
perous group, the Cards have
worked their way into national
recognition.
When Nelson Lodge took
over as head coach in 1976, he
inherited a 5-12-2 club. From
there he has gone nowhere but
up. In his first season he di
rected the Cards to a greatly
improved 9-9-2 mark, and the
following year ended with a
slightly better record of 10-8-2.
And then along came 1978, a
year of historic value for Cardi
nal soccer fans. It was by far
Stanford's best year, as the
team ended the season with a
16-5 record and a spot in the Far
West Regional Finals for the
first time since 1961.
In the regionals, the Cards
met the mighty University of
San Francisco. They scored two
quick goals on the Dons in the
first seven minutes but even
tually bowed out in a 6-3 defeat.
Lodge, always the optimist,
claims that his squad for 1979
will be everything last year's
model was, and more.
"We have a full veteran team
with a great deal of maturity,"
he said. "And our recruiting
year was incredibly good as
well."
To test Stanford's positive
outlook, Lodge has arranged
fora tougher schedule. Meeting
the Cards this year will be
Washington, always a conten
der for the Regionals, Cal
State-Fullerton and UC-Santa
Barbara.
"We're now in a position to
take on the best schools in the
country," Lodge said. "Our
schedule reflects the type of
team we have."
Returning, and adding ere

dence to Lodge's words, are
standouts Danny McNevin and
Ted Rafalovich.
McNevin, probably one of
the best midfielders in the
country, represented the U.S.
this summer in the World Uni
versity Games. He will work
with Willie Giucce, a transfer
student from Uruguay, to form
what could be a winning com
bination.
And then there's Rafalovich.
Coming to Stanford as a
freshman last year, he was the
Cards' first High School All-
America. In his first season he
blasted his way to 28 goals and
led the conference in scoring.
He also set a new Stanford
single-season scoring record,
and after one year he is not far
from the all-time Card scoring
mark.
The recruits that Lodge spoke
df so highly are being praised
as well. Arriving to
strengthen the Card effort are
Pennsylvanian Freddy Benz,
Ohioan Greg Jouriles and
Texan Mark Talkington.
The acquisition of former
USF standout Tony Igwe as
Lodge's assistant will be
another big plus for the Cards.
Igwe was one of the best over
lapping scoring fullbacks in the
country and should be able to
contribute immeasurably with
his knowledge of the game.
*****
Women's sports at Stanford
field similarly excellent teams.
The field hockey squad, for
example, had a fine season in
1978, winning eight, losing four
and tying five matches. That
mark was good enough for a
second-place finish in the ex
tremely competitive NorCal
Conference, behind champion
San Jose State.
Head coach Barbara
Longstreth, beginning her third
season with the Cards, views
her club's prospects as out
standing. She has a well
balanced, experienced team led
by eight returning letter
winners.
Heading the group of retur
nees are two Nancys — Nancy
White and Nancy Jackson.
White played on the U.S.
Field hockey team that toured
Europe last April and received
an invitation to participate in
the World Championships in
Vancouver, B.C.Jcist August.
Jackson has developed into a
very strong, consistent and
durable athlete, according to
Longstreth. She overcame in
juries incurred last year and
staged a dramatic improve
ment.
"We will have some work to
do to replace our great goal
keeper, Buffy Berger, whom we
lost to graduation," Longstreth

said, "but we have a capable
replacement in Lisa Kimball,
who was our junior varsity
goalkeeper for two years."
Other experienced players
include Paula Mishima, Julia
Johnson, Jeannie Valadez and
Kelly Westerwick. Westerwick,
a junior from Del Mar, led the
team with nine goals last sea
son.
Overall, Longstreth sees
Stanford as among the leaders
in the NorCal Conference and
says her ultimate goal is a trip to
the AIAW National Champion
ships.

In all honesty, it looks like it
will be a "building year" for the
women's volleyball team. But
that is by no means a put
down. At least not yet, anyway.
It's not as if there isn't any
volleyball talent around —
there's plenty. It's just that
much of it is very inexperi
enced. Consider that 13 of the
22 women on the roster are
freshmen. Figures such as that
are hard to ignore, even if they
are just figures.
Last year,coach Fred Sturm's
squad finished 14-7-1, just
barely losing to Long Beach
State in a qualifying match for a
berth in the regionals. Return
ing from last year's squad are
Sherry Norman and Jane Bas
sett. Both are seniors and
three-time lettermen and will
probably be counted on as team
leaders. Also returning is the
strong-setting, powerfully
spiking Jan Linden.
A tough break for the team
was the loss of outstanding
junior Chris Anderson. She will
be studying in Europe during
the season but should return
next year to contribute with her
skill and leadership.
Sturm believes that his team
will be in the league's top four
and thinks that University of
the Pacific could possibly be the

favorite to take the champion
ship. Also in the top four
should be rival California and
San Jose State.
Dianna Boyette, Allison Bis
zantz and Kisi Haine, all
freshmen, could mean the dif
erence between placing fourth
or doing worse.
But in anv case, with all his
newcomers, Sturm should be
building a sturdy foundation
for teams to come.
*****
Returning for the women's
cross-country team is Ann
Thrupp, a one-time All-
American award winner and a
strong candidate for another.
Coming off a 10th-place finish
in the 1978 AIAW finals,
Thrupp is a shining star for the
Cards.
Also returning are Annette
Mungai and Joanne Ernst, both
experienced juniors. Joining
the veterans will be Ann
Wotherspoon, a junior transfer
from West Valley JC, where she
was a two-time JC champion.
Also new on The Farm is Kim
Schnurpfiel, the NorCal Run
ner of the Year at San Mateo
High last season.
Things look good for the
women harriers, especially
with Thrupp returning for her
senior year and a quick group of
recruits entering.
Heading the field for the
men's team this year should be
senior Roy Kissin and sopho
more Rod Berry, both stand
nuts in tho '78 campaign. Berry
was named Stanford's Most
Valuable Cross Country
Athlete of the Year in 1978 and
may have another big year in
1979.
Head coach Dean Clark, in
his second season, has a vete
ran team to work with. Both the
team and the coach are familiar
with each other and could
prove to be a winning pair.

Breaking the tape has become a familiar scene to Ann Thrupp, a
Cardinal All-American. The outstanding senior will join a prom
ising crop of recruits to form coach Laurel Treon's women's
cross-country team.

It's not often that Jody Campbell can be caught still. Cardinal

nal soccer fans. It was by far
Stanford's best year, as the
team ended the season with a
16-5 record and a spot in the Far
West Regional Finals for the
first time since 1961.
In the regionals, the Cards
met the mighty University of
San Francisco. They scored two
quick goals on the Dons in the
first seven minutes but even
tually bowed out in a 6-3 defeat.
Lodge, always the optimist,
claims that his squad for 1979
will be everything last year's
model was, and more.
"We have a full veteran team
with a great deal of maturity,"
he said. "And our recruiting
year was incredibly good as
well."
To test Stanford's positive
outlook, Lodge has arranged
fora tougher schedule. Meeting
the Cards this year will be
Washington, always a conten
der for the Regionals, Cal
State-Fullerton and UC-Santa
Barbara.
"We're now in a position to
take on the best schools in the
country," Lodge said. "Our
schedule reflects the type of
team we have."
Returning, and adding ere

dence to Lodge's words, are
standouts Danny McNevin and
Ted Rafalovich.
McNevin, probably one of
the best midfielders in the
country, represented the U.S.
this summer in the World Uni
versity Games. He will work
with Willie Giucce, a transfer
student from Uruguay, to form
what could be a winning com
bination.
And then there's Rafalovich.
Coming to Stanford as a
freshman last year, he was the
Cards' first High School All-
America. In his first season he
blasted his way to 28 goals and
led the conference in scoring.
He also set a new Stanford
single-season scoring record,
and after one year he is not far
from the all-time Card scoring
mark.
The recruits that Lodge spoke
df so highly are being praised
as well. Arriving to
strengthen the Card effort are
Pennsylvanian Freddy Benz,
Ohioan Greg Jouriles and
Texan Mark Talkington.
The acquisition of former
USF standout Tony Igwe as
Lodge's assistant will be
another big plus for the Cards.
Igwe was one of the best over
lapping scoring fullbacks in the
country and should be able to
contribute immeasurably with
his knowledge of the game.

Women's sports at Stanford
field similarly excellent teams.
The field hockey squad, for
example, had a fine season in
1978, winning eight, losing four
and tying five matches. That
mark was good enough for a
second-place finish in the ex
tremely competitive NorCal
Conference, behind champion
San Jose State.
Head coach Barbara
Longstreth, beginning her third
season with the Cards, views
her club's prospects as out
standing. She has a well
balanced, experienced team led
by eight returning letter
winners.
Heading the group of retur
nees are two Nancys — Nancy
White and Nancy Jackson.
White played on the U.S.
Field hockey team that toured
Europe last April and received
an invitation to participate in
the World Championships in
Vancouver, B.C.Jcist August.
Jackson has developed into a
very strong, consistent and
durable athlete, according to
Longstreth. She overcame in
juries incurred last year and
staged a dramatic improve
ment.
"We will have some work to
do to replace our great goal
keeper, Buffy Berger, whom we
lost to graduation," Longstreth

said, "but we have a capable
replacement in Lisa Kimball,
who was our junior varsity
goalkeeper for two years."
Other experienced players
include Paula Mishima, Julia
Johnson, Jeannie Valadez and
Kelly Westerwick. Westerwick,
a junior from Del Mar, led the
team with nine goals last sea
son.
Overall, Longstreth sees
Stanford as among the leaders
in the NorCal Conference and
says her ultimate goal is a trip to
the AIAW National Champion
ships.

In all honesty, it looks like it
will be a "building year" for the
women's volleyball team. But
that is by no means a put
down. At least not yet, anyway.
It's not as if there isn't any
volleyball talent around —
there's plenty. It's just that
much of it is very inexperi
enced. Consider that 13 of the
22 women on the roster are
freshmen. Figures such as that
are hard to ignore, even if they
are just figures.
Last year,coach Fred Sturm's
squad finished 14-7-1, just
barely losing to Long Beach
State in a qualifying match for a
berth in the regionals. Return
ing from last year's squad are
Sherry Norman and Jane Bas
sett. Both are seniors and
three-time lettermen and will
probably be counted on as team
leaders. Also returning is the
strong-setting, powerfully
spiking Jan Linden.
A tough break for the team
was the loss of outstanding
junior Chris Anderson. She will
be studying in Europe during
the season but should return
next year to contribute with her
skill and leadership.
Sturm believes that his team
will be in the league's top four
and thinks that University of
the Pacific could possibly be the

favorite to take the champion
ship. Also in the top four
should be rival California and
San Jose State.
Dianna Boyette, Allison Bis
zantz and Kisi Haine, all
freshmen, could mean the dif
erence between placing fourth
or doing worse.
But in anv case, with all his
newcomers, Sturm should be
building a sturdy foundation
for teams to come.
*****
Returning for the women's
cross-country team is Ann
Thrupp, a one-time All-
American award winner and a
strong candidate for another.
Coming off a 10th-place finish
in the 1978 AIAW finals,
Thrupp is a shining star for the
Cards.
Also returning are Annette
Mungai and Joanne Ernst, both
experienced juniors. Joining
the veterans will be Ann
Wotherspoon, a junior transfer
from West Valley JC, where she
was a two-time JC champion.
Also new on The Farm is Kim
Schnurpfiel, the NorCal Run
ner of the Year at San Mateo
High last season.
Things look good for the
women harriers, especially
with Thrupp returning for her
senior year and a quick group of
recruits entering.
Heading the field for the
men's team this year should be
senior Roy Kissin and sopho
more Rod Berry, both stand
nuts in tho '78 campaign. Berry
was named Stanford's Most
Valuable Cross Country
Athlete of the Year in 1978 and
may have another big year in
1979.
Head coach Dean Clark, in
his second season, has a vete
ran team to work with. Both the
team and the coach are familiar
with each other and could
prove to be a winning pair.

Cardinal All-American. The outstanding senior will join a prom

cross-country team.

It's not often that Jody Campbell can be caught still. Cardinal
water polo coach Dante Dettamanti calls Campbell "probably the
most mobile hole man in the country." Campbell is just one of
several outstanding Stanford water poloists wno will be vying for
their second consecutive NCAA crown.
Sure, everybody knows that
Stanford has a top-notch foot
ball team. And most everybody
knows that for the last two
years the Cardinals have gained
berths and been victorious in
postseason bowl games.
But what many incoming
students don't realize is that
Stanford also has five other
quality fall sports programs.
The Card water polo team,
for example, is no less than the
number one squad in the coun
try. Last year Stanford racked
up the best regular-season re
cord in the nation en route to
its fourth straight Pacific-10
Conference championship and
a spot in the, NCAA tourna
ment.
There the Cards battled their
way through the ranks before
finally meeting rival California
in the championship finals. It
was no easy match, as both

teams battled through three
overtime periods. Finally, an
exhausted but nonetheless very
happy Stanford team walked
away from the pool with a 7-6
victory and a national title.
It wasn't the first time the
Cards had ever played for the
championship, though. Three
years ago, in 1976, they brought
the water polo crown to The
Farm. And two years ago, in
Dante Dettamanti's initial
coaching campaign, Stanford
placed third at the NCAAs. In
addition, the Cards have amas
sed a staggering 86-10 record
over the past four years.
Of course, this year's squad is
not exactly the same as any of
the others. Missing from the
1978 team are three collegiate
All-Americas in Doug Burke,
Robby Arnold and Tom
Angelo. Returning, however,
are All-Americas Jody
Campbell, Alan Mouchawar

and John Gansel.
Campbell, a sophomore, is
considered to be one of the top
hole men in the country. He is a
member of both the U.S. Junior
and Senior National teams and
may very well represent the
U.S. at the 1980 Olympic
Games.
Dettamanti, last year's Pac-10
Coach of the Year, called
Campbell "probably the most
mobile hole man in the coun
try" and a "triple threat," refer
ring to his skill in gaining posi
tion, scoring out of the hole and
fast breaking.
Mouchawar, also a sopho
more, was selected to the All-
America team in 1978. Interest
ingly enough, he was not even
a starter on last year's squad.
He will start this year, though,
and should contribute im
measurably to the Cards' pros
pects with his powerful outside
shooting.
For the past two years John
Gansel, a member of both the
U.S. Juniorand Senior National
teams, has been considered the
top goalie in the nation. Last
year he held his opponents to
less than half of his own team's
output.
But, as Dettamanti reminds,
"John not only blocks the ball,
but he directs the defense and is
also a catalyst for our fast breaks
with his excellent outlet pas
ses."
Pitching in for the Cards as
well will be the experienced
Randy Kalbus, a quick player
who seems always to be in mo
tion. Also in the swim is Chris
Kelsey, a sophomore who
makes up for his lack of size by
outsmarting his opponents,
and Steve Smith, a big, fast
athlete.
There are 12 incoming
freshmen vying for spots, too.
Heading that group are two
outstanding recruits in James
Bergeson and Greg Lambert.
Bergeson, called the top high
school player in the nation, is
practically assured a spot on the
Card first string. For the past
three years he has been voted to
the High School All-America
team, and twice he was named
the Southern California Player
of the Year.
"He's one of the top high
school players I've ever seen,"
said Dettamanti. "Most coaches
agree that he's the best player
ever at the high school level."
Lambert, the other top re
cruit, comes from nearby Await
High and is the son of former

Stanford and U.S. Olympic
coach Art Lambert. The
younger Lambert also is not
without his share of accolades.
Named a High School All-
America twice and grabbing a
couple of trophies as the CCS
Player of the Year in his junior
and senior years, Lambert will
assuredly see lots of action in
his first season here.
Dettamanti is confident
about his team's outlook this
season, and with good reason.
He's had what he refers to as
"without a doubt the best re
cruiting of any college in the
country for the last two years."
And that spells success.
* * * # *
The Stanford soccer team has
not been without its share of
success lately either. At one
time a weak and rarely pros
perous group, the Cards have
worked their way into national
recognition.
When Nelson Lodge took
over as head coach in 1976, he
inherited a 5-12-2 club. From
there he has gone nowhere but
up. In his first season he di
rected the Cards to a greatly
improved 9-9-2 mark, and the
following year ended with a
slightly better record of 10-8-2.
And then along came 1978, a
year of historic value for Cardi
nal soccer fans. It was by far
Stanford's best year, as the
team ended the season with a
16-5 record and a spot in the Far

Returning for the women's
cross-country team is Ann
Thrupp, a one-time All-
American award winner and a
strong candidate for another.
Coming off a 10th-place finish
in the 1978 AIAW finals,
Thrupp is a shining star for the
Cards.
Also returning are Annette
Mungai and Joanne Ernst, both
experienced juniors. Joining
the veterans will be Ann
Wotherspoon, a junior transfer
from West Valley JC, where she
was a two-time JC champion.
Also new on The Farm is Kim
Schnurpfiel, the NorCal Run
ner of the Year at San Mateo
High last season.
Things look good for the
women harriers, especially
with Thrupp returning for her
senior year and a quick group of
recruits entering.
Heading the field for the
men's team this year should be
senior Roy Kissin and sopho
more Rod Berry, both stand
nuts in tho '78 campaign. Berry
was named Stanford's Most
Valuable Cross Country
Athlete of the Year in 1978 and
may have another big year in
1979.
Head coach Dean Clark, in
his second season, has a vete
ran team to work with. Both the
team and the coach are familiar
with each other and could
prove to be a winning pair.

It's not often that Jody Campbell can be caught still. Cardinal
water polo coach Dante Dettamanti calls Campbell "probably the
most mobile hole man in the country." Campbell is just one of
several outstanding Stanford water poloists wno will be vying for
their second consecutive NCAA crown.
Sure, everybody knows that
Stanford has a top-notch foot
ball team. And most everybody
knows that for the last two
years the Cardinals have gained
berths and been victorious in
postseason bowl games.
But what many incoming
students don't realize is that
Stanford also has five other
quality fall sports programs.
The Card water polo team,
for example, is no less than the
number one squad in the coun
try. Last year Stanford racked
up the best regular-season re
cord in the nation en route to
its fourth straight Pacific-10
Conference championship and
a spot in the, NCAA tourna
ment.
There the Cards battled their
way through the ranks before
finally meeting rival California
in the championship finals. It
was no easy match, as both

teams battled through three
overtime periods. Finally, an
exhausted but nonetheless very
happy Stanford team walked
away from the pool with a 7-6
victory and a national title.
It wasn't the first time the
Cards had ever played for the
championship, though. Three
years ago, in 1976, they brought
the water polo crown to The
Farm. And two years ago, in
Dante Dettamanti's initial
coaching campaign, Stanford
placed third at the NCAAs. In
addition, the Cards have amas
sed a staggering 86-10 record
over the past four years.
Of course, this year's squad is
not exactly the same as any of
the others. Missing from the
1978 team are three collegiate
All-Americas in Doug Burke,
Robby Arnold and Tom
Angelo. Returning, however,
are All-Americas Jody
Campbell, Alan Mouchawar

and John Gansel.
Campbell, a sophomore, is
considered to be one of the top
hole men in the country. He is a
member of both the U.S. Junior
and Senior National teams and
may very well represent the
U.S. at the 1980 Olympic
Games.
Dettamanti, last year's Pac-10
Coach of the Year, called
Campbell "probably the most
mobile hole man in the coun
try" and a "triple threat," refer
ring to his skill in gaining posi
tion, scoring out of the hole and
fast breaking.
Mouchawar, also a sopho
more, was selected to the All-
America team in 1978. Interest
ingly enough, he was not even
a starter on last year's squad.
He will start this year, though,
and should contribute im
measurably to the Cards' pros
pects with his powerful outside
shooting.
For the past two years John
Gansel, a member of both the
U.S. Juniorand Senior National
teams, has been considered the
top goalie in the nation. Last
year he held his opponents to
less than half of his own team's
output.
But, as Dettamanti reminds,
"John not only blocks the ball,
but he directs the defense and is
also a catalyst for our fast breaks
with his excellent outlet pas
ses."
Pitching in for the Cards as
well will be the experienced
Randy Kalbus, a quick player
who seems always to be in mo
tion. Also in the swim is Chris
Kelsey, a sophomore who
makes up for his lack of size by
outsmarting his opponents,
and Steve Smith, a big, fast
athlete.
There are 12 incoming
freshmen vying for spots, too.
Heading that group are two
outstanding recruits in James
Bergeson and Greg Lambert.
Bergeson, called the top high
school player in the nation, is
practically assured a spot on the
Card first string. For the past
three years he has been voted to
the High School All-America
team, and twice he was named
the Southern California Player
of the Year.
"He's one of the top high
school players I've ever seen,"
said Dettamanti. "Most coaches
agree that he's the best player
ever at the high school level."
Lambert, the other top re
cruit, comes from nearby Await
High and is the son of former

Stanford and U.S. Olympic
coach Art Lambert. The
younger Lambert also is not
without his share of accolades.
Named a High School All-
America twice and grabbing a
couple of trophies as the CCS
Player of the Year in his junior
and senior years, Lambert will
assuredly see lots of action in
his first season here.
Dettamanti is confident
about his team's outlook this
season, and with good reason.
He's had what he refers to as
"without a doubt the best re
cruiting of any college in the
country for the last two years."
And that spells success.
* * * # *
The Stanford soccer team has
not been without its share of
success lately either. At one
time a weak and rarely pros
perous group, the Cards have
worked their way into national
recognition.
When Nelson Lodge took
over as head coach in 1976, he
inherited a 5-12-2 club. From
there he has gone nowhere but
up. In his first season he di
rected the Cards to a greatly
improved 9-9-2 mark, and the
following year ended with a
slightly better record of 10-8-2.
And then along came 1978, a
year of historic value for Cardi
nal soccer fans. It was by far
Stanford's best year, as the
team ended the season with a
16-5 record and a spot in the Far
West Regional Finals for the
first time since 1961.
In the regionals, the Cards
met the mighty University of
San Francisco. They scored two
quick goals on the Dons in the
first seven minutes but even
tually bowed out in a 6-3 defeat.
Lodge, always the optimist,
claims that his squad for 1979
will be everything last year's
model was, and more.
"We have a full veteran team
with a great deal of maturity,"
he said. "And our recruiting
year was incredibly good as
well."
To test Stanford's positive
outlook, Lodge has arranged
fora tougher schedule. Meeting
the Cards this year will be
Washington, always a conten
der for the Regionals, Cal
State-Fullerton and UC-Santa
Barbara.
"We're now in a position to
take on the best schools in the
country," Lodge said. "Our
schedule reflects the type of
team we have."
Returning, and adding ere

dence to Lodge's words, are
standouts Danny McNevin and
Ted Rafalovich.
McNevin, probably one of
the best midfielders in the
country, represented the U.S.
this summer in the World Uni
versity Games. He will work
with Willie Giucce, a transfer
student from Uruguay, to form
what could be a winning com
bination.
And then there's Rafalovich.
Coming to Stanford as a
freshman last year, he was the
Cards' first High School All-
America. In his first season he
blasted his way to 28 goals and
led the conference in scoring.
He also set a new Stanford
single-season scoring record,
and after one year he is not far
from the all-time Card scoring
mark.
The recruits that Lodge spoke
df so highly are being praised
as well. Arriving to
strengthen the Card effort are
Pennsylvanian Freddy Benz,
Ohioan Greg Jouriles and
Texan Mark Talkington.
The acquisition of former
USF standout Tony Igwe as
Lodge's assistant will be
another big plus for the Cards.
Igwe was one of the best over
lapping scoring fullbacks in the
country and should be able to
contribute immeasurably with
his knowledge of the game.
*****
Women's sports at Stanford
field similarly excellent teams.
The field hockey squad, for
example, had a fine season in
1978, winning eight, losing four
and tying five matches. That
mark was good enough for a
second-place finish in the ex
tremely competitive NorCal
Conference, behind champion
San Jose State.
Head coach Barbara
Longstreth, beginning her third
season with the Cards, views
her club's prospects as out
standing. She has a well
balanced, experienced team led
by eight returning letter
winners.
Heading the group of retur
nees are two Nancys — Nancy
White and Nancy Jackson.
White played on the U.S.
Field hockey team that toured
Europe last April and received
an invitation to participate in
the World Championships in
Vancouver, B.C.Jcist August.
Jackson has developed into a
very strong, consistent and
durable athlete, according to
Longstreth. She overcame in
juries incurred last year and
staged a dramatic improve
ment.
"We will have some work to
do to replace our great goal
keeper, Buffy Berger, whom we
lost to graduation," Longstreth

said, "but we have a capable
replacement in Lisa Kimball,
who was our junior varsity
goalkeeper for two years."
Other experienced players
include Paula Mishima, Julia
Johnson, Jeannie Valadez and
Kelly Westerwick. Westerwick,
a junior from Del Mar, led the
team with nine goals last sea
son.
Overall, Longstreth sees
Stanford as among the leaders
in the NorCal Conference and
says her ultimate goal is a trip to
the AIAW National Champion
ships.

In all honesty, it looks like it
will be a "building year" for the
women's volleyball team. But
that is by no means a put
down. At least not yet, anyway.
It's not as if there isn't any
volleyball talent around —
there's plenty. It's just that
much of it is very inexperi
enced. Consider that 13 of the
22 women on the roster are
freshmen. Figures such as that
are hard to ignore, even if they
are just figures.
Last year,coach Fred Sturm's
squad finished 14-7-1, just
barely losing to Long Beach
State in a qualifying match for a
berth in the regionals. Return
ing from last year's squad are
Sherry Norman and Jane Bas
sett. Both are seniors and
three-time lettermen and will
probably be counted on as team
leaders. Also returning is the
strong-setting, powerfully
spiking Jan Linden.
A tough break for the team
was the loss of outstanding
junior Chris Anderson. She will
be studying in Europe during
the season but should return
next year to contribute with her
skill and leadership.
Sturm believes that his team
will be in the league's top four
and thinks that University of
the Pacific could possibly be the

favorite to take the champion
ship. Also in the top four
should be rival California and
San Jose State.
Dianna Boyette, Allison Bis
zantz and Kisi Haine, all
freshmen, could mean the dif

who seems always to be in mo
tion. Also in the swim is Chris
Kelsey, a sophomore who
makes up for his lack of size by
outsmarting his opponents,
and Steve Smith, a big, fast
athlete.
There are 12 incoming
freshmen vying for spots, too.
Heading that group are two
outstanding recruits in James
Bergeson and Greg Lambert.
Bergeson, called the top high
school player in the nation, is
practically assured a spot on the
Card first string. For the past
three years he has been voted to
the High School All-America
team, and twice he was named
the Southern California Player
of the Year.
"He's one of the top high
school players I've ever seen,"
said Dettamanti. "Most coaches
agree that he's the best player
ever at the high school level."
Lambert, the other top re
cruit, comes from nearby Await
High and is the son of former

Stanford and U.S. Olympic
coach Art Lambert. The
younger Lambert also is not
without his share of accolades.
Named a High School All-
America twice and grabbing a
couple of trophies as the CCS
Player of the Year in his junior
and senior years, Lambert will
assuredly see lots of action in
his first season here.
Dettamanti is confident
about his team's outlook this
season, and with good reason.
He's had what he refers to as
"without a doubt the best re
cruiting of any college in the
country for the last two years."
And that spells success.

The Stanford soccer team has
not been without its share of
success lately either. At one
time a weak and rarely pros
perous group, the Cards have
worked their way into national
recognition.
When Nelson Lodge took
over as head coach in 1976, he
inherited a 5-12-2 club. From
there he has gone nowhere but
up. In his first season he di
rected the Cards to a greatly
improved 9-9-2 mark, and the
following year ended with a
slightly better record of 10-8-2.
And then along came 1978, a
year of historic value for Cardi
nal soccer fans. It was by far
Stanford's best year, as the
team ended the season with a
16-5 record and a spot in the Far
West Regional Finals for the
first time since 1961.
In the regionals, the Cards
met the mighty University of
San Francisco. They scored two
quick goals on the Dons in the
first seven minutes but even
tually bowed out in a 6-3 defeat.
Lodge, always the optimist,
claims that his squad for 1979
will be everything last year's
model was, and more.
"We have a full veteran team
with a great deal of maturity,"
he said. "And our recruiting
year was incredibly good as
well."
To test Stanford's positive
outlook, Lodge has arranged
fora tougher schedule. Meeting
the Cards this year will be
Washington, always a conten
der for the Regionals, Cal
State-Fullerton and UC-Santa
Barbara.
"We're now in a position to
take on the best schools in the
country," Lodge said. "Our
schedule reflects the type of
team we have."
Returning, and adding ere

dence to Lodge's words, are
standouts Danny McNevin and
Ted Rafalovich.
McNevin, probably one of
the best midfielders in the
country, represented the U.S.
this summer in the World Uni
versity Games. He will work
with Willie Giucce, a transfer
student from Uruguay, to form
what could be a winning com
bination.
And then there's Rafalovich.
Coming to Stanford as a
freshman last year, he was the
Cards' first High School All-
America. In his first season he
blasted his way to 28 goals and
led the conference in scoring.
He also set a new Stanford
single-season scoring record,
and after one year he is not far
from the all-time Card scoring
mark.
The recruits that Lodge spoke
df so highly are being praised
as well. Arriving to
strengthen the Card effort are
Pennsylvanian Freddy Benz,
Ohioan Greg Jouriles and
Texan Mark Talkington.
The acquisition of former
USF standout Tony Igwe as
Lodge's assistant will be
another big plus for the Cards.
Igwe was one of the best over
lapping scoring fullbacks in the
country and should be able to
contribute immeasurably with
his knowledge of the game.
*****
Women's sports at Stanford
field similarly excellent teams.
The field hockey squad, for
example, had a fine season in
1978, winning eight, losing four
and tying five matches. That
mark was good enough for a
second-place finish in the ex
tremely competitive NorCal
Conference, behind champion
San Jose State.
Head coach Barbara
Longstreth, beginning her third
season with the Cards, views
her club's prospects as out
standing. She has a well
balanced, experienced team led
by eight returning letter
winners.
Heading the group of retur
nees are two Nancys — Nancy
White and Nancy Jackson.
White played on the U.S.
Field hockey team that toured
Europe last April and received
an invitation to participate in
the World Championships in
Vancouver, B.C.Jcist August.
Jackson has developed into a
very strong, consistent and
durable athlete, according to
Longstreth. She overcame in
juries incurred last year and
staged a dramatic improve
ment.
"We will have some work to
do to replace our great goal
keeper, Buffy Berger, whom we
lost to graduation," Longstreth

said, "but we have a capable
replacement in Lisa Kimball,
who was our junior varsity
goalkeeper for two years."
Other experienced players
include Paula Mishima, Julia
Johnson, Jeannie Valadez and
Kelly Westerwick. Westerwick,
a junior from Del Mar, led the
team with nine goals last sea
son.
Overall, Longstreth sees
Stanford as among the leaders
in the NorCal Conference and
says her ultimate goal is a trip to
the AIAW National Champion
ships.

In all honesty, it looks like it
will be a "building year" for the
women's volleyball team. But
that is by no means a put
down. At least not yet, anyway.
It's not as if there isn't any
volleyball talent around —
there's plenty. It's just that
much of it is very inexperi
enced. Consider that 13 of the
22 women on the roster are
freshmen. Figures such as that
are hard to ignore, even if they
are just figures.
Last year,coach Fred Sturm's
squad finished 14-7-1, just
barely losing to Long Beach
State in a qualifying match for a
berth in the regionals. Return
ing from last year's squad are
Sherry Norman and Jane Bas
sett. Both are seniors and
three-time lettermen and will
probably be counted on as team
leaders. Also returning is the
strong-setting, powerfully
spiking Jan Linden.
A tough break for the team
was the loss of outstanding
junior Chris Anderson. She will
be studying in Europe during
the season but should return
next year to contribute with her
skill and leadership.
Sturm believes that his team
will be in the league's top four
and thinks that University of
the Pacific could possibly be the

favorite to take the champion
ship. Also in the top four
should be rival California and
San Jose State.
Dianna Boyette, Allison Bis
zantz and Kisi Haine, all
freshmen, could mean the dif
erence between placing fourth
or doing worse.
But in anv case, with all his
newcomers, Sturm should be
building a sturdy foundation
for teams to come.
*****
Returning for the women's
cross-country team is Ann
Thrupp, a one-time All-
American award winner and a
strong candidate for another.
Coming off a 10th-place finish
in the 1978 AIAW finals,
Thrupp is a shining star for the
Cards.
Also returning are Annette
Mungai and Joanne Ernst, both
experienced juniors. Joining
the veterans will be Ann
Wotherspoon, a junior transfer
from West Valley JC, where she
was a two-time JC champion.
Also new on The Farm is Kim
Schnurpfiel, the NorCal Run
ner of the Year at San Mateo
High last season.
Things look good for the
women harriers, especially
with Thrupp returning for her
senior year and a quick group of
recruits entering.
Heading the field for the
men's team this year should be
senior Roy Kissin and sopho
more Rod Berry, both stand
nuts in tho '78 campaign. Berry
was named Stanford's Most
Valuable Cross Country
Athlete of the Year in 1978 and
may have another big year in
1979.
Head coach Dean Clark, in
his second season, has a vete
ran team to work with. Both the
team and the coach are familiar
with each other and could
prove to be a winning pair.

Breaking the tape has become a familiar scene to Ann Thrupp, a
Cardinal All-American. The outstanding senior will join a prom
ising crop of recruits to form coach Laurel Treon's women's
cross-country team.

It's not often that Jody Campbell can be caught still. Cardinal
water polo coach Dante Dettamanti calls Campbell "probably the
most mobile hole man in the country." Campbell is just one of
several outstanding Stanford water poloists wno will be vying for
their second consecutive NCAA crown.
Sure, everybody knows that
Stanford has a top-notch foot
ball team. And most everybody
knows that for the last two
years the Cardinals have gained
berths and been victorious in
postseason bowl games.
But what many incoming
students don't realize is that
Stanford also has five other
quality fall sports programs.
The Card water polo team,
for example, is no less than the
number one squad in the coun
try. Last year Stanford racked
up the best regular-season re
cord in the nation en route to
its fourth straight Pacific-10
Conference championship and
a spot in the, NCAA tourna
ment.
There the Cards battled their
way through the ranks before
finally meeting rival California
in the championship finals. It
was no easy match, as both

teams battled through three
overtime periods. Finally, an
exhausted but nonetheless very
happy Stanford team walked
away from the pool with a 7-6
victory and a national title.
It wasn't the first time the
Cards had ever played for the
championship, though. Three
years ago, in 1976, they brought
the water polo crown to The
Farm. And two years ago, in
Dante Dettamanti's initial
coaching campaign, Stanford
placed third at the NCAAs. In
addition, the Cards have amas
sed a staggering 86-10 record
over the past four years.
Of course, this year's squad is
not exactly the same as any of
the others. Missing from the
1978 team are three collegiate
All-Americas in Doug Burke,
Robby Arnold and Tom
Angelo. Returning, however,
are All-Americas Jody
Campbell, Alan Mouchawar

and John Gansel.
Campbell, a sophomore, is
considered to be one of the top
hole men in the country. He is a
member of both the U.S. Junior
and Senior National teams and
may very well represent the
U.S. at the 1980 Olympic
Games.
Dettamanti, last year's Pac-10
Coach of the Year, called
Campbell "probably the most
mobile hole man in the coun
try" and a "triple threat," refer
ring to his skill in gaining posi
tion, scoring out of the hole and
fast breaking.
Mouchawar, also a sopho
more, was selected to the All-
America team in 1978. Interest
ingly enough, he was not even
a starter on last year's squad.
He will start this year, though,
and should contribute im
measurably to the Cards' pros
pects with his powerful outside
shooting.
For the past two years John
Gansel, a member of both the
U.S. Juniorand Senior National
teams, has been considered the
top goalie in the nation. Last
year he held his opponents to
less than half of his own team's
output.
But, as Dettamanti reminds,
"John not only blocks the ball,
but he directs the defense and is
also a catalyst for our fast breaks
with his excellent outlet pas
ses."
Pitching in for the Cards as
well will be the experienced
Randy Kalbus, a quick player
who seems always to be in mo
tion. Also in the swim is Chris
Kelsey, a sophomore who
makes up for his lack of size by
outsmarting his opponents,
and Steve Smith, a big, fast
athlete.
There are 12 incoming

cruit, comes from nearby Await
