# Nelson gone, but grid show goes on
## End of decade marks beginning for Dowhower 
### Ivan Maisel 
The Stanford Cardinals are
about as happy to see the '70s
conclude as Muhammad Ali;
that is to say, the past nine
years have been as good to
Stanford's football fortunes as
they have been to Ali's pugilis-tic
ones, and both the Cards and
"The Greatest" regret their en
ding.
While Ali floated and stung
his way to the heavyweight
championship twice in the era
of Watergate and disco music,
the Cards have passed and pas
sed (and passed) their way to a
65-35-3 record.
Stanford has collected one
Pacific-8 Conference champ
ionship in the past nine years,
along with two Rose Bowl vic
tories and a 4-0 postseason
mark.
In addition, more than two
dozen Card alumni have made
their way into the professional

ranks, including All-American
quarterback Guy Benjamin of
the Miami Dolphins, Dallas
Cowboy guard Pat Donovan
and Green Bay Packer wide re
ceiver James Lofton.
1979 brings the emergence of
Stanford's fourth head coach
this decade— Ord, Nebraska's
Rod Dowhower. Dowhower
came to Stanford with Bill
Walsh as offensive coordinator
and took over when Walsh be
came head coach of the San
Francisco 49ers.
When the 36-year-old
Dowhower grabbed the coach
ing reins on January 9, he was
taking over a team which was
returning 15 starters from a
Bluebonnet Bowl champion 8-4
squad.
However, in the past eight
months, Dowhower has had
poorer luck than a Three Mile
Island real estate agent. Every
casino in Las Vegas has begged

him to visit. The insurance
companies will not touch him
with a 10-foot pole. For
Dowhower has lost four star
ters in the last eight months and
none of them on the football
field.
The most damaging loss oc
curred when Darrin Nelson,
Stanford's answer to Cool Papa
Bell (an ex-baseball player who
was so fast that he could turn
out the lights and be in bed be
fore it was dark), tore a hamstr
ing tendon long-jumping in a
track meet on March 31. One
week before the Cards' season
opener against Tulane, Nelson
announced that he wanted to
sit out the 1979 campaign.
Nelson is the only player in
NCAA history to rush for 1000
yards and catch 50 passes in the
same season — and he has done
it twice. To say he is an integral
part of the Card offense is to say
that Leonid Brezhnev is an in
tegral part of the Soviet gov
ernment.
The 5-foot-9, 175-pounder
had undergone a rigorous re
habilitation program to get
ready for this season, but
Dowhower said that no
risks would be taken when the
time came to make a decision
about Nelson's readiness.
"Darrin is the concern — his
personal welfare is the most
important consideration,"
Dowhower said.
A week before Nelson's final
decision, the prospects for his
full recovery appeared some
what optimistic. Nelson placed
his effectiveness at "about 90
percent" and added that he
would know whether or not he
was back after one play.
"If I get hit and bounce up
and run back to the huddle, I'll
be okay," Nelson said with a
smile. "If I just lay thert?, 1 don't
think I'll make it."
That play indeed occurred.
Grabbed from behind on a run
ning play in practice, Nelson
felt a fateful soreness.
"It hurt a little, but 1 knew the
first time I got hit that it would
hurt," Nelson told reporters.
"It was kind of a sharp pain. It
didn't last that long, and I went
back in after a play. It was like
someone stepping on your foot.
"But it started to hurt later,"
Nelson went on. "I just started
to hurt again, and I knew it
wasn't gonna be ready, so I
went in and told coach
Dowhower. If I wasn't going to
be ready by the beginning,
there was no sense in playing."
The three remaining men
who will not wear the
cardinal-and-cream this y*?ar

wefe all felled by different cul
prits.
Second team All-Pac-10
safety Robby Chapman was cut
down by insufficient grades
and will not be back until 1980
at the earliest. Linebacker Steve
Budinger was severely injured
in a February automobile acci
dent and spent the summer just
pleased that he was walking
around. He too will be back in
1980.
The latest blow — and the
most shocking one — was the
ruling by the Pac-10 office that
fifth-year senior defensive end
Dean Wilson is ineligible to
play.
Wilson, a two-year starter
since his transfer from
Grossmont Junior College, was
thought to have had a year of
eligibility remaining since he
was redshirted for a full season
at Grossmont. The NCAA
rulebook clearly states that JC
redshirt years are not transfer
able to a four-year school, a
paragraph in the rulebook Stan
ford officials seem to have mis
sed.
Athletic Department rep
resentatives recently disco
vered that there might be a
question concerning Wilson's
status and asked the Pac-10 of
fice for a clarification. The ans
wer: no go.
In addition, chances exist
that Dowhower will lose a fifth
player to off-the-field misfor
tune. Like Nelson, linebacker
Tom Hall began practice with
hopes of overcoming injury.
Hall, who had 90 tackles and
two sacks a season ago, dam
aged his foot in an April motor
cycle accident and at one point
was, in Dowhower's words "at
85 percent" in preseason drills.
At press time Hall's status for
the season opener with Tulane
remained doubtful.
In addition to these losses are
those produced by the gradua
tion of quarterback Steve Dils,
the nation's passing champion
of 1978, linebacker Gordy Cere
sino, Stanford's all-tifhe lead
ing tackier, and fullback Phil
Francis. One might wonder
why Dowhower was not hit by
Skylab this summer, but maybe
that bit of good luck turned the
tide, for the Cards still look im
pressive as the season gets
under way.
Nov.' that the problem of Nel
son's health is laid to rest, the
biggest offensive question mark
is at quarterback.
USC has its running backs,
Penn State its linebackers and
Stanford its quarterbacks. The
alma mater of Frankie Albert,

John Brodie, Jim Plunkett, Mike
Boryla, Benjamin and Dils
without a front-line quarter
backi would be like New York
without a deli.
This year's edition is Turk
Schonert, a 6-foot-2, 185-
pound native of Placentia. Like
Dils last season, Schonert is in
his fifth year. Like Dils,
Schonert saw very little ac
tion prior to this year.
More importantly, however,
Schonert has the full confi
dence of his head coach just as
Dils had a season ago.
"He lacks game experience,"
Dowhower said, "but when
he's on the field the players feel
good about him and I feel good
about him."
Schonert is equally assured
of his capability. "1 have confi
dence I can put the ball accu
rately anywhere on the field,"
he said.
The man Schonert will be
putting it to most often is
flanker Ken Margerum, who
like his junior counterparts
Emmanuel Tolbert of Southern
Methodist University and Mar
dye McDole of Mississippi
State, is one of the best in the
nation at catching the ball.
Margerum hauled in 53 pas
ses for 942 yards and nine
touchdowns last year and was

a shoo-in for All-Pac-10 ac
robat. The Fountain Valley na
tive spent this summer working
out with Schonert and develop
ing the rapport necessary bet
ween passer and receiver.
"Turk's more relaxed out
there," Margerum said. "He
has the type of personality
where the pressure of being
'the Stanford quarterback'
won't get to him."
Also hoping that pressure
doesn't get to the Stanford
quarterback will be an offensive
line anchored by second-team
All-Pac-10 center John
Macaulay and right tackle Brian
Holloway.
Stanford's defense matured
greatly as 1978 progressed and
may well be the first "grown
up" defense The Farm has seen
since the 1971 Thunderchic
kens.
Leading the unit — physi
cally and spiritually — is fifth
year senior defensive end
Chuck Evans. The team's
fourth-leading tackier a year
ago with 92 stops, Evans earned
honorable mention All-
America honors from Football
News.
Wilson's unexpected depar
ture left a hole to be filled in
Stanford's three-man line, but
junior Duker Dapper, Wilson's

backup last season, is slated to
take his place. Enormously
talented sophomore Doug Ro
gers is at nose guard.
The linebackers — those that
possess warm, healthy bodies
— will be led by junior Milt
McColl. The second-year star
ter is part of a rich legacy at
Stanford; his father Bill was a
two-time Ail-American and his
brother Duncan received simi
lar accolades in 1976.
Heading the secondary is re
turning right halfback Rick
Parker, who had 56 tackles and
two interceptions last season.
Rick Gervais, Rodney Gilmore,
Keith Burcham and Steve Foley
are among the other top defen
sive backs.
DowhoWer's greatest ac
complishment thus far has been
his gathering of a glittering
batch of freshmen.
The prize catch was quarter
back John Elway of Northridge.
Having already won the
number two spot behind
Schonert, the 6-foot-3, 180-
pounder has an arm that others
only dream about — others
being opposing coaches having
nightmares.
Joining Elway as top-notch
backfield recruits are fullback
Rob Moore and halfback Vin

improvement on defense.

Sophomore halfback LaMott Atkins looks for running room last year against San Jose State. Atkins
has accepted the unenviable task of taking Darrin Nelson's place in the starting backfield, bui
Cardinal coach Rod Dowhower is confident that Atkins will perform solidly throughout 1979.
