Though Stanford's varsity
coaching staff blasts no Nobel
Prize winners, the Cardinal ath
letic mentors are nevertheless
as competent and expert in
their respective fields as any
physicist or psychologist is in
his.
Baseball — Stanford is in
deed home to MARK
MARQUESS,head Cardinal
baseball coach. Marquess
graduated in 1969 as one of the
finest two-sport athletes in
Stanford history. During au

son, 1975-76, Dißiaso guided

Maybe the Armed Forces

for tips on how to recruit. After
leading her cagers to a 7-7 re
cord in her tirst season, 1976-

77, McCrea lured forward
Kathy Murphy to Stanford for
1977-78 and, presto! the Cards
finished 17-12. But that was no
thing compared to last season,
when McCrea's two hot
freshmen, guard Angie Pac
cione and forward-center
Jeanne Ruark, paced Stanford
to a 19-6 mark. McCrea, who
obviously knows how to build a
team, was a two-time AAU

Kathy Murphy to Stanford for
1977-78 and, presto! the Cards
finished 17-12. But that was no
thing compared to last season,
when McCrea's two hot

ing 113-66 career record.
Men's basketball — Gener
ally regarded as one of the best
young coaches in the country,
DICK DiBIASO will try for the
fifth time to bring winning bas
ketball to Stanford. Certainly
Dißiaso knows what successful
hoop is like; he served as an
assistant coach to Digger
Phelps at Notre Dame for four
years before coming to The
Farm in 1975. In his rookie sea
son, 1975-76, Dißiaso guided
Stanford to an 11 -16 record and
earned Pacific-8 Conference
Co-Coach of the Year honors in
a vote by his peers. Dißiaso first
gained notoriety as a record
setting rebounder at Mansfield
State College (Pa.).
Women's basketball —
Maybe the Armed Forces
should ask DOTTY McCREA
for tips on how to recruit. After
leading her cagers to a 7-7 re
cord in her tirst season, 1976-

77, McCrea lured forward
Kathy Murphy to Stanford for
1977-78 and, presto! the Cards
finished 17-12. But that was no
thing compared to last season,
when McCrea's two hot
freshmen, guard Angie Pac
cione and forward-center
Jeanne Ruark, paced Stanford
to a 19-6 mark. McCrea, who
obviously knows how to build a
team, was a two-time AAU
All-America. At Monmouth
College in West Long Branch,
New jersey, McCrea won let
ters in basketball, Softball, ten
nis, volleyball and field hockey.

graduate of Beaver College rep
resented the U.S. in tours to
Great Britain, Ireland and
Denmark.
Football — Widely regarded
as a genius in offensive football,
first-year head coach ROD
DOWHOWER seems certain to
continue the tradition of high
powered, point-producing
Stanford football. After earning
All-Coast and small college
All-America honors in 1964 as a
quarterback at San Diego State,
Dowhower spent the 1965 sea
son on the San Francisco 49ers'
taxi squad. While assisting on
the football staff at San Diego

is slowly but surely gaining
prominence in America, it is
doing the same at Stanford,
thanks to head soccer coach

over a 5-12-2 club in 1976, im
proved it to 9-9-2 that season,
bettered it even more to 10-8-2
in '77 and reached'a plateau

joyed outstanding athletic
careers during their competi
tive days. CLAUDIA
THOMAS is one such coach.
The 1968 Olympics at Mexico
City were a showcase for
Thomas, as she won both the
200- and 400-meter individual
medleys. At the 1964 Tokyo
Olympics she was the silver
medalist in the 200-meter
breaststroke. From 1964 to 1968
she broke 11 world records.
Thomas' coaching experience
includes seven years as the
Santa Clara Swim Club's assis

Men's tennis — Whether it
comes to promoting or teaching
tennis, DICK GOULD is a suc
cess. Under his tutelage, the
Cards won NCAA titles in 1973,
'74, '77 and '78. Fifteen of his
players have won All-America
honors. At Stanford Gould
owns a phenomenal record of

Men's and women's vol
leyball — A winning
background makes FRED
STURM an ideal mentor for the
Card spikers. A member of
three NCAA championship
teams at UCLA, Sturm twice
was a member of the U.S. Na
tional team and was named
Ail-America by the U.S. Vol
leyball Association in both 1976
and '77. Sturm enjoyed a suc

frightening 5-16 season with
the men in their initial year in
the tough California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association.
Men's track and field —
BROOKS JOHNSON is a new
comer to Stanford but that
doesn't mean he has to make a
name for himself. Johnson has
aleady accomplished that, for
he has gained extensive coach

and international levels. As
track and field coach at Santa Fe
Community College (Gaines
ville, Fia.) for the past two
years, Johnson produced 20 JC
All-Americas and 13 individual

Water polo — Perfection isn't
far away for the Stanford water
polo team and its coach,
DANTE DETTAMANTI. In his
second year as the Card head
man, Dettamanti engineered a
26-1-1 campaign, highlighted
by a 7-1 Pacific-10 Conference
championship record and a
NCAA crown. Success, how
ever, is nothing new to De
ttamanti. He has coached more
than 30 swimming and water
polo All-Americans. In two
years at Stanford, three at UC-
Santa Barbara and four at Occi
dental, Dettamanti's record is
142-65-1. A 1965 graduate of
