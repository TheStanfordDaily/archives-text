# Half-Baked Ideas
## Booze and sanity return here

Chris Haft

You freshmen and incoming
transfer students will be enter
ing a bom-again world of al
coholic bliss when you step into
Stanford Stadium's wooden
portals for your first football
game.
You innocent ones, God and
Andy Geiger willing, will never
have to endure the spiritual
famine that plagued Stanford
students last year when the in
famous "Bottle Ban" wreaked
its heinous havoc during gridi
ron gatherings.
For the uninformed, the De
partment of Athletics decided
in the summer of 1978 that bot
tles, cans, large containers and
alcoholic beverages would not
be allowed inside Stanford
Stadium.
Rationalizing their new rule,
the Athletic Department offi
cials claimed that violence at the
stadium must be curtailed.
Hell, the only fight 1 ever saw in
the stands at a football game
took place when some careless
soul left a fifth of Canadian
Club unattended.
Safety was another concern
the Department cited as a
reason for bringing the days of
Andrew Volstead back to Stan
ford Stadium. Bottles and cans,
the jock brass feared, could be
used as projectiles to be cast at
the participants or even at
others in the stands. But 1 ask,
who cares about bottles and
cans when you've got water bal
loons?

Living in nearby Menlo Park,
1 immediately learned of this
tragic, mindless decision. I
furiously sent telegrams and
made phone calls to my school
friends scattered around the
country. However, since many
of my school peers were
stationed in such exotic valhal
las as Minnetonka, Minnesota
and Mobile, Alabama, they
laughed at my importunings.
They were far removed from
the center of this debacle. Only
when they returned to Palo
Alto did they realize the horror
of it all.
Men and women clad from
head to toe in black, with hats
and bats reading "Stanford
Security Patrol," met us at the
gates of the stadium and kept a
sharp contact lens out for any
suspicious-looking containers.
While some students smuggled
in Nectarof Budweiser, orsome
such draught, other students
equated the guards with Cer
berus, the three-headed dog
who allegedly guards the entr
ance to Hades, and never at
tempted any covert act.
I, sniveling creature that I
was, fell into the latter category.
I and my fellow sheep subsisted
on overpriced cans of Pepsi and
"frozen" orange juice bars
(melt in your hand, not in your
mouth) while watching our
heroes — the Band and the
football team — perform.
The fraternity boys, of
course, used every ounce of

their prep-school given in
genuity. They always had their
booze. One fellow actually
performed a blood-for-Coors
transfusion minutes before kic
koff. Once inside the stadium,
this brave lad was steered into
the arms of several competent
pre-meds, who exchanged one
essential fluid for another.
Unfortunately, moments like
these were rare, and it's a shame
that the necessity arose for such
heroics to be performed.
The football season progres
sed and ended. Quarterback
Steve Dils set records and won
passing championships, we
mashed the Cal Weenies in the
Big Game again and surged
past Georgia in the Bluebonnet
Bowl, but the successful cam
paign still left many of us with a
thirsty feeling.
Every day, Old Union was be
seiged by students wanting to
transfer to a school with a
"wet" football stadium. The
rumble of discord grew louder
and more resonant than even
the rumblings in our empty
tummies during the football
games. Echoing a famous poet,
we cried, "Now is the winter of
our discontent!"
However, the good man
Geiger, freshly imported from
Pennsylvania as Stanford's
new athletic director, sensed
the strife spreading throughout
the campus. With a little prod
ding from those nonpareils in
the ASSU Senate, Geiger knew

what he had to do to restore
Stanford athletics to greatness.
Geiger realized that the stu
dents enjoy seeing two Darrin
Neisons scamper through de
fenses rather than one. As the
head man in sportsland, he had
to take firm action to keep the
youngsters in the proper frame
of mind to watch Stanford's
teams.
On Monday, May 14, 1979,
Geiger lifted the prohibition
against drinking alcoholic be
verages and carrying bottles,
cans or small receptacles into
Stanford Stadium.
"It's not up to the athletic di
rector to legislate morality,"
Geiger said as thousands cried,
"Amen!"
Pandemonium ensued. A
rush of "born-again" football
fans from the Palo Alto area
stormed the Athletic Ticket Of
fice for season tickets. Geiger's
photograph was framed, hung
and revered in every campus
dorm. Bacchanalian feasts were
held, symbolically, at the stu
dents' entrance to Stanford
Stadium. And of course, every
body was happy again.
The festive atmosphere at the
games, which never really left
and never will, is no longer
stifled bv a Simple Simon rule.
In all seriousness, being al
lowed to eet drunk isn't the is
sue. We just don't need surro
gate parents telling us what to
do while we're trying to have
fun. Thank you, Mr. Geiger.

Pennsylvania as Stanford's
new athletic director, sensed
the strife spreading throughout
the campus. With a little prod
ding from those nonpareils in
the ASSU Senate, Geiger knew

what he had to do to restore
Stanford athletics to greatness.
Geiger realized that the stu
dents enjoy seeing two Darrin
Neisons scamper through de
fenses rather than one. As the
head man in sportsland, he had
to take firm action to keep the
youngsters in the proper frame
of mind to watch Stanford's
teams.
On Monday, May 14, 1979,
Geiger lifted the prohibition
against drinking alcoholic be
verages and carrying bottles,
cans or small receptacles into
Stanford Stadium.
"It's not up to the athletic di
rector to legislate morality,"
Geiger said as thousands cried,
"Amen!"
Pandemonium ensued. A
rush of "born-again" football
fans from the Palo Alto area
stormed the Athletic Ticket Of
fice for season tickets. Geiger's
photograph was framed, hung
and revered in every campus
dorm. Bacchanalian feasts were
held, symbolically, at the stu
dents' entrance to Stanford
Stadium. And of course, every
body was happy again.
The festive atmosphere at the
games, which never really left
and never will, is no longer
stifled bv a Simple Simon rule.
In all seriousness, being al
lowed to eet drunk isn't the is
sue. We just don't need surro
gate parents telling us what to
do while we're trying to have
fun. Thank you, Mr. Geiger.

Now that the infamous "Bottle Ban" has been lifted from Stanford Stadium, more smiling youths,
such as this one, clutching containers of their favorite beverage should be seen in the stands.
Chris Haft

You freshmen and incoming
transfer students will be enter
ing a bom-again world of al
coholic bliss when you step into
Stanford Stadium's wooden
portals for your first football
game.
You innocent ones, God and
Andy Geiger willing, will never
have to endure the spiritual
famine that plagued Stanford
students last year when the in
famous "Bottle Ban" wreaked
its heinous havoc during gridi
ron gatherings.
For the uninformed, the De
partment of Athletics decided
in the summer of 1978 that bot
tles, cans, large containers and
alcoholic beverages would not
be allowed inside Stanford
Stadium.
Rationalizing their new rule,
the Athletic Department offi
cials claimed that violence at the
stadium must be curtailed.
Hell, the only fight 1 ever saw in
the stands at a football game
took place when some careless
soul left a fifth of Canadian
Club unattended.
Safety was another concern
the Department cited as a
reason for bringing the days of
Andrew Volstead back to Stan
ford Stadium. Bottles and cans,
the jock brass feared, could be
used as projectiles to be cast at
the participants or even at
others in the stands. But 1 ask,
who cares about bottles and
cans when you've got water bal
loons?

Living in nearby Menlo Park,
1 immediately learned of this
tragic, mindless decision. I
furiously sent telegrams and
made phone calls to my school
friends scattered around the
country. However, since many
of my school peers were
stationed in such exotic valhal
las as Minnetonka, Minnesota
and Mobile, Alabama, they
laughed at my importunings.
They were far removed from
the center of this debacle. Only
when they returned to Palo
Alto did they realize the horror
of it all.
Men and women clad from
head to toe in black, with hats
and bats reading "Stanford
Security Patrol," met us at the
gates of the stadium and kept a
sharp contact lens out for any
suspicious-looking containers.
While some students smuggled
in Nectarof Budweiser, orsome
such draught, other students
equated the guards with Cer
berus, the three-headed dog
who allegedly guards the entr
ance to Hades, and never at
tempted any covert act.
I, sniveling creature that I
was, fell into the latter category.
I and my fellow sheep subsisted
on overpriced cans of Pepsi and
"frozen" orange juice bars
(melt in your hand, not in your
mouth) while watching our
heroes — the Band and the
football team — perform.
The fraternity boys, of
course, used every ounce of

their prep-school given in
genuity. They always had their
booze. One fellow actually
performed a blood-for-Coors
transfusion minutes before kic
koff. Once inside the stadium,
this brave lad was steered into
the arms of several competent
pre-meds, who exchanged one
essential fluid for another.
Unfortunately, moments like
these were rare, and it's a shame
that the necessity arose for such
heroics to be performed.
The football season progres
sed and ended. Quarterback
Steve Dils set records and won
passing championships, we
mashed the Cal Weenies in the
Big Game again and surged
past Georgia in the Bluebonnet
Bowl, but the successful cam
paign still left many of us with a
thirsty feeling.
Every day, Old Union was be
seiged by students wanting to
transfer to a school with a
"wet" football stadium. The
rumble of discord grew louder
and more resonant than even
the rumblings in our empty
tummies during the football
games. Echoing a famous poet,
we cried, "Now is the winter of
our discontent!"
However, the good man
