Sophomore Jeanne Ruark established herself as the most destructive shooter in Stanford women's
basketball history, averaging close to 20 points a game. She and guard Angie Paccione form the
nucleus of what should be an outstanding team.
Lynn Keyser, a standout freshman last year for coach Barbara Longstreth's field hockey squad, will
help Stanford in its quest for AIAW supremacy.
Ted Rafalovich, who scored a school-record 28 goals a season ago, is back to terrorize Card soccer
oppoenents this fall. Though only a sophomore, Rafalovich is already approaching career Stanford
scoring records.
Not many teams catch PaulZuvella off base. The senior second baseman, Stanford's Most Valuable
Player and an AU-Pac-10 selection last season, spurned a lucrative pro offer to return to the Cards.
Doubtlessly the most dynamic performer in Stanford basketball history, Kimberly Belton will
stuff many more balls through the hoop in 1979-80. Belton earned Associated Press All-America
honorable mention notice last year by shooting .619 from the field for a school record.
Lloyd Bourne, Stanford's no. 2 singles player last year, joined the illustrious list of Card tennis
All-America selections. The experienced senior is one of several standout returnees for coach Dick
Gould.
One of the reasons for the Stanford women volleyballers' winning record last fall was Jan Linden's'
strong all-around play. A native of Los Angeles, sophomore Linden has already become one of the
most dependable Cards.
