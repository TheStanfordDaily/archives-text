# Campus facilities, IMs provide sporting fun
## 
### Rick Ostiller 
So, you were all-league in
high school, but can't make the
varsity at Stanford. That leaves
you two options: a) nerd out 16
hours a day, eating and sleep
ing away the rest of the time, or
b) participate in the numerous
non-varsity athletic and recrea
tional activities pursued on
campus.
Varsity sports are but a small
part of the athletic world at
Stanford. Intramural and club
sports, physical education clas
ses and recreational facilities all
await the athletic Stanford stu
dent.
The intramural program,
headed by former Stanford
basketball coach Howie
Dallmar, offers 33 All-
University sports, 21 all
women sports. The activities
change quarterly, with sports
ranging from such standards as
football, basketball and
to such novelties as ul
timate frisbee, foosball, and
inner tube water polo.
A complete list of autumn
sports, as well as scheduling
and sign-up information, will
appear in the Daily. The in
tramural office, located in En
cina Gym, will answer any
questions about the program.
Club sports provide intercol
legiate competition in several
sports which do not have var
sity status at Stanford. The list
of club sports includes rugby,
badminton, bowling, skiing
and ice hockey. The Athletic De
partment will provide further
information about the program.
Physical education classes
are extremely popular at Stan
ford, and consequently, one

cannot always get the classes
desired. Hundreds of courses,
for all levels of ability, are of
fered in sports, dancing and
aquatic activities, as well as in
structional classes in athletic
theories and techniques. Clas
ses which teach the nuances of
tennis, golf, basketball, soccer
and swimming, for example,
are among the quarterly offer
ings. A complete list of courses,
times, and meeting places will
appear in the Time Schedule,
and sign-ups will be held at re
gistration.
Those athletes interested in
less structured activities can
start their own games at the
numerous on-campus recrea
tional facilities open to stu
dents.
The deGuerre Pools will be
available Monday through Fri
day from noon to 2 p.m. and
from noon to 4 p.m. on
weekends, except for Satur
days of home football games,
when they will close. Roble
Pool will be open noon to 4:45
p.m. on Tuesday and Thurs
day, and noon to 1 and 3:15 to
4:15 p.m. on Monday, Wed
nesday and Friday. Student
I.D. s will be checked at both
pools.
(Listed open hours for all
facilities are subject to change
because of special events, class
changes and intramural
scheduling. Check individual
facilities for possible time
changes.)
The handball and squash
courts at the deGuerre complex
will be open 11 a.m. through 11
p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. on Saturday, and noon to
5 p.m. Sunday. Stanford I.D. is
required, and the courts get

crowde4so make reservations a
day in advance either by phone
or at the facility.
Maples Pavilion will have re
creational basketball Monday
through Friday from noon to 1
p.m., while Roble Gym will be
open forbasketball Saturday af
ternoons from 1 to 5 and Sun
days from 3 to 5. Identification
is required at Maples, but not at
Roble. Outdoor basketball en
thusiasts can often find a good
game at the courts located bet
ween Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The weight room at Encina
Gym will be open Monday
through Th ursday from noon to
2 and 3 to 6, Fridays from 4 to 6
p.m. and Saturdays from 10 to
noon. The weight room will be
closed Sundays. Students must
show I.D. to use the facility.
Tennis players can choose
from three sites on campus. The
Roble, Encina and Varsity
courts all have sign-up sheets
posted weekday mornings and
on Friday mornings for the
weekends, butP.E. classes limit
available court space. Netters
who would rather play at night
must venture to Palo Alto High
School or Rinconada Park on
Embarcadero Road, since none
of the campus courts have
lights.
Students who prefer spikes
to overheads can play volleyball
at Encina Monday through
Thursday from noon to 1 p.m.
and Friday through Sunday 1
p.m. until dark. There are also
several courts located near the
dormitories throughout the
campus.
Golfers can delight in the
challenging layout and bargain
deals offered at Stanford's

course. Golf Digest has rated the
course one of the 100 best in the
country, while green fees for
students are a paltry $3.75. In
addition, students can purch
ase a card good for 10 rounds
for $16.50. The pro shop will
answer questions about the
best times to get on the course.
The driving range, located next
to the golf course, is also availa
ble to students.
Jogging has probably become
the most popular sporting activ
ity at Stanford in recent years.
For those who enjoy running a
a track, Angell Field is always
available, and the tartan track at
the football stadium is open oc
casionally. For those who pre
fer a secenic run, myriad trails
in the foothills provide some
tremendous views of the Bay
Area.
For those who enjoy simply
romping around in the grass
with a football or frisbee, many
fields on campus await your
feet. Wilbur, Roble and Flor
ence Moore Halls all have ac
comodating fields nearby, and
the intramural fields near Stan
ford Stadium are available
whenever 1M games aren't
being played.
Students who feel like show
ering when they are through
working out can use the
facilities at Roble or Encina.
Roble stays open Monday
through Thursday until 10
p.m., Friday until 7 p.m. and
weekends until 5 p.m. Encina
closes at 9 p.m. during the week
and at 5 p.m. on Saturday and
Sunday. Students can obtain a
locker at both places, and the
University runs a towel service
at Encina.

One commodity the intramural office always needs is referees. Obviously, without officials the
games could not be played. IM referees earn a reasonable fee for each game they work, so consider
contacting the IM office for more information.

One commodity the intramural office always needs is referees. Obviously, without officials the
games could not be played. IM referees earn a reasonable fee for each game they work, so consider
contacting the IM office for more information.
So, you were all-league in
high school, but can't make the
varsity at Stanford. That leaves
you two options: a) nerd out 16
hours a day, eating and sleep
ing away the rest of the time, or
b) participate in the numerous
non-varsity athletic and recrea
tional activities pursued on
campus.
Varsity sports are but a small
part of the athletic world at
Stanford. Intramural and club
sports, physical education clas
ses and recreational facilities all
await the athletic Stanford stu
dent.
The intramural program,
headed by former Stanford
basketball coach Howie
Dallmar, offers 33 All-
University sports, 21 all
women sports. The activities
change quarterly, with sports
ranging from such standards as
football, basketball and
to such novelties as ul
timate frisbee, foosball, and
inner tube water polo.
A complete list of autumn
sports, as well as scheduling
and sign-up information, will
appear in the Daily. The in
tramural office, located in En
cina Gym, will answer any
questions about the program.
Club sports provide intercol
legiate competition in several
sports which do not have var
sity status at Stanford. The list
of club sports includes rugby,
badminton, bowling, skiing
and ice hockey. The Athletic De
partment will provide further
information about the program.
Physical education classes
are extremely popular at Stan
ford, and consequently, one

cannot always get the classes
desired. Hundreds of courses,
for all levels of ability, are of
fered in sports, dancing and
aquatic activities, as well as in
structional classes in athletic
theories and techniques. Clas
ses which teach the nuances of
tennis, golf, basketball, soccer
and swimming, for example,
are among the quarterly offer
ings. A complete list of courses,
times, and meeting places will
appear in the Time Schedule,
and sign-ups will be held at re
gistration.
Those athletes interested in
less structured activities can
start their own games at the
numerous on-campus recrea
tional facilities open to stu
dents.
