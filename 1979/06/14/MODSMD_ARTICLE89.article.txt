(Editor's note: The following in
troduction to the Leland Stanford
lunior University Marching Band
was written, edited and com filed
by a public relations lackey of that
organization.)
Until 1963, the Band was
strictly normal. They marched
in straight lines, they kept the
insides of their left feet on the
outer right edge of the hash
marks, the drum section wore
clothes like everybody else, and
nobody painted anything in
suiting on the bells of the tubas.
In short, they did everything
correctly, and were accorded
due respect. No one wrote hate
mail, no one threatened to
bulldoze the University, and no
one withdrew multi-million
dollar contributions already
earmarked for the medical
school. The LSJUMB was a class
organization at that time
they were a class organization
and a credit to undergraduate
education.
But everything changed in
'63. In '63 the Band was taken
over by zealots and hoodlums,
and by an occasional musician.
They went on strike at the be
ginning of the football season,
and the University threatened
initially to put the whole crew
to work in nearby coal mines,

but the zealots stuck by their
guns until the authorities sub
mitted.
And now there are no
straight lines. There are no dis
appearing diamonds. We do
not play the theme from
"Rocky," or the theme from
"Star Wars." We do not play
"You Light Up My Life." Every
thing we do is sick, nothing we
do is tasteful, and some of us
drink and stay out doing Cod
knows what until very late at
night. We go on trips, and we
do rallies late at night that keep
people out ot law school. We go
to the Rose Bowl once or twice
every several hundred years,
we make loud noises when you
least expect it, and we hate
USC, and we hate Cal.
We believe that you have sec
ret unfulfilled desires, that cer
tain things in life are very em
barrassing, and that justice is a
kick in the groin. Remember
when you woke up, sweating in
the night, do you think that no
one heard you scream? When
you turned your back on the
poor and oppressed, are you
sure that no one saw? You
probably thought you were es
caping those things when you
came to Stanford, didn't you?
You thought that no one would

catch on to your little fetishes,
your little whims, your little
sicknesses. You did, didn t
you?
Think again, Jack. We know
who you are. V\ e know all
about what vou've done, and
where you've been, and next
Saturday we're going to put it
on the field in front of 50,000
people. You won't torget lis.

your little whims, your little sicknesses. You did, didn't vou?"

" . . . and nobody painted anything insulting on the bells of the tubas."
