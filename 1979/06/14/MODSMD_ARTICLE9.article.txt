# Luncheon registration
## 
### 
Persons planning to at
tend the Class Day Lunc
heon Saturday at Bowman
Alumni House Grove
should be advised that
lengthy lines will greet them
at the luncheon due to
scheduling of the event im
mediately after the Bac
calaureate Service.
Senior Class President
Tony Peet said there were
many good reasons for mov
ing the service to the morn
ing just before the luncheon,
but the scheduling will re
sult in congestion at registra
tion desks at the luncheon.
Peet suggested that
families not planning to at
tend the Baccalaureate could
help luncheon organizers by
arriving early, meaning by
11:15 a.m.
