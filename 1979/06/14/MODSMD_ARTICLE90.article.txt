# The 						Big Leagues in the Bay Area
## 
### 
The professional sporting
enthusiast coming to Stan
ford has several oppor
tunities to watch big league
athletics throughout the
year, if he or she has suffi
cient transportation and
funds.
The two local pro football
teams charge an arm and a
leg for admission (they need
the limbs to repair their in
jured players with), so in
most cases you are better off
watching television.
However, if the roar of the
arena intoxicates you, the
San Francisco 49ers, who
play at Candlestick Park (30
minutes away from Stanford
via Highway 101), will admit
you for $10, $9 or $5. Unless
the Niners go on a big win
ning streak — a highly un
likely prospect — tickets will
be easy to obtain, either at
Candlestick (in advance or
on game day) or at the Nin

ers' downtown office at 1255
Post St. in San Francisco.
Tickets to Oakland Raider
games, meanwhile, are har
der to get. Not only are they
higher-priced — $12.50,
$11.50 and $8.50 — but there
is only a limited number of
seats available for each
game, and tickets are sold
only in advance, on the
Monday three weeks before
the game you wish to see.
For example, if you wanted
to watch Oakland play on
October 28, you would have
to buy tickets on October 8.
The Raiders play at the
Oakland-Alameda County
Coliseum, located across the
bay off Highway 17. Tickets
are available at the Raider of
fices across the freeway from
the Coliseum.
The Golden State War
riors of the National Basket
ball Association have not yet
announced their ticket

prices for the 1979-80 sea
son, but chances are that
they will be set at $10, $8, $7,
$6 and $5. As you can guess,
the lower-priced seats give
you an undesirable sky-high
vantage point. Like the
Raiders, the Warriors also
play in the Coliseum com
plex at the Arena.
A new pro basketball team
will be starting its first year
of operation — the San Fran
cisco Pioneers of a women's
basketball league. The
Pioneers play at San Francis
co's Civic Auditorium and
will open their season in
mid-November. The Civic
seats just over 7000, so no
seat should really be bad.
Tickets are $7, $5 and $3.
South of The Farm lies San
Jose and two more pro
sports organizations. One is
the San Jose Earthquakes of
the North American Soccer

League. The Quakes, who
play at Spartan Stadium,
used to sell out every home
game, but recent years have
brought the Quakes more
defeats and, therefore, smal
ler crowds. The season lasts
from late March or early
April until August, and tic
kets cost $8 for midfield, $6
for sideline seats and $4 for
children's sideline seats.
The other team in San Jose
calls itself the Diablos and
plays pro volleyball. Their
campaign commences in
May and lasts through Au
gust. The Diablos, whose
home is San Jose Civic Au
ditorium, charge $4.75,
$4.25 and $3.50 for seats.
If you want to catch a
baseball game late this sea
son or next year, the San
Francisco Giants and Oak
land A's will be happy to
have you. Giants' prices,
which mav rise in 1980, are

$5 for box seats, $4 for re
served seats and just $1 for
general admission
(bleachers). The A's charge
similar prices for their games
at the Oakland Coliseum:
$5, $1 and $2.
The food served at each
park is, without exception,
overpriced. At most places it
is below average. Candles
tick probably offers the best
ballpark cuisine in the Bay
Area, with a menu including
Polish sausages,. hambur
gers, fresh popcorn, frozen
yogurt, pizza and soft pre
tzels.
Concessions at the San
Jose arenas are adequate,
which is more than can be
said for the swill they put out
at the Oakland Coliseum.
There, the popcorn is almost
always stale, the hot dogs
are distasteful and the Polish
sausages are petrified.
