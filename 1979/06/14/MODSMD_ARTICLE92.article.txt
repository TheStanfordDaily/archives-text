# CAMPUS
## Distinguished performers grace Lively Arts' season 
### 
The Lively Arts at Stanford
celebrates its Tenth Anniver
sary this 1979-80 season, and
they hope to make it a very spe
cial year for everyone in the
Stanford community.
"We have booked a season
which reflects the quality that
has come to distinguish our
performing arts presenta
tions," says Vicky Holt, Direc
tor o f the Office of Public
Events, of which Lively Arts is a
part.
The schedule of concerts and
performers combines those that
have become "Stanford
favorites" — groups such as
the Guarneri String Quartet
and Music from Marlboro —
with a fine variety of artists and
programs new to Stanford au
diences.
The series of programs for
this fall will begin with the San
Francisco Symphony on Oc
tober 7. Conducted by Ale
xander Schneider, with guest
soloist Richard Stoltzman play
ing clarinet, the concert will be
held outdoors in Frost Am
phitheater at 4 p.m.
Next will be ragtime music
with the New England Conser
vatory Ragtime Ensemble.
Gunther Schuller will conduct
this award-winning group in its
performance of ragtime pieces
by Joplin, Morton, Marshall
and Hampton. The concert will
be held in Memorial Au
ditorium on Friday, October 12
at 8 p.m.
Violinist Ida Kavafian, a
member of the renowned
chamber group, TASHI, will
perform in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium on Tuesday, October
16 at 8 p.m.
Dance workshops
Of special interst to dance en
thusiasts this fall will be the The
Bella Lewitzky Dance Com
pany's four-day residency
scheduled for October. The
company will hold a workshop
for Palo Alto Unified School
District dance students and

teachers and a master class in
dance for Stanford students.
The company will then per
form Friday, October 19 at 8
p.m. in Mem Aud.
The twelve member group
has been hailed by the press for
its technically formidable,
exuberant and sensitive per
formances, and it has achieved
international acclaim for its in
novative and individualistic
choreography. The group has a
unique style that reflects the
company's California base and
that amplifies the tradition that

California is the fountainhead
of some of the strongest indi
genous influences in American
dance.
Eloquent clarinet
Clarinetist Richard
Stoltzman will return to give a
concert of his own on October
23. Accompanied by pianist/
bassoonist Bill Douglas, he will
perform at 8 p.m. in Din
kelspiel.
Well on his way to establish
ing the clarinet as an eloquent
solo instrument, Stoltzman's
playing has been described in
Time magazine as mimicking
"the fluttery delicacy of a flute,
the finespun song of a violin, a
bassoon's dark, melancholy
air."
Sopranist Elly Ameling, who
joined the Lively Arts for their
very first season, will sing Fri
day, October 26 at 8 p.m., in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
A most unusual musical
group coming to Stanford this
fall is Sour Cream — Frans
Brueggen's avante garde recor
der trio. Sour Cream had its in
ception at the Royal Conservat
ory, The Hague, and now
Brueggen and two former stu
dents, Kees Bocke and Walter
Van Hauwe, strive to dissociate
the recorder ensemble from its
old, somewhat romantic mold.
Presenting programs which in
tegrate theater and electronics,
Sour Cream will perform in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 2:30
p.m., Sunday October 28.
Baroque trumpet
Edward Tarr, one of the
world's leading trumpet sol
oists and an expert on baroque
trumpet repertory, and George
Kent, organist and conductor,
will perform in Memorial
Church on Friday, November 2
at 8 p.m. These artists have es
tablished a world-wide reputa
tion with their extraordinary
performances and recordings of
baroque and contemporary
music.
The Guarneri String Quartet,
called "the great American

quartet of the era" by The New
Yorker, returns to the campus
for its traditional three-concert
series in November, on the 6th
and the 9th at 8 p.m., and on
the 11th at 2:30 p.m. All per
formances will be in Din
kelspiel. The group has been
performing at Stanford every
year since 1970.
Tuckwell's return
Barry Tuckwell's return to
Stanford for a solo recital per
formance will close the series
for the fall quarter. Tuckwell is

the foremost living master of
the French horn, and he will
perform on Tuesday,
November 13 at 8 p.m. in Din
kelspiel.
Looking farther ahead into
the season, Lively Arts this year
also will include the New York
Chamber Soloists, Joffrey 11,
The Acting Company, Gary
Karr and Harmon Lewis,
Sonny Rollins, The Repertory
Dance Theater, the Waverly
Consort, Pete Seeger and
Odetta, Ruby Dee and Ossie
Davis, and the Amadeus String
Quartet.
Retrospective
A tenth anniversary deserves
some retrospective attention.
The goal of Lively Arts is to en
hance and enrich both the edu
cational experience of the Uni
versity's students and the cul
tural life of the surrounding
communities.
Lively Arts traces its roots
to the Stanford Summer Festi
val, which brought, among
others, the Joffrey Ballet, the
New York Pro Musica and the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band to
Frost Amphitheater between
1965 and 1969.
When the summer festival
ended, the University estab
lished the Office of Public
Events, and Tom Bacchetti was
chosen as its first director. He
launched the Lively Arts prog
ram that, with its mixture of
dance, theater, chamber music
and soloists, is reflected in this
year's series of 36 events.
Young artists
In 1973, Lively Arts pre
sented its first Young Concert
Artists series, intended to give
talented, young, unknown ar
tists well-deserved exposure.
These artists usually spend a
few days on campus, playing in
the dorms and visiting with
students.
The success of this program
led to the current Community
Outreach Program, which was
launched in 1977, when Lively
Arts received a grant from the
San Francisco Foundation. The

sponsorship has enabled Lively
Arts to schedule programs
aimed primarily at senior citi
zens and school children in
nearby communities. This year,
19 presentations are planned
for schools on the Peninsula.
Among the performers ex
pected to participate are the
New York Chamber Soloists;
the recorder trio, Sour Cream;
clarinetist Richard Stoltzman;
The Waverly Consort; flamenco
guitarist Ronald Radford; and
the chamber group
TASHI.

Retrospective
A tenth anniversary deserves
some retrospective attention.
The goal of Lively Arts is to en
hance and enrich both the edu
cational experience of the Uni
versity's students and the cul
tural life of the surrounding
communities.
Lively Arts traces its roots
to the Stanford Summer Festi
val, which brought, among
others, the Joffrey Ballet, the
New York Pro Musica and the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band to
Frost Amphitheater between
1965 and 1969.
When the summer festival
ended, the University estab
lished the Office of Public
Events, and Tom Bacchetti was
chosen as its first director. He
launched the Lively Arts prog
ram that, with its mixture of
dance, theater, chamber music
and soloists, is reflected in this
year's series of 36 events.
Young artists
In 1973, Lively Arts pre
sented its first Young Concert
Artists series, intended to give
talented, young, unknown ar
tists well-deserved exposure.
These artists usually spend a
few days on campus, playing in
the dorms and visiting with
students.
The success of this program
led to the current Community
Outreach Program, which was
launched in 1977, when Lively
Arts received a grant from the
San Francisco Foundation. The

sponsorship has enabled Lively
Arts to schedule programs
aimed primarily at senior citi
zens and school children in
nearby communities. This year,
19 presentations are planned
for schools on the Peninsula.
Among the performers ex
pected to participate are the
New York Chamber Soloists;
the recorder trio, Sour Cream;
clarinetist Richard Stoltzman;
The Waverly Consort; flamenco
guitarist Ronald Radford; and
the chamber group
TASHI.

The Lively Arts at Stanford
celebrates its Tenth Anniver
sary this 1979-80 season, and
they hope to make it a very spe
cial year for everyone in the
Stanford community.
"We have booked a season
which reflects the quality that
has come to distinguish our
performing arts presenta
tions," says Vicky Holt, Direc
tor o f the Office of Public
Events, of which Lively Arts is a
part.
The schedule of concerts and
performers combines those that
have become "Stanford
favorites" — groups such as
the Guarneri String Quartet
and Music from Marlboro —
with a fine variety of artists and
programs new to Stanford au
diences.
The series of programs for
this fall will begin with the San
Francisco Symphony on Oc
tober 7. Conducted by Ale
xander Schneider, with guest
soloist Richard Stoltzman play
ing clarinet, the concert will be
held outdoors in Frost Am
phitheater at 4 p.m.
Next will be ragtime music
with the New England Conser
vatory Ragtime Ensemble.
Gunther Schuller will conduct
this award-winning group in its
performance of ragtime pieces
by Joplin, Morton, Marshall
and Hampton. The concert will
be held in Memorial Au
ditorium on Friday, October 12
at 8 p.m.
Violinist Ida Kavafian, a
member of the renowned
chamber group, TASHI, will
perform in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium on Tuesday, October
16 at 8 p.m.
Dance workshops
Of special interst to dance en
thusiasts this fall will be the The
Bella Lewitzky Dance Com
pany's four-day residency
scheduled for October. The
company will hold a workshop
for Palo Alto Unified School
District dance students and

teachers and a master class in
dance for Stanford students.
The company will then per
form Friday, October 19 at 8
p.m. in Mem Aud.
The twelve member group
has been hailed by the press for
its technically formidable,
exuberant and sensitive per
formances, and it has achieved
international acclaim for its in
novative and individualistic
choreography. The group has a
unique style that reflects the
company's California base and
that amplifies the tradition that

California is the fountainhead
of some of the strongest indi
genous influences in American
dance.
Eloquent clarinet
Clarinetist Richard
Stoltzman will return to give a
concert of his own on October
23. Accompanied by pianist/
bassoonist Bill Douglas, he will
perform at 8 p.m. in Din
kelspiel.
Well on his way to establish
ing the clarinet as an eloquent
solo instrument, Stoltzman's
playing has been described in
Time magazine as mimicking
"the fluttery delicacy of a flute,
the finespun song of a violin, a
bassoon's dark, melancholy
air."
Sopranist Elly Ameling, who
joined the Lively Arts for their
very first season, will sing Fri
day, October 26 at 8 p.m., in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

In 1973, Lively Arts pre
sented its first Young Concert
Artists series, intended to give
talented, young, unknown ar
tists well-deserved exposure.
These artists usually spend a
few days on campus, playing in
the dorms and visiting with
students.
The success of this program
led to the current Community
Outreach Program, which was
launched in 1977, when Lively
Arts received a grant from the
San Francisco Foundation. The

sponsorship has enabled Lively
Arts to schedule programs
aimed primarily at senior citi
zens and school children in
nearby communities. This year,
19 presentations are planned
for schools on the Peninsula.
Among the performers ex
pected to participate are the
New York Chamber Soloists;
the recorder trio, Sour Cream;
clarinetist Richard Stoltzman;
The Waverly Consort; flamenco
guitarist Ronald Radford; and
the chamber group
TASHI.
