# The 						Sunday Flicks: a campus ritual
## 
### Julie Ericksen 
It doesn't take long for Stan
ford students to become
aquainted with a long-time
favorite campus tradition: the
ASSU Sunday Flicks in Mem
Aud.
Whether they have just spent
a weekend of hard partying or
are preparing fora week of hard
mid-terms, students find the
time to take in a movie on Sun
day night.

For most, the problem is not
so much finding time for the
movie, but finding thebesf time.
The classic dilemma; whether
'tis better to go to the early
show and finish reading those
chapters afterwards, ortostudv
double-time before the picture
and then blow off the rest of tht
night...
Financed with student funds
Memorial Auditorium was orig
inally built as a theater for stu

dent use, and, soon after its
completion, the first film series
started off on October 31,1937.
The flick: All Quiet on the Wes
ter Front. Admission: 15 cents.
The next year, the price was
raised to 20 cents, and seven
films were scheduled through
the winter and spring of 1938-
39. It was during this year that
the series was first called the
Sunday Night Movies.
Today, the Sunday Flicks av
erages 12 films per quarter; in
1978-79, a total of 42 movies
were shown.
According to Ferrill Roll, this
year's manager of the ASSU
Sunday Flicks, 1500-1700 stu
dents attend the two shows on
a good night.
Pulled out of a two year fi
nancial slump last year by man
ager Jay Roach, the Flicks is fis
cally sound—and Roll hopes to
keep it that way.
"You have to have a solid
schedule," Roll said. Films
must be shown guaged "by
what people 1 know are in
terested in.
"We try to get movies that the
most people want to see," Roll
added. "Some of the most suc
cess this last year was with 'col
lege classics' from other years,
such as Clockwork Orange,
Catch-22, Last Tango in Paris,
and Paper Chase.
"Those films tend to be
slightly cheaper because
they're older," Roll said.
Sunday Flicks usually pays
the film distributor a percen
tage or a guaranteed rate,
whichever is greater, of a
show's take. The guarantee is
much lower on the older "clas
sics," making them a treat for
Sunday Flicks' budget, as well
as old-film buffs.

This fall, the line-up will
open Sept. 23 with the hit sci-fi
film, Close Encounters of the Third
Kind. After that, An Unmarried
Woman will be shown on Thurs
day night, Sept. 27, so that Rosh
Hashanna services may be held
in Mem Aud on Sept 30.
Then the Sunday night line
up will run something like this:
Heaven Can Wait, Autumn
Sonata, Norma Rae, Invasion of
the Body Snatchers, Midnight Ex
press, The Buddy Holly Story,
Days of Heaven, Jaws and Harold
and Maude. Specific dates and
times will be available on the
fliers in reg. packs and will be
posted around campus and an
nounced in the Daily.The
schedule, Roll said, is "proba
bly one of the best in recent
years," and it is because, he ad
ded, "the industry's putting
out a lot of new films."
Roll said that the season pass,
which entitles holders to take
seats before single movie ticket
holders, will be $8.50. Admis
sion to a single movie will again
be $1.00.
We're basically just a student
service—we're not out to make
money," Roll asserted. "So as
long as people come to shows,
we'll keep showing 'em at a
buck."
A big factor in maintaining
the financial success of the
Sunday Ficks is the success the
manager has in holding down
expenses. Roll is asking for help
in keeping the lid on one big
cost—custodial services. This
year, for the first time, Roll is
putting recycling bins in the
auditorium, so that patrons
may dispose of their cups,
wrappers and paper airplanes.
