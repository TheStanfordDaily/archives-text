### 
Where can 1 get tickets?
This good question has a
good answer: Tresidder Tic
ket Office, a University
subsidized service to the
community.
Located on the second
level of Tresidder Union,
next to Wells Fargo Bank,
the ticket service has ducats
for nearly all campus and
Bay Area events — and if
they don't have them, they'll
try their best to find out who
does.
Campus groups such as
The Lively Arts, Special
Events and the Music and
Drama Departments all use
Tresidder Ticket Office as
their major ticket outlet —
and they often offer through
them some good student
discounts. The Lively Arts,
for example,has student dis
counts. The Lively Arts, for
example has student ticket
prices at up to 50 percent off

the general admission.
The Ticket Office itself
has the convenient policy of
selling for campus events
two student-priced tickets
for every one student I.D.
card presented.
The Ticket Office also has
a Ticketron outlet — a major
computerized ticket agency
in California, which brings
most major Bay Area sports
events, shows and concerts
within easy reach of Stan
ford ticket-buyers. Ticketron
also sells tickets to tours of
Hearst Castle at San Simeon
and campsite reservations
for many California State
pa rks.
As for the San Francisco
Symphony, Ballet and Op
era, as well as the American
Conservatory Theatre, tic
kets for all are available
through the Ticket Office's
voucher system.
