# Theater groups bring variety to stage
## 
### Julie Erickson "Something for everyone" 
the saying goes, and once
again it holds true for drama at
Stanford, as the University's
three m«' jor theater groups pre
pare for the 1979-80 season.
Ihe Stanford Drama De
partment will offer both tradi
tional and modern experimen
tal plays. Ram's Head will bring
original and Broadway musi
cals to the stage of Memorial
Auditorium in the fall and
spring, and, also in the fall and
spring, the Stanford Savoyards
will present the light, comic
opera of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Drama Department
Every year, the Department
of Drama presents three full
length plays—one each
quarter —in the Little Theater
next to Memorial Auditorium.
This fall's major production,

Erasmus Mmtanus, will be di
rected by the Danish profes
sional director and actor, Fritz
Drun, who is currently a third
year doctoral student in the
Drama Dept.
Written in 172.3 by Denmark's
leading classical playwright,
Ludvig Holberg, the comedy
will serve .is A >alute from
ford to Holberg s University of
Copenhagen, which this year
celebrates its 500 th anniver
sary.
Holberg spent most of his life
as a professor at the University
of Copenhagen, and his many
works have given Denmark a
native drama of international
stature. Dramatists believe that
Holberg is one of Scandanavia's
greatest playwrights, ranking
with rbsen and Strindberg.
In the play, a young man,
Rasmus Berg, returns to his
farming village after his first
year at the university, ridicul
ously proud of his newly
gained academic knowledge.
Though Rasmus speaks Latin
and goes about spouting syl
logisms, it is apparent he lacks
wisdom and sensitivity and is
naive about everyday life.
As he confronts the villagers
and their common sense, the
play pokes fun at the stuffy
academic character, while
dramatizing the conflict bet
ween academic theory and
everyday knowledge.

Erasmus Montanus thus prot
raysa very real problem that we
face today —keeping the lines of
communication open between
academics and laymen—and
remains a classic that is relevant
and open to new interpreta
tions.
Plans for this winter and
spring's major productions
have not yet been confirmed,
but they should be announced
early in the autumn quarter.
The roles in Drama Dept.
productions are open to the
Stanford community, for those
who prefer to appear on stage.
Audition announcements are
announced on fliers around
campus and in the Daily, and
preference is always given to
students.
Auditions for Erasmus Mon
tanus will be held on September
24 and 25, registration days, at

7:30 p.m. in the Little Theater.
In addition to the quarterly
plays put on in the Little Thea
ter, the department's
Graduate Directing Workshop
presents more experimental
drama in the Niterv (in the Old
Union). Second year grad
students direct these one-act
plays, to which admission is
free. For auditions, watch Once
Around the Quad.
This year, too, first year
grads, encouraged by the
favorable reaction received last
year, may open their one-acts
to the public. These produc
tions are staged in the depart
ment's studio theater, room
205.
Altogether, the Drama Dept.
provides an impressive range of
productions. Lee Fisher, the
department's publicity direc
tor, told the Daily , "We try to
do a season that will give the
community a variety of plays."
She urges students to take
advantage of the department
and to get involved in one or
more of the courses offered—
including set, costume, lighting
design and all levels of acting.
"A lot of non-drama students
take acting," Fischer said. "It is
an enriching experience, and
they learn a lot about them
selves."
Ram's Head
Ram's Head is a group of very
talented singing, dancing and

acting students who love no
thing more than to put on a
good show. Almost invariably,
they do.
Each year, Ram's Head
stages two musicals: in the
fall, Gaities, a show written,
composed, choreographed,
produced and directed by stu
dents, and in the spring, a
major Broadway musical.
This year's Gaities staff has
been working since last March,
and they will stage their pro
duction during Big Game week,
on November 15 and 16 in Mem
Aud.
A revived Stanford tradition
that is now in its third year, the
production of Gaities has been
very popular on campus and it
is definitely a show that
everyone here should see.
The producer for this year's
show is Lisa Erickson, and the
director is Terry Ross.
Auditions—open to all
students—will be held on Oc
tober 2 and 3 in Mem Aud at 7
p.m. Eric Hoit, a member of
Ram's Head, said that the prep
arations and rehearsals are
fast-paced, and intensive—but,
he added, the rewards are high.
"The greatest thing is the feel
ing you get from working so
closely with eberyone on the
show," he said.
The Broadway musicals that
Ram's Head has produced in
recent years have included Fid
dler on the Roof, Music Man, and
Kiss Me Kate. The musical for
this spring has not yet been
selected but should be an
nounced in the near future.
Producer Scott Buchanon
and director Jodi Corwin plan
to stage the show between
April 23 and 26 and to hold au
ditions the first weekend in
January. An information meet
ing might be held in early De
cember.
MarkSwanson will direct the
music for both Gaities and the
Spring Show.
Ram's Head also has a small
group of performers who like to
put on informal musical revues
for alums, groups at Tresidder
and the like. Keep an eye out for
them during Orientation Week;
they're great.
And, like the Drama Dept.,
Ram's Head can "always use a
lot of new people," as Hoit said,
for the big productions. "We
don't require a lot of
background talent," he added,
just a lot of enthusiasm.
Interested students are in
vited to visit Ram's Head's of
fice in the Old Firehouse.
Savoyards
The Stanford Savoyards area
bit more specialized in their
dramatic productions, as they
perform almost exclusively Gil
bert and Sullivan operettas.
An informal organization of

students, faculty, staff, alumni
and friends of the University,
the Savoyards are now in their
seventh season. They have
chosen The Mikado for their fall
production this year, which will
be presented November 14-18
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Performances will be at 8
p.m. except for the evening of
f he 15th, when the show will
start at 9 p.m. Tickets are
$3.50 general and $1.50 for stu
dents. Auditions will be held
Sept. 24 and 25.
In the spring, the Savoyards
will stage Ruddigore on May 3,4,
9, 10, and 11, again in Din
kelspiel.
The Savoyards accept appli
cations for stage and music di
rectors, set and lighting desig
ners, stage and house mana
gers and properties and make
up artists. For more informa
tion, call Bonnie at 497-3381 or
Rita Taylor at 321 -5431.

original and Broadway musi

spring, the Stanford Savoyards
will present the light, comic
opera of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Drama Department
Every year, the Department
of Drama presents three full
length plays—one each
quarter —in the Little Theater
next to Memorial Auditorium.
This fall's major production,

Erasmus Mmtanus, will be di
rected by the Danish profes
sional director and actor, Fritz
Drun, who is currently a third
year doctoral student in the
Drama Dept.
Written in 172.3 by Denmark's
leading classical playwright,
Ludvig Holberg, the comedy
will serve .is A >alute from
ford to Holberg s University of
Copenhagen, which this year
celebrates its 500 th anniver

as a professor at the University
of Copenhagen, and his many
works have given Denmark a
native drama of international

Holberg is one of Scandanavia's
greatest playwrights, ranking

Though Rasmus speaks Latin

wisdom and sensitivity and is
naive about everyday life.
As he confronts the villagers
and their common sense, the
play pokes fun at the stuffy
academic character, while
dramatizing the conflict bet

everyday knowledge.

Erasmus Montanus thus prot
raysa very real problem that we
face today —keeping the lines of
communication open between
academics and laymen—and
remains a classic that is relevant
and open to new interpreta
tions.
Plans for this winter and
spring's major productions
have not yet been confirmed,
but they should be announced
early in the autumn quarter.
The roles in Drama Dept.
productions are open to the
Stanford community, for those
who prefer to appear on stage.
Audition announcements are
announced on fliers around
campus and in the Daily, and
preference is always given to
students.
Auditions for Erasmus Mon
tanus will be held on September
24 and 25, registration days, at

7:30 p.m. in the Little Theater.
In addition to the quarterly
plays put on in the Little Thea
ter, the department's
Graduate Directing Workshop
presents more experimental
drama in the Niterv (in the Old
Union). Second year grad
students direct these one-act
plays, to which admission is
free. For auditions, watch Once
Around the Quad.
This year, too, first year
grads, encouraged by the
favorable reaction received last
year, may open their one-acts
to the public. These produc
tions are staged in the depart
ment's studio theater, room
205.
Altogether, the Drama Dept.
provides an impressive range of
productions. Lee Fisher, the
department's publicity direc

do a season that will give the
community a variety of plays."
She urges students to take

and to get involved in one or

including set, costume, lighting
design and all levels of acting.
"A lot of non-drama students

an enriching experience, and
they learn a lot about them

Ram's Head
Ram's Head is a group of very
talented singing, dancing and

acting students who love no
thing more than to put on a
good show. Almost invariably,
they do.
Each year, Ram's Head
stages two musicals: in the
fall, Gaities, a show written,
composed, choreographed,
produced and directed by stu
dents, and in the spring, a
major Broadway musical.
This year's Gaities staff has
been working since last March,
and they will stage their pro
duction during Big Game week,
on November 15 and 16 in Mem
Aud.
A revived Stanford tradition
that is now in its third year, the
production of Gaities has been
very popular on campus and it
is definitely a show that
everyone here should see.
The producer for this year's
show is Lisa Erickson, and the
director is Terry Ross.
Auditions—open to all
students—will be held on Oc
tober 2 and 3 in Mem Aud at 7
p.m. Eric Hoit, a member of
Ram's Head, said that the prep
arations and rehearsals are
fast-paced, and intensive—but,
he added, the rewards are high.
"The greatest thing is the feel
ing you get from working so
closely with eberyone on the
show," he said.
The Broadway musicals that
Ram's Head has produced in
recent years have included Fid
dler on the Roof, Music Man, and
Kiss Me Kate. The musical for
this spring has not yet been
selected but should be an
nounced in the near future.
Producer Scott Buchanon
and director Jodi Corwin plan
to stage the show between
April 23 and 26 and to hold au
ditions the first weekend in
January. An information meet
ing might be held in early De
cember.
MarkSwanson will direct the
music for both Gaities and the
Spring Show.
Ram's Head also has a small
group of performers who like to
put on informal musical revues
for alums, groups at Tresidder
and the like. Keep an eye out for
them during Orientation Week;
they're great.
And, like the Drama Dept.,
Ram's Head can "always use a
lot of new people," as Hoit said,
for the big productions. "We
don't require a lot of
background talent," he added,
just a lot of enthusiasm.
Interested students are in

produced and directed by stu
dents, and in the spring, a
major Broadway musical.
This year's Gaities staff has
been working since last March,
and they will stage their pro
duction during Big Game week,
on November 15 and 16 in Mem
Aud.
A revived Stanford tradition
that is now in its third year, the
production of Gaities has been
very popular on campus and it
is definitely a show that
everyone here should see.
The producer for this year's
show is Lisa Erickson, and the
director is Terry Ross.
Auditions—open to all
students—will be held on Oc
tober 2 and 3 in Mem Aud at 7
p.m. Eric Hoit, a member of
Ram's Head, said that the prep
arations and rehearsals are
fast-paced, and intensive—but,
he added, the rewards are high.
"The greatest thing is the feel
ing you get from working so
closely with eberyone on the
show," he said.
The Broadway musicals that
Ram's Head has produced in
recent years have included Fid
dler on the Roof, Music Man, and
Kiss Me Kate. The musical for
this spring has not yet been
selected but should be an
nounced in the near future.
Producer Scott Buchanon
and director Jodi Corwin plan
to stage the show between
April 23 and 26 and to hold au
ditions the first weekend in
January. An information meet
ing might be held in early De
cember.
MarkSwanson will direct the
music for both Gaities and the
Spring Show.
Ram's Head also has a small
group of performers who like to
put on informal musical revues
for alums, groups at Tresidder
and the like. Keep an eye out for
them during Orientation Week;
they're great.
And, like the Drama Dept.,
Ram's Head can "always use a
lot of new people," as Hoit said,
for the big productions. "We
don't require a lot of
background talent," he added,
just a lot of enthusiasm.
Interested students are in
vited to visit Ram's Head's of
fice in the Old Firehouse.
Savoyards
The Stanford Savoyards area
bit more specialized in their
dramatic productions, as they
perform almost exclusively Gil
bert and Sullivan operettas.
An informal organization of

students, faculty, staff, alumni
and friends of the University,
the Savoyards are now in their
seventh season. They have
chosen The Mikado for their fall
production this year, which will
be presented November 14-18
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Performances will be at 8
p.m. except for the evening of
f he 15th, when the show will
start at 9 p.m. Tickets are
$3.50 general and $1.50 for stu
dents. Auditions will be held
Sept. 24 and 25.
In the spring, the Savoyards
will stage Ruddigore on May 3,4,
9, 10, and 11, again in Din
kelspiel.
The Savoyards accept appli
cations for stage and music di
rectors, set and lighting desig
ners, stage and house mana
gers and properties and make
up artists. For more informa
tion, call Bonnie at 497-3381 or

Undergraduates Pamela Minet, as Nina, and Tom Engelman, as Trplev, performed in last year's
Drama Dept. production of Anton Cheldiov's The Seagull. Auditions for the department's major
production this fall, Erasmus Montanus, will be held September 24 and 25 in Little Theater.
the saying goes, and once
again it holds true for drama at
Stanford, as the University's
three m«' jor theater groups pre
pare for the 1979-80 season.
Ihe Stanford Drama De
partment will offer both tradi
tional and modern experimen
tal plays. Ram's Head will bring
original and Broadway musi
cals to the stage of Memorial
Auditorium in the fall and
spring, and, also in the fall and
spring, the Stanford Savoyards
will present the light, comic
opera of Gilbert and Sullivan.
Drama Department
Every year, the Department
of Drama presents three full
length plays—one each
quarter —in the Little Theater
next to Memorial Auditorium.
This fall's major production,

Erasmus Mmtanus, will be di
rected by the Danish profes
sional director and actor, Fritz
Drun, who is currently a third
year doctoral student in the
Drama Dept.
Written in 172.3 by Denmark's
leading classical playwright,
Ludvig Holberg, the comedy
will serve .is A >alute from
ford to Holberg s University of
Copenhagen, which this year
celebrates its 500 th anniver
sary.
Holberg spent most of his life
as a professor at the University
of Copenhagen, and his many
works have given Denmark a
native drama of international
stature. Dramatists believe that
Holberg is one of Scandanavia's
greatest playwrights, ranking
with rbsen and Strindberg.
In the play, a young man,
Rasmus Berg, returns to his
farming village after his first
year at the university, ridicul
ously proud of his newly
gained academic knowledge.
Though Rasmus speaks Latin
and goes about spouting syl
logisms, it is apparent he lacks
wisdom and sensitivity and is
naive about everyday life.
As he confronts the villagers
and their common sense, the
play pokes fun at the stuffy
academic character, while
dramatizing the conflict bet
ween academic theory and
everyday knowledge.

Erasmus Montanus thus prot
raysa very real problem that we
face today —keeping the lines of
communication open between
academics and laymen—and
remains a classic that is relevant
and open to new interpreta
tions.
Plans for this winter and
spring's major productions
have not yet been confirmed,
but they should be announced
early in the autumn quarter.
The roles in Drama Dept.
productions are open to the
Stanford community, for those
who prefer to appear on stage.
Audition announcements are
announced on fliers around
campus and in the Daily, and
preference is always given to
students.
Auditions for Erasmus Mon
tanus will be held on September
24 and 25, registration days, at

7:30 p.m. in the Little Theater.
In addition to the quarterly
plays put on in the Little Thea
ter, the department's
Graduate Directing Workshop
presents more experimental
drama in the Niterv (in the Old
Union). Second year grad
students direct these one-act
plays, to which admission is
free. For auditions, watch Once
Around the Quad.
This year, too, first year
grads, encouraged by the
favorable reaction received last
year, may open their one-acts
to the public. These produc
tions are staged in the depart
ment's studio theater, room
205.
Altogether, the Drama Dept.
provides an impressive range of
productions. Lee Fisher, the
department's publicity direc
tor, told the Daily , "We try to
do a season that will give the
community a variety of plays."
She urges students to take
advantage of the department
and to get involved in one or
more of the courses offered—
including set, costume, lighting
design and all levels of acting.
"A lot of non-drama students
take acting," Fischer said. "It is
an enriching experience, and
they learn a lot about them
selves."
Ram's Head
Ram's Head is a group of very
talented singing, dancing and

acting students who love no
thing more than to put on a
good show. Almost invariably,
they do.
Each year, Ram's Head
stages two musicals: in the
fall, Gaities, a show written,
composed, choreographed,
produced and directed by stu
dents, and in the spring, a
major Broadway musical.
This year's Gaities staff has
been working since last March,
and they will stage their pro
duction during Big Game week,
