# Special Events productions
## Popular jazz & rock enliven campus 
### Julie Ericksen 
Southside Johnny and the
Asbury Jukes, a popular east
coast rock band, will perform in
Memorial Auditorium Sep
tember 28, kicking off the
1979-80 season of ASSU Special
Events.
The band, which drew more
than 18,000 fans to a recent con
cert in Ohio, has a new album,
The Jukes, which has been mov
ing up rapidly on the charts.
Tickets for the 8 p.m. con
certs are $7.50 advance and
$8.50 at the door.
Special Events, now in its
11th year, is a completely
student-run organization
funded by the ASSU. Booking
popular jazz and rock musi
cians, director John Harris and
associate director Lenny
Lieberman bring to the campus
performers that students want
to hear — and that they would
have tc drive to San Francisco
or Oakland to see otherwise.
This last year, for example,
country-western great Willie
Nelson, jazz flutist Hubert
Laws and folk singer Joan Baez
appeared here under the Spe
cial Events banner.
In addition, sax player John
Handy and guitarist joe Pass
performed in Special Events
concerts held at The Station in
Encina Commons, providing

campus jazz audiences with a
more "intimate" atmosphere
tor star performers.
Because, however, the shows
in The Station suffered from its
tinny atmosphere and crowded
conditions, Special Events this
year will stage its smaller shows
at the Coffee House — and will
do so four times a week, every
Wednesday through Saturday.
Wednesday nights will fea
ture a "home-grown" theme,
as local, Stanford-oriented acts
bring to the campus the sounds
of acoustic guitar and jazz.
On Thursday nights, the
University's "house rockers"
can enjoy rock groups such as
Stanford's own, "Cruise Con
trol."
On Fridays, Harris said, he
hopes to host professional
musicians of all types — rock,
new wave, country-western
and jazz — and on Saturdays,
he hopes to give the Coffee
House more of a night club at
mosphere by hiring profes
sional musicians and tacking on
a cover charge.
In addition, Harris hopes to
present throughout the year
prestigious entertainers who
can make use of the excellent
acoustics at some of the other
music facilities on campiis,
such as Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and Frost Amphitheater.
