# Need a study break?
## Campus galleries offer diversion 
### 
Have you ever thought you'd
like to see the real "Golden
Spike"? Are you an avid con
chologist or mineralogist?
If so, you can find such trea
sures right here on campus.
Listed below are some little
known or often forgotten places
to visit when you feel in need of
a study break or want to do
some near-by exploring.
The Physics Explorama on
the second floor of the Varian
Physics Lab is a do-it-yourself
physics museum, with experi
ments and changing displays
that invite visitor participation.
The Explorama is open week
days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
telephone 497-4233.
The Leland Stanford Jr.

Museum has early American
art, oriental jade, Little Leland's
toys, a fantastic 91 -piece exhibit
of Rodin sculpture, and yes, the
actual "Golden Spike," which
Leland Stanford and his fellow
railroad magnates pounded
into the rails at the joining of the
transcontinental railroad. The
museum is open Tuesday
through Friday 10-4:45 p.m.,
and admission is freed. Tours
are available Tuesdays at 12:15
p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m.
The Art Gallery, located be
tween Hoover Tower and the
Quad, houses smaller, chang
ing exhibits. Admission to the
Gallery, open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tuesday through Friday, and 1
p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and
Sunday, also is free.

For a quiet place to stroll or
just to sit and think, you might
visit the Stanford family
mausoleum, or the nearby cac
tus gardens, both found in the
northeast section of the Ar
boretum. It's different . . . and
actually quite lovely
And, perhaps for
rainy days, anyone who's ever
combed a beach will enjoy the
conchology (sea shell) collec
tion tucked up under the eaves
on the third floor of Geology
Corner (in the Quad, room
341). You can stop by
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday
through Friday, except during
lunchtime. Telephone 497-
2537.
Another collection—thanks
igain to the Geology Dept.—
may be found upstairs in the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing, right outside the library,
where a display of spectacular
minerals from all over the world

is on view.
In the lobby of the Coffee
House in Tresidder, you can
often find a photograph exhibit
that features the work of local
artists. The exhibits usually in
clude landscapes and "human
interest" candids shot in black
and white.
And the University's Rare
Book Collection is kept in the
Bender Room of the Main
Library—a cluttered, interest
ing browsing room filled with
antiques. The Bender Room is
open Monday through Friday,
8 a.m. tos p.m. and Saturday, 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. 497-4054.
Keep these little "get-aways"
in mind. The next time you
need to stop fidgeting and es
cape from the books—but ha
ven't the time or money to
make it farther than your own
"backyard"—they may be just
the thing.
