# Dramatic East-to-West escapes prompt East German crackdown

Bonn, West Germany (AP) â€” A spectacular es
cape from East Germany in a hot-air balloon has
brought tighter controls to the communist side
of the border, West German officials say.
Thousands of persons have eluded border
guards in relent years, using every imaginable
means of esf.tpe from tightrope walking to
homemade submarine.
Three thousand are expected to make it ac
ross this year.
"Hell's broken loose here since the balloon
escape," an East German guard was quoted as
confiding to a West German counterpart across
the border near the Bavarian town of Naila,
where just a week ago eight East Germans, four
of them children, landed after floating'over the
frontier in a makeshift balloon.
The balloon feat was the latest in a series of
daring and sometimes bizarre escapes to the
West. East Germans have smashed through the
border in a train, snorkeled under it, slid over it
on a homemade chairlift and zipped beneath
the barriers in low-slung sports cars.
Earlier this month Renat Vogel-Heinrich, 24, a
former world swimming champion from East
Germany turned up at her aunt's home near
Stuttgart, West Germany, after escaping via
Hungary, West German news media reported.
Last week East Germany restricted movement
within 18 miles of the border, closed small air
fields and reinforced guards, a spokesman for
the Federal Border Guard said in Munich.
Crossing the 856-mile-long frontier has been
difficult since the late 19405, but for a time it was
easy to slip into the West in divided Berlin. The

city, shared by Soviet and Western powers after
World War 11, is 110 miles inside communist East
Germany.
The communists tried to plug the leak by
building the Berlin Wall in 1961.
Some refugees hid behind paneling in
westbound trains. An East German engineer
smashed across a railway barricade to take 23
friends and relatives to West Berlin in 1961.
Almost 150 persons came through a tunnel
under the wall in 1962. Then the East German
authorities started using listening devices to
stop tunnel diggers.
In 1963, three men wore Soviet officers' un
iforms to walk past guards at Checkpoint Char
lie, passage point to the Western sector.
A family escaped in 1965 in a homemade chair
lift, on a line strung late at night between (he
House of Ministries in East Berlin and a building
in West Berlin.
An East German circus artist tightrope-walked
across a switched-off power line that had been
left from pre-wall days.
One man escaped in a tiny submarine he had
built.
Small planes, some flown by persons who
never had piloted a plane before, have been a
favored means of escape in recent years.
Some Germans reportedly commit petty
crimes with political overtones, such as stomp
ing on the toes of a commissar, in hopes of
taking advantage of the West German program
of buying freedom in the West for East German
political prisoners.
