Washington (AP) â€” Andrew
Young said Saturday he is re
turning to Atlanta and will at
tempt to set up a non-profit in
ternational consulting firm
after leaving the post of U.S.
ambassador to the United Na
tions yesterday.
He said he would like the
group, whose legal form and
financial basis are still being
worked out, to engage in poli
tics, in aiding international
business and in trying to stir up
public support for new U.S.
foreign policies, including a
more favorable stance toward
the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO).
Young spoke to reporters at
the White House after briefing
President Jimmy Carter on a
trade mission which he led to
10 African nations.
Crisscrossing the continent
in a gleaming Air Force 707,
hobnobbing with heads of
state and filling local head
lines, Young on his last official
trip through Africa looked
likea man makinga triumphant
farewell tour.
He said the mission pro
duced $1.5 billion worth of
business for U.S. firms, includ
ing agreements to build a
wood-alcohol plant in Liberia
and a fertilizer plant in Nigeria
and an agreement to sell a Boe
ing 747 jetliner to the national
airline of Cameroon.
On his visit, he was garbed in
the cloak of an Ashanti chief in
Ivory Coast and of a Moslem
noble in Nigeria, and deco
rated with the Star of Africa in
Liberia.
Tanzania's Julius Nyerere

greeted him fondly as "Andy"
and Cameroonians lined the
streets to catch a glimpse.
This was the vintage Andy
Young using his blend of
charisma, frankness, preach
ing and politics to guide a de
legation of two dozen Ameri
can businessmen through
some of Africa's economically
promising'republics, selling
American technology and
know-how as the "cheapest
and best."
His traveling style had not
changed much from his first
visit to Africa as U.N.' ambas
sador.
Young is being replaced by
Donald F. McHenry, sworn in

at the White House yesterday
as the new U.N. ambassador.
Young resigned after he held
an unsanctioned meeting with
a PLO representative and then,
by his own admission, gave a
less than truthful account of
the matter to the State De
partment.
"I'm going to go back to At
lanta and try to do some of the
same things we've been doing
as an employee of the govern
ment," he said.
Asked whether this would
include "rallying people be
hind a different government
position" toward the PLO,
Young said, "I don't think we
can avoid that one."
