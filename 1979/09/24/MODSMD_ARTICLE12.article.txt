# Compromise seen on canal treaties
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Advisers
to President Jimmy Carter and
House aides are voicing confi
dence that a compromise can
be worked out this week that
will result in passage of legisla
tion to implement the Panama
Canal treaties.
If Congress fails to quickly
settle on terms of such a mea
sure to carry out the pacts, the
president's advisers say there
is a real danger of work stop
pages or even a closedown of
canal operations next month.
A reason the bill failed
to win last week, they said in
interviews in which they asked
not to be identified by name, is
that many House members
who would have voted for the

bill had left town by the time
the vote came late Thursday.
They contended most of
those who missed the vote
would have favored the
bill — and, this week, they'll
be concentrating on having all
the measure's supporters pre
sent.
Democratic leader, Jim
Wright of Texas told the House
it will not begin a week-long
recess for Columbus Day until
the bill is passed.
The treaties turning the canal
over to Panama Dec. 31, 1999,
take effect Oct. 1. The bill is
needed primarily to set up the
U.S.-controlled commission
that is to take over canal opera
tions that day.
The House refused to give
the measure what would have
been final congressional ap
proval, rejecting the bill 203-
192 shortly after the Senate had
passed it 60-35.
In debate last Thursday,
House and Senate opponents
of the legislation claimed the
canal is being turned over to a
country that is cooperating
with Cuba and the Soviet
Union in support of revolu
tion in South America.
After the House acted, the
White House issued a state
ment saying "it js inconceiva
ble that Congress will allow the
Panama Canal to be closed
even for a short time."
Legally, it said, all U.S.
rights, including the present
Panama Canal Company's right
to operate the cartal, end when
the treaties go into effect Oct.
1.
It said that Panama would
not likely take over the
canal — as some congressmen
have suggested — but the
American company would
have to decide whether to risk
spending any more money on
canal operations without legal
authority.
