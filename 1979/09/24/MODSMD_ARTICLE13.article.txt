# Libertarian Party chooses candidates
## 
### Dan Fiduccia 
Los Angeles — It wasn't the
roll call of your ordinary presi
dential nominating conven
tion.
"New York — still the tax
capital of America — votes 22
for Clark, five for Hunscher
and one abstention."
"Rhode Island — home of
Roger Williams, America's first
secessionist — castsfour votes
for Clark."
"South Carolina — the first
state to secede for state's rights
— casts two votes for Clark and
three for Hunscher."
"Utah — the only state with a
curfew for adults — casts five
votes for Clark."
And so it went on Sept. 8
when delegates of .the Liberta
rian Party convened here to
choose their ticket for the race
to the White House.
The Libertarians are the ones
who believe that the gov
ernment which doesn't govern
governs best, and even the roll
call of delegations sounded the

Libertarian themes of fighting
for individual rights and pri
vacy, slashing taxes and cutting
government to size.
When the convention's sec
retary called for the District of
Columbia delegation's votes
more than half-way through
the balloting (Libertarians be
lieve in challenging every tradi
tion of modern American poli
tics, including the notion of
calling the roll of states in al
phabetical order), the delega
tion chairman stood up.
"There is a tremendous
irony here. The District of Col
umbia, home of innumerable
thieves, extortionists, and a
few good people, casts one
vote for Hunscher and three
for Clark."
Those three votes made Ed
Clark, a 49-year-old Los
Angeles attorney, the party's
1980 presidential candidate.
Clark defeated Bill Hunscher, a
New Hampshire businessman
by a 20 percent margin.
The Libertarian Party,

founded in 1971, has become
the nation's third largest party.
Last year Clark received almost
400,000 votes in the California
gubernatorial race, more than 5
percent of the votes cast.
Though the chances are slim
that Clark will'be inaugurated
in Washington come January
1980, the Libertarians are hop
ing he will garner several mill
ion votes and exceed the mar
gin of difference between the
Democratic and Republican
candidates.
Clark sounded same of the
party's themes in his accep
tance speech.
He began by telling the
crowd of almost 2000 that they
"would like to see a three-party
America and freedom in our
time."
Speaking on the economy,
Clark said "the government
has inflated the money supply
and depreciated the dollar —
and now the bill has come due.
The future of our children can
be destroyed by inflation." He

termed taxes "not a burden,
but a blight."
Clark strongly condemned
laws regulating lifestyles.
"Both parties were too
frightened and cowardly to tell
the truth about Prohibition,
and now they are too
frightened to tell the truth
about the vicious and destruc
tive laws. The regulation of
human lifestyles creates crime
and suffering."
Clark said double-digit infla
tion and government control
of energy is "a program to de
stroy the free market. We will
propose radical free market al
ternatives."
Mentioning the party's pol
icy of noninterventionism in
foreign affairs, Clark said
"we're also the party of peace.
The Vietnam War was a biparti
san operation and a brilliant re
sult of (the two major parties')
complete cooperation. Cur
rent policies promote more of
the same."
As for current efforts to
reinstate the draft, Clark said
"if foreign policy makers think
they had troubles back in the
'60s, wait 'till they see what
Libertarians will do to any draft
proposals."
In closing, Clark said
"America was founded not on
the power of the state, but on
the liberty of the individual . . .
The Libertarian Party is the
party of principles and ideals,
not of personality and
charisma."
At a press conference later,

Clark said his proposals in
clude the privatization of edu
cation, "so that parents can
control the most valuable thing
in their lives — their children,"
billions in tax cuts, and a
foreign policy of defending the
United States and not interven
ing in other countries' affairs.
If elected, Clark said he
would use execut . ■ pardon to
reduce persona repfession.
On the Middle East, CI 1 1

Los Angeles — It wasn't the
roll call of your ordinary presi
dential nominating conven
tion.
"New York — still the tax
capital of America — votes 22
for Clark, five for Hunscher
and one abstention."
"Rhode Island — home of
Roger Williams, America's first
secessionist — castsfour votes
for Clark."
"South Carolina — the first
state to secede for state's rights
— casts two votes for Clark and
three for Hunscher."
"Utah — the only state with a
curfew for adults — casts five
votes for Clark."
And so it went on Sept. 8
when delegates of .the Liberta
rian Party convened here to
choose their ticket for the race
to the White House.
The Libertarians are the ones
who believe that the gov
ernment which doesn't govern
governs best, and even the roll
call of delegations sounded the

Libertarian themes of fighting
for individual rights and pri
vacy, slashing taxes and cutting
government to size.
When the convention's sec
retary called for the District of
Columbia delegation's votes
more than half-way through
the balloting (Libertarians be
lieve in challenging every tradi
tion of modern American poli
tics, including the notion of
calling the roll of states in al
phabetical order), the delega
tion chairman stood up.
"There is a tremendous
irony here. The District of Col
umbia, home of innumerable
thieves, extortionists, and a
few good people, casts one
vote for Hunscher and three
for Clark."
Those three votes made Ed
Clark, a 49-year-old Los
Angeles attorney, the party's
1980 presidential candidate.
Clark defeated Bill Hunscher, a
New Hampshire businessman
by a 20 percent margin.
The Libertarian Party,

founded in 1971, has become
the nation's third largest party.
Last year Clark received almost
400,000 votes in the California
gubernatorial race, more than 5
percent of the votes cast.
Though the chances are slim
that Clark will'be inaugurated
in Washington come January
1980, the Libertarians are hop
ing he will garner several mill
ion votes and exceed the mar
gin of difference between the
Democratic and Republican
candidates.
Clark sounded same of the
party's themes in his accep
tance speech.
He began by telling the
crowd of almost 2000 that they
"would like to see a three-party
America and freedom in our
time."
Speaking on the economy,
Clark said "the government
has inflated the money supply
and depreciated the dollar —
and now the bill has come due.
The future of our children can
be destroyed by inflation." He

termed taxes "not a burden,
but a blight."
Clark strongly condemned
laws regulating lifestyles.
"Both parties were too
frightened and cowardly to tell
the truth about Prohibition,
and now they are too
frightened to tell the truth
about the vicious and destruc
tive laws. The regulation of
human lifestyles creates crime
and suffering."
Clark said double-digit infla
tion and government control
of energy is "a program to de
stroy the free market. We will
propose radical free market al
ternatives."
