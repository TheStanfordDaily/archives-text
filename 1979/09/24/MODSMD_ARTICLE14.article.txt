New York (AP) â€” Veteran
television comedian Carol
Burnett said in an interview
published yesterday that her
15-year-old daughter's two
year involvement with drugs
was a nightmare that
threatened her marriage.
Burnett, who said she eaves
dropped on her daughter Car
rie's telephone conversations
to confirm that the teenager
was using drugs, told People
magazine the girl was success
fully treated at a Houston facil
ity last June.
"We were devastated, crying
ourselves to sleep every
night," the actress said, recal
ling how she and her husband,
Joe Hamilton, discovered Car
rie was on drugs at the age of
13.
"We were helpless and to
tally incapable of dealing with
it," said Burnett.
She said her daughter was
treated at the Palmer Drug
Abuse Program in Houston,
where Carrie has remained to

attend school with a number of
other youngsters treated in the
program.
The teenager was quoted as
saying that "I had been plan
ning to do acid this summer"
but instead spent the summer
in the Houston program.
By the time she was 14 she
had taken "uppers and dow
ners, speed, Seconal,
Quaaludes, cocaine, mus
hrooms, the heavy stuff. I was
content to get high for the rest
of my life."

The magazine quoted Bur
nett as saying that about 80
percent of her classmates at
the fashionable Westlake
School for Girls in Los Angeles
were "getting high," and that
she started on marijuana,
smoking up to an ounce a day
before trying other highs.
Carrie, asked why she began
using drugs, replied:
"I was always Carol Burnett's
daughter. When I got high, I
wasn't anymore. I wanted my
own image."
