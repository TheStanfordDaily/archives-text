# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Viewpoint A 						new volume 
### 
Today marks the start of Daily Volume
176. Opening day viewpoints have lie
come something ot a tradition over the
years for Daily editors introducing new
volumes. Past editors have made some
impre- -.ive promises -for better writing,
improved publii relations and more in
teresting stories only to find them
selves swamped by the task of running a
paper and attending to interminable day
to-day details.
for volume 176, Managing Editor
Randy David and I have a number of
plans; improving tin* organization of

the fast-groyvingDaily, introducing new
features, covering the Stanford campus
— our primary focus — that much bet
ter.
We have an enthusiastic staff of
editors and writers already hard at work.
We don't have lofty plans for making the
Daily into Santa Clara County's own*
New York Times. But we do hope to do a
better job writing about this University,
with your help, and to leave an imprint
on the Daily after we've gone.
