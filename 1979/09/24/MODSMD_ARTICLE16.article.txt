## USE settlement praised 
### 
I he* strike -averting settlement last week
between the University and United Stan
ford Employees must he praised. A walk
out, for whatever reason, is something we
hope never again to see here.
A concerted bargaining effort, although
at the last minute, averted a replay of the
three-week 1974 strike. And we applaud"
both sides tor realizing the harm of a strike
and working to avoid one.
In this instante, the rewards of collective
bargaining were < lear, for both parties.
rhe success of the negotiations doesn't
necessarily,reflect a new era in labor rela
tions here, however.
The rather volatile relationship between
USf and the University will undoubtedly

continue for some years. But as the union
matures and Stanford becomes more ac
customed to USE's presence here and starts
dealing more honestly and sincerely with
the union, things will improve.
After six years here, USE has significantly
improved the wages and benefits of many
University employees. The new contract is
not what some union members had hoped
for, but it lays the groundwork for future
talks and agreements that will someday up
grade, in the administration's eyes, the
standing of workers here.
In the meantime, we are thankful an ag
reement was reached and we encourage
the University and USE to stay in closer
touch so strike threats will not come so
close to reality in future contract talks.
