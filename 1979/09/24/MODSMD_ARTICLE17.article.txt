Running scared
I very day of the last year I ran
freely in the hills behind the
University. I no longer have
this opportunity. I he rapes
that have occurred in the past
few months have resti it ted my
freedom. Sometimes I < ome to
the lulls to run and must turn
back because of suspit ious
looking cars parked .it the en
trant e or bet a use o! men walk
ing or running in the lulls
112 very time I do run, I feel that
I must t ompletely hide my

body and its feminine charac
teristics (a most tertain con
trast to the barely-clad males
who run in the hills).
Furthermore, my justifiably
paranoiac perceptions make
the running barely enjoyable. I
jump at every movement of a
squirrel. I tearfully watch trees
which t.ike on male forms. The
outline of Fioover Tower below
takes on added significance
and things in the environment
take on symbolic meanings
that tliey would otherwise not
have.

I am a graduate student and
running in the hills was one of
the few things that allowed me
to escape from the pressures of
Stanford life. It was extremely
important to me to be able to
gel above Stanford and run in
the open country. I can no
longer enjoy such feelings. It is
easy tor others to advise to
"just not run in the hills." It is
painful for me to have to give
up that experience.
