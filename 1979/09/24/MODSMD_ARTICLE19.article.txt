## Power politics ignite terrorism 
### 
Today, power politics work.
Flimsy justifications, similar to
the ones employed by the
Nazis in their usurpation of
Czechoslovakia and Poland,
are in use again in many parts
of the world. The superpowers
will not and cannot interfere.
They may incite but they will
not fight. Forty years ago a
world war erupted. In this last
part of the twentieth century,
terrorism or a war of liberation
— take your choice — are re
placing the open conflict.
However, the suffering and
frustration remain the same.
In other times, when war was
the realm of romantics, and
young aristocrats would dash
for the officer's gold insignia,
war was perceived as a gentle
man's duel.
The common man, who ac
tually did the fighting, did not
yet have his "unalienable
rights." He was fed instead a
diet of empty promises and
slogans for fatherland, God
and family. Often nationalism
was not the issue, unless it was
convenient, and the carving of
boundaries was arbitrary, cut
ting across ethnic units to suit
royal dowries. The European
kings were all related, which
kept the number of hemophilic

blue bloods to a minimum.
Bearers of policy were strong
prime ministers, men who
thought themselves larger than
life and certainly greater than
their age. Treaties following
wars were swift and decisive,
allowing a breath to weary ar
mies and ravaged economies
— until the next war. Germany
spoiled things following fhe
first Great War by refusing to
accept the "gentlemen's ag
reement" shortly after the ar
mistice. It has never been the
same since.
By then wars had become
more complicated, more
deadly. More bodies were
needed to feed more devastat
ing weapons which spread
death with stunning ease.
World War II saw the
emergence of the lofty ideas as
a coverup to ephemeral
economic and commercial
concerns. It was now one na
tion of high moral values
against another of equally high
preachings. It was a time when
God supported everybody in
their "just struggle", when a
German priest would conduct
a mass a few miles away from
where an Anglican minister
would pray to God to help his
flock in their fight against the

Godless enemy. Itwasatimeof
philosophical acrobatics,
moralistic meanderings and
"biological" interpretations of
history all amid the crematoria,
the massacres and the new im
perium.
The total subjugation of Nazi
Germany brought a new order
of things, almost incredibly yet
fittingly, a cold not warm war,
between former allies.
The world entered the era of
the "superpower" with its
satellites and "spheres of in
fluence." A precarious yet
steady balance emerged that
kept and keeps the world
hopefully on more than a tight
rope over the abyss of a nuc
lear holocaust.
Yet, like all things, the wel
come balance of power or
"rough parity" promotes con
flicts by proxies in numerous
hot spots around the globe.
The misery of war is not eradi
cated. Gone are the prime
ministers or the Velated kings
of bygone eras to impose their
solution over the smaller na
tions, following a romantic and
gentlemanly war.Today, con
flicts are prolonged. Smaller
nations play the one super
power vs. the other in a game
of continuous balances.

Today, problems are not
"solved." There is, for in
stance, a 1967 U.N. resolution
calling for Israel to withdraw
from the Arab-occupied lands,
a resolution supported on the
surface by both the United
States and the Soviet Union,
along with 100 other nations.
Israel has not felt compelled to
comply over a period of 12
years.
Following Turkey's invasion
of Cyprus in 1974, a vote in the
United Nations of 115 to 5
asked Turkey to remove its
army from the island. Turkey
has yet to move a soldier.
Ireland, ruthlessly separated
by a foreign invader into
northern and southern parts,
has again surfaced in the news.
Years of turmoil have not per
suaded all that the true prob
lem is the "peacekeeping"
British army of occupation.
It is a sign of our times that
people who feel they were
wronged would resort to ter
rorism. It is the current world
power structure that prolongs
problems, often precludes
solution and tolerates blatant
injustice.
