# University donations reach high
## 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
Despite recessionary pressures on
fund-raising, gifts received by the
University last year soared 18.1 per
cent to a record $64.5 million.
The announcement came in a re
port to the Board of Trustees at its
meeting earlier th'is month.
Led by strong performances in all
gift categories, total receipts jumped
$9.9 million in the year ending Aug.
31 compared with the $54.6 million
received in the previous year.
Receipts were a full $8.4 million
ahead of the previous record of $56.1
million received in the year ending
Aug. 31, 1977.
Administration officials were "very
pleased" with the performance. Re
ceipts far outdistanced the administ
ration goal of $55.5 million set at the
beginning of fiscal 1978-79.
"It's just an awfully nice thing to
have," said David Fulton, University
director of development communi
cations. "It was apparent as early as
May that we were going to have a
darn good year."
No single factor was responsible
for the increase, according to Joel
Smith, vice president for develop
ment.
"Things just came together well,"
he said.
The previous record was set in the
final" year of the $300 million, five
year Campaign for Stanford.
Following the successful comple
tion of the campaign, most officials
predicted a drop in gift levels.
But administrators had indicated
that in order to maintain a balanced
budget, the University would have to
receive gifts totaling over $50 million
each year.
Smith, while pleased with 1978-79,
was cautious about the University's
ability to repeat the performance this
year.
He said the recession nationwide
had a "dampening effect" on fun
draising efforts.
"But even considering that, we'll
get more than $50 million (in 1979-
80). Our program is that strong," he
said. ,
"We (the University) have confi
dently established ourselves in sec
ond place" for university fundraising
nationwide. In first place is Harvard
which set another fundraising re
cord, receiving $70 million last year.
Yale was third last year, collecting
nearly $56 million.
Smith said Yale had a "very strong
year" in what was the final year of
their own major campaign.
Yale has been having some finan
cial problems the past few years in
cluding multi-million-dollar
operating-budget deficits.
But despite the strong showings by
the top three, other private institu
tions posted varied performances.
After Yale, the next highest gift be
neficiary received well below $40
million, and for several institutions,
1978-79 was a bad year for fund
raising.
The strong gift performance was a
piece of good economic ngwsamid a
great deal of bad news for the Uni
versity. According to Raymond Bac
chetti, vice provost for budget and
planning, the University's budget is
"very stretched" because of a 13 per
cent annual inflation rate over the
past year. The administration had as
sumed an 8 percent inflation rate
when planning the budget.
As a result of the surprising rise in
prices, faculty and non-union staff
salaries will rise by 2 percent more
than had been planned for this year,
according to associate provost
Wayne Price.
Bacchetti and Smith indicated that
the high gift receipts will do little to
ease the budget's strain. Both
explained that many gifts are re
stricted for specific projects, many of
which are outside of the operating
budget.
Bacch'etti said inflation and the de
cline in personal income relative to

inflation will be important factors as
administrators begin the traditional
autumn financial forecasting which
will be the basis for budgets for fiscal
1980-81.
As a result of this work, the ad
ministration will ask the Board of
Trustees in December to approve a
tuition increase for the following

year. In the past, the administration
has used a cost-of-living formula in
determining the tuition hike.
This year, however, with doubie
digit inflation a reality, the formula
may not be possible as most officials
consider it unreasonable to ask stu
dents to pay an additional 15 percent
for tuition a year from now.

he said.
The previous record was set in the
final" year of the $300 million, five
year Campaign for Stanford.
Following the successful comple
tion of the campaign, most officials
predicted a drop in gift levels.
But administrators had indicated
that in order to maintain a balanced
budget, the University would have to
receive gifts totaling over $50 million
each year.
Smith, while pleased with 1978-79,
was cautious about the University's
ability to repeat the performance this
year.
He said the recession nationwide
had a "dampening effect" on fun
draising efforts.
"But even considering that, we'll
get more than $50 million (in 1979-
80). Our program is that strong," he
said. ,
"We (the University) have confi
dently established ourselves in sec
ond place" for university fundraising
nationwide. In first place is Harvard
which set another fundraising re
cord, receiving $70 million last year.
Yale was third last year, collecting
nearly $56 million.
Smith said Yale had a "very strong
year" in what was the final year of
their own major campaign.
Yale has been having some finan
cial problems the past few years in
cluding multi-million-dollar
operating-budget deficits.
But despite the strong showings by
the top three, other private institu
tions posted varied performances.
After Yale, the next highest gift be
neficiary received well below $40
million, and for several institutions,
1978-79 was a bad year for fund
raising.
The strong gift performance was a
piece of good economic ngwsamid a
great deal of bad news for the Uni
versity. According to Raymond Bac
chetti, vice provost for budget and
planning, the University's budget is
"very stretched" because of a 13 per
cent annual inflation rate over the
past year. The administration had as
sumed an 8 percent inflation rate
when planning the budget.
As a result of the surprising rise in
prices, faculty and non-union staff
salaries will rise by 2 percent more
than had been planned for this year,
according to associate provost
Wayne Price.
Bacchetti and Smith indicated that
the high gift receipts will do little to
ease the budget's strain. Both
explained that many gifts are re
stricted for specific projects, many of
which are outside of the operating
budget.
Bacch'etti said inflation and the de
cline in personal income relative to

inflation will be important factors as
administrators begin the traditional
autumn financial forecasting which
will be the basis for budgets for fiscal
1980-81.
As a result of this work, the ad
ministration will ask the Board of
Trustees in December to approve a
tuition increase for the following

year. In the past, the administration
has used a cost-of-living formula in
determining the tuition hike.
This year, however, with doubie
digit inflation a reality, the formula
may not be possible as most officials
consider it unreasonable to ask stu
dents to pay an additional 15 percent
for tuition a year from now.
Despite recessionary pressures on
fund-raising, gifts received by the
University last year soared 18.1 per
cent to a record $64.5 million.
The announcement came in a re
port to the Board of Trustees at its
meeting earlier th'is month.
Led by strong performances in all
gift categories, total receipts jumped
$9.9 million in the year ending Aug.
31 compared with the $54.6 million
received in the previous year.
Receipts were a full $8.4 million
ahead of the previous record of $56.1
million received in the year ending
Aug. 31, 1977.
Administration officials were "very
pleased" with the performance. Re
ceipts far outdistanced the administ
ration goal of $55.5 million set at the
beginning of fiscal 1978-79.
"It's just an awfully nice thing to
have," said David Fulton, University
director of development communi
cations. "It was apparent as early as
May that we were going to have a
darn good year."
No single factor was responsible
for the increase, according to Joel
Smith, vice president for develop
ment.
"Things just came together well,"
he said.
