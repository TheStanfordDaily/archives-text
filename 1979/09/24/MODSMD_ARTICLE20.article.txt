## Where do you stand on the political plane? 
### 
The conventional concept of
a one-dimensional political
spectrum is increasingly at
odds with the realities of con
temporary American political
life. Thinking in terms of two
political dimensions — civil
liberties and economic
freedom — allows one to
more accurately perceive polit
ical reality and more fully com
prehend the interdependence
between personal and
economic freedom.
By answering the following
16 questions, you can find your
own place in the political
plane.

your civil liberties position.

Liberals, while generally
favoring personal autonomy
with respect to personal
beliefs, moralities and lifes
tyles, believe substantial gov
ernment control of the
economy is both possible and
necessary.
Conservatives, while skepti
cal of the state's ability to oper
ate'the economy, believe that
the state can and should legis
late personality morality and
lifestyles.
Totalitarians favor strict gov
ernment control of all aspects
of personal and social exis
tence.
Libertarians hold that no
person or group, including
government, can rightfully use
force or the threat of force ex
cept for defensive purposes.
These four positions do not,
of course, exhaust all possible
positions on the political
plane. There clearly are shad
ings and gradations among
these differing viewpoints.
