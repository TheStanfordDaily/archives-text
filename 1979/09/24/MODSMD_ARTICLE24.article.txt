# ORIENTATION '79
## Activities focus on fun, academics 
### Monika Guttman 
"It's been unreal, trying to keep up with
everything that's been going on: I hope
the rest of the year isn't like this ... or
maybe, I hope it is." - a freshman.
Since last Wednesday, new students at
the University have been attending lec
tures, setting up their rooms and generally
learning about life on this campus as part
of the Orientation Week activities.
Packets with detailed calendars of the
week's events awaited the arriving stu
dents in their rooms. Housing associates
(RAs) and Orientation volunteers helped
the freshmen and transfers to adjust and to
find their way around, guiding them from
one event to another.
"It's bee-n exhausting," said volunteer
Vince Foeke at the Field Day activities yes
terday. "It'sagood thing it won't goon too
much longer ... I wouldn't have the
â€ž energy."
The academic side
The activities officially began Wednes
day afternoon with Parent's Day activities
at Bowman Alumni house. Later in the
evening the freshmen were welcomed to
the University by President Richard Ly
man. At the same time, Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadourian in
troduced students to education here.
"Orientation has a much more
academic feeling this year, with better ad
vising and counseling," said Alice Supton,
assistant dean of residential education.

"We're emphasizing undergraduate
education by giving many more oppor
tunities for students to meet with advisors
and hear speakers on the various distribu
tion requirements and requirements for
different majors," she said.
Supton also mentioned another innova
tion in the Orientation Week activities.
"There is heavier emphasis on ethnic
orientation this year. All the ethnic ac
tivities were planned so that they did not
conflict with anything else on the
schedule."
Events for this part of orientation were
sponsored by the Native American Orien
tation Committee, the Asian American
New Student Orientation Committee, the
Black Community Services Center and
Casa Zapata.
"A lot of people have complained that
the lectures were too long, or that their
advisor isn't any good," said one
freshman. "I think it's been pretty helpful
myself."
Getting around
But a major part of the orientation prog
ram was designed to help new students
get to know one another and to acquaint
them with the physical aspects of the cam
pus.
'The old cliches about getting lost on
campus are really true," said one
freshman. "Wednesday was terrible; it
took me an hour to find my way back to the
dorm from Tressider."

"I think the volunteers are a big help to
new students in terms of learning their
way around campus," said Sarah
Rockwell, coordinator of freshmen orien
tation. "The maps that come in the orien
tation packets just aren't enough."
As part of Orientation Week, guided
tours were led all around campus and
through various different facilities, such as
the libraries and Stanford Center for In
formation Processing (SCIP).
The activities most new students
seemed to enjoy the best, however, were
the parties and other social events.
"This is the best part, the fruit of all the
labor," said Rockwell, who spent most of
the summer working on orientation.
Different social events ranged from bar
beques agd square dances to talent shows
and sherry hours, all sponsored by the dif
ferent dormitories. On Thursday night,
various student performing groups from
campus, including the Mendicants and the
Savoyards, gave mini concerts in the
dorms.
Orientation week activities culminated
yesterday with Field Day, an afternoon in
the sun including volleyball, frisbee, races
and square dancing.
"The coordinators have been terrific,"
said Supton. "They've done a really fantas
tic job."
"Orientation has been terrific, "said one
freshman. "It's been a time to get together
and get it together. "
