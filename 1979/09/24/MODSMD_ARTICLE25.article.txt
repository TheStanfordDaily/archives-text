# 'Parents quaking too'
## 
### Samuel Howe 
University President Richard
Lyman paid tribute to the pa
rents of the class of 1983 as
much as he paid tribute to the
class itself in remarks at
freshman convocation Thurs
day.
"For just a few minutes this
evening I'd like to talk to you
about what your parents are
undertaking in sending you to
Stanford — or allowing you to
go, or just finding that you've
gone... .
"Beneath those somewhat
too energetic smiles of en
couragement, behind that bar
rage of last-minute advice,
there is probably less self
confidence than you may
think," Lyman told the incom
ing freshman class in Memorial
Auditorium.
"Parents, like faculty mem
bers and even upon occasion
an administrator or two, can
appear strong, aloof, invulner
able, when inside they are
quaking iis much as you are."
Independence
And while independence is a
"key element" in growing up,
the president remarked, "it
can be very helpful to parents if
their offspring allow for the
remote possibility that some,
at least, of their new ideas and
changes in outlook may prove
no more permanent than the
ideas and outlook they
brought with them to college.
"One often hears it said that
'youth' is a time for experi
menting.' But the implications
of that casual remark are not
always recognized: the fact is
that not all experiments work.
Not all proofs stand up to
subsequent review. . . .
Perhaps (parents) have a right
to expect you to know that not
every exciting new adventure
is going to pan out."
The auditorium swelled with
faces new to the Stanford cam
pus; most new students had
arrived here only hours earlier.
There were cheers when
Freshman Orientation coor
dinator Sarah Rockwell intro
duced "a man whose face you
may no 112 recognize but whose
name is familiar" — Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon.

"If we took literally all that
was written on your behalf,"
Lyman told the class with a
grin, "Stanford would have a
corner on saints."
And, Hargadon said, it
would take "a quarter or so"
for freshmen to change from
wondering "How did I get in?"
to wondering "How did all
those others get in?"
The dean alluded to the rest
less Milo in The Phantom
Tollbooth, "who'when he was
in school longed to be out, and
when he was out of school,
longed to be in.' " There is
"some Milo in all of us," he
said.
And Hargadon counseled
stydents "to enter as your own
man or woman and go out that
way," to try "not to live your
next 40 years in the next four,"
to keep a private self and a
sense of humor, and "to stay
healthy and enjoy Stanford.
The dean also announced
that the essay question on next
year's application would finally
be changed; no longer will
prospective students be
queried as to "what book you
would write were you to write
one." This information was re
ceived with great applause.
President Lyman set a
somewhat more somber tone
to the evening, but also
clothed his advice in humor.
He asked students to "keep
your parents at least minimally
informed" about their ac
tivities, so that the shock
would not be so great when pa
rents find at Christmastime
that: " 'not only has
Johnnie/Jeanie changed com
pletely from the sensible,
clear-headed youngster who
left
the nest in September, but
he/she never gave a hint of
what was happening until
He/she showed up on the
doorstep on December 22,
having lost his/her housekey,
with 50 cents to his/her name,
having pawned his one decent
suit to buy that awful pedal
steel guitar .... And the
friends who began dropping
by between then and New
Year's: one communist, two
Zen Buddhists, an ex disc

jockey from Alameda and sev
eral persons of indeterminate
sex. . . "
Lyman also said that while it
is easy enough to spot "mate
rially vested interests" in this
world, it is more difficult to
spot "intellectual and spiritual
vested interests.
"The fact is, however, that
most people, when they give
up an orthodox set of views,
simply adopt some other or
thodoxy, some other pre
cooked set of opinions, no
more independently thought
through than those of people
with material vested interests."
Lyman repeated the remin
der, which he promised stu
dents would hear again and

again, "that in the last analysis
what you make of your vast
new opportunities is up to you,
and therefore that it will be
to adopt a passive
attitude, and attitude of "I'll do
what I have to and wait for op
portunities beyond that to
come to me, rather than going
after them.
If that is an overworked
theme, the reason is that it's so
true. Furthermore, it's much
more true at a major university
than at a smaller college. . . .
But I've really not met any Stan
ford undergraduate who
showed signs of initiative and a
willingness to try to shape the
institution to his or her pur
poses who failed to do just
that."
