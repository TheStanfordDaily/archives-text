# Emphasis put on liberal education

"lf you aspire to become an
authentic professional rather
than a sophisticated techni
cian, you will have to be liber
ally educated, and such educa
tion is hard to come by in pro
fessional schools. So this is the
time for it."
Undergraduate Dean Herant
Katchadourian stressed the
challenges, pressures and de
cisions presented to those
seeking a "liberal education"
in his welcoming address to
entering freshmen.
He acknowledged that a
large proportion of University
students are preprofessional.
According to studies con
ducted by the University on the
class of 1981, he said, two out
of three students listed
medicine, law, business or en
gineering as career choices.
"I see little need and even
less use in denying or decrying
these trends," he said. "This
country could do worse than to
be led by the likes of you."
Sacrifice
But Katchadourian warned
that many preprofessional stu
dents sacrifice their "liberal
education."
"To those of you who are set

on a professional career or are
primarily concerned about vo
cational preparation, I would
like to offer a word of caution.
There are enormous pressures
awaiting you â€” some gener
ated by the professional
schools you hope to get in to,
but a lot of your own doing. In
that scramble your liberal edu
cation is likely to be the most
important casualty."
The original concept of a lib
eral education referred to edu
cation appropriate for free
men, Katchadourian said.
"This was meant in the Ger
man sense of the aristocratic
title of "Freiherr." As men of
substance and status, such
people had no need for educa
tion to earn a living or to im
prove their lot. The value of
education for them was in au
gmenting their intellectual
sophistication, refining their
aesthetic sensibilities, linking
them with their cultural herit
age."
Definition
Katchadourian defined the
liberal education he believes
can be achieved at the Univer
sity.
"All too often, liberal educa

tion is equated with the
humanities. Crucial as the
humanities are to a liberal edu
cation, the two are not the
same.
"I refer to the serious at
tempt to engage in intellectual
discourse, to the study of the
first principles and all that fol
lows from them, no matter
what your field. It is the life
long exploration of the
thoughts of those who have
addressed themselves to such
fundamental questions.
But Katchadourian also
acknowledged that univer
sities perform an important
role in vocational training.
"Of the major reasons cited
for coming to college, prepro
fessional or vocational training
is the easiest to understand.
"The history of Stanford is
no exception. On Oct. 1,1891,
at the opening of the Univer
sity, Mr. Leland Stanford told
the members of the entering
freshmen class, 'Remember
that life is, above all, practical;
that you are here to fit your
selves fot a useful career; also,
that learning should not only
make you wise in the arts and
sciences, but should fully de

velop your moral and religious
natures.' "
Not practical
Katchadourian noted, how
ever, that liberal education
often opposes this "practical"
philosophy.
"Learning that is not voca
tional or utilitarian is often re
fered to as general or liberal
education. General education
implies exposure to a wide
range of fields. It presupposes
that the educated person
should know at least some
thing about the major areas of
learning.
"It is essentially exposure to
other people's professional
fields, and it is not utilitarian
only because you do not get
enough of any of its compo
nents to become sufficiently
proficient to be hired for it."
The liberal education, said
Katchadourian, is available
here if a student seeks it.
"At the end of four years I
hope you will be able to say, as
did a graduating senior last
year, 'Stanford was the best
experience of my life. I hope it
is only the beginning,' "
Katchadourian told his audi
ence.
