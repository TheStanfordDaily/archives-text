More than free t-shirts

Getting oriented is a lot of work.
Ask the freshmen who have moved all their
belongings into a little cubicle which will now be
home, attended six different meetings on what
it's like to be at the University, and gotten lost on
the way back to the dorm all in one day â€” and
they will agree.
Or ask the orientation volunteers.
"It's work, but we're dedicated," said Brenda
Watson, who had to be at the airport at 5:30 a.m.
to meet incoming freshmen on their flights.
Another volunteer agreed, adding "But it
sure is a lot of fun."
While many of the 100 volunteers said they
enjoyed participating in orientation week, the
individual reasons for signing up differed.
"In the spring, I showed prospective
freshmen around campus," said Alan Olivero.
"I got a kick out of sharing my experiences with
them."
lon Kagen said that being a volunteer made it
possible for him to move in early and "be here
for the fun of the first few days."
One volunteer said he just wanted the free
T-shirt.
"I've been involved with orientation for the
past two years," said Nickoletta Farros. "I really
like meeting all the freshmen. And I think they
appreciate some of the things we do, like meet
ing them at the airports."
Other volunteers also said they felt the orien
tation itself was enhanced by the presence of
the upperclass students.
"I went through orientation twice," said
junior Tom Harrell, "once as a freshman at
Haverford College and a second time as a trans
fer to Stanford. The orientation here was far
superior because the volunteers made me feel
comfortable."

Debbie Sanders, a senior, said she became a
volunteer because of her experience last year
living in the trailers with a Housing Associate
(RA).
"I saw how much help she gave to new
people, and I thought that it was a neat thing. So
112 signed up for this," she said.
Sarah Rockwell, co-ordinator of freshmen
orientation, and Phebe Prescott, co-ordinator of
transfer orientation, spent most of the summer
organizing the activities of the week. Aside from
planning different meetings, dinners, events,
and Field Day, they had to arrange all the volun
teers into shifts and work schedule.
"Now that the volunteers are actually here
and working, it's much more rewarding," said
Rockwell. "During the summer, when you see
only names, you start to lose sight of what you're
working for," she said.
The assignments for the volunteers varied
from meeting the freshmen in front of the diffe
rent dorms to such duties as assisting parents at
Parents' Day activities, guiding tours for
freshmen across campus, and security and
music at Field Day.
"This is the ultimate insult,'"moaned one vol
unteer, looking over the list of duties. "I've
been assigned to garbage."
The volunteers all seemed to agree that the
co-ordinators had done a "terrific" job of or
ganizing orientation week and making it fun for
both freshmen and volunteers.
"And the best part is that you're working with
people who really like Stanford, who want to do
something for it," said sophomore |udy Moore
land.
One volunteer summed up the experience.
"Good times, good food, and you can't beat
the fringies."
