# Heart transplants spur medical advances
## 
### Scott Leland 
In 1967, medical history was made when
the beating heart of one human was suc
cessfully transplanted into the body of
another for the first time.
And although the recipient of the
world's first cardiac transplant lived only
for a few days, the event opened new
doors in the field of cardiology with the
potential for saving thousands of lives
each year.
Now, 12 years after that first transplant,
there are only three centers in the United
States that continue to perform the proce
dure: Cornell University in New York; the
Medical College of Virginia in Richmond
and the University Medical Center here.
A surge of interest and activity quickly
followed the initial transplant. By 1969,
more than 100 cardiac transplants had
been performed in centers worldwide. Yet
while the operative procedure itself is rela
tively simple, postoperative procedure is
not. High mortality rates in these early
transplants discouraged many centers
from continued activity.
Since 1968, the Med Center has per
formed cardiac transplants on 176 pa
tients, 70 of whom are alive today. While
the procedure has advanced significantly
since its inception (70 percent of current
recipients survive the first year, compared

toonly 22 percent in 1968), the Med Center
still must deal with three major problems:
—Availability of donor hearts. Approxi
mately one-third of all cardiac patients
awaiting a transplant at the University die be
fore a suitable donor becomes available.
The primary source of donor hearts is
young adults who sustain irreversible
brain damage from trauma or hemor
rhage. Donor hearts are in constant de
mand, yet they come in a very random
nature. "Sometimes we'll get two or three
in a week; sometimes we won't get any for
two months," explained Lois Christ
opherson, chief clinical social worker in
the Department of Surgery.
One method of increasing the number
of donor hearts available is to transport
them outside of the body at a temperature
near freezing and store the hearts in an
electrolyte solution. This technique ena
bles the Med Center to fly in hearts from as
far away as Los Angeles and "gives us ac
cess to a greater number of donor hearts
than we've ever had before," said Christ
opherson.
— Rejection of the donor heart by the
patient. This remains the single most chal
lenging part of the postoperative proce
dure. Although all donor and recipient
hearts are matched on the basis of blood
and tissue types, the recipient is still apt to
reject the donor heart. To prevent rejec

tion, doctors administer 'high
dose prednisone and azathioprine. Yet it
leaves the patient susceptible to infections
which can be life-threatening.
— Cost of the procedure to the patient.
The costs of an extended hospital stay,
laboratory, medicine and operating room
fees can total $60,000 per patient. Medi
care, while paying for selected aspects of
the procedure, does not officially cover
the cost of heart transplantation because it
is sometimes considered "experimental"
and therefore not "reasonable and neces
sary for the diagnosis and treatment of ill
ness." In addition, Blue Cross and Bloe
Shield in some states no longer pay for
heart transplantation.
Medicare coverage urged
Recently Dr. Norman Shumway and
members of the heart transplant team here
urged Medicare coverage of cardiac trans
plantation. In a letter addressed to Henry
Hehir, director of medical services policy
at the Health Care Financing Administra
tion, the doctors argued that the proce
dure is the only effective treatment for
select patients with end-stage heart dis
ease.
"Furthermore," the letter added, "it is
absolutely necessary for their survival
beyond a few months."
Also, the doctors pointed out that car
