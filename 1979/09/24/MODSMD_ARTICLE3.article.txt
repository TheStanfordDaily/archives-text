# Coffee House pickets to resume
## 
### Simon Labov 
Fired Coffee House employees
planned to resume their picketing
outside Tresidder Union today in
protest over their sudden dismissal
last summer.
Guckenheimer Enterprises, the
corporation with a University con
tract to operate the Coffee FJouse,
fired 39 employees, including two
managers, on July 27.
The dismissed workers charge
they were fired for trying to organize
and possibly join a union.
The National Labor Relations
Board decided Friday to file suit in
federal court against Guckenheimer
for labor law violations.
Guckenheimer president Stewart
Ritchie said shortly after the firing he
had heard "no word of unionizing."
However, Andrew Brooks, food
service director for the Guc
kenheimer subsidiary in charge of
campus operations, said the ex
managers "brought it (union or
ganizing) up to me. That was in pas
sing ... I had no firm knowledge (of
it)."
Pickets today
Jeffery Kimball, one of the fired
employees, said the group plans to
picket Tresidder Union again today.
Kimball said the picket lines are
meant to inform people and to ask
them to boycott the Coffee House
and all other Guckenheimer opera
tions, such as The Transition, also at
Tresidder, and Encina Commons.
Meanwhile, to help resolve the
conflict, Dan Williams, director of
Tresidder Union, said the University
is accelerating progress toward the
creation of the Union Board, a group
of faculty and students to advise the
Union on the best methods to serve
the community.
He also said an outside food ser
vice advisor will be used to help de
termine the Union's potential.
Finally, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons has created a committee
of uninvolved persons "to find out

what happened and why it hap
pened," Williams said.
Fewer customers
The Coffee House needed a
change because of the drop in cus
tomer count, Ritchie said.
He said that the company believed
the change "had to be sudden and
abrupt." The customer count re
mained below last year's until April
when beer and wine were added to
the Coffee House's bill of fare, he
explained.
Chip Zemple, an employee for six
years at the Coffee House, said that
Guckenheimer concerned itself only
with profits and not with community
service. In his opinion, the workers
"were fired because they (Guc
kenheimer) knew we were already
organized enough that they would
have had some sort of action on their
hands."
Conditions, control
"The workers had discussed or
ganizing and the possibility of join
ing a union to enable them to bargain
for better working conditions and
more control over Coffee House op
erations," Zemple acknowledged.
Ritchie added that Guckenheimer
wanted to attract more people to the
Coffee House. A statement released
by Guckenheimer affirmed that in
formal probes of the Food Service
Advisory Committee found that
"there were many potential custom
ers who could not find what they
wanted at the Coffee House."
The employees were given a
chance to re-apply, Ritchie said. Al
though several were rehired, but the
Coffee House now employs fewer
part-time workers.
Union-sanctioned
The workers assembled a picket
line sanctioned by the AFL-CIO
councils and the Teamsters Union
soon after their dismissals. Thus the
picket line could block many de
liveries. In fact, Zemple said Guc
kenheimer personnel were forced to
make many deliveries themselves.

The fired workers also opened a
food stand during the summer. Cal
led the "True Coffee House," it of
fered coffee and sandwiches. The
County Health Board closed the
stand after a week in business be
cause it was not officially licensed.
The workers then placed their
stand on wheels, obtained a re
frigerator and were soon licensed as
a mobile food cart.


In an effort to boycott the firing without notification of the
Coffee House's 39 employees, the "True" Coffee House
was set up in front of Tresidder Union. The fired workers
