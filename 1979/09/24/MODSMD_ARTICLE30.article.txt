# Heart transplant recipient enjoys full, active life

### 
It seems nothing can stop
Louis Bonesio.
At 45, the Gilroy, Calif, resi
dent lives a lite of what he calls
"constructive leisure" by sail
ing, riding in hot air balloons,
motorcycling and driving a
high-powered sportscar.
This might not seem un
usual, except that Bonesio is
alive because the heart of
another human beats in his
chest.
Bonesio was 38 when his first
heart attack hit. He believes
the attack was partly due to the
pressures of operating a wine
business which he said is "at
the mercy of the weather and
the whims of the public."
The attack kept him in Vete
rans Administration Medical
Center in Palo Alto for eight
months. Since then he has be
come one of Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center's 10
longest-living heart transplant
patients.
"I thought the last person in
the world to have a heart attack
would be me, or so I'd always
thought," Bonesio recalls. "I
used to smoke, but I had to
quit. And when they told me I
should have a transplant, I
thought the whole idea was
preposterous!
"I told the doctors that I
didn't care to have the trans
plant and that I didn't like the
odds.
"But then I started running
out of energy. I'd been in the
hospital for more than eight
months, and I couldn't see my
kids very often. They wereonly
eight and fouratthetimeand it
was hard for them to under
stand what was going on."
On May 11, 1974, Bonesio
underwent the four-hour
surgery that replaced his failing
heart. He was Stanford's 71st
heart transplant recipient (the
University has now trans
planted 176 patients since the
first one on Jan. 6, 1968. Of
these patients, 70 are currently
alive).
"I was truly surprised when I

woke up," he recalled. "But I
told myself I would not give
up."
And he didn't. Three months
iater Bonesio was out of the
hospital and started his life
over again.
Since the transplant,
Bonesio says, "emotions don't
fire me up as much now. But
that has its advantages too.
Now I weigh' everything first.
That fits my birthsign

anyway — I'm a Libra."
The long hospital stay
caused permanent atrophy to
Bonesio's leg muscles, and if
he tries to run his legs bruise
badly.
"I used to run track in
school," he reflected. "I
wanted to play tennis and rac
quetball. There's no way I can
do that now, but what the hell?
I'll make that sacrifice."
The medications Bonesio

takes to combat rejection of
the transplant — prednisone
and imuran — caused some
damage to his bones. His ver
tebrae have decreased in size
and he subsequently shrank
from five-foot-eleven to five
foot-nine.
"Now I feel like I'm standing
in a hole when I'm with my old
friends," he quipped.
The prednisone also caused
bone degeneration and he was
forced to have his hipbones
replaced two years ago. A few
months after the surgery
Bonesio again returned to the

hospital, this time with "four
broken ribs.
"I was motoring a bit too fast
in a construction zone, turned
a corner, lost control and hit a
parked car," he recalled. "I to
talled my Porsche. While I was
in the hospital, I got a herpes
infection. I guess 1977 was not
a good year," he laughed.
But Bonesio believes the key
to survival lies in his attitude.
"Damn it, I'm not going to
quit."
Bonesio tries to instill a simi
lar attitude in others. He works
with social workers ift the heart

transplant program and talks
to potential patients about all
aspects of the experience. In
addition, he also occasionally
meets with Bill Van Buren, the
University's longest-living
heart transplant patient.
Bonesio said he has no prob
lem at higher altitudes and
usually flies when he travels
abroad.
"The only problem I have is
at the airports. The authorities
always want to know why I'm
carrying around so much
'dope,' and the metal in my

hips sets off the detectors."
Surprisingly, Bonesio
doesn't get travel fatigue even
though he still gets by with
only three to four hours of
sleep a night ("a lifelong
habit," he says).
Active in community affairs,
Bonesio serves on the board of
directors of the Gilroy
Chamber of Commerce and
the Santa Clara County Chap
ter of the American Heart As
sociation. He is also a member
of Gilroy's Elks Lodge and
American Legion Post 669.
