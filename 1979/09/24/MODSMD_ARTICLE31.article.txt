diac transplantation has a higher success
rate than cadaver kidney transplantation,
which is covered by Medicare.
A response from the government to the
letter, dated September 17, has not yet
been received.
Requirements
Because so few donor hearts are availa
ble and the post-operative therapy is so
strenuous, rigid requirements must be
met by all candidates for transplantation.
Patients must be at end-stage heart dis
ease and have a poor six month prognosis
for survival. Other indications for consid
eration of cardiac transplantation, as
pointed out in a letter to all referring
physician's from Christopherson, in
cluded that the patient:
— be under 50 years of age.
— have the financial resources to cover
all costs of the procedure.
— be vigorous and healthy, except for
end-stage cardiac disease.
— have a strong, supportive family, and:
— be emotionally stable.
Reasons for rejection include insulin
requiring diabetes, an active infection,
pneumonia, obesity, or a history of al
cohol, drug abuse, or mental illness.
The Med Center receives more than 300
referrals for transplant each year of which
80 percent are unable to meet the strin
gent requirements. Of the 20 percent who
are evaluated, 15 percent are accepted as
candidates for the operation. 12 percent of
the referrals survive to actually receive the

transplant.
If a patient here survives the first three
critical postoperative months, there is an
80 percent chance of surviving five years.
Stanford's longest living patient is 50-
year-old Bill Van Buren, who received his
transplant in lanuary of 1970.
Of the University's long-term survivors,
functional rehabilitation has' been
achieved in 90 percent of the cases. These
patients lead healthy, active lives. While
some have retired, others have returned
to school or to some form of employment,
ranging from teaching at a state university
to bowling professionally.
For many of the long-term survivors, the
experience seems to have had several
positive aspects.
"Most of our patients are much more
thoughtful, sensitive, aware and open six

months after the transplant then they had
been before," commented Christopher
son. "If you were to compare long-term
survivors with a random sampling of other
people in the community, you would
probably find that the long-term survivors
have a more positive and meaningful ap
proach to day-to-day life."
Overall availability of the procedure in
the United States is very limited, and
whether or not it will increase in the near
future remains to be seen. Yet assuming
that one quarter of all patients under 50
years of age who die of cardiac disease
could be a transplant candidate, there are
approximately 75,000 potential recipients
every year.
Certainly there is no shortage of de
mand. Ultimately, the limiting factor will
likely prove to be donor supply.
