Phoenix, Ariz. (AP) — The FBI and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission are inves
tigatingwhy as much as fivetonsof slightly
radioactive material apparently had a
lower percentage of uranium when it was
shipped from Arizona than when it was
received in Texas.
The NRC told the Arizona Atomic Energy
Commission Friday that between 5,000
and 10,000 pounds of the substance
known as uranium yellowcake may be in
volved, but that the problem could be

merely a bookkeeping error.
Lynn Fitzßandolph of the state commis
sion said the yellowcake - a slurry paste
with a concentration of 75 percent to 90
percent uranium - was only slightly
radioactive. He said it cannot be used to
make weapons unless enriched through a
difficult process and is toxic only if eaten
or otherwise taken into the body.
The investigation is the second
launched within a week involving the pos
sible disappearance of uranium.
