U.S., Mexico agree on natural gas
Washington — Climaxing two years of difficult negotia
tions, the United States and Mexico have agreed on the
sale of Mexican natural gas to U.S. pipeline companies,
sources said last Friday.
Negotiators for both governments had pushed to
complete the elusive agreement in advance of the arrival
here Thursday of Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo,
who will confer with President Jimmy Carter on a host of
bilateral issues.
Initial imports of gas piped in from Mexico will be
small. But officials say they view the agreement as sig
nificant because it establishes rules for U.S. access to the
Mexican gas reserves, believed to be potentially among
the largest in the world.
At the outset, the sources said, Mexican gas will cost
$3,625 per thousand cubic feet, sharply lower than
Mexico's original demand of $4.95. However, the new
agreement provides for future price hikes, keyed to an
index that ties gas to the price of fuel oil.
The purchase price of the Mexican gas compares with
a current American market price of about $2.25.
Sewage turns Bay into 'dead sea'
San Jose — A breakdown at the Santa Clara County
sewage plant, which caused the release of an estimated
billion gallons of heavily polluted wastes into the sea,
was brought partly under control yesterday.
Technicians at the plant satd they have restored some
second-stage treatment of waste water, but the facility
continues to pour millions of gallons of waste into the
Bay each day.
Shocked state officials last week called the southern
end of San Francisco Bay a pollution-stricken "dead
sea," where all wildlife has been wiped out by the mas
sive intrusions of sewage.
The damage is so severe that it could take as long as 10
years for the South Bay to recover, one official said.
State fish and game biologist Michael Rudd said, "The
southern tip of the bay is now a zone of total mortality.
Nothing is alive . . . septic is precisely the right word to
describe the situation here."
"There aren't any fish south of the Dumbarton
Bridge," said commercial fisherman Tony Otis, who first
tipped off the state that wildlife was defunct.
The Dumbarton Bridge crosses the lower bay about 35
miles south of San Francisco.
After state water quality and Fish and Game officials
trolled four miles of the bay last week, they reported
dead fish, dead shrimp and even dead birds.
T.A. Kasnick, state pollution warden investigating the
disaster, charged that officials at the $150 million treat
ment plant had been aware of a breakdown but failed to
notify the state for nearly 10 days.
Frank Belick, the sewer plant manager, said plant op
erations could be back to normal in a week. He con
ceded that he had failed to give legally required notice of
a breakdown, explaining that he thought "we had the
problem corrected."
Refugee health programs criticized
Sacramento — Legislators upbraided federal and state

officials last week over health programs for California's
100,000 Indochinese refugees.
Assemblyman Curtis Tucker (D-lnglewood), a former
public health officer, said the state has been "very
lucky" to avoid an outbreak of disease among newly
arrived refugees.
A top HEW regional official, Michael Murray, said the
government lacks funds to expand public health clinics,
and he insisted diseases such as tuberculosis, though
found among some of the newly arrived refugees, are
"not a threat to the general population."
Gov. Jerry Brown's Health and Welfare Secretary,
Mario Obledo, who has been critical of federal refugee
programs in the past, praised current federal efforts to
handle the influx of 14,000 "boat people" a month.
Nearly all are arriving in California.
But Tucker criticized the health screening process,
under which refugees get a checkup in overseas camps
but no mandatory checkup when they land .
Papal visit uproar puzzles officials
Vatican City — Church officials said last week they are
puzzled by the controversy in the United States over
Pope John Paul It's six-day American tour beginning Oct.
1.
"It's ridiculous," snapped the Rev. Vincent O'Keefe,
an American Jesuit official, reacting to the fuss over
Masses being said on public property, public funds
being used for extra police protection and construction
of platforms for rallies during the papal visit.
The United States Is the first non-Catholic country the
pontiff is visiting.
"It's a classic case of one being unable to see the forest
for the trees," said an Italian prelate, who asked not to
be identified. "The pope is not only a religious leader.
He is a world leader and a head of state. I am puzzled
why his visit cannot be perceived as a joyous and peace
ful occasion that will help bring them together."
Carter discounts poll's significance
Washington — President jimmy Carter says his low
standing in public opinion polls will have "relatively
little significance" for the outcome of the 1980 presiden
tial election.
Carter, whose approval rating stands at the lowest
point of any president in the 30-year history of opinion
polling, said the "relatively transient public opinion
polls" would count for less in an election that his
"superb" record and his character, his political organi
zation and the zeal ot his supporters.
"In this present political environment, it is almost
impossible for any president to rate high with a major
ity of Americans," he said in an interview last week.
Carter said he has not received proper credit for his
accomplishments. He said news organizations focus at
tention on his defeats and play down his victories.

"It's ridiculous," snapped the Rev. Vincent O'Keefe,
an American Jesuit official, reacting to the fuss over
Masses being said on public property, public funds
being used for extra police protection and construction
of platforms for rallies during the papal visit.
The United States Is the first non-Catholic country the
pontiff is visiting.
"It's a classic case of one being unable to see the forest
for the trees," said an Italian prelate, who asked not to
be identified. "The pope is not only a religious leader.
He is a world leader and a head of state. I am puzzled
why his visit cannot be perceived as a joyous and peace
ful occasion that will help bring them together."
Carter discounts poll's significance
Washington — President jimmy Carter says his low
standing in public opinion polls will have "relatively
little significance" for the outcome of the 1980 presiden
tial election.
Carter, whose approval rating stands at the lowest
point of any president in the 30-year history of opinion
polling, said the "relatively transient public opinion
polls" would count for less in an election that his
"superb" record and his character, his political organi
zation and the zeal ot his supporters.
"In this present political environment, it is almost
impossible for any president to rate high with a major
ity of Americans," he said in an interview last week.
Carter said he has not received proper credit for his
accomplishments. He said news organizations focus at
tention on his defeats and play down his victories.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except variable low clouds and
patchy fog near the coast spreading inland nights and
mornings. Lows in the 50s. Highs in the 60s near the
coast to the 70s and 80s inland.
U.S., Mexico agree on natural gas
Washington — Climaxing two years of difficult negotia
tions, the United States and Mexico have agreed on the
sale of Mexican natural gas to U.S. pipeline companies,
sources said last Friday.
Negotiators for both governments had pushed to
complete the elusive agreement in advance of the arrival
here Thursday of Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo,
who will confer with President Jimmy Carter on a host of
bilateral issues.
Initial imports of gas piped in from Mexico will be
small. But officials say they view the agreement as sig
nificant because it establishes rules for U.S. access to the
Mexican gas reserves, believed to be potentially among
the largest in the world.
At the outset, the sources said, Mexican gas will cost
$3,625 per thousand cubic feet, sharply lower than
Mexico's original demand of $4.95. However, the new
agreement provides for future price hikes, keyed to an
index that ties gas to the price of fuel oil.
The purchase price of the Mexican gas compares with
a current American market price of about $2.25.
Sewage turns Bay into 'dead sea'
San Jose — A breakdown at the Santa Clara County
sewage plant, which caused the release of an estimated
billion gallons of heavily polluted wastes into the sea,
was brought partly under control yesterday.
Technicians at the plant satd they have restored some
second-stage treatment of waste water, but the facility
continues to pour millions of gallons of waste into the
Bay each day.
Shocked state officials last week called the southern
end of San Francisco Bay a pollution-stricken "dead
sea," where all wildlife has been wiped out by the mas
sive intrusions of sewage.
The damage is so severe that it could take as long as 10
years for the South Bay to recover, one official said.
State fish and game biologist Michael Rudd said, "The
southern tip of the bay is now a zone of total mortality.
Nothing is alive . . . septic is precisely the right word to
describe the situation here."
"There aren't any fish south of the Dumbarton
Bridge," said commercial fisherman Tony Otis, who first
tipped off the state that wildlife was defunct.
The Dumbarton Bridge crosses the lower bay about 35
miles south of San Francisco.
After state water quality and Fish and Game officials
trolled four miles of the bay last week, they reported
dead fish, dead shrimp and even dead birds.
T.A. Kasnick, state pollution warden investigating the
disaster, charged that officials at the $150 million treat
ment plant had been aware of a breakdown but failed to
notify the state for nearly 10 days.
Frank Belick, the sewer plant manager, said plant op
erations could be back to normal in a week. He con
ceded that he had failed to give legally required notice of
a breakdown, explaining that he thought "we had the
problem corrected."
Refugee health programs criticized
Sacramento — Legislators upbraided federal and state

officials last week over health programs for California's
100,000 Indochinese refugees.
Assemblyman Curtis Tucker (D-lnglewood), a former
public health officer, said the state has been "very
lucky" to avoid an outbreak of disease among newly
arrived refugees.
A top HEW regional official, Michael Murray, said the
government lacks funds to expand public health clinics,
and he insisted diseases such as tuberculosis, though
found among some of the newly arrived refugees, are
"not a threat to the general population."
Gov. Jerry Brown's Health and Welfare Secretary,
Mario Obledo, who has been critical of federal refugee
programs in the past, praised current federal efforts to
handle the influx of 14,000 "boat people" a month.
Nearly all are arriving in California.
But Tucker criticized the health screening process,
under which refugees get a checkup in overseas camps
but no mandatory checkup when they land .
