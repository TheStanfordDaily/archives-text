# Army overruns Cards 17-13
## Stanford camouflages ability in loss 
### Chris Haft 
Each football team took separate
paths Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Army, though it rarely went great dis
tances, never got lost. Stanford, mean
while, traveled far and lost, 17-13, thus
making immediate success appear im
probable rather than definite.
Stanford appeared lost whenever its
offense approached the Cadet end
zone. Four times the Cards drove to or
within Army's 10-yard line, and three
times they got nothing to show fortheir
efforts.
Whenever they weren't mystified by
the prospect of scoring a touchdown,
the Cards displayed a reasonably effi
cient offense, gaining 403 total yards
and 24 first downs. However, the pro
duct of many yards and not enough
points equals frustration, such as that
exhibited by Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower.
"I have no explanation for our at
titude," Dowhower said. "I don't know
how you can'go up and down the field
easily and not be able to score."
The disappearance of Stanford's
running game in the second half was
equally inexplicable. Vincent White
and Mike Dotterer, the Cards' two
freshmen running backs, were quite
dashing in the first half, gaining 107
yards between them.
Then Army deployed its troops to
take away the Cards' outside running
game** Stanford chose to flounder
rather than make a similar adjustment,
thus subjecting quarterback Turk
Schonert to a suddenly ferocious Cadet
rush.
Schonert was sacked seven times for
a loss of 56 yards in the second half,
accounting mainly for the Cards' minus
three yards rushing after intermission.
Remaining diplomatit, Dowhower
directed the blame from the players to
himself. "If you want to place the blame

on someone, blame me," he said. "I
made some calls that were undoub
tedly questionable."
Kicks disdained
Two of those questionable calls, in
theory, cost the Cards six points. Early
in the second quarter Schonert led a
drive tolhe Cadet eight by completing
three passes, the last to Larry Harris for
25 yards.
From the eight the Cards tried three
running plays that gained five yards,
and on fourth and goal from the three
Dowhower decided to go for the
touchdown rather, than the sure field
goal.
Dotterer, who had swept to three
touchdowns the previous week against
San Jose State, was dragged down by
defensive back Bruce Elliott for no gain.
In a similar situation during Stan
ford's first possession of the seco.nd
half, Dowhower ordered a pass instead
of a three-point try with the Cards fac
ing a fourth-and-six on Army's 26.
Cadet tackle Stan March mangled both
the strategy and Schonert by sacking
the Card signal-caller on the 43.
Winning TD
With Army leading 10-7, Stanford's
last chances of winning were also man
gled when Cadet halfback Gerald
Walker burst through left tackle and
steamed 71 yards for a touchdown with
6:16 left to play. All the Cards could do
to Walker was salute him, as none of
them were really close enough to tackle
the fleet Cadet.
"It was an isolation play in which our
fullback blocked the linebacker," Army
coach Lou Saban explained. "Stanford
was in a double coverage on the out
side and we broke it up the middle."
"Our defense did a hell of a job, time
in and time out," commented
Schonert, who completed 18 of 29 pas
ses for 276 yards. "But when that hap
pens, something might break, and

today it did."
Killing clock
Probably the most critical series of
downs occurred at the start of the
fourth quarter. The Cards were one
play away from regaining possession,
as Army faced a third-and-13 dilemma
on its own 17. However, Walker gained
just enojugh yards needed for the first
down, thus prolonging the Cadet drive.
Army picked up five more first downs
and progressed to Stanford's five be
fore safety Rick Gervais recovered
Walker's fumble in the end zone, but
by that time only 8:32 remained.
The Cards staged a mild comeback
on Schonert's 24-yard scoring strike to
Ken Margerum with 1:44 left, but it was
another case of too little, too late.
Easy start
At the start, it appeared the only
question was how much Stanford could
exceed the 17-point spread. Linebacker
Terry Rennaker turned the first play
from scrimmage into a one-man show,
crushing Cadet quarterback Earle Mul
rane and recovering the ensuing fum
ble on the Army 10.
The Cards made the most of this
opportunity — the only time they took
advantage of a break. Whitens seven
yard run ate up most of the remaining
yardage, and two plays Hater Dotterer
sliced through right end and into
paydirt from the one.
Turnovers kill
After Army's arthritrc offense strug
gled through three plays and punted,
Stanford began the first of its long, fruit
less journeys downfield.
With Dotterer and White zipping
through a disintegrating Cadet de
fense, the Cards needed just five plays
to go from their own 37 to the Army 10.
But after Schonert's two-yard gain,
White took a pitchout and fumbled,
Army's Dale Love recovering on the
four.

With less than six minutes remaining
in the half, Army punter Charlie Adams,
the Cadets' most potent weapon up to
"that point, booted one to Andre Tyler.
Tyler waved for a fair catch, then tried
to imitate Willie Mays and catch the ball
over his shoulder. However, as Mays
seldom did, Tyler dropped the ball and
Cadet Gene Skinner recovered at the
Stanford 30. Army lurched forward to
the 14, enabling Dave Aucoin to kick a
30-yard field goal that cut Stanford's
lead to 7-3.
More nausea followed as Stanford
took the following kickoff and went
three yards in two plays. On third
and seven from the Card 23, Schonert
rolled left and threw while being hit by
nose guard Charlie Swanson. The ball
fluttered and died in the hands of
linebacker John Hilliard, whowas tack
led at Stanford's 31.
Receiving more help than a toddling
infant, Army scored its first touchdown
despite gaining only two yards on its
own. After Mulrane threw incomplete
to flanker Bill Skoda — one of the
Cadets' favorite first-half plays —
Stanford was penalized 15 yards for a
"disconcerting signal."
Moments later Cervais was called for
pass interference at the two, from
where fullback Jimmy Hill plunged for
the TD.
Stanfprd's last turnover, Dave
Charest's end-zone interception of an
ill-advised Schonert pass, ended
another meaningless Card drive with 49
seconds left in the third quarter.
"You just never know what the Army
will do," Saban said, proud and ever
so-slightly smug. "That kind of young
man will come up and rise to the occa
sion."
Based on Saturday's performance,
Stanford's kind of young man — the
kind that plays football — has lots of
rising to do.




In what is a sadly typical display of Stanford's second-half running game, Cardinal quarterback Turk Schonert (14) is sacked by Army defensive tackle Kevin Streets (75). Schonert was smothered seven times for a loss of 56 yards in the final N)
minutes, which was the reason that the Cardinal running attack was held to minus three yards rushing in the second half.
