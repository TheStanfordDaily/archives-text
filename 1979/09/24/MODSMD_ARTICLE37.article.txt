## Tulane 33-10

New Orleans — At halftimeof
the Stanford-Tulane football
game Sept. 8, the Incompara
ble Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
formed the letters "MX" on the
floor of the Louisiana Super
dome. The Band soon changed
its formation to spell "SEX,"
demonstrating that at least one
Stanford group was living up to
expectations. The Cardinals
certainly weren't, losing to the
Green Wave 33-10.
The game established a lot of
"firsts" for many people. For
Tulane, it marked the first time
it had ever defeated Stanford.
For 27 Stanford freshmen, it

gave them a distasteful indoc
trination to college football.
For Turk Schonert and LaMott
Atkins, both needed to provide
Stanford with offensive punch,
it was an exercise in frustra
tion.
Schonert's headaches began
on the first play from scrim
mage. The fifth-year senior
threw an awry lateral to
fullback Rob Moore, and
Tulane recovered the fumble at
Stanford's nine-yard line. Mo
ments later the Green Wave
surged into the end zone on a
six-yard pass from Roch Hontas
to Terry Harris.
Atkins, meanwhile, ripped
off decent-looking runs of 14
and 12 yards in the first quarter
but was otherwise stymied.

Though finishing with 26 yards
on nine carries, the friendly
sophomore appeared undis
turbed after the game. "I felt
comfortable out there to
night," Atkins said. "It just
took a couple of plays."
A couple of plays summed
up Stanford's offensive high
lights for the entire evening.
After Tulane's premature TD,
Ken Naber's 47-yard field goal
and Schonert's 63-yard scoring
bomb to Ken Margerum ele
vated the Cards to a 10-7 advan
tage in the first quarter.
Ideally, Schonert's long pass
should have portended an of
fensive storm. Instead, it pre
ceded a complete offensive
drought.
By game's end, the Cards

had four first downs, com
pared to 21 for Tulane. Stan
ford gained just six net yards
rushing and 116 overall.
"There might have been
some complacency,"
Dowhower acknowledged.
"Offensively speaking, we may
be living a year ago instead of
knowing we have to make up
for the loss of a great player
(Darrin Nelson)."
Schonert initially denied the
complacency theory, but ad
mitted in the next breath, "We
were relaxed — we might have
been too relaxed. I don't think
we expected Tulane to be as
good as they were on de
fense."
And certainly no one ex
pected Stanford to be as bad as
they were on offense.
Stanford 45-29
By Ivan Maisel
When it became evident that
Darrin Nelson would not be
ready for this fall's campaign,
Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower predicted it would
take two or three men to plug
the hole the fleet halfback left
in the Stanford offense.
Dowhower's prophecy came
true on a sunny, warm Sept. 15
as freshmen halfbacks Mike
Dotterer and Vincent White
led the Cardinals to a 45-29 vic
tory over Peninsula neighbor
San Jose State.
Dotterer used an exquisite
sense of balance and good
broken-field running to be
come the first freshman in
Stanford history to score three
touchdowns in a single game. •
The 1978 Orange County
Back of the Year snared seven
passes for 102 yards and carried
the ball eight times for 70
yards and two touchdowns.
Resembling Nelson in both
build (5-feet-9, 170 pounds)

and flair (he brought the crowd
to its feet on several occa
sions), White ran 13 times for
63 yards and one touchdown
and caught two passes for 17
yards.
The Cardinal offense that
spiritually remained in Palo
Alto while the rest of the
team traveled to New Orleans
redeemed itself a week later
against the Spartans. Control
ling the ball for almost two
thirds of the game, Stanford
ran 84 plays, gaining 449 yards.
Surprisingly, the Cards gained
273 yards on the ground and
only 176 through the air.
Hampering that aerial game
was the bruised ankle of All-
Pac-10 receiver Ken Margerum,
who watched from the
sidelines as the Cards evened
their record at 1-1.
Freshman quarterback John
Elway was also felled by ankle
problems, but not before driv
ing the Cards to their initial
touchdown. Elway had com
pleted two of three passes for
20 yards when he limped off
the field in the second quarter.
Starting quarterback Turk
Schonert performed admira
bly, completing 14 of 22 at
tempts for 156 yards and one
touchdown, a 42-yard screen
to Dotterer.
The potent San Jose State at
tack effectively riddled the
Stanford defense by gaining
458 yards.
Yet the trouble the Cardinals
faced in stopping the Spartan
attack was only surpassed by
the complications the Spartans
inflicted upon themselves. Six
costly turnovers halted San
Jose State drives and transfer
red momentum from the Spar
tans to Stanford in the second
half to turn a 29-24 San Jose
State lead into a 45-29 Cardinal
victory.

yards.
The Cardinal offense that
spiritually remained in Palo
Alto while the rest of the
team traveled to New Orleans
redeemed itself a week later
against the Spartans. Control
ling the ball for almost two
thirds of the game, Stanford
ran 84 plays, gaining 449 yards.
Surprisingly, the Cards gained
273 yards on the ground and
only 176 through the air.
Hampering that aerial game
was the bruised ankle of All-
Pac-10 receiver Ken Margerum,
who watched from the
sidelines as the Cards evened
their record at 1-1.
Freshman quarterback John
Elway was also felled by ankle
problems, but not before driv
ing the Cards to their initial
touchdown. Elway had com
pleted two of three passes for
20 yards when he limped off
the field in the second quarter.
Starting quarterback Turk
Schonert performed admira
bly, completing 14 of 22 at
tempts for 156 yards and one
touchdown, a 42-yard screen
to Dotterer.
The potent San Jose State at
tack effectively riddled the
Stanford defense by gaining
458 yards.
Yet the trouble the Cardinals
faced in stopping the Spartan
attack was only surpassed by
the complications the Spartans
inflicted upon themselves. Six
costly turnovers halted San
Jose State drives and transfer
red momentum from the Spar
tans to Stanford in the second
half to turn a 29-24 San Jose
State lead into a 45-29 Cardinal
victory.
New Orleans — At halftimeof
the Stanford-Tulane football
game Sept. 8, the Incompara
ble Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band
formed the letters "MX" on the
floor of the Louisiana Super
dome. The Band soon changed
its formation to spell "SEX,"
demonstrating that at least one
Stanford group was living up to
expectations. The Cardinals
certainly weren't, losing to the
Green Wave 33-10.
The game established a lot of
"firsts" for many people. For
Tulane, it marked the first time
it had ever defeated Stanford.
For 27 Stanford freshmen, it

gave them a distasteful indoc
trination to college football.
For Turk Schonert and LaMott
Atkins, both needed to provide
Stanford with offensive punch,
it was an exercise in frustra
tion.
Schonert's headaches began
on the first play from scrim
mage. The fifth-year senior
threw an awry lateral to
fullback Rob Moore, and
Tulane recovered the fumble at
Stanford's nine-yard line. Mo
ments later the Green Wave
surged into the end zone on a
six-yard pass from Roch Hontas
to Terry Harris.
Atkins, meanwhile, ripped
off decent-looking runs of 14
and 12 yards in the first quarter
but was otherwise stymied.

Though finishing with 26 yards
on nine carries, the friendly
sophomore appeared undis
turbed after the game. "I felt
comfortable out there to
night," Atkins said. "It just
took a couple of plays."
A couple of plays summed
up Stanford's offensive high
lights for the entire evening.
After Tulane's premature TD,
Ken Naber's 47-yard field goal
and Schonert's 63-yard scoring
bomb to Ken Margerum ele
vated the Cards to a 10-7 advan
tage in the first quarter.
Ideally, Schonert's long pass
should have portended an of
fensive storm. Instead, it pre
ceded a complete offensive
drought.
By game's end, the Cards

had four first downs, com
pared to 21 for Tulane. Stan
ford gained just six net yards
rushing and 116 overall.
"There might have been
some complacency,"
Dowhower acknowledged.
"Offensively speaking, we may
be living a year ago instead of
knowing we have to make up
for the loss of a great player
(Darrin Nelson)."
Schonert initially denied the
complacency theory, but ad
mitted in the next breath, "We
were relaxed — we might have
been too relaxed. I don't think
we expected Tulane to be as
good as they were on de
fense."
And certainly no one ex
pected Stanford to be as bad as
they were on offense.
Stanford 45-29
By Ivan Maisel
When it became evident that
Darrin Nelson would not be
ready for this fall's campaign,
Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower predicted it would
take two or three men to plug
the hole the fleet halfback left
in the Stanford offense.
Dowhower's prophecy came
true on a sunny, warm Sept. 15
as freshmen halfbacks Mike
Dotterer and Vincent White
led the Cardinals to a 45-29 vic
tory over Peninsula neighbor
San Jose State.
Dotterer used an exquisite
sense of balance and good
broken-field running to be
come the first freshman in
Stanford history to score three
touchdowns in a single game. •
The 1978 Orange County
Back of the Year snared seven
passes for 102 yards and carried
the ball eight times for 70
yards and two touchdowns.
Resembling Nelson in both
build (5-feet-9, 170 pounds)

and flair (he brought the crowd
to its feet on several occa
sions), White ran 13 times for
63 yards and one touchdown
and caught two passes for 17
yards.
