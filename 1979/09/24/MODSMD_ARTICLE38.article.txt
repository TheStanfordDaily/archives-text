# Lodge's men win three
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The year 1978 was a miles
tone for men's soccer at Stan
ford. Nelson Lodge's squad
compiled a 16-5 regular season
mark, good for third place in
the Pacific Soccer Conference
and the first Cardinal NCAA
soccer playoff berth in 16
years.
Yes, 1978 will be vividly re
membered. That is, unless the
predictions for' 79 come true to
overshadow" last year's
achievements. Lodge foresees
a three-team race Vor this sea
son's PSC title.
Although the Cards dropped
both the regular season and
regional playoff games to the
University of San Francisco last
year, revenge is well within
reach according to Lodge.
"It is possible to beat USF,"
he explained. "We have
strength and the bench and
they're vulnerable. And watch

out for Santa Clara. San Jose
State is a contender, but we're
a goal better."
USF's vulnerability was
proved this weekend as the
Dons were upset 3-2 by Santa
Clara at Kezar Stadium —
Lodge accurately picked the
margin of victory for the Bron
cos after Saturday's 10-0 Card
win over the University of the
Pacific.
In last season's opening
match, the Cards beat UOP 4-3
in overtime. With the excep
tion of "missing one good mid
fielder," according to Lodge,
the same UOP team traveled to
Harry Maloney Field Saturday.
This time the game's outcome
seemed clear even before the
first Stanford score.
Admittedly, the Tigers are
0-7 this season, but they are a
decent team. According to
Lodge, who played substitutes
freely, no team had broken

open a game with the Tigers
like Stanford did.
Lodge pointed out that one
difference between the two
seasons' scores was that Satur
day's meeting was the fourth
on the schedule.
"We've made big changes
since the L.A. State game," he
said. "We weren't ready last
year."
Yet the quality of Stanford's
play seemed to show more
than just three games worth of
experience. The Cards simply
dominated the match, with the
defense limiting UOP to only a
single shot on goal and the of
fense wearing down two
Tiger goalkeepers.
Lai rd Cagan started the Stan
ford onslaught seven minutes
into the game with an unas
sisted goal. Rookie Willie
Guicce chalked up a hat trick,
