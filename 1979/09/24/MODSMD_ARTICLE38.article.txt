# Lodge's men win three
## 
### Dean Eyre 
The year 1978 was a miles
tone for men's soccer at Stan
ford. Nelson Lodge's squad
compiled a 16-5 regular season
mark, good for third place in
the Pacific Soccer Conference
and the first Cardinal NCAA
soccer playoff berth in 16
years.
Yes, 1978 will be vividly re
membered. That is, unless the
predictions for' 79 come true to
overshadow" last year's
achievements. Lodge foresees
a three-team race Vor this sea
son's PSC title.
Although the Cards dropped
both the regular season and
regional playoff games to the
University of San Francisco last
year, revenge is well within
reach according to Lodge.
"It is possible to beat USF,"
he explained. "We have
strength and the bench and
they're vulnerable. And watch

out for Santa Clara. San Jose
State is a contender, but we're
a goal better."
USF's vulnerability was
proved this weekend as the
Dons were upset 3-2 by Santa
Clara at Kezar Stadium —
Lodge accurately picked the
margin of victory for the Bron
cos after Saturday's 10-0 Card
win over the University of the
Pacific.
In last season's opening
match, the Cards beat UOP 4-3
in overtime. With the excep
tion of "missing one good mid
fielder," according to Lodge,
the same UOP team traveled to
Harry Maloney Field Saturday.
This time the game's outcome
seemed clear even before the
first Stanford score.
Admittedly, the Tigers are
0-7 this season, but they are a
decent team. According to
Lodge, who played substitutes
freely, no team had broken

open a game with the Tigers
like Stanford did.
Lodge pointed out that one
difference between the two
seasons' scores was that Satur
day's meeting was the fourth
on the schedule.
"We've made big changes
since the L.A. State game," he
said. "We weren't ready last
year."
Yet the quality of Stanford's
play seemed to show more
than just three games worth of
experience. The Cards simply
dominated the match, with the
defense limiting UOP to only a
single shot on goal and the of
fense wearing down two
Tiger goalkeepers.
Lai rd Cagan started the Stan
ford onslaught seven minutes
into the game with an unas
sisted goal. Rookie Willie
Guicce chalked up a hat trick,
'°gg' n g back-to-back scores 18
and 20 minutes into the half,
the first assisted by Jon Hecht.
Cuicce's third goal came with
three minutes remaining in the
game, on an assist by Dan
McNevin.
Other Card tallies were
added by McNevin, Greg De-
Igado (assisted by Andre
Mann), and a pair apiece by
Tom Sweet (assists by
Rafalovich and Guicce) and
Rafalovich (unassisted, Lin
nett).
Lodge was particularly
pleased with the solid defense,
responsible for three shutouts
in four games; keeper Craig
Ueland only touched the ball a
couple of times and has a 0.23
goals-against average. Most
importantly, there is continuity
between the defense and of
fense.
"The wing fullbacks are over
lapping much more and they
see the through pass to the
middle," Lodge said. The for
wards are coming back more to
pick up passes, but the team
needs more work on plays like
corner kicks, Lodge said.
A solid core of players re
turns this season, including the
magical McNevin-Rafalovich
combination, but there are
some new names to re

member.
So far in games and/or in
practice, Guicce, Canadian
Abe Drassinower, Jeff Jones
and Mark Talkington have
proved themselves as rookies
to be reckoned with.
Another rookie with the
Cards has already proven him
self on the field, but now takes
on different responsibilities.
This newcomer to Stanford
soccer is Tony Igwe, a standout
on three national champion
teams while at USF and now
the Card assistant coach.
Looking ahead at the Card
schedule, Stanford heads off to
UC-Davis Wednesday for a 4
p.m. game. Although the Ag
gies are a "good opponent,"
and "all games are critical,"
Lodge cited the October 1
Washington game and late
season meetings with such
teams as Santa Clara and de
fending NCAA champ USF as
key ones.
After recording a 2-1 win
over Cal State-LA, a scoreless
tie with LJnited States Interna
tional University and a 3-0 vic
tory against Portland, the
Cards sport a 3-0-1 overall mark
and stand 1-0 in conference
competition with the UOP
shutout.

single shot on goal and the of
fense wearing down two
Tiger goalkeepers.
Lai rd Cagan started the Stan
ford onslaught seven minutes
into the game with an unas
sisted goal. Rookie Willie
Guicce chalked up a hat trick,
'°gg' n g back-to-back scores 18
and 20 minutes into the half,
the first assisted by Jon Hecht.
Cuicce's third goal came with
three minutes remaining in the
game, on an assist by Dan
McNevin.
Other Card tallies were
added by McNevin, Greg De-
Igado (assisted by Andre
Mann), and a pair apiece by
Tom Sweet (assists by
Rafalovich and Guicce) and
Rafalovich (unassisted, Lin
nett).
Lodge was particularly
pleased with the solid defense,
responsible for three shutouts
in four games; keeper Craig
Ueland only touched the ball a
couple of times and has a 0.23
goals-against average. Most
importantly, there is continuity
between the defense and of
fense.
"The wing fullbacks are over
lapping much more and they
see the through pass to the
middle," Lodge said. The for
wards are coming back more to
pick up passes, but the team
needs more work on plays like
corner kicks, Lodge said.
A solid core of players re
turns this season, including the
magical McNevin-Rafalovich
combination, but there are
some new names to re

member.
So far in games and/or in
practice, Guicce, Canadian
Abe Drassinower, Jeff Jones
and Mark Talkington have
proved themselves as rookies
to be reckoned with.
Another rookie with the
Cards has already proven him
self on the field, but now takes
on different responsibilities.
This newcomer to Stanford
soccer is Tony Igwe, a standout
on three national champion
teams while at USF and now
the Card assistant coach.
Looking ahead at the Card
schedule, Stanford heads off to
UC-Davis Wednesday for a 4
p.m. game. Although the Ag
gies are a "good opponent,"
and "all games are critical,"
Lodge cited the October 1
Washington game and late
season meetings with such
teams as Santa Clara and de
fending NCAA champ USF as
key ones.
After recording a 2-1 win
over Cal State-LA, a scoreless
tie with LJnited States Interna
tional University and a 3-0 vic
tory against Portland, the
Cards sport a 3-0-1 overall mark
and stand 1-0 in conference
competition with the UOP
shutout.
The year 1978 was a miles
tone for men's soccer at Stan
ford. Nelson Lodge's squad
compiled a 16-5 regular season
mark, good for third place in
the Pacific Soccer Conference
and the first Cardinal NCAA
soccer playoff berth in 16
years.
Yes, 1978 will be vividly re
membered. That is, unless the
predictions for' 79 come true to
overshadow" last year's
achievements. Lodge foresees
a three-team race Vor this sea
son's PSC title.
Although the Cards dropped
both the regular season and
regional playoff games to the
University of San Francisco last
year, revenge is well within
reach according to Lodge.
"It is possible to beat USF,"
he explained. "We have
strength and the bench and
they're vulnerable. And watch

out for Santa Clara. San Jose
State is a contender, but we're
a goal better."
USF's vulnerability was
proved this weekend as the
Dons were upset 3-2 by Santa
Clara at Kezar Stadium —
Lodge accurately picked the
margin of victory for the Bron
cos after Saturday's 10-0 Card
win over the University of the
Pacific.
In last season's opening
match, the Cards beat UOP 4-3
in overtime. With the excep
tion of "missing one good mid
fielder," according to Lodge,
the same UOP team traveled to
Harry Maloney Field Saturday.
This time the game's outcome
seemed clear even before the
first Stanford score.
Admittedly, the Tigers are
0-7 this season, but they are a
decent team. According to
Lodge, who played substitutes
freely, no team had broken

open a game with the Tigers
like Stanford did.
Lodge pointed out that one
difference between the two
seasons' scores was that Satur
day's meeting was the fourth
on the schedule.
"We've made big changes
since the L.A. State game," he
said. "We weren't ready last
year."
Yet the quality of Stanford's
play seemed to show more
than just three games worth of
experience. The Cards simply
dominated the match, with the
defense limiting UOP to only a
single shot on goal and the of
fense wearing down two
Tiger goalkeepers.
