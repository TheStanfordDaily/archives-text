# Tight housing squeezes students
## 
### Andrea James 
Homeless students are sleeping on cots in a small
fraternity library near Campus Drive because there isn't
enough on-campus or reasonably-prfced off-campus
housing to immediately accomodate them. "
Half a dozen cots and some sleeping bags are piled in
Breer Library, a small reading room adjacent to the
fraternity cluster behind Florence Moore dormitory
complex, said Norm Robinson, associate dean of resi
dential education.
The "crash pad" along with thfc guest rooms scattered
throughout campus will be made available to "home
less" students until the second week of fall quarter.
The students in Breer Library sleep there and use
shower facilities at the University gyms, Robinson said.
About five persons stay there every night, but the library
could sleep about 15 to 20 people, he added.
Such "crash pads" will probably be operated every
quarter, Robinson said. Housing staff members are cur
rently arranging temporary student billets with Palo Alto
residents until the housing crunch is alleviated.
Waiting list long
As of last Friday, 260 single students were still on the
waiting list for on-campus housing although all facilities

were full, reported lean Kitaji, housing office super
visor. She added, however, that this is not an unusually
high figure and that most of the waiting students have
found off-campus housing.
At Escondido Village, the University-operated hous
ing complex for married students, 73 couples are on the
waiting list for the one-bedroom apartments and 52 for
the two-bedroom flats. That's about a six-month wait,
housing staff members said.
Those students who have yet to obtain off-campus
housing are in for "real trouble," reported Ferrill Roll,
director of the Clearinghouse, an organization set up by
the Dean of Student Affairs to aid students in their hous
ing searches.
"Either students are going to have to pay extremely
high rents or they're going to have to live several miles
away from campus," s«id the spokesman for the
Clearinghouse.
Off-campus chances slim
Available housing became so scarce last week that
groups of friends who had desi red to live together were
forced to part company and take the few uninhabited
single rooms scattered throughout Palo Alto and Menlo

Park.
Although the Clearinghouse closes its doors tomor
row, the Single Student Housing Office will continue to
post notices of existing housing opportunities. Other
listings run in classified sections 6f local newspapers.
But according to one Menlo Park landlady, rental
openings are short-lived.
"I've had 25 calls within three days," she said.
Students who do find a place to live near campus are
paying higher-than-ever prices for smaller-than-ever
rooms, Roll said. Palo Alto and Menlo Park residents can
expect tu pay, on the average, $190 to $200 a month rent.

Four-bedroom unfurnished houses near campus rent
for an average $800 a month and are advertised for as
much as $1,650 a month rent.
In Redwood City, seven miles north of Palo Alto, ren
tals are slightly less expensive, running about $175 per
person per month.
Palo Alto residents have complained about the high
rents, and the Palo Alto Human Relations Commission is
sponsoring a public hearing .Thursday night on rental
housing costs in the area. The meeting convenes at 7:30
p.m. in City Council chambers, 250 Hamilton Ave.
Testimony received at the hearing will be forwarded to
the City Council for possible consideration of an ordi
nance to limit rent increases in Palo Alto.
