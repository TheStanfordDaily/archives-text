## What's wrong? 
### Ivan Maisel 
To the 43,345 who witnessed Saturday's "shocking" 17-13 loss
to Army, it was obvious that Stanford was the better team. It was;
however, just as painfully obvious that something very wrong was
plaguing this better team.
In the Cardinals' post-game locker room, putting a finger on
that something wrong was as elusive as was the end zone during,
the game. But all queried realized it had something to do with
attitude.
That's attitude as in doing whatever it takes to win. Alabama
head coach Bear Bryant calls it a "gut check." Others call it
character or determination. Saturday, the Cardinals were watch
ing it on the opposite sideline and wishing they had it.
As he liberated his left knee from a multitude of bandages,
starting center and game co-captain )ohn Macaulay seemed as
puzzled as everyone else.
"We're just sitting around waiting for things to happen," the"
junior said. "Everyone is looking at everyone else for something
to happen.
"When we got the first TD (after recovering an Army fumble on
the first play of the game), everyone just said 'Let's put it in cruise
control' and thought we would score eight TDs like that. It
doesn't work like that," Macaulay added.
"We're not as poised as last season," wide receiver Ken
Margerum said. "There are certain instances in games where alf
of a sudden we're not together mentally. Last year there was
electricity in the huddle."

1978 women's volleyball action. Playing in Roble Gym, where the
lighting is bad for photography, Stanford trounced Weber State 15-7,
15-6 and 15-9 Friday and outlasted Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo 4-15,
15.-12, 13-15, 15-13 and 15-5 Saturday.
