# What happened this summer? Graduation, a walkout...
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
June 17 — The corks popped,
the champagne flowed and the
graduates toasted their parents
as Stanford's class of 1979 re
ceived their degrees in a sunny
Frost Amphitheatre.
The intellectual fareof the af
ternoon was provided by
then-Ambassador to the Un
ited Nations Andrew Young,
who exhorted graduates to
help break down the barriers
to world communication and
trade.
Asserting that Americans
should view Third World re
volutions as outgrowths of the
American Revolution, Young
said that the people in those
countries want the freedom
that Americans sought and ob
tained in 1776.
"The high ideals and expec
tations" of these nations,
Young said, "are reaching in
the direction of human rights
and freedom." Graduates
should therefore strive to
"build understanding relation
ships that enable us to cooper

ate on a worldwide scale," he
said.
The 2800 graduates who
were, in the words of President
Richard Lyman, "filled with
good spirits," gave Young a
standing ovation before de
parting to the strains of "All
Right Now," rendered by the
rather understaffed but en
thusiastic graduation ensem
ble.
SCIP walk-out
June 26 — Alleged building
hazards and poor working
conditions prompted workers
at the new Stanford Center for
Information Processing (SCIP)
to walk out of their new and
uncompleted building this
morning.
The workers complained
that on-going construction
work inside the building
created unsafe working condi
tions. The removal of floor tiles
for computer installations plus
pervasive paint fumes and a
lack of air conditioning made
work uncomfortable, they
said..
A week later, however,
workers said that conditions
were much improved, but a
controversy erupted over the
workers' right to collect wages
during the walkout.

Under the union contract at
the time of the walkout the
workers were entitled to walk
out if conditions were found to
be unsafe. Complications de
veloped when workers insisted
that conditions had been im
proved while they were away
and before inspectors had had
a chance to investigate the
building.
Tension finally abated, and
SCIP is once again fully opera
tional and now offers an in
teresting look at state-of-the
art data processing systems in a
modern setting..
Tut mania strikes
June 26 — As the King Tut
craze reached its peak, Stan
ford played host tcvan irreve
rent look at the cultmania sur
rounding the boy king. Tut-
Tut, an exhibit of Egyptomania
with examples dating to early
19th century America, opened
here.
Brainchild of Museum Direc
tor and Art Department Chair
man Lorenz Eitner, the sum
mer exhibition was designed as
a "survey of Egyptomania and
its cultural influence on Europe
and the United States over the
last two centuries."
The why and what of the
exhibit was proffered by typed

placards along the walls and
on individual showcases. One
informs the visitor that "It (the
fact that Tut equals cash) has
been triumphantly confirmed
by the King Tut exhibition in
which the visitor is made to
step from the gallery directly
into the gift shop, often larger

and more glittering than the
exhibition itself.
"Tomb and shop, boy-king
and salesgirl, grave robber and
museum specialist have come
together, after these many mil
lenia, in a happy and profitable
fusion."


Andrew Young urges graduates to forge new links of trade and
friendship with other countries in his commencement speech. The
2800 student l * graduated in high spirits and fejt "All Right Now."'


Tut mania among consumers and museum-goers has produced a
equal response from manufacturers seeking to cash in on the craze.

exhibit here during the summer.
