# What happened this summer? Graduation, a walkout...
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
June 17 — The corks popped,
the champagne flowed and the
graduates toasted their parents
as Stanford's class of 1979 re
ceived their degrees in a sunny
Frost Amphitheatre.
The intellectual fareof the af
ternoon was provided by
then-Ambassador to the Un
ited Nations Andrew Young,
who exhorted graduates to
help break down the barriers
to world communication and
trade.
Asserting that Americans
should view Third World re
volutions as outgrowths of the
American Revolution, Young
said that the people in those
countries want the freedom
that Americans sought and ob
tained in 1776.
"The high ideals and expec
tations" of these nations,
Young said, "are reaching in
the direction of human rights
and freedom." Graduates
should therefore strive to
"build understanding relation
ships that enable us to cooper

ate on a worldwide scale," he
said.
The 2800 graduates who
were, in the words of President
Richard Lyman, "filled with
good spirits," gave Young a
standing ovation before de
parting to the strains of "All
Right Now," rendered by the
rather understaffed but en
thusiastic graduation ensem
ble.
SCIP walk-out
June 26 — Alleged building
hazards and poor working
conditions prompted workers
at the new Stanford Center for
Information Processing (SCIP)
to walk out of their new and
uncompleted building this
morning.
The workers complained
that on-going construction
work inside the building
created unsafe working condi
tions. The removal of floor tiles
for computer installations plus
pervasive paint fumes and a
lack of air conditioning made
work uncomfortable, they
said..
A week later, however,
workers said that conditions
were much improved, but a
controversy erupted over the
workers' right to collect wages
during the walkout.

Under the union contract at
the time of the walkout the
workers were entitled to walk
out if conditions were found to
be unsafe. Complications de
veloped when workers insisted
that conditions had been im
proved while they were away
and before inspectors had had
a chance to investigate the
building.
Tension finally abated, and
SCIP is once again fully opera
tional and now offers an in
teresting look at state-of-the
art data processing systems in a
modern setting..
Tut mania strikes
June 26 — As the King Tut
craze reached its peak, Stan
ford played host tcvan irreve
rent look at the cultmania sur
rounding the boy king. Tut-
Tut, an exhibit of Egyptomania
with examples dating to early
19th century America, opened
here.
Brainchild of Museum Direc
tor and Art Department Chair
man Lorenz Eitner, the sum
mer exhibition was designed as
a "survey of Egyptomania and
its cultural influence on Europe
and the United States over the
last two centuries."
The why and what of the
exhibit was proffered by typed

placards along the walls and
on individual showcases. One
informs the visitor that "It (the
fact that Tut equals cash) has
been triumphantly confirmed
by the King Tut exhibition in
which the visitor is made to
step from the gallery directly
into the gift shop, often larger

and more glittering than the
exhibition itself.
"Tomb and shop, boy-king
and salesgirl, grave robber and
museum specialist have come
together, after these many mil
lenia, in a happy and profitable
fusion."


Andrew Young urges graduates to forge new links of trade and
friendship with other countries in his commencement speech. The
2800 student l * graduated in high spirits and fejt "All Right Now."'


Tut mania among consumers and museum-goers has produced a
equal response from manufacturers seeking to cash in on the craze.

just one of the numerous fabrications displayed at the Tut-Tut
exhibit here during the summer.
Seven arrested
July 3 — As the debate over
the Rancho Seco nuclear
power plant proceeded, pro
test proliferated in Sac
ramento, site of most of the de
liberations on the plant's re
opening.
Seven Stanford students
were arrested in the offices of
the Sacramento Municipal Util
ity District (SMUD) and
charged with trespassing and
failure to disperse. Thirteen
others from around the state
were also arrested.
Arraigned two days later, the
accused pleaded no contest
and were sentenced to two
days in jail. As they had already
served that time, all were re
leased.
Jordan retires
July 3 — Payton Jordan, one
of the world's most respected
track and field coaches, retired
after 23 years at the University.
"I've had a very fulfilling and
eventful life in coaching," Jor
dan said, "but it's best to step
aside and do other things. I'm
retiring from coaching, but I'm
not retiring per se. I still feel I
have quite a bit to give."
Jordan, 62, was head coach
of the 1968 U.S. Olympic track
team, which won more Olym
pic medals and established
more records than any other
team in history.
Here Jordan has produced
seven Olympians, six world re
cord holders and six national
champions.
He was also a competitor
himself, donning his cleats
again seven years ago to set 24
world sprint records in the 50
to 62 age group.
Jordan will not be leaving
permanently. He is scheduled
to return after a year's leave of
absence to work in Athletic
Department public relations
and event promotions.

Wall stalls
July 13 — Unlike Christo's
Running Fence, which can
tered over the Marin County
countryside, the Albers Wall,
located in front of the Physics
Tank, is going nowhere.
Plagued by supply problems,
only 25 percent of the wall is
completed. Properly cut bricks
are not readily available, and
the chrome-finished bars de
signated for the decoration of
the wall do not meet the stan
dards set by the architects.
Miller goes to SRI
July 16 — Former vice
president and provost of the
University William Miller, 53,
was appointed president, chief
executive officer and director
of SRI International.
"I consider this to be an out
standing opportunity," Miller
said. "SRI International is rec
ognized both nationally and in
ternationally as a first-class re
search institute devoted to
some of the most important
problem areas of our time. I
look forward with great en
thusiasm to joining the staff."
SRI International, formerly
the Stanford Research Insti
tute, is the second largest in
dependent, non-profit re
search organization in the Un
ited States.
New law sculpture
July 17 — Art Department
professor Albert Elsen has an
nounced that plans are under
way to bring a new sculpture to
Crown Quadrangle at the Law
School.
Named "Le Faucon" (The
Falcon), the work was created
in 1963 by the late Alexander
Calder and consists of three
large connecting pieces of
curved metal painted black.
In 1966, Calder said that the
sculpture, when "seen from
another point of view, be-

comes a kind of dragon, al
though I had no such idea."
36 workers fired
July 27 — The entire staff of
the Coffee House at Tresidder
Union was fired without
notice.
Thirty-six employees, includ
ing two managers, were as
sembled at a meeting to dis
cuss renovations of the Coffee
House when they received
notice of their employment
termination.
One week later the angry
workers opened an al
ternative to the Coffee House,
named the True Coffee House,
mounted on a cart outside Tre
sidder.
The reason for the firings is
still disputed, with no consis
tent explanation yet from TDS,
Inc., the company responsible
forTresidder food services and
the Coffee House. See related
story on front page.
Secret letter printed
July 27 — The Stanford
Daily published the full text of
a letter which the United States
Department of Energy (DOE)
has classified "Secret/
Restricted."

Laboratories in Chicago to sev
eral congressmen and news
papers, contains classified in
formation. But seven student
newspapers, led by The Daily
Californian ■in Berkeley,
numerous scientists and Con
gressman Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) disagree.
The letter protests DOE's use
of classification powers, speci
fically in regard to its classifica
tion of material in a Progressive
magazine article on the hydro
gen bomb. It charges that the
government, by attempting to
prevent publication of the arti
cle, is trying to establish a legal
precedent for prior restraint on
the media.
The letter calls for a congres

The Argonne letter was clas

written and delivered.
Workers organize
August 1 — University office
workers began to organize as
over 250 workers signed union
authorization cards and
formed the Stanford University
Office Staff Organizing Com
mittee.
"We are going to do our best
to organize," said Florence
Miller, provisional chairperson
of the organizing committee.
Miller, a secretary at the
School of Education, said
"You're like Alice in Wonder
land" when discussing salary
hikes with the University be
cause it fabricates and revises
the rules as the game is played.
According to Natalie Fisher,
secretary of the committee,
there is "no decent grievance
procedure for clerical work
ers." She said that workers can
only obtain outside arbitration
after their dismissal, a proce
dure which is "an awful hassle"
for the worker.
Committee members also
spoke of sexual harassment on
the job, of sexual discrimina
tion and of a lack of job sec
urity.
Earthquake
August 6 — One of the
strongest earthquakes to hit
Northern California in this cen

tury rocked a 350-mile wedge
of the state in two sweeps of at
least 15 seconds each, toppling
light poles, cutting off power
and shaking skyscrapers.
There were no immediate
reports of serious injuries, and
damage was minor.
No injuries were reported
here at the University, but Prof.
Frank Dickson, chairman of the
geology department said that
one arch along the outer edge
of the Quad, facing Skilling
Auditorium, was falling. Its
keystone slipped up to an inch
from its original position.

Notable speakers
The number of news organi
zations willing to prepare and
devote the talent to cover
foreign affairs and interna
tional news is too small, said
Elie Abel, recently appointed
Chandler Professor of Com
munication here.
One ot several speakers to
visit the campus this summer,
Abel told about 300 members
of the Peninsula World Affairs
Council that reporters who
serve overseas are "several I
cuts above average, but they
are in short supply.

"News organizations have
realized that they have to de
velop their own specialists in
areas such as urban affairs and
business and that coverage of
foreign affairs requires its own
specialists," Abel said.
In a lighter vein, Norman
Lear related his experiences in
the world of comedy televi
sion. He attributed his success
to the production of the exact
material networks don't want
— anything new.

"Trends come very slowly in
this field — they seep in," Lear
said in an informal lecture at
the Mass Media Institute,
sponsored by the Communica
tion Department.
He tests the viability of a
show by his personal reaction
to it. "If it makes me laugh, I
think it will make you laugh. If
it makes me cry, I think it will
make you cry. I work very hard
at keeping in touch with my
audiences."


More than 250 clerical workers meet to discuss the possibility of
forming a collective bargaining unit to negotiate with the University
for higher pay and better working conditions.
