# Long Islanders are burning crosses, painting swastikas
##

Yaphank, N.Y. (AP) â€” In a lazy Long Island
summer, people like to sail around the
Sound, play on Jones Beach or in the
Hamptons, and pick berries at Montauk
Point. But this summer was different.
People burned crosses in front of black
owned houses, painted swastikas on Jewish
properties, and threw racist pamphlets in
the streets of mixed neighborhoods.
Police officials were quick to dismiss the
incidents as youthful summer fun, and 12
youths have been arrested in two crossburn
ings.
From carving hearts
"They used to write 'John loves Mary' on
fences or throw rocks at lampposts," said Sgt.
William Gutersloh, a Nassau County police
spokesman. "Today they paint swastikas or
burn crosses. Kids are simply reflecting their
times."
But civil rights leaders and community of
ficials fear that more than childish pranks are
involved, and they are becoming increas
ingly alarmed.
"It was an Up South summer in Long Is
land," said Kenneth Anderson, regional di
rector of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),
alluding to the North's view of southern
ways. A 4-foot cross was burned at Ander
son's Port Jefferson home this month.

An awesome sight
"The cross in my yard was awesome to
confront," he said. "It was the symbol of the
white robes, the pointed hoods, the actions
of the most racist organization that has ever
existed in this country, the KKK."
With a dozen crossburnings across Long
Island by late summer, accompanied by
three times as many related racial incidents,
state and federal agencies moved in.
The FBI announced it was entering the
investigation "in full force," and the Justice
Department said it was following the inci
dents "very, very closely."
Not childish
Zachary Carter, assistant U.S. attorney in
Brooklyn, said, "These cannot be written off
as pranks."
Here in Yaphank, the Suffolk County seat,
a quiet community of potato farmers, to
mato growers and rural storekeepers, racial
tension seems far away. Only about 10 per
cent of Suffolk's 1.3 million people are
minorities, and none was visible in Yaphank
during a recent visit.
Residents still talk about the days when
their town was the site of Camp Upton, an
army assembly point during World War I.
Irving Berlin wrote the ditty "Yip, Yip,
Yaphank, Goodbye" for the departing

doughboys and won the town a measure of
national fame.
Not very deep
But the racial tensions are riot far below
the surface. County Police Commissioner
Donald Dilworth said that a cross was
burned at a black home last year by the
brother of a white girl asked to a dance by a
black neighbor.
"I think he figured he had to save the
family honor," Dilworth said.
Black leaders trace overt racism to the
early part of the century when a klavern of
the Ku Klux Klan was said to ride around
Yaphank. But in the years that followed, Suf
folk County and the rest of Long Island
seemed models for racial harmony.
Newsday shocked
When the racial incident broke out this
summer, the Long Island newspaper News
day said in a shocked editorial "Crossburn
ing . . . tirebombing . . . swastika painting
. . . Can this be Long Island oh the verge of
the 1980sr
The answer from many black leaders was
yes.
"Let's face it," said Anderson. "Long Is
land is embarrassingly white. The majority of
blacks and Hispanics have been steered to

enclaves. It is the unspoken code of the real
estate men: Keep the white areas white."
Evidence mounts
His view was born out in Valley Stream, a
virtually all-white middle-class community
where a Jamaican immigrant, Inga Grant,
chose to live with her seven children. A
standing-room only meeting was held in an
American Legion hall by residents con
cerned about her arrival. A week later, a
cross was burned on the yard of her neat
home on Woodlawn Avenue. Threatening
letters arrived.
Neighbors interviewed later protested
that Grant's arrival was part of a blockbust
ing scheme that would have moved more
blacks into the neighborhood. Stewart
Robinson, a retired naval officer who has
lived on the block for 20 years, said, "We
never had any blacks around here before.
People here just dori't want them."
Blacks angry
Such sentiments anger black officials.
"Blacks leave Manhattan for Long Island in
search of the American dream, like so many
thousands of whites have done," said the
NAACP's Anderson. "But they end up in
Roosevelt, or Amityville, or in Hempstead in
less integrated communities than they have
left."

Anderson is also angry at the suggestion
that the incidents are childish pranks. "This
lays a bum rap on children. Kids act out of
learned behavior. By blaming it on their
kids, it offers adults the opportunity not to
deal with the racist world in which we live."
Some observers believe inflation is fan
ning the fires of racism on Long Island as
white homeowners worry about property
values. "The middle class is getting a taste of
poverty," said Ellen Ross, a social worker
who found a charred 6-foot cross on her
property in Setauket. "They are taking out
their frustrations on the blacks and the
]ews."
Officials crack down
Officials say they are cracking down on
the racism.
"We will not tolerate the cowardly, de
spicable acts we have seen increasingly in
the past few weeks," said Police Commis
sioner Dilworth. He has established a 24-
hour hotline to a civil rights desk. Prosecu
tions can be made under the Fair Housing
Act that prohibits intimidation of anyone
buying or living in a home.
The racist symbol of the burning crosses is
chillingly effective. "My reaction was one ot
total disbelief when I found it," said victim
Ellen Ross. "It happens down South, but it
doesn't happen to you."
