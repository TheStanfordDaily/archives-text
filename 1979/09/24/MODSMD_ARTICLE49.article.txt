# Flood hits Law library, books in freeze
##

More than 6000 law books are now
stacked in a San Jose ice house await
ing demoisturizing as a result of a
September 7 flood at the Law School
which soaked parts of three floors of
the library and faculty offices.
This was the third flood in less than
a year to hit a Stanford library. A fire
main pump ibreakdown at Meyer
Library last November drenched
50,000 volumes and a fire sprinkler
malfunction last May at Green Lib
rary damaged newly installed carpet
ing in the still unoccupied building
but no books.
The law books, the maritime law
and international law collection, will
not be permanently damaged, ac
cording to Sally Buchanan, Meyer
library conservation officer.
The books will be kept frozen to
prevent mildewing until they can be
taken to a vacuum chamber where
the moisture can be withdrawn. This
technique worked successfully on
the Meyer Library books.
Personal papers
A special collection of personal
papers of the famed New York fed
eral justice Learned Hand will also
undergo the freeze-drying
technique. The papers, on loan from
Harvard so that Law School professor
Gerald Gunther can write a biog
raphy of Hand, were kept in a storage
room on the thi rd floor of the library
and were only slightly exposed to the
water.
Another 60,000 of the law library's
collection of 300,000 books are in
random order on shelves in the lib
rary basement but are damaged. Be
cause of the possibility that these
books had absorbed moisture from
the air they were watched forsix days
to determine that mold was not
forming. It will be a month or more
before these volumes can be re
shelved in proper order, according
to law librarian J. Myron Jacobstein.

The water dripped through con
crete ceilings to three floors of the
law school building from the roof
where a soldered joint on a two and
one-half inch brass pipe carrying
chilled water for the air cooling sys
tem broke open. Between 20,000 and
30,000 gallons of water — enough to
fill a backyard swimming pool — es
caped and ran down the drain system
or soaked into the building.
Carpet ruined
Ceiling tiles and carpeting were
ruined by the water but no other
damage was done to the building.
The Law School library was open for
use three days after the incident.
Classes at the Law School had started
the day prior to the flood.
University Director of Risk Man
agement Robert Beth estimated
that the damage at $150,000. He said
he guesses that damage to books will
amount to $75,000, the cleanup will
cost $25,000, and another $50,000 will
pay for the replacement of carpeting
and ceiling tiles.
The dripping water on the third
floor was discovered at about 8:30
p.m. that Friday evening by a second
year law student. He heard two dull
thuds which he later found to be two
ceiling tiles falling.
He alerted the reference librarian,
Joan Howland, and several students
started to move books. Within a few
minutes, water was dripping all over
the third floor stacks. Students at an
orientation dance being held
elsewhere in the building and stu
dents from Crothers Hall im
mediately came to help.
Nearly a hundred students, staff
and faculty members helped move
books off some shelves and drape
sheets of plastic over others, many of
them working until 3 a.m. The next
day they helped wrap books in
freezer paper and send them to the
Union Ice. Co. in San Jose.
