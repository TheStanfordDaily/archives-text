# Last-hour contract averts USE strike
## 
### Bill Burger Senior Staff Writer 
A federally mediated marathon
bargaining session and last minute
contract agreement between the
University and United Stanford
Employees (USE) last week averted a
probable walkout of the 1400-
member union of technical, mainte
nance and service workers. A strike
would have severely limited many
University operations.
Two months of negotiations bet
ween the two sides had seen few
substantive issues resolved, and it
had appeared likely that major issues
concerning pay and benefits could
be settled before Monday, Sept. 17,
the date a strike seemed likely to be
gin.
By 5 a.m. on thatday, however, the
agreement was reached, and the
union membership voted 509 to 354
the following day to ratify the three
year agreement.
The union had been working with
out a contract since August 31.
The new pact calls for a 24.75 per
cent wage iricrease over three years,
plus a cost-of-living increase of up to
15 cents per hour in the third year.
The wage increases include 8.75
percent in the first year, retroactive
to Sept. 1, and 8 percent in both 1980
and 1981.
First dental plan
A fully paid dental plan, the first
dental coverage given USE members,
will take effect in the second year of
the contract. After a $50 deductible,

it will cover 80 percent ot basic and
preventative dental costs and 50 per
cent of major dental costs up to $1000
per person annually. Orthodontia
will not be covered.
Substantive pension improve
ments taking effect in the second
year will provide for partial retire
ment benefits for employees work
ing here for less than 10 years. After
five years of employment, under the
new plan, retiring workers will re
ceive 50 percent of their retirement
benefits, with an additional 10 per
cent added annually until full be
nefits are provided after 10 years at
the University.
Under previous agreements, no
partial retirement benefits ensued
until an employee had completed 10
years with the University.
Vacations extended
Increased vacation time for
employees with at least three years
service, two additional days of sir*k
leave time per year and broadening
of the medical coverage to include
employees' dependents are also
provisions of the now igreement.
USE estimated that the cost of the
benefits brought the total three-year
increase to 30.8 percent
USE General Manager David
Novogrodsky said he was pleased
with the agreement.
"I think we accomplished quite <â€¢
bit," he said. "We made particular
progress in the benefit area, espe
cially in pensions and the dental
