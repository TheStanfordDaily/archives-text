# Union, University pledge mature relations

' The recent signing of the third three-year pact
between United Stanford Employees and the Uni
versity may signal the beginning ofa newerainthe
relationship between the two parties.
Since its inception in 1973, USE has been viewed
by many University administrators as being some
what unprofessional and trivial in many of its
negotiations and grievances with the University.
On the other hand, the union has perceived the
University as being hostile to its existence here
and precipitating confrontations in the hope of
wearing down or discrediting the union's leader
ship.
Some union members now see USE as a matur
ing organization that will be taken more seriously
in the future by the University.
One reason for this belief is the majorchange in
USE management that occured last fall when the
membership defeated long-time USE leader Jim
Berk in his quest for re-election as the union pres
ident.

Berk was also removed from the union member
ship rolls and USE staff workers he had dismissed
were re-hired.
Berk's strong, single-handed running of the
union had garnered him a strong following of a
minority of union members whom he had sup
ported in past grievances against the Univer
sity.
David Novogrodsky, a veteran union organizer,
arrived from Berkeley last winter to take over the
general managership of the union.
Many union members believe he has installed a
sense of professionalism and direction that was
lacking under the prior leadership.
The union went out on strike in May and June of
1974 for a three-week period. Most University ser
vices were disrupted by the walkout and picketers
succeeded in halting many deliveries to campus,
delaying some construction projects.
A strike appeared to be imminent this month as
the probable walkout date of Sept. 17 approached
and few issues had been resolved. Both the Uni

versity and USE were placing the blame on each
other for the anticipated strike.
When that day came, a surprised union mem
bership heard the terms of the tentative agree
ment reached during a marathon bargaining ses
sion held with a federal mediator over the
weekend.
The membership voted 509 to 354 Sept. 18 to
ratify the agreement. The relatively close vote left
in doubt the degree to which the union member
ship was pleased with the contract terms.
The almost 26 percent wage increase, including
the third year cost-of-living adjustment which USE
President Mike Harris said appears to be almost
ensured already, was much less than the union
had originally proposed. Past increases dictated by
the 1976 agreement had left the union lagging far
behind the skyrocketing cost of living.
The saving grace of the new agreement, as far as
the membership was concerned, however, was
the substantially increased benefit package that
included a dental plan
