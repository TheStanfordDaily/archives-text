# Stanford may appeal 17 Cal-OSHA fines
## 
### Andrea James 
University counsel will decide in
two weeks whether to appeal a $3585
fine slapped on Stanford for viola
tions of health and safety regula
tions.
The California Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA)
officially notified the University last
week of 17 violations that range from
the placement of chemical cancer
causing agents in unregulated areas
to the failure to promptly clean up a
barium oxide spill.
State industrial hygenists Lawr
ence Wong and John McGuire found
the violations during 10 visits to cam
pus over the last six months.
Jack Sidlow, University manager of
health and safety, said Friday that 11

of the violations have been cor
rected, two are partially corrected
and four remain to which the Univer
sity has yet to respond.
The University has 60 days to
correct the violations.
The two largest fines, each
amounting to $1000, involved the
storage of dangerous chemicals. In
one case, state officials found
cancer-causing agents stored in
non-regulated areas in the Chemistry
and Physics Departments and in the
Medical School. They also found a
small vinyl chloride container left
unused in a chemistry lab.
Other fines included:
— Two $500 fines for failing to re
port the location of the dangerous
chemicals to government officials;
— $235 for failing to properly iden
tify storage areas of the carcinogenic
materials;
— $140 for failing to properly sec
ure containers of concentrated acids
and bases in a physics laboratory;
— $140 for failing to promptly
clean up a barium oxide spill in
physics, and
— $70 for seven instances of un
chained gas cylinders in Service Op
erations, physics and chemistry.
Sidlow said the University is con
sidering an appeal of the two $1,000
fines, mainly because the stored
chemicals were not being used by
staff personnel.
"A regulated area entails having a
roster where employees sign in and
having shower facilities, handwash
ing facilities, change rooms and spe
cial ventilation," he said.
He questioned the necessity of this
precaution since the materials were
not actually used in the area, but
were only stored there.
Sidlow also said that no evidence
of leakage of the cancer-causing
agents existed.
"We took air samples of the areas
cited by the state, and in one case,
we even touched the bottle with the
sampler," he said. "We didn't get
anything."
He said he was "fairly sure" the
University would appeal. The Uni
versity of California at Berkeley was
cited for similar violations, in June,
and officials there have appealed
the citations.
Berkeley was not fined for the 20
citations because it is a public institu
tion.
"We're appealing because Cal-
OSHA listed the violations as being
serious, and we're arguing that they
can't be serious because no substan
tial health hazard occurred," said
Larry Schmelzer, environmental
health and safety officer for UC-
Berkeley.
Officials at Stanford are meeting
this week to decide the appeal op
tion and where regulated areas
should be constructed around the
campus.
