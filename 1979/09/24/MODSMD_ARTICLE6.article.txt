## 
### Susan Essoyan 
A man, who police believe has
committed a number of sexual at
tacks in Terrace residential area neaf
campus since 1971, raped a woman at
knife point in her home Sept. 15.
Officials suspect the attack was the
third in the area by the same man in
five months, said Detective Brian
Vierra of the Palo Alto Police De
partment.
A "fair number" of students and
Stanford-related individuals live in
College Terrace, which includes
about 1200 dwelling units, Colin
Mick of the neighborhood's residen
tial association estimated.
The rapist, described as about 5
feet 10 inches, white with light brown
hair, slender and in his late twenties
or early thirties, entered the Califor
nia Avenue home through an un
locked back door at 5:15 a.m. As in
past attacks, the rapist shut off the
electricity upon entering.
Vierra said police are positive the
same man has made 10 attacks, seven
in the period from 1971 to 1976 and
three this year. Not all of the attacks
were completed rapes, Vierra said.
Police believe the man raped a
woman May 16, and made an attemp
ted rape July 4. After the July attack,
an extended effort to inform resi
dents and circulate the attacker's de
scription was made.

The man has assaulted only young
women living alone in improperly
secured houses. He has never bro
ken a window to enter, Vierra said.
Police have followed hundreds of
leads over the past eight years, but'
the rapist, who Vierra said "knows
what he is doing," has eluded the
efforts.
During the attacks, the man wears
surgical gloves, thereby leaving no
fingerprints, shuts off the electricity
and disconnects or cuts phone wires.
Police believe he lives in the area
and cases houses before attacks.
"He's probably safe in his home by

the time we get there," Vierra said.
The police urge cooperation from
neighborhood residents in ap
prehending the attacker. Vierra
asked residents to report any sus
picious persons to the police.
Flyers with a new composite
sketch of the suspect were distri
buted to each College Terrace resi
fence this weekend. A meeting for
those concerned will be held Oct. 4
at 7:30 p.m. in Escondido School.
Vierra recommended women liv
ing alone take simple precautions,
including locking windows and
doors, shutting blinds and installing
locks on their switch boxes.
