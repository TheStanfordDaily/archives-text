A man, who police believe has
committed a number of sexual at
tacks in Terrace residential area neaf
campus since 1971, raped a woman at
knife point in her home Sept. 15.
Officials suspect the attack was the
third in the area by the same man in
five months, said Detective Brian
Vierra of the Palo Alto Police De
partment.
A "fair number" of students and
Stanford-related individuals live in
College Terrace, which includes
about 1200 dwelling units, Colin
Mick of the neighborhood's residen
tial association estimated.
The rapist, described as about 5
feet 10 inches, white with light brown
hair, slender and in his late twenties
or early thirties, entered the Califor
nia Avenue home through an un
locked back door at 5:15 a.m. As in
past attacks, the rapist shut off the
electricity upon entering.
Vierra said police are positive the
same man has made 10 attacks, seven
in the period from 1971 to 1976 and
three this year. Not all of the attacks
were completed rapes, Vierra said.
Police believe the man raped a
woman May 16, and made an attemp
ted rape July 4. After the July attack,
an extended effort to inform resi
dents and circulate the attacker's de
scription was made.
