## Cambodia hungers as aid stalls 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand (AP) —
While governments and aid
agencies debate the politics
and fine print of the problem,
relief officials and diplomats
say hundreds —if not
thousands — may ajready be
dying in Cambodia every day of
hunger and disease.
Why isn't large-scale interna
tional aid going to
Cambodia — a country that
has been stalked by wars and a
reign of terror and now faces
what U.S. State Department of
ficials say is a famine "terrible
beyond imagination"?
American officials blame the
Phnom Penh government and
Vietnam, since they have thus
far refused to agree on a prog
ram of international controls
over relief distribution.
Vietnamese forces ousted
the government of Premier Pol
Pot earlier this year and instal
led a new regime led by Heng
Samrin. The toppled gover
ment's forces still wage a guer
rilla war in the countryside,
however.
These officials said the Un
ited States will not send in food
if' its distribution cannot be
properly monitored.
"The Vietnamese don't want
a lot of foreigners running
around while their troops go
after Pol Pot," said one West
ern diplomat.
But in sharp contrast, the In
ternational Red Cross and the
U.N. children's aid agency UN
ICEF, whose representatives
are in Cambodia — say they
are "very satisfied" so far that
food and medicine being sent
in is reaching the civilian poou
lation and not fueling the milit
ary machine as some fear.
The two organizations have
been negotiating in Phnom
Penh for a large-scale interna
tional relief effort but the re
sults of the talks have not been
announced.
So far only small quantities
of food and medicine have
been shipped in to Cambodia,
although the extent of Soviet
and Vietnamese aid is not
known. UNICEF-Red Cross
flights over the past few weeks
have carried about 150 tons,
and the British relief agency
Oxfam sent in an additional 31
tons.
Estimates by one relief agency
place the food need at about
700 tons a day for several
months, an effort that would
cost millions of dollars and re
quire an elaborate distribution
system.
The situation is further com
plicated by the fact that few na
tions recognize the Heng Sam
rin government. Some object
to it because it was put in
power by force of Vietnamese
arms, and the United States
and other Western nations are
concerned that the new Cam
bodia is becoming anchored to
the Soviet bloc.
