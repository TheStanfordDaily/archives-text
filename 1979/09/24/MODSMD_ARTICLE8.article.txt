# Bokassa refused asylum

Paris (AP) — Deposed Afri
can dictator Jean-Bedel
Bokassa sat in confinement on
a plane at a military air base
near Paris Saturday, an em
peror without an empire who
faced an uncertain future in
exile.
The man who toppled him
from power in the Central Afri
can Empire was quoted as say
ing, meanwhile, that he had
consulted beforehand with the
French and other governments
before launching his coup.
Bokassa, 58, ousted as the
self-proclaimed emperor late
iThursday night in a blood
less takeover led by former
president David Dacko, landed
at a military base at Evreux Fri
day after a flight from Libya.
But French officials refused to
give him asylum.
Official sources said that de
spite the fact Bokassa is a
French citizen by virtue of his
service in the French army, he
would not be allowed into the
country. They said his
Caravelle jetliner would be re
fueled, then would return to
Libya.
But the plane still had not left
by late Saturday. There was no
explanation and French offi
cials, who earlier said Bokas
sa's presence in France would
be "inopportune at this time,"
refused all comment on the
matter.

The French news agency
Agence France-Presse re
ported from Bangui, capital of
the Central African Empire,
that France and several African
countries apparently knew ot
plans for Bokassa's overthrow
long in advance.
According to AFP, Dacko
told reporters ' lurday he had
been in N'Djamena . Chad, |ust
before the coup and returned
to Bangui at the last minute.
"I stayed in Libreville, the
capital of Gabon, for two
months, then I went to Paris
and finally to N'Djamena to
discuss the matter with rep
resentatives of several coun
tries, and I'm happy to say that
the secret was kept until the
last minute," Dacko said.
Bokassa was on a trip to
Tripoli, Libya, when Dacko, 49,
seized power and ended the
emperor's 14 years of bloody,
iron-fisted rule, proclaiming
the African nation was once
again a republic.
Bokassa had himself
crowned as emperor in 1977 in
a lavish ceremony that cost an
estimated $30 million — one
quarter of the nation's annual
national income.
Dacko was the country's first
president and was himself
overthrown by Bokassa in 1965.
He was kept under house ar
rest for 10 years until Sep

tember 1976, when Bokassa
freed him and named him a
personal adviser.
In a radio broadcast after the
coup, Dacko said "I am acting
. . . to re-establish democratic
liberties, to return rapidly the
sovereign power of the people
and assure its security.
"The nation has gone back
100 years," said Dacko, who
was the first elected president
of the Central African Republic
after it gained independence
from France in 1960. Observers
agreed that the economy of the
landlocked, Texas-sized na
tion, meager at best, had de
teriorated under Bokassa.
