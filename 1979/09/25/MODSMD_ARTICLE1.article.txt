# Former Coffee House workers reopen stand

By loan O'Connell and Julie Jacobs
The former employees of the Cof
fee House yesterday reopened the
"True Coffee House," an alternative
food service across from Tresidder
Union, in a move they called their
"major weapon" in an ongoing labor
dispute with Guckenheimer Enter
prises.
This stand was first opened July 31,
following the dismissal of the 56-
person staff of the Coffee House July
27. The workers had been attempting
to organize a union to achieve more
job security and better working con
ditions when both managers and
staff were fired en masse.
The True Coffee House was closed
Aug. 7 by the Santa Clara County
Board of Health for lack of a vendor's
license and improper refrigeration.
Yesterday the efforts of the stand
food vendors, who serve mainly
juice and sandwiches, were joined
by attempts of other former
employees across from the stand,
who tried to enforce a boycott ot the
Coffee House with picket lines at the
front and back door. Staffers and
their families manned two-person
shifts on these lines from noon until
midnight.
Applying pressure
Chip Zemple, employed six years
by the Coffee House, explained that
the boycott and opening of the new
food service are part of an attempt to
put economic pressure on Guc
kenheimer to force rehiring of the
original employees.
People seemed receptive to the
picketers, atter being informed
about the conflict and directed to al
ternative eating facilities on campus,
including the I rue Coffee House and
other non-Guckenheimer opera

tions near Tresidder.
As Zemple explained, "It's hard to
ask people not to eat lunch, but it's
easier to say, 'don't eat lunch here.'"
Business at both coffee houses was
limited today, due to both registra
tion day contusion and the intlux of
new students unaware of the labor
controversy, according to both the
strikers and the current Coffee
House staff.
'Hardship fund'
All income trom the sale of food
will go first toward restocking the
stand, and then toward a "hardship
fund" for those employees who have
been under financial stress and un
employed since My.
Profits will also help pay legal fees
and printing costs.
Eliza Wilson, whose husband, Tofu
Zeller, was one of those fired, pic
keted yesterday with her toddler
son, Alexi. As Alexi played near the
striking staffers, Eliza described her
frustration. Among other problems,
she said, "When our landlord heard
my husband lost his job, he im
mediately raised the rent."
Across campus at Maples-Pavilion,
the True Coffee House employees
joined the rows of campus organiza
tions and causes with a booth asking
all students to "Boycott the Coffee
House," with literature available on
the conflict.
Many questions
A petition of concerned students
collected only 55 signatures, but
those at the booth were encouraged
by what they estimated were 200 in
terested students asking questions.
One booth staffer said the three
most common questions were:
"Why were you fired?", "How long
