# Census: change expected in income, energy use, jobs
## 
### Samuel Howe 
From Census Bureau and press releases
The 1980 census forms are on the presses, and
printing plants in three states are working to
produce millions of the questionnaires. Laid
end to end, they would stretch around the earth
three times.
Since the last census in 1970, Americans have
gone through a lot of changes in certain aspects
of their lives, according to James Gorman from
the 1980 Census Promotion Office in
Washington. For example, changes and fluctua
tions are expected to appear in housing, energy
use, occupation and income.
Also, the 1980 census will include illegal aliens
in its count of the country's inhabitants next
year. This may give states such as California and
Texas two new congressmen and additional
federal funds.
While 10 years ago illegal aliens were not spec
ifically excluded from the census, there has
been a greater awareness of the influx of aliens
such as migrant workers, and therefore more
effort to accommodate them.
It is estimated that millions of illegal aliens live
in border states such as California and Texas,
and including them in the census is expected to
boost the representation in these areas.
According to the Census Bureau, the 20th de
cennial census will count all residents of the
United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
Guam, American Samoa and the Trust Ter
ritories of the Pacific Islands. The census is ex
pected to count approximately 222 million
people.
Along with changes in American family life,
income, housing costs, population distribution,
and Congressional representation, the census is
expected to show one of the lowest population
growth rates in the country's history.
Some of the changes that the census is ex
pected to reveal in family life include:
— The number of husbandless women who
are heading families has risen nearly 50 percent
since 1970, to more than eight million.
— The traditional family household of

mother, father and one or more children now
accounts for less than a third of the nation's
households, the lowest percentage ever.
—Both husband and wife have earned in
come in about one-half of the 48 million hus
band-wife families in the United States, a new
high.
— The number of unmarried couples sharing
a household has more than doubled in 10 vears.
And as for population distribution, the new
census is expected to show population shifts
from northern and eastern states to the south
ern and western areas.
It is expected that the total numberof housing
units will have increased more than 20 percent
since 1970, more than twice the population
growth rate of around nine percent.
The Census is the Constitutional basis for
reapportioning seats in the House of Represen
tatives. Population estimates by the Census
Bureau suggest That "extensive redrawing" of
district boundaries will be made necessary after
the 1980 census. California, Texas, Florida,
Utah, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington and
Arizona may gain one or more seats, while New
York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan
and South Dakota may lose seats. New York, for
example, may lose as many as four seats.
Data from the 1980 census will also identity
trends in home energy use.
Between 1950 and 1975, the number of U.S.
households using coal and wood diminished to
less than one percent for each fuel, but natural
gas usage increased from 23 percent to 57 per
cent of all households.
The home energy picture in 1980 may show an
upturn in the use of coal and wood, but residen
tial solar energy is still too limited to affect
nationwide statistics in 1980.
Most households will receive a short version
of the questionnaire, four pages long, which the
bureau estimates can be completed in 15 mi
nutes. The remainder, about one in five house
holds, will be asked to spend 45 minutes or so
answering a longer, more detailed question
naire.

York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan
and South Dakota may lose seats. New York, for
example, may lose as many as four seats.
Data from the 1980 census will also identity
trends in home energy use.
Between 1950 and 1975, the number of U.S.
households using coal and wood diminished to
less than one percent for each fuel, but natural
gas usage increased from 23 percent to 57 per
cent of all households.
The home energy picture in 1980 may show an
upturn in the use of coal and wood, but residen
tial solar energy is still too limited to affect
nationwide statistics in 1980.
Most households will receive a short version
of the questionnaire, four pages long, which the
bureau estimates can be completed in 15 mi
nutes. The remainder, about one in five house
holds, will be asked to spend 45 minutes or so
answering a longer, more detailed question
naire.

From Census Bureau and press releases
The 1980 census forms are on the presses, and
printing plants in three states are working to
produce millions of the questionnaires. Laid
end to end, they would stretch around the earth
three times.
Since the last census in 1970, Americans have
gone through a lot of changes in certain aspects
of their lives, according to James Gorman from
the 1980 Census Promotion Office in
Washington. For example, changes and fluctua
tions are expected to appear in housing, energy
use, occupation and income.
Also, the 1980 census will include illegal aliens
in its count of the country's inhabitants next
year. This may give states such as California and
Texas two new congressmen and additional
federal funds.
While 10 years ago illegal aliens were not spec
ifically excluded from the census, there has
been a greater awareness of the influx of aliens
such as migrant workers, and therefore more
effort to accommodate them.
It is estimated that millions of illegal aliens live
in border states such as California and Texas,
and including them in the census is expected to
boost the representation in these areas.
According to the Census Bureau, the 20th de
cennial census will count all residents of the
United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,
Guam, American Samoa and the Trust Ter
ritories of the Pacific Islands. The census is ex
pected to count approximately 222 million
people.
Along with changes in American family life,
income, housing costs, population distribution,
and Congressional representation, the census is
expected to show one of the lowest population
growth rates in the country's history.
Some of the changes that the census is ex
pected to reveal in family life include:
— The number of husbandless women who
are heading families has risen nearly 50 percent
since 1970, to more than eight million.
— The traditional family household of

mother, father and one or more children now
accounts for less than a third of the nation's
households, the lowest percentage ever.
—Both husband and wife have earned in
come in about one-half of the 48 million hus
band-wife families in the United States, a new
high.
— The number of unmarried couples sharing
a household has more than doubled in 10 vears.
And as for population distribution, the new
census is expected to show population shifts
from northern and eastern states to the south
ern and western areas.
It is expected that the total numberof housing
units will have increased more than 20 percent
since 1970, more than twice the population
growth rate of around nine percent.
The Census is the Constitutional basis for
reapportioning seats in the House of Represen
tatives. Population estimates by the Census
Bureau suggest That "extensive redrawing" of
district boundaries will be made necessary after
the 1980 census. California, Texas, Florida,
Utah, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington and
Arizona may gain one or more seats, while New
York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan
and South Dakota may lose seats. New York, for
example, may lose as many as four seats.
Data from the 1980 census will also identity
trends in home energy use.
Between 1950 and 1975, the number of U.S.
households using coal and wood diminished to
less than one percent for each fuel, but natural
gas usage increased from 23 percent to 57 per
cent of all households.
The home energy picture in 1980 may show an
upturn in the use of coal and wood, but residen
tial solar energy is still too limited to affect
nationwide statistics in 1980.
Most households will receive a short version
of the questionnaire, four pages long, which the
bureau estimates can be completed in 15 mi
nutes. The remainder, about one in five house
holds, will be asked to spend 45 minutes or so
answering a longer, more detailed question
naire.
