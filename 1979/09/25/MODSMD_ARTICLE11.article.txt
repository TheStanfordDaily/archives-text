Tried to save any money lately? Tried to
find some money to pay tor your books?
Local banks, competing for the thousands
of small accounts opened by University
students each year, areconcerned enough
about your business to include special ser
vices for students among their features.
Every bank surveyed in the Palo Alto area
offers an interest rate of 5 'A percent on the
basic savings account; additionally, many
banks provide combined savings and
checking accounts so that every penny can
earn interest.
Checking with interest
The typical checking account with in
terest is most practical for the larger ac
count. If a balance of above $2000 is main
tained, no service fee is charged; if the
amount falls below this level, a penalty is
imposed.
Bank of America, for example, will
charge $3 per month and ten cents per
check, as will California Canadian Bank
and Wells Fargo Bank. Crocker National
Bank's rate for smaller accounts is $2 per
month and 12 cents per check, while the
Security Pacific National Bank requires $2
per month and 15 cents per check.
The United California Bank charges ac
cording to the amount left in the account;
$1.50 is charged per month, plus 10 cents
per check, if the amount is between $500
and $799, while $3 per month and 10 cents
per check is required for accounts below
$500.
At the Bank of California, only $1000 is
required for the account to draw interest,
while the charge below this minimum is
assessed by the number of transactions
held with the bank, the most expensive of
these fees being $3 per month and 15 cents
per check.
At the Union Bank, $2500 must rest in
the account for it to draw interest; below
this level, $4 per month and 7 cents per
check is charged.

Special services are offered in the way of
student checking accounts, too. A typical
plan involves a service charge of $1 per
month, from September until May, with
free checking during the "hectic" summer
months. The United Calitornia Bank re
quires an original deposit of $100 for this
service. The Bank of California, with this
plan, requires no minimum balance, no
limit on the number of checks used, and
no charge on checks. Bank of America will
not charge the $1 monthly fee if more than
$300 is left in the account; free per
sonalized checks are provided.
The Crocker National Bank will charge a
flat rate of $6 per year for an account hold
ing at least $50. Wells Fargo charges $1 per
month, plus 20 cents tor each check alter
the first ten used per month. The Calitor
nia Canadian Bank, the Security Pacific Na
tional Bank, and the Union Bank offer no
student accounts.
Auto teller
Another special feature, the automatic
teller, provides some functions of a bank
teller — check cashing, transferral of
funds — outside of normal bank hours.
This service is offered by the Bank of
America and by Crocker National Bank.
Wells Fargo plans to open two automatic
tellers in November; the hours of service
are not yet known.
Credit cards are also available to univer
sity students.Although Bank of America
will not issue them to students, applica
tions may be filed at the California Cana
dian Bank, the Union Bank, and the Bank
of California.
Crocker National Bank issues cards to
students and provides them with overdraft
protection, as does the Security Pacific Na
tional Bank. United California Bank offers
credit cards to students earning $150 per
month, over and above college expenses.
At Wells Fargo, sophomores, juniors, and
seniors with relatives in the United States
and a current ID card can get a credit card
fairly easily; graduate students are given
$400 credit, while undergrads obtain $300.
Check cashing
The California Canadian Bank, the
Crocker National Bank, the Security Na

tional Bank, the United California Bank,
and the Bank of California will not cash
checks unless the student holds an ac
count there. The most flexible program for
cashing checks without an account is at
Wells Fargo, where a check worth up to
$50 will be cashed if a current ID is shown.
Campus bank
Since local banks offer largely similar
programs, the logical question is: why is
Wells Fargo the only bank on campus? As
Dan Williams, director of Tresidder Un
ion, pointed out, only one bank, like one
travel agency or one career planning
center, could be supported by a commun
ity this size. Banks are hesitant to open
branches where mostly small accounts will
be opened; in fact, of the nine banks ap
proched inlhe early 1970s }o open a cam
pus bank, only six submitted proposals
and bids.
The criteria to evaluate these banks, de
veloped by a committee of faculty, staff,
and students, called tor "a commitment to
an affirmative action program in hiring, sal
ary, administration, and promotion, in
cluding a commitment to hire students to
the greatest extent possible." Wells Fargo,
in addition to meeting these standrds, also
otfered llexible hours and agreed to cash
small checks with a University ID, thus
eliminating an unprofitable chore tor the
ASSU and the Credit Union.
The Security National Bank, Wells Far
go's major competitor in the early 70's,
offered a visible record of opposition to
the Viet Nam war. The Committee on Tre
sidder Union, however, realized that its
owner, Fortney "Pete" Stark, would leave
the banking business upon taking on his
role of Congressman and opted for the
stability of Wells Fargo.
The proposal that the bank be located
on the second floor met with some disap
proval, because of the for
non-student customers. But, as Rodney
Adams, university director of finance,
stated, "We decided we wanted more
through tratfic at Tresidder Union." The
student tenter now benefits from the rent
paid by the bank, as, well as from the addi
tional influx of bank customers through
the surrounding offices.

banks provide combined savings and
checking accounts so that every penny can
earn interest.
Checking with interest
The typical checking account with in
terest is most practical for the larger ac
count. If a balance of above $2000 is main
tained, no service fee is charged; if the
amount falls below this level, a penalty is
imposed.
Bank of America, for example, will
charge $3 per month and ten cents per
check, as will California Canadian Bank
and Wells Fargo Bank. Crocker National
Bank's rate for smaller accounts is $2 per
month and 12 cents per check, while the
Security Pacific National Bank requires $2
per month and 15 cents per check.
The United California Bank charges ac
cording to the amount left in the account;
$1.50 is charged per month, plus 10 cents
per check, if the amount is between $500
and $799, while $3 per month and 10 cents
per check is required for accounts below
$500.
At the Bank of California, only $1000 is
required for the account to draw interest,
while the charge below this minimum is
assessed by the number of transactions
held with the bank, the most expensive of
these fees being $3 per month and 15 cents
per check.
At the Union Bank, $2500 must rest in
the account for it to draw interest; below
this level, $4 per month and 7 cents per
check is charged.

Special services are offered in the way of
student checking accounts, too. A typical
plan involves a service charge of $1 per
month, from September until May, with
free checking during the "hectic" summer
months. The United Calitornia Bank re
quires an original deposit of $100 for this
service. The Bank of California, with this
plan, requires no minimum balance, no
limit on the number of checks used, and
no charge on checks. Bank of America will
not charge the $1 monthly fee if more than
$300 is left in the account; free per
sonalized checks are provided.
The Crocker National Bank will charge a
flat rate of $6 per year for an account hold
ing at least $50. Wells Fargo charges $1 per
month, plus 20 cents tor each check alter
the first ten used per month. The Calitor
nia Canadian Bank, the Security Pacific Na
tional Bank, and the Union Bank offer no
student accounts.
Auto teller
Another special feature, the automatic
teller, provides some functions of a bank
teller — check cashing, transferral of
funds — outside of normal bank hours.
This service is offered by the Bank of
America and by Crocker National Bank.
Wells Fargo plans to open two automatic
tellers in November; the hours of service
are not yet known.
Credit cards are also available to univer
sity students.Although Bank of America
will not issue them to students, applica
tions may be filed at the California Cana
dian Bank, the Union Bank, and the Bank
of California.
Crocker National Bank issues cards to
students and provides them with overdraft
protection, as does the Security Pacific Na
tional Bank. United California Bank offers
credit cards to students earning $150 per
month, over and above college expenses.
At Wells Fargo, sophomores, juniors, and
seniors with relatives in the United States
and a current ID card can get a credit card
fairly easily; graduate students are given
$400 credit, while undergrads obtain $300.
Check cashing
The California Canadian Bank, the
Crocker National Bank, the Security Na

tional Bank, the United California Bank,
and the Bank of California will not cash
checks unless the student holds an ac
count there. The most flexible program for
cashing checks without an account is at
Wells Fargo, where a check worth up to
$50 will be cashed if a current ID is shown.
Campus bank
Since local banks offer largely similar
programs, the logical question is: why is
Wells Fargo the only bank on campus? As
Dan Williams, director of Tresidder Un
ion, pointed out, only one bank, like one
travel agency or one career planning
center, could be supported by a commun
ity this size. Banks are hesitant to open
branches where mostly small accounts will
be opened; in fact, of the nine banks ap
proched inlhe early 1970s }o open a cam
pus bank, only six submitted proposals
and bids.
The criteria to evaluate these banks, de
veloped by a committee of faculty, staff,
and students, called tor "a commitment to
an affirmative action program in hiring, sal
ary, administration, and promotion, in
cluding a commitment to hire students to
the greatest extent possible." Wells Fargo,
in addition to meeting these standrds, also
otfered llexible hours and agreed to cash
small checks with a University ID, thus
eliminating an unprofitable chore tor the
ASSU and the Credit Union.
The Security National Bank, Wells Far
go's major competitor in the early 70's,
offered a visible record of opposition to
the Viet Nam war. The Committee on Tre
sidder Union, however, realized that its
owner, Fortney "Pete" Stark, would leave
the banking business upon taking on his
role of Congressman and opted for the
stability of Wells Fargo.
The proposal that the bank be located
on the second floor met with some disap
proval, because of the for
non-student customers. But, as Rodney
Adams, university director of finance,
stated, "We decided we wanted more
through tratfic at Tresidder Union." The
student tenter now benefits from the rent
paid by the bank, as, well as from the addi
tional influx of bank customers through
the surrounding offices.
(Editor's note: The following article is a com
parison of the services offered by local banks to
University students. Alternatives to banks, such
as credit unions and savings and loans associa
tions, will be explored tomorrow.)
