# Scientist 'deciphers' Stonehenge

Moscow (AP) — A Soviet sci
entist claims he and his col
leagues have solved the riddle
of England's mysterious
Stonehenge, saying it was built
as a model for the planets in
the Earth's solar system.
In an interview with the offi
cial news agency, Tass, sent on
its wire last Wednesday, Vla
dimir Avinsky, a prominent
geologist and mineralogist, did
not dispute recently espoused

theories that Stonehenge is ac
tually an ancient but sophisti
cated astronomical observat
ory. But he said he believes he
has discovered another amaz
ing attribute for it.
Researchers have speculated
that Stonehenge's circle of
stones are positioned so they
can accurately determine time
for lunar and solar years, and
even be used as a navigational
guide to get bearings by the
stars.
Avinsky said in the interview
with Tass that working with col
league Bladimir Tereshin, "we

succeeded in discovering a
pentagram in the complex and
mysterious geometry of
Stonehenge which, as it seems
to us, was used as a basis tor its
arrangement and carries in
formation on the size of the
planets of the solar system."
Sometimes described as the
eighth wonder of the world,
Stonehenge is a circle ot huge
stones standing on Salisbury
Plain in Wiltshire, England. It is
not known exactly when the
stones were erected or why,
prompting many legends and
scientific theories.
