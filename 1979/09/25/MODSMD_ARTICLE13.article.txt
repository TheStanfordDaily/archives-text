## Press freedom protected 
### 
The determined efforts this year of sev
eral small newspapers and magazines have
breathed some new life into a First
Amendment that has taken its lumps re
cently.
By refusing to bow to federal govern
ment pressure to be just another puppet in
the game of nuclear secrecy, The Progres
sive magazine in Madison, Wis., the Madi
son Press Connection in the same city and
the Daily Californian at UC-Berkeley have
led the nation's press in doing its foremost
job: fostering the free flow of information
in a country that professes freedom.
The issue involved in the restraining or
ders against The Progressive and Daily
Californian, prohibiting them from legally
publishing material critically explaining the
process the federal government uses to
classify nuclear information, was, and still
is, blatant prior restraint of a free press.
It was the same mentality that eight years
ago brought the government to try to pre
vent the New York Times and Washington
Post from publishing the Pentagon Papers.
A freedom-respecting Supreme Court then
sided with the newspapers and they went
on to give the American public the oppor
tunity to learn more of how we became
involved in Vietnam.

The political, not national security issues,
were, in that case, as in the Progressive
case, the motivational forces behind the
government's irrational actions.
Howard Morland's Progressive article,
the letter supporting the Progressive from
four scientists working at Argonne National
Laboratory in Illinois and Charles Hansen's
letter to Illinois Sen. Charles Percy that was
published by the Press Connection did not
contain the necessary information to aid
anyone producing a hydrogen bomb.
The government feared the publication
of those items because it showed their own
ineptness in handling the delicate situation
of classifying nuclear information.
We believe the government which clas
sifies the least material classifies correctly.
An informed public trusted with its own
survival is not a thing to fear. But a govern
ment which attempts to forbid the press
from informing the public is a leviathan de
serving of fear.
A government free to willfully restrain
publication is a government unchecked.
And if the people are not free to debate and
determine whether courts correctly or in
correctly judge classification and prior re
straint, they are not free at all.
