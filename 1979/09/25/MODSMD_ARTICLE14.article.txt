## Where have all the heroes gone? 
### 
The hero can he poet,
prophet, king, priest, or what
yoa will, according to the kind
ol world he finds himself horn
into. . . .
iHeroes and Hero-worship)
Tin- year 192" belonged to
Liu ky I indy. The ' Ms, to Clark
Gable, and the '40s to the (.Is
who went overseas to win the
war lor democ racy. Americans
had Ike and Adlai in the 1950s
and paid last respects to three

outstanding men who were c ut
down in the prime ot lite
amidst the turbulence ol the
60s.
Now, on to the decade
which, in theeourse ot the next
lew months, will end unlike all
the others, fhe 1970s have
tailed to produce any signific
ant heroes.
Ken as the President ot the
United States decries our
"crisis ot confidence" and at
tempts to assert strong leader

ship, the majority ot the
populace lacks that much
needed confidence in our
leaders. There seems to be an
almost deafening outcry for
energy, charisma and mag
netism: all qualities ot a hero.
The search for a strong na
tional hero is understandable.
The thought ol some human
being to whom we can look tor
strengthening of national pride
is morally uplifting in itself.
Yet, who are the heroes ot this
decade; 1 At the present, only 19
percent ot Americans teel that
President Carter is doing an
excellent or a good job, and
support tor other government
leaders is less than impressive.
Yet, when American teenagers
were polled on who they felt
was a true hero to them, the
winner by a landslide was Mork
from Ork.
Presidents and businessmen
used to be the great heroes of
their day. Today, we tind them
scorned, ridiculed, and pub
licly criticized. For a while,
even sports greats captured
imaginations. Yet modern
trends have proven that one
tremendous season tends to
lead to contract squabbles and
inflated egos.
We keep looking for another
lonas Salk or Albert Einstein,
but our glances merely amplify
the emptiness ol fhe lot.
America needs more heroes.
Heroes have the marvelous
ability to unite tactions of all
ideologies into a quorum ot
proud Americans.
Where do we begin the
search tor our new heroes? It
we try to make the qualifica
tions too narrow, we exclude
almost everyone who does nof
shatter the national scene with
an astounding teat. Perhaps
the glory days of Edison, Eord
and Eirestone are gone. Why is
this the case?

One answeVis that we always
teel a great urge to commer
cialize our sudden heroes.
One moment Dorothy Hamill
is astounding the world with
her teats ot grac etulness on the
ice, and in the next she is push
ing a shampoo on television.
It is not surprising, there
lore, that there is no one
whose limelight stretches
above the reach ot pocket
books tar enough to capture
the public s awe lor any ex
tended period ot time.
It appears that we must no
longer look lor the mighty, hut
perhaps tor the modest. It is
time to look away trom the
morning paper and instead
turn to our own daily lives to
seek out those who are worthy
ot recognition. It the days ot
national heroes are gone, then
the days ot personal, familial
heroes ate about to be born.
These are not heroes who have
suddenly emerged out ol
obscurity. They have merely
been awaiting the day when
they must be called upon to
work together to give us pride
in their accomplishments as a
whole. The doctor who re
moves a cancerous limb and
saves a lite; he is a hero. The
triend who offers a hand when
no one else will; he, too, is a
hero.
We must come to recognize
the many heroic deeds that
enhance our daily lives with
laughter, joy and love. Though
these deeds may not gain na
tional headlines and world re
known, they are every bit as
important in our lives.
Search out your own per
sonal heroes. Hopefully, it is
they who will form the
backbone ot our new national
spirit.

obscurity. They have merely
been awaiting the day when
they must be called upon to
work together to give us pride

saves a lite; he is a hero. The
triend who offers a hand when
no one else will; he, too, is a
hero.
We must come to recognize
the many heroic deeds that
enhance our daily lives with
laughter, joy and love. Though
these deeds may not gain na

known, they are every bit as
important in our lives.
Search out your own per

they who will form the
backbone ot our new national
