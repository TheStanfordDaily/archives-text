## David Sartoris American people need Kennedy 
### 
As the 1980 presidential elec
tion year approaches, it be
comes increasingly apparent
that this particular selection
process could be extraordi
nary. For several decades,
American voters have patiently
waited tor the two major politi
cal parties to select and prom
ote two individuals tor the na
tion's highest office. With

token competition from inde
pendent candidates, one of
these two party-supported
men has traditionally been
elected, laden with campaign
promises which the public is
tired of hearing and wary of be
lieving.
However, early public opin
ion polls have revealed that
19H0 is clearly going to be diffe
rent. For the first time in years,
the American people are be
hind an individual who has yet
to indicate a serious interest in
being president: Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.).
While Gov. lerry Brown of
California has mounted his
c ampaign in earnest and jimmy
Carter has been steamboating
down the Mississippi, this in
dividual has been busy as usual
doing the job for which he was
elected. Meanwhile, he con
tinues to mount growing pub
lic support, without spending a
dime ot the taxpayer's money
on an election campaign.
An explanation for the
paradoxical popularity of Ken
nedy is easily found by analyz
ing the present state of the un
ion. The United States is
plagued by numerous growing
problems, including the
energy crisis, inflation, un
employment, crime and most
importantly, a crisis of confi
dence which Carter has recog
nized but has been unable to
do anything about.
These multiple dilemmas
may all be capsulized into the
single, undeniable statement
that America is currently in de
sperate need of a hero; witness
the popularity of such screen
characters as Superman or
Rocky Balboa. In order to bring

our nation to its feet, the next
occupant of the Oval Office
mus* have the charisma to
command the faith, support,
and hope of every American
citizen.
'Mystique'
The so-called "Kennedy
mystique" had its onset during
the 1%0 presidential campaign
with the young, idealistic
brother John who debated

. . . Kennedy may not even require the
support of a major political party to be
elected. . .

Richard Nixon on national
television and subsequently
captured the confidence of the
nation. He launched America
into a space program which
was to captivate the worlcJ for a
decade, and averted a poten
tial crisis with the Soviet Union
in Cuba before being gunned
down alter a scant three years
in the White House.
Soon thereafter came a sec
ond inspiring brother named
Kennedy, whose mounting
public support led him to a
stunning primary election vic
tory in California and a tragic
death moments later in the
pantry of a Los Angeles hotel.
Thus, twice during the 1960s
Americans placed their faith in
a political leader, and twice
that individual was brutally
taken from us in a manner
fraught with possible conspi
racy. That the shocking events
behind the Watergate incident
rould have actually occurred
leaves many citizens wonder
ing what really happened to

John and Bobby.
Edward Kennedy thus re
mains the last surviving
brother, with an admirable
political record but a reputa
tion partially tainted by the
Chappaquiddick incident.
Once again, the truth behind
the latter remains obscure to
the American public, but is a
point which most certainly
would be emphasized harshly

by opponents should Kennedy
declare himself a formal candi
date.
Nevertheless, Kennedy is
certainly qualified to occupy
the nation's highest office, has
worked hard and successfully
in Congress and has many in
novative ideas on a number of
issues, particularly the concept
of national health insurance.
Support of the majority
Most importantly Kennedy
has apparently mustered the
support of the majority of
American voters without lifting
a linger toward the office of
president. It would be an un
usual and welcome blow to ex
travagant pre-election cam
paigns if a politician received
his party's nomination by dec
laring his candidacy on the
night of the selection at the
convention. If the polls do not
lie, Kennedy may not even re
quire the support of a major
political party to be elected by
the popular vote.
While Kennedy may not hold
immediate solutions to our na
tion's many complex prob
lems, he is clearly the man for
the job in 1980. America may
presently be likened to a tired,
unspirited football team, be
hind in the fourth quarter, hav
ing played the game too long
with an inadequate quarter
back. Off the bench comes the
inspiring brother of an old vet
eran who once led the same
team to glory. Although rela
tively inexperienced, the
players have faith in the young
newcomer, the team gels, and
victory is theirs.
The fact that the American
people appear to want Ken
nedy for president is reason
enough to give him a shot at
our most (eared opponent, the
American c risis of confidence.
