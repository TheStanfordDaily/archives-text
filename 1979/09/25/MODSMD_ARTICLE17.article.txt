## Keep the ball 
### 
At the Stanford San lose
State football game Sept. 15,
University security officers
were forced to break up a sc ut
ile among youths trying to re
trieve a lootball kicked into the
stands. Many ot those in atten
dance at the game misinter
preted the ac tions ol the offic
ers as an attempt lo regain the
tootball tor the Athletic De
partment.
This was not the case. The
issue was not and has never
been retrieval ot a football.
Our objective is to prevent
tights trom breaking out and
people from getting hurt when
a ball is kicked into the stands.

At that game, the officers inter
vened when two older youths
tried to forcibly take the ball
away from a much younger
child.
Our tans are welcome to
keep any football that clears
the restraining nets and goes
into the stands. We ask those
seated in the end zones to ret
rain trom trying to wrestle the
ball away trom the person who
retrieves it. Their cooperation
in this matter will prevent a re
peat of the untortunate inci
dent at the San lose State
game.
