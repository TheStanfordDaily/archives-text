Computers are "stupid."
So says Jim Dick, documen
tation coordinator at SCIP, the
Stanford Center for Informa
tion Processing.
"Well, maybe not 'stupid' —
it's just that you have to tell it
what to do; exactly what to
do according to Dick.
If you tell a computer to dis
play some 10,000 lines a sec
ond, it will go ahead and do it.
If you tell a computer to
change the name "Robert" to
"Bob" every time it appears in
a 150-page thesis, a computer
will do that — in microseconds
(or millionths of a second) to
"memorize" (store) 15,000
tapes each of virtually unli
mited information with the
dogged allegiance of Man's
Best Friend a computer will do
that as well.
With computers the stupider
the better. With such an axiom
in mind, SCIP has recently ac
quired a new IBM 370/3033
processor, a new computer
unit whose willingness to re
spond to the whims of man is
staggering.
Along with this acquisition,
SCIP recently moved its offices
to the brand new Forsythe
building on Panama Street near
)ordan Quad. Formerly the of
fices were spread around the
campus. The move represents
an effort to consolidate both
staff and hardware in a central
loation, according to Ruth Ch
ase, a documentation writer in
the SCIP user services group.
SCIP is both friend and foe to
the student. It can whip up a
tuition account or payroll in
lightning speed, ultimately
making the road to a student's
pocket all the shorter. But
a computer can also save hours

of research time on a history
•thesis, or help a harried typist
finish an English term paper in
record time.
In fact, the oportunrties av
ailable for a liberal arts major
are potentially as great as those
tor any hardcore computer
nerd.
In training classes that last
anywhere from two to six ses
sions, even a self-deemed
mechanical clutz can learn the
ins and outs of gathering, stor
ing and retrieving information,
and editing and composing a
research paper. And then, at
the flip of a button, the former
Klutz can sit back for a few sec
onds or so and watch the com
puter spew out flawless final
copy.
Until this summer, the work
torwhich SClPwas responsible
was "split up," said Chase.
Most of the administrative
work was done in the Encina
Hall offices, while much of the
academic work — the open
shop computing availale to fa
culty, staff and students — was
done on terminals in Pine Hall
in the Jordan Quad.
With the new processor
"which runs everything,"
Chase said, there are a number
of terminals connected to the
main unit. While most of the
publicly available terminals are
in the new Forsythe Building,,
there are office terminals all
over campus, and it is possible
to use this computer from
anywhere in the world that has
a telephone, that is, thanks to a
device known as a connecting
coupler.
Here on campus, there have
been as many as 200 terminals
in use simultaneously, all
plugged in to the main unit,
and there is potential for even
more.
Over the weekend of June
23-24, the campus' old 370/168
computer was replaced by the
new processor. The new
machine is approximately 1.8
times as fast as the old unit.

Computers are "stupid."
So says Jim Dick, documen
tation coordinator at SCIP, the
Stanford Center for Informa
tion Processing.
"Well, maybe not 'stupid' —
it's just that you have to tell it
what to do; exactly what to
do according to Dick.
If you tell a computer to dis
play some 10,000 lines a sec
ond, it will go ahead and do it.
If you tell a computer to
change the name "Robert" to
"Bob" every time it appears in
a 150-page thesis, a computer
will do that — in microseconds
(or millionths of a second) to
"memorize" (store) 15,000
tapes each of virtually unli
mited information with the
dogged allegiance of Man's
Best Friend a computer will do
that as well.
With computers the stupider
the better. With such an axiom
in mind, SCIP has recently ac
quired a new IBM 370/3033
processor, a new computer
unit whose willingness to re
spond to the whims of man is
staggering.
Along with this acquisition,
SCIP recently moved its offices
to the brand new Forsythe
building on Panama Street near
)ordan Quad. Formerly the of
fices were spread around the
campus. The move represents
an effort to consolidate both
staff and hardware in a central
loation, according to Ruth Ch
ase, a documentation writer in
the SCIP user services group.
SCIP is both friend and foe to
the student. It can whip up a
tuition account or payroll in
lightning speed, ultimately
making the road to a student's
pocket all the shorter. But
a computer can also save hours

of research time on a history
•thesis, or help a harried typist
finish an English term paper in
record time.
In fact, the oportunrties av
ailable for a liberal arts major
are potentially as great as those
tor any hardcore computer
nerd.
In training classes that last
anywhere from two to six ses
sions, even a self-deemed
mechanical clutz can learn the
ins and outs of gathering, stor
ing and retrieving information,
and editing and composing a
research paper. And then, at
the flip of a button, the former
Klutz can sit back for a few sec
onds or so and watch the com
puter spew out flawless final
copy.
Until this summer, the work
torwhich SClPwas responsible
was "split up," said Chase.
Most of the administrative
work was done in the Encina
Hall offices, while much of the
academic work — the open
shop computing availale to fa
culty, staff and students — was
done on terminals in Pine Hall
in the Jordan Quad.
