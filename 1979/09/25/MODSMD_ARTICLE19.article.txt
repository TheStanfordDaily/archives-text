# Campus gets facelift – mall, renovations, even fire escapes
## 
### Jill Liscom 
Construction of the new
Galvez Mall, designed "to
keep vehicular circulation out
of the main part of campus," is
scheduled to be completed
sometime in November, ac
cording to Peter Hopf, as
sociate director of facilities.
The Mall, formerly Galvez
Street, is between Green Lib
rary and Crothers Memorial
Hall.
When completed, the mall
will include a large field for
student recreation, a smaller is
land toward the southern end
that will be planted with flow-

ers, and a service road to pro
„ vide access to the libraries.
According to John Lerry,
facilities engineer, the end be
tween Hoover Tower and En
cina Hall will be more formal in
appearance, but it is "all rather
simple."
"The whole purpose is to
make it as simple as possible
but still provide maximum
use," said Lerry.
According to Hopf, replac
ing Galvez Street is part of a
long-range University plan to
change from an arrangement
with streets criss-crossing
through campus to an ar

rangement with streets around
the outside of campus, with
access roads leading in where
necessary.
Ultimately this will limit the
interior of campus principally
to bicycles and pedestrians..
Serra Street
The Galvez Mall, being built
at an estimated cost of
$324,000, is only one of several
major University construction
projects currently underway.
Another is renovation of Serra
Street, located in front of the
Quad, which will cost $400,000,
according to Lerry.
Lerry said Serra Street

needed repaving because it
had deteriorated to the point
that "it wasn't safe to ride a
bike on it." However, the
street was also modified to in
clude an island separating
Serra Street and the Oval at the
end of Palm Drive so that off
campus buses can drive up and
around the Oval without going
onto Serra Street. The island
will serve as "a big bus stop,"
said Lerry. ,
Serra Street will then serve
only the Marguerite bus, ser
vice vehicles, and "a large
number of bicycles," Lerry
explained. Some parking

space, with access from Palm
Drive, will also be provided on
Serra.
Major construction is also
being done in several parts of
the Quad, including buildings
120 and 170 and the History
Corner.
History Corner
According to Hopf, the His
tory Corner is a "totally recon
structed facility" which will
house the History department,
International Relations de
partment, and Western Culture
program. Hopf said those de
partments are now in the pro
cess of moving into the build-

ing, and it is hoped that several
seminar rooms will be ready
for use this quarter. The build
ing will be in full use by winter
quarter, said Hopf.
One of the main reasons for
the reconstruction was to
make the building as ear
thquake proof as possible, said
Hopf, "which called for a great
deal of structural work." The
project also aimed at pro
viding better facilities, improv
ing the working environment,
and generally "making it into a
modern building," Hopf ad
ded.
Similar reconstruction is
scheduled to begin this fall in
building 120 of the Quad, al
though it will be "more com
plex because of the design of
the building," said Hopf. The
estimated cost is $10.6 million.
Building 170, currently the

History department, will un
dergo interior reconstruction
once that department moves to
the completed History Corner.
Building 170 will then
house University Public Affairs
and the Legal Office, which
now have inadequate space.
According to Hopf, the re
modeling plans for the base
ment, and first and second
floors of Building 170 include
partitioning, ventilation, fire
detection systems and basic re
furbishing.
Quad renovation
Other changes in the Quad
area include landscaping of the
Citrus Courtyard, behind
building 170 in the Inner Quad,
and repaving of the east cour
tyard opposite the Main Lib
rary. Renovation of the east
courtyard will also include
planting palm trees and instal
ling lights to make the area
"much more attractive" as well
as safer for bicyclists, accord
ing to Lerry.
Approximately $600,000 has
also been spent for fire safety
modifications in 22 of the Row
Houses, according to Bridget
Morgan, planner analyst.
According to Edward Scoles,
director of Housing manage
ment, fire marshalls did a
series of inspections last year,
resulting in the making of plans
to upgrade and/or install fire
safety systems in the older
University residences with a
focus on "life safety."
Smoke detectors
Modifications included
extending the existing smoke
detector systems in many of
the houses to cover common
living areas such as lounges
and dining areas, in addition to
installing smoke detector sys
tems where none existed pre
viously. The detector systems
are designed to give residents
at least a 20-minute warning of
fire before their lives are in
immediate danger, Scoles said.
New smoke detector sys
tems are also being installed
in Branner and Toyon dor
mitories-, and the system is
being extended to common liv
ing areas in Roble Hall.
( he fire exits from the upper
floors of the Row houses were
also improved or rebuilt, par
ticularly in those houses where
the fire exits were not fixed
structures or did not reach the
ground.
lacksnn Library
lackson Library in the
Graduate School of Business
opened this week after being
closed for remodeling totalling

about $2 million.
According to Paul Johnson,
assistant dean for administra
tion, the third floor deck of the
library was covered over a year
ago, and the interior is cur
rently being completed.
Johnson said about half of the
space is devoted to faculty,
administrative and Ph.D. of

fices, and the other half is
being used for storage of lib
rary materials, principally
materials over 10 years old.
The second floor is also
being remodeled where 32 of
the 68 Ph.D. cubicles have
been eliminated. That space is
now being converted into stor
age space and an enlarged area

tor study purposes. The first
floor has also been enlarged
and generally upgraded.
lohnson said the renova
tions were proposed several
years ago due to a need for
storage space and more of
fices, and also to upgrade the
library because "technology
has changed so much."

The new Green Library is coming together. Scheduled for completion in mid-winter, almost one year
behind schedule, it is facing problems acquiring suitable shelving and had to deal with a flood last spring
which caused more than $250,000 worth of damage.

Serra Street, which runs across the front of the Quad, is undergoing major repairs to fill up its numerous
potholes.
