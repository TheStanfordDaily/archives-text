# UGLY transforms floor pattern

Larlier this fall, the Meyer Undergraduate Library
(UGLY) floor plan underwent a number of significant
changes, including the complete rearrangement of cir
culating books, the separate consolidations of reserve
books, reference books and periodicals and the reloca
tion of the reference desk, according to Elizabeth Salzer,
head of Meyer libraries.
During the week of Sept. 10-14, the library closed its
doors to allow workers to rearrange its circulating books
into an alphabetical format. Books with call numbers
beginning with A-D are now stacked on the fourth floor,
t-PR on the third and PS-Z on the second. Books had
been previously arranged by broad subject groupings.
Reference books, reserve books and periodicals
which were formerly scattered throughout the library
according to subject area are now collected in their own
respective sections on the second floor.
"Every book in the library got moved as part of the
shift — some of them twice," Salzer explained.
"The reference a<-sk is in a better location for getting
major traffic. It is now located between the main stair
case and the elevator, whi( h are the two main routes by
which people enter the library," Salzer noted. She
explained that the information desk had not been clearly
visible to library users.
Minor changes
Salzer also reported a number of "fairly minor
changes," such as the addition and reposition of a
number of carrels, the addition of several shelves, and
the relocation of the newspapers to be included in the
periodical section.

The changes, implemented by crews of high school
and college students were made in response to studen
surveys and needs, Salzer said.
Last spring, while the library's new air conditioning
system was under construction, several portions of the
library temporarily were closed. All reference books and
reserve books were moved temporarily to a single loca
tion at that time.
Green changes
Also, all the circulating books in Green Library will be
placed in an alphabetical form similar to that now
employed by Meyer and the Library of Congress. Such
uniformity will make research easier for students, said
Salzer.
Reference books will also be easily accessible to staf
fers at the information desk and will relieve reference
workers of the trouble of "running from one part of the
building to another to, get a book," she added.
Two student surveys revealed a preference for the
current arrangement over the old one and also showed a
desire for the installation of a similar alphabetical ar
rangement for periodicals, Salzer said.
Extended change
Planning for the moves began last spring after the
surveys were taken and continued throughout the
summer.
"Change is still going on and will for some time,"
Salzer said, explaining that telephones and permanent
computer terminals have yet to be installed at a number
of staff desks which will occupy former study carrel
locations deemed improperly loud or bustling for effec
tive study.
