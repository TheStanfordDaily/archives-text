# American wine market ripening
## 
### Associated Press 
By the glass, the bottle and
the jug, Americans are down
ing millions of gallons of wine
with the market expected to
more than double by the end
of the next decade.
Marvin Shanken, editor and
publisher of Impact, a wine
and distilled spirits industry
newsletter, said that wine
shipments within the United
States last year totaled 430 mill
ion gallons — about two gal
lons per capita — up to 61 per
cent from the 267 million gal
lons shipped in 1970.
By 1990, Shanken said, wine
shipments should total 1.1 bill
ion gallons.
California growers, who
provide a little more than 70
percent of the wine Americans
drink, are in the midst of har
vesting this year's grapes and

the producers predict an excel
lent crop, in terms of both
quantity and quality.
The biggest boom has come
in sales of white wine, which
has been replacing other al
coholic beverages as a before
meal drink. In 1970, Shanken
said, 50 percent of the wine
drunk in the United States was
red; 24 percent was rose; and
26 percent was white. By 1977,
38 percent was red; 22 percent
was rose; and 40 percent was
white.

How can you tell what to
buy?
"Be adventuresome," said
Shanken. "Try different wine
types from different areas.
There is no reason to go out of
the $2 to $4 price range. Don't
be intimidated — by the re
tailer, by your friends or by the

wine itself. See what you per
sonally enjoy. 7
Compare prices. Experiment
with lesser-known brands.
Check vintages, but do not
avoid a wine just because it was
made in a particular year. Good
wines are made in bad years
and vice versa.
Learn how to read a wine
label. Recent changes in gov
ernment regulations are de
signed to provide more infor
mation for consumers and to
make sure that the description
on the label is accurate. The
rules are gradually being im
plemented. Here are some
to look for:
Trade jargon defined
— Appellation of origin: The
place where the wine was
made. If a wine label lists a par
ticular place — a country, state,
county, etc. — at least 75 per

cent of the wine has to come
from that place. If the label in
dicates that the wine comes
from a viticultural area — a
specific grape-growing region
like the Napa Valley of Califor
nia or the Burgundy district of
France — at least 85 percent of
the wine must come from that
area.
— Varietal wine: A wine
from a particular type of grape
like zinfandel, pinot noir or
cabernet. At least 75 percent of
the volume of a wine labeled
with ayarietal name must come
from the type of grape that is
listed. If two or three types of
grapes are listed, the percen
tage of each must be included
on the label. Note: Wines
made from labrusca grape var
ieties are exempt from the 75
percent rule since these grapes
have a very strong-flavor.
