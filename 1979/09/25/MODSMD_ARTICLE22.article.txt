# Ireland prepares for Pope John Paul's visit

Dublin, Ireland (AP) â€” Without a doubt, the
visit of Pope John Paul II to Ireland this week
will set off the biggest media donnybrook
since President John F. Kennedy landed in a
helicopter on the ancestral potato farm.
In Irish history it may rank as the greatest
religious happening, barring miracles down
the centuries, since St. Patrick shook up the
druids by lighting a big bonfire across from
the hills of Tara one Easter morning. The high
kings saw the light and embraced Christian
ity.
The first papal visit ever to the 97 percent
Catholic Irish Republic should empty out
every cottage and farmhouse from the tip of
Donegal to the last lane in Kerry, given the
popularity of the present incumbent in the
Chair of Peter. But surprisingly, Popes have
not been all that popular in Ireland, despite
the overwhelming piety of the people.

No nation in history has been more loval to
Rome, and few a bigger pain in the papal
tiara.
"The Irish obey but they still do it their
way," reported a papal nuncio who had been
dispatched by Gregory the Great to bring the
Irish into line on custom and ritual. That was
almost a millenium and a half ago.
Ireland's first contact with the papacy came
in 431 when Pope Celestino sent Palladius to
"convert this pagan isle," but he died and St.
Patrick got the job.
The Irish went their own way, celebrating
an earlier Easter, allowing some of the clergy
to marry, despite the efforts of Popes Hon
orius, John IV and Gregory VII to get them to
conform, The popes were further piqued
when the Irish showed no great enthusiasm
to join the Crusades.
