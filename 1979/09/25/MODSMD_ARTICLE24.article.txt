## Treasures of Tutankhamun 
### 
Fifty-seven years ago, on the
floor of Egypt's hot and barren
Valley of the Kings, British ar
chaelogist Howard Carter un
covered what often is consi
dered the most spectacular ar
chaelogical discovery of the
20th century. Most of the tombs
in the valley, the burial place of
the pharaohs of the Egyptian
empire, had long before been
ransacked by grave robbers.
But after six years of searching,
Carter broke the centuries-old
seals and peered into the virtu
ally untouched tomb of the boy
pharaoh, Tutankhamun.
I he Treasures of Tutankha
mun exhibit .it San Francisco's
dc ? Young Museum tries to re
create Carter's journey as he
became the first man in 30 cen

turies todescend into KingTut's
tomb. By and large it is very suc
cess! ul. The objects are placed
in the approximate order in
which they were discovered
and divided into rooms roughly
corresponding to the rooms of
the tomb. A photographer ac
companied Carter's expedition
and on the walls of the gallery
are large photomurals showing
the ancient rooms as they were
when first reopened and the
laces of the archaeologists as
they chipped through the
tomb's walls to reveal its trea
sures.
Armed with a tape-recorded
tour by Orson Welles, one en
ters the exhibition by passing a
huge photo of the desolate Val
ley of the Kings. Welles tells

how Carter was about to give
up his long search when a
workman found, under a pile
of rubble, a staircase leading
into the earth.
The first object we see was
found in the entrance corridor
and Welles describes how
it must have been for the
archaeologists when they were
assured their discovery was in
deed a pharaoh's tomb. Ancient
Egyptians deified their rulers
and the first case of the exhibit
contains a wooden head por
traying the sun god, with the
features of the infant Tut,
emerging from a lotus. Accord
ing to an Egyptian myth, the first
event of creation was the sun
rising from such a flower.
Next we enter the An
techamber with its relics ot
Tutankhamun's life on earth.
(Welles tells us the name was
probably pronounced tut-an
ka-mun.) In this room is a beaut
iful wooden chair that may have
been used at Tut's coronation
when he was 9. On its back is
the figure of the god of eternity,
Heh, who promises the young
king immortality.
We also see Tut's crook, the
hook-shaped rod with strips of
glass and gold that pharaohs
held across their chest along
with a flail as a symbol of kings
hip. There are several carvings
in alabaster, a white semi
translucent stone.
Among these is a chalice in
the form of a lotus blossom
flanked by two images of the
god Heh. The inscription prom
ises happiness and eternal life
to those who love Thebes, the
ancient capital to which Tut's
court returned after his sup
posed father (his parentage is
uncertain), the heretic Akhena
ton, had built a new city and a
new religion at what today is
Tell El-Amarna.
Picture show
As we turn the corner, we see
a photo of Carter and his spon
sor, the Earl of Carnarvon, look
ing excitedly through a crevice

I — 1
at a solid gold wall. Wells tells
us that this is the wall of the
burial room where the
pharaoh's body would rest
while his soul journeyed to the
netherworld. In this room are
some of the most fabulous ob
jects discovered in the tomb.
There are rings, necklaces and
staffs of solid gold inlaid with
jewels and carvings. An alabas
ter lion sits atop a jar whose
base crushes the heads of four
enemies of Egypt. We see the
pharaoh's gold dagger and one
ot the long-handled ostrich
feather fans that his servants
carried to cool him.
But at the end of this room is
the most impressive item of all,
the solid gold funeral mask that
covered the head of Tutankha
mun's mummy. It was smaller
than I had expected, but much
more vivid. The features of the
mummy indicate that the mask
is an excellent likeness of the
king at his death at 18. The
pharaoh's face is all gold and his
massive headdress is striped
with bands of blue opaque
glass. Perched on his forehead
are the cobra and the vulture,
symbols ot Egyptian royalty,
and on his <hin is a long, thin
false beard, symbol of divinity.
Mummy mask
On a nearby wall is a photo of
the mask as it was discovered in
the tomb, over the head of the
mummy and with the flat part ot
the headdress flush with the rim
of the stone coffin, whose lid
had just been raised by Carter's
team.
In the next room, guarded by
the picture o! the giant-eared
jackel god that stood watch in
the tomb, are more of the king's
personal treasures and many of
the items Egyptians considered

necessary to be comfortable in
the next life. There is a model of
a Nile barge, perhaps repre
senting one used in Tut's fun
eral procession. A wooden
statue gilded with gold and
bronze shows the next stage in
his journey. Tut rides the back
of a leopard as part of the tradi
tional passage of dead kings
through the netherworld.
In the afterlife
For the king's use, there are
many pieces of jewelry and
even writing implements. Egyp
tians considered it important
that a pharaoh be well provided
for. In case a god should ask
Tutankhamun to perlorm some
work, his subjects provided him
with more than 400 servant
statues to fill in for him. In the
exhibit we see one of these ser
vants, a wooden shawabty fi
gure, given as a gift by one ot
Tut's generals.
Inlaid chest
In further rooms we find one
of the king's gaming boards (it
appears the pharaoh was very
fond of games), a hunting bow,
and finally, an elaborately
inlaid chest, considered one of
the masterpieces of Egyptian
art. Its sides depict hunting
scenes and fighting animals,
while its lid portrays Tutan
khamun and Queen An
khesenamun in an intimate
garden scene.
The exhibit itself is spacious
and well laid out, which is for
tunate, because it is very
crowded. We waited about
minutes outside before being
allowed in and often had to
view popular objects like the
gold mask through numerous
shoulders and heads. You are
allowed only one run through
the exhibit per ticket and once
leaving any room, you are not
allowed to reenter.
The exhibit itself also is rather
small. Only 55 out of the more
than 5000 objects found in Tut's
tomb are displayed. This is
probably desirable though, as
one tends to leave the exhibit

with a sense of awe rather than
of saturation.
Tickets
The Treasures ol Futankha
mun exhibit is on loan from the
Cairo Museum and will finish
its San Francisco stay this Sun
day. Though it has been olfi
cially sold out tor some lime,
there are still tic kets available.
Check with the San Francisco
papers or call KTN-G-T-U-1
After leaving the exhibit
there is a group of pictures
showing the excavation of

I ut s tomb on the valley floor.
High above we see the remains
of the tomb ot Ramses VI. Its
prominent location made it an
easy t.uget tor centuries of
thieves. Tutankhamun was a
minor pharaoh whose sudden
death gave a lew months to
prepare tor his burial. Atter se
eing the treasures of Tut's
tomb, vou only can imagine
the splendor of the mightiest
pharaohs who spent years pre
panng tlu-ir eternal homes.
