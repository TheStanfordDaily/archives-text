# Elton's new magic
## 
### 
In 1977, Elton John told Ray Cooper, his long-time friend and
business associate, that if he ever went on tour again, it would
only be the two of them. By then, Elton had given up the glitter
and exotic eyeglasses that had helped to characterize him as
rock's leading superstar of the '70s, and he begain to view his
career and his music with greater introspection.
So by December 1978, Elton and Ray penciled in a few concerts
"not in huge arenas like before, but in smaller venues." He was
returning to the days before he ever recorded an album, when he
used to play small gigs in local British taverns.
Elton never really had understood typical guitar-oriented
music, and a rock band was for him nothing more than a vehicle
to thrill an audience, as well as a proven formula that worked to
sell albums. Piano, with an occasional moment of percussion,
was what he always knew and liked best. And it was to be this
simplicity and very tasteful arrangement that was to describe
Elton's new sound.
By last May, what originally was intended to be a small, quiet
tour became one of Elton's biggest. The duo already had played
70 concerts all over Western Europe, Israel and finally the Soviet
Union with staggering results. Upon his return to England, Elton
was proclaimed the "new ambassador.''
Elton and Ray obviously were riding high by now. Besides the
triumphant return of the master live, Elton was working on two
albums — one, Victim of Love, to come out within a month, the
other a double album slated for release next April.
So well prepared and deservedly confident in his musician
ship, Elton last week embarked on his two-month North Ameri
can tour, "Back in the U.S.S.A." And there's no doubt about it;
he's greater than he's ever been.
Elton said during last Saturday's concert at the Berkeley Com
munity Theater, "I used to never get nervous before a concert.
Because we was a band. But with the two of us, we just stare
quietly at each other tor half an hour before I go on."
Even if it's true, don't you believe a word of it. This tour shall be
a living testimony that Elton's music is the music of the 70s, in the

way the Beatles dominated rock in the '60s.
Every song he played has that feeling of being a classic, even his
latest single, "Mama Can't Buy You Love." Elton was thoroughly
superb on both acoustic and electric piano. And Ray Cooper,
what can anyone say? You who have never witnessed his manual
dexterity and outrageous energy, your knowledge of percussion
is lacking.
The show from every point of view is undeniably outstanding.
Elton in white satin jacket and pantaloons casually walks across
the stage to pour himself a drink before taking bis seat at the
piano. And what follows is musical magic. All he does is play hit
after hit as if he might be in an empty concert hall, playing some
audition pieces — in the beginning, he rarely faces the audience.
The set design by Paul Staples and David Costa is uncom
promisingly simple. There are only the two pianos positioner] in
front of a billowy-looking white fiberglass dome that curves and
recedes like an endless road. And the way the lights by lames
Dann bounced and swayed and created hot and cold moods in
such subtle degrees, the whole show turned into a world of
fantasy.
But in the end, it was simply the compositions of Elton John and
Bernie Taupin that were so brilliant, first on piano alone and then
with Cooper's tambourine or mellotron or tympani — every burst
of percussion a theatrical essence. The persistent handclapping
of the crowd that brought Elton to pass out carnations and give
more than a half an hour of enccrres let everyone know, especially
Elton, that there was new magic in the air.

After a three-year absence, Elton's back in the U.S.A. on a two-month
tour of 17 cities in the United States and Canada. Last weekend he
brought his small, two-man act to the Berkeley Community Center.
