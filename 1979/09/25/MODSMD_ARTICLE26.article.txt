# Foreigner gets mean in 'Head Games'
## 
### 
Head Games
Foreigner
Atlantic
Foreigner's first two albums
placed this unit of recycled
rock veterans all so safely
among the most despicable of
the slick, teenage, take orgas
mic school of third or fourth
generation "rockers."
The group's technical
abilities always were self
evident; guitarist Mick (ones
and vocalist Lou Cramm are
both extremely competent
professionals, and the remain
der of the band had years of
experience in other bands and
in session work.
But Foreigner's music was
tired and mindless — at best,
cloned Bad Company that was
virtually unlistenable the fifth
or sixth go 'round.
Given this, Head Games,
while hardly a great record,
may well be the year's most
surprising one. The band's
musical ideas are still quite
limited, but on this album, they
are presented in a tight, hard
manner that is almost persua
sive.
Premier producer
It's probably safe to say that
the addition of Koy Thomas
Baker as co-producer (along
with band members (ones and
lan McDonald) is the biggest
reason for the well-made, ser
viceable rock offered here.
And without a doubt, Head
Games, when added to Baker's
work with The Cars, Journey
and Ron Wood, solidities his

position as the premier pro
ducer ot single-oriented rock
that features .1 kind ot "con
trolled meanness."
Baker's changes in the
Foreigner sound are im
mediately obvious. He's given
the rhythm section here a
tougher edge; Baker's indebt
ed to jimmy Page's produc
tion of Led Zeppelin tor the
booming backbeat he
employs, but he is beginning
to give his own personal stamp
to it. Baker also has stream
lined things quite a bit; the
songs come across in short, as
saulting bursts, not letting up.
Cars' touches abound.
"Dirty White Boy," the single,
features foghorn-like
background vocals, and "Se
venteen" employs the slightly
.irhvthmir he.it tavored bv that

hand. Gramm's vocals, as al
ways, sound either like Bad
Company's Paul Rodgers or
somehow like Paul McCartney
in a more upbeat mood.
Baker is the first producer
who has attempted to create
some tension between
Gramm's vocal slickness and
the instrumentation backing
him. Where before, the rest of
Foreigner followed Gramm's
smoothness, here they are
rough and threatening; what
was previously bland is now
vaguely exciting.
Hard roc kers
Head Games' first seven
numbers are straight ahead
three-minute rockers; usually
three verses, heavy on the
chorus and lots of guitar fills
lor effect, fhe lyrics aren't too
insnirinp lint ('.r.imm Ihmwi.

in enough vocal inflection and
tricks to get by, and the re
mainder of the band has never
been punchier or tighter.
Jones is experienced enough
to show restraint when neces
sary, and sometimes he lets
himself cut loose — towards
the end of "Seventeen," he ac
tually begins to soar. Jones
even adds a tinny, affecting
vocal 011 "The Modern Day,"
one ot those paeans about evil
progress.
The album falters in its last
three tracks: "Blinded by Sci
ence," "Do What You like,"
and "Rev on the Red Line" are
either ballads (the first two) or
emphasize keyboards over
guitars (the last). The
McCartneyesque ballads fade
quickly from memory, but
"Red Line" is yet another

prime example of Foreigner
being so far removed from the
real world that their music
sometimes seems' meant for
clones spawned out of Kiss
comic books. "Red Line" is
supposed to be about cars and
the feeling of going fast, but it
comes off sounding like blood
less, heartless," sweatless
Springsteen, or alternately, like
half-drunk early Beach Boys..
So, while this album indi
cates that there may be some
hope for Foreigner, the hope is
ofadecidedly limited variety. A
few more albums with Roy
Thomas Baker running the
control boards wouldn't hurt
though. After all, a little "con
trolled meanness" can be good
for you sometimes. Ask any
Stanford freshman.

Premier producer
It's probably safe to say that
the addition of Koy Thomas
Baker as co-producer (along
with band members (ones and
lan McDonald) is the biggest
reason for the well-made, ser
viceable rock offered here.
And without a doubt, Head
Games, when added to Baker's
work with The Cars, Journey
and Ron Wood, solidities his

position as the premier pro
ducer ot single-oriented rock
that features .1 kind ot "con
trolled meanness."
Baker's changes in the
Foreigner sound are im
mediately obvious. He's given
the rhythm section here a
tougher edge; Baker's indebt
ed to jimmy Page's produc
tion of Led Zeppelin tor the
booming backbeat he
employs, but he is beginning
to give his own personal stamp
to it. Baker also has stream
lined things quite a bit; the
songs come across in short, as
saulting bursts, not letting up.
Cars' touches abound.
"Dirty White Boy," the single,
features foghorn-like
background vocals, and "Se
venteen" employs the slightly
.irhvthmir he.it tavored bv that

hand. Gramm's vocals, as al
ways, sound either like Bad
Company's Paul Rodgers or
somehow like Paul McCartney
in a more upbeat mood.
Baker is the first producer
who has attempted to create
some tension between
Gramm's vocal slickness and
the instrumentation backing
him. Where before, the rest of
Foreigner followed Gramm's
smoothness, here they are
rough and threatening; what
was previously bland is now
vaguely exciting.
Hard roc kers
Head Games' first seven
numbers are straight ahead
three-minute rockers; usually
three verses, heavy on the
chorus and lots of guitar fills
lor effect, fhe lyrics aren't too
insnirinp lint ('.r.imm Ihmwi.

in enough vocal inflection and
tricks to get by, and the re
mainder of the band has never
been punchier or tighter.
Jones is experienced enough
to show restraint when neces
sary, and sometimes he lets
himself cut loose — towards
the end of "Seventeen," he ac
tually begins to soar. Jones
even adds a tinny, affecting
vocal 011 "The Modern Day,"
one ot those paeans about evil
progress.
The album falters in its last
three tracks: "Blinded by Sci
ence," "Do What You like,"
and "Rev on the Red Line" are
either ballads (the first two) or
emphasize keyboards over
guitars (the last). The
McCartneyesque ballads fade
quickly from memory, but
"Red Line" is yet another

prime example of Foreigner
being so far removed from the
real world that their music
sometimes seems' meant for
clones spawned out of Kiss
comic books. "Red Line" is
supposed to be about cars and
the feeling of going fast, but it
comes off sounding like blood
less, heartless," sweatless
Springsteen, or alternately, like
half-drunk early Beach Boys..
So, while this album indi
cates that there may be some
hope for Foreigner, the hope is
ofadecidedly limited variety. A
few more albums with Roy
Thomas Baker running the
control boards wouldn't hurt
though. After all, a little "con
trolled meanness" can be good
for you sometimes. Ask any
Stanford freshman.

Head Games
Foreigner
Atlantic
Foreigner's first two albums
placed this unit of recycled
rock veterans all so safely
among the most despicable of
the slick, teenage, take orgas
mic school of third or fourth
generation "rockers."
The group's technical
abilities always were self
evident; guitarist Mick (ones
and vocalist Lou Cramm are
both extremely competent
professionals, and the remain
der of the band had years of
experience in other bands and
in session work.
But Foreigner's music was
tired and mindless — at best,
cloned Bad Company that was
virtually unlistenable the fifth
or sixth go 'round.
Given this, Head Games,
while hardly a great record,
may well be the year's most
surprising one. The band's
musical ideas are still quite
limited, but on this album, they
are presented in a tight, hard
manner that is almost persua
sive.
