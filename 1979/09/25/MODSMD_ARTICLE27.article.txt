# Kenny Loggins in Berkeley: Singer and audience join in song
## 
### 
Kenny Loggins does more than make music — onstage, he is
music. He moves to the tune and talks with an audience almost as
smoothly as he sings.
And listening to him Friday at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley
was listening to a voice cascading neatly from one song to the
next, from slow to fast, from ballad to boogie, from "Danny's
Song" to "Angry Eyes."
Loggins was not alone. Backed up by his band, and at times by
the audience, he led the show, not into a frenzy, but into har
mony. When he sang "Danny's Song," his audience responded
as he let his voice drown out, "Everything ... is gonna be all
right." And for the second encore, he had us singing "Celebrate
Me Home" — all the way to Oakland, he exhorted.
There was something incongruous about the setting This was
hardly Greek tragedy; but there was Kenny darting in and out of
the columns of the huge pantheon stage, 112 irst he sang all the way
over on one side; then he scattered all the way over to the other
to sav hello to the audience there.
There was a little blond boy in front of us who slept through
most of an uninspiring pre-pubescent/punk rock performance by

Carole King's daughter, Louise. But when Loggins came on the
boy began bobbing and swaying, crashing his head against his
mother's elbow on the left then his father's on the right. "I love
Kenny Loggins," the tyke informed me; "I saw him last year at
Tahoe."
"What's your favorite?"! asked.
"Christopher Robbin, Christopher Robbin," he told me. Not
long after that Loggins brought out a stool and said he'd like to
dedicate these few songs to a friend of mine, Jimmy Messina."
With that his voice dropped into "House at Pooh Corner" and
the boy began singing along, together with most of the audience.
Loggins let his voice drop towards the end, and the amphitheater
was filled with the sound of thousands of microphone-less voices
singing, "Help me if you can, I've got to get back to the House at
Pooh Corner by one — you'd be surprised, there's so much to be
done . . . Count all the bees in the hive, chase all the clouds from
the sky."
l oggins mixed many of his solo songs from later albums such as
Nightwatch with older music he wrote and performed with Mes
sina. He also threw in a few tunes from a new album, Send the

Fire, due to be released this week. A particularly moving song
from the new album was a ballad, "Now and Then."
He is a performer who seems to be into listening to his audi
ence as much as it is into listening to him.
Tuning in
"Sometimes, you can sing a song and it takes on an entirely new
meaning depending on your audience," he said after describing
how he had sung days earlier at a Solar-Cal benefit in Santa Cruz.
"Are you waiting for a miracle? Stand up and fight. Stand up and
fight."
For his first encore, Loggins sang "Whenever I Call You
Friend." Lt would have been too good to be true to ask Stevie
Nicks to walk out and sing along, so she didn't.
Then after he was gone, the lights didn't come on and the fans
continued. So once more he walked out, and this time he started
but then he stopped, and he let the audience carry the concert
home. "Please celebrate me home" came wafting over the thea
ter and drifted "clear to Oakland."
