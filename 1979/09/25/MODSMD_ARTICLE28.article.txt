# Drama Department's 'Erasmus Montanus'
## The 						man who (thought he) knew too much 
### 
The play may be unfamiliar, but what
it says should be recognized easily by
students here. That's how Danish direc
tor Fritz Brun sees Erasmus Montanus,
the 1723 comedy that opens the Drama
Department season.
Erasmus, written by Brun's country
man Ludvig Holberg, centers on a
farmer's son who attends a university
for social prestige and "falls in love with
academia, swallows it up, and puts on a
ridiculous academic identity."
When he returns to his village, Eras
mus neither can communicate with his
family and friends nor can he identify
with his past. In turn, the villagers find
his highbrow language and ideas too
big for their own narrow views of the
world. Everyone operates at a different
level, Brun said. Each is entrenched in
the rut of his existence.
It all comes down to a competition
between Erasmus and a village wit, with
results that provoke both laughter and
"dramatize problems that are still with
us."
Caricatures
Brun said Holberg, a Copenhagen
professor, wanted to satirize the
super-intellectual and biases for and
against academia, but his jokes and
caricatures today seem less absurdly
drawn because of changing social at
titudes.

Now, "students here can recognize
themselves and their professors im
mediately," Brun said. "The play is in
teresting to the Stanford community,
because students experience the same
conflict of identitv.
"Erasmus is not unlike the aver-
student uway from home
tor the first time, trying to assume his
own identity and fighting to come to
terms with life — and being a little
ridiculous but basically full of promise
for the happy outcome of the struggle
for maturity."
Another familiar aspect of the play,
Brun said, is a communication gap di
viding scientific knowledge and com
mon sense. The scientist views a table
as "a sea of floating electrons," Brun
said, while the layman considers it as "a
place to put down his coffee cup.
"Everyone sees the world differently
and in this play each person tries to
impose his world view on the others."
Holberg encouraged people to "try
to reconcile their world views," Brun
said, "But he wanted them to be open,
without being spineless."
The playwright was optimistic about
the world's chances, despite its "crazy"
inhabitants. "I sympathize with him,"
Brun said, "because I also see much
craziness. And I can't live on disillu
sion. The world must make sense. If it

doesn't, I couldn't live in it."
Brun will use a 1914 translation and
will stage Erasmus Montanus in Asst.
Prof. William Eddelman's sky
dominated set.
"This setting is ideal for the play, be
cause it is so closely related to the space
age. The questions of identity and of
science versus the senses have become
even more important today."

Auditions for Erasmus Montanus will
be held at 7:30 p.m. today and tomor
row in the Liftle Theater. Scripts may
be signed out overnight at the Drama
Department office in the back hall of
Memorial Auditorium. The show will
open Oct. 31 and will run Nov. 1-3 and
Nov. 7-10 in the Little Theater.

The costumes, designed by Prof.
Douglas Russell, will suggest re
semblances between characters and
domestic animals. "What separates
man from animal? It's his ability to lift
himself beyond instinct," Brun said.
"But in this play, we have a human zoo:
the pig, the sheep the fox, the dog."
Brun ranks Holberg with Ibsen and
Strindberg and calls Erasmus Montanus
a world classic.
Holberg wrote more than 25 com
edies and helped establish the national
theaters of Denmark and Russia. He

was half artist and half academic, Brun
said, "brave as all great artists are" but
careful to choose the moments of his
attacks on society.
Because of government restrictions,
he had difficulty in saying what he
wanted, yet he won acclaim and be
came a "Kenneth Clark of his time, an
international voice in history and
philosophy."
Holberg hid Erasmus Montanus in a
drawer for 17 years because he feared
reprisals for his unveiling of academic
hypocrisy.
Yet, Brun noted, the author left hope
that Erasmus and the world would
"grow out of its vices. Erasmus indulges
in excessive absentmindedness, for in
stance, but most painful is the mixture
he represents of a lot of half-digested
knowledge and a total want of the
humaneness and wisdom which we
would like to think accompany univer
sity learning."
Brun, born in 1936, is a third-year
doctoral student in drama. He attended
the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and
has worked as an actor, a director and
an artistic director in Danish theater
companies, film and television. He has
traveled and studied extensively in the
Soviet Union and specializes in modern
Soviet theater.

mon sense. The scientist views a table
as "a sea of floating electrons," Brun
said, while the layman considers it as "a
place to put down his coffee cup.
"Everyone sees the world differently
and in this play each person tries to
impose his world view on the others."
Holberg encouraged people to "try
to reconcile their world views," Brun
said, "But he wanted them to be open,
without being spineless."
The playwright was optimistic about
the world's chances, despite its "crazy"
inhabitants. "I sympathize with him,"
Brun said, "because I also see much
craziness. And I can't live on disillu
sion. The world must make sense. If it

doesn't, I couldn't live in it."
Brun will use a 1914 translation and
will stage Erasmus Montanus in Asst.
Prof. William Eddelman's sky
dominated set.
"This setting is ideal for the play, be
cause it is so closely related to the space
age. The questions of identity and of
science versus the senses have become
even more important today."

Auditions for Erasmus Montanus will
be held at 7:30 p.m. today and tomor
row in the Liftle Theater. Scripts may
be signed out overnight at the Drama
Department office in the back hall of
Memorial Auditorium. The show will
open Oct. 31 and will run Nov. 1-3 and
Nov. 7-10 in the Little Theater.

The costumes, designed by Prof.
Douglas Russell, will suggest re
semblances between characters and
domestic animals. "What separates
man from animal? It's his ability to lift
himself beyond instinct," Brun said.
"But in this play, we have a human zoo:
the pig, the sheep the fox, the dog."
Brun ranks Holberg with Ibsen and
Strindberg and calls Erasmus Montanus
a world classic.
Holberg wrote more than 25 com
edies and helped establish the national
theaters of Denmark and Russia. He

was half artist and half academic, Brun
said, "brave as all great artists are" but
careful to choose the moments of his
attacks on society.
Because of government restrictions,
he had difficulty in saying what he
wanted, yet he won acclaim and be
came a "Kenneth Clark of his time, an
international voice in history and
philosophy."
Holberg hid Erasmus Montanus in a
drawer for 17 years because he feared
reprisals for his unveiling of academic
hypocrisy.
Yet, Brun noted, the author left hope
that Erasmus and the world would
"grow out of its vices. Erasmus indulges
in excessive absentmindedness, for in
stance, but most painful is the mixture
he represents of a lot of half-digested
knowledge and a total want of the
humaneness and wisdom which we
would like to think accompany univer
sity learning."
Brun, born in 1936, is a third-year
doctoral student in drama. He attended
the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and
has worked as an actor, a director and
an artistic director in Danish theater
companies, film and television. He has
traveled and studied extensively in the
Soviet Union and specializes in modern
Soviet theater.

Erasmus Montanus director Fritz Brun
The play may be unfamiliar, but what
it says should be recognized easily by
students here. That's how Danish direc
tor Fritz Brun sees Erasmus Montanus,
the 1723 comedy that opens the Drama
Department season.
Erasmus, written by Brun's country
man Ludvig Holberg, centers on a
farmer's son who attends a university
for social prestige and "falls in love with
academia, swallows it up, and puts on a
ridiculous academic identity."
When he returns to his village, Eras
mus neither can communicate with his
family and friends nor can he identify
with his past. In turn, the villagers find
his highbrow language and ideas too
big for their own narrow views of the
world. Everyone operates at a different
level, Brun said. Each is entrenched in
the rut of his existence.
It all comes down to a competition
between Erasmus and a village wit, with
results that provoke both laughter and
"dramatize problems that are still with
us."
Caricatures
Brun said Holberg, a Copenhagen
professor, wanted to satirize the
super-intellectual and biases for and
against academia, but his jokes and
caricatures today seem less absurdly
drawn because of changing social at
titudes.

Now, "students here can recognize
themselves and their professors im
mediately," Brun said. "The play is in
teresting to the Stanford community,
because students experience the same
conflict of identitv.
"Erasmus is not unlike the aver-
student uway from home
tor the first time, trying to assume his
own identity and fighting to come to
terms with life — and being a little
ridiculous but basically full of promise
for the happy outcome of the struggle
for maturity."
Another familiar aspect of the play,
Brun said, is a communication gap di
viding scientific knowledge and com
mon sense. The scientist views a table

said, while the layman considers it as "a
