# S.F. symphony season
## Edo picks pleasers 
### 
This year's San Francisco
Symphony season promises to
be a great crowd-pleaser. In
stead of baffling the public
with unfamiliar programs,
music director Edo de Waart
has mixed famous master
pieces with those lesser
known works that every music
director feels must be intro
duced to the public.
For example, on May 14, 16
and 17, Ravel'sßo/ero has been
scheduled alongside the
American premiere of Steve
Reich's Music for Strings.
The season's schedule also
offers a fine string of guest sol
oists. Those interested in
seldom-heard works may
enjoy Milhaud's Concerto for
Percussion, Jan. 30 and Feb. 1
and 2. The performance will
feature the symphony's out
standing tympanist, Barry
lekowsky.
Pianist
Also featured on the prog
ram will be Bartok's Music for
Strings, Percussion and
Celesta, and Brahms' Piano
Concerto No. 1. The Brahms
will feature Radu Lupu, a
pianist who is noted for his in
terpretation of Beethoven.
Other performances of note
include Mahler's third and
second symphonies, mam
moth works which open and
close the season respectively,
and a performance of Bruch's
popular C Minor Concerto for
Violin by Kyung Wha Chung,
whose playing is characterized
by cleanliness.
The "official" symphony

season at the War Memorial
Opera House does not begin
until late November, but music
lovers can jump the gun by tak
ing advantage of the Mostly
Mozart Festival, Sept. 26
through Nov. 3, at locations
throughout the Bay Area. Prog
rams will feature Mozart's
"Haffner," "Linz" and "Jupi
ter" symphonies, as well as
Haydn's "Surprise," "London"
and "Schoolmaster" sym
phonies.
Three of the festival's more
noteworthy participants are
Alexander Schneider, Barry
Tuckwell and Shlomo Mintz.
Schneider and Tuckwell need
no introduction to most regu
lar concertgoers and Mintz is a
young up-and-coming Israeli
violinist, who was given rave
reviews after his San Francisco
debut last year.
Snap, crackle, pop
The Lively Arts at Stanford is
collaborating on an Oct. 7 re
peat of last year's Picnic with
the San Francisco Symphony.
This year's program will in
clude music by Mozart, Haydn
and Bach. Alexander
Schneider will conduct. This
concert's chief appeal lies in
the informal and friendly sur
roundings of Frost Am
phitheatre. Last year's all-
Beethoven concert was marred
by a miserable outdoor sound
system, whose snap, crackle
and pop did justice to Kellogg's
three times over.
Information about these and
other musical events is availa
ble at Tresidder Ticket Office.
