# Woodstock:
## 'Rock regains some elements of idealism, of faith...in a superb rendering of a few special days' 
### 
Tomorrow night at 7:30,
the Stanford film society will
present the classic rock
movie Woodstock. The 1969
Woodstock rock festival,
held in Sullivan County,
New York, was the biggest
event of its time — in every
way.
Although he cannot pos
sibly do so, director Michael
Wadleigh tries to capture
the totality of the event. The
movie's three-hour running
time covers the event
chronologically, from the
most mundane aspect of try
ing to feed and provide es
sential services for 400,000
people to the most exciting
of Woodstock's rock per
formers.
While the technical qual
ity of the concert footage is
mediocre by today's Last
Waltz standards, the bril
liance of much of the festi
val shines through nonethe
less. From Joan Baez to Sly
Stone, on through to the as
tonishing, classic perfor
mances oi The Who and
Jimi Hendrix, the music of
Woodstock is very great in
deed, even with the prob
lems created by this

record-setting event's size.
But beyond the records it
set — and that stuff is only of
interest to promoters, any
way — Woodstock rep
resented a kind of
watershed moment in rock
history. In terms of its
idealism and its faith in the
power of the kids who be
lieved in it, rock reached its
high point at Woodstock.
Rock then drifted into a cal-
empty cynicism
based largely upon trying to
provide a product to satisfy
a demographically selected
market. The fact that rock
seems to be regaining some
elements of idealism, of faith
makes this movie, and the
memory of the Woodstock
festival, even more special
today.
Woodstock won't tell you
the reason why the '60s
"happened" the way that
they did, and it may not
even give you a clue as to
why the '70s have evolved as
they have. But as a superb
rendering of a special and
deeply influential few days
in our recent past,
Woodstock is unforgetta
ble.
