# Nuclear anxiety spawns illnesses
## 
### 
Middletown, Pa. (AP) â€” Like the
unseen nuclear particles that
peppered this rural town of
10,000 six months ago, the lin
gering anxiety of Three Mile Is
land's neighbors is hard to
measure.
Its level of contaminafion
varies from heavy to non
existent. Some believe the
fear, like radiation, has a half
life of several generations.
"As long as the plant is there,
people in the area will think
about the accident con
stantly," said Mayor Robert
Reid. "If the plant would be
there for the next 100 years, I
think fear is going to be passed
down from generation to gen
eration."
Last March 28, a series of
mechanical malfunctions and
human errors at Three Mile Is
land resulted in leaks ,crf
radioactive material when
uranium in the reactor over
heated.
Local clinics and medical of
fices have also logged a
"boom" since spring.
"People reported experienc

ing stomach upsets, ulcera
tions, shortness of breath and
sleeplessness," said Dr.
George Tokuhata, who is pre
paring a TMI medical study for
the Pennsylvania Health De
partment. He.said the inci
dence among people living
within a 10-mile radius of the
plant "fc> very high."
Illnesses psychosomatic
Tokuhata said he believes
the maladies are psychosoma
tic, or caused by the mental
stress of the accident.
Even those in good health
don't sleep easily. *
"It's an undercurrent that's
with you all the time. We're
guinea pigs. Who knows what
will turn up in our health laten
on?" said Hazel Stoner, whose
small wood house is the closest
dwellingtothe plant's main en
trance.
Residents who say they once
trusted Metropolitan Edison
Co., operator of TMI, now ap
pear skeptical of company as
surances that the outside radia
tion levels were always under
federal safety limits.

But most Middletown resi
dents accept the looming plant
as their fate. Few believe they
have the power to prevent its
billion-dollar reactors from
operating again someday.
"Most of us thought the
plant was going to be good for

the economy and produce
cheap electricity," said George
Boyer, a storeowner for more
than 30 years.
"We're all responsible for it.
We had the chance to stop it,
but we didn't want to. It's too
late now."
