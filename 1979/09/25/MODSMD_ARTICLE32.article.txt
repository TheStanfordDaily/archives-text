Moscow (AP) — The Soviet
press is calling Bob Hope the
"Pentagon's comedian" as the
Kremlin steps up its swipes at
that most American of institu
tions — Hollywood.
. The list of film stars and
movies attracting Moscow's at
tention is growing almost
weekly, including Elizabeth
Taylor, )ane Fonda, John
Travolta, "Apocalypse Now,"
and even James Bond's
"Moonraker."
The latest target of' Soviet
barbs is Hope. His recent trip
to China irked the Soviets,
Tass, the official Soviet news

■
agency, said this weekend, and
not just because of what it said
was his "low standard of com
edy" about Chinese laundries.
"Now this clown, an envoy
of the American military estab
lishment, has visited China and
made a movie whose goal is to
advertise the Pentagon-backed
policy of military and political
rapprochement between Pek
ing and Washington," Tass
maintained.
It said Hope will be involved
soon in a "new venture of a
dubious nature," involving the
Middle East.
