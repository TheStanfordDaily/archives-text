# New state law gives backing to joint child custody options
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The trend toward joint
or shared custody of children after divorce
now has the hefty backing of a new state law
requiring judges to give more consideration
to such arrangements as an alternative to
awarding custody to just one parent.
Assembly Bill 1480, which was signed into
law over the weekend by Gov. Jerry Brown,
"revises the focus of the custody battle,"
comments Persia Woolley, author of The
Custody Handbook. She explains that the
book grew out of her belief that the usual
adversary system of American justice has no
place in child custody situations.
"One of the most important things the bill
does is to require a judge to qonsider award
ing joint custody even if just one parent re
quests it, and it allows him to award joint
custody even if one parent objects," Woolley
said.
The law, authored by Charles Imbrecht
(R-Ventura), attempts to inject a King
Solomon-like justice into the decision. If one
parent demands sole custody with the idea of
keeping the child away from the other pa
rent, but the second parent is willing to in
clude the ex-spouse in the child's life, the
judge can rule for joint custody. If he rules for

sole custody, it must be with the second pa
rent.
Prior to the law, "the judge had absolute
discretion," Woolley said. "He could have
decided against joint custody even if both
parents wanted it."
By studying the variety of arrangements
that divorced couples had made for shared
custody, Woolley believes she has come up
with a how-to book for those who think it
won't work.
"It's a myth that just because people don't
want to be married to each other any longer
they can't cooperate and share in raising their
children," she said.
Woolley acknowledged that some attor
neys, psychologists and others feel that not
enough research has been done on the ef
fects on the children in shared custody-ar
rangements. She is convinced, however, that
in most cases, joint care arrangements are
preferable to a continuing parental tug-of
war.
She readily admits, though, that joint cus
tody is unwise or impossible in some cases.
