## Brown pushes anti-nuclear stand 
### 
Dallas (AP) â€” Caliiornia Gov.
jerry Brown took his unan
nounced presidential cam
paign to the campus of South
ern Methodist University
Monday, heavily emphasizing
his anti-nuclear and pro
environment stands to
applauding students.
"I take a strong position
against nuclear power because
I think it leads to a dead end,"
he said as the audience of sev
eral hundred broke into
applause. "Where are we
going to put the waste and
who's going to guard it?
"That nuclear plant will cost
more to replace than it did to
build it. And where are you
going to put the radioactive
water . . . and where are you
going to vent the radioactive
air?"
After shedding his coat in the
warm, mid-morning sun,
Brown declared that solar
power is the answer to this
country's energy struggle.
"We could have a solar
power satellite that would
generate electricity from the

sun and beam it to earth," he
continued. "That can be done
in 20 years."
Technology lags
The lean, tanned governor
reiterated his positions on the
economy and what he consid
ers to be America's technolog
ical lag.
"We should be moving from a
consumption ethic to an in
vestment ethic in the next 10
years," he explained.
He proposed a type of
Chamber of Commerce on the
Cabinet level to push
American-made products on
the world market; and likened
this venture to the hand-in
hand relationship between
government and business in
japan.
Pull together
"We need to all pull to
gether. If we don't push it,
we're going to get pushed out
of the way."
One student asked how
Brown's positions differ from
those of Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.) the much-discussed
presidential non-candidate.

"Well, I'm the one Democrat
who advocates a balanced
budget,"he asserted. "I'm the
one Democrat who places a
major emphasis on the space
program. I'm the one Democ
rat who has expressed .trong
opposition to nuclear power
and I think I'm the one Democ
rat who advocates shifting the
major economic direction of
the country from investments
leading to more consumption
to saving leading to more in
vestment."
Tax Cut Unlikely
"I think you're going to hear
Edward Kennedy running for
president saying 'Elect me and
I'll give you a $50 million tax
cut' that doesn't exist."
In response to questions,
Brown said he would suppprt
the SALT II agreement even
though it's "not perfect."
"It does put some out limits
on the explosion of nuclear
weapons," he said. "It's one
thing to be macho, to be strong
. . . but it's another thing to be
able to destroy Russia six or

seven times over.
Enough is Enough
"At some point you have to
say enough is enough."
Brown does not think that
the United States should rec
ognize the Palestine Liberation
Organization just yet, and took
the opportunity to jab Presi
dent Carter's foreign poli
cy. I don't think we should
further erode our discredited
foreign policy commitments by
recognizing the PLO," he said.
