# Sunlight ignites Boardwalk

Atlantic City, N.J. (AP) — The golden glitter of
one of Atlantic City's new casinos is causing an
unexpected problem on the Boardwalk. Offi
cials say the sun's rays are bouncing off Caesars'
new casino hotel and causing fires on the
wooden walk.
"They put a piece of paper out there one day
and it burst into flames," Assistant Fire Chief
loseph Goukler )r. said yesterday. "We think it
takes a combination of things: the sun being
right and the wood being dry and maybe the sap
flowing out.
"This doesn't happen in a place like New York
because they don't have a Boardwalk," he ad
ded.
Officials say some panels of the angular,
plexiglass facade around Caesars' new
Boardwalk Regency are warping inward, causing
the concentration of the sun's rays onto a small
area of the Boardwalk.
A solar energy professor told fire officials that
temperatures in the treated pine planks can
reach up to 400 degrees in areas up to 18 inches
in diameter.
Coulker says firefighters have been called out
several times to put out small fires and smolder
ing wood on the Boardwalk.

The heat reportedly ignited a seat cushion of a
pickup truck. On another occasion, Caesars of
ficials tried to cool the boards with water, but
the rush of steam set off a fire alarm.
City Engineer Michael Ingram said the rays
have created two "craters" in the wood as big as
half dollars. In about a dozen other places, the
Boardwalk has scorch marks about 18 inches in
diameter.
"It looks like someone has passed a torch over
the top of the Boardwalk and every now and
then the craters start smoldering," Ingram said.
Caesars executives have downplayed the fire
incidents in front of their casino hotel. But'city
officials say Caesars is replacing the warped
panels.
"It's not a fire hazard," says Peter Boynton,
Caesars' Atlantic City vice-president of opera
tions. "However, we intend toworkwiththecity
to address ourselves to anything it feels requires
attention."
The city Planning Board is already working
with the developers of the Ritz Casino-Hotel to
make sure that structure, which will have large
amounts of reflective glass, doesn't start fires at
its end of the Boardwalk.
