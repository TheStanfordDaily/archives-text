### 
Oakland (AP) — Black Panther leader Huey
Newton waited tensely yesterday in the third
day of deliberations by the jury sitting in
judgement of him concerning the 1974 shoot
ing of Oakland prostitute Kathleen Smith.
The jury of eight women and four men
started their day's considerations with a re
reading of testimony given by former prosti
tute Michelle Jenkins in Newton's first trial
on the murder charge last March. That trial
ended in a hung jury and mistrial.
Jenkins was a prosecution eyewitness in
the first trial. She identified Newton as the
shooter, then recanted the testimony later in
the trial. Her alleged eyewitness account was
read into the record of the current trial last
week, but she did not testify in this tfial.

Serra conducted an abbreviated defense
because, he said, the prosecution had failed
to carry the burden of proof and he, there
fore, was not obliged tQ supply extended af
firmative evidence for his side.
Prosecutor Tom Orloff claimed in closing
arguments that Newton's bail-jumping flight
to Cuba after the shooting was itself an indi
cation of guilt. Newton, 37, fled as Smith, 17,
lay in a coma. She never regained conscious
ness and died later.
. Orloff said Newton shot Smith in a fit of
pique after she failed to recognize his impor
tance.
Serra declared that Newton fled on the or
ders of his Black Panther hierarchy to give
them time to gather evidence in his favor.
