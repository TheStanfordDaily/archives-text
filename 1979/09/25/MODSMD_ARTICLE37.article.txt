Syrian, Israeli fighter planes clash
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian jet fighters and U.S.-made
Israeli F-15s dueled south of Beirut yesterday in the
biggest air battle over lebanon in three months. Four
Soviet-made Syriai , ' l ' were downed, both sides said,
and Syria claimed two Israeli jets were "hit."
The Israelis said all their planes made it safely back to
base.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Thomas
Reston called the air clash a "dangerous development"
and appealed on all sides to exercise restraint.
Syria said its MIG-21s scrambled to intercept the Is
raeli warplanes after the Israelis attacked civilian camps
— presumably Palestinian — in the Damour area 10 miles
south of Beirut. The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv
said its jets, including the F-15, America's most sophisti
cated fighter, were on a reconnaissance mission over
Palestinian guerrilla bases.
The planes headed back west and the dogfight
erupted over the foothills near the airport, the sources
said.
Both 'sides reported four Syrian jets went down.
Lebanese government sources said two crashed in
flames near the airport, and their pilots were seen
parachuting to safety. The other two reportedly went
down farther into the hills. A Syrian military com
munique issued in Damascus said two Israeli jets also
were "hit," but did not say specifically they had crashed.
The Syrians, whose 22,000 troops police a civil-war
armistice in Lebanon, have pledged to defend Lebanese
territory against Israeli air attacks. Israeli jets frequently
fly over Beirut and southern Lebanon on surveillance
missions or to attack Palestinian positions.
State Department spokesman Reston had no com
ment yesterday on whether Israel's use of F-15s over
Lebanon violates U.S. restrictions limiting the aircraft to
self-defense missions. The Israelis say their Lebanon
operations are pre-emptive missions to defend against
Palestinian attack.
Ivory Coast grants Bokassa refuge
Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Deposed emperor )ean Bedel
Bokassa, condemned to death in his Central African
Republic homeland and denied asylum in France, flew
here yesterday and was given refuge by the Ivory Coast's
government.
But his successor, President David Dacko, im
mediately announced he would demand Bokassa's ex
tradition as "a common criminal . . . who killed, raped
and pillaged the state."
Farlier, a radio broadcast from the republic's capital of
Bangui said Dacko had condemned Bokassa to death.
Dacko said that under treaties with the Ivory Coast,
which like his nation is a former French colony, the
extradition "should not pose any problems."
In France, newspapers were severely critical of the
government's actions during the 56 hours Bokassa sat in
his private aircraft at a military base in Evreux, 65 miles
west of Paris, seeking asylum.
Reports from Bangui, where Dacko, with support
from France and other African nations, ousted Bokassa
in a bloodless coup last Thursday, said there was general
bitterness that Bokassa was set free by France.
I he reports also said students and intellectuals who
had led opposition to Bokassa were already complaining
of Dacko's retention of many of the officials who served
under Bokassa.
Bokassa arrived in France on Friday in his personal
Caravelle jet, but was denied permission to disembark.
Yesterday, after the Ivory Coast agreed to give him
asylum, he left his jet, boarded a French Air Force DC-8
and flew to Abidjan with at least six of the 26 persons
who accompanied him to France.
Bokassa, still a French citizen by virtue of service in the
French Army, sought asylum in France, but the govern
ment said he was an "undesirable" and his presence

there was "inopportune." The government's denial of
entry to a French citizen drew the ire of the judiciary.
The ruling Ivory Coast Democratic Party announced
yesterday that in consultation with senior ministers,
army officers, and religious and women's leaders, it had
appealed to President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to grant
Bokassa asylum for "humanitarian reasons."
S.F. teachers to resist court order
San Francisco — A judge yesterday told striking San.
Francisco teachers to get back to work, but union lead
ers said they would defy such an order until they reach a
contract settlement.
A spokesman for the San Francisco Federation of
Teachers Local 61, said the order would be appealed
because "it's very vague and very unclear."
"It doesn't prohibit individual teachers from striking,"
said Julie Koppich, adding that the union attorneys in
terpreted the order as meaning individual teachers
could not-be prosecuted for continuing to stay out of the
classrooms.
Negotiations were set to resume Monday evening.
Acting on a request by a state agency, Superior Court
Judge Robert Merrill ordered the 3600 striking teachers
to stop "calling, engaging in, continuing, sanctioning,
inducing, aiding, encouraging, abetting or assisting any
strike. . .
Merrill's order, however, did not ban picketing by
union members as long as they don't do it on school
property or interfere with children attending classes.
Merrill also told the union to advise its membership of
his order. And he ordered the union's leadership to
appear in court Friday to determine if his temporary
order should become permanent.
Earlier, the union rejected a district proposal to rehire
an additional 200 teachers and impose a one-year wage
freeze, saying only a pay hike will end their week-long
strike.
"It's our view that the offer to rehire 923 teachers
comes very close to offering jobs back to all the laid off
teachers who want to come," said Koppich.
But she said the district's proposal for a 6 percent wage
hike next July 1 — leaving the union with no raise in the
first year of a proposed contract — was unacceptable.
The union is seeking a 13 percent wage increase and
reemployment for 1200 teachers laid off by the district
last spring.
Sun, fun tempt anti-nuke protesters
New York — It was billed as a protest against nuclear
power. By the time it ended, sunny skies, free music and
a controversial issue drew an estimated 200,000 people
yesterday to the tip ot Manhattan for a "No Nukes" rally.
The peaceful day-long gathering was the largest anti
nuclear, pro-solar rally in history and the focus of a day
of similar protests nationwide. There were no arrests or
other incidents here.
"It was mainly for the music that I came, and to re
member Woodstock and the '605," said Princeton stu
dent lanine Verbinski, 20.
"People here will learn about the cause," said )onie
Miller, who came to take a stand against nuc lear energy
and sat in the front row.
Elsewhere, however, protesters blocked the main
gate to the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in Vernon to
disrupt its annual refueling, and police arrested 167 per
sons on charges of unlawful trespass.
The festive crowd on the edge of New York Harbor
heard speeches on the dangers of nuclear power from
political and environmental activists.
"We are here to propose a conversion program from a
nuclear to a non-nuclear society, community by com
munity, state by state, region by region, to an age of
solar energy and renewable resources," said activist
Tom Hayden, who heads the Campaign for Economic
Democracy. His wife, actress lane Fonda, also spoke.

Recession could recruit Kennedy
New York — Sen. Edward Kennedy's suggestion that
he might seek the Democratic nomination if the
economy failed to improve quickly is tantamount to
saying that without a miracle he'll be in the race.
LJnemployment, one of the key measures of public
attitudes, is rising again. The rate of inflation remains
near 13 percent; even if it begins to recede by the end of
the year, as many predict, it might not be soon enough.
Interest rates too are on a similar course. A scattering
of analysts now declare the turn-about may be near, but
even they do not foresee a decline much below
double-digit rates until mid-1980 at the earliest.
fhese indicators — jobs, prices and interest rates —
are among the best understood economic signals,
measuring not abstract monetary or fiscal activities, but
events that immediately affect pocketbooks.
But voters weigh abstractions too. Perhaps not one in
100 understands the technical sophistications of monet
ary policy, but they know the dollar has fallen interna
tionally and that it means weakness.
There are clearcut reminders of this everywhere.
There is no sec,ret, for example, behind the price rise in
various published products from fine prints to old comic
books. They are in limited supply. Dollars, meanwhile,
speed off the printing presses in unlimited quantities.
Studies show that for the first time in the lives ot many
Americans they do not expect the future to be better.
Even during the Great Depression of the 19305, it is
claimed, Americans held to the notion.
Candidate claims youth no drawback
Washington — Sen. Larry Pressler concedes that some
might view his campaign for president as premature for a
young man first elected to public office in 1974.
"Some people will look on it as an ego-centered thing,
but we will just have to let the chips fall where they
may," said 36-year-old Pressler a few days before for
mally announcing his candidacy.
But I'ressler said he became a Republican U.S. senator
trom South Dakota by ignoring conventional wisdom
that said he was either too young or unknown to win
election to federal office.
At the moment, he said in an interview before his
planned Tuesday announcement, "I am not perceived as
a serious contender. . . .
"I am not harboring any illusions," he said, "I am a
realist."
A boyish-faced man who answers questions cauti
ously, Pressler says his initial support will come from

among young voters in their 20s and 30s who are disen
chanted with conventional politics.
So far, he has picked up six delegates in the Florida
presidential preference convention, where Republicans
will meet Nov. 17 to cast largely symbolic votes for vari
ous candidates.
Forest officials initiate reseeding
Massive reseeding operations are underway today in
the fire-ravaged Angeles National Forest as mop-up
crews leave after battling blazes that consumed more
than 50,000 acres in the forest over a 10-day period.
Forest Service officials emphasize that it is a race
against time to accomplish reseeding before the winter
rains come.
The brush fires which raced through Southern
California during this month's near-record heat wave
have consumed 110,000 acres and $400 million worth of
California brush and timber during the 10-day firestorm.
The cost of battling the 27 fires has climbed to $28
million in emergency funds.
The area burnt in the siege set a record, tripling the
total number of acres that were destroyed in 1978. A total
of 469,000 acres were blackened throughout the state
since the fire season began in April.
At least 51 homes were destroyed or damaged in the
last week.
More than 500 of the 7000 firefighters on the line
suffered injuries, most of them minor.
Weary firefighters were sent home Sunday after the
31,500-acre Ventura blaze was officially declared out.
Stocks
New York — The stock market gave up ground yester
day, with analysts blaming the drop on rising gold prices
and a revaluation of the West German mark
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange, which
soared on Friday to 52.38 million shares, fifth largest in
history, slumped considerably.
The price of gold jumped about $10 an ounce in Lon
don and Zurich today to an early price of $378.50 an
ounce. The dollar slipped after a decision by the Euro
pean Monetary System to realign the system's curren
cies.

Candidate claims youth no drawback
Washington — Sen. Larry Pressler concedes that some
might view his campaign for president as premature for a
young man first elected to public office in 1974.
"Some people will look on it as an ego-centered thing,
but we will just have to let the chips fall where they
may," said 36-year-old Pressler a few days before for
mally announcing his candidacy.
But I'ressler said he became a Republican U.S. senator
trom South Dakota by ignoring conventional wisdom
that said he was either too young or unknown to win
election to federal office.
At the moment, he said in an interview before his
planned Tuesday announcement, "I am not perceived as
a serious contender. . . .
"I am not harboring any illusions," he said, "I am a

A boyish-faced man who answers questions cauti

among young voters in their 20s and 30s who are disen

So far, he has picked up six delegates in the Florida

Forest officials initiate reseeding
Massive reseeding operations are underway today in
the fire-ravaged Angeles National Forest as mop-up
crews leave after battling blazes that consumed more
than 50,000 acres in the forest over a 10-day period.
Forest Service officials emphasize that it is a race
against time to accomplish reseeding before the winter
rains come.
The brush fires which raced through Southern
California during this month's near-record heat wave
have consumed 110,000 acres and $400 million worth of
California brush and timber during the 10-day firestorm.
The cost of battling the 27 fires has climbed to $28
million in emergency funds.
The area burnt in the siege set a record, tripling the
total number of acres that were destroyed in 1978. A total
of 469,000 acres were blackened throughout the state
since the fire season began in April.
At least 51 homes were destroyed or damaged in the
last week.
More than 500 of the 7000 firefighters on the line
suffered injuries, most of them minor.
Weary firefighters were sent home Sunday after the
31,500-acre Ventura blaze was officially declared out.

and a revaluation of the West German mark
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange, which
soared on Friday to 52.38 million shares, fifth largest in

Today's weather

Syrian, Israeli fighter planes clash
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian jet fighters and U.S.-made
Israeli F-15s dueled south of Beirut yesterday in the
biggest air battle over lebanon in three months. Four
Soviet-made Syriai , ' l ' were downed, both sides said,
and Syria claimed two Israeli jets were "hit."
The Israelis said all their planes made it safely back to
base.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Thomas
Reston called the air clash a "dangerous development"
and appealed on all sides to exercise restraint.
Syria said its MIG-21s scrambled to intercept the Is
raeli warplanes after the Israelis attacked civilian camps
— presumably Palestinian — in the Damour area 10 miles
south of Beirut. The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv
said its jets, including the F-15, America's most sophisti
cated fighter, were on a reconnaissance mission over
Palestinian guerrilla bases.
The planes headed back west and the dogfight
erupted over the foothills near the airport, the sources
said.
Both 'sides reported four Syrian jets went down.
Lebanese government sources said two crashed in
flames near the airport, and their pilots were seen
parachuting to safety. The other two reportedly went
down farther into the hills. A Syrian military com
munique issued in Damascus said two Israeli jets also
were "hit," but did not say specifically they had crashed.
The Syrians, whose 22,000 troops police a civil-war
armistice in Lebanon, have pledged to defend Lebanese
territory against Israeli air attacks. Israeli jets frequently
fly over Beirut and southern Lebanon on surveillance
missions or to attack Palestinian positions.
State Department spokesman Reston had no com
ment yesterday on whether Israel's use of F-15s over
Lebanon violates U.S. restrictions limiting the aircraft to
self-defense missions. The Israelis say their Lebanon
operations are pre-emptive missions to defend against
Palestinian attack.
Ivory Coast grants Bokassa refuge
Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Deposed emperor )ean Bedel
Bokassa, condemned to death in his Central African
Republic homeland and denied asylum in France, flew
here yesterday and was given refuge by the Ivory Coast's
government.
But his successor, President David Dacko, im
mediately announced he would demand Bokassa's ex
tradition as "a common criminal . . . who killed, raped
and pillaged the state."
Farlier, a radio broadcast from the republic's capital of
Bangui said Dacko had condemned Bokassa to death.
Dacko said that under treaties with the Ivory Coast,
which like his nation is a former French colony, the
extradition "should not pose any problems."
In France, newspapers were severely critical of the
government's actions during the 56 hours Bokassa sat in
his private aircraft at a military base in Evreux, 65 miles
west of Paris, seeking asylum.
Reports from Bangui, where Dacko, with support
from France and other African nations, ousted Bokassa
in a bloodless coup last Thursday, said there was general
bitterness that Bokassa was set free by France.
I he reports also said students and intellectuals who
had led opposition to Bokassa were already complaining
of Dacko's retention of many of the officials who served
under Bokassa.
Bokassa arrived in France on Friday in his personal
Caravelle jet, but was denied permission to disembark.
Yesterday, after the Ivory Coast agreed to give him
asylum, he left his jet, boarded a French Air Force DC-8
and flew to Abidjan with at least six of the 26 persons
who accompanied him to France.
Bokassa, still a French citizen by virtue of service in the
French Army, sought asylum in France, but the govern
ment said he was an "undesirable" and his presence

there was "inopportune." The government's denial of
entry to a French citizen drew the ire of the judiciary.
The ruling Ivory Coast Democratic Party announced
yesterday that in consultation with senior ministers,
army officers, and religious and women's leaders, it had
appealed to President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to grant
Bokassa asylum for "humanitarian reasons."
S.F. teachers to resist court order
San Francisco — A judge yesterday told striking San.
Francisco teachers to get back to work, but union lead
ers said they would defy such an order until they reach a
contract settlement.
A spokesman for the San Francisco Federation of
Teachers Local 61, said the order would be appealed
because "it's very vague and very unclear."
"It doesn't prohibit individual teachers from striking,"
said Julie Koppich, adding that the union attorneys in
terpreted the order as meaning individual teachers
could not-be prosecuted for continuing to stay out of the
classrooms.
Negotiations were set to resume Monday evening.
Acting on a request by a state agency, Superior Court
Judge Robert Merrill ordered the 3600 striking teachers
to stop "calling, engaging in, continuing, sanctioning,
inducing, aiding, encouraging, abetting or assisting any
strike. . .
Merrill's order, however, did not ban picketing by
union members as long as they don't do it on school
property or interfere with children attending classes.
Merrill also told the union to advise its membership of
his order. And he ordered the union's leadership to
appear in court Friday to determine if his temporary
order should become permanent.
Earlier, the union rejected a district proposal to rehire
an additional 200 teachers and impose a one-year wage
freeze, saying only a pay hike will end their week-long
strike.
"It's our view that the offer to rehire 923 teachers
comes very close to offering jobs back to all the laid off
teachers who want to come," said Koppich.
But she said the district's proposal for a 6 percent wage
hike next July 1 — leaving the union with no raise in the
first year of a proposed contract — was unacceptable.
The union is seeking a 13 percent wage increase and
reemployment for 1200 teachers laid off by the district
last spring.
Sun, fun tempt anti-nuke protesters
New York — It was billed as a protest against nuclear
power. By the time it ended, sunny skies, free music and
a controversial issue drew an estimated 200,000 people
yesterday to the tip ot Manhattan for a "No Nukes" rally.
The peaceful day-long gathering was the largest anti
nuclear, pro-solar rally in history and the focus of a day
of similar protests nationwide. There were no arrests or
other incidents here.
"It was mainly for the music that I came, and to re
member Woodstock and the '605," said Princeton stu
dent lanine Verbinski, 20.
"People here will learn about the cause," said )onie
Miller, who came to take a stand against nuc lear energy
and sat in the front row.
Elsewhere, however, protesters blocked the main
gate to the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in Vernon to
disrupt its annual refueling, and police arrested 167 per
sons on charges of unlawful trespass.
The festive crowd on the edge of New York Harbor
heard speeches on the dangers of nuclear power from
political and environmental activists.
"We are here to propose a conversion program from a
nuclear to a non-nuclear society, community by com
munity, state by state, region by region, to an age of
solar energy and renewable resources," said activist
Tom Hayden, who heads the Campaign for Economic
Democracy. His wife, actress lane Fonda, also spoke.

Recession could recruit Kennedy
New York — Sen. Edward Kennedy's suggestion that
he might seek the Democratic nomination if the
economy failed to improve quickly is tantamount to
saying that without a miracle he'll be in the race.
LJnemployment, one of the key measures of public
attitudes, is rising again. The rate of inflation remains
near 13 percent; even if it begins to recede by the end of
the year, as many predict, it might not be soon enough.
Interest rates too are on a similar course. A scattering
of analysts now declare the turn-about may be near, but
even they do not foresee a decline much below
double-digit rates until mid-1980 at the earliest.
fhese indicators — jobs, prices and interest rates —
are among the best understood economic signals,
measuring not abstract monetary or fiscal activities, but
events that immediately affect pocketbooks.
But voters weigh abstractions too. Perhaps not one in
100 understands the technical sophistications of monet
ary policy, but they know the dollar has fallen interna
tionally and that it means weakness.
There are clearcut reminders of this everywhere.
There is no sec,ret, for example, behind the price rise in
various published products from fine prints to old comic
books. They are in limited supply. Dollars, meanwhile,
speed off the printing presses in unlimited quantities.

classrooms.
Negotiations were set to resume Monday evening.
Acting on a request by a state agency, Superior Court
Judge Robert Merrill ordered the 3600 striking teachers
to stop "calling, engaging in, continuing, sanctioning,
inducing, aiding, encouraging, abetting or assisting any
strike. . .
Merrill's order, however, did not ban picketing by
union members as long as they don't do it on school
property or interfere with children attending classes.
Merrill also told the union to advise its membership of
his order. And he ordered the union's leadership to
appear in court Friday to determine if his temporary
order should become permanent.
Earlier, the union rejected a district proposal to rehire
an additional 200 teachers and impose a one-year wage
freeze, saying only a pay hike will end their week-long
strike.
"It's our view that the offer to rehire 923 teachers
comes very close to offering jobs back to all the laid off
teachers who want to come," said Koppich.
But she said the district's proposal for a 6 percent wage
hike next July 1 — leaving the union with no raise in the
first year of a proposed contract — was unacceptable.
The union is seeking a 13 percent wage increase and
reemployment for 1200 teachers laid off by the district
last spring.
Sun, fun tempt anti-nuke protesters
New York — It was billed as a protest against nuclear
power. By the time it ended, sunny skies, free music and
a controversial issue drew an estimated 200,000 people
yesterday to the tip ot Manhattan for a "No Nukes" rally.
The peaceful day-long gathering was the largest anti
nuclear, pro-solar rally in history and the focus of a day
of similar protests nationwide. There were no arrests or
other incidents here.
"It was mainly for the music that I came, and to re
member Woodstock and the '605," said Princeton stu
dent lanine Verbinski, 20.
"People here will learn about the cause," said )onie
Miller, who came to take a stand against nuc lear energy
and sat in the front row.
Elsewhere, however, protesters blocked the main
gate to the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in Vernon to
disrupt its annual refueling, and police arrested 167 per
sons on charges of unlawful trespass.
The festive crowd on the edge of New York Harbor
heard speeches on the dangers of nuclear power from
political and environmental activists.
"We are here to propose a conversion program from a
nuclear to a non-nuclear society, community by com
munity, state by state, region by region, to an age of
solar energy and renewable resources," said activist
Tom Hayden, who heads the Campaign for Economic
Democracy. His wife, actress lane Fonda, also spoke.

Recession could recruit Kennedy
New York — Sen. Edward Kennedy's suggestion that
he might seek the Democratic nomination if the
economy failed to improve quickly is tantamount to
saying that without a miracle he'll be in the race.
LJnemployment, one of the key measures of public
attitudes, is rising again. The rate of inflation remains
near 13 percent; even if it begins to recede by the end of
the year, as many predict, it might not be soon enough.
Interest rates too are on a similar course. A scattering
of analysts now declare the turn-about may be near, but
even they do not foresee a decline much below
double-digit rates until mid-1980 at the earliest.
fhese indicators — jobs, prices and interest rates —
are among the best understood economic signals,
measuring not abstract monetary or fiscal activities, but
events that immediately affect pocketbooks.
But voters weigh abstractions too. Perhaps not one in

There are clearcut reminders of this everywhere.
There is no sec,ret, for example, behind the price rise in

Candidate claims youth no drawback
Washington — Sen. Larry Pressler concedes that some
might view his campaign for president as premature for a
young man first elected to public office in 1974.
"Some people will look on it as an ego-centered thing,
but we will just have to let the chips fall where they
may," said 36-year-old Pressler a few days before for
mally announcing his candidacy.
But I'ressler said he became a Republican U.S. senator
trom South Dakota by ignoring conventional wisdom
that said he was either too young or unknown to win
election to federal office.
At the moment, he said in an interview before his
planned Tuesday announcement, "I am not perceived as
a serious contender. . . .
"I am not harboring any illusions," he said, "I am a

A boyish-faced man who answers questions cauti
ously, Pressler says his initial support will come from

among young voters in their 20s and 30s who are disen
chanted with conventional politics.
So far, he has picked up six delegates in the Florida
presidential preference convention, where Republicans
will meet Nov. 17 to cast largely symbolic votes for vari

Forest officials initiate reseeding
Massive reseeding operations are underway today in
the fire-ravaged Angeles National Forest as mop-up
crews leave after battling blazes that consumed more
than 50,000 acres in the forest over a 10-day period.
Forest Service officials emphasize that it is a race
against time to accomplish reseeding before the winter
rains come.
The brush fires which raced through Southern
California during this month's near-record heat wave
have consumed 110,000 acres and $400 million worth of
California brush and timber during the 10-day firestorm.
The cost of battling the 27 fires has climbed to $28
million in emergency funds.
The area burnt in the siege set a record, tripling the
total number of acres that were destroyed in 1978. A total
of 469,000 acres were blackened throughout the state
since the fire season began in April.
At least 51 homes were destroyed or damaged in the
last week.
More than 500 of the 7000 firefighters on the line
suffered injuries, most of them minor.
Weary firefighters were sent home Sunday after the
31,500-acre Ventura blaze was officially declared out.

history, slumped considerably.
The price of gold jumped about $10 an ounce in Lon

Today's weather

Syrian, Israeli fighter planes clash
Beirut, Lebanon — Syrian jet fighters and U.S.-made
Israeli F-15s dueled south of Beirut yesterday in the
biggest air battle over lebanon in three months. Four
Soviet-made Syriai , ' l ' were downed, both sides said,
and Syria claimed two Israeli jets were "hit."
The Israelis said all their planes made it safely back to
base.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Thomas
Reston called the air clash a "dangerous development"
and appealed on all sides to exercise restraint.
Syria said its MIG-21s scrambled to intercept the Is
raeli warplanes after the Israelis attacked civilian camps
— presumably Palestinian — in the Damour area 10 miles
south of Beirut. The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv
said its jets, including the F-15, America's most sophisti
cated fighter, were on a reconnaissance mission over
Palestinian guerrilla bases.
The planes headed back west and the dogfight
erupted over the foothills near the airport, the sources
said.
Both 'sides reported four Syrian jets went down.
Lebanese government sources said two crashed in
flames near the airport, and their pilots were seen
parachuting to safety. The other two reportedly went
down farther into the hills. A Syrian military com
munique issued in Damascus said two Israeli jets also
were "hit," but did not say specifically they had crashed.
The Syrians, whose 22,000 troops police a civil-war
armistice in Lebanon, have pledged to defend Lebanese
territory against Israeli air attacks. Israeli jets frequently
fly over Beirut and southern Lebanon on surveillance
missions or to attack Palestinian positions.
State Department spokesman Reston had no com
ment yesterday on whether Israel's use of F-15s over
Lebanon violates U.S. restrictions limiting the aircraft to
self-defense missions. The Israelis say their Lebanon
operations are pre-emptive missions to defend against
Palestinian attack.
Ivory Coast grants Bokassa refuge
Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Deposed emperor )ean Bedel
Bokassa, condemned to death in his Central African
Republic homeland and denied asylum in France, flew
here yesterday and was given refuge by the Ivory Coast's
government.
But his successor, President David Dacko, im
mediately announced he would demand Bokassa's ex
tradition as "a common criminal . . . who killed, raped
and pillaged the state."
Farlier, a radio broadcast from the republic's capital of
Bangui said Dacko had condemned Bokassa to death.
Dacko said that under treaties with the Ivory Coast,
which like his nation is a former French colony, the
extradition "should not pose any problems."
In France, newspapers were severely critical of the
government's actions during the 56 hours Bokassa sat in
his private aircraft at a military base in Evreux, 65 miles
west of Paris, seeking asylum.
Reports from Bangui, where Dacko, with support
from France and other African nations, ousted Bokassa
in a bloodless coup last Thursday, said there was general
bitterness that Bokassa was set free by France.
I he reports also said students and intellectuals who
had led opposition to Bokassa were already complaining
of Dacko's retention of many of the officials who served
under Bokassa.
Bokassa arrived in France on Friday in his personal
Caravelle jet, but was denied permission to disembark.
Yesterday, after the Ivory Coast agreed to give him
asylum, he left his jet, boarded a French Air Force DC-8
and flew to Abidjan with at least six of the 26 persons
who accompanied him to France.
Bokassa, still a French citizen by virtue of service in the
French Army, sought asylum in France, but the govern
ment said he was an "undesirable" and his presence

there was "inopportune." The government's denial of
entry to a French citizen drew the ire of the judiciary.
The ruling Ivory Coast Democratic Party announced
yesterday that in consultation with senior ministers,
army officers, and religious and women's leaders, it had
appealed to President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to grant
Bokassa asylum for "humanitarian reasons."
S.F. teachers to resist court order
San Francisco — A judge yesterday told striking San.
Francisco teachers to get back to work, but union lead
ers said they would defy such an order until they reach a
contract settlement.
A spokesman for the San Francisco Federation of
Teachers Local 61, said the order would be appealed
because "it's very vague and very unclear."
"It doesn't prohibit individual teachers from striking,"
said Julie Koppich, adding that the union attorneys in
terpreted the order as meaning individual teachers
could not-be prosecuted for continuing to stay out of the
classrooms.
Negotiations were set to resume Monday evening.
Acting on a request by a state agency, Superior Court
Judge Robert Merrill ordered the 3600 striking teachers
to stop "calling, engaging in, continuing, sanctioning,

strike. . .

said its jets, including the F-15, America's most sophisti
cated fighter, were on a reconnaissance mission over
Palestinian guerrilla bases.
The planes headed back west and the dogfight
erupted over the foothills near the airport, the sources
said.
Both 'sides reported four Syrian jets went down.
Lebanese government sources said two crashed in
flames near the airport, and their pilots were seen
parachuting to safety. The other two reportedly went
down farther into the hills. A Syrian military com
munique issued in Damascus said two Israeli jets also
were "hit," but did not say specifically they had crashed.
The Syrians, whose 22,000 troops police a civil-war
armistice in Lebanon, have pledged to defend Lebanese
territory against Israeli air attacks. Israeli jets frequently
fly over Beirut and southern Lebanon on surveillance
missions or to attack Palestinian positions.
State Department spokesman Reston had no com
ment yesterday on whether Israel's use of F-15s over
Lebanon violates U.S. restrictions limiting the aircraft to
self-defense missions. The Israelis say their Lebanon
operations are pre-emptive missions to defend against
Palestinian attack.
Ivory Coast grants Bokassa refuge
Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Deposed emperor )ean Bedel
Bokassa, condemned to death in his Central African
Republic homeland and denied asylum in France, flew
here yesterday and was given refuge by the Ivory Coast's
government.
But his successor, President David Dacko, im
mediately announced he would demand Bokassa's ex
tradition as "a common criminal . . . who killed, raped
and pillaged the state."
Farlier, a radio broadcast from the republic's capital of
Bangui said Dacko had condemned Bokassa to death.
Dacko said that under treaties with the Ivory Coast,
which like his nation is a former French colony, the
extradition "should not pose any problems."
In France, newspapers were severely critical of the
government's actions during the 56 hours Bokassa sat in
his private aircraft at a military base in Evreux, 65 miles
west of Paris, seeking asylum.
Reports from Bangui, where Dacko, with support
from France and other African nations, ousted Bokassa
in a bloodless coup last Thursday, said there was general
bitterness that Bokassa was set free by France.
I he reports also said students and intellectuals who
had led opposition to Bokassa were already complaining
of Dacko's retention of many of the officials who served
under Bokassa.
Bokassa arrived in France on Friday in his personal
Caravelle jet, but was denied permission to disembark.
Yesterday, after the Ivory Coast agreed to give him
asylum, he left his jet, boarded a French Air Force DC-8
and flew to Abidjan with at least six of the 26 persons
who accompanied him to France.
Bokassa, still a French citizen by virtue of service in the
French Army, sought asylum in France, but the govern
ment said he was an "undesirable" and his presence

there was "inopportune." The government's denial of
entry to a French citizen drew the ire of the judiciary.
The ruling Ivory Coast Democratic Party announced
yesterday that in consultation with senior ministers,
army officers, and religious and women's leaders, it had
appealed to President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to grant
Bokassa asylum for "humanitarian reasons."
S.F. teachers to resist court order
San Francisco — A judge yesterday told striking San.
Francisco teachers to get back to work, but union lead
ers said they would defy such an order until they reach a
contract settlement.
A spokesman for the San Francisco Federation of
Teachers Local 61, said the order would be appealed
because "it's very vague and very unclear."
"It doesn't prohibit individual teachers from striking,"
said Julie Koppich, adding that the union attorneys in
terpreted the order as meaning individual teachers
could not-be prosecuted for continuing to stay out of the
classrooms.
Negotiations were set to resume Monday evening.
Acting on a request by a state agency, Superior Court
Judge Robert Merrill ordered the 3600 striking teachers
to stop "calling, engaging in, continuing, sanctioning,
inducing, aiding, encouraging, abetting or assisting any
strike. . .
Merrill's order, however, did not ban picketing by
union members as long as they don't do it on school
property or interfere with children attending classes.
Merrill also told the union to advise its membership of
his order. And he ordered the union's leadership to
appear in court Friday to determine if his temporary
order should become permanent.
Earlier, the union rejected a district proposal to rehire
an additional 200 teachers and impose a one-year wage
freeze, saying only a pay hike will end their week-long
strike.
"It's our view that the offer to rehire 923 teachers
comes very close to offering jobs back to all the laid off
teachers who want to come," said Koppich.
But she said the district's proposal for a 6 percent wage
hike next July 1 — leaving the union with no raise in the
first year of a proposed contract — was unacceptable.
The union is seeking a 13 percent wage increase and
reemployment for 1200 teachers laid off by the district
last spring.
Sun, fun tempt anti-nuke protesters
New York — It was billed as a protest against nuclear
power. By the time it ended, sunny skies, free music and
a controversial issue drew an estimated 200,000 people
yesterday to the tip ot Manhattan for a "No Nukes" rally.
The peaceful day-long gathering was the largest anti
nuclear, pro-solar rally in history and the focus of a day
of similar protests nationwide. There were no arrests or
other incidents here.
"It was mainly for the music that I came, and to re
member Woodstock and the '605," said Princeton stu
dent lanine Verbinski, 20.
"People here will learn about the cause," said )onie
Miller, who came to take a stand against nuc lear energy
and sat in the front row.
Elsewhere, however, protesters blocked the main
gate to the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant in Vernon to
disrupt its annual refueling, and police arrested 167 per
sons on charges of unlawful trespass.
The festive crowd on the edge of New York Harbor
heard speeches on the dangers of nuclear power from
political and environmental activists.
"We are here to propose a conversion program from a
nuclear to a non-nuclear society, community by com
munity, state by state, region by region, to an age of
solar energy and renewable resources," said activist
Tom Hayden, who heads the Campaign for Economic
Democracy. His wife, actress lane Fonda, also spoke.

Recession could recruit Kennedy
New York — Sen. Edward Kennedy's suggestion that
he might seek the Democratic nomination if the
economy failed to improve quickly is tantamount to
saying that without a miracle he'll be in the race.
LJnemployment, one of the key measures of public
attitudes, is rising again. The rate of inflation remains
near 13 percent; even if it begins to recede by the end of
the year, as many predict, it might not be soon enough.
Interest rates too are on a similar course. A scattering
of analysts now declare the turn-about may be near, but
even they do not foresee a decline much below
double-digit rates until mid-1980 at the earliest.
fhese indicators — jobs, prices and interest rates —
are among the best understood economic signals,
measuring not abstract monetary or fiscal activities, but
events that immediately affect pocketbooks.
But voters weigh abstractions too. Perhaps not one in
100 understands the technical sophistications of monet
ary policy, but they know the dollar has fallen interna
tionally and that it means weakness.
There are clearcut reminders of this everywhere.
There is no sec,ret, for example, behind the price rise in
various published products from fine prints to old comic
books. They are in limited supply. Dollars, meanwhile,
speed off the printing presses in unlimited quantities.
Studies show that for the first time in the lives ot many
Americans they do not expect the future to be better.
Even during the Great Depression of the 19305, it is
claimed, Americans held to the notion.
Candidate claims youth no drawback
Washington — Sen. Larry Pressler concedes that some
might view his campaign for president as premature for a
young man first elected to public office in 1974.
"Some people will look on it as an ego-centered thing,
but we will just have to let the chips fall where they
may," said 36-year-old Pressler a few days before for
mally announcing his candidacy.
But I'ressler said he became a Republican U.S. senator
trom South Dakota by ignoring conventional wisdom
that said he was either too young or unknown to win
election to federal office.
At the moment, he said in an interview before his
planned Tuesday announcement, "I am not perceived as
a serious contender. . . .
"I am not harboring any illusions," he said, "I am a
realist."
A boyish-faced man who answers questions cauti
ously, Pressler says his initial support will come from

among young voters in their 20s and 30s who are disen
chanted with conventional politics.
So far, he has picked up six delegates in the Florida
presidential preference convention, where Republicans
will meet Nov. 17 to cast largely symbolic votes for vari
ous candidates.
Forest officials initiate reseeding
Massive reseeding operations are underway today in
the fire-ravaged Angeles National Forest as mop-up
crews leave after battling blazes that consumed more
than 50,000 acres in the forest over a 10-day period.
Forest Service officials emphasize that it is a race
against time to accomplish reseeding before the winter
rains come.
The brush fires which raced through Southern
California during this month's near-record heat wave
have consumed 110,000 acres and $400 million worth of
California brush and timber during the 10-day firestorm.
The cost of battling the 27 fires has climbed to $28
million in emergency funds.
The area burnt in the siege set a record, tripling the
total number of acres that were destroyed in 1978. A total
of 469,000 acres were blackened throughout the state
since the fire season began in April.
At least 51 homes were destroyed or damaged in the
last week.
More than 500 of the 7000 firefighters on the line
suffered injuries, most of them minor.
Weary firefighters were sent home Sunday after the
31,500-acre Ventura blaze was officially declared out.
Stocks
New York — The stock market gave up ground yester
day, with analysts blaming the drop on rising gold prices
and a revaluation of the West German mark
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange, which
soared on Friday to 52.38 million shares, fifth largest in
history, slumped considerably.
The price of gold jumped about $10 an ounce in Lon
don and Zurich today to an early price of $378.50 an
ounce. The dollar slipped after a decision by the Euro
pean Monetary System to realign the system's curren
cies.
