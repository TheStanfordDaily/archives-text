# Berkeley housing is no better
## 
### Andrea James 
While students here panic because
they don't have housing, students at
UC-Berkeley are doubling up in
dorm rooms, University of California
school officials said.
"We took the traditional double
rooms and put bunks in them so we
could offer triples," said Ed Hen
dricks, director of housing and food
service at UC-Berkeley.
More than 8,000 applications for
single student housing flooded the
university this fall, and Berkeley has
only 3,000 accommodations on cam

pus, Hendricks said.
Because ot that severe, unex
pected crunch, the University al
tered the dorm rooms to accommo
date three students.
"We decided to do this instead of
forcing students to sleep in common
rooms or study rooms," he
explained.
Stanford, on the other hand, is ac
commodating "homeless" students
in guest rooms scattered throughout
campus and Breer Library, a small
building in the fraternity cluster be
hind Florence Moore dormitory
complex.
"We have no plans to triple-bunk
on a permanent basis," explained
Norm Robinson, associate dean for
residential education. "We want to
preserve the quality of life here."
Students at Berkeley were given
♦air warning about the sudden re
modeling, with all housing applica
tions containing the question,
"Would you be willing to live in a
triple room?" About 42 percent of
the applicants agreed to live in these
conditions, Hendricks said.
Students whose families lived near
Berkeley were not even considered
for on-campus housing.
"We restricted the applications by
zip code," he explained. "Students
whose families lived in the surround
ing areas of Berkeley, like in El Cer
rito or in Berkeley itself, were not
even considered."
Hendricks called this year the

worst year since 1959 for housing
shortages in the Bay Area.
Both Stanford and UC-Berkeley
have the same solution in mind for a
long-term solution to the housing
crunch — new housing complexes
on or near campus. However, Ber
keley will feel the relief two years
sooner than will Stanford, if con
struction projects go according to
plans.
Robinson said the 500-unit dor
mitory complex near Lake Lagunita
will be completed by fall quarter,
1983. The architectural firm which
will prepare the master plan was
hired this summer. Groundbreaking
is scheduled for this spring.
At Berkeley, 110 women's units are
being added on to an existing hall
and work should be completed by
fall of next year, Hendricks said. In
addition, 88 apartments for single
students are scheduled to be com
pleted by early 1980.
About four long blocks away from
campus lies the now-empty Califor
nia School for Deaf and Blind which
the university is hopingtoacquirefor
housing facilities.
"We could put about 700 students
up there, and the university strongly
teels that we have a justifiable need
for the property," Hendricks said.
However, the state is considering
using the building for a senior citi
zens home, he added. Final word on
the building's future should come
within the next few months.
