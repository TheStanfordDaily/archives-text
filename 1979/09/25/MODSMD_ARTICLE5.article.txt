Students expecting the free Mar
guerite bus service to Stanford
Shopping Center may be disap
pointed, but persons who need
transportation to the Southern
Pacific train station may be pleasantly
surprised.
Beginning Sept. 1, the University
discontinued the campus-Stanford
Shopping Center shuttle and opened
a new route to the train depot, lo
cated on the corner of University Av
enue and Alma Street.
"Rising costs, coupled with in
adequate ridership," were the de
termining factors" in Vice President
for Business and Finance William
Massy's decision to cancel the shop
ping center service, said Alan Cum
mings, University administrator re
sponsible for Marguerite operation.
"The costs simply outweighed the
benefits, even in light of the recent
gasoline shortage," Cummings
explained.
Begun in 1976 to alleviate the on
campus parking shortage and traffic
conditions, the Marguerite was vis
ualized as a way to increase patron
age of the shopping center. Unfor
tunately, "it simply has not met ex
pectations," Cummings said. Also
this year shopping'center tenants
were unwilling to pay the increasing
cost of operating the service.
The University experimented with
a trial shuttle to the train station for
one month this August and attracted
more Marguerite-passengers than
before. Therefore, the new loop was
launched primarily to serve commu
ter interests. It will cover Hoover
Pavillion on Quarry Road to the Med
ical Center through the Oval down
Palm Drive to the train station, run
ning between the hours of 7 and 9:30
a.m. and between3:2s and 4:44 p.m.
Thus far, the popularity of that
route has been increasing since it
began, according to Mary Austin,
coordinator for the University bus
fleet.
The conventional Serra-Encina-
Calvez-Campus route will continue
to function throughout the year and
resume full operation following the
completion of Serra Sreet construc
tion in November. The rate has been
stepped up to one every eight mi
nutes rather than the previous 10-
minute frequency to encourage gre
ater use.
A rider survey is scheduled to ap
pear in the Daily later this month to
solicit Marguerite user feedback and
suggestons.
