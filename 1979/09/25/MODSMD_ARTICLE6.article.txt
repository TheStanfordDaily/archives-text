# Women to flood labor force
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Two of every
three American mothers will be hold
ing a job in 1990 as a huge exodus of
women from the home to the work
place continues during the next de
cade, a group of employment ex
perts predicted yesterday.
The role of full-time housewife and
mother is becoming the exception
rather than the rule, according to six
economists and sociologists who
have written a book on working wo
men.
The book, "The Subtle Revolution:
Women at Work, " describes the
sharp increase in female employ
ment as a revolution that is affecting
"virtually all of our social and
economic arrangements."
An estimated 11 million women
will be entering the labor market by
the end of the next decade, and the
majority of them will be mothers, the
authors reported.
As-a result, the percentage of mar
ried women who will be in the labor
force will grow from the current level
of just over half to nearly two-thirds
by 1990, according to the book.
An even higher percentage of mar
ried women with children will be in
the job market in 10 years, the au
thors reported. By 1990, "the
stereotype of a wife as someone who
stays home to look after the children
will fit only about one quarter" of
American wives, said Ralph Smith, an
economist who edited the book.
Currently, a little less than a third
of American wives are full-time
homemakers raising children.
The percentage of women who
work has been growing steadily since
reliable records were first kept in
1890. In that year, only 18 percent of
females over the age of 13 and less
than 5 percent of the married women
were in the labor force.
But the most dramatic exodus of
women into jobs has occurred since
th£ end of World War 11, when the
percentage of working women has
risen from one-third in 1947 to one
half 30 years later, Smith said at a
news conference yesterday.

Women have been streaming into
jobs for a combination of economic
and social reasons, Smith said. They
include a sharply declining birth rate,
increased employment oppor
tunities and higher salaries for wo
men, a family's desire to keep up

with inflation by having two wage
earners and changing social attitudes
about sexual roles.
A principal consequence of the in
crease in working mothers will be the
need for more child-care facilities,
the authors noted.
