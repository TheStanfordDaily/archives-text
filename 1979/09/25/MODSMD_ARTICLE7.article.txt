# Meyer tries cool-off

Although air flow problems in
Meyer Undergraduate Library
(UGLY) have been tackled, the air
conditioning system is still not func
tioning properly, according to
Elizabeth Salzer, head of UGLY.
The $333,000 heating, ventilation
and air conditioning (HVAC) system
installed last year has not been able
to abolish the pockets of hot and
cold airwhich plague the library's in
terior atmosphere, Salzer said.
"There is still work to be done on
the balancing, because the tempera
tures are still uneven. There are parts
of the building that are cooler than
others," she explained.
Although students still complain
about the temperature level, Salzer
said she didn't expect much criticism
of the air quality because the "air
flow is definitely better."
Before the system was installed,
there was also "a very bad problem
with air flow. The air just wouldn't
circulate properly," Salzer said.
The HVAC system was designed to
eliminate both of these problems,
but it has not entirely succeeded,
primarily because of the difficulty of
fitting HVAC into the library's system
design.
"When you make a big change in a
mechanical system of any kind,
balancing is just part of that change,"
according to Philip Leighton, build
ing projects manager. Thus, air
balancing problems were recog
nized from the very beginning of the
installation project, he said.
Meyer's original air conditioning

system was designed to distribute air
throughout the building originating
from a source in the ceiling. The air
descended through small ceiling
slots and supposedly returned to a
register near the stairs at each floor,
according to Leighton.
"Unfortunately unforseeable
complications marred the effective
ness of that device. "The problem
was there wasn't enough air move
ment to reach the floor," Leighton
said. "Becatise of this lack of air
movement (the library) felt stuffy and
uncomfortable."
Under the HVAC construction, a
more standard duct system was in
stalled to improve the air flow.
HVAC implementation did, how
ever, pose a different problem.
While the old air conditioning sys
tem -possessed its own cooling
source, the HVAC system is con
nected to the central chilled water
cooling system, where the pumps
originally designed for the old sys
tem are apparently too big, Leighton
said. The cooling water, therefore,
travels through the system so quickly
that ample time does not exist for
even heat transferral.
Solutions to this complication are
now under consideration. "The cur
rent plan is to shave the impeller of
the pumps so that it doesn't move as
much water," Leighton said. That ac
tion should be taken within the next
month.
In the meantime, Salzer's advice to
students bothered by the tempera
ture is to simply move to another
area of tKe library.
