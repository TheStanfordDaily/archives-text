# Bechtel I-Center helps with grad foreign scholarships
## 
### Carlos Vidal Greth 
You've completed, or will soon com
plete, your undergraduate studies, and
though you know this eucalyptus-lined
campus is without peer, perhaps you
seek a foreign complement to your
studies in the United States.
If you're considering graduate study
or research in another country, four fi
nancial awards administered through
the Overseas Resource Center in
Bechtel International Center may help
you achieve your ambitions abroad.
Information on the Rhodes, Marshall
and Churchill Scholarships will be pro
vided this Wednesday, Sept. 26, at 7:30
p.m. in the l-Center. Applicants for the
Fulbright-Hays Grants should attend
there the same time Thursday.
The awards all require a bachelor's
degree by the beginning date of the
grants and U.S. citizenship. Both men
and women are eligible — the Rhodes
Trust made grants available to women
in 1976.
"There are several advantages in
studying abroad," said Marcia Makino,
fellowship advisor. "It enables the
scholar to get another perspective on
his or her subject. For example, French
historians have a different view of
World War II than American ones do."
Reasons
According to Lee Zeigler, l-Center di
rector, there are as many reasons for
applying as there are applicants.
"Some people apply because they
want to live in another environment for

a time," he said. "Many seek an en
larged study experience. One music
student applied so she could study
under an accomplished Parisian con
ductor."
Students here have done well com
peting for these scholarships. Makino
said four Marshalls, one Rhodes and
one Churchill scholarship were
awarded in 1977 to graduate students
here. In 1978, 10 Fulbright grants were
distributed at the University.

education program on the part of all

English-speaking people.
The lesser known but nevertheless
prestigious Marshall Scholarship pro

awards began soon after World War II
as part of the Marshall Plan to help re
construct war-ravaged Europe.
There are over 500 FulDnght-Hays
Grants available for one year of pre
doctoral study or research, teaching as
sistantships in English and travel grants.
In addition, the scholarship pays tui

and language or orientation courses.
Deadlines
"The largest number of Fulbright re
cipients go to Germany. This year Fr

popular," said Zeigler.
Makino urged interested students to
act immediately, as campus deadlines
for these scholarships are near. The
Rhodes and Marshall applications are
due no later than Oct. 4. The Fulbright
deadline is Oct. 12, and for the Chur
