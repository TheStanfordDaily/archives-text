that has an espresso bar...
( \ What s so nice about the espresso bar at Wild
w- Strawberries is that you'll find an international touch

It s the ideal place to converse with a friend over
coffee or wine or a Perrier. Or, if you prefer, to just
quietly read and pamper yourself with some
savory Wild Strawberries speciality.
And, it's a wonderful place to experiment
with a marvelous variety of espressos. Like
our Cappuccino, our Mochaccino, or our
