# NLRB to register complaint in Coffee House controversy
## 
### Simon Labov 
The regional office of the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will re
gister a complaint against the
operators of the Coffee House for
the July 27 tiring of 39 employees.
The board contends "the
employees were unlawfully termi
nated because of union activities,"
said Alan Berkowitz, the board's reg
ional director. It also claims the
operators, Guckenheimer Enter
prises, decided not to rehire them
because they picketed and tried to
form a union, he added. The com
plaint will be filed with the adminis
trative law division of the NIRB.
TDS Inc., Guckenheimer's parent
company, will be given some time to
settle the problem out of court.
Companies are generally allowed up
to a month to begin to work some
thing out, Berkowitz said. If after a
certain length of time no out-of
court settlement is reached, the
board will proceed with the com
plaint.
The tired workers filed the charges
with the board. It investigated the
allegations and registered the com
plaint.
If no settlement is reached, an ad
ministrative judge will hold a hearing
and decide the case, Berkowitz said.
He added that Guckenheimer will be
able to appeal the verdict to the
board's national office in
Washington.
Guckenheimer President Stewart
Rite hie said the charges are "without
merit." But he would like to "see if
there is any possible way to settle
(out of court)" and will "try to put it
all behind us," he said.
Chip Zemple, one of the fired
workers, said he thinks it is possible

to settle out of court. He also em
phasized his desire to work matters
out soon. "I don't like being on a
picket line," he said. "I'd rather be
making sandwiches for people."
Guckenheimer began negotiating
with the dismissed workers this
summer but the company called the
talks off after the second meeting,
Zemple said.
Labor lawyers advised Ritchie
"that such a meeting could be con
strued as recognizing them (the tired
»vorkers) as a bargaining unit," ac
cording to Tresidder Union Director
Dan Williams, who attended the
meetings.
Zemple said the most the workers
can hope tor is to be reinstated and
to receive back pay for the time they
were on strike. The group agreed the
settlement must be for "all or none'

of the fired employees, Zemple ad
ded.
Zemple said he hopes the workers
and Guckenheimer can negotiate to
solve some of the disagreements
about the operation of the Coffee
House.
The University is also looking tor
ward to a settlement, said John
S< h-.vartz, University counsel. "As a
legal matter, the University is not in
volved," but Schwartz added the
University is "certainly concerned
about it.
The "True Coffee House," which
dismissed workers have been operat
ing outside the Old Union
Clubhouse, was closed yesterday
because they were missing an exten
sion cord. The stand will be open
again tomorrow, one of the workers
said.


The Band continued its tradition of attending the first game
of the football season for the eighth year when it traveled to
Tulane, La. earlier this month. In order to go to the Boston
