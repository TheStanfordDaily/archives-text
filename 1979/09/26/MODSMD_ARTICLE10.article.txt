# Defector charges Soviets spying

London (AP) â€” At least halt the JOO Soviets
employed by the United Nations are spies and
one is a special assistant to Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim, said former Soviet U.N. official
Arkady Shevchenko, who defected last year.
"There is a saying that they consider the U.N.
the tallest observation tower in the Western
world for intelligence activity," said Shev
chenko, who left his post as under-secretary
general for political and security affairs in April
1978 for U.S. asylum.
A special assistant to Waldheim is an officer of
the KGB, the Soviet secret police, Shevchenko
said Monday on the British Broadcasting Corp.
morning television show "Panorama."
BBC said it could identify only one Soviet spe
cial assistant to Waldheim, Victor Lessiovski. He

was not available for comment at U.N. head
quarters in New York.
"They consider it as the best place for the
propaganda, and later discover that it's one of
the best places for their intelligence activities,
and actually the U.N. has become one of the
most important bases for the KGB orGRU," he
added. GRU is Soviet Military Intelligence.
Some 300 Soviet citizens work as U.N. profes
sionals and interpreters, said Shevchenko. The
organization has 10,595 employees.
"I would guess that at a minimum, half are
KGB or GRU officers," he said.
Shevchenko said that Soviet agents disregard
the oath of allegiance the United Nations re
quires of its professionals, and that they report
regularly to Soviet missions.
