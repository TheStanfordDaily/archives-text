### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” San
Francisco's cable cars will
be shut down indefinitely to
permit a massive safety
overhaul of the system, city
utility officials decided yes
terday.
Three lines, one on
California Street and two on
Mason and Hyde streets,
will be affected by the clo
sure, transit officials said.
Robert Rockwell, a
spokesman for the Munici
pal Railway, said the closure
was ordered by city utility
commissioners after an en
gineering report recom
mended a major revamp of
the system.
"The whole system is an
tiquated. It's really nothing
specific. We've been patch
ing and patching and patch
ing and it won't patch any
more," said Gilbert Repp, a
Muni inspector.

One city official said the
repairs could cost as much
as $40 million. "We feel ter
rible about it but it's got to
be done," the official said.
City officials said the
California Street line may be
shut down for only two to
three weeks, but both the
Mason and Hyde lines could
be closed for eight or nine
months.
Rockwell said approxi
mately 28,000 riders use the
century-old system daily. A
shuttle bus system will
begin running tomorrow to
assist cable car commuters.
"The dramatic effect of
the cable car shutdown will
be on the number of visitors
who come to San Francisco
each year," said Rockwell.
"Its a very visible transit sys
tem and I'm sure many vis
itors will be very disap
pointed."
