# No time for anesthesia
## Speedy surgery saves patient

Charlotte, N.C. (AP) —
Operating in such urgency
they had no time for anesthe
tics, Charlotte Memorial Hos
pital doctors cut into the chest
of bartender Randy Cook to
save his life after an assailant
plunged a knife into his heart.
One of the doctors halted
the flow of blood from the
heart by holding his finger in
the hole made by the knife
until stitches could be made.
The work moved so quickly
that Cook, whom doctors say
has a good chance of returning
to normal, was still wearing his
pants and boots when the op
eration was over 90 minutes la
ter.
It was around 2:30 a.m. Sun
day. Cook was injured so badly
that he was rushed directly
from the ambulance to the
operating room.
Glaser made the
cut, felt around the rapidly
beating heart until he found
the hole in the heart wall, and
then held his finger there,
stopping the bleeding.
With the bleeding stopped,
Glaser, Dr. Michael Thomason
and the other members of the
operating room team began to
do the things that normally
would have been done first —
give Cook blood, stabilize his

blood pressure, and, finally,
give him an anesthetic.
Then the 34-year-old Glaser,
just days away from finishing
his thoracic surgery residency,
used two big stitches to close
the half-inch hole in the 25-
year-old bartender's heart.
"The hole was very hard to
find," said Thomason. "Once
we got in, we had 15-20 sec
onds to find the hole."
Both doctors said Cook
would have died if everything
hadn't clicked — from the time
he was picked up by MEDIC at
a downtown Charlotte restaur
ant where he was stabbed
while trying to stop a knife
wielding patron, to the time
when surgery was complete.
"He would have died before
he got to the hospital without
what the medics did," Glaser
said.
Cook was in satisfactory
condition Monday, and said he
remembers only snatches of
the hospital drama.
"I remember rushing down
the hall, and I remember feel
ing that first cut," said Cook.
Glaser says Cook jumped
when the incision was made.
After the cut, Glaser stopped
up the hole, which was in the
right ventricle, and a few mi
nutes later sewed up the
wound.
"What Dr. Glaser did was

just amazing," said Thomason.
"He sewed up something that
was beating that fast. I was im
pressed."
Glaser said the whole inci
dent hit him afterward.
"I had to go over and sit
down," he said. "That's when
it hits you — when it's over."
In fact, the hospital moved
so fast nobody stopped to find
out who the seriously injured
man was. The wrist band Cook
had on Monday called him,
"Mr. X."
