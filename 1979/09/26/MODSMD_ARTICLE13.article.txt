# Crisis may reunite Beatles
## 
### 
United Nations (AP) — The
suffering of the "boat people"
might do what pleading fans
and show business promoters
have failed to achieve in nearly
10 years: bring the Beatles back
together.
A U.N. spokesman con
firmed Friday that the four
members of the Fabulous Four,
who have not all played to
gether in 10 years, are being
urged to play a benefit for the
refugees of southeast Asia and
elsewhere. U.N. Secretary-
General Kurt Waldheim would
sponsor the event.
Dirk Summers, an indepen
dent Los Angeles concert pro
ducer who reportedly was
handling negotiations, told
Garden City, N.Y., radio sta
tion WLIR, that three of the
four Beatles — Paul
McCartney, George Harrison
and Ringo Starr — had agreed
to perform together on the
same stage in Geneva, Switzer
land.
Summers said a four-hour
concert was planned, and

would include rock star Elton
John as master of ceremonies,
with Leonard Bernstein con
ducting the Vienna Philhar
monic in an interpretation of
Beatle tunes.
Summers said in the inter
view that the other Beatle, John
Lennon, had not yet re-

All of the Beatles have shown interest in
the project and are considering it.

sponded to his concert prop
osal.
U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani said Waldheim spoke
personally with Harrison, ad
ding that all of the Beatles had
shown interest in the project
and were considering it. Harri
son organized and performed
in a 1971 concert in New York
to raise money for famine
struck Bangladesh.
Giuliani said U.N. officials
were not informed on the
status of negotiations being
handled by Summers but the
Washington Post reported last
week that the three have ag
reed to the idea.
A spokesman in the office of
New York lawyer John
Eastman, said however, Paul
McCartnt / would not agree to
perform in such a concert.
Eastman is McCartney's
brother-in-law.
The New York Post said last
week that Lennon had agreed
only to working on the same
bill as his three former
partners, but not to perform
ing with them.
Giuliani said the success of
last January's rock and disco
benefit by the Bee Gees and
other performers — which

raised nearly $4 million for the
U.N. Childrens Fund, UNICEF
— had encouraged Waldheim
to endorse the Beatles idea.
That concert, held in the
U.N. General Assembly hall in
New York, provided income
from television and from rights
to music performed.

Giuliani was unable to say
whether the Beatles project
originated with the United Na
tions or with show business
promoters. "Ever since last
year's concert we have had
many contacts with show busi
ness," he said. "Just where and
how the Beatles project started
I could not say."
