Washington (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter's brother Billy
has taken preliminary steps to
register with the Justice De
partment as a foreign agent,
presumably in behalf of the
Arab nation of Libya.
A justice Department offi
cial, who asked not to be iden
tified, said Billy requested
forms in August to apply for the
status of a foreign agent just
before he left on a trip to Libya.
The president's younger
brother was in Libya to take
part in the celebration of the
10th anniversary of the Libyan
revolution and after that went

to Kuwait. It is not clear when
he is expected to return to this
country.
Billy Carter could not be
reached for comment and a
lawyer who has represented
him in various matters, John
Parks of Americus, Ga., de
clined to discuss the matter.
Billy Carter has had various
dealings with Libyan officials
and businessmen, prompting a
Justice Department investiga
tion last January todetermine if
he violated the foreign agents
registration act. Officials said
that investigation still is consi
dered open.
