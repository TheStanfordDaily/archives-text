# Fuel costs drive up prices
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Carter administra
tion's hopes of holding the annual rate of infla
tion below a double-digit level dimmed in Au
gust as consumer prices were driven up once
more by surging fuel costs.
The Labor Department said consumer prices
rose 1.1 percent last month, the eighth consecu
tive month with an increase near or above 1
percent.
If prices in September, October, November
and December continue to rise at the same rate
as they have since last December, the year will
end with a post-World War II record inflation
rate of 13.1 percent, said Labor Department
economist Patrick Jackman.
This would top the 12.2 percent record price
rise, which was established from December
1973 to December 1974.

Although food prices showed no change last
month, the costs of other items were driven up
substantially by rapidly rising gasoline and fuel
oil costs and higher interest rates.
The White House press office blamed OPEC
for the inflation problem.
"The need to reduce our dependence on
foreign oil is driven home each time the CPI
(Consumer Price Index) comes out," the White
House said in a statement.
The statement said that if it were not for
rapidly rising prices for energy, food and hous
ing, the index would have risen at "a much
lower — though still too high — annual rate of
8.5 percent."
The August inflation rate underscores the im
portance of President Carter's energy *»nd anti
inflation programs, it said.
