## Immigrant health problem neglected 
### 
During the past few years
we've experienced a tremend
ous influx of Third World im
migrants into the United
States, an influx that many of
us have welcomed in spite of
widespread opposition. In par
ticular, America's response
(delayed as it was) to the Viet
namese refugees has been
heartening.
Of course, this influx (esti
mated in the millions) has
brought with it many difficul
ties that are documented and
discussed often enough. One
difficulty, however, has re
ceived limited attention in the
press — the decline of public
health standards resulting
from both legal and illegal im
migration.
When Third Worlders come
to the United States they often
bring with them their Third
World health problems, in
cluding tuberculosis, dysen
tery, malaria, typhoid, sal
monella, and leprosy. Though
effective screening of legal
immigrants is supposed to
exist, statistics show other
wise. And illegal aliens, primar
ily from Mexico, bring in their
communicable diseases un
checked.

This is beginning to create
what could be a serious health
problem for California, espe
cially in Los Angeles, Orange,
and San Diego counties where
many of these immigrants are
concentrated. Among many
examples, tuberculosis in
Southern California is increas
ing significantly at a time when
TB rates in other parts of the
country are declining (the inci
dence of TB arpong screened
Indochinese refugees in
Orange County is 13 times
higher than the indigenous
population), while shigellosis,
a serious parasitic disorder,
has spread to near-epidemic
levels in East Los Angeles.
Malaria cases in California have
also increased tremendously
during the past three years,
with the majority of cases in
volving recent immigrants. Fi
nally, leprosy and typhoid rates
have increased tenfold in Los
Angeles since 1%4.
Unfortunately, this increase
in communicable disease
comes at a time when local
public health programs are
being drastically cut back or
badly overextended. And the
federal government (except in
the case of the Indo-

Chinese refugees) has been
reluctant to aid city and county
health programs. The Depart
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare refuses to address the
health problems created by
undocumented aliens, holding
that it can only be responsible
for legal immigrants. This posi
tion is now coming under in
creasing fire in Washington,
with local health officials argu
ing that any and all immigrants
— legal or not — must be edu
cated in 20th century health
standards.
I feel that three steps must
be taken to help control this
immigrant health problem:
first, screening procedures for
legal immigrants must be im
proved; second, the federal
government must yield to
common sense and recognize
that illegal aliens need to be

treated as real, existing per
sons whose health problems
atfect both themselves and
others; and third, the federal
•government must assist embat
tled local public health agen
cies to cope with the difficult
and expensive job of educating
both legal and illegal immig
rants about modern health
standards. If these steps are
not taken California may face
serious and expensive health
difficulties in the near future,
with certain counties and cities
bearing the financial burden of
federal immigration policies.
As a nation we need to en
sure the health of our legal citi
zens, and as a people we need
to awake to the health needs of
all those who have taken up re
sidence here.
