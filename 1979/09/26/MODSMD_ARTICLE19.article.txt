Coffee House blues
Incoming students may not
know of the political afflictions
of the Coffee House. Thirty or
so workers were sacked with
out notice just when they were
planning to organize. Negotia
tions were refused, then
started on condition of remov
ing pickets which had heen
highly effective. The talks were
immediately broken off, prob
ably in full knowledge of the
legal technicality that pre
vented the resumption of pic
keting for a considerable time.
It left a pretty bad taste. That
taste remains — in the form of
junk music.
Whether this choice is de
signed to desensitize or accel
erate the digestive process, or
to stretch an already "taut"
aesthetic spectrum, (lie lack of
variety or silence makes the
place uninhabitable for any
length of time.
What effective action can be
taken?
—Management: reinstate
workers, jettison your conven
tional "majority appeal" at
titude.
— Students: boycott the
Coffee House and the Transi
tion (not Marcel's or The
Store).
— Administration: well
now...could we have a public
statement of attitude, intent,
preferably without ambiguous
or procrastinatory tendencies?
Late, but still welcome.
The University owes its stu
dents, employees and the
workers it "houses" real sup
port in such issues.

Presumably "catering to a
majority" in campus context
can mean more than undiluted
money-spinning methods. We
know what to expect of Guc
kenheimer; can we be sure the
University is aiming higher?
