# USE makes demands for resignation
## 
### Bill Burger Senior Staff Writer 
A group of irate United Stanford
Employees (USE) members last night
demanded the resignation of union
General Manager and chief
negotiator David Novogrodsky,
charging him with weak leadership
and misrepresentation of the agree
ment between the union and the
University that has since been
ratified and signed.
About f)0 USE members attended
the special membership meeting,
announced as an informational hear
ing to discuss the new three-year ag
reement.
Instead, dissatisfied union mem
bers called the negotiations and con
tract a "sham" and a "fraud." Novog
rodsky was charged with "jealously
guarding" his power within the
union and being too concerned with
his personal future as a labor or
ganizer at the expense of the USE
membership.
In addition, members criticized
Novogrodsky's "hard selling" of the
agreement to the membership be
fore the Sept. 18 ratification vote.
They also said incorrect information
was given, particularly concerning
the pension plan improvements.
Teressa Ghilarducci, an economist
who worked with USE in the negotia
tions, said last night she had made a
pretty gross" mistake in hercompu
tations of the benefit increase in the
new pension plan. She said the mis
take was unintentional and said a
leaflet correcting the misinformation
was distributed shortly afterward.
She said the misinformation didn't
change the fact that the new pension
plan was "outstanding."
Novogrodsky said after the meet
ing that many of the persons who
attended were "more interested in
making noise than in accomplishing
anything."
He called the new contract a "fair
package," but said he agreed with
many of the complaints about the ag
reement. He also said the ratification
meeting was conducted poorly.
"USE has done things in a pretty
messy way" in the past, Novog
rodsky said. "I think that's what the
members want."
He called their distrust of leader
ship "healthy" and said he expected
the movement to replace him as
union general manager to continue.
Union member Paul Stuart said he
suspected a ratification vote held
now on the new agreement would
"swing the other way." He said the
move to oust Novogrodsky would
continue.
Another union member, Linda
Crouse, said many persons are "dis
appointed" with the new contract.
"We feel there was leadership
which did not live up to the member
ship," she said.
Novogrodsky said he had no plans
at present to resign or leave USE.
