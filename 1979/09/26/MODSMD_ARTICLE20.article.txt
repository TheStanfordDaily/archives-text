## U.S. must check capitalism 
### 
For over 200 years, the American economic
system has been based on capitalism. In theory,
the system is designed to stimulate productivity
by encouraging competition. Individual ad
vancement is achieved by monetary reward. A
higher level of education generally insures a
better-paying, more interesting occupation.
Money earned through employment is sub
sequently used for the purchase of commodities
deemed desirable by the consumer,
creating demand which requires increased pro
ductivity.
In view of our current national problems of
inflation, unemployment, and lack of public
confidence in government, this ideal obviously
has not been met in recent years. We are witnes
sing the backfire of the American dream in the
form of deteriorating personal values and mean
ingless lifetime goals. Those precious qualities
which should be important in life have seem
ingly taken a back seat to our present over
emphasis on money. Rather than progress with
our increasing technological knowledge, we are
allowing the economic quagmire to impede at
tainment of a better lifestyle for all Americans.
Take, for example, the Bay Area transporta
tion situation during the last Labor Day
weekend. With BART workers on strike over
salary difficulties, many commuters were
stranded or forced to drive, in the face of a
known gasoline shortage. Meanwhile, as pump
prices climbed into triple figures, station own
ers threatened to refuse sales because of an
inadequate profit margin. Taken together, the
situation was frustrating for many hard-working
citizens who deserved and anticipated travel
during the holiday period. Because of an appa
rent unwillingness to get together and solve
what are clearly mutual problems, the popula
tion as a whole was forced to suffer.
Re-evaluate priorities
Numerous other examples may be found in
many aspects of American life. Consider the
needy child who goes without adequate health
care because his parents cannot afford it, or the
public schools without extracurricular activities
or adequate teaching due to such measures as
Proposition 13, or the many elderly citizens who
live in poverty due to inadequate pensions and
inability to afford nursing home care. Countless
worthwhile things which could and should be
accomplished in this country remain undone be
cause supposedly "the money is not available."
Obviously, we need to critically re-evaluate our
social priorities.
Our definition of success in life has degener
ated to that of financial gain and materialistic

wealth. Consider the average "successful"
American businessman. While certainly weal
thy, has he really succeeded? He is likely to be
overweight, out of shape, suffering from ulcers
and insomnia, a chronic smoker and/or drinker,
and on his second deteriorating marriage, with
children in trouble. Success can be defined only
as the achievement of individual happiness, a
quality which is completely independent of
economic status.
Detrimental influence
In the education of our'children, too, over
emphasis on the capitalist philosophy exerts its
detrimental influence. The child who competes
successfully against his peers, whether academ
ically or athletically, receives recognition from
parents, teachers and community. However,
awards and praise are seldom given to the child
who exhibits such admirable qualities as hon
esty, goodwill towards others, and a spirit of
unselfishness. The current absence of these
qualities among our adult population is causing
the fragmentation of American society and vir
tually non-existent nationalistic pride.
By its very nature, the capitalist system under
which we live is designed to produce "winners"
and "losers." It is unfortunate that the latter are
in the majority, and that the system affords few
provisions for those who work equally hard but
end up on the short end of the stick. For exam
ple, even the best worker in today's society is
not immune to layoffs, and countless coll.ege
graduates currently hold menial jobs simply be
cause their fields are oversaturated.
Finally, one certain aspect of our present
economy which is slowly pulling it into oblivion
is the concept of credit. The American is a un
ique individual in his ability to purchase virtually
any item without paying for it, thanks to charge
cards and time-payment plans. Perhaps whefi
we are forced to abandon our "live for today"
attitude and begin to base today's actions on
tomorrow's consequences, a more stable, less
chaotic economy will exist in the United States.
The final message here is not to abandon
capitalism in favor of some alternative economic
system, for it has certainly played a major posi
tive role in past American progress. Rather, we
as a society need to control it instead of letting it
control us. Realization of the American dream
means improving the lifestyle of every citizen, as
well as social interactions between citizens; the
corruption, greed, envy, and despair which are
presently omnipresent are clearly not in keep
ing with this goal.

corruption, greed, envy, and despair which are
presently omnipresent are clearly not in keep
ing with this goal.
(David Sartoris is a fourth year medical student.)
For over 200 years, the American economic
system has been based on capitalism. In theory,
the system is designed to stimulate productivity
by encouraging competition. Individual ad
vancement is achieved by monetary reward. A
higher level of education generally insures a
better-paying, more interesting occupation.
Money earned through employment is sub
sequently used for the purchase of commodities
deemed desirable by the consumer,
creating demand which requires increased pro
ductivity.
In view of our current national problems of
inflation, unemployment, and lack of public
confidence in government, this ideal obviously
has not been met in recent years. We are witnes
sing the backfire of the American dream in the
form of deteriorating personal values and mean
ingless lifetime goals. Those precious qualities
which should be important in life have seem
ingly taken a back seat to our present over
emphasis on money. Rather than progress with
our increasing technological knowledge, we are
allowing the economic quagmire to impede at
tainment of a better lifestyle for all Americans.
Take, for example, the Bay Area transporta
tion situation during the last Labor Day
weekend. With BART workers on strike over
salary difficulties, many commuters were
stranded or forced to drive, in the face of a
known gasoline shortage. Meanwhile, as pump
prices climbed into triple figures, station own
ers threatened to refuse sales because of an
inadequate profit margin. Taken together, the
situation was frustrating for many hard-working
citizens who deserved and anticipated travel
during the holiday period. Because of an appa
rent unwillingness to get together and solve
what are clearly mutual problems, the popula
tion as a whole was forced to suffer.
Re-evaluate priorities
Numerous other examples may be found in
many aspects of American life. Consider the
needy child who goes without adequate health
care because his parents cannot afford it, or the
public schools without extracurricular activities
or adequate teaching due to such measures as
Proposition 13, or the many elderly citizens who
live in poverty due to inadequate pensions and
inability to afford nursing home care. Countless
worthwhile things which could and should be
accomplished in this country remain undone be
cause supposedly "the money is not available."
Obviously, we need to critically re-evaluate our
social priorities.
Our definition of success in life has degener
ated to that of financial gain and materialistic

wealth. Consider the average "successful"
American businessman. While certainly weal
thy, has he really succeeded? He is likely to be
overweight, out of shape, suffering from ulcers
and insomnia, a chronic smoker and/or drinker,
and on his second deteriorating marriage, with
children in trouble. Success can be defined only
as the achievement of individual happiness, a
quality which is completely independent of
economic status.
Detrimental influence
In the education of our'children, too, over
emphasis on the capitalist philosophy exerts its
detrimental influence. The child who competes
successfully against his peers, whether academ
ically or athletically, receives recognition from
parents, teachers and community. However,
awards and praise are seldom given to the child
who exhibits such admirable qualities as hon
esty, goodwill towards others, and a spirit of
unselfishness. The current absence of these
qualities among our adult population is causing
the fragmentation of American society and vir
tually non-existent nationalistic pride.
By its very nature, the capitalist system under
which we live is designed to produce "winners"
and "losers." It is unfortunate that the latter are
in the majority, and that the system affords few
provisions for those who work equally hard but
end up on the short end of the stick. For exam
ple, even the best worker in today's society is
not immune to layoffs, and countless coll.ege
graduates currently hold menial jobs simply be
cause their fields are oversaturated.
Finally, one certain aspect of our present
economy which is slowly pulling it into oblivion
is the concept of credit. The American is a un
ique individual in his ability to purchase virtually
any item without paying for it, thanks to charge
cards and time-payment plans. Perhaps whefi
we are forced to abandon our "live for today"
attitude and begin to base today's actions on
tomorrow's consequences, a more stable, less
chaotic economy will exist in the United States.
The final message here is not to abandon
capitalism in favor of some alternative economic
system, for it has certainly played a major posi
tive role in past American progress. Rather, we
as a society need to control it instead of letting it
control us. Realization of the American dream
means improving the lifestyle of every citizen, as
well as social interactions between citizens; the
corruption, greed, envy, and despair which are
presently omnipresent are clearly not in keep
ing with this goal.
