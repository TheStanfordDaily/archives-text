# Other side of the coin may be plastic money

Washington (AP) — The dollar bill could
become a thing of the past and tomorrow's
money might be made of plastic if Congress
follows the recommendations released yes
terday by a Carter administration task forca
on money. *•
The task force suggested that the govern
ment begin replacing the paper dollar with
the new Susan B. Anthony dollar coin and,
later, with $2 dollar bills.
It also suggested that Congress consider
eliminating the half-dollar coin, making pen
nies out of aluminum alloy if copper prices
rise too high and urged a study of using plas
tic in future currency.
Possible elimination of the dollar bill was
immediately attacked by Rep. Frank Annun
zio (D-lll.) chairman of the House Banking
subcommittee on consumer affairs.
Annunzio told a hearing that he would "do
everything within my power to keep the dol
lar bill in circulation.
Suspenders
"If we do eliminate the dollar bill and, in
stead, use the dollar coin, then the Treasury
Department should be required to issue
every American a pair of suspenders," he
concluded.
Congressional sources, who asked that
their names not be used, said Congress
probably would move very slowly to alter the
nation's currency because of apparent public
rejection of two recent hard-fought changes:
introduction of the Anthony dollar earlier

this year, and the 1975 re-introduction of the
$2 bill.
The task-force report — prepared by offi
cials from the Treasury Department, the
Mint, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
and the Federal Reserve — is the latest in a
series of recommendations that have been
prepared on the nation's coin and currency
system.
Production lost
Most are aimed at lowering the govern
ment's cost of producing money, which will
total nearly $35 million for coins this year and
$72 million for paper money.
The report gives no hint of the cost of its
recommended changes nor a time-table for
their adoption.
"The recommendations have not been
adopted or endorsed by the Treasury but are
being sent to Congress and made public as
part of the review process before final deci
sions are made," the Treasury Department
said in a statement.
It added that "the proposed changes are
for economy and to aid law enforcement
rather than to correct any serious deficien
cies in the systems."
The recommendations come at a time the
government has encountered public resis
tance to the Anthony dollar.
Many people have complained that they
confuse the new coin with quarters and
major retailers have reported little demand
for the new dollar.
