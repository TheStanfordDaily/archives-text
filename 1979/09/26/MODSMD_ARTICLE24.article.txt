# Congress deadlocked over budget
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Like a
family arguing over whether to
buy a new car, and which one,
Congress is locked in an in
creasingly bitter debate over
how much the country can af
ford to spend and what it
should be spent on.
But as the House and Senate
resume debate on the budget
today, they'll be talking not in
terms of $100 or $200 — but
about a budget of more than
$500 billion and even differ
ences in the billions of dollars.
And for the first time in the
five-year history of the new
congressional budget process,
it appears unlikely they'll re
solve their differences before
the new fiscal year starts Mon
day.
The deadlock is not ex
pected to affect the day-to-day
operation of government since
Congress can still appropriate
money, but it could generate
other fall-outs, including a
further weakening of public
confidence in Congress.
The Senate, looking forward
to this fall's SALT II debate,
favors sharply higher defense
spending than the proposed
House budget. The Senate is
also calling for $3.6 billion in
cuts in social programs that the

House has thus far rejected.
House and Senate leaders
agree there is little chance a
compromise can be reached
on the 1980 budget by the end
of this week when the House is
slated to leave for a week-long
recess.
Some leaders even say the
only real budget deadline is
final congressional adjourn
ment for the year, expected in
December.
And while day-to-day gov
ernment will go on, a long
term deadlock on the budget
seems certain to undermine al
ready shaky public confidence
in congressional budget
making and buttress the
charge that the government
cannot live within a ♦ <ght
budget.
Rep. Robert N. Giaimo (D-
Conn.), the chairman of the
House Budget Committee,
said almost as much last week
when he declared that failure
to reach agreement "would be
admitting to the American
people that Congress is very
good at appropriating money
but that Congress can't live
with budget discipline."
Giaimo added that such a
deadlock would strengthen ef
forts to place mandatory re

strictions on government
spending. Many states are al
ready calling for a constitu
tional amendment to require a
balanced federal budget.
The new budget process was
inaugurated five years ago to
give Congress a better handle
on spending by creating a sys
tem for establishing priorities
within an overall budget ceil
ing. ■
By and large, the new pro
cess has worked well and is
widely regarded as one of the
most important congressional
reforms in recent years.
The House, with its heavier
urban representation, has tried
to protect funding for social
programs while the Senate,
worried about the military ba
lance with the Soviet Union,
has pressed for increased de

fense spending.
That conflict, fought on a
battlefield of growing public
resistance to government
spending, was bound to be dif
ficult and now appears to be
slipping into deadlock.
President jimmy Carter and
many House and Senate lead
ers have called for a 1980
budget deficit below this year's
expected figure of $30 billion.
They say a reduction is neces
sary to show the American
people that Congress is mov
ing toward a balanced budget
However, defense spending
has become a politically explo
sive issue in the Senate, where
some senators vow to oppose
the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms
limitation treaty — SALT — un
less the military budget is sub
stantially increased.

worried about the military ba
lance with the Soviet Union,
has pressed for increased de

fense spending.
That conflict, fought on a
battlefield of growing public
resistance to government
spending, was bound to be dif
ficult and now appears to be
slipping into deadlock.
President jimmy Carter and
many House and Senate lead
ers have called for a 1980
budget deficit below this year's
expected figure of $30 billion.
They say a reduction is neces
sary to show the American
people that Congress is mov
ing toward a balanced budget
However, defense spending
has become a politically explo
sive issue in the Senate, where
some senators vow to oppose
the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms
limitation treaty — SALT — un
less the military budget is sub
stantially increased.
