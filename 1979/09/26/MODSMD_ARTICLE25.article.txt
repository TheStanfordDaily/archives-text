## Ruling halts Democratic machine 
### 
Chicago (AP) — The late
Mayor Richard Daley built
Chicago's fine-tuned Democ
ratic political machine, Mayor
Jane Byrne stripped its gears
and now a federal judge may
have turned it off.
Patronage, the practice of
tying government jobs to polit
ical work, was declared uncon
stitutional last Monday in a
60-page decision issued by
U.S. District judge Nicholas |.
Bua.
Bua said patronage in Cook
County violates the First and
14th Amendment rights of
political candidates and voters,
and ruled that persons cannot
be required to perform politi
cal work in order to be hired or
retain public jobs.
"The point is that patronage
workers give an important ad
vantage to regular Democ
rats," Bua said in his decision.
Patronage assured decades
of Democratic Party control in
Chicago and was the foun
tainhead of the powerful or
ganization Daley built in his 20
years as mayor. The organiza
tion delivered clean streets
and, some say, the presidency
to John F. Kennedy in 1960.
Daley died in 1975 and power
transferred to Michael Bilan
dic, the organization's choice.
But Byrne, a maverick, upset
Bilandic last spring in his bid
for re-election.
Byrne won election as a
Democrat without the backing
of the organization that re
elected Daley five times and
swept Bilandic into r'' -> m a

special election after Daley's
death.
Chicago prides itself as "The
City That Works" — a slogan
that pays tribute to the
machine — and it was Bilan
dic's failure to deal effectively
with a deadly 1979 snowstorm
that proved his undoing.
Bua, in his decision, lashed
out at the practice of requiring
letters of political sponsorship
from applicants for govern
ment jobs. He said it repre
sents" deliberate governmental

discrimination," against Re
publicans and independents in
Cook County.
Cook County Democratic
Chairman George Dunne said
officials will challenge Bua's
decision in an appeal.
Elsewhere, Alan Campbell,
director of the United States
Office of Personnel Manage
ment, told The New York Times
that Bua's ruling "will have a
very substantial impact across
the country." But he noted that
it was not certain whether the

decision would be upheld.
The ruling stemmed from a
suit filed 10 years ago challeng
ing political firings and hirings
in the county. Another federal
judge ruled in 1972 that
employees could not be fired
for refusing to do political
work.
Bua scheduled a hearing for
Oct. 1, when he will begin
drawing up an injunction that
would hold in contempt of
court any person requiring a
letter of political sponsorship
from job applicants.
