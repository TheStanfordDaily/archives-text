# Elbow to elbow with marathon champ J. Kelley
## 
### 
Someone once said that
when you run the Boston
Marathon, you try to do two
things: a.) finish, b.) Finish
ahead of Old Johnny Kelley.
It's true. It's not just the
same if he's up ahead. For as
sportswriter Joe Falls observed
in his book on the most
heralded of all footraces, "He's
the one they all wait for. He's
the one you'd better beat to
the finish line. Once he passes
by, the crowds disperse. Once
he hits the finish line, most of
the spectators go home."
At 72 this month, Johnny
would probably have no prob
lem putting to shame the
youngest of the Angell Field an
cients here. He is much more
than the Grand Old Man of
marathon running. He is a living
legend. He is inspiration, a
symbol of determination and
refusal to quit that only grows
stronger as he grows older.
There's not much to say
about the man that hasn't al
ready been said, except that in
all the years of interviews, he
said no reporter had ever tried
his hand, his foot rather, at tak
ing a run with Johnny A. Kelley.

Ihis past summer I got the
chance to run with him in his
hometown ot East Dennis on
Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
It meant rising shortly before
5:30 a.m., the time he goes out
during the summer months.
(Wintertime, he sleeps in until
6.) It meant trying io keep up
with a man 3'/2 times my age
and roughly half my size.

Perhaps the world's most
celebrated marathoner along
with current champ Bill Ro
gers, Kelley says he receives
calls for interviews and invita
tions to races from all over the
world. On the morning I tele
phoned he had already spoken
with people in Minneapolis,
Las Vegas,Los Angeles and
Bermuda.
This was not the first time I
had seen Mr. Kelley, but it was
the first time I had met him
face-to-face.
In 1978 it had been face-to
back at the Boston Marathon,
when Johnny overtook me,

weary and slightly delerious, a
few hundred yards before the
finish line; we both had turned
in a time of 3:32.
"You know,"Johnny says, "a
few people wait for me this
time of morning, look for me
out their window." Casting
himself as some kind of wily
Santa Claus, he remarks, "They
say their day's just not the same
if I don't go by...But I can't go
everywhere."
Sometimes one pays a price
for being too popular. "One
year running the Boston
Marathon, I had my numbers
on both front and back, people
would recognize me from be
hind, and come up and give me
a slap. Jeepers I hurt at the end
of that day. So the next year I
took the numbers off the back,
but they still recognized me. It
didn't do any good."
When I arrive at his door at
5:30, he is wearing warm
clothes and a big smile. He
sports blue tights, a bandana
knotted at the forehead and
the famous painter's cap,
something of a Kelley
trademark. "Shhh," he says,
"Let's be quiet so we don't go
and wake up Mrs. Kelley." It is
52 degrees.
We start at a brisk walk be
cause, as Kelley explains it,
running is "violent exercise"
and is not to be rushed into.
We spit and cough and blow
out our noses and so forth,
then we break into a trot and
head down our first hill.
I ask him about the 1946
Boston marathon, one of seven
in which he placed second.
He had won the year before,
but in '46 Kelley was edged out
by Stylianos Kyriakides, an
emaciated Greek who came
over to Boston hoping to bring
attention to the plight of his
starving countrymen by win
ning the race.
The '46 race has been called
the most significant BAA (Bos
ton Athletic Assoc.) race of all
time. By catching Kelley at the
end and helping to dramatize
the Greeks' situation,
Kyriakides, who was himself
malnourished, triggered a
flood of foreign aid to Greece.
Kelley talks about the race as
if it were yesterday."I mis
judged him, that's all there is to

it. I got nervous with tour miles
to go so I went ahead and he let
me go. But then he'd catch up
with me. Finally he just wore
me out.
"Yes, he was over here to
show the world about his
country's hunger...," Kelley
says, but there is more to the
story.
Jerry Nathan, who used to be
a sportswriter for the Boston
Clobe and is credited with
knowing more about the Bos
ton Marathon than anyone in
the world (he saw his first Bos
ton Marathon when he was five
days old), interviewed
Kyriakides and Kelley following
the race. Years later he said
this: "As the Greek is telling
me about the poor children
with no eggs and no milk, old
Johnny Kelley is sitting there
and the tears are streaming
down his face. He's bawling
like a baby. Here he has just
lost one of the greatest
Marathon races ever run and
he's blubbering all over the
place."
Kelley, who has run 104
marathons so far and has run in
Boston every year save one
since 1932, still averages some
15-17 road races in a year. And
by his own count he has run
1364 in a lifetime. His favorite
distance is somewhat less than
marafthon length, around 15
miles.
He won Boston two times, in
193J5 and 1945,and he finished
in the top ten 19 times.
He clearly loves Boston,
loves the people at the race.
"And the other runners," he
says, "they're the greatest.
They're what keep you going."
Boston has been called the
"zenith" of marathons, and
has also been described by Los
Angeles Times writer Jim Mur
ray as "America's greatest foot
race, thousands of Walter Mit
tys bucking for flat feet and a
heart attack."
Kelley does more than help
to make it great: he epitomizes
the spirit of the race. "Yep," he
says proudly, "I'm part of it,
part of the furniture."
Then we make the long
climb — back upthe road to his
home. He leans into it, walks a
few brisk steps, then takes up
the jog again "Boy Scout

style," he says.
We reach the driveway, puf
fing but feeling loose. He
glances at his watch. We have
been running for about 45 mi
nutes. Not too long, for Kelley
has rarely run more than 60
miles a week in all his training;
that's one of the reasons he's
still around, he says.
He asks me to be sure to stay
warm as I rest up, then invites
me in fora minute. He gives me
a small photograph he made
out of a picture in Runner's
World magazine a few years
back.
There's johnny on the cover,
smiling, his arms raised high as
he finishes the 1975 Falmouth
Road Race. "Will you look this
alive on your 70th birthday?,"
the writer trumpets. I hope so.

by, the crowds disperse. Once
he hits the finish line, most of
the spectators go home."
At 72 this month, Johnny
would probably have no prob
lem putting to shame the
youngest of the Angell Field an
cients here. He is much more
than the Grand Old Man of
marathon running. He is a living
legend. He is inspiration, a
symbol of determination and
refusal to quit that only grows
stronger as he grows older.
There's not much to say
about the man that hasn't al
ready been said, except that in
all the years of interviews, he
said no reporter had ever tried
his hand, his foot rather, at tak
ing a run with Johnny A. Kelley.

Ihis past summer I got the
chance to run with him in his
hometown ot East Dennis on
Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
It meant rising shortly before
5:30 a.m., the time he goes out
during the summer months.
(Wintertime, he sleeps in until
6.) It meant trying io keep up
with a man 3'/2 times my age
and roughly half my size.

Perhaps the world's most
celebrated marathoner along
with current champ Bill Ro
gers, Kelley says he receives
calls for interviews and invita
tions to races from all over the
world. On the morning I tele
phoned he had already spoken
with people in Minneapolis,
Las Vegas,Los Angeles and
Bermuda.
This was not the first time I
had seen Mr. Kelley, but it was
the first time I had met him
face-to-face.
In 1978 it had been face-to
back at the Boston Marathon,
when Johnny overtook me,

weary and slightly delerious, a
few hundred yards before the
finish line; we both had turned
in a time of 3:32.
"You know,"Johnny says, "a
few people wait for me this
time of morning, look for me
out their window." Casting
himself as some kind of wily
Santa Claus, he remarks, "They
say their day's just not the same
if I don't go by...But I can't go
everywhere."
Sometimes one pays a price
for being too popular. "One
year running the Boston
Marathon, I had my numbers
on both front and back, people
would recognize me from be
hind, and come up and give me
a slap. Jeepers I hurt at the end
of that day. So the next year I
took the numbers off the back,
but they still recognized me. It
didn't do any good."
When I arrive at his door at
5:30, he is wearing warm
clothes and a big smile. He
sports blue tights, a bandana
knotted at the forehead and
the famous painter's cap,
something of a Kelley
trademark. "Shhh," he says,
"Let's be quiet so we don't go
and wake up Mrs. Kelley." It is
52 degrees.
We start at a brisk walk be
cause, as Kelley explains it,
running is "violent exercise"
and is not to be rushed into.
We spit and cough and blow
out our noses and so forth,
then we break into a trot and
head down our first hill.
I ask him about the 1946
Boston marathon, one of seven
in which he placed second.
He had won the year before,
but in '46 Kelley was edged out
by Stylianos Kyriakides, an
emaciated Greek who came
over to Boston hoping to bring
attention to the plight of his
starving countrymen by win
ning the race.
The '46 race has been called
the most significant BAA (Bos
ton Athletic Assoc.) race of all
time. By catching Kelley at the
end and helping to dramatize
the Greeks' situation,
Kyriakides, who was himself
malnourished, triggered a
flood of foreign aid to Greece.
Kelley talks about the race as
if it were yesterday."I mis
judged him, that's all there is to

it. I got nervous with tour miles
to go so I went ahead and he let
me go. But then he'd catch up
with me. Finally he just wore
me out.
"Yes, he was over here to
show the world about his
country's hunger...," Kelley
says, but there is more to the
story.
Jerry Nathan, who used to be
a sportswriter for the Boston
Clobe and is credited with
knowing more about the Bos
ton Marathon than anyone in
the world (he saw his first Bos
ton Marathon when he was five
days old), interviewed
Kyriakides and Kelley following
the race. Years later he said
this: "As the Greek is telling
me about the poor children
with no eggs and no milk, old
Johnny Kelley is sitting there
and the tears are streaming
down his face. He's bawling
like a baby. Here he has just
lost one of the greatest
Marathon races ever run and
he's blubbering all over the
place."
Kelley, who has run 104
marathons so far and has run in
Boston every year save one
since 1932, still averages some
15-17 road races in a year. And
by his own count he has run
1364 in a lifetime. His favorite
distance is somewhat less than
marafthon length, around 15
miles.
He won Boston two times, in
193J5 and 1945,and he finished
in the top ten 19 times.
He clearly loves Boston,
loves the people at the race.
"And the other runners," he
says, "they're the greatest.
They're what keep you going."
Boston has been called the
"zenith" of marathons, and
has also been described by Los
Angeles Times writer Jim Mur
ray as "America's greatest foot
race, thousands of Walter Mit
tys bucking for flat feet and a
heart attack."
Kelley does more than help
to make it great: he epitomizes
the spirit of the race. "Yep," he
says proudly, "I'm part of it,
part of the furniture."
Then we make the long
climb — back upthe road to his
home. He leans into it, walks a
few brisk steps, then takes up
the jog again "Boy Scout

style," he says.
We reach the driveway, puf
fing but feeling loose. He
glances at his watch. We have
been running for about 45 mi
nutes. Not too long, for Kelley
has rarely run more than 60
miles a week in all his training;
that's one of the reasons he's
still around, he says.
He asks me to be sure to stay
warm as I rest up, then invites
me in fora minute. He gives me
a small photograph he made
out of a picture in Runner's
World magazine a few years
back.
There's johnny on the cover,
smiling, his arms raised high as
he finishes the 1975 Falmouth
Road Race. "Will you look this
alive on your 70th birthday?,"
the writer trumpets. I hope so.

about the man that hasn't al
ready been said, except that in
all the years of interviews, he
said no reporter had ever tried
his hand, his foot rather, at tak
ing a run with Johnny A. Kelley.

Ihis past summer I got the
chance to run with him in his
hometown ot East Dennis on
Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
It meant rising shortly before
5:30 a.m., the time he goes out
during the summer months.
(Wintertime, he sleeps in until
6.) It meant trying io keep up
with a man 3'/2 times my age
and roughly half my size.

Perhaps the world's most
celebrated marathoner along
with current champ Bill Ro
gers, Kelley says he receives
calls for interviews and invita
tions to races from all over the
world. On the morning I tele
phoned he had already spoken
with people in Minneapolis,
Las Vegas,Los Angeles and
Bermuda.
This was not the first time I
had seen Mr. Kelley, but it was
the first time I had met him
face-to-face.
In 1978 it had been face-to
back at the Boston Marathon,
when Johnny overtook me,

weary and slightly delerious, a
few hundred yards before the
finish line; we both had turned
in a time of 3:32.
"You know,"Johnny says, "a
few people wait for me this
time of morning, look for me
out their window." Casting
himself as some kind of wily
Santa Claus, he remarks, "They
say their day's just not the same
if I don't go by...But I can't go
everywhere."
Sometimes one pays a price
for being too popular. "One
year running the Boston
Marathon, I had my numbers
on both front and back, people
would recognize me from be
hind, and come up and give me
a slap. Jeepers I hurt at the end
of that day. So the next year I
took the numbers off the back,
but they still recognized me. It
didn't do any good."
When I arrive at his door at
5:30, he is wearing warm
clothes and a big smile. He
sports blue tights, a bandana
knotted at the forehead and
the famous painter's cap,
something of a Kelley
trademark. "Shhh," he says,
"Let's be quiet so we don't go
and wake up Mrs. Kelley." It is
52 degrees.
We start at a brisk walk be
cause, as Kelley explains it,
running is "violent exercise"
and is not to be rushed into.
We spit and cough and blow
out our noses and so forth,
then we break into a trot and
head down our first hill.
I ask him about the 1946
Boston marathon, one of seven
in which he placed second.
He had won the year before,
but in '46 Kelley was edged out
by Stylianos Kyriakides, an
emaciated Greek who came
over to Boston hoping to bring
attention to the plight of his
starving countrymen by win
ning the race.
The '46 race has been called
the most significant BAA (Bos
ton Athletic Assoc.) race of all
time. By catching Kelley at the
end and helping to dramatize
the Greeks' situation,
Kyriakides, who was himself
malnourished, triggered a
flood of foreign aid to Greece.
Kelley talks about the race as
if it were yesterday."I mis
judged him, that's all there is to

it. I got nervous with tour miles
to go so I went ahead and he let
me go. But then he'd catch up
with me. Finally he just wore
me out.
"Yes, he was over here to
show the world about his
country's hunger...," Kelley
says, but there is more to the
story.
Jerry Nathan, who used to be
a sportswriter for the Boston
Clobe and is credited with
knowing more about the Bos
ton Marathon than anyone in
the world (he saw his first Bos
ton Marathon when he was five
days old), interviewed
Kyriakides and Kelley following
the race. Years later he said
this: "As the Greek is telling
me about the poor children
with no eggs and no milk, old
Johnny Kelley is sitting there
and the tears are streaming
down his face. He's bawling
like a baby. Here he has just
lost one of the greatest
Marathon races ever run and
he's blubbering all over the
place."
Kelley, who has run 104
marathons so far and has run in
Boston every year save one
since 1932, still averages some
15-17 road races in a year. And
by his own count he has run
1364 in a lifetime. His favorite
distance is somewhat less than
marafthon length, around 15
miles.
He won Boston two times, in
193J5 and 1945,and he finished
in the top ten 19 times.
He clearly loves Boston,
loves the people at the race.
"And the other runners," he
says, "they're the greatest.
They're what keep you going."
Boston has been called the
"zenith" of marathons, and
has also been described by Los
Angeles Times writer Jim Mur
ray as "America's greatest foot
race, thousands of Walter Mit
tys bucking for flat feet and a
heart attack."
Kelley does more than help
to make it great: he epitomizes
the spirit of the race. "Yep," he
says proudly, "I'm part of it,
part of the furniture."
Then we make the long
climb — back upthe road to his
home. He leans into it, walks a
few brisk steps, then takes up
the jog again "Boy Scout

style," he says.
We reach the driveway, puf
fing but feeling loose. He
glances at his watch. We have
been running for about 45 mi
nutes. Not too long, for Kelley
has rarely run more than 60
miles a week in all his training;
that's one of the reasons he's
still around, he says.
He asks me to be sure to stay
warm as I rest up, then invites
me in fora minute. He gives me
a small photograph he made
out of a picture in Runner's
World magazine a few years
back.
There's johnny on the cover,
smiling, his arms raised high as
he finishes the 1975 Falmouth
Road Race. "Will you look this
alive on your 70th birthday?,"
the writer trumpets. I hope so.
