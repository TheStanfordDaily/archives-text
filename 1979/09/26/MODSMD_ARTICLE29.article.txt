## The
						venerable art of second-guessing 
### 
- Ivan Maisel

Second-guessing the football
coach is the luel for many a post
game tire, and last Saturday Stanford
head coach Rod Dowhower pro
vided more fuel than a budding
OPEC nation.
Students, faculty, staft and alumni
alike have been muttering to them
selves all week since the 17-1} loss
Saturday to an underwhelming Army
team.
Dowhower acknowledged the in
ability of the Stanford offense to put
points on the board might be cause
lor questioning.
"It you want to second-guess the
coach, one thing I did do was think
we could run the ball at that (Army's)
end of the field," Dowhower said.
The Cardinals ripped down
the field with ease on three occa
sions, only to get cold teet once they
neared the goal line.
Once inside the ten, the bold, im
aginative offense with which Stan
lord is identified became as shy as
two ninth-graders on their first date.
On one second-quarter drive, the
( ards.moved from the Stanford 2.i to
the Army eight in only five plays,
three of which were passes.
All of a sudden, the offense trans
formed, running into the middle
twice and sweeping wide twice with
no success and Army took over the
ball on downs at the three.

Dowhower lended credence to
those who said pass instead of run,
saying "My sense of urgency is a lit
tle different," but derided those
who blindly second-guess.
"When I called pass and it fell in
complete and people say why didn't
I run, I'm not interested in that," he
said.
Most Cardinal fans are not as in
terested in why he didn't run as
much as why he did run.
Dowhower's offense is more con
servative than the what-will-they
do-next attack of the past two years.
"I don't think we're vanilla (p
-lain)," Dowhower said. "We've
thrown as much as or more than in
other games. We thought running
the ball would get us the yards we
needed."
The fact is the Cards have not
thrown as much as they did in last
season's first three games, when
they averaged 40 passes per game.
This season, I urk Schonert and )ohn
Elway have averaged but 24 passes
per outing.
Dowhower has not used the tight
ends to open up the middle nearly as
extensively as they were used last
year. The trio of Marty Smith, Mitch
Pleis and Pat Bowe c aught 18 passes
in the tirst three games of 1978 for a
total of 181 yards, 10 yards per grab.
This season Bowe (Smith and Pleis

graduated) has caught three passes
for only 23 yards.
One cannot ignore that injuries
and graduation hurt the offense.
Iwo-thirds of last year's starting
backtield is in the pros iquarterbac k
Steve Dils at Minnesosta and
fullback Phil Francis at San Fran
cisco) and the other third, Darrin
Nelson, redshirted with a bad leg.
Losing Nelson stripped the ol
tense of a lot of variety. Quite a
number of times last year Dils would
dump it off to Nelson in the flat and
let him spring something on his
own. The offense does not have that
option this season, nor do they have
his speed on the sweep.
Why, then, the increased depen
dence on the running game? Not
counting the funereal output against
Tulane, the running game has aver
aged 200 yards per game the passing
game 201.5. Last year the numbers
after the tirst three games were 149
yards rushing and 250 passing.
These are not answers, only
symptoms. All the loss to Army
proved was that the loss to Tulane
was no fluke. I here is something
wrong with the Stanford Cardinals.
Dowhower is convinced that, to
paraphrase Shakespeare, the fault
lies not in our system, but in ourse
lves. He resembled Jimmy Carter tel-

ling the country of a crisis of confi
dence, that we lacked the old one
two, that there was no spring in our
step.
"We have to get out of the dol
drums and play hard against Boston
College," Dowhower said, adding
that he does not foresee any per
sonnel changes.
it's so very easy to replace
people; that's not the answer. We're
not a pro team. We can't waive or cut
anybody. We've got them for four
years. They've got to get better. The
coaches have to help them im
prove," he said.
Flanker Ken Marge rum echoed
Dowhower's remarks.
"There's been talking among
players," the junior said, "trying to
put a finger on things, but we don't
know yet. We just have to raise our
heads and play harder against the
next team."
With the next team after Boston
College being Pacific-10 foe UCLA,
Margerum's words ring a special
truth. This week is the pivotal one
tor the Cards. If they "find them
selves," they can still right them
selves from their present listing pos
ition.
If they continue to flounder, how
ever, they will run into one helluva
storm when they hit Pac-10 waters.
