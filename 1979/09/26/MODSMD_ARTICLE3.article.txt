# Band submits student petitions to get fee assessment on ballet
## 
### Andrea James 
The Band turned in more than 3000
signatures yesterday to the ASSU Of
fice in the hope of getting on the tall
ASSU ballot for a spring quarter fee
assessment. The Band is requesting
the assessment so it can travel to Bos
ton next fall.
Last spring, students voted to give
the Band a two-quarter tee assess
ment tor fall and winter, totalling
about $20,000. The Band has sought
the two-quarter assessments for the
past eight years.
However, this year a three-quarter
assessment, about $30,000 total, will
be needed if the Band is to make its
traditional road trip with the football
team to the first game of the season
at Boston College.
"The last trip we took back East was
to Penn State three years ago,"
explained Band Manager Randy De
vol. "That trip cost $22,000 and that's
when gas was 30 cents a gallon!"
$ 10,000 cost
Devol said the Band's budget this
year barely allowed for the tradi
tional first-game trip to Tulane, La.
Thai trip cost $10,000, which did not
include food costs for the 70 Band
members who traveled to Tulane.
"Each Band member ended up
paying about $100 for food, and then
they lost even more by having to stop
their jobs," Devol said.
Began in '71
The Boston College game is slated
forSepl. 20,1980. The road trip tradi
tion began in 1971 when the Band
accompanied the football team to
the first game of the season in Arkan
sas. Since then, the Band has
traveled to Ohio, Arizona and other
states to keep up the tradition.
"When we asked for the two
quarter assessment in the spring, we
didn't know the first game was going
to be back East," Devol explained.

"When we found out, we went to
ASSU and people there said that if we
could get 20 percent of the student
boc./ to sign petitions, we could go
for a third fee assessment."
The petitions only indicate that the
students approve of having the initia
tive on the fall ballot In mid-
October, the students will vote on
whether to give the Band a $1 as
sessment for spring quarter.
Four organizations â€” 7he Stanford
Daily, K/SU, the Legal Counseling
Office and Club Sports were ap
proved three-quarter fee assess
ments last year by the student body.
The Speaker s Bureau, the Recycling
Center, and the Band asked for and
received the two-quarter assess
ments.
A handful of other organizations
requested and were voted a one
quarter tee assessment.
Bruce Bendix, ASSU financial
manager, said ASSU officials must

still check (he 3000 signatures to
make sure of the actual count. If 20
percent of the student body has
signed the petitions, the initiative
will be on the ballot.
Devol said he is confident there is a
sufficient number of signatures.
Election date
ASSU officials have not yet deter
mined the date of the mid-October
election. Tom Gart, a member of the
Council of Presidents (COP), said it
will be announced later this week.
The ballot will also include candi
dates for ASSU Senate. Now that the
districting plan is in effect, the COP
must decide if candidates can collect
signatures for their petitions
campus-wide oi it they can seek sig
natures only within their districts.
Gart said the COP will decide later
this week.
Persons interested in running for
the ASSU Senate can pick up peti
tions in the ASSU Office on the sec
ond tloor of Tresidder Union.
