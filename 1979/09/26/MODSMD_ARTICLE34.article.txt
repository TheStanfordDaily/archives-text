## Poloists tied for second at Irvine

With youth the predominant
feature of the squad, the de
tending national champion
Stanford water polo team
opens its Pacific-10 Confer
ence season today with a 3
p.m. game against Arizona at
deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal lineup, consist
ing of one senior, two juniors,
three sophomores and a
freshman, got its first test
against top competition last
weekend, finishing in a tie for
second with UC-Santa Barbara

at the prestigious Irvine tour
nament.
Perennial rival California
won the tournament, edging
Stanford 8-7 in a game that was
the third of the day for the
Cards in smoggy Irvine.
Santa Barbara, who Card
coach Dante Dettamanti con
siders one of the top three
teams in the country with Stan
ford and Cal, played the Cards
to a 4-4 tie. In previous games
last weekend, Stanford de
feated UC-Davis, Pepperdine,
UCLA and UC-lrvine.

Sophomore |ody Campbell
led the Cards in scoring tor the
tournament with 15 goals.
Chris Kelsey, another sopho
more, had 10 and freshman
standout )amie Bergeson
added eight.
Though the team could not
successfully defend the tour
nament title they won last year,
Dettamanti said he wasn't re
ally disappointed with Stan
ford's showing last weekend
He said the Cards were ham
pered by pre-tournament in
juries to two starters and a late
start of preseason practice.
With the debut of the Pac-10
season today, the weeks of
practice become very impor
tant. According to Dettamanti,
the Cards will approach the
Arizona game with a different
attitude than they approached
the Irvine tournament.
He explained that Stanford's
goal for the season, naturally,
is to qualify for the NCAA
championships in November.
"And that means we must win
the Pac-10," Dettamanti said.
Pac-10 games will get much
more emphasis than non
conference games and tour
naments, which Dettamanti
said he considers just prepara
tion for league play.
The Cardinals will be relying
on a strong counter-attack to
wear down their league oppo
nents. This potent weapon,
Stanford's trademark in the
Pac-10, was a key to their suc
cess last year. Dettamanti also
noted good driving off the hole
position and a balanced scor
ing attack as the team's strong
points this year.
And then there's Gansel.

John Gansel, the ever
present goalie tor the Cards,
has been the dominant cage
defender in the nation tor the
past two years. The soft
spoken junior will be counted
on to anchor a team defense
which, Dettamanti admits,
needs to be better
coordinated. The loss of three
starting seniors from last year's
team has left this year's version
with a few gaps, according to
Dettamanti.
"We've always had tre
mendous depth," the third
year coach said. "But this year
we're going to have to develop
the back-up players. We have
an untested, inexperienced
second unit."
Arizona, today's opponent,
should provide a good test tor
the Cardinals. The wildcats
have improved their team with
the addition of several
Olympic-class swimmers such
as Tim Shaw, a transfer from
Long Beach State.
The Cardinals face Pepper
dine, a top California team,
tomorrow at 3 p.m. at de-
Cuerre Pool.

to a 4-4 tie. In previous games
last weekend, Stanford de
feated UC-Davis, Pepperdine,
UCLA and UC-lrvine.

Sophomore |ody Campbell
led the Cards in scoring tor the
tournament with 15 goals.
Chris Kelsey, another sopho
more, had 10 and freshman
standout )amie Bergeson
added eight.
Though the team could not
successfully defend the tour
nament title they won last year,
Dettamanti said he wasn't re
ally disappointed with Stan
ford's showing last weekend
He said the Cards were ham
pered by pre-tournament in
juries to two starters and a late
start of preseason practice.
With the debut of the Pac-10
season today, the weeks of
practice become very impor
tant. According to Dettamanti,
the Cards will approach the
Arizona game with a different
attitude than they approached
the Irvine tournament.
He explained that Stanford's
goal for the season, naturally,
is to qualify for the NCAA
championships in November.
"And that means we must win
the Pac-10," Dettamanti said.
Pac-10 games will get much
more emphasis than non
conference games and tour
naments, which Dettamanti
said he considers just prepara
tion for league play.
The Cardinals will be relying
on a strong counter-attack to
wear down their league oppo
nents. This potent weapon,
Stanford's trademark in the
Pac-10, was a key to their suc
cess last year. Dettamanti also
noted good driving off the hole
position and a balanced scor
ing attack as the team's strong
points this year.
And then there's Gansel.

John Gansel, the ever
present goalie tor the Cards,
has been the dominant cage
defender in the nation tor the
past two years. The soft
spoken junior will be counted
on to anchor a team defense
which, Dettamanti admits,
needs to be better
coordinated. The loss of three
starting seniors from last year's
team has left this year's version
with a few gaps, according to
Dettamanti.
"We've always had tre
mendous depth," the third
year coach said. "But this year
we're going to have to develop
the back-up players. We have
an untested, inexperienced
second unit."
Arizona, today's opponent,
should provide a good test tor
the Cardinals. The wildcats
have improved their team with
the addition of several
Olympic-class swimmers such
as Tim Shaw, a transfer from
Long Beach State.
The Cardinals face Pepper
dine, a top California team,
tomorrow at 3 p.m. at de-
Cuerre Pool.
