The Stanford field hockey
team began its season on a
promising note last Saturday,
defeating Chico State 3-0. The
junior varsity was also victori
ous in its opener against Butte
College last Wednesday, win
ning by an identical score.
Freshmen Kathy Nicholson
and Becky Howell tallied one
goal apiece to lead the varsity
triumph. Cardinal coach Bar
bara Longstreth was particu
larly pleased with Howell, "ab

out whom you'll be hearing a
lot,"Longstreth promised.
Longstreth lauded co
captain Nancy Jackson for a
strong all-around effort and
Cecca Freccero for her shutout
in goal.
Making Freccero's effort
more impressive was the fact
that was her first game in goal.
Freccero had played in the field
last season.
The JV triumph was paced by
freshman Patty Campbell's two
goals and sophomore |ody
Higgins' one.
