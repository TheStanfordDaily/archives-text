# Kennedy vague on specific differences
## Carter, Kennedy agree on most issues 
### 
Washington (AP) — Once there was a
Democratic presidential candidate who
said that the compelling issue was leader
ship, not an itemized list of programs and
proposals.
Now there is a potential who says much
the same thing.
The first was Jimmy Carter in 1976. The
second is Sen. Edward Kennedy, who
may contest Carter's renomination in
1980.
Search for the compelling items that di
vide the president and the senator from
Massachusetts and you will search in vain.
There are more programs on which they
agree than on which they differ.
Ask Kennedy for specifics on what he
would do differently as president and
you'll get an answer like this:
'Deepening Crisis'
"I think right now what we're seeing, of
course, is the substantial inflation, 13 per
cent inflation, the increase of three-tenths
of one percent in the unemployment, the
beginning of the pressures in terms of re
cession. We're going to face, I think, an
important and deepening crisis in our
economy in the latter part of this year

about how we're going to balance the ef
forts to deal both with the inflationary and
the recessionary pressures.
"And the way we come to grips with
those is going to have, I think, very sig
nificant implications in a variety of diffe
rent fronts over the period of the early
'80s."
That's a lot of words without an answer.
Some frustration
There is some frustration among Carter
loyalists at Kennedy's ability to generate
support without getting down to itemized
proposals, but probably no more than
there was among Carter's 1976 rivals at the
difficulty of pinning him down to specifics.
Not that Carter campaigned without
proposals. He made scores, and eventu
ally hundreds. But most of them came
without numbers or dollar signs, or
specifics on the way they would be im
plemented.
Carter always said he had been as
specific as any other candidate. And at one
point during that campaign, he said, "It's
not the little, individual, com
partmentalized interests that concern

people when they vote," he said on April
28,1976. "They're searching for somebody
whom they can trust and who cares about
them and who is competent."
The critical question
Now it is Kennedy who is talking about
leadership, saying that the critical ques
tion to him is the way the administration
addresses such problems as inflation and
unemployment.
. . It's back to whether the people
have the sense of confidence that he can
deal with these issues. I think that's the
matter of deepening and increasing con-,
cern to people as we come to the 1980s,"
he said.
And Carter seems to have changed his
mind about the impact of specific prog
rams on the attitude of the public, at least
as it is reflected in his slumping poll rat
ings.
. . most of the decisions that have to
be made by a president are inherently not
popular ones," he said the other day.
"They are contentious. There is not a
single vote to be derived from the evolu
tion of a national energy policy. . . •"
