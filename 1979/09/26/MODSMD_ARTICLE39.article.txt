It's funny how misconceptions and
generalizations about college newspap
ers are disseminated and accepted so
readily.
Coming to Stanford two years ago as a
freshman, I feared the competition I
thought I would encounter in trying to
break into the staff at the Stanford Daily
â€”a daily college publication. I was one of
those red-hot high school journalists with
aspirations of being the next Bob Wood
ward, but I loathed the thought of spend
ing countless hours a week proving my
dedication to the paper was more valu
able than that of the 50 other cub repor
ters vying for a few precious positions.
But it wasn't like that at all.
The competition I feared never
materialized. I was given a position of
some responsibility, but my time com
mitment was much more flexible than I
had expected.

It's the same way now, after two years
of hanging around the office. I've come
to realize that there is always more news
to cover than there are reporters to cover
it.
In those same two years, I've seen a
dedicated pre-med run the paper effi
ciently in a difficult volume. But the trou
bles have been washed away by the en
thusiasm of a newly selected editorial
staff.
Out of the quasi-ashes has risen a
quasi-phoenix.
Help us fly.
