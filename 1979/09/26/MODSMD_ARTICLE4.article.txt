# Shelving problems stall library opening
## 
### Robert Reed 
Problems with shelving will pre
vent the addition to Green Library
from opening until winter quarter,
according to Philip Leighton, library
buildings projects manager.
The Green Library addition may
open in either December, January or
February, at least a year later than
originally scheduled, he said.
"The principle cause for that delay
has been the difficulty in acquiring
the shelving," Leighton explained.
1 he manufacturer, Estey Company ot
San Jose, has been almost a year later
in supplying that shelving because of
its own difficulty in meeting ear
thquake safety requirements.
"The shelving is part of the con
struction contract, and because it's
part ot the construction contract, it
fell within the jurisdiction of the
structural engineers to specify it. The
structural engineers specified shelv
ing with seismic requirements,"
Leighton said, "which in effect no
shelving manufacturer had ever met
before."
One of the simplest ways to handle
seismic requirements, he added, is
to attach the shelving to the building
at the floor and the ceiling.
Attaching shelving
"In this case, the architects were
convinced they wanted the shelving
to be tied to the building only on the
floor, and not at the top at all,"
Leighton said.
He explained that the shelving
manufacturer had first indicated it
would be able to meet what now
seem to be rather difficult require
ments. It balked on that agreement
about a year ago, however. Lstey Co.
claimed at that time its facilities were
not adequately equipped to meet the
specified design.

It was "very conceivable" the Uni
versity would sue fcstey if it breached
its contract and did not deliver the
shelves by April 1, Leighton said in
January.
No rebiddiiiK
•lit faced with a choice between
Wbning out its technical difficulties
With Estey and reopening bids, the
University decided to stay with Lstey,
Leighton said yesterday. It realized
going out to rebid would cost much
more money, "possibly hundreds of
thousands of dollars," he added.
The manufacturer suggested a
number of ideas to cut time and cost,
he said, but University engineers
have rejected these as hazardous.
The first shipment of shelves was
scheduled to have arrived Monday.
Leighton said it will be the end of the
year before shelving is installed. Fol
lowing the shelving installation, elec
trical hook-ups, carpeting, and fur
nishing will be installed.
Shelving crucial
"Shelving is not the final act ot
completing the building, but at this
point it is crucial," he said.
leighton said the building might
be opened as early as January, even
though all the book collections may
not be shelved by that time.
"We would be opening the build
ing in part to provide access to the
collections as we move them in,"
Leighton said.
He added that because of the prob
lems with shelving, the June 5 flood
in Green I ibrary had no real effect on
the date of the new addition's open
ing.
The flood, which caused an esti
mated $250,000 damage, would have
set the project back by about two
months had there been no problems
with shelving, he said.
