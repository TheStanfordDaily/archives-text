President blasts Cuban story
New York — Russian troops in Cuba are part
of a combat force, despite Soviet claims to the
contrary, and their status will have to be
changed, President jimmy Carter said yester
day,
Carter, on a one-day trip to New York City,
told a "town meeting" in Queens that he will
report to the nation soon — "probably within
the next week" — on the Cuban situation.
The president also issued a harsh condem
nation of Cuba and disputed claims by Soviet
leaders that Russian troops on the island are
merely advisers and do not make up a combat
force.
In what was apparently a reply to a speech
that Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko
made earlier to the United Nations, Carter in
sisted: "It is a combat unit."
Earlier, Gromyko had told the U.N. General
Assembly that "all sorts of falsehoods are
being piled up concerning the policies of Cuba
and the Soviet Union." He added: "It is high
time that you honestly admit that this whole
matter is artificial."
In Washington, Sen. Frank Church ID-
Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, recommended yesterday
that the panel delay sending the SALT II treaty
to the Senate until something is done about
the Soviet troops in Cuba.
Church said the matter can be "closed" only
after Carter certifies to the Senate that these
Soviet combat forces are no longer in Cuba.
The Idaho senator added that " I do not want
to see the SALT 11 treaty rejected by the Senate.
For this reason, I am of the opinion that the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee should
defer reporting the treaty to the Senate until
the t urrent negotiations have been completed
and the results are known."
Mistrial in Newton case
Oakland — A jury retrying Black Panther
leader Fluey Newton failed to reach a verdict
yesterday in the slaying of an Oakland prosti
tute five years ago. I he judge, declaring a mist
rial, asked the prosecution to decide whether
it wants to try Newton a third time.
Superior Court judge Donald McjPullum de
clared a mistrial after the eight-woman, four
man panel deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal, a re
peat of Newton's first trial which ended March
24 when the jury voted 10-2 for acquittal.
Newton has been accused of gunning down
17-year-old Kathleen Smith on an Oakland
street corner.
The mistrial came after four days of jurors'
deliberations at the Alameda County cour
thouse.
lurors earlier had asked to rehear the tes
timony of Michelle lenkins, a witness who tes
tified at the first trial that Newton was the man
who shot Smith in the early morning hours of
Aug. b, 1974. She later recanted her testimony
and refused to testify at the retrial.
Deputy District Attorney Tom Orloff, who
has failed twice in less than six months to suc
cessfully prosecute the controversial Black

Panther leader, must now decide whether to
seek a third trial.
It was Newton's seventh felony trial and his
fifth murder trial — three of them in the 1967
killing of Oakland policeman John Frey. His
conviction in the first trial was reversed. The
second and third trials ended in hung juries,
and the prosecution declined to stage a fourth
trial. He spent 22 months in prison in the first
murder conviction.
Carter campaigns for transit
New York — President Carter said yesterday
his proposals to aid mas« transportation will
erase decades of neglect and "reclaim Ameri
ca's transit systems" unless Congress rejects
his proposed tax on oil company profits.
In a speech to the American Public Transit
Association, Carter also promised mass transit
systems will continue to get priority allocation
of gasoline and diesel fuel if shortages de
velop. "We will keep them rolling," he said.
Carter said he has made proposals that
would produce 40,000 jobs throughout the
1980s, save "massive" amounts of energy and
add 15 million passengers a day to buses,
streetcars and subways.
Carter spoke glowingly of the future of mass
transit but said, "for this program to succeed,
the Congress absolutely must approve one
major element — the windfall profits tax."
He said lobbyists "are swarming all over
Capitol Hill, working to devastate," the tax on
excess oil company profits by cutting back
sharply on the $140 billion the administration
claims it would produce for the Treasury over
10 years.
House votes salary increase
Washington — House members voted yes
terday to give themselves a 5.5 percent raise,
increasing their salaries to more than $60,600 a
year on Oct. 1.
Three times previously the House had shied
away from approving a pay raise for members
of Congress, top-level government officials
and federal judges. The congressmen reversed
themselves yesterday on a narrow roll call vote
of 208 to 203. The bill now heads for an uncer
tain fate in the Senate.
The approval, recommended by the House
Appropriations Committee, was signaled ear
lier when the House rejected a bid to prohibit
members of Congress from receiving any sal
ary increase this year.
Opponents of a pay raise got a clean shot at
killing the proposal outright yesterday when
Rep. George O'Brien (R-III.) offered an
amendment that would have frozen the pay of
legislators and senior government officials at
current levels.
Members of Congress now receive $57,000 a
year although their leaders are paid more.
The 5.5 percent increase applies to salaries
of members of Congress and to federal
employees and judges who make at least
$47,500 a year.

State enacts new rape law
Sacramento — An Oregon-type law allowing
a wife who has been sexually assaulted by her
husband to charge him with rape was signed
by Gov. Jerry Brown yesterday.
The measure, by Assemblyman Floyd Mori
(D-Pleasanton) would remove a century-old
provision in California law saying that rape
does not apply within the confines of a mar
riage.
The measure, effective next year, will allow
one spouse to charge another with rape by
force or threat of force. It removes references
to gender, so that a woman theoretically could
be charged with rape.
Feminist groups, who joined law enforce
ment in supporting the bill, denounced the
spousal exception as a remnant of medieval
times when a wife was viewed as her husband's
property.
The bill is patterned after an Oregon law
under which the nation's first known
husband-wife rape trial was held last year. The
defendant, John Rideout, was acquitted.
Some opponents said they feared a rape
charge would be used to try to extort a divorce
settlement. A group of defense lawyers
criticized a bill as a phony solution to marital
violence, saying counseling and attacks on un
employment and alcoholism would be more
effective.
But Mori said yesterday that the bill "is a
statement by Calitornians that we will not tol
erate violence in the home."
Court rules in BART's favor
San Francisco — The state Court of Appeal
ruled yesterday the Bay Area Rapid Transit has
the right to transfer employees and discipline
workers who occupied a building in the cur
rent labor dispute.
The court set aside a Contra Costa County
Superior Court injunction that included stop
ping BART from any mass transfers of person
nel and prohibited any discipline against union
members occupying the shop.
The decision notes that under federal law
slowdowns and seizures of the employers'
plant are not protected activities and the exis
tence of a labor dispute or an unfair labor prac
tice does not justify the seizure ot a plant.
"In the absence of any agreement to the
contrary, BART employees serve at the plea
sure of the general manager, who has author
ity with certain limitations to appoint, discip
line or remove all officers and employees sub
ject to the rules and regulations adopted by the
board', " said the decision.
Mrs. Eisenhower hospitalized
Washington — Mamie Eisenhower, who was
admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center
yesterday after a stroke, has been frail and
bedridden for several months, Julie
Eisenhower said.
"She's been in delicate health for many
years," said Julie Eisenhower, who is married
to Maurice Eisenhower's grandson, David.
"She has an enlarged heart and hasn't been

able to get out bed for several months."
The 82-year-old widow of President Dwight
Eisenhower was rushed to Walter Reed Army
Medical Center by a volunteer fire department
ambulance from her farm on the edge of the
Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg, Pa. She has
lived at the farm since her husband died in
1969.
As she arrived at the hospital, reporters saw
her doctor holding her hand and talking to her.
Her eyes were closed.
Eisenhower was taken immediately to the
Eisenhower Nursing Suite, a VIP facility named
for her late husband.
A medical bulletin issued by the hospital two
hours after Eisenhower's arrival said the
former first lady was in stable condition and
had been placed on medication.
Stocks close up .3 points
New York — A late rally led by oil issues
snapped the stock market out of daylong dol
drums today and erased the losses chalked up
earlier in the session.
The rise came after the Senate Finance
Committee, defying the wishes of the Carter
administration, voted unanimously to allow a
major portion of U.S. oil production to escape
the propsed "windfall profits" tax.
Tbe Dow (ones average of 30 industrials
edged up .34 to 886.18.
Bill for Tellico Dam signed
New York — President Jimmy Carter an
nounced last night he has signed "with mixed
reactions" a $10.86 billion appropriation bill
that includes funds to complete the controver
sial Tellico Dam in Tennessee, a project that
threatens the tiny snail darter fish.
Citing that both houses of Congress au
thorized completion of the Tellico project by
clear majorities, Carter said, "I accept, with
regret, this action as expressing the will of the
Ccngress."
The president said that if he vetoed the mea
sure, Tellico would repeatedly be the subject
of future legislative battles and might in the
end undermine the principles of the En
dangered Species Act, which he promised to
enforce vigorously.
"As president, I must balance many compet
ing interests," Carter said. "With many impor
tant national issues before the Congress . . I
believe that avoiding a divisive veto battle will
help focus congressional efforts on priority
concerns."
The appropriations measure contains $36
million for the Tellico project. Some $100 mill
ion has already been spent on the dam, which
is 90 percent complete.
Conservation troops were virtually unanim
ous in their opposition to the project, located
on the Little Tennessee River. They had urged
Carter to veto the entire appropriations bill.
