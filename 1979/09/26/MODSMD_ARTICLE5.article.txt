# Problems with black chrome rods cause delay
## Albers Wall construction may resume next week

Construction of the controver
sial Albers Wall north of the Quad
may resume next week if
sculpture materials meet the Uni
versity's quality standards, ac
cording to Project Manager Roger
Cairns.
The project has been plagued
by construction delays since
groundbreaking for the 55-foot
long wall in the spring of 1978.
This latest stall, which began
early this year, concerns prob
lems with the black chrome rods.
These rods, which are a major part
of the sculpture, have not met the
University's specifications be
cause their outer finish is not un
iform in color, explained Peter
Hopf, associate director of
facilities.
The finish on the rods has been
re-worked four times but is still
not "the right color which is es
sential for this art object," Hopf
said.
The next step, laying the rest of
the bricks, cannot be done until
the rods are in place.
The rods are now at a Los
Angeles plating company, and
Cairns said he feels "fairly confi
dent about the experience of the
firm."
Los Angeles firms have more
expertise in this type of work than
companies in the Bay Area, Cairns

said.
Earlier problems with Albers
Wall have involved the color of
the bricks, and the assembly and
tinish of stainless steel sections of
the sculpture.
The contractors for the job, De-
Icon Associates, explained in an
August letter to the University that
material specifications were dif
ficult to meet because no research
had been done before the com
pany was given the contract.
But Cairns said that even
though the project is setting a
precedent, research did not ap
pear needed because Albers' de
signs seemed to contain all
specifics.
"Materials did not seem too
hard to develop," Cairns said.
"I'm disappointed in the inability
of the contractor to pursue the
job."
He added it would be to the
University's disadvantage to
break the contract with Delcon,
however.
"Plating and refinishing have al
ready been done and a switch in
contractors would cause further
delay and monetary problems,"
he said. The projected cost of the
project has not changed since
construction began.
"It is the time that is despair
ing," Cairns said.
