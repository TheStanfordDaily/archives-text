## Begin rebuffs Jesse Jackson Israel turns over Sinai 
### 
Tel Aviv, Israel (AP) — Israel
turned over 2,600 square miles
of Sinai wilderness to Egypt
yesterday as part of the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
"Both sides are contributing
to peace, and both sides are
making sacrifices for peace,"
said Israeli Brig. Gen. Dov Sion
as he turned over control of a
triangular sector of south
central Sinai to Egyptian Brig.
Gen. Saf-el-Din Avu Shnaf.
"We have achieved more in
peace than we have by all our
wars," Sion added.
Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin stressed the
same sentiment Tuesday,
maintaining that agreement
with Egypt was only the start of
an overall peace in the Middle
East.
"It never occurred to us . . .
that we should sign a treaty of
peace and then say,'enough,' "
Begin said. He repeated his
calls to Jordan and Syria to join
the peace talks.
Israeli and Egyptian honor
guards and bands accom
panied the brief military cere
mony at Abu Durba, a desert
outpost on the Suez Gulf. Is
rael lowered its flag at the site
at 11:25 a.m. local time, and
the Egyptian flag was then
raised over the area. The cere
mony marked the third time Is
rael has turned over a Sinai
parcel to Egypt under terms of
the Marc h treaty.
The mountainous region
turned over to Egypt Tuesday is
populated by about 3,000 Be
douin and contains no impor
tant Israeli military installa
tions. It is in the south-central
part ot the peninsula, which Is
rael captured in the 1967
Mideast war. The area north of
St. Catherine's Monastery at
the site is revered as the bibli
cal Mount Sinai.
Israel is to turn over Mt. Sinai
in November, ahead of the
schedule which originally cal
led for the transfer to be car
ried out in January. Egyptian

President Anwar Sadat plans a
special celebration at the site
to commemorate the second
anniversary of his historic trip
to Jerusalem on Nov. 19, 1977.
Americans stay
Up to 200 U.S. civilians
would remain in the Sinai De
sert to help monitor the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty
under a tentative agreement
announced last week.
American aerial reconnais
sance was also assigned a key
role in the formula reached
during two days of intensive
negotiations. The principal
peacekeeping role was given
to Egypt and Israel, which will
form mixed patrols.
Initially, the U.N. Emergency
Force was to monitor Israel's
withdrawal over three years
under terms of the peace treaty
with Egypt. But the Soviet Un
ion, in deference to Arab allies
opposed to the treaty, blocked
that approach in the U.N. Sec
urity Council.
American technicians were
first sent to the Sinai in 1975 to
help monitor two partial Israeli
pullbacks. The mission was
supposed to end with the U.N.
force taking over.
Keeping the Americans
there "is merely an extension
of the role which the Sinai field
mission has been playing in the
past," according to United
States Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance.
Vance stressed that the ar
rangement is an interim one —
to last up to three years.
Beyond that point, he said,
there is no agreement.
Self-rule issue unsolved
Israeli and Egyptian
negotiators resume talks on
Palestinian self-rule Wednes
day in Alexandria, but the two
countries have yet to grapple
successfully with the issue of
autonomy for the more than
one million Arabs living under
Israeli occupation on the West
Bank of the Jordan River and in
the Gaza Strip.

Israel has accepted several
U.S. proposals for accelerating
the talks, including the estab
lishment of technical commit
tees to work out details con
cerning agriculture, education
and finance for the West Bank
government.
The suggestions, brought by
special U.S. envoy Robert
Strauss two weeks ago, do not
touch the delicate issue of the
legal status of an autonomy
government. Israel wants the
body to have narrowly defined
powers, while Egypt is pushing
for a more independent gov
ernment.
Jackson meets Israelis
Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson held another round of
political meetings yesterday
after the Israelis shot down his
call for recognition of the
Palestine l iberation Organiza
tion.
Jackson and his 15-member
group had meetings scheduled
with Jerusalem Mayor Teddy
Kollek, opposition Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres, and polit
ical leaders in the occupied
West Bank of the Jordan River.
The American black activist
leader arrived Monday and
told Kollek and former Israeli
U.N. Ambassador Simha Dinitz
that Israel should "relieve
America of its gag policy and
recognize the PLO."

with Egypt. But the Soviet Un
ion, in deference to Arab allies
opposed to the treaty, blocked
that approach in the U.N. Sec
urity Council.
American technicians were
first sent to the Sinai in 1975 to
help monitor two partial Israeli
pullbacks. The mission was
supposed to end with the U.N.
force taking over.
Keeping the Americans
there "is merely an extension
of the role which the Sinai field
mission has been playing in the
past," according to United
States Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance.
Vance stressed that the ar
rangement is an interim one —
to last up to three years.
Beyond that point, he said,
there is no agreement.
Self-rule issue unsolved
Israeli and Egyptian
negotiators resume talks on
Palestinian self-rule Wednes
day in Alexandria, but the two
countries have yet to grapple
successfully with the issue of
autonomy for the more than
one million Arabs living under
Israeli occupation on the West
Bank of the Jordan River and in
the Gaza Strip.

Israel has accepted several
U.S. proposals for accelerating
the talks, including the estab
lishment of technical commit
tees to work out details con
cerning agriculture, education
and finance for the West Bank
government.
The suggestions, brought by
special U.S. envoy Robert
Strauss two weeks ago, do not
touch the delicate issue of the
legal status of an autonomy
government. Israel wants the
body to have narrowly defined
powers, while Egypt is pushing
for a more independent gov
ernment.
Jackson meets Israelis
Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson held another round of
political meetings yesterday
after the Israelis shot down his
call for recognition of the
Palestine l iberation Organiza
tion.
Jackson and his 15-member
group had meetings scheduled
with Jerusalem Mayor Teddy
Kollek, opposition Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres, and polit
ical leaders in the occupied
West Bank of the Jordan River.
The American black activist
leader arrived Monday and
told Kollek and former Israeli
U.N. Ambassador Simha Dinitz
that Israel should "relieve
America of its gag policy and
recognize the PLO."
Tel Aviv, Israel (AP) — Israel
turned over 2,600 square miles
of Sinai wilderness to Egypt
yesterday as part of the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
"Both sides are contributing
to peace, and both sides are
making sacrifices for peace,"
said Israeli Brig. Gen. Dov Sion
as he turned over control of a
triangular sector of south
central Sinai to Egyptian Brig.
Gen. Saf-el-Din Avu Shnaf.
"We have achieved more in
peace than we have by all our
wars," Sion added.
Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin stressed the
same sentiment Tuesday,
maintaining that agreement
with Egypt was only the start of
an overall peace in the Middle
East.
"It never occurred to us . . .
that we should sign a treaty of
peace and then say,'enough,' "
Begin said. He repeated his
calls to Jordan and Syria to join
the peace talks.
Israeli and Egyptian honor
guards and bands accom
panied the brief military cere
mony at Abu Durba, a desert
outpost on the Suez Gulf. Is
rael lowered its flag at the site
at 11:25 a.m. local time, and
the Egyptian flag was then
raised over the area. The cere
mony marked the third time Is
rael has turned over a Sinai
parcel to Egypt under terms of
the Marc h treaty.
The mountainous region
turned over to Egypt Tuesday is
populated by about 3,000 Be
douin and contains no impor
tant Israeli military installa
tions. It is in the south-central
part ot the peninsula, which Is
rael captured in the 1967
Mideast war. The area north of
St. Catherine's Monastery at
the site is revered as the bibli
cal Mount Sinai.
Israel is to turn over Mt. Sinai
in November, ahead of the
schedule which originally cal
led for the transfer to be car
ried out in January. Egyptian

President Anwar Sadat plans a
special celebration at the site
to commemorate the second
anniversary of his historic trip
to Jerusalem on Nov. 19, 1977.
Americans stay
Up to 200 U.S. civilians
would remain in the Sinai De
sert to help monitor the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty
under a tentative agreement
announced last week.
American aerial reconnais
sance was also assigned a key
role in the formula reached
during two days of intensive
negotiations. The principal
peacekeeping role was given
to Egypt and Israel, which will
form mixed patrols.
Initially, the U.N. Emergency
Force was to monitor Israel's
withdrawal over three years
under terms of the peace treaty
with Egypt. But the Soviet Un
ion, in deference to Arab allies
opposed to the treaty, blocked
