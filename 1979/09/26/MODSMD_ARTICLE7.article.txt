Washington (AP) — With
India showing considerable
strength, the underdeveloped
countries outpaced developed
nations in economic growth
last year, the World Bank said
Sunday.
It also said India was the
largest borrower of bank re
sources, obtaining a total of
just under $1.2 billion, fol
lowed by Indonesia, Brazil and
Mexico.
In its annual report, the bank
said growth of all developing
count. 2s, excluding major oil
e\porters, was 4.9 percent in
i478, more than a full percen
tage point above the indus
trialized nations' 1.6 percent
growth rate.

"A health export perfor
mance was one major cause of
recent growth in the develop
ing world— especially in those
countries with more advanced
and diversified economies,"
the report said.
It said growth in South Asia,
dominated statistically by In
dia, was 5.4 percent, while in
East Asia, it was 8.9 percent.
The report cautioned against
any feelings of euphoria from
the strong growth in much of
the underdeveloped world. It
said it would take 100 years for
poor nations to close the gap
with industrial nations even if
the growth of poor nations
were doubled while industrial
nations didn't grow at all.
