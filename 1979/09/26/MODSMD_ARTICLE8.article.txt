# Zimbabwe talks floundering

London (AP) — As the
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia peace
talks enter their third week,
British sources hold out little
hope for total success in settl
ing issues that have left the
country ravaged by war, di
vided by politics and
weakened by economic sanc
tions.
Prime Minister Abel
Muzorewa's conditional ag
reement to drop the present
constitution's guarantee of
white parliamentary seats was
an important concession, but
the talks are still a long way
from the stated aim of ending
the 7-year-old war and leading
the rebel colony to recognized
independence.
Before the fighting stops, the
current black-led administra
tion and the black guerrilla al
liance that is its sworn enemy
would have to decide who will
run a new government and
control the guns.
Some British sources say pri
vately they rate as low as 20
percent the chances of an
overall settlement — so great
are the differences between
the warring parties.
Muzorewa's agreement to
drop the white powers en
trenched in his unrecognized
constitution improves Britain's
chances of getting the guerrilla
movement into line on a new
constitution.

The guerrillas oppose the
present constitution on the
grounds it allows the tiny white
minority continued control of
the country.
Britain's Conservative gov
ernment is likely to be under
pressure at its annual party
congress next month to end
trade embargoes imposed on
the previous white Rhodesian
government. The sanctions
have been maintained against
the government led by
Muzorewa, the country's first
black prime minister.
The Patriotic Front guerrilla
alliance insists pn getting rid of
Muzorewa, setting up a new
transition administration and
building a new national army
with its fighters at the core.
Smith dissents
In what appeared to be care
fully vague terms, Muzorewa
announced his bi-racial dele
gation's acceptance of the
"general principles" of Bri
tain's constitutional draft,
which would sharply reduce
the whites' powers. The sole
dissenter was white former
Prime Minister lan Smith, now
a government delegate.
It was Smith, leader of the
colonial government, who
broke unilaterally with Britain
in 1965 in an attempt to stave
off black-majority rule.
Muzorewa was clear about
demanding an immediate end

to the trade embargoes,
applied by most world nations,
including Britain and the Un
ited States, and endorsed by
the United Nations. But his
qualifying statement, on which
he would not be questioned,
was cloudy.
Smith was deserted by the
other white delegates in his
protest that special safeguards
are essential for the confi
dence of the dwindling white
population of 230,000. Some of
the whites said privately they
had lost control of their politi
cal destiny anyway and their
only hope lay in Muzorewa get
ting a deal from the British.
