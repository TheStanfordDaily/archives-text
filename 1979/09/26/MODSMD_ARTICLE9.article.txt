China with a study group or

young workers, most of whom
preferred to remain anonym

Tientsin and Shanghai.)

Shanghai — Mei-ling, a
young woman in northern
China, says she won't cut her
hair or "lie down with a man"
before she marries at age 26—
or older.
Custom dictates the
hairstyle. Chinese law and a
lack of privacy restrict her rela
tions with the opposite sex.
Mei-ling shares the hopes of
young people around
the world, but Chinese society
prescribes a different life style.
Sex is a telling example. In
the West, relations between
the sexes have seldom been
freer. In China today, they are
strictly monitored.
Young couples seeking a few
moments of privacy in the
parks of Shanghai — one of
China's most permissive cities
— are subjected to the
flashlights of local watchmen.
"If the couple are legitimate
loves," one older Chinese man
explained, "The authorities
generally leave them alone.
"But if they get carried away
or change partners too often
they crack down on them," he
said.
Even young married
couples, living in overcrowded
apartments with parents and
other relatives, seldom man
age to spend time alone.
Other concerns of young
people in the West — like find
ing a job — do not trouble
Mei-ling. She does not even
bother to look foremployment
because the Chinese state as
signs jobs to all its citizens.
Instead young people in
China worry about what job
they will get. Often they are as
signed lo jobs that do not suit
their qualifications.

One 24-year-old railway
worker in South China spent
several years studying at the
local railway institute, only to
be assigned to wait on passen
gers. She complained that she
was over qualified for her pre
sent job.
"If I don't get aggressive and
do something about it, this job
could be my whole life," she
said. But she conceded that it
would be impossible to do
something unless she "knew
someone."
Those who dislike their as
signed jobs or want to change
theiracademic major have little
recourse. Young people ques
tioned said there was "no
thing" they could do in such
situations — unless they had
connections.
"In job assignments, it's who
you know that counts," a
young man in Peking said.
A popular Chinese joke illus
trates the need for connections
in satisfactory job placement.
In the joke, a father has to
bribe a Party official several
times to guarantee that his
daughter will not be sent to
work in the countryside where
living standards are lower and
working conditions harder.
Chinese without connec
tions must use their ingenuity
to get ahead. One young man
unhappy with his job said that
to get transferred to another
one he purposely performed
his assignments badly.
"Of course," he said, "I ran
the risk of demotion rather
than assignment to a more
satisfactory job."
Finding a place to live, like
finding a job, poses no prob
lem to young Chinese if they
are not too choosy. The state
provides housing to all its citi
zens, charging an average rent
of five percent of the occup
ant's wages. Virtually no city
dwellers own their homes, so
mortgage payments don't
weigh on young people's
minds.
Most young people continue
to live with their families once
they start work ,ind even after
marriage.
