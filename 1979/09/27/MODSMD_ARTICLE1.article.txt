# USE officer says error shaped vote
## 
### John Boyle 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
members may have been deluded
into ratifying their new contract,
which was finalized with the Univer
sity Monday, according to union sec
retary David Walker.
Union officials had circulated
statistics regarding a proposed pen
sion plan which later proved inaccu
rate. Some union members includ
ing Walker, now contend that had
the figures been presented accu
rately, the contract vote would have
been much closer.
Teressa Ghilarducci, the
economist working with the USE
negotiating team, later claimed to
have committed a "pretty gross"
error in calculating the benefit in
crease of the plan.
That mistake, Walker said, may
have influenced the ratification vote
by overstating the plan's attractive
ness.
Following a fruitless meeting Sept.
17, USE members met the next day to
vote on the recently negotiated con
tract. Approximately 860 of the 1400
total members ap
proved the terms oi the new contract
in as9to 41 percent voice vote.
Walker contended that had the
correct data been supplied, the vote
would have been close to a 50-50
run-off. In particular, he said that the
older workers supported ratification
primarily on the strength of the inac
curate retirement plan figures.
"The leadership of the union
didn't properly monitor and control
the figures," Walker asserted.
Union rejection of the contract
would have forced negotiators to re
turn to the bargaining table to either
draft a more agreeable contract or
face an imminent strike.
The effectiveness of the Sept. 17
session was hampered by an unex
pectedly large and unruly crowd, ac
cording to union president. Mike
Harris. At one point, an unidentified
man disconnected Harris' mic-

rophone and proceeded to use
another loudspeaker to air his own
opinions.
The lack of roll sheets to identify
valid members and the absence of
ratification ballots further com
pounded the chaos of the debate.
The lack of ballots necessitated a
voice vote the next day.
The contract dispute began with
the expiration of the former USE con
tract at midnight, Aug. 31. Although
the University had requested a
one-month contract extension, USE
leaders accepted only a 10-day con
tinuation.
From midnight, Sept. 10, until the
signing of the contract Monday, USE
members worked without a binding
contract.
Over 600 union members voted in
favor of a strike if necessary at a meet
ing Sept. 6.
The contract negotiating team,
headed by General Manager David
Novogrodsky, viewed that vote of
confidence as "psychological clout"
to use advantageously in negotia
tions.
Ironically, the contract con
troversy culminated in a general
union meeting Tuesday night when
enraged USE members clamored for
the resignation of Novogrodsky and
staged a mass walk-out.
