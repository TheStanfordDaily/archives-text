members may have been deluded
into ratifying their new contract,
which was finalized with the Univer
sity Monday, according to union sec

Union officials had circulated
statistics regarding a proposed pen

been much closer.
Teressa Ghilarducci, the
economist working with the USE
negotiating team, later claimed to
have committed a "pretty gross"
error in calculating the benefit in

That mistake, Walker said, may
have influenced the ratification vote

Following a fruitless meeting Sept.
17, USE members met the next day to
vote on the recently negotiated con
tract. Approximately 860 of the 1400
total members ap

Walker contended that had the
correct data been supplied, the vote
would have been close to a 50-50
run-off. In particular, he said that the
older workers supported ratification
primarily on the strength of the inac

"The leadership of the union
didn't properly monitor and control
the figures," Walker asserted.

would have forced negotiators to re
turn to the bargaining table to either
draft a more agreeable contract or
face an imminent strike.

session was hampered by an unex

Harris. At one point, an unidentified
