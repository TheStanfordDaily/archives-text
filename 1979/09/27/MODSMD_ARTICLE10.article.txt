## Stabilize rents in Palo Alto 
### 
Every fall, students returning to Stanford are
faced with the same problem. Rental vacancy
rates in Palo Alto and surrounding communities
are virtually zero, and any housing that can be
found is being offered at rents that are both
unjustified and unconscionable.
Rent increases in the past year have been
higher than even the exorbitant increases of
previous years, as landlords have increased rent
in anticipation of the passage of rent stabiliza
tion ordinances.
As a result of this crisis in rental housing, the
Palo Alto FHuman Relations Commission has
scheduled a hearing on the cost of rental hous
ing for tonight at 7:30 in the Palo Alto City Coun
cil chambers.
Students and staft who rent in Palo Alto have a
special responsibility to attend the hearing.
About 2300 Stanford students and 170 faculty
and staff live in Palo Alto.
More housing needed
The obvious solution to the housing problem is
to build more housing at affordable prices.
There are two obstacles to this solution â€” the
University and Palo Alto. Stanford has the vacant
land on which it can build housing, but it has
been unwilling to build even enough housing
tor its student population. Palo Alto wants to
maintain its current low residential densities,
where two out of every three homes is a single
family detached house.
Rent stabilization
Rent stabilization is the only way to help solve
the crisis in residential rents in the foreseeable
future. Palo Altoans for Affordable Housing and
other groups will be discussing this solution at
tonight's hearing.
Any rent stabilization ordinance needs to
have three main provisions: a method for cal
culating rents in general and for particular units;
a way to determine which units should be
excluded from the ordinance; and a mechanism

for administering the ordinance.
Rents can be set by allowing a general annual
percentage increase starting with the rent on a
particular date. Many people think |une 1, 1978
should be the starting date, because on |une 6,
1978, when Proposition 13 was passed, tenants
did not receive their share of the resulting prop
erty tax savings, and landlords began increasing
rents in anticipation of rent stabilization ordi
nances.
In addition to any general increase, landlords
and tenants need the right to ask for upward or
downward rent adjustments to fit their particu
lar case. For example, there is no reason that a
tenant should pay the typical rent increase
which includes maintenance costs, if his or her
landlord doesn't maintain the rental property in
proper condition.
Excluded units
A key question to resolve in any rent stabiliza
tion ordinance is whether single-family dwel
lings should be covered. Some students rent
rooms in owner-occupied houses, while others
rent entire houses. For the past 30 years, about
20 percent of Palo Alto's single-family houses
have been used as rental units. Today, over 30
percent of the rental units in Palo Alto are
houses, with the remainder being apartments or
condominiums.
A rental housing board can be established to
administer the ordinance. I believe the board
should be an elected one, although others be
lieve the City Council should appoint the board,
possibly from a restricted list.
Tonight's hearing will also consider other
tenant-related issues, such as age discrimina
tion in housing, just cause eviction provisions,
and anti-speculation measures. The best way to
get these issues aired is for as many people as
possible to participate in the hearing.
