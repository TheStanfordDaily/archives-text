## Oversleep, avoid early classes 
### 
In preparation for submit
ting class lists for Fall quarter,
Dr. B. Remming, Director of
the Center for Holistic Sleep,
spoke last night in the first of
two lectures on the art of over
sleeping, saying that students
today are foregoing one of
man's simplest and most
time-honored pleasures —
oversleeping.
Remming, a distinguished
sleep researcher whose previ
ous work dealt with obfuscat
ing the monoaminergic theory
of louvet, was invited by the
Stanford Committee to Im
prove Student Life to discuss
his current research and his
new book, The loy of Over
sleeping. Remming said, "Stu
dents at prestigious American
universities today have be
come so tense and nervous
that it has been years since I've
seen anvone asleeD in class."
At his center, the original
pilot studies were targeted at
methods of relieving tension,
fears and inhibitions, thereby
permitting students to reduce
their artificial repressions and
naturally fall asleep in class.
Unfortunately, the success of
his initial results forced the

Dept. of Health, Education and
Welfare to terminate funding
prematurely.
As a result, Dr. Remming de
cided to develop preventive
techniques for falling asleep in
class. Having now completed
analysis of 7000 oversleeping
surveys, hundreds of indi
vidual interviews and dozens
of oversleeping clinics, Dr.
Remming has a number of
practical suggestions tor cop
ing with the stress of attending
morning classes and for chang
ing one's behavior.
Specifically, Dr. Remming
suggested students register for
8 a.m. or 9 a.m. classes.
For optimal results, he recom
mends large lecture format
classes where students can be
absent and be assured of a
wide variety of friends from
whom to obtain quality notes.
In addition, Dr. Remming em
phasized the scheduling of the
hour after class as open time.
His survey found that 68 per
cent of the students expressed
increased satisfaction with
oversleeping when they were
also free to sleep the hour fol
lowing the class.
Although some of the vari

ables influencing the selection
of classes such as size, interest
level, number of exams, and
subjec I matter have been de
lineated, Dr. Remming says fu
ture research should signific
antly clarify the relative impor
tance of each variable.
Finally, Dr. Remming
explained his simple, four-step
method for extracting the full
joy of oversleeping. The first
step is merely to stay up un
necessarily late, preferably
working, since this favors
rationalizations in the morn
ing. Second, tell several
classmates, retiring early, (who
won't come knocking on your
door the next morning) that
you have an eight or 9
o'clock class. This increases
the visibility of your oversleep
ing. Alternatively, in the event
of going to class, one now has
earned several martyr points
for staying up late and still at- :
tending class. Third, one
should only decide whether to
go to class the next morning,
thus leaving the final decision
to your visceral instincts (guilt
has been found counter
productive in inducing sleep).
Fourth, one should get two

alarms, one a radio alarm and
another of the more relentless,
buzzer variety. The radio alarm
is set ten minutes earlier than
the buzzer alarm, which is set
for the usual awakening time.
Dr. Remming describes the
consequences of his method
saying, "The next morning the
music alarm goes off, and the
student has ten minutes to dis
cover that she's exhausted and
doesn't need to attend class.
Then,she turns off both alarms
and enjoys the morning being
inwardly creative — oversleep
ing."
Dr. Remming's methods
have already brought a new
sense of meaning to the lives of
hundreds of students who
formerly suffered the pangs of
deciding whether to attend a
morning class. To facilitate the
mastery of his techniques, Dr.
Remming is giving a second
lecture entitled, "Oversleep
ing: APracticum." All students
are urged to attend this work
shop on oversleeping
techniques to be held in Din
kelspiel auditorium, Sep
tember 28 at 6 a.m.

techniques for falling asleep in
class. Having now completed
analysis of 7000 oversleeping
surveys, hundreds of indi
vidual interviews and dozens
of oversleeping clinics, Dr.
Remming has a number of
practical suggestions tor cop
ing with the stress of attending
morning classes and for chang
ing one's behavior.
Specifically, Dr. Remming
suggested students register for
8 a.m. or 9 a.m. classes.
For optimal results, he recom
mends large lecture format
classes where students can be
absent and be assured of a
wide variety of friends from
whom to obtain quality notes.
In addition, Dr. Remming em
phasized the scheduling of the
hour after class as open time.
His survey found that 68 per
cent of the students expressed
increased satisfaction with
oversleeping when they were
also free to sleep the hour fol
lowing the class.
Although some of the vari

ables influencing the selection
of classes such as size, interest
level, number of exams, and
subjec I matter have been de
lineated, Dr. Remming says fu
ture research should signific
antly clarify the relative impor
tance of each variable.
Finally, Dr. Remming
explained his simple, four-step
method for extracting the full
joy of oversleeping. The first
step is merely to stay up un
necessarily late, preferably
working, since this favors
rationalizations in the morn
ing. Second, tell several
classmates, retiring early, (who
won't come knocking on your
door the next morning) that
you have an eight or 9
o'clock class. This increases
the visibility of your oversleep
ing. Alternatively, in the event
of going to class, one now has
earned several martyr points
for staying up late and still at- :
tending class. Third, one
should only decide whether to
go to class the next morning,
thus leaving the final decision
to your visceral instincts (guilt
has been found counter
productive in inducing sleep).
Fourth, one should get two

alarms, one a radio alarm and
another of the more relentless,
buzzer variety. The radio alarm
is set ten minutes earlier than
the buzzer alarm, which is set
for the usual awakening time.
Dr. Remming describes the
consequences of his method
saying, "The next morning the
music alarm goes off, and the
student has ten minutes to dis
cover that she's exhausted and
doesn't need to attend class.
Then,she turns off both alarms
and enjoys the morning being
inwardly creative — oversleep
ing."
Dr. Remming's methods
have already brought a new
sense of meaning to the lives of
hundreds of students who
formerly suffered the pangs of
deciding whether to attend a
morning class. To facilitate the
mastery of his techniques, Dr.
Remming is giving a second
lecture entitled, "Oversleep
ing: APracticum." All students
are urged to attend this work

In preparation for submit
ting class lists for Fall quarter,
Dr. B. Remming, Director of
the Center for Holistic Sleep,
spoke last night in the first of
two lectures on the art of over
sleeping, saying that students
today are foregoing one of
man's simplest and most
time-honored pleasures —
oversleeping.
Remming, a distinguished
sleep researcher whose previ
ous work dealt with obfuscat
ing the monoaminergic theory
of louvet, was invited by the
Stanford Committee to Im
prove Student Life to discuss
his current research and his
new book, The loy of Over
sleeping. Remming said, "Stu
dents at prestigious American
universities today have be
come so tense and nervous
that it has been years since I've
seen anvone asleeD in class."
At his center, the original
pilot studies were targeted at
methods of relieving tension,
fears and inhibitions, thereby
permitting students to reduce
their artificial repressions and
naturally fall asleep in class.
Unfortunately, the success of
his initial results forced the

Dept. of Health, Education and
Welfare to terminate funding
prematurely.
As a result, Dr. Remming de
cided to develop preventive
techniques for falling asleep in
class. Having now completed
analysis of 7000 oversleeping
surveys, hundreds of indi
vidual interviews and dozens
of oversleeping clinics, Dr.
Remming has a number of
