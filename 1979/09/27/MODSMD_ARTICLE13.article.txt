## Jim Isaacs Journalists misrepresent Carter 
### 
President )immy Carter has
the lowest political acceptabil
ity rating of any president since
the Korean War. Labeled a
"lame duck" and a "one-term"
president, Carter has a re
duced power base from which
he can confront global issues.
If Cartels image were en
tirely based on inept executive
actions, it would be under
standable and justified. This,
however, is not the case. His
negative public image is at least
partly a result of the present
journalistic climate.
Viewed in light of the Nixon
and Ford presidencies, the at
tacks on Carter appear to be
part of an emerging pattern of
excessive investigative jour
nalism. Apparently any holder
of the office would be
maligned.
President Nixon's fall from
power was the great victory
and achievement of the mod
ern press. Unfortunately, the
justifiable popularity of the in
vestigative reporter has led to a
cynical and derisive handling
of Nixon's successors.
Under the presidency of

Gerald Ford, the media raised
legitimate questions concern
ing Ford's ability to provide
dynamic leadership. This is ac
ceptable. What was unfortu
nate was the ridiculous over
play of his supposed lack of
coordination.
Ford was portrayed bumping
his head into airplane doors,
falling off his skis, slicing tee
shots into galleries, etc., etc.,
ad infinitum.
Of course everyone slips,
falls and blunders, but Ford was
quickly surrounded by photo
graphers waiting for a buf
foonish incident to report. The
President of the United States
became a target of mockery on
issues completely unrelated to
his performance in office.
President Carter has fared
even worse. The press is trying
to portray him as an almost
comical captain of a sinking
presidency.
The boring and boorish an
tics of his family are never left
unpublished. Billy Carter's ob
noxious comments and associ

ations would not be a national
disgrace if we didn't pay any
attention to him. The coverage
created the problem.
Similarly, the private lives of
Carter's aides are overplayed.
When a desperate accused
man implicated White House
Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan
in drug charges without any
shred of evidence, it was a hot
story for weeks. Anything that
makes Carter look weak makes
headlines.
While I understand that Ham
Jordan and Billy Carter are
amusing, a serious issue arises
â€” is the press reporting a
phenomenon (the breakup of a
presidency) or creating it?
Which is its legitimate and crit
ical function in our democ
racy?
While it is possible that the
image of disaster serves to
symbolize extant incompe
tence, it is likely that a good
deal of Carter's inability to lead
is due to the preconception we
now have of his ability to deal
with any problem.

We do not need and cannot
afford any directional censor
ship of the press. Rather, I
would plead for a responsible
introspection by the members
of the news media. If jour
nalists continue to concentrate
on insignificant, derogatory
stories, we will create a society
in which the president is a
media man even in office.
Do we want a man who is
pleasing to the National En
quirer? Will we call on a good
leader or a flashy but insub
stantial entertainer?
I am bored with Billy, Amy,
the killer rabbit, Studio 54
cocaine, riverboat cruises and
Carter's cousins.
The year 1980 is approaching
with health care, OPEC,
NATO's weakness and the
economy receiving less atten
tion than they should. It is time
to lay off Carter and talk about
the issues. Then, we will get a
more accurate view of his fit
ness for office.
