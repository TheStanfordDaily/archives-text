Kennedy unqualified
I was appalled to read David
Sartoris' politically naive col
umn, American People Need
Kennedy (Daily, Sept. 25).
While Sartoris would have me
believe that Kennedy is the
American messiah, he fails to
construct a coherent argument
to this effect.
Sartoris praises Kennedy for
not having declared his candi
dacy, yet there is a distinct dif
ference between not declaring
candidacy and not intending
to. Kennedy intends to.
Moreover, where was Sartoris
when the Kennedys invited
the American public into their
home on national television —
showing us that loan has con
quered her drinking problem,
that Teddy makes time for the
kids and that the family no
longer objects to Teddy's can
didacy?
Surely, one need not be too
perceptive to see that Kennedy
is promoting himself without
forcing a rift in the Democratic
Party. This is not noble, it is
self-serving.
Furthermore, Sartoris im
plies that while every other
presidential candidate is galav
anting across the country,
Kennedy remains hard at work.
Contrary to this suggestion,
while Carter was "steamboat
ing down the Mississippi,"
Kennedy was dropping "Ken
nedy in 1980" buttons at na
tional airports.
Sartoris also misinterpreted
the need for a hero in America.
We do need a hero — a real
hero — not a brother of a hero,
or a media hero.
Kennedy has repeatedly
shown himself to be a spine
less, surface, unimaginative
media politician. He has not
yet, to my knowledge, created
a single piece of significant, un
ique legislation. In fact, his
only purpose in the Senate
seems to be introducing bills
for less popular or less power

ful statesmen.
Moreover, the only reason
that Sartoris has given us to
elect Kennedy is the immense
popularity of this rather
mediocre statesman —a popu
larity built from American
folklore, the public's desire to
return to JFK and the booming
early '60s, and the uninformed
enthusiasm of a desperate
America. If popularity was the
sole criterion, then what hap
pened to our immensely popu
lar Carter?
At this point in American his
tory, I can think of few things
worse than Kennedy in '80! In
addition to his media morals

and political spinelessness,
which is the only restraint on
his rise to the presidential of
fice, Kennedy's economic po.
icy could not answer the rising
tide of inflation; in fact, it
could only bolster the crippl
ing of our economy.
Kennedy's cavalier attitudes
could only lead us into a chasm
of hopeless liberalism. Indeed,
the time has come for Ameri
can politics to turn from the
popular candidate and move to
the qualified one. Under these
criteria, Kennedy cannot be
considered a candidate in 1980.
