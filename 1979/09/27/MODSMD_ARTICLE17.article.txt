# Southsiders are moving in
## 
### 
Singing and dancing.
Singing and dancing are the
two things that a Southside
Johnny concert is noted for.
People may find it hard not to
clap their hands and shout
along with the catchy and soul
ful choruses of Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes'
unique music. Audiences in
the East have known for years

that the Jukes play to please,
with an upbeat mixture of
rhythm and blues, and rock
and roll.
At a concert in late July, in
Central Park in New York City,
more than 5000 people jam
med a hill beside a stadium just
to listen to Southside and the
Jukes play. The stadium had
been sold out forweeks. Butas
the night rode on, even more
people gathered on the hill
side, and most were singing
and dancing.
It couldn't be helped.
The Jukes are a Jersey band
with universal appeal. Survival
on the East Coast bar circuit
dictated a need for two things:
energetic musicianship and
enthusiastic showmanship.
Hot on the trail of friend and
sometimes co-writer Bruce
Springsteen, Southside and
the Jukes learned to give a
first-rate performance.
Those 5000 people on the
hillside in NYC couldn't be
wrong.
Southside Johnny Lyon's
voice sounds hard and hurt on
the blues numbers, but his
tone and demeanor are often
light-hearted, if not mildly sar
castic, on the faster songs. His
almost-a-tough-guy charm and
dry wit fit well with the songs,
which speak of getting hurt,
getting over, or getting outs He
jokes frequently with the audi
ence, occasionally at the ex
pense of the image of one of
his fellow band members.
Southside has fun, but the au
dience has more.
Adding an extra flavor to the
band's personality are the
Miami Horns, a rowdy brass
section known for their
onstage antics. Their instru

mental interludes range from
Dixieland stomp to inspired
solos, and they never stop
moving.
Getting started
The Jukes began their re
cording career in 1976 with the
release of their first album, I
Don't Want To Co Home. The
band had a large cult following
even before the album was re
leased, and steady creative
support from Springsteen and
Steve Van Zandt. With the re
lease of This Time It's For Real,
the band's second album, they
found themselves on national
television, and their third ef
fort, Hearts of Stone, received
a lot of airplay and much criti
cal acclaim. But their fourth al
bum, The lukes, promises to be
the springboard to stardom.
The album, on Mercury Re
cords, is a blistering set of origi
nal material. Guitarist Billy Rush,
bassist Doc Berger and South
side Johnny composed the
songs, a first on a Jukes album
and an optimistically fresh start.
The album is produced by Barry
Beckett, who most recently pro
duced albums for Bob Dylan and
Dire Straits.

Southside johnny and the Asbury
jukes will play at a "Back to
School" rock concert at 8 p.m.
Friday in Memorial Auditorium.
Tickets are available at Tresidder
and other major outlets.

On the line
While the focus of sound is
similar to that of the first three
records, the Jukes are planting
themselves firmly in their

brand of rock and roll. The feel
ing is that the album is more
personal and professional;
they have managed to accu
rately capture on vinyl the ex
citement that their live con
cert always generated. The
originality of their music has
never been denied, but the
exploration and experimenta
tion of their first three albums
is over. With The lukes, they
have found their sound and
aim to keep it.
Southside Johnny and The
Asbury Jukes will be playing at
Stanford on Friday. It is not a
concert a dancer would want to
miss.

pense of the image of one of
his fellow band members.
Southside has fun, but the au
dience has more.
Adding an extra flavor to the
band's personality are the
Miami Horns, a rowdy brass
section known for their
onstage antics. Their instru

mental interludes range from
Dixieland stomp to inspired
solos, and they never stop
moving.
Getting started
The Jukes began their re
cording career in 1976 with the
release of their first album, I
Don't Want To Co Home. The
band had a large cult following
even before the album was re
leased, and steady creative
support from Springsteen and
Steve Van Zandt. With the re
lease of This Time It's For Real,
the band's second album, they
found themselves on national
television, and their third ef
fort, Hearts of Stone, received
a lot of airplay and much criti
cal acclaim. But their fourth al
bum, The lukes, promises to be
the springboard to stardom.
The album, on Mercury Re
cords, is a blistering set of origi
nal material. Guitarist Billy Rush,
bassist Doc Berger and South
side Johnny composed the
songs, a first on a Jukes album
and an optimistically fresh start.
The album is produced by Barry
Beckett, who most recently pro
duced albums for Bob Dylan and
Dire Straits.

Southside johnny and the Asbury
jukes will play at a "Back to
School" rock concert at 8 p.m.
Friday in Memorial Auditorium.
Tickets are available at Tresidder
and other major outlets.

On the line
While the focus of sound is
similar to that of the first three
records, the Jukes are planting
themselves firmly in their

brand of rock and roll. The feel
ing is that the album is more
personal and professional;
they have managed to accu
rately capture on vinyl the ex
citement that their live con
cert always generated. The
originality of their music has
never been denied, but the
exploration and experimenta
tion of their first three albums
is over. With The lukes, they
have found their sound and
aim to keep it.
Southside Johnny and The
Asbury Jukes will be playing at
Stanford on Friday. It is not a
concert a dancer would want to
miss.

Singing and dancing.
Singing and dancing are the
two things that a Southside
Johnny concert is noted for.
People may find it hard not to
clap their hands and shout
along with the catchy and soul
ful choruses of Southside
Johnny and the Asbury Jukes'
unique music. Audiences in
the East have known for years

that the Jukes play to please,
with an upbeat mixture of
rhythm and blues, and rock
and roll.
At a concert in late July, in
Central Park in New York City,
more than 5000 people jam
med a hill beside a stadium just
to listen to Southside and the
Jukes play. The stadium had
been sold out forweeks. Butas
the night rode on, even more
people gathered on the hill
side, and most were singing
and dancing.
It couldn't be helped.
The Jukes are a Jersey band
with universal appeal. Survival
on the East Coast bar circuit
dictated a need for two things:
energetic musicianship and
enthusiastic showmanship.
Hot on the trail of friend and
sometimes co-writer Bruce
Springsteen, Southside and
the Jukes learned to give a
first-rate performance.
Those 5000 people on the
hillside in NYC couldn't be
wrong.
Southside Johnny Lyon's
voice sounds hard and hurt on
the blues numbers, but his
tone and demeanor are often
light-hearted, if not mildly sar
castic, on the faster songs. His
almost-a-tough-guy charm and
dry wit fit well with the songs,
which speak of getting hurt,
getting over, or getting outs He
jokes frequently with the audi
ence, occasionally at the ex
pense of the image of one of
his fellow band members.
Southside has fun, but the au
dience has more.

section known for their
