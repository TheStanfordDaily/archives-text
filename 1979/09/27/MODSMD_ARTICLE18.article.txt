A shortage of Shakespeare
outside of the classroom is one
reason why The Company will
present The Comedy of Errors
this quarter, according to di
rector Marilu Magana.
"A lot of people here love
Shakespeare, but they confine
it to classes like (English) 173,"
she said. "The only people
who put it on are the Drama
Department, and they don't do
it every year."

Auditions for Comedy of Errors
will lx> held 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.
Friday, 1 to 3 p.m. Sunday and
7:30 to 9:30 p.m. Monday in the
Rinconada dining hall. The show
will run Nov. Bto 10 at an unde
termined location.

"The Company used to be
known for 'doing Shakes
peare," added lane Rozga, the
group's technical manager.
"We'd like to revive that tradi
tion, even though, in the past
couple of years when we've
started up again, we've done
mainly musicals."
Magana said she chose
Comedy of Errors because it's
"perfect to cast at Stanford,
because you can cast it with
college-aged people and make
it convincing."
Besides, it's "pure
fun...There's nothing intellec
tual about this play. It's, well, I
don't want to call it slapstick.
And I don't want to call it
farce...lt's just scene after
scene of crazy happenings."
The Company production
will be fast-paced and staged
without an intermission,
Magana said, because "any
interruption would ruin the
timing, the way everything
happens right on top of each
other."
She said she is setting the
play in Roaring Twenties'
America.
The verbal and physical ac
robatics of two sets of twins
and their bewildered families
"double the fun and double
the mistakes" enough to stand
up to the period change, she
insisted.
