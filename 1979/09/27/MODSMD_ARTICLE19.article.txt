In Through the Out Door
Led Zeppelin
Swan Song
In Through the Out Door
isn't a bad record, but it's an
utterly unconvincing one. In its
first studio effort in three
years, what Zeppelin has left
behind is far more important
than anything that it's added.
This band's strongest quality
— and it isn't a small one —
always has been its ability to
give its studio work the raw,
blistering excitement of a live
show. The force and power are
what you instantly respond to,
and the sheer dimensions of
this force and power almost
overwhelm this four-man
band's most obvious faults,
both in its lyrics and in its in
consistent and limited rhythm
section. And when lead
guitarist jimmy Page roared to
some new heights, Led Zeppe
lin's weaknesses became to
tally unimportant.
Truly great
Page, a truly great guitarist,
also has proven himself to be
an innovative as well as a ver
satile producer with a sharp,
instinctive feel. Page's mastery
of Eastern and blues idioms al
lowed much of Zeppelin's
work to move easily within an
essentially heavy metal
framework and yet not be li
mited by it; the band has been
successful even in some of its
quietest moments. At its best,
Zeppelin's work evoked an al
most hokey, yet somehow
mystical grandeur that pro
vided some of the greatest
moments in heavy metal

music.
Grandeur, power and con
viction are largely missing ele
ments on Out Door. One
reason for this is that Page's
usually dominant role has been
diminished. Zeppelin appa
rently has attempted to achieve
some degree of creative equal
ity among its members (drum
mer )ohn Bonham seems to
have been left out of this, how
ever).
Diversity
The band also tries to work in
a diversity of unfamiliar musi
cal styles, including calypso
and rockabilly. Such an ap
proach, when combined with
the necessarily increased de
pendence on bassist/
keyboardist (ohn Paul lones
and vocalist Robert Plant, only
indicates that the only consis
tently competent musical force
in Led Zeppelin is |immy Page.
The album starts off with "In
the Evening," a standard riff
rocker that's done almost as a
concession; the band doesn't
seem to be too interested. The
pounding rhythm may get the
kids off for awhile, but it won't
fool Zeppelin's old fans too
long — the lack of energy is
embarrassingly apparent.
Page contributes a searing
solo with a break reminiscent
of his classic solo in "Com
munication Breakdown'' from
Zeppelin's first album, re
corded in 1968. But Plant's
vocal never gets going; it's al
most amateurishly recorded.
Mindless
On the album's longest

song, the 10-minute
"Carouselambra," Plant's
abilities as a vocal instrument
once again are buried in a poor
mix; the song never rises
above an empty exercise in
mindless keyboard playing.
"Fool in the Rain" and "Hot
Dog," calypso and rockabilly
numbers, respectively, are
both competently done, but
the arrangements are so unim
aginative that you're sure
you've heard these "original"
numbers a thousand times be
fore — and somebody else did
them better. Bonham simply
sounds lost; he's obviously
unsure of himself in any other
form than heavy metal.
Only the album's last two
songs offer any highlights. "All
My Love" is an almost incon
gruous number for Zeppelin; a
tender, sweet-sounding love
ballad. But Jones carries off the
simply symphonic touches
rather nicely, and Page throws
in soaring guitar fills. Plant's
vocal is surprisingly full and
mature; it's one of the few
moments on Out Door that in
dicate that anyone in Led Zep
pelin has changed that much in
three years.

Hope?
But it's the album's final
song, "I'm Gonna Crawl," that
truly gives you hope for Zeppe
lin in the future. A perfectly
realized blues number,
"Crawl" reaffirms Page's status
as a master blues guitarist, and
Plant's vocal is so good that you
may think for one glorious
moment that he might have re
gained the vocal talents he had
as little as four years ago.
But four years have de
cidedly taken their toll on Led
Zeppelin. They've always been
a band with elitist pretensions;
through much of their history,
they've been able to live up to
the claims they've staked for
themselves. After ]975'sPhysi
cal Graffiti, Zeppelin, despite
the whimpers from followers
of the Rolling Stones, was
probably the reigning rock
band in the world.
The indifference of Out
Door can only accelerate Zep
pelin's fall from that height;
but songs like "I'm Gonna
Crawl'' serve notice that there
still might be a few knockout
punches left in this band of
aging survivors.

band's most obvious faults,
both in its lyrics and in its in
consistent and limited rhythm
section. And when lead
guitarist jimmy Page roared to
some new heights, Led Zeppe
lin's weaknesses became to
tally unimportant.
Truly great
Page, a truly great guitarist,
also has proven himself to be
an innovative as well as a ver
satile producer with a sharp,
instinctive feel. Page's mastery
of Eastern and blues idioms al
lowed much of Zeppelin's
work to move easily within an
essentially heavy metal
framework and yet not be li
mited by it; the band has been
successful even in some of its
quietest moments. At its best,
Zeppelin's work evoked an al
most hokey, yet somehow
mystical grandeur that pro
vided some of the greatest
moments in heavy metal

music.
Grandeur, power and con
viction are largely missing ele
ments on Out Door. One
reason for this is that Page's
usually dominant role has been
diminished. Zeppelin appa
rently has attempted to achieve
some degree of creative equal
ity among its members (drum
mer )ohn Bonham seems to
have been left out of this, how
ever).
Diversity
The band also tries to work in
a diversity of unfamiliar musi
cal styles, including calypso
and rockabilly. Such an ap
proach, when combined with
the necessarily increased de
pendence on bassist/
keyboardist (ohn Paul lones
and vocalist Robert Plant, only
indicates that the only consis
tently competent musical force
in Led Zeppelin is |immy Page.
The album starts off with "In
the Evening," a standard riff
rocker that's done almost as a
concession; the band doesn't
seem to be too interested. The
pounding rhythm may get the
kids off for awhile, but it won't
fool Zeppelin's old fans too
long — the lack of energy is
embarrassingly apparent.
Page contributes a searing
solo with a break reminiscent
of his classic solo in "Com
munication Breakdown'' from
Zeppelin's first album, re
corded in 1968. But Plant's
vocal never gets going; it's al
most amateurishly recorded.
Mindless
On the album's longest

song, the 10-minute
"Carouselambra," Plant's
abilities as a vocal instrument
once again are buried in a poor
mix; the song never rises
above an empty exercise in
mindless keyboard playing.
"Fool in the Rain" and "Hot
Dog," calypso and rockabilly
numbers, respectively, are
both competently done, but
the arrangements are so unim
aginative that you're sure
you've heard these "original"
numbers a thousand times be
fore — and somebody else did
them better. Bonham simply
sounds lost; he's obviously
unsure of himself in any other
form than heavy metal.
Only the album's last two
songs offer any highlights. "All
My Love" is an almost incon
gruous number for Zeppelin; a
tender, sweet-sounding love
ballad. But Jones carries off the
simply symphonic touches
rather nicely, and Page throws
in soaring guitar fills. Plant's
vocal is surprisingly full and
mature; it's one of the few
moments on Out Door that in
dicate that anyone in Led Zep
pelin has changed that much in
three years.

Hope?
But it's the album's final
song, "I'm Gonna Crawl," that
truly gives you hope for Zeppe
lin in the future. A perfectly
realized blues number,
"Crawl" reaffirms Page's status
as a master blues guitarist, and
Plant's vocal is so good that you
may think for one glorious
moment that he might have re
gained the vocal talents he had
as little as four years ago.
But four years have de
cidedly taken their toll on Led
Zeppelin. They've always been
a band with elitist pretensions;
through much of their history,
they've been able to live up to
the claims they've staked for
themselves. After ]975'sPhysi
cal Graffiti, Zeppelin, despite
the whimpers from followers
of the Rolling Stones, was
probably the reigning rock
band in the world.
The indifference of Out
Door can only accelerate Zep
pelin's fall from that height;
but songs like "I'm Gonna
Crawl'' serve notice that there
still might be a few knockout
punches left in this band of
aging survivors.

In Through the Out Door
Led Zeppelin
Swan Song
In Through the Out Door
isn't a bad record, but it's an
utterly unconvincing one. In its
first studio effort in three
years, what Zeppelin has left
behind is far more important
than anything that it's added.
This band's strongest quality
— and it isn't a small one —
always has been its ability to
give its studio work the raw,
blistering excitement of a live
show. The force and power are
what you instantly respond to,
and the sheer dimensions of
this force and power almost
overwhelm this four-man
band's most obvious faults,
both in its lyrics and in its in
consistent and limited rhythm
section. And when lead
