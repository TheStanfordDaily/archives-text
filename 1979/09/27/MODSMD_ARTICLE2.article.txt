# South bay sewage mishap
## Spill damage 'reversible' 
### 
San lose (AP) â€” The manager of a
treatment plant near here, which has
spewed more than a billion gallons of
partly treated sewage into San Fran
cisco Bay in the past four weeks, says
the damage can be reversed in 60 to
90 days-.
Meanwhile, the pollution assault
on San Francisco Bay came from a
new direction yesterday, as tons of
sewage poured from a source miles
away from the massive south bay
spill, which continued at a reduced
rate.
Time frame disputed
The new spill, in the Suisun Bay
tributary, as well as an ocean dump
ing at nearby Bolinas Lagoon, occur
red as the manager of the San Jose
treatment plant disputed a state Fish
and Game Department estimate that
it could take 10 years for south bay
wildlife to recover from the three
week, billion gallon-plus dumping.
"The beauty of the bay will be re
stored" within three months, plant
manager Frank Belick told the San
Jose City Council Tuesday.

Belick has been under fire tor an
admitted failure to report the plant
malfunction for nine days.
Mayor shocked
San Jose Mayor Janet Cray Hayes
told the council she felt as if "hit be
tween the eyes by a two-by-four"
when she finally heard about the big
spill.
The south bay disaster was re
ported by state and regional pollu
tion officials as having destroyed all
the fish and shrimp beds in the
southern end of the bay, and it posed
a botulism threat to birds that eat the
contaminated creatures or drink the
water.
The south bay spill had been foul
ing the bay at a rate of 50 million
gallons daily, but yesterday it was re
ported down to 20 million gallons a
day. The plant was reported showing
"significant improvement" at the
facility, which serves a million per
sons. Concern growing
The new spill caused a virtual brac
keting of San Francisco and the cent
ral bay and underscored concerns

over possible pollution of main
stretches of bay waters east of the
Golden Gate and west of the
Oakland-San Francisco Bay bridges.
In new incidents, an estimated 40
million gallons of partially treated
sewage spewed into bay and ocean
waters from Marin and Contra Costa
county plants yesterday, one of the
spills blamed on a shattering boiler
room explosion.
The explosion happened in the
central Contra Costa County treat
ment plant at Martinez, on the
northeast arm of the bay about 30
miles from San Francisco.
Fire officials said escaping natural
gas ignited, knocking out a concrete
wall about 50 feet high and 75 feet
wide. No one was hurt and a fire was
doused in minutes, but damage, es
timated at $150,000, hampered
equipment that services secondary
treatment of sewage.
Sanitary district general manager
Roger Dolan said he expected nor
mal operations to be restored this
week.
