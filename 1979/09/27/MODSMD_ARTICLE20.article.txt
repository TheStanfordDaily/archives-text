# 'We're not a bunch of mid-Victorians'
## Savoyards trying to break the mold 
### 
"We're not a bunch of mid-
Victorians."
Producer Rita Taylor's denial
was made in jest, but for the
Savoyards, it's not all |oke. De
spite a rich six years of comic
operetta, this campus theater
company has had trouble at
tracting students, because of
its reputation as an old
fashioned group dedicated to
a dusty cause — performing
Gilbert and Sullivan.
"It's harder and harder to get
students interested," Taylor
admitted. "Many either don't
know Gilbert and Sullivan or
else they think we're 'too pro
fessional' for them."
She said the group was
oriented more toward those
above college age: University
staff and alumni and local resi
dents. "But we'd love to make
it student-oriented. We just
don't know how to get people
interested.
"Face it," she said. "It you
don't like Gilbert and Sullivan,
you won't like us."
Other problems are the no
credit, no-money conditions

and competition from other
campus groups, especially
Ram's Head.
That's all a little ironic, be
cause the Savoyards say one
major goal is to offer student
opportunities to perform in
and to direct major musical
productions.
"The Drama Department has
lots of projects for its students,
but someone told me under
graduates didn't get that many
shows to direct," Taylor
explained.
"But we make it a point of
our shows to always have stu
dents as directors and music
directors. We'd like to get
more to design and , eventu
ally, to have a student pro
ducer.
We've established a scholar
ship to be given to the most
deserving performing under
graduate music student."
Many from the Music De
partment do take advantage of
these opportunities, Taylor
said, but not as many as people
usually believe. "Everyone
thinks our standards are too

high, and that no one could
sing in our shows without vocal
lessons.
"We have lots of music stu
dents...especially in our or
chestra and as our music direc
tors, but there are plenty of
openings for anyone who can
come in and sing well."
That applies not just to stu
dents.
Taylor said faculty and ad
ministrators have taken their
turns on the Savoyard stage,
including 1975 cameo appear
ances by President Richard
Lyman, History Prof. Otis
Pease and others \r\Ruddigore.
Aeronautics Prof. )ohn
Breakwell is a Savoyard regu
lar, having held leads in several
shows. Religious Studies Prof.
Ted Good is an accompanist
and sings in the chorus.
Offstage, faculty and their
families have provided what
Taylor called "invaluable ser
vices."
University Academic Secret
ary Eric Hutchinson designed
programs, while his wife has
silk-screened the kimonos
which will be used in this fall's
The Mikado.
"My husband figured that if
we had paid all these people
professional rates, we'd be
talking the kind of money
needed for a Broadway show,"
Taylor pointed out. .•
That all-for-one spirit helped
the Savoyards in their fledgling
days. In 1973, University
graduate student Mason
Blacher and several Cornell
University transfers started the
group. Blacher, according to
Taylor, pulled the Savoyards
through their premiere, Pirates
of Penzance, and several other
shows, with his organizational
ability.
In the early shows, Taylor
said, faculty wives sewed cos
tumes, many fashioned from
sheets. The Savoyards bought

an old Memorial Auditorium
curtain for $1.05 and still use it
to ring down their shows.
The third show, lolanthe,
marked the arrival of the
Savoyards, Taylor said. H.M.S.
Pinafore, in 1974, was the first
of the "spend a million" pro
ductions that brought a peak in
student involvement, with au
ditions swelling to 100 applic
ants in the best year.
That has trailed off and
group membership has shifted
strongly toward older, veteran
Savoyards, Taylor said.
We have many people who
graduate and just stay with us
but that discourages new
people, especially students.
The Savoyards demand de
dication and discipline. The
singing roles are more difficult
than musical comedy, Taylor
explained, and the structuring
is more rigid. Yet, she said
anyone who could handle The
Music Man "could take a
whack at this."
If students in the company
are few, those in the audience
are even fewer. Ram's Head
sells tickets "three to one to
students and we sell three to
one to adults. Obviously, we'd
both like to even things out.

"But both we and Ram's
Head are established and the
public expects certain things
that have sometimes gotten us
into a hole."
By that, she said, she meant
that the groups were expected
to perform certain works and
to maintain certain standards,
sometimes hampering prog
ress or causing logistical
headaches.
But the Savoyards have man
aged to weather it all and are
looking to The Mikado, which
opens Wednesday of Big Game
Week and runs through that
Sunday.
"It's a nice show with good
music and dialogue," Taylor
said. "Itcarries itself along with
no dead spots."
In the spring, the Savoyards
will present Ruddigore, which
Taylor likes because it offers a
"vehicle for getting well
known faculty involved" (be
cause of its cameo roles.)
And, of course, there always
are the monthly Softball
games. "You'd be surprised
how many people come,"
Taylor said. Even for those Gil
bert and Sullivan-loving
Savoyards.
