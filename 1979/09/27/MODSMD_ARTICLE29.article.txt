Panel to study Cuban issue
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, search
ing for a resolution of the dispute over Russian
troops in Cuba, has convened a panel of U.S.
intelligence experts to offer suggestions on the
problem, officials said last night.
The panel consists of "senior experts in intelli
gence and national security affairs," said one
White House official, who asked not to be iden
tified. He said the group will "assist in evaluating
what should be done in handling the question of
Soviet combat troops in Cuba."
The head of the group, former Defense Secret
ary Clark Clifford, said the seven-member panel
spent "eight or nine hours" at the headquarters of
the CIA on Monday.
Clifford said last night the group was told to "get
all the facts" about the Soviet troop controversy.
He said Carter wanted the panel to question CIA
officials and "to talk the whole thing over."
He said the group won't submit a written report,
but instead will meet with Carter to discuss their
conclusions. He called the CIA meeting "very
thorough."
Clifford would not identify the other members
of the panel. A White House official described the
group as bipartisan, explaining that "the president
wants to build a consensus" on what action to
take.
Other U.S. sources said at the United Nations
earlier yesterday that Carter may personally enter
the flagging U.S.-Soviet negotiations over the Rus
sian troops in Cuba.
Presidential intervention will depend heavily on
the outcome of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance's
session today with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Cromyko.
The U.S. sources, who asked not to be iden
tified, said there is no basis yet for expecting a
settlement of the dispute over the 2000 to 3000
troops. The United States insists the soldiers form
a combat brigade, while the Soviets say the troops
have been on a training mission in Cuba for years.
Canal treaty details approved
Washington — The House passed and sent to
President |immy Carter yesterday a bill to carry out
final details of the treaties that will eventually give
control of the Panama Canal to Panama.
House members had turned down a similar
measure last week. But they approved the bill 232
to 18JJ after backers of the treaties argued that
defeat might bring chaos in Panama.
The Senate approved the legislation Tuesday.
fhe treaties, which take effect Monday, will end
U.S. possession of the Panama Canal which slices
across the Central American country and connects
the Pacific Ocean with the Caribbean.
Carter and Panamanian leaders already had
signed the treaties and they had been ratified by
the Senate.
The bill, now headed for certain signing by Car

ter, establishes a new U.S.-controlled commission
that will operate the canal until, under the treaties,
the Panamanian government takes full control of
the waterway on Dec. 31, 1999.
House defeat of the canal legislation last week
was an embarrassment to Carter, who is sending
Vice President Walter Mondale and Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance to Panama on Monday for
ceremonies marking the end of U.S. possession of
the canal.
The treaties turn most of the Panama Canal Zone
over to Panama at midnight Monday. Other canal
property will be turned over to Panama in stages,
concluding with the transfer of the canal itself at
the end of the century.
Federal pay hike plan gains
Washington — The Senate Appropriations
Committee voted unanimously yes-terday to deny
any pay raise for members of Congress but to
allow other top-level federal employees to receive
a 5.5-percent hike.
Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) said this would
allow the question of whether congressmen
should receive a pay raise to be thrashed out in a
House-Senate conference.
He expressed concern that leaving the raise in
tact would tie up the Senate, as it had the House.
The House on Tuesday approved a 5.5-percent pay
hike for congressmen and top bureaucrats, but
only after it had failed to resolve the matter in
three previous attempts.
"This is just a quick and easy surgical way" to
deal with the pay question, Stevens said.
"Let's just take it out of here and deal with it in
conference."
After agreeing to Stevens' proposal, the com
mittee then took up other portions of the House
passed spending bill to which the pay raise was
attached. Sen. Warren Magnuson (D-Wash.), the
panel's chairman, said he hoped to bring the over
all bill to the Senate floor either today or tomorrow
for action.
Quick action is necessary because the spending
bill contains funds to keep the government run
ning aftef Oct. 1, the start of a new fiscal year.
The emergency money is needed because Con
gress has not passed regular legislation to finance
operations of many major federal agencies.
Congress' last pay raise was a 29-percent in
crease in February 1977.
A key to the bill's passage appeared to be the
last-minute addition to it of one of Congress' favo
rite pets — a $10 billion water project appropria
tion.
Grain workers return to work
Duluth, Minn. — Ocean-going ships opened
their cavernous holds and began gulping grain
from elevators yesterday as grain handlers re
turned to work after an ll'/i-week strike that crip
pled the upper Midwest's farm-oriented

economy.
Ships were tied up at all 12 loading berths in the
twin ports of Duluth and Superior, Wis., with 14
more lined up in the harbor.
Nearby, lines of grain-laden trucks from Min
nesota and the Dakotas began forming to unload
their cargoes. Police estimated more than 1000
grain trucks were backed up on residential streets
in Duluth-Superior.
But now it's a battle against time. The backlog of
grain must be moved before the big lakes start
freezing over.
It was business as usual yesterday for the first
time since July 6, when nearly 600 grain handlers
began walking off their jobs at the docks, which
normally handle about 7 percent of the nation's
grain exports. New contracts, which give grain
handlers about a 2.3 percent raise over three years
and $1000 annual bonuses, were ratified Tuesday.
Damaged gear stalls well repair
Ciudad Del Carmel, Mexico — Damaged gear on
a derrick designed to lower a 310-ton steel cap
over the runaway Ixtoc 1 oil well has delayed the
operation for at least two weeks, PEMEX officials
said Tuesday.
The equipment apparently was damaged re
cently during high winds and heavy seas from hur
ricanes Frederic and Henri, which buffeted a ship
at anchor over the well in the Bay of Campeche,
said lorge Diaz Serrano, director of PEMEX, the
national oil monopoly.
A statement said the cap and damaged ap
paratus would be taken back to port for repair,
estimated to take 10 days, and the placing of the
cone was expected to take five days.
PEMEX engineers and drivers have been trying
since the first of September to position the cone
over the well in hopes of stemming the massive
flow of crude oil and gas, but they were foiled by
constant high waves and rain.
The cone, officials said, is not designed to plug
the well, but to turn it into a producing well until
some way can be found to close it off completely.
Ixtoc 1, 50 miles offshore in the Bay of Cam
peche, has spilled an estimated 107 million gallons
of crude oil and gas into the Gulf of Mexico since it
blew June 3.
