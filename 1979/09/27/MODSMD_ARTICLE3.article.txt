# Town meeting remarks 'exaggerated'
## Carter sends a peace gesture to Kennedy 
### 
Washington (AP) — President Jimmy Carter cal
led a brief cease-fire yesterday in his stepped-up
verbal assault on Sen. Edward Kennedy. He sent
his potential rival a note saying remarks he made in
New York were not intended as a reference to
Chappaquiddick.
In the hand-written note, Carter said his state
ment Tuesday night at a "town meeting" in
Queens had been "grossly exaggerated" by the
press.
Asked by reporters about the note, Kennedy
said he did not consider it an apology but added,

'People can draw whatever inferences
they will/ Kennedy said when asked
about a recent emphasis by the White
House on character and ability to act
calmly in emergency situations.

"I was just glad to get it." *
Carter had told the audience in Queens that as
president he had to deal with several crises and"I
don't think I panicked."
White House press secretary Jody Powell said
Carter had sent the note after reading "erroneous
press reports saying his comments were a veiled

reference to Chappaquiddick."
nomination, Carter would not make an issue of
Kennedy's reaction to crisis conditions when he
drove a car off a bridge at Chappaquiddick in 1969,
resulting in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne.
Kennedy told reporters, "I appreciate his send
ing it (the note) to me and were I to be a candidate
I'd be talking about the issues which are most in
the minds of the American people and I think
that's also what he'd want."
At the Queens town meeting, Carter also ques
tioned whether Kennedy would fare any better
with Congress than Carter has.
"We do not have to send the cost of crude oil
through the roof by abandoning price controls,"
the senator said. "The OPEC nations have the
power to fix the price of oil they sell us. But why
should we give them the power to fix the price of
American oil as well at a time when inflation is
already running 13 percent here at home?"
"I think the real issues in 1980 are economic
issues — the rate of inflation, rising unemploy
ment and energy," the senator said.
Asked about the recent emphasis from the
White House on character and the ability to act
calmly in crisis conditions, Kennedy replied,
"People can draw whatever inferences they will."
Meanwhile, Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-Maine)

"Sen. Kennedy has been in Congress for 16
years," said Carter. "His major premise, his major
goal, has been to establish a comprehensive na
tional health insurance policy ... He has never
gotten a comprehensive national health bill out of
his subcommittee. It is not easy."

does challenge Carter for the 1980 Democratic

Massachusetts Democrat repeated his criticism of
Carter's energy policies:
told reporters Tuesday that he hopes the 1980
campaign doesn't get off to too early a start,
