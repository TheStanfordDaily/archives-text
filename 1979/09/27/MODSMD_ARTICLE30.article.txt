Madrid, Spain (AP) — Premier
Adolfo Suarez and Spanish democ
racy, buffeted by Basque terrorism
and military criticism, appeared
Tuesday to have been pushed into
their tightest political corner since
the end of the Franco regime.
When Suarez suddenly called off a
trip to Central America and the Un
ited States Tuesday because of politi
cal unrest at home, analysts stopped
short of saying the country was in a
crisis.
But nearly all agreed a critical point
had been reached in the career of
Suarez, the premier who guided the
country from dictatorship toward
democracy over the past three years.
His removal, one high government
official suggested, might seriously
endanger the country's still fragile
democracy.
"Suarez obviously could not risk
nine days out of the country while
Basque separatists are killing army
officers, rightists demanding his res
ignation and Franco generals making

public speeches for which they
would have been sacked 18 months
ago," said a European diplomat.
An official close to the premier said
Suarez canceled the trip to show
both the army and Spanish civilians
his concern over the political vio
lence that has taken more than 100
lives this year.
Most responsible political leaders,
including the often skeptical leftist
opposition, discounted the chance
of an army takeover, a repeat of 43
years ago when Francisco Franco led
an army revolt that brought him to
power after three years of civil war.
