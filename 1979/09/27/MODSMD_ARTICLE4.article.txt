# Women's Center placed on ballot
## 
### Julie Jacobs Dianne Cahoon 
A referendum for a $1 winter quar
ter special fee assessment for the
Women's Center will appear on the
Oct. 16 and 17 election ballot.
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Tom Cart announced yes
terday that he had validated the more
than 1200 petition signatures gar
nered by Women's Center leaders at
registration.
To gain a ballot position, a funding
request by a campus organization
must either win the approval of
three-fifths of the members of the
ASSU Senate or be sought in a peti
tion by at least 10 percent of the stu
dent body, according to the ASSU
Constitution.
A spokesman for the Registrar's
Office reported that 11,884 students
registered this quarter. Therefore,
1188 endorsements are required to

plate a fee assessment on the Oc
tober ballot.
Although the Women's Center has
not solicited a fee assessment in the
pastfour years, the current demand
is not based upon "sudden need,"
said Linda Gardner, one of the cent
er's coordinators. Upon its inception
in 1969, the center was fiscally sup
ported by the YWCA.
Earning efforts
"We have in the past spent a lot of
time and energy collecting money,"
which frequently fails to meet basic
operating expenses, she explained.
The center does not, however, wish
to institute charges for the many free
events it sponsors to encourage "at
tendance," Gardner added.
The Women's Center recently
moved from the Women's
Clubhouse in Old Union toa space in
the eating clubs. The installation and

furnishing of that office will incur ex
cess expense, Gardner said.
"We would like to expand our ac
tivities and to pay the people who
run our free workshops every quar
ter," she said in citing reasons for the
assessment.
Overall contribution
Minority associations applying for
the fee assessments must de
monstrate service to the community
as a whole to legitimize their claims
for financial assistance, Gart said.
Women's Center functions are
open to all students and are intended
to contribute to the welfare and en
lightenment of the entire campus,
Gardner emphasized. "Besides men
being able to come to our events,"
she said, everyone benefits from the
"ripple effect of the increased con
cerns on campus over women's ac
tivities."
Moreover, she asserted that "a lot
of projects get started at the Wo
men's Center. It's a place where
separate things spin off."
Past activity
The Women's Center has in the
past sponsored numerous speakers
and conferences, offered women's
referral services to satisfy diverse
needs and supported such issues as
affirmative action. It houses the
Pro-Choice Alliance, the Feminist
Uniorwpnd Aurora, a women's news
pa peCr

Last year the Women's Center in
stigated Women's Week activities
and featured a speech by Andrea
Dworkin, noted author and scholar
on feminist theory, as well as its con
ventional schedule of operations.
This quarter, the center will hold
six workshops on bike repair,
gynecological self-help, assertive
ness training, introduction to the au
tomobile, self-defense and problem
solving for women. It also will host a
Tuesday night series of discussion
seminars, including the film "Killing
Us Softly: An Advertising Image of
Women" on Oct. 9, a speaker from
the Mid-Peninsula Support Network
for battered women's projects on
Oct. 16and abortion fiims on Oct. 23.
Future projects
A band, led by blue-grass musician
Robin Flower, will perform at a Wo
men's Center party Oct. 5 from 7 to
10 p.m. to which all students are in
vited free of charge.
The center will soon publish "A
Woman's Guide to Stanford" and.
will begin orientation procedures for
freshmen women.
Plans for the rest of this quarter
include a dessert pot-luck at the
center and the viewing of a graphic
slide show about women against vio
lence and pornography, Gardner re
lated.

A referendum for a $1 winter quar
ter special fee assessment for the
Women's Center will appear on the
Oct. 16 and 17 election ballot.
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Tom Cart announced yes
terday that he had validated the more
than 1200 petition signatures gar
nered by Women's Center leaders at
registration.
To gain a ballot position, a funding
request by a campus organization
must either win the approval of
three-fifths of the members of the
ASSU Senate or be sought in a peti
tion by at least 10 percent of the stu
dent body, according to the ASSU
Constitution.
A spokesman for the Registrar's
Office reported that 11,884 students
registered this quarter. Therefore,
1188 endorsements are required to

plate a fee assessment on the Oc
tober ballot.
Although the Women's Center has
not solicited a fee assessment in the
pastfour years, the current demand
is not based upon "sudden need,"
said Linda Gardner, one of the cent
er's coordinators. Upon its inception
in 1969, the center was fiscally sup
ported by the YWCA.
Earning efforts
"We have in the past spent a lot of
time and energy collecting money,"
which frequently fails to meet basic
operating expenses, she explained.
The center does not, however, wish
to institute charges for the many free
events it sponsors to encourage "at
tendance," Gardner added.
The Women's Center recently
moved from the Women's
Clubhouse in Old Union toa space in
the eating clubs. The installation and

furnishing of that office will incur ex
cess expense, Gardner said.
"We would like to expand our ac
tivities and to pay the people who
run our free workshops every quar
ter," she said in citing reasons for the
assessment.
Overall contribution
Minority associations applying for
the fee assessments must de
monstrate service to the community
as a whole to legitimize their claims
for financial assistance, Gart said.
Women's Center functions are
open to all students and are intended
to contribute to the welfare and en
lightenment of the entire campus,
Gardner emphasized. "Besides men
being able to come to our events,"
she said, everyone benefits from the
"ripple effect of the increased con
cerns on campus over women's ac
tivities."
Moreover, she asserted that "a lot
of projects get started at the Wo
men's Center. It's a place where
separate things spin off."
Past activity
The Women's Center has in the
past sponsored numerous speakers
and conferences, offered women's
referral services to satisfy diverse
needs and supported such issues as
affirmative action. It houses the
Pro-Choice Alliance, the Feminist
Uniorwpnd Aurora, a women's news

Last year the Women's Center in
stigated Women's Week activities
and featured a speech by Andrea
Dworkin, noted author and scholar
on feminist theory, as well as its con
ventional schedule of operations.
