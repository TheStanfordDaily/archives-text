# Cro Mem library saved
## Student objections halt plan to convert space into offices 
### Nancy Koehn 
A six-week controversy over con
trol of tbe Crothers Memorial dorm
library ended yesterday when Norm
Robinson, dean of residential educa
tion, announced the library will not
be converted to office space.
The Residence Halls Management
Office (RHMO) "will not be using
any more common space at
Crothers," he said.
Last July, the RHMO and Service
Operations considered changing the
dorm library into an office for Terry
McGovern, the new manager of
housing facilities.
According to Rob Ramirez, resi
dence manager, McGovern "was
cramped for office space in Escon
dido Village" and moving his office
into Crothers Memorial (Cro Mem)
"seemed a feasible idea at the time."

Robinson on Monday met with
RHMO and Service Operations offi
cials and more than 30 Cro Mem re
sidents to hear reasons for and
against taking over the library.
Student objections
Robinson told the Daily yesterday
that student objections affected his
decision not to allow the library to be
used for office space.
"I listened to what students had to
say and was persuaded that they
needed the space," he said.
Dorm manager Keith Light de
scribed student reaction to the pos
sible take-over as "as upset and
questioning." Students were con
cerned about losing the area because
"study space is really crucial here,"
he said.
Foreign student needs
"There are a lot of foreign stu

dents here who need to get together
to speak in another language, and
there are a lot of grad students who
really need study room," said Lyman
Paden, housing associate (RA) at Cro
Mem. "The University was going to
duplicate the library, but we're still
losing space," he added.
Concerned students held several
meetings with RHMO officials in July
and August to discuss the problem.
According to Paden, the officials
proposed a compromise in early Au
gust.
Under this compromise, the
RHMO would convert the house lib
rary into an office for McGovern, but
would compensate for the loss by re
furnishing an existing study room ac
ross the hall in the same style. A
two-person dorm room would then
be made into an additional study
area.
Preserve study space
Light said this compromise was
unsatisfactory to many students be
cause they disapproved of eliminat
ing two on-campus housing spaces
in order to preserve study space in
the residence.
According to Paden, RHMO and
Service Operations officials met with
students several times in August and
early September without reaching a
satisfactory solution.
Light said both students and Ser
vice Operations officials spoke at the
meeting. "Both sides of the issue
were presented,"he added.
The controversy originated in April
when the RHMO took over three
dorm rooms, two study rooms and
one recreational area in Cro Mem for
use as RHMO office space. Accord
ing to Paden, the RHMO justified the
move by saying it had a right to use
space in any University residence.
Compensation
As compensation for the loss of
these areas, the RHMO remodeled
and refurnished two large, dorm
paint closets to make them suitable
for study use. Paden said that even
with the two nearly-completed study
rooms, the "dorm square footage
has clearly been reduced" as a result
of the move.
When Cro Mem residents found
out about the conversion of the three
rooms, "they were not happy about
the situation, but there was not or
ganized resistance against the
move," Paden said.
Organized student action against
the moves did not begin until
McGovern's proposed relocation
was announced in July.
