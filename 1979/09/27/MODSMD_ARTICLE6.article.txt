# 'Pillars' of apartheid challenged

### 
Johannesburg, South Africa (AP) —
In a startling turnabout, Prime Minis
ter Pieter Botha has suggested chang
ing laws prohibiting interracial sex
and marriage — pillars of South Afri
ca's apartheid policy.
Botha discussed both lawsduringa
congress of the ruling National Party
in Cape Town on Tuesday. His re
marks were published here yester
day.
It was the first time a leader of the
white-minority regime even ques
tioned the statutes.
The prime minister skirted the
issue of whether the laws should be
scrapped entirely, saying only his

government was open to sugges
tions for "improving" the legislation,
but he said that, in his opinion,
mixed marriages were undesirable.
He told the congress no law should
be regarded as a "holy cow" and he
said that he would not tolerate laws
which insulted people in South Af
rica.
Surprise
Botha's remarks, cautious as they
were, surprised critics of the re
gime's race segregation policies.
"It is remarkable that Mr. Botha is
even thinking about this," said
Kowie Marais, spokesman on justice
matters for the Liberal Progressive
Federal Party.
A report in the Rand Daily Mail, a
critic of apartheid, said "highly
placed government sources indi
cated legal groundwork was to be
prepared to scrap all laws regulating

social behavior on the basis of race.
"At all times," Botha told the con
gress, "we will consider positive
suggestions about any act. There is
no such thing as standing by a law
whether it is good or bad."
While he reiterated that he per
sonally opposed mixed marriages in
South Africa, Botha declared: "I
concede there is a problem where
people really love each other and
want to get married."
Cornerstone
Both the Immorality Act and the
Mixed Marriages Act have been cor
nerstones of the Nationalist Party, in
power since 1948, to maintain the4.s
million white minority's authority
over the country's 19 million blacks.
The Immorality Act — prohibiting
sexual relations between whites and
blacks — was enacted in 1927. The act
was expanded in 1950 to prohibit
sexual relations between whites and
all nonwhites.
The Mixed Marriages Act became
law in 1949 and prohibited marriages
across the color line. Marriages bet
ween white South Africans and
non-whites outside South Africa
were declared null within the coun
try, in an amendment to the act pas
sed in 1968.
This amendment meant mixed
race couples married outside South
Africa could be prosecuted under
the Immorality Act if they returned
here.
Whites wishing to marry non
whites have been forced to leave the
nation to avoid prosecution.
