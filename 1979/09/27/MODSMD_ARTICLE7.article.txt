A significant reduction in Uni
versity parking spaces in recent
years led to the elimination of B
category parking lots and stickers
this year, according to Director of
Police Services Marvin Her
rington.
"Two thousand to 3000 spaces
were lost from the inner campus
with the building of the law
school, Terman Engineering,
Hoover 111 and the new wing of
the (Green) library," he said.
The parking plan involves the
combination of A and B spaces,
while retaining C lots. The new A
stickers sell for $50, $10 less than
last year. (B stickers were $40.)
Other prices remain stable, with C
stickers and student residence
stickers selling for $15.

The University Committee on
Parking and Transportation de
cided last spring to "financially
hold the line on fees," Herrington
said. Income from these fees pays
for the Marguerite, the free cam
pus shuttle bus service.
Herrington said he felt that the
new plan would help to eliminate
confusion previously caused by
the existence of both Band the
more expensive A stickers for
similar purposes.
Last year, some students paid
$60 while others paid only $40 to
park in the same lot near Bowman
Alumni House. The Bowman lot
now will honor only the new A
stickers.
Police generally observe a
one-week grace period, after
which time they begin to ticket
illegally parked cars.
