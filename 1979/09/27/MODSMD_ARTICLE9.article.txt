# Savings and loans offer greater interest, other services

Second in a two-part series
Financial services in the
Stanford area, such as savings
and loans and credit unions,
offer an alternative to the
commercial bank which might
prove attractive to the student
with higher interest rates in
mind.
At savings and loans, an in
terest rate of five and a half
percent, a quarter percent
higher than that paid by com
mercial banks, is ideal for the
student with a largely static ac
count.
Savings and loans offer no
in-house checking accounts;
however, money orders,
travelers checks, and coopera
tive accounts with commercial
banks provide comparable op
tions.
An account with a minimum
balance of $1000 entitles the
customer to free travelers
checks and money orders from
California Federal Savings and
Loan and San Francisco Federal
Savings and Loan Association.
The minimum balance for
these services is one dollar at
Northern California Savings
and Loan; no minimum is en
forced at World Savings and
Loan Association.
World Savings and Loan As
sociation also offers free not
ary service, while Fidelity Sav
ings and Loan Association and
Northern California Savings
and Loan Association provide
safety deposit boxes and tele
phone transfer of funds from
one account to another.
Citizens Savings and Loan
Association, with a minimum
balance of $1000, will provide
limited photocopying and a
cooperative checking account
with Union Bank. Under this

program, the savings balance
earns interest at Citizens until
needed at Union; the account
at Union remains atzero until a
check is written, at which time
the amount is transferred to
the checking account.
Similar checking services are
available at Fidelity Savings and
Loan Association and San Fran
cisco' Federal Savings and Loan
Association, through the Char
tered Bank of London, and
with Northern California Sav
ings and Loan Association
through Crocker National
Bank.
San Francisco Federal Sav
ings and Loan offers a limited
copying service, safe deposit
boxes and a savers club with
discounts for restaurants,
theater tickets and other
forms of entertainment.
Citizens Savings and Loan As
sociation issues a Citizenship
Card which identifies the cus
tomer and facilitates transac
tions at other branches. Addi
tionally, income tax prepara
tion is available with qualifying
accounts at a competitive fee;
the maximum charge is $65.
Advantages of the savings
and loans system, besides
higher interest on savings ac
counts, include more conve

nient hours of service (often
including half days on Satur
day), no charge on withdraw
als, continuous interest and
shorter lines.
On the negative side, how
ever, no personal loans are of
fered unless the savings ac
count is used as collateral. At
most institutions, up to 90 per
cent of the amount in the sav
ings account can be borrowed;
the savings then continue to
draw interest, while the
amount is repaid slowly at an
interest rate of 1 to 2 per
cent greater than the rate at
which the savings draws interest
—an interest rate much lower
than that of commercial banks.
This approach is most practical
for those with large savings ac
counts; in general, most loans
offered at these institutions are
based on real estate.

Other disadvantages include
the fact that no credit cards are
issued, no automatic tellers are
used, no special student ser
vices exist and no personal
checks are cashed unless the
amount in the savings account
is sufficient to cover them.
The major purpose of sav
ings and loans associations,
according to one employee, is
to provide loans for homeow
ners.
Another worker recom
mended that students also take
an account at a commercial
bank, for the added flexibility
of a checking account and of
credit cards, as well as for spe
cial student services.
Yet another staffer, while ex
tolling the uncrowded condi
tions at a small savings and loan
association and even stating
"We're never busy," explained

that the atmosphere is geared
toward the holder of a larger
account — and even to the
senior citizen.
An option already in service
in the East is the NOW ac
count; translating as "negoti
able orders of withdrawal,"
this service is similar to a
checking acount or a share ac
count with a credit union, yet
earns interest of five and a half
percent. One worker forecasts
inception of this program
within a year.
An alternative for those
rooted in the vicinity is the Palo
Alto Credit Union.
All services are offered only
to members; people can be
come involved through the
Consumer Cooperative of Palo
Alto, and enter the organiza
tion in a capacity like that of
shareholder.Membership fees

are $10; members live and
shop in the Palo Alto area and
earn 6.25 percent
on savings accounts. No
credit cards, special student
services or real checking ac
counts are offered, but
cheaper interest rates on
loans, convenience and spe
cial insurance packages prove
attractive to many.
A more complete package is
the Stanford Federal Credit Un
ion. Membership is limited to
graduate students and to those
employed by Stanford or on
University land (including
some undergraduates). These
individuals receive 6.5 per
cent interest on check
ing and savings accounts, as
well as Visa credit card prog
rams, group legal services,
payroll deductions, discounts
on cars and free money orders

and travelers checks. With
lower overhead and fewer de
partments than a commercial
bank, greater services can be
offered. Everyone living in the
member's household is also
entitled to these programs. As
one staffer said, "Once a
member, always a member."
Although the full-service
credit union of Stanford offers
certain technical limitations in
terms of deposits and with
drawal schedules, interest
rates and numerous group
plans make it the most lucra
tive financial option for the
qualifying Stanford resident.

the maximum charge is $65.
Advantages of the savings
and loans system, besides
higher interest on savings ac
counts, include more conve

nient hours of service (often
including half days on Satur
day), no charge on withdraw
als, continuous interest and
shorter lines.
On the negative side, how
ever, no personal loans are of
fered unless the savings ac
count is used as collateral. At
most institutions, up to 90 per
cent of the amount in the sav
ings account can be borrowed;
the savings then continue to
draw interest, while the
amount is repaid slowly at an
interest rate of 1 to 2 per
cent greater than the rate at
which the savings draws interest
—an interest rate much lower
than that of commercial banks.
This approach is most practical
for those with large savings ac
counts; in general, most loans
offered at these institutions are
based on real estate.

Other disadvantages include
the fact that no credit cards are
issued, no automatic tellers are
used, no special student ser
vices exist and no personal
checks are cashed unless the
amount in the savings account
is sufficient to cover them.
The major purpose of sav
ings and loans associations,
according to one employee, is
to provide loans for homeow
ners.
Another worker recom
mended that students also take
an account at a commercial
bank, for the added flexibility
of a checking account and of
credit cards, as well as for spe
cial student services.
Yet another staffer, while ex
tolling the uncrowded condi
tions at a small savings and loan
association and even stating
"We're never busy," explained

that the atmosphere is geared
toward the holder of a larger
account — and even to the
senior citizen.
An option already in service
in the East is the NOW ac
count; translating as "negoti
able orders of withdrawal,"
this service is similar to a
checking acount or a share ac
count with a credit union, yet
earns interest of five and a half
percent. One worker forecasts
inception of this program
within a year.
An alternative for those
rooted in the vicinity is the Palo
Alto Credit Union.
All services are offered only
to members; people can be
come involved through the
Consumer Cooperative of Palo
Alto, and enter the organiza
tion in a capacity like that of
shareholder.Membership fees

are $10; members live and
shop in the Palo Alto area and
earn 6.25 percent
on savings accounts. No
credit cards, special student
services or real checking ac
counts are offered, but
cheaper interest rates on
loans, convenience and spe
cial insurance packages prove
attractive to many.
A more complete package is
the Stanford Federal Credit Un
ion. Membership is limited to
graduate students and to those
employed by Stanford or on
University land (including
some undergraduates). These
individuals receive 6.5 per
cent interest on check
ing and savings accounts, as
well as Visa credit card prog
rams, group legal services,
payroll deductions, discounts
on cars and free money orders

and travelers checks. With
lower overhead and fewer de
partments than a commercial
bank, greater services can be
offered. Everyone living in the
member's household is also
entitled to these programs. As
one staffer said, "Once a
member, always a member."
Although the full-service
credit union of Stanford offers
certain technical limitations in
terms of deposits and with
drawal schedules, interest
rates and numerous group
plans make it the most lucra
tive financial option for the
qualifying Stanford resident.
Second in a two-part series
Financial services in the
Stanford area, such as savings
and loans and credit unions,
offer an alternative to the
commercial bank which might
prove attractive to the student
with higher interest rates in
mind.
At savings and loans, an in
terest rate of five and a half
percent, a quarter percent
higher than that paid by com
mercial banks, is ideal for the
student with a largely static ac
count.
Savings and loans offer no
in-house checking accounts;
however, money orders,
travelers checks, and coopera
tive accounts with commercial
banks provide comparable op
tions.
An account with a minimum
balance of $1000 entitles the
customer to free travelers
checks and money orders from
California Federal Savings and
Loan and San Francisco Federal
Savings and Loan Association.
The minimum balance for
these services is one dollar at
Northern California Savings
and Loan; no minimum is en
forced at World Savings and
Loan Association.
World Savings and Loan As
sociation also offers free not
ary service, while Fidelity Sav
ings and Loan Association and
Northern California Savings
and Loan Association provide
safety deposit boxes and tele
phone transfer of funds from
one account to another.
Citizens Savings and Loan
Association, with a minimum
balance of $1000, will provide
limited photocopying and a
cooperative checking account
with Union Bank. Under this

program, the savings balance
earns interest at Citizens until
needed at Union; the account
at Union remains atzero until a
check is written, at which time
the amount is transferred to
the checking account.
Similar checking services are
available at Fidelity Savings and
Loan Association and San Fran
cisco' Federal Savings and Loan
Association, through the Char
tered Bank of London, and
with Northern California Sav
ings and Loan Association
through Crocker National
Bank.
San Francisco Federal Sav
ings and Loan offers a limited
copying service, safe deposit
boxes and a savers club with
discounts for restaurants,
theater tickets and other
forms of entertainment.
Citizens Savings and Loan As
sociation issues a Citizenship
Card which identifies the cus
tomer and facilitates transac
tions at other branches. Addi
tionally, income tax prepara
tion is available with qualifying
accounts at a competitive fee;
the maximum charge is $65.
Advantages of the savings
and loans system, besides
