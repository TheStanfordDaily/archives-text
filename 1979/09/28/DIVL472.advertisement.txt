Good morning.
How's your feet? I
You kept them up late last night didn't you? And
now they don't feel so good.
You should put them into a pair of Rockports.
Rockports are your feet's idea of a good shoe. Com
fortable. Very, very comfortable. Because we don't make
men's and women's shoes to fit certain price ranges. We
make them to fit feet. We're funny that way.
For example, our shoes are stitched by hand. Be
cause even the best machines can't stitch as well as people.
And the sole isn't one big hunk of crepe.
It's at least eight separate layers. Tliis makes our
sole softer. More flexible. Easier on your feet.
Rockports. And let
Feet have feelings, too. R jßockport]
