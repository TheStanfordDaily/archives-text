# Thermonuclear hobbyist Hansen rails against classification inconsistencies
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Although Charles Hansen
calls himself a "half-baked
computer programmer," the
Mountain View resident at
tained national prominence
recently because of an 18-page
letter he wrote to Sen. Charles
Percy (D-lll.) explaining how
the hydrogen bomb works.
Earlier this month excerpts
of Hansen's letter were pub
lished in Berkeley's student
run Daily Californian, Palo Al
to's Peninsula Times Tribune
and the Madison, Wis. Press
Connection, touching oft a re
newed furor over the heated
question ot atomic secrecy.
While Hansen claimed his
letter was intended as a politi
cal statement against what he
saw as inconsistencies in the
application of 1954 Atomic
Energy Act, the letter also con
tained a crude diagram of the
H-bornb drawn with the aid ot
tuna fish cans to mark concen
tric circles.
In the following interview,
Hansen gives his reasons for
writing the letter critical of the
Department of Energy and exp
lains why he will continue with
his efforts to change the de
partment's classification sys
tem.
Daily: Could an Idi Amin-like
dictator build an H-bomb with
the intormation contained in
your letter or in Howard Mor
land's Progressive article?
Hansen: He would need in
tormation far more specific
than what my letter has. You
would need one hell of a big
industrial complex. You would
need several billion dollars
worth of equipment. You need

scientists, technicians, en
gineers . . . • If India wanted to
spend the money though, in
tact it any country wants to
spend the money, it could
build the industrial plants to
make thermonuclear
weapons. The decision is not
going to be based on material
written in The Progressive.
Daily: Then where do you
draw the line between what
should and should not be kept
secret?
Hansen: The question here,
as I see it, is not so much what
is secret. There is really very
little that is secret. What the
fight is over is the difference
between secret and classified.

The government seems to be
pretending that some ot these
things are secret when they are
in tact common knowledge
among physicists. As far as any
remaining secrets on the sub
ject of thermonuclear
weaponry, the only ones are
chemical or industrial. You
can't classify science. Fusion
(the process which enables an
H-bomb to work) is just basic
physics. Why is the govern
ment trying to pretend the Un
ited States has a monopoly on
it? Why we are following this

screwball idea I have no idea.
Daily: How tar do you think
the public's right to know ex
tends?
Hansen: I don't think the
government ought to start pas
sing out blueprints. I don't
even think they should declas
sify some of the documents
they have been declassifying.
I think the public should
know as much as it can. I think
the more the public knows
about the weapons, and who
has the authority over them,
the better off they're going to

be. Pari of the reason for the
reaction lately to this whole
situation has been that the
government has really been
playing very much on the pub
lic's fear and ignorance. My
personal experience has been
that the more you know about
something, the less you fear it.
As far as the basic science is
concerned, it's really prepos
terous to assume that a free
lance author like Howard Mor
land or a half-baked computer
programmer like myself could

Charles Hansen
possibly come up with any
ideas, could possibly come up
with anything that isn't already
known to nuclear physicists.
The danger of disseminating
this knowledge is virtually nil.
The U .S. government has done
more to disseminate informa
tion than anything Morland or I
have ever done.
Daily: How does your letter
differ essentially in content
from information already in the
public domain such as Hoover
Fellow Edward Teller's Encyc
lopedia Americana article de
scribing the H-bomb?
Hansen: In some ways my let
ter is less specific than Teller's
piece. My letter was never in
tended for publication, it was
intended as a political state
ment to (Sen. Charles) Percy
(D-lll.). I knew that the infor
mation in it (the letter) was in
complete and suspected that it
was inaccurate, and statements
have been made by other
people since that time confirm
that suspicion. I suspect that
the letter was classified be
cause of the political points I
was making. It has been the
policy recently of the [Depart
ment of Energy to use the
Atomic Energy Act tor political
purposes rather than technical
purposes, which in itself is a
violation of the law since the
letter didn't do that.
Daily: What were the main
aims of your letters?
Hansen: I was trying to point
out the inconsistencies in the
way the law is administered.
Daily: Are you disappointed
that fhe letter was printed?
Hansen: In that the chain of
events that ot t ur red led to the
Justice Department dropping
its suit against The Progressive,
I was very pleased. When the
government moved against the
letter and it was printed, the
Department of Justice dropped

its suit. It took me completely
by surprise. I was absolutely
speechless.
Daily: Did the Justice De
partment's decision to drop
the case represent a definitive
statement on the issue of prior
restraint?
Hansen: No, the questions
are still there, the Atomic
Energy Act is still there, there's
nothing to keep the DOE from
starting this whole business
over again using the Atomic
Energy Act as a basis, tomor
row. If they decide they didn't
like what someone had writ
ten, they could go to court, get
an injunction*and we'd be right
back where we started six
months ago. Nothing has
changed.
Daily: How long would it
take for a motivated college
physics major to come up with
the information on construct
ing an H-bomb?
Hansen: Probably a hell of a
lot less time than I did ... I
think a physics student could
come up with this stuff in a
matter of three to four weeks.
Everyone used to assume this
was all some kind of almighty
secret, but now we know that
this is not the case at all.
Daily: How should the
Atomic Energy Act be mod
ified?
Hansen: I think the whole
concept of "Born Secret"
needs to be looked at. I think
that was instituted back in '54
because there were people in
the atomic nuclear weapons
industry who were initiating
new ideas, new secrets all the
time. And rather than set up an
extensive bureaucracy to re
view these things and classify
them automatically, or as a re
sult of a directive, they decided
they would just put this little
clause in there saying that ev
erything that is associated with
nuclear weapons is simply sec

ret at birth.
Unfortunately that concept
has been sorely abused over
the years. Right now the law
does not distinguish in applica
tion between persons inside or
outside of the Establishment.
Daily: Are vou still subject to
prose* utirn?
Hansen: ! depends on who
i«. nlerpieting it . . . I don't
think I've broken any laws so
I'm not worried about it. It's
pretty broad and the govern
ment chooses to interpret it
pretty broadly.
One of the more chilling as
pects of that is that one of the
three areas of restricted data is
defined as the production of
energy with the use of special
nuclear materials. The law
does not discriminate between
energy for nuclear weapons
and energy for commercial
purposes ... So under (hat
category of restricted data the
government could arbitrarily
step in and classify all the de
tails of the next nuclear power
plant accident. They could
order everyone associated
with it to shut up. And they
could even go so far as to ob
tain restraining orders to pre
vent newspapers from printing
stories about it.
During the Three Mile Island
hearings the Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission called openly
for the suspension of the First
Amendment during nuclear
power plant accidents. They
didn't know it but they had the
authority to do it right at their
fingertips. For them lo do that
would have required no
broader an interpretation of
the act than was used against
The Progressive or myself. It's a
hell of a scary thing.
Whether or not they would
have the balls to do it I don't
know. The public outrage
would be tremendous. But
there's nothing to stop the
government from doing it and
I'm sure they would have pre
ferred that a lot of the details
about Three Mile Island — the
technical breakdowns and the
human breakdowns had never
become public.
Daily: What are your plans
now for resolving this issue. Is
it over?
Hansen: No, it's far from
over. As far as my position with
the justice Department, I in
tend to continue speaking out
at every opportunity to the
press and the public on what I
consider to be the issues in the
case and the things that have
happened to me. I thing that
it's important now that the bat
tle be carried out by the' media
and by Congress.

possibly come up with any
ideas, could possibly come up
with anything that isn't already
known to nuclear physicists.
The danger of disseminating
this knowledge is virtually nil.
The U .S. government has done
more to disseminate informa
tion than anything Morland or I
have ever done.
Daily: How does your letter
differ essentially in content
from information already in the
public domain such as Hoover
Fellow Edward Teller's Encyc
lopedia Americana article de
scribing the H-bomb?
Hansen: In some ways my let
ter is less specific than Teller's
piece. My letter was never in
tended for publication, it was
intended as a political state
ment to (Sen. Charles) Percy
(D-lll.). I knew that the infor
mation in it (the letter) was in
complete and suspected that it
was inaccurate, and statements
have been made by other
people since that time confirm
that suspicion. I suspect that
the letter was classified be
cause of the political points I
was making. It has been the
policy recently of the [Depart
ment of Energy to use the
Atomic Energy Act tor political
purposes rather than technical
purposes, which in itself is a
violation of the law since the
letter didn't do that.
Daily: What were the main
aims of your letters?
Hansen: I was trying to point
out the inconsistencies in the
way the law is administered.
Daily: Are you disappointed
that fhe letter was printed?
Hansen: In that the chain of
events that ot t ur red led to the
Justice Department dropping
its suit against The Progressive,
I was very pleased. When the
government moved against the
letter and it was printed, the
Department of Justice dropped

its suit. It took me completely
by surprise. I was absolutely
speechless.
Daily: Did the Justice De
partment's decision to drop
the case represent a definitive
statement on the issue of prior
restraint?
Hansen: No, the questions
are still there, the Atomic
Energy Act is still there, there's
nothing to keep the DOE from
starting this whole business
over again using the Atomic
Energy Act as a basis, tomor
row. If they decide they didn't
like what someone had writ
ten, they could go to court, get
an injunction*and we'd be right
back where we started six
months ago. Nothing has
changed.
Daily: How long would it
take for a motivated college
physics major to come up with
the information on construct
ing an H-bomb?
Hansen: Probably a hell of a
lot less time than I did ... I
think a physics student could
come up with this stuff in a
matter of three to four weeks.
Everyone used to assume this
was all some kind of almighty
secret, but now we know that
this is not the case at all.
Daily: How should the
Atomic Energy Act be mod
ified?
Hansen: I think the whole
concept of "Born Secret"
needs to be looked at. I think
that was instituted back in '54
because there were people in
the atomic nuclear weapons
industry who were initiating
new ideas, new secrets all the
time. And rather than set up an
extensive bureaucracy to re
view these things and classify
them automatically, or as a re
sult of a directive, they decided
they would just put this little
clause in there saying that ev
erything that is associated with
nuclear weapons is simply sec

ret at birth.
Unfortunately that concept
has been sorely abused over
the years. Right now the law
does not distinguish in applica
tion between persons inside or
outside of the Establishment.
Daily: Are vou still subject to
prose* utirn?
Hansen: ! depends on who
i«. nlerpieting it . . . I don't
think I've broken any laws so
I'm not worried about it. It's
pretty broad and the govern
ment chooses to interpret it
pretty broadly.
One of the more chilling as
pects of that is that one of the
three areas of restricted data is
defined as the production of
energy with the use of special
nuclear materials. The law
does not discriminate between
energy for nuclear weapons
and energy for commercial
purposes ... So under (hat
category of restricted data the
government could arbitrarily
step in and classify all the de
tails of the next nuclear power
plant accident. They could
order everyone associated
with it to shut up. And they
could even go so far as to ob
tain restraining orders to pre
vent newspapers from printing
stories about it.
During the Three Mile Island
hearings the Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission called openly
for the suspension of the First
Amendment during nuclear
power plant accidents. They
didn't know it but they had the
authority to do it right at their
fingertips. For them lo do that
would have required no
broader an interpretation of
the act than was used against
The Progressive or myself. It's a
hell of a scary thing.
Whether or not they would
have the balls to do it I don't
know. The public outrage
would be tremendous. But
there's nothing to stop the
government from doing it and
I'm sure they would have pre
ferred that a lot of the details
about Three Mile Island — the
technical breakdowns and the
human breakdowns had never
become public.
Daily: What are your plans
now for resolving this issue. Is
it over?
Hansen: No, it's far from
over. As far as my position with
the justice Department, I in
tend to continue speaking out
at every opportunity to the
press and the public on what I
consider to be the issues in the
case and the things that have
happened to me. I thing that
it's important now that the bat
tle be carried out by the' media
and by Congress.
Although Charles Hansen
calls himself a "half-baked
computer programmer," the
Mountain View resident at
tained national prominence
recently because of an 18-page
letter he wrote to Sen. Charles
Percy (D-lll.) explaining how
the hydrogen bomb works.
Earlier this month excerpts
of Hansen's letter were pub
lished in Berkeley's student
run Daily Californian, Palo Al
to's Peninsula Times Tribune
and the Madison, Wis. Press
Connection, touching oft a re
newed furor over the heated
question ot atomic secrecy.
While Hansen claimed his
letter was intended as a politi
cal statement against what he
saw as inconsistencies in the
application of 1954 Atomic
Energy Act, the letter also con
tained a crude diagram of the
H-bornb drawn with the aid ot
tuna fish cans to mark concen
tric circles.
In the following interview,
Hansen gives his reasons for
writing the letter critical of the
Department of Energy and exp
lains why he will continue with
his efforts to change the de
partment's classification sys
tem.
Daily: Could an Idi Amin-like
dictator build an H-bomb with
the intormation contained in
your letter or in Howard Mor
land's Progressive article?
Hansen: He would need in
tormation far more specific
than what my letter has. You
would need one hell of a big
industrial complex. You would
need several billion dollars
worth of equipment. You need

scientists, technicians, en
gineers . . . • If India wanted to
spend the money though, in
tact it any country wants to
spend the money, it could
build the industrial plants to
make thermonuclear
weapons. The decision is not
going to be based on material
written in The Progressive.
Daily: Then where do you
draw the line between what
should and should not be kept
secret?
Hansen: The question here,
as I see it, is not so much what
is secret. There is really very
little that is secret. What the
fight is over is the difference
between secret and classified.

The government seems to be
pretending that some ot these
things are secret when they are
in tact common knowledge
among physicists. As far as any
remaining secrets on the sub
ject of thermonuclear
weaponry, the only ones are
chemical or industrial. You
can't classify science. Fusion
(the process which enables an
H-bomb to work) is just basic
physics. Why is the govern
ment trying to pretend the Un
ited States has a monopoly on
it? Why we are following this

screwball idea I have no idea.
Daily: How tar do you think
the public's right to know ex
tends?
Hansen: I don't think the
government ought to start pas
sing out blueprints. I don't
even think they should declas
sify some of the documents
they have been declassifying.
I think the public should
know as much as it can. I think
the more the public knows
about the weapons, and who
has the authority over them,
the better off they're going to

be. Pari of the reason for the
reaction lately to this whole
situation has been that the
government has really been
playing very much on the pub
lic's fear and ignorance. My
personal experience has been
that the more you know about
something, the less you fear it.

needs to be looked at. I think
that was instituted back in '54
because there were people in
the atomic nuclear weapons
industry who were initiating
new ideas, new secrets all the
time. And rather than set up an
extensive bureaucracy to re
view these things and classify
them automatically, or as a re
sult of a directive, they decided
they would just put this little
clause in there saying that ev
erything that is associated with
nuclear weapons is simply sec

ret at birth.
Unfortunately that concept
has been sorely abused over
the years. Right now the law
does not distinguish in applica
tion between persons inside or
outside of the Establishment.
Daily: Are vou still subject to
prose* utirn?
Hansen: ! depends on who
i«. nlerpieting it . . . I don't
think I've broken any laws so
I'm not worried about it. It's
pretty broad and the govern
ment chooses to interpret it
pretty broadly.
One of the more chilling as
pects of that is that one of the
three areas of restricted data is
defined as the production of
energy with the use of special
nuclear materials. The law
does not discriminate between
energy for nuclear weapons
and energy for commercial
purposes ... So under (hat
category of restricted data the
government could arbitrarily
step in and classify all the de
tails of the next nuclear power
plant accident. They could
order everyone associated
with it to shut up. And they
could even go so far as to ob
tain restraining orders to pre
vent newspapers from printing
stories about it.
During the Three Mile Island
hearings the Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission called openly
for the suspension of the First
Amendment during nuclear
power plant accidents. They
didn't know it but they had the
authority to do it right at their
fingertips. For them lo do that
would have required no
broader an interpretation of
the act than was used against
The Progressive or myself. It's a
hell of a scary thing.
Whether or not they would
have the balls to do it I don't
know. The public outrage
would be tremendous. But
there's nothing to stop the
government from doing it and
I'm sure they would have pre
ferred that a lot of the details
about Three Mile Island — the
technical breakdowns and the
human breakdowns had never
become public.
Daily: What are your plans
now for resolving this issue. Is
it over?
Hansen: No, it's far from
over. As far as my position with
the justice Department, I in
tend to continue speaking out
at every opportunity to the
press and the public on what I
consider to be the issues in the
case and the things that have
happened to me. I thing that
it's important now that the bat
tle be carried out by the' media
and by Congress.
Although Charles Hansen
calls himself a "half-baked
computer programmer," the
Mountain View resident at
tained national prominence
recently because of an 18-page
letter he wrote to Sen. Charles
Percy (D-lll.) explaining how
the hydrogen bomb works.
Earlier this month excerpts
of Hansen's letter were pub
lished in Berkeley's student
run Daily Californian, Palo Al
to's Peninsula Times Tribune
and the Madison, Wis. Press
Connection, touching oft a re
newed furor over the heated
question ot atomic secrecy.
While Hansen claimed his
letter was intended as a politi
cal statement against what he
saw as inconsistencies in the
application of 1954 Atomic
Energy Act, the letter also con
tained a crude diagram of the
H-bornb drawn with the aid ot
tuna fish cans to mark concen
tric circles.
In the following interview,
Hansen gives his reasons for
writing the letter critical of the
Department of Energy and exp
lains why he will continue with
his efforts to change the de
partment's classification sys
tem.
Daily: Could an Idi Amin-like
dictator build an H-bomb with
the intormation contained in
your letter or in Howard Mor
land's Progressive article?
Hansen: He would need in
tormation far more specific
than what my letter has. You
would need one hell of a big
industrial complex. You would
need several billion dollars
worth of equipment. You need

scientists, technicians, en
gineers . . . • If India wanted to
spend the money though, in
tact it any country wants to
spend the money, it could
build the industrial plants to
make thermonuclear
weapons. The decision is not
going to be based on material
written in The Progressive.
Daily: Then where do you
draw the line between what
should and should not be kept
secret?
Hansen: The question here,
as I see it, is not so much what
is secret. There is really very
little that is secret. What the
fight is over is the difference
between secret and classified.

The government seems to be
pretending that some ot these
things are secret when they are
in tact common knowledge
among physicists. As far as any
remaining secrets on the sub
ject of thermonuclear
weaponry, the only ones are
chemical or industrial. You
can't classify science. Fusion
(the process which enables an
H-bomb to work) is just basic
physics. Why is the govern
ment trying to pretend the Un
ited States has a monopoly on
it? Why we are following this

screwball idea I have no idea.
Daily: How tar do you think
the public's right to know ex
tends?
Hansen: I don't think the
government ought to start pas
sing out blueprints. I don't
even think they should declas
sify some of the documents
they have been declassifying.
I think the public should
know as much as it can. I think
the more the public knows
about the weapons, and who
has the authority over them,
the better off they're going to

be. Pari of the reason for the
reaction lately to this whole
situation has been that the
government has really been
playing very much on the pub
lic's fear and ignorance. My
personal experience has been
that the more you know about
something, the less you fear it.
As far as the basic science is
concerned, it's really prepos
terous to assume that a free
lance author like Howard Mor
land or a half-baked computer
programmer like myself could

possibly come up with any
ideas, could possibly come up
with anything that isn't already
known to nuclear physicists.
The danger of disseminating
this knowledge is virtually nil.
The U .S. government has done
more to disseminate informa
tion than anything Morland or I
have ever done.
Daily: How does your letter
differ essentially in content
from information already in the
public domain such as Hoover
Fellow Edward Teller's Encyc
lopedia Americana article de
scribing the H-bomb?
Hansen: In some ways my let
ter is less specific than Teller's
piece. My letter was never in
tended for publication, it was
intended as a political state
ment to (Sen. Charles) Percy
(D-lll.). I knew that the infor
mation in it (the letter) was in
complete and suspected that it
was inaccurate, and statements
have been made by other
people since that time confirm
that suspicion. I suspect that
the letter was classified be
cause of the political points I
was making. It has been the
policy recently of the [Depart
ment of Energy to use the
Atomic Energy Act tor political
purposes rather than technical
purposes, which in itself is a
violation of the law since the
letter didn't do that.
Daily: What were the main
aims of your letters?
Hansen: I was trying to point
out the inconsistencies in the
way the law is administered.
Daily: Are you disappointed
that fhe letter was printed?
Hansen: In that the chain of
events that ot t ur red led to the
Justice Department dropping
its suit against The Progressive,
I was very pleased. When the
government moved against the
letter and it was printed, the
Department of Justice dropped

its suit. It took me completely
by surprise. I was absolutely
speechless.
Daily: Did the Justice De
partment's decision to drop
the case represent a definitive
statement on the issue of prior
restraint?
Hansen: No, the questions
are still there, the Atomic
Energy Act is still there, there's
nothing to keep the DOE from
starting this whole business
over again using the Atomic
Energy Act as a basis, tomor
row. If they decide they didn't
like what someone had writ
ten, they could go to court, get
an injunction*and we'd be right
back where we started six
months ago. Nothing has
changed.
Daily: How long would it
take for a motivated college
physics major to come up with
the information on construct
ing an H-bomb?
Hansen: Probably a hell of a
lot less time than I did ... I
think a physics student could
come up with this stuff in a
matter of three to four weeks.
Everyone used to assume this
was all some kind of almighty
secret, but now we know that
this is not the case at all.
Daily: How should the
Atomic Energy Act be mod
ified?
Hansen: I think the whole
concept of "Born Secret"
needs to be looked at. I think
that was instituted back in '54
because there were people in

industry who were initiating
