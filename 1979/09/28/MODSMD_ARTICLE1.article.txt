# Thermonuclear hobbyist Hansen rails against classification inconsistencies
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Although Charles Hansen
calls himself a "half-baked
computer programmer," the
Mountain View resident at
tained national prominence
recently because of an 18-page
letter he wrote to Sen. Charles
Percy (D-lll.) explaining how
the hydrogen bomb works.
Earlier this month excerpts
of Hansen's letter were pub
lished in Berkeley's student
run Daily Californian, Palo Al
to's Peninsula Times Tribune
and the Madison, Wis. Press
Connection, touching oft a re
newed furor over the heated
question ot atomic secrecy.
While Hansen claimed his
letter was intended as a politi
cal statement against what he
saw as inconsistencies in the
application of 1954 Atomic
Energy Act, the letter also con
tained a crude diagram of the
H-bornb drawn with the aid ot
tuna fish cans to mark concen
tric circles.
In the following interview,
Hansen gives his reasons for
writing the letter critical of the
Department of Energy and exp
lains why he will continue with
his efforts to change the de
partment's classification sys
tem.
Daily: Could an Idi Amin-like
dictator build an H-bomb with
the intormation contained in
your letter or in Howard Mor
land's Progressive article?
Hansen: He would need in
tormation far more specific
than what my letter has. You
would need one hell of a big
industrial complex. You would
need several billion dollars
worth of equipment. You need

scientists, technicians, en
gineers . . . • If India wanted to
spend the money though, in
tact it any country wants to
spend the money, it could
build the industrial plants to
make thermonuclear
weapons. The decision is not
going to be based on material
written in The Progressive.
Daily: Then where do you
draw the line between what
should and should not be kept
secret?
Hansen: The question here,
as I see it, is not so much what
is secret. There is really very
little that is secret. What the
fight is over is the difference
between secret and classified.

The government seems to be
pretending that some ot these
things are secret when they are
in tact common knowledge
among physicists. As far as any
remaining secrets on the sub
ject of thermonuclear
weaponry, the only ones are
chemical or industrial. You
can't classify science. Fusion
(the process which enables an
H-bomb to work) is just basic
physics. Why is the govern
ment trying to pretend the Un
ited States has a monopoly on
it? Why we are following this

screwball idea I have no idea.
Daily: How tar do you think
the public's right to know ex
tends?
Hansen: I don't think the
government ought to start pas
sing out blueprints. I don't
even think they should declas
sify some of the documents
they have been declassifying.
I think the public should
know as much as it can. I think
the more the public knows
about the weapons, and who
has the authority over them,
the better off they're going to

be. Pari of the reason for the
reaction lately to this whole
situation has been that the
government has really been
playing very much on the pub
lic's fear and ignorance. My
personal experience has been
that the more you know about
something, the less you fear it.
As far as the basic science is
concerned, it's really prepos
terous to assume that a free
lance author like Howard Mor
land or a half-baked computer
programmer like myself could
