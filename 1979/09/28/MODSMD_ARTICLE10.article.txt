# Circle includes more than gurus, celebrities
## Brown considers wide range of opinion 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Gov.
Jerry Brown does not — as
some think — spend all ot his
time getting advice from an
odd bunch of gurus, actresses,
ex-astronauts and counter
culture folk.
The would-be president's
circle of advisers includes all of
those people.
But it also includes powerful,
conservative business execu
tives, politically seasoned
campaign aides and an array of
nonpolitical scholars, authors
and activists.
Tom Hayden, the aquitted
Chicago Seven defendant and
anti-war activist of the 19605,
and Hayden's wife, actress
Jane Fonda, are among people
Jerry Brown often turns to for
advice and ideas.
So are Rusty Schweickart,
the philosophical Apollo 9 as
tronaut; Stewart Brand, pub
lisher of the Whole Earth
Catalog; and Jesse Jackson, the
black political and religious
leader.
Businessmen advise too
Brown also spends time,
however, listening to some of
California's most influential
businessmen such as A.W.
Clausen of the Bank of America
and Ben Biaggini of Southern
Pacific Co.
And he spends long hours, it
irregular intervals, discussing
the nature of man with non
political figures such as an
thropologist Gregory Bateson
and San Francisco Zen Center
abbot Baker-Roshi.
Jacques Barzaghi, Brown's
staff liaison officer, describes
how Brown seeks advice: "He
doesn't have one or two or 10
people" as advisers. "You are

talking about a huge number of
people, hundreds."
Swallows books
"He will seek out anyone
whose views he thinks might
add something. Then there are
books. He swallows books like
a vacuum cleaner. And we may
have to find the author for him
to answer more questions."
For Brown, a 41-year-old
Democrat, this quest for a
broad range of advice is a part
of what he calls his "canoe
theory" of politics: "You pad
dle a little bit on the left, then
you paddle a little bit on the
right side, and you keep going
straight down the middle."
Critics view Brown's canoe
theory as a political ploy aimed
at crassly stroking various in
terest groups and playing
one-by-one to the prejudices
of each group. But those who
represent various ideas say
Brown is receptive to them.
'A bit unpredictable'
Clausen, who visits Brown
every six to 12 months for a
lunch of cold cuts and a discus
sion of business, describes the
governor as a fiscal conserva
tive open to ideas from
businessmen but "a bit unpre
dictable."
Hayden, too, says he finds
Brown receptive to his left
leaning politics, adding: "I
think we get more out of him
than the Bank of America
gets."
The result of Brown's
"canoe" process is usually a
synthesis — a favorite Brown
word — of ideas from rival fac
tions.
For example, he supports a
constitutional convention to
balance the federal budget — a

goal of the far right — but ar
gues that as well as imposing
fiscal discipline, a balanced
budget would force Congress
to make hard choices about
such things as excessive de
fense spending.
Advisers controversial
Hayden and Fonda are
Brown's most controversial
advisers, mainly because of
their opposition to the Viet
nam War. Brown has ap
pointed Hayden to three non
paying posts and Fonda to the
California Arts Council, but her
appointment later was vetoed
by the State Senate after de
bate over her Hanoi visits dur
ing the war.
Hayden, who heads the
7500-member Campaign for
Economic Democracy, says he
talks with Brown about once a
week on various issues.
"It's a relationship based on
issues, not on hanging out to
gether or anything like that,"
says Hayden, who describes
Brown as "a reformer" who is
sympathetic to progressive
causes, but only if Brown sees
enough political force behind
an idea to make it feasible.
'Paddle like hell'
"As long as I know how he
views his job, then I know how

to view mine. If he's going to
paddle on the left and paddle
on the right, then my job is to
make him paddle like hell on
the left," he says.
On the right are people like
Clausen of Bank of America
and members of the California
Roundtable, an association of
chief executives of California's
80 largest companies who meet
with Brown.
Clausen says of Brown: "He
has sought the business point
of view. But he's got another
side of him. His political ap
pointments kind of fly in the
face of his fiscal conser
vativism."
Listens well
Biaggini, president of the

Roundtable and chairman ot
Southern Pacific Co., says
Brown is "a good listener."
"We get a fair hearing, but
the end result is going to be the
product of a lot of different
viewpoints and it . . . may not
be at all like the business view
point," Biaggini said, adding
he was disappointed at
Brown's adamant opposition
to nuclear power.
Some Roundtable members
have become disenchanted
with Brown. For example, In
dustrialist Justin Dart, who says
of the governor: "He listens,
but he doesn't listen . . .leant
figure out what he really be
lieves in, or whether he really
believes in anything."
