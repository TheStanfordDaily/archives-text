## Kennedy energy plan better 
### 
Senators Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and John
Durkin (D-New Hamp.), have introduced an
energy conservation proposal that would re
duce our dependence on foreign oil by 50 per
cent in only one year. Their proposal, the Energy
Productivity Act (an amendment to Senator
Henry Jackson's (D-Wash.) Energy Supply Act),
is now being considered in Congress along with
President Jimmy Carter's Energy Plan.
Kennedy's proposal would cut imports by 4.4
million barrels of oil per day by 1980 at a cost of
$34 billion in net federal spending. However,
the net savings to the American economy would
be $230 billion, and new jobs would be created.
In contrast, Carter's energy program is pre
dicted to reduce imports by the same 4.5 million
barrels of oil a day, but would take 10 years to
implement, and would cost $90-140 billion, or
almost three to five times as much as Kennedy's
program.
The reason Carter's program costs so much is
that it spends 44 times the amount of money on
synthetic fuels ($BB billion) as it spends on con
servation ($2 billion). This is in spite of the
fact that experts agree that conservation mea
sures are four to six times cheaper than produc
ing new energy.
The White House fact sheet on the president's
program says conservation can save a barrel of
oil for less than $10 compared to producing
synthetic fuels at around $38 a barrel. The Ken
nedy program would save a barrel of oil for an
estimated cost of only $3.60!
Conservation measures can also be im
plemented more quickly than synthetic fuel
schemes, create more jobs, and are far less en
vironmentally dangerous.

The Kennedy proposal concentrates on con
servation meaures that require no lifestyle
changes â€” such as insulation and more efficient
machines. It gives conservation incentives such
as tax credits, loans, and grants to the residen
tial, commercial, and industrial sectors. It would
give a maximum of $750 to homeowners who
install approved conservation materials in their
homes. This is 10 times the amount that the
Carter proposal would give.
Kennedy's amendments would set up a com
mercial energy conservation loan program to
make low-interest loans available to building
owners to make improvements in their energy
efficiency. The industrial conservation mea
sures include expanded research, energy au
dits, and first-year payments of $14 per barrel of
oil saved by energy-conserving firms.
Carter's energy program would rely heavily
on synthetic fuels. Despite the fact that we need
immediate relief from our energy problems,
synthetic fuel plants will not be producing any
oil for at least six years!
Synthetic fuels produce more CO J than any
other fuel; will use up scarce supplies of West
ern water; will produce over 2000 types of pol
lutants; will worsen the already severe problem
of "acid rain" and will require strip mining of
large areas.
We should spend less money on synthetic
fuels than Carter proposes, and more on con
servation and other proven alternatives that are
cheaper, quicker, and more environmentally
sound. The Kennedy-Durkin Energy Bill de
serves wholeheartedsupport from all Americans.
