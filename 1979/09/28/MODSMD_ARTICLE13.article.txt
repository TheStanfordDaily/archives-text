## Is Carter as good as his people? 
### 
It is a remarkable fact that ac
cording to the polls, the great
majority of Americans believe
jimmy Carter is a "good,"
meaning moral, man. What is
remarkable about this is that
the most voluble testimony to
jimmy's goodness comes from
none other than himself, a cir
cumstance which would nor
mally seem to impeach its cre
dibility.
"True, Carter has told us that

he would never lie to us, but
the last president of whom this
was said was George
Washington, and even that was
on the word of a hagiographer,
not honest George himself,
who doubtless would have
known better.
But Carter obviously does
not. Instead, he claims to be a
bom-again Christian on the mis
sion of restoring faith in gov
ernment. Vet even while he

professes to have faith in us,
the American people, he lec
tures us on our spiritual
malaise like a Baptist Sunday
school teacher.
Constantly reminding us of
his own churchgoing Christian
piety, Carter seems oblivious
to Christ's admonition on this
subject (Matt.6.l):"Be careful
not to make a show of your re
ligion before man; if you do,
no reward awaits you in your
Father's house."
In truth, Carter's record
seems all the more dismal
when judged by his own right
eous moral standards. By other
standards, Hamilton jordan's
private life would be of no
great concern to the repub
lic, nor would the Marston af
fair, Bert Lance, Peter Bourne,
or "Peariutgate" seem like
more than run-of-the-mill
political scandals. But Carter
promised to restore integrity to
government.
Appointing political hacks
from Georgia to federal office
hardly violates prevailing stan
dards of government employ
ment, either for better or
worse, but in Carter's case we
feel like asking, "Why not the
best?"
If Carter is dogged by hypoc
risy, it is because, as was said of
Woodrow Wilson, he is a man
of "high ideals and no-princi
ples." Somehow, events al
ways conspire to force Carter
into actions that make a moc
kery of his previously an
nounced policies. Thus his
moral equivalent of war on
energy degenerated into a
shabby political attack on the
oil companies at the behest of
his domestic adviser, Stuart
Eisenstat.
Similarly, Carter's widely
trumpeted human rights cam

paign was quietly buried when
it turned out somehow to be
necessary to support Pol Pot in
Cambodia.
Subsequently, human rights
were disinterred to provide a
flimsy excuse for Carter to bar
his fellow Christian, Rhodesian
Bishop Muzorewa, from enter
ing the United States.
It is no wonder then that
other statesmen make a sport
of Carter, and repay his over
tures with insults. Thus it now
appears that when Carter
halted reconnaissance flights
over Cuba as a goodwill ges
ture, the Russians took the op
portunity to beef up their milit
ary presence there. They un
doubtedly realized that Car
ter's gestures are as false as
that gaudy smile he flashes in
the face of hostile questions.
Forall his good intentions, Car
ter lacks the moral substance
to make anything come of
them: he is morally impotent.
But he is also harmless, and
this no doubt contributes to his
popularity. By embracing all
the venerable themes of do
good American uplife, no mat
ter how contradictory or vacu
ous, Carter fortifies us in the
conviction of our national
good intentions without
threatening in the least to
make us do anything to act on
them.
In preserving the gap bet
ween moral ideals and sub
stantive action, Carter shares
in the common hypocrisy on
which social order is inevitably
predicated. For this he is not
unappreciated. At the very
least, he has fulfilled his prom
ise of giving us "a president as
good as the people."

But he is also harmless, and

make us do anything to act on
them.

It is a remarkable fact that ac
cording to the polls, the great
majority of Americans believe
jimmy Carter is a "good,"
meaning moral, man. What is
remarkable about this is that
the most voluble testimony to
jimmy's goodness comes from
none other than himself, a cir
cumstance which would nor
mally seem to impeach its cre
dibility.
"True, Carter has told us that

he would never lie to us, but
the last president of whom this
was said was George
Washington, and even that was
on the word of a hagiographer,
not honest George himself,
who doubtless would have
known better.
But Carter obviously does
not. Instead, he claims to be a
bom-again Christian on the mis
sion of restoring faith in gov
ernment. Vet even while he

professes to have faith in us,
the American people, he lec
tures us on our spiritual
malaise like a Baptist Sunday
school teacher.
Constantly reminding us of
his own churchgoing Christian
piety, Carter seems oblivious
to Christ's admonition on this
subject (Matt.6.l):"Be careful
not to make a show of your re
ligion before man; if you do,
no reward awaits you in your
Father's house."
In truth, Carter's record
seems all the more dismal
when judged by his own right
eous moral standards. By other
standards, Hamilton jordan's
private life would be of no
great concern to the repub
lic, nor would the Marston af
fair, Bert Lance, Peter Bourne,
or "Peariutgate" seem like
more than run-of-the-mill
political scandals. But Carter
promised to restore integrity to
government.
Appointing political hacks
from Georgia to federal office
hardly violates prevailing stan
dards of government employ
ment, either for better or
worse, but in Carter's case we
feel like asking, "Why not the
best?"
If Carter is dogged by hypoc
risy, it is because, as was said of
Woodrow Wilson, he is a man
of "high ideals and no-princi
ples." Somehow, events al
ways conspire to force Carter
into actions that make a moc
kery of his previously an
nounced policies. Thus his
moral equivalent of war on
energy degenerated into a
shabby political attack on the
oil companies at the behest of
his domestic adviser, Stuart
Eisenstat.
Similarly, Carter's widely
trumpeted human rights cam

paign was quietly buried when
it turned out somehow to be
necessary to support Pol Pot in
Cambodia.
Subsequently, human rights
were disinterred to provide a
flimsy excuse for Carter to bar
his fellow Christian, Rhodesian
Bishop Muzorewa, from enter
ing the United States.
It is no wonder then that
other statesmen make a sport
of Carter, and repay his over
tures with insults. Thus it now
appears that when Carter
halted reconnaissance flights
over Cuba as a goodwill ges
ture, the Russians took the op
portunity to beef up their milit
ary presence there. They un
doubtedly realized that Car
ter's gestures are as false as
that gaudy smile he flashes in
the face of hostile questions.
Forall his good intentions, Car
ter lacks the moral substance
to make anything come of
them: he is morally impotent.
But he is also harmless, and
this no doubt contributes to his
popularity. By embracing all
the venerable themes of do
good American uplife, no mat
ter how contradictory or vacu
