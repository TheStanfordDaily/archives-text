## Tom Pratt U.S. educators lack accountability 
### 
It's no secret that public
education for many American
schoolchildren is sadly defi
cient. Declining S.A.T. scores
and reports of inner city
schools graduating high per
centages of semi-literates are
testimony to problems plagu
ing America's school systems.
Almost everyone seems to
have a pet diagnosis and re

medy for these difficulties, and
the list of causal factors has be
come long and complex. Those
most frequently voiced include
inadequate educational
facilities, curricula that include
too little of the "hard core"
fundamentals, varying socio
economic backgrounds that
severely handicap some chil
dren's learning abilities and fi
nally, incompetent teaching
personnel.
Remedying inadequate
facilities and socio-economic
inequalities would surely be
expensive and complex be
cause of political and social
realities, making these alterna
tives — however badly needed
— unattractive for politicians
and educational adminis
trators. As a result, it seems
reasonable that a great deal of
attention would be paid to im
proving curricula and teaching
personnel. But this has not
been the case.
The reason for this can be
summed up in one word: ac
countability. Or perhaps more
accurately, lack of accountabil
ity. American public school
administrators and teachers
are basking in what might be
called an "educational mys
tique."
Recently, the New York State
Court of Appeals unanimously
decided that school districts
could not be sued for failing to
provide a "minimum" educa

tion for students. In Donahue
vs. Copiague Union Free
School District the justices
heard arguments that the
Copiague District failed to pro
vide Edward Donahue — a 1976
high school graduate — with
"even the rudimentary ability
to comprehend written English
on a level sufficient to enable
him to complete applications
for employment."
While no one disputed that
Donahue had serious educa
tional deficiencies, or that his
teachers and administrators
had made no discernable effort
to correct these deficiencies,
the Court held that the New
York State Constitution did not
provide for a "minimum" edu
cation for schoolchildren.
They added that proving such
"educational malprac
tice"suits would be "difficult,
if not impossible."
If such malpractice suits
cannot be filed, what other
tools are there for battling in
competency among teachers
and administrators? Perhaps
firing incompetents — tenure
or no tenure — is the answer.
Since 1974, Salt Lake City has
taken just this route. In that
city, teachers are regularly
evaluated by means of observ
ing their classroom planning
and management, their rela
tionshipstostudents, and their
students' test scores. When a
principal decides that a teacher

needs improvement a staff
team is assigned to observe
and counsel that teacher.
Reports are written and after
60 days the teacher is re
evaluated. If significant im
provement occurs, the obser
vation period is over. If it does
not, another 90 days of staff
directed counseling follows. If
progress is unsatisfactory at
this point, the teacher is termi
nated with 30 days notice.
Recently, administrators
have been included in a similar
program ot their own. So far *l£
teachers have either been dis
missed or resigned as a result
of the program, and approxi
mately 65 others have made
enough progress to be re
tained.
I hope programs like that in
Salt Lake City will become
common around the country.
Teachers and administrators
need to be subject to the same
evaluation processes faced by
other employees in our job
market. When concerned and
organized people demand that
superintendents and boards of
educaton implement such
programs, the mystique and
invulnerability surrounding
educators will finally be evapo
rated. A really constructive
step toward improving Ameri
can public education will then
have been taken.
