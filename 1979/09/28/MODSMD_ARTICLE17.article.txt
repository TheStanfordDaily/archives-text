Orientation unfair
Stanford annually conducts a
certain student policy that con
stitutes nothing more than
blatant discrimination and
favoritism. It's not done
quietly. And there are no ef
forts to hide it. This discrimina
tion comes in orientation: only
freshmen and transfers go
through it.
The rest of us are lost. While
freshmen are receiving sum
mer mailings, huge orientation
books and rides from the air
port, non-freshmen are madly
calling each other, trying to fi
gure out when school starts.
Those that do arrive on campus
(many are stranded for weeks
at nearby airports) are shocked
at how things have changed
since freshman year. No red
shirted volunteers await them.
There is no field day at De-

Guerre for non-orientees.Not
even second glances from
curious upperclassmen. All of
a sudden, we are the up
perclassmen.
The current university is dis
orientation. New construction,
unexpected road barriers and
long student lines immobilize
students once well-versed in
campus navigation.
God knows that fall quarter
is tough enough for non
freshmen. The freshies get
nametags and froshbooks to
help match names to strange
faces. "We" charge into the
memory war unarmed, facing
the humiliating prospect of
m/smatching names to familiar
faces and struggling against
three months of memory de
cay.
Freshmen are simply begin
ning, starting from scratch, and
building a base of friends at

this large university. The rest of
us are re-beginning (starting
from rubble) and unsuccess
fully searching for our frag
mented base of friends.
Then there is the broader
crisis of fall quarter
wishiwashiness. Those autumn
months offer no singular cam
pus tone to cling to. We all
know that winter quarter is "in
tense" and that spring quarter
is "mellow" or "laid-back," but
where do we find out about fall
quarter?
Six thousand — not 1500 —
mindless infants enter The
Farm each fall, and only a small
portion are oriented. The rest
of us just follow the first things
that move, usually the Band
and Darrin Nelson. Early indi
cations are that it is going to be
an especially long year.
