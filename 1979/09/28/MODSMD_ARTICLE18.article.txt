# Kennedy defends FDA regulations
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Donald Kennedy is back after two
years as Commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). "I got of
fered a job that wouldn't wait," he said
as he relaxed in his inner-quad office
where he has been since Aug. 1, catch
ing up on his job as vice president and
provost.
He also said that he resents being
asked repeatedly whether he is goingto
replace Richard Lyman as the Universi
ty's president, stressing that he has
come here to work with Lyman, a
longtime friend.
Kennedy's appearance has not
changed since the days when he was
the chairman of the human biology de
partment and the driving force behind
its creation. Nor has Kennedy's manner
changed; he chooses his words care

fully but does not need to be prodded
with questions.
"Dissatisfaction has nothing to do
with the decision to leave the FDA,"
said Kennedy. However, he did admit
that had he decided a few weeks later,
after President jimmy Carter's recent
cabinet shakeup, dissatisfaction would
have played a major role.
Kennedy has received praise for his
work. Philip Handler, president of the
National Academy of Sciences, has said
that he "may well be the most talented
scientist who has ever led the Food and
Drug Administration." The New York
Times called him the "best commis
sioner in a long time."
Regulation battles
He did have his share of controversy
and he lost some battles for regulation,
however.
By postponing the ban on saccharin,
Congress backpedaled on the "De
laney amendment" which requires the
FDA to ban any food additives that
cause cancer in humans or lab animals.
Saccharin and nitrites continue to be

used, although they caused cancer in
laboratory animals.
"If the Congress passes a law en
gineered so as to let saccharin and
chemicals like it on the market they will
have done a disservice to the health of
American consumers," said Kennedy.
As opposed to cigarettes, which are
generally known to be harmful,
"People making a trip through a
supermarket cannot be expected to
remember the carcinogenicity of
thousands of different compounds,"
Kennedy said.
"There will be a time," continued
Kennedy, during which we look with
modern methods on substances that
people have gotten used to and think
they are safe. These will give acute
pains."

The government's stand on Laetrile, a
substance claimed by some to cure
cancer, was another source of con
troversy. The FDA labeled the drug as
useless and refused to lift its ban. Ken
nedy's anti-Laetrile campaign caused a
wide reaction from conservatives and
libertarians who considered it a classic
example of government interference
with individual rights.
Although Kennedy said he feels that
the press is objective overall in its
coverage, the Laetrile case was a "con
spicuous failure of the media in dealing
with science policy issues." In its ef
forts to present evidence on both sides
of an issue the press sometimes treats
differences "as if they were symmetri
cal and deserve equal time though
there is an enormous difference in
reputability of the two sides," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy accused the neoconserva
tives of using "deliberate nonsense" in
persuading the public that the govern
ment is trying to gain more control over

their lives and limit their freedom.
Kennedy thinks it important for the
government to step in "where there is a
need for health and safety regulations
to protect society from costs of private
activity."
'Trade-off'
"In all areas where the FDA works,
such as the introduction of new drugs,"
continued Kennedy, "there is the issue
of a trade-off between too rapid intro
duction of technology resulting in
hazards to the public and too slow re
sulting in withheld benefits." It is in
evitable, concluded Kennedy, that the

FDA is caught in the middle every time.
Kennedy said he is not happy with the
current anti-government anti
bureaucracy campaign. Bureaucracy is
unfortunately an easy target, according
to Kennedy. "In a large number of cases
what people are mad about is not some
thing bureaucracy can fix," Kennedy
said. Members of the Carter administ
ration have made it "unnecessarily dif
ficult" for themselves. "It is important
for those moving in and out of govern
ment to show respect for those that
have devoted their lives to it," Kennedy
said.

fully but does not need to be prodded
with questions.
"Dissatisfaction has nothing to do
with the decision to leave the FDA,"
said Kennedy. However, he did admit
that had he decided a few weeks later,
after President jimmy Carter's recent
cabinet shakeup, dissatisfaction would
have played a major role.
Kennedy has received praise for his
work. Philip Handler, president of the
National Academy of Sciences, has said
that he "may well be the most talented
scientist who has ever led the Food and
Drug Administration." The New York
Times called him the "best commis
sioner in a long time."
Regulation battles
He did have his share of controversy
and he lost some battles for regulation,
however.
By postponing the ban on saccharin,
Congress backpedaled on the "De
laney amendment" which requires the
FDA to ban any food additives that
cause cancer in humans or lab animals.
Saccharin and nitrites continue to be

used, although they caused cancer in
laboratory animals.
"If the Congress passes a law en
gineered so as to let saccharin and
chemicals like it on the market they will
have done a disservice to the health of
American consumers," said Kennedy.
As opposed to cigarettes, which are
generally known to be harmful,
"People making a trip through a
supermarket cannot be expected to
remember the carcinogenicity of
thousands of different compounds,"
Kennedy said.
"There will be a time," continued
Kennedy, during which we look with
modern methods on substances that
people have gotten used to and think
they are safe. These will give acute
pains."

The government's stand on Laetrile, a
substance claimed by some to cure
cancer, was another source of con
troversy. The FDA labeled the drug as
useless and refused to lift its ban. Ken
nedy's anti-Laetrile campaign caused a
wide reaction from conservatives and
libertarians who considered it a classic
example of government interference
with individual rights.
Although Kennedy said he feels that
the press is objective overall in its
coverage, the Laetrile case was a "con
spicuous failure of the media in dealing
with science policy issues." In its ef
forts to present evidence on both sides
of an issue the press sometimes treats
differences "as if they were symmetri
cal and deserve equal time though
there is an enormous difference in
reputability of the two sides," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy accused the neoconserva
tives of using "deliberate nonsense" in
persuading the public that the govern
ment is trying to gain more control over

their lives and limit their freedom.
Kennedy thinks it important for the
government to step in "where there is a
need for health and safety regulations
to protect society from costs of private
activity."
'Trade-off'
"In all areas where the FDA works,
such as the introduction of new drugs,"
continued Kennedy, "there is the issue
of a trade-off between too rapid intro
duction of technology resulting in
hazards to the public and too slow re
sulting in withheld benefits." It is in
evitable, concluded Kennedy, that the

FDA is caught in the middle every time.
Kennedy said he is not happy with the
current anti-government anti
bureaucracy campaign. Bureaucracy is
unfortunately an easy target, according
to Kennedy. "In a large number of cases
what people are mad about is not some
thing bureaucracy can fix," Kennedy
said. Members of the Carter administ
ration have made it "unnecessarily dif
ficult" for themselves. "It is important
for those moving in and out of govern
ment to show respect for those that
have devoted their lives to it," Kennedy
said.

Donald Kennedy is back after two
years as Commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). "I got of
fered a job that wouldn't wait," he said
as he relaxed in his inner-quad office
where he has been since Aug. 1, catch
ing up on his job as vice president and
provost.
He also said that he resents being
asked repeatedly whether he is goingto
replace Richard Lyman as the Universi
ty's president, stressing that he has
come here to work with Lyman, a
longtime friend.
