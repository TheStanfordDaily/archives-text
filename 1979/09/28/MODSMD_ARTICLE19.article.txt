Concord, N.H. (AP) —
California Gov. jerry Brown
says that if he is elected presi
dent he will keep nuclear
power plants now being built
from going into operation.
Brown, an unannounced
candidate in New Hampshire's
lead-off presidential primary
next February, is billing himself
as the only presidential con
tender flatly against nuclear
power.
"I believe Seabrook is a mis
take because it's neither
economically or environmen
tally sound," Brown said in a
recent telephone interview.
"It's obvious that the people of
New Hampshire would be far
better served if that plant is not
brought into operation and the
funds and site used for some
thing more sensible."
The plant has been the focal
point of the anti-nuclear
movement in America. More
than 2000 persons have been
arrested at the plant's con
struction site during the past
five years^
"I oppose the licensing of all
new plants and would attempt
to see that plants that have not
been licensed are not brought
on line," Brown said.
Alternatives
Those plants that are already
licensed should be "phased
out as soon as timely and re
sponsible alternatives are av
ailable," he said.
Brown cautiously tempered
his promise by noting that fed
eral and state law would
hamper his plan.
"I realize that a president only
has so much power and a
dramatic switch such as I prop
ose must have the support of
the people and Congress,"
Brown said. "But the American
people are going to reject nuc
lear power when their gov
ernment gives them a viable al
ternative," he added.

The 41-year-old Democrat
says his plan would require a
tremendous investment in
conservation, hydro, solar and
geothermal power "and a host
of other energy initiatives."
"A sober choice must he
made between addiction to
nuclear power and a more sen
sible set of alternatives . . .
more compatible for a secure
future for our country," he
said.
In the case of Seabrook,
Brown says he doesn't see a
problem in finding an alterna
tive source of non-nuclear
power for New England.
"I don't see a problem, par
ticularly if we can develop a
policy with Canada to share
some of their hydro-electric
power," Brown said.
Wary of promises
Anti-nuclear activists, who
might be expected to jump on
Brown's presidential bandwa
gon, are cautious about Brown
based on his claim.
Many say they've "heard the
promises before" and point to
a speech by President Jimmy
Carter during the 1976 presi
dential campaign. Shortly after
being nominated, Carter told a
New Hampshire audience that
nuclear plants should be built
"where people don't live;
where the environment will
not be destroyed and with the
reactor core beneath the
ground."
"He made promises and I
have a record to back up my
claims," Brown said of Carter's
record. "I signed the toughest
anti-nuclear law in the country
and I haven't seen any other
prospective nominees in either
party come even close to my
record on nuclear power."
California has two nuclear
power plants currently
generating electricity and
Brown takes credit for stop
ping three others.
