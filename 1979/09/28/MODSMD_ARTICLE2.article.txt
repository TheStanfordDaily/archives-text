# 'Progressive' case reviewed

### Bill Burger Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: The following article is a conden
sation of the events leading up to the Depart
ment of lustice's recent decision to drop its case
against The Progressive magazine. Charles Han
sen, who is interviewed in the accompanying
story, played a significant role in the govern
ment's abandonment of the case, which might
have been ot significant constitutional impor
tance.

On March 26, one of the few judicial orders in
the history of the nation restraining publication
was granted at the federal government's request
against The Progressive, a small magazine in
Madison, Wis.
Legal battles raged tor several months bet
ween the magazine and the Department of jus
tice, which was representing the Department of
[Energy (DOE) in the case. The DOE contended
that the information contained in Howard Mor
i land's article contained classified information
on the construction of a hydrogen bomb.
In turn, Morland and The Progressive
claimed all the theoretical and technical infor
mation in the article was found in unclassified
and declassified materials in the public domain
and hence, any attempt to prevent the publica

tion of the information was a gross abridgement
of freedom of the press.
After The Progressive injunction was granted,
several letters and affadavits of nuclear experts
were classified by the DOE under the terms of
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
In the most recent, and most notable, classifi
cation case, Charles Hansen, a Mountain View
computer programmer, wrote a letter criticizing
the DOE's classification system and outlining
what he had learned about the making of a hyd
rogen bomb through unclassified documents.
Hansen sent copies of the letter, which was
addressed to Sen. Charles Percy (K-III.), to sev
eral newspapers, including Ihe Daily Califor
nian at UC-Berkeley and the Peninsula Times
Tribune.
The Justice Department moved to stop those
newspapers from publishing material from Han
sen's letter. But while those injunctions, and the
one against The Progressive, were in force, The
Madison Press Connection, in Madison, Wis.,
published the full text ol Hansen's letter.
The Department of Justice, then taced with
direct disregard for its judgement and authority,
dropped its cases against The Progressive and
The Daily Calitornian, thus giving those publica
tions, and any others, the green light to go
ahead with their plans.
