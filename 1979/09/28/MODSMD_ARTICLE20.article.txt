# Can Stanford bounce back?
## Endangered or not, BC Eagles fly Into Stanford 
### Chris Haft 
Stanford's Pacific-10 Conference foot
ball game with UCLA is still eight days
away, and the Big Game against California
doesn't come until mid-November.
Yet tomorrow's game against Boston
College is probably as important as those
aforementioned. Some three hours after
the 1:30 p.m. kickoff at Stanford Stadium,
the Cardinals may have discovered what
the remainder of their season holds for
them.
An impressive victory will send the
Cards emotionally higher than a dozen
kites into the Pac-10 season. A loss, how
ever, could severely sink Stanford's
morale when they need it most.
Much discussion has recently been de
voted to the Cards' allegedly disappoint
ing attitude. Obviously a definite problem
must have existed, for Stanford began
preparing for the Eagles not with a rigou
ous Monday practice but with a team
meeting.
According to one team member, the
gathering was nothing special — "just an
ordinary football meeting."
Another, however, claimed that it gave
everybody a chance to voice smoldering
complaints, resulting in a general good
feeling among the players.
Whatever the meeting accomplished,
Boston College looms ahead. "It's a big
game for us," Card head coach Rod
Dowhower said. "We're eagerly looking
forward to playing."
Certainly the same can be said for the

Eagles. Having previously suffered 13 con
secutive defeats, Boston College and
coach Ed Chlebek reversed their fortunes
last week with a 34-7 triumph over Vil
lanova.
I he 1-1 Eagles, who lost their opener to
Tennessee 28-16, base their offense on a
strong running game:
Boston's ground attack revolves around
halfback Shelby Gamble, fullback Dan
Conway and quarterback Jay Palazola.
Gamble, a 5-foot-11, 195-pound
freshman, ignited last week's Eagle effort
by churning for 157 yards and two
touchdowns on 19 carries. With 193 yards
on the season, Gamble gives Boston a de
finite big-play threat, as his 6.9 rushing
average shows. • s
Conway stands right behind Gamble
with 191 yards on 45 carries. More impres
sively, the 6-foot-2, 205-pound senior has
lost only one yard in two games.
Signal-caller Palazola possesses an at
rophied passing arm — he's completed
just 18 of 42 passes for 262 yards —but like
his backfield mates Gamble and Conway,
Palazola's legs are plenty strong. His po
tential for scrambling (106 yards on 26 car
ries) keeps defenses honest.
"We have to play their option well,"
Dowhower commented. "Their coaches
have experience in running that type of
offense."
Among the Eagles' other standouts are'
right guard )ohn Schmeding, an All-
America candidate, and linebackers |eff
Dziama and jim Budness, who have 51

tackles between them thus far.
As for the Card lineup, the only surprise is
that there are no surprises. Except tor two
minor defensive switches, (Dan Floyd for
Duker Dapper at nose guard and Kevin
MacMillan fnrthe injured RodneyGilmore
at strong safety), Stanford will start the
same squads that fell to Army last Satur
day, 17-13.
"I don't think there's any need for per
sonnel changes, because that's not neces
sarily our problem," Dowhower said.
"Our players are working hard. It's just a
case of not getting the job done."
One feature of the offense that
Dowhower didn't complain about was
running back Vincent White. The 5-foot-9,
170-pounder currently leads all Card
rushers with 138 yards on 30 carries.
"White played a great game," said
Dowhower of the scampering freshman,
who gained 70 yards against the Cadets. "I
know he fumbled (on the Army eight-yard
line to kill apotential scoring drive), but he
still played pretty well."
Dowhower certainly knows a lot more
about football than Penthouse magazine
does, but he and the rest of the Cards
might be interested to know that three of
Stanford's non-conference opponents —
Tulane, Army and Boston College — made
Penf/iouses'"2oworstfootball teams" list.
So far the Cards are 0-2 against the so
called flops. Another defeat tomorrow
would make Stanford's record appear
more tawdry than a porno centerfold.
