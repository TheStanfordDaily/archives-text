# Soccer squad devours Davis, 4-2
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Davis — At the onset of the
soccer team's first road trip,
Stanford looked as flat as the
surrounding Volo County
farmland. In contrast, UC-
Davis was hungry, coming off
of two straight wins. After five
minutes of play, the Aggies
could almost taste an upset
with a 1-0 lead.
It appeared that Stanford's
winning streak, as well as its
shutout streak, wouldn't be
present on the chartered bus
back to Palo Alto. Fortunately,
the Card catering service
closed for inventory, serving
up only one more goal at the
end of the 4-2 Stanford victory
Wednesday afternoon.
"We didn't play well, but we
were still able to win," said

Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge. "It was finesse, our
cornerkicks.
"It's a good sign that we can
play poorly and win," he ad
ded.
The Cards, now 4-0-1 on the
year, needed the shock of fal
ling behind to get motivated.
"Davis is one of the stronger
of the teams we've met so far —
they're excellent playmakers,"
lodge said. "Davis came out
penetrating in the first five mi
nutes. They were able to catch
us with quick plays. We sat
back on our 3-0-1 record."
Stanford won the game on
paper, but the on-field per
formance was bittersweet. Two
basic assetr that distinguish a
great team are talent and at
titude. Right now the Cards are

a good team, with talent run
ning two platoons deep. When
they develop the attitude of a
great team, they will become a
great team,
"I think we're a little out of
shape and it's . . . attitude,"
explained midfielder Bill Hof
fenburg. "We have the skill.
What we're missing is team
cohesion. We've got to start
talking (on the field)."
"It's mostly attitude," con
curred sophomore striker Ted
Rafalovich. "The team's not to
gether on the field. I'm sure it
will come sometime."
Senior fullback Jon Hecht
stated, "It was not a negative
experience. We won and it's
not good to dwell (on one
game)."
Teamwork. Communica

tions. These can come with
time. And effort.
Amid a less-than-textbook
perfect game, there were sev
eral highlights. Co-captain
Greg Delgado scored once in
each period and was cited by
Lodge and fellow players for
his play at sweeper.
Six-foot-one Neil Tennyson
was literally and figuratively a
standout, winning nearly every
head ball or tackle coming his
way. Peter Philips, back in at
forward after being injured,
added a first half goal, as did
Willie Cuicce (all scores as
sisted by Rafalovich). Doug
Clarke was an "absolute
standout" in coming off the
bench as a forward, according
to Lodge.


Randy Kalbus prepares to fire a pass past a flailing fellow from
Pepperdine yesterday at deGuerre Pool. Having defeated both
Arizona and the Waves this week, Stanford hosts the Nor-Cal Invita-

_ —Daily pliolo by Jdines Hig,j
tional Water Polo Tournament at deGuerre today and tomorrow.
Among the teams competing are California, San Jose State and Fresno
State.
And the plays stressed in
practice, especially corner
kicks, proved successful in ac
counting for half of the Stan
ford goal production.
Less than a quarter of the
way through the season, the
soccer team finds itself talent
laden but needing a higher de
gree of teamwork. On skill
alone, the Cards could go far.
However, structuring that skill
with a stronger team coopera
tion will make the difference
between meeting and beating
teams like Santa Clara,
Washington, San lose State
and USF.
