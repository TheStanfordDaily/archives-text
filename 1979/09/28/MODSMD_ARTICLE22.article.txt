## Poloists prevail twice; host Nor-Cal Tournament 
### Brad Brockbank 
Extending its home-pool
winning streak to 36 consecu
tive victories, the Stanford
water polo team doused
Arizona and Pepperdine this
week by 13-7 and 16-5 scores,
respectively.
Today at 10:30 a.m., the
Cards host Fresno State in the
first round of the Stanford Invi
tational Tournament. Stanford
will face UC-Davis at 1:50 p.m.
today and, assuming they are
victorious, will probably face
West Berlin and California
tomorrow.
Arizona provided little com
petition for the Cardinal start
ing seven on Wednesday. Stan
ford jumped off to a 5-2 lead by
the end of the first quarter, ex
tending the margin to 10-4 by
the third quarter buzzer. With
mostly reserves playing the
final period, the Cards man
aged to match the Wildcats
goal-for-goal in the final quar
ter.
"The reserves have got to do
a better job coming off the
bench," said Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamanti.
He said the Wildcats got off
shots in the fourth quarter that
"they never should have got
ten."

In general, however, De
ttamanti said he was pleased
with the overall play of the
team. The physical aspects of
the game — shooting, swim
ming, etc. — and the intensity
of the players has been good,
Dettamanti said.
But because Arizona is a
team "we know we can beat,"
he added, "we're doing little
things that we knew we could
get away with (against Arizona)
that we won't get away with
against top teams."
The team's play, particularly
the defense, was better against
Pepperdine yesterday, how
ever, and Dettamanti praised
the play of his second team.
Singled out was freshman
Greg Lambert, who scored two
goals against the Waves and
played a strong defensive
game, according to De
ttamanti.
"This was his best game off
the bench," the coach said.
"He's playing better defense,
adjusting to the officiating and
getting confidence in his of
fensive abilities. We're really
counting on Greg to help us a
lot. He'll improve every
game."
Another "best game" per
formance was turned in by

sophomore Alan Mouchawar,
who led the Cardinal attack
with four goals against the
Waves.
"He's shooting the way I
know he can," Dettamanti
said. Prior to this week's
games, the coach said,
Mouchawar had not been
"challenging" the other team.
"But he's gaining confidence
in his shooting now."
The top scorer for Stanford
this week, however, was Jody
Campbell. The sophomore
hole man scored four times
against Arizona and added
three more yesterday; his ef
forts received extensive praise
from Dettamanti.
"Jody's been the backbone
of our team. He has a super
attitude — he's aggressive in all
phases of the game," De
ttamanti said.
Dettamanti also noted the
balanced scoring attack —
eight players scored against
the Waves — and expressed his
satisfaction with the Cardinal
counter-attack which devas
tated Pepperdine.
I he other outstanding figure
of yesterday's contest was
goalie Vince Vannelli, whose
13 saves frustrated the Waves
offense.
