# Nelson starts at guest Greek spot

### 
Darrin Nelson, the once
and tuture Sire of Stanford
Stadium, showed us that he
can pick winners just as eas
ily as he picks through holes
on the football tield —when
he's healthy, that is.
Incapable ot playing but
not incapable of prognos

ticating, Nelson becomes
the Daily's first Guest Creek
ot the Week for 1979's

Nelson's hallowed opin
ions follow:
Arizona St. at Oregon St.
— "ASU 21, Oregon St. 7.
ASU has improved and
they're a far better team re
gardless where they're play
ing at."
Fresno St. at Washington
— "(laughs) Washington is
gonna blow them out.
Fresno has a good team, but
what league are they in, the
PCAA or something like
that? I don't think they can
compare with Washington:
Huskies, 35-14."
Michigan at California —
"Oh, my goodness. I pick
Michigan 17-10. Cal's been
playing well, so I expect the
game to be close. But
Michigan has been on top
for years, so they should be
able to pull it out."
Ohio St. at UCLA —
"God, that's gonna be
close. Can I pick them even?
Okay, a 7-7 tie. Both teams
have good defenses and
neither throws well."

Oregon at Purdue — 1
"Purdue, 49-21, mainly be
cause Mark Herrmann is a
good quarterback. Purdue »
is at home, and they've got a
good defense also."
San lose St. at Arizona —
"I'm gonna take San Jose
10-7. It'sabout time San Jose
won one. They've been in
some good games."
USC at LSU — "Trojans,
28-14. USC is good all the
time, and they're No. 1 in
the rankings. You gotta give
them a little credit. I hope
they lose, but I don't think
they will."
Washington St. at Syra
cuse — "Syracuse? Have
they won any games yet?
Washington State 3, Syra
cuse 0. I gotta go with the
Pac-10 team."
Boston College at Stan
ford— "Stanford 28, Boston
College 3. Everybody's set
tled down, and we'll put
some points on the board."
