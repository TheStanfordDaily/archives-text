The Stanford women's field
hockey team flies into action
this weekend at the Oregon
Invitational Tournament
hosted by the University of
Oregon at Eugene.
The Cardinals will be playing
Oregon, Washington, Chico
State and California during the
two-day tournament.
Coach Barbara >Longstreth
described the weekend tour
ney as both demanding and
important. Four hour-long
matches in two days is a rigor
ous schedule, and Washington
and Oregon were the two best
teams in the NorCal Confer
ence last year.
In addition, Longstretch
noted that Chico is "tough
competition," even though the

Cards defeated them 3-0 on
Saturday.
Team member Nancy
jackson said these matches are
the first key games of the sea
son. "We're going to have to
play — these count," she said.

Longstreth sounded op
timistic about the team,
"There's excellent leadership
bn the field coming from
Jackson and (Nancy) White,"
she said. "And we've got a lot
more depth now than in the'
past."
