# Media coverage of David studied
## Prof, student find hurricane heroes 
### Kathy Trafton 
They knew it was coming,
but when Hurricane David
ravaged the tiny isle of
Dominica in late August, most
people were prevented, by the
hurricane and by their own
shock, from taking much ac
tion.
Even Prime Minister Oliver
Seraphin was stunned into in
action for more than a day.
Hurricane David was to kill
27 and injure 1000 of the is
land's 85,000 population. It left
60,000 of the inhabitants home
less. In addition, 85 percent of
the banana plantations, the is
land's major source of income,
were destroyed.
Rahul Sood, doctoral stu
dent, and Prof. Everett Rogers,
both of the Department of
Communication here, arrived
in Dominica two days after the
hurricane hit to do a field study
on the role of the media in a
disaster context.
Some people immediately
acted to aid the crippled
Caribbean nation and to in

form the waiting world of con
ditions within. A teenaged ham
radio operator, a television
news team from the neighbor
ing island of Antigua, and a
pilot of a small Cessna plane
were three of the heroes of
post-disaster Dominica, ac
cording to Sood.
The hurricane struck on
Wed., Aug. 29, bringing with it
galeforce winds of up to 150
mph.
Periods of relative calm al
ternated with wicked winds
over a period of seven hours,
and darkness fell over the capi
tal city of Roseau even during
midday.
Vegetation and homes alike
were being demolished. The
corrugated tin roof blew off the
small house in which Fred
White, a teenager,
labored with his ham radio to
send the outside world news of
what had occurred.
Ham radio only link
His was the only signal to leave
the island for two days, and he
could not be certain that his

messages were being received
by anyone, Sood said.
Nevertheless, he continued to
transmit during the day of the
hurricane and even into the
night, despite the fact that the
country's power supply was
destroyed. The batteries he
used became increasingly
weak.
In an effort to protect his
radio from the raging storms
that entered where his roof
had been, Operator Fred took
shelter beneath a table. Soon,
his table blew away. Finally,
Fred crouched beneath an out
side wall of his house, which
had begun to fall in, and from
that spot continued sending
his messages.
The next day, Fred began
broadcasting from the Police
Station in Roseau. He was au
thorized to hook up his unit to
the only emergency power
generator on the entire island.
As there was no other way
for a message to leave
Dominica, Prime Minister
Seraphin used Fred's radio on

Thursday to send an official re
port on the condition of the na
tion to whoever might be lis
tening.
A Florida ham operator,
George Nafsinger, picked up
the message and notified the
U.S. State Department. It was
perhaps the first time that the
State Department heard and
responded to an unsubstan
tiated ham radio message,
Sood said. The Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance's
relief supplies first arrived
Saturday morning in
Dominica.
Operator Fred, who was sol
ely in charge of external com
munication, continued broad
casting through Saturday even
ing. He was the lifeblood of the
Command Center in Roseau,
and he stayed awake from
Wednesday morning to Satur
day evening.
After a night's rest he was
back on the job Sunday morn
ing — bleary-eyed, but happy
and proud.
On Friday evening, a

three-man news team
from the island of Antigua was
able to arrive at Dominica's
only airport on one of the first
commercial flights to land after
Hurricane David struck the is
land. They were unable to
travel the 40 miles to Roseau
until Sunday morning, when
the road had been cleared of
debris, mudslides and fallen
trees.
They carried with them
amateur-quality half-inch por
tapak video recording equip
ment, primitive by American
standards. Their at-home sta
tion equipment was minimal
too: it had no editing equip
ment. Therefore, everything
shot on location had to be shot
sequentially with no extrane
ous footage.
But what they lacked in
equipment they made up for in
editorial style. Whereas an
American television team
might be tempted to show the
severity and extent of the hur
rican's danjage through
wounds, destruction and grief,
the Antigua team did not, ac
cording to Sood.
Instead, their emphasis was
on the improvements and the
good that was being done to
counteract the harm.
Film shows good, not harm
Only their program's opening
scene showed destruction —
but even that was a panoramic
distant shot of Roseau's roof
less houses. Next were inter
views with Prime Minister

Seraphin and Operator Fred.
Seraphin spoke of the urgent
needs of his country, while
Fred White was shown to be
the hero that he was.
At the hospital, the news
team refused to show the vic
tims waiting for medical atten
tion; instead they showed
sailors from a visiting British
naval ship repairing the roof.
The Program Director of the
Antigua news team, Frank
Liburd, gave a complete pic
ture of the disaster in his
coverage, but he emphasized
the positive efforts of the citi
zens and of heroes such as
Fred White. By taking this tack
he was a hero himself, Sood
said.
In a very different manner,
one other hero aided
Dominica in its first days of
crisis.
Another hero
Larry Galloway, the Ameri
can pilot of a small Cessna,
flew into Dominica's airport on
Friday morning. Later that day
he flew across the island to
Roseau, where there is no air
port, and was the first person
ever to land on the narrow,
damaged and curving road
outside the city. The road had
steep hills on one side, the
ocean on the other and palm
trees and telegraph poles all
along it.
One passenger reported,
"We couldn't have missed one
of the palm trees by more than
a foot." Galloway was to make
17 such landings on the same

strip of road over the next
three days.
Galloway's plane is old and its
radio is so outdated that he is
often unable to communicate
with airport control towers.
But that does not deter him
from landing. On one take-off
from his makeshift runway at
Roseau, he damaged his
plane's wingtip on a palm tree
stump. Undaunted by the sight
of sheet metal hanging from
the wing, or from the hazards
of piloting a damaged craft full
of passengers, he flew on to a
nearby island for repairs. He
landed without permission just
ahead of a 747 jet, which had to
overfly the runway at the very
last minute.
"This was probably the first
legitimate emergency landing I
made as far back as I can re
member," he joked.
Galloway took loads of med
ical personnel and supplies,
missionaries and media rep
resentatives into and out of
Dominica.
In addition, Galloway con
tacted loved ones who were
concerned for the safety of
those in Dominica. One even
ing he spent two hours making
long-distance calls from his
personal telephone to all parts
of the world.
Even though Galloway's wife
was expecting their second
child back in Florida within
weeks, he felt he had to help
the proud but needy inhabit
ants of the tiny damaged isle of
Dominica.

island of Dominica found some unlikely heroes to help inhabitants and inform the world of conditions
there.
They knew it was coming,
but when Hurricane David
ravaged the tiny isle of
Dominica in late August, most
people were prevented, by the
hurricane and by their own
shock, from taking much ac
tion.
Even Prime Minister Oliver
Seraphin was stunned into in
action for more than a day.
Hurricane David was to kill
27 and injure 1000 of the is
land's 85,000 population. It left
60,000 of the inhabitants home
less. In addition, 85 percent of
the banana plantations, the is
land's major source of income,
were destroyed.
Rahul Sood, doctoral stu
dent, and Prof. Everett Rogers,
both of the Department of
Communication here, arrived
in Dominica two days after the
hurricane hit to do a field study
on the role of the media in a
disaster context.
Some people immediately
acted to aid the crippled
Caribbean nation and to in

form the waiting world of con
ditions within. A teenaged ham
radio operator, a television
news team from the neighbor
ing island of Antigua, and a
pilot of a small Cessna plane
were three of the heroes of
post-disaster Dominica, ac
cording to Sood.
The hurricane struck on
Wed., Aug. 29, bringing with it
galeforce winds of up to 150
mph.
Periods of relative calm al
ternated with wicked winds
over a period of seven hours,
and darkness fell over the capi
tal city of Roseau even during
midday.
Vegetation and homes alike
were being demolished. The
corrugated tin roof blew off the
small house in which Fred
White, a teenager,
labored with his ham radio to
send the outside world news of
what had occurred.
Ham radio only link
His was the only signal to leave
the island for two days, and he
could not be certain that his

messages were being received
by anyone, Sood said.
Nevertheless, he continued to
transmit during the day of the
hurricane and even into the
night, despite the fact that the
country's power supply was
destroyed. The batteries he
used became increasingly
weak.
In an effort to protect his
radio from the raging storms
that entered where his roof
had been, Operator Fred took
shelter beneath a table. Soon,
his table blew away. Finally,
Fred crouched beneath an out
side wall of his house, which
had begun to fall in, and from
that spot continued sending
his messages.
The next day, Fred began
broadcasting from the Police
Station in Roseau. He was au
thorized to hook up his unit to
the only emergency power
generator on the entire island.
As there was no other way
for a message to leave
Dominica, Prime Minister
Seraphin used Fred's radio on

Thursday to send an official re
port on the condition of the na
tion to whoever might be lis
tening.
A Florida ham operator,
George Nafsinger, picked up
the message and notified the
U.S. State Department. It was
perhaps the first time that the
State Department heard and
responded to an unsubstan
tiated ham radio message,
Sood said. The Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance's
relief supplies first arrived
Saturday morning in
Dominica.
Operator Fred, who was sol
ely in charge of external com
munication, continued broad
casting through Saturday even
ing. He was the lifeblood of the
Command Center in Roseau,
and he stayed awake from
Wednesday morning to Satur
day evening.
After a night's rest he was
back on the job Sunday morn
ing — bleary-eyed, but happy
and proud.
On Friday evening, a

three-man news team
from the island of Antigua was
able to arrive at Dominica's
only airport on one of the first
commercial flights to land after
Hurricane David struck the is
land. They were unable to
travel the 40 miles to Roseau
until Sunday morning, when
the road had been cleared of
debris, mudslides and fallen
trees.
They carried with them
amateur-quality half-inch por
tapak video recording equip
ment, primitive by American
standards. Their at-home sta
tion equipment was minimal
too: it had no editing equip
ment. Therefore, everything
shot on location had to be shot
sequentially with no extrane
ous footage.
But what they lacked in
equipment they made up for in
editorial style. Whereas an
American television team
might be tempted to show the
severity and extent of the hur
rican's danjage through
wounds, destruction and grief,
the Antigua team did not, ac
cording to Sood.
Instead, their emphasis was
on the improvements and the
good that was being done to
counteract the harm.
Film shows good, not harm
Only their program's opening
scene showed destruction —
but even that was a panoramic
distant shot of Roseau's roof
less houses. Next were inter
views with Prime Minister

Seraphin and Operator Fred.
Seraphin spoke of the urgent
needs of his country, while
Fred White was shown to be
the hero that he was.
At the hospital, the news
team refused to show the vic
tims waiting for medical atten
tion; instead they showed
sailors from a visiting British
naval ship repairing the roof.
The Program Director of the
Antigua news team, Frank
Liburd, gave a complete pic
ture of the disaster in his
coverage, but he emphasized
the positive efforts of the citi
zens and of heroes such as
Fred White. By taking this tack
he was a hero himself, Sood
said.
In a very different manner,
one other hero aided
Dominica in its first days of
crisis.
Another hero
Larry Galloway, the Ameri
can pilot of a small Cessna,
flew into Dominica's airport on
Friday morning. Later that day
he flew across the island to
Roseau, where there is no air
port, and was the first person
ever to land on the narrow,
damaged and curving road
outside the city. The road had
steep hills on one side, the
ocean on the other and palm
trees and telegraph poles all
along it.
One passenger reported,
"We couldn't have missed one
of the palm trees by more than
a foot." Galloway was to make
17 such landings on the same

strip of road over the next
three days.
Galloway's plane is old and its
radio is so outdated that he is
often unable to communicate
with airport control towers.
But that does not deter him
from landing. On one take-off
from his makeshift runway at
Roseau, he damaged his
plane's wingtip on a palm tree
stump. Undaunted by the sight
of sheet metal hanging from
the wing, or from the hazards
of piloting a damaged craft full
of passengers, he flew on to a
nearby island for repairs. He
landed without permission just
ahead of a 747 jet, which had to
overfly the runway at the very
last minute.
"This was probably the first
legitimate emergency landing I
made as far back as I can re
member," he joked.
Galloway took loads of med
ical personnel and supplies,
missionaries and media rep
resentatives into and out of
Dominica.
In addition, Galloway con
tacted loved ones who were
concerned for the safety of
those in Dominica. One even
ing he spent two hours making
long-distance calls from his
personal telephone to all parts
of the world.
Even though Galloway's wife
was expecting their second
child back in Florida within
weeks, he felt he had to help
the proud but needy inhabit
ants of the tiny damaged isle of
Dominica.

In the aftermath of a hurricane which left almost three-auarters of the population homeless, the tiny
island of Dominica found some unlikely heroes to help inhabitants and inform the world of conditions
there.
They knew it was coming,
but when Hurricane David
ravaged the tiny isle of
Dominica in late August, most
people were prevented, by the
hurricane and by their own
shock, from taking much ac
tion.
Even Prime Minister Oliver
Seraphin was stunned into in
action for more than a day.
Hurricane David was to kill
27 and injure 1000 of the is
land's 85,000 population. It left
60,000 of the inhabitants home
less. In addition, 85 percent of
the banana plantations, the is
land's major source of income,
were destroyed.
Rahul Sood, doctoral stu
dent, and Prof. Everett Rogers,
both of the Department of
Communication here, arrived
in Dominica two days after the
hurricane hit to do a field study
on the role of the media in a
disaster context.
Some people immediately
acted to aid the crippled
Caribbean nation and to in

form the waiting world of con
ditions within. A teenaged ham
radio operator, a television
news team from the neighbor
ing island of Antigua, and a
pilot of a small Cessna plane
were three of the heroes of
post-disaster Dominica, ac
cording to Sood.
The hurricane struck on
Wed., Aug. 29, bringing with it
galeforce winds of up to 150
mph.
Periods of relative calm al
ternated with wicked winds
over a period of seven hours,
and darkness fell over the capi
tal city of Roseau even during
midday.
Vegetation and homes alike
were being demolished. The
corrugated tin roof blew off the
small house in which Fred
White, a teenager,
labored with his ham radio to
send the outside world news of
what had occurred.
Ham radio only link
His was the only signal to leave
the island for two days, and he
could not be certain that his

messages were being received
by anyone, Sood said.
Nevertheless, he continued to
transmit during the day of the
hurricane and even into the
night, despite the fact that the
country's power supply was
destroyed. The batteries he
used became increasingly
weak.
In an effort to protect his
radio from the raging storms
that entered where his roof
had been, Operator Fred took
shelter beneath a table. Soon,
his table blew away. Finally,
Fred crouched beneath an out
side wall of his house, which
had begun to fall in, and from
that spot continued sending
his messages.
The next day, Fred began
broadcasting from the Police
Station in Roseau. He was au
thorized to hook up his unit to
the only emergency power
generator on the entire island.
As there was no other way
for a message to leave
Dominica, Prime Minister
Seraphin used Fred's radio on

Thursday to send an official re
port on the condition of the na
tion to whoever might be lis
tening.
A Florida ham operator,
George Nafsinger, picked up
the message and notified the
U.S. State Department. It was
perhaps the first time that the
State Department heard and
responded to an unsubstan
tiated ham radio message,
Sood said. The Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance's
relief supplies first arrived
Saturday morning in
Dominica.
Operator Fred, who was sol
ely in charge of external com
munication, continued broad
casting through Saturday even
ing. He was the lifeblood of the
Command Center in Roseau,
and he stayed awake from
Wednesday morning to Satur
day evening.
After a night's rest he was
back on the job Sunday morn
ing — bleary-eyed, but happy
and proud.
On Friday evening, a

three-man news team
from the island of Antigua was
able to arrive at Dominica's
only airport on one of the first
commercial flights to land after
Hurricane David struck the is
land. They were unable to
travel the 40 miles to Roseau
until Sunday morning, when
the road had been cleared of
debris, mudslides and fallen
trees.
They carried with them
amateur-quality half-inch por
tapak video recording equip
ment, primitive by American
standards. Their at-home sta
tion equipment was minimal
too: it had no editing equip
ment. Therefore, everything
shot on location had to be shot
sequentially with no extrane
ous footage.
But what they lacked in
equipment they made up for in
editorial style. Whereas an
American television team
might be tempted to show the
severity and extent of the hur
rican's danjage through
wounds, destruction and grief,
the Antigua team did not, ac
cording to Sood.
Instead, their emphasis was
on the improvements and the
good that was being done to
counteract the harm.
Film shows good, not harm
Only their program's opening
scene showed destruction —
but even that was a panoramic
distant shot of Roseau's roof
less houses. Next were inter
views with Prime Minister

Seraphin and Operator Fred.
Seraphin spoke of the urgent
needs of his country, while
Fred White was shown to be
the hero that he was.
At the hospital, the news
team refused to show the vic
tims waiting for medical atten
tion; instead they showed
sailors from a visiting British
naval ship repairing the roof.
The Program Director of the
Antigua news team, Frank
Liburd, gave a complete pic
ture of the disaster in his
coverage, but he emphasized
the positive efforts of the citi
zens and of heroes such as
Fred White. By taking this tack
he was a hero himself, Sood
said.
In a very different manner,
one other hero aided
Dominica in its first days of
crisis.
Another hero
Larry Galloway, the Ameri
can pilot of a small Cessna,
flew into Dominica's airport on
Friday morning. Later that day
he flew across the island to
Roseau, where there is no air
port, and was the first person
ever to land on the narrow,
damaged and curving road
outside the city. The road had
steep hills on one side, the
ocean on the other and palm
trees and telegraph poles all
along it.
One passenger reported,
"We couldn't have missed one
of the palm trees by more than
a foot." Galloway was to make
17 such landings on the same

strip of road over the next
three days.
Galloway's plane is old and its
radio is so outdated that he is
often unable to communicate
with airport control towers.
But that does not deter him
from landing. On one take-off
from his makeshift runway at
Roseau, he damaged his
plane's wingtip on a palm tree
stump. Undaunted by the sight
of sheet metal hanging from
the wing, or from the hazards
of piloting a damaged craft full
of passengers, he flew on to a
nearby island for repairs. He
landed without permission just
ahead of a 747 jet, which had to
overfly the runway at the very
last minute.
"This was probably the first
legitimate emergency landing I
made as far back as I can re
member," he joked.
Galloway took loads of med
ical personnel and supplies,
missionaries and media rep
resentatives into and out of
Dominica.
In addition, Galloway con
tacted loved ones who were
concerned for the safety of
those in Dominica. One even
ing he spent two hours making
long-distance calls from his
personal telephone to all parts
of the world.
Even though Galloway's wife
was expecting their second
child back in Florida within
weeks, he felt he had to help
the proud but needy inhabit
ants of the tiny damaged isle of
Dominica.
