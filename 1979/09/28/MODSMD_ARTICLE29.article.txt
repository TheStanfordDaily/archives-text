# 'Gimmicks,' workshops for women in corporate world
## 
### 
New York (AP) — No lamb
venturing into the world of
corporate wolves need wander
blindly ever again. Indeed, the
mind boggles at the choices
facing a woman who wants to
learn her way around the cor
porate world.
She can attend a host of
"workshops" and "seminars"
that purport to tutor female
beginners on corporate poli
tics.
She can buy a book like
Games Mother Never Taught
You: Corporate Gamesman
ship for Women, or Winning at
Office Politics, or The Wo
man's Dress for Success Book,
or Business as a Game, or
Think Like a Man, Act Like a
Lady, Work Like a Dog. Every
body, it seems, is trying to help
— and to cash in on a good
thing: the new demand in bus
iness for women to fill execu
tive and management jobs and
the soaring number of women

with a new ambition to pursue
careers — not just jobs — in the
corporate world.
But academic and corporate
experts warn that an ambitious
woman who masters the fash
ionable "corporate games
manship" approach to getting
ahead may be doing herself
more harm than good.
"You can carry these things
too far," says Pat Carlson, a
senior management develop
ment consultant with Pruden
tial Insurance in Newark.
"What I'm finding now among
young women is more and
more concern with games
manship and not enough con
cern about doing the job."
Dr. Margaret Hennig, co
director of the graduate prog
ram in management at Sim
mons College in Boston, calls
the corporate gamesmanship
approach "gimmicky," and
adds, "You cannot deal with
sophisticated problems like

these by talking in banalities. 1 '
"I don't see that these semi
nars do much good — all this
stuff is so fundamental, so
basic, that a smart woman
picks it up instantly, ' says
Thomas Hubbard, president of
Think Career Planning Corp.
Lawrence D. Schwimmer
disagrees. Schwimmer, a 33-
year-old former food industry
executive, heads Schwim;->er
& Associates, Inc. in Chicago.
His firm offers seminars on
gamesmanship for women at
$225 a head.
"Women are in a sorry
state," Schwimmer says.
"They're not doing so well. I
give them a real-world em
phasis — here's what is really
happening to you, here's how
you're being exploited."
Schwimmer says — and
many academic and corporate
experts agree — that women
frequently lack "savvy-ness"
about the rules and customs of
the male-dominated business
world. Most of his clients, he
says, are corporations who
send women employees for
basic training.
"You'd be surprised, for in
stance, how few women have
ever asked for a raise and if
you've never asked for a raise,
you're not even considered a
serious player," Schwimmer
says.
There are other fundamen
tals that may come more slowly
to women.
"Business is a team effort
and a lot of women don't rec
ognize that — you don't have
to like every member of the
team, but you have to play with
them," says Carlson. "A lot
of women also don't under
stand the hierarchy — the
reasons to respect the chain of
command."
Paula Callery, a 16-year vete
ran of International Business
Machines who now works for
the U.S. Department of Com
merce, says "Women coming
into middle management posi
tions do need to learn how to
be team players, but I'm an
noyed at all this gimmickry."
"It troubles me to see women
set aside as a category. I don't
believe women need separate
training. There are fundamen
tal tools that men and women
can get in the same programs."
