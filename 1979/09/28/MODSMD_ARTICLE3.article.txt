# Admissions break for faculty kids discussed
## 
### Susan Essoyan 
Members of the Faculty Senate
yesterday differed over what special
consideration should be given chil
dren of faculty and staff in admission
to the University, but chose to leave
the ultimate decision to the Admis
sions Office.
Controversy arose over interpreta
tion of the annual report of the
Committee on Undergraduate Ad
missions and Financial Aid (CUAFA).
Committee Chairman jack Friedent
hal, called upon to clarify the report,
said that being a child of faculty or
staff "should be a positive factor" in
admissions.
That put status as faculty offspring
in the same category as ethnicity, a
factor which the report states is "suf
ficiently important to allow a candi
date to be favored over others who
may have somewhat better creden
tials."
Special consideration
Admissions candidates given spe
cial consideration, "all other things
being equal," include children of
alumni, those recommended by
donors and friends of the University
and those adding to the general di
versity of the class, the report said.
Friedenthal, asked by Political Sci
ence Prof. Nan Keohane to justify the
committee's stand on special con
sideration, admitted that it was a
"touchy subject," but cited its "in
stitutional value in helping attract
and keep faculty" at the University.
"None of us want to be put at a
competitive disadvantage" in re
cruitment of faculty and staff, Frie
denthal said. Prospective faculty be
lieve "one great advantage of being
at a University is that your children
get a slight break in getting in," he
added.
Tough recruiting?
SLAC Prof. Richard Taylor expres
sed concern that the committee
stand might make recruitment more
difficult because it "seems negative"
toward admission of children of fa
culty and staff.
The Admissions Office, complain
ing of the pressures it receives to
admit such applicants, had asked the
committee to determine the extent
of special consideration that should
be given. The office requested
CUAFA "publicize the policy so as to
avoid the painful confrontations that
sometimes have resulted when a
child has been denied admission."
In other action, the senate ap
proved the annual report of the
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement which provided for
systematic student evaluation of
teaching. Last March, the senate had
instituted universal end-of-the
quarter evaluation of classes.
