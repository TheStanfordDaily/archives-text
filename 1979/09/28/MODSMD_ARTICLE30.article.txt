# Terrorist activity in California on decline
## Organized crime, gangs growing 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — Or
ganized crime and motorcycle
gang activities are increasing in
California, hut there has been a
decline in terrorist and prison
gang activities, Attorney Gen
eral George Deukmejian said
Tuesday.
Deukmejian made those es
timates in discussing the for
mation of a new special pro
secutions unit in the state jus
tice Department.
He said the special prosecu
tions unit — which will consist
of six three-member teams of
attorneys and investigators —
will probably handle a total of
about 25 cases per year
statewide involving various
elements of organized crime.
Discussing what he called
"syndicate crime," Deukme
jian said there has been a sig
nificant increase in the number
of persons in California with
world groups in eastern states.
"In the last four years, ap
proximately 50 individuals with

past organized crime connec
tions have come to California,
and are living and working
here permanently," Deukme
jian said in an interview with a
small group of reporters.
"There are now around 300
people living in the state who
you would say are active in or
ganized crime because of past
criminal connections. As far as
we can tell, virtually all of them
are still engaged in illegal ac
tivities."
Deukmejian said these or
ganized crime figures are scat
tered about evenly "in all the
major metropolitan areas, ex
cept for the larger number that
have located in the Palm
Springs area.".
A lot of cash
He refused to discuss
specific individuals or crimes,
except to say it was "the usual"
organized crime activities,
"gambling, pornography, loan
sharking, narcotics, extortion,

fraud, anythingwherethere'sa
lot of cash involved."
The other division of or
ganized crime which appears
to be on the increase, Deukme
jian said, is among motorcycle
gangs. His staff estimated that
among several thousand
members of California motor
cycle gangs, there are about
1000 "hard core" criminals.
"The motorcycle gangs
seem to be increasing their ac
tivities," Deukmejian said, ad
ding that the special prosecu
tions unit on organized crime
will monitor those gangs, too.
Access gained
"They are into narcotics, ex
tortion and related crimes,"
Deukmejian said. "And there is
evidence they have, in some
instances, infiltrated local and
state law enforcement agen
cies" to gain access to police
intelligence, he added, declin
ing to give specifics.

On the brighter side,
Deukmejian said there has
been a significant reduction in
both prison gang and terrorist
activities. But he said both were
still a threat, and that he was
particularly concerned about
potential terrorist activities re
lated to the 1984 Olympics in
Los Angeles.
Prison-spawned gangs "are
not committing as many street
crimes as two years ago. We
don't see them growing sig
nificantly in size," Deukmejian
said, estimating there are
about 1100 active members of
four major prison gangs.
"On the other hand, they are
still an organized crime activ
ity, involving particularly nar
cotics and assaults." *
His staff said there about 200
"hard core" terrorists in
California, and another 2000 to
3000 persons described as
"hangers-on."
