# You've seen our ads, now why don't you come see us at the Daily?
## 
### 
Over the past week, we have used
various strategies to entice you into
visiting the Daily.
We have tried to emphasize the fact
that, contrary to popular belief, you
do not need previous experience to
work for the Daily; we will help you
learn. We've also tried to stress that
you don't have to commit all your
spare time to the job.
The way we see it, there are a certain
number of person-hours that it takes
to put out a newspaper every day. If a
relative few do it all, it takes a lot of
hard work and time, and the paper
suffers for it. But if we have a lot of
staffers, each contributing what they
can afford to give, the rest of us won't
have to work quite so much and the
paper will benefit.
There is always more to do than we
have people to do it. The larger our
staff, the more stories we'll be able to

cover and the better we'll be able to
keep you informed.
And after all, that's one of the main
reasons we're here.
It's never too late to come by our
office. If writing is not your thing,
there are other ways — photography,
layout, for instance — in which you
can be of great help.
We'll be holding workshops next
week in an effort to strengthen a few
important skills. Feel free to stop in.
