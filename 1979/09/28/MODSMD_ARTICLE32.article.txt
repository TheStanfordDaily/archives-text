# Hydrogen research: answer to energy woes?
## 
### Carlos Vidal Greth 
There has been considerable media
interest recently in the development of
hydrogen as a fuel. Certain members ot
both the press and the scientific com
munity have waxed eloquent on the po
tential of hydrogen to cure America's
energy problems.
Proponents of a hydrogen economy
claim that its use would allow existing
industries to convert from fossil fuels
with comparative ease. For instance,
converting internal combustion en
gines to hydrogen use could have less
economic impact on the automotive
industry than the wide introduction of
electric cars.
Bill Reynolds, chairman of the
Mechanical Engineering Dept. here,
takes a more conservative view:
"Though hydrogen is an interesting
fuel and burns 'clean,' it is not the im
mediate answer to this nation's energy
and environmental problems. In fact,
those who claim that it is are doing this
country a disservice," Reynolds said.
Hydrogen is not a primary energy re
source. like electricity, some other
energy source is required for its pro
duction. Solar and nuclear power can
be used to produce hydrogen, but their

application is inefficient at fhis time.
"These power sources produce elec
tricity," said Reynolds, "which in turn
will be used to get hydrogen out of wa
ter. There is a greater demand for elec
tricity than the hydrogen."
Solar-generated hydrogen
Nevertheless, both Reynolds and
Steven Boxer, asst. professor of chemis
try, feel that the use of hydrogen as a
major fuel may be crucial in the future.
Boxer is researching ways to get hydro
gen from water directly using sunlight.
His study of the two processes in cer
tain types of algae which release hydro
gen may provide the means to produce
hydrogen more efficiently.
Boxer said that his research is
biomimetic' — that he's trying to im
itate nature. "(Chemistry professor)
Richard Holm and I are the only
chemists on campus utilizing this ap
proach to the problem. Holm is con
centrating specifically on the catalytic
reaction of the enzyme."
'Not playing God'
"We're not playing God. We're trying
to develop a synthetic system, or reac
tion center, similar to the one existing
in the algae," Boxer continued.
He has produced one such center "in

a very difficult chemical synthesis." The
molecule, though still puzzling, gives
the researchers hope for future work.
"Our research has brought us further
in our knowledge of the photosynthetic
process," said Boxer. "Photosynthesis
is the use of sunlight to separate
charge. We know more about how
plants do that now."
'Long-term solutions'
Hydrogen-fuel studies are being car
ried out in many places, despite the fact
that the money invested in the research
involves long-term goals. "The big oil
companies are spending a lot of money
in certain areas of energy," Boxer said.
"We're researching long-term solu
tions to the energy prolem."
It's not surprising that energy-related
research is common. "Every time long
gas lines form, the government comes
up with extra money," claimed Boxer.
"We need energy. That's often the way
science funding works — it is a fortu
nate coincidence that what I'm in
terested in is something which is rela
tively easy to get funded."
Bulkier than gasoline
"When you burn hydrogen,' of
course, you get heat," Boxer said.
"Some ot the heat is lost, and it will

work on other products in the air to
produce by-products. It's the same
problem when you burn anything. Vet,
when you burn coal, you get a million
by-products because coal is made up of
a million things." Aside from heat loss,
burning hydrogen will produce only
one by-product — water.
Sound too good to be true? "It's been
used successfully as rocket propellant,
but it would be difficult to use it in your
car," said Reynolds. "Because of its low
energy density, it would be much bul
kier than gasoline."
There are other drawbacks. Hydro
gen's distinctive physical properties —
it is easily ignited and is a liquid only at
sub-freezing temperatures — require
special handling.
"Nobody knows whether hydrogen
will become a major fuel," cautioned
Boxer. "It's an economic and technical
question. Hydrogen is a usable fuel
now. It depends on whether other fuels
get so expensive that hydrogen usage
will become competitive."
"I think hydrogen is definitely a fuel
of the future," Boxer said, "but who
can say what will happen in the next 100
years?"
