JACK IN THE BOX
2280 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
Open 24 hours

It's 2 a.m. and that "great"
meal you consumed 8 hours
ago in whatever food service
you were lucky enough to dine
in has just made the rounds of
your digestive system, and
now you're Hungry!
Sure, you could go
downstairs to the machines for
a fix, but somehow, to picture
yourself with a Hershey's Al
mond in one hand and a Tab in
the other just disgusts you. So,
what's a late night muncher to
do?
"Che-cha jack, Che-cha jack-
Che-cha jack, Jack in the Box?
They're really cooking now
. . Even, at 2 a.m.
Before you know it, you're in
front of the sign which quotes
the prices of the angels which
inhabit junk food heaven. The
head of the great Jack is in your
future. But, alas! Jack's head
has been stolen again, so you
must give your order to a head
less Jack.
What exactly does Jack offer
to those who are fast-food ad
dicts?
Jack offers three meal plans
geared so as to accommodate
all income brackets of those at
Stanford: very cheap, cheap,
and semi-cheap.
For the very cheap, desiring
a full meal, lack can supply a
meager meal consisting of a
hamburger for4s cents, French
fries for 40 cents, and a small
drink for 30 cents. Not quite
less than a dollar and worth
about that much. The ham
burger consists of a "bread
like" patty, not enough sauce,
and one (count 'em), one
pickle. The french fries, how
ever, are quite above the com
petitors' and are worth the
money (a Super Scoop of fries
costs a little more, but you geta
lot more).
As far as drinks are con
cerned, the usual Coke, Root
Beer, and Orange are offered.
For you junk food dieters, Tab
is also included on the menu.
For those who consider
themselves one step beyond
the lowly very cheap, and really
want to splurge, an interna
tional meal is available to you.
For 75 cents you can indulge
in a little "South of the Border"
specialty: a burrito. While it
may take a little longer, it's
worth the wait. Once you've
convinced yourself that your
face won't break out from the
grease because you reached
puberty a long time ago, you
can bite in to what may be the
highlight of your trip: a flour
tortilla (deep fried), filled with
beans, some meat and cheese.
It's usually better to add some
hot sauce.

If burritos aren't for you,
forget Mexican food. The tacos
(even the super taco) aren't
worth the wait, unless you like
cardboard semi-filled with a
concoction of lettuce, tomato,
and very little meat which
should only be eaten with your
eyes closed or in a very dark
place. (But it's not that bad, if
you're hungry).
If you're interested in a more
American meal, lack's offers
you something from the sea: A
Moby Jack. If you're smart,
you'll tell them to throw it
back. If you're not, and you
decide to try this catch, you
may regret it or you may enjoy
it, depending upon whether or
not you like the taste of fish.
This taste is by no means sub
tle.
Semi-cheap individuals can
also find happiness with jack.
Rodney Allen Rippy's old favo
rite, the Jumbo Jack still reigns
supreme in the late-night junk
food field. A hamburger patty,
two slices of cheese, lettuce,
tomatoes, four (count 'em)
four pickles, onions and "sec
ret sauce" combine to form
one of the most delicious en
trees. For those whcvfeel a little
more "piggy" the Jumbo Jack
also comes with two patties for
$1.90.
In addition to the main dish,
the person who has money to
burn can add what may Jack's
ultimate specialty: onion rings.
55 cents will buy a great
tasting, greasy ("but that's the
way I like them") bag. Take it
from an onion ring connois
seur, the competitors' are

more expensive and not nearly
as good.
A milkshake of either choco
late, vanilla, or strawberry will
complete this ultimate meal.
Two sizes are available: regu
lar and (not large) but "Big."
So, don't get confused and
order a large, just say, "I want a
Big One."
The semi-cheapster who is
trying to impress may decide
that a Jack steak is "the way to
go." Wrong. The classiness of
this entree is that it is served on
a french roll. â€¢'
However, for only a nickel
more (the steak costs $1.35)
you can bite into a juicy Jumbo
jack which is still a better deal.
Since dessert usually follows
a meal you might want to pur
use the menu for some sort of
after-dinner treat. You can
peruse all you want, but you
won't find anything worth put
ting into your mouth except
the ice left over from your
"Big" drink. The turnovers
which seem like such a deal at
40 cents look like the children
of Hostess pies.
While it may seem that some
items on the menu aren't all
that delectable, fora restaurant
that specializes in satisfying
hunger quickly, Jack's may be
tops in its field. For late night
diners and early morning mun
chers, Jack's does offer a vari
ety of foods, plus something
which no other can: the thrill
of driving up and having Jack
say "Welcome to Jack in the
Box. May I take your order,
please?"

By Dorothy and Mary
Cunningham
A long-time favorite with'
Stanford students is Mountain
Mike's Pizza, located at the
corner of Stanford Avenue and
El Camino. The rustic wood
furniture, dark red curtains and
low lighting help to create a
warm, cozy atmosphere and
make it a nice place to get away
with friends to enjoy some very
good pizza.
The thin or thick crust pizzas
in three sizes (10", 13", or 15")
can be made to order with up
to four items. These items in
clude the usual pizza staples
and special treats such as
Louisiana hot sausage and ar
tichoke hearts. Mountain
Mike's also features several
combination pizzas.
Prices range from $3.25 for a
single-item small pizza to $8.10
for a large four-item pizza or
large vegetarian pizza.
As well as serving fine pizza,
Mike's also serves delicious
baked or grilled sandwiches.
The baked sandwiches include
salami, hot tuna, pepperoni
and various cheeses, each
priced at $1.80. The grilled
sandwiches range from a h6t

dog for $1.35 to a Vi lb.
cheeseburger for $2.45. One
can also order a special
cheeseburger with Canadian
bacon.
An unusual luncheon offer
ing is Mike's pizza sandwich,
served before 5 p.m. For $1.95,
a sourdough roll comes laden
with any three pizza items,
blended cheeses, and Mike's
pizza sauce. All sandwiches are
served with lettuce, tomato
and potato chips.
Mountain Mike's small bar
offers light and dark draft beer
by the glass or pitcher and sev
eral varieties of domestic and
imported bottled beer. The
house burgundy, chablis blanc
and vin rose are sold by the
glass, carafe and half carafe. Of
course, there are also the usual
soft drinks.
The toppings for the vegeta
rian pizza are mushrooms,
olives, sliced bell peppers, ar
tichoke hearts, onions, and
decoratively arranged to
matoes.
On Wednesdays, Mountain
Mike's features "all-you-can
eat" night. For $3 plus tax
($1.50 for children under 12)
each person sits down with a
plate and helps himself to a
selection of pizzas brought
around by waiters. There are
also free refills on soft drinks.
This is a great deal and is well
patronized by University stu
dents.


For after midnight munchie attacks, "Jack's runs" are highly popular
with the student population.
