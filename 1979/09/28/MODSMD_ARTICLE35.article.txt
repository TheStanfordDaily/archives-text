Daily 7:30 a.m.-10:30 p.m.

For those whose taste buds
are beginning to crave some
thing other than dorm food,
'The Good Earth restaurant on
University Avenue provides a
pleasant switch, with its un
ique variety of natural food
dishes served in a comfortable
dining atmosphere. Setting
The Good Earth apart from its
area competitors is its refusal
to serve many overprocessed
and chemically composed
foods, replacing them with a
diversity of vegetables, fruits,
herbs, and other natural ingre
dients.
The restaurant's use of only
choice ingredients has not li
mited its selection of meals,
but on the contrary has opened
up a creative array of dishes â€”
everything from omelettes to
tostadas; and salads and to
shakes. For breakfast one may
choose from 10 whole-grain
pancakes, vegetable stuffed
omelettes, fruit-topped cre
pes, and, of course, granola.
Hot and cold sandwiches,
soups, salads, and meat, veg
etable, shrimp and chicken en
trees, are among the menu
selections for lunch and din
ner. In addition, six types of
fruit and yogurt shakes, daily
baked pastries, and assorted
desserts are available for those
with a sweet tooth. Various
teas, juices, wines and beer ac
company Good Earth dishes.

Green ferns hang lazily over
the tables against a
background of wood paneled
walls. This creates a relaxed
and easy going atmosphere for
those who enjoy eating and
talking in an unrushed man
ner. One of the most surpris
ing characteristics of the Good
Earth is the diversified crowd
that regularly attends the re
staurant. Young couples, old
couples, mothers and
daughters, students, and
businessmen can be seen scat
tered about the restaurant at
thecounter, the tables, and the
booths.

"We don't generally draw
one type of person," explained
manager Mary Wolleson, "but
anyone who is concerned
about what food goes in their
stomach."
Just about the only age
group that was absent from the
setting was small children,
whose idea of good food
doesn't usually include veget
ables.
As far as prices are con
cerned, a Mac Donald's it is
not. Yet, in view of the type of
food served and the relatively
large portions given, the prices
appear to be somewhat

reasonable with possible ex
ceptions in the entree section.
Prices run about $3 to $4 for
sandwiches, $3 to $5 for salads,
and $5 to $7 for entrees.
I would not recommend The
Good Earth to stubborn steak
and lobster lovers, picky pizza
pushers, fast food freaks, or
those who go into prolonged
periods of depression when
their parents make them eat
vegetables. This restaurant will
only appeal to those who enjoy
the wholesome, natural and
fresh taste of those foods
which come from the good
earth.
