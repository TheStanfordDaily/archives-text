THE VILLAGE CHEESE HOUSE
157 Town and Country Village
Palo Alto
Mon.-Sat. 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m.

Small specialty food shops
often tend to come across too
strong. Gimmicky ideas and
crazy costumes are often to be
found trying to attract custom
ers. The food is then often
mediocre to poor because so
much time has been spent on
decoration that taste is ig
nored.
But do not despair. Occa
sionally one finds a place that
offers the combination of a
satisfying quick lunch and a
convenient and wide-ranged
munchies section.
The Village Cheese House is
one of these rare places.
Tucked away in the pleas
antly landscaped Town and
Country Village, The Village
Cheese House offers the cus
tomer two major types of culi
nary satisfaction.
The Village Cheese House is
a satisfying and inexpensive al
ternative to the University food
service.
Several types of sandwiches
are available. Pastrami, corned
beef, turkey, and roast beef are
the major attractions. Each one
is served on either white or
pumpernickel, and is replete
with cheese. The more than
generous portions of meat are
complimented by a special
sauce that is delicious in its

own right. The prices are fair,
ranging from $1.95 to $2.05.
A sandwich accompanied by
a serving of quality cole slaw
can be best topped by a slice of
enticing and delicious carrot
rum cake. Random examina
tion showed that everything
from bread to cake was fresh.
Although many take out,
your meal can be enjoyed most
by eating it on a bench beneath
palm trees just outside the
shop. Quiet and pleasant sur
roundings make this quick
lunch even more enjoyable.
The second, and more
abundant offering, is a com
plete and impressive selection
of entertaining foods. Beneath
the raftered ceiling and amidst
the colonial decoration there
are a variety of spices, crac

kers, cheeses, and other fine
foods that fill the Village
Cheese House with a delici
ously appetizing aroma. This is
the ideal spot for one who
plans on having a party and
wants to impress his guests
without going to any great
cost.
Cheeses range from exotic
to ordinary, as does the choice
of crackers, breads and pates.
Without being an exclusive
gourmet shop, the Village
Cheese House brings
specialized and delicious food
to the surrounding commun
ity.
The Village Cheese House
is highly recommended as a
place to grab a quick and satis
tying meal, and to stock up for
a stylish and unforgettable get
together.


Fine food delicacies and delectable deli sandwiches combine to make
the Village Cheese House a good lunch stop.
