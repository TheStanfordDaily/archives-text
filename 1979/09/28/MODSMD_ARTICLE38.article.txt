tures fair to brilliant perfor
mances and uneven direction
from Mike Nichols. Nichols
doesn't quite know what to
do with the material; he's torn
between making it "shock

The Seven-Percent Solution
Friday, Kresge * * ★
Director Herbert Ross has
received far more acclaim for
his later two pictures, The
Turning Point and Goodbye
Girl, but this 1976 effort, is I
think much more enjoyable.
Ross lets his superb cast strut
in this movie version of
Nicholas Meyer's bestseller
about an encounter between
Sherlock Holmes and Sig
mund Freud. Holmes is with
Freud in Vienna to rid himself
of his addiction to cocaine.
But quickly, this unlikely pair
find themselves in the midst
of a plot to begin World War I
a decade early. Nicol William
son and Alan Arkin make a
great team as Holmes and
Freud, respectively, but Laur
ence Olivier nearly steals the
show with a wonderfully off

beat cameo appearance as a
comic Dr. Moriarty.

A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless
you plan to think about it and
not just bask in its glow. Artful
black-and-white cinematog
raphy combines with new di
recting skills and a fresh at
titude toward filmmaking to
provide a sensitive portrayal
of the struggle for farmers'
rights in North Dakota in 1915
and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors ap
pear in this winner of the
Cannes Golden Camera
award for the best first feature
this year. See it for its human
characterizations and poig
nant plot. A thinking person's
movie.

Tree of the Wooden Clogs
Bijou, Palo Alto * ★ ★
Those of you who returned
from the overseas campus at
Florence without getting a
chance to see the Italian
countryside, here's your
chance. This film, a tableau of
the peasants' life in Italy at the
turn of the century, recreates
the colors and smells and tex
tures of the farmers' simple
lives and touching, human
needs as vividly as if you had
been there yourself. A fairly
straightforward but nonethe
less well-made film with
sparse subtitles because the
pictures say it all.

The Seduction of foe Tynan
Palo Alto Square ★ ★ ★
Alan Alda plays a dashing
young liberal senator from
New York whose rising career
begins to leave his wife and
daughter behind. Meryl
Streep plays a talented lob
byist who picks up the loose
ends of Alda's life. But in the
end, well, we'll find out by
Thanksgiving. A good film
probing the problems of
being both a politician and a
person.

A Day a' the Races ★ ★ ★
Saturday, Bishop Aud.
Not the fjest Marx Brothers
comedy ever made, but direc
tor Sam Wood manages to
maintain some needed sanity
amid the craziness and
Groucho, Chico and Harpo
provide enough wild mo
ments to keep things bounc
ing along. Groucho's in
charge of an insane asylum;
his major qualification for the
job is that he's also a horse
doctor. Chico's a "loveable"
ice cream man, and Harpo is a
jockey. But of course.

The Great Dictator ★ ★ ★
Saturday, Mem Aud
Chaplin's satire of Hitler is
more like an attack, especially
in the closing sequences. Hi
tler is a buffoon here, and
Mussolini (of course) is
worse. Many truly great
scenes, including one where
Chaplin as Hitler wistfully

contemplates a balloon
model of the world, dreaming
of conquest. Chaplin's too
long speechifying about
peace and love in the closing
moments almost kills the
movie; if s as if Chaplin doesn't
realize that everything that
movie has already done is

worth far more than anything
a five-minute speech could
offer.

Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a
necessary one. Here, Allen
begins to deal with the prob
lems he so completely solves
in his latest movie, the ex
traordinary Manhattan. This

schematic, tragic story of a
family in crisis is purposefully
sterile; Woody forces himself
to repress his comic side.
What results is painful, un
even — yet often, somehow,
brilliant.
Woody's errors here are
those of a man who's more
than a little unsure of himself;
he overplays obvious sym
bolism, and his attempts for
Bergmanesque touches are,
more often than not, flaccid
imitations. Vet Woody coaxes
great performances from a
superb ensemble cast, and
Maureen Stapleton literally
stands out as the only person
to bring color and vibrancy to
the otherwise pale and lifeless
family in the film.

The Seven-Percent Solution
Friday, Kresge * * ★
Director Herbert Ross has
received far more acclaim for
his later two pictures, The
Turning Point and Goodbye
Girl, but this 1976 effort, is I
think much more enjoyable.
Ross lets his superb cast strut
in this movie version of
Nicholas Meyer's bestseller
about an encounter between
Sherlock Holmes and Sig
mund Freud. Holmes is with
Freud in Vienna to rid himself
of his addiction to cocaine.
But quickly, this unlikely pair
find themselves in the midst
of a plot to begin World War I
a decade early. Nicol William
son and Alan Arkin make a
great team as Holmes and
Freud, respectively, but Laur
ence Olivier nearly steals the
show with a wonderfully off

beat cameo appearance as a
comic Dr. Moriarty.

the colors and smells and tex

Chaplin's satire of Hitler is
more like an attack, especially
in the closing sequences. Hi
tler is a buffoon here, and
Mussolini (of course) is
worse. Many truly great
scenes, including one where
Chaplin as Hitler wistfully

contemplates a balloon
model of the world, dreaming
of conquest. Chaplin's too
long speechifying about
peace and love in the closing

movie; if s as if Chaplin doesn't

Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a
necessary one. Here, Allen
begins to deal with the prob
lems he so completely solves
in his latest movie, the ex
traordinary Manhattan. This

schematic, tragic story of a
family in crisis is purposefully
sterile; Woody forces himself
to repress his comic side.
What results is painful, un
even — yet often, somehow,
brilliant.
Woody's errors here are
those of a man who's more
than a little unsure of himself;
he overplays obvious sym
bolism, and his attempts for
Bergmanesque touches are,
more often than not, flaccid
imitations. Vet Woody coaxes
great performances from a
superb ensemble cast, and
Maureen Stapleton literally
stands out as the only person
to bring color and vibrancy to
the otherwise pale and lifeless
family in the film.

worth seeing; lack Nicholson
and, surprisingly, Ann-

Margret, are extremely good.

The Seven-Percent Solution
Friday, Kresge * * ★
Director Herbert Ross has
received far more acclaim for
his later two pictures, The
Turning Point and Goodbye
Girl, but this 1976 effort, is I
think much more enjoyable.
Ross lets his superb cast strut
in this movie version of
Nicholas Meyer's bestseller
about an encounter between
Sherlock Holmes and Sig
mund Freud. Holmes is with
Freud in Vienna to rid himself
of his addiction to cocaine.
But quickly, this unlikely pair
find themselves in the midst
of a plot to begin World War I
a decade early. Nicol William
son and Alan Arkin make a
great team as Holmes and
Freud, respectively, but Laur
ence Olivier nearly steals the
show with a wonderfully off

beat cameo appearance as a
comic Dr. Moriarty.

Northern Lights ★ * * *
Surf, San Francisco
A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless
you plan to think about it and
not just bask in its glow. Artful
black-and-white cinematog
raphy combines with new di
recting skills and a fresh at
titude toward filmmaking to
provide a sensitive portrayal
of the struggle for farmers'
rights in North Dakota in 1915
and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors ap
pear in this winner of the
Cannes Golden Camera
award for the best first feature
this year. See it for its human
characterizations and poig
nant plot. A thinking person's
movie.

Tree of the Wooden Clogs
Bijou, Palo Alto * ★ ★
Those of you who returned
from the overseas campus at
Florence without getting a
chance to see the Italian
countryside, here's your
chance. This film, a tableau of
the peasants' life in Italy at the
turn of the century, recreates
the colors and smells and tex
tures of the farmers' simple
lives and touching, human
needs as vividly as if you had
been there yourself. A fairly
straightforward but nonethe
less well-made film with
sparse subtitles because the
pictures say it all.

The Seduction of foe Tynan
Palo Alto Square ★ ★ ★
Alan Alda plays a dashing
young liberal senator from
New York whose rising career
begins to leave his wife and
daughter behind. Meryl
Streep plays a talented lob
byist who picks up the loose
ends of Alda's life. But in the
end, well, we'll find out by
Thanksgiving. A good film
probing the problems of
being both a politician and a
person.

A Day a' the Races ★ ★ ★
Saturday, Bishop Aud.
Not the fjest Marx Brothers
comedy ever made, but direc
tor Sam Wood manages to
maintain some needed sanity
amid the craziness and
Groucho, Chico and Harpo
provide enough wild mo
ments to keep things bounc
ing along. Groucho's in
charge of an insane asylum;
his major qualification for the
job is that he's also a horse
doctor. Chico's a "loveable"
ice cream man, and Harpo is a
jockey. But of course.

The Great Dictator ★ ★ ★
Saturday, Mem Aud
Chaplin's satire of Hitler is
more like an attack, especially
in the closing sequences. Hi
tler is a buffoon here, and
Mussolini (of course) is
worse. Many truly great
scenes, including one where
Chaplin as Hitler wistfully

contemplates a balloon
model of the world, dreaming
of conquest. Chaplin's too
long speechifying about
peace and love in the closing
moments almost kills the
movie; if s as if Chaplin doesn't
realize that everything that
movie has already done is

worth far more than anything
a five-minute speech could
offer.

Manhattan ★ ★ ★ ★
Park, Menlo Park
Woody Allen completes his
'70s trilogy with a film that will
rank as one of the few mas
terpieces of this decade.
Manhattan, a bitterly funny
examination of both a city and
a lifestyle, is both hilarious
and oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen.
Starring Woody Allen, Diane
Keaton, Michael Murphy,
Mariel Hemingway and Meryl
Streep. Written by Woody
Allen and Marshall Brickman.
Photography by Gordon Wil

Interiors ★ ★ ★
Park, Mcnlo Park
Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a
necessary one. Here, Allen
begins to deal with the prob
lems he so completely solves
in his latest movie, the ex
traordinary Manhattan. This

schematic, tragic story of a
family in crisis is purposefully
sterile; Woody forces himself
to repress his comic side.
What results is painful, un
even — yet often, somehow,
brilliant.
Woody's errors here are
those of a man who's more
than a little unsure of himself;
he overplays obvious sym
bolism, and his attempts for
Bergmanesque touches are,
more often than not, flaccid
imitations. Vet Woody coaxes
great performances from a
superb ensemble cast, and
Maureen Stapleton literally
stands out as the only person
to bring color and vibrancy to
the otherwise pale and lifeless
family in the film.

The Wanderers, an inti

Excellent ★★★★

Fair ★★
Better than TV ★
Guano

'60s, is my candidate for the
summer's best movie.
This movie's closest
brother is The Deer Hunter —
in theme, not degree of grim
ness. Gang warfare has been
substituted for The Deer
Hunter's Vietnam sequences,
but the same emphasis on

male camaraderie and of fate'
set seemingly irrevocably by'
the characters'
is present here.
But the "look" of this film is
like that of no other. Director
Phillip Kaufman creates his
own personal New York City,
filled with grotesques and oc-i
casional flashes of warmth.

Formula James Bond — it
looks as if this movie was,,
made from a recipe instead of ;
from a script. Take one
of Roger Moore (whatever
you say, I still like Connery
better) one major vidian, one
major femme fatale (in this
case, Lois Chiles, who seems
fine until she speaks) and a
gimmicky plot and you can
make your very own lames
Bond movie.
