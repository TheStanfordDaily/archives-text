Education department okayed
Washington — I he House gave approval yes
terday to a bill creating a new Department of
Education and sent the measure to President
Jimmy Carter.
The House voted 215-201 to create the 13th
Cabinet agency. During his 1976 campaign,
Carter had promised to place the govern
ment's education programs within a single
new agency.
The Senate passed the measure Monday.
The measure will reduce the size of the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare
and will rename the agency the Department ot
Health and Human Resources.
The new department is the second created
during Carter s term. Ihe Energy Department
was established in 1977.
Under the legislation, more than 150 federal
programs will be transferred to the new
agency.
The new department will have a budget ex
ceeding $14 billion and will have about 18,000
employees.
After the House vote, Carter called it "a sig
nificant milestone in my effort to make the
federal government more efficient." He said
the new department would give the American
people "a much clearer picture of what the
federal government is doing in education and
who is in charge of those activities."
justices' salaries frozen
Sacramento — A Superior Court judge said
yesterday the California Supreme Court has
violated a state constitutional requirement to
rule on all c ases within 90 days, and ordered
the justices' salaries cut off.
The stunning decision by judge Joseph
Babich apparently is without precedent in
California. It was made in response to a suit by
the law and Order Campaign Committee,
which sought unsuccesstully last year to defeat
Chief lustice Rose Bud at the polls.
The constitutional provision saying |udges
may not be paid it cases are held longer than 90
days after they are submitted is based on "a

theory, according to the Bible, that if you don't
work, you don't eat," Babich said.
State Controller Ken Cory, the defendant in
the suit, said he disagreed with the decision
but probably wouldn't appeal it. He said he has
asked the seven justices to return paychecks
that were mailed Wednesday, totaling about
$40,000 for one month.
Bird was on vacation, and other court offi
cials declined comment.
The committee listed 24 cases that it said
have been before the court for more than 90
days without a ruling.
Babich issued a preliminary injunction or
dering Cory, who issues the state's paychecks,
not to pay Supreme Court justices until he has
determined independently that they have no
cases that were submitted more than 90 days
ago.
No retrial for Huey Newton
Oakland, Calif. — Black Panther leader Huey
Newton will not be tried a third time on
charges of murdering an Oakland prostitute in
1974, a judge ruled yesterday on the motion of
Newton's prosecutor.
Atter two trials ended with hung juries, pro
secutor Tom Orloff asked Alameda County
Superior Court fudge Donald McCullum,
"with regret," to dismiss the charges against
Newton.
In dismissing the case, McCullum saidl his
was trial by jury. I his is all our system offers."
McCullum declared a mistrial Tuesday after
a jury deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal. Last
March, another jury deadlocked 10-2 for ac
quittal in the case involving the 1974 shooting
death of Kathleen Smith, 17.
"The government lias been trying tor 12
years to put me in jail for my political beliefs,"
Newton said after the court hearing. "Now I
can live my life until they charge me with some
thing else."
That wasn't exactly the case since he is Iree
on $1 30,000 hail pending the appeal of a con
viction last year on an illegal weapons charge.
Newton said he planned to increase the
Black Panthers' "political activity," including

voter registration drives and educational prog
rams.
House approves '80 budget
Washington — T he House finally approved a
1 980 budget yesterday, but apparently not in
time to resolve differences with the Senate
over delense spending before the start of the
new fiscal year next week.
By a 212-206 margin, the House passed a
$548.2 billion budget, only slightly leaner than
the spending package that the lawmakers re
jected last week. Republicans unanimously
opposed the budget measure.
The Senate version of the budget calls for
$546..1 billion in spending and differs from the
House budget by calling for sharply higher out
lays for defense and c uts in social programs.
That means the 1980 fiscal year will begin
Monday without a firm budget ceiling in place.
But the lac k of a budget ceiling is not expected
to affect the day-to-day operation ot govern
ment since Congress can still appropriate
money.

Ihe Panama Canal treaties, ending a year-long

/one over to Panama on Monday. Other canal

The legislation sets up a U.S.-controlled

House approves '80 budget
Washington — T he House finally approved a
1 980 budget yesterday, but apparently not in
time to resolve differences with the Senate
over delense spending before the start of the
new fiscal year next week.
By a 212-206 margin, the House passed a
$548.2 billion budget, only slightly leaner than
the spending package that the lawmakers re
jected last week. Republicans unanimously
opposed the budget measure.
The Senate version of the budget calls for
$546..1 billion in spending and differs from the
House budget by calling for sharply higher out
lays for defense and c uts in social programs.
That means the 1980 fiscal year will begin
Monday without a firm budget ceiling in place.
But the lac k of a budget ceiling is not expected
to affect the day-to-day operation ot govern
ment since Congress can still appropriate
money.

similar to those worn by Beatles at various

use the name of the Beatles."
Fie said the suit seeks $30 million in compen

Washington — I he House gave approval yes
terday to a bill creating a new Department of
Education and sent the measure to President
Jimmy Carter.
The House voted 215-201 to create the 13th

ment's education programs within a single
new agency.
The Senate passed the measure Monday.
The measure will reduce the size of the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare

justices' salaries frozen
Sacramento — A Superior Court judge said
yesterday the California Supreme Court has
violated a state constitutional requirement to
rule on all c ases within 90 days, and ordered
the justices' salaries cut off.
The stunning decision by judge Joseph
Babich apparently is without precedent in
California. It was made in response to a suit by
the law and Order Campaign Committee,
which sought unsuccesstully last year to defeat
Chief lustice Rose Bud at the polls.
The constitutional provision saying |udges
may not be paid it cases are held longer than 90
days after they are submitted is based on "a

theory, according to the Bible, that if you don't
work, you don't eat," Babich said.
State Controller Ken Cory, the defendant in
the suit, said he disagreed with the decision
but probably wouldn't appeal it. He said he has
asked the seven justices to return paychecks
that were mailed Wednesday, totaling about
$40,000 for one month.
Bird was on vacation, and other court offi
cials declined comment.
The committee listed 24 cases that it said
have been before the court for more than 90
days without a ruling.
Babich issued a preliminary injunction or
dering Cory, who issues the state's paychecks,
not to pay Supreme Court justices until he has
determined independently that they have no
