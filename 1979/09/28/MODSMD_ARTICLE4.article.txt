# T-shirt sale rekindles fire
## Mascot controversy resumes 
### loan O'Connell 
After seven years of hearing sports
teams here called Cardinals, Trees,
Griffins and Robber Barons, a group
of alumni are once again pushing
hard to "bring Chief Lightfoot back
to the Farm."
The simmering mascot issue has
varied in intensity since President
Richard Lyman halted the use of the
Indian as the mascot in 1972 follow
ing the protest of 55 native American
students and said it would never be
officially associated with the Univer
sity as long as hecontinued in office
The issue has been brought up to
the front burners this fall, however,
as a group of Indian mascot suppor
ters have financed the printing and
distribution of T-shirts encouraging
support for their cause.
The selling of the shirts at 21 area
stores and a publicity campaign
launched as the football season
began has once again brought the

administration, members of the na
tive American community, other
students and alumni into disagree
ment over the issue.
Former performer
At the head of the movement to
bring back the Indian mascot is
Eureka attorney Timrn Williams who
pertormed, in costume, at home
football games for 21 years as the
symbol of athletic teams here until
1972 when Lyman banned his pre
sence on the field.
'•ams, a member of the Yurok
triue, said Wednesday Lyman in
sulted native Americans when he
stated that "an Indian will never ap
pearon this (Stanford's) field again."
Since 1972, Williams, who is active
in native American affairs and cur
rently serves as chairman of the
California Rural Indian Health Board,
has let it be known to members of
native American groups and alumni
that if they ever need his help to try to
regain the Indian as the symbol of the
University, he "will be ready."
No statement
Williams said he has attended
every Stanford home game, but he
denies that, at the times he has ap
peared in Indian garb, he was making
any statement. "Sometimes I would
be coming straight from Indian busi
ness," Williams said.
He also has been contacted occa
sionally by groups like the New
Founders League who wish to
reinstate the Indian as mascot. In
1975 he was asked to attend and per

form at what turned out to be the last
Big Came bonfire.
Of late, Williams has been working
with Palo Alto insurance executive
Larry Ziebell who is head of an un
named group of "Chief Lightfoot"
supporters who are marketing the
T-shirts and trying to organize sup
port for reinstating the Indian.
Return to yesteryear
Through the sale of the shirts and a
publicity campaign with ads urging
readers to "return with us now to the
thrilling days of yesteryear," the
group hopes to mount a strong at
tack against the administration, par
ticularly Lyman.
Ziebell claimed Lyman "backed
down from his first test as president'
in 1972 and that the protesting sfu
dents were just a "radical minority
who do not speak for the Indians."
Both Williams and Ziebell said that
in the native American culture, the
young do not normally criticize the
decisions of their elders, so any
group of young native Americans
speaking out on their affairs is not
representative ot the opinions of na
tive Americans as a whole.
Outrage
Stanford American Indian Organi
zation spokesman Francis Robert
was adamant in insisting that native
American students on campus are
outraged at the recent moves to
reinstate "Chief Lightfoot" and at the
sale of the T-shirts.
Robert said native Americans do
not want their race used as enter
tainment. Native Americans here are
also strongly opposed to "Chief
Lightfoot" who they feel is "out ot
touch with the native American
community at Stanford." "Per
forming a 'sacred ritual dance' at a
football game takes it totally out of
context," he said. "People going to a
football game don't understand the
prayers and rituals which go along
with the dances. All they see is some
guy jumping around, and they
laugh."
No change
University policy on the issue has
not changed since 1972. Director ot
University Relations Don Carlson,
who has worked closely with Lyman
on the issue since the beginning,
said the opinion of the University
was clear.
"We are absolutely opposed to
using a human being for a mascot or
using a racial symbol to represent the
University," he said.
Carlson also denied claims by both
Williams and Ziebell that the support
from native American leaders was
equal if not greater than the native
American students' dissatisfaction
on the matter.
"We received some mail from In
dian leaders in support ot Lighttoot
but nothing compared to that from
Indians who felt hurt that their race
had been used as entertainment,"
said Carlson.

T-shirts bearing a representation of former University mascot Chief Lightfoot are
being sold in area stores by a group of people hoping to have the Indian reinstated
as the University mascot. University officials have informed the stores of their
objection to the move.
The administration has not ig
nored the marketing of the Lightfoot
T-shirts. Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig has sent a
letter to stores carrying the shirts
stating the University does not en
dorse the sale of the shirts.
"Many of us at Stanford find this
latest promotion both sad and dis
tasteful," the letter states.
While Ziebell refers to
Rosenzweig's letter to the stores as
"strongarming" methods, it appa
rently has not dissuaded the stores
from selling the shirts. Ziebell said
that seven more stores will be added
to those now selling them.
Gene Ihistle, manager of Russel-
Huston Packers, a men's clothing
store in Palo Alto which carries the
shirts, said his store considers the
promotion to be a "tun" thing. He
also said if the University asks him to
stop carrying the T-shirts, he will.
Thistle said, however, that he is
not trying to make any sort of state
ment by carrying the shirts and, as
several of the other store managers
who are carrying them have said, will
discontinue the promotion if it be
comes a major issue.
