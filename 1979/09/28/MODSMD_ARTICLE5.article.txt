# University tries four-day week

### David Eisner 
Some University departments
have instituted an experimental
four-day, 10-hour-per-day work
week in the past three months, ac
cording to Felix Barthelemy, man
ager of employee relations.
The California State Labor Code of
1978, in effect since )an. 1, 1979,
specifies that an employer can estab
lish such a schedule. Workers may
participate in the program either
voluntarily or after two-thirds of t heir
fellow workers vote for the plan.
If the workers vote against the
plan, the employer must give over
time pay to employees who work
more than the eight-hour day pre
scribed in state and federal contract
laws.
Barthelemy said the departments
experimenting with the program
are doing so with individual volun
teers. No staff votes have been held.
The 4/10 plan was one of several
suggestions William Massy, vice
president for business and finance,
presented in June in response to the
gas shortage.
Gas saved
Gasoline is indeed being con*
served, said Jean Brolan of the Staff
Benefits Office, now using the sys
tem. In that small department, 80
percent of eligible employees are
taking advantage of the plan.
"It saves wasted traveling time,
too," Brolan said.
Yet Brolan, Barthelemy and Massy
remain non-commital about the
program's success, saying it is too
soon to get accurate feedback.
"If there were problems I'm sure I
would hear about it," Massy said. He
hasn't, he added.
Begun last week
Marcelo Canelas . director of ad
ministrative records, said his de

partment, the Development Office,
began the trial period Sept. 17. The
plan will lose experimental status
there on Dec. 14 when workers will
decide whether it will continue per
manently.
Of the 27 eligible employees in this
office, 18 have volunteered to work a
four-day week.

The department still remains open
live days a week. The extra day is
given to each employee on "rota
tional preference," the employees
signing up for the day they would
prefer not to work.
"So far, there haven't been any
conflicts," Canelas said. "I hope it
works."
