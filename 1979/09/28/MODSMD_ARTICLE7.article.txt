# City loses century-old cable cars
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — The
decision to close down the
city's creaking Victorian
cable cars for a long
overdue renovation may
change the character of San
Francisco for years to come,
officials said this week.
But like surgeons faced
with a long and potentially
delicate operation, transit
authorities saw no alterna
tive less than the demise of
the patient.
Silenced early Wednes
day were the grinding of the
subterranean cables pulling
the open-air cars over hills
and the bells that have rung
out over Chinatown, North
Beach and Nob Hill for more
than a century.
Transit officials said safety
problems were so pervasive
they could no longer be put
off until a two-year shut
down scheduled for late
'1981.
Currently, plans call for
two of the city's three lines
to be out of service for
seven to eight months while
they are brought up to
safety standards. The third
line could reopen in a
month.
The complete renovation
could take years and cost
$41 million.
"There isn't any question
in my mind that it isn't a safe
system," said Oral Moore,
chief engineer of the Public
Utility Commission (PUC)
and the man who recom
mended the shutdown
Tuesday.
"The whole system is an
tiquated. . . . We've been
patching and patching and
patching and it just won't
patch anymore," said Gil
bert Repp, of the Municipal
Railway.
PUC director Richard

Sklar left for Washington
Wednesday to discuss fund
ing with federal officials.
The system was declared a
national historical landmark
in 1964.
The three rickety lines,
basically unchanged since
1873, carry more than 13
million passengers a year —
70 percent of them tourists.
To combat periodic
suggestions that the city
scrap the cars, the city char
ter was revised in the late
1950s to stipulate that the
cable cars must run "in per
petuity."
But with the ravages of
time, inflation and a rapidly
changing technology,
"perpetuity" has become a
tall order.
"We could open up the

line after this round ot re
pairs and the cars could run,
but unless we make the total
overhaul, it is doubtful that
the system has a future,"
Moore said.
In many ways, the cable
cars have become a victim
of their own success, offi
cials said.
)am-packed day and
night, the frail vehicles fill a
year's use every 45 days, ac
cording to one expert's es
timate. They become in
creasingly vulnerable to
breakdown as the number
of trained cable-car
mechanics dwindle and it
becomes more difficult to
find new parts.
The system is also a victim
of the times.
While accidents do hap

pen because ot mechanical
failures — the mechanism
of one tar jammed in 1976
hurtling 10 people into the
street and injuring 1H —
many injuries occur when
riders step off the 19th Cen
tury cars into the 20th Cen
tury traffic.
Robert Rockwell, a
spokesman for the Munici
pal Railway, predicted:
"The dramatic effect of the
cable car shutdown will be
on the number of visitors
who come to San Francisco
each year."
To soften the disap
pointment of visitors and
encourage them not to
abandon the city, officials
plan to haul cable cars to the
end of each line every morn
ing so tourists can climb on
and take pictures.
