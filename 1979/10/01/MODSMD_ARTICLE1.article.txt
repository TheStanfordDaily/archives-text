# Faculty housing shortage puts crimp on staff recruitment drive
## 
### Susan Essoyan 
The housing shortage, more than
anything else, impeded recruitment
of faculty and staff here, University
President Richard Lyman told the
Academic Council at its meeting Fri
day.
The housing problem also raised at
last week's Faculty Senate meeting,
concerns "new and, especially,
young faculty (who) can't attord
housing in the area," Physics Prof.
Walter Meyerhof said.
The University recognizes a "vital
needi' to sustain a steady influx of
young talent and is doing all it can to
ameliorate the effects of the housing
shortage, but it can't solve the prob
lem, Lyman said.
"We are moving as rapidly as is
consistent with the requirements of
decent planning and political prac
ticalities to create something on the
order of 140 new units of housing on
Peter Coutts Hill," he added.
Peter Coutts Hill lies on University
land between the industrial park and
present faculty housing. The housing
project on the hill has been fraught
with problems.
"Neighbors want open space left
at the top of the hill," Provost Donald

"The region needs housing, but
it's difficult to get it through," Ken
nedy explained to the Faculty Senate.
Both the city of Palo Alto and Santa
Clara County have yet to approve the
project, according to Kennedy. He
said he thinks a satisfactory plan
might move to the county level for
approval this fall.
Kennedy estimated that an unmet
demand of about 300 units of hous
ing exists among faculty and staff, so

completion of the Peter Coutts pro
ject will not solve the housing shor
tage.
Kennedy said.
The University also hopes to pro
ceed before too long with a larger
though not specifically University
only housing development off Wil
low Road, Lyman said. However, that
project "remains entangled in the
unresolved problem of getting clear
ance to complete Sand Hill Road to El
Camino," he said.
