# Punk-rockers harass neighbors

Huntington Beach (AP) — The music that
brought you the generation gap in the '50s, has
broadened it here with its latest variation —
punk rock. Youths complain of harassment by
police, but residents complain of youth vio
lence, vandalism and bizarre behavior.
"It's a state of war over there," said con
dominium manager Jack Miller, )r. The
homeowners association of Surfside Con
dominiums spends nearly $3,000 a month for
security and an extra $1,000 a month because of
vandalism, mostly due to a small group of
punk-rockers, he said.
Miller said the names of local punk rock bands
and swastikas, a symbol adopted by many
punk-rockers, have been stenciled into
sidewalks, spray-painted on walls and burned
into lawns.
A woman who has lived on the same street for
15 years said she is now looking for a quieter
neighborhood. She described the punk-rockers
as vicious youths who have called her "every
name in the book."
"Their only goal is to torment people. That is
one of the reasons that my home is for sale,"
said the woman, who asked not to be identified.
But one of the rockers says that ever since he
cut his hair punk-rock style he has been haras
sed by police.
"We're just bored kids looking for something
better," said Mike Carpenter, 17, who like his
friends has the razor blade scars and the un
evenly short-cropped hair characteristic of the
punk-rock look.

Police Lt. John Foster said there has been a
large amount of vandalism on the south side of
town, usually taking the form of spray-painted
graffiti, "but there have been some incidents of
violence, too, and those arrested have said they
were avowed followers of Sid Vicious and other
punk-rockers."
Punk rock, which originated in England, is an
adaption of rock music with often violent lyrics
reflecting discontent with the government, the
economy or parents.
In a recent incident, punk-rockers reportedly
forced a local teen-ager to carve a swastika in his
leg with a dull paper clip.
"Swastikas are big down here," Foster said,
"but it doesn't seem to be symbolic of anti-
Semitism so much as just a general symbol of
violence," he said.
The carving incident and other violent acts
have made local headlines, giving the youths a
notoriety many of them say is unjust.
As one local punk-rock band member said, "If
a guy with long hair stabs someone, you don't
see in the paper, 'Rock fan stabs somebody.' "
Foster said the punk-rock phenomenon sur
faced less than two months ago but already has
shown signs of fading.
"It has dropped considerably since school
started," he said. Patrol checks are made in the
neighborhoods where there has been trouble,
"just to see if there's any real movement there,
or whether it's just something that will go away
in a month or so," Foster said.
