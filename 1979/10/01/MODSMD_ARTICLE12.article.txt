## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — ABC, which made its
past Olympic coverage a key part of the
network's rise to rating dominance, has
paid a record $225 million to televise the
1984 Summer Olympics from Los Angeles,
Olympic officials announced yesterday.
ABC plans more than 200 hours of live
programming from the 1984 Games, ABC
news and sports chief Koone Arledge told
a news conference. That means the hourly
cost will be more than $1 million.
The 1980 Summer Olymoks from Mos
cow will be telecast by NL>C, which paid

about $100 million for the rights.
ABC telecast the Summer Games in 1972
and 1976 and a widely held belief in the
television industry is that ABC's promo
tion of its programs, particularly in 1976,
helped ABC become no. 1.
In a joint announcement, the Interna
tional Olympic Committee (IOC) and the
Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Commit
tee said, "We believe this to be the largest
single television agreement ever
negotiated."

They said the contract must be approved
by the lOC executive board but that ap
proval is expected Oct. 25 when the board
meets in Nagoya, Japan.
According to the agreement, ABC will
spend $100 million for U.S. television
rights and $125 million to the LAOOC for
production and support services, which,
Arledge said, could include help in areas
such as transportation and providing re
sults of the contests.
