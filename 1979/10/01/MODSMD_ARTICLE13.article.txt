# Advocates say it could help industry
## Effects of nuclear accident unclear 
### 
Washington (AP) — The irony
was unanticipated, and cruel.
General Public Utilities' an
nual report was the very pic
ture of progress. Its cover
photo proudly contrasted an
old York Haven hydroelectric
plant with the new 1700-
megawatt Three Mile Island
(TMI) nuclear plant just up
river.
But by the time the report
reached stockholders, Three
Mile Island lay critically
wounded by the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident,
an accident that threatens the
survival of General Public and
the future of the entire nuclear
power industry.
Six months after the acci
dent, Three Mile Island Unit 2,
started-up only last December,
is out of operation for at least
four years by company esti
mates and conceivably forever,
severely damaged and flooded
with a small lake of radioac
tively contaminated water.
One unit down
Its sister-plant, Unit 1, is shut
down to provide support and
could stay out of service a year
or more for federal safety re
views.

Critics of nuclear power say
the accident has provided
them with what they need to
stop development of atomic
power by reminding a wary
public of March 28: the day
radiation started leaking from
the plant and there was talk of a
"meltdown" and of a general
evacuation of the populated
area around Harrisburg, Pa.
The industry's advocates say
quite the opposite, that Three
Mile Island may actually
strengthen nuclear power in
the United States.
Nobody killed
They note that nobody was
killed or seriously injured and
while some radioactivity was
released it should do little or
no harm to public health.
They say that despite a mul
titude of equipment failures
and human errors, TMl's safety
systems prevented the widely
feared fuel melt-down — the
worst type of nuclear accident
— or large releases of radioac
tivity.
Thus, they say, the accident
did not prove nuclear power
unsafe as Ralph Nader and
other critics claim, but de
monstrated that nuclear sys

terns are safe even when things
go drastically wrong.
No real choice
They say, too, that the nation
has no real choice but to build
more nuclear power plants
anyway.
That interpretation was ex
pressed within days of the ac
cident by James R. Schlesinger,
then Secretary of Energy and
former head of the old Atomic
Energy Commission (AEC).
Schlesinger's deputy secret
ary John O'Leary once directed
nuclear licensing in the AEC
and supports atomic power,
yet he is gloomy about its fu
ture, fearing that Three Mile Is
land may have given it a final
death-blow.
Long before the accident,
O'Leary was saying nuclear
power was almost dead be
cause rising costs, regulatory
and construction delays, and
slowingelectricity demand had
dried up new plant orders and
started a waveof cancellations.
'In the doldrums'
"The industry has been in
the doldrums, no doubt about
it,"says Paul Turner, vice pres
ident of the Atomic Industrial
Forum, an industry trade or
ganization.
"Three Mile Island made that
situation worse," Turner said
in a recent interview.
Turner said he thinks nuclear
power plant orders will re
sume, but not for at least three
or fouf years.
'Wait and see
The industry, said Turner,
will wait and see what new reg
ulations, emerge from investi

gations of the accident by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion and the President's Com
mission on Three Mile Island.
In addition, it may well wait
to see whether the stricken
TMI-2 plant can in fact be
cleaned up, repaired and put
back into operation.
The plant's operator, Met
ropolitan Edison Co. (Met Ed),
estimated recovery would take
four years and cost some $400
million — more than half the
plant's original cost.
That is only part of the still
untold costs of the Three Mile
Island accident.
General Public Utilities, pa
rent of Met Ed and two other
utilities, said it cost some $25
million a month to purchase
electricity from other com
panies to replace TMl's lost
capacity.
In the wake of Three Mile Is
land, the nuclear industry has
started developing its own
safety-improvement organiza
tions and a self-insurance plan
for protection against the mas
sive costs of an accident.
But until these new shields
are in place, until new federal
regulations are clarified, until
state governments and the
public regain their shaken trust
in nuclear safety, until the final
fate of Three Mile Island is de
termined, it seems certain that
the once-vigorous growth of
nuclear power will be stunted.
As O'Leary recently told a
group of reporters, "Building a
nuclear power plant today is
playing "You-Bet-Your-Com-
Company."
