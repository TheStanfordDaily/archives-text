# Odd-even may end

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — The end
of the line may be near for the
odd-even gasoline rationing
plan as officials in five South
ern California counties are
considering whether to give
the controversial plan a new
lease on life or kill it outright.
With some observers es
timating that as much as 30
percent of the driving public is
now ignoring odd-even regula
tions, leaders in Los Angeles
and surrounding counties
must decide if.the plan has be
come an unnecessary incon
venience and should be put
back on the shelf.
"It is no longer necessary for
Los Angeles County to con
tinue this program," said Los
Angeles County Board of
Supervisors chairman Kenneth
Hahn in renewed attack on the
odd-even plan last week.
"There are no long lines . . .
and the law is not being en
forced."

Hahn called for the county
Energy Commission to recon
sider its recent recommenda
tion that the plan be extended
for six months, terming the en
tire energy supply and demand
situation "a major rip-off."
Orange County supervisors
ended odd-even regulations
last Friday and San Bernardino
County received permission
Monday from Gov. Jerry Brown
to end rationing in most parts
of that region.
The odd-even plan will stay
in effect for the time being In
parts of San Bernardino County
that are adjacent ot Los
Angeles County, even though
supervisors there voted 5-0
Monday to seek full exemption
for their constituents.
The Ventura County Board
of Supervisors are expected to
consider a recommendation
today from county Weights
and Measures Director Bill
Korth to drop odd-even ration
ing in all areas west of
Thousand Oaks and Simi Val
ley. The supervisors are ex
pected to be told that gasoline
supplies in areas farthest away
from the Los Angeles County
border are going begging be
cause of lack of demand.
San Diego officials, who re
cently agreed to retain the
program, have also indicated
dissatisfaction with odd-even
rationing.
Meanwhile, a similar move
by officials in Riverside County
— where only the cities of
Riverside, Hemet and Corona
are affected — is anticipated as
early as tomorrow.
