# Law, judge conflict over pot growing

San Francisco (AP) — State
Court of Appeals Justice Paul
Halvonik, charged with grow
ing marijuana in his home, may
be able to continue on the
bench because of a loophole in
the state Constitution, the'pro
secutor in the case says.
A legal scholar says Halvonik
may also be able to argue that a
search warrant police obtained
to seize 323 marijuana plants in
his home was invalid because
investigators used a telescope
to confirm plants on a back
deck were marijuana.
"I would say the defense has
a good strong issue on the
search and seizure question in
this case," said Prof. Phillip
Johnson, associate dean of the
University of California's Boalt
Hall law school. "It's possible
the defense might prevail on
that issue."
Halvonik, 40, and his wife
were arraigned last week in
Oakland-Piedmont Municipal
Court on complaints charging
each with cultivation of
marijuana — a felony — and
possession of marijuana — a
misdemeanor.

His wife Deborah, 37, an at
torney, was charged also with
possession of cocaine, a
felony. She pled innocent to all
three charges, and Halvonik
was granted a delay until to
morrow in entering a plea.
Under Article 6 of the state
Constitution, "a judge is dis
qualified from acting as a judge
without loss of salary while
there is pending an indictment
or an information" charging
the judge with a felony.
A "complaint" is the only
thing pending against Hal
vonik, said Clayton Davega,
deputy Alameda County dis
trict attorney handling the
judge's case.
"If it gets out of municipal
court it goes to Superior Court
where an information will be
filed," said Davega.
Since his arrest, there have
been reports of pressure from
aides to Gov. Jerry
Brown for Halvonik to res
ign. Boththejudgeand hiswife
have been unavailable to
newsmen since their arrest
Wednesday night.
