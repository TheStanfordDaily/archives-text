## Hero worship a fantasy 
### 
I've become ever so slightly
weary of hearing how desper
ately America needs a hero,
particularly one named Ken
nedy. Bobby Lapin's column
(Daily, Sept. 25) harks back
wistfully to the "good old
days" of the Creat Depression
and World War 11, when
Charles Lindbergh and Clark
Cable radiated the energetic
leadership and provided the
"moral uplift" allegedly so
lacking in contemporary
America. He goes on to lament
today's tragic dearth of heroic
figures by citing all those polls
that show President Jimmy Car
ter to be a thoroughly in
adequate leader, and by throw
ing up his hands in horror and
despair at all the churlish
American teens who consider
Mork a hero.
On the very same page David
Sartoris proposes a cure for
this "hero shortage" (and the
public's collective whimpering
fcjr fatherly guidance): Sen.
Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). Elect
this man, insists Sartoris, and
our team will win the game in
spectacular fourth-quarter
fashion (politicians like foot
ball metaphors — perhaps to
foster the illusion of "rough

but fair" play). No matter that
Kennedy may not (does not)
hold immediate solutions to
our nation's many complex
problems" (in football par
lance: he doesn't have the
arm). He is still "clearly" the
man for the job in 1980.
I disagree. Kennedy's pre
sent popularity rests largely, if
not exclusively, on the mystical
allure of his surname — hardly
reason to elect him President.
Sartoris recalls for us the magic
of Camelot, of young, idealistic
John Kennedy capturing the
spirit of the nation. Idealism,
though, does not a great Presi
dent make (witness President
Woodrow Wilson); and for my
money the verdict is still out on
the Kennedy Presidency. More
to the point: our judgments of
JFK's Presidency ought not to
influence in any way our per
ceptions of Ted. The burden
lies on the electorate to forget
the name and look at the per
son, at the man-who-would
be-hero.
I would vote for Kennedy if I
thought charisma could do the
job. But Kennedy is no more
capable of making things

"right" than is Carter. It seems
to me that the American
malaise derives from far more
than the lack of a hero in the
White House. We don't have
cheap oil anymore, and never
will again — not even if saber
rattling Ronnie Reagan were
President.
We can no longer aspire to
out-eat, out-spend and out
muscle the rest of the world:
we've lived high on the hog at
the world's expense for too
long, and now it's time to pay
up. Ted Kennedy can't change
that. No President can.
Yet a lot of Americans seem
to think that, by electing
another "President Kennedy",
we can return to America's hal
cyon days. They think a
"hero," a "leader," will
miraculously banish all the un
pleasant realities that beset us.
No way. It's a fan
tasy we'd best give up. Instead
of grumbling about Carter's
loutish performance and hop
ing for salvation through some
Freudian father figure, we
should take our lumps with
grace and get on with the busi
ness of moving ahead.
