## Think small to create a freer world 
### 
In his classic Small is Beauti
ful (1973), the late E.F.
Schumacher summarizes a
mostly original and entirely
brilliant plan for the transfor
mation of the Free World. His
many ideas include the follow
ing:
1) the increased questioning
of the effects of technology, as
opposed to the current blind
acceptance of the merit of
technological advances.
2) the establishment of
economic units based on a
smaller and more personal
scale.
3) the promotion of corpora
tions which operate in the best
interest of their locale, instead
of acting strictly with the intent
of maximizing profits.
4) that greater monetary be
nefits should be provided for
people who perform useful
and constructive labor, rather
than for those who profit from
that labor through entrep
reneurial "work".
5) the re-definition of jobs as
desirable goods, and not as a
"scarce resource" which
should be replaced by
mechanization.
6) the replacement of nuc
lear energy with solar power
(Schumacher developed this
idea during the 19605, long be
fore California Gov. )erry
Brown discovered its electoral

benefits).
7) the improvement of the
Third World economy both by
distributing wealth among vil
lages, instead of concentrating
it within overcrowded met
ropolitan areas, and by em
phasizing domestic consump
tion of products over export
production.
These goals are not entirely
unreachable: they certainly
seem more likely to become
reality than in the years when
Schumacher first published
them. Perhaps the most dif
ficult portion to achieve will be
the re-orientation of Ameri
cans towards moderation — in
otherwords, slowed economic
growth — in lieu of the present
insane race towards mechani
zation, and "increased leisure
time," the two goals which
John Maynard Keynes opted
for.
A recession is in a sense de
sirable, despite the un
employment it causes, if only it
serves to slow our acceleration
towards an essentially un
employed society, which need
do nothing in order to per
petuate its existence but press
buttons connected to factories
and androids.
Such a society ignores an es
sential tendency of mankind —
happiness is obtained not

when problems are solved by
IBM oran overly energetic fed
eral government, but rather
when man himself can attempt
to overcome his problems and
strive tor perfection in his own
highly individual manner.
Another highly difficult
problem, and a more im
mediate one, exists within the
Third World: while a minority
usually enjoys the privileges of
economic and political elitism,
the vast majority is left under
nourished and impoverished.
Technology, when it has been
provided by the Western coun
tries, is ordinarily high
powered — i.e., production
can be performed only by
well-trained technicians, who
become a part of the over
privileged minority.
Instead of promoting such a
system, the Free World should
provide medium-level
technology, which could be
used by ordinary villagers and
benefit the entire country with
domestically produced essen
tials. For example, American
farming technology could
greatly enhance world food
production, if it were distri
buted among Third World far
mers.
These goals put forth by
Schumacher compare quite
favorably with the various

economic theories of the
modern world. Today, the two
great economic poles are
socialism and capitalism. The
latter theory emphasizes only
those characteristics of man
which can be called base and
evil (greed, selfishness, love of
money). The former,
socialism, preaches an idealis
tic absence of those evils,
which is at best an impossible
Utopia, and at worst an excuse
for excessive government con
trol.
Instead of allowing itself to
be governed by either of these
extremes, the Free World
should be governed by a policy
which reflects the morals of its
citizens — a mixture of prag
matism and high regard for the
rights and needs of others,
with a futuristic look to the lat
ter.
Expressed differently, the
policy should be a carefully
planned mixture of the best of
socialism, capitalism and tradi
tional local control and com
mon sense.
Small is Beautiful advocates
such a system, and it is a far
more sensible blend than the
materialistic "technological
melting pot" which now
exemplifies America.
