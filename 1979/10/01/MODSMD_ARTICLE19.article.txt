Coffee House
boycott
As yet another autumn quar
ter begins, I return to campus
to find that an old favorite of
mine has changed drastically.
Now I won't patronize the Cof
fee House, as I support the
boycott of it very strongly and
urge others to do the same.
The old Stanford Commun
ity Coffee House was a lot
more than just a place to grab a
bite to eat. It was wonderfully
intimate — quiet and relaxing
with soft music playing in the
background. How many times
have I heard, "Let's talk about
it over some expresso at the

Coffee House," or "0.K., we'll
all meet at the Coffee House"?
Then there were the many
times I went over to the Coffee
House for a free concert or film
series. Now a television and
more seating occupy the old
stage. The soft music has been
overruled in favor of much
louder "pop" music. The
"wonderful intimacy" of the
old Coffee House no longer
exists.
So, I fight it and support the
boycott, but I can't help think
ing it's the same old story.
When will people begin to see
that "bigger, newer and more
advanced" do not equal "bet
ter"? I think Joni Mitchell really

had it right when she wrote,
"Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what
you've got till it's gone? They
paved paradise and put up a
parking lot."

Oppose Cro Mem
changes
As a former resident of
Crothers Memorial, I was glad
to read (Daily, Sept. 27) that
graduate students in the resi
dence have finally organized to
oppose Mr. Scoles' continuing
efforts to take over the first

floor of Cro Mem for his own
selfish comfort.
However, their action
should not stop until they drive
him completely out. His execu
tive offices should not be lo
cated in a student residence in
view of the present scarcity of
student space.
Scoles forgets that graduate
students are people, and that
they have study, social and en
tertainment needs. By taking
over the ping-pong room and
study rooms, he has effectively
converted Cro Mem from a
student residence into a "bunk
house."
