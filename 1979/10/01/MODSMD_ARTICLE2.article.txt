# Rent control backers, foes draw battle lines
## Palo Alto tenants, landlords acknowledge housing squeeze, air grievances at hearing 
### Mark Epstein 
A Palo Alto Human Relations
Commission (HRC) public hearing
on rental housing costs evoked
support for rent control from con
cerned tenants and assertions of per
sonal liberty and free enterprise from
local landlords.
"Rent control is not going to
change the number of available un
its. It's only going to control rents.
What we need to do is find more
housing — increase the supply,"
explained Steve Suddjian,
president-elect of the Palo Alto
Board of Realtors at Thursday's meet
ing.
The hearing was scheduled to pro
vide a sounding board for public sen
timent on rent control, particularly
on a proposed rent-control ordi
nance, according to Douglas
Winslow, human relations commis
sioner and author of the bill.
Relief proposal
With information gathered at the
public hearing, the HRC soon will
submit a rental relief proposal to the
city council, Winslow said.
His ordinance, modeled after a San
Jose law, seeks to "come to grips"
with the rental housing situation in
the following way:
Placing a general percent limita
tion on annual rent increases for ren
tal units.
Creating a rental dispute media
tion board to monitor increases not
in accord with the ordinance.

Requiring landlords to provide of
ficial notice of the protest procedure
whenever increases exceed 7 per
cent.
Elevating retaliatory eviction to
misdemeanor, status.
Making excessive rents punishable
by fine.
'Set the tone'
"I think that most people, certainly
the politicians, feel that the response
at the public hearing will set the tone
for any rental-related legislation,"
Winslow said before the hearing.
"With similar San Jose legislation
passed, it's up to the community to
clarify its needs."

'There are over 15,000 students who
have to live somewhere. We're not
questioning that. But who has all the
land? Stanford University. Why won't
Stanford help the city of Palo Alto?'

Palo Alto Board of Realtors

Members of the community, filling
all the seating space in the council
room, related their problems to the
HRC for more than three and a half
hours. Rents raised two to three
times a year, no repair or mainte
nance service and a general lack of
communication between tenants
and landlords were cited as problem
areas. . .
"The (rental) situation in Palo Alto
is desperate. Enormous rents are
pushing out not only students, but

also senior citizens and single
families," said Terri Owen, a
member of Palo Altans for Affordable
Housing (PAAH).
"The vacancy rate is now .4 per
cent. Anything below 5 percent is
considered a housing crisis. As soon
as one person moves out, another
moves in, Owen explained.
"This means that if you have hous
ing and can afford it, you stay there
— even if you're not satisfied. The
landlords are taking advantage of the
tight market in order to raise their
rents."
"The Palo Alto rental-housing
-crisis can be characterized as a sel
ler's market, that is, it is neither free
nor competitive," said Fred Weiner,
another PAAH member. "The market
is run so that easy economic choices
cannot be made by the renter."
Protection
"Rent control is needed to pro
tect the individual from undue rental
: increases," said Glen Cubak, a Palo
Alto resident. "Rent control would
protect the renter, while at the same
time provide a reasonable rate of re
turn for the landlord."
"It's against our American free en
terprise system to control the rental
market," said Francis Dyer, a local
building manager. "We haven't
raised our rents unreasonably, and
we returned the Proposition 13 re
bate to our tenants, but still we do
not like the implications of govern
ment control."
The solution to the problem does
not lie entirely in rent control, ac
cording to Suddjian. He said he be
lieves the burden of responsibility
rests with the city of Palo Alto, wh
ose ordinances, he said, have pre
vented high-density housing and
made the community unprofitable
and unattractive to contractors.
Silicon Valley (the highly indus
trialized Santa Clara Valley), which
he said, has created jobs without
providing the necessary housing and
he also blames the University.
"There are over 15,000 students
who have to live somewhere," Sudd
jian said. "We're not questioning
that. But who has all the land? Stan
ford University. Why won't Stanford
help the city of Palo Alto?"

"There are over 15,000 students
who have to live somewhere," Sudd
jian said. "We're not questioning
that. But who has all the land? Stan
ford University. Why won't Stanford
help the city of Palo Alto?"
A Palo Alto Human Relations
Commission (HRC) public hearing
on rental housing costs evoked
support for rent control from con
cerned tenants and assertions of per
sonal liberty and free enterprise from
local landlords.
"Rent control is not going to
change the number of available un
its. It's only going to control rents.
What we need to do is find more
housing — increase the supply,"
explained Steve Suddjian,
president-elect of the Palo Alto
Board of Realtors at Thursday's meet
ing.
The hearing was scheduled to pro
vide a sounding board for public sen
timent on rent control, particularly
on a proposed rent-control ordi
nance, according to Douglas
Winslow, human relations commis
sioner and author of the bill.
Relief proposal
With information gathered at the
public hearing, the HRC soon will
submit a rental relief proposal to the
city council, Winslow said.
His ordinance, modeled after a San
Jose law, seeks to "come to grips"
with the rental housing situation in
the following way:
Placing a general percent limita
tion on annual rent increases for ren
tal units.
Creating a rental dispute media
tion board to monitor increases not
in accord with the ordinance.

Requiring landlords to provide of
ficial notice of the protest procedure
whenever increases exceed 7 per
cent.
Elevating retaliatory eviction to
misdemeanor, status.
Making excessive rents punishable
by fine.
'Set the tone'
"I think that most people, certainly
the politicians, feel that the response
at the public hearing will set the tone
for any rental-related legislation,"
Winslow said before the hearing.
"With similar San Jose legislation
passed, it's up to the community to
clarify its needs."

Members of the community, filling
all the seating space in the council
room, related their problems to the
HRC for more than three and a half
hours. Rents raised two to three
times a year, no repair or mainte
nance service and a general lack of
communication between tenants
and landlords were cited as problem
areas. . .
"The (rental) situation in Palo Alto
is desperate. Enormous rents are
pushing out not only students, but

also senior citizens and single
families," said Terri Owen, a
member of Palo Altans for Affordable
Housing (PAAH).
"The vacancy rate is now .4 per
cent. Anything below 5 percent is
considered a housing crisis. As soon
as one person moves out, another
moves in, Owen explained.
"This means that if you have hous
ing and can afford it, you stay there
— even if you're not satisfied. The
landlords are taking advantage of the
tight market in order to raise their
rents."
"The Palo Alto rental-housing
-crisis can be characterized as a sel
ler's market, that is, it is neither free
nor competitive," said Fred Weiner,
another PAAH member. "The market
is run so that easy economic choices
cannot be made by the renter."
Protection
"Rent control is needed to pro
tect the individual from undue rental
: increases," said Glen Cubak, a Palo
Alto resident. "Rent control would
protect the renter, while at the same
time provide a reasonable rate of re
turn for the landlord."
"It's against our American free en
terprise system to control the rental
market," said Francis Dyer, a local
building manager. "We haven't
raised our rents unreasonably, and
we returned the Proposition 13 re
bate to our tenants, but still we do
not like the implications of govern
ment control."
The solution to the problem does
not lie entirely in rent control, ac
cording to Suddjian. He said he be
lieves the burden of responsibility
rests with the city of Palo Alto, wh
ose ordinances, he said, have pre
vented high-density housing and
made the community unprofitable
and unattractive to contractors.
Silicon Valley (the highly indus
trialized Santa Clara Valley), which
he said, has created jobs without
providing the necessary housing and
he also blames the University.
