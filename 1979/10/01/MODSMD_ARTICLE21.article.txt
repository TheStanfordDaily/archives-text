## Lehmann Li Cuba raises price of SALT 
### 
On August 30 Sen. Frank
Church (D-ldaho), chairman of
the Foreign Relations Commit
tee, announced that 2000 to
3000 Soviet combat troops are
in Cuba. Immediately a wave of
angry criticism swept the Se
nate. Why are Soviet troops in
Cuba? What will happen to
SALT?
Several hypotheses about
Soviet intentions prevail. Pos
sible military reasons for hav
ing Soviet troops in Cuba in
clude: training and advising
Cuban troops; deterring a U.S.
attack against Cuba; protect
ing Castro from possible
coups; projecting Soviet
power in Central or South
America; or providing security
for Soviet intelligence ac
tivities. Political reasons might
include providing a token of
Soviet support for Cuban ac
tions in Africa or probing
American resolve.
The Communist Party news
paper Pravda insists that the
troops are strictly military ad
visers and have been in Cuba
since 1962. But would advisers
have a separate command
structure and maneuver in
combat formations? Certainly,
having Soviet troops in Cuba
would make any U.S. attack
costly. One only needs to cite
President John Kennedy's un
willingness to "surgically re
move" missile sites in 1962 be
cause any attack would invari
ably have killed Soviet troops.
But would the presence of 2000
Soviet military advisers and
8000 Soviet civilians in Cuba
not serve the same purpose?
Knowledge of Soviet troops
in Cuba protecting Castro
would surely discourage resis
tance movements against Cas
tro. But the Soviets have hid
den the troops' presence even
from the Cubans themselves. If
resistance groups do not know
that Soviet combat troops are
in Cuba, why would they be
discouraged from resisting?
Soviet troops could support
leftist revolutions in Latin or
South America. Such an inter
vention would require light air
or seaborne units. But the
Soviet combat unit possesses
heavy tanks and artillery.
Furthermore, it has no airlift or
seaborne capability.
Some suggest the Soviets
sent troops to demonstrate
support for Castro's African
adventures. They may even
have been demanded by Cas
tro as a condition for his in
volvement in Africa. But if one
is to believe the Russian posi
tion, then the troops were
there long before the Cuban
involvement in Angola and
Ethiopia in the mid-19705. Fi
nally, the presence of combat
troops might have been a chal
lenge to President Jimmy Car
ter. How would he react now
that the U.S. no longer posses
ses the strategic superiority it
had in 1962? Evidence that
Soviet troops have been in
Cuba for at least four, possibly
10, or maybe even 17 years
makes it unlikely that the
Soviets intended any specific
challenge to Carter.
It remains to be seen what
the Soviet intentions are. As
National Security Adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski put it,
"Sometimes, even in a love af
fair, do you know the exact mo
tives you are dealing with?"

How will all this affect
SALT? So far as the U.S.-
U.S.S.R. strategic balance is
concerned, almost everyone
agrees that an armored brigade
in Cuba hardly constitutes a
strategic threat.
Some Senators have argued
that the American intelligence
"failure" does not bode well
for SALT. Sen. Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.) asked, "If they can't
find the noses of Russian
troops (off the American
coast), how can they count the
noses of Russian missiles?"
This argument fails on two
points. First, President Carter
cancelled SR-71 flights over
Cuba in 1977, partially to cut
back on overall intelligence
operations. Intelligence in
Cuba was given a low priority.
In contrast, SALT verification
has been assigned the highest
priority. Second, determining
the nationality of a soldier re
quires different intelligence
capabilities than detecting a
giant SS-18 missile or a Backfire
bomber. The Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence is
expected to report that the tre
aty is verifiable.
However, the linkage of
Soviet behavior, as evidenced
by the combat troops issue, to
SALT is likely to be the major
problem for proponents of
SALT. Carter said that "SALT II
ought to be passed on its own

merits." But the mood in the
Senate is quite different.
Jackson, a leading critic of
SALT, said, "This comes back
to the fundamental issue. Can
there be an arrangement of
trust between the Soviet Union
and the United States?" Furth
ermore, Senators who previ
ously were favoring the treaty
are now linking passage with
Soviet behavior in Cuba.
Church, a supporter of the tre
aty, has declared that "The Se
nate will not ratify the SALT tre
aty while Russian combat
troops remain in Cuba. We do
have to draw the line on Soviet
combat troops somewhere."
Various amendments have
been presented in the Senate
which would delay considera
tion of the SALT treaty. An
amendment proposed by
Senator Robert Dole would
block a vote on SALT until Car
ter reports that Soviet combat
troops have withdrawn or no
longer pose a threat to the sec
urity of the U.S. and its Latin
American allies. Given recent
statements by the Soviet Union
on this matter, particularly
Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko's dismissal of the
Cuban affair as "artificial" and
urging that the matter simply
be closed, the treaty looks as if
it could be in for a long ride.
