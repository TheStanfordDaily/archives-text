Balboa, Canal Zone (AP) —
Here is a question-answer look
at what happens today to the
Canal Zone, the Panama Canal
and the Americans and their
families who live and work
here:
Q — What happens to the
Canal Zone?
A — The zone, a 646-square
mile area that has been in U.S.
hands since 1903, will be
handed'over to Panama. The
United States will continue to
use the 109-square miles of
military sites, including five
bases under U.S. control.
The Canal Zone government
ceases to exist and citizens of
the United States become sub
ject to Panamanian laws.
Americans continue to direct
the canal transit operation until
the year 2000.
Q — Why is the United
States, which spent $375 mill
ion to build the canal, relin
quishing it to Panama?

A — President Jimmy Carter,
who worked hard to promote
the controversial Panama
Canal treaties he signed last
year, said "they permit a new
relationship with Panama" and
"remove a major obstacle in re
lations with the countries of
Latin America and the Carib
bean and will substantially im
prove our standing with other
nations."
Panamanians have long vie
wed the zone, which cuts
Panama in half, as a colonial
enclave. Its elimination has
been a national goal for years.
Q — Can Panamanians run the
canal?
A — Not now. But they don't
have to until the year 2000.
Under the treaties the United
States will continue to operate
the canal under a new govern
ment agency, the Panama
Canal Commission, headed by
a board of five Americans and
four Panamanians.
