# Cards head off Boston College with the pass, 33-14
## SPORTS 
### Ivan Maisel 
The remarriage of the Stan
ford offense with the pass was
consummated Saturday
against Boston College.
You might say it was a "shot
gun" wedding.
The Cardinals routed their
Eastern counterparts 33-14 with
the aid of an offensive forma
tion previously reserved for
backyard football and the Dal
las Cowboys.
Head coach Rod Dowhower
unveiled an offensive attack
that resembled — well, that re
sembled Stanford.
Ball-control passing, using
the run to set up the pass and
perhaps most importantly, a
healthy Ken Margerum as
sisted the Cards in wielding
their most potent offensive
showing this season.
Sure, Stanford scored 45
points and gained almost 450
yards two weeks ago against
San Jose State. But that was not
the Stanford offense — that was
a running attack that gained
273 yards on the ground and
threw only 25 passes.
On Saturday, the Cards
threw it 41 times, completed 23
of them for 253 yards and no
interceptions and proved that
their love affair with the run
was just, uh, a passing fancy.
"We win by the pass. That's
the way Stanford is,"
Margerum said after the game,
and the acrobatic junior more

than proved that point during
the game. The Fountain Valley
native caught nine passes for
120 yards and three
touchdowns and was open at
will much of the time.
"In the past, Stanford relied
on the pass. We haven't
opened it up and today we did
open it up," quarterback John
Elway said.
The freshman was 12 for 21
for 132 yards and three
touchdowns and generally
made the Eagle defense look
bad, skirting their pass rush
with Baryshnikov-like moves
and riddling the BC secondary
with his .44-caliber arm.
Senior Turk Schonert
primed the defense for his
counterpart, going 11 for20 for
121 yards with his sprint-out
style before Elway came in to
rifle the ball through the con
fused defense.
"We had so much going at
them that I don't think they
knew what to do. Coach
Dowhower did a great job of
play-calling. Almost everything
he called for me was wide
open," Elway said.
The fact that Dowhower per
formed his play-calling duties
well after moaning about his
lack of performance in that
area against Army underlines
the improvement the Cards
underwent in just one week.
"We just had a job to do to
day," Dowhower said. "It was a

team we felt we could beat. We
didn't place any value in terms
of the score, we just wanted to
win the game."
As is their wont this season,
the Cards started out slowly.
Boston College took the open
ing kickoff and marched down
the field. Running the option
with ease, Eagle quarterback
Jay Palazola took BC all the way
to the Stanford 33 before trying
to pass against new Card cor
nerback Rick Gervais. Gervais
broke up two consecutive
sideline passes and the Cards
took over on downs.
"The first three games (this
year) I played strong safety and
I played it during spring prac
tice," Gervais said. "It defi
nitely seemed to me that they
were throwing to my side a
lot."
Stanford met with little suc
cess on their initial drive, get
ting one first down before
punting.
The Eagles came right back
and, primarily on the strength
of Palazola's scrambling and a
late hit by safety Steve Foley,
found themselves on the Stan
ford 30, first and 10.
The Cardinal rubberband
defense once again bent but
did not break. On fourth and
three, John Cooper's 39-yard
field goal attempt was de
flected by a streaking Gordy
Banks, who was untouched as
he rushed from the left side.
Much like Stanford a week
ago, Boston College domi
nated the game in the first
quarter but could not get any
points on the board.
"There was a recognition
problem (early)," Dowhower
said. "It's difficult to practice

for.th£ option. The problem is
speed. It's much quicker when
a team does it every game."
"Sometimes it takes the de
fense a while to settle down,"
outside linebacker Milt McColl
said in the post-game locker
room. "It's just adjusting. It's
not a lack of effort."
Stanford's first three points
came on a 10-play, 71-yard
second-quarter drive that was
highlighted by a 34-yard
Schonert-to-Margerum pass
that gave the Cards a first and
10 at the Eagle 12-yard line. The
Cards bogged down, with
halfback Mike Dotterer losing
a yard on a third-and-two
sweep right from the four.
Ken Naber calmly booted a
22-yarder from Elway's hold
and the onslaught began.
On the Cards' next posses
sion, Schonert expertly di
rected them to a touchdown,
connecting with Margerum
three times on the drive.
The second catch was vin
tage Margerum, with the junior
leaping back up the field to
snare a slightly underthrown
Schonert toss.
The score, a four-yard loft to
Margerum in the right corner,
capped a 51-yard, nine-play
drive. Naber kicked the extra
point to make it 10-0 with 1:40
to play in the half.
With Elway coming in in the
second half, the Stanford at
tack took off in rocket-like
fashion, scoring two
touchdowns in less than five
minutes.

and returned it seven yards,
the offensive machine took off
The first six-pointer came in
only five plays, with the last
two sending the crowd of
36,412 into a frenzy.
On first and 10 at the BC 23,
Elway toQk the snap, took one
step back and jump-passed —
that's right, jump-passed — to
Margerum for nine yards.
The next play Elway fired it
over the middle into
Margerum's gut for 14 yards
and the touchdown.
The Cards literally flew down
the field on the next drive,
going through the air on eight
out of the 10 plays. The score
came on an Elway rollout pass
to Margerum for 17 yards, with
Margerum outleaping two de
fenders for the ball.

"I told John 'If there's any
question, throw it high,' "
Margerum said after the game.
Stanford added another
three points on the opening
play of the fourth quarter when
Naber hit on a 44-yard field
goal to make it 27-0. The Cards
needed only a face mask call to
get in range for Naber, whose
long right leg played a big part
in stifling the Eagles' offense.
The Cincinnati native punted
six times for a 47.0 average, but
most importantly, his kicks
were so high that the Eagle re
turn men were limited to only
two total yards on their run
backs.
Boston College's offense
had been limited for the most
part to quarterback Palazola's
scrambling, but early in the
fourth quarter, the Eagles

found a new weapon — the
Cardinal secondary.
BC scored their first
touchdown on an 80-yard drive
in 10 plays, two of which were
completions of passes that had
been tipped by the Stanford
defensive backfield.
The first one, tipped by
safety Steve Foley was good for
28 yards to split end Bob
Rikard. The second, four plays
later, was tipped by corner
back Parker into the hands of
tight end |im Sherwin, thistime
for 21 yards and a first down at
the Stanford 31.
After another Eagle first
down, two major penalties
pushed them back to a first
and-32 at the Stanford 43.
Palazola rolled right, then
burst through the middle of
the defense, which had been
vacated by Stanford's blitzing

linebackers.
Polazola was virtually all by
himself until he was tackled at
the Stanford seven, first and
goal.
The next play Palazola took it
in around right end, making it
27-6 with 11:37 to go. The
two-point conversion was
good, halfback Shelby Gamble
running it around right end.
The Cards struck right back
for their final score, going 70
yards in 11 plays, with Elway
throwing his third touchdown
pass, this time to split end
Gordy Banks for 12 yards and
the score. Naber sliced the
extra point, sending it wide
and the score remained 33-8,
with 8:09 remaining.
The Eagles final score was a
drive which consisted mainly
of two Stanford penalties on
the same play, the first for a late

hit and the second for "un
sportsmanlike language."
The penalties were tacked
onto a 20-yard scramble by
Palazola and on one play the
Eagles had moved from their 20
to the Cardinal 30.
Six plays later they were in,
fullback Dan Conway sweep
ing left for the touchdown. The
two-point conversion was
stopped and that was essen
tially the game, as both squads
traded possession for the re
mainder of time.
Palazola finished the game
with both 157 yards on 17 car
ries and great respect from his
wary opponents.
"He's the best running quar
terback I've seen," defensive
end Chuck Evans said. "In the
five years I've been here the
only other quarterback I've
seen like him was Rick Leach."

The remarriage of the Stan
ford offense with the pass was
consummated Saturday
against Boston College.
You might say it was a "shot
gun" wedding.
The Cardinals routed their
Eastern counterparts 33-14 with
the aid of an offensive forma
tion previously reserved for
backyard football and the Dal
las Cowboys.
Head coach Rod Dowhower
unveiled an offensive attack
that resembled — well, that re
sembled Stanford.
Ball-control passing, using
the run to set up the pass and
perhaps most importantly, a
healthy Ken Margerum as
sisted the Cards in wielding
their most potent offensive
showing this season.
Sure, Stanford scored 45
points and gained almost 450
yards two weeks ago against
San Jose State. But that was not
the Stanford offense — that was
a running attack that gained
273 yards on the ground and
threw only 25 passes.
On Saturday, the Cards
threw it 41 times, completed 23
of them for 253 yards and no
interceptions and proved that
their love affair with the run
was just, uh, a passing fancy.
"We win by the pass. That's
the way Stanford is,"
Margerum said after the game,
and the acrobatic junior more

than proved that point during
the game. The Fountain Valley
native caught nine passes for
120 yards and three
touchdowns and was open at
will much of the time.
"In the past, Stanford relied
on the pass. We haven't
opened it up and today we did
open it up," quarterback John
Elway said.
The freshman was 12 for 21
for 132 yards and three
touchdowns and generally
made the Eagle defense look
bad, skirting their pass rush
with Baryshnikov-like moves
and riddling the BC secondary
with his .44-caliber arm.
Senior Turk Schonert
primed the defense for his
counterpart, going 11 for20 for
121 yards with his sprint-out
style before Elway came in to
rifle the ball through the con
fused defense.
"We had so much going at
them that I don't think they
knew what to do. Coach
Dowhower did a great job of
play-calling. Almost everything
he called for me was wide
open," Elway said.
The fact that Dowhower per
formed his play-calling duties
well after moaning about his
lack of performance in that
area against Army underlines
the improvement the Cards
underwent in just one week.
"We just had a job to do to
day," Dowhower said. "It was a

team we felt we could beat. We
didn't place any value in terms
of the score, we just wanted to
win the game."
As is their wont this season,
the Cards started out slowly.
Boston College took the open
ing kickoff and marched down
the field. Running the option
with ease, Eagle quarterback
Jay Palazola took BC all the way
to the Stanford 33 before trying
to pass against new Card cor
nerback Rick Gervais. Gervais
broke up two consecutive
sideline passes and the Cards
took over on downs.
"The first three games (this
year) I played strong safety and
I played it during spring prac
tice," Gervais said. "It defi
nitely seemed to me that they
were throwing to my side a
lot."
Stanford met with little suc
cess on their initial drive, get
ting one first down before
punting.
The Eagles came right back
and, primarily on the strength
of Palazola's scrambling and a
late hit by safety Steve Foley,
found themselves on the Stan
ford 30, first and 10.
The Cardinal rubberband
defense once again bent but
did not break. On fourth and
three, John Cooper's 39-yard
field goal attempt was de
flected by a streaking Gordy
Banks, who was untouched as
he rushed from the left side.
Much like Stanford a week
ago, Boston College domi
nated the game in the first
quarter but could not get any
points on the board.
"There was a recognition
problem (early)," Dowhower
said. "It's difficult to practice

for.th£ option. The problem is
speed. It's much quicker when
a team does it every game."
"Sometimes it takes the de
fense a while to settle down,"
outside linebacker Milt McColl
said in the post-game locker
room. "It's just adjusting. It's
not a lack of effort."
Stanford's first three points
came on a 10-play, 71-yard
second-quarter drive that was
highlighted by a 34-yard
Schonert-to-Margerum pass
that gave the Cards a first and
10 at the Eagle 12-yard line. The
Cards bogged down, with
halfback Mike Dotterer losing
a yard on a third-and-two
sweep right from the four.
Ken Naber calmly booted a
22-yarder from Elway's hold
and the onslaught began.
On the Cards' next posses
sion, Schonert expertly di
rected them to a touchdown,
connecting with Margerum
three times on the drive.
The second catch was vin
tage Margerum, with the junior
leaping back up the field to
snare a slightly underthrown
Schonert toss.
The score, a four-yard loft to
Margerum in the right corner,
capped a 51-yard, nine-play
drive. Naber kicked the extra
point to make it 10-0 with 1:40
to play in the half.
With Elway coming in in the
second half, the Stanford at
tack took off in rocket-like
fashion, scoring two
touchdowns in less than five
minutes.

and returned it seven yards,
the offensive machine took off
The first six-pointer came in
only five plays, with the last
two sending the crowd of
36,412 into a frenzy.
On first and 10 at the BC 23,
Elway toQk the snap, took one
step back and jump-passed —
that's right, jump-passed — to
Margerum for nine yards.
The next play Elway fired it
over the middle into
Margerum's gut for 14 yards
and the touchdown.
The Cards literally flew down
the field on the next drive,
going through the air on eight
out of the 10 plays. The score
came on an Elway rollout pass
to Margerum for 17 yards, with
Margerum outleaping two de
fenders for the ball.

"I told John 'If there's any
question, throw it high,' "
Margerum said after the game.
Stanford added another
three points on the opening
play of the fourth quarter when
Naber hit on a 44-yard field
goal to make it 27-0. The Cards
needed only a face mask call to
get in range for Naber, whose
long right leg played a big part
in stifling the Eagles' offense.
The Cincinnati native punted
six times for a 47.0 average, but
most importantly, his kicks
were so high that the Eagle re
turn men were limited to only
two total yards on their run
backs.
Boston College's offense
had been limited for the most
part to quarterback Palazola's
scrambling, but early in the
fourth quarter, the Eagles

found a new weapon — the
Cardinal secondary.
BC scored their first
touchdown on an 80-yard drive
in 10 plays, two of which were
completions of passes that had
been tipped by the Stanford
defensive backfield.
The first one, tipped by
safety Steve Foley was good for
28 yards to split end Bob
Rikard. The second, four plays
later, was tipped by corner
back Parker into the hands of
tight end |im Sherwin, thistime
for 21 yards and a first down at
the Stanford 31.
After another Eagle first
down, two major penalties
pushed them back to a first
and-32 at the Stanford 43.
Palazola rolled right, then
burst through the middle of
the defense, which had been
vacated by Stanford's blitzing

linebackers.
Polazola was virtually all by
himself until he was tackled at
the Stanford seven, first and
goal.
The next play Palazola took it
in around right end, making it
27-6 with 11:37 to go. The
two-point conversion was
good, halfback Shelby Gamble
running it around right end.
The Cards struck right back
for their final score, going 70
yards in 11 plays, with Elway
throwing his third touchdown
pass, this time to split end
Gordy Banks for 12 yards and
the score. Naber sliced the
extra point, sending it wide
and the score remained 33-8,
with 8:09 remaining.
The Eagles final score was a
drive which consisted mainly
of two Stanford penalties on
the same play, the first for a late

hit and the second for "un
sportsmanlike language."
The penalties were tacked
onto a 20-yard scramble by
Palazola and on one play the
Eagles had moved from their 20
to the Cardinal 30.
Six plays later they were in,
fullback Dan Conway sweep
ing left for the touchdown. The
two-point conversion was
stopped and that was essen
tially the game, as both squads
traded possession for the re
mainder of time.
Palazola finished the game
with both 157 yards on 17 car
ries and great respect from his
wary opponents.
"He's the best running quar
terback I've seen," defensive

hit and the second for "un
sportsmanlike language."
The penalties were tacked
onto a 20-yard scramble by
Palazola and on one play the
Eagles had moved from their 20
to the Cardinal 30.
Six plays later they were in,
fullback Dan Conway sweep
ing left for the touchdown. The
two-point conversion was
stopped and that was essen
tially the game, as both squads
traded possession for the re
mainder of time.
Palazola finished the game
with both 157 yards on 17 car
ries and great respect from his
wary opponents.
"He's the best running quar
terback I've seen," defensive
end Chuck Evans said. "In the
five years I've been here the
only other quarterback I've
seen like him was Rick Leach."

The remarriage of the Stan
ford offense with the pass was
consummated Saturday
against Boston College.
You might say it was a "shot
gun" wedding.
The Cardinals routed their
Eastern counterparts 33-14 with
the aid of an offensive forma
tion previously reserved for
backyard football and the Dal
las Cowboys.
Head coach Rod Dowhower
unveiled an offensive attack
that resembled — well, that re
sembled Stanford.
Ball-control passing, using
the run to set up the pass and
perhaps most importantly, a
healthy Ken Margerum as
sisted the Cards in wielding
their most potent offensive
showing this season.
Sure, Stanford scored 45
points and gained almost 450
yards two weeks ago against
San Jose State. But that was not
the Stanford offense — that was
a running attack that gained
273 yards on the ground and
threw only 25 passes.
On Saturday, the Cards
threw it 41 times, completed 23
of them for 253 yards and no
interceptions and proved that
their love affair with the run
was just, uh, a passing fancy.
"We win by the pass. That's
the way Stanford is,"
Margerum said after the game,
and the acrobatic junior more

than proved that point during
the game. The Fountain Valley
native caught nine passes for
120 yards and three
touchdowns and was open at
will much of the time.
"In the past, Stanford relied
on the pass. We haven't
opened it up and today we did
open it up," quarterback John
Elway said.
The freshman was 12 for 21
for 132 yards and three
touchdowns and generally
made the Eagle defense look
bad, skirting their pass rush
with Baryshnikov-like moves
and riddling the BC secondary
with his .44-caliber arm.
Senior Turk Schonert
primed the defense for his
counterpart, going 11 for20 for
121 yards with his sprint-out
style before Elway came in to
rifle the ball through the con
fused defense.
"We had so much going at
them that I don't think they
knew what to do. Coach
Dowhower did a great job of
play-calling. Almost everything
he called for me was wide
open," Elway said.
The fact that Dowhower per
formed his play-calling duties
well after moaning about his
lack of performance in that
area against Army underlines
the improvement the Cards
underwent in just one week.
"We just had a job to do to
day," Dowhower said. "It was a

team we felt we could beat. We
didn't place any value in terms
of the score, we just wanted to
win the game."
As is their wont this season,
the Cards started out slowly.
Boston College took the open
ing kickoff and marched down
the field. Running the option
with ease, Eagle quarterback
Jay Palazola took BC all the way
to the Stanford 33 before trying
to pass against new Card cor
nerback Rick Gervais. Gervais
broke up two consecutive
sideline passes and the Cards
took over on downs.
"The first three games (this
year) I played strong safety and
I played it during spring prac
tice," Gervais said. "It defi
nitely seemed to me that they
were throwing to my side a
lot."
Stanford met with little suc
cess on their initial drive, get
ting one first down before
punting.
The Eagles came right back
and, primarily on the strength
of Palazola's scrambling and a
late hit by safety Steve Foley,
found themselves on the Stan
ford 30, first and 10.
The Cardinal rubberband
defense once again bent but
did not break. On fourth and
three, John Cooper's 39-yard
field goal attempt was de
flected by a streaking Gordy
Banks, who was untouched as
he rushed from the left side.
Much like Stanford a week
ago, Boston College domi
nated the game in the first
quarter but could not get any
points on the board.
"There was a recognition
problem (early)," Dowhower
said. "It's difficult to practice

for.th£ option. The problem is
speed. It's much quicker when
a team does it every game."
"Sometimes it takes the de
fense a while to settle down,"
outside linebacker Milt McColl
said in the post-game locker
room. "It's just adjusting. It's
not a lack of effort."
Stanford's first three points
came on a 10-play, 71-yard
second-quarter drive that was
highlighted by a 34-yard
Schonert-to-Margerum pass
that gave the Cards a first and
10 at the Eagle 12-yard line. The
Cards bogged down, with
halfback Mike Dotterer losing
a yard on a third-and-two
sweep right from the four.
Ken Naber calmly booted a
22-yarder from Elway's hold
and the onslaught began.
On the Cards' next posses
sion, Schonert expertly di
rected them to a touchdown,
connecting with Margerum
three times on the drive.
The second catch was vin
tage Margerum, with the junior
leaping back up the field to
snare a slightly underthrown
Schonert toss.
The score, a four-yard loft to
Margerum in the right corner,
capped a 51-yard, nine-play
drive. Naber kicked the extra
point to make it 10-0 with 1:40
to play in the half.
With Elway coming in in the
second half, the Stanford at
tack took off in rocket-like
fashion, scoring two
touchdowns in less than five
minutes.

and returned it seven yards,
the offensive machine took off
The first six-pointer came in
only five plays, with the last
two sending the crowd of
36,412 into a frenzy.
On first and 10 at the BC 23,
Elway toQk the snap, took one
step back and jump-passed —
that's right, jump-passed — to
Margerum for nine yards.
The next play Elway fired it
over the middle into
Margerum's gut for 14 yards
and the touchdown.
The Cards literally flew down
the field on the next drive,
going through the air on eight
out of the 10 plays. The score
came on an Elway rollout pass
to Margerum for 17 yards, with
Margerum outleaping two de
fenders for the ball.

"I told John 'If there's any
question, throw it high,' "
Margerum said after the game.
Stanford added another
three points on the opening
play of the fourth quarter when
Naber hit on a 44-yard field
goal to make it 27-0. The Cards
needed only a face mask call to
get in range for Naber, whose
long right leg played a big part
in stifling the Eagles' offense.
The Cincinnati native punted
six times for a 47.0 average, but
most importantly, his kicks
were so high that the Eagle re
turn men were limited to only
two total yards on their run
backs.
Boston College's offense
had been limited for the most
part to quarterback Palazola's
scrambling, but early in the
fourth quarter, the Eagles

found a new weapon — the
Cardinal secondary.
BC scored their first
touchdown on an 80-yard drive
in 10 plays, two of which were
completions of passes that had
been tipped by the Stanford
defensive backfield.
The first one, tipped by
safety Steve Foley was good for
28 yards to split end Bob
Rikard. The second, four plays
later, was tipped by corner
back Parker into the hands of
tight end |im Sherwin, thistime
for 21 yards and a first down at
the Stanford 31.
After another Eagle first
down, two major penalties
pushed them back to a first
and-32 at the Stanford 43.
Palazola rolled right, then
burst through the middle of
the defense, which had been
vacated by Stanford's blitzing

linebackers.
Polazola was virtually all by
himself until he was tackled at
the Stanford seven, first and
goal.
The next play Palazola took it
in around right end, making it
27-6 with 11:37 to go. The
two-point conversion was
good, halfback Shelby Gamble
running it around right end.
The Cards struck right back
for their final score, going 70
yards in 11 plays, with Elway
throwing his third touchdown
pass, this time to split end
Gordy Banks for 12 yards and
the score. Naber sliced the
extra point, sending it wide
and the score remained 33-8,
with 8:09 remaining.
The Eagles final score was a
drive which consisted mainly
of two Stanford penalties on
the same play, the first for a late

hit and the second for "un
sportsmanlike language."
The penalties were tacked
onto a 20-yard scramble by
Palazola and on one play the
Eagles had moved from their 20

running it around right end.
The Cards struck right back
for their final score, going 70
yards in 11 plays, with Elway
throwing his third touchdown
pass, this time to split end
Gordy Banks for 12 yards and
the score. Naber sliced the
extra point, sending it wide
and the score remained 33-8,
with 8:09 remaining.
The Eagles final score was a
drive which consisted mainly
of two Stanford penalties on
the same play, the first for a late

hit and the second for "un
sportsmanlike language."
The penalties were tacked
onto a 20-yard scramble by
Palazola and on one play the
Eagles had moved from their 20
to the Cardinal 30.
Six plays later they were in,
fullback Dan Conway sweep
ing left for the touchdown. The
two-point conversion was
stopped and that was essen
tially the game, as both squads
traded possession for the re
mainder of time.
Palazola finished the game
with both 157 yards on 17 car
ries and great respect from his
wary opponents.
"He's the best running quar
terback I've seen," defensive
end Chuck Evans said. "In the
five years I've been here the
only other quarterback I've
seen like him was Rick Leach."
