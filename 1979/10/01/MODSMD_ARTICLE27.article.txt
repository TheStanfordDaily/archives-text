# Cards head off Boston College with the pass, 33-14

The remarriage of the Stan
ford offense with the pass was
consummated Saturday
against Boston College.
You might say it was a "shot
gun" wedding.
The Cardinals routed their
Eastern counterparts 33-14 with
the aid of an offensive forma
tion previously reserved for
backyard football and the Dal
las Cowboys.
Head coach Rod Dowhower
unveiled an offensive attack
that resembled — well, that re
sembled Stanford.
Ball-control passing, using
the run to set up the pass and
perhaps most importantly, a
healthy Ken Margerum as
sisted the Cards in wielding
their most potent offensive
showing this season.
Sure, Stanford scored 45
points and gained almost 450
yards two weeks ago against
San Jose State. But that was not
the Stanford offense — that was
a running attack that gained
273 yards on the ground and
threw only 25 passes.
On Saturday, the Cards
threw it 41 times, completed 23
of them for 253 yards and no
interceptions and proved that
their love affair with the run
was just, uh, a passing fancy.
"We win by the pass. That's
the way Stanford is,"
Margerum said after the game,
and the acrobatic junior more

than proved that point during
the game. The Fountain Valley
native caught nine passes for
120 yards and three
touchdowns and was open at
will much of the time.
"In the past, Stanford relied
on the pass. We haven't
opened it up and today we did
open it up," quarterback John
Elway said.
The freshman was 12 for 21
for 132 yards and three
touchdowns and generally
made the Eagle defense look
bad, skirting their pass rush
with Baryshnikov-like moves
and riddling the BC secondary
with his .44-caliber arm.
Senior Turk Schonert
primed the defense for his
counterpart, going 11 for20 for
121 yards with his sprint-out
style before Elway came in to
rifle the ball through the con
fused defense.
"We had so much going at
them that I don't think they
knew what to do. Coach
Dowhower did a great job of
play-calling. Almost everything
he called for me was wide
open," Elway said.
The fact that Dowhower per
formed his play-calling duties
well after moaning about his
lack of performance in that
area against Army underlines
the improvement the Cards
underwent in just one week.
"We just had a job to do to
day," Dowhower said. "It was a

team we felt we could beat. We
didn't place any value in terms
of the score, we just wanted to
win the game."
As is their wont this season,
the Cards started out slowly.
Boston College took the open
ing kickoff and marched down
the field. Running the option
with ease, Eagle quarterback
Jay Palazola took BC all the way
to the Stanford 33 before trying
to pass against new Card cor
nerback Rick Gervais. Gervais
broke up two consecutive
sideline passes and the Cards
took over on downs.
"The first three games (this
year) I played strong safety and
I played it during spring prac
tice," Gervais said. "It defi
nitely seemed to me that they
were throwing to my side a
lot."
Stanford met with little suc
cess on their initial drive, get
ting one first down before
punting.
The Eagles came right back
and, primarily on the strength
of Palazola's scrambling and a
late hit by safety Steve Foley,
found themselves on the Stan
ford 30, first and 10.
The Cardinal rubberband
defense once again bent but
did not break. On fourth and
three, John Cooper's 39-yard
field goal attempt was de
flected by a streaking Gordy
Banks, who was untouched as
he rushed from the left side.
Much like Stanford a week
ago, Boston College domi
nated the game in the first
quarter but could not get any
points on the board.
"There was a recognition
problem (early)," Dowhower
said. "It's difficult to practice

for.th£ option. The problem is
speed. It's much quicker when
a team does it every game."
"Sometimes it takes the de
fense a while to settle down,"
outside linebacker Milt McColl
said in the post-game locker
room. "It's just adjusting. It's
not a lack of effort."
Stanford's first three points
came on a 10-play, 71-yard
second-quarter drive that was
highlighted by a 34-yard
Schonert-to-Margerum pass
that gave the Cards a first and
10 at the Eagle 12-yard line. The
Cards bogged down, with
halfback Mike Dotterer losing
a yard on a third-and-two
sweep right from the four.
Ken Naber calmly booted a
22-yarder from Elway's hold
and the onslaught began.
On the Cards' next posses
sion, Schonert expertly di
rected them to a touchdown,
connecting with Margerum
three times on the drive.
The second catch was vin
tage Margerum, with the junior
leaping back up the field to
snare a slightly underthrown
Schonert toss.
The score, a four-yard loft to
Margerum in the right corner,
capped a 51-yard, nine-play
drive. Naber kicked the extra
point to make it 10-0 with 1:40
to play in the half.
With Elway coming in in the
second half, the Stanford at
tack took off in rocket-like
fashion, scoring two
touchdowns in less than five
minutes.

the Cardinals' 33-14 triumph Saturday. Playing most of the second half, the sparkling freshman gunned
home 12 completions in 21 attempts for 132 yards and three touchdowns.
