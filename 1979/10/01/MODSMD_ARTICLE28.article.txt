# Offense returns home
## 
### Chris Haft 
A welcome visitor graced the Cardinals with
its presence Saturday afternoon — an exciting,
effective offense, which had been a steady in
habitant of Stanford Stadium until this season.
Because it had been absent for a while — it
missed last week's Army game — the offense
took some time to become readjusted to its old
home, remaining quiet for a quarter and a half.
It also displayed a surprising new characteris
tic it had acquired while it was gone: a shotgun
formation. Actually, the shotgun was a qu-irk the
offense used to have a long time ago, but it had
given it up for better qualities.
Once it got settled down, though, the offense
showed it was still Stanford's best friend, dis
playing its favorite habit, the pass, much to the
enjoyment of the spectators and the Cards
themselves.
The main beneficiary of Stanford's "rejuve
nated" passing attack was flanker Ken
Margerum. Playing as only he can, the All-
Pacific-10 junior dove and leaped to catch nine
passes for 120 yards, three of them for scores.
Margerum's three touchdown receptions tied
a Stanford record shared by Gene Washington
(vs. San Jose State, 1968) and James Lofton
(Washington, 1977).
"It just felt good to play the whole game,"
Margerum said. "Both Turk (Schonert) and John
(Elway) threw the ball great — they put the ball
there."
, Apparently a quite excitable person,
Margerum felt so emotionally feverish that he
remembered little about his trio of touchdowns.
However, he did recall giving Elway advice on
how to throw the ball toward the end zone. "I
told John, 'If you have any questions, just throw
high,' " Margerum related. "I like to jump."

Margerum attributed the team's improved
performance to an all-around brighter attitude,
from the locker room to the sidelines to the
field.
"It was like last year again," Margerum said.
"You could just go out and go crazy — you
didn't have to worry about anything."
After suffering seven quarterback sacks
against Army, however, tKe Cards were under
standably worried about Boston College's pass
rush.
To prevent his signal-callers from commiserat
ing with the potato bugs crawling on the
stadium turf, Card head coach Rod Dowhower
reinstated the shotgun formation, where the
quarterback stands several yards behind the
center, to the Stanford offense.
The last time the Cards ran the shotgun
against competition was in the 1967 Big Game,
according to Bob Rose, Stanford Sports Infor
mation director.
The Cards ran the shotgun briefly during the
opening of this year's practice, then shelved it
until this past week. As far as Schonert and Elway
are concerned, they wouldn't mind making it a
permanent feature of Stanford's offense.
"The shotgun felt good," said Schonert, a
faint smile playing about his features. "You can
see things a lot quicker."
tlway, whose high school team used the shot
gun often, felt extremely comfortable, and
showed it by firing 12 completions in 21 attempts
for 132 yards and three touchdowns, the first
time a Stanford freshman has thrown for that
many scores.
The 6-foot-3, 180-pounder impressed
everyone with his flat, hard and accurate passes.
Yet Elway's most noticeable attribute was not his
arm, but the extreme poise he showed while
leading the Cards to 23 second-half points.
"After the first time we scored it was just bing,
bing, bing, bing right down the field, which gave
me a lot of confidence," said Elway, who added,
"I just went in there to try and do my best."
Margerum swore that he and the rest of the
Cards will be at their best — at least emotionally
— for this Saturday's Pac-10 opener with UCLA.
"We'll be fired up out of our minds,"
Margerum promised. "When we run out on the
field next week and the Band plays 'All Right
Now,' I won't be able to feel the grass."
Indeed. The only grass the Cards want to feel
for the rest of the season is the grass that grows
in the opposition's end zone.
