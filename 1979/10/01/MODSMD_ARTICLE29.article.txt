# Water poloists – as usual – edge Cal 5-4 for tourney win

In the category of certainties, add to death and taxes:
one-goal margins in California-Stanford water polo
games.
This time, the Cardinals prevailed 5-4 Saturday to win
the Stanford Invitational Tournament and keep their
deGuerre winning streak alive. The Cards have now
been unbeaten in 40 straight games at home.
Earlier Saturday, Stanford edged West Berlin 7-6. And
in the opening round on Friday, the Cards trounced
Fresno State 17-1 behind six goals by sophomore Chris
Kelsey, then dispatched UC-Davis 12-2 that afternoon.
Like many previous matchups between the two na
tional water polo powers, Stanford jumped ahead of Cal
early in the game, then fought to hold off a tenacious
Bear comeback.

"Against Cal,' said Cardinal coach Dante Dettamanti,
"every goal's important. You can never have enough."
For most of the first quarter, the teams traded turnov
ers and blocked shots. But with less than three minutes
left in the period, Kelsey flipped a pass to hole man jody
Campbell in the middle, whereupon the sophomore
surprised the spectators and Cal goalie David Young by
defiy catching it and whipping it into the goal with a
single backhand motion.
A minute later, senior Randy Kalbus found Campbell
open on the weak side, and the Cards were up, 2-0.
The second quarter, however, was something re
sembling a bad dream for Stanford. The offense was
stifled by Cal's aggressive defense and the Cardinal de
fense, though dogged, sagged and finally broke,in the
last two minutes of the half.

With 1:11 to play in the period, junior Steve Smith
received his third ejection foul, excluding him from the
rest of the contest. On the ensuing 6-on-5 situation, Pete
Cutino Jr. — son of the Cal coach — batted in a pass to
pull Cal within one.
An interesting statistic: In the first half of this physical
contest, four Cardinal players were ejected on major
fouls, but not one Cal player was asked to leave for a
30-second penalty period.
Well, the Bears are just a clean team, right? Wrong.
With three seconds left in the first half, the cross-bay
rivals scored again. But this one didn't go up on the
scoreboard. Cal hole man Carlos Steffens, after his last
second shot was blocked by the ever-present John Gan
sel, decided to take another shot — this one a fist to a
submerged Jody Campbell right eye.

Unnoticed by the referees, the injury just accidentally
kept the game's leading scorer on the bench for the
remainder of the contest.
"The whole team is physical," Campbell reflected la
ter, "but Carlos is just gross. They shouldn't even allow
him to play."
In retrospect, however, Cal might have been better off
leaving well enough alone. With junior Mark Kouznetz
playing hole for the injured Campbell and the ejected
Smith, a determined Stanford squad buried the Bears in
the third quarter, outscoring them 3-1. Goals by Kalbus,
Kelsey and freshman Jamie Bergeson led a balanced
Cardinal attack, while thfc defense kept the Bears on a
tight leash.

tactic, as he was punched below his right eye by Weenie Carlos
Steffens, whom Campbell later described as "gross."
