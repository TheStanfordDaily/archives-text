# Water poloists – as usual – edge Cal 5-4 for tourney win

In the category of certainties, add to death and taxes:
one-goal margins in California-Stanford water polo
games.
This time, the Cardinals prevailed 5-4 Saturday to win
the Stanford Invitational Tournament and keep their
deGuerre winning streak alive. The Cards have now
been unbeaten in 40 straight games at home.
Earlier Saturday, Stanford edged West Berlin 7-6. And
in the opening round on Friday, the Cards trounced
Fresno State 17-1 behind six goals by sophomore Chris
Kelsey, then dispatched UC-Davis 12-2 that afternoon.
Like many previous matchups between the two na
tional water polo powers, Stanford jumped ahead of Cal
early in the game, then fought to hold off a tenacious
Bear comeback.

"Against Cal,' said Cardinal coach Dante Dettamanti,
"every goal's important. You can never have enough."
For most of the first quarter, the teams traded turnov
ers and blocked shots. But with less than three minutes
left in the period, Kelsey flipped a pass to hole man jody
Campbell in the middle, whereupon the sophomore
surprised the spectators and Cal goalie David Young by
defiy catching it and whipping it into the goal with a
single backhand motion.
A minute later, senior Randy Kalbus found Campbell
open on the weak side, and the Cards were up, 2-0.
The second quarter, however, was something re
sembling a bad dream for Stanford. The offense was
stifled by Cal's aggressive defense and the Cardinal de
fense, though dogged, sagged and finally broke,in the
last two minutes of the half.

With 1:11 to play in the period, junior Steve Smith
received his third ejection foul, excluding him from the
rest of the contest. On the ensuing 6-on-5 situation, Pete
Cutino Jr. — son of the Cal coach — batted in a pass to
pull Cal within one.
An interesting statistic: In the first half of this physical
contest, four Cardinal players were ejected on major
fouls, but not one Cal player was asked to leave for a
30-second penalty period.
Well, the Bears are just a clean team, right? Wrong.
With three seconds left in the first half, the cross-bay
rivals scored again. But this one didn't go up on the
scoreboard. Cal hole man Carlos Steffens, after his last
second shot was blocked by the ever-present John Gan
sel, decided to take another shot — this one a fist to a
submerged Jody Campbell right eye.

Unnoticed by the referees, the injury just accidentally
kept the game's leading scorer on the bench for the
remainder of the contest.
"The whole team is physical," Campbell reflected la
ter, "but Carlos is just gross. They shouldn't even allow
him to play."
In retrospect, however, Cal might have been better off
leaving well enough alone. With junior Mark Kouznetz
playing hole for the injured Campbell and the ejected
Smith, a determined Stanford squad buried the Bears in
the third quarter, outscoring them 3-1. Goals by Kalbus,
Kelsey and freshman Jamie Bergeson led a balanced
Cardinal attack, while thfc defense kept the Bears on a
tight leash.

half," said Dettamanti. "They had more scoring oppor
tunities than they should have. Our defense is designed
to stop cross-goal drives, but (Cal's Kevin) Robertson
was getting them the entire first half.
"I thought we adjusted very well" in the second half,
he added. "The guys really picked up the slack for Jody.
It shows that our people coming off the bench are im
proving."
In typical fashion, the fourth quarter saw Cal slowly
chipping away at the Cardinal lead. Two more Stanford
ejections resulted in goals for the Bears, the last one
coming from the arm of Steffens with :46 left in the
game.
Leading by a single tally, the Cards used up time. But
the 35-second limit on possession forced Stanford to
give the ball back to Cal with 11 seconds remaining in the
game.
Cal called time out to play strategy, but when play
resumed, it was obvious the Cards hadn't wasted the
time out either. Sloughing off the weak side, Kelsey
intercepted a pass destined for Steffens, who was work
ing off a pick in the hole. Time ran out with the ball safely
in Kelsey's hands.
