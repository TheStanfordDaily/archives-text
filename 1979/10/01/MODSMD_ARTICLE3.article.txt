# Foothill joggers require hiking permits
##

Many students may have come to
the University with visions of explor
ing remote jogging trails among the
"8000 wooded acres" mentioned in
every publicity booklet.
But, runners should take heed on
their first trip out because many
areas behind campus that are popu
lar among joggers are private prop
erty where trespassing is prohibited.
Runners who prefer the cross
country environment should re
member to pick up a hiking permit

for the Stanford Community Trail, a
three-mile loop through the foothills
just northeast of junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Permits can be picked up in Rm.
105 in Encina Hall, the real estate of
fice for the University.
Education
Zera Coleman, administrative as
sistant in that office, said the purpose
of issuing permits is to educate the
University community about the
rules laid down by landowner, Man
uel Piers, who uses the the foothill

area to graze his dairy cattle.
Major rules prohibit dogs and for
bid running at night and traveling off
the trail.
According to Director of Stanford
Police Services, Marv Herrington,
during two seasons in the recent
drought no cattle were on the prop
erty and the land was used as a park
and picnicking area by the Stanford
community.
The need to check permits arose in
spring 1977, when Piers again began
grazing cattle there.

"There were many incidents of
people or dogs scaring or chasing the
cattle," Herrington said.
Safety rules
In addition, joggers are urged to
stay on the path and not to run alone
for their own safety.
"The property is not under our
jurisdiction and anyone who uses it
as an escape or a place to meditate is
taking a definite risk," Herrington
said.
Two rapes were reported in the
area last year.
