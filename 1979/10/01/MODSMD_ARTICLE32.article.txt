# Cards endure Pyrrhic victory, 6-2; Rafalovich, Mann suffer injuries

Stanford, rated seventh in
the West, won Saturday's war
by defeating Pomona-Pitzer,
6-2. But the Cardinals lost a
costly battle, suffering a'o key
casualties — Ted Rafalovich's
knee (contusion and slight car
tilage tear) and Andre Mann's
right leg (breaks in both
bones).
"Do it for Andre" became
the rallying cry in head coach
Nelson Lodge's halftime talk
and despite missing the ser
vices of the two strikers, Stan
ford outpaced the Sagehens by
a 4-1 margin in the second
period. The win keeps the
Cards' string of victories intact
at four, and raises their overall
record to 5-0-1.
"It was a good victory for
us," Lodge said. "We were
striking well, passing well.
Three years ago I watched
them beat us 2-1. Willie
(Guicce) helped to maintain
the poise we needed upfront."
"Our game is improving,"
said Bill Hoffenburg. "It's bet
ter than it was at Davis, but we
still have a ways to go. We're
starting to work it out. I think
it's going to come together in
the next couple of games."

"I think the play looked bet
ter," said Greg Delgado. "This
is the first game where the play
has looked really good. We're
starting to work together,
we're getting more poise."
While dominating play in
most of this season's matches,
Stanford has let the opponents
draw first blood on several oc
casions. Against the Sagehens,
the Cards found themselves
"repeating the mistake of the
first goal at Davis," as Guicce
put it.
Lodge commented, "Again
we were able to come back.
The first goal is beginning to be
a trademark — we wait and
then we let them come at us.
We can't do that against a good
team."
Lodge hypothesized that
Stanford athletes in general,
and his soccer players in par
ticular "don't want to show too
much" of their abilities and in
fact want to measure up the
opposition before getting
down to business.
This time it was Pomona's
Mike Folden who broke the ice
with only 6:17 elapsed in the
game, on a corner kick assist by
Pete Mac Donald. It took the
Cards 10 minutes to tie the

match on Rafalovich's goal.
Stanford then went ahead for
keeps on a Dan McNevin pen
alty kick with a minute remain
ing in the first period.
Stanford required 15 mi
nutes to come to a boil in the
second period, but after Peter
Phillips scored with an assist by
Hoffenburg, the Cards really
cooked. Jon Hecht fed a pass to
Guicce who in turn slammed a
line drive into the Pomona net,
putting the Cards ahead, 4-1.
Just four minutes later
McNevin crossed an intended
pass across the mouth of the
Sagehen's goal, but instead of
getting as assist on the almost
assured goal, McNevin logged
the goal himself when the ball
caught the top left corner for
another Stanford tally.
Pomona got on the
scoreboard one more time
with 15 minutes remaining as
John Waldman assisted Fred
Weiss. To end the meeting on a
positive note, Guicce passed
off to freshman Abe Dras
sinower six minutes later.
Looking ahead to this after
noon's 3 p.m. rumble with
Washington, Lodge said,
"Washington is a critical game.
They're always considered a

top team and we need to beat
them to get ourselves recog
nized by the NCAA selection
committee."
"We can't afford to let
Washington score early. We
beat a good team (Pomona),
but more importantly we
gained momentum for a very
good team. It was a good game
for us — our attitude is back
and we should win on Mon
day," Lodge added.
How will the loss of Mann
and Rafalovich affect the
Cards' play against
Washington? "We . . . had to
make changes up front (in the
second half against Pomona),
but we showed great poise and
still scored four goals," Lodge
replied. "I'll assume Ted can't
play . . . (but) I think we can
play very well with the new
placement."
Obviously Stanford would
rather take to Maloney Field
with the Card all-time season
scoring champ, but as Delgado
explained, "We proved we can
work as a team without Ted.
There's not a lot of difference
between the starters and the
bench."

over Pomona-Pitzer College. Tennyson, a sophomore, has been one of the mainstays of Stanford's stellar
defensive effort so far this season.
