Stanford's field hockey team

champions of this weekend's
Oregon Invitational Tourna
ment in Eugene, Oregon.
The Cardinals shut out Chico
State, Washington State, Ore
gon University and California
to take first place, bringing
Stanford to a 5-0 win-loss re

Stanford defeated Chico 3-0

hour-long confrontation.

during the first half.
The team also scored a 1-0
victory against Oregon Univer

in the nation last year. The goal
was scored by Nancy White
after a spectacular corner play
by Claudia Gold and Betsy Hal.
Stanford routed Cal 3-0 in

with a hat trick from link Nancy
White. Two goals were re

final goal was scored after a
classic 35 hard dodge-and

The 4-0 shut-out record for
this tournament reflects the

area, while a backline combi
nation of veteran team mem
bers Julia Johnson, Nancy
Jackson, Liz Maxwell and Ron
nie Vella held the midfield.
An elated coach Barbara
Longstreth discussed what this
weekend's victories mean for
the team.
"We discovered we can play
with anybody," Longstreth
said. "The girls are thrilled.
They know they've got it, be
cause they play as a team. We

have a lot of fine players. This is
a great beginning."
The team's next match wii'i
be at San Jose State Saturday.
San jose was ranked third in
the nation last year, so Stan

ford will be practicing hard this
week. "But," Longstreth said,
"we know how good we are
now, and that we can compete
nationally. It ought to be a
great game."
