Cross country
The men's and women's
cross country teams traveled
south to the Fresno Invitational
held over the weekend.

The men finished second in a
10-team field on the 10-
kilometer course, bowing to a
"very, very fine" Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo team, according to
coach Dean Clark.
Leading the Cards was Tom
Lobsinger, who finished third
overall with a time of 31:16.9.
The team's overall good stand
ing was due to the presence of
five men in the top 13 runners,
with all five within 40 seconds
of each other.
The women finished fifth in
their 12-team field. Freshman
Kim Schnurpfeil, "one of our
top recruits," according to
coach Laurel Treon, placed'
fourth with a time of 16:44.7 for
the three-mile course.
California took the women's
title in a race in which the top
six runners bettered the course
record of 17:04.
