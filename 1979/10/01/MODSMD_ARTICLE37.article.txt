# Traffic radar use contested

Miami (AP) â€” Five months after a judge
short-circuited police radar in Florida, patrol
men and traffic courts still appear to be relying
on an estimated 100,000 radar guns to monitor
the nation's highways.
Spot checks by The Associated Press in a
dozen states suggest that the ruling has had little
effect outside of Dade County, where police
temporarily pulled their 22 radar guns off the
road. The number of speeding tickets plum
meted 50 percent.
"Police agencies don't understand what hap
pened down there," said Neal Sanders, director
of legislative relations for Electrolert Inc. of
Troy, Ohio, which manufactures the "Fuzzbus
ter" radar-detection device and spent $30,000 to
underwrite the Miami court challenge.
"You're fighting 20 years of tradition and a
great deal of inertia," Sanders said.
Judge Alfred Nesbitt, theadministrativejudge
for Dade County courts, convened his hearing

after television reports showed radar clocking a
banyan tree at 86 mph and a house a 28 mph.
After his ruling on May 7, in which he declared
radar unreliable, Nesbitt became something of a
folk hero. He received hundreds of con
gratulatory letters from the United States,
Canada, Australia and Ireland and more than
2,000 requests of copies of the ruling.
Though Nesbitt's ruling covered only 80
speeding cases and was not binding on any
other judge, it raised speculation that radar
would be banned by other courts.
Sanders estimated that "no more than a few
dozen" judges have openly declared they will
throw out cases based on radar readings.
In Florida, state Rep. Ronald Silver (D-North
Miami Beach) has introduced legislation to ban
radar. The Nevada Legislature killed a similar
bill. Sanders said hearing are underway in Neb
raska on a bill to set equipment and training
standards for radar units.
