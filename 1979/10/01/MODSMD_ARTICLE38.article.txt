# Volunteers add spirit to hospital life

When asked how she felt about non
professional volunt ers working with her
daughter, a young mother standing out
side the Children's Hospital at Stanford
replied, "There was a girl inside who
treated our daughter just like a sister. I am
sure that a nurse would not have been able
to give her so much attention."
The woman was referring to just one of
the many University students who volun
teer their services at the hospital. These
volunteers take an active role in maintain
ing the quality of the medical center.
Children's Hospital at Stanford is one of
the best-known medical centers in
the nation. Handling such fatal conditions
as cancer, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis
and hemophilia, the hospital is concerned
with any seriously disabled or diseased
children.
University students who act as volun
teers enable the staff to work in a pleasant
atmosphere. According to workers at the
hospital, they create in the children an en
thusiasm about life which is quite perti
nent to the healing process.
Donna Croce, head of the volunteer
program at the hospital, commented that
the University students in particular add an
enthusiasm and spirit to the hospital
which all the staff appreciate.
"Stanford students," she said, "are just
great for the hospital!"
"Upon becoming a voluntary worker at
the hospital," said Croce, "a student be
comes an active member of the medical
community. This means that he or she as
sumes a responsibility to both the staff and

the young patients."
Beyond the fact that a volunteer must be
at least 18 years of age, have a chest
x-ray, and be willing to work at least once a
week for six months, there are few pre
requisites for the job.
To become a worker, a student
must initially be interviewed by Croce. She
will ask volunteers their reasons for
wanting to work in the program, and what
they expect to gain from it.

'University students who

Unfortunately, one cannot receive any
school credit for working at the hospital.
However, Croce said she will be very wil
ling to write glowing recommendations
for trustworthy, responsible students.
After the interview, volunteers must at
tend a series of orientation and training
classes in which he or she learns about the
job.
Since this job is moreclosely associated
with the mental aspect of dealing with
children, Croce said, the volunteers are

placed into departments according to
their personalities.
A gregarious person will be placed in a
department that involves actively spend
ing time with the children and playing
games, such as recreational therapy. A
more reticent person, on the other hand,
would be placed in a department like med
ical records.
"This is equally important," said-Croce,
"but it does not involve so much contact
with other people."
Other volunteer departments in the
hospital include patient accounts, occupa
tional therapy, psychosomatic units, and
nursing units.
Susan l-raimow is presently a student at
the University who worked as a volunteer
at the hospital during this past summer.
"The volunteer service gives students an
opportunity to work with receptive chil
dren while also gaining valuable experi
ence," she commented.
She said that while a large portion of the
volunteers are pre-med, there are also
some who work at the hospital simply be
cause they are interested in social services
and interaction with people.
Students interested in becoming a vol
unteer at the Children's Hospital only
have to call the volunteer department and
ask for an interview. In the middle of Oc
tober, a special orientation program will
be in session that will introduce all the
volunteers to the hospital's many depart
ments.
As Fraimow noted, "It is a very good way
to gain experience, whether one is plan
ning for a career in medicine or not."
