# Parking problems considered
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Parking is a problem that has
long plagued faculty members
and students alike.
Butforthose members of the
Committee on Parking and
Transportation who are
charged with the task of advis
ing President Richard Lyman
on parking matters, it is an
even greater problem.
The committee, headed by
Assistant to the President Bob
Hamrdla, consists of three
members each from the fa
culty, staff and student body
and also three ex-officio mem
bers. Selected by President
Lvman, this committee has six
major functions. Among these
are evaluating the operation of
any regulations which result
from changes in parking
policies, continuing to survey
the attitudes of the community
regarding the adequacy of reg
ulations, holding public hear
ings on parking and transporta
tion problems, and advising on
proposals for alternative trans
portation experiments.
Fulfillment of these pur
poses is not achieved over
night, according to Hamrdla.
Committee members study the
cases extensively and only then
make recommendations.
"We serve as a recommen
dation and advisory body to

the president," stressed
Hamrdla. "We do have a good
deal of influence, but our
suggestions are not final."
One dilemma the committee
deals with is ticketing. The
University itself has little con
trol over this area because all
ticketing is handled by Santa
Clara County. Parking fines are
restricted by the county to a
maximum of two dollars.
County processing of fines is
sometimes slow, thus making
enforcement of parking laws
difficult.
"In order for any parking
program to be effective,"
Hamrdla said, "it must be en
forced."
Though many students wel
come the lax parking enforce
ment, few realize that stronger
enforcement would alleviate
other problems. Resident par
kers often complain that their
spots have been filled by non
resident autos, and the only
spaces available to residents
are in the parking lots. A vici
ous circle is created involving
the resident parker, permit
holder, and the county police
department.
According to Hamrdla, more
manpower to issue tickets
would be ideal and the possi
bility has been studied, but the
University receives no part of

the fines so it would not be be
neficial to develop a University
ticketing program.
Students have expressed a
desire for more parking, hop
ing that this would end the
struggle between the resident
and parking lot permit. But ac
cording to Marvin Herrington,
director of the Department of
Safety, more parking is not
necessary.
"We have about 13,000
spaces and on any given day,
even at the most congested
times, our load is between
10,000 and 12,000 cars."
Parking is available even on
poor weather days. The only
drawback, says Herrington,
. . is that competition for
close spaces becomes frantic."
Hamrdla cites this competi
tion as the University's number
one parking problem.
"We're all human and we
would all like to park close to
where we're going, but we
can't," he said.
Because many off-campus
students, faculty members and

employees are forced to park
in the outer parking lots, the
committee recommended that
the University establish the
Marguerite bus service. The
service is free and provides
transportation to and from the
outer parking lots. It is funded
by parking fees, which also
partially support administra
tion and enforcement of park
ing policies.

even at the most congested
times, our load is between
10,000 and 12,000 cars."
Parking is available even on
poor weather days. The only
drawback, says Herrington,
. . is that competition for
close spaces becomes frantic."
Hamrdla cites this competi
tion as the University's number
one parking problem.
"We're all human and we
would all like to park close to
where we're going, but we
can't," he said.
Because many off-campus
students, faculty members and

employees are forced to park
in the outer parking lots, the
committee recommended that
the University establish the
Marguerite bus service. The
service is free and provides
transportation to and from the
outer parking lots. It is funded
by parking fees, which also
partially support administra
tion and enforcement of park
ing policies.

The parking problem resumes this week as tickets will be issued to cars parked without permits in any of
the on-campus tots.
