The tate of the seven sororities
here is now in the hands of ad
ministration officials, who are re
viewing the groups' applications
forofficial University recognition.
The sororities, formed after a
33-year-ban was lifted in De
cember 1977, are awaiting deci
sions that are expected within two
weeks from Assoc. Dean of Resi
dential Education Norm Robin
son, Student Activities Adviser
Patricia Brandt, the Committee on
Services to Students and, ulti
mately, Dean of Students James
Lyons.
Lyons said he "hasn't seen the
proposals recently," but added,
"Last spring it looked to me like a
number of them were well on the
way to recognition, both in their
intent and their policies."
The factors to be considered in
the University's decisions include
demand for each group's evidence
of house organization and man
agement skills, the presence of a
qualified advising community, a
policy of non-discrimination, a
high degree of independence
from its national organization,
compliance with' University resi
dence policies and financial sol
vency.
In addition, educational and so
cial objectives must be consistent
with University objectives and go
als, and, if provisions for a new
house are included, these must
be realistic.
Not final
Brandt explained that "at this
point, a 'no' wouldn't be a final
'no' " on recognition. The Univer
sity plans to send letters to soror
ity presidents advising them on
which policies need to be

Tammy Ritchey, 1978-79 Inter-
Sorority Council (ISC) President,
said she feels the University's
concern for house management
and finance as well as its ques
tions about the ways in which
sorority housing will affect the
housing draw are premature.
Ritchey said houses are "a lot of
years down the road," although
sororities meet the other re
quirements for recognition.
A major point of contention be
tween the University and the
sororities has been the require
ment of the national sororities
that all prospective members
must have a letter of recommen
dation or rush information form,
which requires an alumna's signa
ture.
The University fears this policy
would discriminate against
women who might not know any
alumnae.
Out of proportion
Ritchey said she feels the issue
has been blown out of propor
tion. "If you want to be part of a
national (sorority), you have to
abide by their rules," she said.
However, sororities here do not
consider .those letters in their
selection process, Ritchey added.
"It's not as if we sit around and
read letters of recommendation."
She also said many of the
groups have provisions for the let
ter -to be written by a collegiate
member of the sorority.
The University is considering
applications from Kappa Kappa
Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Pi
Beta Phi, Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma,
Alpha Omicron, and Alpha Chi
Omega separately, although the
national Panhellenic group origi
nally had wanted an "all or none"
decision.

The proposals were first sub
mitted last spring with a cover let
ter, signed by Ritchey, asking that
they be considered together.
When the University refused,
Ritchey said, "The nationals didn't
even want us to apply." The
groups applied separately, how
ever, because even a "no" from
the administration gives the or
ganizations "something to work
with" and a chance to make ar
rangements for future accep
tance, Ritchey explained.
Because the, groups are cur
rently not recognized, they are
technically not allowed to use
campus facilities for meetings and
activities, although some groups
have been allowed to meet on
campus to enable them "to go
ahead working for recognition,"
Brandt said.

Three of the sororities are rent
ing off-campus apartments,
where they hold weekly meet
ings, and another group uses a
meeting room at the Holiday Inn
on El Camino.
According to Nancy Hoffman,
current ISC president, the biggest
impact of being recognized would
be that "sororities will be part of
the University system and will be
able to use University facilities"
for meeting space on campus. She
said the sororities also might
apply for office space and storage
space.
In addition, if sororities are rec
ognized, Hoffman said, she thinks
the ISC will push for having on
campus rush as a definite annual
event so the group would not
have to request University per
mission every year.

For the past two years the Uni
versity has permitted the ISC to
use dormitory lounges for rush
open houses. Hoffman said the
ISC investigated holding rush off
campus last spring, but found it
was financially unfeasible.
The controversy over sororities
dates back to the early 19405. At
that time,, large numbers of
college-aged men were fighting in
World War 11, leaving more
women than ever at the Univer
sity.
In 1943, there were five applic
ants for every place ip a sorority
and the riff between "hall" and
sorority women was deepening.
Tension between the two groups
peaked, petitions were circulated
and the University took action.
In February 1943, a special
committee of the Board of Trus

tees was convened to study the
situation and to consider student
petitions.
After 14 months of interviews,
reports and observation, the
study concluded that sororities
"tend to divide Stanford women
into two competing groups . . .
the women students-are so tense
and tired (during rush) that their
college work suffers unmistakably
. . . Over a long period of years
the women in the halls have main
tained a better scholastic average
♦han have the sorority women.
"Our conclusions ape
"1) The dual system of respon
sibility for the housing and social
program now in effect is not in the
best interests of the women stu
dents at Stanford.
"2) The system has caused seri
ous disunity among Stanford's
women, impairing the Universi
ty's ability to meet its imperative
obligations and responsibilities in
respect of women students.
"3) Remedies heretofore prop
osed, including changes in rush
ing rules, will not eliminate the
fundamental causes of the disun
ity."
' After that decision, the
sororities sold their houses to the
University and the women moved
into dorms.
Then, in the late 1960s and early
19705, cries of equal rights were
heard and objections were raised
over Stanford's fraternities, which
had continued without interrup
tion.
The state enacted Title IX, pro
hibiting discrimination on the
basis of sex; and, suddenly, pro
sorority cries had legal backing. In
December 1977, after a lengthy,
campus-wide debate, the trustees
voted to lift the ban giving
sororities a chance to return.
