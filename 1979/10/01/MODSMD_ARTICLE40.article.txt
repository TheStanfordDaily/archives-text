# Scholarly works printed at S.U. Press

As one more function of a top Ameri
can university, the Stanford University
Press provides an outlet for books of
high scholarship that might otherwise
never reach the marketplace.
The University Press deals with the
forefront of scholarly thought, books
on which commercial publishers could
not afford to take the risk because of
the limited readership, according to its
director, Leon E. Seltzer.
"Such books do not generate huge
sales, but they are still vital to those in
academia who must keep up with the
latest developments in thfeir field," said
Seltzer.
Stanford annually publishes about 40
books in a wide range of subject areas.
"It is probably not too much to s?y
that we are the foremost publisher of
taxonomic (classification of plants and
animals) works in biology in the
world," says Seltzer.
This tradition began with David Starr
Jordan, first president of the University
and the quality of the Press' work has
been continually perfected since.
Now authors of taxonomic works,
regardless of the college to which they
are affiliated, bring their manuscripts
to the Stanford Press. There are two or
three taxonomic works on the publish
ing list at all times, according to Seltzer.
"As a matter of fact, only about one
third of all the manuscripts the Press
publishes come from Stanford au
thors," says Seltzer.
"The Stanford Press also considers
itself strong in history, political sci
ence, literature, and Latin American,
lapanese, and Chinese studies," he
said.
The Press is extremely selective in
the scholarly merit of each manuscript
published, but this does not mean that
all works come from renowned scho
lars, Seltzer said.
One of the University Press' most
successful books on its backlist of

about 600 titles, "Between the Pacific
Tides," was written by Edward Ricketts,
a self-taught scholar.
"But, says Seltzer, "it is still impecc
able in detail."
And another of the more successful
books published by the Press was writ
ten by a complete amateur. Seltzer de
scribes this author as "a rubber worker
who went into the jungle and poked
around enough to bring out a book in
the classic tradition of the great an
thropologists."
This particular book required a great
deal of revision before publication, but
that is just part of the selection process
that is the job of the senior editors, he
said.
Some 600 manuscripts are annually
submitted to the Press, according to
editor-in-chief Jess Bell, of which 80
percent are rejected "in house" before
the remainder go to readers who make
further re Actions.
• "Many factors other than the quality
of the work determinewhetheror not it
is published," says Seltzer.
"It's an adventure, because each
book is unique," he said. "What an
editor lives for is to discover a manus
cript worth publishing, so he will ea
gerly look at everything."
The major question in the selection
process is whether or not a work merits
the tremendous amount of time spent
ineditingand production, and whether
it is worth the constant risk in the pub
lishing business.
Since the University Press is a part of
the University (the Board of Trustees is
the copyright owner), a faculty commit
tee must approve any manuscript be
fore the director of the Press may sign
the author to a contract.
The senior editors bring a manus
cript through this contract stage and
slightly beyond, says Seltzer. Then the
work is transferred to an assistant or
associate editor who does the actual

revision once the manuscript has been
accepted.
"These editors," §ays Bell, "are the
ones who take a pencil and attack the
manuscript, trying to improve it."
These editors also work with cartog
raphers to produce the necessary
maps, illustrators for the often intricate
drawings necessary, and indexers.
The next-step is to return the manus
cript to the author who takes all the
changed and suggestions under con
sideration and makes those he sees fit.
The manuscript then comes back to
the Press cleaned up and ready for the
production department to prepare it
for publication.
"The editing process," says Bell, "in
volves taking material that is good
enough and making it better."
But in the course of their day-to-day
activities, the editors sometimes run
into curious problems.
For. example, the Press recently
found a new local printer who could
speed typesetting to four weeks. Un
fortunately, the authorof the first book
planned for typesetting there had just
left for China.
This left a dilemma for the editors,
who had found a way to cut out a great
deal of time involved in the usual pro
cess of mailing back and forth to
typesetters located in Michigan, Texas,
and even Singapore.
This also introduced difficulties of
possible censorship by Chinese au
thorities, especially since the topic of
the book was Chinese history.
Bell went to the Center for United
States-China relations to find the best
way to transport the proofs to and from
China without intervention.
So when the time comes, the Press
will send the proofs along with one of
the many Americans going to China
and get them back for publication in
the same way.
