Senate formulates money bill
Washington — Most of the federal gov
ernment officially runs out of authority to
fund programs and to meet payrolls today,
but the Senate has attempted to-pass a
stop-gap measure.
However, the future of the legislation was
uncertain. The House is in a week-long re
cess and the Senate bill is almost certain to
contain provisions not to the House's liking.
The stage for the last-minute measure was
set iate Friday when the House refused to
bend on controversial language attached to
an emergency funding measure. That lan
guage would have imposed strict standards
on federal funding for abortions and would
have given members of Congress a 5.5-
percent raise — $3200 a year.
The Senate would have accepted the raise,
but the abortion language has been rejected
four times already this year by that body.
And so, just before midnight Friday, the Se
nate voted overwhelmingly to kill the fund
ing bill.
The impasse left several major govern
ment agencies, including the two giants —
defense and health, education and welfare
in a bind. They have no funds to operate
for the new fiscal year, which began at mid
night yesterday, although most agencies are
believed to have leftover funds from the
just-ended fiscal year that could carry them
through a week or two.
The Senate met Saturday to consider the
bill, which was impossible to finish with the
House on vacation.
The Senate's plan calls for the Senate to
attach the emergency funds to an appropria
tions bill that already has passed the House
but not the Senate. This apparently would
get around the constitutional provision that
appropriations bills originate in the House.
Senators indicated their bill would not
contain the controversial House language
on abortion.
Court rules on Amtrak line
Washington — The Supreme Court yester
day overturned a lovyer court order which
would have required Amtrak to continue
running its New York-Kansas City train, the
National Limited, after yesterday.
Chief justice Warren Burger signed the
order vacating a U.S. Appeals Court ruling

that would have required Amtrak to con
tinue operating the National Limited at least
until Oct. 12.
The ruling does not affect four other trains
whose future is being contested in other
courts.
Amtrak had asked both the Supreme
Court and a U.S. Court of Appeals yesterday
to issue an emergency order allowing the rail
company to discontinue the National Li
mited.
Amtrak spokesman Jim Bryant said there
would be no immediate appeal of another
court order requiring passenger service to
continue on three other jeopardized routes
originating in Chicago and going to Seattle,
Houston and Miami. And Amtrak issued or
ders last night to train crews and its own
employees to prepare to run those con
tested trains today.
Bryant said the Court of Appeals petition
asked the full nine-member court to over
turn the action of its two members. The Sup
reme Court petition was referred to Burger,
who had jurisdiction for emergency action,
Bryant said.
The Amtrak spokesman said the petitions
argued that the two Court of Appeals judges
did not have the authority to issue the tem
porary restraining order because the order
already had been refused by another judge.
In addition, Bryant said, a previous court
decision has specified that only the attorney
general can sue Amtrak in such situations.
The suits have been brought by cities and
states served by the four lines. The suit in
volving the National Limited was filed by the
city of Dayton, Ohio.
George Meany to retire
Washington — An ading 85-year-old
George Meany, the undisputed patriarch of
the American labor movement for the past
quarter-century, announced Friday he is re
tiring as AFL-CIO president in November.
Meany, whose gruff voice has counseled
and chastised eight American presidents,
has been in failing health since April, and his
retirement had been expected within the
labor movement.
His decision was relayed to reporters by
AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Lane Kirkland,
57, who is considered a virtual certainty to
succeed Meany as president of the powerful

14-million-member federation at its conven
tion in mid-November.
Kirkland announced Meany's decision
after emerging from a special session of the
AFL-CIO executive council, which unanim
ously endorsed an accord with President
Jimmy Carter on a new voluntary wage-price
guidelines program that organFzed labor will
help shape.
Although a sharp contrast to Meany in
style, the scholarly, soft-spoken Kirkland is
the AFL-CIO president's alter ego on policy
and is expected to pursue the federation's
liberal position on domestic issues and con
servative stances on foreign policy.
Kirkland, who has been the AFL-ClO's No.
2 man for the past decade and Meany's per
sonal choice as successor, told reporters of
Meany's decision at a news conference cal
led to announce the agreement with Carter.
Kirkland said Meany telephoned him Thurs
day night with his decision but gave no
reason.
Asked if he intended to seek Meany's job
in November, Kirkland, a former merchant
mariner from South Carolina, said, "Yes."
Union leaders who sit on AFL-CIO execu
tive council said they were not surprised to
learn of Meany's decision. They also said
Kirkland seemed assured of election to a
two-year term.
Meany, who had been scheduled to pres
ide over the council meeting Friday, re
mained at home with a minor ailment, aides
said. 4
Cuban crisis meeting held
Washington — Top U.S. and Soviet offi
cials held a surprise meeting at the State
Department yesterday as President jimmy
Carter remained at Camp David working on
a speech concerning the Russian brigade in
Cuba.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Soviet
Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin began their
meeting at 2 p.m. but State Department
spokesman David Nail would give no indica
tion of the purpose of the meeting or even
which side had first suggested it.
Carter announced that he would address
the nation tonight at 6 p.m. PDT after negoti
ations with the Soviets apparently had bro
ken down, with the Russians refusing to
budge on Carter's insistence that they

change the "status quo."
The Soviets maintain that the brigade,
which U.S. officials say has 2000 to 3000 sol
diers, 40 tanks and' artillery and armored
personnel carriers, has been stationed in
Cuba since the 1962 missile crisis with the
full knowledge of previous American presi
dents.
In a news conference Friday, Cuban Presi
dent Fidel Castro echoed the hard Soviet
line and accused Carter of creating an artifi
cial crisis.
The president flew by helicopter to his
mountaintop retreat Saturday afternoon,
accompanied by his wife, Rosalynn.
White House spokesman Dale Leibach
said yesterday the president was spending
the day working on his speech. Leibach said
he did not believe Carter had summoned
any speech writers to Camp David, indicat
ing he was going over a draft of the speech
alone with his wife.
Russian troops off Japan
Tokyo — While President Jimmy Carter
wrestles with the question of Soviet troops
in Cuba, the Russians have become involved
in a similar issue on an island just off Japan.
According to a U.S. intelligence report,
about 2000 Soviet military personnel re
cently were moved to Shikotan — one of
four small islands off Hokkaido, Japan's
northernmost main island.
In addition to being thousands of miles
apart in miles, the islands and the controver
sies surrounding them have some basic dif
ferences.
Cuba, 90 miles from U.S. shores, is an
independent country where the Russians
are officially welcome. Shikotan, 60 miles
from Hokkaido, has been'claimed by both
the Soviet Union and Japan since the Soviets
took it over at the end of World War 11.
The territorial dispute with the Russians
over Shikotan and its sister islands is of par
ticular importance in Hokkaido, where
many thousand former inhabitants of the is
lands — Japanese citizens and voters — now
live.
Carter, who has scheduled a television
address for tonight on the Cuban issue, has
said previously that the Soviet troops in
Cuba posed no threat to U.S. security.
Japan's foreign minister, Sunao Sonoda,

returning from the United Nations, told re
porters he did not regard the Soviet troops
on Shikotan as a threat to Japan's security.
Ohira said his" government would take "ap
propriate action," evidently a protest to
Moscow.
Japan's Defense Agency has taken the pos
ition that the troops are "defensive," and
speculates that 260 tanks, 300 armored per
sonnel vehicles, anti-aircraft missiles and
rockets are on the islands.
