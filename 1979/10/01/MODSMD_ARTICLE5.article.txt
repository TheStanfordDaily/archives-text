## Pope urges peace 
### 
Knock, Ireland (AP) â€” Pope
John Paul II took his peace pil
grimage to Ireland's most sac
red shrine, in the bogs of
County Mayo, yesterday and in
a forceful denunciation of ter
rorism declared, "Murder is
murder, no matter what the
motives or ends."
The pontiff called the North
ern Ireland conflict "this great
wound now afflicting our
people" and appealed to the
Virgin Mary to "cure and heal
it."
"Mother, protect all of us
and especially the youth of Ire
land from being overcome by
hostility and hatred," he said.
But it appeared the pope's
pleas for peace were not per
suading the mostly Catholic
guerrillas in British-ruled
Northern Ireland to put down
their arms.
The "war of liberation . . .
will continue," said a Belfast
spokesman forSinn Fein, polit
ical front for the IRA's militant
Provisional wing.
IRA sources in Belfast and
Dublin discounted reports
early yesterday that an uniden
tified "senior member" of the
Provisionals said guerrilla
leaders were considering a
possible truce.
Yesterday, John Paul
made a similar appeal for non

violence to some 250,000
cheering Irish youths gathered
for a Mass at Calway's race
track. But he made a broader
appeal as well, telling the
Catholic youth of the world
that a "moral sickness" stalks
society.
"How many young people
have already warped their con
sciences and have substituted
the true joy of life with drugs,
sex, alcohol, vandalism and the
empty pursuit of mere material
possessions?" he asked.
The pope's stop here pro
duced the first security scare of
his weekend visit. A man, re
portedly shouting "Jesus!" ran
out into an open area and to
ward the pope but was grab
bed by two policeman several
hundred feet from the papal al
ter. Police said he was an En
glishman in his 30s, was not
armed and was taken away for
psychiatric examination.
