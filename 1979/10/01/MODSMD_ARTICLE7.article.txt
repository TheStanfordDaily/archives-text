# Professors question SALT II passage
## 
### Carol Rose 
Matters seem to have reached a point.
The SALT II treaty is near ratification
since the Senate approved the increase in
defense spending last week.
Yet the reports of Russian combat
troops in Cuba could easily disrupt the
proceedings, impairing U.S.-Soviet rela
tions for decades to come.
The United States has known about the
Russian presence in Cuba for along time,
according to Jan Triska, professor of polit
ical science and international relations.

News Analysis

Sen. Frank Church (Chairman of the Se
nate Foreign Relations Committee) visited
Cuba two years ago and said that it was the
beginning of a new relationship between
the United States and Cuba.
"Church knew about it (Soviets in Cuba)
then. Now he is up for reelection, and
there is a political swing to the right."
Triska said Church is using the Cuba issue
to move with it and gain conservative sup
port.
The Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei
Cromyko, has termed the accusations
"falsehoods — nothing has changed."
Yet, reports vary. Coit Clacker, assistant
director of the Arms Control and Disar

mament Program and political science lec
turer says the CIA through aerial surveil
lance had "confirming evidence that the
troops there now represent combat
troops" rather than just the training troops
that were present before.
Few people consider it possible that the
Soviets will back down on the Cuban is
sue, as they did in the missile crisis of 1962.
Law Prof. John Barton said he feels the
major difference is that "Kennedy was
merely stopping a new threat. Carter
wants to change the status quo."
Henry Rowen, prof, of public manage
ment at the business school, emphasizes
that "Carter must first decide how tough
the Russians can be, and then decide how
tough the U.S. will be."
Russians more powerful
In Rowen's opinion, "The Russians are
now much more powerful than they were
in the 19605, and Carter is not trying very
hard."'
When asked if the defense increase will
be enough to offset the Soviet buildup,
Rowen maintains that it is not possible.
"The Soviets have been investing in
military expenditures since the 19605, " he
said," while the U.S. has cut back their
military spending by 60 percent since that
time. Today, the Russians spend three
times as much on defense as the U.S."

Triska claims that the United States still
has the advantage since, he said, "Exces
sive military spending tends <o reduce
security, not to strengthen it, not only be
cause it reduces other essentia! sectors
and social services, but also because it
fuels a futile and reactive arms race."
He said that in all conventional weapons
areas the Soviet Union is beating the Un
ited States.
SALT II 'chancy'
As for the chances of SALT II now pas
sing the Senate, Rowen states, "Very
chancy — we just didn't expect those
troops in Cuba. There are more and more
reasons not to vote for it."
Blacker feels that it may pass only with
some type of compromise on the Cuban
issue. "We must satisfy the Senate and still
let the Soviet Union keep face, because
they will not withdraw.
"Perhaps the best solution," he
suggests, "would be to either to ask the
Soviet Union to turn over combat equip
ment to the Cubans and/or to prohibit
maneuvers."
Meanwhile he hopes that the vote on
the treaty will be postponed at least until
1980. If Carter's panel of Cuba experts
cannot find some compromise, Barton
predicts "SALT II will be withdrawn — stal
led on a very, very long term basis."


Business school professor Henty Rowen said he feels that SALT II
passage is "chancy."
