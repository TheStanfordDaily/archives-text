# Terrorists find refuge in U.S.

Chicago (AP) — Ziyad Abu
Eain, a young Palestinian
wanted for murder in Israel,
may have the U.S. government
caught in an extradition Catch
22 that federal officials say they
can't afford to lose.
Abu Eain, charged with set
ting off a bomb in a crowded
Israeli marketplace that killed
two civilians, stands a fair
chance of staying in this coun
try — even if the U.S. govern
ment can show there's a reason
to believe he is guilty.
And if he does, say pro
secutors in the case and such
Jewish groups as the American
Jewish Committee and Anti-
Defamation League, the Un
ited States is opening its door
as "a haven for terrorists."
Furthermore, the case of
19-year-old Abu Eain comes less
than six months after the U.S.
government lost a similar ex
tradition attempt in California
involving Peter McMullen, a
member of the Irish Republi

can Army.
McMullen, sought for ex
tradition by England for bomb
ing a British army barracks,
convinced a federal magistrate
the bombing was committed in
the name of a political cause.
He is now living in the United
States.
Government officials —
from the State Department to
the Justice Department —
admit that after the McMullen
ruling, pressure now is on gov
ernment attorneys to convince
a federal magistrate in Chicago
that Abu Eain should be extra
dited.
Political acts exempt
Recent court decisions, not
ably the one involving McMul
len, have held that terrorist
acts may be classified as "polit
ical" under the political offense
exemption of U.S. extradition
treaties with foreign countries,
including Israel.
Extradition, the U.S.-Israeli
treaty says, shall not be granted
"when the offense is regarded
. . . as one of a political charac
ter or if the person sought
proves that the request for his
extradition has . . . been made
with a vieWto trying or punish
ing him for an offense of a
political character."
But these two cases raise a
thorny question. How can an
act of apparent terrorism,
abhorred by the U.S. govern
ment, be excluded from the
category of "political" ac
tivities long sheltered by the
U.S. Constitution.
Abu Eain, a citizen of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank,
came to Chicago in June on a
visitor's visa before he was
charged with the May 14 bomb
ing in Tiberias, Israel. He was
arrested by the FBI in August
on the extradition request and
is now in a federal prison after
having been denied bail.
William Goodman, a San
Francisco lawyer who de
fended McMullen, explained
in a telephone interview his
view of the political offense
exemption and how govern
ment attorneys here may have
a tough fight.
"Historically, the political of
fense exemption has worked

to the benefit of people who
might nowadays be considered
terrorists, if you want to call
•them terrorists," said Good
man.
Court decisions, including
McMullen, have held that a de
fendant is exempt from extrad
ition if his crimes are part of an
insurrectional movement to
undermine an existing gov
ernment, Goodman said. In
addition, the individual must
be a bona fide member of that
movement, such as the PLO or
the IRA.
While denying that Abu Eain
set off the bomb — an act for
which the PLO claimed re
sponsibility — Abdeen Jabara,
a lawyer for Abu Eain, nonethe
less acknowledges that the
young Palestinian supports the
PLO and argues the act was
political.
Government lawyers con
tend attacking innocent civi
lians in a marketplace is a
"criminal act of terrorism, as
distinguished from an act of a
political character." They indi
cate they will try to do what
government attorneys in the
McMullen case failed to do: es
tablish a distinction between a
political and terrorist act.
But Goodman doubts the ar
gument will work.
"In the abstract, it has a cer
tain amount of emotional ap
peal, but when you apply the
law it's beside the point," he
said. "It can be shown that
bombing innocent civilians is a
PLO tactic to keep Israeli popu
lation in a state of terror.
"If this has been the objec
tive of the PLO, then it's obvi
ously done to accomplish a
strategic political end. It makes
perfectly good sense, whether
you agree with it or not."
If the government loses the
Abu Eain case, federal immig
ration authorities could still
deport the Palestinian. But
Lawrence Chamblee, a Justice
Department official, says de
portation is not a substitute for
extradition. Indeed, Mcmullen
is fighting deportation now.
"A person fighting deporta
tion can sway in this country
indefinitely," Chamblee said.

But these two cases raise a
thorny question. How can an
act of apparent terrorism,
abhorred by the U.S. govern
ment, be excluded from the
category of "political" ac
tivities long sheltered by the
U.S. Constitution.
Abu Eain, a citizen of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank,
came to Chicago in June on a
visitor's visa before he was
charged with the May 14 bomb
ing in Tiberias, Israel. He was
arrested by the FBI in August
on the extradition request and
is now in a federal prison after
having been denied bail.
William Goodman, a San
Francisco lawyer who de
fended McMullen, explained
in a telephone interview his
view of the political offense
exemption and how govern
ment attorneys here may have
a tough fight.
"Historically, the political of
fense exemption has worked

to the benefit of people who
might nowadays be considered
terrorists, if you want to call
•them terrorists," said Good
man.
Court decisions, including
McMullen, have held that a de
fendant is exempt from extrad
ition if his crimes are part of an
insurrectional movement to
undermine an existing gov
ernment, Goodman said. In
addition, the individual must
be a bona fide member of that
movement, such as the PLO or
the IRA.
While denying that Abu Eain
set off the bomb — an act for
which the PLO claimed re
sponsibility — Abdeen Jabara,
a lawyer for Abu Eain, nonethe
less acknowledges that the
young Palestinian supports the
PLO and argues the act was
political.
Government lawyers con
tend attacking innocent civi
lians in a marketplace is a
"criminal act of terrorism, as
distinguished from an act of a
political character." They indi
cate they will try to do what
government attorneys in the
McMullen case failed to do: es
tablish a distinction between a
political and terrorist act.
But Goodman doubts the ar
gument will work.
"In the abstract, it has a cer
tain amount of emotional ap
peal, but when you apply the
law it's beside the point," he
said. "It can be shown that
bombing innocent civilians is a
PLO tactic to keep Israeli popu
lation in a state of terror.
"If this has been the objec
tive of the PLO, then it's obvi
ously done to accomplish a
strategic political end. It makes
perfectly good sense, whether
you agree with it or not."
If the government loses the
Abu Eain case, federal immig
ration authorities could still
deport the Palestinian. But
Lawrence Chamblee, a Justice
Department official, says de
portation is not a substitute for
extradition. Indeed, Mcmullen
is fighting deportation now.
"A person fighting deporta
tion can sway in this country
indefinitely," Chamblee said.
Chicago (AP) — Ziyad Abu
Eain, a young Palestinian
wanted for murder in Israel,
may have the U.S. government
caught in an extradition Catch
22 that federal officials say they
can't afford to lose.
Abu Eain, charged with set
ting off a bomb in a crowded
Israeli marketplace that killed
two civilians, stands a fair
chance of staying in this coun
try — even if the U.S. govern
ment can show there's a reason
to believe he is guilty.
And if he does, say pro
secutors in the case and such
Jewish groups as the American
Jewish Committee and Anti-
Defamation League, the Un
ited States is opening its door
as "a haven for terrorists."
Furthermore, the case of
19-year-old Abu Eain comes less
than six months after the U.S.
government lost a similar ex
tradition attempt in California
involving Peter McMullen, a
member of the Irish Republi

can Army.
McMullen, sought for ex
tradition by England for bomb
ing a British army barracks,
convinced a federal magistrate
the bombing was committed in
the name of a political cause.
He is now living in the United
States.
Government officials —
from the State Department to
the Justice Department —
admit that after the McMullen
ruling, pressure now is on gov
ernment attorneys to convince
a federal magistrate in Chicago
that Abu Eain should be extra
dited.
Political acts exempt
Recent court decisions, not
ably the one involving McMul
len, have held that terrorist
acts may be classified as "polit
ical" under the political offense
exemption of U.S. extradition
treaties with foreign countries,
including Israel.
Extradition, the U.S.-Israeli
treaty says, shall not be granted
"when the offense is regarded
. . . as one of a political charac
ter or if the person sought
proves that the request for his
extradition has . . . been made
with a vieWto trying or punish
ing him for an offense of a
political character."
