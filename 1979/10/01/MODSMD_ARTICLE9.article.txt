# Youngsters lose cupcake argument
## 
### 
Pleasant Hill (AP) _ The Great Cupcake
Debate is over, and the kids at Pleasant Hill
Elementary School have lost. No more of
those tasty but sugar-loaded morsels are
for sale during traditional "Cupcake
Days."
Like so many cupcakes, the kids' picket
ing, the rhetoric, and the arguments,
crumbled.
It was clearly not only a lesson in nutri
tion, but in civics as well.
Exercising pre-puberty urges for par
ticipatory democracy, the youngsters
mounted a protest petition and picketing
campaign, and convinced many newspap
ers and television stations to cover the
story.
" They were very effective in getting pub
licity," said Luann Duggan, a teacher.
The students' reaction came after the
PTA eliminated its popular after-school
sale of parent-made cupcakes to the stu
dents.
Ed Adams, principal of the 500-student

school in this normally quiet suburb 25
miles east of San Francisco, was impressed
by the protest including placards reading:
"Kids Crave Cupcakes."
Formal debate
So he arranged a formal debate, held
Wednesday before about 75 parents and
teachers.
"All we ask for is a cupcake every now
and then," pleaded sixth-grade debater
Anthony Damaschini, pointing out that
cupcakes are sold only about five times a
year but sugar-laced chocolate milk is av- *
ailable daily at the cafeteria.
The other sixth-grade debater, Daryl
Hardy, accused the adults of age discrimi
nation. "The high school sells cookies and
Snickers every day, and everybody buys
them, because they're all sold out," he
said.
But their arguments lost out to their de
bate foes.
Second-grade teacher Mabel Bumala
said that as a child, "I developed an abso

lute craving for sweets to the point where I
really ruined my body."
Why the cupcake ban? "It's only be
cause we love you," Mrs. Bumala said.
Mrs. Pat Wilcox, a first-grade teacher,
stressed the need for students developing
good nutritional habits, and she said that
rated cupcakes as a definite negative.
The PTA then voted overwhelmingly to
uphold the cupcake ban. Noting that cup
cakes had sweetened the PTA treasury by
$400 a year, members also voted to raise
annual dues from one dollar to two dol
lars.
"The kids were kind of railroaded,"
commented school custodian Frank Dic
key. "The whole school should have been
allowed to vote. You'd better believe the
vote would have been to keep cupcakes
then."
PTA members did create a committee to
look into possible alternatives, such as
possibly selling popcorn or "nutritional
cupcakes."
