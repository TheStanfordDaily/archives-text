Local interviews
for software professionals
The purpose of every Wang product is the same:
to enhance productivity
At Wang Laboratories, we make computer and word processing systems.
But we're really not in the computer or word processing business.
Our business is productivity. And that's a people business.
Because it's people who produce. Machines just make it easier.
Maybe all this sounds obvious. But you'd be surprised how many com
puter and word processing manufacturers forget that the end users of
their products are people.
At Wang, we never forget.
That's why our products are simpler to use than theirs. And more
efficient.
And that's why we're growing faster than anybody else in the business.
And that's why we're interested in Bachelor s, Master's or PhD
candidates.
