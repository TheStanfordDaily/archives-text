# Carter says no return to Cold War
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — President
jimmy Carter reported to the nation
last night that the Soviet Union is not
removing its troops from Cuba, but
he said the controversy "is certainly
no reason for a return to the Cold
War" and should not block Senate
approval of an arms treaty.
Carter said he has received "assur
ances from the highest levels of the
Soviet government" that the troops
are manning a training center in
Cuba and offer no direct threat to
U.S. security.
Nevertheless, the president said,
"We shall not rest on these Soviet
statements alone," and he an
nounced that the United States is in
creasing its own military presence in
the Caribbean.
The president said a far greater
threat than the Soviet troops in Cuba
would be a Senate refusal to ratify the
strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT
II) signed by Carter and Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev.
Status quo
In recent weeks, Carter had said
the United States would act on its
own to change the situation if no ag
reement could be reached with the
Soviets. He said, "The status quo is
not acceptable."
In his nationally broadcast speech
last night, Carter said Soviet officials
insisted that the brigade is a training
unit, not a combat unit. He said
Soviet officials had indicated, "they
will not change its function or status
as a training center."
"We understand this to mean that
they do not intend to enlarge the unit
or give it additional capabilities,"
Carter said.
No threat
The president also reported assur
ances that the Soviet personnel on
the island "will not be a threat to the
U.S. or to any other nation."
It was understood that the Soviet
assurances Carter cited were expres
sed in a personal exchange last week
between Carter and Brezhnev.
Earlier yesterday, Sen. Frank
Church, Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman, met with the
president for a briefing on Carter's
speech.
The Idaho Democrat said, "I think
we can salvage the SALT treaty, and
I'm looking for a way to do it. I don't
think that SALT is scuttled. I believe
that a way can be worked out that is
satisfactory to the Senate."
Mixed reactions
Reaction to the Carter address was
mixed on Capitol Hill, but it was clear
that Carter's speech did not quell
Senate concerns.
Sen. Richard Stone (D-Fla.), said
he was disappointed that Carter did
not win a commitment to remove or
dismantle the brigade and that the
issue could not be separated from
SALT II deliberations.
Sen. John Tower (R-Texas) said, "I
don't think the president is doing
anything to show that we mean busi
ness ... I think many Americans will
be disappointed and I think very few
will be reassured."
Ratification action
Senate Democratic Whip Alan
Cranston however, praised Carter's
approach, contending that the issue
"points up the urgency of Senate ac
tion on ratification before the end of
this year."
Soviet officials have insisted pub
licly for weeks that the Russian
troops in Cuba are not a combat
brigade and that they have been
there for years. Carter confirmed
that U.S. experts believe "this unit
had existed for several years, proba
bly since the mid 1970s and possibly
even longer." But he did not go so far
as to accept the Soviet characteriza
tion of the brigade as a training force.
"Just recently," Carter said,
"American intelligence obtained
persuasive evidence that some of
these forces had been organized into
a combat unit."
A senior intelligence official who
asked not to be named told reporters
the U.S. government is "highly con
fident" that the Soviet unit does not
train Cubans and, in fact, "has not
observable connection with the
Cuban military."

sed in a personal exchange last week
between Carter and Brezhnev.
Earlier yesterday, Sen. Frank
Church, Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman, met with the
president for a briefing on Carter's
speech.
The Idaho Democrat said, "I think
we can salvage the SALT treaty, and
I'm looking for a way to do it. I don't
think that SALT is scuttled. I believe
that a way can be worked out that is
satisfactory to the Senate."
Mixed reactions
Reaction to the Carter address was
mixed on Capitol Hill, but it was clear
that Carter's speech did not quell
Senate concerns.
Sen. Richard Stone (D-Fla.), said
he was disappointed that Carter did
not win a commitment to remove or
dismantle the brigade and that the
issue could not be separated from
SALT II deliberations.
Sen. John Tower (R-Texas) said, "I
don't think the president is doing
anything to show that we mean busi
ness ... I think many Americans will
be disappointed and I think very few
will be reassured."
Ratification action
Senate Democratic Whip Alan
Cranston however, praised Carter's
approach, contending that the issue
"points up the urgency of Senate ac
tion on ratification before the end of
this year."
Soviet officials have insisted pub
licly for weeks that the Russian
troops in Cuba are not a combat
brigade and that they have been
there for years. Carter confirmed
that U.S. experts believe "this unit
had existed for several years, proba
bly since the mid 1970s and possibly
even longer." But he did not go so far
as to accept the Soviet characteriza
tion of the brigade as a training force.
"Just recently," Carter said,
"American intelligence obtained
persuasive evidence that some of
these forces had been organized into
a combat unit."
A senior intelligence official who
asked not to be named told reporters
the U.S. government is "highly con
fident" that the Soviet unit does not
train Cubans and, in fact, "has not
observable connection with the
Cuban military."
