If you have walked through downtown
Palo Alto this autumn, you have proba
bly seen a young man in cutoffs painting a
large brown locomotive on the blank wall
of Printers Inc. Bookstore at California
and Birch. The artist is Noel Consigny, and
he is painting a mural of the old Mayfield
railroad as one of three community arts
projects.
Consigny said that Palo Alto had re
ceived a federal CETA grant to help fund a
nine month project to paint murals
throughout the city. However, the CETA
grant is only funding 33 percent of the
project. Jeffrey Leathers of the Printers
Inc. Bookstore said that the bookstore is
trying to raise the rest of the money
through contributions from the commun
ity. He added that he hopes Palo Alto resi
dents will become increasingly involved in
the project since the bookstore is trying to
make the mural "public art."
All tips from the coffee bar in the store
go towards the mural, he said.
Leathers also said that the old locomo
tive was chosen as the subject for the
mural because "we wanted something re
ally, really local and specitically California
Ave."

Originally, California Ave. was the main
street of a town called Mayfield, which
existed 50-75 years before Palo Alto. The
Mayfield Railroad, one of the first in the
West, was built in 1863. It was originally
meant to run from San Francisco to San
Jose, but for several months in 1863 the
Mayfield Station (where the California
Ave. station is now) was the end of the
line.
End of the line
Asked if the railroad was chosen as sub
ject matter for the mural because South
Pacific is threatening to shut oft commuter
service to Palo Alto, Leathers said that it
had been a contributing factor in their de
cision.
"But our main motive is to make Palo
Alto residents aware of their railroad his
tory and of the glory of the old railroad, he
said. "We're not trying to get politically
involved."
Not 'politically involved
The railroad engine is taken from a , ■
tion of a photograph of old Mayfield which
was found in the librars Originally a mural
of the whole town ot Mayfield h id been
planned, but the locomotive was chosen
because "it mat' bolder, more power*

ful graphic piece, according to Leathers.
"The ideas (in the mural) are mutual be
tween myself and the owners of the store'
said Consigny. The artist added, "Tin
mural is an adaptation of my individual
creative desire to that of others."
When an onlooker asked if the loconio
tive was as good as hi -. he murals, Con
signy replied, "Twice as good!
Challenge
Asked it this mural was harder or les i
difficult to paint than his other murals,
Consigny stated, "I take everything as a
challenge. Challenges e h.illenges,
None are more or less difficult th. n any
other."
"The booksto • was chosen as site fo
the mural " said Leathers, because "it's e
very public, intellectual place and it lias c
huge, huge blank wall."
Consi , ,y has been working on the rail
road rue the beginning of September
He liiis also painted birds on the Roots
store at Cowper and University and the
wall of the Good Earth restaurant at Emer
son and University as part of the projeel
funded by the CETA tyrant.
