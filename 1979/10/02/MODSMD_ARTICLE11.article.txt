## Roddenberry discuses Star Trek

"To boldly go where no man
has gone before."
The credo of the starsh>p En
terprise is more than familiar to
Star Trek fans who have
watched Captain Kirk and Dr.
Spock discover new planets
and civilizations, fend off
hordes of ravaging Klingons
and Romulans and deal with
mysteries of space-such as the
Changeling and Computer
M-5.
Star Trek was a television
show that stimulated the mind,
offering new ideas and striving
for the ideals man has sought
for centuries. It was "a show
based on ideas at a time when
television shows did not try to
convey any meaning," said
Gene Roddenberry, producer
of the show which now ap
pears only on syndicated re
runs.
Appearing at De Anza Col
lege Saturday night, Rodden
berry told his audience of the
difficulties and challenges his
show faced from its inception.
He also confirmed the De
cember release of the new
Star Trek movie.
What made Star Trek unique
was that it was not afraid to ask
audiences to think and to con
sider their own values, Rod
denberry said.
He told how the goal of the
show was to present man as he
would evolve to be two, three
or four centuries from now.
Roddenberry calls it "projec
tive history.
"The original pilot of the
show, for example, was sup
posed to have an equal
number of men and women,
and even a woman as second in

command. But the network
decided the public wasn't
quite ready for this and told us
to cut it to 50 percent women,"
he said.
Sponsors also had objec
tions. When Star Trek began,
the tobacco industry com
plained that no one on the
show smoked and refused to
sponsor it.

'What made Star Trek unique was that it
was not afraid to ask audiences to think
and to consider their own values. . . . It
was a show based on ideas at a time when
television shows did not try to convey any
meaning/

"We hoped by that time no
one would smoke," Rodden
berry explained.
And although television
today has taken Star Trek's lead
in producing shows based on
ideas, Roddenberry continues
to contrast his show with its
more recent followers in the
science fiction market.

He mentioned ABC's now
defunct Battlestar Galactica as
a case in point. "I don't think
abandoning the home base to
go dogfight with the enemy is
what science fiction is all ab
out," Roddenberry said.
"One benefit of the motion
picture," he said, "is that we
had an opportunity to go into
much more depth for each of

the characters."
Roddenberry said he plans
to wait and see how the first
movie turns out before he con
siders making sequels. He did
say that Paramount, the studio
that made the movie, is think
ing about making a major
series of movies.
Roddenberry said this would

be quite an accomplishment,
considering that it took
Paramount four and a half
years to accept the initial script
for the movie.
"The studios couldn't be
lieve we had such a following.
They thought I had a group of
people I called to write tan let
ters for us or something, he
said.
When Roddenberry lirst
brought his script to
Paramount, it took about two
years before they reluctantlv
suggested he do a two-hour IV
special.
"Then came Star Wars, and,
as the lines in front of the
theaters grew, Paramount de
cided to go ahead with the
movie," Roddenberry said.
Any thoughts of a return to
television will have to wait until
all Star Trek movies are
exhausted, he said. "At this
stage, it is much easier to make
money with a motion picture
than on television."
