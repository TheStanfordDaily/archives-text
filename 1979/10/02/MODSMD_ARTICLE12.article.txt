## If students only knew how to learn 
### 
"VVhat am I learning?"
"What do I want to learn?"
"Why?"
Not all of us begin to ask our
selves these questions, and not
all those who begin, persist.
Vet such questions are the be
ginning and essence of what
Clark Rogers calls "significant
learning," learning which leads
to change and growth in the
individual, which is self
appropriated and personally
relevant.
Instead, a significant
number of students, even
those ostensibly pursuing a
"liberal education," never get
out of the take-notes-study
take-tests-forge t-everyt hi ng
style of learning. Why do so
many students still believe
"this isn't life, this is college?"
Neil Postman and Charles
Weingartner, in Teaching as a
Subversive Activity , suggest
some answers. Students do not
begin to really learn simply
because no one ever showed
them how — not at home, in
school or in college. Many of
those who got a start do not
continue to learn because they
are never adequately and sys
tematically rewarded for it —
with praise, grades, high
status, or money — as they are
for conformity, "hard work,"
and respect for authority.
"Self-motivation," despite
the praise sung to it, is weak,
unreliable, and nebulous,
generally succumbing to the
pressures of current external
rewards and punishments. The
exceptions ditler trom most of
us only with respect to one or
two aspects of their lives and
not as a general rule
Pressures
The greater college envi

ronment is not facilitative of
"significant learning." Pres
sures focus attention outward,
towards classes, social events,
and future job prospects, and
seldom inward, towards one's
needs, one's values and as
sumptions, and the cir
cumstances of one's life. Sup
port, encouragement, and the
freedom to make mistakes,
necessary for the active ex
perimentation and inquiry that
is learning, are rare and
pleasurable experiences in the
student's life, not his/her regu
lar, dependable experience.
Thus students learn about sub
jects but not about themselves
or each other, about what
answers they have to give but
not about what questions they
wish to ask, or how to go about
asking them.
Lack of role models
Lack of good role models
also contributes to the prob
lem. A student's life may be
such that he/she doesn't see
anyone engaged in "significant
learning'.' Somepeoplearound
him/her may not show it — a
professor may feel great chal
lenge in research but be bored
while teaching, a student may
appear in class because it's re
quired but do an ARI O project
because he/she wants to. Some
potential models may not be
around at all — a VIA volunteer
in Asia, a stop-out biking ac
ross Europe, a drop-out start
ing a small business in L.A.
Others still may not be en
gaged in "significan* learning"
at all, or care to, accepting their
lives as they are.
Missing out
The result is that some stu
dents don't know what they are

missing, or even that they are
missing anything at all. Low
expectations, the result of
twelve years of public educa
tion, may prevent someone
from realizing that other
people with higher expecta
tions do seek and find experi
ences which satisfy them.
No middleground?
Others may perceive those
people who have found such
experiences as too dissimilar
from themselves, in either
abilities or values or both, to
take them as models for how
they themselves might be.
They may feel it is either four
straight years of college or
starting a commune in Ore
gon, and see no middleground
where they might more ac
tively pursue their interests.
All these factors discourage
'significant learning' but do not
precludeit. Howthenareweto
break out of habits and cir
cumstances, and begin this
process? Several things should
be kept in mind.
First, as Postman and Wein
gartner say, "the critical con
tent of any learning experience
is the method or process
through which the learning oc
curs." It is what you do that is
ultimately important.
Variety and security
Second, you must attend to
both variety and security. Vari
ety — in the classes you take,
the people you associate with,
the activities you engage in —
challenges your present ways
of knowing the world and
opens you to new possibilities.
Security — in the familiarity of
old friendships and old ac
tivities, in taking time out from
the hustle and bustle — allows
you to reflect upon and assimi
late the experiences you en

counter while retaining your
sense of yourself.
Third and last, you can only
hegin from where you are, and
only go where you wish to. The
first step is always getting to
know yourself — all of yourself
— and where you wish to go.
Keep a journal, talk to people
who will listen to you and re
veal you to yourself. Then, take
a step — not a jump, a step —
and you're on your way! Wel
come.
