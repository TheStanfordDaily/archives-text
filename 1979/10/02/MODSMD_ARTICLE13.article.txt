Mascot debate
I read with great interest the
article on the rekindling of the
mascot controversy (Daily,
Sept. 28). I think the article in
cluded an enlightening com
mentary on the mentality of
Larry/iebell and perhaps other
supporters of the Indian mas

cot reinstitution. Ziebell is
quoted as calling the native
Americans' demand for the
ban on the Indian Richard Ly
man's first test as president.
Give me a break. Anyone
who has any knowledge of the
University's history must laugh
out loud at stupidity. The
mascot issue surfaced in 1972.

What happened to such events
as the Medical Center protest
of April 1971 or the H. Bruce
Franklin affair? What about the
numerous demonstrations
which "tested" the president
during his first 18 months be
fore the mascot issue arose?
But historical inaccuracy
aside, I personally think the
whole discussion is stupid. It is
beyond me how anyone can
really care if we are called the
Cards or the Trees or the what
ever.
However, if there is one side
which makes total sense, it is
that group which opposes the
use of the Indian. Native
Americans certainly do not de
serve to have their culture
ridiculed through exploitation
of their ritual dances whether
the ridicule is intentional or
not. Could we consider the
Stanford Yids? Certainly not.
Every Jew on campus would
(justifiably) take offense if we
dressed up a willing subject in
Hassidic garb to prance around
chanting the lamentations. The
analogy holds. And so should
the respect for native Ameri
cans' feelings on this issue.
I oppose the efforts to
reinstate the Indian, and I en
courage everyone to do sc.
The T-shirt sales and feather
distribution should be boycot
ted in an effort to nip this
whole campaign in the bud.
Perhaps the best way to do
this is to finally decide on what
the mascot will be. After that,
let's drop the whole issue and
return debate around the Uni
versity to more substantive is
sues.
