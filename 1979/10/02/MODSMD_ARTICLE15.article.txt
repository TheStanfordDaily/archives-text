## Matt Leipzig America lacking a symbol 
### 
When you've spent several hours trying to
concoct an original column, or have written and
torn up short pieces on all the stock subjects —
Kennedy and Carter, oil crises, youth and voter
apathy — you begin to realize that one of the key
problems facing this country's people isn't a
presence but an absence: the absence of any
discernable political or social fabric, the ab
sence of unified commitment, the absence of
common goals to achieve and challenges to
conquer.
How (and if) this pertains to our political and
economic future I'm not certain, but of its utter
importance to our abilities to progress socially,
culturally and personally, I am convinced.
America doesn't need leaders
I'm not reiterating the dry observations about
modern America's lack of leaders. America
doesn't need leaders now. It may have needed
them once, in times of war perhaps, but
peacetime dilemmas, even the worst of them,
are best solved by coalitions and common
causes, not by single heroes.
Nor do I refer to President Carter's ill-fated
"crisis-of-confidence" remarks. I doubt if
Americans now are any more insecure than they
were a decade or two ago, nor more jittery on
dates, nor more suicidal and neurotic, nor more
melancholy.
I'm not even thinking of the deterioration of
'60s-style causes, though that's closer to my
point. What I consider is the complete debunk
ing of America's symbols. We have been left as a
society without a focal point.
The movie industry, for example, once stood
as America's prime symbol. It represented, in
the '30s and '40s, opportunity, newness
and innovation, artistic success and common
enjoyment. The myth of "The Industry" has
since been dismantled. Opportunities have
shrunk and overnight successes are nearly
non-existent; indeed, fewer films are made.
Aesthetic quality has been dismissed and face
less conglomerates (i.e. MCA) churn out flicks

that look like extended situation comedies.
The car too was once a central symbol. The
model 'A' Ford and the '54 Corvette (top off)
must have represented to their generations mo
bility, success and freedom. The car is still a
symbol of sorts, but a negative one: pollution,
consumption, perhaps violence.
Even rock music, once a symbol of youth de
fiance and independence, is no longer a myth:
only another med : a event.
We've looked inward
Our reaction to this loss of symbolism has
been predictable. We have looked inwardly, to
ourselves. Personal health, personal belief, per
sonal mental conditioning are the standards to
day. The emphasis on the self is in part produc
tive. Those fantasies once acted out symboli
cally through films, cars and music may now"be
realized to greater fulfillment.
But there is also a dangerous prospect in the
turn to the self: narcissism. This should be of
particular importance to members of the Uni
versity community. For all of us, regardless of
study, ought to be here to participate in the
continuous discourse leading to new problems,
ideas, solutions. The engineer, writer and
athlete all partake of this discourse, each ex
panding his experience. But the discourse is
always dialogue, never a monologue.
Narcissism destructive
Yesterday's symbols tied society together;
today's narcissism could reduce the social fabric
to a collection of isolated, individual threads.
Such a dissolution would make pre
professionalism more rampant, anti
intellectualism more pronounced, and all of us,
probably, more lonely.
The individual entering the '80s, then, faces a
challenge. It is no less simple than
looking in the mirror, seeing his face and accept
ing it while realizing that others' faces are in the
background. And it is no less complex than that.

The movie industry, for example, once stood
as America's prime symbol. It represented, in
the '30s and '40s, opportunity, newness
and innovation, artistic success and common
enjoyment. The myth of "The Industry" has
since been dismantled. Opportunities have
shrunk and overnight successes are nearly
non-existent; indeed, fewer films are made.
Aesthetic quality has been dismissed and face
less conglomerates (i.e. MCA) churn out flicks

that look like extended situation comedies.
The car too was once a central symbol. The
model 'A' Ford and the '54 Corvette (top off)
must have represented to their generations mo
bility, success and freedom. The car is still a
symbol of sorts, but a negative one: pollution,
consumption, perhaps violence.
Even rock music, once a symbol of youth de
fiance and independence, is no longer a myth:
only another med : a event.
We've looked inward
Our reaction to this loss of symbolism has
been predictable. We have looked inwardly, to
ourselves. Personal health, personal belief, per
sonal mental conditioning are the standards to
day. The emphasis on the self is in part produc
tive. Those fantasies once acted out symboli
cally through films, cars and music may now"be
realized to greater fulfillment.
But there is also a dangerous prospect in the
turn to the self: narcissism. This should be of
particular importance to members of the Uni
versity community. For all of us, regardless of
study, ought to be here to participate in the
continuous discourse leading to new problems,
ideas, solutions. The engineer, writer and
athlete all partake of this discourse, each ex
panding his experience. But the discourse is
always dialogue, never a monologue.
Narcissism destructive
Yesterday's symbols tied society together;
today's narcissism could reduce the social fabric
to a collection of isolated, individual threads.
Such a dissolution would make pre
professionalism more rampant, anti
intellectualism more pronounced, and all of us,
probably, more lonely.
The individual entering the '80s, then, faces a
challenge. It is no less simple than
looking in the mirror, seeing his face and accept
ing it while realizing that others' faces are in the
background. And it is no less complex than that.
