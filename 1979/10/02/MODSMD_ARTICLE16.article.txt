## Government to blame, not capitalism 
### 
David Sartoris' mushy
analysis in his column on
capitalism in the September
27 Daily is typical of trendy
anti-economic thought which
would cure the U.S. economy
of its success. Compared to
that column, oatmeal feels like
concrete. The theme of the
column seems to have been
that capitalism has caused
many problems, and that more
societal (a euphemism for gov
ernmental) control will some
how solve them.
First, Sartoris says "inflation,
unemployment, and lack of
public confidence in govern
ment" exist because the
capitalistic "ide?" . . has not
been met in recer,. years." The
government, and not
capitalism, is in fact to blame
for these ills, and for most of
the others Sartoris lays at the
feet of free enterprise.
Inflation is caused primarily
by the government spending
more than it receives. The
money supply is increased with
no corresponding increase in
the supply of goods. Ergo,
prices go up.
A significant reason for un
employment is the minimum
wage, a device by which the
government, instead of the
marketplace, decides what a
worker is worth. People barely
worth a lower minimum wage
are laid off (or not hired) when
the wage is raised. President
Carter himself admitted while
signing the latest minimum
wage boost that the bill would
increase unemployment. With
the stroke of a pen, he was fir
ing many of those earning

$2.65/ hour, and paying off his
debt to George Meany. In addi
tion, a higher minimum wage
increases labor costs with no
increase in productivity. This
feeds inflation.
Historically, the only cures
for unemployment have been
war or totalitarianism. Would
Sartoris prefer either of these
to capitalism's unemploy
ment?
For Sartoris to relate some
how lack of confidence in gov
ernment to capitalism's failings
is nonsensical. Government is
perceived as existing more for
its own benefit than the
people's. Will more govern
ment control of business
change this?
The BART strike and
threatened gas station shut
down are Sartoris' symptoms
of the fracturing of society
caused by capitalism. BART, a
public entity, has some of the
worst management conceiva
ble and a history of overpaid
employees and outlandish
promises never kept. BART's
dismal record is close to those
of many state-owned indus
tries in socialist Britain.
It is government, and not
capitalism, which provoked
the gas shutdown. Dealer mar
kups on gasoline &re control
led by the Department of
Energy. This is the antithesis of
capitalism.
It was DOE fuel allocations
which excerbated, if not
caused, the gas crunch in the
first place. Unfettered
capitalism would have put the
gas where it was needed, in
stead of where the government

thought it should be, which
was where the cars weren't.
Sartoris bemoans poor el
derly citizens and cutbacks in
school extracurricular ac
tivities caused by Proposition
13. Again, look to government,
not to capitalism, for a villain.
The elderly poor, and
everyone else, have been sold
a bill of goods regarding Social
Security. Social Security was
originally intended to be a
supplement to other retire
ment incomes, either pensions
or savings. But government
largesse in hiking benefits, so
that they had little relation to
contributions, made people
think of Social Security as their
primary source of income after
retirement. Now, thanks to this
government mismanagement,
Social Security faces ban
kruptcy. Social Security should
be abolished, and replaced by
government-mandated re
tirement accounts. That way,
people would be forced to save
for their old age, but could
manage their own assets. If this
had happened 40 years ago, we
wouldn't be in this mess today.

Proposition 13 was a righte
ous citizenry's reaction to gov
ernment taxation and spend
ing. California's surplus grew
and grew, and there was no
legislative groundswell in favor
of returning it to the taxpayers.
Though Prop. 13 attacked Sac
ramento indirectly through the
counties, the surplus is now
shrinking. Everyone knows
that that surplus was created by
government-caused inflation.
Government spends money
in the wrong directions and/or
with poor results. No one ac
cuses public schools of doing a
good job over the last 10-15
years, in spite of billions spent
and catchy new programs. San
Francisco has expensive street
sweepers and had parking
meter attendants who were
thieves.
Space does not permit
further exposure of Sartoris' fal
lacies. A clear lesson is to look
to government before blaming
any other entity for society's
problems.

It is government, and not
capitalism, which provoked
the gas shutdown. Dealer mar

capitalism.
It was DOE fuel allocations
which excerbated, if not

thought it should be, which
was where the cars weren't.
Sartoris bemoans poor el

13. Again, look to government,
not to capitalism, for a villain.
The elderly poor, and
everyone else, have been sold
a bill of goods regarding Social
Security. Social Security was
originally intended to be a
supplement to other retire
ment incomes, either pensions
or savings. But government
largesse in hiking benefits, so
that they had little relation to
contributions, made people
think of Social Security as their
primary source of income after
retirement. Now, thanks to this
government mismanagement,
Social Security faces ban
kruptcy. Social Security should
be abolished, and replaced by
government-mandated re
tirement accounts. That way,
people would be forced to save
for their old age, but could
manage their own assets. If this
had happened 40 years ago, we
wouldn't be in this mess today.

Proposition 13 was a righte
ous citizenry's reaction to gov
ernment taxation and spend
ing. California's surplus grew
and grew, and there was no
legislative groundswell in favor
of returning it to the taxpayers.
Though Prop. 13 attacked Sac
ramento indirectly through the
counties, the surplus is now
shrinking. Everyone knows
that that surplus was created by
government-caused inflation.
Government spends money
in the wrong directions and/or
with poor results. No one ac
cuses public schools of doing a
good job over the last 10-15
years, in spite of billions spent
and catchy new programs. San
Francisco has expensive street
sweepers and had parking
meter attendants who were
thieves.
Space does not permit
further exposure of Sartoris' fal
lacies. A clear lesson is to look
to government before blaming
any other entity for society's
problems.

David Sartoris' mushy
analysis in his column on
capitalism in the September
27 Daily is typical of trendy
anti-economic thought which
would cure the U.S. economy
of its success. Compared to
that column, oatmeal feels like
concrete. The theme of the
column seems to have been
that capitalism has caused
many problems, and that more
societal (a euphemism for gov
ernmental) control will some
how solve them.
First, Sartoris says "inflation,
unemployment, and lack of
public confidence in govern
ment" exist because the
capitalistic "ide?" . . has not
been met in recer,. years." The
government, and not
capitalism, is in fact to blame
for these ills, and for most of
the others Sartoris lays at the
feet of free enterprise.
Inflation is caused primarily
by the government spending
more than it receives. The
money supply is increased with
no corresponding increase in
the supply of goods. Ergo,
prices go up.
A significant reason for un
employment is the minimum
wage, a device by which the
government, instead of the
marketplace, decides what a
worker is worth. People barely
worth a lower minimum wage
are laid off (or not hired) when
the wage is raised. President
Carter himself admitted while
signing the latest minimum
wage boost that the bill would
increase unemployment. With
the stroke of a pen, he was fir
ing many of those earning

$2.65/ hour, and paying off his
debt to George Meany. In addi
tion, a higher minimum wage
increases labor costs with no
increase in productivity. This
feeds inflation.
Historically, the only cures
for unemployment have been
war or totalitarianism. Would
Sartoris prefer either of these
to capitalism's unemploy
ment?
For Sartoris to relate some
how lack of confidence in gov
ernment to capitalism's failings
is nonsensical. Government is
perceived as existing more for
its own benefit than the
people's. Will more govern
ment control of business
change this?
The BART strike and
threatened gas station shut
down are Sartoris' symptoms
of the fracturing of society
caused by capitalism. BART, a
public entity, has some of the
worst management conceiva
ble and a history of overpaid
employees and outlandish
promises never kept. BART's
dismal record is close to those
