## Daniel Mendelowitz 
### 
Daniel Mendelowitz is gentle, frail-looking, soft-spoken.
Born in 1905 in Linton, N.D., he suffered pneumonia two
years in succession, obliging him todrawand paint, instead
of playing outside. His family moved to California, where
the climate was less severe.
His high school art teacher, illustrator Ruth Garnett —
with whom he remains in contact — encouraged him to
pursue a career in art.
However, says Mendelowitz, "When I started to go to
college (Stanford) my mother said she didn't think I was
very practical and suggested more practical professions.
But my heart was set on being an artist. She agreed to let me
be an artist if I would prepare myself to teach in high
school, so that's what I did.
"Fortunately, I never had to use it because when I
graduated with my master's degree, there happened to be
an opening at San lose College. At the encouragement of
Prof. Clark, head of the Art Department at Stanford, I
applied for the teaching job at S.J. State College and got it. I
taught there for about five years, when I was invited to
come back to Stanford to teach, which is where I stayed
until I retired (in 1970)."
In addition to watercolor and drawing classes, Prof.
Mendelowitz taught a course on the history of painting and
was the first in the state to give a class on the history of film.
"I suddenly thought that students needed to be familiar
with the art experience that was most familiar to them."
Among his published worksareA History of American Art
(1960), Children Are Artists (1953), Drawing: A Study Guide
(1966) and Drawing (1967).
Although he has used other media, Mendelowitz prefers
watercolor. "Watercolor was practical, not messy to carrv
in the car. Oils were just too slow. With watercolor, you can
finish a painting in three to four hours."
Why representational art? "I've never been tempted to
do abstraction or to do anything but paint what I saw. This is
not meant to denigrate abstraction, but it's not for me."
