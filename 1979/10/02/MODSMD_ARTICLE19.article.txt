The University Art Gallery is
celebrating the 25th anniver
sary of the founding of the
Committee for Artby honoring
Daniel Mendelowitz, profes
sor emeritus and one of the
original members of the board
of the Committee for Art, in a
retrospective show.
The exhibition, organized by
Carol Osbourne, consists of 53
watercolors and one graphite
drawing, spanning the years
from 1929 through 1975 and

displaying virtually every non
abstract style in that period.
"Carmel River Beach" (1929)
is a work in which muted
browns create an infinity of
earth, hills and sky, reminis
cent of a Chinese landscape
painting.
"Victorian House in an Or
chard" (1932), in spite of a
brooding sky, is flooded with
light reflected off roof tiles,
pools of water and the foliage
of the trees. This, and a color

ful burst of flowers,"Aban
doned Garden"(l9sB), are de
cidedly impressionistic.
"New York Scene"(l94l) is
painted in Edward Hopper's
warm tones, and "Church, San
Francisco" (1945) displays
heavy expressionistic build
ings, influenced by Charles
Burchfield.
The five factory scenes, the
two most striking of which are
"Iron Works, Josua Henry,
Sunnyvale" (1943) and "Salt
Works Near Dumbarton
Bridge" (1937), are reminiscent
of Charles Sheeler and Charles
Demuth, and are perhaps
some of his best work.
"The Cherry Tree" (1957) is
done in the romantic style, re
plete with brooding colors and
windswept branches.
"Forest Avenue" (1953) re
calls Norman Rockwell in sub
ject matter and Andrew Wyeth
in style.
Mendelowitz even pays his
respects to Matisse in his ex
quisite "Nude," and to Boudin
in his "Oregon Beach Scene"
(1947).

Other notables are "Barges
on the Seine" (1938), "San
Gregorio" (1974), and a striking
"Winter Sky" done in pencil
and rubbed graphite.
None of these styles has
been consciously adopted, al
though Mendelowitz admits to
being influenced by Hopper,
Burchfield and Turner. He says
he doesn't intellectualize
when he paints but instead re
lies on his intuition as to what
would make a good picture.
The style evolves naturally and
subconsciously from the mate
rial he is painting.
Mendelowitz cannot be dis
tinguished fora unique oreven
personal style. However he is a
master of his craft, and his art is
notable for its beauty.
