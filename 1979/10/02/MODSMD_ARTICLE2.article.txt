# Opponents protest city, county ordinances
## Gay measures face possible repeal 
### Nina Van Hoven 
Less than two months after their passage, gay rights
ordinances approved in Santa Clara County and the City
of San Jose face possible repeal by opponents on the
Peninsula.
San Jose city officials received 27,000 unvalidated sig
natures on a referendum petition Wednesday, while the
county office has validated enough signatures request
ing appeal to prompt action by the Board of Supervisors.
Both the county and the city ordinances prohibit dis
crimination on the basis of sexual preference in hous
ing, education, social services or employment.
Opponents of the ordinances, described by city and
county officials as primarily "fundamentalist church
groups," object to the government's interference in
what they call a "social matter."
"The government cannot legislate away discrimina
tion, and it shouldn't try . . . the employer or the land
lord has the right to discriminate," claimed a member of
the Concerned Citizens Against the Sexual Orientation
Ordinance.
That concerned citizen also described those
homosexuals working for the ordinance as "the ones
who want to be able to flaunt their behavior, to talk to
children about it."
The Santa Clara ordinance was originally drafted by
the Human Relations Commission (HRC) in San Jose.
According to Fred St. Clair, assistant management
analyst at the HRC, the ordinance is strictly a matter of
"human rights, equal rights."
"A person should be evaluated solely on the pertinent
information (qualifications for a job, the ability to pay for
a house), not his or her sexual orientation," he said.
Any reports that the ordinance prescribes affirmative
action for homosexuals are, he claims, "total distortion
. . . (there is) no affirmative action in any way, shape, or
form . . . the landlord is not obligated to give the house
to the homosexual."
At Stanford, the Cay People's Union (CPU) is strongly
behind both the county and the city ordinances, accord
ing to CPU treasurer RhioHiersch. Emphasized Hiersch,
"The people working for this ordinance are only fighting
for their own basic civil rights; they seek nothing more
complicated than the right to a job, housing and social
services."
He classified the campaign against the ordinance as an
"hysterical move on the part of ignorant, reactionary,
right-wing people . . . who don't understand what

they're fighting; and because they don't understand it,
they are afraid of it."
Furor over the ordinance has also spiiled into the
ecclesiastical world. The Arch-Diocese, the Council of
Churches, the Interfaith Ministry and the Bishop of the
Baptist Church in San Jose have formally declared their
support for the ordinance.
A splinter organization, the National Evangelical As
sociation, was formed specifically for the purpose of
expressing disapproval of the ordinance.
In order to prevent an ordinance from becoming law,
a referendum petition must be presented to the approp
riate governing body within 30 days after adoption. The
Santa Clara ordinance, affecting all unincorporated
areas of the county, was passed by the Board of Super
visors Aug. 7 by a 4-1 vote. The San Jose City council
approved the city-wide ordinance Aug. 28 by a 6-1 vote.
To dispel a Santa Clara County law, petitions contain
ing signatures totaling at least 10 percent of the number
of voters registered for the last gubernatorial election
must be verified. A San Jose measure may be overturned
by the authentication of signatures amounting to 8 per
cent of registered voters from the previous municipal
election.
Forty-nine thousand validated signatures, more than
12,000 above the necessary figure, prevented the county
ordinance from becoming law. Only 18,234 must be
sanctioned in San Jose to delay implementation of the
ordinance. City officials said they believe they will re
ceive enough signatures to mandate action.
In the event of a validated referendum petition, both
the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors and the San
Jose City Council have three options: to overturn the
ordinance by a vote of the legislative body, to call a
special election or to bring the matter before the electo
rate in the next general election (in June).
Both offices will decide which procedure to follow
within the next few weeks. County and city officials
predict that the Board of Supervisors and the City Coun
cil will choose to present the issue to the public in June.
No formal move has yet been made in Palo Alto to
initiate a gay rights ordinance. Don Way, vice-chairman
of the Palo Alto HRC, said yesterday that in terms of an
ordinance, the commission is "considering, in a pre
liminary sense, discrimination in the areas of housing
and employment,' but "it is unlikely that we should
suggest that the Palo Alto City Council jump in and pass
an ordinance when there are repeal moves going on so
close to us."
