# Paul Klee: Lines leading to worlds of fantasy
## 
### 
Paul Klee was one of the
most personal, satiric, fantastic
artists of the 20th century. A
musician, poet and theoreti
cian, he was a romantic who
drew from nature, and a mystic
who endeavored to reveal the
reality that is behind visible
things, striving to emphasize
the essential character of the
accidental.
Klee left more than 9000
works of which 109 were
prints. About half of these —
drawn from the private collec
tion of Chemistry Prof. Carl
Djerassi, the Art Institute of
Chicago, New York's Museum
of Modern Art, and the Robert
("■ore Rifkind Collet tion in Be
verly Hills — have been or
ganized into an exhibit at the
University Museum by Betsy
Fryberger, curator of prints
and drawings, as a celebration
of Klee's birth.
Although the proportion of
Klee's etchings and lithographs
to his other works is quite
small, they nonetheless form
an important and (in the
whole, representative part of
his art.
The exhibit has been divided
into four periods: Berne
(1903-1905), Munich (1906-
1920), the Bauhaus (1921-1931)
and After Weimar.
Fryberger has written an in
troduction to each of the
periods and whenever possi
ble has placed Klee's cont
inents under the works they
describe.
Klee was born in Muchen
buchsee (near Bern) in 1879, of
a German musician father and

a mother who had studied to
be a music teacher. It was his
maternal grandmother, how
ever, who introduced Klee to
drawing and painting.
After an initial inclination
tcjward music, Klee went in
1898 to Munich to study art
under Franz von Stuck. There
he saw works by Blake, Goya
and Elisor in the print room of
the Pinakothek, and was ex
posed to the lugendstil (Ger
man art nouveau) movement,
and,impressionist and, post
impressionist exhibitions.
In 1%1 he traveled to Italy,
where he admired works by
Michelangelo and Donatello
and was startled by an exhibi
tion of Rodin's drawings of
nudes, which he described as
"caricatures of nudes." After
his return he did a series of 15
etchings, which he called his
"inventions."
Fhese darkly satiric works,
with their grotesque figures —
eight of which are shown here
— are an employment of and a
reaction to the classical art he
saw in Italy, influenced by
Goya's "Los Proverbios."
He wrote in his diary: "I have
now reached the point where I
can look over the great art of
antiquity and its Renaissance.
But, for myself, I cannot find
any artistic connection with
our own times. And to want to
create something outside of
one's own age strikes me as
suspect. Great perplexity. This
is why I am on the side of sa
tire."
Klee's ' Inventions" not only
were his first major work, but

the first in which titles would
play an integral part in his art,
expressing his philosophy,
humor and above all, irony:
"Virgin in a Tree," "Two Men
Presuming Each Other of
Higher Rank," "The Come
dian," "Charm," "Aged
Phoenix," and "Hero With
One Wing."
In the Munich period, Klee
met the Blau Reiter painters
Kandinsky, lawlensky, Marc,
Macke, Kubiri and Campen
donc, participated in their
exhibits and, for the periodical
Der Sturm, translated an essay
by Delauny, to whom he refer

red as one of the most brilliant
contemporary artists.
Prints such as "Grotesque
Tragedy" show his experimen
tation with automatic drawing.
"Garden of Passion," "Reflec
tions in a Window," "Death of
an Idea," and in particular,
"Destruction and Hope," re
veal the influence of Delauny's
cubic orphism.
After the war, in which Klee
served from 1916 to 1918, his
direct observations were
abandoned in favor of increas
ingly theoretical and spiritual
concepts. In 1919 he wrote his
"Creative Credo," an essay on

the graphic arts.
He declared: "Art does not
reproduce the visible; rather,
it makes visible. . . . Formerly
we used to represent things
visible on earth, things we
either liked to look at or would
have liked to see. Today we re
veal the reality that is behind
visible things, thus expressing
the belief that. . . there are
many other latent realities."
For Klee, art was "a simile of
the Creation," and he tried to
create a formal cosmos from
abstract elements, unifying
forms, movement and
counter-movement, and

balancing contrasts of divided
color.
In his figures, childlike and
simply defined, Klee endea
vored to probe beneath the
surface to the heart. His pur
pose was not to reflect the sur
face, which could be done with
a photographic plate, but to
penetrate. "I write words on
the forehead and the corners
of the mouth. My human faces
are truer than the real ones."
In 1921 Klee was invited to
join the faculty of the Bauhaus
at Weimar, an institution
formed by Walter Gropius in
1919 upon the premise that art
and craft are mutually interde
pendent. He remained for 10
years, working with fellow in
structors Kandinsky and
Feininger.
It was during this period that
he synthesized abstract and
representational approaches
in his personal and satiric fan
tasies. A number of motifs
recur in these works: satire of
human nature in "Buffoonery"
and "Witch With a Comb"; his
loveof the theaterand music in
"The Singer of Operetta,"
which Klee also did in oil,
"Tightrope Walker," "Juggler
in April," and "Prickle the
Clown", and his orchestration
of color in "In the Spirit of
Hoffman," "Lantern Party at
the Bauhaus," and"The
Cheerful Side."
After he left the Bauhaus,
Klee made few etchings and no
more lithographs, a medium
he disliked because he didn't
feel adept at it.

His subject matter became
more thoughtful, his images
often simpler: "Old Man Re
ckoning" and "Why Run?", the
latter composed of a human fi
gure drawn with only three
lines and a dog, defined in one.
One of the finest works of
the exhibit is "L'homme Ap
proximatif," notable for its
color, delicacy of shading and
deceptive simplicity of form.
As an adjunct to this exhibit,
Fryberger has a very fine dis
play of graphics by Klee's con
temporaries and older artists
who influenced his work,
among which are two etchings
from "Los Proverbios" by
Goya, three Ensor etchings, a
gentle bovine "Pregnant Wo
man" by Kathe Kollwitz, a self
portrait by Lovis Corinth, the
woodcut "Bei der Toilette" by
Max Beckman, three lithos by
Miro, a black and gray etching
and aquatint, "Steamer," by
Emil Nolde arid works by
Pisarro, Kandinsky, Alfred Ku
bin, Alexander Archipenko,
Ludwig Meidner, Ernst Kir
chner, Max Klinger, Aubrey
Beardsley and Oskar
Kokoschka.
It could be argued that Klee
was too ambitious in his en
deavors, that what he wrote of
his earliest work, "My etchings
suffer from the fault of all
youthful works, namely that
they attempt too much," holds
true for most, if not all, of his
work. The same could not be
said, however, for Mrs.
Fryberger's exhibit;it is man
ageable and quite satisfying.
