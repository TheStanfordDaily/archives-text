# The 						boys from Jersey let loose
## 
### 
Last Friday night in Memorial
Auditorium, Southside Johnny
and the Asbury Jukes battled a
less-than-great sound system
and won decisively.
The Jukes' brand of rockin'
rhythm and blues really
doesn't come off as well using
the kind cf volume that was
employed Friday. This 11-man
band plays so well that you
want to be able to pick out each
member clearly. The volume
created distortions and almost
eliminated the treble tones,
giving the band an incongru
ous bass sound. This particu
larly hindered the work of voc
alist "Southside" Johnny Lyon.
But the jukes displayed so
much energy and, particularly
when band members soloed,
played so well that the difficul

ties with the sound grew less
important.
After a largely nostalgic short
set of mid '60s rock (Byrds,
Animal?, Beatles, Rolling
Stones) from the veteran Fla
min' Croovies, the Jukes took
the stage and roared through a
searing two-hour set of jump
ing party music.
Prime cuts
The concert was largely de
signed to feature the recently
released The Jukes, the band's
fourth record, and their debut
with Mercury Records. They
played eight songs from the al
bum, which was made without
help from two of the band's
most famous early col
laborators, Bruce Springsteen
and E Streeter "Miami" Steve
Van Zandt.

The Jukes were a little woozy
at the beginning; the first two
numbers, "All I Want Is Every
thing" and "Your Reply," both
pounding rockers, were done
too loosely, and Lyon's vocals
weren't powerful enough.
By the fifth or sixth number,
however, the band had com
pletely righted itself. Lyon's
vocals on "Paris," a new ballad
from Jukes, was superb, and
lead guitarist Billy Rush really
began to assert himself with a
soaring solo on "Take It In
side," the next song.
Rush was a revelation
throughout the show. The
jukes' music has evolved from
simpler, more bluesy ar
rangements into a denser,
more guitar-oriented harder
rock sound, which makes
Rush's role even more crucial.
Rush has replaced Van Zandt as
the Jukes' lead guitarist, and
he's no disappointment; Rush
supplies a cool, steady stage
presence that complements
Southside's endless move
ment.
Dueling strings
Rush even contributed a lead
vocal on the new song "Sec
urity," which also featured
solid guitar sparring between

Rush and the newest Juke,
guitarist Joel Gramolini, who
was introduced as being 13 but
actually is 21.
The veterans in the Jukes,
namely the horn section, were
brilliant throughout. Richie "La
Bamba" Rosenberg on trom
bone never stopped all night,
shaking his huge body per
fectly in time with the music.
The Jukes' horn section is tight
and powerful; on "Vertigo," a
new song inspired by the 1957
Hitchcock thriller, the five
member section sounded as
full as a marching band. Stan
Harrison on tenor sax, Bob
Muckin on trumpet and Ed
Manion on baritone sax all
added tight, full solos.
The entire band got a chance
to shine in the concert's clos
ing songs. "I Choose to Sing
the Blues" featured a Paul
Butterfield-like harmonica
lead-in from Lyon, and, on
Springsteen's "The Fever,"
keyboardist Kevin Kavanaugh
joined with guitarists Rush and
Gramolini to give the lengthy
intro a soft, Ray Charles feel.
It was singalong time by the
end of the regular set; "We're
Havin' a Party," the set's last
song, was completely approp

riate. The near-capacity audi
ence, which had stood for
much of the time, tried gamely
to dance as best it could amid
Mem Aud's rows of seats.
More, more
The inevitable encores fol
lowed. All were written by Van
Zandt, including "This Time
Baby's Gone for Good" and
"Gotta Be a Better Way Home"
from Hearts of Stone, the
Jukes' third album, and "This
Time It's for Real," the title
song from the band's second
LP. One of the best songs from
Stone, "Baby's Gone For
Good," was definitely the high
light here. A perfect fusion of
rock with traditional rhythm
and blues, the song was done
with such conviction that you
still feel the hurt that it de
scribed.
The Jukes' appearance here
was long overdue. The band's
natural following is on the East
Coast, and the band has yet to
attract a large audience in this
part of the country. Perhaps
Friday's superb show will help
spread the word that this band
of rock and roll animals is one
to be reckoned with — with or
without Bruce Springsteen.

searing two-hour set of jump
ing party music.
Prime cuts
The concert was largely de
signed to feature the recently
released The Jukes, the band's
fourth record, and their debut
with Mercury Records. They
played eight songs from the al
bum, which was made without
help from two of the band's
most famous early col
laborators, Bruce Springsteen
and E Streeter "Miami" Steve
Van Zandt.

The Jukes were a little woozy
at the beginning; the first two
numbers, "All I Want Is Every
thing" and "Your Reply," both
pounding rockers, were done
too loosely, and Lyon's vocals
weren't powerful enough.
By the fifth or sixth number,
however, the band had com
pletely righted itself. Lyon's
vocals on "Paris," a new ballad
from Jukes, was superb, and
lead guitarist Billy Rush really
began to assert himself with a
soaring solo on "Take It In
side," the next song.
Rush was a revelation
throughout the show. The
jukes' music has evolved from
simpler, more bluesy ar
rangements into a denser,
more guitar-oriented harder
rock sound, which makes
Rush's role even more crucial.
Rush has replaced Van Zandt as
the Jukes' lead guitarist, and
he's no disappointment; Rush
supplies a cool, steady stage
presence that complements
Southside's endless move
ment.
Dueling strings
Rush even contributed a lead
vocal on the new song "Sec
urity," which also featured
solid guitar sparring between

Rush and the newest Juke,
guitarist Joel Gramolini, who
was introduced as being 13 but
actually is 21.
The veterans in the Jukes,
namely the horn section, were
brilliant throughout. Richie "La
Bamba" Rosenberg on trom
bone never stopped all night,
shaking his huge body per
fectly in time with the music.
The Jukes' horn section is tight
and powerful; on "Vertigo," a
new song inspired by the 1957
Hitchcock thriller, the five
member section sounded as
full as a marching band. Stan
Harrison on tenor sax, Bob
Muckin on trumpet and Ed
Manion on baritone sax all
added tight, full solos.
The entire band got a chance
to shine in the concert's clos
ing songs. "I Choose to Sing
the Blues" featured a Paul
Butterfield-like harmonica
lead-in from Lyon, and, on
Springsteen's "The Fever,"
keyboardist Kevin Kavanaugh
joined with guitarists Rush and
Gramolini to give the lengthy
intro a soft, Ray Charles feel.
It was singalong time by the
end of the regular set; "We're
Havin' a Party," the set's last
song, was completely approp

riate. The near-capacity audi
ence, which had stood for
much of the time, tried gamely
to dance as best it could amid
Mem Aud's rows of seats.
More, more
The inevitable encores fol
lowed. All were written by Van
Zandt, including "This Time
Baby's Gone for Good" and
"Gotta Be a Better Way Home"
from Hearts of Stone, the
Jukes' third album, and "This
Time It's for Real," the title
song from the band's second
LP. One of the best songs from
Stone, "Baby's Gone For
Good," was definitely the high
light here. A perfect fusion of
rock with traditional rhythm
and blues, the song was done
with such conviction that you
still feel the hurt that it de
scribed.
The Jukes' appearance here
was long overdue. The band's
natural following is on the East
Coast, and the band has yet to
attract a large audience in this
part of the country. Perhaps
Friday's superb show will help
spread the word that this band
of rock and roll animals is one
to be reckoned with — with or
without Bruce Springsteen.

Southside Johnny
Last Friday night in Memorial
Auditorium, Southside Johnny
and the Asbury Jukes battled a
less-than-great sound system
and won decisively.
The Jukes' brand of rockin'
rhythm and blues really
doesn't come off as well using
the kind cf volume that was
employed Friday. This 11-man
band plays so well that you
want to be able to pick out each
member clearly. The volume
created distortions and almost
eliminated the treble tones,
giving the band an incongru
ous bass sound. This particu
larly hindered the work of voc
alist "Southside" Johnny Lyon.
But the jukes displayed so
much energy and, particularly
when band members soloed,
played so well that the difficul

ties with the sound grew less
important.
After a largely nostalgic short
set of mid '60s rock (Byrds,
Animal?, Beatles, Rolling
Stones) from the veteran Fla
min' Croovies, the Jukes took
the stage and roared through a
searing two-hour set of jump
ing party music.
