# Bread & Roses set
## 
### 
As we go marching
In the beauty of the day
A million darkened kitchens,
A thousand mill lofts gray
Are touched with all the radiance
That a sudden sun discloses
For the people hear us singing
Bread and roses, bread and roses.

In the short space of two years, the autumn Bread and Roses
concert has become a Bay Area tradition. Musicians present
acoustic sets in UC-Berkeley's Greek Theatre to raise money for
Bread and Roses, a benefit agency that presents concerts at men
tal hospitals, prisons and convalescent homes.
This year's ottering of grain and flowers includes David Crosby
and Kris Kristofferson Friday night at 7; Pete Seegerand loan Baez
Saturday at 1 p.m.; Peter, Paul & Mary, The Persuasions and
Graham Nash Sunday at 1 p.m.; plus many more.
A sign language interpreter will be provided on Saturday.
Concert announcements promise special guests and, in previ
ous years, organizers have used that to good effect. During
shows, they would announce that an unexpected performer had
arrived and would go onstage shortly.
Rumors began flying. "It has to be Dylan," many whispered.
And sure enough, out came a singer, wheezing and carrying on in
the familiar nasal tone. Closer examination, however, revealed
that it was only Joan Baez in her inimic able imitation of Dylan.
Proceeds from the series will support the singers and enter
tainers, who perform throughout the year for Bread and Roses.
