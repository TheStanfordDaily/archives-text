# 'Northern Lights' and 'Tree of the Wooden Clogs'
## 
### 
A question about today's
films: Can Francis Coppola
produce as good a movie with
$50 million as a small San
Francisco-based art cinema
group can on a shoestring?
No, this is not about
Apocalypse Now. It's about
Northern Lights, a film about
people refreshingly different
from the average Stanford stu
dent — the small farmers of
North Dakota who broke the
grip of the financial octopus
that was strangling their land,
their crops and their liveli
hoods.
Little is said outside North
Dakota about the Non-Partisan
League, which won office
there in 1916 and held power
for six tumultuous years. It set
up publicly owned banks, mills
and elevators to free the far
mers from the tentacles of
robber barons. Women's suf
frage was granted and workers'
compensation laws were pas
sed.
Fluidly
Appropriately, the directors
used mainly non-professional
actors in what essentially is a
tribute to the common person.

The cast performs fluidly, like
real people, not people playing
parts.
The film, shot in black and
white on location in Crosby,
North Dakota, seems more
notable for its form than its
content. A grainy, earthy
looking creation, its strategi
cally placed still shots give the
feeling that the film is really an
illustration of the diary it uses
as a framing device.
And the movie is close to real
life in other ways. No mushy
ending or pink-ribbon
foreshadowing of the charac
ters' lives. Instead, the same
sort of uncertainty we live with
from day to day.
The same limbo surrounds
the producers, who went
deeply in debt to make and dis
tribute Northern Lights. They
are marketing it off-Hollywood
to keep the freedom they had
in making the movie, but now
they must stage a heavy public
ity campaign, centering on the
film's opening last week at the
Surf Theater in San Francisco
and its imminent debuts in
Boston and Washington.
Fight still on
After its premiere in Crosby,

the film won the Best First Fea
ture Film Award at Cannes this
year. But the producers still
had to wage the same sort of
fight with the movie moguls
that the Non-Partisan League
fought against the capitalists of
North Dakota.
It's a touching film, all right.
Don't be afraid to let your
throat constrict at the mishaps
and problems that befall the
league and at the struggles
people go through to survive
— an eye-opening reminder
that not everybody is worried
sick over his next midterm.
There are people for whom a
far more weighty concern is
where their next meal is com
ing from or whether a villain
ous, conniving banker will re
possess their hard-earned
homestead.
'Wooden Clogs'
The Tree of the Wooden
Clogs is an Italian venture into
a similar subject — once again
with non-professional actors,
but with a little more veneer
and a little less of the brash
straightforwardness of North
ern Lights. It examines in,bril
liant Technicolor the ambience

of a small village in the Italian
countryside. But it's more of a
tableau than a movie, really.
There is no compelling flow to
it. It just drifts lazily down a
canal through the farmland,
past landmarks and major
events — a boy going to school
for the tirst time, a family being
evicted, a county fair.
Guided fantasy
In fact, the spotty translation
in the subtitles doesn't matter
that much — the feeling of pre
sence is what counts. Let your
self go on a guided fantasy to
see how another half lives. And
you might even want to think
about your own lifestyle.
This movie doesn't really
make a point forcefully. It
doesn't even present anything
vaguely resembling a moral. To
find whatever it is the film says
to you, you have to bite into it,
wrestle with the slew of early
20th-century Italy the director
serves up, gnaw at the bones
and extract the marrow.
Like any competent, well
conceived art, the meaning of
Tree will depend a lot on what
you are, how you were brought
up, and what you had for din
ner that night. Undoubtedly,

people who come from Pacific
Heights or Pacific Palisades,
Beverly Hills or Hillsboro will
read different things into this
movie than the two Stanford
students who come from rural
Appalachia or anybody from
East Palo Alto who can afford
the admission.
Whatever your ethnic
background or socio
economic status, you may find
this film, like Northern Lights,
doesn't move as fast as Airport
'79 or Alien. Swift-moving plots
are often a luxury that come
with pablum. Take your pick.
So if you want to get what
you can from these films, it will
take a bit of effort on your part.
Think about what the movies
are saying; consider the impli
cations. Don't be a passive ob
server like you would if you
were watching TV — movies
like this put TV to shame, make
it despicable, insignificant.
These are more plays than
movies. These really aren't films
lor nie whole family, but are
adult films.
Not that they are pornog
raphic, but because of the
depth of meaning they hold.

A question about today's
films: Can Francis Coppola
produce as good a movie with
$50 million as a small San
Francisco-based art cinema
group can on a shoestring?
No, this is not about
Apocalypse Now. It's about
Northern Lights, a film about
people refreshingly different
from the average Stanford stu
dent — the small farmers of
North Dakota who broke the
grip of the financial octopus
that was strangling their land,
their crops and their liveli
hoods.
Little is said outside North
Dakota about the Non-Partisan
League, which won office
there in 1916 and held power
for six tumultuous years. It set
up publicly owned banks, mills
and elevators to free the far
mers from the tentacles of
robber barons. Women's suf
frage was granted and workers'
compensation laws were pas
sed.
Fluidly
Appropriately, the directors
used mainly non-professional
actors in what essentially is a
tribute to the common person.

The cast performs fluidly, like
real people, not people playing
parts.
The film, shot in black and
white on location in Crosby,
North Dakota, seems more
notable for its form than its
content. A grainy, earthy
looking creation, its strategi
cally placed still shots give the
feeling that the film is really an
illustration of the diary it uses
as a framing device.
And the movie is close to real
life in other ways. No mushy
ending or pink-ribbon
foreshadowing of the charac
ters' lives. Instead, the same
sort of uncertainty we live with
from day to day.
The same limbo surrounds
the producers, who went
deeply in debt to make and dis
tribute Northern Lights. They
are marketing it off-Hollywood
to keep the freedom they had
in making the movie, but now
they must stage a heavy public
ity campaign, centering on the
film's opening last week at the
Surf Theater in San Francisco
and its imminent debuts in
Boston and Washington.
Fight still on
After its premiere in Crosby,

the film won the Best First Fea
ture Film Award at Cannes this
year. But the producers still
had to wage the same sort of
fight with the movie moguls
that the Non-Partisan League
fought against the capitalists of
North Dakota.
It's a touching film, all right.
Don't be afraid to let your
throat constrict at the mishaps
and problems that befall the
league and at the struggles
people go through to survive
— an eye-opening reminder
that not everybody is worried
sick over his next midterm.
There are people for whom a
far more weighty concern is
where their next meal is com
ing from or whether a villain
ous, conniving banker will re
possess their hard-earned
homestead.
'Wooden Clogs'
The Tree of the Wooden
Clogs is an Italian venture into
a similar subject — once again
with non-professional actors,
but with a little more veneer
and a little less of the brash
straightforwardness of North
ern Lights. It examines in,bril
liant Technicolor the ambience

of a small village in the Italian
countryside. But it's more of a
tableau than a movie, really.
There is no compelling flow to
it. It just drifts lazily down a
canal through the farmland,
past landmarks and major
events — a boy going to school
for the tirst time, a family being
evicted, a county fair.
Guided fantasy
In fact, the spotty translation
in the subtitles doesn't matter
that much — the feeling of pre
sence is what counts. Let your
self go on a guided fantasy to
see how another half lives. And
you might even want to think
about your own lifestyle.
This movie doesn't really
make a point forcefully. It
doesn't even present anything
vaguely resembling a moral. To
find whatever it is the film says
to you, you have to bite into it,
wrestle with the slew of early
20th-century Italy the director
serves up, gnaw at the bones
and extract the marrow.
Like any competent, well
conceived art, the meaning of
Tree will depend a lot on what
you are, how you were brought
up, and what you had for din
ner that night. Undoubtedly,

people who come from Pacific
Heights or Pacific Palisades,
Beverly Hills or Hillsboro will
read different things into this
movie than the two Stanford
students who come from rural
Appalachia or anybody from
East Palo Alto who can afford
the admission.
Whatever your ethnic
background or socio
economic status, you may find
this film, like Northern Lights,
doesn't move as fast as Airport
'79 or Alien. Swift-moving plots
are often a luxury that come
with pablum. Take your pick.
So if you want to get what
you can from these films, it will
take a bit of effort on your part.
Think about what the movies

cations. Don't be a passive ob
server like you would if you
