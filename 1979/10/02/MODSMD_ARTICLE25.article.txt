Pope greets throng in Boston
Boston — Pope John Paul II opened a pas
toral visit to his divided American flock yester
day, raising a shepherd's crozier to bless a
drenched but ecstatic Boston. He had words of
praise and friendship but warnings, too, for
this rich and troubled nation.
"I greet you America the Beautiful," the
pope told a cheering throng in Boston Com
mon in the first major address of his six-city
tour of the United States. "I want to tell
everyone that the pope is your friend."
He hailed America as a free and generous
land, but said its youth was being lured from
religion to the empty "escape" of sexual plea
sure, drugs, violence and indifference.
"I propose to you the option of love, which
is the opposite of escape," the pontiff said
amid a downpour that had turned the historic
Common into a sea of mud.
As many as 400,000 people crowded the
park, waving flags, banners, handkerchiefs
and whatever else was available as the pope,
dressed in white and gold, raised his arms in
blessing.
The crowds had stood under umbrellas,
singing while they waited for the pontiff, who
landed at Boston's Logan Airport in mid
afternoon. His motorcade from the airport ran
about 40 minutes late, but when he finally ap
proached along Beacon Street, standing in an
open car, his arms outstretched, the throng
broke into shouts and cheers.
Gold prices up, dollar drops
The price of gold surged to a record $414.50
an ounce in Europe yesterday as the U.S. dollar
declined and was kept from dropping below
last year's lows only by massive central-bank
intervention.
It was the first time ever gold closed above
$400 in Europe, although the level was touched
Friday before prices slipped.
There were reports of continued gold buy
ing by Arabs and of efforts to sell dollars after a
meeting between West German and American
officials in Hamburg produced vague prom
ises, but no specific steps, to defend the dol
lar.
Cold, which closed above $300 an ounce for
the first time July 18, has climbed steadily in
recent weeks. The dollar, after initially show
ing strength, has now dropped to its lowest
level against the West German mark, Swiss
franc and Italian lira since the United States

mounted a massive dollar-rescue effort Nov. 1,
1978.
Gold, which traded at $35 an ounce a decade
ago, hit $200 in July 1978 and then took a year to
climb another $100 and less than three months
to hit $400.
A trader at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd. of
London said Arabs and other major investors
were unloading shaky dollars to buy gold.
"What else can they do with their dollars?" he
asked.
One German dealer said the dollar's basic
problem is the widespread belief that Presi
dent Carter is unable to solve America's
economic ills.
Bills will reduce income tax
Sacramento — Bills giving state income tax
payers a $500 million tax cut over two years and
abolishing the business inventory tax have
been signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown, the
governor's office announced today.
The income tax measure fully ties state in
come tax brackets to inflation for the next two
years, meaning that a cost-of-living pay raise
will not force a worker into a higher tax
bracker.
According to the legislative analyst's office,
that will save California taxpayers $210 million
the next fiscal year.
The state partially "indexed" the income tax
system last year by raising brackets for any
inflation above 3 percent.
A last-minute amendment repealing full in
dexing after two years, unless the Legislature
renews it, was added after Brown warned that
permanent indexing could force a tax increase.
The business inventory measure, A 866 by
Assemblyman Bill Lockyer (D-San Leandro),
wipes out the property tax on business inven
tory but makes up the difference by raising
other business levies.
Critics had complai ned that the tax was cost
ing California jobs by encouraging develop
ment of a significant warehousing industry in
neighboring states.
Brown said that 325,000 businesses were
subject to. the tax, 80 percent of which had
gross incomes of under $1 million a year.
Justices will hear labor case
Washington — The Supreme Court said yes
terday it will decide whether workers have a
right to refuse work they feel is too hazardous
without fear of employer's retaliation.

Beginning its 1979-80 term with a storm of
activity, the nation's highest court returned
from a three-month recess to issue orders in
more than 800 legal controversies.
In addition to agreeing to resolve the worker
safety case, the justices took these actions:
— Agreed to decide in a New York case
whether states may prohibit public utilities
from using inserts in customers' bills to discuss
"controversial matters of public policy."
— Left intact the convictions of Symbionese
Liberation Army members Emily and William
Harris for their role in a bizarre 1974 crime
spree that began outside an Inglewood, Calif.,
sports shop. Now imprisoned, the Harrises
also are serving time for the 1974 kidnapping of
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.
— Agreed to decide whether federal agents
stationed in airports may stop, question and
search persons who show "characteristics" of
drug couriers. The fate of the government's
surveillance program at 20 metropolitan air
ports nation-wide is at stake. A federal appeals
court ruled that tactics used in the program
violate individuals' privacy rights.
— Told Nevada authorities they are free to
set a new execution date for confessed mur
derer Jesse Bishop, a man who says he's ready
to die for his crime. Two Nevada public defen
ders, working without Bishop's consent, had
attempted to obtain Supreme Court review of
his death sentence.
— Refused to hear the appeal of two Col
orado men denied driver licenses because
their religious belief prohibits them from
being photographed.
— Left intact decisions giving members of
the clergy no more of a constitutional right
than news reporters to withhold confidential
information from inquiring grand juries.
Board declares Diablo 'safe'
Walnut Creek — The Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board, in a partial decision issued
yesterday, concluded that the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant could safely withstand an
earthquake of 7.5 magnitude, a spokesman for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
said.
In addition to seismology, the initial 94-page
decision issued in Washington, D.C., also ad
dressed a security plan for the plant and the
potential foraircraft and missile accidents, said
NRC spokesman Jim Hanchett.
"The decision is not conclusive because it's
only partial," said Hanchett. "There was an

earlier partial decision in June 1978 that ad
dressed environmental issues. Other issues,
particularly those involving references to
Three Mile Island, have been deferred until
later."
The board also decided that a security plan
for the plant, owned and operated by Pacific
Gas and Electric (PG&E), was acceptable to in
sure the safety of the facility.
"Based on the evidence presented, the
board finds that the PG&E security plan com
plies with all applicable NRC regulations," the
decision says. "Because of the sensitive nature
of this evidence, it will not be further reviewed
in this partial initial decision."
Finally, the board said it found that a
"reasonable probability" of an aircraft acci
dent occurring at the plant to be approximately
1 in 180 billion.
Coast Guard watches oil slick
Santa Barbara — A 15-mile-long oil slick was
discovered yesterday 20 miles south of San
Miguel Island, Coast Guard spokesman Garth
Groff said.
"The Coast Guard has a helicopter surveying
the area with a pollution investigator aboard,"
Groff said. "The slick is generally running in an
east-west direction and it isn't known how
wide it is."
The slick, discovered at 9:46 a.m. by a Navy
pilot based at Point Mugu, is located about 50
miles southwest of Santa Barbara. It was not
immediately known if the slick would reach
shore.
San Miguel Island is the westernmost major
island in the Channel Islands chain.
