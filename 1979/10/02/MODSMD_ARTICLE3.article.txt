# History Corner reconstructed
## 
### David Frank 
Students that failed to catch the
King Tut exhibit in San Francisco this
past summer should not be dis
mayed.
A glance at the History Corner of
the Quad, as two years of renovation
draw to a close, will sate the artistic
curiosity of many.
The $7 million refurbishing of the
History Corner, also known as Build
ing 200, preserves the beauty of the
Quad's 19th Century architecture
while providing a safer structure for
students and faculty, according to
the project director.
The new building houses 69 offices
in addition to 12 classrooms and six
seminar rooms.
Safety was the primary reason for
renovating the History Corner, ac
cording to Bob Narrie, project direc
tor. Since construction began in Au
gust, 1977, "the building has been
completely reconstructed and
brought up to present building
codes of Santa Clara County," Narrie
said.
All walls and floors of the building
have been "earthquake-proofed" by
steel-reinforced concrete, according
to Narrie. He also mentioned that
steel beams were used in construc
tion of the building's roof.
The use of the steel, however,
necessitated the strengthening of

the stone supports of the old build
ing. According to Narrie, steel sup
port columns were added too, but
did not replace, the antiquated stone
columns. Concrete was then affixed
to the steel columns to match them
with the original masonry.
A similar procedure was used to
strengthen the columns of the free
standing arcades of the building.
The History building now boasts
new fire safety equipment: including
a new sprinkler system, smoke de
tectors and more fire exits.
The safety improvements, though
vitally important, are not apparent to
the casual observer of the History
Corner. A passerby will likely re
member the massive half-circU
arches and red mission-tile roofing
instead.
"Aside from the major structural
work, the visual integrity of the ar
chitecture of the Quad has been pre
served," Narrie said.
A similar effort to maintain the
Quad's 19th Century Romanesque
style of architecture — the product of
Quad architect Charles Allerton
Coolidge — has also been seen in
recent months with the completed
overhaul of Building 40, Margaret
Jacks Hall, which houses the Compu
ter Science department and Boys
Town Center.

The reconstruction of Building 120
is scheduled to begin in late
November.
That reconstruction, Narrie re
lated, marks an end to several years
of mutli-million dollar building reno
vations.
History Department faculty and
staff are scheduled to move back into
their headquarters Oct. 24, Narrie
said.
