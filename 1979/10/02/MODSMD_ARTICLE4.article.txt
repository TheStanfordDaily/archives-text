# Medical Center releases some radioactive waste

The nearest location to campus for
dumping radioactive wastes is the
Hanford nuclear disposal site in
Washington state.
At least officially.
Because of what Roland Finston,
director of Medical Center health
physics, calls a "quirk in the law,"
unregulated amounts of radioactive
material are regularly flushed into
the sewer system at the University
Medical Center.
Radioactive medicines containing
Technicium 99m and lodine 131 and
administered to patients are ex
creted and allowed to flow freely into
the sewer system without treatment
or regulation. .
Research and industrial users of
radioactive materials are subject to
specific limits set by the California
Department of Health.
While radiation levels in sewage
are not regulated, they are moni
tored by sampling the water every
three months. According to Einston,
the largest contributor to the
radioactivity of the water is the Medi
cal Center.
"Fortunately, the isotope most
frequently used has a radioactive
half-life of six hours â€” Technicium
99m," stated Finston.
Greater hazard
More of an environmental hazard,
however, is the use in nuclear medi
cal therapy of lodine 131 due to its
lower half-life and its concentration
properties. Thyroid patients who re
ceived the treatment are often outpa
tients and excrete the medication
into different sewer systems. The
amount this isotope contributes to
sewer radioactivity is not well moni
tored.

"It appears to the state through
their testing of Bay waters, and the
EPA (Environmental Protection
Agency) through their testing of
areas near medical centers, that con
centrations of iodine residues are in
sufficient to cause a public health
hazard," Einston said.
The EPA is just beginning to re
search lodine 131 therapy to deter
mine if the cancer risk is greater than
benefits of its use. Estimates of its
cancer risk range from one in 3000 to
one in 30.
Only 170 millirems
According to Finston the require
ments for University laboratories are
such that a member of the public
could "drink out sewer water for a
whole year as hissole sourceofwater
and not receive more than 170 mil
lirems of radiation, which is the
maximum permissible dosage.
"Under the agreement with the
Department of Health, the University
maintains radioactive concentrations
at one-thi rd the level permitted other
licensees in recognition of the state's
waiving the 1 curie per year limit for
each licensee at Stanford," he said.
Finston said the University dis
charges approximately 2.3 curies of
radiation per year.
One curie is equivalent to the radi
ation that would be released by one
gram of Radium 226, he added.
Finston said there is one receiving
station at the Med Center which in
spects incoming radioactive mate
rials. Each licensee or project must
then account for the materials used
on a quarterly basis.
Another precaution is a daily dis
posal limit for each lab or project.
Finston said that amount was "gen
erally a dose too small to have an
appreciable risk of disease."
