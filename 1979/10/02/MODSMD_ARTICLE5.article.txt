# Campus housing at critical low
## 
### Mark Hosbein 
Students are not the only ones suf
fering from the current housing
crisis. Faculty and staff members are
also inconvenienced by a tight hous
ing market.
The lack of student housing is forc
ing more students to live far from
campus. Insufficient housing hin
ders the University's faculty recruit
ment efforts, according to President
Richard Lyman.
And the paucity of low-income
housing in the area makes living near
campus virtually impossible for many
University employees.
Opinions abound on methods to
remedy the problem, but most au
thorities agree that the difficulties
cannot be solved overnight.
The Office of Facilities, Planning
and Construction is planning to al
leviate the frustration of scarce stu
dent housing.
Explaining a proposal under con
sideration, Director of Planning Phil
Williams said, "The goal of the stu
dent project is 800 new units near
Lagunita. We're looking at a combi
nation of three basic formats.
New dorm project
"First, there would be a dorm facil
ity, with a strong emphasis on unity,
a central dining facility, etc. We're
planning two or three row houses,
similar to the present design, as well
as about 300 suite units, which is pre

sently not offered on campus."
These plans are still on the drawing
board, Williams said, but preliminary
measures have already begun. The
five architectural firms bidding for
the project will present their designs
to the planning office this week. The
foredrawn dateforcompletion is fall,
1982.
The dearth of faculty housing is re
ceiving immediate attention. Accord
ing to Robert Summers, manager of
faculty/staff housing, 140 moderately
priced townhouses on Peter Coutts
Hill have been approved for con
struction.
Urgent need
"The project is a response to the
urgently needed faculty housing,"
Summers said. "Attracting faculty to
the University is difficult when no
guarantees can be given on housing.
We hope this will help."
The townhouses are scheduled for
completion in early 1980.
Critical shortages also exist in the
area of low-income housing. The
University, United Stanford
Employees (USE) and the Mid-
Peninsula Coalition Housing Fund
and Development Corporation are
searching for ways to resolve this
predicament.
Willow Road plan denied
Palo Alto City Council dismissal of
the suggested Willow Road exten
sion precluded the possibility of a

housing development on land adja
cent to the Stanford Shopping
Center.
"As far as low-income housing is
concerned, since the council's rejec
tion of the Willow Road extension,
the 46-acre site has been foreclosed,
and not much else can be done,"
Summers said.
Julia Harvey, a member of the USE
executive board, said, "Not only the
1400 members of USE, but the 2000-
plus low-income office workers
employed by the University, are find
ing it nearly impossible to find hous
ing ... as far as I can see, things are
not going to get better."
Outside shortage drastic
The shortage of low-income hous
ing outside the University is even
more acute. Mid-Peninsula Housing
Fund member Robert Moulton
explained that, "Ten years ago, during
the increase of social programs, a
commitment was made for low
income housing. Since nothing was
acted upon promptly, the feeling
began to diminish."
The Housing Fund has opened a
limited number of low-income resi
dential units but cannot satisfy de
mand. "In our new Mountain View
facility, we already have 650 applic
ants for 100 units," said Moulton.
"That how bad the problem is."
"The problem is going to get much
worse."
