# Oral exams, adviser relations
## 'Survival tips' for grad students 
### Ken Kurosu 
Starting this quarter the Learning As
sistance Center (LAC) is offering a
seminar series and peer counseling
program designed specifically to
serve graduate students.
The seminars, cosponsored by the
Graduate Division and the LAC, under
the title "Getting there: Survival tips for
graduate students," deal with adminis
trative, academic and social problems
graduate students may not have faced
in their undergraduate years.
Eight sessions are scheduled on to
pics, including special problems minor
ity students face, oral exam prepara
tion, speaking techniques and adviser
relations.
Administrative details
"I thought I knew this stuff, but I
came away with a lot of new informa
tion," said one student attending the
first seminar last Thursday â€” adminis
trative details of graduate student re
gistration and tuition requirements.
"Stanford is geared toward students
in law, medicine, and engineering,"
said one student who asked not to be
named. "As a result, the problems

which other graduate students face
such as finding adequate funding are
not regarded with as much gravity as
they might be at other schools," she
said.
At the same time, she added, stu
dents aren't knowledgeable about
manipulating the red tape in the
bureaucracy, "and this places them at
an ever greater disadvantage."
"Graduate students encounter a var
iety of problems which differ from
those of undergraduates," said Kathy
Kirmil-Gray , a fifth-year graduate stu
dent in counseling psychology and
coordinator of the series.
Being unique
"You're thrown into an atmosphere
where you face immediate and heavy
assessment, while also being expected
to produce." The pressures of "trying
to be unique" in such an environment
can be overwhelming, she said.
According to Kirmil-Gray the semi
nar series grew out of four pilot semi
nars held last spring.
Although all graduate students are
welcome, the program places special
emphasis on the problems of minority

students and women returning to
school after an absence.
The weekly Thursday seminars are
held at noon in the Meyer Forum room.
This week's session will feature a panel
discussion on minority views of
graduate work at Stanford.
Personal problems
At the same time, LAC is initiating a
graduate student peer counseling
program.
The program will provide assistance
to personal and administrative prob
lems as well as tutorial services in En
glish and mathematics beginning Nov.
1, according to John Timpane, a fifth
year graduate student in English and
coordinator for the peer counseling
service.
"Many graduate students won't
admit it if they get into trouble," Tim
pane said. "It's important to realize that
there is now a place to go," he added.
Given the nature of problems
graduates face in working with the ad
visers, writing dissertations, and pre
paring for orals, Timpane said
"graduate students are best equipped
to help" each other.
