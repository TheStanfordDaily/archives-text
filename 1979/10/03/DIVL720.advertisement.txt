Live in Dallas
The Southwest's largest and liveliest metropolitan area.
Discover all the glitter and glamour, spectacular sport and high fashion Dallas is
famous for — yet an economical place to make a home. Cost of living is way below
the urban U.S. average. And there's no state income tax. The country's 7th largest
city has year-round sunshine plus lots of lakes and facilities to enjoy it. Dallas and
surrounding area has 47 colleges, 50 hospitals, 2 major medical education and
research institutions, and a wealth of major media and entertainment.
