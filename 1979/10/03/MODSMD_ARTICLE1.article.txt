"I figured if I had to wait in line for
an hour to defer my tuition, the
University could waste an hour
counting it," said senior Doug Feld.
And count it they did. For naif an
hour yesterday, three cashiers in
Old Union counted handfuls of
one-dollar bills dumped onto the
cashier's counter by Feld, a
phil osophy major. Wearing a
three-piece suit and red tennis
shoes, the Theta Xi resident walked
into the Stanford Shopping Center
branch of Bank of America yester
day morning, withdrew $1876 in
one dollar bills and carried his stuf
fed satchel to Old Union where he
paid his tuition bill. "I worked in a
bank and I know the games you can
play," Feld said. And the reaction of
the cashiers? "It's legal tender,"
said cashier supervisor Frank Borg.
