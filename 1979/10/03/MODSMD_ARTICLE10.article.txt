Belgrade, Yugoslavia (AP) —
Seeking to reduce the turbu
lence in world money markets,
the International Monetary
Fund appears ready to endorse
a plan to reduce the amount of
dollars in the international fi
nancial system.
U.S. Treasury Secretary G.
William Miller and other fi
nance ministers on the IMF's
powerful Interim Committee
are expected to approve in
principle a plan to establish a
so-called substitution account
for dollars held by IMF
member governments.
The committee met here
Monday before yesterday's
opening of the IMF's four-day
annual meeting. It is the first
time the U.N.-sponsored fi
nancial organization is meeting
in a Communist country.
Details ot the substitution
account would be worked out
over the next several months to
be ready for final approval next
spring. It all goes well, the ac
count could be in operation as
early as mid-1980, IMF officials
say.
Under the plan, IMF mem
bers could trade in
government-held dollars tor
assets denominated in the spe
cial currency of the I Ml known
as Special Drawing Rights or
SDKs.
The United States would pay
interest on the dollars to the
IMF, which would forward the
interest to the countries that
traded in the dollars.
Saudi Arabia, West Germany

and Japan are the countries
holding the largest amounts of
dollars and would be most
likely to use the account.
IMF sources say it is likely the
account would start out with at
least $20 billion, but that this
could be expanded if it works
properly.
Although $20 billion would
absorb only a small fraction of
the dollars held by foreign
governments, it is hoped the
amount would be large
enough to help restore order
to world currency markets.
Until recently, the United
States opposed the trade-in,
but (hanged its position a few
months ago after it became
evident the dollar faced ex
change market pressures that
could continue indefinitely un
•ess something was done.
Jacques Polak, the IM's
c hiet economist, said Sunday
that establishment of the sub
stitution account would help to
reduce the almost total re
liance of the international
monetary systcim on lite 1 dollar.
