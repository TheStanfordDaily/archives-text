# Soviets need labor force, urge elders not to retire
## 
### 
Moscow (AP) — The Soviet
Union, faced by serious labor
shortages and a need to sup
port millions of old-age pen
sioners, announced new mea
sures yesterday to encourage
older citizens to keep working.
The current retirement age
in most jobs is 60 years for
men and 55 for women. But li
mited numbers of pensioners
have long been a common
sight in Soviet offices, trans
port services and factories,
working to avoid boredom or
to supplement pension in
come.
Seeking to increase this
number, the decree published
in newspapers yesterday said
"necessary conditions" — ap
parently financial ones — to

keep more pension-age work
ers in the labor force had not
previously existed.
The decree permits pen
sioners who stay on the job
after retirement age to get
larger pension payments in
subsequent years. Other pro
visions call for the retention of
all or part of a worker's income
while earning wages from
work.
The United States last year
passed a law raising the legal
mandatory retirement age
from 65 to 70 for most workers,
effective Jan. 1 of this year. The
law also abolished entirely the
mandatory retirement age of 70
for most federal employees.
The minimum Soviet pen
sion now stands at 45 rubles.

$70 per month, for industrial
workers and 20 rubles, $31 per
month, for collective farmers.
The farmers' figure is to rise to
28 rubles, $44, on )an. 1, 1980.
The minimum pension level
is well below the average
Soviet industrial wage of some
165 rubles, $258 per month,
making additional sources of
money highly attractive.
More than 28 million Soviets
are of retirement age or older,
with women far outnumbering
men.
The new decree provides a
10-ruble, $15.60, per month
hike in their pensions after re
tirement for each year of work
after retirement age, up to a
maximum of 40 rubles.
