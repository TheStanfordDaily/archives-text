# Women's Studies courses: Developing a 'program'
## 
### Maria Higuera 
There comes a time in every under
graduate's life when she must choose a
major.
For Eva Lohrer, a junior majoring in Wo
men's Studies, the choice represents not
only the usual hassles with distribution re
quirements and advisers, but also includes
the challenge of designing her own cross
disciplinary program.
After spending last spring at the University
of California at Santa Cruz, Eva is now back
here and, although she says she is very ex
cited about her decision to major in Wo
men's Studies, she recognized the difficul
ties in developing a program and admits,
"Sometimes I get angry about it."
Active for some time in the women's
movement, Lohrer never really thought
about studying it in an academic setting until
she "stumbled into the (Women's Studies)
program" at Santa Cruz, of which she speaks
very highly: "It's not a big or solid program,
but I thought it was terrific. People were re
ally interested, excited and much more op
timistic about what could be done than they
are here."
Task force
While Lohrer was off at Santa Crrz last
spring, back at the Farm the Center for Re
search on Women (CROW) organized a task
force of faculty and students to assess the
current status of women's studies hete.
By January, the Task Force will recommend
an academic program suited to the needs of
University students as determined by surveys
of existing programs here and at other in
stitutions. The CROW Task Force is focusing
on the departments of Humanities and Sci
ences and the Western Culture program in
addition to looking at existing inter
departmental programs as models for the
study of women.
Task Force member Shareen Arent, a
senior majoring in American Studies, echoes
Lohrer's opinion: "Women's Studies is just
as important an issue as any other and there
should definitely be a program; not specifi
cally a department, though."
Although "department" sounds more sta
ble and possibly more desireable, a "prog
ram" suits the subject matter better; accord

ing to Myra Strober, CROW Director, "The
study of women needs to be integrated into
many departments."
No 'coherent' program
Both Lohrer and Arent agreed that there
are many excellent courses currently availa
ble both within the departments and
SWOPSI; however, as Strober stated, "The
courses offered are not a coherent group.
People teach courses as their interests dic
tate," and that makes for a curriculum full of
gaps. Arent complained about the lack of
upper division classes and feels her ad
vancementwas hindered: "You can't get into
very advanced studies when it's impossible
to be with a group of students who already
know the fundamentals."
The formation of a program would stabilize
and broaden the course offerings that study
women and coordinate existing courses to
minimize scheduling conflicts. For now,
CROW aids students by printing up a list of all
the courses that study women. Its primary
concern is research, however, and in that
capacity CROW serves the faculty more than
the students. As associate professor of politi
cal science, Nannerl Keohane, said, "CROW
acts as a very important intellectual stimulus
to the faculty."
Feminism?
just how much of a feminist bent the prog
ram should have, said Arent, is another as
pect of Women's Studies that the task force is
considering. Women's Studies aren't per se
"feminist." "Feminism" incorporates certain
values, and its perspective is fundamentally
critical and questioning. The CROW task force
hopes to see 'the goals and ideals of
feminism to be the goals and ideals of the
program at Stanford," Arent said.
Associate History Prof. Carolyn Lougee
heads a committee working on integrating a
feminist perspective into the Western Cul
ture program. As it stands, the program
studies very few — if any — women. "It isn't
accurate to give the impression that culture
was created exclusively by and for men," re
marked Lougee.
Lohrer sees the importance of feminism
particularly in a political light commenting
that, "There should be a course on feminism
just like there is one on Marx."
