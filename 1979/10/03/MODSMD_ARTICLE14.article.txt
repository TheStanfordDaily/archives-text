# Director promotes understanding, not swimming
## Campus YWCA gets new location

The YWCA. The average student here
would probably envision some septic
swimming pool run by an old Y director
sporting bloomer shorts and a whistle
around her neck
However, according to Patsy Phillips,
executive director of the Stanford YWCA,
the YWCA seeks mainly "to thrust our col
lective power toward the elimination of
racism wherever it exists and by any means
necessary."
On campus, the organization draws to
gether women from diverse backgrounds
and various ethnic groups, enabling them
to enrich their personal lives as well as
opening doors of effective service to others
— and there isn't a pool in sight.
The Stanford YWCA has been under the
direction of Phillips for the past year.
However, her involvement with the na
tional association is nothing newto her. As
an undergrad at the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, she was a member of the
student steering committee and also in
volved with the National Student Board.
Later, she took on her first professional
YWCA position in Atlanta, Georgia, and
was eventually transferred here.
Publicity and growth
In the opinion of Sharon Collins, new
tull-time office manager and a recent
graduate, "The amount of publicity and
resulting growth and interest in the prog
ram since Phillip's arrival has been incred
ible."
Changes undergone in this short time
span include a move from the Clubhouse
near White Plaza to the new YWCA —
Women's Center in Encina Hall, an in
crease of almost five times as many course

offerings and the extension of two half
time positions into full-time employees.
One of these employees, Program Di
rector Susan Stuber, operates out of a
separate office located in the Escondido Vil
lage Center, She and the Escondido resi
dents, mostly married or foreign graduate
students, are working together to deter
mine the needs of the village and to de
velop special programs to meet these
needs.
Network of nationalities
One of her main concerns is bringing
together the different nationalities of the
village. Stuber said she hopes to, "in
crease the success of the program commit
tee, an already strong network between
Latin Americans and Europeans within the
village."

Stuber deals with a diverse range of the
village's needs. Last summer, in response
to the effects of Proposition 13, she in
itiated a four week session of classes for
kids. Due to the project's success, it is
being continued this fall. The Village
Center also provides free child care for
women enrolled in English classes.
An option for staff positioning is the
1979-1980 Y-Women's Bureau. The Stan
ford YWCA has received Santa Clara
County Comprehensive Employment
Training Act (CETA) funding for these
three program director positions. The
purpose of the project is to estalish a com
prehensive referral and information ser
vice on issues of concern to women and
women's groups on campus.
The staff will be responsible for gather
ing, cataloguing and maintaining infor
mation on needed services for women on
and off campus.
For those people interested in taking
advantage of the many and varied YWCA
course offerings, registration for classes
held on main campus will be in the
Y-Women's Center in Encina Hall, Monday
thru Friday, Sept. 24 thru Oct. 5. A separate
registration will be conducted for all those
classes offered through the Village
Center.
Among the 45 different courses being
offered are: ballet, yoga, tai chi, corn row
ing, basic automobile mechanics, quilting,
tennis and self defense. No — not a single
one of them revolves around a septic old
swimming pool. Stanford's YWCA is
much, much more and still growing at an
amazing pace. Register for a class, or get
involved with a steering position — but
don't bring along a bathing suit.
