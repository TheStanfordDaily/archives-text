## Coffee House analyzed 
### 
The firing this summer of 39
employees at the Coffee House in Tre
sidder Memorial Union, while undeni
ably inexcusable and unfortunate, may
serve to focus student and administra
tion efforts on making eating establish
ments at Tresidder and elsewhere on
campus into places more in tune with
the needs and desires of a not-too
homogenous University community.
We fully support the efforts of the
fired workers to alert the University
community to the circumstances under
which they were fired, without notice
one August Friday afternoon.
Guckenheimer, the parent company
of TDS, contracted by the University'to
operate the Coffee House, the Transi
tion, Encina Commons and several
other eating places on campus, claims
that the firings were an attempt to make
a clean sweep at the Coffee House and
transform it into a place to better meet
the needs of the community. However,
we find most convincing the claims of
the fired workers that their talk of or
ganizing into a bargaining labor force
was the reason for the firing.
And even though some administrators
here are willing to accept the former exp
lanation for the firing, we are not.
However, the fact remains that the
deed has been done and this case is as
clear an example as you may find of a
wrong that is difficult, if not impossible,
to right. In addition, the current boycott
of TDS establishments here, while well
intended and effective, is not something
we care to see go on forever.
Ideally, a settlement will be reached
soon between the fired workers and TDS
to bring down the picket signs and open
up TDS concerns to those honoring the
boycott, as well as those who have eaten
at those places with a heavy heart. The
fact is that major eating establishments
on the central campus cannot continue
to be the focus of an endless boycott.
The Transition and the Coffee House are
necessary establishments now, regard
less of the quality of service each pro
vides.
We encourage both parties directly
involved in the dispute to reach some
sort of an agreement as soon as possible.
And we encourage the University to do
its part in seeing that operations at Tre
sidder return to normal.
But an immediate end to the present
controversy will not end the myriad of
problems we see with the food opera
tions at Tresidder and elsewhere here.
TDS made a legitimate point when it
criticized the "closed community" at
mosphere of the Coffee House. With
only one establishment open evenings
on campus, it should appeal to a broad

based clientele. Only then can
specialized establishments be justified.
And there is little question that the
prices at both the Coffee House and
Transition are too high for the quality
and quantity served. Contrary to what
the outside world may think, this is not a
school where everyone has money to
burn.
We applaud the University's consider
ing the formation of a governing board
of students, faculty and staff for Tresid
der and strongly urge them to follow
through with the idea. Greater commun
ity input into the Union will certainly
help to improve its responsiveness to
the community's needs.
To complete the transformation of
Tresidder into a better student union,
however, we recommend that the con
tract with TDS to operate its concerns
not be renewed when it expires in April.
The company has proven its ineptness in
the quality of management of its opera
tions here and the firing of the Coffee
House employees is simply the final
straw placed on the sagging back of eat
ing operations here.
And while taking bids for other com
panies to take over TDS's concerns, we
encourage the University to consider
taking over once again the operation of
all of the establishments now run by
TDS.
The needs of a university community
make operating a good campus eating
establishment a questionable business
proposition. Late hours, a wide variety of
food types and reasonable prices are not
mutually exclusive, but they can conflict.
And a strictly profit-oriented company
will opt for the most cost-effective resol
ution to such conflicts, often at the ex
pense of the clientele.
The varied interests of the Stanford
community can best be gauged and met
by establishments directly operated by
the University. Regardless of what type
of management the University would
choose forthe Coffee House and Transi
tion, student or otherwise, the Univer
sity would almost certainly be more sen
sitive and responsive to the community.
The University must begin exploring
its alternative now, not in April, as the
TDS contract is about to expire and an
expedient decision is needed. Some of
the establishments might be best run by
students — others not. Let's analyze the
situation now so an intelligent choice
can be made in the spring.
But first, let's hope for a fair settlement
soon in the current dispute so that until a
better management of the eating con
cerns here is with us, there are places to
eat without feeling like an anti-labor
zealot.

not be renewed when it expires in April.
The company has proven its ineptness in
the quality of management of its opera
tions here and the firing of the Coffee
House employees is simply the final
straw placed on the sagging back of eat
ing operations here.
And while taking bids for other com
panies to take over TDS's concerns, we
encourage the University to consider
taking over once again the operation of
all of the establishments now run by
TDS.
The needs of a university community
make operating a good campus eating
establishment a questionable business
proposition. Late hours, a wide variety of
food types and reasonable prices are not
mutually exclusive, but they can conflict.
And a strictly profit-oriented company
will opt for the most cost-effective resol
ution to such conflicts, often at the ex
pense of the clientele.
The varied interests of the Stanford
community can best be gauged and met
by establishments directly operated by
the University. Regardless of what type
of management the University would
choose forthe Coffee House and Transi
tion, student or otherwise, the Univer
sity would almost certainly be more sen
sitive and responsive to the community.
The University must begin exploring
its alternative now, not in April, as the
TDS contract is about to expire and an
expedient decision is needed. Some of
the establishments might be best run by
students — others not. Let's analyze the
situation now so an intelligent choice
can be made in the spring.
But first, let's hope for a fair settlement
soon in the current dispute so that until a
better management of the eating con
cerns here is with us, there are places to
eat without feeling like an anti-labor
zealot.
The firing this summer of 39
employees at the Coffee House in Tre
sidder Memorial Union, while undeni
ably inexcusable and unfortunate, may
serve to focus student and administra
tion efforts on making eating establish
ments at Tresidder and elsewhere on
campus into places more in tune with
the needs and desires of a not-too
homogenous University community.
We fully support the efforts of the
fired workers to alert the University
community to the circumstances under
which they were fired, without notice
one August Friday afternoon.
Guckenheimer, the parent company
of TDS, contracted by the University'to
operate the Coffee House, the Transi
tion, Encina Commons and several
other eating places on campus, claims
that the firings were an attempt to make
a clean sweep at the Coffee House and
transform it into a place to better meet
the needs of the community. However,
we find most convincing the claims of
the fired workers that their talk of or
ganizing into a bargaining labor force
was the reason for the firing.
And even though some administrators
here are willing to accept the former exp
lanation for the firing, we are not.
However, the fact remains that the
deed has been done and this case is as
clear an example as you may find of a
wrong that is difficult, if not impossible,
to right. In addition, the current boycott
of TDS establishments here, while well
intended and effective, is not something
we care to see go on forever.
Ideally, a settlement will be reached
soon between the fired workers and TDS
to bring down the picket signs and open
up TDS concerns to those honoring the
boycott, as well as those who have eaten
at those places with a heavy heart. The
fact is that major eating establishments
on the central campus cannot continue
to be the focus of an endless boycott.
The Transition and the Coffee House are
necessary establishments now, regard
less of the quality of service each pro
vides.
We encourage both parties directly
involved in the dispute to reach some
sort of an agreement as soon as possible.
And we encourage the University to do
its part in seeing that operations at Tre
sidder return to normal.
But an immediate end to the present
controversy will not end the myriad of
problems we see with the food opera
tions at Tresidder and elsewhere here.
TDS made a legitimate point when it
criticized the "closed community" at
mosphere of the Coffee House. With
only one establishment open evenings
on campus, it should appeal to a broad

based clientele. Only then can
specialized establishments be justified.
And there is little question that the
prices at both the Coffee House and
Transition are too high for the quality
and quantity served. Contrary to what
the outside world may think, this is not a
school where everyone has money to
burn.
We applaud the University's consider
ing the formation of a governing board
of students, faculty and staff for Tresid
der and strongly urge them to follow
through with the idea. Greater commun
ity input into the Union will certainly
help to improve its responsiveness to
the community's needs.
To complete the transformation of
Tresidder into a better student union,
however, we recommend that the con
tract with TDS to operate its concerns
not be renewed when it expires in April.
