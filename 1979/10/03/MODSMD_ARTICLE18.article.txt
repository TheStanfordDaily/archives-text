South Africa's apartheid re
gime continued its public rela
tions blitz this week by osten
tatiously legalizing black trade
unions and "suggesting" that
its bans on interracial sex and
marriage might be "im
proved." last )une, a represen
tative of the white supremacist
government, who announced
at the Washington Press Club
that apartheid is "dead or dy
ing' in South Africa, wds
greeted with enthusiastic
applause. The Washington
Post was suckered into praising
South Africa as the world's
"liveliest social laboratory".
The essence of this whole
sordid affair is that a combina
tion of internal and interna
tional pressures has awakened
Nazism's heirs tothe value of a
good media image in today's
world. Unfortunately, South
Africa suffers from far worse
than mere image problems.

Simply put, no unilateral ac
tion on the part of the Afrikan
ner state can be reasonably ex
pected to scratch, much less
topple, the pillars of apartheid..
The central program of that
state — the progressive de
nationalization and geographic
concentration of South Africa's
black population — continues
unabated. Various forms of
"petty apartheid" may fall by
the wayside for international
media consumption without
ever addressing the real issue
at stake." black political power.
Today white South Africa
looks forward to the day when
no black can make a claim to
citizenship and the power that
such a claim entails. The racist
regime believes to have found
an ingenious solution to the
'.'Bantu problem." This in
volves the now familiar reloca
tion of the families of black
workers to a string of invented

homelands scattered across
the country and the sub
sequent reduction of the na
tive population to the status of
migratory labor in its own land.
Any ostensible liberalization
that South Africa claims to un
dertake must be viewed in this
context. This country may an
nounce full rights for all its citi
zens over the next decade,
while simultaneously stripping
blacks of citizenship.
Who is being fooled by this
charade? Certainly not South
African blacks, or the rest of
Africa for that matter. The pol
icy of denationalization and
concentration has a horrible
precedent in this century. The
wholesale slaughter of a sig
nificant proportion of the
world's black population may

be too ghastly to contemplate,
but that possibility becomes
only more real with each pas
sing day. The Afrikanner state
not only has the canacity and
will to commit such an act, but
furthermore has the potential
to devastate the continent,
from Lagos to Dar Es Salaam.
We may in our lifetimes see
black African history set back a
century by the international
conflict that threatens to erupt
there. Such a conflict could not
help but have global implica
tions. The United States and its
corporations are long overdue,
in the words of a 1978 New York
Times editorial, to start "head
ing for the exit" in South Af
rica.
