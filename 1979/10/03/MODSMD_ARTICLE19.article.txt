Housing woes
Stanford has got to have the
worst residence system in his
tory. With all the pressure and
instability of Stanford
academics, you'd think the
least the University could do is
give students a solid home
base to operate out of.
What do we get instead? A
fruit-basket turnover every
year that dumps total strangers
into the same dorm and scat
ters friends to the four corners
of campus. As if this were not
enough, we also get a dorm
shortage which dooms 25 per
cent of the student body to the
boonies of Palo Alto every
year.
I don't know what the answer
is, but anything would be bet

ter than the Las Vegas-inspired
University's housing draw sys
tem.
Part of the problem is that
most dorms have no personal
ity. Exceptions such as Toyon,
Italian and French houses
satisfy the craving for dorm
flavor, but they are woefully
inadequate. All-freshman
dorms are successful because
students there have at least
freshme'n naivete in common.
The common bond that
makes living with other people
fun is missing from most Uni
versity residences.
No wonder so many guys
join fraternities.
