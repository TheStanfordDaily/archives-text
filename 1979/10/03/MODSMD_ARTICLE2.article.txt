# Students foresee end of pass-fail system
## Med School competency tests draw flak 
### Randy Broberg 
Efforts at the Medical School to
bolster student's knowledge of basic
sciences have angered some stu
dents there who foresee the possible
elimination of the school's pass-fail,
no-grade system.
These changes are being made in
response to an increasing failure rate
by students here on the National
Board Exams.
The initiation of competency tests
and the possible reinstatement of
academic honors at the school this
year is a direct response to a faculty
committee recommendation last
year suggesting the scho»l require
"each basic science department to
obtain from all students a demonst
ration of competence in basic sci
ences prior to graduation."
The report of the committee,
chaired by Pediatrics Prof. Ruth
Gross, also recommended that in
structors make efforts to identify
students with marginal performance
and provide them with "feedback."
This year, students who fail a pre
clinical course are required to de
monstrate their competency in one

of several ways: through an oral
examination, a written examination,
study sessions followed by an exam
or by repeating the course.
In addition, students get "feed
back" on tests by receiving anonym
ously their numerical scores and
their relationship to the class dis
tribution curves.
In the past, students failing
courses were not subjected to any
subsequent procedures. There was
an attempt to inform students of
their academic standing relative to
other students.
The Faculty Senate has recom
mended the controversial academic
awards be reinstated at the Med
School. The Committee of Courses
and Curriculum will study this prop
osal and return to the senate with
specific guidelines.
Students interviewed were upset
with the recent changes, saying that
the fact they were admitted was
proof they were already good stu
dents. They said competition Is not
necessary for high achievement.
"Stanford used to be different.
Now it is just as bad as all the other

schools," one student said.
The changes came about because
significantly more Med School stu
dents failed Part I of the National
Board Exams last year than in recent
years. The national boards are stan
dardized tests, similar to the Scholas
tic Aptitude Tests, and are required
for graduation from medical school.
Part I of the tests is usually taken
after the second year of medical
school and gauges the student's
knowledge of basic sciences. Part II
is usually taken after the third year in
medical school. School adminis
trators here reported no significant
changes in scores of Part II ovej the
last few years.
But last year, 16 percent of the
first-year students who took Part I of
the national boards failed. By com
parison, the failure rate of Part I for
1977 was 6 percent, and for 1976 and
1975 only 3 percent.
Dr. John Steward, associate dean
of student affairs at the Med School,
said the main reason for the rising
failure rate was that students did not
take the tests seriously.

With the high emphasis on re
search and electives, standardized
tests seemed to fall by the wayside,
he said.
Despite the recent increase in
board failures here, the Med SchooT
was still ranked second in the nation,
behind Harvard Medical School, in a
recent nation-wide poll of medical
school faculty.
