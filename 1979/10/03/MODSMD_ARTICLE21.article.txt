## Elway gets the cheers, Schonert the job Chris Haft 
### 
Head Coach Rod Dowhower's decision is fi
nal: Turk Schonert will start at quarterback
for Stanford in Saturday's football game
against UCLA. This news will doubtlessly dis
tress the vast majority of students, alumni
and other Cardinal fans who have embraced
John Elway and his lasers — er, passes.
Vet Schonert's starting mantle doesn't
mean that Elway is left hanging around the
sidelines like a juvenile delinquent on a
street corner, looking for trouble or some
body with whom to play catch. For
Dowhower has decided to use both quarter
backs extensively throughout the remainder
of the season. And, in this case, Dowhower's
reasoning is sound.
The UCLA game marks the opening of the
Pacific-10 Conference season, and the man
Dowhower wants as his signal-caller is the
man whose knowledge of Stanford's system
is most thorough. At this point, that man is
Schonert — but let Elway tell you that.
"Turk knows the offense a lot better than I
do," the freshman stated. "My game isn't
nearly as flexible as Turk's."
Elway also admitted that he still has prob
lems with throwing to the running backs
coming out of the backfield — a requisite for
a Card quarterback.
Schonert's detractors, however, would
likely maintain that he has problems throw
ing to anybody. During his tenure on the field
against Boston College, Schonert did throw
two or three embarrassing incompletions,
which are the kind of mistakes people re
member.
Certainly Elway left the field shining brigh
ter than Schonert in most observers' eyes.
Elway's 12 completions — a dozen golden
eggs, laid by a very rare goose — were pretty
to watt h.
After last Saturday's triumph, Dowhower
tried to give as much credit to Schonert as
possible, saying "He got us 10 points when
the going was tough."
Dowhower also threw the anti-Schonert
wolves a very substantial bone by announ
cing that although Schonert would start
against the Bruins, Elway would certainly
play.
But indeed, Schonert does deserve some
credit for his efforts last Saturday, especially
when one considers the fact that he com
pleted five passes to Ken Margerum in the

first half.
In addition to being one of the finest and
most amazing receivers extant, Margerum
gives Stanford a much-needed big-play
threat, as evidenced by his five touchdowns
on just 15 catches this season. Margerum is a
great Card strength, and Schonert exploited
that strength well.
Dowhower, of course, wants to exploit the
strength of having two solid quarterbacks.
Elway's performance last Saturday makes this
easier to achieve.
"John's performance does two things for
us," said Dowhower. "One, it takes pressure
off Turk and two, it takes pressure off John.
John can watch what's going on, what we're
trying to do offensively and get a feel for it."
Dowhower also has no desire to place the
burden — and it is one — of startingonyoung
Elway.
Making Llway the starter might put
unnecessary mental pressure upon him,
Dowhcjwer feared. "I don't want John to
think all week about starting against UCLA,"
said the coach.
Also, according to Dowhower, the starter
has the additional responsibility of "prob
ing" the opposition's defense; that is, select
ing a central series of plays that will probably
work. Dowhower figures that this task could
prove troublesome for Elway.
None of this bothers Flway in the least. "I
love Coach Dowhower," he said. "I think he's
a great guy. I have a lot of confidence in him,
and what he says goes."
Quarterback controversies are nothing
new to Stanford. From 1974 through 1976
Head Coach Jack Christiansen had one hell of
a time c (loosing between Mike Cordova and
Ciuy Benjamin — and for a short while, Jerry
Waldvogel.
No such state exists now, insisted Elway.
"It's not at all like that," he said. "Within the
team it's not a controversy, lurk's number
one and I'm number two and he (Dowhower)
is trying to get me experience in c ase some
thing happens to Turk."
Controversy will continue to be avoided as
long as Dowhower makes c lear-cut decisions
about his quarterbacks. He has promised to
start Schonert while giving Flway some play
ing time — fine. If the time comes for
Dowhower to change his mind, he must do
so just as assertively.

unnecessary mental pressure upon him,
Dowhcjwer feared. "I don't want John to
think all week about starting against UCLA,"
said the coach.
Also, according to Dowhower, the starter
has the additional responsibility of "prob
ing" the opposition's defense; that is, select
ing a central series of plays that will probably
work. Dowhower figures that this task could
prove troublesome for Elway.
None of this bothers Flway in the least. "I
love Coach Dowhower," he said. "I think he's
a great guy. I have a lot of confidence in him,
and what he says goes."
Quarterback controversies are nothing
new to Stanford. From 1974 through 1976
Head Coach Jack Christiansen had one hell of
a time c (loosing between Mike Cordova and
Ciuy Benjamin — and for a short while, Jerry
Waldvogel.
No such state exists now, insisted Elway.
"It's not at all like that," he said. "Within the
team it's not a controversy, lurk's number
one and I'm number two and he (Dowhower)
is trying to get me experience in c ase some
thing happens to Turk."
Controversy will continue to be avoided as
long as Dowhower makes c lear-cut decisions
about his quarterbacks. He has promised to
start Schonert while giving Flway some play
ing time — fine. If the time comes for
Dowhower to change his mind, he must do
so just as assertively.

Head Coach Rod Dowhower's decision is fi
nal: Turk Schonert will start at quarterback
for Stanford in Saturday's football game
against UCLA. This news will doubtlessly dis
tress the vast majority of students, alumni
and other Cardinal fans who have embraced
John Elway and his lasers — er, passes.
Vet Schonert's starting mantle doesn't
mean that Elway is left hanging around the
sidelines like a juvenile delinquent on a
street corner, looking for trouble or some
body with whom to play catch. For
Dowhower has decided to use both quarter
backs extensively throughout the remainder
of the season. And, in this case, Dowhower's
reasoning is sound.
The UCLA game marks the opening of the
Pacific-10 Conference season, and the man
Dowhower wants as his signal-caller is the
man whose knowledge of Stanford's system
is most thorough. At this point, that man is
Schonert — but let Elway tell you that.
"Turk knows the offense a lot better than I
do," the freshman stated. "My game isn't
nearly as flexible as Turk's."
Elway also admitted that he still has prob
lems with throwing to the running backs
coming out of the backfield — a requisite for
a Card quarterback.
Schonert's detractors, however, would
likely maintain that he has problems throw
ing to anybody. During his tenure on the field
against Boston College, Schonert did throw
two or three embarrassing incompletions,
which are the kind of mistakes people re
member.
Certainly Elway left the field shining brigh
ter than Schonert in most observers' eyes.
Elway's 12 completions — a dozen golden
eggs, laid by a very rare goose — were pretty
to watt h.
After last Saturday's triumph, Dowhower
tried to give as much credit to Schonert as
possible, saying "He got us 10 points when
the going was tough."
Dowhower also threw the anti-Schonert
wolves a very substantial bone by announ
cing that although Schonert would start
against the Bruins, Elway would certainly
play.
But indeed, Schonert does deserve some
credit for his efforts last Saturday, especially
when one considers the fact that he com
pleted five passes to Ken Margerum in the

first half.
In addition to being one of the finest and
most amazing receivers extant, Margerum
gives Stanford a much-needed big-play
threat, as evidenced by his five touchdowns
on just 15 catches this season. Margerum is a
great Card strength, and Schonert exploited
that strength well.
Dowhower, of course, wants to exploit the
strength of having two solid quarterbacks.
Elway's performance last Saturday makes this
easier to achieve.
"John's performance does two things for
us," said Dowhower. "One, it takes pressure
off Turk and two, it takes pressure off John.
John can watch what's going on, what we're
trying to do offensively and get a feel for it."
Dowhower also has no desire to place the
burden — and it is one — of startingonyoung
Elway.
Making Llway the starter might put
unnecessary mental pressure upon him,
Dowhcjwer feared. "I don't want John to
think all week about starting against UCLA,"
said the coach.
