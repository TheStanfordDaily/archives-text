### Jeremy Meier 
"It's just a matter of time,"
said an obviously confident
Brooks Johnson, new Stanford
trat k and field coach and the
first black head coach in Stan
ford history. The 45-year-old is
that confident of his eventual
success on the Farm.
lohnson, for the past two
years track and field coach at
Santa Fe Community College
in Gainesville, Florida, was
"head and shoulders above
everyone else" considered
during the national seart h for a
successor to retired coach
Payton Jordan, according to
Assistant Athletic Director Jim
Caughran.
Ciaughran, explaining the
final hiring process, said,
"Johnson did a super job in the
final interview. He blew them
(the other candidates) away.
He has knowledge, personal
ity, and relates well to the
things we do here."
Among his accomplish
ments, Johnson was an assis
tant coach at the l ( )7(> Montreal
Olympic (lames, head coach of

the U.S. National team, coach
of the U.S. t'.in Amerkan team
in 1971 and was two time head
coat h of the U.S. Women's Na
tional ream in I%'i and 1975.
Himself a former N.C.A.A.
track record holder for the in
door 60-yard dash, Johnson
h<.-. high hopes for Stanford
trat k and field.
"I am hoping to recapture
and build on what has hap
pened here before," Johnson
said." There are no limitations
because of the high level of
athletic ability and cerebral ac
tivity here."We came out
here," he added, "with the
idea of winning whatever there
is to be won."
His ideas tin how to rebuild a
Stanford team that finished last
in the Pac-10 last year em
phasize confidence and high
spirit. "We have a lot of young
athletes ant) this year will be an
adjustment year for both the
athletes and myself," Johnson
said, assuring that "there is no
question in my mind that we
can (eventually) compete with
U C I A and U S C."

Reflecting on when Stanford
might reach the level of teams
likeU CIA, Johnson said, "If
we're lucky it will take three
years but realistically probably
closer to four or five."

For now, lohnson wants to
"dwell on the positive high
li^ht of the past" and "get
people to stop quaking when
they hear about UCLA or
U S C.
"In football, when you talk
about Stanford quarterbacks

or wide receivers there is cre
dibility and I (an remember
when thi' same was true with
track and field athletes,"
lohnson continued, "and that
is going to be true again."
A major emphasis of
lohnson's program will be
placed on women's track and
field. "The women's team is
not a stepsister," lohnson said.
"It has parity with the men. I
think sexism is"the Same as ra
cism." Apparently Johnson's
emphasis on, the women
athletes meets with agreement
from the track athletes.
Gordy Banks, Stanford's 100-
and 200-meter sprinter who
served on the search panel that
ultimately selected Johnson,
saicJ, "The women's program
will be greatly improved this
year." Banks called lohnson
"the kind ot person we need —
a motivator, a recruiter, (who
is) good with public relations."
"The big difference this
year," said Hanks, "will be in
performance and attitude with
guys bettering their bests,
school records being broken,

and the team coming a lot
c loser in meets."
According to Ga ugh ran, the
fact that Johnson is black "had
nothing to do with the final hir
ing." However, Gaughran
does admit "it (the hiring of a
black coach) should have been
clone awhile ago." Downplay
ing the significance of his
being black, Johnson says,
"the fact that I am black is only
a transitory phenomena. Ulti
mately, I will be judged on the
program."
Ite did say, though, that "be
ing black is an added responsi
bility because it a black fails,
there might be those who
would say, 'see, this is what
happens when you hi re a black
c oach."
Another point Johnson
stresses concerns the idea th.it
since he is black he will attract
more black athletes to Stan
ford. "One of the myths of
coaching is that blacks can re
cruit blacks (better than
whites). A white coming into a
black's home can have a great
impact."

Gaughran is confident ot
Johnson's ability to recruit. He
said, "We expect him to do a
super job recruiting. FHe relates
well to student athletes."
Gaughran elaborated by say
ing, "Right now there are 10
track scholarships. Brooks will
have more scholarships. There
will be 14 . . . in a couple of
years."
As far as Stanford's high ad
missions standards, Johnson
said, "I feel it is a plus — a defi
nite plus." Furthermore, he
stressed, "being bright and
gifted helps on the field. It


Brooks )ohnson
makes the coach extend him
self because the coach is as
bright as the athletes."
This year Johnson will con
tinue to work with world-class
sprinter Steve Williams, whom
he has worked with since 1974,
and hopes to bring the Martin
Luther King Games, with such
athletes as Williams,
Steve Scott, and Ashford,
to Stanford in March
to run concurrently with the

Stanford Relays.
For now, though, Brooks
Johnson, "flattered to be the
first black head coach because
of the standards Stanford
adheres to," enters the 1979-
1980 season feeling that Stan
ford "presents a tremendous
challenge for me, but the
necessary ingredients for suc
cess are here ... I just want to
justify the faith and confidence
Andy Ceiger had in bringing
me here."

things we do here."
Among his accomplish
ments, Johnson was an assis
tant coach at the l ( )7(> Montreal
Olympic (lames, head coach of

the U.S. National team, coach
of the U.S. t'.in Amerkan team
in 1971 and was two time head
coat h of the U.S. Women's Na
tional ream in I%'i and 1975.
Himself a former N.C.A.A.
track record holder for the in
door 60-yard dash, Johnson
h<.-. high hopes for Stanford
trat k and field.
"I am hoping to recapture
and build on what has hap
pened here before," Johnson
said." There are no limitations
because of the high level of
athletic ability and cerebral ac
tivity here."We came out
here," he added, "with the
idea of winning whatever there
is to be won."
His ideas tin how to rebuild a
Stanford team that finished last
in the Pac-10 last year em
phasize confidence and high
spirit. "We have a lot of young
athletes ant) this year will be an
adjustment year for both the
athletes and myself," Johnson
said, assuring that "there is no
question in my mind that we
can (eventually) compete with
U C I A and U S C."

Reflecting on when Stanford
might reach the level of teams
likeU CIA, Johnson said, "If
we're lucky it will take three
years but realistically probably
closer to four or five."

For now, lohnson wants to
"dwell on the positive high
li^ht of the past" and "get
people to stop quaking when
they hear about UCLA or
U S C.
"In football, when you talk
about Stanford quarterbacks

or wide receivers there is cre
dibility and I (an remember
when thi' same was true with
track and field athletes,"
lohnson continued, "and that
is going to be true again."
A major emphasis of
lohnson's program will be
placed on women's track and
field. "The women's team is
not a stepsister," lohnson said.
"It has parity with the men. I
think sexism is"the Same as ra
cism." Apparently Johnson's
emphasis on, the women
athletes meets with agreement
from the track athletes.
Gordy Banks, Stanford's 100-
and 200-meter sprinter who
served on the search panel that
ultimately selected Johnson,
saicJ, "The women's program
will be greatly improved this
year." Banks called lohnson
"the kind ot person we need —
a motivator, a recruiter, (who
is) good with public relations."
"The big difference this
year," said Hanks, "will be in
performance and attitude with
guys bettering their bests,
school records being broken,

and the team coming a lot
c loser in meets."
According to Ga ugh ran, the
fact that Johnson is black "had
nothing to do with the final hir
ing." However, Gaughran
does admit "it (the hiring of a
black coach) should have been
clone awhile ago." Downplay
ing the significance of his
being black, Johnson says,
"the fact that I am black is only
a transitory phenomena. Ulti
mately, I will be judged on the
program."
Ite did say, though, that "be
ing black is an added responsi
bility because it a black fails,
there might be those who
would say, 'see, this is what
happens when you hi re a black
c oach."
Another point Johnson
stresses concerns the idea th.it
since he is black he will attract
more black athletes to Stan
ford. "One of the myths of
coaching is that blacks can re
cruit blacks (better than
whites). A white coming into a
black's home can have a great
impact."

Gaughran is confident ot
Johnson's ability to recruit. He
said, "We expect him to do a
super job recruiting. FHe relates
well to student athletes."
Gaughran elaborated by say
ing, "Right now there are 10
track scholarships. Brooks will
have more scholarships. There
will be 14 . . . in a couple of
years."
As far as Stanford's high ad
missions standards, Johnson
said, "I feel it is a plus — a defi
nite plus." Furthermore, he
stressed, "being bright and
gifted helps on the field. It


Brooks )ohnson
makes the coach extend him
self because the coach is as
bright as the athletes."
This year Johnson will con
tinue to work with world-class
sprinter Steve Williams, whom
he has worked with since 1974,
and hopes to bring the Martin
Luther King Games, with such
athletes as Williams,
Steve Scott, and Ashford,
to Stanford in March
to run concurrently with the

Stanford Relays.
For now, though, Brooks
Johnson, "flattered to be the
first black head coach because
of the standards Stanford
adheres to," enters the 1979-
1980 season feeling that Stan
ford "presents a tremendous
challenge for me, but the
necessary ingredients for suc
cess are here ... I just want to
justify the faith and confidence
Andy Ceiger had in bringing
me here."
"It's just a matter of time,"
said an obviously confident
Brooks Johnson, new Stanford
trat k and field coach and the
first black head coach in Stan
ford history. The 45-year-old is
that confident of his eventual
success on the Farm.

years track and field coach at
Santa Fe Community College
in Gainesville, Florida, was
"head and shoulders above

during the national seart h for a
successor to retired coach

Assistant Athletic Director Jim
