## Cardinals shade Washington, 2-0 
### Dean Eyre 
If, instead of the San lose
cable television coverage,
there had been a network
broadcast of Monday's soccer
match, Washington and Stan
ford could have been in con
tention for a shared Emmy
nomination. In which category
you ask? How about best
screenplay for a dramatic
series?
Following a scoreless first
half paced by Washington, the
Cardinals taught the Huskies
about dogged determination.
Persistence paid off, as Willie
Guicce shattered the deadlock
with a cannon shot 12 minutes
into the second half, assisted
by Greg Delgado. Guicce then
assisted Fred Benz, who scored
17 minutes later.
With only a one-goal advan
tage, a Card win was not cer
tain and even at 2-0, the game
wasn't signed and sealed as
both teams traded volleys at
their respective goals
throughout the game. Al
though not the most photo
genic soccer played on
Maloney Field, the element of
suspense made the whole af
fair a crowd pleaser.
Fhe win raises the Cards' re
cord to 6-0-1 and should push
them up in the Western rat
ings. Last week's seventh place
ranking was the best Stanford
showing in three years, but
head coach Nelson Lodge pre
dicted that "We should move
up in the ratings — Berkeley,
Fullerton and Seattle Pacific

got beaten. We've beaten two
Northwest powers. Now all we
have to do is to beat the South
ern teams (and of course, the
remaining conference
matches)."
Santa Clara and the Univer
sity of San Francisco, both fu
ture league opponents, are
ranked sixth and seventh in the
nation respectively. Seattle
Pacific was listed in the top 12
until their loss over the
weekend. According to Lodge,
the team to beat, both in con
ference play and for the rat
ings, is San jose State. The
Spartans can't be selected for
post-season play for the sec
ond straight year due to eligi
bility problems, but tliey can
occupy the spoiler role during
the '79 season, Lodge said.
That Washington is a
"Northwest power" was clear,
but while the Huskies' leading
trait was strength, the Cards'
strong suit was versatility.
"The team actually rallied
around our new player place
ment," Lodge said. "It's to be
expected during the season
that things can happen (i.e. last
Saturday's two injuries) — you
have to make adjustments and
it worked out for us. That's a
good sign.
"We tended to drop back
and wait for them," Lodge ad
ded. "The only thing we could
do was go to the long ball be
cause our midfield was back
with our defense. Fortunately
it worked but it wasn't our
game plan. But it's not how you
get the points, it's how many."
For Stanford, "how many"
turned out to be a couple and
although not resulting from
the usual short pass style of
play, the "how" of the actual
Card goals seemed at least as
exciting as taking and extend
ing the lead.
"Guicce was remarkable,"
Lodge recalled. "I haven't seen
a shot that hard in a long time.
Our freshman (Benz) scored a
beautiful goal — he put it (the
game) out of reach."
Guicce leads the team in
scoring with eight goals.
"There was a team trust be
cause they pressured us,"
Guicce said. "I'm looking for
ward to our next game. This
means a lot to the team — it's a
boost for us."
Neil Tennyson concurred
with Cuicce, particularly re
garding the team spirit in
Monday's match.
"We kept up the tradition of
being a second-half team," he
said. "The defense held up in
the first half, then dropped in
the second to protect (our
lead). It helps so much when
you're forced to trust everyone
else, then you trust yourself."
Stanford hosts Fresno Pacific
this afternoon at 3 p.m. on
Maloney Field. According to
Lodge, "The are really a good
club. Early in their season they

did some winning, but lately I
haven't heard of their scores.
They should play like Pomona
or Davis."
After bracing for the physical
match with Washington the
question of overlooking
Fresno Pacific arises.
"I think the team is good at
playing intensely against any
team," Dan McNevin said.
"Lodge is good about protect
ing us from (mental) let
downs."
"We're really playing one
game at a time," Tennyson ad
ded. "We have yet to play
beyond any team."

exciting as taking and extend
ing the lead.
"Guicce was remarkable,"
Lodge recalled. "I haven't seen
a shot that hard in a long time.
Our freshman (Benz) scored a
beautiful goal — he put it (the
game) out of reach."
Guicce leads the team in
scoring with eight goals.
"There was a team trust be
cause they pressured us,"
Guicce said. "I'm looking for
ward to our next game. This
means a lot to the team — it's a
boost for us."
Neil Tennyson concurred
with Cuicce, particularly re
garding the team spirit in
Monday's match.
"We kept up the tradition of
being a second-half team," he
said. "The defense held up in
the first half, then dropped in
the second to protect (our
lead). It helps so much when
you're forced to trust everyone
else, then you trust yourself."
Stanford hosts Fresno Pacific
this afternoon at 3 p.m. on
Maloney Field. According to
Lodge, "The are really a good
club. Early in their season they

did some winning, but lately I
haven't heard of their scores.
They should play like Pomona
or Davis."
After bracing for the physical
match with Washington the
question of overlooking
Fresno Pacific arises.
"I think the team is good at
playing intensely against any
team," Dan McNevin said.
"Lodge is good about protect
ing us from (mental) let
downs."
"We're really playing one
game at a time," Tennyson ad
ded. "We have yet to play
beyond any team."
If, instead of the San lose
cable television coverage,
there had been a network
broadcast of Monday's soccer
match, Washington and Stan
ford could have been in con
tention for a shared Emmy
nomination. In which category
you ask? How about best
screenplay for a dramatic
series?
Following a scoreless first
half paced by Washington, the
Cardinals taught the Huskies
about dogged determination.
Persistence paid off, as Willie
Guicce shattered the deadlock
with a cannon shot 12 minutes
into the second half, assisted
by Greg Delgado. Guicce then
assisted Fred Benz, who scored
17 minutes later.
With only a one-goal advan
tage, a Card win was not cer
tain and even at 2-0, the game
wasn't signed and sealed as
both teams traded volleys at
their respective goals
throughout the game. Al
though not the most photo
genic soccer played on
Maloney Field, the element of
suspense made the whole af
fair a crowd pleaser.
Fhe win raises the Cards' re
cord to 6-0-1 and should push
them up in the Western rat
ings. Last week's seventh place
ranking was the best Stanford
showing in three years, but
head coach Nelson Lodge pre
dicted that "We should move
up in the ratings — Berkeley,
Fullerton and Seattle Pacific

got beaten. We've beaten two
Northwest powers. Now all we
have to do is to beat the South
ern teams (and of course, the
remaining conference
matches)."
Santa Clara and the Univer
sity of San Francisco, both fu
ture league opponents, are
ranked sixth and seventh in the
nation respectively. Seattle
Pacific was listed in the top 12
until their loss over the
weekend. According to Lodge,
the team to beat, both in con
ference play and for the rat
ings, is San jose State. The
Spartans can't be selected for
post-season play for the sec
ond straight year due to eligi
bility problems, but tliey can
occupy the spoiler role during
the '79 season, Lodge said.
That Washington is a
"Northwest power" was clear,
but while the Huskies' leading
trait was strength, the Cards'
strong suit was versatility.
"The team actually rallied
around our new player place
ment," Lodge said. "It's to be
expected during the season
that things can happen (i.e. last
Saturday's two injuries) — you
have to make adjustments and
it worked out for us. That's a
good sign.
"We tended to drop back
and wait for them," Lodge ad
ded. "The only thing we could
do was go to the long ball be
cause our midfield was back
with our defense. Fortunately
it worked but it wasn't our
game plan. But it's not how you
get the points, it's how many."
For Stanford, "how many"
turned out to be a couple and
although not resulting from
the usual short pass style of
play, the "how" of the actual
Card goals seemed at least as
exciting as taking and extend
ing the lead.
