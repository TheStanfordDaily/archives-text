Cincinnati (AP) — Old pro
Willie Stargell walloped a
three-run homer in the 11th
inning, carrying the Pittsburgh
Pirates to a 5-2 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds in the opening
game of the National League
championship series last night.
Stargell unloaded on the first
pitch from relieverTom Hume,
sending it deep into the right
center field seats to break open
the tight, tense battle and bring
a sea of Pirates out of the dug
out to greet him.
It was the third career homer
in playoff'action for the 38-
year-old player slugger, who
was one of the keys in
Pittsburgh's dash to the NL East
title. He hit two in 1974 in a
losing effort against Los
Angeles.
Hume was working in relief
of Tom Seaver, who had
pitched brilliantly against Pi
rates starter John Candelaria
for eight innings. The ace of
the Reds bullpen held
Pittsburgh off through the
ninth and 10th innings, allow
ing only one harmless single
before the decisive 11th.
Tim Foli, who had delivered
a clutch sacrifice fly earlier in
the game, opened the 11th
with a single to left. Matt Ale
xander went in to run as slug
ger Dave Parker came to the
plate. The count went to 1-2
and Parker fouled off four
pitches before drilling a single
to left, which sent Alexander to
second.
Stargell was next and he
wasted no time with Hume. He
jumped on the first pitch he
saw and sent it high and deep
to the right-center field seats
for the decisive runs.
Pittsburgh threatened to add
to its lead, but Reds reliever
Dave Tomlin choked off the

rest of the rally. It didn't matter
because the Pirates had plenty
for winner Grant Jackson.
With two out in the 11th,
Jackson surrendered a single
to Dave Concepcion and a walk
to Foster, bringing Johnny
Bench to the plate. Don Robin
son, the Pirates fifth pitcher of
the night, relieved Jackson and
walked Bench on a 3-2 delivery.
But the next batter, Ray Knight,
struck out to end the game.
For seven innings, the game
was a brilliant duel between
Seaver and Candelaria. Each al
lowed five hits and two runs
and left the game in the eighth,
Seaver for a pinch hitter and
Candelaria for reliever Enrique
Romo.
Romo got into a jam, yielding
a one-out single to Dave Col
lins, who stole second, and
then walking Joe Morgan. That
brought in Kent Tekulve, ace ot
the Pirates bullpen, appearing
in his 95th game this season.
Tekulve fed a double play ball
to Dave Concepcion, ending
the rally. It was the last Reds hit
until there were two out in the
11th and, by then, Stargell's
shot had put Pittsburgh in con
trol.
Both Seaver and Candelaria,
experienced one bad inning
each. For the Reds' ace, it was
the third. Phil Garner,,leading
off, drilled a 2-0 pitch into the
right field seats for the game's
first run.
The Pirates added another
when speedster Omar Moreno
ripped a hit to right, and Col
lins missed his try for a diving
catch, allowing the ball to
reach the wall. Moreno ran it
into a triple and scored when
Foli hit a sacrifice fly to right
field.
Seaver then walked the next
two batters, Parker and

Stargell, but got out of the jam
by retiring John Milner on a
pop fly.
The Reds got even in the
fourth when Concepcion
opened with a single tp left. On
the first pitch to George Foster,
Cincinnati played hit-and-run.
Concepcion took off for sec
ond but slowed to a trot when
Foster jumped on Candelaria's
delivery and sent a 400-footer
into the second deck in dead
center field, tying the score
2-2.
The Reds managed only two
more hits the rest of the night
as Candelaria and the parade of
relievers held Cincinnati in

(j
check.
The end of the game, how
ever was full of drama as the
capacity crowd of 55,006 stood
roaring at the last-ditch Cin
cinnati rally. But Robinson
stopped them with his game
ending strikeout of Knight, giv
ing the Pirates the jump in this
best-of-five series.
It was the fifth extra inning
game in National League
playoff history and the fourth
one involving Cincinnati. The
Reds had won the first three —
in 197JD and '75 against
Pittsburgh and in 1973 against
the New York Mets. But the
magic ran out this timearound.

Baltimore (AP) — Jim Palmer
made a couple of obligatory
needling remarks about Earl
Weaver, his manager and an
tagonist, and then announced
himself fit to start the American
League playoffs.
The 33-year-old right
hander, with a 10-6 record this
season after winning 20 or
more games in eight of the past
nine, will be on the mound for
the Baltimore Orioles when
they open the best-of-five
series tonight against the
California Angels.
'No pressure'
"There's no pressure on
me," cracked Palmer, who
missed 14 starts during the sea
son because of assorted in
juries. "I have the best pitcher
in baseball following me. If I
lose, so what?"
Palmer referred to lefty Mike
Flanagan, Baltimore's second
game starter who topped the
major leagues with a 23-9 re
cord.
Manager Jim Fregosi of the
Angels has named strikeout ar
tist Nolan Ryanand Dave Frost,
both 16-game winners, to start
the first two games in Balti
more before action shifts to the
West Coast.
Pitching rotation
Weaver, whose pitching ro
tation was at first questioned
by Palmer, reiterated his
reasoning as the Orioles pre
pared for a final workout yes
terday on a rain-soaked Memo
rial Stadium field.
"Palmer has a 7-2 record in
postseason games," Weaver
said. "He doesn't beat himself
and he's been through all the
hoopla before. In my mind,
there was no reason not to start
him."
Palmer lost his last start
against Detroit Friday night,

but said his arm felt better than
itiias since early in the season.
Fregosi also was asked to
explain why he chose to open
with Ryan, who has a 5-13
lifetime record against the
Orioles and is 0-6 in nine starts

since last beating Baltimore.
"He's due to win, ain't he?"
Fregosi said. "If Nolan Ryan is
right, he can beat anybody. He
was a better pitcher this year
than ever, and he's going to get
better."
