## An old dog shows some new tricks

Cincinnati (AP) â€” They asked
38-year-old Willie Stargell how
long he plans on sticking
around baseball and he came
up with a simple reply.
"I'm going to keep on play
ing as long as I get
goosebumps and butterflies,"
he said.
Stargell admitted he felt a
whole lot of both last night as
he hit an 11th-inning three-run
homer which gave the
Pittsburgh Pirates a 5-2 victory
over Cincinnati in the first
game of the National League
playoffs.
Stargell said after the game
he didn't know how much
longer he would continue to

serve as the Pirates' anchor,
the way he has this season.
"When I lose that en
thusiasm then I'm going to step
aside and let some other
youngsters enjoy the game as I
have," Stargell said.
Stargell's homer off relief
pitcher Tom Hume came after
Tim Foli and Dave Parker had
both singled to open the 11th.
"I just closed my eyes and
swung. When I looked, it was
gone," Stargell said.
For the Pirates, the opening
game was sweet revenge. They
lost to the Reds in the playoffs
in 1970, 1972 and 1975, when
they were swept in three
straight.
