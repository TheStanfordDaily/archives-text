# Tresidder rendered powerless
## 
### Brian Sprague 
It was not a plot by the "True Coffee
House" members to undermine
their previous employers. Nor was it
a maneuver to irritate the senators
convened at Tresidder Union for the
California Senate Education Commit
tee meeting.
It was merely the underground
explosion of an old power cable,
causing a six-hour blackout yester
day atTresidderand Bowman Alumni
House.
At approximately 5 a.m. yesterday
one of three 4160-volt cables servic
ing Tresidder and Bowman "drop
ped," causing a brownout until 10
a.m. when all power was cut, said
head electrician Al Wells.
"The cable is at least 13 years old,"
said Wells. "It's not an uncommon
occurence for an old one to blow."
According to Wells, at least three
othercables haveexploded thisyear.
The cable burst in the conduit
under Tresidder causing no serious
additional damage, said Wells. How
ever, it could have caused a small fire
if it had blown in the tunnel below
the manhole.
"Most other systems have back-up
lines so we can just switch the lines
and get power back to the folks while
we fix the trouble spot," Wells
explained. At Tresidder, however,
there is only one line into the build
ing.
To prevent food spoilage at the
Transition and Coffee House, Plant
Services was forced to rent a large
gas-powered generator from San
lose, said James Horgan, assistant
director of Service Operations. The
stand-in generator was in service by
12:15 p,m., he said.
Jeff Nelson, facilities and opera
tions manager, said that because
only the one generator was available,
no back-up power was allocated to
the Coffee House.
"The Transition has more re
frigerator space, so it was the logical
choice to receive the power," he
said. This meant all perishable goods
had to be transported from the Cof
fee House to the Transition's re

frigerators.
Almost all businesses except for
the Transition were closed during
the power shortage. Sequoia Travel
was able to continue operating by
linking lines with its sister agency,
BungeyTravel in Palo Alto. However,
service took about four times longer
than normal, said one employee.
Secretaries at Bowman had to go to
nearby offices to type.
Telephone bells and lights were
not functioning to signal incoming
calls, so employees at both Tresidder
and Bowman would pick up the re
ceivers at regular short intervals to
find out if anyone was trying to call
in.
"It was hectic, but we got through
it," commented one secretary.

At2:ssp.m. the back-up generator
was disconnected and by 3 p.m. the
main switch was thrown, restoring
power to the two buildings.
Leonard Duz, a Plant Services elec
trician, said the two remaining cables
were tested twice and are "good but
not too good."
"You can never tell about these
cables," Dua said. To be safe Plant
Services plans to replace all three ca
bles, he added.
The cables will probably be re
placed on a weekend when the in
convenience would be minimal, said
Wells. "We might even wait until
winter break," he said. The timing
will depend upon cable delivery,"
which might take up to 40 weeks,
Wells added.

service took about four times longer
than normal, said one employee.
Secretaries at Bowman had to go to
nearby offices to type.
Telephone bells and lights were
not functioning to signal incoming
calls, so employees at both Tresidder
and Bowman would pick up the re
ceivers at regular short intervals to
find out if anyone was trying to call
in.
"It was hectic, but we got through
it," commented one secretary.

At2:ssp.m. the back-up generator
was disconnected and by 3 p.m. the
main switch was thrown, restoring
power to the two buildings.
Leonard Duz, a Plant Services elec
trician, said the two remaining cables
were tested twice and are "good but
not too good."
"You can never tell about these
cables," Dua said. To be safe Plant
Services plans to replace all three ca
bles, he added.
The cables will probably be re
placed on a weekend when the in
convenience would be minimal, said
Wells. "We might even wait until
winter break," he said. The timing
will depend upon cable delivery,"
which might take up to 40 weeks,
Wells added.
