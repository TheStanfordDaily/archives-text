# Ruggers scram in summer scrum in New Zealand
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
While most of us were relaxing on our respec
tive beaches or bagging groceries in our respec
tive supermarkets this summer, the Stanford
rugby team could be found skiing, hiking
through a rain forest, or relaxing in a quaint New
Zealand pub.
The club raised $32,000 last year to send 23
players, a manager and a coach to New Zealand
for four weeks. While there the club played five
games against Otago University, Lincoln Col
lege, Canterbury University, Victoria College
and Auckland University.
Though the club lost all five games, they did
hold their own against all but one of the schools,
Canterbury, to whom they lost 24-4. Against
Otago, the closest game of all five, they lost by
only 2 points, 6-4. To Lincoln College they lost
21-9, though it was only 11-9 with 10 minutes
remaining. They lost to Victoria 18-10, and to
Auckland 14-8.
lack Bunce, captain of the team, was not dis
heartened by the losses in the least. "The guys
on their (New Zealand's) teams have been play
ing rugby since they were in first grade, so their
instincts for the game are better/'Bunce said.
"Most of us grew up playing football. I would
say we had better athletes, but it's a whole diffe
rent game. They were always in the right place at
the right time," he added.
Rugby Club vice-president Walter Herring ag
reed with Bunce. "We didn't beat any of them,
but we learned a lot," he said. "Most of our guys
started playing only two or three years ago. Very
few people have as much playing experience as
they do over there."
Another member of the team, Frank Hicks, a
native Australian, put it best. "It's a bloody relig
ion over there."
Despite the straight losses, no one com
plained about the trip. "It was really very enjoy
able," Herring said. "Students from the univer

si ties put our players up and fed them, and took
them to the pubs ... it was a good chance for
both of us to see other students from other
countries."
"The people were great," Bunce said. "They
would've given us the shirts off their backs."
According to the players, the most impressive
aspect of the trip was the beauty of the country.
"The whole area is really beautiful," said Her
ring. "Huge wide-open spaces. Guys went ski
ing for $9 total, I mean poles, skis, transporta
tion, everything. It was incredible."
"There are two islands," Bunce added, "and
there's just so much packed into it. They have
everything, you name it: Alps, rain forests,
beaches, everything."
While there, the players also received some
expert coaching. A purely amateur sport in New
Zealand, rugby is run by one organization. Bill
Freeman, the head of all coaching and a man
known throughout New Zealand, came by to
help them out for a day.
Ron Scott, organizer of the Commonwealth
Games, also showed up. Scott is now known as
Sir Ron Scott, after being knighted by the Queen
for his services in organizing the Games.
"Even players and coaches from the other
teams would help us out and show us things,"
said Herring.
In spite of the talent on the team and the offer
of trips like this one, interest in Stanford rugby
has dropped in the last couple of years, Herring
noted. That makes it difficult to raise money for
future trips.
"Hypothetically, we would like to go to South
Africa or even England," Herring said. "We're
trying to use these trips as a kind of carrot, to get
people interested again, get them to sign up."
So sign up, guys.

"The people were great," Bunce said. "They
would've given us the shirts off their backs."
According to the players, the most impressive
aspect of the trip was the beauty of the country.
"The whole area is really beautiful," said Her
ring. "Huge wide-open spaces. Guys went ski
ing for $9 total, I mean poles, skis, transporta
tion, everything. It was incredible."
"There are two islands," Bunce added, "and
there's just so much packed into it. They have
everything, you name it: Alps, rain forests,
beaches, everything."
While there, the players also received some
expert coaching. A purely amateur sport in New
Zealand, rugby is run by one organization. Bill
Freeman, the head of all coaching and a man
known throughout New Zealand, came by to
help them out for a day.
Ron Scott, organizer of the Commonwealth
Games, also showed up. Scott is now known as
Sir Ron Scott, after being knighted by the Queen
for his services in organizing the Games.
"Even players and coaches from the other
teams would help us out and show us things,"
said Herring.
In spite of the talent on the team and the offer
of trips like this one, interest in Stanford rugby
has dropped in the last couple of years, Herring
noted. That makes it difficult to raise money for
future trips.
"Hypothetically, we would like to go to South
Africa or even England," Herring said. "We're
trying to use these trips as a kind of carrot, to get
people interested again, get them to sign up."
So sign up, guys.
