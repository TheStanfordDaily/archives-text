SALT shaky after speech
Washington — Republican leaders in the Se
nate said yesterday the SALT II treaty cannot be
ratified now, partly because President Jimmy
Carter has failed to separate the pact from the
continuing furor over Soviet combat troops in
Cuba.
But the Senate's Democratic leadership
fought to save the treaty, saying Carter has
succeeded in demonstrating that the presence
of 2600 soldiers in Cuba in no way over
shadows the importance of a treaty to control
the race in nuclear arms.
In his speech, Carter said he planned to in
crease U.S. surveillance of military activities in
Cuba, bolster U.S. naval and military presence
in the area and would speed more aid to Latin
American nations that feel threatened by the
Soviet-Cuba alliance.
But administration officials said yesterday
that Carter does not plan to take any steps
against the Soviet Union and has decided
against linking the troop issue to such matters
as trade with the Russians.
In the Senate, Republican leader Howard
Baker of Tennessee said he found Carter's re
sponse to the Soviet troop issue "disappoint
ing and inadequate" and said his count shows
SALT II would attract less than 60 votes if a final
test were held now.
"Call it linkage ifyou like," he said. "But I am
finally going to vote on the SALT II treaty de
pending on how the Russians are behaving,"
not only in Cuba but around the world.
Meanwhile, at the Defense Department, of
ficials said a force of Marines and sailors
aboard four amphibious ships will stage a rein
forcement demonstration later this month at
the Navy base at Cuantanamo, Cuba.
The exercise, seen as a modest show of
force, forms part of Carter's promised re
sponse to the Russians.
Nuke plant spews radioactivity
Red Wing — A steam tube ruptured yester
day at the Prairie Island nuclear generating
plant, releasing radioactive gases into the at
mosphere, but the amounts were so small they
could not be detected outside the plant, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.
Northern States Power Co. spokesman
Wayne Kaplan said a general emergency was
declared at the plant, 40 miles southeast of

Minneapolis-St. Paul, about 2:30 p.m.
Kaplan said the rupture in the steam tube
caused radioactive gases to be released inside
the plant and into the environment.
However, Kaplan said, radiaton monitoring
teams at the plant had been unable to detect
any radiation in the area around the plant by
late afternoon.
"Preliminary information indicates there
was a small release of radioactivity to the envi
ronment," said the NRC in a statement from
Washington."The licensee reports that pie
liminary measurements have not shown any
detectable increase of radioactivity off the site.
This is corroborated by in-plant measure
ments."
Storm disrupts balloon trip
Spencerville — The hopes of four bal
loonists for a successful non-stop, trans-
America flight ended early yesterday when a
severe thunderstorm forced them to scuttle
their balloon and gondola in a soybean field.
The flight of the giant helium-tilled balloon
— DaVinci Trans-America — ended abruptly
after it was pelted by rain, snow and ice and
threatened by lightning, said pilot Rudolph
Engelman of Boulder, Colo.
A successful flight had appeared certain for
the DaVince and its four adventurers. It was
only four hours from surpassing the current
endurance record for a helium-filled balloon
of 139 hours, six minutes. It was less than 24
hours from completing the first non-stop
trans-continental balloon flight — the goal the
crew set when lifting off from Tillamook, Ore.,
2500 miles to the west, last Wednesday.
"It was a fluke storm. Completely unex
pected," Engelman said. "We had just outrun
severe squall lines associated with tornadoes
out of Indiana and Illinois."
Just when they were beginning to breathe a
sigh of relief, the crew members were sur
prised by a severe thunderstorm near the
western border of Ohio.
"We were at 14,000 feet, really clipping
alor.g. But the snow and ice added considera
bly to our weight and we didn't have enough
ballast fo compensate for the additional
weight. That's when we had to put down,"
Engelman said.
Chief pilot Vera Simons, of McClean, Va.,
broke a leg during the landing. She underwent

surgery and was reported in fair condition at
St. Rita's Medical Center in nearby Lima.
Engelman, along with Fred Hyde, an eye
surgeon from Prairie Village, Kan., and
NBC-TV cameraman Randy 3irch, suffered
only bruises.
No benefits to BART workers
Sacramento — Employees of the Bay Area
Rapid Transit (BART) District idled by a labor
dispute with the transit system are not eligible
to collect unemployment benefits, state offi
cials said yesterday.
The decision by the Employment Develop
ment Department came as union leaders,
charging a "lockout" by BART, urged BART
employees to report for work tomorrow.
The two unions have claimed they have been
prevented from reporting to work since Aug.
31 when BART officials claim the unions struck
the system in a contract dispute.
"Hopefully, BART management will allow
our people to return to work," said James
Danzy, president of Local 1555, who said
members were urged to report for duty.
BART officia's had no response to the un
ion's legal maneuver.
BART has offered the unions a 21 percent
increase in wages and benefits in a three-year
contract to replace the contract that expired
)une 30.
BART has contended that union demands for
a wage increase based solely on rising cost of
living would add $15 million to its $22 million
package and result in a 50 percent fare in
crease. Fares range from 25 cents to $1.40.
Management employees have worked over
time on train maintenance to ensure enough
will be available on a limited but sustained
basis.
PacTel to fight IRS order
San Francisco — Pacific Telephone (PacTel)
has been ordered by the Internal Revenue Ser
vice to pay the government some $89 million in
back taxes, and the company — the largest in
the Bell System, serving eight million custom
ers — faces $1.28 billion in possible penalties,
PacTel reported Monday.
Arthur Latno Jr., PacTel's executive vice
president, said the ruling contains "the poten
tial for creating havoc," and said the company
will fight the IRS order.

"It would be catastrophic to raise that kind
of money," he said. "There would inevitably
be cutbacks in service or personnel."
He said PacTel "would have to go outside
and borrow the money on the open market,"
and face massive rate increases and employee
layoffs.
PacTel, a $5 billion-a-year operation,
employs 109,000 persons in a massive com
munications network spanning California and
Nevada.
The company has until Dec. 27 to file an
appeal of the IRS penalty assessment, Lafno
