On more than one hundred miles of
shelving, in over twelve acres of
space, the Libraries of Stanford
University house the eighth largest
academic library collection in the

United States. On these shelves are
some 4'/ 2 million volumes, plus
sizable holdings of manuscripts,
maps,, microforms, sound recordings,
and photographs, in addition to
miscellaneous other traditional and
non-traditional library materials.
The following pages offer an over
view of the myriad resources, ser

vices, and facilities of the libraries at
Stanford. A series of printed
brochures, Guides to the Stanford
University Libraries, available in
libraries throughout campus, contain
more details. Staff in the various
libraries are happy to provide further
information as needed or to assist in
locating library materials whether
available here at Stanford elsewhere.
