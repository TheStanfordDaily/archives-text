## Some Facts and Figures 
### 
The complex of libraries at Stanford is divided
administratively between the University Libraries
and the coordinate libraries. The former is ad
ministered through the Provost's Office and
comprises the Cecil H. Green Library, the J. Henry
Meyer Memorial (Undergraduate) Library, ten
research branches (seven of them in the sciences),
and several smaller working branch libraries.
The coordinate libraries—Business, Law,
Medicine, Food Research, Hoover, and SLAC—
report directly to the school or institution of which
they are a part and, like the University Libraries,
are open to all members of the Stanford campus
community.

Together, the University Libraries and the six
coordinate libraries add to their collective resources
at the rate of more than 100,000 volumes annually.
Fifty percent of the combined staff of nearly five
hundred librarians and support staff work in the
Green Library; another eighty or so work in
Meyer and the research branches, while the
remainder are distributed among the coordinate
libraries.
The present Green Library is the third physical
location of the central humanities and social
science collections. Stanford's first library,
numbering 3,000 volumes, was established in 1891
and housed in what is now the President's Office
until 1900. When the Outer Quad was finished
late that year, the Thomas Welton Stanford
Library, as it was then called, which had grown in
the intervening years to 50,000 volumes, moved to
Building 170.
Plans were underway to move the rapidly
growing collections into a new building on the site
of the present Graduate School of Business, when
the Great Earthquake struck on April 18, 1906,
and the building was destroyed. Not until 1919
was the present Green Library building completed
and occupied. Other campus libraries have been
established and housed as needed. Notable events
of this kind include the transfer of the Lane
Medical Library from San Francisco to Stanford in
1959 and the opening of the Mover Library for
undergraduates in 1966.
