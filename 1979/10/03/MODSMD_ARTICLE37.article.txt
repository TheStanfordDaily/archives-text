# Moving Ahead
## 
### 
Some time in early 1980, the (Jreen Library
collections and public service departments will
expand into a new East Wing, now under con
struction, nearly doubling the shelving capacity
and providing growth space for many years to
come. The expanded facility will be able to seat
more than twice as many users as the present
building, in a variety of seating arrangements
carrels, lounge areas, tables, individual studies, and
group study rooms. Typing rooms will be available
on each of the three new stack floors. Com
munication rooms on each floor will contain
courtesy and pay telephones and photocopy
machines, and each has the capacity for future
installation of computer terminals for direct user
access to the libraries' on-line catalog.
New facilities throughout the building will
increase ease of access to the catalogs, the reference
collections, and circulation services. Newspapers
and microtexts will be housed in an attractive and
functional area designed to facilitate use of
materials in these formats. The present Meyer
Basement stack area will be connected to the
Lower Level of the East Wing, thereby creating
one huge stack floor and greatly improving access
to all of the Green Library collections.
Details of these improvements, the move
schedule, and resulting new policies and
procedures will be announced in the Stanford Daily
and Campus Report during the autumn quarter.
