# Managing the Growth of Library Collections
## 
### 
As academic programs at Stanford change and
grow, so too must the Libraries' collections. To
support the teaching and research functions of the
Stanford community, the collections must an

ticipate the needs of scholars present and future
with materials published today and yesterday.
But, many more books are published each year
in the United States alone than any one library
can or should acquire. The task thus becomes one
of planning, building, evaluating and pruning the
collections with the aim of meeting the needs of a
specific primary user group—in our case, the
faculty and students of Stanford University.
More than 30 language and subject area
specialists take part in the Collection Development
Program (CDP) at Stanford. Some work full time
for CDP, with broad language area responsibilities
serving the needs of several academic departments,
for example, Latin American and Iberian, Russian
and Eastern European, Romance, and Germanic
language materials.
Others may spend only 10% to 40% of their
time directly on collection development activities
and the remainder managing a branch library or a
department or division in the Green Library.
Their collection development responsibilities are
generally subject related: English and American
literature, music, physics, chemistry, anthropology,
psychology, etc.
Regardless of the amount of time spent, all staff
with CDP responsibilities are involved in a variety
of collection-related tasks. Assisted by graduate
student bibliographers, they evaluate individual
areas of the collections for quality and utility. They
familiarize themselves with course offerings and
related programs. They respond to faculty and
student requests for individual items not yet in the
collections. All provide reference assistance in their
particular area(s) of expertise, either formally, i.e. at
a reference desk, or informally, in their offices or
elsewhere.
A complete list of CDP bibliographers, in
dicating language or subject specialty, office
location, and phone number, is available at library
public service desks.
