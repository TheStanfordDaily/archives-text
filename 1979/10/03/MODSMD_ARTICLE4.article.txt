# Pontiff visits UN, Harlem
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Pope John Paul II
took his traveling ministry from the
United Nations to Harlem and the
South Bronx yesterday, speaking to
statesmen and street crowds alike of
the despair of war and poverty.
The pope's day was as diverse as
this crowded city: from the United
Nations, to St. Patrick's, up Adam
Clayton Powell Boulevard under a
darkening sky to black-populated
Harlem, then to the devastation of
the heavily Hispanic South Bronx.
His last duty was celebrating Mass
before 70,000 at Yankee Stadium.
The pontiff's day was touched by
the nation's violent side, too. Acting
after the FBI received a letter saying
the pope's life was in danger, police
raided-a house in Elizabeth, N.J., and
found a semi-automatic weapon and
ammunition.
At the United Nations, the pope
gave his cautious backing to the SALT
II treaty, but criticized the world's
superpowers for resisting "concrete
proposals for real disarmament" by

building up their arsenals.
World peace stressed
In the most comprehensive
speech on international affairs of his
year-old papacy, delivered to a
packed U.N. General Assembly, the
pontiff stressed that world peace
could only be achieved through the
enforcement of a vast array of human
rights.
The pope spoke for an hour and
received a I'/i-minute standing ova
tion from the delegates. He referred
several times to the devastation of
war and said near the end of his
speech: "Are the childien to receive
the arms race from us as a necessary
inheritance? How are we to explain
this unbridled race?"
The pope also pleaded for a step
beyond arms reduction — "an
energetic effort to do away with the
very possibility of provoking war."
Prayed for poor
AtSt. Patrick's Cathedral he prayed
for the poor and suffering, and in
poverty-stricken Harlem he urged
his mostly black audience to be
"messengers of hope."
"In a special way my heart is with
the poor, with those who suffer, with
those who are alone in the midst of
this teaming metropolis," the pontiff
said beneath the soaring, vaulted
ceilings of St. Patrick's.
The pope also stressed that any
solution to the Middle East problems
must include a just settlement of the
Palestinian question.
Mideast conflict
Tackling the Middle East conflict
for the first time in such explicit

Celebrates mass at Yankee Stadium,

terms, John Paul noted the value of
the Camp David agreements bet
ween Egypt and Israel, but reiterated
Vatican policy that a "general overall
peace in the area . . . cannot fail to
include the consideration and just
settlement of the Palestinian ques
tion."
The only other specific mention of
world conflicts was his voicing of a
hope for the "tranquility, indepen
dence and territorial integrity" of
Lebanon and an allusion to the Vati
can's active role this year in defusing
armed conflict between Argentina
and Chile by mediation between the
two predominately Catholic coun
tries.
At St. Patrick's, at least 10,000
greeted John Paul. Fifth Avenue was
a profusion of waving banners and
handkerchiefs, and balloons of papal
gold and white filled the air. A
policeman helping hold back the
crowds bowed before the pontiff and
kissed his ring.
Clapping, chanting
Along the route to Harlem, the
crowds clapped and chanted the
song "Wade in the Water" as young
blacks on bicycles pedaled along a
parallel service road trying to keep
up with the pope, who stood and
waved in an open-topped limousine.
At St. Charles Borromeo Church in
Harlem, the pontiff was greeted by
Monsignor Emerson Moore, the only
black monsignor in the country. At
St. Patrick's he was met by New
York's Cardinal Terence Cooke,
Bishop Fulton Sheen, and a crowd of
other church-men and worshippers.
