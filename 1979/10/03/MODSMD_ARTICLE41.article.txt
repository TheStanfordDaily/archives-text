# Microtext and Newspaper Room
## 
### 
Located in the basement, at the rear of the
present Green Library building, is the Microtext
and Newspaper Room. At first glance a dusty
hideaway, in reality it contains a wealth of
material, much of it not otherwise available to
scholars. For instance, here the researcher will find
several hundred American and foreign
newspapers, some in original hardcopy, some on
microfilm. Although these newspapers are not
listed in the card catalog, or in SULS, card files are
maintained at both the Current Periodicals Desk
and in the Microtext and Newspaper Room. These
files provide a record of each newspaper by title
and city of origin and indicate which issues the
library has received.
Indexes for a number of newspapers, including
the Neu York Times, may be found in the General
Reference Room. The Library Guide, Hon to Find
a Newspaper Article, includes a list of available
newspaper indexes, along with some general
information on the scope and use of each.
Also located in the Microtext and Newspaper
Room is a wide variety of published and un

published research material—books, pamphlets,
theses, government documents, technical reports,
working papers, and manuscripts—amounting to
several hundred thousand items in several
microformats (microfilm, microfiche, and
microcard). Dcxuments on film include British
Cabinet Office records and early U.S.
Congressional hearings.
Many of these titles are part of large
micropublishing projects designed to make easily
accessible to scholars a great body of historical
material. Examples from Stanford's holdings are
the Fmtl\ American Imprints 1639-1800, a collection
of SO,OOO separate publications; or the History of
Women collection which, when complete, will
include on microfilm some 12,000 Kxiks, 2,000
pamphlets, HO periodicals and 1,000 selected
photographs.
The individual titles included in most of these
omnibus collections are not listed separately in the
card catalog. A number of printed guides are
available, however, to help users locate items
within these large collections. An annotated list of
the most significant microtext collections in the
Stanford libraries is in preparation. In the
meantime, readers should ask Reference Desk staff
for assistance. They arc knowledgeable about and
happy to help users locate these hidden resources.
