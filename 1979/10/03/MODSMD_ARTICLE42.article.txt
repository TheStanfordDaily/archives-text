# In the Green Library
## Central Circulation 
### 
The Central Circulation Department does a lot
more than check out books. Its staff is responsible
for maintaining and providing access to the main
research collections of the University Libraries.
These collections now number more than V/ 2
million volumes and are presently housed in three
separate physical locations, all designated
'STACK' or 'STK' in the card catalog and in
SULS.

Humanities materials are located in the Green
Library stack, humanities and social sciences in the
Meyer Basement, and some older materials in
auxiliary storage in the Outer Quad. Loan Desk
staff members will be glad to help readers deter
mine in which of the three locations the material
they are kxiking for is housed and arrange to have
it paged if necessary.
Stack access in the Green Library and Meyer
Basement is limited to Stanford faculty, staff,
students, and Stanford affiliates, who will be asked
to show an ID at the stack entrance. Study carrels
are available on a quarter-to-quarter basis in both
locations. Faculty and graduate students should
apply to the appropriate stack supervisor at the
beginning of each quarter.
In addition to checking books in and out, Loan
Desk staff handle overdues, recall materials needed
for other readers, search for items not found where
they belong on the shelves, and provide a review
and appeals service involving the assessment of
library fines and information on borrowing
regulations. The Green Library Loan Desk is also
the place to pick up material which has been
borrowed through Interlibrary Loan or through
UC-Berkeley's BAKER service.
At the Privileges Desk in the rotunda on the
second floor of the Green Library, staff regularly
handle all kinds of questions and problems about
library provileges campus-wide, the UCB/Stanford
Research Library Cooperative Program, and fees
and bills for overdue or lost materials. They issue
library cards as necessary, accept applications for
the Cooperative Program, take reservations from
eligible riders for the Gutenberg Express, and
answer questions about library hours, locations,
and regulations.
The busy stack staff provide the "grease" that
makes the library operate smoothly. They reshelve
the hundreds of books returned to the library each
day, organize the shelves so that books are in their
proper locations when needed, and page books
from the shelves for the handicapped or those
without stack access privileges.

"Topographic maps of the Malay Peninsula...an
ethno-linguistic map of the USSR, a street map of
Chicago; maps...of old mining sites in California
...information about satellite mapping—these
are but a few of the many useful items to be
found in the Central Map Collection..."
