California, population distribution in Kenya, or

by road between Paris and Toulouse—these are hut
a few of the many useful items to be found in the

Sciences Library, which contains a large collection
of geological maps or the Physics Library where
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky Atlas,
are housed.
Hours for the Central Map Collection are
