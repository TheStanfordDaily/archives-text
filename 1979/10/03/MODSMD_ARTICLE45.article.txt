Question: What do a list of plants "native" to
California, the text of the SALT II treaty, a picture
of the moon's surface, gas mileage ratings for
American and foreign cars, and a recipe for
cabbage rolls have in common?
Answer: All are found in government
documents.
Documents provide primary sources for
research, a better understanding of the events
behind today's headlines, and information
essential to being an informed consumer, voter, or
citizen.
Located on the first floor of the Green Library,
the Government Documents Department houses
about 250,000 government publications, or
roughly half of Stanford's total documents
holdings. In the Department proper, users will find
the depository collections of U.S. Federal,
California State, and LJnited Nations publications;
exceptional holdings of British Parliamentary
papers; and selected documents from international
agencies and from U.S. state and local govern
ments. The reference collection is particularly
strong in statistical materials and should be
regarded as the place to begin whenever statistics
are needed.
Many documents are also acquired by the
Department and listed in its card catalog, but
shelved in other locations. These include the
publications of foreign governments as well as
documents from local, national, or international
agencies germane to the subject collections of
branch libraries.
Most documents are listed neither in the main
catalog nor in SULS, but only in the
in the Dcxuments Department. Records are
maintained there for all government documents in
the University Libraries, including those in the
Green Library stack and the branch libraries, but
excluding those in the Coordinate Libraries.
Documents reference staff are available during
all hours the Department is open to provide able
assistance in finding documents information.
Further information about Government
Dcxuments is available in the Library Guide: Hou

staff of the department.
