Too often viewed only as treasures to he ap
preciated from afar rather than used, the many
materials housed in the Department of Special
Collections are an important resource for all
members of the Stanford community.
Special collections materials do not circulate,
hut may he used in the Bender Room, on the top
floor front of the Green Library.
Of interest not only to Stanford hut also to
scholars at large are the Charlotte Ashley Felton
Collection of 19th and 20th century English and
American literature, the Morgan A. and Aline D.
Gunst Collection on the history of printing and
the hook arts, the Memorial Library of Music, the
Frederick E. Brasch Collection on Sir Isaac
Newton and the History of Scientific Thought, the
Theater Collection (containing books as well as
theater ephemera) and the Stanford Collection of
German, Swiss, and Austrian Culture. The
general Rare Book Collection contains rare, old,
fragile, and valuable material in all subject areas
except those covered by the "special" collections
just listed.
The Manuscript Division within the Depart
ment collects a variety of unique, original material,
primarily in support of the hook collections.
Present holdings are strong in material on John
Steinbeck and D.H. Lawrence, the Civil War
period and the early 20th century Progressive
Movement in California, among others.
Each year the Department sponsors several
major exhibits in which some portion of its
holdings are displayed. During 1978-79, these
exhibits focused on voyages of discovery in the
Pacific, first editions of fine presses, and the
heritage of Bruce Bliven.
Another activity which may be of interest to
some is the annual Student Book Collecting
Contest sponsored jointly with the Associates of
the Stanford University Libraries. For details,
students should contact the Chief of the
Department, Florian Shasky, who is also happy to
provide information about book collecting in
general to any interested member of the Stanford
community.
