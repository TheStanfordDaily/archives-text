## Data Services I: Computerized Literature Searching 
### 
A computerized literature search can reduce
considerably the time spent on a literature search
for a thesis, term paper, or research project, by
rapidly scanning hundreds of thousands of
citations in one or more data bases. Hie result of
the search will be a printed bibliography, often
with abstracts for each entry, on the topic or topics
chosen.
Files available for searching presently include all
of those which are part of the Lockheed DIALOG
data base. These files cover a wide rapge of subject
fields in humanities, social sciences, and sciences,
and vary from very broad to highly specific in their
coverage. Among the indexes which may be
searched by computer are: BIOSIS Previews, CA
Condensates, Comprehensive Dissertation
Abstracts, ERIC, Historical Abstracts, NTIS,
PAIS International, Psychological Abstracts,
Social Sciences Citation Index, and many more.
New files are added monthly. Among those added
recently are the Magazine Index, Economics
Abstracts International, and the MLA
Bibliography.
Information about computerized literature
searching is available from any librarian on
campus. Interested users will be referred to a
qualified searcher who will discuss the topic, help
to broaden or narrow it if necessary, and then
make an appointment to do the actual search.
Searching is done at a terminal in one of several
libraries on campus and typically lasts about half
an hour.

Betty Hyslop (General Reference Department,
Green Library, 7-1811) coordinates searching in
the humanities and social sciences; Harry Llull
(Math-Computer Science Library, 74672) is the
person to provide information on literature
searching in the sciences. Charges for com
puterized literature searching, which vary with the
file being searched, provide for recovery of
computer connect-time and the cost of off-line
print-out, but not for the time of the information
specialist assigned by the Library to provide the
service. An average search ranges anywhere from
$15 to $50.
