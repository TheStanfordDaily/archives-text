# Data Services II: Social Science Data Files
## 
### 
A wealth of information, also available via
computer, may be found in the vast data files of
the Roper Center and of the Inter-University
Consortium for Political and Social Research. The
Roper Center contains the world's largest
collection of public opinion polls from the U.S.
and over 80 countries in Asia, Africa, South
America, and the Middle East, on topics which
range from presidential popularity to women's
rights to the Vietnam War to socialized medicine.
Included in the Roper files is virtually every
question asked in every Roper or Gallup poll taken
in the United States in the last 40 years. A search
of the files provides not only a list of questions
asked on a specific topic, but also the answers
tabulated by race, sex, geographic location, or
other desired characteristic.
The surveys of the Inter-University Consortium
report on the attitudes and social experiences of
people in the United States, Europe, and a few
other countries. They include studies in disciplines
such as political science, sociology, economics, and
social psychology. The Stanford Data File Directors,
available in any campus library or through
SPIRES, lists which of the Consortium files are at
Stanford. Others may be ordered. Data Services
librarians will provide further information or
assistance on request.
