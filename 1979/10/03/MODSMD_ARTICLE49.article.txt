# Interlibrary Loan
## 
### 
No single university library, even one as large
and comprehensive as Stanford's, can contain in its
collections all of the recorded information needed
by its faculty and graduate students to pursue their
research. National and even international in
terlibrary agreements, long established for the
mutual support of exceptional research needs,
continue to be relied upon to supplement even the
most comprehensive research collections.
Located in Room 200 A on the second flcxir of
the Green Library, the University Libraries' In
terlibrary Loan staff processes requests for needed
material not available on campus. Faculty and
graduate students may submit requests, in person
only, on forms available at most public service
desks. (Students in law, business, and medicine are
encouraged to make ILL requests at their
respective coordinate library.)
Interested users should be aware that most
libraries will not lend certain types of material,
such as rare, fragile, or expensive items; basic
reference or heavily-used books; or genealogical
material, newspapers, periodicals, and many
American dissertations. Many of these non
lendable items are, however, available on
microfilm.
Requests may take from 2 or 3 days to 2 or 3
months to fill, depending on whether the material
is available from another library in the Bay Area
or from somewhere else much farther afield. Some
of these libraries charge a lending fee, which is
borne by the University Libraries. Photo- or
microcopy costs, however, are paid by the
requesting library patron.
All materials borrowed through Interlibrary
Loan must be picked up and returned to the Loan
Desk on the second floor of the Green Library.
