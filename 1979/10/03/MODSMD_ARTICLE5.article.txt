# ASSU projects had losing year

ASSU projects may sound like yet
another outrageous political
scheme, but actually, they are those
vital student amenities such as Sun
day Flicks, meticulously written lec
ture notes and creatively designed
t-shirts. Without them, students
would surely expire of academic
boredom.
Unfortunately, supplying these
niceties is not always a thriving
capitalistic venture. In fact, because
of several ill-fated events, the ASSU
was in the red almost $20,000 last year
on its projects.
"We had two big losers. If not for
them, we would have made $10,000,"
claimed ASSU Financial Manager
Bruce Bendix. He was referring to the
approximately $20,000 and $10,000
lost respectively by the now-defunct
travel service and Special Events last
year.
Thanks to the advent of a highly
competitive market with fare deregu
lation, the formerly popular travel
service folded last winter after incur
ring huge expense "due to market
forces we had no control over,"
Bendix explained. Canceled Christ
mas flights contributed to its ban
kruptcy and subsequent demise.
Whereas the travel service will no
longer haunt ASSU managers, Spe
cial Events (that is, concerts) will con
tinue to function this year.
Special Events capitulated to "poor
choices in shows" last year, accord
ing to Bendix. He blamed a poor En
cina Station series, an Atlanta

Rhythm Section show, which "just
didn't sell like we expected," and
some smaller shows for the disap
pointing fiscal performance.
"The fact that we didn't have a
Frost (Amphitheater) show last year
hurt. That always brings us out of the
red. We're thinking of that early,"
Bendix said.
"This year, we have been much
more intelligent in shows," Bendix
asserted. The loan Baez concert in
August grossed aroung $10,000, and
last Friday's Southside Johnny act
"was a success in student atten
dance."
"I think we will do much better for
next year," he said. "There's a good
chance we might make some
money" on the usually break-even
Special Events, he predicted.
On other fronts, the ever
prominent Flicks lost $2400, mainly
because of the high technical rates
Plant Services demands, Bendix said.
"I think we have a really strong
schedule this year and will be sur
prised if we don't do well."
Linen service suffered from non
returned items and generated a red
ledger entry of $3800, but stricter
measures will be enforced this year.
Lectures notes flourished last year,
accumulating $15,800 in net re
venues, "despite the fact that the
subscription rate ($7 per class) re
mained the same the last two years,"
Bendix said. "We picked some very
good classes and had good notetak
ers."
Economics 1, Biology 1 and Politi
cal Science 174 tallied the highest
numbers of student subscriptions
last spring. Notetakers' salaries were

also increased 15 percent.
T-shirts, selling for an average $5
apiece, netted $214 in profit on the
heels of the strong "Work, Study,
Get Rich" version. The refrigerator,
duplication and Xerox services also
gained marginal amounts.
"I think the travel service is really
what dragged us down," Bendix
summarized. "We have learned from
last year how to make this a more
successful year."
With gross revenues running
around $1 million, ASSU projects
"are a big operation" and are not
easy to direct. Nonetheless, Bendix
acknowledged that "We're trying to
make the ASSU something very at
tractive to student groups, instead of
just seeming like a big hassle."
Innovations include a typing ser
vice to begin adjacent to the Lecture
Notes corner of the ASSU .office
within the next few weeks and a
short-term, high-interest student in
vestment service.
The ASSU is now offering a
three-month, 10 percent interest cer
tificate to student organizations with
a minimum investment of $1000.
Since Treasury bills mandate a
$10,000 minimum, "this way more
people can participate, and we
should help people out," Bendix
explained.
The ASSU just acquired a new IBM
system-22 computer to ease its ac
count management and alleviate ex
cess bureaucratic confusion.
The Recycling Center purchased a
bailer for cardboard and computer
paper, which Bendix said, "will open
up new doors for them."
