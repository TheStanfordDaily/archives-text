FASTBOOK, a service unit of the General
Reference Department, provides library to library
delivery of library materials and photocopy for
faculty, staff, and graduate students. Requests may
be called in, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by
phoning the FASTBOOK coordinating unit in
the Green Library at 7-FAST (7-3278). The
requester need not know if or where the material is
located on campus; FASTBOOK staff will search
to see if Stanford owns it and arrange for its
delivery to the desired location. Requesters are
notified whether or not the item is found, or if it is
found but cannot circulate.
Registered participants in the U.C.
Berkeley/Stanford Research Library Cooperative
Program (see "Sharing Library Resources") may
also request that FASTBOOK search for and
retrieve the item from the Berkeley library
collections if it is unavailable at Stanford.
