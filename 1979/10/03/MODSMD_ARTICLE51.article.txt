# Sharing Library Resources
## 
### 
In addition to providing traditional interlibrary
loan services, Stanford participates in several
specialized cooperative arrangements which
facilitate access and which broaden considerably
the range of research materials available to its
scholars.
The U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research Library
Cooperative Program is a cooperative effort (begun
in 1977 and grant-funded through 1980) which
affects many aspects of both libraries' operations.
One of the Program's principal objectives is to
facilitate bibliographic and physical access to the
collections of each for the faculty, academic staff
and graduate students of both institutions. It also
provides for cooperative decision-making in the
acquisition of expensive and little-used materials.
At present, the Program provides registered
participants with reciprocal borrowing privileges at
the "other" campus, campus-to-campus delivery of
library mterials, intercampus shuttle service and,
through RLIN, immediate access to one another's
bibliographic records. Copies of Berkeley's Serials
Union List, and a joint keyword index to both it
and SULS, are located in library locations
throughout campus. Further information is
available in a brochure entitled "More than the
Library Next D<.x)r"or by calling 7-1491.
In the spring ot 1979, Stanford joined the
Research Libraries Group (RLG) which presently
consists of Yale, Princeton, Columbia, NYU,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Stanford, the New York
Public Libraries and the Universities of Michigan,
lowa, and Pennsylvania.
Resource development and sharing will be an
integral part of the RLG program. Efforts are
currently underway to improve speed of in
terlibrary loans by giving top priority to each
other's requests and utilizing delivery services faster
than the U.S. mail. Also underway is an effort to
develop direct user access to each other's collec
tions. As these programs develop, the Stanford
community will be kept informed through the
Campus Report and the Daily.
