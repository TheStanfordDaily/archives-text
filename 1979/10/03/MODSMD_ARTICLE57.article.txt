# Undergraduate Library Services
## 
### 
The J. Henry Meyer Memorial Library houses ;i
collection of more than 140,000 hooks and
audio/visual materials, selected primarily in
support of the undergraduate curriculum. Also
included are items of general interest and a limited
amount of material for recreational reading and
listening.
Reserves for most undergraduate courses are
kept in Meyer. Loan periods are two hours, or one,
two, or three days, according to the recom
mendation of the professor. Books not on reserve
circulate for one month and may he renewed if not
needed for another borrower.
Meyer does not have a card catalog, nor are its
holdings listed in the card catalog in the Green
Library. Instead, a microfiche catalog is issued
annually, with cumulative monthly supplements.
The fit he and fiche readers are located in Meyer,
Green, and other library locations throughout
campus. Library staff will gladly show readers how
to use the fiche catalog or search RLIN for more
detailed information on Meyer's holdings or orders
of new materials.
Meyer librarians provide a variety of reference
and bibliographic services, including general
reference assistance, term paper advice, tours,
classroom lectures, and bibliographic instruction.
The Library Guide: J. Hcnrs Mcycr Memorial
Lihran provides details on these various services.
Users may also inquire at the Reference Desk on
the second fl(xir.
Meyer has plenty of carrel and lounge seating,
in addition to coin-operated photocopiers and
electric typewriters, and free manual typewriters
and electronic calculators.
FM radio and special audio programs are piped
to "wet" carrels along the perimeter of the three
upper flcxtrs during most of the hours the library is
open. Earphones may be checked out at the A/V
Services Desk or at the Loan Desk on the second
floor.
The Meyer Library welcomes comments from
its users and encourages suggestions for items to
add to the collections. Suggestions and purchase
request blanks are available at the Library's second
floor "Action Bon."
In response to suggestions and comments from
students during the past year, Meyer Library users
will find a major reorganization of collections and
service points this fall. In an effort to provide better
access to Meyer's collections, reference materials,
newspapers and peruxJicals (current and bound),
and 1, 2, and day reserves have been con
solidated on the second flcxir, while the general
collections have been arranged in A-Z call numher
order.
Last but not least, student comments resulted
m a major renovation of Meyer's heating and
air-conditioning systems. This has been almost
completed, and temperatures should improve
markedly this fall.
