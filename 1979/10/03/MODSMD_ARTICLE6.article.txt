# University ups salaries to keep faculty and staff

The University raised faculty and
staff salaries by approximately 2 per
cent in August because "people
were leaving and faculty pay was fal
ling behind," said William Massey,
vice president for business and fi
nance.
Effective Sept. 1, the increases
apply only to employees not part of a
collective bargaining unit such as Un
ited Stanford Employees. The raises
are above and beyond those previ
ously announced for 1970-1980.
Mounting inflation prompted the
administration to adjust the salary
program announced in March, Pro
vost and Vice President Donald Ken
nedy said in a letter to employees
shortly after the recent raises were
made public.
The move was "an idea whose time
has come," he added.

"We all know on a very personal
basis that the current and projected
rate of inflation is distressing. Stan
ford and other employers, to say no
thing of the government's
economists, greatly underestimated
the rise in the cost of living we are
now experiencing," Kennedy said.
Began in spring
His and Massey's staffs first de
veloped the pay increase in spring,
he said. They then conferred with the
other vice presidents.
The vice presidents unanimously
favored the pay increases, Kennedy
added. "We met only to see how
much we could do and exactly how
to do it. We never questioned
whether it should be done," he
stated.
The July proposal to relax federal
wage and price guidelines facilitated
the increases, Massey said.
