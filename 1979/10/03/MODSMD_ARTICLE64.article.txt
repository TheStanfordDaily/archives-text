### 
The recently merged Mathematics and
Computer Sciences Library is located on the
fourth floor of the Sloan Mathematics Center,
Building 380. In addition to a collection of 40,000
monographs and 900 serial titles, the library
contains a large number of technical reports and
other uncataloged material obtained through
exchange agreements with other universities and
research institutions. A computerized keyword
index to these uncataloged materials is located in
the library and may be used to access material from
the report collection. Reference assistance and
information on computerized literature searching is
available from the librarian, Harry Lull (7-4672).
