The Physics Library is located on the third flmr
of the Varian Building, which adjoins the Physics
(Tank) Lecture Hall. The collection includes more
than 30,000 volumes of books and journals
covering theoretical and applied physics,
astronomy, astrophysics and meteorology. Current
subscriptions to journals and serials number about
500.
The library cooperates closely with the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Library, particularly in
the use of technical reports and preprints, and with
the Hefifner Memorial Library of Microwave
Physics. The Hefifner Library, located in the
Ginzton Laboratory building, is a small working
branch collection of approximately 5,000 volumes,
most of which are duplicated in the Physics
Library.
For reference assistance or further information
about the Physics Library, patrons should contact
the librarian, Virginia Kosanovic (7-4M2).
