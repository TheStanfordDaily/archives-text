### 
Not all of the technical report* owned
by Stanford are listed in the main card
catalog. Some are, hut references may
also he found in SULS, the Govern
ment Documents Department, and
appropriate branch and ccxirdinate
libraries. Each library maintains a record
of the cataloged and uncataloged
technical reports it receives.
Much important information tends to
he huried in the large number of
technical reports which are included in
the collections of many of the science
hranches on campus. A technical report
may be a scientific paper, article, or
translation, often issued as part of a
series. Because of their large numbers,
they are often not cataloged or are
cataloged by series title only.
Among the branch libraries on
campus which collect technical reports in
specific subjects are the Engineering
Department, the Government
Documents Department, Branner Earth
Sciences Library, the Heffner Memorial
Lihrary, the Jackson Library of Business,
the Mathematical Sciences Library, the
Physics Library, and the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Library. Each of these
libraries collects technical reports which
relate directly to the subject specialty of
that library. Users of technical reports
may wish to consult the Directors of
Technical Reports at Stanford which lists
the major technical report series and
collections currently received at Stan
ford. Copies are available at the
Reference Desk and in appropriate
branch and coordinate libraries.
