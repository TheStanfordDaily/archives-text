# Soviets rebuff Carter speech
## 
### Associated Press 
The Soviet Union
lashed out Tuesday against
President Carter's an
nounced military moves to
offset Soviet troops on
Cuba, charging that
Washington seeks to esca
late "gunboat diplomacy"
in the Caribbean.
Two of America's most in
fluential allies, France and
West Germany, said the
Cuba issue is not so impor
tant that it should be al
lowed to delay ratification
of the SALT II arms limita
tion treaty. Debate over the
troops' presence has de
layed U.S. Senate consider
ation of the SALT agreement
signed by Carter and Soviet
President Leonid I.
Brezhnev in Vienna last
)une.
In the Kremlin's first de
tailed comment on Carter's
Monday night b-roadcast
address, Tass said the Presi
dent and his advisers had
been seeking to exploit "a
myth that they themselves
created" to exacerbate ten
sions and press for bigger
military outlays.
Carter announced in his
speech the temporary sta
tioning of 1500 Marines at
the U.S. base at Guan
tanamo in Cuba and the

creation of a new perma
nent joint task force head
quarters in Key West, Fla.
A Pentagon spokesman
said Tuesday that starting in
mid-October 3500 Marines
and sailors aboard four am
phibious ships will stage
special exercises at Guan
' tanamo for about four
weeks. He said 10 light
bombers would participate.
Tass, in a dispatch from
Washington, said the con
troversy over the reported
presence of Soviet troops in
Cuba had been whipped up
into a "noisy propagandistic
campaign."
In his speech, Carter told
the American public that the
Soviet Union had refused to
remove the troops from
Cuba, but he said the issue
"is certainly no reason for a
return to the Cold War."
He said he had received
"assurances trom the high
est levels ot the Soviet gov
ernment" that the troops
were manning a training
center in Cuba and present
no direct threat to U.S. sec
urity.
However, Carter added,
"we shall not rest on these
Soviet statements alone,"
and described the planned
increase of U.S. military
presence in the Caribbean.
