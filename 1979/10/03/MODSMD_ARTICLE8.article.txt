Geneva, Switzerland (AP) —
The World Council of
Churches' controversial Spe
cial Fund to Combat Racism
awarded $349,000 this year, in
cluding grants to two Califor
nia groups that wprk for
Chicano rights, it was an
nounced here Tuesday.
Grants totalling $82,500 to
seven organizations that de
fend African immigrant work
ers in France were the largest
of awards made to 33 groups
on five continents.
Set up in 1969 — and often
criticized by member churches
— the special fund is financed
by gifts from churches, groups
and individuals and the gov
ernments of Sweden, Norway
and the Netherlands.
There was widespread op

position last year to an $85,000
grant to black liberation
groups and the Patriotic Front
guerrilia alliance fighting the
government of Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia which the dissidents
call a facade for continued
white minority rule.
Critics pointed out that guer
rillas had been blamed for
massacres of missionaries
there. Church leaders in sev
eral countries said the grant
seemed to be pitting blacks
against blacks. The council's
policy-making central commit
tee, representing 293 Protes
tant and Orthodox denomina
tions totalling about 400 mill
ion Christians around the
globe, later set up restraints
that give members more con
trol.
