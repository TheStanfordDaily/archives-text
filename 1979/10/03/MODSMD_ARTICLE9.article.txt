## Chinese celebrate 30 years of communist rule 
### 
Peking (AP) — The Chinese government in
power entered its fourth decade on Monday
with some words of praise for Mao Tse-tung,
some criticism of him, and a national policy that
owes more to his old adversaries than to him.
On the eve of the 30th anniversary of com
munist rule, 5000 people shared a toast on Sun
day with Mao's successor, Communist Party
Chairman Hua Guofeng (Hua Kuo-feng) in the
Great Hall of the People.
The party leadership at the banquet looked,
with some exceptions, like a roll call of the
Maoist era's victims — old men and women
purged by Mao in the turbulent years since the
1949 revolution.
Reunited, they aim to turn China into a mod
ern nation by the year 2000.
Deng leads
The course they are following, three years
after Mao's death at age 82, was laid down by the
late Premier Chou En-lai and now is led by
Chou's 75-year-old protege, Senior Vice Pre
mier Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-ping).
Through an irony of circumstance — he was a
compromise choice when Deng was in disgrace
— Hua is the nominal chief of the nation of 900
million.
Boosted to power because he could claim to
be Mao's designated successor — "With you in
charge I am at ease," Mao was quoted as saying

— he swiftly made his peace with the Deng
people. Hua arrested the leading Maoists, the
"Gang of Four" headed by Mao's widow, Jiang
Jing (Chiang Ching), and now is at the head of a
program whose goals he approves but whose
methods he once might have resisted.
Purges 'wrong'
The new party line — which heaps compli
ments on the Mao of the early years — was
spelled out Saturday by Chou's old crony and
number-two man in the party, 82-year-old Ye
)iangying (Yeh Chien-ying).
Ye's two-hour speech, heard by 17,000 in the
Great Hall and millions more listening to its
broadcast on radio and television, gave full cre
dit to Mao for his revolutionary achievement but
for the first time said, in effect, that he was
wrong in launching the purges of the 1950s
against the country's "rightists" and wrong
again when he carried out the Cultural Revolu
tion of the 19605.
The leaders' 42-page manifesto put Mao be
hind them and opened the way to a posthumous
rehabilitation of Mao's greatest enemy — the
late chief of state Liu Shao-chi.
The way the wind is blowing was indicated
Sunday, a few hours before the Great Hall re
ception, by an unofficial magazine with a repu
ted tie to official sources, which called for Liu's
rehabilitation.
