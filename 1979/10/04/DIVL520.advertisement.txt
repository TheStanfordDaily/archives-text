Stop treating
your feet like dogs.
Feet are human, too. And therefore have
an inalienable right to a pair of good, comfortable shoes.
Like the one you see below.
It's a Rockport. And it knows how to treat men's
and women's feet with respect.
Take the inside for example. With most shoes, the
inside is just the other side of the outside. We consider that
callous treatment. And so do feet.
So we put a foam cushion insole inside. And a full
leather lining. One that's been specially tanned to make
it soft and comfy.
Some companies think we're foolish to work so hard
to.^
