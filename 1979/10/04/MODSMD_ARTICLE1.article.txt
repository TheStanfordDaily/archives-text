# ASSU to simplify election process
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Policies and procedures for the
upcoming ASSU Senate and tee as
sessments elections have been
simplified to make students take the
elections more seriously, according
to Mike O'Reilly, chairman of the
elections commission.
O'Reilly said yesterday that the
commission has decided that
"slates," groups of senate candi
dates who run together, will this year
be allowed to spend only $50 as a
group on their campaign The same
limit applies to individual senate
candidates.
"We recognize the fact that slates
exist and we're not opposed to them
in any way, O'Reilly said, "but they
should not have an unfair advantage."
This year, too, computerized bal
lots will be used. They can be
counted automatically and
will provide results much faster and
avoid recounts unless absolutely
necessary.
O'Reilly also said that the commis
sion is working on new methods to
tally the votes of students in overseas
campuses more quickly and effec
tively.
Alphabetical
Candidates' names on ASSU ballots
will appear in alphabetical order and
will include the lull preferred name
of all candidates running for the 20
senate seats.
A quorum of last year's senate
members, including Chairman
George Drysdaleand Tom Cart ot the
Counc il ot Presidents, Tuesday night
chose the issues to be included on
the ballot.
Yesterday O'Reilly and the com
mission decided that the referenda
on the mascot issue, ASSU senate
reorganization and lighted tennis
courts will appear on the ballot, as
well as fee assessments lor the Wo
men's Center and the Band. This is
the same ballot line-up the senate
members proposed.
Candidates
Both the election commission and
former members of the senate have
urged women to run tor the senate.
Last year, the one woman who ran
was elected.
The mascot issue will be a choice
between the Critfons, the Trees and
the Cardinals, and will seek "to de
termine what the majority of the
student-body prefers," Cart said.
The ASSU will present the results to
the administration.
Three senate reorganization prop
osals, districting, live petitions and
staggered elections will be pre
sented to the voters. Districting
would divide the senate into 10 un
dergraduatel districts by residence
and into 10 graduate districts by de
partment.
'Live petitions'
"Live petitions" would require
each senator to secure at least 200
signatures on a petition to enter the
senate. The signers could withdraw
their support at any time, and
senators who were left with fewer
than 200 signatures would lose their
seats.
Staggered elections would apply
only to the 10 undergraduate
senators and would provide for
senators' terms to expire at different
times throughout the years.
The senate reorganization mea
sures are not constitutional amend
ments, but rather an indication ot

student opinion on these issues tor
the new senate to work from.
Senate's task
"It is actually the senate's job to
reorganize itself," O'Reilly said.
Before any proposal can go into
eftec t, however, it must be ratitieci as
a constitutional amendment by
a two-thirds student vote.
There is some question whether
the proposal for lighted tennis courts
and the two fee assessments will ap
pear on the graduate ballot as well as
the undergraduate ballot, but the
question ot staggered elections may
not.
Three principles
The three members ot the election
commission, O'Reilly, |oe Kennedy
and Brenda Watson, have set forth
three principles O'Reilly calls
"operating principles tor the elec
tions":
The tirst is the university funda
mental standard" ot conduct which
stresses respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights ol
others.
The second is to try to prevent un
fair advantages in campaign prac
tices.
The last is the collective responsi
blity ot "slates" that members ot the
slate are collectively responsible for
the group's actions.
How to file
All 10 undergraduate and 10
graduate seats are open. Any student
of the University may run, provided
he or she secures 25 signatures on a
nomination petition, available at the
ASSU office until Monday. The dead
line to file petitions of candidacy is
Monday at 4 p.m.
Candidates also must file detailed
financial statements by 4 p.m. Oct.
17, the last day of elections.
The election committee is having
signs printed which will mark the pol
ling places around the campus. To
vote, a student must present a Stan
ford ID card.
