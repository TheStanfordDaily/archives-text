# LAC offers skill improvement
##

Whether suffering from the traumas of
"freshmanitis" and its accompanying uncertain
ties, perplexed by the problems of meeting re
quirements or desperately in need of instruc
tion in effective reading and studying skills, stu
dents here may find aid and comfort in the
Learning Assistance Center (LAC), an organiza
tion which goes beyond ordinary remedial and
emergency help.
Located in Meyer Room 123, LAC offers free
services ranging from academic tutoring and in
dividual peer counseling to workshops on time
management and reading rate improvement.
Additionally, a wide variety of credit courses
are offered covering learning skills, reading
speed and comprehension and training for
prospective tutors and peer counselors.
Once trained, the student counselors earn $4
an hour working with new classes. They meet at
least three times a quarter with each of their
counselees, and also with individuals not enrol
led in classes but who have specific problems.
Appointments are available by signing up in
the LAC office, according to Connie Turner,
full-time secretary for the center.
Director Carrie Walker stressed that each
situation is handled individually, but that the
majority of concentration is given to academic
problems or personal anxieties which might be
impinging upon studying abilities. In instances
where their services are not suitable, LAC refers
individuals to appropriate organizations,
Walker said.
Time management
Louie Almada, a counselor returning for his
second year, explained that he primarily helps

students to manage their time. Weekly
schedules are devised that incorporate studies
with entertainment. In establishing goals, Al
mada maintains that it is often helpful to add the
incentive of a reward system. When Louie was
first working out his own planning problems, he
set Johnnie Carson as the proverbial carrot be
fore him.
By working with each student individually,
counselor and counselee are able to arrive at a
decision on which hours are optimum for study
ing, and which do not work as well.
Further, Almada claims that the one-to-one
contact on a very personal level other than the
usual academic or social is one of the things
which makes the program so rewarding for him..
A psychology major interested in educational
counseling, Almada finds lAC an "invaluable
experience."
Social problems
Less often, LAC counselors are called upon to
help with social problems. Almada said the most
common are freshmen suffering from the shock
of switching from 4.0-student body president
three time varsity letterer-BM/WOC to just one
of the crowd. He said that while obviously less
structure is used in these situations, many of the
same basic principles apply. "The important
thing is for students to decide what they want
and then work toward that goal," emphasized
Almada.
In an effort to maintain full effectiveness, lAC
has systemized a regular evaluation of all coun
selors. Special programs train counselors to aid
students in areas ranging from career decisions
to contraception, including a focus on various
ethnic groups.
