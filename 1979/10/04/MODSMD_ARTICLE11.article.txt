# Dalai Lama visits Berkeley area

Political cartoonist Gary
Trudeau, creator of "Doones
bury," might have called it "a
meeting of the most mellow, of
the most laid-back of the laid
backs."
Last Monday morning ap
proximately 250 people
gathered in front of the Buddh
ist Nyingma Institute in Ber
keley, patiently awaiting the
visit of the Dalai Lama, titular
head of the Buddhist religion.
The Nyingma Institute is not
affiliated with the University of
California, although both
schools share their students.
There are approximately 300
enrolled in any given quarter.
The eclectic group gathered
there to see the 44-year-old
"pontiff" of a religious tradi
tion over 2500 years old. Ac
cording to Buddhist theology,
he is one in a series of fourteen
reincarnations of the first Dalai
Lama of Tibet.
"It's pretty significant that the
head of the Catholic Church is
in Boston today, while the In
carnate Buddha has chosen
Berkeley," said one Univ. of
California student present.
If there is a generalized,
ideological rift between Bos
ton and Berkeley, it was
epitomized by the audience.
Sporting a potpourri of Mao
jackets, hand-made shawls,
and embroidered coats, most
held flowers or incense in
honor of the occasion.
A young woman walked
through the crowd offering

khatoks at a dollar apiece.
Khatoks are gauzy white cere
monial scarves traditionally
presented by Tibetans on a var
iety of occasions.
Though many individuals
carried cameras, there was re
latively light media coverage.
In contrast to the comfortably
dressed crowd, suited officials
of the Nyingma Institute, carry
ing walkie-talkies, watched
from the second-story bal
conies of the sprawling build
ing on Highland Place.
To the melancholy sound of
Tibetan horns called lang wuus
— which may have been re
corded — the Dalai Lama ar
rived more than half an hour
late with a police escort.
"His visit comes at a time
when America is experiencing
spiritual growth and increased
interest in Tibetan Buddhist
teachings," claimed Joe
Lippman, dean of the Institute.
Lippman introduced the Dalai
Lama, saying to the crowd,
"Your being here is our
greatest gift to his Holiness."
The Dalai Lama has captured
the imagination of many
Americans on his extended
visit. Born in Takster, Tibet, in
1935t0a peasant family, hewas
chosen by the Tibetan Buddh
ists to be the 14th Dalai Lama.
The two-year-old had to un
dergo a battery of tests, includ
ing an examination of his body
toensurethat he bo rethe eight
birthmarks the Dalai Lama is
supposed to have.
The term "Dalai Lama"

means "oceans of wisdom," a
title the spiritual leader has
earned by obtaining a docto
rate of Buddhist pholosophy.
Flanked by close-cropped
disciples in maroon robes, the
Dalai Lama spoke partially
through an interpreterand par
tially in his own halting English.
His talk was restricted to
spiritual matters. Some of it
was obsCure, but much ot what
he said paralleled Christian
dogma.
"Though we practice Buddh
ism, we must be careful not to
criticize other religions," he
said. "We must be non
sectarian."
He addressed the approxi
mately one-half million Ameri
can Buddhists saying, "Hatha
yoga is the height of the
Nyingma teachings. The basis
of this is the fundamental, in
nate light-filled mind."
For the devoted, the Dalai
Lama offered hope.
"It is possible in our
philosophy for a person to at
tain Buddha-hood in one
lifetime," he said.
After his short talk, many
took their khatoks to him to be
blessed. In a touching mo
ment, a helmeted, handicap
ped child was brought up the
stairs in the arms ot his parents
to be blessed by the Dalai
Lama.
Some critics have speculated
that his visit is in part designed
to call attention to the domina
tion by the People's Republic
of China of the Dalai Lama's

homeland, Tibet. The moun
tainous country, bordering on
India, China and Nepal, was
first invaded by the Chinese in
1950.
The Dalai Lama, who ruled
six million Tibetans, was exiled
to India in 1959 after the
Chinese put down an uprising
of his countrymen demanding
independence.
The exile to India is ironic in
a historical sense. The Buddh
ists originally were driven from
India by Moslem armies into
the 15,000-foot high Tibetan
eyrie..
Though his secular power is
much diminished, he is still the
principal spokesman tor 260
million Buddhists world-wide.
The Dalai Lama told the press
in San Francisco that his is an
oppressed people, "unhappy
under Chinese domination."
The Buddhist pontiff has ob
served a busy schedule in
California. Last Saturday he
spoke at the San Francisco
Theological Seminary in San
Anseimo. The following day he
lectured at the Oakland Munic
ipal Auditorium to raise funds
for Tibetan monasteries and re
fugee centers in India, where
the Lama now resides.
FHis immediate travel plans
have not been made public.
