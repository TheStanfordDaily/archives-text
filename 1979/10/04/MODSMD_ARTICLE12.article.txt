# 'Aunt Lucie'
## Stern: real Stanford Dinner$ 
### Eleanor Meltzer Pam Mollohan 
WANTED: Person to feed,
entertain, and financially sup
port University students.
HIRED: Mrs. Lucie Stern,
a.k.a. "Aunt Lucie"
Wish it could really happen?
Somebody to help you through
school? Well it did happen.
During the period 1917-1946,
Mrs. Lucie Stern not only fulfil
led the above criteria, but do
nated buildings, equipment,
and money to the University as
well.
In the early 19305, Mrs. Stern
held the first of her celebrated
"Stanford Dinners," during
which she gave invited Univer
sity men a chance to meet their
professors in a relaxed atmos
phere. An even more endear
ing habit (to some), was her
practice of leaving five-dollar
bills under the plates of those
whom she entertained.
Aunt Lucie did not limit her
self to dinners only. The Stan
ford Hospital Ruth Stern Re
search Laboratory, the Faculty
Club, as well as the Law School
owe their existence in part to
money donated by Mrs. Stern.
And of course, Stern
Hall was erected through her
fund which stipulated that dis
crimination on the basis of
race, color, or creed should
not be used against the resi
dents.
Of the six million dollars
which Lucie Stern's estate has

contributed to the University,
much has been in the form of
grants.
Mrs. Stern married Louis
Stern, one of the four nephews
of the founder of Levi Strauss &
Co. After his death, Lucie
moved to Palo Alto where she
was extremely active in com
munity affairs.
When Mrs. Stern died on
lanuary 8, 1946, the money
perpetuated by her estate was
left to the University.
Mrs. Stern is remembered
especially for her sympathetic
attitude towards difficulties
encountered by college stu

dents. Through her financial
backing, the University was
able to improve minor as well
as major facilities. In recogni
tion of her tremendous con
tributions to higher education,
the University made Lucie
Stern an Honorary Fellow. The
Associated Student Body also
awarded her its first certificate
of honorary membership ever.
Today, Aunt Lucie's memory
lives on chiefly through Stern
Hall. What with all the goings
on in Burbank, Dormer, Larkin,
Serra, Twain, and Zapata,
could Lucie be Stern if she
could see her hall now?
