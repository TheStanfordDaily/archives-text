## Apology for ad 
### 
In the past, national advertising inserts
into the Daily have been shipped directly to
our printer, and therefore were not subject
to review by the Daily before publication.
In light of the Dos Equis advertising, this
policy has been changed, effective im
mediately.
Because the Daily feels this advertising is
highly inappropriate and in violation of our
advertising policy, early yesterday Daily
Business Manager Charles Monheim
and I drafted the following letter to the
advertisers advising them of our feelings. It
is reprinted below as an open letter to the
Stanford community.
The Daily apologizes to anyone who was
offended by the advertisement.
We are also reprinting our advertising
policy below, for your information. »

To whom it may concern:
Yesterday, the Daily ran an insert adver
tising Dos Equis beer. The use of two
women in the ad is highly offensive to many
members of the Stanford community. I
would add that the theme of the insert dis
plays an amazing lack of sensitivity, but you
are probably aware of the offensive nature
of the advertising. I can only conclude that
you are pursuing this line in spite of its
being offensive in the belief that there is an
audience that is attracted by this portrayal
of women. It is disturbing both that Dos
Equis finds it necessary to resort to such
tactics and to consider the possibility that
Stanford University students may respond
favorably to it.

The Daily feels the content of your Oc
tober 16 and November 7 ads is also highly
offensive. Thus, the Daily will not publish
this material.
In addition, it is my personal opinion that
this form of advertising is sufficiently dis
tasteful to dissuade me from continuing to
purchase Dos Equis beer. I will encourage
others to do likewise.
