## Chemicals menace Stanford 
### 
The first edition of this fall's
Daily contained a relatively
comprehensive summary of
what life was like around here
during the summer break. It
was generally quiet, peaceful
and serene. Except for one day
in August.
On Aug. 9, a series of explo
sions at the Lockheed Missiles
and Space Co. ignited 377
pounds of lithium and forced
t+>e evacuation of nearby of
fices and homes. The Palo Alto
Veterans Hospital, realizing
that it was in the drift path of a
potentially toxic cloud, closed
all windows and doors and
shut off the ventilation system.

A small brush fire was quickly
extinguished by firefighters
and no injuries were reported.
So much for a quiet summer.
Little attention
The event received front
page exposure in the local
press for several days, but the
story has received little atten
tion since. A Palo Alto City
Council committee received a
promise from the company
that it would discontinue fu
ture testing involving, hazard
ous chemicals. The council re
commended that the damaged
structure be closed perma
nently.

Lockheed, eager to settle the
matter as quietly as possible
and avoid further publicity on a
sensitive project to build pow
erful lithium batteries, will
probably comply. All of which
is about as reassuring as 3000
Russian troops in Cuba.
Dangerous zoning
What the Palo Alto City
Council has forgotten is that
the city's zoning controls, as
outlined in the Comprehen
sive Plan, were designed to
permit only industrial activities
which are "clean and quiet and
do not conflict with any adja
cent residential uses."
The city's zoning map has
Lockheed's Hanover Road
facility located in an area of the
city tfiat is designated
"Research/Office Park." I find
: it hard to believe that testing
with 377 pounds of lithium was
what planning officials had in
mind when this category was
defined.
Residential area
Palo Alto has zoned itself
into a potentially disastrous
situation. The proximity of
; heavily populated residential
: neighborhoods, schools, of
fices and hospitals to these
areas of "Research/Office
Park" and "Light Industrial"
| (the city has no "Heavy Indust
| rial" category) virtually assures
; that further chemical accidents
will pose a serious threat to
: anyone unfortunate enough to
| be in the immediate vicinity.
In all likelihood, wherever
| you are reading this article
now, you are probably well
within the potential drift path
of another chemical e> ilosion
similar to that which occurred
at Lockheed.
Real threat
This situation can no longer
be called an accident waiting to
happen. It has happened and
will happen again unless the
city council and the Palo Alto
Fire Department take steps to
control the use of toxic sub
stances in the Stanford indust
rial community.
Perhaps all of us who live in
this area were quite lucky this
summer. Although burning
lithium is non-toxic, it does not
respond to standard fire retar
dants.
In a recent appearance be
fore the Palo Alto City Council
committee, Fire Chief William
Korff revealed that his depart
ment keeps lists of chemicals
that are used in the Stanford
Industrial Park and inspects the
sites every six months. He as
sured the council that his de
partment has a number of
sources to make sure chemical
fires can be stopped quickly.
Pleasant dreams.
