# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Robert, et al. Indians are people not symbols 
### 
It has been seven years since we suc
ceeded in bringing most of the Stanford
community to the realization that it was
wrong to use us as Stanford's mascot. The
University officially abolished its practice
of using us as mascot and has repeatedly
stated that we will never again be placed in
that position.
Nevertheless, certain people continue
to demand that the University "put us back
in our place.".
This year these people are once again
putting on their football season campaign
to "bring back the Stanford Indian." Foot
ball fans can expect to be offered free red
feathers and find on sale T-shirts, buttons,
stickers, etc. calling for the return of Chief
Lightfoot (alias Prince Lightfoot) and our
return as mascot.
Fans can also expect a number of argu
ments as to why we should be made mas
cots again. The most popular one seems to
be that if we were Stanford's mascot we
could use our position to improve our lot
here. This in spite of the fact that in the .30
years that we were Stanford's mascot the
only improvement we were able to make
in our lot was to get the rest of the Stanford
community to stop thinking of us as their
mascot.

On the other hand, almost all of our
advances have come about since we de
manded equal status with other people in
the Stanford community. Furthermore, if
those people are so eager to help us, why
are they trying to force us to be something
we don't want to be?
Another popular argument is that we
should be the University's mascot so that
students can emulate the courage, poise,
wisdom, nobility, etc. which we sym
bolize. Well, if these people think so
highly of us, wny are they trying to make us
into something which we aren't.
We're people, not symbols. Given the
role that false stereotyping has played and
continues to play in America's annihilation
of our people, we have no desire to prom
ote another stereotype.
A third argument is that a few radical
outside agitators made us force the ad
ministration to change the mascot. To this
we can only answer that no one outside
the University had an influence on us.
If 51 of us (almost the entire native
American community here) do not seem
like enough people to change the mascot
for, you might be interested to know that
Fordham University considered the com
plaints of four Indian students cause
enough to change to another mascot.

Our position is as follows:
1. We, the native American community at
Stanford, do not want to be Stanford
University's mascot.
2. We do not want to be insulted by de
meaning caricatures and stereotyping
images of us as being noble, courage
ous, etc.
3. We do not want our customs and be
liefs demeaned through inappropriate
and inaccurate use by people who do
not understand them.
4. All we want is to be treated like human
beings.
We had hoped that after seven-years we
would have finally overcome this. Obvi
ously we have not. We would like to settle
the issue once and for all, but we cannot
do it without your help. Therefore, we are
asking the following:
1. Don't wear the red feathers (or any
other color feathers) given out at the
games. If you are offered a feather ac
cept it, break in in half, and throw it
away.
2. Don't buy the shirts being sold outsidfe
the stadium that support the return of
Chief Lightfoot.
3. If anyone goes out on the field in a
pseudo-Indian costume, boo him
loudly.
