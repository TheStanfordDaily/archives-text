## Name student, beat system 
### 
Imagine. You are at your P.O. Box, and
suddenly you are waved to by that girl who
lived at the end of the hall in your
freshman dorm. She yells your name and
asks how your summer was. You are trap
ped, eye-contact has already been estab
lished, and your mind is a "tabula rasa."
Welcome, my friend, you are now playing
the Name-Came.
Perhaps the most unrelenting, vicious,
cruel test that we are put through at Stan
ford is the constant picking of our brain in
the Name-Game. The Name-Game, the at
tempt to match familiar faces with unfamil
iar names (I've forgotten the psychological
term for it), is very complex with many
terms and techniques, some of which are:
1. The Long Hello, often used when rid
ing your bike through White Plaza, the
Long Hello is almost always accompanied
by a smile. You generally say it to people
you know. The "helllllo" is an almost in
stant indicator that the person has forgot
ten your name.
2. Lead-Off Question (usually "How
was your summer?!!" during the Fall quar
ter, and "How was your Weekend?!!" at
all other times except dead week). The
Lead-Off Ouestion is usually a very effec
tive technique, especially if you put a lot of
enthusiasm into it.
3. The Nick-Name, almost always used
when you forget the name of a person that
you know fairly well. (Caution: one must
be very careful with this because often the

nickname you have affectionately tagged
someone is not familiar to that person).
Those are just a few of the techniques
and terms used in the Name-Game. Is
there any way we can win in the Name-
Game? How can we avoid whammies? (A
whammy is when you forget a person's
name — for example I pulled a double
whammy last week when I said to Ellen, a
girl in my sophomore dorm who was walk
ing with her new boyfriend, Dick, "Hi
Linda! How is handsome Harry?" She re
plied, "My name is Ellen, Harry and I broke
up last Spring.")
Believe it or not, there are many ways
one can win at the Name-Game, although
may of these styles are impractical. For
example:
1. Remember all of the Frosh books — a
friendof minedidthis thissummer. Hecut
out all 4550 pictures and stuck them on 3x5
flash cards, and then tested himself every
day. He'll be running for ASSU Senate this
fall, and even though I don't want to give
out his name, if some guy shakes your
hand and tells you which high school you
are from, that's probably him.
2. Pretend you are deaf — another
friend of mine is doing this this fall. Al
though he is missing out on a lot of social
activities, he now knows what people re
ally think about him.
3. Blow-Off everyone — when people
say "Helllllllo!" just say, "Hey dude, you
don't remember meand I don't remember

you, so just cool it." This is very effective,
but just see how many people you "know"
at the Frat parties.
As I have said, these are not very feasi
ble. So what can we do? I've come up with
some techniques and styles that I believe
to be effective (although not so effective
after everybody knows what they are):
1. Last Name Fake-Out—This requires a
lot of skill, but.can be very effective when
used correctly. After talking to someone
for a while, look right into his eyes and ask
him, "What is your name?" When he gets
all offensive and says "Dick" or "Harry,"
you get even more offensive and say, "No
dummy, what's your last name?"
2. Introduction Fake-Out — This can
only be used when you are talking to two
or more people. Accidently drop your
pen, and ask them, while you bend down
to pick it up, to introduce themselves.
(Perhaps the most embarrassing moment
in the Name-Game is when you don't
catch what they say and must ask them to
introduce themselves again. First, it looks
really suspicious, and second, it really
messes up your pens.)
As always, however, honesty is still the
best policy. If you forget someone's name,
just ask it politely (it helps if you add a
compliment, for example say, "OOOH,
that is a pretty dress, what was your name
again?"). I hope that these hints will help
you this year. Remember, you can be a
winner in the Name-Game.

for a while, look right into his eyes and ask
him, "What is your name?" When he gets
all offensive and says "Dick" or "Harry,"
you get even more offensive and say, "No
dummy, what's your last name?"
2. Introduction Fake-Out — This can
only be used when you are talking to two
or more people. Accidently drop your
pen, and ask them, while you bend down
to pick it up, to introduce themselves.
(Perhaps the most embarrassing moment
in the Name-Game is when you don't
catch what they say and must ask them to
introduce themselves again. First, it looks
really suspicious, and second, it really
messes up your pens.)
As always, however, honesty is still the
best policy. If you forget someone's name,
just ask it politely (it helps if you add a
compliment, for example say, "OOOH,
that is a pretty dress, what was your name
again?"). I hope that these hints will help
you this year. Remember, you can be a
winner in the Name-Game.

Imagine. You are at your P.O. Box, and
suddenly you are waved to by that girl who
lived at the end of the hall in your
freshman dorm. She yells your name and
asks how your summer was. You are trap
ped, eye-contact has already been estab
lished, and your mind is a "tabula rasa."
Welcome, my friend, you are now playing
the Name-Came.
Perhaps the most unrelenting, vicious,
cruel test that we are put through at Stan
ford is the constant picking of our brain in
the Name-Game. The Name-Game, the at
tempt to match familiar faces with unfamil
iar names (I've forgotten the psychological
term for it), is very complex with many
terms and techniques, some of which are:
1. The Long Hello, often used when rid
ing your bike through White Plaza, the
Long Hello is almost always accompanied
by a smile. You generally say it to people
you know. The "helllllo" is an almost in
stant indicator that the person has forgot
ten your name.
2. Lead-Off Question (usually "How
was your summer?!!" during the Fall quar
ter, and "How was your Weekend?!!" at
all other times except dead week). The
Lead-Off Ouestion is usually a very effec
tive technique, especially if you put a lot of
enthusiasm into it.
3. The Nick-Name, almost always used
when you forget the name of a person that
you know fairly well. (Caution: one must
be very careful with this because often the

nickname you have affectionately tagged
someone is not familiar to that person).
Those are just a few of the techniques
and terms used in the Name-Game. Is
there any way we can win in the Name-
Game? How can we avoid whammies? (A
whammy is when you forget a person's
name — for example I pulled a double
whammy last week when I said to Ellen, a
girl in my sophomore dorm who was walk
ing with her new boyfriend, Dick, "Hi
Linda! How is handsome Harry?" She re
plied, "My name is Ellen, Harry and I broke
up last Spring.")
Believe it or not, there are many ways
one can win at the Name-Game, although
may of these styles are impractical. For
example:
1. Remember all of the Frosh books — a
friendof minedidthis thissummer. Hecut
out all 4550 pictures and stuck them on 3x5
flash cards, and then tested himself every
day. He'll be running for ASSU Senate this
fall, and even though I don't want to give
out his name, if some guy shakes your
hand and tells you which high school you
are from, that's probably him.
2. Pretend you are deaf — another
friend of mine is doing this this fall. Al
though he is missing out on a lot of social
activities, he now knows what people re
ally think about him.
3. Blow-Off everyone — when people
say "Helllllllo!" just say, "Hey dude, you
don't remember meand I don't remember

you, so just cool it." This is very effective,
but just see how many people you "know"
at the Frat parties.
As I have said, these are not very feasi
ble. So what can we do? I've come up with
some techniques and styles that I believe
to be effective (although not so effective
after everybody knows what they are):
1. Last Name Fake-Out—This requires a
lot of skill, but.can be very effective when
used correctly. After talking to someone
for a while, look right into his eyes and ask
him, "What is your name?" When he gets
all offensive and says "Dick" or "Harry,"
you get even more offensive and say, "No
dummy, what's your last name?"
