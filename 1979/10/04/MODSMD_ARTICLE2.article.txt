The world may deteriorate into a
chaos of terrorism, assassinations,
kidnappings and blind revolution,
unless there is a radical change in the
social and political structure, accord
ing to Roy Childs, editor of The Liber
tarian Review.
The only escape will he a move
ment toward treating each individual
"as an end in himself," Childs told an
engineering-economics systems
class here Tuesday.
He railed against statism, the
burgeoning concentration of power
in the hands of government. Thr in
terventionist policies of statism
achieve the opposite of what is in
tended, he said.
The disastrous American attempt
to protect' Indochina from Com
munism is just one example of the
failure of toreign policy interven
tions, he said, adding interven
tionism is undesirable because it re
quires covert operations.
Intervention in the economy is un
justifiable, too, he said. Childs

characterized himselt as a "suppor
ter of a free market,'' and took issue
with any kind of government regula
tion.
Using police pay-offs as an exam
ple, he explained that attempts to
regulate semi-corrupt operations
produce massive corruption in the
very agencies designed to control
abuses.
Childs, a leader ot the Libertarian
Party, said the tree market is "the only
spontaneous social order around." It
doesn't need rulers or planning, he ad
ded.
Rut when he was pressed tor de
tails of how libertarianism could be
instituted, he declined to answer,
saying he "is not an academic."
Childs said, as he drank his wine,
that all people should have the right
to subordinate themselves to a ruler,
no one imposes the ruler on them.
"When political power comes to
dominate all of the social life, politi
cal power becomes the only kind of
power worth having in society," he
said.
The world is presently "a giant
laboratory" where every possible
form of statism "has been tried and
clearly failed." As political power is
used to shape the framework all
people live in, the stakes for that
political power will rise dramatically,
he added.
But if each individual lived as he
chose without resorting to coercion
or violence, the result would be a
"society of peace, prosperity, and
voluntary social order, unencum
bered by the dehumanizing, oppres
sive power," Childs said.
