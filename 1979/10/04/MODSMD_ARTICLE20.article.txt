Nuclear secrecy
Plaudits to the Daily for its
interview with Charles Hansen
on The Progressive H-bomb ar
ticle (Daily, Sept. 28). His con
clusion about the govern
ment's power to suspend the
First Amendment is frighten
ingly real. The Daily is main
taining the reputation it won
when it lost its case against
newspaper searches.

In contrast, the sour-grapes
editorial in the Bay's largest
circulation daily, concluding
that The Progressive was still
wrong, maintains that daily's
reputation toward free speech.
The Washington Post may be
forgiven when it panicked
early in the litigation, calling it
"John Mitcnell'sdream case." I
particularly liked The Progres
sive's reply: "When did the
Post become )ohn Mitchell's

dream newspaper?" '
Regrettably, not many of the
few who will read the article
itself will grasp The Progres
sive's point in printing it: to
give an example of how sec
recy is used by the government
to prevent informed advise and
consent by you and I —and the
Washington Post.
There is a secret o( the
H-bomb: no one can make one
without an A-bomb for a star

ter, and what you need to make
an A-bomb is a nuclear power
plant (as India has shown). The
high-placed officials who tes
tified that The Progressive arti
cle would speed nuclear pro
liferation were more than
hypocritical; approval by some
of them is needed for each pro
fitable export of another power
plant.
