# Improvements, consolidation
## New chapter for libraries 
### Craig Campbell 
Since last spring, the Uni
versity libraries have under
gone a few changes.
The Computer Science
Library was combined with
the Mathematics Library to
keep up with the Universi
ty's changing needs, said
Dale Canelas, associate di
rector for public services of
the University libraries.
Another change involves
the Music Library. Canelas
said that a temporary build
ing has been constructed
behind the Knoll which
nearly doubles the floor
space of the Music Library.
The University decided to
unity the science libraries
last spring when the Com
puter Science Department
moved to its new location in
the Quad and required a
nearby library.
"The Mathematics and
Computer Science Depart
ments utilize many similar
library materials, thus the

combination reduces dupli
cation/' Canelas said.
Library staff
Canelas also explained
that the move allowed for
the formation of a highly
qualified library staff. The
newly formed library is now
in Building 380, in the
northwest corner of the
outer Quad.
The greatest change in
the University libraries,
however, will come with the
completion of Green Lib
rary's new east building,
Canelas said.
While the old Green
building (west) will be main
tained to house Govern
ment Documents, Special
Collections, library man
agement offices and the
Archives, most of the re
search materials and the
remaining departments will
be moved to the new annex.
Green East
"Green East will feature
more seating space, various

specialized rooms, lockers,
and additional enclosed
carrels and studies for
graduate students and fa
culty," Canelas said.
Completion of the new
facility is awaiting delivery
of the bookshelves, but
Canelas believes the main
floorand the lower level will
be opened in )anuary.
Although Green and
Meyer Undergraduate Lib
rary are the major libraries
on campus, the University
has a total of 24 libraries.
Green now houses more
than 1.6 million volumes,
while Meyer contains about
140,000.
Other research branches
of the library system include
the Swain Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering Lib
rary (Old Chemistry Build
ing), the Art Library, the
Branner Earth Sciences Lib
rary (Mitchell Building), the
Cubberly Education Library,
the Engineering Library
(Terman Building), the Fal
coner Biology Library
(Biological Sciences
Center), and the Physics
Library (Varian Building).
Department libraries
There are also a number
of smaller department lib
raries throughout the cam
pus, such as the Classics
Library, the Mendenhall
Communication Library,
the Psychology Library, the
Koble Gym Library, and the
Tanner Memorial Library of
Philosophy.
Many of the department
run libraries are not staffed
full-time.
Coordinate libraries here
include the Hoover Institu
tion, the SLAC Library, the
Lane Medical library, the
Law Library, the Jackson
Business Library, and the
Food Research Library.
These coordinate libraries,
though often containing
highly specialized material,
are open for undergraduate
