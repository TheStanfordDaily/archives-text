Television's introduction in
196-4 in American Samoa drasti
cally changed the attitude and
values of the traditionally
Polynesian society, said Lyle
Nelson, guest speaker at the
Bechtel International Center's
first Tuesday luncheon.
Nelson is Director of the Pro
fessional Journalism Program
here and teaches in the Com
munication Department. He
went to Samoa in 1966 as part of
a team sent by the United Na
tions Development Program
and U.NESCO to evaluate the
success of the media experi
ment begun two years earlier.
Nelson called the project
"neither a complete failure nor
a total success."
It was the first time that tele
vision media had been used in
any developing region ot the
world to upgrade the educa
tional system, Nelson said. "It
was a bold experiment...in
tended to make up for years of
American neglect," he com
mented.
The goals of the project,
however, were unrealistically
high, according to Nelson. He
said that because Samoan ( hil
dren spoke English only at
school, their educational level
could not possibly equal that of
U.S. students.
According to Nelson, the
project did succeed in con
solidating the 56 locally
financfd village schools into 26

government-financed schools,
providing universal education
for ages 6-16, building more
high schools and increasing
per capita expenditure.
In addition, an early child
hood program and community
college have been established.
Nelson said that previously,
elementary school children sat
on mats on stone floors with
only a weather-beaten
chalkboard, chalk, pencils and
a few bits of paper for supplies.
Today, the school buildings are
modern and well-equipped.
The per capita expenditure has
increased from $50 to $600.
Nelson said that according to
standard achievement tests,
Samoan 12th graders are ap
proximately 1 Vi grades further
ahead than 12th graders were
15 years ago. He added that
Samoan SAT scores have been
continually rising, unlike re
cent trends in the United
States.
Nelson said careful examina
tion of four groups of people
revealed that those who were
exposed to television exhibted
a far greater change in social
attitude and behavior than
those who were not.
According to Nelson, the
Samoans who were influenced
by this media became more
competitive, valued success
more, respected family author
ity less and were less inclined
to conform to village tradi
tions.
