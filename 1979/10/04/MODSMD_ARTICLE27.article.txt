# Campus starts to bask in glow
## Solar projects warming up 
### Mike Carrithers 
Despite a growing national
need for alternative energy
sources, solar energy has not
yet been developed or used ex
tensively on campus. Reluc
tance to spend money on a
still-developing technology
and one whose savings take
time to materialize, delay im
plementation of new systems.
"A lot more needs to be
done," Karl Johnson, director
. of the Energy Conservation
Bureau here said.
"Since the costs are so high,
I can understand why someone
would not want to build a sys
tem for personal use. There is
not enough being done, how
ever, in the academic and re
search areas," he continued.
Civil Engineering Prof. Gil
Masters, who teaches a class
on the design of solar systems,
said that development is de
layed because any new project
must first begin with an "indi
vidual effort."
"The process will continue
until it reaches a community
level and finally, a national
one," he added.
The installation of solar sys
tems has reached a community
level at the University. Two row
houses, Columbae and Roth,
and the Food Commissary now
use solar energy for space or
water heating.

At Columbae, a passive solar
heating system supplements a
small electric heater. The pro
ject,completed last fall, was
part of a Human Biology Work
shop. The Housing Office
funded the system, which cost
only $200. According to
Johnson, the savings will be
about $100 a year.
The passive solar system
uses insulating windows and 17
gallon drums filled with water
and painted black to absorb
the heat. The system takes in
heat during the day and then
releases it at night.
Both Roth House and the
Food Commissary use an active
solar system for water heating.
The installation of solar
facilities at Roth House was
part of a SWOPSI (Stanford
Workshop on Political and So
cial Issues) project began in the
winter of 1978. The Housing
Office also provided the $8000
for the SWOPSI project. The
system will save approximately
$200 a year, Johnson said.
A Department of Energy
(DOE) and a University grant
funded the building of the
solar facilities at the Food
Commissary, which were com
pleted last spring. The com
missary uses solar water heat
ing for meat processing.
An active solar system
employs solar collector panels
and pipes with running water.
This combination creates a
"greenhouse effect," heating

the water. Solar-heated water
at the commissary supple
ments a standard water heater.
About 30-50 percent of the hot
water at Roth and the commis
sary is from solar heat.
The major deterrent for private
use of solar energy is its high
initial cost, particularly in ac
tive systems.But, Prof. William
Reynolds, chairman of the
Mechanical Engineering De
partment and the Institute for
Energy Studies (lES), main
tained that "With the tax cre
dits now given, it is economi
cally feasible for solar power to
be competitive for the space
heating of homes and build
ings.
"The only problem is the
longevity of many of the sys
tems. Many solar facilities use
rubber hoses that last a very
short time. If copper pipes are
used, however, like at Roth
House and the Food Commis
sary the system can last as long
as 20 years," he added.
A few solar projects are
being planned for the Univer
sity. The Action Research
Liaison Office (ARLO) is de
veloping passive systems for
future use. The new dorm
planned for construction near
Lagunita will be partially
heated by a passive solar hea
ter.
But Johnson said, "No one is
taking the initiative so far as
solar power is concerned.-We
need larger and better funded
projects " now.


A row of 17-gallon drums sot near the south-facing windows of this second-story room of Columhae
provides solar space heating. Painted black to absorb the sun's heat during the day, the barrels radiate the
stored warmth at night, replacing some of the work formerly done by electric or gas space heaters.


Jointly funded by Department of Energy and University grants, these
solar water heating panels provide the Food Commissary with hot

water used in processing meat. Located across Pampas Lane from the
Credit Union, the project was undertaken last spring.
