# Sisters battle corporation policies

### 
Louisville, Ky. (AP) — There's
one in Russia on a peace mis
sion. Another is a lobbyist in
the Colorado Legislature. Still
another works on an Indian re
servation. And together
they're taking on one of the
largest coal companies in the
South.
Like the Gulf Oil Corp. be
fore it, the Blue Diamond Coal
Co. of Knoxville, Tenn., is find
ing out that the Sisters of
Loretto mean business,
The Sisters of Loretto, an
order of nuns founded 167
years ago in Kentucky, want
the coal company to be more
"socially responsible" in mine
safety, labor relations and pol
lution control. To that end,
they filed suit Sept. 19 at Chan
cery Court in Wilmington,
Del., where Blue Diamond is
chartered.
More than a year ago, the
Sisters quietly began buying
what few shares were available
in the privately-heid company.
But Blue Diamond refused to
list them as stockholders-of
record. It also asked the Sisters
to sign affidavits stating that
they were not participating in a
conspiracy against the com
pany.
High stakes
In the suit, the order and 13
other stock-holding religious

groups and social activists are
seeking to be listed as Blue
Diamond stockholders and to
have the affidavit declared il
legal.
For the Blue Diamond, the
stakes are high. Should the
company lose the suit, there is
a possibility that it would have
to open up its books to public
scrutiny for the first time in its
64-year history.
For the 735 Sisters of Loretto
it's just one more in a long his
tory of battles.
First order
In 1812, three frontier
teachers founded the order in
the middle of Kentucky. It was
the first order without ties to
Europe established in America.
Today they can be found
working as teachers, nurses,
social workers and activists in
more than 20 states.
About 110 of the sisters,
mostly retired, live there sur
rounded by 300 acres of
wooded farmland and 19th
century buildings.
'Need to change'
"Our history has given us a
greater need to change," said
Sister Mary Swain, the order's
finance director. "It's part of
the frontier tradition."
That frontier spirit has also
motivated the order to seek
changes in society.
One of their weapons is
money. The Sisters give all the
money they earn to the order,
which gives them living ex
penses and invests the rest in a
retirement fund.

"We are not speculators, so
the investments have to give a
good return," Sister Swain
explained. "But we also feel
that we have to be socially re
sponsible."
To be socially responsible
means promoting reforms in a
company by introducing re
solutions at annual stockhol
der meetings.
They have used that method
on several companies, but the
most successful effort involved
Gulf Oil Corp. In 1976, they in
troduced a resolution calling
torCulf to stopall political con
tributions to South Korea.
81 shares
After meeting with the sis
ters, Cull agreed to forbid the
contributions.
The order hasn't been able
to use the same method
against Blue Diamond because
the company refuses to regis
ter them as stockholders, even
though they own 81 shares.
Under federal law, corpora
tions with 500 or more regis
tered stockholders must open
their books and policies to
public scrutiny.
Indirect evidence
Blue Diamond, whose stock
is largely .controlled by its
founding family — the Bonny
mans of Knoxville, Tenn. — has
never officially gone over the
500-stockholder limit.
But the sisters and theirallies
believe they have indirect evi
dence to prove differently.
In January 1978, Blue

Diamond sent out a letter to
stockholders offering to buy all
their stock at an 11 percent
premium. The letter noted that
the company had 513 stoc
kholders as of September 1977.
No comment
Ralph Dye, vice president
and corporate secretary, said
he wouldn't comment on the
merits of the nuns' suit.
"I don't know what they
want, except to harass us and
make a nuisance out of them
selves," Dye said in a tele
phone interview.
In a statement issued to
Forbes magazine, Dye accused
the Sisters of Loretto of trying
to punish the company for its
successful resistance to efforts
by the United Mine Workers
union to organize miners at its
lustus mine at Stearns, Ky.
"Our decision to sue didn't
have anything to do with the
union," Sister Swain said.
"Our concern is with the safety
of the miners, but we are not
working with the UMW in any
way."
With more than $75 million
in assets, Blue Diamond is one
of the largest coal producers in
Kentucky, Tennessee and Vir
ginia. Its mines produce more
than two million tons of coal a
year.
It also has one of the worst
safety records in the industry,
with more than 4600 federal
violations since 1970. Twenty
six men were killed at its
Scotia, Ky., mine in two explo
sions in March 1976.

by the United Mine Workers
union to organize miners at its
lustus mine at Stearns, Ky.
"Our decision to sue didn't
have anything to do with the
union," Sister Swain said.
"Our concern is with the safety
of the miners, but we are not
working with the UMW in any
way."
With more than $75 million
in assets, Blue Diamond is one
of the largest coal producers in
Kentucky, Tennessee and Vir
ginia. Its mines produce more
than two million tons of coal a
year.
It also has one of the worst
safety records in the industry,
with more than 4600 federal
violations since 1970. Twenty
six men were killed at its
Scotia, Ky., mine in two explo
sions in March 1976.
Louisville, Ky. (AP) — There's
one in Russia on a peace mis
sion. Another is a lobbyist in
the Colorado Legislature. Still
another works on an Indian re
servation. And together
they're taking on one of the
largest coal companies in the
South.
Like the Gulf Oil Corp. be
fore it, the Blue Diamond Coal
Co. of Knoxville, Tenn., is find
ing out that the Sisters of
Loretto mean business,
The Sisters of Loretto, an
order of nuns founded 167
years ago in Kentucky, want
the coal company to be more
"socially responsible" in mine
safety, labor relations and pol
lution control. To that end,
they filed suit Sept. 19 at Chan
cery Court in Wilmington,
Del., where Blue Diamond is
chartered.
More than a year ago, the
Sisters quietly began buying
what few shares were available
in the privately-heid company.
But Blue Diamond refused to
list them as stockholders-of
record. It also asked the Sisters
to sign affidavits stating that
they were not participating in a
conspiracy against the com
pany.
High stakes
In the suit, the order and 13
other stock-holding religious

groups and social activists are
seeking to be listed as Blue
Diamond stockholders and to
have the affidavit declared il
legal.
For the Blue Diamond, the
stakes are high. Should the
company lose the suit, there is
a possibility that it would have
to open up its books to public
scrutiny for the first time in its
64-year history.
For the 735 Sisters of Loretto
it's just one more in a long his
tory of battles.
First order
In 1812, three frontier
teachers founded the order in
the middle of Kentucky. It was
the first order without ties to
Europe established in America.
Today they can be found
working as teachers, nurses,
social workers and activists in
more than 20 states.
About 110 of the sisters,
mostly retired, live there sur
rounded by 300 acres of
wooded farmland and 19th
century buildings.
'Need to change'
"Our history has given us a
greater need to change," said
Sister Mary Swain, the order's
finance director. "It's part of
the frontier tradition."
That frontier spirit has also
motivated the order to seek
changes in society.
One of their weapons is
money. The Sisters give all the
money they earn to the order,
which gives them living ex
penses and invests the rest in a
retirement fund.

"We are not speculators, so
the investments have to give a
good return," Sister Swain
explained. "But we also feel
that we have to be socially re
sponsible."
To be socially responsible
means promoting reforms in a
company by introducing re
solutions at annual stockhol
der meetings.
They have used that method
on several companies, but the
most successful effort involved
Gulf Oil Corp. In 1976, they in
troduced a resolution calling
torCulf to stopall political con
tributions to South Korea.
81 shares
After meeting with the sis
ters, Cull agreed to forbid the
contributions.
The order hasn't been able
to use the same method
against Blue Diamond because
the company refuses to regis
ter them as stockholders, even
though they own 81 shares.
Under federal law, corpora
tions with 500 or more regis
tered stockholders must open
their books and policies to
public scrutiny.
Indirect evidence
Blue Diamond, whose stock
is largely .controlled by its
founding family — the Bonny
mans of Knoxville, Tenn. — has
never officially gone over the
500-stockholder limit.
But the sisters and theirallies
believe they have indirect evi
dence to prove differently.
In January 1978, Blue

Diamond sent out a letter to
stockholders offering to buy all
their stock at an 11 percent
premium. The letter noted that
the company had 513 stoc
kholders as of September 1977.
No comment
Ralph Dye, vice president
and corporate secretary, said
he wouldn't comment on the
merits of the nuns' suit.
"I don't know what they
want, except to harass us and
make a nuisance out of them
selves," Dye said in a tele
phone interview.
In a statement issued to
Forbes magazine, Dye accused
the Sisters of Loretto of trying
to punish the company for its
successful resistance to efforts
by the United Mine Workers
union to organize miners at its
lustus mine at Stearns, Ky.
