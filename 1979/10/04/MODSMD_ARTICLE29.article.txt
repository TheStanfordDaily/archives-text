# ECC promotes energy awareness

Like many American homes, University
residences use a lot of energy. Leading the
way to living with less energy is the Stan
ford Energy Conservation Center (ECC).
The ECC, located in the basement of
Crothers Hall, strives to cut back on waste
and promote energy awareness in three
major ways: monitoring consumption,
suggesting and implementing changes for
more efficient energy use, and general
educational efforts.
Under Director Karl Johnson and Energy
Programs Coordinator John Eaton, a paid
staff of six students works with volunteers
at everything from installing "low-flow"
showerheads to monitoring electric met
ers.
Every residence is highly dependent on
electricity for its lighting and appliances.
Yet many residents don't think about
where the electricity goes. ECC volunteers
chart weekly meter readings to visually
document how much electricity each resi
dence uses, comparing it with the same
period of the previous year.
The ECC also provides test data for the
average electrical consumption of certain
types of appliances, such as refrigerators.
Recently it tested a two-cubic foot model,
the size found in many dormitory rooms,
and found that it would use $15 worth of
electricity over a nine-month school year.
As the tested refrigerator was a new,
low-amperage model, Karl Johnson said
he believes that a better estimate would be
$25 per refrigerator for a nine-month
school year. With an estimated 800 such
uqits in the residences, refrigerators
would use a total of about $20,000 of elec
tricity this academic year.
The question here, according to
Johnson, is who should pay the electric
bills for such appliances? Not everyone
uses a refrigerator, but the operating cost
is still spread over all residents, as stereOrs
and other appliances.
The ECC monitors natural gas use as well
as electricity in some of the University Row
houses. Computer analysis of the data
furnishes comparisons of each year with a
"base" year.
All monitoring efforts are designed to
promote "energy consciousness," simple
awareness among residents of the fact that
hot showers require energy as much as
going to classes. The ECC's residential

education efforts include short presenta
tions at dorm meetings and slide shows.
Prominent display of energy use charts
and small but important tips on conserva
tion help cut back waste.
John Eaton emphasizes that little efforts
accumulate into big savings over the year.
For example, turning off the lights and
stereo when leaving the room, and using
foam pads on w'aterbeds instead of electric
heaters can save considerable energy.
The ECC does more than talk. Last year
"low-flow" showerheads were installed in

But no matter how much
money is spent on
conservation, how much
energy is saved will be up to
the people who use it.

many bathrooms, reducing the amount of
water in the system by more than half. This
move saved $120,000 in heating, water and
sewage costs, but also brought complaints
from several students. No serious objec
tions were sustained, however.
Installing 130,000 square feet of insula
tion in several residences saved $6500 in
heating costs. Substituting.fluorescent for
incandescent lighting in Roble and Toyon

Halls has stretched each lighting dollar up
to three times as far as before. And there is
more planned for the future.
Originating in electricity conservation
efforts 2Vi years ago in Florence Moore
and Lagunita Halls, the ECC became an
"official" University program in 1977. The
idea came from an Institute for Energy
Studies project entitled "Energy Alterna
tives for Stanford."
Johnson, who has a Master's degree in
Mechanical Engineering/Product Design,
has been involved with the program from
the start. Eaton graduated with a Human
Biology degree last year, and with his con
centration in energy and the environment
has moved in full-time.
Right now the ECC is applying for a $1.2
million low-interest loan from the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban De
velopment, to fund major lighting and
heating changes in the residences. The
University was one of the few area univer
sities to submit a fully-developed applica
tion for the special federal program.
But no matter how much money is spent
on conservation, how much energy is
saved will be up to the people who use it.
As Johnson says, "People make the differ
ence in saving energy, since people use
it."
