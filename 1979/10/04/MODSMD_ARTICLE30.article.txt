# The 						Dish: Radiotelescope serves as runners' mark
## 
### Diane Greening 
What is that strange-looking
piece of hardware on top of
one of the University's scenic
golden hills?
Most students here call it the
Dish, for obvious reasons. But,
the question remains, what is
it, and what is it doing here?
Several students asked cal
led it modern art, and felt that it
was an aesthetic part of the
campus, to be considered with
Mem Chu and the Quad.
To others, it is the goal of
conditioning, to be able to
"run the Dish," while others
have already reached that goal
and find it a reassuring land
mark during their daily long
runs.
The Dish is a 150 foot
radiotelescope, which means
that it can broadcast and re
ceive radio waves. It was built
in the early 50s by the research
offices of the U.S. military for
$4.5 million. It was then part of
an expanding communication
network.
A sign on the Dish says that it
is still owned by the govern
ment, but operated by Stan
ford Research Institute Inter
national (SRI). Bob Leonard of
the Radiophysics Department
at SRI, said that it is standard
for the government to own re
search tools such as the Dish,
and then to allow organiza
tions such as Stanford and SRI
to use them.
University professors and
Ph.D. candidates used the Dish
heavily in its early years. It was
only necessary to submit a
proposal and obtain funding,
which was usually ac
complished by asking an oblig
ing federal government com
mittee.
While professors still may
use the Dish, funding is more
difficult to obtain. The National

Science Foundation's grant last
year was only $2.6 million, and
the University is responsible
for maintenance of the
grounds.
One of the drawbacks of the
Dish is that it is practically use
less as a receiver. Leonard
explained that this is due to the
increasing nearness of the
houses on the hills near the
Dish and the construction of
Route 280. Household
appliances, such as hairdryers
and Mixmasters interfere with
radio reception and create sta
tic. While the hairdryer down
the hall may be a temporary
nuisance on your FM, the sen
sitive Dish "hears" so much
radio noise, it can only pick up
static.
The Dish still functions as a
transmitter, and its last big pro
ject, several years ago was a
Stanford — SRI cooperative ef
fort to transmit messages to the
Pioneer spacecraft. Last year,
the University and SRI worked
together again, using the Dish

to broadcast to the malfunc
tioning Voyager.
What the Dish does is
emit small amounts of radia
tion. There are warning signs
posted around the Dish, but
these are the same as those
around any radio station and
are required by government
regulations. Employees who
work around such transmitters
need no special precautions,
although Leonard did say that
he would not stand directly in
front of the operating Dish.
"There is no risk to the many
runners who are nearby," he
added.
Although the Dish seems to
have lost its purpose as a
radiotelescope, it is a familiar
sight on campus, and the hills
would be empty without it. As
one student remarked, "I'd re
ally be disappointed if they
sold it to China."
Perhaps there is a use for the
Dish, though . . . the Univer
sity could use it as another
candidate for a mascot.

Some call the Dish modern art, some use it as a training goal for runs
in the foothills, and some (a few) have even proposed that the
mechanical monster be adopted as the University mascot.
