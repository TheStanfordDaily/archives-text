# Two anti-nuclear groups plan upcoming strategies
## 
### Justin Roach 
After the anti-nuclear rally at Diablo Canyon
this summer, it seems the anti-nuke issue has
died down again. Or has it? Locally, two anti
nuke groups, CANE and RANE are scheduling
events and planning their strategies for the
months ahead.
RANE (Roses Against Nuclear Energy) is
perhaps the more active of the two campus
groups, planning to actively participate in anti
nucleardemonstrations at the Seabrook nuclear
power plant site in New Hampshire and a de
monstration at Lockheed's Sunnyvale plant.
CANE (Citizens for Alternatives to Nuclear
Energy), a Palo Alto based group, was started
two years ago. It is one of 35 member groups of
the Abalone Alliance, a state-wide anti-nuclear
power organization.
CANE disseminates information regarding
nuclear energy and participates in anti-nuclear
demonstrations when needed.
RANE consists mostly of undergraduate and
graduate students here and performs similar
functions. It is also a member of the Abalone
Alliance.
Seabrook coalition
According to Randy Schutt, an active member
of CANE, four RANE members will join a coali
tion of some 5000 to 10,000 anti-nuclear activists
at the construction site of the Seabrook nuclear
power plant.
"Our (the coalition's) aim is to nonviolently
enter the Seabrook nuclear site and to prevent
construction by staying there," Schutt said. "We
are attempting to pattern this direct action after
successful European nuclear site occupations."
Schutt described events in Whyl, West Ger
many, where the West German government was
forced to shut down a nuclear reactor after
28,000 people occupied the plant site for nine
months.
Trident protest
"The action to be taken at Lockheed on Oct.
28," said RANE member |on Christensen, "will

be a silent, non-violent vigil to protest Loc
kheed's production of the Trident missile." The
next day the demonstrators will use civil dis
obedience to get their ideas across, he said.
"We are going to enter through the workers'
gates," Christensen said, "pass out leaflets and
talk to the workers about the nuclear issue in
general and about the specific issue at the Loc
kheed plant as well. We are also going to at
tempt to talk to the management, he added.
Will be peaceful
"Both demonstrations will be peaceful," he
added. Schutt said that "the idea of non-violent
persuasion is a chosen method that has basically
become a rule among anti-nuke groups.
In the near future RANE also plans to start a
student-faculty outreach on campus through
newsletters and flyers.
According to Christensen, RANE is planning a
nuclear issues teach-in for mid-November
which will be a day-long event held in White
Plaza.
Speakers featured
"There will be numerous speakers expressing
their knowledge and opinions on the nuclear
energy issue and more specifically on such to
pics as nuclear proliferation and alternative
energy sources," he added. "The teach-in will
be geared to educate and enlighten people who
want to know more about the nuclear energy
issue." A forum will be held the same night, he
said.
A nuclear film series, a project independent of
RANE, will begin Oct. 9. )eff Hook, Jeff Kimball
and Cilista Eberle, who worked with RANE be
fore, helped produce the films. As of now the
series will involve eight evenings of two or three
films shown each night, plus guest speakers af
terward. The films will present both pro- and
anti-nuclear positions.
