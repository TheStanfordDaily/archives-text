i It's unfortunate, yet not re-
Jilly surprising, that Apocalypse
Now has arrived, finally,
amidst such an overpowering
I for some) stench of hype,
jften misguided and some
imes just-plain-wrong media
Coverage. Not surprising, be
cause a movie of such stagger
ing' cost and proportions, no
|natter its quality, seems to in
cite such treatment. Unfortu
nate, because the pressure
reated by both the media and
he movie's creator, Francis
loppola, will give many who
>ee Apocalypse Now almost
completely unrealizable ex
lectations, placing the movie
n an impossible position be
ore it even begins.
But finally, the fanfare,
hough overblown, is de
erved. Without much ques
ion, I think, Apocalypse Now
* the best American movie of
(his decade. Whether the gen
eral audience will agree is an
< ipen question. Like the best of
1 torytellers, producer-director
< oppola has structured his
i lovie so that those who see it
(an, have to, add
tneir thoughts, feelings, opin
ions, prejudices and treasured

assumptions to what they are
experiencing. Such a method
places a heavy demand on an
audience and in this television
and advertising-saturated age,
demands of any type are rarely
placed on viewers.
Crazy ambitions
Yet, in addition to all the
artificially-created expecta
tions, the movie engenders
many high hopes. The film is
almost untenably ambitious;
as in Griffith's Intolerance or
Kubrick's 2001, to name only a
few easy examples, there's a
certain madness in wanting to
accomplish so much in a single
movie. And Coppola's rather
pompous pronouncements
that Apocalypse is "about Vie
tnam'' and further, "about
war" have given new dimen
sions to the insanity.
But many of the most
memorable achievements in
movies have featured such
mad leaps into the seemingly
impossible; the greatest
moviemakers always have
gone all the way, always have
reached for everything.
And Coppola has the talent to
justify his ambitions here. With
his complete command of

movie technique and his
proven ability to give funda
mental thematic concepts a
popular cinematic expression,
Coppola's skills are remarka
ble.
Coppola's work in both of
the Godfather films and in The
Conversation ought to be con
vincing enough, but anyone
who questioned Coppola's in
stinctive, dramatic feel for
creating extraordinarily power
ful screen images certainly
should have their doubts
answered by this film. In films
of this scale, Bertolucci and
Kubrick clearly are his only
working peers; perhaps only
Steven Spielberg and Michael
Cimino of the young American
directors have the necessary
genius to someday control film
this fully.
Firefight
The already well-publicized
battle scene, where an entire
Vietnamese village is de
stroyed, is the most obvious
example of how great a techni
cian Coppola is. The contrast
ing of the awesome, thunder
ous power of the oncoming at
tackers with the largely de
fenseless, silent peasants in
the village recalls Eisenstein,
but the staying power, incredi
ble drive and horrible energy
the sequence has is unique.
Vittorio Storaro, the
cinematographer, delivers
Coppola's images with great
skill. Just the proportions and
the length of time involved
here would scare off nearly
every other director.
But even those who will hate
Apocalypse Now, and there
probably will be many, will not
disagree that Coppola is a
technical genius. The target of
criticism surely will be Coppo
la's decisions regarding plot,
character and theme, that is,
his conceptual choices.

Primordial journey
loseph Conrad's classic
novella Heart of Darkness,
published in 1902, provides the
root material for Apocalypse
Now. Coppola employs Con
rad's essential narrative — the
journey up a primeval river that
works both as an adventure
and as a symbolic search for
self-knowledge and catharsis.
But Coppola does not borrow
Conrad's point of view; the
movie's time, place, theme
and, of necessity, major

characters are in various de
grees different from Heart of
Darkness.
Characteristically, Coppola
goes far beyond the scale of
Conrad's novella; his canvas is
mankind itself. This will in
furiate some, but Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intel
ligence in his reworking of
Conrad.
The short introductory scene
is not only a brilliant evocation
of Conrad's "impenetrable
jungle," it keynotes the epic
quality of the movie and hints
at the madness to follow. Cop
pola plays the Doors' "The
End" during this beginning
sequence, producing a float
ing, operatic quality.
Beyond changing the scale
of Conrad's work, the most
important change Coppola has
made is in the narrator/
observer character, named

Capt. Willard here and called
Marlow in the novella. Cop
pola understands that the
value of Willard as a storyteller
declines if we, too, actually can
see the things thai shape Wil
lard's story. Marlow is vital to
Heart of Darkness; as the sole
source of information, the na
ture of his character becomes
very important. In contrast,
Willard serves largely as an ad
junct to the audience's know
ledge here; he is less impor
tant than the action which sur
rounds him.
Early in the production,
Coppola fired Harvey Keitel,
his original choice for Willard,
because Keitel proved to be
too much of an "actor." Keitel
probably would have been
very good as Conrad's storytel
ler Marlow, but expressiveness
is decidedly not demanded of
Coppola's Willard. Martin
Sheen, Keitel's replacement,
plays the observer role with a
simple, understated intensity.
As Sheen portrays him, Willard
wants answers, but he's in
creasingly unsure about the re
levance of his questions.
Nevertheless, his eyes seem
aimed only at the end of the
river.
Col. Kurtz awaits him. An
enigmatic, stellar officer with
an exemplary service record,
Kurtz has taken control of a tri
bal army and moved his inde
pendent operations into Cam
bodia.
Willard, an intelligence of

ticer, is sent to kill Kurtz. Kurtz'
methods, it is explained to an
unbelieving Willard, have be
come "unsound" and he has
become "quite insane."
Hell
Willard's journey towards
Kurtz is a brilliantly rendered
descent into almost literal hell
that just gets larger and more
frightening. Visually, intellec
tually, but most importantly,
emotionally and spiritually,
Coppola's journey explores
the most primal forces working
within madness and terror.
Willard, as he makes his "des
cent," finds himself drawn
both physically and spiritually
closer to Kurtz as the things
around him become more and
more inexplicable and com
pletely unnatural.

Coppola paints a Vietnam of
people trying to escape,
people living in almost sur
realistic fantasy lands, people
attempting in every way not to
deal with the powerful, ugly,
horrifying and, finally, seem
ingly illogical reality surround
ing them.
It is a portrait containing
humor, sensuality and horror
— often, at the same time. Col.
Kilgore (Robert Duvall) surfs
and endlessly talks surfing
even as his helicopter unit ob
literates a village; napalm, he
reports, "smells like victory."
He tells Willard, ruefully, "you
know, this war's going to end
someday." A huge PX
specializes largely in drugs and
entertainment from Playboy
bunnies; at the last American
outpost, a bridge is recon
structed and destroyed daily as
the soldiers either remain

stoned all day or rave endlessly
and beg to be sent away.
Controversy
The closing sequence at
Kurtz' mini-kingdom will be
debated over and over. After
almost poundingly exploiting
your horrible, almost grotes
que fascination with all that has
come before, Coppola now re
laxes the pace.
Marlon Brando's perfor
mance as Kurtz properly domi
nates here — the criticism he
has taken seems very small
minded.
In a way, it's not that as
tonishing that people have
trouble with Brando's acting
here; he plays the role tenu
ously, with spent energy, as if
he'll slip at any time. It's a risky
move for an actor, especially
one like Brando, because it
makes it difficult to maintain
the audience's interest. But the
method Brando uses is abso
lutely necessary; Kurtz has
gained a self-knowledge, a
knowledge of man and war that
is terrifying in its implications.
Brando intelligently plays the
role with the weariness of an
enormously burdened man
who no longer wants to con
tinue.
Kurtz admires the ruthless
clarity of the Viet Cong. He
sees "genius" in their killing
and maiming, done without
judgment, without remorse.

Kurt/ has taken war to its logi
cal extreme — killing for kil
ling's sake, that is, obeying the
primordial rule of the jungle.

Coppola, finally, shares
none of Conrad's limited op
timism about the fate of man.
In Coppola's vision, man,
when stripped to his most
basic nature, lacking "civilized
constraints," finds only evil,
horror and hell.
Unlike Conrad's Marlow,
Willard has only one real
choice of nightmares; the only
catharsis the jungle offers is
the cold, ruthless simplicity of
the brutal, merciless murder of
Kurtz.
In killing Kurtz, Willard ac
cepts the jungle as his master.
But in this world of pure hell
surrounding him, his hoped
for catharsis is a phantom one.
Unlike Marlow, Willard seems
unable to begin any kind of re
generation. Instead, he be
comes Kurtz, and Coppola
makes this very clear — Sheen
even looks like Brando in the
end. In the movie's final mo
ments, Kurtz's dying words,
"the horror, the horror," al
most becomes the nihilistic
death gasp of a badly decayed
race.
Where Conrad's questions
dealt with the power of evil in
man and especially in
"civilized'' man, Coppola
brings you face to face with the
problem of the role of morality
in war. More specifically, the
movie asks if, in a war, an im
posed set of moral standards is
so hypocritical, so despicable,
that it is worthless, and would
be better off "replaced" by the
"uncivilized" rule of the
jungle, just who is "insane"
here, Kurtzorthe"moral"men
who want him dead?
Now, I may be yet another
critic craning my neck or
perhaps twisting myself into
knots trying to discovei some
"meaning" that is not actually
there, but somehow I don't
think so. For if there's anything
to be learned from Conrad's
Heart of Darkness, it is that
Conrad presents us with no
single "moral" or "lesson, " we
are left only with a larger ques
tion.
Coppola's questioning,
while it is different from Con
rad's, is no less important. And
his achievement here is no less
great.
