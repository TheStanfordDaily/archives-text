# Brian's a bore
## 
### 
Let's get one thing straight
before you hand me a briefcase
and pack me off to the Twit
Olympics: Hike Monty Python.
And I realize that Monty
Python's Flying Circus has
been the only consistently
funny thing on television since
the Kennedy-Nixon debates.
But there are limits. If one
and a half to two parts per mill
ion of rodent droppings in our
vegetables is enough to give us
botulism, then one and a half
to two hours of Monty Python
in a dark theater is at least
enough to put us to sleep.
The problem with all the
Python films, up to and includ
ing their latest, Life of Brian, is
that they are no more than ex
tended versions of the TV
show, a series of setups. While
perfunctory attempts are made
to throw in a story line and
some continuity of scene and
costume, the emphasis is still
on individual scenes. And
these scenes, though often
brilliant in themselves, begin
to have a numbing effect. After
an hour of Python humor, one
knows how Malcolm Mac-
Dowell must have felt while
being desensitized in A
Clockwork Orange.
Flying Circus avoids this
problem by replacing plot with
running jokes. And it works —
for 30 minutes minus commer
cials. Life of Brian tries to do
the same thing and ends up,
not quite lame, but with a se
vere case of the cramps.
Life of Brian returns to the
Holy Grail formula, updating

(i.e. playing off of) traditional
myth. The myth in this case is a
well-documented one —
they've gone from La Morte
d'Arthur to the Holy Bible,
K.S.E. — and the film sutlers
accordingly.
The group sticks a little too
closely to the script this time,
which would be fine if it were
their own script; but when
you're retelling the "greatest
story ever told" there are cer
tain things that must happen
before you run the final cre
dits. Life of Brian soon be
comes a very predictable
movie.
In spite of this, it is not, as
claimed, a parody of the
DeMille-Heston biblical epics.
They were too ridiculous to
need, or deserve, parodying
anyway; and, while Charlton
Heston could usually rise
above the dreck, the Pythons
delight in wallowing in it.
All the satire in Life of Brian is
aimed at living targets. The
Pythons score hits on everyone
from God (both the Christian
and |udean varieties) to the
PLO. One of the movie's run
ning gags concerns the various
groups of apostolic terrorists
who battle the imperialistic
Romans — the People's Front
for |udea (PFJ), the Judean
People's Front (]PF), etc. The
joke, like most of the others in
the movie, is too broadly
drawn; one wonders if the
writers (Python themselves, of
course) are trying to say some
thing about the Mid-East situa
tion or if they just thought that

the initials sounded funny.
There are some terribly
funny scenes. The best mo
ment in the movie is the open
ing; three Wise Men burst into
the hovel where Brian has just
been born, genuflect before
the baby, and shower gifts on
his bewildered mother.
They're in the wrong manger,
of course; the right one is a
ross the street.
Mention must be made of
Terry Gilliam's wonderful
animation, which appears (un
fortunately) only under the
opening credits. Surpassing

his own work in The Holy Grail,
Gilliam produces a suitably
tasteless Cot hie-classical
rendition of Brian's fate.
If you're a true Python
zealot, and won't be offended
(or worse — bored) by any
thing they throw at you, then
Life of Brian will pass by tolera
bly quickly. Otherwise, stay at
home and wait for the Messiah
to be sung; Ftandel did this
whole thing before, and a lot
better.

Let's get one thing straight
before you hand me a briefcase
and pack me off to the Twit
Olympics: Hike Monty Python.
And I realize that Monty
Python's Flying Circus has
been the only consistently
funny thing on television since
the Kennedy-Nixon debates.
But there are limits. If one
and a half to two parts per mill
ion of rodent droppings in our
vegetables is enough to give us
botulism, then one and a half
to two hours of Monty Python
in a dark theater is at least
enough to put us to sleep.
The problem with all the
Python films, up to and includ
ing their latest, Life of Brian, is
that they are no more than ex
tended versions of the TV
show, a series of setups. While
perfunctory attempts are made
to throw in a story line and
some continuity of scene and
costume, the emphasis is still
on individual scenes. And
these scenes, though often
brilliant in themselves, begin
to have a numbing effect. After
an hour of Python humor, one
knows how Malcolm Mac-
Dowell must have felt while
being desensitized in A
Clockwork Orange.
Flying Circus avoids this
problem by replacing plot with
running jokes. And it works —
for 30 minutes minus commer
cials. Life of Brian tries to do
the same thing and ends up,
not quite lame, but with a se
vere case of the cramps.
Life of Brian returns to the
Holy Grail formula, updating

(i.e. playing off of) traditional
myth. The myth in this case is a
well-documented one —
they've gone from La Morte
d'Arthur to the Holy Bible,
K.S.E. — and the film sutlers
accordingly.
The group sticks a little too
closely to the script this time,
which would be fine if it were
their own script; but when
you're retelling the "greatest
story ever told" there are cer
tain things that must happen
before you run the final cre
dits. Life of Brian soon be
comes a very predictable
movie.
In spite of this, it is not, as
claimed, a parody of the
DeMille-Heston biblical epics.
They were too ridiculous to
need, or deserve, parodying
anyway; and, while Charlton
Heston could usually rise
above the dreck, the Pythons
delight in wallowing in it.
All the satire in Life of Brian is
aimed at living targets. The
Pythons score hits on everyone
from God (both the Christian
and |udean varieties) to the
PLO. One of the movie's run
ning gags concerns the various
groups of apostolic terrorists
who battle the imperialistic
Romans — the People's Front
for |udea (PFJ), the Judean
People's Front (]PF), etc. The
joke, like most of the others in
the movie, is too broadly
drawn; one wonders if the
writers (Python themselves, of
course) are trying to say some
thing about the Mid-East situa
tion or if they just thought that

the initials sounded funny.
