# ...but Waller's jazz 'Ain't Misbehavin'
## 
### 
The stage, with its small cafe
tables and an old upright
piano, looked like a set from an
old (19305) movie, ready for a
scene played in a nightclub off
a back alley. This scene comes to
life with the voice of Fats Wal
ler, on a tape from an old radio
broadcast, simultaneously in
troducing a recording of his
most popular song and the
new musical revue of his
music, Ain't Misbehavin'.
The atmosphere of an old
nightclub is held throughout
the production, but the notion
that this is a movie set is quit kly
dismissed. The spirit and en
thusiasm that radiates from the
cast to the audience is seldom
found on the silver screen.
Fats Waller (1904-1943), a
magician on the keyboard as
well as a prolifit composer, is

known for his belief that 'you
can't get too much of a good
thing.' FHis carefree spirit and
his enthusiasm for life is em
bodied and embraced by the
cast.
The five performers, Nell
Carter, Andre de Schields, Ar
melia McQueen, Ken Page,
and Charlaine Woodard are
each talented in their own
right, but this is a case where
the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts. This group of
people obviously love to sing
and dance. Together they
seem to be having a great time
performing, making them the
perfect vehicle lor Waller's
music.
From the familiar "Ain't Mis
behavin"' to the humorous
"Your Feet's too Big" ("I hate
you 'cause your feet's too

big!") to the war songs "When
the Nylons Bloom Again" and
"Cash for Your Trash," the
parade of songs spanned the
years from 1929-1943 and de
lighted everyone, devout fan
and novice admirer alike.
Slower songs were sprinkled
amongst the jazzy numbers to
give the audience, as well as
the cast, a chance to catch their
breath.
The fast pace set by the cast,
especially by • Charlaine
Woodard who never stopped
moving, was enhanced by the
crispness of the lighting. The
careful use of the followspots
and special lighting effects en
abled the quick changes of
mood necessary between
numbers without elaborate set
changes.

The greatest credit for the
success of this tribute to Fats
Waller, other than to Waller
himself, goes to Luther Hen
derson, who not only played
the piano and conducted the
band on stage, but also did the
orchestrations and arrange
ments for the show.
Waller once said, "If you
don't know what it (jazz) is,
don't mess with it!" Hender
son certainly displayed his un
derstanding of jazz by main
taining the original flavor of
Waller's music in these new ar
rangements.
Ain't Misbehavin' is currently
playing at the Curran Theatre
in the City with the original
Broadway cast
