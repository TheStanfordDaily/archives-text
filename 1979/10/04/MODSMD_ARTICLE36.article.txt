# Felix overplays his part
## 
### 
The Los Altos Conservatory
Theatre is highly unusual tor a
small community theater in its
second year of operation.
Housed in a converted
warehouse, its facilities are ex
cellent and include a large,
versatile playing area, one
hundred twenty close seats
with good sight lines, and suit
able lighting.
What is even more unusual is
that after ambitiously produc
ing ten shows during its first
year of operation, it is finan
cially solvent. Perhaps it is the
LACT's emphasis on material
acquisitions that is responsible
for the basic deficiencies in its
current production of Neil Si
mon's The Odd Couple.
The Odd Couple is a comedy
about what happens when a
divorced, poker playing slob
named Oscar Madison allows
his friend, Felix Ungar, to move
in with him. Felix is a fastidi
ous, emotionally unstable
hypochondriac Who has driven
his wife to divorce and pro
ceeds to drive Oscar crazy.
Peter C. Paskos is a warm,
human Oscar who struggles to
retain his sanity while being
exposed to Felix's aggravating
idiosyncrasies. He is funny in
an unforced way which nicely
complements the lack Klug
man, Walter Matthau interpre
tations of the role.
William Ftines as Felix, how
ever, is a major disappoint
ment. Hines tries so hard to be
tunny and overacts so badly
that his character is both unbe

lievable and painful to watch.
Particularly disturbing are his
overly large actions and mug
ging to the audience, which are
inappropriate for such an inti
mate theater.
In a play that is basically a
two man show such as The
Odd Couple, it is imperative
that both the leads are strong
and that there exists an in
teresting, caring relationship
between the protagonists. Al
though Paskos as Oscar does a
fine job in developing his
character and relationship, his
efforts are not matched by
Hines as Felix.
The supporting cast of Felix
and Oscar's poker friends
played by Charles Sebert, Har
vey Friedland, James Davis and
Bradford ). Whitmore are un
remarkable and at times lapse
into bouts of line recitations.
Two marvelous exceptions
in the supporting cast are
Riette Burdick and Toni Tomei
as Gwendolyn and Cecily Pi
geon, British sisters who live
upstairs of Felix and Oscar.
Their synchronized reactions
and blatant sexuality are hys
terically funny and prove to be
the high point of the show.
The direction by Doyne Mraz
is inconsistent. While the
technical aspects of the show,
(sets, lighting, blocking) are
good enough, Mraz's control
of his actors is lacking. Periodi
cally throughout the perfor
mance actors break character
qr kill lines by overstating
them.

Neil Simon's characters and
their humorous relationships
are developed through
dialogue which is full on one
line gags. These one-liners
must be understated or else
the characters are seen as try
ing to be funny rather than ac
tually being funny. Mraz evi
dently did not convey this idea
to his cast.
The result of his efforts is a
technically well produced
show about a nonrelationship
that tries very hard to be funny.
Now that the Los Altos Conser
vatory Theatre is equipped and
financially sound it faces the
challenge of developing the
quality of its artistic endeavors.
