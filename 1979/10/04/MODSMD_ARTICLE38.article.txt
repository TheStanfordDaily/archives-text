"To the Looking-Glass world
it was Alice that said,
'I've a sceptre in hand, I've a
<frpwn on my head;
Let the Looking-Glass crea
tures, whatever they be,
Come and dine with the Red
Queen, the White Queen, and
fine!"
— Lewis Carroll, "Through
the Looking Glass and What
Alice Found There"
As in Philippe de Broca's
'/King of Hearts" and the cult
film "Harold and Maude,"
what makes "La Cage aux Fol
les" perversely attractive is that
it reverses the social and ethi
<lat order of middle class soci
ety. What is acceptable be
comes questionable, and it is
thp pillar of society who seems
qua int or odd rather than the
peripheral citizen. Indeed, I
would not be surprised if it at
tains the underground reputa
tion that has kept similar films
qn the university and midnight
show circuit.
"La Cage" is faithful to the
tyriginal play by jean Poiret,
vyfeo helped adapt it for the sc
r£fcn. It is perhaps the best
c'inematic treatment of
homosexuality since Mart
Qrowley's "Boys in the Band"
a t nd the Canadian release,
"Outrageous" (I thought
yyord is Out" uninspired).
The unquestioned stars of
the film are Ugo Tognazzi, por
traying the owner of a gay bar,
and Michel Serrault, his lover
and star of the drag show at the
bar. The owner has a son
whom he has raised because
hfe has a "maternal instinct,"
lor the mother deserted both
of them for her work.

One day the son comes
home and announces to his
father and "auntie" (as he pre
fers to be called) that he in
tends to marry a young woman
he met at school. The lovers,
who have been together for 20
years, are shocked, but not as
much as the bride-to-be's' pa
rents are when they discover
what sort of family is soon to be
their legal kin.
The young woman's father is
the Deputy of Moral and De
cency. The announced mar
riage comes at a bad time, for
the president has just died in
bed with a prostitute. Sub
sequently, the Deputy looks
bad and the members of the
fourth estate are interested in
pillorying and scourging him.
Director Edouard Molinaro
handles the delicate subject
with a tender touch. It is, how
ever, too tender in spots, for
the editing is often loose
where it should be tight. Only
Tognazzi and Serrault's wry,
touching performances carry
the film, particularly in scenes
where there is much action, as
in the night club.
Certain scenes are so poorly
executed that their dramatic
potential is not realized. For in
stance, when the families meet
tor the first time, a huge
crucifix in the background is
cut in half by the top of the
frame. Or when the Deputy is,
ironically, dressed in drag in
order to escape the press
hounds — for so they are por-l
trayed — the repeated close
ups of the heavily-rouged offi
cial and chaotic cutting create a
scene more gruesome than
hilarious. I

The film is successful for two
reasons. Molinaro elicits fine
performances not only from
the principals, but also from
the supporting cast, including
Claire Maurier, Benny Luke,
Remi Laurent, and Carmen
Scarpitta.
It transcends the most
heavy-handed of stereotypes
and achieves a memorable
portrait of human beings with
an interesting, albeit irregular
lifestyle. It is not a defense nor
a proselytizing statement for
homosexuality. Rather, it is an
irreverent, effective plea for
the concept of live and let live.
This surprisingly popular lit
tle film is only one of many
French imports of enduring
quality, including "Why Not?"
("Pourquois Pas!"), a film
about a menage-a-quatre, and
the engaging woman's film,
"Peppermint Soda." Why is it
one can usually depend on the
French cinematistes to depict
human relationships and sexu
ality so honestly?
