# Talking Heads give peculiar pleasure
## 
### 
At the Talking Heads concert last Satur
day night, a red and green rug resembling
what one might find in any family
playroom covered the lightly raised plat
form on which the drumset rested. The
disquieting performance that took place
on and around it, however, often left one
feeling anywhere but at home.
The Talking Heads came to San Francis
co's Fox-Warfield Theater on the heels of
their most recent record, "Fear of Music."
Happily, the group concentrated on music
from that album, mixing with it selections
from their earlier days.
On those records and in concert, the
focal point of the group is lead singer
David Byrne. Gaunt, hollowed, a bit
emaciated, Byrne on stage resembles no
thing more than a survivor of the
Holocaust. He does not perform in the
traditional sense of the word, but rather
maintains an austere aloofness from his
audience. The others in the band do so as
well, seldom moving from their positions,
speaking little with the crowd or with each
other.
This lack of flashy exhibitionism finds its
genesis largely in the strange sense of de
tachment that the Talking Heads bring to
their performance. It is not only the dearth

of rollicking leaps and smokebombs that
evidence this detachment, but also the
mood they communicate of concentrated,
cerebral observation, the feeling that each
has staked out his position on stage as a
"good place to get some thinking done."
Byrne more than anyone contributes to
this feeling of disinterested examination.
One gets the odd feeling that even as he
sings he is listening detachedly to the mul
tiforms of voice that regularly exit via his
own talking head; and as he contacts the
spasmodic energies of his audience he
remains disconnectedly observant, prob
ing and reflecting on that energy and his
relation to it like a man turning an unfamil
iar object over and over in his hands.
This same sort of perspective shapes
their music. "Drugs," which Saturday fea
tured the controlled surge of bass player
Tina Weymouth and the offsetting effects
of an echo electronically added to Byrne's
voice, reports the drug-experience with an
actuary's tongue:
The boys are making a big mess
This makes the girls all start to laugh
The boys are worried, the girls are
shocked.
I'm charged up . . . I'm kinda wooden
I'm barely moving ... I study motion

I study myself ... I fooled myself!
I'm charged up . . . it's pretty intense.
At the same time, a kind of parched
emotion does infuse their work. In "Air,"
as seemingly innocuous an element as the
air becomes the object of fear.
As Byrne makes abundantly clear in
concert, the feelings of fear and recoil ex
pressed in the song are real enough. At the
same time, Byrne's clear-eyed standpoint is
permitted him by his studied reaction to
his own feelings, which turns back around
to the thinking detachment characteristic
of the group.
If the Talking Heads' work is not
thoroughly or easily agreeable, it does
offer its peculiar pleasures. The music is
uniformly crafted and controlled, at inter
vals ominous, grimly machine-like, or, in
"Heaven," almost ethereally melodic.
Even better live than on vinyl, Byrne is a
singer with compelling presence and a
remarkably agile, malleable voice, who
elicits a contagious excitement in his
quirky musings and discoveries. Finally,
both music and performance offer a
stance that is as refreshingly unusual as it is
consistently thoughtful.
