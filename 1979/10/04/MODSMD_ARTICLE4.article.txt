# Fake H-bomb puts bang in lecture
## Hansen recaps atomic controversy 
### Jill Liscom 
"Take a look at iny hydrogen
bomb," said Charles Hansen <asu
ally, as he sauntered in front of a
SWOPSI dass last night tarrying a
bright orange take H-bomb over his
shoulder.
Hansen spoke to about 10 students
in "The Politics of Radiation" c ourse,
recapping the sequence ot events
which have recently brought him na
tional prominence and stirred <on
troversy over atomic and H-bomb
sec recy.
Hansen, a computer programmer
from Mountain View, wrote a letter
to Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.) contain
ing information and a diagram on
how to build a hydrogen bomb.
Although the government tried to
keep this letter from being published
because it supposedly contained
classified and secret information, ex
cerpts of the letter were printed in
Berkeley's student-run Daily Cahtor
nian, Palo Alto's Peninsula Times
Tribune and the Madison, Wis. /'ress
Connection.
According to Hansen, the letter
was not intended to be published,
but was a political statement against
what he saw as inc consistencies in the
application of the l ( Atomic
Energy Act.
Hansen said when Robert Dull,
head of classification for the De
partment ot Energy, called him on
Sept. 12 to say the letter contained
classified, secret material, "I thought
the Department of Energy (DOI i had
finally gotten a sense of humor. But
he wasn't kidding."
Hansen said his letter was based
on information from materials in the
public domain and even "included
some ideas I kicked around with my
wife one morning after breakfast."
As for the diagram, "I drew the
damn thing with bottletops and tuna

cans," Hansen commented. "It's
very simple and I don't think it's all
that accurate," he added.
Public ation ot Hansen's letter fol
lowed a legal battle concerning an
article by Howard Morland, said to
c ontain c lassitied information on the
construction ot the H-bomb.
On March 26, a judicial order had
been issued against Tin.' Progressive,
■l small magazine in Madison, Wis.,

to prevent Morland's article from
being published.
Additional injunctions were later
issued against the Daily Californian
and the Peninsula limes Tribune to
prevent Hansen's article from being
printed. However, while these were
in force, the Madison Press Connec
tion in Madison, Wis., published the
lull text ot Hansen's letter.

"I'm hardly a person one would
ever call at a loss for words," Hansen
said, but when he found out his letter
had been published, "I was speech
less for about half an hour and
knocked completely off my feet."
Hansen said his 18-page letter is
now "in protective custody," which
means "it's c lassitied, but I can go up
and look at it at any time."
The whole experience has been
"very wearing — I've lost five
pounds," said Hansen. "The worst
was when I had to get up at 2:30 a.m.
to be in San I rancisco at 4:15 a.m. to
be on the David Hartmann show
(Cood Morning, America),"he ad
ded.
Although Hansen said "things are
quieting down now," he still has sev
eral questions about the DOL's clas
sitication system and policies which
have yet to be answered.
Also, Hansen said he hopes to see
some changes made in the Atomic
Energy Ac t. I or example, he said the
"born secret" policy, which means
all information about nuclear energy
is classified from birth, should be
abolished.
Hansen was speaking last night as a
guest lecturer for a course taught by
Peter Faulkner focusing on radiation
and its effects.
