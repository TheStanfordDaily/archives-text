Senate backs energy agency
Washington — The Senate yesterday soundly
defeated two attempts bv environmentalists to
weaken President Jimmy Carter's proposal lor
a powerful new agency to speed construction
ol new energy projects.
By votes ol 59- Ml and Ml-54, the Senate ag
reed to give an I nergy Mobilization Hoard
broad powers to push lor construction ol new
facilities, including synthetic fuel plants and oil
refineries.
Senators c oncerned about the environmen
tal dangers ol such new facilities did win one
major concession which would give the En
vironmental Protection Agency veto power
over some projects.
By a voice vote, the Senate agreed that if
plants are found to be a hazard lo health after
c (instruction begins, the I PA would have au
thority to stop construction. Bui that would
occur onl\ if state or local governments sought
to bloc k construction.
The Interior Department would also have to
certify that the energy project would not be a
danger to wildlife it it were built.
But overall, the president's proposed board
for a tour-member agent y designed to open
bureaucratic bottlenecks survived intact, de
spite an intensive assault from Senate en
vironmentalists and states' rights advocates.

Pope sees Philadelphia
Philadelphia — Pope John Paul 11, welcomed
yesterday to this historic city he had visited in
the 1976 Bicentennial, admonished the largest
American crowd he has seen to follow the
strict moral standards of their past.
The pope had left a rainy New York and
landed here in bright sunshine. A million or
more turned out along Philadelphia's streets
and at Mass in Logan Circle.
The altar at the open air Mass had been the
subject of controversy. A suit aimed al making
the Roman Catholic Church, and not the city,
pay for the $150,000 construction is still unde
cided.
The pontiff spoke of Christian values in re
gard to sex, defending priestly celibacy and
emphasizing that sex was sinful outside mar
riage.
"There can be no true freedom without re
spect tor the truth regarding the nature of
human sexuality and marriage,'' he said, ad
ding that the traditional rules apply to "the
whole of conjugal morality."
Many in the c rowds had waited lor hours tor
the pontiff. He was running about an hour late
when he arrived from New York, where he had
spent much of his day with youth and had been
given blue jeans, a T-shirt and a guitar as gitts.
At New York's Madison Square Garden,
19,000 Catholic young people turned the pon
-1111 into John Paul Superstar by < heering him as
they would a roc k idol.

Brown hits gold purchasers
Beverly Hi lis, Calif. — Scrambling invest
ment in gold is a sign that Americ .ins are bet

ting against the future of their own country,
Gov. jerry Brown said yesterday, urging
people to "reinvest in America."
"People who buy gold and pay interest on
loans to buy it are gambling on the continued
decline of the United States," Brown told the
Hollywood Radio and Television Society at the
Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
He said the current deficit federal budget is
concerned only with "warfare, welfare and in
terest ori the debt."
Sounding like a presidential candidate, the
41-year-qld governor delivered a wide-ranging
speech on economics and repeated his "rein
vest in America" slogan several times. But
Brown, while critical of "the present level and
content of the political dialogue," avoided his
anticipated formal announcement of candi
dacy.
Saudis warn of oil price hikes
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — Saudi Arabia's finance
minister issued a sfern warning yesterday that
unless the decline in the dollar is halted, his
government may take action that could drive
the price of oil up further.
"It would be naive to pretend that a con
tinuous erosion of our financial resources,
through inflation and exchange depreciation,
could not evoke reactions," Finance Minister
Sheikh Mohamed Abalkhail told a meeting
here of the International Monetary Fund and
World Band. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest
oil exporter, is considered a moderate on
pric es, which now average about $2i,50 a bar
rel.
But Abalkhail also said Saudi Arabia is pre
pared to participate in a consumer-producer
dialogue on oil prices and supply, which is
something the United States has long wanted.
Saudi Arabia has said in the past it would sit
down to discuss oil prices and supplies if other
issued of importance to underdeveloped
countries also were dealt with. Abalkhail did
say in his speech that the "transfer of technol
ogy" should be included in any sue h dialogue.
