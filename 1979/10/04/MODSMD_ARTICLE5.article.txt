Editor's Note: The remnants of

Shivering with malaria and weak
from hunger, tens of thousands of
Pol Pot Cambodians appear to be fac
ing defeat as the monsoon rains re
cede and Vietnamese forces advance
in western Cambodia.
A glimpse of life in an area still con
trolled hy the toppled regime of
Premier Poi Pot and talks with the
recent refugees reveal hunger, dis
ease, savagery and iron discipline
even as the movement may be pre
paring its last stand. It makes no con
cessions to those under its control.
Freedom promise broken
This goes on despite a recent Pol
Pot declaration promising many
freedoms to those who join a united
front against the Vietnamese and the
Hanoi-backed government in Phnom
Penh.
The present Heng Samrin's regime
was established after invading Viet
namese and dissident Cambodians
took over the capital last Jan. 7 and
drove out Pol Pot and his forces.
Crossing the Thai border this week
into a Pol Pot camp, reporters found
a "hospital" for female soldiers filled
with young girls suffering from
malaria. They said two or three in
their camp died of the disease each
day.
No food, medicine
There was no medicine in sight,
water was drunk right from a muddy
stream, and the only food was thin
soup and shreds of vegetables.
Men and women in tattered black
clothes and traditional checkered
scares moved silently about their
tasks. A tew young soldiers armed
with AK-47 rilles looked at the visitors
sullenly on tirst encounter.
They explained everything in
terms of "angka" — "organization
on high" — the shadowy Pol Pot
leadership which ruled the country
tor four years but still remains un
known to the average Cambodian.
Refugees corralled
Farther to the south, along the
Thai-Cambodian border, refugees
who recently fled from Pol Pot control
said large numbers of civilians had
been herded into a jungle area,
sleeping on the rain-soaked ground
and existing chiefly on roots, leaves
and bamboo shoots.
The penalty for attempted escape
was be beaten to death with staves
"in order to save bullets," they saicJ.
"Malaria and starvation have prob
ably killed off more of the Pol Pot
people than the Vietnamese army,"
one Western diplomat said.
