# Barrage of bees bothers boarders

li it's not the morning after and the
buzzing in your ears seems louder
than normal, bo sure and keep your
eyes open; it may be one of the
thousands of bees, hornets, and yel
low jackets that have invaded the
Stanford campus.
Bees and yellow-jackets are espe
cially attracted to food <Â« lors and are
often found when the weather is
warm and dry.
The stingers here congregate at
Tresidder Union, the golf course and
the groves around the football
stadium, among other places.
Hardest hit of the dorms seems to
be Lagunita Court where William
Hunter, a two-year resident of
Naranja said, "We have never had
problems with bees this early in the
year betore. Usually the bees don't
come around until spring.''
The bee problem is no worse than
in previous years, said Bruce Wig
gins, building maintenance opera
tions manager. There are no com
mercial hives on campus, he added,
and it is normal for them to appear
during the warm, dry months of late
spring and early autumn."As soon as
the first cold hits," he said, "they
usually disappear.

Several goiters have been stung on
the University course. Contact rnsec
ticides in the do/en or so bee nests
has "somewhat eradicated" the
problem, said Course Superinten
dent Tom Thatcher. He is satisfied
with the poison's effectiveness, but
"once a nest is open, they may and
often do come back,'' he said.
Many students are so frightened of
the bees and yellow-jackets that they

opt to eat indoors even on nic e days.
I reshman Mike Gulevich
suggested, as he chased a bee out of
his butterscotch pudding, that the
bees were trying to make a state
ment.
I was reading a Daily article on the
mascot issue the other day when a
bee wandered over and stung me on
the elbow. I think he was trying to say
that we should be called the Stan
lord Yellow-jackets'," he said.

One-liners like "at least they don't

eat much" and it they don't eat my
lood, I won't play my stereo in their
hive" are rampant. The jokes quickly
lost their appeal, however, to stu
dents who have been bitten by the
creatures.
Nurse Practitioner Ellen Freihon of
Cowell Health Center said that some
people do have allergic reactions to
bee stings. These reactions are
characterized by difficulty in brea
thing and swallowing and usually
show up within 15 minutes of the
sting.

"If this reaction occurs, the person
should immediately contact a doc
tor," said Freihon.
Others, who only experience the
"normal" discomforts associated
with bee stings, should not he as
alarmed. Freihon suggested the
stinger be extracted, the stung area
elevated, and meat tenderizer and
ice applied to relieve the pain.
Freihon discounted rumors that
applications of baking soda paste or
tobacco soothe the pain of the bee
stings.


The threat is not equal to that of thrillers such as "The Killer
Bees" or "Swarm," but the insects are making their pre-
