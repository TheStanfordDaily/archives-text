# Teller and Panofsky debate SALT II
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
The Strategic Arms Limita
tion Treaty (SALT II) debate
is coming to campus on Fri
day at 8 pm in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium in the form of a
debate, moderated by Ale
xander Dallin, professor of
History and Political Science
here. The issue will be de
bated between one of its
leading opponents Edward
Teller, and proponents,
Wolfgang Panofsky.
Both participants are
physicists of the highest sta
ture, both have been ad
visors to the president on
arms control, both were
political refugees from their
countries and yet are
diametrically opposed on
the SALT issue.
History
The SALT process was in
itiated in talks between

former President Lyndon
Johnson and Premier Alexei
Kosygin in 1967 and has con
tinued under three ad
ministrations of both par
ties.
The first treaty, SALT I,
was signed in 1972. It re
stricted the deployment of
antiballistic missile systems
by both U.S. and USSR to
very low levels.
The new SALT II treaty
places an overall limit on the
offensive strategic forces of
both countries, replacing
the Interim Agreement
which has expired with a
long-term one.
As SALT II nears a vote on
ratification, debate inten
sifies. There are currently
30,000 nuclear weapons in
the world of which over 99
percent are in the United
States and the Soviet Union,
and most have a destructive
capability that greatly ex
ceeds those of the
Hiroshima weapon that kil
led about 100,000 in 1945.
Some of the questions
that must be answered in
clude:
— Will the treaty make a
difference in the arms race?
— Is SALT a sellout to the
USSR? Will the Russians
have strategic superiority?
— Should SALT ratifica
tion be used as a lever
against Soviet expansionism
in Africa and elsewhere?
As Teller told a Playboy in
terviewer recently, he is
concerned that the treaty
will leave the Russians with
a serious superiority in nuc
lear weapons.

With this Panofsky disag
rees, charging that spokes
men in the United States
have engaged in "negative
salesmanship" in respect to
military strength to influ
ence domestic opinion and
increase military spending.

The new SALT II
treaty places an
overall limit on the
offensive strategic
forces of both
countries, replacing
the Interim
Agreement which
has expired. ...

Nuclear war
Panofsky believes that
nuclear weapons are so de
structive in nature that they
cannot be used rationally.
"Once nuclear war
starts," said Panofsky in a
recent Daily interview,
"prediction of outcomes
becomes extremely uncer
tain and its consequences
depend on so many factors
that are not quantifiable in
terms of throw weight or
megatons.
"Nuclear weapons are
viewed more as abstract ob
jects of discussion rather
than horrendous objects of
physical power," Panofsky
continued.

While for Panofsky nuc
lear war seems unthinkable,
for Teller "War is not un
thinkable, but to think
about it is very disagree
able. Yet the only way to
avoid it is to think about it."
Teller argues in the )une
issue of Physics Today that
the treaty "will constitute a
signal to the American
people that they need not
worry — all's right with the
world."
However terrible nuclear
war may be, Teller argues,
the Russians can win it. The
notion of "overkill," of hav
ing enough arms to blow
the other side up with some
to spare, does not have
much meaning for Teller.
The Russians have, ac
cording to him, a civil de
fense system so that they
would lose only 5 percent of
the population versus 50
percent in the United
States.
Arms research
According to Teller,
another advantage that the
Russians have over the Un
ited States is the willingness
of top scientists to engage in
arms research. World War II
was preceded by a race in
disarmament that the West
ern democracies won. Tel
ler believes that we are in a
similar situation today.
Background
Teller was born in 1908 in
Hungary, and because of his
aptitude in mathematics
went on to study theoretical
physics in Leipzig. He fled

to the United States as
World War II approached,
and played an important
part in the country's race to
develop the A-bomb at Los
Alamos.
After the war Teller
pushed for the develop
ment of the hydrogen bomb
and won governmental
support when the USSR
tested its own nuclear
weapons. In 1951 the United
States tested the first ther
monuclear weapon. It re
mains the most powerful
weapon ever devised.
Teller is a controversial fi
gure. His life was
threatened by Berkeley stu
dents in the sixties. Teller
has unpopular stands,
especially on campuses. He
believes that nuclear energy
is safe and supports arms
expenditures.

Panofsky was born in Ber
lin and received his educa
tion here in the United
States, first at Princeton and
then at California Institute
of Technology.
During the 1940s and 50s,
Panofsky's chief contribu
tions came from a series of
experiments in which the
fundamental nature of the
pi-meson was uncovered.
Panofsky became director
of the High Energy Physics
Laboratory at the University
in 1953 and was instrumen
tal in the development of
the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center. In 1961 he
became its director.
Panofsky has been an ac
tive spokesman for disar
mament and worked on the
Limited Test Ban Treaty that
curbed atmospheric tests of
nuclear weapons.
