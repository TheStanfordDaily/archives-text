# Justice for the deaf
## Legal system ignores special needs 
### Associated Press 
The police picked up the teenage boy on
an assault complaint.
By the time they got him to the station
house, the cops were pretty sure the kid
was in cuckoo land. Loony. Out of it. What
else could it be?
When they picked him up, he didn't
pester them with the usual jive protests.
When they read him his rights, the kid
didn't ask a single question, didn't make a
single demand.
He just waved his arms and shook his
head. The kid acted crazy.
But Jay Block, who was then a clerk for
the Baltimore public defender, wasn't so
sure. Something about the youth touched
a buried memory.
"I don't know why, but I signed to him.
He jumped up and came running over to
me, so happy and relieved," Block recalls.
The youngster was deaf — "profoundly
hearing impaired" in the current idiom —
and Block, who's learned a bit of sign
language from a deaf cousin, had spoken
to him.

It turns out the boy had tried to bum a
cigarette from a woman who misun
derstood his advances and called the
police. When the facts became clear, says
Block, the cops sent the boy home.
No one knows how many hearing
impaired Americans are accidentally
snarled in the nation's legal system, a sys
tem that experts say is too often blind to
their special needs. No one knows how
often it happens. But it happens.
"Sometimes the same things happen to
the deaf as to the retarded," says Larry
King of the Maryland Association for Re
tarded Citizens.
"Either the trial goes on without their
participation and they're sent to jail, or
they're sent to an institution where, ironi
cally, they may end up serving longer than
they would if they'd been tried."
"Unfortunately, very few deaf people
know their rights," says Nancy Connors of
the National Center on the Law and the
Deaf in Washington.
Worse, she says, is the fact that many
judges and attorneys are equally ignorant.

The most notorious case is that of
Donald Lange, a 36-year-old Chicago
deaf-mute who never learned to sign or
read lips.
Lang was never tried on a 1%5 charge of
murdering a prostitute. The courts found
him unfit to stand trial and sent him to a
mental hospital. He was there for six years.
Then Lang was charged with a second
murder, tried, and, in 1972, convicted. The
Illinois Supreme Court overturned the
conviction because Lang was unable to aid
in his defense. The court ordered state
mental health officials to teach Lang to
communicate so he could be retried.
The state Mental Health Department is
appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, con
tending it has no responsibility because
Lang is not mentally ill.
Today, Lang awaits thef olitts' pleasure
in a Cook County jail cell.
There are 15 million Americans with
hearing impairments, according to the Na
tional Association of the Deaf. More than 7
million have hearing loss in both ears;
nearly two million are profoundly deaf.
