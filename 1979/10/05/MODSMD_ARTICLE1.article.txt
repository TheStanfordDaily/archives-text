# Wait lists still long as last rooms assigned

The names of 160 students re
mained on waiting lists last week to
obtain single student housing as
signments on campus, according to
lean Kitaji, housing office super
visor.
The final placement round for
these students will occur this after
noon. Yesterday afternoon, Kitaji
and other housing office workers
were still counting the number of av
ailable rooms and updating the list of
affected students.
Fd Scoles, director of housing, and
food service management said the
housing shortage is "the worst one in
the past five years." He blamed the
crunch on the influx into the area of
industries whose employees have
occupied housing previously rented
by Stanford students.
In addition, many houses that
were formerly rentals are being sold
to take advantage of soaring local
real estate prices. Some local apart
ment villages have been converted to
condominiums for the same reason.
As a result, Scoles said he believes
less off-campus rental housing is av
ailable in the surrounding towns,
forcing more students to attempt to
seek campus lodging.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson said, however, that
the housing shortage "is not much
worse than last year." He also attri
butes the difference to "an increased
interest in living on campus due to
the lack of low-cost off-campus hous
ing." The number of students who
have entered the housing lottery has
been on the rise during the past sev
eral years, he said.
Another reason for the housing
shortages over the past few years lies
in the burgeoning number of enter
ing freshmen. According to Robin
