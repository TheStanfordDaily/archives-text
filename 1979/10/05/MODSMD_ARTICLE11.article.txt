# BUG ME
## 
### Andrew Rich 
Well, campers, it's another year! What, with
the moving in, finding bearable courses, waiting
in lines, and so on, you'd probably forgotten all
about the best column in the Daily: Bug Me.lt's
back, ready and waiting for your use and abuse.
This year I'd like to make Bug Me more than
just a question and answer column. Send me
your queries, your best dirty jokes, your advice
to the lovelorn.
Be creative, be absurd, be obtuse if you like.
Ask about Stanford, about San Francisco,
about transportation, about small furry animals.
I'll try anything once, and if I can't solve your
problem the first time, well, I'll give up.
For example, a friend of mine (how else could
I get copy for the first Bug Me column?) asked
what the significance of the pyramid and the eye
was on the back of the one dollar bill. I told him
it was done by an ancestor of Eugene Kenny's,
who had a premonition about the Transamerica
building in San Francisco.
That didn't satisfy him, so I turned to a book
on numismatics by Joseph Coffin and learned
the real story. The unfinished pyramid is the
design from the reverse side of the Great Seal of
the United States. It first appeared on the dollar
bill in 1935. The catchy foreign phrase above it
translates to "Prosper our Beginnings," the
lower phrase to "A New Order of the Ages."
The pyramid itself represents the original thir
teen colonies (count the courses of masonry
and look at the date if you don't believe me,) and
the capstone with the omniscient eye sym
bolizes Divine Blessing. So now you know.
A less esoteric question from another friend:
What's with all the torn-up sidewalks around
campus, especially between Meyer and Stern?
Couldn't it have been done before the quarter

began?
The torn-up sidewalks between Crothers and
the libraries, which extend up Galvez Street to
Stern, are soon to become the Galvez Mall.
Facilities Engineer )ohn Lerry explains that
"work started back in August, but there was an
extensive amount of material to remove."
When completed,the mall will halt all motor
traffic on Galvez between Serra and Escondido,
with the exception of a service road for the lib
raries. Replacing the old street will be bicycle
and pedestrian paths, a flower garden and "a
rather large recreation field, which we assume
will be used by the students," according to
Lerry.
The Mall has been in the master plan at Stan
ford for fifteen years, Lerry added,but "this sort
of thing gets done in stages."
So, how long will you have to cringe as you
peddle across those barbarous looking rocks?
"As far as the paving is concerned, it should be
done certainly by the end of this month," said
Lerry. The entire project should be finished by
the end of November.
If you live in Escondido Village, you may have
noticed some piles of sawdust and dirt around.
Those are the ingredients for the topsoil mix for
the Galvez Mall.
Other repaving projects underway right now,
such as on Panama and Serra, are all part of a
larger objective: to make the center of campus
more accessible to bicycles and pedestrians.
That's about all the room we've got today. If
you're bugged by something, bothered, bored,
or simply curious, write to me care of Bug Me,
the Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, 94305; or drop it by the Daily office; or
attach it to a rock and throw it through my win
dow ....
