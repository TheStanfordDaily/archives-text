The Cuban Revolution
brought "the end of op
pression and misery," and
access to a different life for
millions of women, three
delegates of the Federation
of Cuban Women (FCW)
told an audience here Mon
day.
The delegates, hosted by
the Peninsula branch of the
Women's International
League for Peace and Free
dom and the "Social
Thought" faculty seminar,
spoke on Cuban women to
an attentive crowd of 40 in
the Meyer Forum Room.
Each of the delegates,
Volanda Ferrer, Maria Isabel
Acevedo and Catherine
Rivas, stressed the pivotal
role of the 1959 revolution
in improving the social,
economi. ind political

status ot women in C.ut-a.
"Women had no active
participation in the country
before the triumph of the
revolution," Ferrer said.
She went on to say that prior
to 1959, Cuban women were
victims of widespread labor
discrimination, illiteracy
and prostitution.
This discrimination and
exploitation, she said, exp
lain why in January 1959
women massively expres
sed support for the revolu
tion.
Created 20 years ago, the
FCW claims a membership
of over two million women
and is the only officially
sanctioned women's or
ganization in Cuba. It em
phasizes comprehensive
programs ineduc atmnand
health care, and has
bolstered the participation

of women in the national
government, delegates
said.
According to lerrei, the
FCW's objectives are "to
raise the political, educa
tional and ideological
level of women, to integrate
women into all sectors of
society and to channel all
our efforts to the benefit of
the revolution."
"Cuban women were ac
tive participants in each of
our military mobilizations,"
she added.
"There is still a vestige of
inequality " in Cuba, Ferrer
said, despite what delegates
termed dramatic advances
in social welfare programs.
"We haven't totally elimi
nated male chauvinism,"
she added, laughing with
the predominantly female
audience.
