## Indian mascot rebuked 
### 
Once again, as predictable as the pas
sing seasons, the movement to bring
back the Indian mascot is dirtying up the
community and diverting our debate
from more substantive issues.
In January 1972, native American stu
dents here petitioned the administra
tion, asking the University to stop calling
its athletic teams the "Indians" and to
stop Prince Lightfoot (who, in the inter
vening years has somehow become a
chief) from performing as the Indian
symbol at football games. Since then, the
Daily Editorial Board has strongly sup
ported those students and all others in
their opposition to the Indian mascot.
We reiterate that position once again,
for what we hope will be the last time.
The 1972 statement of the native
American students is as applicable and
convincing now as it was then:
"A race is not entertainment. There is
little chance that those who regard the
term 'Indian' as a team name will ever
realize the importance of socio
economic problems, the traditional
lifestyles, and the religious practices
which are central to an understanding of
today's Indian people.
"People will fail to understand the
human side of being Indian as long as
they can choose instead to see only the
entertaining aspects of Indian life."
We find the current efforts to reinstate
the Indian mascot most upsetting. The
sale of T-shirts bearing a symbolic rep
resentation of a native American chief is
insulting to native Americans who don't
care to see themselves portrayed
stereotypically.
Those native Americans who support
the Indian mascot seem to be, for the
most part, victims of a generation gap
that leaves them out of touch with what it
means to be a native American in today's
society. It should surprise no one that
such a generation gap is as much, if not
more, a problem in a minority group
whose self-esteem is growing more rapidly
than it is in society in general.
The large number of recent alumni
and current students who support this
insensitive movement is distressing. For
them, the Indian mascot holds no senti
mental value. They appear to believe it
would simply be "fun" to use Indians as
the name of our athletic teams.

But whatever the motivation of those
seeking the return of the Indian mascot,
a concern for the opinion of the people
here who would be offended by its use is
missing. This issue is simply not signific
ant enough to warrant taking the risk of
offending or ignoring the opinion of a
smaller group of persons in order to
please a larger group. Sometimes that
course of action is necessary, but not
when dealing with a symbolic mascot for
a team playing a game.
Some advocates of the Indian mascot
claim its use could bring attention to the
state of native-American affairs both
here and nationwide. This is at best a
naive, blind assertion made with little
reflection on how the mascot was used
in the past, which has determined how
numerous alumni will forever think of an
Indian mascot, and on the very purpose
of a mascot, which should be simply a
unifying symbol.
For the University to officially adopt
the Indian mascot with the intention ot
using it to foster the community's
awareness of native American affairs
would be a slap in the face to other
minority groups that are just as deserv
ing of such official recognition.
Certainly no one would propose cal
ling our athletic teams the Stanford
"Blacks" or "Chicanos." The Indian
mascot is just as insulting to native
Americans and anyone else who would
be ashamed to attend a school giving its
teams a racial designation.
We strongly urge the University to
contact stores selling the "Bring Back
Chief Lightfoot" T-shirts and ask them to
stop doing so. We also ask students and
others attending football games not to
wear feathers, buttons or anything else
advocating the return of the Indian mas
cot.
If Timm Williams tries to take the field
in his "Chief Lightfoot" alter ego, we
urge you not to applaud. Only by clearly
demonstrating widespread contempt for
the Indian mascot will this distasteful
movement be put to a final end.
Native Americans are people, not
symbols for athletic teams. To
stereotype them, for whatever reason
and in whatever manner, is an affront to
common decency and courtesy.

Certainly no one would propose cal
ling our athletic teams the Stanford
"Blacks" or "Chicanos." The Indian
mascot is just as insulting to native
Americans and anyone else who would
be ashamed to attend a school giving its
teams a racial designation.
We strongly urge the University to
contact stores selling the "Bring Back
Chief Lightfoot" T-shirts and ask them to
stop doing so. We also ask students and
others attending football games not to
wear feathers, buttons or anything else
advocating the return of the Indian mas
cot.
If Timm Williams tries to take the field
in his "Chief Lightfoot" alter ego, we
urge you not to applaud. Only by clearly
demonstrating widespread contempt for
the Indian mascot will this distasteful
movement be put to a final end.
Native Americans are people, not
symbols for athletic teams. To
stereotype them, for whatever reason
and in whatever manner, is an affront to
common decency and courtesy.
Once again, as predictable as the pas
sing seasons, the movement to bring
back the Indian mascot is dirtying up the
community and diverting our debate
from more substantive issues.
In January 1972, native American stu
dents here petitioned the administra
tion, asking the University to stop calling
its athletic teams the "Indians" and to
stop Prince Lightfoot (who, in the inter
vening years has somehow become a
chief) from performing as the Indian
symbol at football games. Since then, the
Daily Editorial Board has strongly sup
ported those students and all others in
their opposition to the Indian mascot.
We reiterate that position once again,
for what we hope will be the last time.
The 1972 statement of the native
American students is as applicable and
convincing now as it was then:
"A race is not entertainment. There is
little chance that those who regard the
term 'Indian' as a team name will ever
realize the importance of socio
economic problems, the traditional
lifestyles, and the religious practices
which are central to an understanding of
today's Indian people.
"People will fail to understand the
human side of being Indian as long as
they can choose instead to see only the
entertaining aspects of Indian life."
We find the current efforts to reinstate
the Indian mascot most upsetting. The
sale of T-shirts bearing a symbolic rep
resentation of a native American chief is
insulting to native Americans who don't
care to see themselves portrayed
stereotypically.
Those native Americans who support
the Indian mascot seem to be, for the
most part, victims of a generation gap
that leaves them out of touch with what it
means to be a native American in today's
society. It should surprise no one that
such a generation gap is as much, if not
more, a problem in a minority group
whose self-esteem is growing more rapidly
than it is in society in general.
The large number of recent alumni
and current students who support this
insensitive movement is distressing. For
them, the Indian mascot holds no senti
mental value. They appear to believe it
would simply be "fun" to use Indians as
the name of our athletic teams.

But whatever the motivation of those
seeking the return of the Indian mascot,
a concern for the opinion of the people
here who would be offended by its use is
missing. This issue is simply not signific
ant enough to warrant taking the risk of
offending or ignoring the opinion of a
smaller group of persons in order to
please a larger group. Sometimes that
course of action is necessary, but not
when dealing with a symbolic mascot for
a team playing a game.
Some advocates of the Indian mascot
claim its use could bring attention to the
state of native-American affairs both
here and nationwide. This is at best a
naive, blind assertion made with little
reflection on how the mascot was used
in the past, which has determined how
numerous alumni will forever think of an
Indian mascot, and on the very purpose
of a mascot, which should be simply a
unifying symbol.
For the University to officially adopt
the Indian mascot with the intention ot
using it to foster the community's
awareness of native American affairs
would be a slap in the face to other
minority groups that are just as deserv
ing of such official recognition.
Certainly no one would propose cal
ling our athletic teams the Stanford
"Blacks" or "Chicanos." The Indian
mascot is just as insulting to native
Americans and anyone else who would
be ashamed to attend a school giving its
teams a racial designation.
We strongly urge the University to
contact stores selling the "Bring Back
