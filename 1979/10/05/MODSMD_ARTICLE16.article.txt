## Reasons for action at Seabrook 
### 
Tomorrow, October fa, anti-nuclear pro
testers will begin an occupation of the nuc
lear reactor construction site in Seabrook,
New Hampshire. As described by the or
ganizers, the Coalition tor Direct Action at
Seabrook:
"Our aim is to nonviolently enter the
Seabrook nuclear site and to prevent con
struction by staying there. The collective
non-violent intent of this action excludes
all weapons. Such implements as ladders,
shovels and wire cutters may be necessary
to gain access to the construction areas.
"The goal of this action is not to provoke
a fight, nor is it to be arrested. Rather, our
vision is to collectively create, in conjunc
tion with local residents, an anti-nuclear
community of people building, gardening
and living on the site, in the model of the
successful European nuclear site occupa
tions."
The accident at the Three Mile Island
nuclear station last spring illustrates
graphically that neither the nuclear indus
try nor the government can be trusted to
protect our safety. The unthinkable, im
possible accident has occurred, possibly
dooming hundreds to premature death
from cancer. The nuclear industry has
claimed that only a few w<ll die from the
radiation released, even though no one
knows, or can know, how much radiation
was actually released at Harrisburg.
The few radiation meters surrounding
the site registered erratically as the emis
sions swirled past them in the wind. Furth
ermore, the complex movement of

radioisotopes through the food chain and
the number of cancers induced by a given
amount of radiation is still unclear. All we
know is that a great number of people
were exposed to radiation without their
consent.
The Carter Administration's response to
the accident has been to push for more
nuclear power even faster than before. We
are told that the accident proves how safe
nuclear power is since there was no
meltdown.
In fact, the accident was very severe,
and it could easily have been much worse.
Any number of uncontrollable events
could have led to contamination of much
of Pennsylvania and neighboring states,
making them uninhabitable lor hundreds
of years.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
eager to resume licensing new reactors
even though the final report on Three Mile
Island has still not been released. Unfor
tunately, this is just one more example
among many that show that the NRC pro
motes the nuclear industry more often
than it regulates.
People should be able to participate ef
fectively in decisions which have signific
ant impacts on their lives. Hut in marked
contrast to this tradition of local control,
usually particularly strong in New England,
the Seabrook reactor typifies the unde
mocratic measures that have been taken to
support nuclear power.
The citizens of Seabrook have voted
twice against construction of the plant, as
have seven neighboring towns. Nearby

towns refuse to sell water tor construc
tion, so it must be trucked in. Concerned
citizens have pursued every available av
enue ot legal intervention in the regulat
ory process.
Over the past decade, all legal means of
stopping reactor construction have been
exhausted.
In more recent years, the Clamshell Al
liance has held numerous protest rallies,
alternative-energy fairs and peaceful civil
disobedience demonstrations at Seab
rook. In May 1977, over a thousand people
were arrested for trespassing on the site.
Yet construction continues because the
decision-making remains in the hands of a
tew people.
At tivists feel that now the violence of
nuc lear power must be opposed. With no
other recourse, they must enter the
decision-making process by non-violently
blocking construction with their bodies.
The authorities may choose to sit down
and address their concerns or, -at the
other extreme â€” to remove them by
overwhelming force, which will be met
only with non-violent resistance.
The occupation at Seabrook invites a re
sponse from all Americans. The presence
of thousands of people building an
alternative-energy community at the reac
tor site will confront each of us with a
decision: whether or not to continue ac
ceptanceof this technology and the means
that have been used to protect it from pub
lic criticism.
