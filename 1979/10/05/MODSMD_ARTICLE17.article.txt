Cartoon attacked
The Mac Nelly cartoon
printed in the Daily on Oct. 3
misuses the image of Martin
Luther King for political ends
with which he would have dis
agreed. It implies that the
SCLC/Jesse Jackson initiative
toward including the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO)
in the Middle East peace pro
cess is a violation of King's
political principles.
In fact, in the last years of his
life, King began to recognize
the links between the move
ment for black liberation in the
U.S. and the liberation strug
gles of other peoples around
the world (especially in Viet
nam) against U.S.-backed re
gimes.
Current black concern for
the liberation of the Palestinian
people is thus consistent with
the real development of King's

political principles.
The cartoon supports the
myth that the PLO is just a
bunch of gun-toting "ter
rorists" who cannot be trusted
to make peace. In fact, the PLO
is the organization which rep
resents the Palestinian nation's
quest for self-determination.
The PLO's sometimes violent
tactics area response (however
irrational and unproductive) to
the systematic violence which
the Israeli state has inflicted
against the Palestinian people:
expulsion from their lands,
exile or relegation to second
class citizenship, repression of
dissent and maltreatment of
political prisoners, mas ve
bombings of civilian targets in
Lebanon, etc.
That these Israeli actions
constitute violations of the
Palestinians' civil and human
rights is evident to anyone wil
ling to admit the facts. (No

wonder Begin refused to meet
with the black leaders!)
Anti-civilian violence by the
PLC) does not really help the
Palestinians' cause any more
than Israeli bombings of Pales
tinian civilians really increase
the "security" of Israeli Jews.
The real issue, however, is
not the cycle of violence per
se, but the denial of Palestinian
nationhood which is the root
of that violence.
Black civil rights leaders
won't be able to resolve the
Middle East conflict by them
selves. Nevertheless, they
have made a great contribution
to justice and peace by insist
ing on the legitimacy of the
Palestinians cause, however
"undiplomatic" it may be for
them to do so.
Traditional "Diplomacy,"
whether of the Kissinger or
Carter type, can only prolong
the agony of the peoples of the
Middle East.

The recent AP article {Daily,

tion one of the primary causes
of the phenomenon: the high
divorce rate under "no fault"
divorce law coupled with the
programming of schoolgirls
and young women to.look
realistically at their economic
prospects if they are to remain
in the home.
If the family is to survive with
functions beyond mere
procreation, the role of
horrtemaker must be recog
nized in law as equal in worth
to that of breadwinner — that
is, a homemaking vocation
must be as economically re
warding in any given marriage
as the breadwinner's career.
This does not mean "back
wages" on divorce for former
housewives—who would then
have been their husbands'
employees. Rather, it means
sharing equally, as community
property, the equity in the
earning-capacity increase (ad
justed for inflation) gained by
each spouse in the operations
of the equal partnership mar
riage.
In a traditional marriage, the
housewife's earning capacity
virtually stands still. And, while
she carries out the couple's
jointly and equally incurred
domestic responsibilities dur

ing the workday, she thereby
frees her husband to increase
his earning capacity to the ex
tent to which he does increase
it.
Not to grant the former
housewife an equal share in
the equity in this increase is not
only to deny the equality of the
marriage partnership and to
have exploited her, but more
significantly, to discourage
younger wives from remaining
in the home and to encourage
state takeover of child rearing.
As for "a family's desire to
keep up with inflation by hav
ing two wage-earners" instead
of cutting back expenses, the
double income contributes to
the problem. For rise in costs is
to some extent caused by
people's ability and willingness
to pay — concomitants of the
two-income family.
A society with its values in
this kind of order will lose one
of its most precious rights: the
right of parents to rear their
children themselves. And the
coming "superstate" will con
trol every aspect of everyone's
life from pre-birth to death.

warding in any given marriage
as the breadwinner's career.
This does not mean "back
wages" on divorce for former
housewives—who would then
have been their husbands'
employees. Rather, it means
sharing equally, as community
property, the equity in the
earning-capacity increase (ad
justed for inflation) gained by
each spouse in the operations
of the equal partnership mar
riage.
In a traditional marriage, the
housewife's earning capacity
virtually stands still. And, while
she carries out the couple's
jointly and equally incurred
domestic responsibilities dur

ing the workday, she thereby
frees her husband to increase
his earning capacity to the ex
tent to which he does increase
it.
Not to grant the former
housewife an equal share in
the equity in this increase is not
only to deny the equality of the
marriage partnership and to
have exploited her, but more
significantly, to discourage
younger wives from remaining
in the home and to encourage
state takeover of child rearing.
As for "a family's desire to
keep up with inflation by hav
ing two wage-earners" instead
of cutting back expenses, the
double income contributes to
the problem. For rise in costs is
to some extent caused by
people's ability and willingness
to pay — concomitants of the
two-income family.
A society with its values in
this kind of order will lose one
of its most precious rights: the
right of parents to rear their
children themselves. And the
coming "superstate" will con
trol every aspect of everyone's
life from pre-birth to death.

Cartoon attacked
The Mac Nelly cartoon
printed in the Daily on Oct. 3
misuses the image of Martin
Luther King for political ends
with which he would have dis
agreed. It implies that the
SCLC/Jesse Jackson initiative
toward including the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO)
in the Middle East peace pro
cess is a violation of King's
political principles.
In fact, in the last years of his
life, King began to recognize
the links between the move
ment for black liberation in the
U.S. and the liberation strug
gles of other peoples around
the world (especially in Viet
nam) against U.S.-backed re
gimes.
Current black concern for
the liberation of the Palestinian
people is thus consistent with
the real development of King's

political principles.
The cartoon supports the
myth that the PLO is just a
bunch of gun-toting "ter
rorists" who cannot be trusted
to make peace. In fact, the PLO
is the organization which rep
resents the Palestinian nation's
quest for self-determination.
The PLO's sometimes violent
tactics area response (however
irrational and unproductive) to
the systematic violence which
the Israeli state has inflicted
against the Palestinian people:
expulsion from their lands,
exile or relegation to second
class citizenship, repression of
dissent and maltreatment of
political prisoners, mas ve
bombings of civilian targets in
Lebanon, etc.
That these Israeli actions
constitute violations of the
Palestinians' civil and human
rights is evident to anyone wil
ling to admit the facts. (No

wonder Begin refused to meet
with the black leaders!)
Anti-civilian violence by the
PLC) does not really help the
Palestinians' cause any more
than Israeli bombings of Pales
tinian civilians really increase
the "security" of Israeli Jews.
The real issue, however, is
not the cycle of violence per
se, but the denial of Palestinian
nationhood which is the root
of that violence.
Black civil rights leaders
won't be able to resolve the
Middle East conflict by them
selves. Nevertheless, they
have made a great contribution
to justice and peace by insist
ing on the legitimacy of the
Palestinians cause, however
"undiplomatic" it may be for
them to do so.
Traditional "Diplomacy,"
whether of the Kissinger or
Carter type, can only prolong
the agony of the peoples of the
Middle East.
