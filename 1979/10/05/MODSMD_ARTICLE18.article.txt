# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Bobbe Lacerda Woe the travails of the bicyclist 
### 
It says in Approaching Stan
ford, that the Farm is primarily
a biker's campus and that it is a
wise idea tor incoming stu
dents to think about making
the two-wheeled investment.
Once here on campus, most
freshpersons do purchase
bikes it they have not already
shipped one from home.
As a freshperson two years
ago, I decided that a bike was
very necessary and complied
to what looked like the norm
here at Stanford, a backpack
on the back and a bike bet
ween the legs. Nowhere, how

ever, did anyone write, say or
otherwise communicate the
tact that Stanford, with well
over 5000 bikes dashing madly
about, has no rules for bike
safety.
I myself dealt with this in the
only way possible. On my way
to c lass I would reach the edge
of White Plaza or any major
thoroughfare and simply take a
deep breath, close my eyes,
peddle furiously . . .and pray.
I never ran into any problems,
or other bicyclists for that mat
ter. However, this did produce
high blood pressure and ten
sion. So my doctor forbade me
to carry on this way for fear that
I would develop hypertension
and ulcers.
Around the time of my high
blood pressure diagnosis, the
Bicycle Safety Committee was
formulated to take care ot the
increasing bike traffic on cam
pus and the high incidence of
collisions as a result of this. I
believe the whole campus
probably welcomed the inves
tigation and the expected bike
safety plan that the committee
was to produce.Except, of
course, the Campus Bike Shop
which was currently planning
fo buy out IBM with the profits
made over the past twelve
months repairing bikes from
high speed contact with other
objects (people, bikes, trees)
on campus.
I assume the Bicycle Safety
Committee did meet and de
vise some plan to insure the
safety of pedestrians and bik
ers alike. However, it is clear
the plans outlayed by the
committee were not far
reaching enough for the ad
ministration. 'So, over the
summer, the University took
the problem of bike safety into
its own hands and came up
with what can only be called
the "final solution."
With a summer of relaxation
and a lowering of my blood
pressure, the doctor gave me
the go ahead to ride my bike
once again. It took little time to

figure out that the University's
answer to bike safety is to hin
der bikers so much or so slow
them down that in effect they
are forced to walk rather than
ride their bikes around cam
pus.
Several problems became
apparent immediately upon
mounting my bike . . .such as
the fact that I would have to
give it jumping lessons to make
it over all the barriers which are
now erected along familiar
bike routes throughout the
campus, or get a special bike
rack in order to strap the bike
to my back while I hike over the
mountains of rubble which
now block access from one
end of the campus to another.
Sort of like when one comes to
a waterfall and has to get
out and haul your boat around
it. No big deal, I can put up
with this, for awhile at least.
Once on my bike, I am head
ing from Tresidder to the Quad
via that road that runs into the
back of Memorial Church.
(This becomes a literal state
ment if ones brakes do not
work). To discourage biking on
this street they have erected
cement curbs on either side of
the car entrance to the Outer
Quad, leaving about a one foot
space to get your bike through
here.
Not bad if you are riding
through at 6 a.m. or some
other ungodly hour . . . but
now I see 2000 bikes in front of
me, 250 in a real hurry, 500
without working brakes, 250
riding without hands and the
rest freshpersons who think
that miraculously they will get
through this alive. And these
are only the bikes that are
going down the road. I know
that somewhere beyond this
mass of flesh and metal are
those who, like salmon frying
to go upstream, are opposing
the flow. I also know, like so
many salmon they will never
make it.
Somehow, I made it through
there, vowing never to take

that path again. Now on my
way to the biology building, I
am careening along past the
Physics Tank and, as I cross
Serra Street on the last leg of
my journey, I realize with ter
ror gripping my heart that Serra
Street does not exist anymore.
Rather than a street, there is an
enormous pit and I am sailing
through the air.
There are small specks below
me which I make out as
people. They are all watching
and holding their breath as
Famous Canyon Jumping
Daredevil Bobbe Lacerda at-,
tempts the death-defying feat
of jumping over an expanse
equal to the Grand Canyon.
And far off I hear the an
nouncer, "And it looks good
folks, it looks as if Bobbe will
make it . . . but wait, no, it is'
hard to tell . . .
\
I could see the ground clos- '
ing in fast and that was when I j
believe I passed out. With a
terrific thud, my bike and I
came to be a heap at the hot- \
torn of the pit . . . nowhere 1
near the other side of what
used to be the navigable road '
called Serra. A couple of
people rushed ... or rather
hiked down to where I lay
sprawled. They helped me up
and as I limped away they
promised to get the Fire and
Rescue team to come back and
airlift my bike out (to the Cam
pus Bike Shop). They just
might buy out IBM yet!
Well, I guess the University
has the right idea about bike
safety and all, and I have no
doubt that in a couple of weeks
there will only be a few
diehards that will be on bikes,
but I really think a nice letter
home over the summer to the
effect of "please leave your
bike at home" would have
been a bit less traumatic and
perhaps more humane.
