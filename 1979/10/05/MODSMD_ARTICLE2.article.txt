# Senior Class in money crunch
## 
### Meg Ward Andrea James 
Senior Class Presidents are considering a special fee
assessment election later this year so they can raise
money to help sponsor the many activities they en
dorsed in their campaign platform last year.
The seniors missed the deadline for filing
signatures of persons favoring the placement of a $1 fee
assessment on the October ballot. Officers circulated
petitions Monday to get on the ballot but gave up the
effort Wednesday after learning the deadline had pas
sed.
"We didn't know the exact channels we had to go
through to get on the ballot," explained senior presi
dent Alan Alpert, who added that, had the assessment
been placed on the ballot and approved, the class would
have received $1500.
So now the officers must find other vCays to obtain
money from the senior class.
The class already has a $3000 treasury because of the
special $2 assessment paid by the students when they
were freshmen. According to Alpert, however, the as
sessment, which has remained at $2 per student for the
last several years, should be raised to $3 or $4 because of
inflation.
"One Happy Hour alone costs $300," Alpert said.
He added that, although "it won't kill us if we don't get
more money," the extra assessments would allow the
officers to provide some of the activities they promised
on their platform last year, including among other
events, more happy hours.

The class is working now to influence the necessary
University and ASSU officials to change the by-laws so
that entering freshmen will pay more tor their senior
class treasury.
The special election option to raise more money for
the senior class is full of problems, Alpert asserted.
First, the class would incur the costs of the election,
such as paying poll watchers and other election workers.
In addition, the precise determination of the popula
tion that constitutes the senior class would be difficult.
"Class status academically is determined by the
number of units a student has relative to the 180 units
required for graduation," explained University registrar
Sally Mahoney.
Hence, students who enter with advanced placement
units or who carry heavy class loads may technically be
seniors even though they don't plan to graduate this
June or to participate in Senior Class activities this year.
"Whatever formula we come up with will be subject to
error," Mahoney said, adding that the same problems
would occur in trying to determine who is eligible to
vote in the special election.
Another option open to the senior class is to sponsor
several fundraising events to increase the treasury. But
this, too, is not the most desirable alternative, Alpert
said.
Nonetheless, some of the ideas discussed in senior
class meetings includechargingadmission fora movieat
the beginning of Winter Quarter or cleaning up the
stadium after a game.
