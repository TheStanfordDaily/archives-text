# Stanford. UCLA open conference
## Four down, Pac-10 to go SPORTS 
### Ivan Maisel 
The UCLA Bruins, visitors to Stanford
Stadium tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., have had
many 1979 football experiences similar to
those of their host, the Stanford Cardinals.
Like Stanford, the Bruins are opening
their Pacific-10 Conference schedule to
morrow.
And like Stanford, the Bruins opened
their season with four non-conference
games. In addition, they split those four
games evenly between wins and losses,
just like their sister school to the north.
That, however, is where the similarity
ends. While Stanford was struggling
through Bottom Twenty schools like
Tulane, San lose State, Army and Boston
College, UCLA was playing Top Twenty
teams such as Houston, Purdue and Ohio
State, as well as Wisconsin.
Comparing the Bruins' schedule to Stan
lord's is like comparing the Marx Brothers
to the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame, and
that helps to explain why UCLA is a three
point favorite over the Cards.
UCLA is coming off a last-minute 17-13
loss to eighth-ranked Ohio State and head
loach Terry Donahue is concerned.
"Our football team is 2-2. I'm greedy:
2-2 is not very good,'' Donahue said. "Un
realistic as that might appear, I want to be
4-0."
"I am realistic enough," he added, "to
know we could be 0-4."
UCLA easily had the toughest opening
schedule in the Pac-10, and with the possi
ble exception of Notre Dame (which
played Michigan, Purdue and Michigan
State to open the season), the toughest in
the country.
The Bruins opened at home with a 24-16
loss to Houston, bounced back to upset
sixth-ranked Purdue 31-21 and blasted
Wisconsin 37-12 before last week's
heartbreaker against the Buckeyes.
Donahue compared the Ohio State
game to the 1977 UCLA-Stanford game,
when reserve quarterback Steve Dils
threw a 27-yard touchdown pass with 37
seconds left to lames Lofton to overtake

the Bruins, 32-28.
"In the last game we played, we had a
chance to win," Donahue said. "We had to
stop them from going 80 yards and we
didn't. They (Ohio State) played a lot of
ball in the end."
The Bruins' potent offense is led by elu
sive junior tailback Freeman McNeil. The
5-feet-11, 215-pounder is the second lead
ing rusher in the conference, averaging
117.3 yards per game.
McNeil's backup, sophomore Anthony
Edgar, has more than distinguished him
self at tailback. Edgar rushed for 168 yards
against Wisconsin (McNeil was out of the
game with the flu) and is currently fifth in
the conference with an 80-yard-per-game
average.
The passing game has been, at best, in
consistent. Quarterback Rick Bashore
ranks only ninth in the Pac-10, and with
junior split end Michael Brant out lor the
season with a broken leg, things are not
getting any brighter.
"We're very limited as usual. We've not
been very successful," Donahue said of
his aerial attack. "Rick (Bashore) has done
much better than a year ago. He could do a
lot better, like we could be 4-0, but we're
not.
The fourth-year coach has fewer worries
about his pass defense. The defensive
secondary is sparked by junior All -
American Kenny Easley.
Stanford fans remember Easley as the
man who returned a third-quarter kickofl
93 yards for a touchdown in last year's
27-26 loss to UCLA. He led the conterence
in kickoff returns this season with a 27.6
average.
Stanford head coach Rod Dowhower
will combat Easley's fleet-footedness with
the right leg of junior Ken Naber.
"We had an outstanding effort from
Naber," Dowhower said of last week's
33-14 trouncing of Boston College. "He's
been doing quite well."
Dowhower praised kick-snapper Mike
Teeuws for his "putting the ball on the
money" in centering it to Naber.

For those of you who have developed 1 a
mental block ot last year s kicking game,
allow your memory to be refreshed.
Besides Easley's touchdown return,
UCLA blocked a punt and just made min
cemeat of the Cards' special teams. Two
blocked punts, both returned for
touchdowns, cost Stanford the following
week's game too, 34-31 to Washington.
Naber is second in the Pac-1() in punting
with a mean of 42.3 yards per kick. In addi
tion, Naber has consistently boomed kic
koffs into the end zone, thus disallowing
the opposition good field position.
Keeping UCLA pinned back is what
Dowhower would like to do most.
"I'm sure (UCLA) will hold onto the
ball," he said. Hopefully, we'll hold them
and get the offense the ball and hold onto
it."
Leading the Cardinal offense will be
Stanford's version ol the Hardy Boys,
quarterbacks Turk Schonert and john Fl
way. The tandem came of age last week,
shooting Stanford into third place in
Pac-10 passing.
"Their having two quarterbacks poses a
problem," Donahue said. "Odds are one
of them will get hot."
The Cardinals' leading target will be
junior flanker Ken Margerum, who caught
a career-high three touchdowns and nine
passes in last week's win.
Dowhower is confident of his team
being on the upswing after the rocky start.
"In looking back, we didn't have Darrin
Nelson, and we had no linebackers or
safeties in terms of experience. You don't
realize what a toll it takes," he said. "You
play your best athletes, and some of our
best are freshmen."
"I think it will all even out in the end,"
Dowhower added. "Six months ago you'd
thought we would be a factor in the con
ference rate. We still could be, although
in a different way."
"I hope UCLA is accounting tor us," the
tirst-year coach said. "I'd like to think they
are."
