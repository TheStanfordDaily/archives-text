# Stanford wins in lackluster effort

"We played well enough to
win,'' said goalie Craig Ueland.
Thai was one of the sentiments
expressed following Stanford's
soccer game with Fresno
Pacific Wednesday afternoon.
Oh, the Cardinals won 4-2 all
right, but it was the way they
won, or rather the way they
managed not to lose.
The Cards didn't observe the
traditional 1-0 deficit. In fact,
part of Stanford's problem
stemmed from taking the 1-0

lead with 6:05 elapsed on a )ack
McGannon goal, assisted by
Dan McNevin.
"We seemed to play with a
lack of enthusiasm and excite
ment out there," said Card
coach Nelson Lodge. "Fresno
came downfield as we coasted
(on our lead). We scored early
and for the next 40 minutes we
dropped back."
An apparently revived Card
squad quickly built up a 3-0
lead early in the second on a

shot by Willie Guicce (McNevin
assist) about seven minutes
into the second half and a
McNevin penalty kick seven
minutes later. Instead of rein
forcing the Stanford attack
though, extending the margin
simply seemed to compound
the problem of an uninspired
performance.
"I told the team at halftime
that at the next example of
poor attitude I'd put in subs,"
Lodge explained. "We stored
two goals and with the 3-0 lead

we sat back. I his team (F resno)
kept coming. Then our team
realized the game could be tied
and five minutes after Fresno
Pacific's second goal, we
scored," another Guicce tally
on a double assist by Bill Hot
fenberg and McNevin.
Ueland observed that the
team plays well against good
teams and badly against teams
which are not as good. "The
game was close but only be
cause we let them (get close),"
he said.
