## 
### Brad Brockbank 
The Stanford water polo
team puts its home-pool win
ning streak to one of its
tougher tests this weekend
when the Cardinals square off
against UC-lrvine and UCLA at
deGuerre pool.
The Cardinals, who have not
lost in the last 40 games at
home, will be challenged by a
young Irvine team today at 3
p.m.
"It's a typical Irv re team,"
said Card coach Oante i)e
ttamanti. "They make very tew
mistakes. They plav a «»riH
tured, disciplined gartv
He added that the Anteaters
are one of the best teams at
stopping the counter-attack,
Stanford's most potent
weapon.
At 10 a.m. tomorrow, the
Cards face a "vastly improved"
UCLA squad in Stanford's sec
ond Pacific-10 contest this fall.
The Cards take a 1-0 confer
ence record into the game after
beating Arizona here last
week.
Although Dettamanti said
the games this weekend
should be reasonably close, he

did say he thought his team
was better than the 10-8 and
10-7 scores against these op
ponents might imply.
He explained that UCLA and
UC-lrvine are two ot the faster
teams in the Card schedule,
and that may take something
away from the devastating
Card counter-attack. However,
he added that the team has
been working a lot on the
counter this week in practice
and, although "the team isn't
as experienced as in the past,"
he expects it to be an important
and successful aspet t of the
Stanford attack.
And if this Stanford bread
and-butter play is indeed as
successful as it has been in the
past, there may be a few belly
up Bruins and Anteaters need
ing to be skimmed out of de-
Guerre this weekend.
