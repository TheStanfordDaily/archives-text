Interview," the piece will feature a different

and athletic light.
This week Friday interviewer Sally Jenkins
talked with lohn Elway, the freshman quarter
hack who has generated quite a lot of publicity
as well as offense. He is 16-for-32 with three
touchdowns on the year and ranks seventh in
the Pac-10 in passing.
lenkins: Why did you pick Stanford? First of all
who recruited you?
Elway: Well, I got letters from about 60 different
schools. I cut it down to about six, and took trips
to see them. I looked at Missouri, Washington,
Notre Dame, USC, San lose State and Stanford.
Stanford was the place I wanted to go because 112
tame from a high school that threw the ball a lot,
and I wanted to go someplace where I'd get to
throw the ball a lot, because that's what I like to
do, and it's one of the fun parts about football.
Stanford is known tor throwing the football, and
plus they have great academics.
lenkins: Over USC, huh? Why is that?
Elway: Veah. I would've liked to go to USC, but I
was thinking that if I went to 'SC I might get real
frustrated, cause they don't throw the ball, they
just hand the ball off.
lenkins: Since you've come here from high
school, do you feel like you've improved a
whole lot in terms of your arm and technique?
Elway: Veah; in high school, well,
tundamental-wise I have improved a lot be
cause they've worked on it'with me, and men
tally I've gained a lot bee ause I've learned a lot
read-ng defenses, and stutf like that. The har
dest thing has been the c hange in offenses, be
cause it's so difficult to learn. There's so many
different little things to it that it's taken me
a while to get it down.
lenkins: But no major problems with it?
Elway: No, not really.' It just takes time to learn it
all.
lenkins: You operated real well under pressure
last week against Boston College; you had to
duck a lot, but you still got the ball off. Did you
ever feel it?
Elway: Ahh, well we put the shotgun in last
week, which really helped a lot. It's a lot easier if
you can see the rush coming early, then you can
get out of there. They were coming in hard, but
the offensive line did a really good job.
lenkins: furk iSchonert), on the other hand got
nailed a lot. It seems to me that the best game he
had was the San lose State game where he
wasn t under a lot o! pressure. Do you think he
has trouble handling pressure?

Elway: Not really. On film you can see that he
does a really good job of getting out of it. He and
I are different that way. He likes to stay in there
and duck, and I like to get out of there and run
around. But I think he does a good job.
lenkins: How do you guys get alongt
Elway: Good. We're good friends. He helps me a
lot on the field and things like that. We have no
things against each other.
lenkins: Are you all competing?
Elway: No. He's the number one quarterback,
and I'm number two. We're really not out there
to compete against each other. We're just ouf
there to both get the job done and win. We're
not out there pitted against each other. It's a
good relationship.
lenkins: A lot of people think you should be
starting against UCLA. How do you feel about
that?
Elway: It'd be nice, but it doesn't really bother
me that I'm not, because I still need a lot of
experience, and Turk's got experience over me.
I believe in Coach Dowhower, and what he says
goes. If he thinks that Turk should start, then I
do too.
lenkins: Do you expect to play at all against
UCLA?
Elway: I guess. Coach Dowhower said some
thing about me getting to play some time,
lenkins: Should the situation ever come up, do
you feel you could handle the starting position?
Elway: Veah. I'm not sure I could handle it right
now, but later in the season. The more experi
ence I get earlier in the season, the better I
would be able to handle it.
lenkins: There was a headline in one of the pap
ers last week that said Another QB controversy?'
Do you think that kind of thing is affecting the
team;'
Elway: No. Down inside the team, we know that
there is no controversy whatsoever. People are
trying to make it into more than it is.
lenkins: There are a lot of freshman players on
the team starting, or playing a large role. Are
there ever any problems confidence-wise, or
anything like that? With the older players, too:
do they feel like they have to back you up at all?
Elway: Well, it was that way a little bit before the
Boston College game. Then we had a meeting
on the Monday before the game, and just talked
between the players and the coaches. That
helped a lot of the freshmen. The older players
started patting us on the back, saying 'good job'
and stuff like that, which as a young player really
helps a lot. The team's a lot closer now.
lenkins: Do you have a nickname yetf
Elway: Ohhh, yeah. They call me Elwood, or
Durwood or stuff like that.

lenkins: How do you guys get alongt
Elway: Good. We're good friends. He helps me a
lot on the field and things like that. We have no
things against each other.
lenkins: Are you all competing?
Elway: No. He's the number one quarterback,
and I'm number two. We're really not out there
to compete against each other. We're just ouf
there to both get the job done and win. We're
not out there pitted against each other. It's a
good relationship.
lenkins: A lot of people think you should be
starting against UCLA. How do you feel about
that?
Elway: It'd be nice, but it doesn't really bother
me that I'm not, because I still need a lot of
experience, and Turk's got experience over me.
I believe in Coach Dowhower, and what he says
goes. If he thinks that Turk should start, then I
do too.
lenkins: Do you expect to play at all against
UCLA?
Elway: I guess. Coach Dowhower said some
thing about me getting to play some time,
lenkins: Should the situation ever come up, do
you feel you could handle the starting position?
Elway: Veah. I'm not sure I could handle it right
now, but later in the season. The more experi
ence I get earlier in the season, the better I
would be able to handle it.
lenkins: There was a headline in one of the pap
ers last week that said Another QB controversy?'
Do you think that kind of thing is affecting the
team;'
Elway: No. Down inside the team, we know that
there is no controversy whatsoever. People are
trying to make it into more than it is.
lenkins: There are a lot of freshman players on
the team starting, or playing a large role. Are
there ever any problems confidence-wise, or
anything like that? With the older players, too:
do they feel like they have to back you up at all?
Elway: Well, it was that way a little bit before the
Boston College game. Then we had a meeting
on the Monday before the game, and just talked
between the players and the coaches. That
helped a lot of the freshmen. The older players
started patting us on the back, saying 'good job'
and stuff like that, which as a young player really
helps a lot. The team's a lot closer now.
lenkins: Do you have a nickname yetf
Elway: Ohhh, yeah. They call me Elwood, or
Durwood or stuff like that.

A new feature will grace Ihe Daily's sports
pages every Friday. Wittily named "The Friday
Interview," the piece will feature a different
sports personality every week in both a personal
and athletic light.
This week Friday interviewer Sally Jenkins
talked with lohn Elway, the freshman quarter
hack who has generated quite a lot of publicity
as well as offense. He is 16-for-32 with three
touchdowns on the year and ranks seventh in
the Pac-10 in passing.
lenkins: Why did you pick Stanford? First of all
who recruited you?
Elway: Well, I got letters from about 60 different
schools. I cut it down to about six, and took trips
to see them. I looked at Missouri, Washington,
Notre Dame, USC, San lose State and Stanford.
Stanford was the place I wanted to go because 112
tame from a high school that threw the ball a lot,
and I wanted to go someplace where I'd get to
throw the ball a lot, because that's what I like to
do, and it's one of the fun parts about football.
Stanford is known tor throwing the football, and
plus they have great academics.
lenkins: Over USC, huh? Why is that?
Elway: Veah. I would've liked to go to USC, but I
was thinking that if I went to 'SC I might get real
frustrated, cause they don't throw the ball, they
just hand the ball off.
lenkins: Since you've come here from high
school, do you feel like you've improved a
whole lot in terms of your arm and technique?
Elway: Veah; in high school, well,
tundamental-wise I have improved a lot be
cause they've worked on it'with me, and men
tally I've gained a lot bee ause I've learned a lot
read-ng defenses, and stutf like that. The har
dest thing has been the c hange in offenses, be
cause it's so difficult to learn. There's so many
different little things to it that it's taken me
a while to get it down.
lenkins: But no major problems with it?
Elway: No, not really.' It just takes time to learn it
all.
lenkins: You operated real well under pressure
last week against Boston College; you had to
duck a lot, but you still got the ball off. Did you
ever feel it?
Elway: Ahh, well we put the shotgun in last
week, which really helped a lot. It's a lot easier if
you can see the rush coming early, then you can
get out of there. They were coming in hard, but
the offensive line did a really good job.
lenkins: furk iSchonert), on the other hand got
nailed a lot. It seems to me that the best game he
had was the San lose State game where he
wasn t under a lot o! pressure. Do you think he
has trouble handling pressure?

Elway: Not really. On film you can see that he
does a really good job of getting out of it. He and
I are different that way. He likes to stay in there
and duck, and I like to get out of there and run
around. But I think he does a good job.
lenkins: How do you guys get alongt
Elway: Good. We're good friends. He helps me a
