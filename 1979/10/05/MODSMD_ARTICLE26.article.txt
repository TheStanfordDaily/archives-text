After searching from New York to Las Vegas tor this week's Guest Greek
of the Week, we at The Stanford Daily sports department decided to look
at the desk next to us. This week's cheap imitators of jimmy the Greek are
Mike Oneal and Pete Finch, the clueless editors of Cardinals Today, our
weekly football supplement distributed at all home games (including
tomorrow's). Go to it, you sophomoric sophomores:
California-Oregon — The Golden Bears look tough this year, and Rich
Campbell is what we at Cardinals Today might call a super freshman, even
though he is a junior. The Ducks are pretty inexperienced — you might
say they're "wet behind the fins."
Washington-Oregon State — Washington-OSU, huh? ... Is that Ohio
State? Oregon? Oh! You mean the Beavers. Well, the Beavers look good
this year but Washington is just too tough.
USC-Wash. State — If the Cougars had won one out of their last two
meetings with USC, we could call this the "rubber match.'' Alas, they
haven't beaten USC since 1957. Those tough Trojans are hard to beat.
UCLA-Stanford — The Cards and Bruins are coming into this game with
equal records but unequal opponents. It's gonna be tough for the Cards.
