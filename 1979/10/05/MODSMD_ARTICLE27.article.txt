Stanford's field hockey team receives its severest test of the
young season tomorrow when it travels to San lose at 10 a.m.
"They've been the dominant team in the West Coast for the last
two years," Cardinal head coach Barbara Longstreth said of the
Spartans. "We respect the fact that they have been the best, and
we're Veady to challenge them."
The Cards, currently ranked 15th in the nation, will be putting
their 5-0 record on the line against the eighth-ranked Spartans,
whose standout performer is center back Pommy McFarland, a
South African. "Besides her, they're a normal team," Stanford
co-captain Nancy Jackson commented.
This year's Stanford group is an extremely well-balanced one.
Not only is the club undefeated, but it has not yet allowed a goal
while scoring 11 of its own.
Explaining the defensive excellence, Jackson said, "Everyone
has been good from goalie on up. Not any one particular person
stands out."
On offense, however, Nancy White does stand out, as the Card
co-captain has six goals, over half the team's total output. (
