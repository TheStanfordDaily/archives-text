Oil and World Power
Peter Odell
Penguin Books
264 pp $3.95
It was a long, dry summer.
Water was not the only liquid
in short supply, however, as
most people who cancelled va
cations or had to wait in gas
lines know all too well.
America was suffering gas
pains, as painful as chronic

dyspepsia. It illustrated how
important petroleum has be
come to our way of life.
It may also account for the
success of Dr. Peter Odell s
book, Oil and World Power,
now in its fifth edition. It has
been said that future historians
will not study the internal af
fairs of Switzerland or Mexico,
but rather the developments
within AT&T and the other
giant multi-national corpora
tions. This particularly applies
to those empires which have

been built on oil.
Odell's revised book may
prove very instructive to both
lay people and people in the
energy industry. Some of his
claims are startling, though all
are well-documented. For
example, he suggests the oil
world became an unstable sys
tem shortly after the end of
World War 11.
This instability, according to
Odell, began when the United
States, through its rigorous en
forcement of anti-trust legisla

tion, affected the foreign oper
ations of American companies.
It is this sort of thought pro
voking concept which stimu
lates reader's interest. It is con
troversial enough that few
people will agree with all that
the Rotterdam professor has to
say.
Particularly interesting are
the sections on the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Odell is critical of how the Un
ited States allowed itself to be
come more dependent on
foreign oil. He cites the failure
of the government and the oil
companies to agree on tax and
price issues, and the failure to
constrain demand as reasons
for the dependence.
He contradicts the common
interpretation of the Soviet in
terest in developing third
world countries as "merely a
part of the communist world's
efforts to subvert the capitalist
world's system." Odell says
that this strictly economic exp
lanation ignores Soviet
economic interest in expand
ing its trade.
The great advantage of this
edition involves the updating
ot the section on the pet
roleum situation since 1973.
This date marks, after all, the
time from which private citi
zens began to be directly af

fected by international man
euvers in the petroleum indus
try.
A little over a decade ago,
the nations now comprising
O.P.E.C. were unimportant at
an international level. What
Odell manages to do, in this
slender volume, along with
myriad other details, is to pro
vide an introduction to why
they now have such immeasur
able clout.

'A description of the world's oil industry
demands the use of many superlatives/

The book explains the intri
cate interaction between the
"contrasting — and in some
ways conflicting — interests of
the U.S., the main producing
nations, the principal consum
ing countries of Western
Europe and Japan, the develop
ing nations, and the U.S.S.R."
This is what the author sought,
and for the most part, ac
complished.
Vet he has attempted to do
too much in too few pages. As
he says in the introduction, "A
description of the world's oil

industry demands the use of
many superlatives." It really is
too big a subject to condense
this much.
Though all popularizations
have the same problem, one
wonders whether the "via
media" is served by Odell's
approach; that fine line bet
ween thick, scholarly tomes
which inevitably gather dust in
both public and private lib
raries, and the glossy-backed

volumes bought in the local
drug store.
This introduction to the
dynamics of the oil industry is
arranged so that easy reference
is possible, with an annotated
bibliography and long index.
The text is accompanied by a
dozen maps, charts, and fi
gures. The chapter arrange
ment is, sensibly, by nation
and geographical region. The
long chapter on oil and the de
veloping Third World coun
tries is gratifying — it is good to

see an energy writer with social
awareness.
Odell is cautious when he
predicts future trends in the
industry. He is guardedly op
timistic: "The oil problem for
the future does not seem likely
to be one of a supply
bottleneck, but rather one in
which the stability of the mar
ket will have to depend upon
supply control and on increas
ingly regulated oil-supply pat
terns."
His projections deserve at
tention, for they are
empirically-derived. The au
thor, who has also written "An
Economic Geography of Oil"
and"The Pressures of Oil: A
Strategy for World Economic
Revival," has served as consul
tant to the U.K. Dept. of Energy.
Odell concludes his work
with a prognosis of coming
global change. He views the
changes in the world of oil
power as "pushing the West
ern economic and political sys
tem into the beginnings of a
New International Economic
World Order."
This highly readablebook of
fers an overview of the interna
tional oil industry, and is a
good springboard for further
energy reading.

bottleneck, but rather one in

ket will have to depend upon
supply control and on increas
ingly regulated oil-supply pat

Oil and World Power
Peter Odell
Penguin Books
264 pp $3.95
It was a long, dry summer.
Water was not the only liquid
in short supply, however, as
most people who cancelled va
cations or had to wait in gas
lines know all too well.
America was suffering gas
pains, as painful as chronic

dyspepsia. It illustrated how
important petroleum has be
come to our way of life.
It may also account for the
success of Dr. Peter Odell s
book, Oil and World Power,
now in its fifth edition. It has
been said that future historians
will not study the internal af
fairs of Switzerland or Mexico,
but rather the developments
within AT&T and the other
giant multi-national corpora
tions. This particularly applies
to those empires which have

been built on oil.
Odell's revised book may
prove very instructive to both
lay people and people in the
energy industry. Some of his
claims are startling, though all
are well-documented. For
example, he suggests the oil
world became an unstable sys
tem shortly after the end of
World War 11.
This instability, according to
Odell, began when the United
States, through its rigorous en
forcement of anti-trust legisla

tion, affected the foreign oper
ations of American companies.
It is this sort of thought pro
voking concept which stimu
lates reader's interest. It is con
troversial enough that few
people will agree with all that
the Rotterdam professor has to
say.
Particularly interesting are
the sections on the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Odell is critical of how the Un
ited States allowed itself to be
come more dependent on
foreign oil. He cites the failure
of the government and the oil
companies to agree on tax and
price issues, and the failure to
constrain demand as reasons
for the dependence.
He contradicts the common
interpretation of the Soviet in
terest in developing third
world countries as "merely a
part of the communist world's
efforts to subvert the capitalist
world's system." Odell says
that this strictly economic exp
lanation ignores Soviet
economic interest in expand
ing its trade.
The great advantage of this
edition involves the updating
ot the section on the pet
roleum situation since 1973.
This date marks, after all, the
time from which private citi
zens began to be directly af

fected by international man
euvers in the petroleum indus
try.
A little over a decade ago,
the nations now comprising
O.P.E.C. were unimportant at
an international level. What
Odell manages to do, in this
slender volume, along with
myriad other details, is to pro
vide an introduction to why
they now have such immeasur
able clout.

'A description of the world's oil industry
demands the use of many superlatives/

The book explains the intri
cate interaction between the
"contrasting — and in some
ways conflicting — interests of
the U.S., the main producing
nations, the principal consum
ing countries of Western
Europe and Japan, the develop
ing nations, and the U.S.S.R."
This is what the author sought,
and for the most part, ac
complished.
Vet he has attempted to do
too much in too few pages. As
he says in the introduction, "A
description of the world's oil

industry demands the use of
many superlatives." It really is
too big a subject to condense
this much.
Though all popularizations
have the same problem, one
wonders whether the "via
media" is served by Odell's
approach; that fine line bet
ween thick, scholarly tomes
which inevitably gather dust in
both public and private lib
raries, and the glossy-backed

volumes bought in the local
drug store.
This introduction to the
dynamics of the oil industry is
arranged so that easy reference
is possible, with an annotated
bibliography and long index.
The text is accompanied by a
dozen maps, charts, and fi
gures. The chapter arrange
ment is, sensibly, by nation
and geographical region. The
long chapter on oil and the de
veloping Third World coun
tries is gratifying — it is good to

see an energy writer with social
awareness.
Odell is cautious when he
predicts future trends in the
industry. He is guardedly op
timistic: "The oil problem for

to be one of a supply
