Heaven Can Wait ★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9 p.m.
Very wry. l ike a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent for
its success upon machination 1 - of
the plo* that come totally out of
the blue— if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Reatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistence and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —

this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.
Never again will I confuse War
ren Beatty with Clint Eastwood

Breaking Away ★★★
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable film
with few pretensions — Breaking
Away may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his ta
lent on a bicycle.

Demented Disney clones meet

Bill Murray can't even begin to

most squeaky-clean "family
comedy.'' I ots of "naughty" lines

trash trom the corporate leader
in that department — Paramount
Pictures.
— Ron Lillejord
Young Frankenstein ★★★★
Old Mill
Mel Brooks really needs Gene
Wilder (and vice versa) and this
movie makes that obvious. Wil
der wrote much ot the
screenplay, and his performance
as Doctor Frankenstein begins to
remind you ot Buster Keaton
Brooks comes close to what can
be termed "good direction" and
his use of black-and-white
photography is particularly in
spired. Marty Feldman provides
the perfect comic toil as Igor.

Casablanca ★★★★
Saturday, CubFierley « & 10 p.m.
Very obscure movie, but you
should see it. Alter all, you're
part of his work, the thing that
keeps him going. If this movie
leaves Cubberley and you're not
on it, you'll regret it. Maybe not
today, maybe not tomorrow, but
soon, and for the rest of your life.

Apocalypse Now ★★★★
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanc ed in
telligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
brilliant cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and

turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, hut
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind.
K.I
Northern lights ★★★★
Surf, San Francisco
A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
plan to think about it and not just
bask in its glow. Artful black
and-white cinematography com
bines with new directing skills
and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle lor far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 anci I9I(> Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear

The Seduction ol foe Tynan ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
Alan Alda plays a dashing
young liberal senator from New
York whose rising career begins
to leave his wile and daughter
behind. Meryl Streep plays a
talented lobbyist who picks up
the loose ends ot Alda's lite. But
in the end, well, we'll find out by
Thanksgiving. A good lilm prob
ing the problems of being both ,1
politician and a person.
Rot) Lemper!
Tree of the Wooden Clogs ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Those of you who returned
Irom the overseas campus at
Florence without getting a
chance to see the Italian coun
tryside, here's your chance. Ibis
tilm, a sedate tableau ot the peas
ant's life in Italy at the turn ot the
i entury, recreates the c olors and
smells and textures ot the far-

mers' simple lives and touching,
human needs as vividly as if you
had been there yourself. A fairly
straightforward but nonetheless
well-made tilm with sparse subti
tles because the pictures say it all.
— S.Z.
The Wanderers ★ ★★★
Metro, San Francisco
The Wanderers, an intimately
surreal look at a New York street
gang in the early '60s, is my can
didate for the best movie of the
past summer.
This movie's closest brother is
Ihe Deer Hunter — In theme,
not in degree of grimness. Gang
warfare has been substituted for
The Deer Hunter's Vietnam
sequences, but the same em
phasis on male camaraderie and
on late set seemingly irrevocably
by the characters' surroundings
is present here.
But the "look" of this film is
like thai of no other. Director
Philip Kautman creates his own
personal New York Crty, filled
with grotesques and occasional
Hashes of warmth.

Tree of the Wooden Clogs ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Those of you who returned
Irom the overseas campus at
Florence without getting a
chance to see the Italian coun
tryside, here's your chance. Ibis
tilm, a sedate tableau ot the peas
ant's life in Italy at the turn ot the
i entury, recreates the c olors and
smells and textures ot the far-

mers' simple lives and touching,
human needs as vividly as if you
had been there yourself. A fairly
straightforward but nonetheless
well-made tilm with sparse subti
tles because the pictures say it all.

The Wanderers ★ ★★★
Metro, San Francisco
The Wanderers, an intimately
surreal look at a New York street
gang in the early '60s, is my can
didate for the best movie of the
past summer.
This movie's closest brother is
Ihe Deer Hunter — In theme,
not in degree of grimness. Gang
warfare has been substituted for
The Deer Hunter's Vietnam
sequences, but the same em
phasis on male camaraderie and
on late set seemingly irrevocably
by the characters' surroundings
is present here.
But the "look" of this film is
like thai of no other. Director
Philip Kautman creates his own
personal New York Crty, filled
with grotesques and occasional
Hashes of warmth.

Heaven Can Wait ★★★
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9 p.m.
Very wry. l ike a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent for
its success upon machination 1 - of
the plo* that come totally out of
the blue— if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Reatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistence and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off
its inferiority to the original —

this is a thoughtful reintroduc
tion to a far more intelligent kind
of comedy than that which is cur
rently the norm. Very good.

Mel Brooks really needs Gene

his use of black-and-white

Producer-director Francis Cop

Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
brilliant cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and

turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri

almost untenable ambitions, hut
