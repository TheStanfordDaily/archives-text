Pope opposes women as priests
Chicago — Pope John Paul II took his plea for the
simple life and traditional Roman Catholic moral
ity across this "spacious land" yesterday. He
traveled from historic Philadelphia to the
cornfields of lowa and then to this most Polish of
American cities.
In Philadelphia and here, the pope reminded
priests that celibacy is inviolable church doctrine.
He spoke, too, of other issues explosive to Ameri
can Catholicism, saying that the priesthood is not
for womeij and that men who take priestly vows
should not expect to escape them.
"Priesthooa is forever," he said in Philadelphia.
And on a hilltop altar in lowa, he reminded far
mers in the nation's breadbasket to conserve the
land for future generations and to be generous to
the world's famished.
At the cathedral, he again spoke of the "needy
of the world," as he had in lowa, and in remarks
prepared for delivery to Catholic brothers at St.
Peter's Church he repeated his call for fidelity to
the rule of celibacy.
Senate approves energy board
Washington — The Senate, handing President
|immy Cartef a major victory on energy policy,
voted yesterday to create a powerful new agency
with broad powers to speed U.S. energy de
velopment.
Approved by a 68-25 vote was legislation that
would set up a four-member Energy Mobilization
Board that is intended to cut red tape blocking
construction of oil refineries, pipelines,
multibillion-dollar synthetic fuel plants and other
.facilities.
Carter proposed a series of new energy mea
sures in a nationally broadcast speech July 15. The
board is the first of his proposals to have reached
the Senate floor.
The president's supporters said a board with
unprecedented powers is needed if the nation is
to develop new energy sources and reduce its
dependency on toreign oil.
Environmentalists and states' rights advocates
said the board would interfere with the rights of
affected communities to decide if dirty or danger
ous energy plants should be built in their
neighborhoods.
BART starts limited service
San Francisco — Wary commuters were treated
to limited train service yesterday run by managers
of the Bay Area Rapid Transit district after a five
week shutdown in a contract dispute.

Security forces were increased in the fears of
possible confrontations between management
and union workers but no incidents were re
ported.
Some 18,300 passengers traveled BART on a
shortened stretch of a single trans-bay line, repre
senting slightly more than 10 percent of the
165,000 average full-service ridership, BART offi
cials annouced.
BART officials have said they could maintain the
reduced service indefinitely, although union offi
cials contend routine maintenance problems will
eventually force the system to a halt.
BART has said union members cannot return to
work without an agreement on working condi
tions, either in a formal contract or a preliminary
understanding.
Meanwhile, BART and union leaders agreed to
resume negotiations Tuesday for the first time
since a 10-minute session Sept. 13, although
neither side expects a quick settlement.
Carter camp hits at Kennedy
Washington — President Jimmy Carter's cam
paign committee, alarmed over opposition money
being funneled into Florida, filed a formal com
plaint yesterday with the Federal Election Com
mission in an effort to dampen the "draft Ken
nedy" movement.
In its complaint to the FEC, tTie Carter commit
tee said national fundraising in support of efforts
to draft Sen. Edward Kennedy for the Democratic
presidential nomination is being coordinated and
therefore is illegal.
"The national Kennedy committees, in the vari
ous states and in their various fundraising and
targeting operations are about as unaffiliated as
the Marx Brothers," Carter Campaign Manager
Tim Kraft said in a news conference announcing
the action.
It was the Carter campaign's first major assault
against the movement to draft Kennedy for the
Democratic nomination and reflected growing
concern over the expected Kennedy challenge.
Candidates are limited by law to one "principle
campaign committee." But if the Kennedy
draft committees are held to be independent of
one another, a person who could give Carter only
$1000 could contribute as much as $25,000 for
Kennedy by spreading it around in chunks of no
more than $5000 each. Other political committees
could give unlimited sums in amounts of $5000 to
every draft Kennedy committee.

NRC urges TMI water cleanup
Washington — The staff of the Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission yesterday urged a go-ahead with
decontaminating radioactive wastes at Three Mile
Island, despite opposition to such a move from
some neighbors of the damaged nuclear power
plant.
The highly radioactive waste water at the plant
near Harrisburg, Pa., has been increasing at the
rate of 1500 gallons a day and NRC and utility
officials say available storage will run out by the
end of the month.
Harold Denton, the NRC's director of nuclear
reactor regulation, told the commission that the
decontamination process should begin as soon as
possible, even though questions remain over how
to solidify the radioactive resins that remain after
decontamination.
Orioles outlast Angel rally, 9-8
Baltimore — Eddie Murray drove in four
runs with a single and a homer as the Baltimore
Orioles scored eight runs in the first two innings
and survived a late rally to edge the California
Angels 9-8 yesterday.
After trailing 9-1 in the second game of the
best-of-five series, the Angels scored seven runs in
the last four innings and had the bases loaded in
the ninth before reliever Don Stanhouse retired
Brian Downing on a force play for the final out.
The victory, behind the nine-hit pitching of
Mike Flanagan and Stanhouse, gave the Orioles a
2-0 lead in the best-of-five American League
championship series which continues on the West
Coast tonight.
