# Students examine Senator's policies
## Kennedy supporters organize movement 
### Richard Hefter 
While Kennedy remains uncom
mitted about his possible presiden
tial candidacy, the bandwagon of his
supporters here is already beginning
to roll.
The Stanford Students for Ken
nedy is a movement recently formed
to attract students here and
throughout California to a Kennedy
for President campaign.
Senior Peter Stamos, director of
the group, explained, "Should Ken
nedy decide to run, we will have the
network established in California
. . ~ the manpower in motion."
The six founding members of the
movement had an unofficial meeting
earlier this week at which they discus
sed the basic framework for the
group's organization.

According to Stamos, each
member's importance is determined
by how much effort he wants to
exert.
'Structured flexibility'
Stamos is emphasizing "structured
flexibility and rotating responsibil
ity" in organizing the movement.
"Different people will be responsi
ble for examining the different
policies of the senator. We will have
resource people on each of the
major issues," he said.
The group may be sending stu
dents to Florida in mid-October to
work with the Florida Kennedy
Committee in a straw vote. Accord
ing to Stamos, the group has an "of
ficial link" with the Florida move
ment through Allard Lowenstein,

the University's former assistant
dean of men in the early 19605.
Lowenstein, former U.N. ambas
sador on human rights under the
Carter administration, former con
gressman from New York and a close
friend of Kennedy, is speaking
throughout Florida to gather support
for Kennedy.
Florida financing
"Lowenstein is not recruiting Stan
ford students, but he would wel
come our support in working for
Kennedy in Florida," Stamos said.
"There is a possibility that the Florida
committee will finance the trip for
one Stanford student.
"The straw vote in both Florida and
lowa is extremely important to us,"
he said. "If Kennedy wins big in the
polls, the tide will have turned ir
revocably in his favor by (the) New
Hampshire (primary)."
The consensus of the group is that
Kennedy is the best candidate for
president because America is in a
leadership crisis. Kennedy, they feel,
can fulfill this leadership void.
Inaction
"Carter has good ideas," said
Stamos, "but the record is clear that
he has not been able to put these
ideas to action.
"Kennedy can reinstate confi
dence in our country's leadership.
He can motivate the public and direct
Congress."
Graduate student Larry Diamond,
another group member, said, "Ted
will have massive student support
unlike anything we've seen since
1%9. I want to establish this support
at Stanford.
Some of the members of the
movement have already registered
the group with the ASSU and Office
of Student Affairs, according to
Stamos. "The enthusiasm of the
members is fantastic," he said.
Stamos said the group will do
studies on Kennedy's policies and
senatorial record, determine his rela
tive strengths and weaknesses and
then feed this information to the na
tional movement for Kennedy if he
decides to run.

They will also hold a voter registra
tion drive here, Stamos said.
In addition, Law Prof. William
Gould, a strong supporter of Robert
Kennedy in 1968, will speak about
Ted Kennedy at the group's first offi
cial meeting Thursday.
