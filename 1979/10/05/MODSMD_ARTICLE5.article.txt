Rock star Dave Mason will headline a concert in Stanford's 1700-seat
Memorial Auditorium following the Big Game Nov. 17, ASSU Special Events
announced yesterday.
The event marks the third straight year ASSU has held a concert on Big
Game weekend. In 1977, Frank Zappa played to a sold-out house in Maples
Pavilion while last year's concert featured Parliament/Funkadelfc.
Formerly of the group Traffic, Mason normally performs in concert halls at
least four times the size of Memorial Auditorium. According to Special
Events Director John Harris, Mason declined an invitation to play Frost
Amphitheater last spring and canceled a scheduled summer appearance at
the 8000-seat Concord Pavilion in the East Bay.
According to Harris, Mason is now recording an album in Los Angeles and
agreed to play Big Game night in the small hall as part of a series of selected
college dates in California. His upcoming performance here will be an
exclusive Bay-Area appearance and Mason's first concert in the area this
year.
Tickets for the concert will go on sale Oct. 12, at Tresidder Ticket Office.
Showtime is 7:30 p.m. A second show may be added.
