# Frats face possible placement in Draw
## Quota deadline today 
### Carol Ozawa 
Two University fraternities are in
danger of having to turn their houses
over to the University draw system
this year if the fraternity system tails
today to meet its new-resident
quota.
"As of Sept. 21, the fraternity sys
tem as a whole had a quota of 240
sophomore equivalents," said Diana
Conklin, assistant director of Resi
dential Education. She said that, as of
yesterday, the system had pledged
236 sophomore equivalents.
According to the Office of Resi
dential Education, one sophomore
equivalent is "a student who is enti
tled to, but has not yet used, his two
guaranteed years of housing." A stu
dent with one remaining guaranteed
year counts as one-half point in the
system.
Fraternities acquire points through
pledges during the preliminary rush
in spring and the more informal rush
for transfer students in the fall.
Each fraternity is also assigned a
particular quota, which is basically

determined by the number of
sophomores they can comfortably
house," said )ohn Kinney, president
of the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Theta Xi threatened
If the fraternity system does not
meet the quota, then the Office of
Residential Education may place the
house with the greatest individual
deficit over the previous two years
into the draw system.
Last November, Theta Xi, which
missed its quota in 1975, 1977 and
1978, could have been placed into
the Draw because the fraternity sys
tem missed its overall quota in both
1977 and 1978. The fraternity was,
however, given one more chance.
"As of the present time, we have
9.5 equivalents out of our 11.5 quota.
We're looking hard," said Ralph
Munson of Theta Xi Tuesday.
Flowever
Theta Xi President Bill Boone said
last night, however, that the frater
nity has now signed four pledges
with one remaining guaranteed year
each, which gives the house the two
points it needed to reach its quota.
"We went out and beat the
bushes," Boone said. "We have
exactly what we need." He said the
fraternity would turn the new mem
bers' pledge cards in to the Housing
Office today.
According to Scott Martin of Alpha
Delta Phi, which missed its quota in
1976 and 1978, the Alpha Delts have
acquired 18.5 sophomore equiva
lents of its quota of 22.
Were Theta Xi to make quota and
Alpha Delts to miss quota, Alpha
Delts would be the next most vulner
able fraternity for placement into the
draw system.
Quota system
The "sophomore equivalent"
quota system arose out of the Uni
versity's Guaranteed Housing Plan,
which went into effect in 1975. The
housing plan applies to all University
residences in the draw and fraternity
systems.
Under the plan, a student who en
ters the University as a freshman is
guaranteed housing for three of his
four years, "provided that he agrees
to accept any space to which he may
be assigned."
All transfer students are guaran
teed housing for their first year here.
All those who transfer here as
sophomores are guaranteed one ad
ditional year.
Frats no different
"No student in Stanford resi-
dences, including fraternities, can be
guaranteed more than two years of
on-campus housing beyond the
freshman year," state the regula
tions.
To be able to guarantee some on
campus housing to all students, the
housing plan requires that the
fraternity system pledge 16-1/3 per
cent of the freshmen men and male
transfer students. The Housing Of
fice thus devised the "sophomore
equivalent" system.
If one or several of the 13 frater
nities fail to meet quota, but the
fraternity system as a whole pledges
240 sophomore equivalents, then the
fraternities are considered to have
fulfilled the obligation.
Draw placement
However, it the system fails to
pledge 240 sophomore equivalents
for two consecutive years, the frater
nity with the greatest share of the
deficit over the previous two years
may face placement into the draw
system.
"Sometimes a fraternity chooses
not to meet its quota; sometimes it
can't," Conklin said. "This is not
good for the system as a whole be
cause the real burden falls on the
house with the greatest deficit.
"Some fraternities see this (being
placed into the draw system) as a real
defeat because their status as selec
tive houses is endangered," she
explained.

If a house is placed into the drav
system, the University takes over tht
responsibility of filling the house
Conklin said. "The members of tht
fraternity can still live in the house
They can still have the fraternity.
Their house is just draw-filled, no
rush-filled.
No provision exists, however, fore
fraternity to resume its former status
once its allotment procedures have
been assumed by the draw system,
Kinney noted. "(Theta Xi) could be
reconsidered if the fraternity system
as a whole makes its quota next
year."
If not, re-entry would be virtually
impossible for a hapless fraternity,
he said, because of the proliferation
of sororities and special priority
groups desirous of housing.

"As of Sept. 21, the fraternity sys
tem as a whole had a quota of 240
sophomore equivalents," said Diana
Conklin, assistant director of Resi
dential Education. She said that, as of
yesterday, the system had pledged
236 sophomore equivalents.
According to the Office of Resi
dential Education, one sophomore
equivalent is "a student who is enti
tled to, but has not yet used, his two
guaranteed years of housing." A stu
dent with one remaining guaranteed
year counts as one-half point in the
system.
Fraternities acquire points through
pledges during the preliminary rush
in spring and the more informal rush
for transfer students in the fall.
Each fraternity is also assigned a
particular quota, which is basically

determined by the number of
sophomores they can comfortably
house," said )ohn Kinney, president
of the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Theta Xi threatened
If the fraternity system does not
meet the quota, then the Office of
Residential Education may place the
house with the greatest individual
deficit over the previous two years
into the draw system.
Last November, Theta Xi, which
missed its quota in 1975, 1977 and
1978, could have been placed into
the Draw because the fraternity sys
tem missed its overall quota in both
1977 and 1978. The fraternity was,
however, given one more chance.
"As of the present time, we have
9.5 equivalents out of our 11.5 quota.
We're looking hard," said Ralph
Munson of Theta Xi Tuesday.
Flowever
Theta Xi President Bill Boone said
last night, however, that the frater
nity has now signed four pledges
with one remaining guaranteed year
each, which gives the house the two
points it needed to reach its quota.
"We went out and beat the
bushes," Boone said. "We have
exactly what we need." He said the
fraternity would turn the new mem
bers' pledge cards in to the Housing
Office today.
According to Scott Martin of Alpha
Delta Phi, which missed its quota in
1976 and 1978, the Alpha Delts have
acquired 18.5 sophomore equiva
lents of its quota of 22.
Were Theta Xi to make quota and
Alpha Delts to miss quota, Alpha
Delts would be the next most vulner
able fraternity for placement into the
draw system.
Quota system
The "sophomore equivalent"
quota system arose out of the Uni
versity's Guaranteed Housing Plan,
which went into effect in 1975. The
housing plan applies to all University
residences in the draw and fraternity
systems.
Under the plan, a student who en
ters the University as a freshman is
guaranteed housing for three of his
four years, "provided that he agrees
to accept any space to which he may
be assigned."
All transfer students are guaran
teed housing for their first year here.
All those who transfer here as
sophomores are guaranteed one ad
ditional year.
Frats no different
"No student in Stanford resi-
dences, including fraternities, can be
guaranteed more than two years of
on-campus housing beyond the
freshman year," state the regula
tions.
To be able to guarantee some on
campus housing to all students, the
housing plan requires that the
fraternity system pledge 16-1/3 per
cent of the freshmen men and male
transfer students. The Housing Of
fice thus devised the "sophomore
equivalent" system.
If one or several of the 13 frater
nities fail to meet quota, but the
fraternity system as a whole pledges
240 sophomore equivalents, then the
fraternities are considered to have
fulfilled the obligation.
Draw placement
However, it the system fails to
pledge 240 sophomore equivalents
for two consecutive years, the frater
nity with the greatest share of the
deficit over the previous two years
may face placement into the draw
system.
"Sometimes a fraternity chooses
not to meet its quota; sometimes it
can't," Conklin said. "This is not
good for the system as a whole be
cause the real burden falls on the
house with the greatest deficit.
"Some fraternities see this (being
placed into the draw system) as a real
defeat because their status as selec
tive houses is endangered," she
explained.

If a house is placed into the drav
system, the University takes over tht
responsibility of filling the house
Conklin said. "The members of tht
fraternity can still live in the house
They can still have the fraternity.
Their house is just draw-filled, no
rush-filled.
No provision exists, however, fore
fraternity to resume its former status
once its allotment procedures have
been assumed by the draw system,
Kinney noted. "(Theta Xi) could be
reconsidered if the fraternity system
as a whole makes its quota next
year."
If not, re-entry would be virtually
impossible for a hapless fraternity,
he said, because of the proliferation
of sororities and special priority
groups desirous of housing.
Two University fraternities are in
danger of having to turn their houses
over to the University draw system
this year if the fraternity system tails
today to meet its new-resident
quota.
