# After Alpha Delt-administration clash, rainbow moves indoors
## 
### 
The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
turned to lead for members of the Alpha Delta
Phi fraternity this fall as the colorful facade of
their house met with an unappreciative ad
ministration order to paint it over.
As a replacement, another rainbow design
has been painted in the fraternity's living
room by Alpha Delt Gil Morales, the creator of
"Dupie" and the original rainbow at the
house.
Painted early last fall as a project for the 1978
pledges, the rainbow served as a theme for
house parties held there last year and as an
easily recognizable landmark for the house.
But once the rainbow's existence was
brought to the attention of the administra
tion, the order soon went out to paint it dver.
"It was there for awhile before it was
noticed," said Diana Conklin, assistant direc
tor of residential education. Such exterior
murals are rarely approved by the University,
she said, and had the Alpha Delts asked per
mission to put up the design, it probably
would have been denied.
Administrators said the painting was inhar
monious with the University's style of ar
chitecture.
Despite the fraternity's pleas, the order
to return the building to its original state re

mained in force. And after the University said
it would soon paint over the rainbow and send
the fraternity the bill, the members saved ser
vice operations the trouble and did the job
themselves just before school began.
just a few days later, the 20-foot-long
living-room rainbow went up and a "Dupie"
figure, shown squeezing a tube of paint at the
start of the design, was added shortly thereaf
ter to the wall.
Alpha Delt Vice President Nathan Sarkisian
said house members were upset by the order
to paint over the design. He said the reaction
to the rainbow had been favorable from per
sons here and from visiting parents.
"just about everybody we talked to liked
it," Sarkisian said. "We wanted it to stay."
Although the fraternity last year protested
the building of an extension to Lomita Drive
that was scheduled to pass their house by
collecting more than 1000 signatures on a peti
tion to President Richard Lyman, the mem
bers decided this issue didn't warrant a similar
reaction, one house member said.
Although the new addition to the house is
not visible from outside, it is just as valued by
house members as a trademark of the frater
nity.
"We definitely want it to stay," said frater
nity member Doug Clark.
