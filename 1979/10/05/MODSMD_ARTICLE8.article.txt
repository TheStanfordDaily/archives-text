# Stanford's first coed house
##

There were some difficult times in the
new dorm. A young male was once seen
leaving a girl's room late at night. "A
special camaraderie existed within the
Grove Project House, and we decided to
keep the incident quiet,' says Jonathan
Reider, who lived in the house at the time.
The time was just 14 years ago — and the
place was right here at Stanford, in the first
coed dorm in a school on the West
Coast.
Students at the University generally take
coed housing for granted. However, it was
not so long ago that all men and women
lived in separate residences.
The first coed house here came in 1966,
as an indirect result of the actions of a
fraternity, when the house was vacated in
the middle of the year.
In that year, Phi Delta Theta had gained
an undesirable reputation among adminis
trators after purportedly vandalizing the
school and disrupting the operations of
the Daily. In its most infamous moment,
the fraternity had a party that degenerated

into what the San Francisco Chronicle
somewhat sensationally termed an "orgy"
with a group of women from Mills College
in Oakland.
After the incident, the University sus
pended all of the members of the frater
nity for one year, and the administration
found itself with an empty house.
Reider, now a resident fellow in Flor
ence Moore Hall, was a student here in
1966.
According to Reider, the University de
cided to make a theme house out of this
empty residence. However, "the theme
was not going to be an ethnic one, but
rather an intellectual one," Reider said.
Grove Project, the house formerly oc
cupied by the Phi Delts, received much
publicity. Not only were all of the RA's
going to be from foreign countries, but for
the first time in any school on the West
Coast, there were going to be men and
women living in the same house. After an
application process, 31 men as well as 12
women were selected.
According to Reider, "The University

•
wanted us to play it down, but the outside
continued to give it publicity. People like
the editor of the Christian Science
Monitor, the president of Yale University
and others came to visit to see if it was
working out."
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall, who
also is a resident fellow in Florence Moore,
was the fellow of the first coed house. He
was one of the people who originated the
idea of having men and women living to
gether here.
"The students handled the situation
very well," said Mancall, "and it ended up
by being a lot-of fun."
Reider said he feels that the creation of
coed dorms alleviated the pressure that
existed between the sexes. "It used to be
that on October 1, guys would start worry
ing about whether they had dates for the
Big Game at the end of November. Coed
dorms have removed the rigid customs that
once existed."
Mancall added, "Of course there was a
certain amount of objection, but as you
can see by the University today, the idea of
coed dorms worked out very well."
