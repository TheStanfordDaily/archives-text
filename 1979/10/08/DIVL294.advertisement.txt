NATIONAL LAMPOON'S
It's October and the leaves are turning brown. It is a season of
change — the clear, cold death of winter shines ahead of us.
Soon we will be able to see our breath, frisk with small dogs in
the snow, and roll our cars over on patches of black ice. With '
winter approaching and good jokes sure to be as scarce as
summer birds, now is the time to lay in a winter's supply of
jokes in the new October comedy issue of National Lampoon;
and as for summer birds, you can probably mail away for them
to Florida. Yes, the National Lampoon Comedy issue has
enough rich, plump guffaws to keep you chortling right into
spring. So go buy one now at your local newsstand or
bookstore before David Frost starts nipping people's noses,
making it a pain to go outside.
