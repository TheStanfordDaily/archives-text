Respect your feet
They got you where
you are today
There are a whole mess of bones in your feet.
Fifty-two to be exact.
To take proper care of all of them, you need a good
pair of shoes.
Like the one you see below. A Rockport.
That bottom is not one big hunk of crepe. It's eight
separate layers. This makes the bottom softer. More
flexible. Easier on your feet.
And that shoe won't rub your foot the wrong way,
either. Because inside is a full leather lining that's been
specially tanned to make it soft and comfy.
