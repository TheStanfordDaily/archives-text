The Daily welcomes letters and opinions on
subjects of interest to members of the Stanford
community. All submissions must be typed
double-spaced on a 57-space line with two in
ches of space left at the top and bottom of each
page. Non-erasable paper should be used and
corrections must be made in pencil, not pen.
In deciding which opinions will be printed
each day, the opinions editors take a number of
factors into account. Of utmost importance is
that the article be clear and concise. Articles
which exceed 80 lines with a 57-space margin are
often given lower priority because of the large
numbers of letters and opinions submitted
every day to this office.
We attempt to give space to both sides of as
many issues as possible, and the best way to see
your views in print is to keep to the point.
Though exceptions are occasionally made —
for issues we consider to be of particular impor
tance to the community — submissions longer
j| than 100 lines are rarely printed. ||
