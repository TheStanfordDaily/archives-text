# From 56 yds, Naber puts foot in UCLA mouth
## 
### Chris Haft 
At halftime of Saturday's
Stanford-UCLA football game,
Cardinal head coach Rod
Dowhower told his players that
there were no heroes on their
team. Then Ken Naber proved
Dowhower wrong.
Kicking against the wind and
the odds, Naber drove a 56-
yard field goal that shaved the
left upright of the goal post and
gave Stanford a thrilling 27-24
triumph in the last six seconds
of the Pacific-10 Conference
opener for both teams.
Many men made the game
the exciting, memorable spec
tacle that it was: John Elway,
Vincent White and Gordon
Banks, among others, per
formed outstandingly. But in
the end, Naber and his kick
rose above everybody.
Dowhower, emotionally
drained after witnessing such a
miracle, recovered for a mo
ment when asked about
Naber. "His leg has been
strong all year," Dowhower
said, "but 56 yards! My gosh,
that's unreal!"
Confidence
Fans often sneer, "No
chance," when they see a

kicker prepare to attempt an
inordinately long field goal
such as Naber's game-winner.
In fact, Naber didn't even
see his own creation, as he was
knocked down by Elway, his
jubilant holder. "It looked like
it was gonna go through,"
Naber said, "but John came up
and hit me, so I never really
saw it go through."
Yet Naber knew — and has
known for a while — that he
could kick one 56 yards.
Naber had been practicing
and hitting 55-to-60 yard kicks
toward the latter part of last
week during practice. "We
knew we could go that far,"
Naber said. "It was just a mat
ter of getting a chance to kick
it." The slight breeze blowing
into his face, he added, did not
bother him.
What made Naber's 56-
yarder somewhat ironic was
the fact that he had missed
three-pointers from 29 and 48
yards in the first half.
"I don't know," Naber said
when asked to explain his mis
cues. "Maybe it was just the
excitement. I took my eye off it
(the ball) the first two kicks.
"At halftime I tried to get my

self together, and I did," Naber
added.
No 'lightning'
UCLA had a chance to kick a
winning field goal of its own
with just 1:11 remaining when
Peter Boermeester lined up for
a 40-yard attempt. Boermees
ter, of course, hit a 37-yarder
with 27 seconds left last season
to beat Stanford 27-26.
But thanks to Gary Wimmer
and Banks, lightning didn't
strike twice. Banks, who
blocked a field goal try last
week against Boston College,
deflected Boermeester's kick,
which then fluttered sickly
downfield.
Foiling a field goal requires a
certain artfullness, and Wim
mer supplied it."He (Wimmer)
is to my left (on field goals) to
try and pull the 'up' back with
him so I can get a clear shot at
the ball," Banks explained.
"He did a hell of a job, so I got a
clear shot at it."
Last minute
Boermeester's miss set up
Stanford's shot at victory. Tak
ing over at their own 23, the
Cards began plainly by sending
fullback Jim Brown into the line

Stanford placekicker Ken Naber (10) and holder |ohn Elvvay (7) are surrounded by their jubilant teammates after Naber's in
credible 56-yard field goal, with no time on the clock, beat UCLA 27-24. Naber's booming kick was the second longest in
Cardinal history, three yards short of Rod Carcia's 59-yarder against USC six years ago.
