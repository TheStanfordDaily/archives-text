# From 56 yds, Naber puts foot in UCLA mouth
## 
### Chris Haft 
At halftime of Saturday's
Stanford-UCLA football game,
Cardinal head coach Rod
Dowhower told his players that
there were no heroes on their
team. Then Ken Naber proved
Dowhower wrong.
Kicking against the wind and
the odds, Naber drove a 56-
yard field goal that shaved the
left upright of the goal post and
gave Stanford a thrilling 27-24
triumph in the last six seconds
of the Pacific-10 Conference
opener for both teams.
Many men made the game
the exciting, memorable spec
tacle that it was: John Elway,
Vincent White and Gordon
Banks, among others, per
formed outstandingly. But in
the end, Naber and his kick
rose above everybody.
Dowhower, emotionally
drained after witnessing such a
miracle, recovered for a mo
ment when asked about
Naber. "His leg has been
strong all year," Dowhower
said, "but 56 yards! My gosh,
that's unreal!"
Confidence
Fans often sneer, "No
chance," when they see a

kicker prepare to attempt an
inordinately long field goal
such as Naber's game-winner.
In fact, Naber didn't even
see his own creation, as he was
knocked down by Elway, his
jubilant holder. "It looked like
it was gonna go through,"
Naber said, "but John came up
and hit me, so I never really
saw it go through."
Yet Naber knew — and has
known for a while — that he
could kick one 56 yards.
Naber had been practicing
and hitting 55-to-60 yard kicks
toward the latter part of last
week during practice. "We
knew we could go that far,"
Naber said. "It was just a mat
ter of getting a chance to kick
it." The slight breeze blowing
into his face, he added, did not
bother him.
What made Naber's 56-
yarder somewhat ironic was
the fact that he had missed
three-pointers from 29 and 48
yards in the first half.
"I don't know," Naber said
when asked to explain his mis
cues. "Maybe it was just the
excitement. I took my eye off it
(the ball) the first two kicks.
"At halftime I tried to get my

self together, and I did," Naber
added.
No 'lightning'
UCLA had a chance to kick a
winning field goal of its own
with just 1:11 remaining when
Peter Boermeester lined up for
a 40-yard attempt. Boermees
ter, of course, hit a 37-yarder
with 27 seconds left last season
to beat Stanford 27-26.
But thanks to Gary Wimmer
and Banks, lightning didn't
strike twice. Banks, who
blocked a field goal try last
week against Boston College,
deflected Boermeester's kick,
which then fluttered sickly
downfield.
Foiling a field goal requires a
certain artfullness, and Wim
mer supplied it."He (Wimmer)
is to my left (on field goals) to
try and pull the 'up' back with
him so I can get a clear shot at
the ball," Banks explained.
"He did a hell of a job, so I got a
clear shot at it."
Last minute
Boermeester's miss set up
Stanford's shot at victory. Tak
ing over at their own 23, the
Cards began plainly by sending
fullback Jim Brown into the line

Stanford placekicker Ken Naber (10) and holder |ohn Elvvay (7) are surrounded by their jubilant teammates after Naber's in
credible 56-yard field goal, with no time on the clock, beat UCLA 27-24. Naber's booming kick was the second longest in
Cardinal history, three yards short of Rod Carcia's 59-yarder against USC six years ago.
for two yards.
Then Stanford released its
newest weapon, the shotgun
formation, from its holster.
With Elway pulling the trigger,
the Cards began to move.
The sparkling freshman,
who completed 16 of 23 passes
for 178 yards, threw to Mike
Dotterer for 10 yards and a first
down. Vincent White churned
across the field for nine more
yards, after which Stanford cal
led time out with 38 seconds
left.
Again from the shotgun,
Elway fired to Dotterer in the
right flat. Dotterer used a fine
Mike Neill block and made a
couple of sharp cuts to gain 17
yards to the Bruin 39.
Trying to penetrate to within
conventional field goal range,
Elway completed one to Brown
for no gain. Stanford was
forced to call its last time out
and utilize sideline patterns to
stop the clock. Passes to Andre
Tyler and Pat Bowe failed. The
next play, involving Naber,
didn't.
Aborted rout ,
A last-second finish ap
peared an unlikely prospect at
the outset. On third-and-six at
Stanford's 24-yard line, White
took an innocent-looking sc
reen pass from Turk Schonert
and turned it into a bomb, slic
ing past a Bruin at the 30 and
going down the sideline to
UCLA's 48.
The Cards, who performed
efficiently on third down all
day, established that pattern
moments later on third-arid
nine from the Bruin 47 as
Schonert whipped one to Ken
Margerum for 15 yards.
Then with 11:17 left in the
first quarter UCLA was blinded
by another White flash — Vin
cent, that is. Coming out of the
backfield, White was never
picked up and easily took
Schonert's pass into the end
zone. •
The Bruins came back un
daunted, needing just seven
plays to go 77 yards for the
tying score, a one-yard run by
quarterback Rick Bashore.
After Bashore's touchdown,
however, Stanford took more
than just the kickoff. First the
Cards received 15 yards on a de
fensive holding penalty that
transported them into Bruin
territory.
Then on first down from the
UCLA 37, Schonert threw deep
down the sideline to Tyler,
who was running stride for
stride with defensive halfback
Phil Hubbard.
Hubbard reacted with a play
that would have been fine in
volleyball, as he bobbled — er,
set the ball to Tyler. Tyler in
turn, did the proper thing for a
football player to do, catching
the ball at the five and continu
ing into the end zone.

Passing the ball seems to
have an unhealthy effect on the
Bruins. They hungrily watch
other teams take to the air, but
when they try it themselves
they often cough the ball up.
Bashore displayed this ten
dency late in the first quarter,
throwing a poor pass that Card
linebacker Milt McColl inter
cepted.
Now with fine field position
at the Bruin 34, Stanford mas
saged UCLA's back rather than
break it. Schonert, who com
pleted 10 of 13 passes for 152
yards, made one of his few mis
takes and threw into a pack of
white jerseys. Linebacker Ar
thur Akers intercepted as the
first quarter and dreams of a
Stanford rout ended.
Exciting drive
The tally remained Stanford
14, UCLA 7 throughout the
second quarter, but the inactiv
ity on the scoreboard belied
the action on the field as Elway
entered the game.
Dowhower stated after the
game that he intended to use
Schonert during the first and
third quarters and Elway
through the second and fourth
stanzas. So Elway's entrance
was planned, but the excite
ment that he created was spon
taneous.
Elway's tenure started
quietly, with a two-yard gain by
Brown. Almost nobody
noticed that the Cards didn't
huddle after that play, but went
straight to the line of scrim
mage. As Stanford continued
to inexorably gain yardage,
though, all eyes watched the
men in Cardinal red and white.
Stanford picked up three
quick first downs on Elway's
two strikes to White and one to
Margerum, all without a hud
dle.
Before the Bruins figured out
which way was up, Brown car
ried for another first down and
Elway scooted for still another
to the UCLA 29. Like a basket
ball coach who sees his team
succumbing to the opposi
tion's momentum, UCLA head
coach Terry Donahue had to
call time out.

The Cards stalled at the
UCLA 12, and Naber missed a
29-yard field goal attempt, but
if nothing else, Stanford's drive
made an Elway fan out of
Donahue.
"John Elway? He's not a good
player," Donahue said. "He'sa
great player."
Bruin surge
After the resurrection of
Chief (nee Prince) Lightfoot at
halftime, Stanford increased its
lead to 17-7 with 10:40 remain
ing in third quarter on Naber's
29-yard field goal. A fine 20-
yard burst by White was the
drive's key play.
This aroused the Bruin of
fense, also known as Freeman
McNeil. UCLA regained pos
session and drove from its own
20 to Stanford's six as McNeil
gained 54 of those 74 yards.
The Bruins seemed destined
for six points, but they had to
settle for Boermeester's 32-
yard field goal after Rick Parker
blind-sided Bashore for a
nine-yard loss.
However, the way McNeil
was running — he finished
with 197 yards on 36carries, the
third-best rushing perfor
mance in UCLA history — it
was a matter of time before he
found the end zone. And that
he did, capping an 80-yard
drive by sweeping left for a 16-

yard touchdown with 11:20 left
to play.
Boermeester's conversion
kick knotted the score at 17-17,
and the stage was set for the
third consecutive Stanford-
UCLA heart-stopper. .
Blitzing kills
Returning at quarterback
after sitting out the third quar
ter, Elway loosened up his arm
with a 60-yard incompletion to
Margerum that portended the
power Stanford's offense
would soon display.
A battering end run by
Brown, a 16-yard bullet to Dot
terer, a well-thrown pass from
Elway to Tyler and White's six
yard run off right tackle each
gave the Cards first downs and
moved them to the Bruin 17.
On second down at the 17
Elway lined up in his shotgun,
but as soon as the ball was
snapped he faced a horde of
blitzing Bruins coming right
down the barrel.
Quickly Elway tossed one to
White, standing all alone at the
10. White caught the ball and
hesitated for a moment,
amazed that none of the Bruins
had paid any attention to him.
Finally he ran in tor the score,
temporarily giving Stanford a
one-touchdown advantage.

The Bruins continually
shadowed Margerum, Tyler
and the other Card wide re
ceivers while ignoring the run
ning backs. Schonert
explained just how misguided
UCLA's defense was.
"We knew they'd try to
double-cover a lot of our out
side people," Schonert said,
"so we knew we wanted to get
the ball to our backs."
Instant TD
Besides McNeil, the man
whom the Bruins want to get
the ball to most is Kenny Eas
ley, their all-conference safety
and kick returner.
Easley rewarded UCLA's
faith in him on Stanford's final
kickoff, sprinting from his own
one-yard line all the way to the
Cardinal 40 before Naber
fought off a block to wrest him
out of bounds.
Three plays gained just six
yards leaving the Bruins with a
fourth-and-four dilemma on
Stanford's 34.
UCLA had no choice but to
go for the first down. Bashore
rolled out right, cut to his left
and zigzagged into the end
zone and a mass of disbeliev
ing screams.
Minutes later, of course, the
screams resumed, butthis time
mostly in joy.

In the second most important play of the game, senior flanker and kick-bloc ker Gordy Banks (45) vaults
into UCLA kicker Peter Boermeester's line and deflects the 40-yard attempt with only 1:11 left in the
game. In blocking a kick for the second straight week, Banks gave his teammates one last shot at winning,
which they did, 27-24.
