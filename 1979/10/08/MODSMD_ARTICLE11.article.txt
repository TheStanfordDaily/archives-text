'Sexist trash'
When I saw that Dos Equis
poster I couldn't believe it. I
couldn't believe that your ad
vertising manager allowed that
advertisement to be put in after
all the hassles and letters last
year about sexist ads in the
Daily.
I imagine the protest mail is
pouring in and you deserve
every piece. I'm not going to
go into detail about how
women have to be stopped
being looked upon as sex
machines if they ever are to be
really equal in this society. You
should know that already.
As for me, I'm a little bum
med, not just because you
printed that sexist trash, but
because I like Dos Equis.

I'll be drinking Becks to
night.

Change ad rules
Opening up the Oct. 21 Daily
a flyer advertising the "XX—
citement" of two blond
senoritas and Dos Equis beer
fell in my lap. Overcoming the
excitement, several things
about the advertisement and
your newspaper struck me.
The sexist content of the ad
was obvious. I also thought of
wasted paper and how the
flyers would sooh litter the
campus.
Most newspapers have
strong advertising guidelines.
Yours should too. If only for
Dos Equis' business interest,

the Daily should have advised
the company that sexist mes
sages would be unpopular with
the University readership.
I'm also surprised that the
Daily is distributing glossy
paper flyers when we hear so
often of cardboard and news
print shortages. Along with
consumers, the Daily should
realize that this paper stock is
not commonly recyclable.
Advertising may support the
Daily, but in this case I ended
up paying for it. When the dis
carded flyers began to blow
around the dorms and White
Plaza, it was my tuition money
that paid the labor to pick them
up.
The Daily should be respon
sible to social, ecological and
cost considerations in both its
editorial and advertising
policies. Rod Stevens

A noble symbol
An article in the Sept. 28
Daily concerned the con
troversy over the resurrection
of "Chief Lightfoot" as the
symbol of Stanford University.
Throughout the article, the
main Objection cited, con
demning the reintstitution of
"Chief Lightfoot," was by na
tive Americans who did . .
not want their race used as en
tertainment." This is a valid
motive for concern in light of
the context in which they
viewed the "Chief" — ". . .
some guy jumpingaround, and
they (the spectators) laugh."
It is not, however, with this
perspective that the Indian was
chosen to symbolize the Uni
versity. The native Americans
are a proud, courageous, and

brave people whose heritage
runs deep in this land.
It need not be a mockery of
the native Americans in
using "Chief Lightfoot" as a
symbol of the University, but
rather, with the proper at
titude, a tribute to their spirit.
It is time to end the weak,
impotent excuses by which we
name our athletic teams —
Cardinals, Trees . . . Bring
back "Chief Lightfoot" with a
mature perspective, and thus
pride to Stanford and native
Americans.

Libertarians
discriminatory
David Miller's question
naire, "Where do you stand on
the political plane?" (Dai
ly, Oct. 3) was slanted to favor
the libertarian viewpoint by the
choice of questions and "ap
propriate" answers.
For example, the reader
scored one point on the
"economic liberty axis" by
favoring the right of businesses
to discriminate against
homosexuals, a group which
has not yet secured basic rights
in most places, and is the ob
ject of widespread ridicule.
What is cleverly omitted is
the fact that a true libertarian
would also rack up points for
favoring the businessman's
right to discriminate on'the
basis of race, sex, religion,
political beliefs and ethnic ori
gin, as well as sexual prefer
ence.
To present an accurate view
of the libertarian concept of
individual rights, Miller should

give equal time to concepts
which are seldom mentioned
by libertarians, along with their
standard arguments against
government regulation and for
civil and property rights.
These concepts include the
"rights" to discriminate, to pol
lute the environment, to risk
public safety (such as with nuc
lear power) and to consume
resources wastefully without
regard to the long term welfare
of the society.

Credit due
As an organization dedicated
to political awareness, New Di
rections appreciates the prac
tice of newspapers reporting
upcoming votes and elections.
Hence, our members may
have been dismayed by the
Daily's recommendation last
spring against fee assessments
for New Directions, but we
maintained our respect for a
practice aimed at further
educating the student body.
While your Oct. 4 article on
Friday's Panofsky-Teller debate
reported the most important
information, mention of New
Direction's sponsorship would
seem deserved.
We are proud of such pre
sentations and hope that stu
dents will appreciate and take
advantage of them.
We also hope that when the
vote on fee assessments comes
up again, students and the
Daily will remember our spon
sorship of high quality ac
tivities.
