## Cro Mem library subject of rancor 
### 
On Thursday, Sept. 27, the
Daily ran this dramatic head
line: "Cro Mem library savedâ€”
Student objections halt plan to
convert space into offices."
Good as the Daily article was, it
failed to portray the atmos
phere of inadequate com
munication, misleading or
broken promises and seem
ingly underhanded timing that
characterized the entire
episode for those of us who
lived through it.
It all began in March when
the Residence Halls Manage
ment office (they call them
selves the RMO) moved into
Crothers Memorial Hall. A few
days before the construction
was to begin, two of our dorm
officers were told of the plan.
They were also told that
there was nothing we could do
to stop it. Our officers were
convinced by their argument
and (perhaps mistakenly) did

not alert the residents of the
move. The first time the resi
dents learned of the move was
when the workmen arrived and
began to remodel the dorm
ping-pong room and two study
rooms for the new offices of
the RMO.
Once the construction had
begun, a meeting was called
between the residents of Cro
Mem and the RMO. We were
told that two paint closets
would be converted into study
space and that additional im
provements to existing com
mon space would be made to
offset the loss. Finally, we were
assured that the RMO would
not expand. We felt certain
that no additional space would
be lost.
The next scene of the drama
occurred in July. It's summer
quarter. Most permanent re
sidents were on vacation or at
summer jobs. Our dorm offic

ers were informed of plans to
convert the library, which ad
joins the new RMO offices,
into an additional office. They
were shocked! Hadn't we been
assured, just four months ago,
that no further expansion
would occur?
We were told that a new pos
ition had been created to over
see the RMO. It was this man
who needed the dorm library
for his office. "Clearly, the
RMO is not expanding," they
said.
We strongly opposed this
new office, arguing that we
could not afford further loss of
study space.
A meeting was planned soon
after, for more discussion.
However, this meeting was
canceled by the administration
with the statement that the
matter had been dropped.
Once again, we felt safe from
further administrative expan
sion.
With the conclusion of
summer quarter came the in
tersession and the exodus of
most remaining Cro Mem resi
dents. It was then that word of
another meeting to discuss the
conversion of the Cro Mem lib
rary into an office was.sent by
the administration. (Wait a
minute! Wasn't that issue
dropped?)
None of the dorm's student
officers would be in town at the
time of the meeting. However,
one RA had just returned from
his summer job. He and the
dorm manager attended the
meeting. Unknown to them at
the time, a statement made in

earlier discussions had been
interpreted by the administra
tion as a compromise prop
osal.
The administration was ac
cepting this "compromise
proposal." The library would
become an office.
The few remaining residents
in the dorm knew nothing of
this latest decision. Blithely,
they continued to use the lib
rary; some stopping in most
every evening after work to
borrow some light reading.
One day everything was as
usual. The next day, the key
wouldn't fit in the lock.
All the library furniture was
moved across the hall. A por
tion of wall had been removed
between the library and the
RMO. A little sign appeared in
the corner of the door, "The
study room has been moved
across the hall to Room 310.
Room 309 has been made into
an office."
What's going on!
At this point began the stu
dent meetings, late-night
phone calls, administration
meetings and student
administration meeting
confrontations which halted
the office construction and on
Sept. 26 resulted in the declara
tion that the Cro Mem library
would not be made into an of
fice.
Here's the point. There's
something seriously wrong
with an administrative organi
zation which forces such
things to occur.
