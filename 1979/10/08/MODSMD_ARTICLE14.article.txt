# Lean years apparently over
## Alaskan gold mining up 
### 
Anchorage, Alaska (AP) — Alaska is a gold
proud state where the nugget is as much a
symbol as the Northern Lights and your
next-door neighbor may spend his summers
working on a claim.
But even with today's skyrocketing prices,
Alaska's gold production has dwindled to a
trickle. This year's estimated output is only
about one-tenth of the amount mined in
1941.
).P. Tangen, president of the Alaska Mining
Association, said the price increase has only
"given miners an opportunity to sell off
some of the gold they have accumulated in
the past several years at a reasonable profit
for a change."
There is no denying there has been an up
swing in production since the lean years of
Alaska's "gold depression."
Mining experts estimate gold production
in the early 1970s had dropped to barely
10,000 to 12,000 ounces per year. This year,
Dr. Ernest Wolff of the University of Alaska's
Mineral Industry Research Lab said produc
tion could be as high as 100,000 ounces,
worth roughly $40 million at today's prices.
"I'd say 20 percent of the miners out there
struck it rich," Wolff said. "Another 40 per
cent are making a real good living."
Some Alaskans look hopefully at the in
crease for signs of a new gold rush. But
others rate it as strictly bush league — a far
cry from the days when 20,000 miners and
adventurers swarmed Nome's beaches at the
turn of the century, and fortunes were made
in a matter of days.
"There is a tremendous interest in gold in
Alaska as there is anywhere else," said Tuc

key Hayes, who has been involved in gold
mining for the past six years. "But the exper
tise of the large mining companies is not pre
sent due to the federal lands situation.
They're reluctant to make large invest
ments."
As for smaller operations, Hayes said, the
price increase has put some miners back to
work and made their work more profitable
"but there are mines failing every day." He
said this frequently happens because miners
can't get financing for their operations.
There are only 300 to 400 heavy equipment
operations in Alaska, many run by families or
individuals with a handful of partners.
Alaska gold operations never recovered
from government-set gold prices and World
War 11, when the government declared gold
mining a non-essential industry.
Tangen said gold mining has always been
more difficult in Alaska due to sparse popula
tion, lack of roads and railroads, and the dis
tances miners must travel to their claims.
Tangen said in most cases, mining simply
ceased to be profitable.
Wolff estimates gold production costs
have gone up ten times since the official price
was set at $35 an ounce in the 19305.
Federal land withdrawals have further
complicated things. When Congress failed to
pass a bill setting aside Alaska park and wil
derness areas last year, President Jimmy Car
ter and Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus froze
110 million acres to protect wilderness areas.
Tangen said some of the land had already
been slated for a strict ban against mining,
but prospecting was to be allowed on 40 mill
ion acres involved.
