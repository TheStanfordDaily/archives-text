## Harriers take fourth 
### Robert Stone 
"They all ran really well, very
good races."
This was Coach Laurel
Treon's appraisal of her wo
men's cross-country team's
performance after it finished
fourth at the California Wo
men's Invitational Meet held at
Tilden Park in Berkeley Satur
day morning. The Card "A"
team ran for a score of 129
points, placing them three
spots behind meet champ
Arizona, which tallied 39.
California was second with 48
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
earned third with a total of 73
points.
The 70-degree temperature
and overcast sky made condi
tions "just warm enough," ac
cording to Coach Treon. Be
fore the race she stated that the
challenge in the 5000 meter
course would be " a lot of rol
ling hills and one long gradual
hill. It's good preparation for
our invitational."
First place in the meet was
garnered by Maggie Keyes of
Cal Poly-SLO who set a course
record for the second week in a
row with a time of 17:33.0. Last
week Keyes was the first of six
finishers who shattered the

course mark at the Fresno Invi
tational, posting a time of
16:23.2.
Finishing first for the Cardi
nals was freshman Kim
Schnurpfeil whose mark of
17:53.4 was good for an overall
third-place finish.
Senior All-American Ann
Thrupp bettered her 1978 time
by 30 seconds for an overall
14th-place finish at 18:35.5.
The next Cardinal to cross the
line was junior Ann Wothers
poon for 28th pl&ce, followed
by sophomore Susan Bragdon
at 36th.
Freshman laneal Cabbage
rounded out the "A"team
finishes with a4sth place show
ing. Junior Joanne Ernst was
the first finisher for the Stan
ford "B" team and 53rd place
overall. H&r time of 20:30
shows vast improvement over
her mark last year of 21:54.
Twelve full teams competed,
including such out-of-state
contenders as the University of
Arizona, the University of
Montana, and the University of
New Mexico. This provided an
opportunity for "getting a
good look at teams and getting
confidence at the same time,"
Treon said.
