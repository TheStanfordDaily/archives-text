# Cards' victory: A tale of two kicks
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
"I didn't know whether it was good or not, but the whole team
came running out onto the field."
Ken Naber was perhaps the only one in the stadium who did
not know whether it was good or not — "It" being the unbelieva
ble, thesaurus-defying 56-yard field goal the slender junior
kicked as time ran out to propel Stanford to a 27-24 victory over
arch rival UCLA.
The field goal was proof of the re-emergence of the Cardinal
team that was in such spiritual disarray two weeks ago following
the baffling 17-13 loss to Army, a loss even more baffling after
seeing Stanford fight back to win Saturday.
In addition, to have the special teams provide the opportunity
for victory in the last 1:11 had to be not only a dramatic but a
fitting vindication, for it was the special teams that cost Stanford
two losses last season — including the 27-26 defeat atthe hands of
UCLA.
One of the factors in that loss to UCLA last year was a missed
extra point by Naber.
"I've though about that (kick) for a year. I thought about it all
last week," Naber said. And then came the chance for the Cincin
nati native to pay off that year-long debt.
"I had a minute-and-a-half to think about it. I said to myself,
OK, you know you're gonna get a shot.' It all just depends on
where or when," he added.
The Card offense stalled at the UCLA 39 with three consecutive
incompletions and all of a sudden Naber knew where and when.
"It felt good when I hit it," Naber said. "The wind started taking
it and I just hoped it would stay in. I saw it coming close — it
looked like it was good, but I didn't know about the distance.
"Ihe ball hooked quite a bit. I was just hoping it would stay
there."
Ihe ball did hook — hooked so well that it hit the left upright
and bounced over. It was a welcome relief for Naber, who had
missed two comparative chip shots of 29 and 48 yards in the first
half.
"Once I miss one I forget about it,"he said. "I went into the
locker room and sat down and got my head together. I came out
in the second half ready to play football."
Naber never would have gotten the chance to win it for the
Cards without Cordy Banks' leaping deflection of Peter Boer
meester's 40-yard field goal attempt with 1:11 to play.
"It was a special block right," Banks said. "Gary Wimmer is the
inside man. He gets their outside man so I can get a clean shot. I
went clean through."
In his postgame press conference, UCLA head coach Terry

Donahue was not as certain as to what happened.
Leaning on the wall and looking as if he wished he were any
where else in the world but there, Donahue said, "I really don't
know what happened on the field goal. Anytime you have one
blocked there's a breakdown. It looked like someone on the left
side but I couldn't tell."
Assistant coach Al Lavan, who works with the kicking game,
was highly complimentary of Banks, the senior flanker who
caught one pass for 24 yards in addition to deflecting the field
goal.
"It's a credit to Cordy — one helluva effort," Lavan said. "Ifyou
come with the same intensity every time, and they don't get a
perfect snap and perfect blocking, we're gonna block it."
The frantic finish was almost too perfect — as if a script were
being followed. And from the way Naber's preparation unfolded
during the week, and before the game, it almost seems to be an
act of Providence.
"Ironically Kenny had been kicking 57-yard field goals before
the game," Lavan said. "I told Rod (Dowhower) before the game
that if we really needed it just before the half or needed a field
goal that Kenny Naber had been kicking 57-yard field goals."
Freshman Mike Teeuws, whose quick, accurate snaps are as
responsible for the resurgence of the Stanford kicking game as
anyone, noted a little special preparation, too.
"This week we worked on 60-yard field goals," Teeuws said.
"We usually work on 50-yard ones but this week we especially
worked on our longer ones."
Whoever was responsible — Naber, Teeuws, Banks — there
was one man who above all felt the blow of their efforts.
"I didn't want to put a super block on for the field goal,"
Donahue said. "Ifwe wereoffsides, itwould have given them five
yards closer.
"It looked well-kicked. I was hoping it would be wide."
Maybe the winning coach, the one bathed in bright lights (at
least until next Saturday) had the best reaction.
"His leg has been strong all year," Rod Dowhower said. "But 56
yards, my gosh! That's unreal!"
"I didn't know whether it was good or not, but the whole team
came running out onto the field."

Leaning on the wall and looking as if he wished he were any
where else in the world but there, Donahue said, "I really don't
know what happened on the field goal. Anytime you have one
blocked there's a breakdown. It looked like someone on the left
side but I couldn't tell."
Assistant coach Al Lavan, who works with the kicking game,
was highly complimentary of Banks, the senior flanker who
caught one pass for 24 yards in addition to deflecting the field
goal.
"It's a credit to Cordy — one helluva effort," Lavan said. "Ifyou
come with the same intensity every time, and they don't get a
perfect snap and perfect blocking, we're gonna block it."
The frantic finish was almost too perfect — as if a script were
being followed. And from the way Naber's preparation unfolded
during the week, and before the game, it almost seems to be an
act of Providence.
"Ironically Kenny had been kicking 57-yard field goals before
the game," Lavan said. "I told Rod (Dowhower) before the game
that if we really needed it just before the half or needed a field
goal that Kenny Naber had been kicking 57-yard field goals."
Freshman Mike Teeuws, whose quick, accurate snaps are as
responsible for the resurgence of the Stanford kicking game as
anyone, noted a little special preparation, too.
"This week we worked on 60-yard field goals," Teeuws said.
"We usually work on 50-yard ones but this week we especially
worked on our longer ones."
Whoever was responsible — Naber, Teeuws, Banks — there
was one man who above all felt the blow of their efforts.
"I didn't want to put a super block on for the field goal,"
Donahue said. "Ifwe wereoffsides, itwould have given them five
yards closer.
"It looked well-kicked. I was hoping it would be wide."
Maybe the winning coach, the one bathed in bright lights (at
least until next Saturday) had the best reaction.
"His leg has been strong all year," Rod Dowhower said. "But 56
yards, my gosh! That's unreal!"
"I didn't know whether it was good or not, but the whole team
came running out onto the field."
Ken Naber was perhaps the only one in the stadium who did
not know whether it was good or not — "It" being the unbelieva
ble, thesaurus-defying 56-yard field goal the slender junior
kicked as time ran out to propel Stanford to a 27-24 victory over
arch rival UCLA.
The field goal was proof of the re-emergence of the Cardinal
team that was in such spiritual disarray two weeks ago following
the baffling 17-13 loss to Army, a loss even more baffling after
seeing Stanford fight back to win Saturday.
In addition, to have the special teams provide the opportunity
for victory in the last 1:11 had to be not only a dramatic but a
fitting vindication, for it was the special teams that cost Stanford
two losses last season — including the 27-26 defeat atthe hands of
UCLA.
One of the factors in that loss to UCLA last year was a missed
extra point by Naber.
"I've though about that (kick) for a year. I thought about it all
last week," Naber said. And then came the chance for the Cincin
nati native to pay off that year-long debt.
"I had a minute-and-a-half to think about it. I said to myself,
OK, you know you're gonna get a shot.' It all just depends on
where or when," he added.
The Card offense stalled at the UCLA 39 with three consecutive
incompletions and all of a sudden Naber knew where and when.
"It felt good when I hit it," Naber said. "The wind started taking
it and I just hoped it would stay in. I saw it coming close — it
looked like it was good, but I didn't know about the distance.
"Ihe ball hooked quite a bit. I was just hoping it would stay
there."
Ihe ball did hook — hooked so well that it hit the left upright
and bounced over. It was a welcome relief for Naber, who had
missed two comparative chip shots of 29 and 48 yards in the first
half.
"Once I miss one I forget about it,"he said. "I went into the
locker room and sat down and got my head together. I came out
in the second half ready to play football."
Naber never would have gotten the chance to win it for the
Cards without Cordy Banks' leaping deflection of Peter Boer
meester's 40-yard field goal attempt with 1:11 to play.
"It was a special block right," Banks said. "Gary Wimmer is the
inside man. He gets their outside man so I can get a clean shot. I
went clean through."
In his postgame press conference, UCLA head coach Terry

Donahue was not as certain as to what happened.
