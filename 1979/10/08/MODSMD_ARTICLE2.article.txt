# Lightfoot returns after 7-year absence
## Native American students and administrators meet with Chief after game 
### Joan O'Connell Robin Millington 
Timm Williams (Chief Lightfoot)
returned to the Farm Saturday, re
ceiving a mixed response of cheers
and boos from the 70,000 fans here
for the Stanford-UCLA football
game.
After the game, Williams met with
members of the Stanford community
to hear criticism of his actions and
present his position on the mascot
issue.
Williams was appearing in the
stadium as Chief Lightfoot for the
first time in seven years. He served as
the University's mascot for 21 years
before the Indian was abolished as
the University's symbol in 1972.
Williams entered the stadium at
half-time, accompanied by several
men wearing T-shirts bearing the
slogan, "Bring Back Chief Lightfoot
to the Farm."
There are conflicting reports on
how Williams, who had no pass, was
allowed on the field. One member of
Williams' entourage said that a gate,
which had been locked, was "sud
denly and amazingly opened," but
denied that the security force let
them in.
No resistance from guards
Williams said after the game that

he encountered no resistance from
security guards.
Members of the Stanford Special
Events patrol who were guarding the
gate to the field said, "a call came
over the radio to let him in. That's all
we know."
Although Athletic Director Andy
Geiger refused to comment, Assis
tant Athletic Director Gary Cavalli
said at half-time that University offi
cials knew in advance that Williams
would be at the game and that sec
urity guards had been told to try to
keep him off the field.
"But we also told them not to make
a spectacle," Cavalli said. "I thought
the whole thing was pathetic. But we
were pleased that he got such a de
cidedly cool response."
Williams, dressed in full costume,
appeared on the field as the Stanford
Band was performing at half-time. He
waved to the crowd and then slowly
circled the track, accompanied by
men who acted as cheerleaders by
waving their arms to solicit applause.
Alumni support
Williams' greatest support came
from the west end of the stadium,
where many alumni were sitting.
They gave Williams a standing ova
tion when he stopped in front of
their section.

As he paraded in front of the stu
dents' section, however, Williams
received both boos and cheers.
One native American ran down to
the chain-link fence separating the
field from the stands and began yel
ling at Williams. The youth was re
strained by security officials as Wil
liams proceeded.
Following the incident, the angry
man, close to tears, said, "I just fee!
really angry and let down that he
would do this. I wish I could just ask
him some questions about why he is
doing this to us."
Ignored by athletes
Williams remained on the field for
the rest ot the game but, for the most
part, was ignored by the athletes and
other persons on the sidelines.
Although Band members said they
had been told to "just ignore" Wil
liams, they included a native Ameri
can fanfare in their post-game show.
Williams began dancing, but stop
ped when persons in the stands
began throwing ice and trash.
Claiming that "Sure, we could
have used physical restraint," to
keep Williams from dancing, said
Band manager Randy Devol, "We
didn't think it was worth the hassle."
He cited the threatening demeanor
of Williams' compatriots and "veiled

threats" directed at Assistant Band
Manager Bruce Heiman as deterrents
to a direct Band-Chief confrontation.
Recording made
"We needed to play that song for
our recording, and we didn't think
that it was that big of a deal," Devol
said. "We're sorry if we offended
anyone."
Band leaders had decided earlier
in the week to "basically play as it
(Williams) wasn't there" during half
time, Devol said. Because of the li
mited response Williams received
during the game, Devol said that
Band members concluded that, "if
he (Williams) wanted to nail in his
own coffin" after the game, they
would not involve themselves.
Previous requests by Chief Light
foot supporters to purposely include
him in the Band's performance were
rejected, Devol said.
After the game, Williams was con
fronted outside the stadium by Fran
cis Robert and Willie Reid, members
of the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization (SAIO).
Scholarships, museum
Williams said he hoped his pre
sence on the field would help to sec
ure educational and cultural benefits
for the native Americans here, such
as scholarships for native American
youth and a museum to help foster
American Indian heritage.
Williams said he returned to the
University because "what I want for
my Indian people is not what I see.
"I work for Indians on the national
level, and they are constantly asking
me when I will return to Stanford as
the symbol," he said.
He added that he plans to continue
coming to the games in the Chief
Lightfoot costume.
Later discussion
Debate on the issue continued
later that evening when Williams met
with about 100 students and staff
members in RobleHall, the Universi
ty's native American theme house.
Williams told the crowd, which in
cluded about 15 native American
students, that he believed he could
help the native American cause by
acting as mascot.
Robert countered that Williams
had been the University mascot for
almost 20 years without initiating any
sort of native American programs.
Williams said, "I don't see the
things that I dreamed of and hoped
forat this campus because just about
the time I got the contacts to start
doing the things I wanted, I was
kicked off campus."
Other arguments
Corrinne Garza, a native American
student here, argued that other na
tive American leaders were able to
have a great deal of national influ
ence "without dancing around on a
field."
One member of the audience said
that whether Williams perceived
himself as helping the native Ameri
cans in the past was not the impor
tant issue.
"The issue is, do you care about
how the Stanford Indian students
feel about you dancing as the mascot
and how can we convince you we
don't want you?" one person asked.
Williams was asked six times


Timm Williams (Chief Lightfoot)
whether he would continue to dance
if the native American community
here clearly requested him not to do
so.
Williams said he would "think
about the request."
"I don't think I'm making a fool of
myself," he said. "If you think I am,
then maybe it's your own insecurity
you have to deal with."
Williams also said he was not sure
of the true concensus of the native
American students on campus.
"What would it take to indicate to
you an Indian decision on this?"
asked Pat Fresh, acting associate
dean of native American affairs. "If
you can't tell me, it would indicate
you are playing games spurred on by
personal motivations which have
come out in this discussion."
Another objection was raised by
Standly Scott, an athletic trainer
here. Scott said free T-shirts bearing
a Chief Lightfoot logo and the moto
"Bring Back Chief Lightfoot to the
Farm" had been anonymously left in
football team members' lockers last

week.
There was a divided reaction
among team members, according to
Scott. He said some members put
black x's across the shirts and wrote
"don't" before the slogan. This ac
tion upset other members, he said.
"Anyone who has enough money
to pass out free T-shifts has an instant
billboard, but that does not create
unity among the players," Scott said.
"You're causing disruption and
problems. If you are here to inspire
our athletic teams — which seems to
be your purpose — you are not," he
told Williams.
No one at the meeting spoke in
favor of reinstating the Indian as
mascot.
The hour-and-a-half meeting
ended with the native American stu
dents inviting Williams to return to
campus to discuss various issues
with the Stanford community.
"I'll consider setting up a meet
ing," responded Williams. "That's all
I can offer at this time."

personal motivations which have
come out in this discussion."
Another objection was raised by
Standly Scott, an athletic trainer
here. Scott said free T-shirts bearing
a Chief Lightfoot logo and the moto
"Bring Back Chief Lightfoot to the
Farm" had been anonymously left in
football team members' lockers last

week.
There was a divided reaction
among team members, according to
Scott. He said some members put
black x's across the shirts and wrote
"don't" before the slogan. This ac

"Anyone who has enough money
to pass out free T-shifts has an instant
billboard, but that does not create

"You're causing disruption and

Timm Williams (Chief Lightfoot)
returned to the Farm Saturday, re
ceiving a mixed response of cheers
and boos from the 70,000 fans here
for the Stanford-UCLA football
game.
After the game, Williams met with
members of the Stanford community
to hear criticism of his actions and
present his position on the mascot
issue.
Williams was appearing in the
stadium as Chief Lightfoot for the
first time in seven years. He served as
the University's mascot for 21 years
before the Indian was abolished as
the University's symbol in 1972.
Williams entered the stadium at
half-time, accompanied by several
men wearing T-shirts bearing the
slogan, "Bring Back Chief Lightfoot
to the Farm."
There are conflicting reports on
how Williams, who had no pass, was
allowed on the field. One member of
Williams' entourage said that a gate,
which had been locked, was "sud
denly and amazingly opened," but
denied that the security force let
them in.
No resistance from guards
Williams said after the game that

he encountered no resistance from
security guards.
Members of the Stanford Special
Events patrol who were guarding the
gate to the field said, "a call came
over the radio to let him in. That's all
we know."
Although Athletic Director Andy
Geiger refused to comment, Assis
tant Athletic Director Gary Cavalli
said at half-time that University offi
cials knew in advance that Williams
would be at the game and that sec
urity guards had been told to try to
keep him off the field.
"But we also told them not to make
a spectacle," Cavalli said. "I thought
the whole thing was pathetic. But we
were pleased that he got such a de
cidedly cool response."
Williams, dressed in full costume,
appeared on the field as the Stanford
Band was performing at half-time. He
waved to the crowd and then slowly
circled the track, accompanied by
men who acted as cheerleaders by
waving their arms to solicit applause.
Alumni support
Williams' greatest support came
from the west end of the stadium,
where many alumni were sitting.
They gave Williams a standing ova
tion when he stopped in front of
their section.

As he paraded in front of the stu
dents' section, however, Williams
received both boos and cheers.
One native American ran down to
the chain-link fence separating the
field from the stands and began yel
ling at Williams. The youth was re
strained by security officials as Wil
liams proceeded.
Following the incident, the angry
man, close to tears, said, "I just fee!
really angry and let down that he
would do this. I wish I could just ask
him some questions about why he is
doing this to us."
Ignored by athletes
Williams remained on the field for
the rest ot the game but, for the most
part, was ignored by the athletes and
other persons on the sidelines.
Although Band members said they
had been told to "just ignore" Wil
liams, they included a native Ameri
can fanfare in their post-game show.
Williams began dancing, but stop
ped when persons in the stands
began throwing ice and trash.
Claiming that "Sure, we could
have used physical restraint," to
keep Williams from dancing, said
Band manager Randy Devol, "We
didn't think it was worth the hassle."
He cited the threatening demeanor
of Williams' compatriots and "veiled

threats" directed at Assistant Band
Manager Bruce Heiman as deterrents
to a direct Band-Chief confrontation.
Recording made
"We needed to play that song for
our recording, and we didn't think
that it was that big of a deal," Devol
said. "We're sorry if we offended
anyone."
Band leaders had decided earlier
in the week to "basically play as it
(Williams) wasn't there" during half
time, Devol said. Because of the li
mited response Williams received
during the game, Devol said that
Band members concluded that, "if
he (Williams) wanted to nail in his
own coffin" after the game, they
would not involve themselves.
Previous requests by Chief Light
foot supporters to purposely include
him in the Band's performance were
rejected, Devol said.
After the game, Williams was con
fronted outside the stadium by Fran
cis Robert and Willie Reid, members
of the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization (SAIO).
Scholarships, museum
Williams said he hoped his pre
sence on the field would help to sec
ure educational and cultural benefits
for the native Americans here, such
as scholarships for native American
youth and a museum to help foster
American Indian heritage.
Williams said he returned to the
University because "what I want for
my Indian people is not what I see.
"I work for Indians on the national
level, and they are constantly asking
me when I will return to Stanford as
the symbol," he said.
He added that he plans to continue
coming to the games in the Chief
Lightfoot costume.
Later discussion
Debate on the issue continued
later that evening when Williams met
with about 100 students and staff
members in RobleHall, the Universi
ty's native American theme house.
Williams told the crowd, which in
cluded about 15 native American
students, that he believed he could
help the native American cause by
acting as mascot.
Robert countered that Williams
had been the University mascot for
almost 20 years without initiating any
sort of native American programs.
Williams said, "I don't see the
things that I dreamed of and hoped
forat this campus because just about
the time I got the contacts to start
doing the things I wanted, I was
kicked off campus."
Other arguments
Corrinne Garza, a native American
student here, argued that other na
tive American leaders were able to
have a great deal of national influ
ence "without dancing around on a
field."
One member of the audience said
that whether Williams perceived
himself as helping the native Ameri
cans in the past was not the impor
tant issue.
"The issue is, do you care about
how the Stanford Indian students
feel about you dancing as the mascot
and how can we convince you we
don't want you?" one person asked.
Williams was asked six times


Timm Williams (Chief Lightfoot)
whether he would continue to dance
if the native American community
here clearly requested him not to do
so.
Williams said he would "think
about the request."
"I don't think I'm making a fool of
myself," he said. "If you think I am,
then maybe it's your own insecurity
you have to deal with."
Williams also said he was not sure
of the true concensus of the native
American students on campus.
"What would it take to indicate to
you an Indian decision on this?"
asked Pat Fresh, acting associate
dean of native American affairs. "If
you can't tell me, it would indicate
you are playing games spurred on by
personal motivations which have
come out in this discussion."

Corrinne Garza, a native American
student here, argued that other na
tive American leaders were able to
have a great deal of national influ
ence "without dancing around on a
field."
One member of the audience said
that whether Williams perceived
himself as helping the native Ameri
cans in the past was not the impor
tant issue.
"The issue is, do you care about
how the Stanford Indian students
feel about you dancing as the mascot
and how can we convince you we
don't want you?" one person asked.
Williams was asked six times


Timm Williams (Chief Lightfoot)
whether he would continue to dance
if the native American community
here clearly requested him not to do
so.
Williams said he would "think
about the request."
"I don't think I'm making a fool of
myself," he said. "If you think I am,
then maybe it's your own insecurity
you have to deal with."
Williams also said he was not sure
of the true concensus of the native
American students on campus.
"What would it take to indicate to
you an Indian decision on this?"
asked Pat Fresh, acting associate
dean of native American affairs. "If
you can't tell me, it would indicate
you are playing games spurred on by
personal motivations which have
come out in this discussion."
Another objection was raised by
Standly Scott, an athletic trainer
here. Scott said free T-shirts bearing
a Chief Lightfoot logo and the moto
"Bring Back Chief Lightfoot to the
Farm" had been anonymously left in
football team members' lockers last

week.
There was a divided reaction
among team members, according to
Scott. He said some members put
black x's across the shirts and wrote
"don't" before the slogan. This ac
tion upset other members, he said.
"Anyone who has enough money
to pass out free T-shifts has an instant
billboard, but that does not create
unity among the players," Scott said.
"You're causing disruption and
problems. If you are here to inspire
our athletic teams — which seems to
be your purpose — you are not," he
told Williams.
No one at the meeting spoke in
favor of reinstating the Indian as
mascot.
The hour-and-a-half meeting
ended with the native American stu
dents inviting Williams to return to
campus to discuss various issues
with the Stanford community.
"I'll consider setting up a meet
ing," responded Williams. "That's all
I can offer at this time."

Timm Williams (Chief Lightfoot)
returned to the Farm Saturday, re
ceiving a mixed response of cheers
and boos from the 70,000 fans here
for the Stanford-UCLA football
game.
After the game, Williams met with
members of the Stanford community
to hear criticism of his actions and
present his position on the mascot
issue.
Williams was appearing in the
stadium as Chief Lightfoot for the
first time in seven years. He served as
the University's mascot for 21 years
before the Indian was abolished as
the University's symbol in 1972.
Williams entered the stadium at
half-time, accompanied by several
men wearing T-shirts bearing the
slogan, "Bring Back Chief Lightfoot
to the Farm."
There are conflicting reports on
how Williams, who had no pass, was
allowed on the field. One member of
Williams' entourage said that a gate,
which had been locked, was "sud
denly and amazingly opened," but
denied that the security force let
them in.
No resistance from guards
Williams said after the game that

he encountered no resistance from
security guards.
Members of the Stanford Special
Events patrol who were guarding the
gate to the field said, "a call came
over the radio to let him in. That's all
we know."
Although Athletic Director Andy
Geiger refused to comment, Assis
tant Athletic Director Gary Cavalli
said at half-time that University offi
cials knew in advance that Williams
would be at the game and that sec
urity guards had been told to try to
keep him off the field.
"But we also told them not to make
a spectacle," Cavalli said. "I thought
the whole thing was pathetic. But we
were pleased that he got such a de
cidedly cool response."
Williams, dressed in full costume,
appeared on the field as the Stanford
Band was performing at half-time. He
waved to the crowd and then slowly
circled the track, accompanied by
men who acted as cheerleaders by
waving their arms to solicit applause.
Alumni support
Williams' greatest support came
from the west end of the stadium,
where many alumni were sitting.
They gave Williams a standing ova
tion when he stopped in front of
their section.

As he paraded in front of the stu
dents' section, however, Williams
received both boos and cheers.
One native American ran down to
the chain-link fence separating the
field from the stands and began yel
ling at Williams. The youth was re
strained by security officials as Wil
liams proceeded.
Following the incident, the angry
man, close to tears, said, "I just fee!
really angry and let down that he
would do this. I wish I could just ask
him some questions about why he is
doing this to us."
Ignored by athletes
Williams remained on the field for
the rest ot the game but, for the most
part, was ignored by the athletes and
other persons on the sidelines.
Although Band members said they
had been told to "just ignore" Wil
liams, they included a native Ameri
can fanfare in their post-game show.
Williams began dancing, but stop
ped when persons in the stands
began throwing ice and trash.
Claiming that "Sure, we could
have used physical restraint," to
keep Williams from dancing, said
Band manager Randy Devol, "We
didn't think it was worth the hassle."
He cited the threatening demeanor
of Williams' compatriots and "veiled

threats" directed at Assistant Band
Manager Bruce Heiman as deterrents
to a direct Band-Chief confrontation.
Recording made
"We needed to play that song for
our recording, and we didn't think
that it was that big of a deal," Devol
said. "We're sorry if we offended
anyone."
Band leaders had decided earlier
in the week to "basically play as it
(Williams) wasn't there" during half
time, Devol said. Because of the li
mited response Williams received
during the game, Devol said that
Band members concluded that, "if
he (Williams) wanted to nail in his
own coffin" after the game, they
would not involve themselves.
Previous requests by Chief Light
foot supporters to purposely include
him in the Band's performance were
rejected, Devol said.
After the game, Williams was con
fronted outside the stadium by Fran
cis Robert and Willie Reid, members
of the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization (SAIO).
Scholarships, museum
Williams said he hoped his pre
sence on the field would help to sec
ure educational and cultural benefits
for the native Americans here, such
as scholarships for native American
youth and a museum to help foster
American Indian heritage.
Williams said he returned to the
University because "what I want for
my Indian people is not what I see.
"I work for Indians on the national
level, and they are constantly asking
me when I will return to Stanford as
the symbol," he said.
He added that he plans to continue
coming to the games in the Chief
Lightfoot costume.
Later discussion
Debate on the issue continued
later that evening when Williams met
with about 100 students and staff
members in RobleHall, the Universi
ty's native American theme house.
Williams told the crowd, which in
cluded about 15 native American
students, that he believed he could
help the native American cause by
acting as mascot.
Robert countered that Williams
had been the University mascot for
almost 20 years without initiating any
sort of native American programs.
Williams said, "I don't see the
things that I dreamed of and hoped
forat this campus because just about
the time I got the contacts to start
doing the things I wanted, I was
kicked off campus."

Corrinne Garza, a native American
student here, argued that other na
tive American leaders were able to
have a great deal of national influ
ence "without dancing around on a
