# At de Guerre, Bruins provide the surprise
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
There must have been some
thing in the air Saturday.
Whatever it was, it spelled
disaster for favored teams and
for the underdogs. Be
fore the Stanford football team
surprised UCLA at Stanford
Stadium, the Bruin water polo
team did something very few
spectators at deGuerre pool
expected: it defeated the de
fending national champion
Cardinals, 9-7, breaking a 41-
game home winning streak.
The Bruins, who lost to
California Friday by one goal,
definitely came across »he Bay
ready to play. Stanford, mean
while, had made it all look easy
Friday with a victory over UC-
Irvine, 9-5.
The first surprise the Cards

got Saturday were bared Bruins
— that is, the entire UCLA team
had shaved their bodies for the
contest — something usually
reserved for hard-core swim
mers. For the UCLA poloists, it
was seemingly meant as a
psychological boost. And it
worked: the Bruins played, as
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti put it, "out of their
gourds."
For Stanford, it was a game in
which "everything that could
have gone wrong for us went
wrong," Dettamanti said.
The disastrous tone was set
almost immediately. After los
ing the opening sprint, senior
Randy Kalbus scooped up an
errant UCLA pass, and the
famed Cardinal fast-break was
off and swimming. Goalie )ohn

Cansel passed the ball a little
ahead of a wide open ]ody
Campbell, but the star hole
man apparently didn't see it,
turning his back to it and allow
ing a surprised UCLA player to
swim right to it.
With most of the Cards
ahead of the Bruins at the time,
the turnover left them
hopelessly behind their
counter-attacking opponents,
and UCLA scored an easy goal.
That play stunned Stanford,
and the Card offense went flat
until late in the quarter. With
less than three minutes left,
sophomore Chris Kelsey
drove, took a pass from
Campbell, faked the shot, and
dumped it off to an open Jamie
Bergeson. The freshman
whipped it into the net to tie

the score at one.
But fate dealt Stanford
another blow before the
period ended. After the Bruins
got another goal by Cansel's
arms, sophomore Alan
Mouchawar skipped a shot
past the UCLA goalie and put a
hole in the back of the cage.
Everyone present knew it was a
goal, except the goal judge,
who managed to convince the
referees, who discounted the
score. The goal judge was from
UCLA.
Two second-quarter goals by
Kelsey brought Stanford even
with UCLA, 3-3, at halftime, but
the Cardinals' woes returned
in the third quarter. The Bruins
scored two unanswered goals,
and the winning margin was es
tablished.

One of the UCLA goals came
on a 6-on-5 situation after a
Cardinal kickout. As luck
would have it, the kickout oc
curred after the scoring desk
had mistakenly given the
Bruins an extra 35-second
period with which to work.
Soon after that fiasco, Stan
ford had a chance to pull back
within one when they were
awarded a four-meter penalty
shot. But Bergeson, unbeliev
ingly, bounced it off the top of
the goal.
In the fourth quarter, the
teams exchanged goals four
times, and the Cardinals lost
their first game of the 1979
Pacific-10 season.
"A lot of little things went
wrong," said Mouchawar,
whose two fourth-quarter
scores twice brought the Cards
to within striking distance of
UCLA. "Our timing and our
shots were a little off.
• "We didn't think we could
lose to them," he added. "We
played a good game, but it
wasn't meant to be. We kept
coming back," but the "little
things" kept happening.
Dettamanti said the team
played with good intensity,
and he commended the team
for their one-on-one defense.
"But John (Gansel) was off. He
wasn't playing with confi
dence," Dettamanti admitted.
"Goals went in today that usu
ally don't get by John. Every
thing low was going in.
"There's no reason for him
to play that way," the coach
added. "He's the best goalie in
the country."
Dettamanti echoed the frust
ration of the team, saying, "We
always felt, especially during
the first half, that we were con
trolling the game."
The Cards will have a chance
to avenge the loss next week
when they play UCLA in Los
Angeles.
But about Saturday's loss,
Dettamanti said, "We've got to
suck it up. . . and forget about
it."

referees, who discounted the
score. The goal judge was from
UCLA.
Two second-quarter goals by
Kelsey brought Stanford even
with UCLA, 3-3, at halftime, but
the Cardinals' woes returned
in the third quarter. The Bruins
scored two unanswered goals,
and the winning margin was es
tablished.

One of the UCLA goals came
on a 6-on-5 situation after a
Cardinal kickout. As luck
would have it, the kickout oc
curred after the scoring desk
had mistakenly given the
Bruins an extra 35-second
period with which to work.
Soon after that fiasco, Stan
ford had a chance to pull back
within one when they were
awarded a four-meter penalty
shot. But Bergeson, unbeliev
ingly, bounced it off the top of
the goal.
In the fourth quarter, the
teams exchanged goals four
times, and the Cardinals lost
their first game of the 1979
Pacific-10 season.
"A lot of little things went
wrong," said Mouchawar,
whose two fourth-quarter
scores twice brought the Cards
to within striking distance of
UCLA. "Our timing and our
shots were a little off.
• "We didn't think we could
lose to them," he added. "We
played a good game, but it
wasn't meant to be. We kept
coming back," but the "little
things" kept happening.
Dettamanti said the team
played with good intensity,
and he commended the team
for their one-on-one defense.
"But John (Gansel) was off. He
wasn't playing with confi
dence," Dettamanti admitted.
"Goals went in today that usu
ally don't get by John. Every
thing low was going in.
"There's no reason for him
to play that way," the coach
added. "He's the best goalie in
the country."
Dettamanti echoed the frust
ration of the team, saying, "We
always felt, especially during
the first half, that we were con
trolling the game."
The Cards will have a chance
to avenge the loss next week
when they play UCLA in Los
Angeles.
But about Saturday's loss,
Dettamanti said, "We've got to
suck it up. . . and forget about
it."
There must have been some
thing in the air Saturday.
Whatever it was, it spelled
disaster for favored teams and
for the underdogs. Be
fore the Stanford football team
surprised UCLA at Stanford
Stadium, the Bruin water polo
team did something very few
spectators at deGuerre pool
expected: it defeated the de
fending national champion
Cardinals, 9-7, breaking a 41-
game home winning streak.
The Bruins, who lost to
California Friday by one goal,
definitely came across »he Bay
ready to play. Stanford, mean
while, had made it all look easy
Friday with a victory over UC-
Irvine, 9-5.
The first surprise the Cards

got Saturday were bared Bruins
— that is, the entire UCLA team
had shaved their bodies for the
contest — something usually
reserved for hard-core swim
mers. For the UCLA poloists, it
was seemingly meant as a
psychological boost. And it
worked: the Bruins played, as
Cardinal coach Dante De
ttamanti put it, "out of their
gourds."
For Stanford, it was a game in
which "everything that could
have gone wrong for us went
wrong," Dettamanti said.
The disastrous tone was set
almost immediately. After los
ing the opening sprint, senior
Randy Kalbus scooped up an
errant UCLA pass, and the
famed Cardinal fast-break was
off and swimming. Goalie )ohn

Cansel passed the ball a little
ahead of a wide open ]ody
Campbell, but the star hole
man apparently didn't see it,
turning his back to it and allow
ing a surprised UCLA player to
swim right to it.
With most of the Cards
ahead of the Bruins at the time,
the turnover left them
hopelessly behind their
counter-attacking opponents,
and UCLA scored an easy goal.
That play stunned Stanford,
and the Card offense went flat
until late in the quarter. With
less than three minutes left,
sophomore Chris Kelsey
drove, took a pass from
Campbell, faked the shot, and
dumped it off to an open Jamie
Bergeson. The freshman
whipped it into the net to tie

the score at one.
But fate dealt Stanford
another blow before the
period ended. After the Bruins
got another goal by Cansel's
arms, sophomore Alan
Mouchawar skipped a shot
past the UCLA goalie and put a
hole in the back of the cage.
Everyone present knew it was a
goal, except the goal judge,
who managed to convince the
referees, who discounted the
score. The goal judge was from
UCLA.
