# Series rematch
## 
### 
Baltimore (AP) — It has taken
eight years to arrange the re
match, which isn't exactly an
instant replay. But baseball
wouldn't mind a World Series
like the one Baltimore and
Pittsburgh played in 1971.
That seven-game showdown
was the last time the Orioles
and Pirates played for the
World Championship and was
one of the most dramatic
Series in recent years. Now the
same two teams will meetagain
in the 1979 Series beginning
tomorrow night in Baltimore.
Pittsburgh will use lanky
Bruce Kison in the opener with
the Orioles sending Mike
Flanagan against him.
Baltimore advanced to the
Series by winning the Ameri
can League East Division race
and then defeating California
in four games in the champion
ship playoff. Pittsburgh cap
tured the National League East
on the final day of the regular
season and then wiped out
Cincinnati in three straight
games in the playoffs.
There are striking similarities
between the two clubs. Both
have succeeded without much
ht?lp from the free agent mar
ketplace and, in fact, have lost
some key performers to that
auction. Both have strong,
deep bullpens and managers
who won't hesitate to go to
them.
Earl Weaver is the man in
charge of the Oriole dugout.
He has been Baltimore's pilot
since the middle of 1968.
Weaver will match strategy
moves with Pittsburgh's Chuck
Tanner, a major league man
ager since 1970, who had never
won a title until this year.
Tanner's Pirates had become

bridesmaids.with two straight
second place finishes until this
year when they clinched the
East title on the final day of the
regular season.
The Orioles lost some fine
talent to the free agent market.
Twenty-game winner Wayne
Garland left to sign with Cleve
land and was replaced by
Flanagan, who became the AL's
top winner with 23 victories
this season.
Slugger Reggie Jackson left
to sign with the New York Yan
kees and his production was
replaced by Ken Singleton,
who moved to right field and
this year became a top candi
date for Most Valuable Player
honors.
Pitcher Ross Grimsley and
second baseman Bobby Grich
also departed but the Balti
more farm system replaced
them with low budget free
agents like pitcher Steve Stone
and infielder Billy Smith.
Pittsburgh, too, has survived
the fre.e agent market well. Re
lievers Terry Forster and Rich
Gossage both left after 1977
and so General Manager Hard
ing Peterson set out to replace
them via trades. He acquired
both ex-Oriole Grant lackson
— another part of the 10-player
Yankee-Baltimore deal — and
Enrique Romo from Seattle and
they joined holdover Kent
Tekulve to give the Bucs a
strong bullpen.
The Bucs were rejected by
Pete Rose in last winter's free
agent auction but the money
they saved when he turned
them down enabled them to
sign superstar right fielder
Dave Parker to a long-term
deal.
