# Spartans 'ice' win

In what Stanford head coach
Barbara Longstreth termed as a
"nightmarish" affair, the Car
dinal field hockey squad fell to
host San Jose State, 2-0, on
Saturday.
What made the game such a
horrible one for Stanford, now
5-1, was the fact that the play
ing surface was more suitable
for ice hockey than field hoc
key. The early 10 a.m. start and
the morning dew combined to
"freeze" the field and render it
in poor condition.
Longstreth explained that
her players had trouble chang
ing directions on the hard,
slippery turf. The Spartans

did, too, but they were able to
adjust sooner.
"They played well," said
Longstreth of the Spartans,
"but I'm anxious to meet them
under normal playing condi
tions."
Card goalie Cecca Freccero
put forth a solid effort, making
17 saves, but she couldn't keep
San Jose's Pommy McFarland
and Sue Walker from reaching
the nets with goals.
The junior varsity improved
its record to 6-0-2 with a 2-1 vic
tory over the Spartans. Ironi
cally, there was no problem
with the field during this game,
though it started at 11 a.m.
Andrea Welch tallied the de
ciding goal for the Cards.
