King Games at Stanford
Brooks Johnson, Stanford's
new tracE and field coach, an
nounced Thursday that the
12th Annual Martin Luther King
Jr. Games will be held in Stan

ford Stadium March 18-22.
Johnson expects more than
30 colleges and universities to
compete, including national
powers Maryland and USC.
Featured in the meet will be
several U.S. Olympic team
hopefuls.
Some of the more illustrious
entrants will include Steve'
Scott, the United States'
number one miler; Evelyn
Ashford, the world's premier
female sprinter and holder of
the American record in the 100
and 200 meters; Steve Wil
liams, world record holder in
the 100; Renaldo Nehemiah,
world record holder in the 110
high hurdles; James Sanford,
1979 AAU 100 champion; and
Bill Green, world record hol
der in his age group for the 100
and ex-Cubberley High School
star.
According to Johnson, who
served as director of the 1976
King Games in Atlanta, this
event represents the direction
in which Stanford track wants
to go.
"We're attracting big-time
track and field here," he said,

"and in time, we hope to at
tract more big-time track and
field performers to Stanford as
students."
The university and college
competition will be held on
Friday and Saturday (Mar. 21-
22). This will serve as this year's
edition of the Stanford Invita
tional Relays.
Other events scheduled that
week are the marathon (Mar.
18), decathalon (Mar. 19-20),
men's and women's high
school competition (Mar. 20),
and open and invitational divi
sions (Mar. 22).
"This will essentially be a
track and field festival," said
Johnson. "The King Games
have been held in places like
Oslo, Norway; Kingston,
Jamaica; Atlanta and Philadel
phia. I think it's only fitting that
the meet be held on the west
coast at a place like Stanford,
which was the site of one of the
greatest meets of all time in
1962 (USA-USSR dual meet).
"It is also fitting that an event
like this continue to be held for
the kind of person that Dr. King
was," Johnson added.
