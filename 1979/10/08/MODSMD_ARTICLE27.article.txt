Castro may speak at U.N. this week
United Nations — Fidel Castro has made arrangements
to travel to New York this week to address the U.N.
General Assembly, American and U.N. officials said
Sunday. It would be the Cuban president's first trip to
the United States in 19 years. *
A State Department spokesman, David Passage, said
in Washington that visa requests for Castro and his party
were made last week, and he would probably arrive in
the middle of this week.
Passage said Castro would address the current As
sembly session in his role as head of the non-aligned
movement — the organization of more than 90 nations
that profess neutrality between the superpower blocs.
Castro played host to a non-aligned summit meeting in
Havana last month.
"There are no plans for meetings with U.S. officials,"
Passage said.
A spokesman for Kurt Waldheim said the U.N.
secretary-general "got similar information from . . .
Cuban U.N. Ambassador Mr. Raul Roa Kouri, but we are
waiting for final communications," perhaps today.
The spokesman, Rudolf Stajduhar, said Roa informed
Waldheim of the Cuban leader's intentions Friday. Staj
duhar gave no further details, and there was no im
mediate official word on the trip from Havana. Sources
suggested Castro may not yet have made a final decision
on whether to make the trip.
Castro's trip to the United States would follow a major
dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union
over the reported presence of a Soviet combat brigade
in Cuba. The Soviets denied the report, which was based
on U.S. intelligence findings, and Castro insisted that
the unit has been in Cuba since 1962 and its mission has
not been changed.
Eight dead in Athens DC-8 crash
Athens, Greece— Fire gutted a Swissair DC-8 jetliner
last night killing at least eight of the 154 persons on
board after the plane skidded to a halt on a rainswept
runway at Athens international airport, authorities said.
Two passengers were reported in serious condition
and were not expected to survive, the Civil Aviation
Authority reported. An undetermined number of pas
sengers were being treated for injuries at Athens hospi
tals, but none of the 12 crew members was injured, the
authority said.
The 142 passengers included 100 doctors en route to
Peking to attend a medical congress.
Authorities reported there was light rainfall and high
winds sweeping in from the nearby Saronic Gulf at the
time of the inc ident, but they gave no indication of the
cause of the fire.
Passengers were unable to open some emergency
exits, but finally got out by sliding down emergency
chutes after heavy smoke and flames swept the plane
within seconds of its touchdown, a passenger told re
porters.
"People were confused but there was not much
panic," said one passenger, Guy Stafford, a newspaper

reporter from Portsmouth, England.
Stafford said there was "plenty of firefighting equip
ment and officials about when we abandoned the air
craft.
Witnesses said they saw flames shooting out of the
jet's undercarriage as it attempted to brake to a stop,
finally coming to a halt at the end of the runway.
The plane was Swissair Flight 316, en route from
Geneva, and Zurich, Switzerland, bound for Bombay,
India, then Peking after a stopover in Athens for refuel
ing.
Sniper on 'bad trip' apprehended
San Francisco — A sniper whose wild, shooting virtu
ally shut down San Francisco's busy Civic Center district
for 23 hours says his siege of terror grew out of a "bad
trip" on drugs, according to a woman who talked to him
after his arrest.
A Berkeley woman who said she knew the man who
called himself "Chief Cherokee," told reporters he had
telephoned from jail after the siege and told her he had
been on a "bad trip" from taking drugs.
The sniper had fired what police estimated was at least
50 rounds of mostly .30-caliber carbine bullets into the
surrounding streets. One man was grazed by a slug a
block away but not seriously hurt.
As the siege ended Saturday, after police charged into
his 16th floor stronghold at 4:10 p.m. on the usually
teeming corner of Market and Ninth streets, the man
identified as Wayne Cullinane, 22, of Corona, Calif., and
his 55-year-old hostage, Chiyo Tashiro, were both as
leep.
Fed ups bank lending rate 1 percent
Washington — The Federal Reserve Board, alarmed by
soaring prices, hyperactive speculation in gold and the
dollar, plus excessive borrowing — increased its bank
lending rate a full percentage point on Saturday and
altered the way it controls the availability of credit.
The moves, endorsed quickly and enthusiastically by
President Jimmy Carter, should make it more difficult for
banks to lend and more expensive for people, particu
larly businessmen, to borrow. Thus, it should further
slow down economic expansion.
But board chairman Paul Volcker said the actions will
not shut off credit entirely.
Last week, the government reported wholesale prices
in September jumped 1.4 percent. Gold fluctuated
wildly, reaching $444 per ounce before falling nearly $60.
And the beleagured dollar's value declined precipit
ously on foreign exchange markets.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy with a chance of showers early today.
Clearing this afternoon then fair through tomorrow.
Lows in the 50s. Highs in the 60s near the coast to the 70s
inland. Westerly winds to 20 mph with stronger gusts
afternoons and evenings. Chance of rain 30 percent this
morning.
