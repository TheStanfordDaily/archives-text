### 
Seabrook, N.H.(AP) — Hundreds of
anti-nuclear protesters repeatedly
assaulted the Seabrook atomic
power plant Sunday but were re
pulsed by state troopers and Na
tional Guardsmen using fire hoses,
Mace and a smoke-spewing
generator.
Waves of demonstrators twice as
saulted the fence surrounding the
construction site and ripped down
whole sections of it with ropes.
Troopers and guardsmen surged
through the gap, spraying Mace and
driving the protesters back along an
access road.
But more than 1000 of them quickly
regrouped and marched a mile in the
rain to the plant entrance, where
they were met by troopers and
guardsmen standing shoulder to
shoulder behind the main gate. Fire
hoses were turned on the crowd and
a stream of smoke was unleashed
from a generator.
But the chanting protesters, clad in
rain slickers and plastic sheets, put
their backs against the chain-link
fence and defied authorities to move

them. Utility workers then emptied
two water trucks onto the crowd but
were unable to disperse them im
mediately.
The demonstrators eventually
backed off but continued to mill
about in front of the gate. Some re
turned to campsites in the nearby
woods.
Police reinforcements from other
sections of the construction site
were brought to the main gate. Traf
fic was blocked on busy U.S. High
way 1, the main road through the
town of Seabrook.
Ten people were arrested Sunday,
bringing to 19 the number arrested
on criminal trespassing charges in
the two-day attempt to occupy the
Seabrook site, long a focal point for
demonstrations against the use of
nuclear power. One other de
monstrator was arrested on a charge
of criminal mischief. Officers also
confiscated gas masks and other gear
from protesters.
Earlier, the demonstrators attemp
ted to enter the facility at separate
sites along the chain-link fence sur-

rounding the 140-acre site. The first
assault, by about 75 protesters, fiz
zled after a squad of troopers moved
from behind the fence and sprayed
them with Mace and smoke bombs.
A few hours later, about 500 de
monstrators returned in two groups
and managed to bring down sections
of the fence before being turned
back.
On Saturday, about 1500 protes
ters failed to force their way through
a 8-foot-high fence along the south
perimeter of the sprawling plant.
