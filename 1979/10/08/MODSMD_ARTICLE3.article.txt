# Panofsky and Teller debate ratification of SALT II
## 
### Mark Nassutti 
Two of the nation's most eminent
scientists squared off in a two-hour
debate Friday night as a preview of
the upcoming Senate floor discus
sion on the ratification of the
Strategic Arms Limitation
II) treaty.
Edward Teller, best known as the
inventor of the hydrogen bomb,
and Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), argued their cases in
an emotional but respectful exchange
before a packed audience in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
The passage of SALT II is the only
immediately available solution to the
arms race, according to Panofsky.
Teller, on the other hand, contended
that SALT II would contribute to U.S.
complacency and be detrimental to
American security.
Both men emphasized ideals and
goals rather than technical details.
"When is enough enough?"
Panofsky asked in reference to the
stockpiling and build-up of nuclear
weapons. He said he considered
"grossly irresponsible those critics
who claim support for arms control
while speaking out against SALT."
Although he does not intend to
pursue total disarmament, which he
termed unrealistic, he said that, "a
continued evolution of the arms race
(without SALT II) endangers the sec
urity of the free world."
Public enlightenment needed
The American people do not know
enough about SALT II to thoroughly
evaluate its merits, Teller countered.
"If SALT II is not ratified," he said,
" we will have a public debate on the
issue. That is why I don't want to see
SALT II ratified."
Teller made a distinction between

an arms race and a race in technol
ogy, saying that the current competi
tion centers on technology rather
than numbers. SALT II does not limit
new ideas, he said.
Conceptual blocks
"When you try to limit new ideas
you are in a very difficult situation.
You don't know what to limit. You
cannot limit what you have not even
dreamed of," Teller said.
In his rebuttal, Panofsky said, "if
he is right, if technology controls
man and not the other way around,
then the future is indeed dim.
Technology is the product of a chain.
You can apply restraints at different
parts of this chain ... It is the pur
pose of SALT" to controkthese de
velopments and their expansion, he
concluded.
But Teller deemed the imposition
of restraints on the Soviets impossi
ble. "The fact is that Americans can
not keep secrets. I don't think we
should keep secrets. It is against our
grain. It is against our heritage.
"But the Russians can keep sec
rets, they have kept secrets and they
will keep secrets. How can we ratify a
treaty which limits us but effectively
does not limit the Russians?" Teller
queried.
Numbers game incomplete
"If they violate, abrogate,"
Panofsky offered as an appropriate
U.S. response to Soviet overstepping
of the bounds of a ratified SALT 11.
"The point is," he added, "that the
number of objects has become so
large that we can't continue enlarg
ing."
Panofsky was critical of the "over
emphasis on counting," citing other
factors which could determine the
outcome of a nuclear exchange.
"There are geographical, political

and command-and-control differ
ences," he said, "that cannot be
quantified and which can be deci
sive."
"What is in SALT II which prevents
us from countering a Russian threat,
if it is real?" he asked.
Soviet military might
"If there is an arms race, we are
losing it fast because the Russians
have surpassed us quantitatively,"
Teller noted.
"And we can't believe it because
we see only the public facet of Rus
sian society," he said. "We do not
see the military side, and their first
priority is to the military."
With SALT 11, however, "we need
less defensive spending to reach the
same level of security," Panofsky as
serted.
"If SALT is ratified, we will sit down
and do nothing," Teller replied.

Yet, "I see in our superiority in elec
tronics an excellent way in which we
could catch up with the Russians,
especially in defense systems."
Science ignores defense
Teller lamented the tendency of
America's scientists to concentrate
on pure theoretical science instead
of its practical, military applications.
Although (pure physics) "is more
fun," heattributed his own entry into
the field of weapons development to
the admonishment of former Presi
dent Franklin Roosevelt, who said,
"you scientists are accused of pro
ducing these deadly weapons, but if
you don't work for those weapons in
the free world, the free world will be
lost."
As Teller reaffirmed his stand
against the treaty, Panofsky de
manded, "I ask of those who are
critical, saying that SALT does not go
far enough — what do you proposeis

better if SALT II is not enacted?"
U.S. power waning
Teller further called for public de
bate and informed judgement, more
research and more cooperation with
NATO allies and others.
"I believe that stability depends on
power being in the hands of those
who are determined to preventwar,"
he said, but the United States no
longer has that dominating power
necessary. "What has greater prior
ity? Power or peace? In the United
States, the priority is peace.
"But in Russia," he said, "I see evi
dence that power has gained prior
ity. The Russians want power only —
in order to spread their benevolent
system all over the world. I am not
grateful for their efforts."

Directions, a student organization

"But the Russians can keep sec
rets, they have kept secrets and they
will keep secrets. How can we ratify a
treaty which limits us but effectively
does not limit the Russians?" Teller
queried.
Numbers game incomplete
"If they violate, abrogate,"
Panofsky offered as an appropriate
U.S. response to Soviet overstepping
of the bounds of a ratified SALT 11.
"The point is," he added, "that the
number of objects has become so
large that we can't continue enlarg
ing."
Panofsky was critical of the "over
emphasis on counting," citing other
factors which could determine the
outcome of a nuclear exchange.
"There are geographical, political

and command-and-control differ
ences," he said, "that cannot be
quantified and which can be deci
sive."
"What is in SALT II which prevents
us from countering a Russian threat,
if it is real?" he asked.
Soviet military might
"If there is an arms race, we are
losing it fast because the Russians
have surpassed us quantitatively,"
Teller noted.
"And we can't believe it because
we see only the public facet of Rus
sian society," he said. "We do not
see the military side, and their first
priority is to the military."
With SALT 11, however, "we need
less defensive spending to reach the
same level of security," Panofsky as
serted.
"If SALT is ratified, we will sit down
and do nothing," Teller replied.

Yet, "I see in our superiority in elec
tronics an excellent way in which we
could catch up with the Russians,
especially in defense systems."
Science ignores defense
Teller lamented the tendency of
America's scientists to concentrate
on pure theoretical science instead
of its practical, military applications.
Although (pure physics) "is more
fun," heattributed his own entry into
the field of weapons development to
the admonishment of former Presi
dent Franklin Roosevelt, who said,
"you scientists are accused of pro
ducing these deadly weapons, but if
you don't work for those weapons in
the free world, the free world will be
lost."
As Teller reaffirmed his stand
against the treaty, Panofsky de
manded, "I ask of those who are
critical, saying that SALT does not go
far enough — what do you proposeis

better if SALT II is not enacted?"
U.S. power waning
Teller further called for public de
bate and informed judgement, more
research and more cooperation with
NATO allies and others.
"I believe that stability depends on
power being in the hands of those
who are determined to preventwar,"
he said, but the United States no
longer has that dominating power
necessary. "What has greater prior
ity? Power or peace? In the United
States, the priority is peace.
"But in Russia," he said, "I see evi
dence that power has gained prior
ity. The Russians want power only —
in order to spread their benevolent
system all over the world. I am not
grateful for their efforts."

Two of the nation's most eminent
scientists squared off in a two-hour
debate Friday night as a preview of
the upcoming Senate floor discus
sion on the ratification of the
Strategic Arms Limitation
II) treaty.
Edward Teller, best known as the
inventor of the hydrogen bomb,
and Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), argued their cases in
an emotional but respectful exchange
before a packed audience in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
The passage of SALT II is the only
immediately available solution to the
arms race, according to Panofsky.
Teller, on the other hand, contended
that SALT II would contribute to U.S.
complacency and be detrimental to
American security.
Both men emphasized ideals and
goals rather than technical details.
"When is enough enough?"
Panofsky asked in reference to the
stockpiling and build-up of nuclear
weapons. He said he considered
"grossly irresponsible those critics
who claim support for arms control
while speaking out against SALT."
Although he does not intend to
pursue total disarmament, which he
termed unrealistic, he said that, "a
continued evolution of the arms race
(without SALT II) endangers the sec
urity of the free world."
Public enlightenment needed
The American people do not know
enough about SALT II to thoroughly
evaluate its merits, Teller countered.
"If SALT II is not ratified," he said,
" we will have a public debate on the
issue. That is why I don't want to see
SALT II ratified."
Teller made a distinction between

an arms race and a race in technol
ogy, saying that the current competi
tion centers on technology rather
than numbers. SALT II does not limit
new ideas, he said.
Conceptual blocks
"When you try to limit new ideas
you are in a very difficult situation.
You don't know what to limit. You
cannot limit what you have not even
dreamed of," Teller said.
In his rebuttal, Panofsky said, "if
he is right, if technology controls
man and not the other way around,
then the future is indeed dim.
Technology is the product of a chain.
You can apply restraints at different
parts of this chain ... It is the pur
pose of SALT" to controkthese de
velopments and their expansion, he
concluded.
But Teller deemed the imposition
of restraints on the Soviets impossi
ble. "The fact is that Americans can
not keep secrets. I don't think we
should keep secrets. It is against our
grain. It is against our heritage.
"But the Russians can keep sec
rets, they have kept secrets and they
