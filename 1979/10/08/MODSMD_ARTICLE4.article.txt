## Policy goals in jeopardy Soviets worry over future 
### 
Moscow (AP) — Problems
with the United States, japan
and China are bearing down on
the Kremlin as the first winter
snows fall in Moscow, leaving
some Soviet officials openly
worried about the way their
fortunes are going.
Western countries point

phasized to recent visitors that
they fear a "Washington-
Peking-Tokyo" alliance di
rected against the Soviet Un
ion.
In two weeks of disappoint
ing Moscow talks, Soviet and
Chinese delegations have
failed to even fix the agenda for

Soviet officials have emphasized to recent
visitors that they fear a Tokyo-
Wash in

with alarm to rising Soviet
military power and Kremlin
gains in some countries, but
the view from Moscow is far
from gleeful. Officials close to
the national leadership say that
despite some successes, major
goals of Soviet foreign policy
are now in serious jeopardy.
Although the Kremlin's offi
cial line is that the U.S. Senate
should ratify the SALT II arms
treaty as soon as possible,
senior Soviet observers admit
ted to visiting U.S. publishers
last week that they doubt the
accord will be approved before
1981.
SALT II delayed'
The furor over Soviet troops
in Cuba has wiped out chances
for ratification this year, the
publishers were told, and
Moscow expects election year
politics to block Senate action
in 1980.
While the strategic arms ac
cord — a top Soviet priority —
is being held up in the United
States, NATO leaders are re
viewing plans for deploying
powerful new Pershing-2 mis
siles in Western Europe that
could strike Soviet targets as
far away as the Volga River.
It is not certain that Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev's
weekend promise to reduce
Soviet forces in Central Europe
by up to 20,000 troops and 1000
tanks will bring an answering
gesture by NATO. The Western
alliance claims to be outnum
bered by Soviet forces — and
by much more than the
number Brezhnev promised to
withdraw.
Meanwhile, in the East,
Soviet officials have em

negotiations on "normalizing
relations" between the two
Communist giants.
Both sides have propagan
dized against each other viru
lently during the talks, another
sign the contacts are not going
well.
Japanese fears over growing
Soviet military potential have
drawn angry reactions in the
Soviet press. Japanese politi
cians have expressed particular

concern over a reported
build-up of Soviet forces on is
lands in the Kurile chain, seized
from Japan by the Russians
after World War II but still
claimed by Tokyo.
Growing political and milit
ary contacts among Japan,
China and the United States
have clearly alarmed Soviet
policy makers. They fear a flow
of sophisticated Japanese
technology to Moscow's
Chinese rivals, all with the
blessing of the Pentagon.
A Chinese-Japanese alliance
— whether formal or not —
would close a ring of instability
and potential enemies around
the Soviet Union. To the north
and west of the Soviet Union
stand the countries of NATO;
to the south, unstable Iran and
Afghanistan, pro-Western
Pakistan and archrival China;
to the east, South Korea and
Japan.
