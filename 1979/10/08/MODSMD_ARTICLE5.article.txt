# Pope criticized for view on women
## 
### Associated Press 
Priests, nuns and lay people reacted
swiftly — and strongly — after Pope John
Paul II stood firm against the ordination of
women as Roman Catholic priests.
"Needless to say, I disagree with him,"
said Maureen Reiff, a board member of
Chicago Catholic Women, a feminist
group. "We are all called by our baptism to
the priesthood — men and women alike."
Sister Jacqueline Merz said in Dallas that
she could see no theological or scriptural
basis for the ban on female priests. "My
own personal opinion is that it is a matter
of cultural difference . . . which means it's
sexism."
Speaking at a worship service of mainly
priests and nuns in the Philadelphia Civic
Center on Thursday, the pope said the
church's restriction of the priesthood to
men was the way "Cod has chosen to
shepherd his flock.
"Thechurch'straditional decision tocall
men to the priesthood, and not to call
women, is not a statement about human
rights nor an exclusion of women from
holiness and mission in the church."
Galling applause
He was interrupted by applause four
times during his remarks.
Sister Jacqueline, who is provincial

leader of the School Sisters of Notre Dame
in South Central United States as well as a
member of the National Core Commission
of the Women's Ordination Conference,
said the applause was particularly galling.
"I just watched the Holy Father on tele
vision and when he reaffirmed his position
about women in the ministry, I saw all
those priests get up and clap," she said.
"That, more than anything else, tells you
why we have not been ordained. They
didn't have to stand and applaud. They
could feel a little something tor us ... .
"Women have a unique gift to bring to
the ministry, and the church will be whole
when women are ordained," Sister Jac
queline added. "... I firmly believe that I
will be ordained someday."
But many believe that day is far off.
"Right now we're locked into the mind
set of the Middle Ages. In the luture,
maybe we can interpret the early teachings
in a more liberal way," said Jim Suntum,
32, one of 10,000 seminarians who heard
the pope's address at the Civic Center.
"If the pope someday would accept
women priests, so would I," he said.
'Prophetic tradition'
In his homily, John Paul said "the priest
hood was given by the Lord to 'the men he
himself had decided on' " in accord "with

the prophetic tradition."
But the place of tradition was ques
tioned by Catholic feminists Thursday.
"What happened back in the time of
Jesus was not the end of tradition . . .
people aren't locked in time," said Sister
Jacqueline. "Had Jesus come in a time
when women had different roles, I am
sure he would have ordained women."
Ms. Reiff challenged, "What's tradition?
It's man-made law. We've broken it many
times. We didn't used to eat meat on Fri
day. We do now."
Some said they were buoyed bythe pon
tiff's resistance in the face of pressures in
both the secular and religious worlds.
"I'm delighted that the Holy Father has
the courage to face the issue and to
squelch any possible active promotion of
women priests," said Teresa Gemazian, a
columnist for the Georgia Bulletin, a
Catholic newspaper in Atlanta.
"I feel that if Christ had wanted social
structures changed they would have been
changed" during his lifetime, she added.
But Claire Randall, general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, said in a
statement that neither the pope nor any
one else offers any "biblical or theological
basis for their belief that God intends for
only men to be priests."

'Prophetic tradition'
In his homily, John Paul said "the priest
hood was given by the Lord to 'the men he
himself had decided on' " in accord "with

the prophetic tradition."
But the place of tradition was ques
tioned by Catholic feminists Thursday.
"What happened back in the time of
Jesus was not the end of tradition . . .
people aren't locked in time," said Sister
Jacqueline. "Had Jesus come in a time
when women had different roles, I am
sure he would have ordained women."
Ms. Reiff challenged, "What's tradition?
It's man-made law. We've broken it many
times. We didn't used to eat meat on Fri
day. We do now."
Some said they were buoyed bythe pon
tiff's resistance in the face of pressures in
both the secular and religious worlds.
"I'm delighted that the Holy Father has
the courage to face the issue and to
squelch any possible active promotion of
women priests," said Teresa Gemazian, a
columnist for the Georgia Bulletin, a
Catholic newspaper in Atlanta.
"I feel that if Christ had wanted social
structures changed they would have been
changed" during his lifetime, she added.
But Claire Randall, general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, said in a
statement that neither the pope nor any
one else offers any "biblical or theological
basis for their belief that God intends for
only men to be priests."
