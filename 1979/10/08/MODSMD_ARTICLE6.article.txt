# Conservative trend could endanger Japan's democracy

### Susan Essoyan 
Political corruption and a
general swing to the right may
endanger Japan's American
style democracy, Tokyo Uni
versity Prof. Ryutaro Komiya
told an audience at the Hoover
Institute last week.
Komiya, economist and fa
culty dean of Japan's most pre
stigious university, cited public
opinion polls, voting records
and party platforms over the
past decade as evidence of the
swing to the right.
"The conservative camp has
conspicuously bolstered its
power over the past few years.
Gains have been made at the
expense of the Socialists and
Communists," he said.
Public opinion leaders in Ja
pan, most of whom used to
lean to the left, are now cen
trist or on the right, according
to Komiya. Even students are
becoming more conservative,
he added.
Komiya's remarks came on
the eve of Japan's general elec
tion yesterday for the House of
Representatives. General sur
veys indicate that conservative
forces are favored.
Komiya attributed the politi
cal shift to both international
and domestic factors. Interna
tionally, he said, Japan has
been buffeted by the oil crisis,
soybean embargo and verbal
attacks by other industrial na
tions over Japan's export pro
wess.
Many Japanese feel the ad
vanced countries are "using
Japan as a punching bag,"
Komiya noted. This sentiment
pushes the Japanese in a con
servative and nationalistic di
rection, he said.
After a century of trying to
catch up with the West, Japan
can now "stand shoulder to
shoulder" with it, he added.
Such psychological maturity
appears to foster introspection
and a renewed sense of self
worth, according to Komiya.
Domestically, the remarkable
record of the Japanese

economy gives the averagt
Japanese "much to protect,'
resulting in conservatism, he
said.
Komiya said he viewed tht
conservative trend with some
apprehension because of the
threat it poses to Japanese
democracy. The dominance of
money in conservative politics
worried him particularly, he
said.
"A situation in which only
those who have access to over
flowing coffers can stand for
election and step into power
can hardly be called democra
tic politics," he said.
Criticizing the prevalence of
corruption in Japan's ruling
Liberal-Democratic Party,
Komiya remarked that strict
rules on political funds, public
management of elections and
close inspection of corporate
practices will take time tocome
about in Japan.
"At no time in the past has so
much money been needed for
election," he said. "This is a
situation without parallel in
foreign countries."
Recent Japanese Suoreme
Court decisions also augur
"cloudy days" for civil liberties
as they narrowly interpret con
stitutional rights, he said.
Komiya also expressed con
cern over the effect of the con
servative trend on Japanese de
fense policies. Because Japan's
vulnerable geopolitical posi
tion requires that war not oc
cur, Komiya maintains that
military power has "little con
structive significance" for the
Japanese.
But moderation in defense
policy — Japan maintains only
Self-Defense Forces and
spends less than 1 percent of
its gross national product on
defense — is "in danger of
being abandoned," according
to Komiya.
Defense theorists support
ing a military build-up are play- ■
ing a more vocal vo\e and Vhe '•
Chinese are urging a larger
Japanese military capability.
