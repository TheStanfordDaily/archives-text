# Engine Co. 6 protects the Stanford area

Although there may not be
any Dalmations at the campus
fire station, the lack of a visible
mascot has not appeared to
have hurt the fire department.
Engine Co. 6 of Palo Alto Fire
Department, a group of dedi
cated and responsible public
servants, appeared to be able
to handle any emergency situa
tion with an extraordinary
amount of organization.
One of the captains, Gene
Proietti, has been a man of im
portance to the 36-man station
and the Palo Alto community
for 20 years, and he said he
loves his job.
"It's awful to say, but I rather

enjoy responding to calls, for
this is one of the few jobs
where you don't get to practice
your profession very often,"
he said. "I'd hate to work for3o
years and never go to a fire. It
would be very boring."
Yet the station house, which
is located across from Escon
dido Village, appears anything
but boring. There are, on the
average, four calls responded
toeachday. Intheirsparetime,
the firemen practice drills, per
form equipment checks, in
spect buildings, do house
work, cook dinner and exer
cise.
Unfortunately, most of the
calls received classify as false

alarms. Students accidentally
or intentionally pull the alarm
when there is no necessity for
assistance.
"Anyone is entitled to an ac
cident," said Proietti. "There
are lots of new students who
are not used to the fire boxes.
"But," he added, "we tend
to get annoyed when it is con
tinually in the same place or at
an early hour of the morning.
"If we have been asleep for
only one hour when a call
comes in, we feel dis
oriented," he said. "After two
or three hours when we've had
more sleep, it is a lot easier to
get up."
During the period of July 1 to

September 25, there were 1102
alarms at the station, 99 per
cent from the Stanford com
munity.
"We have no way of telling if
the call is a false alarm,"
explained Proietti. "When
someone pulls the handle on
the alarm, the number of the
box gets tapped into the dis
patcher at the station, checked
on a list of the campus' build
ings, and then the call is re
sponded to immediately. If
one pulls an alarm by mistake,"
the captain suggested,"it is
best to call 911 to relay to the
dispatcher that the situation is
not serious. The firemen still
have to come out and reset the
alarm box, but they don't have
to prepare for a big fire. It eases
their minds."
Hazards
The last fire that caused great
concern occurred five years

ago at Encina Hall. Mutual aid
from nearby departments was
required to extinguish the
blaze. Proietti was unsure how
the fire started, but he pointed
out that the old buildings on
campus where chemicals are
stored are the biggest fire
hazards.
Also, the big old dorms con
taining "cubby hole" rooms,
attics and bad wiring leave
something to be desired, he
said, but the University is
doing their best with smoke
detectors and alarms.
Proietti added that inspec
tion programs set up by the fire
department are checking out
many of the hazards.
First aid
Although the firemen at En
gine Co. 6 serve a dual purpose
of putting out fires and taking
all the first-aid calls, four
trained paramedics with medi

cal expertise are also housed at
the station. With their know
ledge and equipment, they
bring the emergency room
right to the victim's house.
Yet before the paramedics
will respond to a call, firemen
must first determine the seri
ousness of the situation.
According to Proietti, if the
firefighters cannot handle the
emergency because signs such
as shortness of breath and
chest pains persist, the
paramedics will arrive and
quickly set up a correspon
dence with physicians in a
hospital.
Atmosphere full of energy
The atmosphere at the sta
tion is full of energy. Each man
devotes himself entirely to the
fire department for 24 straight
hours and then rests for at least
one day, and at most four.
"Everyone gets along well,"
said Proietti. "There are two
other captains here, Kady and
Foley. The battalion chief re
sides at the station also," he
added.

"We have one woman and
she does a great job," he said.
"Although I think she would
have a hard time carrying me
down a ladder, she excels at
her job and adds to the unique
atmosphere.
"Emergencies are the only
tense times," said Proeitti.
"When that alarm goes off, the
men know the captain is in
charge, and every order is to be
followed. Ordinarily, how
ever, no one gives orders;
everyone gets treated the
same," he said.
Proietti said he likes the at
mosphere in the area as well.
"The kids are pretty loose and
very friendly. They wave as we
pass by on the truck. This kind
of behavior also holds true for
the Palo Alto community.
There are many professionals
in this city, and they don't give
us many hassles."
In a survey of Palo Alto,
Mondays were determined to
be the firemen's busiest days.
"Yet," said Proietti and a
paramedic, "There is always
something happening."
