# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Keep 'Chief' off the field 
### 
What under any other circumstances
would have been one of the happiest mo
ments in recent Stanford history, Satur
day's dramatic win over UCLA, was marred
by the appearance of, and generally favor
able crowd reaction to, Timm Williams,
alias Chief, alias Prince Lightfoot.
Shortly before the end of the halftime
performance, Williams and several large
menacing body guards wearing "Bring
Back Chief l ightfoot" T-shirts were admit r
ted to the playing field and pompously
paraded around the track to the cheers of
many students, alumni and fans.
Granted, there were some persons who
courageously showed their distaste for Wil
liams' presence, but for the most part, the
crowd showed an amazing insensitivity to
the dehumanizing portrayal of native
Americans that goes hand-in-hand with the
Indian mascot.
Those who clapped and cheered for Wil
liams and his goon squad were, whether
consciously or not, telling native American
students here that their opinions and feel
ings are unimportant and undeserving of
consideration in the Indian mascot debate.
The Band also showed its ignorance of
the issue by repeatedly having the bass
drummer start a "war chant" drum beat
that the crowd readily joined in with
rhythmic clapping. And by allowing Wil
liams to "dance" as it played the native
American fanfare following the game, the
Band lent its name to the movement to re
turn Williams and the Indian mascot here.
It is these very actions by some crowd
members and the Band that give the bac
kers of the Indian mascot the ammunition
they need in their futile effort to return
racism to the Stanford mascot.
The people who lend their support to the
movement must realize the implications of
doing so. It is not simply a movement to
return a long-lost tradition to the Farm, nor
is it harmless fun. Itamountstoadirectslap
in the face to the native American students

here and their many supporters who have
long resisted the efforts to return the native
American stereotype as the University mas
cot.
We urge the University to find out how
Williams and his heavies were allowed onto
the playing field. None of them held field
passes. Is this the beginning of a new athle
tic department policy on accessability to
the field? Has native American headdress
replaced the field pass as a ticket to the
bermuda grass in the stadium?
And more importantly, will Williams be
allowed onto the field for the next home
game in three weeks? By letting him onto
the field Saturday it will be much more dif
ficult to justify keeping him off in the fu
ture. We would hate to think that fear of
saying no to the goon squad Saturday was
the reason for offending so many of us.
Whether it was realized at the time or
not, it is a fact that Williams' presence on
the field in his costume gives the Indian
mascot movement the credibility and
media exposure it so dearly needs to stay
alive. It also gave to anyone unfamiliar with
the history of the mascot controversy here
the clear impression that the mascot of ath
letic teams here is the Indian.
The University must never again allow
Williams onto the field in his native Ameri
can costume. To do so only gives legitimacy
to the Indian mascot movement.
By wearing the Indian T-shirts or red
feathers and by cheering when Williams
appears at football games, persons,
whether in support of the mascot or not,
are showing their willingness to offend a
sizable portion of students, alumni and
Stanford fans.
We hope enough members of the com
munity will take the time to thoughtfully
consider howtheiractionsin support of the
Indian mascot exemplified their willing
ness to offend a minority group, here or
elsewhere.
