## Avoid ulcers, leave guilt behind 
### 
Without the right excuses,
students can lead such guilty
lives. In our dogged dedication
to higher education we can be
trapped in reprehension. That
is: if we are not studying, we
feel guilty.
Studying requires concent
ration, but concentration can
fade. Studying requires mental
exercise, but we all have mo
ments of fatigue. Yet when the
work piles up, as it always
does, we are caught; if we sit
down to the books we are mis
erable with distraction, if we
do not, we are miserable with
guilt. We risk our mental
health against our mental
acuity.
This guilt phenomenon is
not uncommon. Explicit
symptoms are well known —
limited social life, two-tone
highlighted textbooks, a
meticulously detailed assign
ment calendar, etc. Severely
affected students can be seen
at the library borrowing stacks
of "selected references."
Many other students,
though affected by guilt, rep
ress it. Their symptoms man
ifest in peculiar ways. Sitting at
the back of the classroom, or

wearing loudly clumping san
dals, or frequently using vul
gar slang expressions are typi
cal signs.
A student who suddenly
plans a two course overload
next quarter almost surely suf
fers subliminal guilt. Why a
university has such a high
population of potentially guilty
people has not, regretfully,
been studied. Certainly selec
tive admission and natural
selection both have a role.
Guilt can inhibit the spirit,
tarnish the college experience,
and ruin a perfectly fine even
ing. But there is no need for it.
Below is a list of diversions and
palliatives known to assuage an
uncomfortable conscience.
The ideas are not new, and the
list is by no means exhaustive.
Students are urged to give
these rationalizations a try. Re
lieve guilt. The next time atten
tion wanders and an intellec
tual intermission is required,
take heart, take a break, use
one of these suggestions, and
breath easy.
—Sit with your friends and
discuss the tenuous relevance
of your course work to your
true goals. It is reassuring to

argue that, if you were study
ing, you would be studying the
wrong thing.
—Recall the difficulty of
learning anything on an empty
stomach, and go get some
thing to eat. This is the Food for
Thought postulate.
—Promise yourself that if
you take a break now you will
spend the entire next weekend
catching up and even, by the
strength of heaven, working
ahead. Old, but faithful.
—Make yourself comforta
ble; lie down on your bed to
study. You will probably fall
asleep before guilt has a
chance to sneak in.
—Do something else you
should do, such as clean your
room or write to your parents.

(Some students have been so
desperate they have even cho
sen to wash dishes.)
—Go to the library. Spend
half an hour finding a friend to
go with you, take your time
getting there, try several tables
to study at, wander through
the stacks until you find an in
teresting book, realize it is late,
and go home.
—Take a highlighter pen and
underline the entire chapter.
—College is a place to de
velop social skills. Go out and
do some developing. It is only
through practice . . .
—Help someone else with
their studying.
—Realize that if you take a
nap now you will be able to

study much more productively
later.
—Copy over your notes and
organize your papers; figure
out the confusing things only
after you are completely ar
ranged.
—Remember the old adage
— sound mind, sound body —
then dig out your racket or jog
to the gym.
—Work on something of
strong personal interest while
telling yourself that it is "just as
valid an educational experi
ence."
—Write copy for the school
newspaper.
