What's
coming up
foryou
this term?
□ Good health.
□ Medical bills you
never expected.
We're with you—let's hope it's good health. But if you're
hit with medical bills you never expected—we can still be
with you, ready to help pay those bills.
Your Student Health Service is an excellent health plan
as far as it goes. But it has certain limitations in benefits
that leave you vulnerable to unexpected medical bills. For
example, SHS does not protect your dependents. It does
not cover you for injuries or treatment beyond seven miles
of the university, hospitalization, acute care or surgery.
And it does not furnish health care benefits for off-quarter
students. That's why you need a back-up plan for SHS!
Take it from us, our two Blue Cross Student Health Group
Plans have been accepted for years by Stanford students
because they provide these important benefits not included
in your SHS plan. Sign up today!
For information and application,
