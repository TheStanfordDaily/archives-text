# Districting on ballot once again

### Christina Gavin 
A student referendum to again
place ari ASSU Senate districting
proposal on the spring quarter ballot
will be voted on in the Oct. 16 and 17
election.
The new referendum solicits stu
dent opinion on the division of the
campus into voting districts. Under
graduate districts would be demar
cated geographically by residence
while, on the graduate level, districts
would be drawn on a departmental
basis.
A potential senator would be per
mitted to run in the district of his
choice, but voters would be limited
to their particular districts. Sup
posedly, each district would thus be
served by a senator attuned to the
interest of his constituents, accord
ing to former senators.
Passage of the referendum would
only allow the senate to begin draft
ing a constitutional amendment to
appear on the spring ballot.
"Personally, I feel (districting) is a
'rhange for the good. I think we
should try it, but it might not make
that much of a difference," said Tom
Cart, a member of the Council of
Presidents (COP) and last year's co
chairman of the senate rules commit
tee.
Crad districting 'important'
Cart called districting even more
important on the graduate level be
cause graduates are more in
tradepartmental. "On the under
graduate level, informal districting
might be just as effective (as formal
districting), but senators might feel
more obligated to their constituents
if there was a formal amendment,"
he said.
Districting would be "convenient
for the campaignerand the student,"
according to former senate chairper
son George Drysdale, because ef
forts could be effectively concen
trated instead of scattered around
the campus.
Drysdale advocated the use of
staggered elections to elect some
senators in spring for the following
autumn term and the rest during
spring in the traditional manner. He
claimed that such action would con
tribute to more efficiency in student
government by avoiding the
"month-and-a-half dead period" be
tween the beginning of autumn
quarter and the first convening of the
senate.
Live petitions dropped
The idea of live petitions, a system
by which any person collecting 200 or
more signatures would automatically
enjoy a seat on the senate, received
attention last year. Both Drysdale
and Gart now reject that concept.
Gart termed it "unrealistic," while
Drysdale foresaw problems in trying
to authenticate signatures.
A controversial constitutional
amendment on districting appeared
on the spring ballot last year but
failed to receive the required two
thirds favorable vote for implemen
tation. Drysdale explained that the
confused wording of the proposition
and the fact that the amendment ap
peared at the bottom of the ballot
may have contributed to its only 59
percent approved rating.
Senators last year said that "dis
tricting would provide tighter links
between the senators and their con
stituents. Campaigns would be re
