# Political games, funding trouble minority grads

Minority graduate students here suf
fer more from political disadvantages
and economic constraints than from in
adequate academic skills, a panel of
minority graduate students said Thurs
day. The panelists spoke at a Learning
Assistance Center (LAC)-sponsored
seminaron the special problems minor
ity graduates face.
"Minority students are astounded by
the political wheeling and dealing that
goes on within departments here,"
Lynn Burbridge, a graduate student in
economics, said. According to her,
minority students are often at a disad
vantage when it comes to handling the
intradepartmental politics involved in
obtaining grants, doing research and
exercising influence.
"We need political counselors more
than academic counselors," she said.
"It's a hazy area that nobody wants to
deal with," she added.
Students realize early in their careers
that attending graduate school means
more than class attendance, research
and writing, Burbridge said. Graduate
life includes establishing contacts for

jobs, keeping up on the latest de
partmental newsand carefully handling
personal relations, she said.
Members of the panel agreed that
differing cultural outlooks lead to less
direct interaction with professors,
which can be politically disadvantage
ous.
Profs seem distant
"Generally, I don't feel close to my
professors," said Melinda Melendez, a
graduate student in education, who is

mvolved in the Chicano Fellows prog
ram.
Professors tend to be viewed as au
thority figures, she said, and minority
students are reluctant to approach
them. The faculty in turn fail to reach
out to students, resulting in a com
munication problem, she added.
As a result, minority students can eas
ily fall out of the social framework of a
department, the speakers noted, with
adverse consequences on their ability

to perform academically.
Nowhere to go
Tsinina Carr, a native American stu
dent in anthropology, noted that few
faculty members have an active interest
in minority affairs. Minority students
often have no place to turn when
faced with special problems which may
not affect non-minority students, she
said.This is particularly true for stu
dents who do not intend to pursue
academics following graduation, Carr

added.
Owing to this social alienation and
lack of communication, non-minority
people here often characterize minor
ity students as "stand-offish," accord
ing to Burbridge. Such views only frus
trate the students' attempts to cope
with departmental politics, she said.
At the same time, minority students
often face economic pressures, the
panel noted. Funding for minority stu
dents is dwindling Carr said, and stu-

dents who lose scholarship and found
ation funding have few alternative
sources available.
Financial aid poses problem
"Many people think minority stu
dents always receive a lot of money,"
Melendez said. "Actually, many minor
ity students receive no financial aid."
The political and economic problems
which minority students face are harder
to deal with than inadequacies in
academic skills, Burbridge noted."l'm
not saying that white students don't
have similar problems," Burbridge
said," but these are even harder to deal
with for minority students.
Help each other
Trial and error appears to be the best
strategy for dealing with political and
economic problems, Carr advised. "It
helps if there are other minority stu
dents around to help you," Melendez
added.
Because social support can be in
valuable in this context, the panel said
they viewed the decline in minority en
rollment as particularly alarming.
