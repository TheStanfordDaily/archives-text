# Residents unite to fight rape
## 
### Ed Molyneaux 
Concern over the number of
rapes recently reported at Col
lege Terrace prompted more
than 200 persons to attend a
College Terrace Residential
Association meeting held last
week to discuss methods of
combating the problem.
According to Detective Brian
Viefra of the Palo Alto Police
Department, it is especially
important for women living
alone in that area to secure
their property against attack.
Three women have been as
saulted in their College Terrace
homes within the last five

months, he said.
Police believe one man is re
sponsible for all three assaults,
in addition to the seven others
reported at College Terrace
from 1971 to 1976. In all cases,
the assailant disconnected the
electricity, then entered
through an unlocked door or
window.
All of the women attacked
were living alone which has led
police to believe the rapist
selects his victims carefully,
probably after extensive prowl
ing.
Palo Alto Police Sergeant
Mike Meloy urged residents to
learn to recognize their
neighbors and to call police
immediately if they see any
strangers loitering in the area.
"Several times we've ques
tioned the neighbors after a
rape has taken place, and
they've said, 'Oh yeah, we did
see someone hanging around
that night,' " Meloy said.
Meloy said residents can
help protect themselves by in
stalling boxes over their elec
tricity meters to prevent the
wires from being cut.
Other protective devices in
clude lights which automati
cally turn on when the electric
ity goes off. Simple bolts for
locking windows left open a
few inches allow aircirculation

but prevent break-in.
"At least lock your windows
and doors," Meloy said.
Women from the Mid-
Peninsula Rape Crisis Center
gave a slide presentation and a
representative spoke about
what a woman should do when
attacked.
"There is no pat answer,
fudge the situation and try to
deal with it" she said. "Are you
dealing with someone who is
so angry that if you look at him
wrong he might hurt you, or
does he look like you might be
able to intimidate him?"
Every woman should pre
pare herself so she is not taken
by surprise, she advised. For
example, when you're driving
down the highway, scream so
that you know you can do it.
"Don't look vulnerable,
don't act vulnerable, and don't
be vulnerable if you can help
it," she concluded.
The rape center operates a
24-hour hotline for rape vic
tims and their families. It also
organized support groups for
rape victims and refers callers
to medical facilities and coun
seling services.
"Most important, the line
provides someone to talk to,"
said one spokeswoman.
The rape crisis line may be
reached by calling 493-RAPE.
