# Fixing your flat
## In search of the perfect inner tube? 
### Steve Brown 
Whether you ride a unicycle,
3-speed or 10-speed, you're
bound to experience that mo
ment of anger and frustration
when your machine of chrome
and rubber becomes instantly
useless. Any time you ride your
bicycle you risk the trouble of a
flat tire.
The Campus Bike Shop
charges $5.50 to replace an
inner tube and has a waiting
period that is presently two
days or longer. Doing the job
yourself can be faster, less es
pensive and easy when you
know how.
Your first task is to bring the
bike to a place where it can be
repaired. Riding any further
would not only be uncomfort
able but may damage both the
tire and inner tube and possi
bly the wheel rim.
To start, you must remove
the wheel from the frame. If
you have quick-release knobs
this can be done with a turn of
the hand, otherwise you'll
need to unscrew the two nuts
with a wrench.

Never use pliers or you'll risk
rounding the corners of the
nuts. If you remove the back
wheel, you'll have to re
member which sprocket the
chain is on and how it passes
through the derailleur.
The best way to remove one
edge or "bead'' of the tire is
with hook shaped "tire irons"
that cost about $2.50, but if
you're careful not to puncture
the inner tube you can use two
screwdrivers. Wrapping them
in newspaper should protect
your rim and inner tube from
damage.
Insert one between the rim
and a bead of the tire and pry
up the edge as you rotate the
handle downward. Have
someone hold this screwdriver
in place while you do the same
with another about five inches
away. Now that part of the
edge of your tire is over the rim
you can pull the rest of that
edge over with your hands.
The next step is to move the
attached and unattached edges
of the tire to one side so that

the valve can be pushed up
through its hole and the inner
tube removed. This black
monster costs $3.00 and you
can simply replace it. Other
wise it's easy to repair minor
leaks with a patch kit that
costs 75cents to $1.50 and fixes
up to 30 flats.
Find the leak in the inner
tube by filling a sink with water
and inflating the tube with an
air pump. As you rotate the
inner tube through the water,
you'll spot the puncture where
you see air bubbles rising.
Cut a corner off of your
patching material and shape it
to the size of the puncture,
leaving a V*" border. With the
metal buffer in your kit, buff a
large area around the hole, and
then apply a small amount of
cement, spreading it evenly.
Depending on the instruc
tions, you should either wait
until this dries or remove the
backing from the patch and
press it onto the cement. In
either case apply enough pres

sure to bond the patch sec
urely.
Before inserting the inner
tube, scan the inside of the tire
forany nail, thorn or staple that
might still be stuck there.
Move both edges of the tire
to one side and push the valve
down through the hole in the
wheel. Place the tube evenly
inside the tire. You can begin
to work the edge of the tire
over the rim with your hands,
but near the end it may be
come so tight that you'll need
to use screwdrivers or tire
irons again.
Now attach the wheel to the
bicycle frame, keeping it cen
tered between the two forks
and brakes as you tighten the
nuts or quick release. If this is a
rear tire, you'll need to put the
chain back through the derail
leur and onto the same sproc
ket.
After the tire is inflated, your
bicycle is ready to ride. Fixing
the flat tire should have taken
less than an hour and saved a
trip to a bicycle repair shop!
