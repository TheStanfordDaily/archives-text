# 'ID' majors-a focus on interests
## 
### Rose Cecile Chan 
In making the change from
being a UOO (undeclared)
major to "someone who
knows what he's going to do"
few students decide to create
their own major.
Presently, only 30 students
are undertakingan individually
designed major at the Univer
sity, according to Anne Co
xon, director of the Academic
Information Center (AIC).
"Normally, people do it be
cause they have a particular in
terest that they feel can't be
met by any one department.
Or, their interest may be more
focused than if they did a mul
tiple major," said Coxon. With
the ID major, irrelevant cour
sework required by the de
partments can be avoided.
In David Bohrer's case, the
decision to become an ID
major was "part of a sopho
more year slump or confu
sion— the classic case of 'What
am I going to do?' I'd been in
volved with the SLE (Structured
Liberal Education) program,
and I really felt like I had some
interest in history and political
thought and economics.
"I didn't know what to do
with it all, but I felt it was all
related somehow." Bohrer is
now a senior in Modern Politi
cal Theory, which explores
political and economic institu
tions and their origins.
Urban Studies and the newer
British Studies are popular
core programs. Professor Eric
Hutchinson, Committee
Chairman of the ID program,
recalls such combinations as
Dance with Art and Literature,
and Computer Science with

Language.
"They are generally encour
aged, but the bulk of the work
falls on the student for writing
the proposal and choosing the
advisors. It's very much indi
vidual initiative that brings
someone in here in the first
place,' Coxon said.
According to Hutchinson,
the committee watches for cer
tain characteristics in the
majors brought to them for ap
proval. It discourages students
who plan overly professional
majors which look more like
training for graduate school

'It forces you to think of what you really
want out of your undergraduate education

than a good undergraduate
program. It studies the stu
dent's interests carefully to en
sure that his or her needs can
not be met through a regular
department.
"We have become good at
detecting ID majors which try
to cut down requirements of
departments. We deal with
those very sharply. Those are
much less frequent than they
used to be. Students seem to
understand the purpose of
the ID program much better."
The major reason proposals
are turned down is lack of
coherence, said Hutchinson
"What we generally do is
suggest the students talk to this
or that professor and see
whether they can't try to tie the
thing more coherently."

Courses are sometimes
suggested and the student is
asked to come back with revi
sions.
One of the first students in
the 5-year old program, Larry
Diamond graduated with a de
gree in Political Organizations
and Behavior, in which he
studied the sociological and
psychological aspects of poli
tics.
"The interesting thing is how
much my major contributed to
what I'm doing now. The fact
that I have that background is
probably why I was selected as

Contemporary Studies in San
Francisco -- a public policy
think tank." Diamond is also
finishing his Ph.D. dissertation
for his degree in political
sociology from the University's
Sociology Department.
"I have never for a minute
regretted going the route of an
interdepartmental major, and I
have often received very tangi
ble benefits for having done
so," said Diamond.
"I didn't encounter any real
problems. The main thing is
you have to take more initia
tive. Things can get a little
more confusing. One of the
important things is to choose
your advisor carefully."
Diamond felt the faculty was
very helpful to him throughout
the program.

Bohrer, on the other hand,
says, "With hindsight, I would
have gone into the ecohomics
department and made a strong
effort to take a lot of history.
It's much less hassle to major in
a regular department, and now
I see how I could have gotten
to the material in a regular de
partment. In no way does that
make me regret having gone
through the process. The ad
vantage of the program is get
ting a person to sit down and
think about his goals."
"It forces you to think of
what you really want out of
your undergraduate educa
tion," Diamond said.
"The best thing is to take a
direction and give it a good try
but to realize you can change it
at a certain point," said
Bohrer. "People try to fit ev
erything they want to do into
four years. I think we put more
pressure on ourselves than we
need to."
What is the ID major? "You
can call it a challenge," said
Diamond, "or just an oppor
tunity to dream a little bit and
explore."

aged, but the bulk of the work
falls on the student for writing
the proposal and choosing the
advisors. It's very much indi
vidual initiative that brings
someone in here in the first
place,' Coxon said.
According to Hutchinson,
the committee watches for cer
tain characteristics in the
majors brought to them for ap
proval. It discourages students
who plan overly professional
majors which look more like
training for graduate school

'It forces you to think of what you really
want out of your undergraduate education

than a good undergraduate
program. It studies the stu
dent's interests carefully to en
sure that his or her needs can
not be met through a regular
department.
"We have become good at
detecting ID majors which try
to cut down requirements of
departments. We deal with
those very sharply. Those are
much less frequent than they
used to be. Students seem to
understand the purpose of
the ID program much better."
The major reason proposals
are turned down is lack of
coherence, said Hutchinson
"What we generally do is
suggest the students talk to this
or that professor and see
whether they can't try to tie the
thing more coherently."

Courses are sometimes
suggested and the student is
asked to come back with revi
sions.
One of the first students in
the 5-year old program, Larry
Diamond graduated with a de
gree in Political Organizations
and Behavior, in which he
studied the sociological and
psychological aspects of poli
tics.
"The interesting thing is how
much my major contributed to
what I'm doing now. The fact
that I have that background is
probably why I was selected as

Contemporary Studies in San
Francisco -- a public policy
think tank." Diamond is also
finishing his Ph.D. dissertation
for his degree in political
sociology from the University's
Sociology Department.
"I have never for a minute
regretted going the route of an
interdepartmental major, and I
have often received very tangi
ble benefits for having done
so," said Diamond.
"I didn't encounter any real
problems. The main thing is
you have to take more initia
tive. Things can get a little
more confusing. One of the
important things is to choose
your advisor carefully."
Diamond felt the faculty was
very helpful to him throughout
the program.

Bohrer, on the other hand,
says, "With hindsight, I would
have gone into the ecohomics
department and made a strong
effort to take a lot of history.
It's much less hassle to major in
a regular department, and now
I see how I could have gotten
to the material in a regular de
partment. In no way does that
make me regret having gone
through the process. The ad
vantage of the program is get
ting a person to sit down and
think about his goals."
"It forces you to think of
what you really want out of
your undergraduate educa
tion," Diamond said.
"The best thing is to take a
direction and give it a good try
but to realize you can change it
at a certain point," said
Bohrer. "People try to fit ev
erything they want to do into
four years. I think we put more
pressure on ourselves than we
need to."
What is the ID major? "You
can call it a challenge," said
Diamond, "or just an oppor
tunity to dream a little bit and
explore."
In making the change from
being a UOO (undeclared)
major to "someone who
knows what he's going to do"
few students decide to create
their own major.
Presently, only 30 students
are undertakingan individually
designed major at the Univer
sity, according to Anne Co
xon, director of the Academic
Information Center (AIC).
"Normally, people do it be
cause they have a particular in
terest that they feel can't be
met by any one department.
Or, their interest may be more
focused than if they did a mul
tiple major," said Coxon. With
the ID major, irrelevant cour
sework required by the de
partments can be avoided.
In David Bohrer's case, the
decision to become an ID
major was "part of a sopho
more year slump or confu
sion— the classic case of 'What
am I going to do?' I'd been in
volved with the SLE (Structured
Liberal Education) program,
and I really felt like I had some
interest in history and political
thought and economics.
"I didn't know what to do
with it all, but I felt it was all
related somehow." Bohrer is
now a senior in Modern Politi
cal Theory, which explores
political and economic institu
tions and their origins.
Urban Studies and the newer
British Studies are popular
core programs. Professor Eric
Hutchinson, Committee
Chairman of the ID program,
recalls such combinations as
Dance with Art and Literature,
and Computer Science with
