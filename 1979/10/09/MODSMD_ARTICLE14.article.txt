# Med School boasts continued high minority enrollment
## 
### Kati Andreasson 
In )une of 1978, the Supreme Court handed
down the Bakke decision, banning reverse
discrimination and special minority quotas at
educational institutions.
Special admissions committees have now
been discontinued, and all applicants are
considered in one admissions process, al
though race may be considered a factor in the
process.
Major concern was voiced at the potential
blow inflicted on affirmative action prog
rams, and many feared a substantial drop in
the minority enrollment in universities and
graduate schools.
At the University Medical School, how
ever, the concern has been unwarranted, ac
cording to John Steward, associate dean of
students at the Medical School.
The incoming class of 1979 boasts a 22 per
cent minority enrollment, and the number
of minority applications has jumped from 489
in 1978 to 580 in 1979.
Exception
Yet the Medical School seems to be the
exception, and not the rule. A study underta
ken by the American Association of Medical
Colleges (AAMC) shows that out of 121
schools examined in 1978 only eight carried
15 percent or more minority students, with
Stanford ranking fourth after the University
of California at Irvine, the University of New
Mexico and Michigan State University.
The number of undergraduate black, Mex
ican American, native American and main
land Puerto Rican students attending predo
minantly white universities has risen sharply
since the late 19605. This promising increase
has been much less pronounced in graduate
schools, and particularly in medical schools.
In the late 19605, the AAMC made it an objec
tive to increase the enrollment of minority
students to 12 percent. In the ten years that
have passed, the highest level attained was
9.7 percent in 1974.
Steward said that an "adequate pool of
qualified minority students has not yet been
built up to allow all medical schools to attract
a 15 percent enrollment."
Competing for applicants
Santiago Rodrigues, of the Affirmative Ac-

tion Office in the Quad here, adds that all
graduate programs are "competing" for
good, high-caliber minority students.
A number of reasons could be attributed to
the absence of a large "pool" of minority
candidates.
Harold Boyd, associate dean of students,
points out that the major obstacle for these
students is a financial one. Almost 85 percent
of the minority students entering medical
school this year need some form of financial
assistance and therefore begin working im
mediately after college graduation.
Financial hardship
Continued graduate studies would prove
to be a considerable financial hardship for
the students and their families. As industries,
for example, are avidly recruiting qualified
minorities with B.S. degrees, Dean Boyd
said, "It is hard to resist an interesting job,
with a competitive salary and good chances
for promotion."
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant provost tor fa
culty affairs and assistant to the president for
Chicano affairs, referred also to the absence
of "role models." The percentage of minority
graduate students and especially of faculty is
disproportionately small, and encourage
ment for these students is lacking.
Although the Medical School now accom
modates a comfortable amount of minority
students, there is not one minority faculty
member.
No minority faculty
The Medical School has yet to attract one
minority medical student into academic
medicine. "We desperately need minority
faculty members," said Dr. Steward.
Boyd also pointed out that the "aggressive
recruiting" of the early 1970s has fizzled
down considerably. This "erosion of in
terest," as Burciaga phrased it, has come
about because "we are no longer a priority
item on the agenda," adding that the crisis
detonated after the assassination of Martin
Luther King has been brought under control
with affirmative action and equal opportun
ity. Yet, Burciaga said, "commitment, the
trigger word, has dwindled."

15 percent or more minority students, with
Stanford ranking fourth after the University
of California at Irvine, the University of New
Mexico and Michigan State University.
The number of undergraduate black, Mex
ican American, native American and main
land Puerto Rican students attending predo
minantly white universities has risen sharply
since the late 19605. This promising increase
has been much less pronounced in graduate
schools, and particularly in medical schools.
In the late 19605, the AAMC made it an objec
tive to increase the enrollment of minority
students to 12 percent. In the ten years that
have passed, the highest level attained was
9.7 percent in 1974.
Steward said that an "adequate pool of
qualified minority students has not yet been
built up to allow all medical schools to attract
a 15 percent enrollment."
Competing for applicants
Santiago Rodrigues, of the Affirmative Ac-

tion Office in the Quad here, adds that all
graduate programs are "competing" for
good, high-caliber minority students.
A number of reasons could be attributed to
the absence of a large "pool" of minority
candidates.
Harold Boyd, associate dean of students,
points out that the major obstacle for these
students is a financial one. Almost 85 percent
of the minority students entering medical
school this year need some form of financial
assistance and therefore begin working im
mediately after college graduation.
Financial hardship
Continued graduate studies would prove
to be a considerable financial hardship for
the students and their families. As industries,
for example, are avidly recruiting qualified
minorities with B.S. degrees, Dean Boyd
said, "It is hard to resist an interesting job,
with a competitive salary and good chances
for promotion."
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant provost tor fa
culty affairs and assistant to the president for
Chicano affairs, referred also to the absence
of "role models." The percentage of minority
graduate students and especially of faculty is
disproportionately small, and encourage
ment for these students is lacking.
Although the Medical School now accom
modates a comfortable amount of minority
students, there is not one minority faculty
member.
No minority faculty
The Medical School has yet to attract one
minority medical student into academic
medicine. "We desperately need minority
faculty members," said Dr. Steward.
Boyd also pointed out that the "aggressive
recruiting" of the early 1970s has fizzled
down considerably. This "erosion of in
terest," as Burciaga phrased it, has come
about because "we are no longer a priority
item on the agenda," adding that the crisis
detonated after the assassination of Martin
Luther King has been brought under control
with affirmative action and equal opportun
ity. Yet, Burciaga said, "commitment, the
trigger word, has dwindled."
