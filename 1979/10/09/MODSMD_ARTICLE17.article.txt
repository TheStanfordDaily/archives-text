## Homophobia, feminism linked 
### 
Several years ago I read in
the newspaper of a man who
called himself a feminist. At the
time I wondered what he could
possibly mean by that and re
member thinking he was prob
ably a faggot. I simple couldn't
Conceptualize a man actively
supporting the women's
movement and still being
"fully male."
Much and little has changed
since then.
Today I can imagine few
more important issues than
feminism and if I hear the word
|"faggot" it connotes only
bigotry on the accuser's part. I
am not unique in this regard.
Many men, at some level,
have changed their attitudes
towards women and gay men.
But while we may have no
problems loudly proclaiming
support for the Equal Rights
Amendment and shaking our
heads at Anita Bryant and her
like, I wonder how much our
personal interactions have
changed.
It is all well and good to sup
port legislation banning dis
crimination against women
and minorities, but the most
important changes are on a
personal level and involve
seemingly trivial and com
monly accepted practices such
as viewing all women in terms
of their sexual appeal.
How often do all-male con
versations degenerate into dis
cussions of the new freshman
crop of women — their bodies
and potential yield — or at
least comment on the "incred

ible pair of knockers" ap
proaching across White Plaza.
This is a common occurrence
in my experience.
Though I frnd talk of women
only in terms of their sexual
appeal degrading — to both
women and rYien — my usual
reaction is silence. This is a
cop-out on my part and is pre
cipitated by a vague, powerful
control lurking in the back of
my mind.
Characterizing women by
their physical attributes is so
common that though I firmly
believe it is wrong (without
denying at all the idea of
beauty), I find myself wonder
ing if men think that because I
don't "appreciate" women's
bodies I'm weird; that is
slightly queer, gay — a faggot.
Much and little has changed.
Pervasive homophobia
This might be an exagger
ated paranoia of mine, but I
think that homophobia — a
fear of homosexuality incited
by the smallest, most innocu
ous cues such as touching
another man instead of slap
ping him heartily is a perva
sive concern in American soci
ety. And certainly it exists in
dependent of feminism, but
for men attempting to change
their behavior towards women
the two are closely linked —
sometimes locked, it seems.
Feminism is an ardent con
cern of mine, but I certainly
don't claim to be free of
chauvinism or to have any con
crete answers. I just feel a need
to explore the role of a male in

the women's movement. What
seems patently clear, and from
my personal experience in
credibly difficult, is that the
first thing men can do to sup
port women is to change them
selves. This creates a number
of problems and benefits.
Shed 'macho armour'
Men in many ways are as
straight-jacketed in our
stereotypic sex roles as women
are in theirs. To be able to shed
this macho armour for some
thing more comfortable would
enrich everyone's lives. A
problem is that once a man be
gins to change, starts to break
out of the traditional male
mold, he may feel bereft of
support just when he is begin
ning to understand his need
for it.
Other men who are making
similar changes are scarce, it
seems, while the women's
movement itself is justifiably
leery of opening wide its ranks
to men because of a long his
tory of oppression. This needs
to be worked out by us so that a
climate of support for change
is established. We should sim
ply recognize the need and -
right of women to organize
among themselves — perhaps
even learn from them.
Ingrained habits
To create a climate of sup
port for change sounds lauda
ble enough, but it is not some
thing easily accomplished. The
spectre of homophobia relin
quishes its old haunts reluc
tantly and even once it is over

come and we can feel comfort
able being more intimate (even
to write that is difficult) with
each other, there are the
nitty-gritty details to deal with
— those seemingly trivial,
commonly accepted practices
that are so ingrained.
And always we should keep
in mind the often inferior
status of women in our society,
never turning so inward as to
ignore our oppression of wo
men. Still, the effort is worth
while.
If we men could just allow
one another the freedom to
love and be loved all our emo
tion wouldn't have to be con
stantly damned up inside with
the only outlet our penises and
the only suitable receptacle
women's bodies.
