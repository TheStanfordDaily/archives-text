# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Scott Zarrow ETS must be scrutinized 
### 
A New York law taking effect in January will
shed some long needed light on the Educational
Testing Service, an organization described by
The New Republic's Barbara Demick as Ameri
ca's "most powerfulunregulated monopoly."
Truth-in-Testing legislation signed over the
summer by New York Gov. Hugh Carey chal
lenges the assumption that the makers of all
important SATs, LSATs, MCATs and other ad
missions tests should be able to ply their trade
free from public scrutiny.
Affects millions
Since the post-World War II testing boom, ETS
has had a significant influence upon the lives of
millions. Going to college and grad school, the
name of the game in America, generally means
taking an ETS test.
This means paying their fees, supplying them
with whatever information they want and receiv
ing a score without any idea how it was com
puted— not knowing which questions counted,
what the correct answers were or whether the
score was even added up properly.
To add to this collection of unknowns (and to
increase your paranoia if an aptitude test looms
near) exam-takers can't tell if their scores are
accurately reported to the institutions to which
they are applying. ETS is exempt from the
Buckley Amendment that allows students to in
spect information filed about them by an
academic institution.
This has led to several major ETS foul-ups that
could not be discovered by the affected stu
dents: in 1976, LSAT score reports sent to law
schools incorrectly identified an undisclosed
number of applicants as "unacknowledged re
peaters" of the test — individuals registered
for the exam without admitting that they previ
ously had taken the test. Some admissions
committees took this label as an indication of
moral impropriety and judged accordingly.
Although ETS finally told admissions officers
to disregard the whole matter of unacknow
ledged repeaters, the testing service did not
notify those who were incorrectly identified as
such and possibly rejected from law schools as a
result.
ETS and the American College Testing Service
(which administers the ACTs and MCATs) af
fect not only individuals but also the very
character of American society, which greatly
depends upon standardized tests for admission

into its upper echelon.
We should not rely upon the testing service}
to adequately study such problems as racial anc
economic test bias or the possibility that expen
sive test coaching might affect scores: these
questions are too significant and the test
makers have too much of a vested interest in
defending their exams.
For example, ETS has denounced the effec-
test prep Courses yet a recent Federal
Trade Commission study failed to disprove
score-raising claims made by Stanley Kaplan for
his SAT course. ETS simply should not have the
last word on important test-related problems.
Outside examination
The New York Truth-in-Testing law, which
was vigorously opposed by the testing services
and university administrators but supported by
the PTA, NAACP and groups of students,
educators and consumers, opens up the ETS for
outside examination. Testing organizations are
required to disclose research on test validity and
the correlation of- results with test-taker
background. Students will learn what the tests
actually measure and how to interpret scores.
The most controversial section of the law re
quires that copies of admission tests and their
correct answers be publicly released 30 days
after the exam results are available. Some law
makers are having second thoughts about this
provision, noting difficulties which arise in
equating different groups of test-takers when
no repeat questions can be used.
Even if the test disclosure requirement needs
some moderation, the other provisions of the
law have long been necessary.
Testing regulation
Other legislatures are beginning to consider
regulating the testers. A bill in the U.S. House of
Representatives would implement parts of the
New York law throughout the country and
would require ETS disclosure of contractual re
lationships with test sponsors. ETS and the col
leges are mounting an attack on these laws;
their claims should be examined with a critical
eye. Testing in America is big business for ETS,
an $80 million a year business. Like any other, it
should be regulated to prevent the abuses that
come with uncontrolled power.
