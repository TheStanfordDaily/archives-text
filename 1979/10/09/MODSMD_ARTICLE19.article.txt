Secrecy myth
ll the necessity of using an
A-bomb to make an H-bomb is
a secret as Charles Hoard's let
ter to the editor (Daily, Oct. 4)
suggests, it has certainly been
the worst-kept secret of the
century.
If you need a nuclear power
plant to make an A-bomb, then
you are not nearly so clever as
the United States, England, Fr
ance, the Soviet Union and
China, all of whom made their
A-bombs without, or indepen
dently of, nuclear power
plants.
It there are high-placed offi
cials who both testified that the
Progressive article would
speed nuclear proliferation
and whose approval is needed
for "profitable" export of a
nuclear power plant as Hoard's
letter states, I would certainly
like to know their names.
If Charles Hansen actually
said that all information about
"nuclear energy" is born clas
sified (Daily, Oct. 4), then he
should be told that since 1955
the only aspects of "nuclear
energy'' that are classified are
those with direct bearing on
nuclear weapons design or
production.
Nothing related to nuclear
power generation is classified,
with the possible exceptions of
some aspects of enrichment
and laser fusion techniques,
which have weapons applica
tions completely independent
of their use for peaceful pur
poses such as nuclear power
generation. I do agree wih
Hansen that even this material
should be mostly, if not all, un
classified.

Defending punk
As an Englishman newly ar
rived at Stanford from London,
I was disgusted to read your
article entitled "Punk Rockers

Harass Neighbours." (Daily
Oct. 1).
In the column it was
suggested that punk rock is a
movement of fascist delin
quents whose sole aim is to
torment honest people. How
ever, the swastika is not the
adopted symbol of punk roc
kers, nor is violence their
creed.
I can't deny that the lyrics of
punk songs are often distaste
ful and sometimes violent, yet
they express the feelings of
thousands of kids all over the
world, and they have the right
to voice them.
In England punk rock re
volutionized the music world
by breaking the monopoly of
the giant record companies
who could see no profit in it.
Almost overnight hundreds of
small independent labels
sprang up, and if a band still
couldn't get signed up, they
just formed their own com
pany. Record distribution took
place via a network of volun
teers and sympathetic record
stores.
For the first time, a poor
minority was able to hear its
own music on vinyl. Who cares
if most of the bands lacked a
great deal of talent, they all had
a freshness and enthusiasm
which commercial production
destroys. Anyone who has ever
been to a punk gig will know
how energetic and exciting
they are.
Few of the major pop'
newspapers took punk seri
ously, so the rockers printed
their own magazines called
'fanzines' which they sold in
the streets. They even inter
viewed the new "back-room"
stars. Perhaps now it is clear
how misunderstood punk is
over here — this mixture of
vandalism, violence and anti
semitism. Punk rockers have
no politics, they are just bored

kids trying to en|oy their own
music, and let's try and keep it
that way.

I strongly disagree with
Vance Mason's letter (Daily,
Oct. 3), regarding Stanford's
housing system.
First, he refers to the "fruit
basket turnover" of residences
every year, which "dumps total
strangers into the same dorm."
This is ridiculous:
What is the point of attend
ing a university with such di
versity as this one if one wishes
to spend four years with the
same 50 or so people. Besides,
the priority system of many
houses allows students a fairly
good chance of returning to
residences — if they really wish
to do so.
Mason also refers to the 25
percent of the student body
doomed to the "boonies of
Palo Alto." Assuming that
Mason derives this percentage
from the fact that each student
here has only three of his four
years guaranteed for housing,
he overlooks several facts.
First, many people go over
seas their unguaranteed year.
Second, a number of students
are admitted to on-campus
housing during their un
guaranteed year. Also, some
people choose to live off cam
pus.
As for the "Las Vegas
inspired" draw system here,
for which Mason offers no al
ternatives — but which he
nevertheless criticizes...it is an
impartial system which func
tions effectively.
It does not discriminate, and
a bad draw number does not
"doom" a student for more
than three quarters. If the situ
ation is just unbearable, the

waiting list is always an alterna
tive. In any case, there is always
next year's draw to look for
ward to!

Tragic fear of men
I was very disturbed to read
Ann Sherman's letter (Daily,
Sept. 24). It is tragic that an ac
tivity so important to her —
running in the hills — has be
come less a pleasant experi
ence and more a fearful one.
In her letter she mentions
"trees which take on male

forms" and alludes to the phal
lic significance of Hoover To
wer. She siys she turns back if
she see l - Mien running there. It
seems to me that Sherman's
real tragedy is her fear of men. I
don't imagine for a moment
that her fear of being raped re
sults from her fear of men. It
appears to be quite the other
way around. As a man it pains
me to think that the sex is so
tearfully regarded because of
the dreadful deeds of a few
specimens.

Defending punk
As an Englishman newly ar
rived at Stanford from London,
I was disgusted to read your
article entitled "Punk Rockers

Harass Neighbours." (Daily
Oct. 1).
In the column it was
suggested that punk rock is a
movement of fascist delin
quents whose sole aim is to
torment honest people. How
ever, the swastika is not the
adopted symbol of punk roc
kers, nor is violence their
creed.
I can't deny that the lyrics of
punk songs are often distaste
ful and sometimes violent, yet
they express the feelings of
thousands of kids all over the
world, and they have the right
to voice them.
In England punk rock re
volutionized the music world
by breaking the monopoly of
the giant record companies
who could see no profit in it.
Almost overnight hundreds of
small independent labels
sprang up, and if a band still
couldn't get signed up, they
just formed their own com
pany. Record distribution took
place via a network of volun
teers and sympathetic record
stores.
For the first time, a poor
minority was able to hear its
own music on vinyl. Who cares
if most of the bands lacked a
great deal of talent, they all had
a freshness and enthusiasm
which commercial production
destroys. Anyone who has ever
been to a punk gig will know
how energetic and exciting
they are.
Few of the major pop'
newspapers took punk seri
ously, so the rockers printed
their own magazines called
'fanzines' which they sold in
the streets. They even inter
viewed the new "back-room"
stars. Perhaps now it is clear
how misunderstood punk is
over here — this mixture of
vandalism, violence and anti
semitism. Punk rockers have
no politics, they are just bored

kids trying to en|oy their own
music, and let's try and keep it
that way.

Fair housing
I strongly disagree with
Vance Mason's letter (Daily,
Oct. 3), regarding Stanford's
housing system.
First, he refers to the "fruit
basket turnover" of residences
every year, which "dumps total
strangers into the same dorm."
This is ridiculous:
What is the point of attend
ing a university with such di
versity as this one if one wishes
to spend four years with the
same 50 or so people. Besides,
the priority system of many
houses allows students a fairly
good chance of returning to
residences — if they really wish
to do so.
Mason also refers to the 25
percent of the student body
doomed to the "boonies of
Palo Alto." Assuming that
Mason derives this percentage
from the fact that each student
here has only three of his four
years guaranteed for housing,
he overlooks several facts.
First, many people go over
seas their unguaranteed year.
Second, a number of students
are admitted to on-campus
housing during their un
guaranteed year. Also, some
people choose to live off cam
pus.
As for the "Las Vegas
inspired" draw system here,
for which Mason offers no al
ternatives — but which he
nevertheless criticizes...it is an
impartial system which func
tions effectively.
It does not discriminate, and
a bad draw number does not
"doom" a student for more
than three quarters. If the situ
ation is just unbearable, the

waiting list is always an alterna
tive. In any case, there is always
next year's draw to look for
ward to!

Tragic fear of men
I was very disturbed to read
Ann Sherman's letter (Daily,
Sept. 24). It is tragic that an ac
tivity so important to her —
running in the hills — has be
come less a pleasant experi
ence and more a fearful one.
In her letter she mentions
"trees which take on male

forms" and alludes to the phal
lic significance of Hoover To
wer. She siys she turns back if
she see l - Mien running there. It
seems to me that Sherman's
real tragedy is her fear of men. I
don't imagine for a moment
that her fear of being raped re
sults from her fear of men. It
appears to be quite the other
way around. As a man it pains
me to think that the sex is so
tearfully regarded because of
the dreadful deeds of a few
specimens.

Secrecy myth
ll the necessity of using an
A-bomb to make an H-bomb is
a secret as Charles Hoard's let
ter to the editor (Daily, Oct. 4)
suggests, it has certainly been
the worst-kept secret of the
century.
If you need a nuclear power
plant to make an A-bomb, then
you are not nearly so clever as
the United States, England, Fr
ance, the Soviet Union and
China, all of whom made their
A-bombs without, or indepen
dently of, nuclear power
plants.
It there are high-placed offi
cials who both testified that the
Progressive article would
speed nuclear proliferation
and whose approval is needed
for "profitable" export of a
nuclear power plant as Hoard's
letter states, I would certainly
like to know their names.
If Charles Hansen actually
said that all information about
"nuclear energy" is born clas
sified (Daily, Oct. 4), then he
should be told that since 1955
the only aspects of "nuclear
energy'' that are classified are
those with direct bearing on
nuclear weapons design or
production.
Nothing related to nuclear
power generation is classified,
with the possible exceptions of
some aspects of enrichment
and laser fusion techniques,
which have weapons applica
tions completely independent
of their use for peaceful pur
poses such as nuclear power
generation. I do agree wih
