## 558 luxury beats prefab blues

If you are not Billy |oel
("wherever you go, that's my
home"), home, with visions of
brick-worn fireplaces, carpet
shorn, window-clad, food
stuffed commodious rooms,
may often be a misnomer for a
house, an apartment, a dorm,
or in Stanford's case — a
trailer.
In spite of grievances on the
part of past, present and po

tential trailer fixtures (which
necessarily includes the resi
dent students as there are few
other fixtures to be seen in the
tin box bales) those lucky four
hundred or so continue to pay
to send their "friend" to 558.
Of course I am not advocat
ing equal housing — that
would be communist and I
have not even been to Cuba —
nor am I advocating to each ac

cording to his desires and from
each according to his-accom
modation — the implications
of this are -obvious. I merely
wish to describe some of the
wonders of Stanford housihg.

enue. Even the name evokes a
sense of sophistication suita
ble for a glamorous detective
show in which )oe Mannix.or
perhaps even a young Efrem
Zimbalist might be seen cruis
ing along in front with his
Dodge or Lincoln. Little won
der that a former Manzanita
dweller might feel, upon enter
ing his or her new 558 home,
the same surge of self-satisfied
content and delight that a
former dock worker might feel
as he settles almost delicately
into a newly leathered up
holstered executive chair, with
his own initials on a nameplate
posed in front of him.
Perhaps an aspiring Maynard
Ferguson may be seated in the
living room tinkling the ivories
in a way germane only to the
svelte 558 decor. (Do they re
ally pay those pianists out of
the ASSU fund?!)
Meanwhile, in Manzanita, a
Trans Am or two vrooms the
strip, and scantily-clad fris
beers very ultimately man
euver the disc above a closely
cropped weed colony. The
odors of a myriad of suppers in
preparation wafts from one
trailer to the next, tantalizing
those unfortunate unskilled
chefs into a metabolic frenzy

that has them downing peanut
butter inlaid saltines by the
baker's dozen.
Those to whom sugar is
anathema coddle viscous
looking masses, suitable —
one hopes — for consumption,
while the "other" roommate
smothers ad nauseum looks of
unaccustomed horror.
Now I certainly don't want to
appear biased in my assess
ment of these two contrasting
habitats. Both certainly have
advantages.
While the smooth, white
walls of 558 may reverberate si
lence off the wood paneled
fireplaces, trees falling in un
peopled forests, and trailer 34
T's punk rock resounding
throughout every trailer, make
il impossible for one to feel
alone and isolated. Moreover,
the companies of ants stepping
double-time across the day
old pea green bed posts keep
even the loneliest of lonely
hearts in close contact with
other living creatures.
So obviously housing at
Stanford is diverse. It is un
ique. It is interesting. How
ever, Manzanita Park residents
must be resting happily in their
ant-strewn tin dream box
knowing that, somewhere,
someplace, there are people
resting happily in 558. And 558
residents rest happily, know
ing they rest in 558.

advantages.
While the smooth, white
walls of 558 may reverberate si
lence off the wood paneled
fireplaces, trees falling in un
peopled forests, and trailer 34
T's punk rock resounding
throughout every trailer, make
il impossible for one to feel
alone and isolated. Moreover,
the companies of ants stepping
double-time across the day
old pea green bed posts keep
even the loneliest of lonely
hearts in close contact with
other living creatures.
So obviously housing at
Stanford is diverse. It is un
ique. It is interesting. How
ever, Manzanita Park residents
must be resting happily in their
ant-strewn tin dream box
knowing that, somewhere,
someplace, there are people
resting happily in 558. And 558
residents rest happily, know
ing they rest in 558.
