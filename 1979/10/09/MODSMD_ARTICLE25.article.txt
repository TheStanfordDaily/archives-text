Washington (AP) — The Cen
sus Bureau has decided that it
just doesn't need to know how
many left-handed American
pet-owners snore.
When the Bureau takes its
20th national head count next
April, the statisticians will be
striving to learn not just how
many of you are out there, but
what you're like and how you
live.
There are some things, how
ever, that won't be asked.
Special-interest groups rang
ing from the poor to the hand
icapped to American Indians
each have a need for special
information and a desire to get
it in convenient form.
Constant pressure
This means that in the de
cade it has spent preparing for
the 1980 census, the bureau
was underconstant pressure to
ask this or that question, get
such and such a piece of in
formation.
And the answers are of more
than academic interest: mill
ions of dollars in federal and

other money for groups and
municipalities depend on the
count.
The Constitution requires a
head count of the people,'the
added questions are a look at
the characteristics of the popu
lation, explained bureau
spokesman Henry Smith.
Many meetings
But, he added, "The ques
tions have to have some rela
tionship with an identifiable
national interest. We don't ask
your religion, or who you sleep
with or whether you have a
pet."
More than 70 meetings were
held across the country to sol
icit views on what 1980's ques
tionnaire should ask, and these
meetings, starting in 1974, led
to several changes in the
forms.
Ray Bancroft of the bureau
reported that among the ques
tions urged at these sessions,
but rejected, included whether
a person is left-handed,
whether you snore, whether
you own pets or a horse, what

type of leisure activities you
engage in and your sexual pre
ference.
Confidential responses
Still, in each census year
there are complaints that some
questions are too personal.
Bureau officials emphasize,
however, that they are asked
for statistical reasons and indi
vidual responses are kept
completely confidential.
The 1980 census will ask 19
questions of every American,
seven population questions
and a dozen about housing.
Bureau experts say it should
take about 15 minutes to fill out
the form.
One American in six — more
in rural areas — will get a
longer form that should take
about 45 minutes to complete.
It has an extra 20 housing and
26 personal questions.
The first question on all
forms is simply the name of
each person living in the
household as of April 1, 1980.
