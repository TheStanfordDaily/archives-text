# Long gas lines may form again

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Another
nationwide gasoline shortage
is possible this month, accord
ing to the respected industry
analyst who accurately pre
dicted "The days of line and
hoses" last spring.
Dan Lundberg, publisher of
the Lundberg Letter, said in a
telephone interview over the
weekend that October gas
supplies could fall as much as 5
percent below demand.
His prediction last March of
an 8.9 percent gap between
supply and demand for that
month was exactly right, the
Department of Energy later
said, and ushered in last
spring's gas crisis.
Lundberg added, however,
that a new shortage could ex
tend well into the winter and
cause worse hardships this
time around. "I'd hate like hell
to be in line, pushing my car
through the frozen slough,

with the engine and therefore
the heater turned off," he said.
The petroleum marketing
expert said the Energy De
partment has been pushing oil
companies "to increase
stockpiles of diesel fuel and
home heating oil for this
winter. As a result, he said, av
ailable gasoline supplies have
fallen while demand is rising.
"The present delivery
schedules raise the possibility
of long lines and station clos
ings again," said Lundberg,
who urged federal energy offi
cials to warn motorists of the
impending shortage.
"Last time they didn't say
anything. They left the whole
nation to be caught entirely by
surprise," he said. "This time,
the department should speak
up with the strongest possible
message to the whole country
to curb unnecessary driving.
Otherwise, we may find ourse
lves waiting in the snow."
