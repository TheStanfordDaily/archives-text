# 'Coming Home' scene
## Man locks chair to flagpole 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” A
wheelchair-bound national
guardsman, dissatisfied with
his medical treatment for
cancer, padlocked himself to a
flagpole at the courthouse last
week to get the attention of
Gov. Jerry Brown.
The scene was reminiscent
of the movie Coming Home, in
which a veteran wounded in
Vietnam chained himself to the
gate of a military base to pro
test against the war.
Sgt. Peter Proserpi, 30, of
South Lake Tahoe, a Vietnam
veteran on leave as a member
of the Army National Guard's
126 th Medical Company Air
Ambulance here, said only a
blowtorch could cut through
the U-shaped bar that locked
him to the flagpole.
He said he was prohibited by
law from filing a malpractice
suit for what he claimed was a
military hospital's failure to
diagnose cancer in a leg, which
later was amputated.
Proserpi said he wasn't
wounded in the one year he
served in Vietnam as a convoy
escort. He claimed the cancer

resulted from a knee injury he
suffered during National
Guard duty.
He carried a sign saying:
"Gov. Brown, where are my
human rights?"
A policeman stood nearby
but didn't interfere with Pro
serpi.
Proserpi said it was only after
bVi months'' treatment at
Mather Air Force Base hospital
east of here that he went to
Stanford University hospital
where a 4'/2-pound cancerous
tumor was removed and his
right leg was amputated.
A base spokesman said fed
eral law bans malpractice suits
against military doctors and
military hospitals.
Proserpi said the Democratic
governor has refused to talk to
him personally. He wants
Brown to sponsor legislation to
allow him to sue the hospital
and he wants compensation
for the loss of his leg.
Steve Duscha, Brown's assis
tant press secretary, said he
could find no record of any
contact'between Proserpi and

Brown's office.
Carolyn Hamilton, spokes
woman for the California Na
tional Guard, said Army attor
neys are trying to determine if
Proserpi injured himself while
on duty.
She also said the injury to
Proserpi's knee, last Oct. 7,
was not reported until April of
this year. .
Proserpi, who said he can no
longer work as a pastry chef,
said his only income is $148
every two weeks in state disa
bility benefits. He said he has
applied for federal veterans'
benefits.
