# McCloskey seeks tighter DOE classification

### Mark Nassutti 
Congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) said re
cently that he is grateful to ther
monuclear hobbyist Charles Hansen
of Mountain View for making known
discoveries on the workings of the
hydrogen bomb.
McCloskey said he is grateful be
cause Hansen pointed out some in
consistencies in the classification
procedures of the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE) which McCloskey
now intends to see rectified.
He wants to make sure that no per
son such as Hansen will ever again be
able to either obtain such informa
tion or publish it.
"Hansen was not wrong,"
McCloskey said in a Daily interview.
"He called attention to a problem."
Hansen's revelations were con
tained in a letter he wrote to Sen.
Charles Percy (R-lll.) and were
brought to national prominence
when they became the subject of a
restraining order against UC-
Berkeley's Daily Californian, which
had obtained a copy of Hansen's let
ter and had considered publishing it.
The letter was later published by
the Madison Press Connection
(Wise.).
The resolution of this issue re
quires consideration of two basic
principles, McCloskey said. The first
is restraint on the free flow of infor
mation. The second, which McClos
key deemed more crucial, is the pos
sibility of "a clear and present danger
to the security of the United States"
which could result from the publica
tion of classified material.
"The H-bomb is so dangerous that
the common citizen (seeking to ac
quire or publish relevant informa
tion) should be under restraint," he
said.
The law McCloskey would like to
develop would mandate that "any
individual working on it (the
H-bomb) must check any new con
cepts or designs with the govern
ment before he publishes that in
formation."
McCloskey defined "new" as any
thing not already in the public do
main. Current law stipulates that

such information may not be dis
seminated unless it is possible that
the information has already been re
leased, McCloskey said.
McCloskey wants to insure that
such information either is not availa
ble to anyone in the future, or that
anyone gathering similar informa
tion on his own will not be able to
publish it without first receiving ap
proval from the federal government.
In a letter to Rep. Richardson Pryor
(D-North Carolina), chairman of the
House Committee on Government
Operations, McCloskey argued that
the restricted data clauses in the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954 "expressly
exempt restricted data which has
been declassified" from being de

noted as secret.
McCloskey, a member of that
committee, said private citizens such
as Hansen and Howard Morland
had no reason to believe that the
public information they used to write
their articles was restricted data in
stead of unclassified material. Mor
land wrote an article on the H-bomb
which will appear in The Progressive
Magazine.
"It appears that the DOE, rather
than Hansen, may be to blame forthe
release of any restricted data,"
McCloskey acknowledged.
He decried the easy access to
bomb construction paved by the
publication of Hansen's letter. Any
one previously wishing to build an

H-bomb would have had to experi
ment exhaustively to discern the cor
rect technique. With Hansen's de
scription now in the public realm,
"that saves people a lot of time in
testing alternatives," McCloskey
said.
DOE officials have confirmed that
Hansen's model is the best so far
published, better than that formu
lated by Morland. Because he said
he believes that the assembly of a
crude bomb does not necessitate
abundant resources, McCloskey ex
pressed concern about the potential
impact of Hansen's diagram.
He added that a congressional
committee will begin to discuss DOE
classification next month.
