# Feminists demand ERA guarantee
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” Feminist
author Betty Friedan told the
National Organization for
Women last weekend that
political candidates will have to
provide guarantees of com
mitment to the proposed Equal
Rights Amendment to get
support from women voters.
"I will not support Teddy
Kennedy no matter what, until
I have guarantees about wo
, men's rights . . . about the
Equal Rights Amendment,"

said Friedan, one of NOW's
founders.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) has not announced his
candidacy for the Democratic
presidential nomination, al
though he's considered a
strong contender.
"We will not forgive. We will
not forget," she said of past
NOW-endorsed political can
didates who failed to keep
their promises to support ERA

ratification after they were
elected.
Friedan's remarks came in
the final day of NOW's three
day 12th annual national con
vention here.
"We were had by Carter, '
she told reporters later. "We
will have to get guarantees. We
got words of promise from Car
ter, but we didn't get muscle.
We're not going to support
anyone who doesn't deliver

the goods."
Friedan said that if President
limmy Carter were to use his
influence to get the ERA
ratified in Florida and Illinois,
the remaining unratified states
would be vying for the right to
be the final state that makes the
amendment a part of the U.S.
Constitution.
The ERA, which would out
law discrimination based on
sex, must be ratified by 38
states by )une 30, 1982. So far,
35 states have ratified it, al
though five states have voted
to rescind their ratifications.
The validity of that move still is
in question and the Justice De
partment has said it is up to
Congress to decide.
NOW has urged a boycott of
the 15 states that have not
ratified it, an action it says has
cost those states conventions
and travel business.
Friedan denied allegations

that the women's movement,
because of its stand for repio
ductive freedom for women,
was against maintaining the
family unit.
And she said there is a need
for national priorities for child
care and a recognition that the
future of the family is tied not
only to issues of abortion and
birth control but also to
economics.
NOW president Eleanor
Smeal, who was re-elected for
a second term during the con
vention, told delegates that
NOW was committed to its
pledge to get the ERA ratified
and would work against grow
ing conservative opposition to
the women's movement.
Also elected as officers were
)udy Goldsmith, vice
president-executive; )ane
Wells-Schooley, vice president
action; Sandy Roth, secretary;
and Alice Chapman, treasurer.
