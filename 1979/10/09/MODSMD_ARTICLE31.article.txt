# Epidemic destroying Bighorn
## 
### 
Santa Fe, N.M. (AP) â€” The
surviving Desert Bighorn
sheep of the San Andres
Mountains may have to be cap
tured and treated if they are to
be saved from an epidemic that
has wiped out more than
three-fourths of the majestic
herd.
Microscopic scab mites that
officials say are not supposed
to exist in the United States ap
parently are responsible for

decimating a flock the state has
spent more than $1 million on
since it decided to reintroduce
the Bighorn to New Mexico 15
years ago.
Game and Fish Department
officials say the herd peaked at
225 in the early 1970'5. Only 60
or 70 remain.
And officials say those may
die this winter unless the de
partment launches a major re
scue effort.
The scabies outbreak is the
first known epidemic of its
kind since the turn of the cen
tury. Its origin remains a mys
tery.
"We don't know what
caused it. We'll probably never
know what caused it," Game
Chief Walt Snydersaid. "All we
have to go on are historical re
cords dating back to 1890 and
1900."
The scab mites have been
identified as a species the U.S.
Department of Agriculture says
doesn't exist in the continental
United States.
In an aerial survey this
month, officials spotted only
48 ewes and seven rams in the
south-central New Mexico
herd.
"Not a single lamb sur
vived," said Snyder. "They
have a high mortality rate any
way, but this is a big worry."

Snyder said in past years, 20
or 30 lambs survived infancy
every year.
Snyder says layers of the
parasitic mite collect on the
backs of the bighorns. The in
sects attach themselves to the
animal and tap capillaries
under the skin, draining blood.
