## Haydn on the grass Fans fill Frost for philharmonic feast 
### 
On Sunday the Lively Arts at
'Stanford unveiled its 1979-80
season by presenting the San
Francisco Symphony in the
pleasant surroundings of Frost
Amphitheater. Undaunted by
cold, cloudy weather, a crowd
of several thousand picnicked
on the green grass prior to the
five o'clock performance.
The concert opened with
Bach's Brandenburg Concerto
No. 3 in G major. Although
scored for three violins, three
violas, three cellos, bass and
harpsichord, the orchestra
chose to depart from Bach's in
structions, using several stands
of instruments for each part
and omitting the harpsichord
entirely.
It didn't work. The resulting
sound was heavy and muddy,
lacking the light, delicate tex
ture the piece demands. The
peppery rhythm of the
harpsichord was sorely mis
sed, too.
A further consequence of
the strange instrumentation
was that the orchestra, pre
sumably for reasons of ensem
ble, was forced to play the
sixteenth-note passages with
metronomic rigidity. This rob
bed the passages of the won

derful nuances and slight
rubatos that single soloists
generally use to add expres
siveness to performances.
Yet even through all these
problems, there was no deny
ing Bach's genius. The music
still came across pleasantly and
energetically.
Credit goes to Conductor
Alexander Schneider for crisp
yet not excessive tempos.
Next on the program was
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in
A major ( k.622), featuring sol
oist Richard Stoltzman. His de
lightful performance was high
lighted by his rendition of the
second movement, a wonder
ful adagio. Throughout the
movement Stoltzman
made full use of his incredible
dynamic range to bring out ex
pressive lines in the music.
The outer movements, an al
legro and a rondo, offer the
soloist ample opportunity to
show off his virtuosity, and
Stoltzman took full advantage
of these as well. Particularly
impressive was Stoltzman's
sense of pacing, which was
most effective in accenting the
humor which runs through the
rondo.

Indeed, by the end of his
performance Mr. Stoltzman
had the audience charmed out
of its socks. The only objection
to the performance was the
sound system, made necessary
by Frost's outdoor expanse.
Though much improved from
last year's noise box, the sound
system still stole the different
tone colorings Stoltzman is
known for and played havoc
with the orchestra's balance.
One wished dearly for an
opportunity to hear the soloist
inside under better acoustical
surroundings. Just such an op
portunity will exist later this
month when Stoltzman
will be joined by pianist Bill
Douglas for a concert in Din
kelspiel Auditorium on Oc
tober 23.
After intermission the con
cert resumed with a quick and
spirited rendition of Mozart's
Symphony No. 14 in A major
(k.114). Again the sound sys
tem messed up the orchestra's
balance, this time bringing the
French horns right into the au
dience's laps.
The symphony, which was
written when Mozart was only
16, is a pleasant piece of music,
that shows just how talented a

youngster Mozart was. Yet it
still does not touch the mas
terpieces Mozart wrote later in
his life.
The program closed with
Hadyn's Symphony No. 94 inC
major, better known as the
Surprise Symphony. Discus
sion of this piece usually cen
ters around the fortissimo G
major chord found in the sec
ond movement, and Sunday's
concert offered no chance to
take exception.
The chord, which was sup
posedly put there by Haydn to
wake up sleepy London audi
ences, did its job again, startl
ing a young concertgoer into
screaming in the middle of the
performance — almost exactly

in time with the music. The
musicians provided plenty of
humor to this ribald music in
their own way.
Special praise goes to the
first oboe player, Marc
Lifschey, whose sharp staccato
handling of the main melody
was particularly funny.
The remaining movements
were also done nicely, with the
exceptions of portions of the
last movement which were
marred by poor ensemble. The
ragged playing was most
noticeable in fast, technical
passages which the violins
seemed to have trouble
negotiating. The age-old prob
lem of coordinating winds and
stringsalso reared its ugly head
once or twice.
Vet by the end, the orchestra
pulled together for one last
charming musical joke before
the final cadence.

with the orchestra's balance.
One wished dearly for an
opportunity to hear the soloist
inside under better acoustical
surroundings. Just such an op
portunity will exist later this
month when Stoltzman
will be joined by pianist Bill
Douglas for a concert in Din
kelspiel Auditorium on Oc
tober 23.
After intermission the con
cert resumed with a quick and
spirited rendition of Mozart's
Symphony No. 14 in A major
(k.114). Again the sound sys
tem messed up the orchestra's
balance, this time bringing the
French horns right into the au
dience's laps.
The symphony, which was
written when Mozart was only
16, is a pleasant piece of music,
that shows just how talented a

youngster Mozart was. Yet it
still does not touch the mas
terpieces Mozart wrote later in
his life.
The program closed with
Hadyn's Symphony No. 94 inC
major, better known as the
Surprise Symphony. Discus
sion of this piece usually cen
ters around the fortissimo G
major chord found in the sec
ond movement, and Sunday's
concert offered no chance to
take exception.
The chord, which was sup
posedly put there by Haydn to
wake up sleepy London audi
ences, did its job again, startl
ing a young concertgoer into
screaming in the middle of the
performance — almost exactly

in time with the music. The
musicians provided plenty of
humor to this ribald music in
their own way.
Special praise goes to the
first oboe player, Marc
Lifschey, whose sharp staccato
handling of the main melody
was particularly funny.
The remaining movements
were also done nicely, with the
exceptions of portions of the
last movement which were
marred by poor ensemble. The
ragged playing was most
noticeable in fast, technical
passages which the violins
seemed to have trouble
negotiating. The age-old prob
lem of coordinating winds and
stringsalso reared its ugly head
once or twice.
Vet by the end, the orchestra
pulled together for one last
charming musical joke before
the final cadence.

Several thousand gathered in Frost on Sunday to listen to the San Francisco Symphony play selections
from the music of Bach, Mozart and FHaydn.

On Sunday the Lively Arts at
'Stanford unveiled its 1979-80
season by presenting the San
Francisco Symphony in the
pleasant surroundings of Frost
Amphitheater. Undaunted by
cold, cloudy weather, a crowd
of several thousand picnicked
on the green grass prior to the
five o'clock performance.
The concert opened with
Bach's Brandenburg Concerto
No. 3 in G major. Although
scored for three violins, three
violas, three cellos, bass and
harpsichord, the orchestra
chose to depart from Bach's in
structions, using several stands
of instruments for each part
and omitting the harpsichord
entirely.
It didn't work. The resulting
sound was heavy and muddy,
lacking the light, delicate tex
ture the piece demands. The
peppery rhythm of the
harpsichord was sorely mis
sed, too.
A further consequence of
the strange instrumentation
was that the orchestra, pre
sumably for reasons of ensem
ble, was forced to play the
sixteenth-note passages with
metronomic rigidity. This rob
bed the passages of the won

derful nuances and slight
rubatos that single soloists
generally use to add expres
siveness to performances.
Yet even through all these
problems, there was no deny
ing Bach's genius. The music
still came across pleasantly and
energetically.
Credit goes to Conductor
Alexander Schneider for crisp
yet not excessive tempos.
Next on the program was
Mozart's Clarinet Concerto in
A major ( k.622), featuring sol
oist Richard Stoltzman. His de
lightful performance was high
lighted by his rendition of the
second movement, a wonder
ful adagio. Throughout the
movement Stoltzman
made full use of his incredible
dynamic range to bring out ex
pressive lines in the music.
The outer movements, an al
legro and a rondo, offer the
soloist ample opportunity to
show off his virtuosity, and
Stoltzman took full advantage
of these as well. Particularly
impressive was Stoltzman's
sense of pacing, which was
most effective in accenting the
humor which runs through the
rondo.

Indeed, by the end of his
performance Mr. Stoltzman
had the audience charmed out
of its socks. The only objection
to the performance was the
sound system, made necessary
by Frost's outdoor expanse.
Though much improved from
last year's noise box, the sound
system still stole the different
tone colorings Stoltzman is
known for and played havoc
with the orchestra's balance.
