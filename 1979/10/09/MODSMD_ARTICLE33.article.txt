# It ain't easy being green

### 
There's a movie out that
will marsh right out to you
and swamp you with emo
tion. Its message will toad
you over, instill you with
hope and leave a frog in
your throat. I'm writing, of
course, of the riveting
Muppet Movie.
Kermit's performance is
brilliant. He takes what
could be a mundane "Frog
dreams of stardom'' plot
and carries it to greener pas
tures.
Viewers, we have before
us the star of the 80s: an en
tertainer to whose am
phibious character we can
all relate so well. Kermit's
longing to differentiate
himself from all the other
cute little frogs in the
swamp without losing his
essential frogness causes
him un-toad worry.
Hero that he is, Kermit
pond-ers his existence with
style and humor. En route to
frog auditions in Hol
lywood, the bicycling am
phibian narrowly misses a

truck and that big lily-pad in
the sky.
Kermit shrugs off the
near-fatal collision with, "If
frogs couldn't hop, I'd be
Gone with the Schwinn."
Whoever said that Hol
lywood or Washington was
the seat of corruption ? Right
in the back yard of his own
swamp, Kermit is intro
duced to baseness.
Spotting the talented
frog, a local, fiendish fast
food "frog legs" entrep
reneur, the film's wicked
witch of the west, is deter
mined to use Kermie as his
advertising pitch. With his
star-struck Muppet friends,
Kermie is chased across
America by the villain's en
tourage.
Kermie takes time out
from the chase to attend the

Bogen County Fair, where
he falls in love with Miss
Bogen County herself, the
illustrious and glamorous
Miss Piggy. It's love at first
sight.
Piggy too falls head over
hooves with Kermie. But her
failure to communicate her
career priorities is ham
handed at best.
The two entertainers are
finally brought together, lit
erally, when the evildoer
kidnaps and hog-ties them.
Kermit is about to receive an
electric lobotomy from the
dastardly Herr Doctor Mel
Brooks when Piggy breaks
loose and does a karate
number that would make
Bruce Lee swoon (or swine).
It's not Kermie's style to
hop away from adversity.
He arranges a showdown

with his evil pursuer in an
old mining town.
Donning cowboy boots
and spurs, our tearless frog
tells the slimy frog assassin
to either stop the pursuit or
kill him.
Will the Muppets reach
Hollywood?
Will Kermie realize his
dreams to make millions of
people happy?
Will he have the chance to
respect Miss Piggy's ambi
tion?
Besides an exceptional
cast of Muppets (Rolph the
Dog finally blossoms here
as a bar-room pianist),
cameos by Steve Martin,
Mel Brooks and Edgar
Bergen and Charlie McCar
thy enrich this modern-day
Wizard of Oz. If I'm a tad
pole-egetic in this review,
it's only due to the film's
length.
Sure, it's true that the
usher and I were the only
persons in the theater over
12 and that there's no nudity
in the film. (Kermie never
takes off his collar.) Yet,
there are scenes in the
Muppet Movie which make
it a must-see.
Frog-et your troubles,
come on, get hoppy.

He arranges a showdown

with his evil pursuer in an
old mining town.
Donning cowboy boots
and spurs, our tearless frog
tells the slimy frog assassin
to either stop the pursuit or
kill him.
Will the Muppets reach
Hollywood?
Will Kermie realize his
dreams to make millions of
people happy?
Will he have the chance to
respect Miss Piggy's ambi
tion?
Besides an exceptional
cast of Muppets (Rolph the
Dog finally blossoms here
as a bar-room pianist),
cameos by Steve Martin,
Mel Brooks and Edgar
Bergen and Charlie McCar
thy enrich this modern-day
Wizard of Oz. If I'm a tad
pole-egetic in this review,
it's only due to the film's
length.
Sure, it's true that the
usher and I were the only
persons in the theater over
12 and that there's no nudity
in the film. (Kermie never
takes off his collar.) Yet,
there are scenes in the
Muppet Movie which make
it a must-see.
Frog-et your troubles,
come on, get hoppy.
