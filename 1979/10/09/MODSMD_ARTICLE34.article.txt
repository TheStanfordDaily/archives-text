# 'Seduction' polls slightly ahead of Jimmy C.
## 
### 
No matter who eventually
wins the right to contest the
presidency with Ronald
Reagan next year, one thing is
certain — very few people will
care, and of those who do, few
will care very much. Outside of
the Kennedy cult, politics
counts for very little in Ameri
can life and letters; and even
the Kennedys are worshipped
for what they have, rather than
what they stand for.
But wait, you say. If such is
the case, why do Terrible Ted
and )ealous Jimmy eat up so
many acres of wood pulp? Why
is New Hampshire (The "Leap
State" — it only appears once
every four years) so fleetingly
significant? How can Allen
Drury, of all people, sell mill
ions of books?
There is something in the
political process that appeals
to us. But it has nothing to do
with ideology; nine out of ten
Americans haven't the foggiest
notion of what all those famous
names support and believe in,
much less what they would do
once elected (including myself
— I'm not criticizing political
ignorance, after all).
The secret lies in the fact that

we follow politics. In Europe,
or South America, where gov
ernment can still be a well
defined ideology welded on to
real life, a person's political
views (inherited or otherwise)
may to some degree determine
his income, his station, his so
cial sphere.
In America, where govern
ment was born out of landow
ners' greed and maintained by
vague middle-class fears, poli
tics is followed like a game.
People tune in election night to
catch the score, to see if Nixon
will shut McCovern out or if
Ford will make a late rally on
the West Coast.
What became of the election
news when the pope flew over
and provided better drama?
Which brings us, finally, to
the problem with The Seduc
tion of loe Tynan. No one
doubts that writer/star Alan
Alda had good intentions —
he's such a nice man, after all
— but Seduction turned out to
be anything but a political film.
And while it may have some
thing to say about the horrors
of the political life for those
who choose to live it, it studi
ously avoids commenting on

anything larger, such as the
horrible things done to us by
those who make the choice.
The Seduction of joe Tynan
is a classic example of the
"good entertainment"; and
while it is very good as such, it
is nothing more. Rex Reed,
striving to maintain the un
iform inanity of his critical ca
non, called it "As contempor
ary as today's headlines." In
fact, Alda and director Jerry
Schatzberg (don't feel bad, I'd
never heard of him either) have
attempted to date the film as
much as possible.
The plot turns on a device
borrowed from "Advise and
Consent," a controversial
nomination which our hero
opposes, reluctantly at first but
with growing vigor (pro
nounced "vig-ah"). And the
only issue at stake — segrega
tion — died ten years ago, leav
ing busing behind to haunt
us.
Busing is never mentioned
in the film, of course; a school
bus would be out of place
among all these long black
iimqiisines.
The fact remains that The
Seduction of loe Tynan is

watchable, enjoyable, enter
taining — pick your favorite ad
jective. Director Schatzberg,
possessed of the (in these
cases) necessary lack of
cinematic skill, stays out of the
way of Alda and his story. All
the stock characters are here,
developed through years of
political potboilers — the
handsome young liberal
senator (Alda), his suffering
wife, the other woman, the
crusty old Southern tyrant who
is starting to lose his grip, and
the lecherous middle-aged in
competent (Rip Torn, in a role
more suited to him than that of
Nixon on television).
Alda solidifies his position as
intellectual America's heart
throb; pin-stripe suits and
graying hair look as good on
him as khaki greens and surgi
cal masks. Barbara Harris is
perfectly cast as his wife —
whether in bed with Alda or
having a nervous breakdown
on the campaign trail, she al
ways manages to look as if
she's suffering. And Meryl
Streep, the sexiest woman in
film today (with the possible

exception of Sissy bpacek)
does as much as can be done
with her over-written part.
The film has attracted more
attention than it deserves,
perhaps because of Tynan's re
semblance to a certain liberal
senator from Massachusetts.
But the resemblance is too ob
vious — if this is what Alda
wanted, he would have found
subtler ways of doing it. In
truth, any character conceived
as a liberal hero must be corn
paired to the Kennedys, past
and present. They, after all,
created the role.
The Seduction of Joe Tynan
is, above all else, a straightfor
ward film — entertainments
always are — and, failing (or
perhaps not intending) to say
anything about the way our
country is run for us, settles for
a statement of sorts about job
pressures in Washington and
the ethics of business.
Whether or not Tynan sells
out in the end isn't important;
what matters is that we stick
around long enough to find
out.

who choose to live it, it studi
ously avoids commenting on

anything larger, such as the
horrible things done to us by
those who make the choice.
The Seduction of joe Tynan
is a classic example of the
"good entertainment"; and
while it is very good as such, it
is nothing more. Rex Reed,
striving to maintain the un
iform inanity of his critical ca
non, called it "As contempor
ary as today's headlines." In
fact, Alda and director Jerry
Schatzberg (don't feel bad, I'd
never heard of him either) have
attempted to date the film as
much as possible.
The plot turns on a device
borrowed from "Advise and
Consent," a controversial
nomination which our hero
opposes, reluctantly at first but
with growing vigor (pro
nounced "vig-ah"). And the
only issue at stake — segrega
tion — died ten years ago, leav
ing busing behind to haunt
us.
Busing is never mentioned
in the film, of course; a school
bus would be out of place
among all these long black
iimqiisines.
The fact remains that The
Seduction of loe Tynan is

watchable, enjoyable, enter
taining — pick your favorite ad
jective. Director Schatzberg,
possessed of the (in these
cases) necessary lack of
cinematic skill, stays out of the
way of Alda and his story. All
the stock characters are here,
developed through years of
political potboilers — the
handsome young liberal
senator (Alda), his suffering
wife, the other woman, the
crusty old Southern tyrant who
is starting to lose his grip, and
the lecherous middle-aged in
competent (Rip Torn, in a role
more suited to him than that of
Nixon on television).
Alda solidifies his position as
intellectual America's heart
throb; pin-stripe suits and
graying hair look as good on
him as khaki greens and surgi
cal masks. Barbara Harris is
perfectly cast as his wife —
whether in bed with Alda or
having a nervous breakdown
on the campaign trail, she al
ways manages to look as if
she's suffering. And Meryl
Streep, the sexiest woman in
film today (with the possible

exception of Sissy bpacek)
does as much as can be done
with her over-written part.
The film has attracted more
attention than it deserves,
perhaps because of Tynan's re
semblance to a certain liberal
senator from Massachusetts.
But the resemblance is too ob
vious — if this is what Alda
wanted, he would have found
subtler ways of doing it. In
truth, any character conceived
as a liberal hero must be corn
paired to the Kennedys, past
and present. They, after all,
created the role.
The Seduction of Joe Tynan
is, above all else, a straightfor
ward film — entertainments
always are — and, failing (or
perhaps not intending) to say
anything about the way our
country is run for us, settles for
a statement of sorts about job
pressures in Washington and
the ethics of business.
Whether or not Tynan sells
out in the end isn't important;
what matters is that we stick
around long enough to find
out.

A day on the town
Senator Tynan discusses his next move with New Orleans labor attorney Karen Traynor (Meryl
Streep) in his Washington office.


A night at home
Senator |oe Tynan (Alan Alda) has not yet received permission
from his wife (Barbara Harris) to run for president.
No matter who eventually
wins the right to contest the
presidency with Ronald
Reagan next year, one thing is
certain — very few people will
care, and of those who do, few
will care very much. Outside of
the Kennedy cult, politics
counts for very little in Ameri
can life and letters; and even
the Kennedys are worshipped
for what they have, rather than
what they stand for.
But wait, you say. If such is
the case, why do Terrible Ted
and )ealous Jimmy eat up so
many acres of wood pulp? Why
is New Hampshire (The "Leap
State" — it only appears once
every four years) so fleetingly
significant? How can Allen
Drury, of all people, sell mill
ions of books?
There is something in the
political process that appeals
to us. But it has nothing to do
with ideology; nine out of ten
Americans haven't the foggiest
notion of what all those famous
names support and believe in,
much less what they would do
once elected (including myself
— I'm not criticizing political
ignorance, after all).
The secret lies in the fact that

we follow politics. In Europe,
or South America, where gov
ernment can still be a well
defined ideology welded on to
real life, a person's political
views (inherited or otherwise)
may to some degree determine
his income, his station, his so
cial sphere.
In America, where govern
ment was born out of landow
ners' greed and maintained by
vague middle-class fears, poli
tics is followed like a game.
People tune in election night to
catch the score, to see if Nixon
will shut McCovern out or if
Ford will make a late rally on
the West Coast.
What became of the election
news when the pope flew over
and provided better drama?
Which brings us, finally, to
the problem with The Seduc
tion of loe Tynan. No one
doubts that writer/star Alan
Alda had good intentions —
he's such a nice man, after all
— but Seduction turned out to
be anything but a political film.
And while it may have some
thing to say about the horrors
of the political life for those
who choose to live it, it studi
