# Lowe's 'Lust' has moments, misses mark
## 
### 
Labour of Lust
Nick Lowe
Columbia
At his best, Nick Lowe turns
out cohesive, light, tuneful
pop gems with such an air of
nonchalance that he seems to
be mocking the seeming
simplicity of the very medium
in which he works.
The cover and the album
sleeve of Lowe's latest effort,
Labour of Lust, intimate what
we are in store for on this
vinyl. It is classic Nick Lowe:
the plain-looking cover di
rectly out of the early to mid
60s, the fan magazine-like mug
which covers one side of the
sleeve, and the playful full
length profile of Lowe which
adorns the other side of the
sleeve. Everything looks back
to the golden, innocent years
when pop music reigned.
But something is wrong
here. The cover looks some
how cheap, even tacky. The fa
cial shot of Lowe reveals what
appears to be a chipped tooth,
certainly passe in a glamour
magazine. And the playful shot
appears almost ominous on
closer examination (the nice

man offering candy our moms
always warned us about).
Yes, Lowe must be deliver
ing the sprite pop tunes with
surprisingly incongruous lyrics
we have come to expect, just as
he has produced a sprite yet
incongruously cheap album
cover. Right?
Well, no, not quite. Lowe
manages to shine several times
on this album, but on the re
mainder seems to have lost
much of his musical inspira
tion.
The second side is mostly
undistinguished chunk rock,
though always in a 60's-esque
pop vein. The only exception is
"Without Love," a countryish
song which recalls Lowe's days
with the group Brinsley
Schwarz and which resembles
some of Linda Rondstadt's bet
ter, livelier pieces.
Even with the relatively un
distinguished melodies,
though, Lowe manages to
throw in some tongue-in-cheek
lines to salt things up. For
example, in "Born Fighter"
Lowe sings "girls like that bring
a lump to my pocket". In
"Dose of You" Lowe claims
caught a dose of you tonight; I
need a stiff shot badly." Stuff

like this keeps theiistener's in
terest even during the musical
lulls.
Lowe fares much better on
this album's first side. This half
of the disk opens with the best
60's hit of this year (with the
possible exception of Lowe
protege Dave Edmunds' "Girls
Talk"), "Cruel to be Kind," a
hook-filled piece of fluff catchy
and innocent enough to over
come AM's resistance to "new
wave" associated artists such
as Lowe.
Much less joyous sounding
is "Cracking Up." Here, Lowe
offers a look at mental distress
from the point of view of the
distressed. The delivery is
somewhat mechanical and
monotone, but certain sylla
bles are effectively accen
tuated (particularly enough),
all lending an air of believabil
ity to the observations.
Fortunately, Lowe reaffirms
his songwriting talents on
"American Squirm," the al
bum's standout track. "Ameri
can Squirm" was released last
year in England as a single, with
moderate success (backed
with "What's So Funny 'Bout
Peace Love and Understand

ing," a song which found its
way onto Elvis Costello's last
album). It would certainly be to
AM radio's credit if the song
could match or beat that level
of success here. An even more
tasty pop effort than "Cruel to
be Kind," there's no reason it
shouldn't. Incidentally, that's
Costello on backing vocals.
"You Make Me" delivers the
album's most abrupt change of
pace: a quiet ballad featuring
only Lowe on acoustic guitar.
Though fairly pleasant, the
song is so slow and seemingly
out of place on this album that
it appears almost a parody of
itself. "Skin Deep" quickly re
sumes the fast pace of the rest
of the album and closes out
side one.
It is perhapsappropriate that
this palatable but forgettable
song links the otherwise strong
first side with the weaker sec
ond side. Perhaps Lowe under
stood the weaknesses of the
album when titling it: while it is
an overall good album with
some fine moments, it leaves
the listener 'lusting' afteran ef
fort with more high points.
Perhaps Lowes' next album will
be a labour of satiation.

vinyl. It is classic Nick Lowe:
the plain-looking cover di
rectly out of the early to mid
60s, the fan magazine-like mug
which covers one side of the
sleeve, and the playful full
length profile of Lowe which
adorns the other side of the
sleeve. Everything looks back
to the golden, innocent years
when pop music reigned.
But something is wrong
here. The cover looks some
how cheap, even tacky. The fa
cial shot of Lowe reveals what
appears to be a chipped tooth,
certainly passe in a glamour
magazine. And the playful shot
appears almost ominous on
closer examination (the nice

man offering candy our moms
always warned us about).
Yes, Lowe must be deliver
ing the sprite pop tunes with
surprisingly incongruous lyrics
we have come to expect, just as
he has produced a sprite yet
incongruously cheap album
cover. Right?
Well, no, not quite. Lowe
manages to shine several times
on this album, but on the re
mainder seems to have lost
much of his musical inspira
tion.
The second side is mostly
undistinguished chunk rock,
though always in a 60's-esque
pop vein. The only exception is
"Without Love," a countryish
song which recalls Lowe's days
with the group Brinsley
Schwarz and which resembles
some of Linda Rondstadt's bet
ter, livelier pieces.
Even with the relatively un
distinguished melodies,
though, Lowe manages to
throw in some tongue-in-cheek
lines to salt things up. For
example, in "Born Fighter"
Lowe sings "girls like that bring
a lump to my pocket". In
"Dose of You" Lowe claims
caught a dose of you tonight; I
need a stiff shot badly." Stuff

like this keeps theiistener's in
terest even during the musical
lulls.
Lowe fares much better on
this album's first side. This half
of the disk opens with the best
60's hit of this year (with the
possible exception of Lowe
protege Dave Edmunds' "Girls
Talk"), "Cruel to be Kind," a
hook-filled piece of fluff catchy
and innocent enough to over
come AM's resistance to "new
wave" associated artists such
as Lowe.
Much less joyous sounding
is "Cracking Up." Here, Lowe
offers a look at mental distress
from the point of view of the
distressed. The delivery is
somewhat mechanical and
monotone, but certain sylla
bles are effectively accen
tuated (particularly enough),
all lending an air of believabil
ity to the observations.
Fortunately, Lowe reaffirms
his songwriting talents on
"American Squirm," the al
bum's standout track. "Ameri
can Squirm" was released last
year in England as a single, with
moderate success (backed
with "What's So Funny 'Bout
Peace Love and Understand

ing," a song which found its
way onto Elvis Costello's last
album). It would certainly be to
AM radio's credit if the song
could match or beat that level
of success here. An even more
tasty pop effort than "Cruel to
be Kind," there's no reason it
shouldn't. Incidentally, that's
Costello on backing vocals.
"You Make Me" delivers the
album's most abrupt change of
pace: a quiet ballad featuring
only Lowe on acoustic guitar.
Though fairly pleasant, the
song is so slow and seemingly
out of place on this album that
it appears almost a parody of
itself. "Skin Deep" quickly re
sumes the fast pace of the rest
of the album and closes out
side one.
It is perhapsappropriate that
this palatable but forgettable
song links the otherwise strong
first side with the weaker sec
ond side. Perhaps Lowe under
stood the weaknesses of the
album when titling it: while it is
an overall good album with
some fine moments, it leaves
the listener 'lusting' afteran ef
fort with more high points.
Perhaps Lowes' next album will
be a labour of satiation.

Labour of Lust
Nick Lowe
Columbia
At his best, Nick Lowe turns
out cohesive, light, tuneful
pop gems with such an air of
nonchalance that he seems to
be mocking the seeming
simplicity of the very medium
in which he works.
The cover and the album
sleeve of Lowe's latest effort,
Labour of Lust, intimate what
we are in store for on this
vinyl. It is classic Nick Lowe:
the plain-looking cover di
rectly out of the early to mid
60s, the fan magazine-like mug
which covers one side of the
sleeve, and the playful full
length profile of Lowe which
adorns the other side of the
sleeve. Everything looks back
