# NRC admits shipment violation

Portsmouth, Va. (AP) — The increasing
worry among many Americans over what
to do with the nation's dangerous nuclear
wastes has reached Virginia's Tidewater
area — which receives about 10,000
pounds of nuclear wastes each year from
foreign countries.
About 50 times a year ships put into
Portsmouth carrying 15-ton casks of lead
and steel, each containing 200 pounds of
spent nuclear fuel.
The radioactive wastes are sent to the
United States under the Atoms for Peace
program established by President Dwight
Eisenhower as a gesture of friendship.
But whatever the generous motives that
inspired the program, the deadly cargoes
have raised many questions, after years of
little concern. But it appears nothing is
being done to stop them.
Portsmouth is the major port for receiv
ing the nuclear wastes, which from here
are shipped by truck, under armed guard,
to Department of Energy disposal plants
near Aiken, S.C.
That's because Portsmouth is a modern
port with good rail and truck service, and
has a good harbor. But it is also because
virtually no other East Coast port will ac
cept the casks.
For years, the shipments went almost
unnoticed. But last month, President
Jimmy Carter called for an increase in the
amount of foreign nuclear wastes sent for
storage in this country. At the same time,
there have been outcries at several nuclear
dumps around the country about the
danger of storing radioactive wastes.
And now, people here have begun to
worry. Anti-nuclear activists, first. Then
some city officials. Then others in the
Tidewater area around the mouth of
Chesapeake Bay.
More than 1 million people live in the
area around Portsmouth. What would
happen to them if one or more of the casks
should rupture — or be sabotaged?
Although there is dispute about the
likelihood of an accident or sabotage,
there's little disagreement that the result

of such a thing would be catastrophic.
"Considering that these radioactive
waste shipments contain essentially the
same killing power as the wastes that are
given off by the explosion of a nuclear
weapon, we feel the NRC (Nuclear Reg
ulatory Commission) is using less than
sound judgment by allowing even one
more shipment through this densely
populated area," says Jim West, a
spokesman for the Tidewater-based anti
nuclear group, Truth-in-Power.
But the NRC may not have much choice,
since almost every other port capable of
handling the big cargo ships that carry the
spent fuel casks has closed its doors to the
shipments.
And it's federal law that radioactive fuel
from foreign nuclear plants the United
States has helped build must be returned
when its usefulness is over. Officials have
made no move to change the law, even
here, where the shipments help the city's
economy.
By its own admission, the NRC is violat
ing its own regulations, handed down in
July, prohibiting the shipment of highly
radioactive substances through a city with
over 100,000 population.
Portsmouth's population is more than
110,000. And there are four more cities that
large or larger nearby, plus two smaller
cities.
The nuclear waste shipments have to
come ashore somewhere, and until offi
cials can work something out with another
port, Portsmouth seems likely to keep re
ceiving them.
NRC official Robert Burnett has issued a
temporary exemption to the regulation,
allowing Transnuclear, Inc., which hand
les most shipments, to continue routing
the casks through Portsmouth to South
Carolina.
How "temporary" the exemption will
be, no one can say.
The NRC says the casks are designed to
withstand every known accident or assault
that could be made upon them.

"It is almost inconceivable that a spent
fuel container could be breached to the
point where it would create a hazard," said
Dick Smith, a health physicist at the fed
eral plant at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
Lynn Turner, at the Savannah River plant
near Aiken, agreed.
"It would be kind of like, 'What would a
dog do if he chased a car and caught it?'
The cases are extremely difficult to open,"
Turner said.
Some tests on the casks have had them
dropped from an airplane at 2000 feet,
struck by a 60-mile-an-hour train, rocked
by explosive planted beneath them.
They've survived intact.
"The cases have taken everything that's
been thrown at them," said Turner.
William Kube, Portsmouth's radiologi
cal defense officer, agreed that the
chances of the casks being breached
through accident or sabotage "Are very
minute."
But Kube still fears for the future.
"We've been lucky. The Lord's been
watching over us," he said. "The day is
bound to come."
William Reynolds of High Point, N.C.,
coordinator of the nuclear transportation
project of the American Friends Service
Committee, a Quaker Group, also says the
chances of an accident are low, but adds,
"An increase in the number of shipments
over the next few years increases the
chances for an accident. And the con
sequences of an accident are very high."
Those increasing chances are what
worry the anti-nuclear groups, who only
recently staged a small motorcade from
Portsmouth to Aiken to demonstrate their
deep-seated fears.
Truth-in-Power and other anti-nuclear
groups are circulating petitions in the area
around Portsmouth Marine Terminals,
where the casks are unloaded from the
ships.
The petition asserts the anti-nuclear
group's opposition to the shipments and
asks for enactment of a city ordinance
banning them.

Sunday night. Morgan told the audience of more than 200 of a little-known side of Maugham, his
self-consciousness and homosexuality, drawing from his research using materials only recently
made public. The exhibit will be on display at the Department of Special Collections in Green
