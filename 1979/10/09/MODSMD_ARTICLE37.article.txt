Federal plan pushes dollar up
New York — The government's plan to cut
inflation and support the dollar did what it was
meant to do yesterday, as the dollar rose and
gold prices plunged. Stock prices fell amid
fears that the plan could bring higher interest
rates.
A trader on the New York Commodity Ex
change, the nation's largest market for gold
futures contracts, said the program "doesn't
look like a long-term solution" although "it
will have a short-term effect." Prices of silver,
grain and soybean futures fell on commodity
markets in reaction to the actions by the Fed
eral Reserve.
In an unusual Saturday night news confer
ence, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
announced a 1 percent increase in the dis
count rate — the rate at which member banks
borrow money from the central bank. The dis
count rate is now at a record 12 percent.
The actions are designed to slow economic
expansion and inflation by making it more dif
ficult for banks to lend and more expensive for
people to borrow.
The moves sent the dollar up strongly in
early trading in Europe yesterday, and the
surge held through the day.
Gold prices, which tend to move in the op
posite direction as the dollar, closed at $374 a
troy ounce in London and $372.50 in Zurich.
On Friday, gold closed at $385.50 an ounce in
both cities after hittinga midday record of $444
Tuesday.
Banks will soon charge their best customers
15 percent interest, forcing many businesses
to curtail hiring, cut back production and lay
oft workers, two leading economists said yes
terday in reaction to the anti-inflation moves.
"The board's actions guarantee a reces
sion," said Otto Eckstein, head of Data Re
sources Inc., of Cambridge, Mass. "But the
truth is we need it."
TV tongue slip catches Brown
Chicago — A curious audience, an informal
atmosphere and a slip of the tongue yesterday
caused California Gov. lerry Brown to dive
deeper into political waters than the self
described "third force" in the Democratic Par
ty's presidential contest might have planned.
Brown, in Chicago on the first stop of a 12-

day, five-state "exploratory campaign" swing,
has skillfully side-stepped direct questions
about his presidential ambitions, saying only
that he will make an official announcement by
the end of the year.
However, the 41-year-old governor ap
peared to be in a candid mood yesterday morn
ing on a live telecast of the Phil Donahue
Show, and after fielding a variety of questions
— including yet another offer to announce his
candidacy formally — he got caught shuffling
his cards.
Brown was asked who, in the event he was
elected to the presidency, he might choose to
be his First Lady.
Brown launched into a defense of bachelor
hood before an audience composed largely of
women:
"I wouldn't get married for political reasons
. . . I didn't have to marry when I was elected
governor. Now, I've been re-elected and I ha
ven't had to marry. And now I'm running for
president . . ." he said, his voice trailing off in
mid-sentence amid cheers from a delighted
gathering. "At least now I'm exploring running
for president."
Asked about his views on establishing a six
year presidential term, Brown deadpanned,
"I'd be glad to take it either way."
'Bungee Jumpers' leap in SF
San Francisco — Four Englishmen and a
woman who call themselves the "Bungee
lumpers" jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge
yesterday morning, their leaps broken by thick
rubber bands that stopped them short of the
water and bounced them back toward the
bridge.
The men, one of whom suffered a bloodied
right hand, wore formal morning suits, com
plete with toppers. The woman wore a sleek
jump suit. They were arrested by the California
Highway Patrol and charged with trespassing
on bridge cables, as was a man who got tangled
in his own lines and didn't jump.
When the jumpers quit bounc ing at the end
of their elastic or bungee cords, they let them
selves down on ropes. Two "escaped" in a
private boat waiting below. Three were grab
bed by the U.S. Coast Guard, one of them
fished from the water, 220 feet below the
bridge floor.
The stunt was well planned in advance.

Photographers from a London newspaper flew
to San Francisco, they said, specifically to
photograph the leapers.
The cameramen said the group were mem
bers of an elite club and had previously
jumped off the Clifton Suspension Bridge at
Bristol, in England's West Country.
The jumpers were identified as David Kirke,
34, the leader; Janie Wilmot, 26; Peter Carew,
26; Simon Keelling and Alan Weston. Christ
opher Hiatt Baker, 25, got tangled and did not
jump.
When the jumpers reached the limit of
stretch of the bungee cords they bounced
Sack up at great velocity, one of the men hav
ing to stick out his legs to keep from crashing
into the bottom of the bridge floor, 220 feet
above the water.
Commuter plane crash kills 8
Cincinnati — A twin-engine commuter plane
lost power in one engine and crashed on
takeoff at the Greater Cincinnati Airport yes
terday, killing eight people, authorities said.
Fred Farrar, an official with the Federal Avia
tion Administration in Washington, said the
pilot and six other people died when Comair
Flight 444 crashed while taking off for Nashville
about 10:15 a.m. The eighth person died at
Booth Memorial Hospital in Florence, Ky.
Farrar said witnesses reported the Piper
Navaho's right engine cut off when the plane
was 200 feet off the ground. The craft then
stalled and flipped over, crashing upside
down.
Capt. Louise Bennett of the Salvation Army's
Booth Memorial Hospital said one victim was
dead on arrival at the hospital and a second
died during treatment.
William Thelan, FAA airport supervisor, said
"We're guessing at the moment that the right
engine failed, and the pilot was unable to keep
the aircraft airborne."
He said the aircraft crashed just off the run
way on the grounds of the airport, which is
located across the Ohio River from Cincinnati
near Florence.
Airport officials said the Piper Navaho will
carry eight or nine people.
The victims at the hospital were identified as
Thomas Oatts, 52, of Loveland, Ohio, who was
dead on arrival, and Jeff Lake, 29, of Cincinnati,
who died in the emergency room.

FAA officials said Comair is a Cincinnati
based commuter line.
Amtrak gets OK to drop trains
Topeka, Kan. — U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Byron White annulled an appeals court ruling
that ordered Amtrak to keep operating three
money-losing passenger trains temporarily,
state officials said yesterday.
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Denver had issued a preliminary injunction on
Friday ordering Amtrak to operate the trains
until a hearing on Oct. 26.
Kansas officials filed suit challenging Am-
Trak's decision to drop the three trains, in
cluding one that goes through the state.
Neil Woerman, press secretary to Attorney
General Robert Stephan, said White's order
allowing Amtrak to drop the trains took effect
at 12:30 a.m. e.d.t. yesterday.
The trains affected are the Lone Star bet
ween Chicago and Houston, the North Coast
Hiawatha linking Chicago and Seattle and the
Floridian between Miami and Chicago.
These trains, along with two others not in
volved in the suit, originally were scheduled
for elimination Oct. 1.
Stephan filed suit in U.S. District Court in
Wichita to block the elimination of service,
contending Amtrak failed to hold the required
public hearings or file environmental impact
statements before deciding to eliminate the
trains.

Federal plan pushes dollar up
New York — The government's plan to cut
inflation and support the dollar did what it was
meant to do yesterday, as the dollar rose and
gold prices plunged. Stock prices fell amid
fears that the plan could bring higher interest
rates.
A trader on the New York Commodity Ex
change, the nation's largest market for gold
futures contracts, said the program "doesn't
look like a long-term solution" although "it
will have a short-term effect." Prices of silver,
grain and soybean futures fell on commodity
markets in reaction to the actions by the Fed
eral Reserve.
In an unusual Saturday night news confer
ence, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
announced a 1 percent increase in the dis
count rate — the rate at which member banks
borrow money from the central bank. The dis
count rate is now at a record 12 percent.
The actions are designed to slow economic
expansion and inflation by making it more dif
ficult for banks to lend and more expensive for
people to borrow.
The moves sent the dollar up strongly in
early trading in Europe yesterday, and the
surge held through the day.
Gold prices, which tend to move in the op
posite direction as the dollar, closed at $374 a
troy ounce in London and $372.50 in Zurich.
On Friday, gold closed at $385.50 an ounce in
both cities after hittinga midday record of $444

TV tongue slip catches Brown
Chicago — A curious audience, an informal
atmosphere and a slip of the tongue yesterday
caused California Gov. lerry Brown to dive
deeper into political waters than the self
described "third force" in the Democratic Par
ty's presidential contest might have planned.
Brown, in Chicago on the first stop of a 12-

day, five-state "exploratory campaign" swing,
has skillfully side-stepped direct questions
about his presidential ambitions, saying only
that he will make an official announcement by
the end of the year.
However, the 41-year-old governor ap
peared to be in a candid mood yesterday morn
ing on a live telecast of the Phil Donahue
Show, and after fielding a variety of questions
— including yet another offer to announce his
candidacy formally — he got caught shuffling
his cards.
Brown was asked who, in the event he was
elected to the presidency, he might choose to
be his First Lady.
Brown launched into a defense of bachelor
hood before an audience composed largely of
women:
"I wouldn't get married for political reasons
. . . I didn't have to marry when I was elected
governor. Now, I've been re-elected and I ha
ven't had to marry. And now I'm running for
president . . ." he said, his voice trailing off in

'Bungee Jumpers' leap in SF
San Francisco — Four Englishmen and a
woman who call themselves the "Bungee
lumpers" jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge
yesterday morning, their leaps broken by thick
rubber bands that stopped them short of the
water and bounced them back toward the
bridge.
The men, one of whom suffered a bloodied
right hand, wore formal morning suits, com
plete with toppers. The woman wore a sleek
jump suit. They were arrested by the California
Highway Patrol and charged with trespassing
on bridge cables, as was a man who got tangled
in his own lines and didn't jump.
When the jumpers quit bounc ing at the end
of their elastic or bungee cords, they let them
selves down on ropes. Two "escaped" in a
private boat waiting below. Three were grab
bed by the U.S. Coast Guard, one of them
fished from the water, 220 feet below the
bridge floor.
The stunt was well planned in advance.

Photographers from a London newspaper flew
to San Francisco, they said, specifically to
photograph the leapers.
The cameramen said the group were mem
bers of an elite club and had previously
jumped off the Clifton Suspension Bridge at
Bristol, in England's West Country.
The jumpers were identified as David Kirke,
34, the leader; Janie Wilmot, 26; Peter Carew,
26; Simon Keelling and Alan Weston. Christ
opher Hiatt Baker, 25, got tangled and did not
jump.
When the jumpers reached the limit of
stretch of the bungee cords they bounced
Sack up at great velocity, one of the men hav
ing to stick out his legs to keep from crashing
into the bottom of the bridge floor, 220 feet
above the water.
Commuter plane crash kills 8
Cincinnati — A twin-engine commuter plane
lost power in one engine and crashed on
takeoff at the Greater Cincinnati Airport yes
terday, killing eight people, authorities said.
Fred Farrar, an official with the Federal Avia
tion Administration in Washington, said the
pilot and six other people died when Comair
Flight 444 crashed while taking off for Nashville
about 10:15 a.m. The eighth person died at
Booth Memorial Hospital in Florence, Ky.
Farrar said witnesses reported the Piper
Navaho's right engine cut off when the plane
was 200 feet off the ground. The craft then
stalled and flipped over, crashing upside
down.
Capt. Louise Bennett of the Salvation Army's
Booth Memorial Hospital said one victim was
dead on arrival at the hospital and a second
died during treatment.
William Thelan, FAA airport supervisor, said
"We're guessing at the moment that the right
engine failed, and the pilot was unable to keep
the aircraft airborne."
He said the aircraft crashed just off the run
way on the grounds of the airport, which is
located across the Ohio River from Cincinnati
near Florence.
Airport officials said the Piper Navaho will
carry eight or nine people.
The victims at the hospital were identified as
Thomas Oatts, 52, of Loveland, Ohio, who was
dead on arrival, and Jeff Lake, 29, of Cincinnati,
who died in the emergency room.

Commuter plane crash kills 8
Cincinnati — A twin-engine commuter plane
lost power in one engine and crashed on
takeoff at the Greater Cincinnati Airport yes
terday, killing eight people, authorities said.
Fred Farrar, an official with the Federal Avia
tion Administration in Washington, said the
pilot and six other people died when Comair
Flight 444 crashed while taking off for Nashville
about 10:15 a.m. The eighth person died at
Booth Memorial Hospital in Florence, Ky.
Farrar said witnesses reported the Piper
Navaho's right engine cut off when the plane
was 200 feet off the ground. The craft then
stalled and flipped over, crashing upside
down.
Capt. Louise Bennett of the Salvation Army's
Booth Memorial Hospital said one victim was
dead on arrival at the hospital and a second
died during treatment.
William Thelan, FAA airport supervisor, said
"We're guessing at the moment that the right
engine failed, and the pilot was unable to keep
the aircraft airborne."
He said the aircraft crashed just off the run
way on the grounds of the airport, which is
located across the Ohio River from Cincinnati
near Florence.
Airport officials said the Piper Navaho will
carry eight or nine people.
The victims at the hospital were identified as
Thomas Oatts, 52, of Loveland, Ohio, who was
dead on arrival, and Jeff Lake, 29, of Cincinnati,
who died in the emergency room.

FAA officials said Comair is a Cincinnati
based commuter line.
Amtrak gets OK to drop trains
Topeka, Kan. — U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Byron White annulled an appeals court ruling
that ordered Amtrak to keep operating three
money-losing passenger trains temporarily,
state officials said yesterday.
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Denver had issued a preliminary injunction on
Friday ordering Amtrak to operate the trains
until a hearing on Oct. 26.
Kansas officials filed suit challenging Am-
Trak's decision to drop the three trains, in
cluding one that goes through the state.
Neil Woerman, press secretary to Attorney
General Robert Stephan, said White's order
allowing Amtrak to drop the trains took effect
at 12:30 a.m. e.d.t. yesterday.
The trains affected are the Lone Star bet
ween Chicago and Houston, the North Coast
Hiawatha linking Chicago and Seattle and the
Floridian between Miami and Chicago.
These trains, along with two others not in
volved in the suit, originally were scheduled
for elimination Oct. 1.
Stephan filed suit in U.S. District Court in
Wichita to block the elimination of service,
contending Amtrak failed to hold the required
public hearings or file environmental impact
statements before deciding to eliminate the
trains.
Jones average falls to 884.13
New York — The stock market moved lower
in moderate Columbus Day trading today as a
series of anti-inflation moves by the Federal
Reserve virtually assured a continued rise in
short-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
13.48 points to 884.13.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but with
patchy low clouds nights and mornings.
Warmer days inland. Lows in the 50s. Highs in
the mid 60s near the coast to the 70s and low
80s inland. Light winds increasing to westerly
10 to 20 mph this afternoon.
Federal plan pushes dollar up
New York — The government's plan to cut
inflation and support the dollar did what it was
meant to do yesterday, as the dollar rose and
gold prices plunged. Stock prices fell amid
fears that the plan could bring higher interest
rates.
A trader on the New York Commodity Ex
change, the nation's largest market for gold
futures contracts, said the program "doesn't
look like a long-term solution" although "it
will have a short-term effect." Prices of silver,
grain and soybean futures fell on commodity
markets in reaction to the actions by the Fed
eral Reserve.
In an unusual Saturday night news confer
ence, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
announced a 1 percent increase in the dis
count rate — the rate at which member banks
borrow money from the central bank. The dis
count rate is now at a record 12 percent.
The actions are designed to slow economic
expansion and inflation by making it more dif
ficult for banks to lend and more expensive for
people to borrow.
The moves sent the dollar up strongly in
early trading in Europe yesterday, and the
surge held through the day.
Gold prices, which tend to move in the op
posite direction as the dollar, closed at $374 a
troy ounce in London and $372.50 in Zurich.
On Friday, gold closed at $385.50 an ounce in
both cities after hittinga midday record of $444
Tuesday.
Banks will soon charge their best customers
15 percent interest, forcing many businesses
to curtail hiring, cut back production and lay
oft workers, two leading economists said yes
terday in reaction to the anti-inflation moves.
"The board's actions guarantee a reces
sion," said Otto Eckstein, head of Data Re
sources Inc., of Cambridge, Mass. "But the
truth is we need it."
TV tongue slip catches Brown
Chicago — A curious audience, an informal
atmosphere and a slip of the tongue yesterday
caused California Gov. lerry Brown to dive
deeper into political waters than the self
described "third force" in the Democratic Par
ty's presidential contest might have planned.
Brown, in Chicago on the first stop of a 12-

day, five-state "exploratory campaign" swing,
has skillfully side-stepped direct questions
about his presidential ambitions, saying only
that he will make an official announcement by
the end of the year.
However, the 41-year-old governor ap
peared to be in a candid mood yesterday morn
ing on a live telecast of the Phil Donahue
Show, and after fielding a variety of questions
— including yet another offer to announce his
candidacy formally — he got caught shuffling
his cards.
Brown was asked who, in the event he was
elected to the presidency, he might choose to
be his First Lady.
Brown launched into a defense of bachelor
hood before an audience composed largely of
women:
"I wouldn't get married for political reasons
. . . I didn't have to marry when I was elected
governor. Now, I've been re-elected and I ha
ven't had to marry. And now I'm running for
president . . ." he said, his voice trailing off in
mid-sentence amid cheers from a delighted
gathering. "At least now I'm exploring running
for president."
Asked about his views on establishing a six
year presidential term, Brown deadpanned,
"I'd be glad to take it either way."
'Bungee Jumpers' leap in SF
San Francisco — Four Englishmen and a
woman who call themselves the "Bungee
lumpers" jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge
yesterday morning, their leaps broken by thick
rubber bands that stopped them short of the
water and bounced them back toward the
bridge.
The men, one of whom suffered a bloodied
right hand, wore formal morning suits, com
plete with toppers. The woman wore a sleek
jump suit. They were arrested by the California
Highway Patrol and charged with trespassing
on bridge cables, as was a man who got tangled
in his own lines and didn't jump.
When the jumpers quit bounc ing at the end
of their elastic or bungee cords, they let them
selves down on ropes. Two "escaped" in a
private boat waiting below. Three were grab
bed by the U.S. Coast Guard, one of them
fished from the water, 220 feet below the
bridge floor.
The stunt was well planned in advance.

Photographers from a London newspaper flew
to San Francisco, they said, specifically to
photograph the leapers.
The cameramen said the group were mem
bers of an elite club and had previously

opher Hiatt Baker, 25, got tangled and did not
