The competition between Branner
Hall and several Wilbur houses has
come to an end. Last Friday, after
mutual trashings of lounges and
some angry exchanges between stu
dents and dorm staffers, a halt was
called to the hostilities.
Stanford police appeared during
one particularly pitched battle in
volving several bales of hay and the
portrait of Branner Hall's namesake.
House associates confirmed that
there had been some heated con
frontations but no one was injured or
seriously threatened.
