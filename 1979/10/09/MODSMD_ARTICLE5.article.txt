# Trustee sees 'Catch-22'
## Establishment hinders women in politics 
### Kathleen McClung 
The two major problems confront
ing politically-ambitious women
today are "money and the reluctance
of the political establishment to let
women into the fraternity," said Sha
ron Percy Rockefeller, a long-time
insider in American politics.
Women who seek elected office
encounter "yet another variety of
Catch-22," Rockefeller told a noon
hour audience yesterday.
"Women are not taken seriously as
candidates until they can raise
money. And they cannot raise the
money until they are taken seriously.
So the vicious circle keeps going
around," she said.
Rockefeller, a University trustee
and member of the Board of Direc
tors of the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, described herself as
"hardly a newcomer to politics." She
said she has been continually in
volved in campaigns since 1962.
"As the daughter of a senator
(Charles Percy of Illinois) and the
wife of a governor (Jay Rockefeller), I
have some insight into the political
establishment's method of opera
tion. I think I knowtheir rules. I think

I know their expectations," she said.
Rockefeller's efforts to break into
the political circle include actively
supporting the Equal Rights
Amendment and working with such
groups as the Women's Campaign
Fund.
The 1966 Stanford graduate
acknowledged that "there are a lot of
women on the periphery of the polit
ical establishment.
"They stuff envelopes, answer
telephones, make sure there is
enough coffee and walk door-to
door distributing literature."
"The situation is changing, but it is
changing very slowly," she said.
"Women by and large do not think of
themselves as office-holders be
cause the majority of those who have
spent literally years working in the
political process have spent their ta
lents and their energies getting men
elected.
It is imperative that more women
be elected, Rockefeller concluded,
because "a woman's viewpoint and
herorderingof priorities on all issues
would provide a dimension that has
been missing far too long from our
law-making process."
