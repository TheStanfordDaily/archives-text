# SLAC gets PEPed up for ring test
## 
### Steve Levingston 
Research in high energy physics will receive a
major boost Friday when scientists at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) begin testing the
$78 million Positron-Electron Project (PEP).
PEP is a mile-and-a-half-long storage ring for beams
of electrons and positrons. Guided along a ring by a
series of magnets, the beams circulate at high ener
gies in opposite directions. The ensuing collisions
produce sub-microscopic particles — the tiny bits of
matter scientists study to understand nature at its
most fundamental level.
PEP is based on the same concept as the extant
Stanford Positron-Electron Accelerating Ring
(SPEAR), which began functioning at SLAC in 1972.
PEP however, will proceed on a grander scale than the
older ring.
Scientists are particularly interested in PEP for the
insights it may provide about difficulties experienced
at the only other large positron-electron storage ring
in the world, located in West Germany.
The Petra ring at the Deutsche Elektronen-
Synchrotron (DESY) center at Hamburg was com
pleted about a year ago. It has not yet operated to its
planned potential, however, according to PEP's
Coordinator of Experimental Facilities Pier Oddone.
Since the two rings are similar, the PEP tests wilt
help scientists determine whether Petra's limited in
tensity is caused by technical defects or by something
in the nature of the physics involved.

The experiments this month will test PEP's techni
cal components in careful gradual steps.
"You don't just go in and push a button, and now it's
on," PEP Director John Rees said. "The beast is 710
meters across and very complex. It has literally hun
dreds of power supplies, and it is controlled by a
complex of nine computers."
Friday, Rees will start "turning on" the vast
machine. Two weeks later, a test involving the first
collision monitoring station will be conducted. This
test will be valuable for assessing the operation of PEP
as a whole because the ring consists of five similar
monitoring stations.
Reese said he expects PEP to be fully operational
before the end of the year.
Construction of PEP, begun in 1976, was slowed
earlier this year by a shortage of manpower. Installa
tion of the technical components has been delayed
because, according to Rees, "there are almost no
unemployed electricicans in the whole Bay Area, and
that situation has prevailed since last spring."
The project, funded by the Department of Energy,
has not exceeded $78 million estimated budget, Rees
said.
PEP was designed and constructed in collaboration
with the University of California's Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory (LBL). but SLAC alone takes responsibility
for the operation of the ring, according to Rees.
About 25 universities worldwide will participate in
the first round of PEP experiments, scheduled to
begin early next year.

Buried 80 feet below the rolling terrain of the Sand Hill area, this unit helps to monitor the behavior of positron
and electron particle collisions. Weighing several dozen tons, the assembly is connected to an above-ground
computer monitoring system which graphs the Positron Electron Project research.
