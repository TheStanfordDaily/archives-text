# Brown names homosexual judge
## Gays applaud appointment 
### Cici Oremland 
Cov. Jerry Brown's appoint
ment of an avowed homosex
ual as a California judge was
deemed a "good-sized step
forward" by spokesmen of the
Gay People's Union (CPU) on
campus.
"This is one more indication
that being homosexual has no
thing to do with (one's) ability
to perform any given job," said
Rhio Hiersch, GPU treasurer.
Last month, Brown an
nounced the appointment of
Steven Lachs, a homosexual
and politically pro-gay Los
Angeles a'rea resident, to a re
cently vacated Los Angeles
County Superior Court judge
ship.
Previously Lachs had been a
Los Angeles County/Superior
Court commissioner for 4Vi
years and had served on the
Los Angeles Gay Community
Services Center board.
Though many homosexual
men and women have held im
portant positions in the past,
anti-gay societal pressures
have kept them "in the closet."
"Everybody is very excited,"
Lachs said. "The appointment

really belongs to the whole
community, to those people
who have put a lot of time and
courage into trying to increase
the visibilityof lesbiansand gay
men and who have been work
ing so hard for gay rights."
The gay community on cam
pus "is pleased (with) and
proud of Lachs' appointment,"
Hiersch said. But he added that
at the present time such an ap
pointment may only have oc
curred in California where lib
eral philosophies and practices
are fairly widespread.
Brown has promised con
tinued support to the gay
movement as well as to other
oppressed minority groups.
His aid in defeating Proposi
tion 6, the anti-homosexual
teachers bill, was just one facet
of his pro-human rights efforts,
Hiersch said.
Because of this, he sees
Brown as a "very politically
correc individual," but added
that Lachs' appointment may
have been politically unwise
should Brown seek either
gubernatorial re-election or
the presidency. Such publicity
could cost him the conserva

tive and anti-gay vote, he said.
Hiersch and others fear they
may lose ground should con
servative groups have their
way.
At present such groups seek
to repeal the recently ap
proved gay rights measures in
Santa Clara County and San
Jose. These measures prevent
discrimination in employment,
housing, social services and
education on the basis of social
preference.
The CPU backs strongly both
the county and the city ordi
nances.
"The people working forthis
ordinance are only fighting for
their own basic civil rights,
they seek nothing more com
plicated than the right to a job,
housing and social services,"
emphasized Hiersch.
But though the gay commun
ity backs Brown's human rights
efforts, it may not back him as a
gubernatorial or presidential
candidate.
Hiersch said many
homosexuals tend to be politi
cally and economically conser
vative, and this is contrary to
the many liberal programs
Brown endorses.
