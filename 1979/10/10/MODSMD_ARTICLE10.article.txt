Berlin (AP) — East Germany
celebrated 30 years of Com
munist rule Sunday with a dis
play of military might and
hailed Soviet President Leonid
I. Brezhnev's troop reduction
plan as a major contribution to
peace.

Tanks, missiles and goose
stepping troops of the National
People's Army paraded down
flag-bedecked Karl Marx Allee
before thousands of spec
tators, including Brezhnev and
other leaders of the Warsaw
Pact. The parade capped four

days of festivities that included
events around the country.
The array of East German
military hardware was high
lighted by the Soviet-built T-72
tank, the most advanced
model deployed in Eastern
Europe. Also featured in the
parade were the 152-
millimeter, self-propelled artil
lery and Sam 6 and Sam 9
surface-to-air missiles —
neither of which had been
seen in previous East German
parades.
