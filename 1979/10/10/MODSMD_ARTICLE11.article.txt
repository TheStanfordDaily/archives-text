# Hua says 'Gang of Four' to go on trial

Peking (AP) â€” Chinese Pre
mier Hua Guofeng said Sunday
the "Gang of Four," the de
posed radical group led by the
widow of MaoTse-tung, will be
put on trial but will not be sen
tenced to death.
"As to when, I can tell you it
won't be long," he said.
Hua was responding to a
question during a news con
ference for reporters from
West Germany, France, Britain
and Italy, countries he is to visit
later this month.
Hua, who is also Communist
Party chairman, was quoted by
those present as saying the
new legal code passed in ]uly
by the National People's Con
gress gives all Chinese the right
to trial.
He said the Gang of Four
committed crimes against the
Chinese people, and the cases
would be settled by due pro
cess.
"I can assure you they will
not be treated like they treated
many of our cadres," Hua said.
"They will not be sentenced
to death, and I can tell you they
now are alive and well
treated."
The gang's most prominent
member is Jiang Jing, about 65,
the widow of the late Chairman
Mao. She is regarded by the
current post-Mao leadership as
one of the prime causes of the
past 15 years of turmoil and
civil strife in China.
The others, all former mem
bers of the ruling party Polit
buro, are Yao Wenyuan, Zhang
Zhunjiao and Wang Hongwen.
They wielded considerable
power under Mao's aegis in the
late 1960s and early 19705. Ar

rested in October 1976, a
month after Mao's death, they
have been held in isolation,
their whereabouts unknown.
The specific criminal charges
against them never have been
published but they have been
accused in the press of having
plotted to seize power through
the militia.
The news that the Gang will
soon be put on trial sheds
some light on the status of the
once-powerful radical group.
But it also raises questions on
how China's new legal code,
scheduled to take effect at the
turn of the year, will work in
this case.
What intrigues analysts here
is the nature of the trial to
come. Will it be open to the
public, will the accused have
the right to lawyers and rebut
tal and what will emerge from
the proceedings?
Some observers say that if
the trial is not controlled, facts
may tumble out which could
prove damaging or embarras
sing for the moderates who
have taken over from the
Maoists.
A possible solution is
suggested by one nationally
televised trial. It was recorded
on videotape and released
later after being scrutinized by
Chinese officials.
Perhaps more important to
the Chinese than the long
awaited trial itself was Hua's
indication that the rule of law,
embodied in criminal and civil
coded passed by the Chinese
Parliament in July, will apply to
everyone from the lowliest
peasant to the highest party of
ficial.
