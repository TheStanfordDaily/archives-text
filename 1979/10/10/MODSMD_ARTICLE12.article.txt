### 
London (AP) — Nguyen Van Thieu, former
president of what once was South Vietnam, was
quoted Friday in a rare interview as saying U.S.
troops were more trouble than help in the war
and he will "never associate with the Americans
again."
His forces "could have beaten the com
munists" if U.S. troops had not been in the
country, the British weekly, Now quoted him as
saying.
Thieu, 56, bitter about what he considers a
U.S. betrayal, has been living reclusively in a
London suburb since shortly after the fall of
Saigon in 1975. 1
Could have won
"If they had supplied us with the money and
the weapons my army could have won the war. I
really mean this," the magazine interview con
tinued. "Without the American presence we
could have beaten the communists."
Thieu was quoted as saying: "My people have
suffered much under the new regime. They tell
me that if the lamp posts could leave my country
they would."
Asked if he was doing anything to help the
Vietnamese boat people who have been leaving
the country in droves, the magazine quoted
Thieu as responding, "I have nothing to do with

them."
Thieu said he believes Vietnam's present
communist regime, some of whose leaders he
knows from military school or the war to break
free from France, will collapse from internal dis
sention and pressure from neighboring China,
the magazine said. The two nations are at odds
over the boundaries of their shared border and
over Vietnam's backing of the new Cambodian
regime of Heng Samrin, which last )anuary
ousted the Chinese-backed government of Pol
Pot.
'I will return'
"I intend to return to my country," Thieu was
quoted as saying. "I don't know when or how,
but I will return."
Thieu, whose real estate agents refer to him as
"Mr. Martin," has moved twice in his quest for
anonymity since arriving from temporary
sanctuary in Taiwan, the magazine said.
It reported Thieu's latest house is a $770,000
mansion nicknamed "the White House" in the
lush suburb of Kingston on Thames, where the
ex-strongman was described as "quietly at war
with the weeds" in his garden.
"As for the American government, I want no
thingtodowith them," he was quoted as saying.
"I won't even talk to the American press."
