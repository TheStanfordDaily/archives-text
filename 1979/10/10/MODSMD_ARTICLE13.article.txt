Chocolate Fields Forever
Business is off and rolling for Mrs. Fields' Chocolate Chippery, with this annex of the University
Avenue store assisting readers digest in front of the bookstore. Cookies are delivered around 10
a.m. and usually get gobbled by 4 p.m. And yes, there really is a Mrs. Fields.
