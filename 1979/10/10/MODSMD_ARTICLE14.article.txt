# Doctors may defuse cancer bomb

Omaha, Neb. (AP) — About 15
million Americans are ticking
cancer time bombs with an
enormously high risk of de
veloping cancer — or of pas
sing their high-risk genes on to
their children, researchers say.
But cancer doctors at the
Creighton School of Medicine
here say they have a way to de
fuse what they call "the
Hiroshima among us" — com
pile a complete family history.
The doctors say that proper
interpretation of family his
tories can lead to early detec
tion, control and possible pre
vention of hereditary cancer.
"What's so important here is
the patent simplicity in gather
ing family histories - it's just
there," said Dr. Henry Lynch.
"That's the beauty of this. It
may be simpler than some of
the most expensive and tedi
ous diagnostic tests in
medicine."
Lynch and Dr. William Al
bano are members of the
Creighton research team
which published its findings in
The Journal of the American
Medical Association last
month.
Some cancers hereditary
Lynch and Albano said their
research shows that between
10 percent and 20 percent of all
varieties of cancer are transmit
ted from generation to genera
tion. At the high end of the es
timate is breast cancer, one of
the deadliest forms of the dis
ease.
"We think about 20 percent
of all breast cancer is familial,"
Lynch said. "So given the fact
that the American Cancer Soc
iety estimates that 107,000 U.S.
women will develop breast
cancer during 1979, we predict
a little over 21,000 of those
cases will be familial cases.
"This means these 21,000
women all have families that

ought to be notified or made
aware of this."
Daughters inherit
Albano described what usu
ally happens in a family which
passes the breast cancer gene
from mother to daughter to
granddaughter.
"Each generation, these
daughters get born. While
they're still teen-agers, they
watch their mothers die ot

breast cancer. Then they get
married, have their own
families and die of breast
cancer when they're 35.
"The key is not just identify
ing the patient with cancer but
identifying their tamilies," Al
bano said.
Lynch said a relatively young
woman who'd had one can
cerous breast removed came

to him lor counseling. When a
family history was completed,
Lynch saw a pattern of cancer.
Preventative medicine
"Because of the excess inci
dence of breast cancer in her
family, I advised her to have
prophylactic preventative re
moval of her other breast even
though after extensive testing,
we saw absolutely no evidence
of cancer," Lynch said.
