# Expert calls for 'new physics'
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Physics Prof. Dennis Sciama
of the University of' Texas and
Oxford called for the re-exami
nation of current physics in the
first of an endowed lecture
series on physics last week.
Speaking on the origin of the
universe to a ciowd that over
flowed out of the Physics Lec
ture Hall, Sciama said that gen
eral relativity has been unable
to explain what happened dur
ing the "Big Bang."
Astrophysicists have been
able to examine effects of the
kinds of events that occurred
back to a split second after the
creation of the universe but at
that point general relativity
breaks down, he said.
Some physicists simply ac
cept this state of affairs, others
hope to resolve it by combin
ing quantum theory and grav

ity, Sciama said. Bui he said he
believes that it will take com
pletely new physics to resolve
the singularity.
The most important discov
ery is that "everything that
exists is amenable to methods
of physics," he continued.
"We can now discuss the
universe in a rational way' he
said.
Cosmology has fliade two
important discoveries in this
century, according to Sciama.
The first, the Hubble Law, re
sulted from the discovery that
the spectrums ot other galaxies
are shitted toward the red end,
indicating they are moving
away from us at a speed prop
ortional to their distance.
This means no single galaxy
is at the center, all move away
from each other, he said. An
observer in any galaxy will ob

serve the other galaxies mov
ing away from him at speeds
proportional to their distance.
"Hubble dethroned the
galaxy as center of the universe
as Kepler dethroned earth,"
Sciama said.
Hubble's law brings up the
question whether the universe
will keep on expanding or will
eventually fall back upon itself
in what some call "the big
crunch."Thequestion remains
unanswered because it de
pends on the density of matter
in the universe, a quantity
which is still not known, Sci
ama said.
The second important dis
covery, according to Sciama,
was of three-degree Kelvin
background radiation. This
radiation, considered a re
mnant of the Big Bang, effec
tively ruled out competing
cosmological theories.
