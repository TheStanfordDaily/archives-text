# Student groups find office space
## 
### Arlyn Purcell 
Student organizations have been
aided temporarily in their quest for
badly needed space by the allocation
and refurbishing of a campus building,
the old Stanford press room
Located behind the offices of the
Daily, the building has been affection
ately dubbed the Augsberger Room
since former Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance Bob Augsberger de
cided several years ago to close the
press, according to Bob Beyers, direc
tor of University News and Publica
tions.
The groups will use the room, re
modeled in August, on a short-term but
may have to relocate within as little as a
year, according to Student Activities
Office Adviser Patricia Brandt.
Several organizations last year
exerted considerable pressure on the
University to provide them with space,
and last spring the administration
moved to find some means to alleviate
the problem.
New locations were found for El Cen
tro Chicano, the Black Community Ser
vices Center, Aurora, the YWCA and
the Women's Center last year.
Croups to share room
At the same time, Associate Dean for
Student Affairs Dan Williams began to
look for a place that a number of other
groups could share. He said he felt the
"Augsberger Room," a roomy 24 feet by 74
feet, would, with some remodeling, be

able to serve that purpose.
The space had already been reserved to
house the future expansion of the campus
Reprographic Services Department. But,
because the room was to remain vacant
for some time, permission was given for it
to be used on a short-term basis.
Soon after approval of the project last
year, the University invited campus
groups to apply for the space. About 40
organizations submitted requests.
A committee of students and faculty
reviewed the applications and made re
commendations before Dean of Stu
dent Affairs lames Lyons gave approval
to 14 groups.
Various organizations
The organizations sharing the space
are Amnesty International, the Chinese
Student Association, the Conservative
Student Union, the Criminal justice In
formation center, the |azz at Stanford
Club, Stanford Camp, New Directions,
Stanford Public Interest Research
Group, the Stanford Rhetorical Society,
the Viennese Ball Committee, the Black
Media Institute, Stanford-in-Law, the
Armenian Cultural Association, and
Roses Against a Nuclear Environment
(RANE).
Groups with special programs and
new organizations were favored over
those who already had regular office
hours, Brandt said. Groups whose ap
plications were rejected already had
space of their own or were given space

elsewhere, according to Brandt.
"Very tew groups that went through
the application process are out in the
cold, she added.
Room remodeled
This summer's renovation of the
press room to accommodate the
groups included replacement of the
floor, rewiring of electricity and instal- %
lation of electrical outlets, addition of
carpeting, painting, construction of a
small partition to separate office space
from the meeting area, and the purch
ase of a couch, table and desk. The pro
ject cost approximately $10,000.
Kathy Doi, a member of RANE, said
she was pleased about the organiza
tion's new home. According to Doi, the
room will be RANE's first on-campus
spot. The main benefit, she said, is that
"it is a very central place. Everyone can
come and get information."
Such benefits may be only tempor
ary, however, University officials said. The
room is guaranteed to the groups for a
year but after that time, the space may be
used by Reprographics until it is ready to
move. The management of Reprographics
said it did not know when that would be.
Once the shop does complete its expan
sion, the availability of space will again bea
problem.
"The University is already looking for
solutions," Brandt said. "Whether that's
going to be the remodeling of Tresidder,
building a new building . . . something's
got to give."

exerted considerable pressure on the
University to provide them with space,
and last spring the administration
moved to find some means to alleviate
the problem.
New locations were found for El Cen
tro Chicano, the Black Community Ser
vices Center, Aurora, the YWCA and
the Women's Center last year.
Croups to share room
At the same time, Associate Dean for
Student Affairs Dan Williams began to
look for a place that a number of other
groups could share. He said he felt the
"Augsberger Room," a roomy 24 feet by 74
feet, would, with some remodeling, be

able to serve that purpose.
The space had already been reserved to
house the future expansion of the campus
Reprographic Services Department. But,
because the room was to remain vacant
for some time, permission was given for it
to be used on a short-term basis.
Soon after approval of the project last
year, the University invited campus
groups to apply for the space. About 40
organizations submitted requests.
A committee of students and faculty
reviewed the applications and made re
commendations before Dean of Stu
dent Affairs lames Lyons gave approval
to 14 groups.
Various organizations
The organizations sharing the space
are Amnesty International, the Chinese
Student Association, the Conservative
Student Union, the Criminal justice In
formation center, the |azz at Stanford
Club, Stanford Camp, New Directions,
Stanford Public Interest Research
Group, the Stanford Rhetorical Society,
the Viennese Ball Committee, the Black
Media Institute, Stanford-in-Law, the
Armenian Cultural Association, and
Roses Against a Nuclear Environment
(RANE).
Groups with special programs and
new organizations were favored over
those who already had regular office
hours, Brandt said. Groups whose ap
plications were rejected already had
space of their own or were given space

elsewhere, according to Brandt.
"Very tew groups that went through
the application process are out in the
cold, she added.
Room remodeled
This summer's renovation of the
press room to accommodate the
groups included replacement of the
floor, rewiring of electricity and instal- %
lation of electrical outlets, addition of
carpeting, painting, construction of a
small partition to separate office space
from the meeting area, and the purch
ase of a couch, table and desk. The pro
ject cost approximately $10,000.
Kathy Doi, a member of RANE, said
she was pleased about the organiza
tion's new home. According to Doi, the
room will be RANE's first on-campus
spot. The main benefit, she said, is that
"it is a very central place. Everyone can
come and get information."
Such benefits may be only tempor
ary, however, University officials said. The
room is guaranteed to the groups for a
year but after that time, the space may be
used by Reprographics until it is ready to
move. The management of Reprographics
said it did not know when that would be.
Once the shop does complete its expan
sion, the availability of space will again bea
problem.
"The University is already looking for
solutions," Brandt said. "Whether that's
going to be the remodeling of Tresidder,
building a new building . . . something's
got to give."
