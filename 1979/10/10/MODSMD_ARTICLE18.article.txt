## Rainbow was art 
### 
Last fall, the pledges at Alpha Delta
Phi painted a colorful rainbow de
sign across part of the front of their
house. The mural was easily seen by
motorists and joggers on Junipero
Serra Boulevard near Lake Lagunita.
At least it could be easily seen until
classes began last month.
Deemed inharmonious with the
architectural design of the buildings
on campus, the rainbow was painted
over by fraternity members under
order of the administration.
Although the rainbow met with
generally favorable reaction here, it
was evidently not art in thesense ofan
Albers Wall. We would like to see
some long-range physical plan of the
central campus which showed
Lomita Mall as the targeted site for a
55-foot long stone wall, or anything
else so obtrusive.
Such a wall is much less harmoni
ous with the campus plan than was
the Alpha Delt rainbow.
We perceive an inconsistent uni
versity policy concerning works of

art here and the respect due them.
Albers Wall was so respected that the
sentiment of the community was un
important in the decision to place it
where it now stands partially con
structed.
But the rainbow was evidently un
deserving in the housing office's
eyes of the consideration usually
given works of art.
The decision to force the fraternity
to paint over the rainbow was at its
best a pompous display of powerand
at its worst, a blatant disregard for a
legitimate work of art. Just because
the mural was designed and painted
by students does not mean it is
worthless as art.
Prior approval or not, the rainbow
was there and it was enjoyed by the
vast majority of persons who saw it.
And it spiced up a pretty dull facade
on the fraternity house.
All we ask is that a little more re
spect be given to the work of stu
dents here and to their opinions of
the aesthetic values of works of art.
