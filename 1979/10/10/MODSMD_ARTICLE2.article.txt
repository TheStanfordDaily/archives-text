# $2 million revenue loss seen
## Hospital reimbursement formula altered 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
Changes in the formula used to
reimburse the University for patient
charges covered by Medicare and
Medi-Cal are expected to tut deeply
into net income in the coming year at
the Stanford University Hospital.
That statement came yesterday
alter the Board of Trustees approved
a $99.5 million budget for the Hospi
tal for 1979-80. The budget is 9.5 per
cent larger than 1978-79.
The changes in Medicare-Medi-
Cal rules are expected to cost $2 mill
ion in revenues over the coming
year, according to Ross Campbell,
associate counsel for medical affairs.
Hospital officials had planned to
realize a $4.5 million surplus in 1979-
80, but the budget approved yester
day includes only a $<.24 million ba
lance.
According to Campbell, the gov
ernment reimburses the Hospital for
routine costs incurred in caring for
patients covered by Medicare and
Medi-Cal.
Cost definition
Bui Campbell said the new prob
lem arises because the government
has revised the way it defines
"costs."
Effective last July 1, new methods
of determining maximum cost reim
bursement resulted in a drop in the
amount of money the Hospital is
reimbursed for Medicare patients
each day.
Last year, the university received
$180 per day for patients, according
to Dan Heath, acting co-director of
finance at the Hospital.
The $180 was close to Hospital
costs, "as Medicare defines costs,"
Heath said.

This year, costs by that definition
have risen to $195 per day. But the
limits for reimbursement have drop
ped so the Hospital can now receive
only $ 169 per day, Heath said.
Heath said the drop resulted from
a new way of liguring reimbursement
limits. In the past, Medicare grouped
hospitals by bed size and geographi
cal area. They then figured the cost
per day tor all hospitals in a group,
took theBoth percentile ot that figure
and added 10 percent of the mean
cost per day figure to get the reim
bursement limit tor each hospital.
Tins year, the limit is the 80th per
centile figure with no additional 10
percent of mean added. But Heath
said the Hospital was hit because it
was in new groupings.
Grouped with the East
Under the new plan, hospitals are
grouped by bed size only. This, he
said, put the Hospital in with a large
number of Eastern hospitals.
In the East, Campbell explained,
patient stays are generally longer
than in the West, and this makes the
cost per day less.
Heath said this is because later in a
hospital stay "you don't have the in
tensity of care you have your first few
days."
Limit lower
Because the cost per day is less in
the East, this pulls the limit down for
Western hospitals with shorter aver
age patient stays.
Campbell said the Hospital is try
ing to get Medicare to recognize the
shorter stays as a general savings to
the program as a whole and to re
ward the shorter average stay with a
higher cost-per-day reimbursement
figure.
So far, the effort has met with mar

ginal success. Medicare has agreed
to increase reimbursement amounts
by 25 percent ot the total cost savings
realized by the shorter hospital stay.
Recognition
But Campbell said the reimburse
ment should recognize the entire
cost savings to make the reimburse
ment fair. He said that it the Hospital
were reimbursed recognizingall, not
just 25 percent, of the costs savings,
therewould be nos2 million revenue
loss this year.
The loss will reduce net income by
1b.4 percent in 1979-80, and that will
mean tighter budgets throughout

the Hospital.
Budget surpluses there are impor
tant because new code requirements
and more modern equipment re
quire expenditures of large sums of
money on capital improvements.
Capital expenditures for 1979-80
are budgeted at $8.9 million, ac cord
ing to a trustee report.
Other features of the budget in
clude a reduced number of expected
patient days next year, from over
165,000 to about 163,000. Salaries will
rise an average 9 percent, and statt
benefits are expected to jump 12.4
percent.
