## Americans no longer sing the national anthem 
### 
|ust prior to the opening kic
koff at a recent Stanford home
football contest, my ears were
filled with the sounds of a
familiar song. Silence over
came many in the crowd as the
majority rose from their seats.
Several turned to face a multi
colored cloth rippling in the
breeze.
As the music played, not a
single voice could be heard fol
lowing along. My thoughts
drifted back to childhood days,
and I remembered the thrill of
seeing thousands of spectators
rise and sing loudly in unison
with the same notes to the
same banner.
Simultaneously, I wondered
just where the former en
thusiasm had gone and how
fnany in the present audience
actually knew the words to the
song or the meaning of the
colors and symbols on the flag.
That Americans no longer
sing the national anthem nor
idolize the star-spangled ban
ner is indicative of the dwindl

ing sense of nationalistic pride
which has slowly evolved over
the past two decades.
During this period, our pre
vious faith in democracy has
been tainted by several politi
cal assassinations, a purpose
less overseas war, corruption
in the nation's highest office,
progressively rising inflation
and unemployment, uninspir
ing leadership and the incon
venience of a critical energy
situation. The net impact of
these multiple factors on
American society has been a
severe psychosocial depres
sion, manifested by a
generalized lack of enthusiasm
in the conduct of our daily
lives.
The free enterprise system
under which our democracy is
run has taught us to work hard
for a living, but unfortunately
in the process has conditioned
us to work against each other.
The result has been a frag
mented society composed of
citizens with common prob

lems but an apparent unwil
lingness to work together in at
tempting to solve them.
We can and should learn
from each other. Yet despite
ample opportunities, we con
sistently retreat from construc
tive communication.
The American depression
112 as perhaps its greatest impact
in the realm of personal
employment. That many citi
zens presently despise their
jobs is undeniable; complaints
range trom disagreements with
supervisors to poor working
conditions to inadequate
iakries.
Rising rates of suicide, al
coholism, drug abuse,
psychological disorders such
as anxiety and depression, di
vorce and child abuse are grim
testimony that the American
psychosocial crisis has not
spared the individual. Many
citizens find little purpose in
their lives, hence the popular
ity of cults and movements
such as the People's Temple.

In order to bring the people
of America back together
under a new spirit of
nationalistic pride and op
timism, a new national goal
must be defined. Personal fi
nancial and materialistic gain
must take a lesser priority to a
reemphasis on altruism and a
sincere desire to get along with
one's fellow man.
Every citizen must be en
couraged to relearn the feeling
that comes from doing some
thing positive for another
human being. When and if the
day comes that we are working
together as Americans rather
than against each other as
capitalists, perhaps we can
solve more problems and
create less.
The beauty of outlining team
spirit and good will toward fel
low citizens as a new national
goal is that every individual,
regardless of age, sex, race,
occupation cr social status can
contribute equally toward it.
Smile and talk to that person

next to you on the bus; he is an
American with American prob
lems just like your own. When
you take out your garbage,
think about that man, that
American, who has to pick it
up, and make things easier for
him.
At work, go about each task
with the attitude that any job
worth doing is worth doing
right; be obedient to those
above you, and give praise to
those below you. Make it your
daily goal to make another
American happy.
The American people have
demonstrated several times
that they are capable of uniting
to fight a common enemy; we
have such now, and it happens
to be our own attitude. Simply
by learning to work together
and taking pride in getting
along with other members of
our nation, the battle may be
won. We may all again know
the words to that once
forgotten song.
