In your editorial Oct. 8,
"Keep Chief Off the Field,"
you stated that the Band "lent
its name to the movement to
retain Williams and the Indian
mascot" by "allowing Williams
to dance' as it played the na
tive American fanfare." We
would like to clarify our posi
tion.
First, the song is not called
"native American fanfare," just
"Pregame Fanfare."
Second, the Band has been
planning to play Fanfare for
months as one of a series of
songs being recorded for an
upcoming album.
We didn't play it for Wil

liams. In fact, assistant man
ager Bruce Heiman asked him
not to dance just before we
played the song.
Instead of complying, Wil
liams' followers issued a veiled
threat. What were we to do?
Physically remove him from
the field?
You also stated that "the
Band showed its ignorance of
the issue by repeatedly having
the bass drummer start a 'war
chant' drum beat." The drum
beat was not a "war chant,"
rather, it is a tradition that was
started as a tribute to the
Thunder Chickens defensive
ißoe in the 1971 Rose Bowl.
We played the drum beat to

encourage the students to ac
tively back their team. The
score was close, the game was
importanf, and we felt that
such a unifying element was
needed. We didn't play it as a
result of our "ignorance" of
the Indian issue.
It's unfortunate that this has
become such a controversial
issue. We're sure we will all be
happier when we find a solu
tion. But until then, we hope
you will excuse us — we have
to go water our tree.

Why not Cooleys?
In the Oct. 8 Daily there was
a letter ("A noble symbol") cal
ling for the return, with a new
"mature perspective," of Chief
Lightfoot as Stanford's mascot.
Although tradition is a
legitimate reason for bringing
back Chief Lightfoot and The
Indian as Stanford's mascot,
we must recognize that Stan
ford also has progressive roots,
and many here see the singling
out of this one ethnic group as
demeaning.

It is also evident that the
more recent names chosen,
the Cardinals and the Trees,
have too little heritage to mean
anything to the Stanford com
munity.
Stanford needs a new mas
cot, but one which can match
the heritage of this university.
There is one group of people
who deserve this honor, our
Asian-Americans, and I would
propose a new name to sym
bolize the University, "The
Stanford Cooleys."
The Asian Americans are a
proud, courageous and brave
people whose heritage runs
deep in this land. After all, it
was the frtiits of their labor

which helped Leland Stanford
to finance and build this uni
versity.
It need not be a mockery of
any ethnic group to use "The
Cooleys" as a symbol of the
University, but rather, with the
proper attitude, a tribute to
their spirit.
It is time to end the weak,
impotent excuses by which we
name our athletic teams —
Cardinals, Trees . . . Bring on
"The Stanford Cooleys" with a
mature perspective, and thus
pride to Stanford and the Asian
Americans.
