## Makato Natori U.S.-Japan trade re-evaluated 
### 
According to the Daily article
(Sept. 24) concerning U.S.-
Japan trade, former U.S. Am
bassador to Japan James
Hodgson proposed as a solu
tion the following, "Japan
should buy more American
finished goods and patience
on the part of Americans to
allow the Japanese to do so,
and the pressure on Japan to
import more from America."
Visiting Prof. Yozo
Vamamoto disagrees.
While Political Science Prof.
Dan Okomoto says the
Japanese industrial structure
must change from only export
ing heavy industrial com
modities to knowledge
intensive products.
Actually, Japanese exports to
the U.S. equal 25 percent of all

Japanese exports. In contrast,
imports from the U.S. were 10
percent in 1977, and 80 percent
of Japanese imports are raw
materials and foods, and 20
percent are finished goods.
Not only the U.S., but also
West European countries
would like Japan to import
more finished goods. Ameri
can and West European criti
cisms are as follows:
1) The U.S. trade deficits and
current Japanese surplus are
caused by the.increase in
American oil imports, the fall in
international competitive
power of American products
compared with the world mar
ket, and the rise of inflation in
the U.S.
2) The American defense
budget is six percent of the
U.S. GNP, but the Japanese
budget only 0.9 percent of the
Japanese GNP. Aids and grants
from Japan to the less
developed countries were 0.21
percent of Japanese GNP
(1977), but these will rise to 0.3
percent within the year,
roughly the level of other ad
vanced countries.
3) Japanese policies are not
transparent, and difficult to
understand by foreign coun
tries. The Japanese govern
ment and industries are closely
tied together in order to build
up policies, strengthen the in
ternational competitive power
of Japanese commodities, and
promote the export of
Japanese products to the ad
vanced countries.

The main question here, it
seems to me, is, "How can one
strengthen the competitive
power of American industrial
goods (quality) and marketing
in Japan, as well as the world
market.
For example, in the field of
the Japanese small car market,
if the U.S. auto-maker had
enough competition with the
appropriate price and quality,
marketing and distribution,
the U.S. auto-maker could ex
pand sales in Japan to contri
bute to the Japanese economy.
On the other hand, Japan
has had in the past over
protectionism against the im
ports of finished goods. Even
though Japanese goods are of
high quality, I feel we should
allow the entry of more exports
in order to increase employ
ment in the exporting coun
tries. Trade is as reciprocal as
diplomacy. I quite agree with
Hodgson that Japan shouid
buy more American finished
goods.
In addition, Japan has been
trying to change its industrial
structure to realize interna
tional division of labor,(high
added value and economizing
energy) and to shift to
knowledge-intensive indus
tries, as Okomoto said. Of
course, this shift will contri
bute toward solving the trade
surplus. If Yamamoto knew the
above-mentioned by
Hodgson, he would agree with
him.
But we have to say that

foreign trade is not only com
modities trade, it includes the
trade of services, transfer of
capital, foreign investment and
loan and so forth.
Japanese exporting indus
tries, (for example, Sony and
Honda) can afford to do busi
ness like international market
ing and on-the-spot produc
tion. The U.S. should ask Japan
to invest directly in the U.S. as
this would contribute toward
solving the trade surplus and
improve the Japanese basic ba
lance of payment.
However, it takes time to
harmonize the U.S.-Japan
trade policies, "Where the
term dan-dan (Gradual) is by
tradition synonymous with the
desired pace of change," as
Hodgson said.
The question of how to
realize the appropriate Ameri
can economic growth on the
basis of stable general prices,
the increase in employment,
and the equilibrium of foreign
trade in the U.S. is the most
important one for the Ameri
can economy. In addition, high
labor productivity and
strengthening international
competitive power should be
the goal for the U.S..
As a result, the more the U.S.
tries to realize a more stable
economy, the more effectively
can it solve the problems ot the
U.S.-Japan trade surplus.
