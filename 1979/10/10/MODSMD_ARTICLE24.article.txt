## Pope a true world leader 
### 
The new Pope is an astound
ing man.
With a (lair tor crowds and a
straightforwardness that is ab
solutely refreshing — whether
you agree with him or not —
John Paul II has been sweeping
through country after country

and winning the admiration of
millions.
lust watching him tor brief
moments on television reveals
what those at the Vatican have
been saying since his installa
tion — the man is a born
leader.
Yet what is behind all the
pomp, circumstance and papal
regalia? While his media image
is certainly impressive and his
public appearance track record
good, it may be asked whether
John Paul II is nothing more
than a charismatic figurehead
for the world's largest organi
zation.
In this age of seeking after
heroes any individual — sub
stantial or not — with a strong
presence and a pleasing man
ner can be sure of a wide fol
lowing.
Can a man sitting atop j di
verse and enormous ecclesias
tical organization really stand
stronulv for views that might
offend many or most of the
world's power structures?
I answer "yes."
John Paul II is a believer in
the intrinsic worth of the
human individual, a belief that
is, by his own admission — an
tithetical to the foundational
principles of most modern
societal structures. I think that
many would be profoundly dis
turbed were they to clearly un
derstand what the Pope has
been hinting at in his numer
ous speeches.
While he was still Archbishop
of Krakow, john Paul II wrote
"The Acting Person," a major
work that many consider one
of the more important con
temporary Catholic
philosophical statements. In it

he argues that humankind
knows itself and what itself is
when it makes a moral choice.
Though he doesn't deal with
the issue of particular ethical
systems (his own orientation is
obvious), he insists that only in
the act of ethical choice does a
person become aware of his
own person hood.
Few thinkers or social struc
tu es escape his analysis and
the Pope makes it clear that he
sees Marxist and social-welfare
bureaucracies as serious
threats to the individual's op
portunity for ethical choices,
and hence, for human dignity.
He considers the "con
sumerist" mentality and the
mass media in the West as two
other particularly heinous in
fluences that strip people of
their personhood.
A/hether individuals are
manipulated by government or
by or whether they are
valued only as purchasers of
consumer goods contributing
to the CJNP, John Paul II sees
humankind caught in a down
ward spiral of decreasing free
dom.
The Pope preaches what he
believes is the basis of Christ
ianity — that people are only
persons when they are left to
make individual ethical
choices, and that these choices
are to be made with the gui
dance of the spirit of God. |ohn
Paul II sees this as a part of the
"good news" of the gospel, a
gospel that is undeniably bad
news for many contemporary
social power structures and
ideologies.
