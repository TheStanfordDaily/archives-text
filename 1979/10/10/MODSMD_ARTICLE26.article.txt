# Stanford Museum: full- fledged collection
## 
### Leyla Neyzi 
The Leland Stanford Junior
Museum, located a short bike
ride away from the center of
campus, may provide just the
kind of interesting, free-of
charge entertainment many
University students seek.
Offering a variety of exhibits
wide enough to please even
the most demanding of ap
preciators, the museum's
Committee for Art also spon
sors tours around the Neo
classical building designed
after the Stanfords' favorite
style.
Lecture series sponsored by
the Committee for the Arts and
presented at Annenberg Au
ditorium deal with art and art
history, but may be of interest
to non-majors wishing to
switch channels for awhile.
The halo of Leland Stanford
)r. still lingers in the Museum,
which was initially conceived
as a repository for the various
objects collected during the
Stanfords' travels in Europe
and in Egypt.
The building was founded in
1891 and opened to the public
some time after classes com
menced in the Quad. The Stan
fords soon found the oppor
tunity to enlarge their collec
tion through their connections
with the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and with the
Egypt Exploration Society.
Thus the Ikeda Collection of
Oriental Art and the Cesnola
Collection of Cypriot Pottery

were acquired.
Neo-classical facade
The facade of the museum
was built in the Neo-classical
style much admired by Leland
Jr., while the museum was
considered the largest private
museum in the world at that
period. Unfortunately the
notorious earthquake of 1906
demolished several parts of the
building so that only the por
tion of the building that was
built with steel reinforced
concrete remained. When the
museum reopened in 1909, the
east wing was the only portion

of the former quadrangle to be
utilized.
The Stanford museum was
neglected for several decades
up until its partial renovation
and reopening in 1954.
Numerous additions were
made, over the years, to the
Stanford collection, mostly
through gifts or through occa
sional purchases. The perma
nent exhibits include:
— the Oriental collection
(including the Frank E. Buck
Jade collection);
— European paintings and
sculpture;

— the B.C. Cantor Sculpture
Gallery housing a famed col
lection of original Rodin
sculptures;
— American and American
Indian art;
—the Stanford Family
Rooms;
—Egyptian, Greek and
Roman art in the rotunda;
—19th and 20th century
prints, drawings, photo
graphy, paintings and
sculpture in the second floor
galleries; and
—African, pre-Columbian
and Melanesian art in the

upper rotunda.
Temporary exhibits are
placed in the Miedel Room and
in the Thomas Welton Stanford
Art Gallery. This gallery was
built in 1917 with funds left
from the inheritance of
Thomas Welton Stanford, the
youngest brother of Governor
Stanford.
Temporary exhibits
The Stanford Museum is not
affiliated with any particular
museums or with traveling
exhibits, and their temporary
exhibits mostly consist of
selections from the per
manent collections enriched
by additions borrowed from
various other museums or
from private collections.
The main funds for purch
ases come from the profits of
the Treasure Market organized
by the Committee for Art. This
committee is basically a volun
teer organization formed 25
years ago and boasting more
than 2000 members at present.
It offers docent programs for
tours of the Museum and for
the presentation of portfolios
relating to various aspects of
the collection at local schools.
The Committee carries out a
Treasure Market once every
two years during the spring
break in Roble Gym where art
objects, antiques and house
hold items collected by the
committee or donated to the
Museum are sold. The profit
from this sale is then used to
make purchases for the
Museum's collection. The

Committee for Art also spon
sors Tuesday and Wednesday
evening lectures on topics re
lated to art in the Annenberg
Auditorium at the Cummings
Art Building.
Upcoming events
Currently there is an exhibit
of 50 Paul Klee prints in the
Museum and a Daniel M.
Mendelowitz Retrospective
Exhibition in the Art Gallery.
Some of the exhibits coming

up this year include Henry
Moore lithographs, drawings
by the late eighteenth century
Venetian artist Tiepolo and
"Peruvian Life and Land":
photographs by Martin
Chambi and Edward Ranney.
The Stanford Museum pub
lishes a journal once every two
years that covers new acquisi
tions to the collection as well as
other publications related to
the exhibitions.
