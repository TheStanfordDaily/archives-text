# Heating: how to save energy and costs
## 
### Associated Press 
More than halt the money you
spend to heat your home this
winter may be wasted. And it
doesn't have to be.
Your dollars leak through
cracks around windows"and
doors. They flow from attics
that don't have enough insula
tion. And they vanish, like
smoke, up the chimney.
Terms like thermogram,
energy audit and payback
period are becoming house
hold words, as consumers —
faced with warnings of fuel
bills that could be double last
year's — try to find ways to cut
costs by saving energy.
Utility spokesmen say any
where from 10 percent to 60
percent of the heat produced
to warm U.S. homes is wasted.
That means that you may be
throwing away from one dollar
to six dollars of every 10 dollars
you spend on heating.
The cure may be something
as simple as setting back your
thermostat at night — a move
that can cut energy amount

nine percent to 15 percent de
pending on where you live. Or
it may require a major insula
tion effort — a project that can
mean a savings of 50 percent to
60 percent for some homes.
The Department of Energy
estimates that 40 million
single-family homes — a little
less than two-thirds of the total
— are not properly protected
against the weather.

Our dollars leak through cracks around
windows and doors. They flow from attics
that don't have enough insulation. And they
vanish, like smoke, up the chimney.

Government studies show
that about one-fifth of the
energy consumed in the nation
is used in private homes. Al
most three-fourths of that
amount goes to provide heat
and hot water.
Regulations being de

veloped under the National
Energy Act of 1978 will require
large utilities to help you find
out where you are wasting
energy and suggest ways you
can save. The utilities also will
have to help you arrange to pay
for and install energy-saving
devices.
Some states already require
this kind of effort by utilities; in
other areas, companies have

voluntary programs to encour
age customers to add insula
tion, caulk and weatherstrip
windows and doors, etc.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of
California, for example, has of
fered energy audits to its three
million residential customers
since last November. By the
middle of September, the
company had completed
14,000 audits, according to
spokesman Mike Willhoit. By
the end of the year, it expects
to finish an additional 6000 au
dits.
Utility-sponsored conserva

tion programs vary; some are
free, others cost from three
dollars to ten dollars. Some
utilities send a trained inspec
tor to the customer's house;
others require the homeowner
to do his or her own checking.
In most cases, however, the
end is the same: A computer
analysis that tells you what you
can do to cut energy use, how
much it will cost, how much it
will save and how long it will
take you to save enough to
cover the expense.
Willhoit said Pacific Gas &
Electric's "energy conservation
specialists" visit customers'
homes, spending about an
hour and a-half to two hours,
tocheck thingsliketheamount
of window space, the number
of appliances, the exposure,
the construction of the walls
and frame, the amount of ac
tual living area, the setting of
the thermostat, the type and
size of heating and cooling sys
tems used and the amount of
insulation.

to six dollars of every 10 dollars
you spend on heating.
The cure may be something
as simple as setting back your
thermostat at night — a move
that can cut energy amount

nine percent to 15 percent de
pending on where you live. Or
it may require a major insula
tion effort — a project that can
mean a savings of 50 percent to
60 percent for some homes.
The Department of Energy
estimates that 40 million
single-family homes — a little
less than two-thirds of the total
— are not properly protected
against the weather.

Our dollars leak through cracks around
windows and doors. They flow from attics
that don't have enough insulation. And they
vanish, like smoke, up the chimney.

Government studies show
that about one-fifth of the
energy consumed in the nation
is used in private homes. Al
most three-fourths of that
amount goes to provide heat
and hot water.
Regulations being de

veloped under the National
Energy Act of 1978 will require
large utilities to help you find
out where you are wasting
energy and suggest ways you
can save. The utilities also will
have to help you arrange to pay
for and install energy-saving
devices.
Some states already require
this kind of effort by utilities; in
other areas, companies have

voluntary programs to encour
age customers to add insula
tion, caulk and weatherstrip
windows and doors, etc.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. of
California, for example, has of
fered energy audits to its three
million residential customers
since last November. By the
middle of September, the
company had completed
14,000 audits, according to
spokesman Mike Willhoit. By
the end of the year, it expects
to finish an additional 6000 au
dits.
Utility-sponsored conserva

tion programs vary; some are
free, others cost from three
dollars to ten dollars. Some
utilities send a trained inspec
tor to the customer's house;
others require the homeowner
to do his or her own checking.
In most cases, however, the
end is the same: A computer
analysis that tells you what you
can do to cut energy use, how
much it will cost, how much it
will save and how long it will
take you to save enough to
cover the expense.
Willhoit said Pacific Gas &
Electric's "energy conservation
specialists" visit customers'
homes, spending about an
hour and a-half to two hours,
tocheck thingsliketheamount
of window space, the number
of appliances, the exposure,
the construction of the walls
and frame, the amount of ac
tual living area, the setting of
the thermostat, the type and
size of heating and cooling sys
tems used and the amount of
insulation.

The Persuasions were one of many groups performing this
weekend at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. Proceeds from the
fund raising concert went to "Bread and Roses," a group which
sends live music to prisons, mental hospitals, and convalescent
homes.
