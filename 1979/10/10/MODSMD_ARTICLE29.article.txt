ford Student's Guide to Study, Work and
Travel Abroad.''
This guide is an expanded and improved
version of the 1977 first edition that proved
popular with many colleges as a source of
general information about the opportunities
available to college students overseas, ac
cording to Makino.
Created primarily with the Stanford stu
dent in mind, the guide commences with a
complete list of various overseas facilities
and programs offered here.
In addition it contains a new section which
gives advice to the student who wishes to
best prepare for an eventual career abroad
while continuing studies on the Farm.
Alternatives
Concerning study abroad, the guide points
out the many alternatives available outside of
the usual college-sponsored year abroad
programs.'

Direct enrollment in foreign universities,
conservatories and the possibilities of inde

to the course of the student's ducation here
at Stanford.

study scholarship sounds interesting, the
booklet contains the basic information on
what they consist of and how to apply for
them.
Employment

term, long-term and summer job oppor
tunities; for example, working on digs in Eng
land or on a kibbutz in Israel. The realities of
working abroad, such as obtaining work
permits and visas, are discussed in this sec
tion while the remaining essentials —
passports, insurance, money, etc. — are
listed under another heading.
