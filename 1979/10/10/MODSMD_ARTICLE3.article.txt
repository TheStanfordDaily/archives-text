# Med Center to move pediatric outpatients
## 
### Karen Springen 
The outpatient pediatrics ward at
the Medical Center will move next
month to new buildings at the Chil
dren's Hospital on Willow Road, the
University announced Monday.
The transfer, designed to eliminate
the duplication of services at the
Children's Hospital and at the Medi
cal Center, "will enable both institu
tions to contain costs," said Spyros
Andreopoulos, public relations di
rector at the Med Center.
The move will provide better med
ical care to children, he added, be
cause the Med Center complex has
frequently experienced "conges
tion" and overcrowded conditions.
The current system is "totally illogi
cal" because of its redundant ser
vices, Andreopoulos said.
Each institution treats about 11,(HK)
outpatients a year. The joint facilities
are planned to handle 24,000.
Both institutions will continue
their special inpatient programs, but
the Children's Hospital's nursing and
ancillary services will be combined
with the University's medical staff
and postgraduate educational prog
ram.
Still separate
The consolidation agreement,
reached after more than a year of
negotiations, will maintain the two
institutions' separate identities,
however.

Hence, the move is not a true
merger, Andreopoulos said.
"The goal is to create a strong
single children's medical center
program with two institutions owned
and managed by separate governing
bodies but sharing common profes
sional goals," said Irving Schulman,
chairman of the Med Center's De
partment of Pediatrics.
Intern training
The common program will train
pediatrics residents and interns in
clinical practice as well as the
hospital-based training they have re
ceived until now, said Ruth Gross,
McCormick professor of pediatrics
here. Cross, head of ambulatory
pediatrics at the Med School, will di
rect the center.
Joining the two centers should de
velop "an expanded ambulatory
program" that will improve pediatric
care, teaching and training she ad
ded.
There are no specific plans yet for
the vacant pediatrics ward at the Med
Center, but the area "probably will
be used for other clinical programs
of the school," said Andreopoulos.
The Children's Hospital at Stan
ford is completely independent from
the University and is run by an inde
pendent board of directors. It is lo
cated on Stanford land about a mile
and a half from the Med Center.
