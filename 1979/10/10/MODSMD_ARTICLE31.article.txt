Stanford plays USC this week; not use but
USC.
Maybe it's appropriate that the University
of Southern California is designated by capi
tal letters. Some football teams do not de
serve to use capital letters.
Texas Christian University, perennial patsy
of the Southwest Conference should almost
certainly be tcu. Until recently, the same
went for its counterpart in the SWC, South
ern Methodist University. Their resurgence
has earned the Mustangs an SMU.
USC, however, has always been USC, like
IBM is always IBM and RCA is RCA. Or, more
appropriately, just like the National Football
League is the NFL.
A college football coach recently said there
are only two teams better than USC in the
country. That may come as a shock to Trojan
fans, but what is even more of a surprise is
that the teams the coach named were
Pittsburgh and Dallas of the National Football
League, or NFL.
From attitudes such as these one might
expect that USC intimidates so that their op
ponents depart at halftime, leaving the men
of Troy to themselves for the second half.
However, the Trojans have not convinc
ingly won every game they have played. LSU
(that's in capital letters) was ahead of LJSC
after 59 minutes and 32 seconds had ticked
off the Baton Rouge clock. USC scored and
won, 17-12.
Nor are the Trojans masters of the statis
tics. Washington, in its own Pacific-10 Con
ference, has given up five fewer points per
game, while both the Huskies and Arizona
State are ahead of them in total defense.
The only statistical categories in which the
Trojans are comfortably ahead are the wire
service polls.
Beyond statistics, the prevailing feeling
is that USC looms ahead and has for the past
several years.
1979 is the first year Stanford has not suf
fered from its annual pre-USC slump,
wherein the Cards look sluggish, stumble
around the field and beat Oregon State when
all the while they are dreaming of beating
USC.
The only reason Stanford was slump-free
this year was the presence of UCLA the pre
ceding week. Besides being in capital letters,
UCLA is another foe for whom the Cards have
no trouble psyching up.
That was evident Saturday with the nail
biting 27-24 victory over the Bruins. Although
given many chances in the fourth quarter,
Stanford never said die.
The whole Stanford student body was
aglow Saturday night with an air of, if not
invincibility, then the feeling that "after all,
we do have a damn good football team."

One would expect that encompassing feel
ing to hover over the campus all week, with
concurrent enthusiasm. And especially this
week, with the opportunity for a crazed road
trip to Los Angeles to watch their fellow stu
dents in action.
So impressive is the aura USC casts over
collegiate arenas on autumn Saturdays that it
spreads as well over the campuses of their
opponents during the week.
When asked if he was traveling south for
the game this weekend, one Stanford stu
dent said, "Are you kidding? We're gonna get
stepped on."
Searching questions such as "Have we got
a chance?" have pervaded the Farm all week.
Even oddsmakers as far as Las Vegas have
been influenced by "Trojan superiority."
For the oast couple of years, Stanford has
been a team the bettors love. Last Monday,
UCLA started out a seven-point favorite over
Stanford. It was three-and-one-half the next
day and three at game time, due to the fact
that the bettors usually consider the Cards to
be a sound investment.
USC started out Monday as a 21-point favo
rite over Stanford. Yesterday the spread had
risen to 21 Vi.
The most fervent doubters of Trojan
mythology are the members of the Stanford
football team. Head Coach Rod Dowhower
insists that the Cards will prepare no diffe
rently for USC than they would for tcu.
"In order to prepare for USC, people do
things they don't normally do. All of a sudden
they're out-of-character," the first-year
coach said.
"I hope we don't decide to change charac
ter. We're gonna play hard, let it all hang out
and see what happens," Dowhower added.
Senior defensive end Chuck Evans is
another who is not overwhelmed by the USC
myth. Nonetheless, he will be up for Satur
day's game.
"Emotionally you can't peak for every
game. My being from Southern California,
this is an important game. We're playing the
number one team in the country. To stay in
the conference race we gotta beat USC. I
guarantee we'll be ready," Evans said.
After his team was demolished 50-21 by a
USC squad whose first squad sat out the en
tire second half, Washington State head
coach Jim Waldon said, "We came, we didn't
conquer, we're leaving. We'll just pass USC
on to someone else."
Stanford is that someone else, and for the
Cardinals to win, they are going to have to
pass, and pass better than they did in the
Coliseum two years ago when 208 offensive
yards equalled no points. USC scored 49.
Who knows? With a reversal of that 1977
game, Stanford might make them change it to
USc.

One reason for USC's success — a college football coach recently
said that only Pittsburgh and Dallas of the NFL were superior to the
Trojans — is quarterback Paul McDonald,who threw 19 touchdown
passes last year.

myth. Nonetheless, he will be up for Satur
day's game.
"Emotionally you can't peak for every
game. My being from Southern California,
this is an important game. We're playing the
number one team in the country. To stay in
the conference race we gotta beat USC. I
guarantee we'll be ready," Evans said.
After his team was demolished 50-21 by a
USC squad whose first squad sat out the en
tire second half, Washington State head
coach Jim Waldon said, "We came, we didn't
conquer, we're leaving. We'll just pass USC
on to someone else."
Stanford is that someone else, and for the
Cardinals to win, they are going to have to
pass, and pass better than they did in the
Coliseum two years ago when 208 offensive
yards equalled no points. USC scored 49.
Who knows? With a reversal of that 1977
game, Stanford might make them change it to
USc.

One reason for USC's success — a college football coach recently
said that only Pittsburgh and Dallas of the NFL were superior to the
Trojans — is quarterback Paul McDonald,who threw 19 touchdown
passes last year.

Stanford plays USC this week; not use but
USC.
Maybe it's appropriate that the University
of Southern California is designated by capi
tal letters. Some football teams do not de
serve to use capital letters.
Texas Christian University, perennial patsy
of the Southwest Conference should almost
certainly be tcu. Until recently, the same
went for its counterpart in the SWC, South
ern Methodist University. Their resurgence
has earned the Mustangs an SMU.
USC, however, has always been USC, like
IBM is always IBM and RCA is RCA. Or, more
appropriately, just like the National Football
League is the NFL.
A college football coach recently said there
are only two teams better than USC in the
country. That may come as a shock to Trojan
fans, but what is even more of a surprise is
that the teams the coach named were
Pittsburgh and Dallas of the National Football
League, or NFL.
From attitudes such as these one might
expect that USC intimidates so that their op
ponents depart at halftime, leaving the men
of Troy to themselves for the second half.
However, the Trojans have not convinc
ingly won every game they have played. LSU
(that's in capital letters) was ahead of LJSC
after 59 minutes and 32 seconds had ticked
off the Baton Rouge clock. USC scored and
won, 17-12.
Nor are the Trojans masters of the statis
tics. Washington, in its own Pacific-10 Con
ference, has given up five fewer points per
game, while both the Huskies and Arizona
State are ahead of them in total defense.
The only statistical categories in which the
Trojans are comfortably ahead are the wire
service polls.
Beyond statistics, the prevailing feeling
is that USC looms ahead and has for the past
several years.
1979 is the first year Stanford has not suf
fered from its annual pre-USC slump,
wherein the Cards look sluggish, stumble
around the field and beat Oregon State when
all the while they are dreaming of beating
USC.
The only reason Stanford was slump-free
this year was the presence of UCLA the pre
ceding week. Besides being in capital letters,
UCLA is another foe for whom the Cards have
no trouble psyching up.
That was evident Saturday with the nail
biting 27-24 victory over the Bruins. Although
given many chances in the fourth quarter,
Stanford never said die.
The whole Stanford student body was
aglow Saturday night with an air of, if not
invincibility, then the feeling that "after all,
we do have a damn good football team."

One would expect that encompassing feel
ing to hover over the campus all week, with
concurrent enthusiasm. And especially this
week, with the opportunity for a crazed road
trip to Los Angeles to watch their fellow stu
dents in action.
So impressive is the aura USC casts over
collegiate arenas on autumn Saturdays that it
spreads as well over the campuses of their
opponents during the week.
When asked if he was traveling south for
the game this weekend, one Stanford stu
dent said, "Are you kidding? We're gonna get
stepped on."
Searching questions such as "Have we got
a chance?" have pervaded the Farm all week.
Even oddsmakers as far as Las Vegas have
been influenced by "Trojan superiority."
For the oast couple of years, Stanford has
been a team the bettors love. Last Monday,
UCLA started out a seven-point favorite over
Stanford. It was three-and-one-half the next
day and three at game time, due to the fact
that the bettors usually consider the Cards to
be a sound investment.
USC started out Monday as a 21-point favo
rite over Stanford. Yesterday the spread had
risen to 21 Vi.
The most fervent doubters of Trojan
mythology are the members of the Stanford
football team. Head Coach Rod Dowhower
insists that the Cards will prepare no diffe
rently for USC than they would for tcu.
"In order to prepare for USC, people do
things they don't normally do. All of a sudden
they're out-of-character," the first-year
coach said.
"I hope we don't decide to change charac
ter. We're gonna play hard, let it all hang out
and see what happens," Dowhower added.
