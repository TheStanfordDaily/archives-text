## Rain washes out opener of Series 
### 
Baltimore (AP) — The open
ing game of the 1979 World
Seriesbetween theßaltimore
Orioles and Pittsburgh Pirates
was postponed by a torrential
rainstorm last night.
It was the first time the open
ing game of the seven-game
Series was called off because of
rain.
Baseball Commissioner
Bowie Kuhn called the game at
8:32 p.m. EDT and it was re
scheduled for tonight.
Game Two of the Series will
be played Thursday night, and
the Series then shifts to
Pittsburgh Friday night, as pre
viously scheduled.
The travel day originally set
for Thursday was eliminated.
Gloomy, dark skies hung low
over Baltimore most of Tues
day, and the rain began at
about 5 p.m. — 3'/2 hours be
fore the scheduled start of
play.
Tarps covered the Memorial
Stadium infield, but puddles
quickly developed in left and
right field.
The condition of the field al
ready had been a concern be
cause of the National Football
League game between the Bal
timore Colts and New York
lets, played Sunday. The
Colts-Jets game was the fifth
football contest played this
season at Memorial Stadium.
The rainout was the first for a
World Series game since 1975,
when the sixth game between
the Boston Red Sox and Cin
cinnati Reds was postponed
two days by the weather in Bos
ton.
Fans, many of them wearing
yellow rain slickers and carry
ing multi-colored umbrellas,
arrived at the ballpark and
waited out the storm.
About 30 minutes before the
scheduled start, they cheered
the arrival of The Bird, a large
feathered creature who stood
under an umbrella, leading
cheers. But even the Orioles'
mascot was forced to seek
shelter from the rain.
As the steady rain continued
to fall, the scoreboard flashed a
cheerful "Hello" in capital let

ters to the fans. Later, themes
sage was changed to "The Bal
timore Orioles and Pittsburgl
Pirates Welcome You to Gami
One of the 1979 World Series.'
It was the 26th postpone
ment in World Series history —
25 rainouts and one because o
cold weather.
Both teams said they woult
stay with the pitchers anc
lineups they had originally an
nounced for Tuesday night
That means Bruce Kison for the
Pirates against Baltimore'*
Mike Flanagan.
Kison posted a 13-7 recorc
during the regular season, but
has been particularly effective
in September and October. He
won four games last month for
the Pirates, pushing his eight
year career record tor Sep
tember to 23-6. Fie has never
lost in October, with a career
4-0 record for this month.
Flanagan was the top winner
in the majors this season, with
a 23-9 record and the Orioles
had hoped he could neutralize
Pittsburgh's left-handed hitters
— Omar Moreno, Willie
Stargell and Dave Parker. The
Pirates had switched to right
handed swingers Bill Robinson
in left field and Steve Nicosia
catching, in place of left
handers John Milner and Ed
Ott.
The Orioles sought to get
more left-handed strength in
their lineup against Kison by
inserting Billy Smith at second
base in place of Rich Dauerand
|ohn Lowenstein in left field in
place of Gary Roenicke.
Baltimore Manager Earl
Weaver, who previously had
announced |im Palmer and
Scott McGregor as the starting
pitchers for Games Two and
Three, said right-hander De
nnis Martinez would start
Game Four in Pittsburgh on
Saturday.
Chuck Tanner, manager of
the Pirates, said his club would
stay with Bert Blyleven as the
starter for Game Two. He is ex
pected to start left-hander John
Candeleria in Came Three and
right-hander ]im Bibby in the
fourth game.
