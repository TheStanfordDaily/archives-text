Eru Nyberg put the Pioneers
out in front on an assist by
George Fernandez li minutes
into the game. Both teams then

the Cards posing the more
serious threats. With four mi

"We were very fortunate,

Hayward head coach Colin

close games, like Stanford did
today.
"Stanford had an off day and
we were fortunate to sc ore two

"We were unlucky," said
Card head coach Nelson
Lodge. "There were live shots

the game — you have to over
look unlucky things."
With the Cards' record
dropping to 7-1-1 at the hands
ot 5-7-2 Hayward, their sixth

place ranking in the West
could be in jeopardy.
"The loss could alfec I the rat

said. "We could be out ol the

"We were very fortunate,

luck, that unpredictable
element capable of waylaying
the best of plans, proved to be
the decisive (actor in yester
day's soccer mate hup between
Stanford and Cal State-
Hayward. The Pioneers headed
hat k ac ross the Bay riding high
on a 2-1 upset victory that
snaps the C ardinals' eight
game unbeaten streak.
In any athletic event, certain
factors are given: the players'
skills, the opponent's
strengths and weaknesses and
the coaching staff's game
knowledge. These cogs are
linely intermeshed, but can
jam instantly with the monkey
wrench of I uc k.
Eru Nyberg put the Pioneers
out in front on an assist by
George Fernandez li minutes
into the game. Both teams then
traded offensive thrusts, with
the Cards posing the more
serious threats. With four mi
nutes remaining in the first
half, Willie Guicce took .1 pass
from l aird Cagan and put in a
shot to tie the mate h.
The ( ards had momentum in
their tavor and it looked like
taking the lead was well
within range as they altac ked
the Pioneer goal area.
