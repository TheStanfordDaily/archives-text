The University will attempt to stop
Timm Williams from entering the
playing field as Chief Lightfoot dur
ing football games, Dean of Student
Affairs lames Lyons said Monday
night.
Addressing a group of native
Americans here, Lyons said this did
not happen Saturday during the
UCLA game only because Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig and Director of Police
Services Marvin Herrington wished
to avoid a possible physical confron
tation between security guards and
Williams' supporters.
It was Rosenzweig and Herrington
who authorized the security guards
to admit Williams without a pass to
the playing field.
Lyons also told the group that he
had sent intormation to the Univer
sity of Southern California explaining
to them why the University does not
want Williams to appear as Chief
Lightfoot on the playing field this

Saturday at the football game in Los
Angeles.
"We have made it abundantly clear
that no matter what credentials he
presents to get on the field, they are
not valid," said Lyons.
According to Lyons, there was a
clear threat of a confrontation bet
ween the security force and the
dozen men who accompanied the
native American onto the playing
field Saturday.
There was also a threat of violence
from a group of persons "who had
been identified as potentially
dangerous early in the second quar
ter," said Lyons. The group had been
drinking and there was some worry
that they would interfere in security
efforts to keep Williams and his sup
porters off the playing field, he said.
"We were also very anxious not to
make a martyr out of Lightfoot,"
Lyons said of the 55-year-old Eureka
attorney who defied President
Richard Lyman's decision to never
again let an Indian perform on Stan
ford's field.
Williams had served as the Univer
sity's symbol from 1951 to 1972 when
it was decided that the use of the
Indian or of any race as a mascot was
inappropriate.
"By making Lightfoot a martyr, we
would be changing the issue. We
have already won the issue," said
Lyons.
'Threatened'
Stanford Band Manager Randy
Devol said at the meeting that Wil
liams' supporters "threatened" As
sistant Band Manager Bruce Heiman
alter the UCLA football game,
thereby convincing him to'allow Wil
liams to dance unhindered as the
Band played the "fanfare."
Devol denied any Band support for
the Indian mascot.
"We want the Trees," he said.
Earlier in the meeting, Curt Wil

son, another Band member, ex
tended an apology to native Ameri
cans tor any misunderstanding re
garding the playing of the "thunder
chicken" fanfare for Lightfoot.
"We were recording an album and
the theme was the old songs vs. the
new songs." Wilson said the songs
had been picked prior to the game
and that the "thunder-chicken" song
was not inserted especially for Wil
liams.
Lyons said that the University will
not specifically say what it will do if
Williams tries to return to the field as
Chief Lightfoot. "It will result in a
judgment situation between the
Chief and the security torce," said
Lyons. He added that they would
continue to be concerned about av
oiding another physical confronta
tion.
More resistance
However, Lyons did say that if Wil
liams shows up at future games, as
Chief Lightfoot, he will be con
fronted before he reaches the field
and"it will be made clear that he is
not wanted." He also promised,
"Next time we'll try to insure that
nothing is overlooked. There will be
tar more resistance to entry."
One student who attended the
meeting offered a perspective from
the black community on the issue:
"The members of the black com
munity who I've talked to are behind
you," Deanna Christmas told the na
tive Americans. "This is a human
rights issue on the whole. If we allow
the University to sidestep one minor
ity issue, they will sidestep other
minority issues."
Christmas also suggested to the
group that they adopt support for
one of the other mascots, Trees,
Cardinals or Griffons.
"As long as the University does not
adopt a mascot, it just gives the
alums who want the Indian some
thing to attack the freshmen with,"
