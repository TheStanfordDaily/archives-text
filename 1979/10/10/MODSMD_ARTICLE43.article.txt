# A 						House & Senate divided

Washington (AP) — As the
leaves begin to turn color and
the nights grow nippy, con
gressional tempers are getting
short.
No one is sure why nastiness
seems to creep into House and
Senate debates this time of
year.
In even-numbered years,
October signals the approach
of Election Day when voters
tend to display an unpleasant
ability to recall the wrong
votes, the embarrassing
speeches. But in odd
numbered years like this one,
when no one is up for re
election, the October bias are
harder to understand.
Whatever the reason, this
year is proving one of the tes
tiest in memory.
The House and Senate are at
war over the congressional pay

issue. And when they're not
saying nasty things about the
House, senators are snapping
at each other.
The strongest Senate "rule"
is the elaborate courtesy
members display toward one
another. The favored form of
address is "the distinguished
senator from wherever" —
even if the speaker thinks his
colleague's only distinguishing
characteristic is his abysmal ig
norance.
Once again, Goldwater and
Byrd tossed aside pretensions
at politeness when Byrd
wanted permission to offer an
amendment to the pay raise
bill, a move that could be
blocked by the objection of
any senator.
"I object," said Goldwater,

while Byrd was in mid
sentence.
"Will the senator allow me to
finish?" asked the majority
leader.
"I do not have to explain it,"
replied Goldwater. "I object."
On yet another occasion, Byrd
clashed with Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), over the difference
between "implied" and "infer
red."
"You are saying I implied
something," said Helms. "I
implied nothing. I stated facts
and conclusions. The senator
can infer anything he pleases.
There is a difference between
implied and inferred."
"I learned that in high
school," said Byrd.
"It does not show," retorted
Helms.
