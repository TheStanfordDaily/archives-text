# 'ASSU is alive'
## COP seeks to revamp student services 
### Eileen Delehanty 
"ASSU is alive, and the more
people we get involved, the
better it will be," Tom Gart, a
member of this year's Council
of Presidents (COP) said after
his first two weeks in office.
Cart and co-presidents Sibby
Freeman, Mary Leßlanc and
Laura Mead, comprise "the
executive branch" of the ASSU
government, according to
Meade.
COP originated in the early
1970s when the constitution
was revised. The team was
created to balance the student
senate, carry out policy and act
as lobbyists for student causes.
"One person obviously
couldn't do all that we do . . .
he'd go crazy," Gart said.
Elected last spring on a plat
form of revitalizing the role of
the COP, the four said they
represent renewed interest in
student services on campus.
One of the services planned
by the presidents includes
opening up student govern
ment to the whole campus by
scheduling sherry hours at
dorms to inform freshmen and
upperclassmen of oppor
tunities open to them to affect
policy.
"We have 130 spots on vari
ous committees and boards
open every year, and some are
still unfilled," Mead, a junior
majoring in human biology,
emphasized.
Another plan to open up
student government is the

COP's "ASSU is ALIVE" cam
paign. "It (the campaign) is a
way to make everyone realize
the ASSU does exist, and is
doing something," Gard said.
Orientivities night — an
exhibition of the extracurricu
lar activities available here —
kicked off the campaign. The
presidents plan also to print up
T-shirts bearing the "ASSU is
ALIVE" slogan.
The four agreed that an im
portant function of the coun
cil, and of ASSU as a whole, is
to offer services which the ad
ministration either cannot, or
will not, provide. Such services
include lecture notes, re
frigerator and recycling ser
vices and the Sunday Flicks.
However, initiating and pro
viding such services can prove
challenging and time
consuming, they said. COP
members said they spend an
average of 40 hours per week in
or around the ASSU office. "A
day doesn't go by when we're
not in the office," Gart said.
In response to being termed
"aspiring politicos," the group
agreed with Mary Leßlanc, who
said: "Anyone running has as
pirations politically. But we
have other interests besides
having a name on a desk."
"There's an easier way to get
in the limelight than by being
on the COP," Mead added.
Sibby Freeman, 30, a graduate
student, said, "We come to
this work with a passion ... to
do our job."

Gart, a former senator, said
COP tries to work with the
ASSU Senate to improve prob
lems on campus. Mead,
likened the COP to the execu
tive branch of government,
adding that the ASSU Senate
serves as the legislative body.
The COP also hopes to re
vitalize their role as lobbyists
for student causes and prob
lems. "We are here tor the stu
dents who want to see things
get done, Freeman said.
A special interest group on
campus went to the COP with a
problem.

"They wanted Jorge Palacios
from Chili to come to speak
and the government wouldn't
grant a visa to him," explained
Mead . The COP wrote a letter
to the government urging
them to allow the Chilean into
the U.S. The speaker was later
granted a visa.
"We came here with big
plans," said Meade. And yet, it
is obvious that there will be
considerable frustration in
keeping up with the work. "It is
an up hill battle to stay where
you were yesterday," Freeman
said.
