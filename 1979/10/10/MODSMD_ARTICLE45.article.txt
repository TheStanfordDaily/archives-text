San Francisco (AP) â€” Incum
bent Dianne Feinstein holds a
comfortable lead over challen
gers Quentin Kopp and David
Scott in the city's mayoralty
race, a television poll reported
Monday.
Forty-five percent of voters
in the survey said they would
vote to reelect Feinstein, while
20 percent favored Supervisor
Kopp, 6 percent chose Scott, a
realtor; 1 percent opted for
"other" candidates and 27 per
cent were undecided, accord
ing to the poll commissioned
by NBC affiliate KRON-TV.
The poll was conducted by
Steve Teichner and Associates.
Feinstein need only capture
5 percent of the undecided
voters to win reelection in the
primary next month, the poll

indicated.
The mayor handily racked up
a compelling 98 percent on the
name recognition question,
while only 68 percent could
identify the political veteran,
Kopp, as a candidate and only
15 percent knew Scott was
running.
The public's awareness of
Feinstein stems not only from
her incumbency but also from
her high visibility as mayor in
the aftermath of last year's
murder of her predecessor,
George Moscone, the station
noted.
Scott and Kopp are generat
ing little public interest, and
Feinstein has declined to cam
paign vigorously, choosing in
stead to emphasize her role as
mayor, the station said.
