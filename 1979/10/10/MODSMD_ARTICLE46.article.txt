Stock market takes nosedive
New York — The stock market took its
steepest drop in more than five years yesterday
in a day-long slide blamed on spiraling interest
rates and fears of a deepening recession.
Bank stocks, savings and loans and other
financial issues came under particular pres
sure amid fears of a credit squeeze.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
26.45 to 857.59, marking its largest loss since it
tumbled 26.99 [joints on Jan. 9, 1974, in the
midst of the last recession and the Arab oil
embargo.
I he record decline was 38.33 points on Oct.
28, 1929, during the Great Crash that preceded
the Depression.
The daily (ount on the New York Stock Ex
change showed the most one-sided tally in
modern memory, wifh 1768 declines and only
73 stocks gaining ground.
Big Board volume came to a 55.56 million
shares, the heaviest total this year and the
fourth largest ever at the exchange.
The apparent catalyst for the selloff was the
dec ision by many of the nation's banks to raise
their prime lending rates from 1 V/t to 14Vt. The
unprecedented increase of a full percentage
point, which followed new credit-tightuning
moves by the Federal Reserve over the
weekend, came as a shock to many Wall
Streeters. Analysts said interest rates had been
expected to rise, but not so rapidly.
Among the 30 big-name stocks in the Dow
(ones industrial average, 19 posted losses of a
point or more.
The NYSE's composite common-stock index
dropped 2.05 to 60.5 5.

Plane forces U.N. evacuation
New York — A publicity-seeking author in a
light plane circled the United Nations'
neighborhood for more than three hours yes
terday, prompting the evacuation of
thousands from two U.N. buildings and the
offices of his publisher.
Alarm swept the area as crowds on the
streets below watched the plane wheel about
at relatively low altitude. Emergency apparatus
streamed into the East Side area in anticipation
of a possible crash.
But the pilot, Robert Baudin, 61, author of an
autobiography, landed his plane after V/i
hours at LaGuardia Airport a few moments fly
ing time away.
His pilot's license was immediately
lifted and he was charged with aggravated
harassment, which is punishable by no more
than a year in jail.
Baudin was also charged in federal court
with extortion in interstate commerce — illeg
ally seeking gain through a flight across state
lines. That charge carries a maximum penalty
of 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
He was jailed at the Federal Correctional
Center in Lower Manhattan, to await a bail
heating today before a U.S. magistrate.
Jailed sniper commits suicide
San Franc isco — Civic Center sniper Wayne
Cullinane killed himself in his jail cell before
dawn yesterday, three days after he terrorized
San Francisco with random shooting in a 23-
hour siege.
The lifeless body of the 22-year-old Rhode
Island native was discovered shortly after 6:30
a.m., dangling from a strip of bedsheet tied off
on the highest bars of his cell, according to the
sheriff's department.
Sherilf Eugene Brown, appearing nervous,
told a news conference Cullinane was last
checked at 15 a.m. or 3:30 a.m., some three
hours before discovery of the body. Brown's
departmental policy is that inmates get
checked every hour. Brown dodged repeated
questions on why Cullinane wasn't c hecked
hourly. As sheriff, Brown is responsible for jail
security.
Brown said Ins psychiatric team had decided
that Cullinane "was not suicidal." He said he

did not believe any departmental negligence
was involved in the suicide "so far."
Police said Cullinane's maximum security
isolation cell was around the corner from a
medical station. The cell, they said, was not
visible without walking at least 10 yards down a
corridor.
Cullinane had been due for arraignment
today on nine charges including kidnapping,
robbery and assault with a deadly weapon — a
.30 caliber carbine. He had been held on
$500,000 bail.
Baez begins Indochina tour
Hong Kong — American folk singer )oan Baez
embarked yesterday on a tour through In
dochinese refugee camps to study firsthand
what she called the "massive form of holocaust
going on" in Southeast Asia. She said she
doesn't care what actress Jane Fonda thinks
about her.
The folk singer, who has recently de
nounced Hanoi for expelling ethnic Chinese,
has been criticized for those statements by
Fonda and other members of the Far Left.
She said she wasn't making the trip to prove
to her critics that she was right in circulating an
open letter criticizing the Hanoi regime.
She said she had been invited to make a
return trip to Hanoi, which she visited as an
anti-war crusader in 1972. "But I think it's the
wrong place to go to find out things the gov
ernment probably doesn't want me nosing
into."
Following visits with the refugees, Baez said
she will take a swing through Europe to meet
with leaders of the "New Lett" there, including
French author )ean-Paul Sartre.
Court to study trial exclusions
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to study how much discretion
judges have in deciding to exclude the public
and press from criminal trials.
The justices said they will review a Hanover,
Va., case that could clarify the contusion
caused for lower courts nationwide by the
Supreme Court's courtroom-access decision
last July.
Arguments in the Virginia case likely will be
heard in lanuary. But the justices left open the
possibility that, after hearing the arguments,
they might not rule on the central issue.
To reach and decide the case's merits, the
justices first must rule that they have jurisdic
tion to do so.
The new case was brought to the court by
lawyers representing two Richmond, Va.,
newspaper reporters who were ousted from a

murder trial in Hanover last September.
At the trial's start, judge Richard Taylor
granted a defense lawyer's request and cleared
the courtroom of all spectators. Prosecutors
voiced no objection, and Taylor cited a specific
Virginia law that gave him the authority to take
such action.
The Virginia Supreme Court last July 9 up
held the trial judge's action.

United Nations — Cuban President Fidel Cas
tro is expected to reach New York today, ac
companied by more than 200 other Cubans, a
source at the U.S. United Nations mission said
yesterday.

said a planeload of Cubans, was due in New
York last night and another today but there was
no telling which plane Castro would be on.
U.S. visas have been issued to 211 Cubans, the
source said.
Cuban Ambassador Raul Roa Kouri, asked
when Castro was coming, said he knew only
that Castro would be here between today and
Friday.
Castro is expected to address the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly and a group of non-aligned na
tions at the United Nations.

San Francisco — Bob Dylan, hitting the road

"Slow Train Coming," will begin a new na

here for rock promoter Bill Graham.

backed by an I l-piece band during his con
certs Nov. 1 to 8, at the Warfield Theater in
downtown San Francisco.

in the city since the fabled Winterland au
ditorium closed last New Year's Fve.

were made aware of the availability of the facil

a suggestion . . . and he accepted.
