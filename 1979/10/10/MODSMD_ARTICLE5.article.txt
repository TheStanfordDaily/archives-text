# City Council to hear presentation
## Proposed faculty housing up for debate 
### Andrea James 
Detailed plans for a 140-unit faculty
housing complex on Peter Coutts
Hill near Stanford Industrial Park will
be presented to the Palo Alto City
Council next week.
The proposed project, planned for
the 20-acre spot of open land just off
Page Mill Road, was approved by the
Palo Alto Planning Commission last
week. It must still be reviewed and
accepted by the city council and sev
eral Santa Clara County boards.
Many Palo Alto residents, how
ever, want to keep the site free so it
can be used as a municipal park. The
project has been redesigned seven
times to try to satisfy local resi
dents' wishes for as much open
space as possible, Bob Summers,
manager of faculty/staff housing,
said.
Architects' plans have ranged from
a 140-unit subdivision of con
dominiums, duplexes and single
family houses to the present 10
multi-unit clusters of two- and
three-story apartment buildings.
This latest plan keeps the top of
Peter Coutts Hill free of develop
ment and allows for open spaces be
tween the main streets and the hous
ing clusters.
Done in mid-1980s
Summers said he expects the pro
ject will be completed in the mid
1980s if it is received favorably by all
agencies.
Peter Coutts Hill is now used as a
picnic and hiking spot for local resi
dents.
"There's really not much activity
there," Summers said.
The project has caused a conflict
between the University and the Col
lege Terrace Residents' Association.
The College Terrace subdivision is
adjacent to Peter Coutts Hill.
Leave hill open
"We want the hili left open," said
lames Culpepper, president of the
association. "The best place for Stan
ford to build would be right along
Peter Coutts Road, but that wouldn't
produce as many units."
Only 80 units could be developed
at that spot, not nearly enough to
satisfy Stanford's need, Summers
said.
The University has been ex
periencing a severe faculty housing
shortage that has deterred some
prospective senior faculty members
from coming to Stanford.
Hindered living
President Richard Lyman told the
Academic Council last week that the
housing shortage on the Peninsula,

combined with the high (ost of hous
ing in the area, has been the major
factor in impeding recruitment to the
University.
"This is especially true in cases
where professors would have to move
here from places where real estate
values are not as high," said Vice
Provost Bliss Carnochan. "They can't
easily make the transition."
The single-family units will range

in size from 1000 to 2000 square feet.
The largest units have three bed
rooms and a studio.
Costs to faculty will range from
$100,000 to $200,000, but special
financing will be made available,
Summers said.
Will protest
Culpepper and several other as
sociation members are expected to
attend Monday night's city council

meeting to protest the development.
Association members have met
with the University several times
over the summer to discuss the pro
ject. Already, the University has
spent $25,000 revising the designs,
Summers said.
"Although there have been some
major disagreements, the meetings
have been very amicable and pro
ductive," said Culpepper.
