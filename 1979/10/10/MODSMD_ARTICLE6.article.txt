"That looks just like my four
year-old's first crayon drawing!"
"It reminds me of an exhibit I
saw at the Guggenheim Museum
when we were in New York last
month."
These comments were made by
some admirers of a painting by a
six-year-old Japanese boy that was
part of Bechtel International
Center's Kids' Art Display Sunday
afternoon.
The exhibit, which commemo
rated the United Nations' Interna
tional Year of the Child, featured
over 200 drawings and paintings
by children, aged three to 13,
trom 32 countries.
The works werefrom thecollec

tion of Rhoda Kellogg, 82, who
served for 20 years as the director
of the Golden Gate Kindergarten
Association. The association, in its
100 th year, was co-founded by
lane Lathrop Stanford.
Kellogg, who has written four
books on the development and
psychological motivation of the
young artist, explained the univ
ersality of children's art.
"Most young children draw
shapes that seem visually pleas
ing instead of trying to create an
accurate representation of their
subject," she said. "Therefore,
most art of children 10 and under
who haven't yet been affected by
a national culture has definite
similarities."

These similarities stem from the
child's motivation to draw, she
said. "Some use drawing as an
outlet for their motor skills while
other children seek a psychologi
cal salvation in art," Kellogg
explained.
Kellogg sees some differences
developing between the art of
American children and that of
children from other nations. She
said American children might be
losing some of their artistic origi
nality.
"Television and the commer
cialization of primary education
may be robbing our children of
some of their natural creativity,"
she said.
