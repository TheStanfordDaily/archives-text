## Rhodesian peace hits critical hour 
### 
London (AP) — Britain yes
terday gave the guerillas at the
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia peace
talks 48 hours to change their
minds and accept a com
promise constitution for inde
pendence.
The future of the five-week
old conference hung in the ba
lance as the Patriotic Front
guerrilla alliance responded
that the British demand was
"absurd," reiterated its objec
tions to key areas of the con
stitution and said it could give
no final verdict until all sides
agreed on who will control the
government and the guns dur
ing a transition to British
granted independence.
Lord Carrington made the
demand yesterday as the
Patriotic Front and ine oppos
ing delegation led by
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia Prime
Minister Abel Muzorewa faced
each other again at the Lancas
ter FHouse conference center
after four weeks of constitu
tional argument. Muzorewa
has already accepted the
British draft.
The foreign secretary did not
say what he would do if the
guerrillas did not respond in
the allotted time.
Fie ruled out any more
negotiation on the British draft
and said the conference could
not move on to discuss transi
tion arrangements unless the
Patriotic Front gave a definitive
answer on the constitution
when the talks resume tomor
row morning.
'Spirits' clash
Patriotic Front co-leader
Joshua Nkomo urged that the
"spirit of discussion" should
continue, and Carrington re
plied "There comes a time
when the spirit of decision
must take over," officials re

ported after the 30-minute
closed-door session.
Britain has insisted from the
start a constitution must be
finalized first if this latest bid to
end the seven-year-old war
and bring an internationally
acceptable black government
to the nation of seven million
blacks and 230,000 whites is to
have any hope of success.
Carrington has ruled that
constitutional agreement will
fall away if the two sides cannot
also agree on the second
agenda item — setting up a
transition administration and
arrangements for British
supervised elections.
Deadlock
Unless either Carrington or
the Patriotic Front backs off its
stand tomorrow, deadlock
seems inevitable.
Carrington will address the
annual convention of the gov
erning Conservative Party to
day, where right-wing legis
lators are pressing for quick
recognition of Muzorewa and
an end to sanctions imposed
against the previous white
minority government.
The Patriotic Front's objec
tions to the British draft center
on strict property, pension and
citizenship rights entrenched
for 10 years in a bill of rights,
which they maintain preserves
white-minority privilege.
