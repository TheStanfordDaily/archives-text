Vatican City (AP) — A tired
Pope John Paul II returned
from a nine-day tour of Ireland
and the United States on Mon
day to the cheers of thousands
waving white handkerchiefs in

sun-baked St. Peter's Square.
The pontiff hinted that he
would like to return some day,
saying he wants "more direct
and familiar contact" with the
American people.
Five hours after his return to
the Vatican, the 59-year-old
pontiff flew to Castel Gandolfo
to rest in the seclusion of the
papal estates in the Alban Hills
30 miles south of Rome. A Vati
can spokesman said he will re
turn Wednesday for his gen
eral audience.
Pope |ohn Paul completing a
historic 10,711-mile tour, was
greeted by Italian Premier
Francesco Cossiga and Rome's
Communist Mayor Luigi Pet
roselli when he stepped off his
TWA jetliner Shepherd I from
Washington.
'Great country'
The pope called the United
States a "great country to
which certainly corresponds
an immense role and a great
responsibility — because of its
high level of welfare and tech
nical progress — in the con
struction of a just world worthy
of man."
The pontiff, who was wel
comed by enormous, en
thusiastic crowds during his
tour of six American cities,

added "the devoted and exul
tant welcome of the faithful
and of the entire people of the
United States has left in my
soul the desire for a more di
rect and familiar contact with
these very dear children."
Before leaving, the pope ex
pressed regret that his
schedule had to be limited to
Boston, New York, Philadel
phia, Des Moines, lowa,
Chicago and Washington and
said he would like to return to
visit other parts of the country.
Phillipines next
Asked about future travel
plans, Chief Vatican spokes
man Rev. Romeo Panciroli said
John Paul's next trip would be
to the Philippines but that it
would not be this year.
The pope's final day in the
United States was marked by
controversy when a leader of
America's Roman Catholic
nuns appealed to John Paul to
admit women to "all ministries
of our church.''
In an apparent effort to em
phasize remarks the pope
made extolling the Virgin
Mary, the Vatican released a
text of his speech to nuns given
on Monday.
