That cocky grin is typical Tom. That's how he looked
when I told him he'd made the varsity his first year at
Annapolis. Then we learned Tom had 3 months to live. That
was 5 years ago.
George Welshâ€”Head Coach, USNA Football
It was hard to believe a boy like Tom Harper could
be so desperately ill. Or that anyone could fight so hard
to live. When he was under treatment and so weak he
could hardly walk, Tom still came to practice. He'd marked
out his own program for survival. To get back in shape
and somehow speed the recovery he never lost hope
would come.
For Tom it wasn't too late. Something new called
combination chemotherapy was just beginning to be used.
There are almost 2 million Americans like Tom who've
beaten cancer.
But for many patients just as determined and
hopeful, the treatments that could save them have not yet
been found. That's why the American Cancer Society is
asking for your support. Through research, rehabilitation
and education, they're making your contributions count.
