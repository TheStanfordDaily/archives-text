# Frats won't be evicted

The University's 13 fraternities will
each remain on campus for another
year, according to preliminary re
sults of the just-completed rushing
season.
"No house is in immediate
danger," said Assistant Director of
Residential Education Diana Conklin
yesterday. Theta Xi, which missed its
quotas the past two years, reached its
quota of "sophomore equivalents"
last week and "is fine and out of
danger," she confirmed.
Conklin emphasized that the cur
rent figures were only tentative. The
official status of the fraternities will
not be announced until next week.
Conklin said she received all final
rush cards Friday but is still in the
process of "checking and re
checking" their accuracy and valid
ity.
"I don't know for sure. Either the
fraternity system as a whole made its
quota (240) on the nose, or it is one
(equivalent point) short. It's just a
motion away, but I won't release the
news until I am positive that every
card is triple-checked," she added.
A "sophomore equivalent" is a
student who is entitled to, but has
not yet used his two years of guaran
teed housing, according to Universi
ty fraternity regulations. The pre
sent fraternity quota system was de
signed in 1975 to ensure that frater
nities would bear their appropriate
share of the housing burden.
Fraternities choose their own resi
dents and, thus, function separately
from the Housing Draw to which
other on-campus students are sub
jected.
A fraternity may, however, be
considered for placement in to the
Draw system should it haplessly
either fail to meet its quota for three
consecutive years or be the fraternity
with the largest share deficit if the
entire system misses the mark for
two successive years.
Since the 1975 inception of the
plan, no fraternity has been forced to
enter the Draw. That record has been
attained narrowly.
The fraternity system overall fell
short of its allotment in 1975, 1977
and 1978. Several individual frater-
" * In- '
nities have consistently failed to
achieve their quotas as well.
"This looks to me like the best year
the system's ever had since 1975 as
far as quotas go," Conklin said. "The
ideal is to hit (the quota) right on the
nose or be a half-point above," she
explained. "It's a lot like a bull's
eye."
By greatly exceeding its quota, a
fraternity or the whole system would
suffer the following year from lack of
adequate space.
Since June, Theta Xi gained three
"sophomore equivalents" or six
members each possessing a half
point (one year left of guaranteed
housing) to fill its 12.5 quota. In fact,
the fraternity captured three pledges
Thursday night, according to house
president Bill Boone.
"We were sweating, but we we
ren't panicking," he said. He attri
buted the fraternity's scarce rush
to"a massive flux ol members over
seas" last spring. Rush procedures
were severely hampered by the pre
sence of only eight members in the
house at that time, he said.
