# China markets old herbal remedies

Peking (AP) — The state-run phar
maceutical houses in the People's Repub
lic of China are fast catching up to our
pill-popping Western society in packaging
ancient herbal remedies as patent
medicines, available in capsule and liquid.
A modern and always crowded drug
counter in the lobby of the capacious Pek
ing Hotel does a bustling business, dis
pensing ginseng antler pills, swallow pear
nest syrup, dog skin plaster, tiger bone
liquor and similar tonics and emulsions
that have brought relief to billions since
the Ming dynasty.
In the downtown business district a
much larger and far more lavish People's
Drug Store, unrelated to the Washington,
D.C., chain of the same name, carries a full
line of aphrodisiacs, emetics, expector
ants, "mind refreshers" and something
called "Purple Cold Cubes," which, ac
cording to the label, is good for "sore
throat, toothache, abdominal flatulence,
food and drink poisoning and di irrhea."
The downtown drug emporium is al

ways jammed with middle-aged Peking
citizens who worry constantly about heart
palpitations and flatulence the way the
French go on about their livers and the
Americans count calories.
The lobby drug Store, restricted to
foreigners like the hotel itself, caters in
constant chaos to the hypochondria of the
overseas Chinese, mostly from Hawaii,
Hong Kong and Singapore and the various
Chinatowns from London and New York
to Augusta, Ga., and San Francisco, who
can outscore the home team when it
comes to worrying about intestinal gas and
a fluctuating pulse rate.
The Chinese medicine men have
learned to pander to the fevers and chills
of their large pill-purchasing population
with catchy slogans and portentous prose
that seems to owe a lot to aspirin in com
mercials on American TV.
"At the first sign of a cold or abdominal
flatulence take anti-pestilence Kan Mao
Tao," advises an ad for an ancient herbal
remedy in a slick patent medicine

catalogue.
Next to a full-page color photo of .
satisfied-looking tiger, the makers of Hi
Ku Chien — "Tiger Bone Medicatec
Liquor" — attest that it is "most effective ir
relieving flatulence and assuaging pains
promoting blood circulation and relieving
sinews, having won great popularity frorr
users at home and abroad."
China apparently has a pure food anc
drug law requiring full disclosure of the
ingredients on the label.
The Tiger Bone Liquor, for instance, dis
closes in the small print that it is "refined
by infusing tiger bones and various kinds
of precious Chinese medical herbs in
top-grade mellow sorghum wine. Ingre
dients: Kaquang wine 77.1 percent, sugar
10.4 percent, tiger bone extract 12.5 per
cent."
Our Chinese guides were unable to as
certain how many tiger herds had to be
boiled up annually to promote blood cir
culation and abate flatulency in a nation of
900 million.
