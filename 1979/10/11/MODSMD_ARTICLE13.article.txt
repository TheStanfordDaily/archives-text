# Various search services available
## Computer eases research blues 
### Lisa Adler 
Researchers, tired after spending hours
searching through the many libraries here for
data, may find some relief in an expanding com
puterized research service that can readily bring
much-needed information to their fingertips.
The service, in existence here for 10 years,
facilitates fast and thorough searches of indexes
and abstracts found in many large libraries and
produces a list of sources for information on the
topic being researched.
According to Harry Hull, mathematics libra
rian and search coordinator in the math and
computer science department, the searches
range in price between $15 and $35, depending
on the data base, and contain, on the average,
between 50 and 125 references.
Fees for computer time are "passed on to the
person wanting the search," whether or not any
information is found, Hull said.
Library display
This particular service is available through the
following libraries: biology, business, chemis
try, education, engineering, medicine,
mathematics and computer science, music and
Green Library. A display now located in the
lobby of Green Library explains the com
puterized search process.
Though Llull agreed that the computerized
search is geared more toward the researcher
and the graduate student, the undergraduate is
by no means excluded from the service.
Susan ]urow, a librarian at Green Library, said,
"The computer data-base search is especially
useful when researching cross topics" and two
related subjects.
"But if the topic is fairly simple and not in
volved. the manual method may be the best,"

she said.
"This method of locating resources is a tool,"
Jurow acknowledged, "because it saves time
and provides certain information otherwise dif
ficult to obtain manually."
Search librarians discuss a proposed research
topic with persons wanting to use the system
and develop a search strategy for each re
searcher, Jurow said.
A quick telephone call to Lockheed Missiles
and Space Company in Sunnyvale hooks up the
computer with the Stanford terminals. The topic
is typed in and the computer reads out the vari
ous "hits" â€” citations of articles on the desired
topic. A printout of the citations is available to
users of the system.
Jurow and Llull point out the importance of
"not limiting ourselves to certain words defin
ing our topics and not to limit ourselves to dis
tinct usages of the computer."
Demonstrations given
Demonstrations of the computer data-base
searching procedure will be given in Meyer Lib
rary's Forum Room on Oct. 15 at 3:30 p.m.; Oct.
16 at 9:30 a.m.; Oct. 24 at 2:30 p.m.; and Oct. 25
at 9:30 a.m. The sciences will be having general
demonstrations. Llull encouraged anyone in
terested to call the science libraries for more
information.
The computer system is operated through
Lockheed Corporation in the Industrial Park
here. A data-base language called Dialog is the
most commonly used, but there are 103 prog
rams to choose from.
According to Jurow, there are 11 other data
base search librarians in the various campus lib
raiies and at least two others at the medical
center.
