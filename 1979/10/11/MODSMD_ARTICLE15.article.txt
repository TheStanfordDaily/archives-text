## Karen Koman Raise feminist awareness 
### 
All my life I've avoided the label of "feminist,"
surrounding it with vagueness and qualifiers.
Common statements of mine were "I'm not re
ally, but I believe that women should be equal to
men." Or "I believe in feminism, but (quick
insert) I don't hate men." With all the sen
sationalist stories that filled my city's (St. Louis)
papers on bra-burning and lesbian marriage,
one had tocarefullyavoidextremist statements.
The dignity of the term "feminism" was bes
mirched by the jocular label of "women's lib,"
while Phyllis Schafley and Marabel Morgan
mounted a determined attack on the move
ment.
The former hired a maid/housekeeper so that
she could better pursue her political interests,
all the while telling women that their place was
in the home, and that they should be grateful
that their husbands deigned to support them.
Morgan hyped the Total Woman ethic, plac -
ing the blame for women's dissatisfaction with
our lot squarely on our own shoulders. She ad
vised meeting one's mate at the door, sheathed
in cellophane.
ERA misconceptions
Missouri, my home state, was one of the first
and most entrenched opponents of the Equal
Rights Amendment. I can understand why. My
friends bewailed its coming; ERA, they told me
patiently, would result in coed bathrooms and
women being drafted. If I knew what I know
now, I could have told them that these changes
were nothing that college like and Rep. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) wouldn't
bring anyway.
Instead I listened indulgently to them and to
my Catholic mother's gruesome discourses on
the potential outcome of liberalized abortion
rights and bided my time. College would offer
manifold opportunities to explore my latent
feminism, I figured.
Proud feminist
I decided last year to stop being a "closet
feminist" and start getting involved with wo
men's issues on campus. I had always felt that
since I was relatively confident and aggressive
that I didn't need to actively support any wo
men's causes or to be supported in return.
Instead ot feeling pigeon-holed or "dis

placed" by friends, usually male, who told me
that although I was a woman, I "thought like a
man," I was always inwardly pleased. "Thinking
like a man" seemed to bode well for success in
life.
Three years of plowing through academia
and the bucolic existence of the Farm had
left me with a tunnel vision that was only miti
gated by the light of potential success and status
at the end of the tunnel.
The title of the report of the Stanford Commit
tee on the Education and Employment of Wo
men, 1978, was "Even at Stanford, women often
see themselves as less able to compete . .
Some of their findings were:
1) Even though women on the record may be
equally qualified for a job which is open, they
are less likely to apply for it than men. And, the
more significant the position the less likely
women are to apply.
2) Women tend to be less aggressive in their
job-seeking efforts.
3)Women tend to exhibit less confidence in
themselves than men in the job interview. The
list goes on and on, and is very troubling to me.
There are a number of solutions that might be
applicable, many of which are outlined in the
Guide. However it seems to me that the changes
must come from within, and cannot be manipu
lated very successfully from external sources.
This column only partially charts my course on
the way to becominga fully actualized feminist. I
still have a long way to go. If reading this has
sensitized you to some of the problems facing
women at this university, good.
But if you still feel, as I did, that none of this
really applies to you, and that you're still going
to make it on your own, think about the last
time you were in a section for a class. Chances
are good that all the women around you were
quietly scrawling in their notebooks while the
men dominated the discussion.
Or think about that brilliant woman friend of
yours who graduated with honors in history last
year and is now scooping cookie dough at Mrs.
Fields.
Come on in. The water's not all that cold.
