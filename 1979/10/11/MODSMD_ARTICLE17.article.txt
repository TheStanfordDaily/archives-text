## Bring 'Chief' back onto the field 
### 
What would have been one
of the happiest moments in re
cent Stanford history — a 27-27
tie with UCLA last year — was
prevented by a missed extra
point.
That point-after-touchdown
might have been made if Timm
Williams, alias Chief, alias Pr
ince Lightfoot, had drawn the
Stanford crowd to their pre
-1972 normal fervor. No mascot,
no unity, no emotion, no PAT.
This logic, void of any fact, is
pure hindsight. The logic that
Chief and his presence is racist
is pure foresight. In my opin
ion, it is also faulty.
Before presenting this ar
gument however, I must com
ment on the Daily editorial of
Monday, Oct. 8. The Daily in
the past has never condemned
non-violent behavior or civil
disobedience in the name of
their own pet causes but now
seeks to deny that same action

to those of opposite views.
Furthermore, terming sup
porters of the "Bring Back
Chief Lightfoot" movement, a
"goon squad" is just as petty as
calling the 1960's de
monstrators "punks" and
"commie tags."
Besides that, in this "goon
squad" were numerous older
alumni and no one that looked
menacing. Of course, those
men wearing T-shirts were
much more destructive than
the proud and compassionate
people in the stands that threw
cans, ice and assorted garbage
at the Chief.
By not allowing the Chief on
the field, in fact the revocation
of the Indian as mascot, has of
fended many times more
people the Chief's appear
ance ever will. The loss of iden
tity by alumni, the loss of sup
port by the crowd and the loss

of unity at Stanford all as intan
gible as racism, can never be
measured.
The faulty application of ra
cism must now be considered.
Why is the name "Stanford In
dians" demeaning or offen
sive? I, as an Italian, would be
very proud to have the Stan
ford Italians win the Kose Bowl.
Unless some harm or pre
judice is fostered by the name,
racism is only the insecurity of
one's own mind. A "native
"American" or Indian has
never, to my knowledge, been
refused anything because his
ancestry is associated with a
sports team from a college or
otherwise.
Actually, prejudice is sup
pressed by the Indian mascot.
Why would so many people
want the Indian as a mascot un
less they would be proud to be
represented as such? Are "na

tive Americans" so superior
that being associated with "a
lien Americans" is insulting?
To be called something like
the Stanford urinals creates no
school pride. The Stanford In
dians, however, is totally re
spectable and many "Stanfor
dites" find pride in being
known as Indians. The Indian is
a source of pride and respecta
bility, not prejudice and de
gradation.
I hope the Stanford com
munity will expand its pressure
on the University to reverse its
hasty and misconceived deci
sion and reinstate the Indian as
the mascot. It compliments
and praises the minority group
here and everywhere. Allow
ing Chief Lightfoot on the field
is the first step and in many
ways the most important.
