## Environmental destruction ignored 
### 
Before I came to California,
I would run inside so that I
would not be eaten by the acid
rain or be able to see the smog
gnawing at my lungs. I would
drink my beer for the pure
water — it wasn't the murky
carbon tet drawn from the life
less river nearby.
Now that I'm in Mellowland,
I watch people worship the
sun. As in the rest of the coun
try, deep tans go well with plas
tic smiles at parties featuring
more pure water and state-of
the-art sound systems for
technological junkies.
As squadrons of aluminum
bicycles flash around me near
the Quad, someone does his
best to depopulate the Bay, the
southern beaches brace them

selves for an Ixtoc-like oil spill,
and the earth threatens to split
totakethe massof poisons into
its depths.
While we cram for our biol
ogy courses so that we can be
come compassionate doctors
or count the dollars an en
gineering position will bring,
out natural heritage falls victim
to our daily lives.
On the other side of the
Rockies, radioactive wastes
join the streams. Nuclear mis
haps of plant design or the
storage of wastes are nearly as
common as failures of the
lightbulbs and appliances they
are designed to feed.
We would all like to think
that we have nothing to do with
the destruction of natural
beauty.
Our society has distanced it
self from the surroundings that
fostered it. For many of us, our
common experience of nature
is a cultured beach or a low
class tourist trap.
Few of our livelihoods de
pend on direct contact with na
ture. There is usually a
machine, a building, a city or a
mass of people between us and
the land and water from which
we come. We have positioned
ourselves as masters of the
earth, with no need for natural
beauty.
The illusion of our self
sufficiency is broken only
when we cannot drink the wa
ter, when the rain doesn't
come or when we are in the
midst of an earthquake or hur
ricane.
We have created the illusion
of a world separated from
mountains, prairies, oceans
and forests. Our generation
likes to think that the buffer of
machines, luxuries and con
crete monuments is all that
exists, or at least all that mat
ters. Television soothes our
eyes and mind; technology
produces the sounds we hear

and the fibers that clothe us.
Our closest link with our wild
past — our food — has been so
distorted that we believe it is a
creation of man, too.
We have become indifferent
to the destruction of natural
beauty when we deny that we
are one or part of, as well as
responsible for, our total envi
ronment.
Our society must resist the
impulse to destroy our envi

ronment for the sake of im
mediate energy or material
needs. The heritage and
beauty we are preparing to
consume is much greater than
our own time or needs.
The images of the wilds cap
tured in empty photographs
are no substitute for what
exists; what we destroy is gone
forever.
