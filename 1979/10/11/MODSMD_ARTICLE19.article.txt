# Don't sing for war

### 
When I began to read David
Sartoris' column Oct. 10,
"Americans no longer sing the
national anthem," I was
pleased, thinking I'd be read
ing a complaint about the
UCLA fans singing (two bars
off) over Band Director Arthur
Barnes' version of the national
anthem.
Instead, the article conveyed
an attitude that is both very
dangerous and very sad. The
time for nationalism is past.
Physically and technologi
cally, we are one world.
Nationalism, uniting against
a "common enemy," means
one thing, war.
The words to our national
anthem are, in fact, warmon
gering. When sung by a crowd
of over 50)000, it becomes a
frightening demonstration of
how easily an attitude like Sar

toris' can still stir our blood.
Barnes' arrangement of the
anthem has made it a beautiful
piece of music, which we, as
Americans, can identify with in
terms of heritage. It is no
longer a ritual (similar in form
to 1984's "Two Minutes Hate")
to be sung before the
gladiators take the field.
The trumpet solo, which the
UCLA fans destroyed last
Saturday, is a particularly sin
cere and almost humble way to
begin the anthem. It has an en
tire stadium listening to one
small yet pure sound.
But the anthem is not the
important issue. The point is
perspective.
Don't say hello to your "fel
low American" on the bus; say
hello to your fellow human be
ing.
