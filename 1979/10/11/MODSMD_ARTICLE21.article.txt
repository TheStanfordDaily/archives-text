'Biased reporting'
I was appalled when I read
the Daily's coverage of Timm
Williams' reappearance as
Chief Lighttoot at the UCLA
game last Saturday. Such blat
antly biased reporting would
have been better suited to
grace the pages of Pravda or
Herr Goebbel's pronounce
ments than the Daily.
The Daily's editorial on this
topic contained a more accu
rate account of what really
happened on Saturday than
the news story did. Please
editorialize in the editorial
page and not in the news sec
tion. You do a great disservice
to your readers every time you
present a less-than-unbiased
presentation of the facts as
news.
I find the attitude of the Daily
and the native American
community at Stanford on this
subject to be depressing. The
Daily,which should be adam
antly against censorship in all
forms, advocates censorship of
Williams.
I do not understand what it is
about Williams' antics
which so infuriates the native
American community. Are they
ashamed of the reminder of a
(very small) part of the native
American history and culture?
I am proud that I can count
native Americans among my
ancestors, and I fail to see how
Williams insults that pride.
Perhaps only the full-blooded
understand.
If Williams is to be ban
ned from performing on the
grounds that his performance
is "racist," why then isn't there
an equal clamor to ban the Dol

lies (Cod forbid) on the
grounds that their perfor
mance "exploits women" and
is therefore "sexist?"
Why not ban the band too?
We'll find some excuse. And
while we're at it, let's ban the
football teams because foot
ball glorifies violence.
Or better yet, let's enjoy the
game and the entertainment,
and stop putting heavy political
significance into every aspect
of one's life and recreation.

Daily misses boat
Vou sure missed the boat in
your editorial on Chief Light
foot (Oct. 8). What's the matter
with you that you cannot dis
tinguish between cheers for
racism and cheers of reminis
cence and surprise at seeing
the old mascot after seven
years?
And as for your statement:
someone is dealing native
Americans "a direct slap in the
face" â€” let's be reasonable in
stead of dramatic.
Only a Cal space cadet still
considers the chief a serious
contender for mascot. As for
the alumni, they should be
able to reminisce without sca
thing reprisals from the Daily.

Daily censorship
Your editorial of Oct. 4,
"Apology for Ad," criticized
Dos Equis beer advertising and

further noted a change in Daily
ad policy. The change is that
the Daily will now review and
"censor" all ads before publi
cation.
Your editorial did not exp
lain why the ad should be of
fensive to us, and the editorial
contained several logical in
consistencies. Perhaps you
had tried to explain the of
fense, but couldn't find a
reasonable objection. Would
the ad have been less or more
offensive if it had portrayed the
Stanford Dollies?
I would applaud your new
review process if I felt you had
the wisdom to use it. Maybe in
the future, theDaily could trust
us Stanford students and other
readers to form our own
judgements, and to decide
whether, in light of advertising
image and "taste," Dos Equis
deserves our patronage.

Respect lacking
Pleas to "bring back Chief
Lightfoot" with a mature
perspective, so as to afford na
tive Americans a platform from
which toextol the virtues of the
native American race will cer
tainly fall on the deaf ears of
students in the cheering sec
tions of opposing universities.
For those who weren't
around in the pre-Cardinal
years to witness the "dig
nified" tribute afforded the In
dian mascot by rival cheering
sections, one need only note

the respect shown by the UCLA
student section for the Stan
ford Band's rendition of the na
tional anthem to comprehend
the lack of respect for mascots
and trademarks which is an in
evitable ingredient of any
inter-university rivalry.
I do not care to subject
members of the Stanford
community to such treatment.

Criticism unfair
Cameron Smith's reply to a
David Miller column {Daily,
Oct. 8) on Libertarian political
philosophy reveals a lack of
knowledge on that subject.
The letter implied that Liberta
rians support a "right" to pol
lute.
In fact, Libertarians view pol
lution as a violation of the
rights of others and contend
that government has allowed
pollution through court rulings
which have held that
technological advances are for
the "common good" even
though marred by pollution.
Also, the letter implies that
Libertarians support the
"right" to risk public safety
(i.e. nuclear power). In fact,
nuclear power plants have de
veloped as rapidly and riskily as
they have due to the Price-
Anderson Act which limited
their liability and underwrote
that liability with tax dollars;
prior to that act, nuclear plants
were considered uninsurable.
Libertarians want to repeal
that let power com

panies assume the responsibil
ity for their actions, even if that
means shutting down every
nuclear plant (an entire issue of
the Libertarian Review was de
voted to the subject recently).
As for the "right" to "con
sume resources wastefully
without regard to the long term
welfare of society," Liberta
rians contend that the free
market best serves society and
that the biggest waster of re
sources is the government and
its policies of artificially low
prices for scarce resources.
Finally, if Miller had in
tended to slant his question
naire "to favor the Libertarian
viewpoint by the choice of
questions," why would he in
clude the correct Libertarian
view that a businessman may
hire whom he chooses without
government interference?
Obviously he would have
gotten a better slant by avoid
ing this issue, particularly
when dealing with homosexu
als in the Bay Area which is a
stronghold of the gay rights
movement.
As a Libertarian I would sup
port a boycott of any business
which discriminates purely on
the basis of race, sex, religion,
political beliefs, ethnic origins
or sexual orientation.
The consumer has the right
not to patronize such estab
lishments, but Libertarians
contend that government has
no right to force a businessman
to hire any individual because
doing so violates the property
rights of the businessman.
