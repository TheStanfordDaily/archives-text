# Networks gear to youth
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — It was a
brilliant idea, deftly executed:
"Pop news" networks that
could deliver millions of young
rock station listeners to na
tional advertisers.
Central ABC's plan, when it
split its radio network in 1968,
was to supply youth-oriented
radio stations with soft-news
and lifestyle features.
While two of ABC's new
networks — ABC Information
and ABC Entertainment — con
tinued to broadcast news along
traditional lines, and the
other two new networks talked
about drugs, teen-age pre
gnancy and rock stars.
It succeeded, and for a de
cade, ABC has worked the luc
rative youth market virtually
alone.
In fact, ABC Contemporary
and ABC FM are so successful
that the network can point to
statistics showing that 47 per
cent of the nation's 18-34
year-old radio market listens to
stations affiliated with one of
ABC's youth-oriented net
works.

It was a monopoly that beg
ged competition, and ABC
suddenly finds itscll with two
new rivals for the youth audi
ence.
NBC, which had allowed its
radio product to slide in recent
years, announced last May that
it had begun a new radio net
work for young audiences,
something called "The
Source."
Still stinging from the dismal
failure of an earlier attempt at a
new network, the News Infor
mation Service, NBC decided
to nurse "The Source" along
slowly. As a result, "The
Source" is still in testing at the
21 stations that have signed on.
But Dick Verne, executive
vice president of NBC Radio,
says"The Source" will be in 50
album-oriented radio stations
by next spring, in tull competi
tion with ABC's FM and Con
temporary networks.
Not likely, says Margaret
Digan Sinclair, the director of
creative services for RKO. It
will be RKO's new network,
launched last week, thatwill be

ABC's biggest competition.
"We don't really see NBC as
a serious competitor," Sinclair
says. "They've been stuck with
the tag news and experimen
tal' because they're not selling
it; they're still in testing. None
of their affiliates are carrying it,
and it seems to be geared to
teenyboppers."
Indeed, there is to be plenty
of room for the new netwoi ks,
more than 1500 radio stations
that presently have no affilia
tion. And a network package
would seem easy enough to
sell. Hourly news, several fea
tures a dav, occasional live en
tertainment, all provided at no
direct cost.
The local station merely
turns over some of its time for
commercials that the network
has already sold to national ad
vertisers. It is a concept that
worked for all parties back in
the healthy days of radio, one
that is quickly catching on
again.
"Suddenly," says Cavett,
"network radio has come to
life."
