# Opera set in a barnyard

Greenfield, 111. (AP) — The
hogs are downwind, the trac
tors have quit and the bar
nyard's lit up like a diamond in
the rough. Anyone for night
at the opera?
"It's a little different," says
Kaye Shanahan. "But I had this
idea that I'd like to take grand
opera out to the earth — out
here."
So out here she has come,
out to the flat black earth of
western Illinois to the family
farm she and her husband,
George, bought in 1936.
If all the world is a stage, she
figured, then why not "Die
Fledermaus" down on the
farm?
It has been 10 years since
they assembled a company of
singers — a nun, a farmer, a
couple of lawyers, some
housewives, a dance instructor
from Jerseyville — and fielded
their first opera. They per
formed it right in the barn with
the audience out front in lawn
chairs.
And they haven't missed a
summer season since.
"We are spreading the gos
pel that opera is earthy, not just
for people with minks and
diamonds," says Shanahan.
"Lots of people try to make it
hoity-toity, but it shouldn't be.

Opera is for everybody," she
said.
In the beginning, Shanahan
had visions of folks flocking in
from Roodhouse and White
Hall and Haypress. It didn't
happen. Mostly the audience
was from Alton 40 miles away,
where she still teaches voice.
But gradually the word
spread across corn country and
now it is not unusual to see
farm families and seed sales
men seated out in the bar
nyard, listening politely to

Verdi or Pagliacci or Offen
bach.
"If they come out," she says,
"if they make the effort, they
find they like it."
That is her credo. At 72, she
is the grande dame of the Mid
land Repertory Players, a
woman with an unbounded
enthusiasm and a conviction
that if only folks could see that
opera needn't be so snooty,
they'd all love it.
And opera in a barn is any
thing but snooty.
