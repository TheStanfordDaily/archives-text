# Unusual events fill Castro's last visit

### 
New York (AP) — Fidel Castro's visit to
the United Nations this week stirs
memories of his boisterous, strutting New
York visit 19 years ago, when he teamed
with Nikita Khrushchev in the semi
comical, thoroughly vulgar and oftimes
belligerent "Fidel and Nikky" show.
As in 1960, the bearded 53-year-old
Cuban president will address the U.N.
General Assembly, but the time of his
speech, even the date of his arrival, is a
secret because of worries about his safety.
Reports, unconfirmed, have surfaced
about anti-Castro militants headed from
Florida bearing guns and explosives.
Memories of the 1960 visit include the
so-called chicken-plucking incident in
Castro's midtown hotel and his vitriolic
4'/2-hour General Assembly address - still
the longest on record for that organiza
tion.
The General Assembly session that year
was billed as "the greatest diplomatic
gathering in history," attracting heads of
state such as President Tito of Yugoslavia,
President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the Un

ited Arab Republic and British Prime
Minister FHarold Macmillan. President
Dwight Eisenhower came up from
Washington.
It posed for police, up to that time, "the
biggest security problem ever encoun
tered."
There won't be as many officers as
signed to protect Castro as the 11,500 who
guarded Pope John Paul II here last week.
And instead of a public hotel, where he
lived in 1960, Castro will stay at the Cuban
U.N. Mission, a well-secured mid-town
bastion.
Last Friday 3500 noisy anti-Castro de
monstrators rallied outside the United Na
tions, leading Deputy Police Commis
sioner Ellen Fleysher to remark: "If you
can get 3500 people who feel so strongly
. . . that they'll come out when Castro isn't
even here, imagine what they'll muster
when he is here."
When Castro flew into New York on
Sept. 18, 1960, he was 34 and had held
power just 20 months, but already he was a
staunch Soviet ally.

The current political climate between
Cuba and the United States, almost balmy
recently, has turned stormy again because
of Soviet troops stationed on Cuban soil.
There was tension in 1960, too, and the
friendly suavity Castro displayed
during a 1959 visit had been replaced by
snarling, sarcastic anti-American invec
tive.
Most fascinating was the "plucked chic
ken" story. According to unidentified
hotel chambermaids, the Cubans had
cooked steaks and chickens in their suites,
leaving behind a "dreadful mess" of chic
ken bones and feathers.
Khrushchev visited Castro in Harlem the
next day. Afterwards, the two walked arm
in arm to the curb. At the United Nations,
Khrushchev went out of his way to walk
over to Castro's seat, where the two em
braced several times.
Later, Castro kept Khrushchev waiting
nearly 40 minutes fora dinner engagement
at the Soviet U.N. Mission. Khrushchev
passed the time by holding a sidewalk
news conference.
