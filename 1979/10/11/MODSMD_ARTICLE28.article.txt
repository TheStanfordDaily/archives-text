## Dylan's 'Slow Train' comes home 
### 
Slow Train Coming
Bob Dylan
Columbia
There once was a day when interpreting
the meaning of a Bob Dylan album was about
as time consuming as interpreting a T.S. Eliot
poem. Early Dylan albums, such as Highway
67 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, were
infested with enough allegories and con
cealed truths to keep the average Dylan dis
ciple up for days trying to comprehend the
lyrics. Such, however, is not the case with
Dylan's latest release, Slow Train Coming.
The message of this highly ambitious album
is quite clear: Dylan is preaching Christian
ity.
Regardless of one's religious preferences,
however, it does not take long to realize that
Slow Train Coming is the finest Dylan album
since 1974's Blood on the Tracks. Dylan's
vocals have not sounded as good since
\ashville Skyline: the songs on this album
are sung with emotion, which has been lack
ing in a great deal of Dylan's vocal work in
the last few years. The guitar work of Dire
Strait's Mark Knopfler is as good as everyone
has come to expect it to be. Knopfler is one
of the best new guitarists in rock today, and
his unique style serves as a perfect comple
ment to Dylan's voice.
'Too flawless'
Jerry Wexler's job of production is virtu
ally flawless, perhaps even too flawless. Slow
Train Coming is the most commercial sound

ing Dylan album. A female vocal section, a
complete absence of harmonica work, and a
continuous flow of horns leave the album
, sounding more like something Boz Scaggs
' would put out. It is interesting that Dylan
t chose to set such personal lyrics to such
popular music.
The only song on the album that comes
close to having a folk sound is the closing
cut,"When He Comes Again," which Dylan
, originally had not planned to sing.
! Side one opens with "You Gotta Serve
Somebody," which is about choosing bet
! ween good and evil. The song is too simple,
but nevertheless manages to set a found
ation for the cuts which follow. Service, in
fact, is one of the more dominant themes in
the album. On the next cut, "Precious
Angel," Dylan sings:
"Sister let me tell you, about
about a vision that I saw,
You were gathering
water for your husband,
you were circling under the law.
You were telling him about Buddha,
and you were telling him
about Mohammed in one breath,
You never mentioned one time
the man who came and died
a criminal's death."
With his references to servitude,
Mohammed and Buddha, it seems as though
the "Sister" whom Dylan is addressing is the
world's non-Christian religions. His plea for

the whole world to come in contact with the
meaning of Jesus is indeed a bit idealistic,
but it seems as though Dylan realizes this.'
In "I Believe in You," Dylan clearly affirms
his new belief, but at the same time he
acknowledges that such a belief sets him
apart from many of his friends ("They'd like
to drive me from this town, cause I believe in
you").
The side closes with the title cut. With its
continuous "tribal stomp" type of beat, the
song manages to vividly create an image of
an old train creeping around a bend, existing
on what little left it has to push it. The
line,"in the home of the brave, Jefferson's
turning in his grave," is one of Dylan's
harshest in years.
There are two songs which particularly
stand out on the second side, "Gonna
Change My Way of Thinking" and "When
You Gonna Wake Up?," he says, "There's a
man on the cross and he's been crucified
just for you, believe in his power and that is
all you have to do."
Perhaps, the whole purpose behind Slow
Train Coming is to get people to stop looking
to Dylan as some sort of savior, and to offer
an alternative. The album is Dylan's way of
telling people he is neitheran immortal nora
prophet.
Dylan is a poet and a musician, and an
album like Slow Train Coming shows he is a
fine one.
