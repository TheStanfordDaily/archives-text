# More grad candidates to run
## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
A three-day extension of last Monday's deadline for
graduate students to file petitions of candidacy for ASSU
Senate is expected to double the number of graduate
students running for the Senate, said ASSU Elections
Commissioner Mike O'Reilly.
Only five had filed for next Tuesday's and Wednes
day's elections by the original deadline, 4 p.m. Monday,
so the deadline was pushed forward to 4 p.m. today. Six
more graduate students had taken out filing forms and
petitions by yesterday and "most people will probably
bring them back," O'Reilly said. "It's not that hard to get
25 signatures," the minimum needed to become a can
didate, he added.
Last year, graduate students were given an extra week
to declare their candidacies. Despite the extension, only
10 graduate students ran for the 10 seats open on the
senate.
One graduate student who is running for senate
speculated that "many undergraduates run to get into
graduate school. That's one problem graduate students
don't have to worry about."
In contrast, 67 undergraduates are running for the 10
senate seats alloted them. This is the highest number
since 1976, when 69 competed for the seats. Last year, at
the height of the campaign to abolish the ASSU Senate,
only 26 undergraduates ran.
Of the 67 undergraduates, 42 are men and 25 women.
All the graduates are men.
Nearly two-thirds (44) of the undergraduates are run
ning on a total of nine slates. But no candidate will be
listed on the ballot by slate. The senate ruled last year

that slate listings were in conflict with the intended indi
vidual character of the body and would "defeat the pur
pose of the senate," O'Reilly said. All candidates will be
listed in alphabetical order, he said.
There will also be four senate reform proposals on the
ballot, two fee assessments and a referendum on instal
ling lighting on the tennis courts.
One referendum on the senate would provide for the
election of senators by districts, so that each senator
would represent a specific segment of the student body.
Another reform suggestion would establish a system
of "live petitions," whereby each senator would have to
secure and maintain the support of at least 200 students
to remain a senator.
"Anybody who would have 200 names on file would
be a senator," said Brenda Watson, assistant ASSU elec
tions commissioner.
This system "would make the job of elections com
missioner incredibly difficult," O'Reilly added, because
the petitions would be have to be cross-checked con
tinually.
Another proposal is for staggered elections with half
the senate being elected in the springand half in the fall.
The last alternative is for no change.
Students may vote yes or no on each proposal.
The two fee assessments are one-quarter levies to be
collected next quarter. One will finance a Band trip back
East next fall and the other will go to the Women's
Center.
This year, the ballots will resemble a standardized test
answer sheet, with computer-countable ballots replac
ing the old ballots that had to be counted by hand.
Write-in votes are banned by the ASSU Constitution.
