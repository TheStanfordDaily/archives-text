# The 						classics runneth over

Classical records don't date,
and they have also been the
first to benefit from advances
in recording technology.
People now have stereo sys
tems at home which respond
best to the extra care put into
classical albums.And so, appa
rently, they keep selling. To
whatever we owe their exis
tence, the latest classical re
leases are of great interest.
Bach Sonatas and Partitas for
Violin (6)
Oscar Shumsky, violin
Musical Heritage Society
4032-4
Ves, Virginia, they're still
making great recordings. This
set of the Bach works for unac
companied violin is by Oscar

Shumsky, who was the
youngest American pupil of
the famous Leopold Auer, it is
an eventful album. Critics of
Auer say that he built up his
reputation by taking only stu
dents who were already
finished artists; if this is so,
then why do his pupils all share
the "Auer Sound"? Shumsky
pours out that unique and
powerful tone as did Heifetz,
Elman and Milstein before him.
These performances owe as
much to the old "grand man
ner" of playing as they do to
the new "authentic" school,
but they are alive with dynamic
and tonal shadings. Shumsky,
who has velocity to spare, plays
with panache to equal
Heifetz's Bach of the 19305, and
he makes Milstein's most re

cent set (on DGG) seem a bit
cautious at times.
The sound is not as good as
DCG's, but MHS does offer the
option of a tape version which
sounds decent enough.
Beethoven Symphony No. 3,
"Eroica"
Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Carlo Maria Giulini, cond.
DGG 2531 123
There has been a lot of fuss
made over this recording. Per
sonally, I'm not yet sure it will
wear well. Giulini's is undoub
tedly an "Eroica" of conviction
with, for example, the exposi
tion being repeated in the first
movement. The funeral march
is about as grand as can be, and

the scherzo is taken at just the
right tempo. There is a strong
hand at the helm here.
Vet, apart from unusually
glorious playing by the solo
winds, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic is sparse in tone,
particularly in the string de
partment. This is due partly to
the recording and perhaps
partly to Giulini's idea; what
ever the reason, it keeps me
from rushing back to this re
cord for pleasure. What might
this have been like with the
Berlin Philharmonic or the
Chicago Symphony?
The pre-recorded cassette
should be avoided, as it intro
duces a turnover break in the
funeral march. For shame,
DGG!
