"When people see the
skinny ties and short hair, they
freak out. They think we're
punk neo-Nazis who are going
to start fights and throw up
onstage. New Wave isn't much
like punk. It's real music."

"We played around Stanford
last spring, but that was when
we were still sort of rock and
top 40ish. We gave up top-40
after people starting throwing
things at us because we
screwed up some Bee Gee
tunes. Now, when people
throw things, it means we're
doing all righf."

"There are half a dozen New
Wave clubs in San Francisco,
but it hasn't spread yet. We
make money playing weddings
in Marin on weekend after
noons, but that's a different re

pertoire. 'Girl From Ipanema,'
'This Masquerade.' That kind of
stuff."
— S.M.
"New Wave music? Well, it's
a throw-back to early rock. A
basic, straight rock beat; a sim
ple, repeating bass line, and
then we usually have the guitar
and piano playing somewhat
dissonant chords to counter
the overly simple rhythms."
— JP.
"Seth is the only drummer
I've ever seen that plays with
his head."

"New Wave is very condu
cive to nightclubs, because it's
a show, too. lumping around
while you play gets to be a way
of life. I lump around a lot at
dinner, too."

The Ultimate Moose Band
can be heard on radio stations
KMEL, KSAN and KZSU. Here
are some of their lyrics, from
the popular single, "She's an
Airhead," by Seth Miller:
She's an airhead
She's an airhead

Couldn't be dumber if she was
dead
But she's a genius in bed
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's an airhead
(I love her)
"The last verse makes it clear
that the song is not anti
women, at all. I can't re
member how it goes, though."
