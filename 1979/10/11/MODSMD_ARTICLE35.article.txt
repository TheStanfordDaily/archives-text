# Tyner plus Evans: jazz piano summit
## 
### 
No. They didn't play to
gether, if that's what you were
thinking. It would have been
too good to be true.
Nevertheless, Bill Evans and
McCoy Tyner set fire to the
Great American Music Hall
Tuesday in a concert that left
this writer peaking with plea
sure.
Bill Evans began by filling the
club with the lyric warmth and
intimacy of the piano solo.
"Noel's Theme" (Michael Leg
rand), "Letter to Evan" (Evans),
and an untitled original were
impressionistic jazz ballads
that put the listener at ease,
then awed him with their rich
ness and their beauty.
Evans closed the solo set
with another untitled composi
tion that swung feverishly until
the last bar. It was a rare oppor
tunity to hear him unaccom
panied; only intermittently did
his playing seem to miss the
customary trio setting.
When bassist Marc Johnson
and drummer )oe Laßarbera
settled down to business,
though, nothing was missing.
They make another great Bill
Evans trio: provocative, em
pathic, exciting and original.
The group played a couple of
jazz standards, "My Romance"
and "Someday My Prince Will
Come," that burned with an in
tensity strictly "Bill Evans":
Hard-driving, up-tempo swing
ing that maintained a sensitive
and subtle edge. No matter
how the pace quickened,
Evans tickled rather than tor
mented, the keys.
McCoy Tyner, another living
legend, shoved the rest of the
show into high gear with his
aggressive, densely layered
and technically brilliant play
ing.
"Passion Dance," a Tyner

original, leapt from the piano
unaccompanied in a raging
fury. Both of his hands surged
and jumped up and down the
keyboard in swells of dense
voicings.
When he wasn't racing over
the extent of the instrument,
he was pounding and swirling
in one place, creating an
earthquake-like effect.
Strikingly, Tyner's playing
did not appear congested as it
has in the past. Plenty of ample
spaces thrown into the thick
traffic of notes kept the sound
moving consistently.
The rest of the trio joined
McCoy, and they were off and
running with )ohn Coltrane's
"Lazybird." It was the most
empathic trio that Tyner has
played with in a long time.
Charles Fambrough offered a
marked contrast to the aggres
sive bassists usually accom
panying Tyner. He effectively
juxtaposed a lighter touch
against the heaviness of
Tyner's playing .
Tyner's biggest discovery,
though, was George Johnson
on drums. He knows how to
use his cymbals to their
greatest advantage, never wail
ing on them as did past Tyner
athletes. Instead, he offers
surprising, light, intricate
rhythm patterns followed
closely by a switch to the snare
and tom-toms, which he cov
ers with power and grace.
It's impossible to compare
two musicians with such radi
cally different approaches to
sound, harmony and the bot
tom line, beauty. But the
power award goes to McCoy
lyner; the subtlety award to
Bill Evans. And the excitement
and musical bliss prize goes to
both.
