# Outrage, but no indictment in 'Dallas Forty'
## 
### 
With his straggly blond
moustache and tired blue eyes,
Phil Elliot is the ideal Everyman
for the 19705. He yearns for the
simple life — a horse ranch up
in the hills, a roaring fire at
night, and a good woman to
share it all.
But, Elliot has another
dream, one that counters the
first and makes it seemingly
impossible to realize. What he
wants more than the good life
is the good game: to start, go
all the way, and make the
miraculous catch that wins the
championship with no time left
on the clock. While 80,000
people scream his name, of
course.
North Dallas Forty is the story
of Phil Elliot's travels through
the evil world of football; a
world made evil not by original
sin, but by the money and sp-es
and computers of the owners.
Where Everyman did daily bat

tie with Pride, Greed and Av
arice, Elliot must face guards,
tackles and linebackers.
Ugly bunch
And a disgusting bunch they
are. Bo Svenson, for instance,
plays Jo Bob, a hulking lineman
and future proprieter of Jo
Bob's Fine Foods. His idea of
getting ready for a game is leav
ing an impression of his helmet
in a steel locker; his dialogue is
fairly limited to "Why is he al
ways makin' fun a' me?" spo
ken in a delinquent drawl (clost
your eyes and you'll swear it's
Don Meredith).
Few of the football players
portrayed in the film are as
childish or as animalistic as |oe
Bob, though. And even he
shows human tendencies;
after spending a week trying to
stuff Elliot's head into an aspi
rin bottle, Joe Bob tinds it in his
heart to sa> You looked good
out there, Elliot," atter the
climactic game.

No indictment
And therein lies the meaning
of this relatively harmless movie
(after a while, you don't notice
the obscenity, and the blood
doesn't begin to gush until the
final moments). People who go
to North Dallas forty expecting
to see an indictment of the brut
ality and childishness of the
sport of football will be disap
pointed.
Peter Gent, who wrote the
novel that the film is based on,
loves the game. The movie's
best moments come when El
liot (Nick Nolte) talks about
why he plays football; his inar
ticulate gropings after a way of
expressing what the game
means for him are truly affect
ing.
The anger in North Dallas
Forty is directed at those who,
in Gent's opinion, have per
verted the game. Gonrad
Hunter Enterprises ("Your

corporate arm makes more in a
week than this football team
will in a year, Gon") and its mill
ions dictate team policy, spy on
players' lives, and, worst of all,
force them to play while in
jured.
Durning
Gharles Durning, making a
career of playing nasty coaches
(remember One on One?),
gives an excellent performance
as the coach who shares the
win-at-any-cost philosophy
held by management. He
seems to always be on the
brink of a revelation, of seeing
through his obsession and dis
covering how miserable he
makes the players' lives. Nolte
is not quite as successful, but
only because the film's
wooden dialogue doesn't
sound as natural coming out of
his mouth. And the claims that
Mac Davis is a "revelation" are,
sad to say, false.
This could have been a much

better tilm if football had be
the only subject; but a love
terest has been thrown in
egg Elliot along, showing hi
the worthlessness of what h(
doing. And the repeat)
scenes of sadistic, mindle
violence perpetrated on ar
off the field by the players a
overdone; if football is real
such a great game and tf
players such princes of fellow
why do they tear women
clothes off at parties and thro
television sets into swimmir
pools?
North Dallas Forty does su
ceed in conveying Gent's ou
rage at what professional foo
ball has become, and if yo
have any interest in the game
is worth seeing for that alon«
Although crude an
amateurishly directed, it doc
possess the power of its cor
victions.

course.
North Dallas Forty is the story
of Phil Elliot's travels through
the evil world of football; a
world made evil not by original
sin, but by the money and sp-es
and computers of the owners.
Where Everyman did daily bat

tie with Pride, Greed and Av
arice, Elliot must face guards,
tackles and linebackers.
Ugly bunch
And a disgusting bunch they
are. Bo Svenson, for instance,
plays Jo Bob, a hulking lineman
and future proprieter of Jo
Bob's Fine Foods. His idea of
getting ready for a game is leav
ing an impression of his helmet
in a steel locker; his dialogue is
fairly limited to "Why is he al
ways makin' fun a' me?" spo
ken in a delinquent drawl (clost
your eyes and you'll swear it's
Don Meredith).
Few of the football players
portrayed in the film are as
childish or as animalistic as |oe
Bob, though. And even he
shows human tendencies;
after spending a week trying to
stuff Elliot's head into an aspi
rin bottle, Joe Bob tinds it in his
heart to sa> You looked good
out there, Elliot," atter the
climactic game.

No indictment
And therein lies the meaning
of this relatively harmless movie
(after a while, you don't notice
the obscenity, and the blood
doesn't begin to gush until the
final moments). People who go
to North Dallas forty expecting
to see an indictment of the brut
ality and childishness of the
sport of football will be disap
pointed.
Peter Gent, who wrote the
novel that the film is based on,
loves the game. The movie's
best moments come when El
liot (Nick Nolte) talks about
why he plays football; his inar
ticulate gropings after a way of
expressing what the game
means for him are truly affect
ing.
The anger in North Dallas
Forty is directed at those who,
in Gent's opinion, have per
verted the game. Gonrad
Hunter Enterprises ("Your

corporate arm makes more in a
week than this football team
will in a year, Gon") and its mill
ions dictate team policy, spy on
players' lives, and, worst of all,
force them to play while in
jured.
Durning
Gharles Durning, making a
career of playing nasty coaches
(remember One on One?),
gives an excellent performance
as the coach who shares the
win-at-any-cost philosophy
held by management. He
seems to always be on the
brink of a revelation, of seeing
through his obsession and dis
covering how miserable he
makes the players' lives. Nolte
is not quite as successful, but
only because the film's
wooden dialogue doesn't
sound as natural coming out of
his mouth. And the claims that
Mac Davis is a "revelation" are,
sad to say, false.
This could have been a much

better tilm if football had be
the only subject; but a love
terest has been thrown in

the worthlessness of what h(

With his straggly blond
moustache and tired blue eyes,
Phil Elliot is the ideal Everyman
for the 19705. He yearns for the
simple life — a horse ranch up
in the hills, a roaring fire at
night, and a good woman to
share it all.
But, Elliot has another
dream, one that counters the
first and makes it seemingly
impossible to realize. What he
wants more than the good life
is the good game: to start, go
all the way, and make the
miraculous catch that wins the
championship with no time left
on the clock. While 80,000
people scream his name, of
course.
