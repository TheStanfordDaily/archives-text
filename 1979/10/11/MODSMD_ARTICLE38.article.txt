# Motels' debut – lethal, sexy emotionalism
##

As pictured on the rear cover
oiThe Motels, the debut album
by a Los Angeles group of the
same name, singer Martha
Davis looks like many women
you might see in the Sunset
Strip's Whiskey club, or down
at the Starwood on Santa
Monica. She's dressed in
punk-meets-Pierre Cardin,
made up similarly, and posses
sed of a cheap, lethally sexy
beauty that threatens, as in the
group's "Total Control," to
"seduce and destroy."
The image is at once veraci
ous and deceptive. The Motels
are the product of a burgeon

ing L.A. rock scene, with such
diverse locals as the Dickies
and Levi and the Rockats
signed by major record labels.
As the group's lead singer and
chief songwriter, Davis is
sometimes effectively hard
edged — at points in "Total
Control," lor instance, or in
"Closets and Bullets," where
she intones with rather bitter
irony, "Fnvy me, I'm alone
again."
More emotion
Much more often, though,
the record shows a gentler
woman, one with emotional
needs lurking behind the hard

front. "Counting," the album's
last and best song, find* Davis
lonely and reflective:
What harm could it do
Sometimes I try and call you
I seen I seen em
go
Some are faster now, Some
not so
You know Sally, she ain't a
hit of fun anymore . . .
It seems a nice touch to end
the record with this track, as
though the more affecting,
sensitive impression is the one
Davis wants to leave the lis
tener.

*
At other times, however, her
approaches turn sour. "Kix,"
which remonstrates against a
smoothie who breaks all the
young girls' hearts, is full of
cliches and is pointless; that
cheatin' guy, in both city and
country versions, has been
sung about hundreds of times,
and with far more poignant
emotion than shown here.
"Celia" takes Davis onto the
violent side, where her voice,
affectingly plaintive in "Count
ing," hasn't the power to be
convincing. "Dressing Up" is
simply a nonsensical throwa
way.

Though sporting some nice
touches — Davis' generally en
ticing melodies, Martin
Jourard's late-night
saxophone, some inventive in
strumentation — the group's
music is often reminiscent of
Joe Jackson's. With its domin
ant backbeat and often rhyth
mically simple guitar riffs, the
Motels' sound falls prey to that
style's attendant flaw: after a
tew listenings, the simplicity
begins to pale a bit and to lose
musical interest.
"Porn Reggae" points up
another, more serious flaw. In
its short introduction, it
sounds like an incredibly re
strained version of Elvis Costel
lo's "Watching the Detec
tives." The restraint works well
in achieving the breezy jazz
sound the Motels seek in this
particular song.
At no point in the record,
however, does the group even
approach the ferocious power
of "Detectives," with its carni
val sound gone amok; this is a
regrettable and serious omis
sion.
Stop forward
At the moment, a number of
groups are featuring similar
musical touches and dealing in
similar themes; Jackson and
Blondie come immediately to
mind. I.ike them, the Motels
probably will do well commer
cially, and probably deservedly
so; they trade well on their
strengths, and represent a long
step forward from disco.
At the same time, they have
detinite improvements to
make. Most notably, the music
needs more power, invention
and originality, and Davis needs
both to strengthen the consis
tency and to vary the concerns
of her songs, which here focus
almost exclusively on the dis
appointments and ruptures of
relations between the men and
women who inhabit bars and
apartments after which the
group is named.
Maybe then they could call
themselves the Hotels.
