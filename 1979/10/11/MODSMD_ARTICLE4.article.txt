# Rising interest rates threaten mortgage funds
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Homeowners
will be virtually shut out of mortgage
funds in nearly half the states begin
ning in lanuary, savings bank officials
said yesterday.
Twenty-four states will be hit har
dest because they have laws limiting
mortgage rates to about 12 percent
or less, making it unprofitable for
banks there to lend mortgage money
because they must pay even higher
interest rates to borrow.
But small businesses will be hit
hardest — and first — by rising in
terest rates, economists say. Many
won't find credit, while others may
pay more than 16 percent interest in
coming weeks.
Small manufacturers, particularly
in the Midwest, will be most vulner

able, these economists say. But
stores that sell specialty items and
long-lasting consumer products will
also feel the credit pinch.
Squeeze on women
As a result, many part-time retail
workers will be laid off, the
economists say. And since women
hold many of these jobs, they can
expect tough times ahead, the
forecasters add.
Thomas Parliament, an economist
at the U.S. League of Savings Associ
ations, pinpointed Arkansas,
Washington, Georgia, Illinois, lowa,
Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New
Jersey, New York and Texas as very
mortgage-dry "come the first part of
next year."
And in those states without usury

ceilings, he said, homebuyers may
face mortgages carrying interest
rates of 12.5 percent or higher.
Steep rates will be particularly evi
dent in California and Florida, he
said.
Discount rate up
The dramatic mortgage and loan
crunch is the result of new tight
money policies adopted last
weekend by the Federal Reserve
Board in an effort to beat back soar
ing inflation and limit excessive cre
dit.
The board increased the discount
rate it charges member banks from
11 percent to 12 percent and it
dramatically altered the way it con
trols the availability of money and
credit.

Many banks immediately in
creased the interest they charge their
best customers from 13.5 percent to
14.5 percent, and many economists
predict it will reach 15 percent.
Small is not best
Small businesses, however, rarely
qualify as "best customers." They
usually must pay 2 percent to 3 per
cent above the prime rate, said
economist Richard Landry of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
That is almost as much as consum
ers pay on credit-card interest, and it
makes borrowing very difficult for
most small businesses with sales
below $500,000 a year, Landry said.
Moreover, he added, there are
erowine reports that smaller, ree-
ional banks are hesitant to extend
loans.
Consumers who want loans also
will face difficulties, say economists.
Things will be tough
"I would think that it's going to be
a little harder to get a car loan, a little
harder to get a mortgage," said
economist William E. Gibson of the
brokerage house Smith Barney Har
ris Wupham & Co. Inc.
"It will be very tough to buy or sell
homes without mortgage financing
available," said bank analyst
Jonathan E. Gray of Sanford C. Berns
tein & Co. Inc. "It's difficult to see
institutions funding mortgages one
or two months in advance when the
cost of money is so uncertain."
Numerous economists are predict
ing that the Federal Reserve Board's
tight-money thrust will deepen the
expected recession.
