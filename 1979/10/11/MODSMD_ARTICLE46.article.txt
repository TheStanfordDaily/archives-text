Castro expected in N.Y. today
New York - Fidel Castro is expected to ar
rive in New York today for a visit that has
spawned an extraordinary security operation
to protect the controversial Cuban president.
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar said Cas
tro will address the U.N. General Assembly at
noon tomorrow. Other details of the visit —
including Castro's arrival time and the length
of his stay — were being discussed, and would
be made public as they are decided, he said.
Plans for the visit have been shrouded in
secrecy, partly due to the security problems
associated with the Cuban leader.
U.N. Secretary General Kurt Waldheim was
not apprised of the visit until last Friday, and
Castro's arrival date was not announced until
yesterday.
Stajduhar told reporters that Cuban Foreign
Minister Isadora Malmierca had revealed Cas
tro's plans when he spoke to Waldheim shortly
before noon yesterday. He was accompanied
by Cuba's U.N. Ambassador, Raul Roa Kouri.
Castro will be speaking to the 152-nation
assembly both as Cuba's head of state and as
chairman of the 90-member non-aligned na
tions movement.
Stajduhar said he assumed that Castro
would also address the non-aligned group.
The foreign ministers of many of those nations
"are present at the United Nations.
Strict security measures were to be put in
effect, with city police, Secret Service, Cuban
and U.N. security forces combining to protect
the Cuban leader.
Castro will bring his personal army of 210
"aides," many of whom were expected to be
armed. More than 1000 police were to be used
in the security operation, including police
helicopters, scuba teams and rooftop patrols.
Senate disputes use of funds
Washington — The Senate Appropriations
Committee yesterday rejected two House
passed emergency bills needed to keep the
government operating fully, and voted instead
to stick with its own version of the legislation.
The House-Senate dispute, stemming
largely from differences over federal financing
for abortions, forced several major govern
ment departments and numerous smaller
agencies to continue using funds left over
from the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
Another result, announced yesterday, was
that employees qf the Transportation and
Labor Departments will receive only half-pay
when their next paychecks are due.
The Senate committee bill now goes to the
Senate for action, and a House-Senate confer
ence committee was scheduled to meet today
to reconcile differences.
The dispute centers on legislation that
would provide emergency funds to keep the
government operating until Congress passes
regular appropriations bills for the 1979-80 fis
cal year, which began Oct. 1.
Payments for several government programs

— mostly benefits administered by the Labor
Department such as unemployment compen
sation — already have been withheld.
Senate leaders indicated they were willing to
bend on a proposed 5.5 percent pay raise for
members of Congress, as demanded by the
House, so long as only House members and
not senators are voted a raise.
But several senators expressed displeasure
with that idea, which would mean House
members would make $3200 a year more than
senators. The suggestion, advanced by Senate
Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Vir
ginia, was not included in the Senate commit
tee's bill, which makes no provision for a pay
raise for any member of Congress.
But on the abortion issue, there was no sign
of a willingness to compromise on either side.
Congressional leaders told President Jimmy
Carter at a White House breakfast meeting
they see no easy solution to the bitter abortion
dispute.
State inflation hits 14 percent
Sacramento — California's inflation hit the
annual rate of 14 percent in the second quarter
of 1979 ending July 1, officials report.
Chairman William Bennett of the State Board
of Equalization said Tuesday that second
quarter sales rose $3.9 billion, or 13.8 percent,
over the same period a year ago to a record
$32.4 billion.
But inflation aside, Bennett said the real in
crease came to only 3.6 percent, compared to
9 percent during the first quarter.
He said California's consumer price index
during the quarter translated to an annual rate
of 14 percent, 9.8 percent higher than the rate
during the second quarter of 1978.
Gasoline sales jumped a hefty 23.6 percent
to almost $2.8 billion during the period as the
average price of gasoline reached 83 cents per
gallon, up 33 percent from the second quarter
of 1978.
At the same time, sales of new cars fell 4.1
percent.
Gasoline distribution during ihe quarter
dropped 3.4 percent from the same period last
year.
Pope urges loyalty from nuns
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II yesterday
urged Roman Catholic nuns to be loyal to his
leadership in the church and never become
"irritated or embittered."
The pope's words were interpreted here as
an indirect reference to the dramatic request,
an American nun, Theresa Kane, made to john
Paul in Washington, asking him to allow
women to become priests.
Four days ago, addressing the pope in the
Sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception, Sis
ter Kane called for equal "reverance and dig
nity for all persons" and appealed to |ohn Paul
to admit women to "all ministries in our
church."
During yesterday's publicaudience in St. Pe

ter's Square, the pope hailed a group ot 600
Italian nuns among the crowd and told them in
Italian they needed to show "firmness and de
licacy" in the church.
The nuns were mother superiors of various
orders gathered in Rome for their annual as
sembly.
FBI eases sex, drug policies
Washington — FBI Director William Webs
ter is liberalizing the bureau's long tradition of
harsh punishment for agents who engage in
sexual relationships outside of marriage.
The shift means that an agent involved in a
premarital or extramarital relationship no
longer faces automatic dismissal from the
bureau.
In two other areas of personal conduct —
homosexuality and marijuana use — Webster
has bent the r<I.J rules ever so slightly as he
develops the bureau's first clear-cut written
policies on such matters.
Though he continues to ban practicing
homosexuals from bureau jobs, Webster has
asked for the latest scientific data on
homosexuality and says he is willing to con
sider relaxing the rule some years hence.
As for drug use, Webster says he won't tol
erate it in the bureau. But, in one recent in
stance, he chose not to fire an agent who
smoked marijuana while in college several
years before joining the bureau. Instead, the
agent was fined and placed on probation.
Such changes may seem trivial to bureau
outsiders accustomed to the relatively easygo
ing policies of many private employers. But for
the FBI, Webster's approach represents a re
markable departure from decades of crusty
conservatism.
Nobel chances dim for Carter
Stockholm, Sweden — The year's first Nobel
Prize, the award in medicine, will be an
nounced here today and others follow in the
next week. President Jimmy Carter is a
nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Overall, Americans are again considered
strong candidates for this year's prizes after
capturing the lion's share in 1978. About one
third of the Nobel awards have gone to Ameri
cans since they were first presented in 1901.
Carter, whose nomination for the 1979
Nobel Peace Prize was received too late to be
considered, was again nominated this year
well before the Feb. 1 deadline. There are 56
nominees, including 37 individuals and 19 or
ganizations, for the prize shared last year by
Egyptian President Anwar Sadar and Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin for their
Mideast peace efforts.
Observers in Oslo, where the peace prize is
awarded, said they consider it unlikely that
Carter would win this year for his Camp David
summit, which led to the Egyptian-Israeli
peace treaty. It was doubtful the award would
again be decided over the Mideast issue, they
said.

The prize sum in each category this year has
swelled to a record $190,000 compared to
$170,000 last year. The foundation is a going
concern which showed earnings of $2.25 mill
ion last year.
Early snow blankets East
An "abnormal" October snowstorm sur
prised the East yesterday, breaking records
and burying foliage underaccumulations upto
a foot deep.
Hundreds of thousands of homes went dark
and schools closed as leaf-laden trees toppled
onto power lines in the earliest snowfall many
areas had ever seen.
In the suburbs of Washington, D.C., where
the last time it snowed this early was Oct. 5,
1892, more than 72,000 utility customers lost
their power and a layer of slush up to 4 inches
deep made driving treacherous.
It was the earliest snowfall on record in
Newark, N.J., and weather officials in Virginia
said no snowstorm of such intensity had hit the
state so early in the season since the govern
ment started keeping records in 1872.
Across the Hudson River in New York City, it
was just the second time in 110 years that snow
had fallen this early in the year. A "trace" fell
on Oct. 10, 1925, the weather bureau said.
World Series
Baltimore — Doug DeCinces smashed a
two-run homer, capping a five-run Baltimore
uprising in the first inning, and the Orioles
went on to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-4 in
the once-postponed opening game of the 1979
World Series last night.
Today's weather
San Francisco Bay Area — Mostly fair through
tonight but patches of fog during early morn
ing hours and occasional high clouds. Partly
cloudy and cooler tomorrow. Lows in the 50s.
Highs today in the 70s to low Bos and tomorrow
in the mid 60s to mid 70s.
