# Dow drops 48 points in two days
## Market turmoil continues 
### 
New York (AP) — Frenzied activity
rocked the stock and bond markets
of Wall Street for the second straight
day yesterday in a convulsive reac
tion to the Federal Reserve's new
plans for clamping down on credit.
Trading volume at the New York
Stock Exchange reached a record
81.62 million shares, far outdistanc
ing the previous high of 66.37 million
set Aug. 3, 1978.
The Dow Jones average of 30 in
dustrial stocks, off about 25 points at
mid-afternoon, staged a late rally to
finish with an 8.27 decline at 849.82.
That left the widely recognized aver
age with a loss of more than 48 points
since Monday.
Bonds under pressure
Bond prices likewise came under
intense pressure as the markets ab

sorbed the shock of new record
levels of interest rates.
Tuesday, many of the nation's
banks announced unprecedented
increases of a full percentage point in
the benchmark prime lending rate,
from 13Vi to 14% percent.
In world markets, the dollar drop
ped in foreign exchange, giving up
some of its gains of the past two days.
Gold prices soared more than $28 an
ounce to $419t50 in early trading, but
later backed off to $408 in London.
Despite all the turmoil, however,
many Wall Streeters continued to
praise the Federal Reserve's decision
last weekend to bring out some
heavy new guns in its battle against
inflation.
Recession adds up
Many conceded that the new steps
raised the odds of at least a moderate
recession in the months ahead, and
potentially rugged times for such
important industries as housing con
struction and auto manufacturing.
But they argued that whatever
short term pain might result could be
more than offset by the longer-tern,
benefits of progress against rapid in

flation, which many economists re
gard as a ticking time bomb for the
U.S. economy.
And they said the market's sharp
declines this week did not qualify as
any kind of "crash" like the devastat
ing slide of 1929, when stock prices
lost nearly 50 percent of their value
over a few short weeks.
Only 7 percent slide
This week's slide, by contrast, rep
resented a loss of between 7 percent
and 8 percent, as measured by the
Dow Jones industrial average,
through mid-afternoon yesterday.
"There is no earthly reason for a
stock-market panic," said Heinz Biel,
a veteran market analyst with the
brokerage firm of )anney Montgom
ery Scott Inc. "What the Fed is doing
is a very constructive move. If it's
successful, it will avoid a major de
pression in the future."
"The Fed is running some risks
here, but they are calculated risks,"
said William Griggs, a credit expert at
the ). Henry Schroder Bank & Trust
Co. "It is saying, 'we are going to
moderate inflation, and if you give us
some time we can bring it down sig
nificantly.' "
