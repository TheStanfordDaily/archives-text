# Division weakening feminist movement
## 
### William Atkins 
Growing dissent within the
feminist movement may lead to a
weakened support base and possible
loss of initiative, feminist Charlotte
Bunch said yesterday.
At a noon lecture sponsored by the
Center for Research on Women
(CROW), Bunch outlined three basic
divisions within the feminist move
ment which she said tend to splinter
some feminists.
The first and oldest form of
feminism, she said, is embodied in
protest actions. "The protest move
ment forces people to look at issues
which no one wants to recognize as
issues. Fifteen years ago it was abor
tion; 10 years ago it was lesbianism;
five years ago it was rape."
She said the protest segment of the
movement "is the initial conscious
ness raising edge."
The second political arena for the
movement, according to Bunch, is
organized political pressure "aimed
primarily at legal change." Such
groups as the National Organization
for Women (NOW) "focus on how to
change things that affect us as wo
men," she said. She cited gay rights
as a specific pressure group that has
become more influential in the past
few years.
Bunch is on the Board of Directors
of the National Gay Task Force. She is
founder and editor of both Quest, a
feminist quarterly and The Furies, a
lesbian newspaper.
The third and most recent political
arena of the feminist movement is
women running for and attaining
political office. She said women who

enter government are often re
garded with mistrust by members of
the movement.
"The more women in government
positions, the more coordination we
need to have," she said. She cited
the lack of feminist outcry when
Midge Costanza resigned from the
Carter Administration after having
difficulties with President Jimmy Car
ter as an example of the divisions
within the movement.
Bunch said that in order to remain
strong in the '80s a more sophisti
cated approach is needed in the
feminist movement.
"Feminism is not just a simple
shopping list of issues," she said.
"Every issue is a feminist issue."
The feminist movement must also
combat the right wing backlash in
American society today, she said.
Rather than " 'America, love it or
leave it'. .. we must have 'America,
love it or change it,' " she stated.
"Women have to regain the initia
tive. One of the ways is by having an
active public presence of feminism."
Bunch concluded her speech by
stating that "We are a wave of the
future that is not isolated or ghet
toised into a few small groups or
places."
She emphasized that such issues
as the greater participation of the
female clergy in church decisions,
child care and the rights of minority
women will carry the movement
through the '80s. The presence of
women as a viable voting block will
become a major factor in the future,
perhaps as early as the 1980 presiden
tial election, she said.
