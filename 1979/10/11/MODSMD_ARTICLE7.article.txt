# 50,000 dried out books return to UGLY
## 
### Julie Jacobs 
Most of the 50,000 volumes dam
| aged by a flood caused by a water
| main crack at Meyer Library last
| November have been returned to the
| shelves, according to Sally Bucha
| nan, Meyer Library conservation of
| ficer.
Two to three thousand of the dam
i aged books have yet to be returned.
Half of these will be sent to a bindery,
| while half need special repair,
1 Buchanan said.

Only 50 books were ruined by the
water. Each is scheduled for re
placement.
At the Law Library, where another
flood drenched parts of three floors
on September 7, 30,000 books of the
250,000 volume collection will be air
dried and reshelved within six
weeks, Buchanan said.
Seven thousand law books will
undergo vacuum drying at Lockheed
Corporation in Mountain View.
These volumes, now frozen in a San

Jose ice house, will be placed in a
vacuum chamber while still frozen.
The ice in the books will then be con
verted to water vapor. Since the ice
will not be melted, the books will not
be resoaked.
Conditions in the vacuum
chamber resemble those of 200,000
cubic feet in outer space, said
Buchanan; the pressure is to
that of a perfect vacuum.
Lockheed's equipment is among
the best in the nation, she said. The

current wait for access to the Loc
kheed facility is about 6 weeks.
In another of the three library
floods in the last year, Buchanan es
timated that half of the carpet soaked
in Green Library by a fire sprinkler
misfunction had to be replaced. No
books had been shelved in this new
wing, but Buchanan estimated the
damages to panelling and carpeting
at $200,000. There were "no perma
nent damages to the building," she
said.
"Good preventive maintenance,
flood alarms and good disaster ac
tion plans" to avoid panic and to
speed emergency service are several
precautions that can minimize future
problems, Buchanan said. For exam
ple, an emergency alert in the middle
of the night during the Meyer flood
prevented the accident from becom
ing a major disaster.
A staff of six is now repairing origi
nal covers and inside pages, and
hand sewing protective covers, for
some of the damaged books. This re
storation work has been
supplemented by emergency help
during the floods from students, fa
culty and staff.
"One of the most warming experi
ences" during these emergencies,
Buchanan said, was "that the Stan
ford community responded with
help, expertise and offers of assis
tance."
