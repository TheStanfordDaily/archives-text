# SAC keeps issue alive
## 
### Michael Weiss 
"We want people to know
that there is still a possibility of
the draft being reinstated. It is
important not to forget about
this national issue."
Carin Little, one of the eight
student leaders of Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC)
said her group is working hard
to keep people informed about
the possible reinstatement of
the draft.
SAC is an anti-draft organiza
tion which has been in exis
tence since last January. It was
at that time that the draft again
became an important issue,
according to Little, because of
legislation introduced in Con
gress and the Senate.
Among the bills introduced
was the Defense Appropriation
Authorization Bill which con
tained a clause that would have
required boys reaching age 1H
on or after Jan. 1, 1%1 to regis
ter for the draft.
Most University students
would not have been affected
by this partit ular bill, yet other
bills were also introduced
which would have affected
older students. The technical
aspects of these bills differed,
ranging from mandated regist
ration to a national service op
tion.
Early last month, however,
the Defense Appropriation Bill
was defeated.
But Little said she felt the
issue is not dead. She said that
President Jimmy Carter is pre
sently ordering a study of
whetheror not the draft should
be reinstated.
When asked what SAC
hoped to achieve, Little re
plied, "Our goal is to keep
people aware of the fact that
the draft is still a very real is

sue."
To achieve this end, said Lit
tle, the group has organized
many important activities.
Last spring, for example,
SAC set up three rallies at the
University. Speaking at these
rallies were David Harris, a
noted political activist and
former Student Body President
of the University, and Daniel
Ellsberg.
SAC also has a program in
which it keeps local high
school students constantly in
formed about the draft.

'There is a possibil
ity that with
reinstatement of
the draft, univer
sities would be re
quired to give up in
formation about
students which is at
present confiden
tial. '

According to Sholom Ac
kelsbert, another of the eight
leaders of the group, "It is im
portant for the many anti-draft
organizations around the
country to take a unified
stand."
"One of our members made
up a list of over 100 groups like
ours around the country," he
said. We have sent letters to all
of these groups, and have so
far received responses from
over thirty."

Little explained that SAC it
self is the result of local groups
unifying.
"There were several anti
draft organizations around
campus," she said. Then in
January, when the issue of the
draft really heated up, these
many groups decided to form a
coalition. Peace (People
Everywhere Against Conscrip
tion) and other similar organi
zations pooled their resources
and became Stanford Against
Conscription."
Of particular concern to the
unified group is the part of
draft legislation which deals
with the privacy of student re
cords.
"There is a possibility that
with the reinstatement of the
draft, universities would be re
quired to give up to the gov
ernment information about
students which is at present
confidential," said Little.
The members of the organi
zation have strong feelings
about maintaining the privacy
of records and about the draft
in general.
"I am opposed to
militarism," said Ackelsbert. "I
feel that armies give countries
an opportunity to interfere
with the affairs of other coun
tries. This is a violation of
rights, and I think it is wrong."
Presently, SAC consists of
about 60 members.
"It is early in the year, so I
really cannot say how much
appeal the SAC has to stu
dents," said Little. "When the
issue of the draft becomes
more well-known, we will
probably start to receive more
attention."


Stanford Against Conscription sponsored three rallies last spring
when the draft issue was most debated. Here students are seen on a
