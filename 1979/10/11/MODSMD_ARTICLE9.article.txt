# A 						'private person'
## Segretti starts over 
### 
Newport Beach, Calif. (AP) â€”
Six years after he served time
for Watergate-related crimes,
Donald Segretti is quietly
building a law practice here
and trying to avoid the
limelight.
"I'm not a public person
anymore," says Segretti, now
36.
"I'm a private person and I'm
trying to live a private life."
As a lawyer, Segretti occa
sionally gets invitations to
political fund-raisers, but he
says he avoids them. "The only
things I contribute to are the
American Cancer Society and
the Heart Fund," he said.
Famed for his Watergate
dirty tricks, Segretti was among
the first to plead guilty in the
case and go to prison. In 1973,
he served four months and 20
days of a six-month federal
sentence for misdemeanor
election-law violations.
In 1976, the California Sup
reme Court slapped him with a

two-year suspension of his
right to practice law, and he is
just now getting started as an
attorney dealing with corpo
rate matters.
He never wrote a Watergate
book, although approached by
several literary agents, because
he says he was too tar from the
center of the action to provide
any of the "inside scoop."
The friendly, outgoing Seg
retti said he recalled
Washington Post reporters Bob
Woodward and Carl Bernstein
were very interested in him be
cause they thought he knew
more about Watergate than he
really did. They came to the
West Coast to visit him several
times, and Bernstein, espe
cially, was "quite pushy," Seg
retti said.
He hasn't seen either repor
ter since their book came out.
"You'd think I'd get a free tic
ket to the movie or an autog
raphed copy of the book," he
joked.
