44 That happy face belongs to my friend Cecil Andrus'
daughter Tracy. Lately people say there's something new
about her smile. Something I understand better than
anyone. When I wasn't much older than Tracy, I beat
cancer too.

Almost 30 years separate our victories. Years
that brought major advances in the treatment of cancer.
When I was fighting for my life, Tracy's chances wouldn't
have been good. Then most people with Hodgkin's disease,
people like Tracy, died within 5 years.
But your generosity helped change things.
You funded research that developed new treatments.
Treatments that saved Tracy's life. Now she's leaving her
job as a legislative assistant and going back to our home
state of Idaho. Back to school. Back to a life that's much
dearer for nearly having lost it.
Tracy and I aren't unique. Almost 2 million
Americans have beaten cancer. But much still remains to
be done. Through research, rehabilitation and education,
the American Cancer Society is making your contributions
count.
