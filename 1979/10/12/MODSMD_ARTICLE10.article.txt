# BUG ME
## 
### Andrew Rich 
Okay - it's Friday. Let's see, I have this from
one reader: "The Daily doesn't need another
column that prints dirty jokes and advice to the
lovelorn. What we really need is Bug Me. There
are so many questions that need real answers,
why not continue your great answering service?
Here's one for you: Why can't they pave Palm
Drive? Thanks.
- lust another minority.
According to Facilities Engineer John Lerry,
this is a popular question. Service Operations is
aware that the road between El Camino and the
Quad is rough and bumpy and badly crowned,
but there are not immediate plans to remedy
this.
The problem is that the existing surface is a
very hard-wearing road: it just doesn't wear out
completely. So the solution would be "essen
tially to remove it and reconstruct it," Lerry said.
This would be a major undertaking, of which
"the cost is in the neighborhood of a million
dollars," said Lerry. "It's in the ten-year plan but
it's just not a priority," he added.
No resurfacing on Palm
The ten-year-plan, as Lerry puts it, is "what
we'd like to do if we could accumulate the
funds." However, the million spent on Palm
Drivewould bea million taken from other, more
immediate problems.
Highest on the priority list right now are pro
jects like Serra Street and the Galvez Mall, which
will make the center of campus more accessible
to pedestrians and bicycles.
"Obviously, it would be nice to put Palm
Drive into shape," Lerry said, adding that the
University will probably work on it within the
next decade. In the meantime, the bumps at
least keep traffic down to a reasonable
speed.
Apropos of nothing in particular, a young
woman who spends a good deal of time on the
phone asked about the possible number of
telephone numbers in the nation. I guess she's
hit a lot of wrong ones.
Well, according to a Pacific Telephone

spokesman, there are over 1 billion numbers
available in the United States. Nowhere near all
of these are being used, but if they were, you
could dial at least one wrong number every mi
nute for the entire four years you were at the
University.
Telephones
More dazzling statistics: Pacific Telephone
has about 15Va million subscribers in their do
main, which covers most of California and
Nevada. But this isn't such a big number next to
the approximately 160 million telephones in this
nation.
The greatest saturation of dialing machines is
in Washington D.C., where there are 3 tele
phones for every 2 people. Our own Palo Alto
ranks up there near the top with more than
192,000,000 phone numbers.
If you think you make a lot of calls, divide your
annual average into the 200 billion calls made
nationwide in 1977, the most recent year availa
ble.
Something else you probably didn't know: it
was exactly 100 years ago that the first phone vyas
installed in the south Bay Area (between South
San Francisco and Monterey). In one quick cen
tury that number has escalated more than a
million. Like rabbits, those things.
Here's a chance for reader participation.
Guess, in order, the four most often called
foreign countries from the U.S.
To fill the space between the question and the
answer, here's our Preppie Joke of the Week:
How many Preppies does it take to screw in a
light bulb? The answer of course is two. One to
hold the Gin and Tonics and one to call'the
electrician.
Ready? Canada, Mexico, and a tie for third
between England and West Germany.
