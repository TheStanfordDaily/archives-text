## Facing Holocaust II? 
### 
When Hitler assumed power
in Germany in 1933, there were
an estimated eleven million
European Jews. By the end of
Hitler's reign in 1945, after Au
schwitz and the Final Solution,
six million lews had been ex
terminated. What did the
world do? What did America
do?
Today, there is a small coun
try in Southeast Asia called
Kampuchea. To most Ameri
cans, it was known as Cam
bodia.
When the Americans left in
April 1975, the Khmer Rouge
assumed power. That govern
ment promptly launched its
own version of the holocaust.
Less than half remain
Although no one is quite
sure, there were an estimated
8-10 million Cambodians in
1975. Now there are fewer than
4 million.
Every doctor, teacher, en
gineer, and former soldier of
the previous regime was au
tomatically sentenced to
death. Today, one estimate
places the number of practic
ing doctors in the country at
sixty.
According to refugees and
foreign visitors, there are very
few children under the age of
five in the country.
Fortunate to be shot
In 1975, the Khmer Rouge
forced the entire population in
Phnom Penh, some 3 million
people, to leave the city. Those
who did not leave or move fast
enough were executed.
Everyone in every city was
marched out to the rural areas.
Working went on in the
fields from dawn to dusk. Any
one who broke the rules w u s
automatically executed.
Those who were shot were
considered fortunate. Those
less fortunate were buried in
the ground up to their shoul
ders and beaten to death.
If it is hard for you to vis
ualize this holocaust, try to pic
ture the entire population of
Chicago being forced out of
the city.
Try to imagine the deaths of
half of the population of New
York City by execution, starva
tion, and disease.
Try to think of a country
where there are no private
telephones, no medicines, no
money, no religion, and no
universities.
Try to conceive of not just a
friend of yours dyini> but the

death of 50 percent of
everyone you know, including
your parents, brothers, sisters,
and friends.
It happens now
I tell you about these horrors
not because it is a lesson in his
tory. It is not history— the
dying still continues.
Despite the Vietnamese in
stallation of the Heng Samrin
government or perhaps be
cause of it, Kampuchea is in the
midst of a vast famine.
The present shortage of
food, already low due to the
economic practices of the
Khmer Rouge and aggravated
by the fighting between the
Vietnamese and remnants of
Pol Pot's army, means that 2.5
million out of the 4 million sur
viving Cambodians might die
from starvation over the next
few months.
Mass starvation
In the face of impending
mass starvation, what will the
world do?
What will Americans do?
Will they take the attitude of
one letter-writer to News week,
"I am sick, sick, sick of Viet
nam, the boat people and
Southeast Asia . . . Instead of
bringing in 14,000 Indochinese

(a month) and spending half a
billion dollars on them in a
year, we should spend the
money on our own refugees."
Or will Americans accept the
fact that a life is a life, whether
it be Cambodian, Vietnamese,
(ewish, black, or white?
Not only would humanita
rian grounds call for the U.S. to
help out, but William Shaw
cross, in Sideshow: Kissinger,
Nixon and the Destruction of
Cambodia, charges that U.S.
policy led to the Khmer Rouge
takeover and subsequent hor
ror.
There is not much time to
prepare relief efforts. The In
ternational Committee of the
Red Cross and Unicef have to
raise $10() million in relief aid.
Will you help?
You can offer your labor, fi
nancial, or even moral sup
port. You can send contribu
tions to the American Red
Cross. You can write your con
gressman and let him/her
know that you care and want
something done.
Or you can watch a people
fade into extinction.

When the Americans left in
April 1975, the Khmer Rouge
assumed power. That govern
ment promptly launched its
own version of the holocaust.
Less than half remain
Although no one is quite
sure, there were an estimated
8-10 million Cambodians in
1975. Now there are fewer than
4 million.
Every doctor, teacher, en
gineer, and former soldier of
the previous regime was au
tomatically sentenced to
death. Today, one estimate
places the number of practic
ing doctors in the country at
sixty.
According to refugees and
foreign visitors, there are very
few children under the age of
five in the country.
Fortunate to be shot
In 1975, the Khmer Rouge
forced the entire population in
Phnom Penh, some 3 million
people, to leave the city. Those
who did not leave or move fast
enough were executed.
Everyone in every city was
marched out to the rural areas.
Working went on in the
fields from dawn to dusk. Any
one who broke the rules w u s
automatically executed.
Those who were shot were
considered fortunate. Those
less fortunate were buried in
the ground up to their shoul
ders and beaten to death.
If it is hard for you to vis
ualize this holocaust, try to pic
ture the entire population of
Chicago being forced out of
the city.
Try to imagine the deaths of
half of the population of New
York City by execution, starva
tion, and disease.
Try to think of a country
where there are no private
telephones, no medicines, no
money, no religion, and no
universities.
Try to conceive of not just a
friend of yours dyini> but the

death of 50 percent of
everyone you know, including
your parents, brothers, sisters,
and friends.
It happens now
I tell you about these horrors
not because it is a lesson in his
tory. It is not history— the
dying still continues.
Despite the Vietnamese in
stallation of the Heng Samrin
government or perhaps be
cause of it, Kampuchea is in the
midst of a vast famine.
The present shortage of
food, already low due to the
economic practices of the
Khmer Rouge and aggravated
by the fighting between the
Vietnamese and remnants of
Pol Pot's army, means that 2.5
million out of the 4 million sur
viving Cambodians might die
from starvation over the next
few months.
Mass starvation
In the face of impending
mass starvation, what will the
world do?
What will Americans do?
Will they take the attitude of
one letter-writer to News week,
"I am sick, sick, sick of Viet
nam, the boat people and
Southeast Asia . . . Instead of
bringing in 14,000 Indochinese

(a month) and spending half a
billion dollars on them in a
year, we should spend the
money on our own refugees."
Or will Americans accept the
fact that a life is a life, whether
it be Cambodian, Vietnamese,
(ewish, black, or white?
Not only would humanita
rian grounds call for the U.S. to
help out, but William Shaw
cross, in Sideshow: Kissinger,
Nixon and the Destruction of
Cambodia, charges that U.S.
policy led to the Khmer Rouge
takeover and subsequent hor
ror.
There is not much time to
prepare relief efforts. The In
ternational Committee of the
Red Cross and Unicef have to
raise $10() million in relief aid.
Will you help?
You can offer your labor, fi
nancial, or even moral sup
port. You can send contribu
tions to the American Red
Cross. You can write your con
gressman and let him/her
know that you care and want
something done.
Or you can watch a people
fade into extinction.

When Hitler assumed power
in Germany in 1933, there were
an estimated eleven million
European Jews. By the end of
Hitler's reign in 1945, after Au
schwitz and the Final Solution,
six million lews had been ex
terminated. What did the
world do? What did America
do?
Today, there is a small coun
try in Southeast Asia called
Kampuchea. To most Ameri
