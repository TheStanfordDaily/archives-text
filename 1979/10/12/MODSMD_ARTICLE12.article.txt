## Debra Leigh Egypt, Israel working toward peace 
### 
For the first time in over
thirty years, the first step has
been made by a single Arab na
tion towards peace and recog
nition of Israel, the state estab
lished by the United Nations in
1948.
After 31 years, during which
Israel was forced to defend
herself against four "wars of
extermination," one of her
neighbors has joined her in
saying "The bloodshed must
end, we must have peace.''
Egypt has taken that first step
towards cooperation and
friendship, open borders,
trade agreements, normalized
relations.
Egypt and Israel have agreed
that, by working with each
other, by creating rather than
destroying, the Middle East
could blossom.
Begin and Sadat are two
brave men.

Begin has taken grave risks,
both for himself politically and
for his country's economy and
defense, by unilaterally giving
up vast territories captured â€”
not in a war of aggression but a
war of defense.
And Sadat? Sadat has
jeopardized his position in the
Arab world and essentially iso
lated himself by daring to make
peace.
Why does the rest of the
Arab world so bitterly oppose
the idea of peace with Israel?
Even the so-called "moderate"
Arab country of Saudi Arabia
has threatened to cut Egypt off
from all economic assistance as
punishment for the peace tre
aty.
The usual reason given is
that only when Israel with
draws to its pre-1%7 borders
and the PLO (called "the sole
legitimate representation of

the Palestinian people") is
given an independent Palesti
nian Arab nation to govern can
there be peace.
Yet this cannot be the true
reason. Four-fifths of historic
Palestine already exists as an
independent Arab nation, Jor
dan, where Palestinian Arabs
have full citizenship.
Of the one-fifth of Palestine
which remained in 1947 (after
four-fifths were artificially se
vered in 1921 to create Jordan),
the United Nations partitioned
that remaining 1/5 into a Pales
tinian Jewish state, Israel, anda
second Palestinian Arab state.
The surrounding Arab na
tions re/used to accept the par
tition plan, attacked Israel, and
Jordan captured the fertile
West Bank, which was to be the
bulk of the second Arab Pales
tine.
From 1948 until 1967, the
West Bank was in Jordanian

PLO's goal is nothing more or less than the
total destruction of the state of Israel

hands, and never was a cry
heard for the establishment of
a second independent Arab
Palestine.
For 19 years Israel remained
at its "pre-1%7" borders. Had
there been no Arab attacks in
1967 and 1973, Israel would still
be at its pre-1%7 borders.
Why was Israel attacked?
If all problems would be sol
ved if Israel were to withdraw
to its pre-1967 borders, then
why was Israel attacked in
1967?
Obviously there is more to
the rejectionist Arab position
than the desire for Israel to
withdraw to its pre-1967 bor
ders and to establish an inde
pendent Palestinian state on
the West Bank.
For 19 years, there was no*
thing to stop them from creat
ing exactly that situation, yet
no such move was made in that
direction.
Perhaps the best answer can
be given by examining the

charter of the PLO, which ha;
been designated by Syria
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Libya, anc
most other Arab governments
as the sole legitimate represen
tative of the Palestinian
people.
The PLO charter states:
"The liberation of Palestine,
from an Arab viewpoint, is a
national duty to . . . purge the
Zionist presence from Pales
tine." (Article 15)
. . the partitioning of
Palestine in 1947 and the estab
lishment of Israel is fundamen
tally null and void . . ." (Article
19)
. .Armed struggle is the
only way to liberate Palestine
and therefore is a strategy and
not tactics." (Article 9)
. . The Palestinian Arab
people rejects all plans that aim
at the settlement of the Palesti
nian issue . . ." (Article 21)
In other words, its goal is no-

thing more or less than the
total destruction of the State of
Israel. And this, too, is the goal
of the Arab nations who
wholeheartedly support the
PLO and who sabotage the ef
forts of Begin and Sadat to
make peace.
Those who wish to point the
finger of blame towards any na
tions in the Middle East should
point it hard and accusingly at
those nations who are choos
ing and aiding in bloodshed
over peace, terrorism over
mutual cooperation, thereby
endangering the lives of mill
ions of innocent Arabs and Is
raelis.
Those people who, now, at
the crossroads for a potential
peace, are choosing only to ac
cuse the peacemakers ot hor
rible crimes and wrongdoing,
are themselves contributing fo
the continuation of war and
bloodshed in the Middle East.
