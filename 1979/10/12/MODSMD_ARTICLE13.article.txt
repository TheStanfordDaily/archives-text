Sexist, big deal
"When correctly viewed,
everything is lewd,' says Tom
Lehrer. The old cliche words it:
"beauty is in the eyes of the
beholder."
Is that Dos Equis poster re
ally sexist? Yes, no, maybe,
who cares? It is designed to
catch the masculine eye; after
all, who drinks more beer?
The real crime of the poster
is as Rod Stevens (Daily, Oct. 8)
mentioned, one of litter, and
of wasted paper. However,
some persons feel that it is a
crime against women.
We know this because the
very next day those posters
were defaced with the motto
"A CRIME AGAINST WOMEN"
and plastered all over campus.
This type of reactionary,
feministic propaganda really
annoys me.
For one, it is an eyesore,
which ends up as litter. Sec
ondly, the principle; that
poster is only a misdemeanor
compared to the Freudian
felonies commited against
men (and women) in everyday
life.
This crime is termed "teas
ing" in the vernacular,
other things in the locker
room.
Now let's put this into
perspective. Just sit in the stu
dent section at a football game,
one can't help but notice the
scanty attire on the feminine
student's body. Some of those
outfits do not even challenge
men's imagination, rather they
lay bare the facts of that girl's
figure. (Also bare, or almost
bare, are parts of her
anatomy!)
This is the moral equivalent
of putting food just beyond the
reach of a starving animal.
Guys do not like to be teased.
It's even worse when one is
sitting in the hot sun and drink
ing beer. White Plaza in the
spring time is just as bad.

Those ladies (?) would be agh
ast if they heard what guys say
to each other as they pass by.
This type of crime is really
mean since it affects innate de
sires, and we can't help but
think lustful thoughts. Heck,
even our Southern Baptist
president lusts after women.
I hope that I have not made
too many enemies with this let
ter. Take it with a grain of salt as
you eat breakfast. The gist of
my message is that even if that
poster is sexist — so what!
Its sexual implications are
trivial in comparison to other
acceptable "crimes" commit
ted everyday against both
sexes. Being a liberated male, I
am only able to present a mas
culine point of view and would
welcome one from a member
of the gentler gender.

As an alumnus of UC Davis
and a resident of Palo Alto I
would like to comment on
Bobbe Lacerda's article ("Woe
the travails . . .") dated Oc
tober 5, 1979. I was rather sur
prised to read of such un
necessary mishaps, hazards
and general dangerous situa
tions with regards to bicycle
riding on the Stanford campus.
Granted the contents of
his/her letter are somewhat
exaggerating the actual state of
affairs, it still remains that
some action should be taken at
the University.
Couldn't Stanford look to
one excellent and one fairly
decent example of bicycle
safety and path construction to
solve some of their problems?
For instance, the City of Davis
(including UCD) and the City
of Palo Alto.
I attended UC Davis for four
years and never had a single
bicycle mishap. I may be a rar

ity in that many ot my col
leagues had one or two bad
bike experiences. However, I
can honestly say the bicycle
safety in Davis and on the UCD
campus is quite remarkable.
You mayor may not be famil
iar with the ratio of licensed
bicycles to citizens of Davis
(27,000-30,000): it is almost
one-to-one.
With this figure in mind, one
might think there would be
many hassles in the Davis
realm of bike riding.
Not so. With well labeled
bike paths, courteous bicyc
lists and bike loops, bike
riding at Davis is indeed a plea
sure and a well used mode of
transportation.
As for the City of Palo Alto
one can readily observe the
many bike paths and sidewalk
renovations which accom
modate the bicyclest.
Perhaps the University
"Bicycle Safety Commission"
could learn from these two
examples of "Bicycle Towns"
and make recommendations
for the Stanford Campus.
Happy biking is a possibility,
ask any Davis graduate!

Teller at issue
I would like to take issue
with Edward Teller's remarks at
the SALT debate of Oct. 5. He
implied that scientists should
be encouraged to spend more
time on military applications
and less on pure research.
Given the tremendous re
sources (both talent and
money) that the world has col
lectively spent on weapons
production, one is tempted to
question Teller's position.
The past two decades have
taught us that mutually assured
destruction does not provide a
safer world or an end to the
arms race. The record would
tend to indicate the opposite.
Certainly there are construc
tive enterprises more deserv
ing of our limited resources.
Scientists have a unique abil
ity to determine the future
course of the arms race, as Tel
ler's comments imply. This
ability, however, must be tem
pered with responsibility.
Scientists should be encour
aged to think realistically about
the potential usefulness or de

structiveness of their work,
and to make decisions about
future work on that basis.
I hope the image of scientists
fiendishly creating weapons of
destruction is not further ac
tualized in Teller's call for in
creased military research.

Crazy S.F.
San Francisco is a city of
crazies.
I never used to believe this. I
never used to allow this pro
nouncement to pass without
vigorous rebuttal. But I'm not
so sure anymore. In fact, I
don't think I can defend this
city and its colorful characters
any more.
You see, the characters are
no longer harmless kooks, as I
once thought of them. Some of
them are now angry, dis
turbed, and violent.
I say this because of what I
felt last Saturday as I walked up
to a police barricade at Seventh
and Market. Two blocks away,
from a sixteenth floor window,
a furious man had been spray
ing bullets onto the street for
hours.
I'd learned about this from
banner headlines at corner
newsstands, and from people
on re-routed buses who were
exchanging speculations: "He
wants a million dollars to give
to ghettoes." "He's got a
timebomb strapped to him." I
learned quickly about the furi
ous man, because he was con
trolling all of us on the streets
below.
The police had blocked off
Market to traffic and pedest
rians. The drunks, whom
they'd dragged to safety, now
slumped against different
doorways a block away.
As I stood at the barricade, I
watched the wind blow sheets
of newspaper down the de
serted street and I thought of
the last scene from a movie
about the end of the world.
In the movie they had sym
bolized, I suppose, the last
pathetic remnants of civiliza
tion, but now the papers just
drifted slowly down sidewalks
that we were afraid to walk on.
I used to love San Francisco.
I'd snapped photographs of

saxophonists who stood in
front of Woolworth's display
windows. I'd given directions
to British tourists looking for
Chinatown. I'd made silly faces
at babies in Union Square.
But last Saturday, I felt some
thing very different, very
wrong about the city. I think it
was fear.
I think that one man with his
gun had killed something very
small, but very important in
me. I cannot speak for all the
men and women who live in or
pass through San Francisco, I
only know how the sniper on
the sixteenth floor made me
feel.
The newspapers tumbled in
the gutters and I very much
wanted to cry.

New religious era
It seems that there are tem
poral equivalents to those vast
geological "plates" which
cover the globe and at the
juncture of which deep
changes occur.
The monarchic and Christian
era which ended roughly in the
early 18th century was fol
lowed by the Enlightenment
and what Camus, after
Nietzsche, called its attempt to
install a "horizontal religion"
on the earth.
But that pragmatic and
democratic drive for transcen
dence (laterally) has run into a
wall: the world is no longer
open to infinite drives. It has
shrunk drastically, and the
stark realities of rising global
competition, forced co
existence in a nuclearage, etc.,
have pulled the rug out from
under that "myth," "mind-set"
(or episteme, to speak like
Michael Foucault).
That is why our intellectual
leaders have confessed total
confusion and why, despite
the Kennedy magic, Teddy
seems hopelessly vestigial all of
a sudden to thinking people.
This helps greatly to explain
the new importance of relig
ion: man's infinite aspiration
can go again, as it did two
myths ago (with some modifi
cations, to he sure) vertically,
in the form of sacred belief,
concern for the deeply per

sonal and qualitative dimen
sion of life, major artistic crea
tion and the like.
Not that a new Christianity or
whatever future faith can or
will scant the fraternal dimen
sion, love of and concern for
the fellow being, but the em
phasis, in a Pope arising from
the drably flattened perspec
tive of communism — which
has demonstrated even to

theory-prone French youth the
bankruptcy of a once-proud
dream — has naturally
changed to the primary axis of
any full religion: man's relation
to the beyond or totality.
So it appears to many of us
that Pope )ohn Paul II has come
at the right time.
