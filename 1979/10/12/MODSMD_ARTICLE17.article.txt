# Nevada site hides U.S. military might, testing

Las Vegas, Nev. (AP) — From a passing car,
clues are few. Craters gape here and there. An
occasional sign, prominently posted on a fence,
warns of radioactivity.
It is the desolate Nevada Test Site, a scant
two-hour drive from the bustling Las Vegas Strip
and the scene of some of the world's most awe
some displays of military might.
Sprawled over 1350 square miles of arid,
sage-dotted desert and rugged mountai n s — an
area roughly the size of Rhode Island — the test
site since 1951 has been jarred, shaken and bat
tered by 543 of the 670 nuclear tests announced
by the government. Not all tests are announced.
The power unleashed during 28 years of nuc
lear tests is beyond comprehension. At least
four of the warheads have been in the one
megaton range- equivalent to one million tons
of high explosive.
The total high explosive yield from the rest of
the shots is between 11 million tons and 80 mill
ion tons. The exact figure is classified. When the
Department of Energy announces a test now, it
usually says only that the warhead had a yield of
20-150 kilotons.
Explosive yield classified
By comparison, a single Soviet atmospheric
test on Oct. 30,1961, had a yield of 58 megatons -
58 million tons of high explosive, the largest
nuclear test ever conducted.
Nuclear blasts here would come to a halt if
accord is reached in the ongoing test ban
negotiations among the United States, the
Soviet Union and Britain. But Mahlon Gates —
the former Army brigadier general who heads
the test site — says it will be kept ready.
The DOE would have "to maintain a capability
for returning to underground tests" even if a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is approved,
Gates said.
"We would be required to return just as a
precaution if the other side, for example, viol
ated the treaty and returned to testing," he said.
"And I presume that there are other scenarios
that one could develop that might cause the
United States, for its own best interests, to re
turn to nuclear testing."
Test ban?
Gates believes chances of approval of a test
ban will improve if the embattled strategic arms
limitation treaty is ratified.
"I think the prospects of reaching an agree
ment with Russia are relatively high if the Senate
ratifies SALT II," he said. "Failure of ratification
of SALT 11, I would say, would cast some doubt

on the probability of reaching an accord on a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
The test shots are conducted for a variety of
reasons, Gates said in an interview. While a
"tremendous amount of work" is done in
laboratories to perfect nuclear devices, "the
bottom line still must be carried out — and that
is the actual test. One does not have sufficient
confidence yet in simulated testing to preclude
the necessity for actual testing."
All the tests are expensive, he said, ranging
from a low of $1.5 million to as much as $50
million. "There is no average," he added.
"For the most part our underground tests are
devoted to what we refer to as 'current
weaponization,' the finalization of a design for a
weapon that is on the drawing boards or indeed
in the manufacturing plants by the Department
of Defense," he said.
Big budget
Gates administers a $225 million budget and
heads a work-force of more than 5000 persons,
ranging from nuclear physicists to the well dril
lers and hard-rock miners who bury the
warheads deep underground.
Gates said that if nuclear testing is banned it
would cost only 800 to 1200 jobs.
Gates said the job gaps left by a test ban might
be filled by other projects, such as the "nuclear
garbage dump" for low-level radioactive waste
now operated at the site by the energy depart
ment. The waste, from various government
facilities, is buried in trenches.
The test site is under consideration as a site for
disposing of high-level radioactive waste —
spent fuel rods from power plants. A research
project aimed at determining the best methods
of storing the rods is now underway at the site.
Underground tests
Since 1962, all tests have been conducted un
derground. Earlier atmospheric tests, chiefly
those conducted in the mid-19505, sent radioac
tive fallout drifting across southern Nevada,
southern Utah and northern Arizona. About 600
claims have been filed by families of persons
stricken with various forms of cancer allegedly
linked to the fallout.
The underground tests boast a relatively clean
safety record. However, 21 shots have acciden
tally "vented" radioactivity. One federal law
suit, claiming two test site workers died of
cancer due to radiation from one such incident,
was tried earlier this year and has been taken
under submission by a judge.
