# Mayor tries to halt sex trade
## NYC to air 'John Hour' 
### 
New York (AP) — Names of men convicted of
patronizing prostitutes in New York are going to
be broadcast over the city-owned radio station,
says Mayor Fdward Koch, who hopes embar
rassment will do more to stop the sex trade than
some judges have.
"We're going to call it the ')ohn Hour,' " the
mayor said Tuesday, using the slang word for
those who hire prostitutes.
Koch said publicizing the names would be
similar to the early American custom of locking
lawbreakers in wooden stocks and putting them
on public display.
"That was a deterrent because who wants to
be in stocks," Koch said. "But we're not allowed
to put people in the stocks anymore, so instead,
what I'm going to do is to focus public attention
by putting their names in the stocks, meaning
reporting them on the radio," he said.
The city operates radio stations WNYC-AM
and FM. Sources close to the mayor said that no
specifics had been determined on the format of
such broadcasts or when they would start.
Koch also said he hoped newspapers would
print the names.
The mayor criticized judges for failing to en
force a two-year-old state law increasing the
penalties for customers of prostitutes to a

maximum 90 days in jail. He said many judges
"set their own standards on what the law should
be."
"I believe that it is unfair that we assess crimi
nal penalties for prostitutes, but that we don't
assess criminal penalties against the lohns, the
men who use prostitutes," Koch said.
The mayor said he came up with the proposal
after a survey of "john cases" handled by Man
hattan Criminal Court in April, May and )une
found that charges were dismissed in 311 of 384
cases.
Koch's proposal was praised by Queens Dis
trict Attorney John Santucci, but was criticized
by a religious leader and the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which supports eliminating
criminal penalties for prostitution.
Dorothy Samuels, NYCLU executive director,
said that while she admired Koch's attempt to
treat men and women equally, "judges should
not be trying cases under political pressure from
the Mayor. That's the real civil liberties issue
here."
The Rev. Howard Moody, pastor of the |udson
Memorial Church, called Koch's plan "atroci
ous." Moody, who has counseled prostitutes,
said the government should not get involved in
regulating sex between consenting adults.
