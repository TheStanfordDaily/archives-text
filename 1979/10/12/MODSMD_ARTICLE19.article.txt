# French restaurant is back

What do you do on a Satur
day night?
Party? Maybe.
Study? No.
Get cultured. What?
This Saturday evening — and
on the Saturday evenings to
come — students have the
chance to become cultured in a
cuisine of crepes.
Between 6 and 11 p.m., La
Maison Francaise (the French
House) will open La Creperie
for dining and entertainment.
La Creperie staff has prom
ised a casual, warm atmos
phere and an excellent menu
for all curious and starving per
sons— whet her or not they are
acquainted with French cul
ture.
"We call La Creperie a 'fine
dining experience,' " said
Head Chef Ira Daves, "but we
don't want people to feel like
they have to get dressed up to
come. We want them to relax
and have lots of tun."
Ah yes, the food. After taking
a gander at the menu, one
might say that food alone could
suffice both for the fun and the
meager student pocketbook.
For $1.25 to $2.45 an order, a
person will receive two crepes
with choice of vegetables, in
addition to a bowl of hot soup.
Cider is available as a recom
menced beverage (sorry, no
alcohol available).
To let customers share vic
ariously in the preparation of
the food, Daves said the crepes
will be cooked in the dining
room — a la Benihana's of To
kyo.
For people dropping by late
in the evening to dry up excess
party suds, La Creperie also
serves "dessert crepes," soup
or coffee.
Besides the culinary de
lights, Resident Fellow Kamal
Zein explained the cultural ac
tivities to coincide with the
cuisine. He said there would

be French music — some of it
played live by house members
— as well as slide shows and
films of France.
Zein said that part of the
move to have the entertain
ment came from the successful
Cafe Theatre held last fall quar
ter at La Maison Francaise. The
Theatre — a one-time affair —
presented a French play and
was followed — of course —
by a repast of crepes.
"We're using this form of en
tertainment to go beyond hav
ing just an ordinary restaur
ant," Zein said.
Another reason to bring La
Creperie to life was because of
the demands of students here
who remembered the previous

La Creperie, open at the
French House during the
1976-77 and 1977-78 school
years.
Though the previous Cre
perie was popular because of
its food, Maison resident
Dianne Cahoon said it folded
because it lacked sufficient
manpower. "Now," she said,
"more house members are in
volved, and this helps spread
the work a little more evenly."
Another change since the
days of the old Creperie is what
Cahoon called "a change of
atmosphere." La Creperie
used to be sort of a formal set
ting "where the maitre d' wore
a coat and tie." She added that

with the relaxed atmosphere of
music and entertainment, the
house hopes the new Creperie
will appeal to even more stu
dents than before.
The opening of La Creperie
will also take away the
monopoly of La Casa Italiana
(the Italian theme house)
which presently has the only
Saturday night theme house
eatery. La Creperie staff does
not seem to foresee any major
problems. Daves downplayed
the threat : "La Pizzeria didn't
hurt our business when we
were open before and we
didn't hurt theirs, so the com
petition doesn't matter that
much."
