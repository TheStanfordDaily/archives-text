The University has filed an appeal
with the California Occupational
Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) claiming that six of the seven
"serious" violations cited by the
agency last month were only "gen
eral" violations and should not carry
the $1000 mandated fine.
"There was no substantial health
hazard associated with the viola
tions, " said Gale Mondry, the Uni
versity's associate counsel. "The vio
lations should not have been clas
sified as serious."
General violations may or may not
carry tines.
1 he citations dealt with the storage
of chemical carcinogens which were
stored in non-regulated areas of the
Chemistry and Physics depts. and in
the Medical School.
OSHA regulations state thjt such
materials must be kept in regulated
areas, which include washing
facilities and changing rooms. The
University is claiming that because
the chemicals were onlv being stored
in the areas and were not used there,
there was no need for such facilities.
lack Sidlow, University manager of
health and safety, said there was no
evidence of chemical leakage in the
areas.
OSHA slapped the University with
a $3585 fine last month for the 18 vio
lations found by state industrial
hygenists Lawrence Wong and John
McGuire when they visited campus

several times over the past six
months.
Of these 18 violations, seven were
determined to be "serious" and car
ried a total SlOOO tine.
Most of the citations stemmed
from inadequate storage security for
dangerous chemicals and carcino
gens. For example, the hygenists
found a small vinyl chloride con
tainer left unused in a chemistry lab
and learned that proper labels had
not been placed on the cabinets,
drawers or shelves where carcino
gens were kept.
Other charges stemmed from the
University's failure to properly sec
ure containers ot concentrated ac ids
and bases in a physics laboratory, for
failure to promptly clean up a barium
oxide spill and for several instances
of keeping gas cylinders unchained
in storage areas.
Sidlow said that most ot the viola
tions have already been corrected.
The University has paid the $2585
for the undisputed violations, Mon
drv said.
UC-Berkeley was similarly cited tor
OSH A violations earlier this year. Of
ficials there are also appealing the
case.
•Neither Cal nor Stantord has been
given a hearing date before an ad
ministrative law |udge on the OSHA
appeals board.
"()ur arguments are verv similar,"
Mondry said. "We are very closely
.watching the progress of (Cal's)
case."
