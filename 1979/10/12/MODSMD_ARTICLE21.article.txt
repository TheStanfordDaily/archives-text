# Officials protect marijuana farmers on northern coast
## 
### 
Eureka (AP) — Officials along
California's isolated north
coast, worried about hurting
the local economy and offend
ing voters, have rejected a
$19,643 federal grant aimed at
curbing the area's multi
million-dollar marijuana farm
ing industry.
Federal and state officials say
the area may be a major
supplier of potent sinsemilla
marijuana to the rest of the na
tion.
"Some people say that it
goes to the major metropolitan
areas," says Humboldt County
Supervisor Ervin Renner.
"Some people say it goes back
East. I wouldn't know."
Whether the eradication
program hurts the economy "is
a legitimate concern raised by
responsible businessmen,"
says another supervisor,
Danny Walsh, 32.
The county board rejected
the federal Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration

grant on Tuesday by a 3-2 vote.
The money was awarded in
August to the state for distribu
tion to sheriffs in Humboldt,
Lake, Del Norte and Men
docino counties.
Now Humboldt Sheriff Gene
Cox says he will continue local
raids guided by spotter aircraft.
The raids have already yielded
more than 10 tons of sinsemilla
this year — worth $1700 a
pound on the street or an esti
mated $34 million.
Cox says the sinsemilla first
sprang up in the remote
backwoods of Northern
California about eight years
ago. Now, he says, growers
from as far as Alabama move
into the area during the grow
ing season from April to Oc
tober to sow their illicit crop.
"It brings undesirable
characters into our county who
are not the best of citizens," he
added.
Official estimates of the 1978
sinsemilla crop in Humboldt

County range from the federal
government's $186 million to a
high of $900 million from a
lawyer who has represented
arrested pot growers.
No one really knows how
many growers there are, but
estimates in Humboldt County
range from 2000 to 10,000 per
sons involved. Last year,
county authorities seized 8.5
tons of marijuana.
"If we killed every plant in
the county we will still have
people smoking marijuana and
getting it from other places,"
says Sara Parsons, one of the
supervisors who voted to re
ject the federal money.
Renner and Board Chairman
Harry Pritchard voted to accept
the federal grant.
Pritchard says some con
stituents are worried about in
creasing marijuana use in
schools. On the other hand, he
says, "I've got a lot of voters
raising it."
