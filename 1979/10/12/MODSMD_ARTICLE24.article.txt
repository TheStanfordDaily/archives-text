# Chinese students boycott classes

Peking (AP) — Calling for an
end to "warlords," 2500 uni
versity students and teachers
boycotted classes yesterday to
dramatize demands that the
army vacate their campus.
Students said they would
continue the boycott at
People's University, occupied
by army troops since 1972, until
the soldiers "give us back our
land," said Chen Chich
Chiang, 26, an English teacher.
The boycott was one of two
protests by students at Chinese
campuses. At nearby Peking
University, students criticized
what they called slum-like liv
ing and studying conditions
and threatened to strike next
Monday if university officials
do not agree to campus im
provements.
"We want soldiers of the
people — not warlords," said a

banner strung outside the
gates of People's University,
occupied by China's second ar
tillery force since 1972, when
the school was closed. The
army occupied many cam
puses throughout China and
closed many schools during
the last decade.
The People's University was
re-opened last year and the
army was to have left by August
1978. But the soldiers are reluc
tant to leave because of the
shortage of living space in the
capital.
"We want officials to see our
dormitories and kitchens —
would they dare bathe in our
bathrooms?" said a poster at
the nearby Peking University
campus.
Neither protest was reported
by China's official media
