# Stanford vs. number one USC
## Cards challenge king of hill 
### Chris Haft 
When asked what aspect of USC's na
tionally no.l-ranked team he feared most,
Stanford head coach Rod Dowhower re
sponded refreshingly. He laughed.
Dowhower and his Cardinals had better
do their laughing now, because once to
morrow's 1:30 p.m. encounter against the
Trojans begins in the Los Angeles Col
iseum, there won't be much time for
amusement.
USC, however, has amused itself thus
far with its 1979 schedule, chalking up a 5-0
overall and 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference re
cord while scoring almost exactly three
times as many points as its opponents.
"Our squad is doing okay to this point,"
Trojan head coach John Robinson under
stated. "I don't know that we've had great
competition (Texas Tech, Oregon State,
Minnesota, Louisiana State, Washington
State)."
When it comes to tailbacks, few col
legiate players can provide competition
for Charles White. Seventh on USC's all
time rushing list with 4314 yards, White has
gained 519 yards on 68 carries this season
despite missing nearly two games.
"Anyone can recognize what he has ac
complished," Robinson said of the 1978
unanimous All-American pick. "He's run
ning with the ball better than I've ever
seen him."
Dowhower had similar praise for White.
"If people were impressed with Freeman
McNeil (197 yards in 36 carries last week
against Stanford), they'll be impressed
with Charles White because he's quicker."
Dowhower displayed some quickness
of his own, speedily adding fullback Mar
cus Allen's name to the list of dangerous
Trojans. With 332 yards on 54 carries this
year, Allen may be the "best athlete of the
(USC) bunch," said Dowhower, who at
tempted to recruit Allen for Stanford.

It Shakespeare were a football fan, he
might say that past USC teams honored
passing in the breach rather than in the
observance,
That has changed with the arrival of Paul
McDonald at quarterback. McDonald,
who launched 19 touchdown aerials last
year, currently ranks first in Pac-10 pas
sing.
"McDonald is the finest quarterback
I've coached or known," Robinson said,
adding, "He's done a tremendous job. His
leadership and intelligence are the finest
I've seen."
The Trojan defense is just as effective as
its offensive counterpart. Inside linebac
kers Riki Cray, Dennis Johnson and Steve
Busick are particularly responsible for
USC's meager 11.8 points-per-game allo
wance.
It would be an improvement for the
Cards if they were to score 11.8 points
tomorrow. The Trojans have totally stifled
Stanford the past two years, winning 49-0
in 1977 and 13-7 in 1978.
"They've been very even games,"
Robinson said of the recent Stanford-USC
matchups. Then, obviously recalling the
1977 whitewash, Robinson added, "Well,
most of them have been very close."
"Close" was properly defined in last
week's 27-24 Stanford victory over UCLA.
Ken Naber's amazing 56-yard field goal
provided the winning margin, but many,
others were just as responsible for the
triumph — and equally solid perfor
mances will be required tomorrow if the
Cards are to have a chance against USC.
Stanford's defense, however, is any
thing but solid physically. The defense col
lectively resembles a prizefighter at the
end of a brutal 15-round bout — damaged
and sore.
Safety Kevin MacMillan (injured hip)
and cornerback Kick Cervais (ankle sp
rain), both impressive in last week's vie-

Tory, will probably miss tomorrow's game.
Linebacker Milt McColl < pinched shoulder
nerve) and nose guard Dennis Engel
(pinched neck nerve) remain questiona
ble.
Thus bereft of two key members of the
secondary, Dowhower has decided to use
split end-flanker Gordon Banks as a defen
sive back in certain situations.
At least the Cards have enough quarter
backs. Dowhower s two-quarterback sys
tem worked wonders against the Bruins,
as Turk Schonert completed 10 of 13 pas
ses (Schonert is behind only McDonald in
Pac-10 passing) and |ohn Elway en
gineered the winning drive in the fourth
quarter.
The first-year coach answered, "We'll
see," when asked if he would repeat last
week's plan of playing Schonert during the
first and third periods and Elway in the
second and fourth quarters. The only cer
tainty is that both quarterbacks will play.
Andre Hines, Brian Holloway and the
rest of the line will be trying to help Stan
ford improve on last year's sic kly total of V7
yards rushing against the Trojans.
White not Charles but Stanford's Vin
cent White — will try to solve that prob
lem. The 5-foot-9, 170-lb. freshman leads
the Cards in rushing, with 254 yards in 47
carries. White, who also has had 15 recep
tions this year, hauled in two touchdown
passes against U( I A last week.
There's no reason for White or the rest
of the Cards to run scared, though. So
what it (JSC is no. I So what it the Trojans
rank tirst in offense and third in defense in
the Pac-H)! 1 So what it 70,000 people,
mostly Trojan fans, will be screaming for
blood in the Coliseum, repeating a custom
of centuries past?
It means that USC is damned tough,
that's what. The Cards will have to play t he
game of their lives tomorrow to even come
close to winning.

On his patented sweep left, freshman tailback Vincent White (22) is being chased by UCLA linebacker
Larry Hall (41) and strong safety Brian Baggott (8). White caught seven passes for 113 yards and two
touchdowns as well as running for 62 yards in Saturday's 27-24 win over the Bruins.
