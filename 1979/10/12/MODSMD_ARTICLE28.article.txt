# Poloists brace for tough weekend
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
"It is without a doubt the
toughest weekend we will play
this season," said Stanford
water polo coach Dante De
ttamanti of the team's road trip
this weekend to the land of
smog and sun.
This afternoon in Los
Angeles, the Cards will get a
rematch with the UCLA Bruins,
who ended Stanford's home
pool winning streak last
weekend with a stunning 9-7
upset at deGuerre Pool. To
morrow, the defending na
tional champions will face USC
for the first time this year.
"For both of them," said De
ttamanti, "we are the only
Pac-10 game they have to pre
pare for this weekend. We

have to prepare for both of
them."
Though Stanford is hoping
to avoid a repeat of last Satur
day's fiasco, Dettamanti said
his team is not really going to
do anything different against
the Bruins.
"We've made some adjust
ments on offense and defense
on the extra-man situation," he
'■aid, "but basically we're just
going to concentrate on play
ing our game. If we do that,
they shouldn't get more than
five goals. We plan on getting
seven to 10 goals every game
we play."
Surprisingly, Dettamanti
said he considers tomorrow's
contest against the Trojans to
be the tougher of the two this
weekend. USC, which has all

its players from last year return
ing, has beaten UCLA this year
and is ranked fourth in the
country behind California,
Stanford and UC-Santa Bar
bara.
"They're strong in all areas
(of the game)," said De
ttamanti. "They've got good
speed, a good goalie in lack
Graham (who went to the
World University Games this
year) and they're strong in the
hole with Greg Fultz."
Past Stanford-USC games
have been marked by much
physical intensity, occasionally
bordering on grossness in the
case of a few Trojan players.
But Dettamanti said the USC
team, which has played to
gether now for two years, is
playing with a little more

finesse this year. But, he ad
ded, "they always play with a
lot of intensity."
The Cards' conference re
cord stands at 1-1 going into
the weekend's contests. Their
win came against Arizona two
weeks ago, and the loss from
UCLA.
"Sometimes a loss helps,"
Dettamanti said. "It takes the
pressure off as tar as the win
ning streak is concerned and it
makes you (the players) pay a
little more attention in prac
tice. It gets you out of being
complacent."
Dettamanti noted that the
team's attitude in practice this
week has been very good.
"We're ready to play two
good games," he said.
