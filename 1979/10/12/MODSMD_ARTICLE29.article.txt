# A 						survivor recalls (with relief) the Trojan invasion of 1978
## 
### Alex Alben 
Editor's note: The author de
cided to chronicle his wander
ings through and around Stan
ford Stadium early last
November when USC, which
he determines to he one of the
best pro teams in the country,
visited the Farm.

The University of Southern
California football team did not
travel to Stanford in a team
bus; it traveled in an armor
plated troop carrier.
The USC players did not
need to put on spikes before
Saturday's game; they merely
sharpened the nails, that are
driven into their soles at the
beginning of each season.
The USC Athletic Depart
ment did not print up a con
ventional color program to an
nounce its lineup; they
employed the Luftwaffe to
drop leaflets into the Stanford
Stadium.
Before the game, I had an
opportunity to observe (from a
secure place) the USC players
indulge in that masochistic
ting-dance colloquially
iviiown as "warm-up." Each
USC player was taking turns
banging a partner's helmet
with a telephone pole. This tac
tic, although it was outlawed
by the Geneva Convention, is
used to "psyche-out" the op
posing team.
Shifting my gaze 45 degrees
upward, I observed, swaying in
the early afternoon breeze, the
four trees otherwise known as
the USC offensive line. Their
names: Hunter, Van Home (as
in gore?), Budde, Peters, How
ell and Page. Ray Peters, the

center, is the onlv one of these
redwoods under 6-foot-5 and
250 pounds. I account for this
fact in the following way: Ray's
skull, in its four-year tenure ot
head-on collisions with defen
sive linemen, has been im
pounded in that soft space be
tween shoulder pads formerly
known as "the neck."
It is Peter's job, with minimal
interference from quarterback
Paul McDonald, to transfer the
ball to number 12, Charles
White. White is only 5-feet-11
and weighs 183 pounds. How
ever, to say that he is small by
football standards necessarily
ignores Einstein's laws of mo
tion, which explain how
energy is converted to infinite
mass at extraterrestrial speeds.
The Trojan leaflets use the
term "tailback," to describe
White's function. The 'SC
coaches realize that the word
disguises his awesome leaping
ability, and chose it to prevent
the Kremlin from insisting on
counting White as a strategic
nuclear launcher, or warhead,
or both.
On the other side of the
field, the Stanford team was
equally intense in its prepara
tion. Newly converted fullback
Gordon Banks was kneeling
over a chart. Darrin Nelson was
embroiled in a discussion with
Ken Margerurn. Steve Dils, —
that paradigm of athletic pro
wess, was hunched over a
book.
Capitalizing on the intellec
tual approach to football, no
doubt, I surmised. The USC
advantage in physique will be
more than compensated for by

our trick plays, subtle ca
dences and complex forma
tions.
Coach Walsh, his silver hair
in disarray, stomped down the
sideline and disrupted the
back field study group.
"Guys," he pleaded, "your
Econ. 1 midterm isn't until
Tuesday! "
In despair, I fled from the
warm-up session, out the
stadium gates and to the
nearest tailgater.
I surveyed the spread: platters

of shrimp and bluepoint oys
ters, trays of tiny chicken legs
and miniature franks rolled in
bacon, and a bar stocked with
enough booze to incite a court
injunction from Alcoholics
Anonymous.
Needless to say, I indulged.
Soon, the proximity of the USC
team, the vast intake of alcohol
and my grossly overfed
stomach combined to produce
a terrible flashback:
I was seated in the bleachers
of the L.A. Coliseum exactly a

year ago. Sharing a Hefty
trashbag raincoat with me was
a dormmate, who suffered
from a terminal craving for
spicy Chinese food and the
breath to match his affliction.
We had journeyed down to
the Southland only to be
greeted by thundershowers,
which made their appearance
20 minutes before kick-off
time. Seeing the rainclouds
form as I entered the stadium, I
had spotted a kio in a
white 1-shirt. In a supreme act

of charity I had given him my
two extra tickets. The kid had
proceeded to unload the tic
kets to a scalper for eight bucks
a shot.
Stanford lost the game by a
score of 49-0, but the point
spread doesn't begin to mea
sure how poorly we played.
Custer had done better at Little
Bighorn. The Trojans took no
survivors. Guy Benjamin had
escaped by producing a signed
contract with Miami and the
promise that he would pass to

the drafted USC players it
Dolphin training camp.
The memory of that drear
day made me shiver. "Thosi
who don't remember the pas
. . I thought, recalling tht
hackneyed admonition. I con
eluded that my time could b<
better spent studying, thar
watching the last statistica
chance for a Stanford Rost
Bowl invitation be lost as Isa
moaning in the stands. Be
sides, I could get a head start
on the competition for Econ. 1.

Editor's note: The author de
cided to chronicle his wander
ings through and around Stan
ford Stadium early last
November when USC, which
he determines to he one of the
best pro teams in the country,
visited the Farm.

The University of Southern
California football team did not
travel to Stanford in a team
bus; it traveled in an armor
plated troop carrier.
The USC players did not
need to put on spikes before
Saturday's game; they merely
sharpened the nails, that are
driven into their soles at the
beginning of each season.
The USC Athletic Depart
ment did not print up a con
ventional color program to an
nounce its lineup; they
employed the Luftwaffe to
drop leaflets into the Stanford
Stadium.
Before the game, I had an
opportunity to observe (from a
secure place) the USC players
indulge in that masochistic
ting-dance colloquially
iviiown as "warm-up." Each
USC player was taking turns
banging a partner's helmet
with a telephone pole. This tac
tic, although it was outlawed
by the Geneva Convention, is
used to "psyche-out" the op
posing team.
Shifting my gaze 45 degrees
upward, I observed, swaying in
the early afternoon breeze, the
four trees otherwise known as
the USC offensive line. Their
names: Hunter, Van Home (as
in gore?), Budde, Peters, How
ell and Page. Ray Peters, the

center, is the onlv one of these
redwoods under 6-foot-5 and
250 pounds. I account for this
fact in the following way: Ray's
skull, in its four-year tenure ot
head-on collisions with defen
sive linemen, has been im
pounded in that soft space be
tween shoulder pads formerly
known as "the neck."
It is Peter's job, with minimal
interference from quarterback
Paul McDonald, to transfer the
ball to number 12, Charles
White. White is only 5-feet-11
and weighs 183 pounds. How
ever, to say that he is small by
football standards necessarily
ignores Einstein's laws of mo
tion, which explain how
energy is converted to infinite
mass at extraterrestrial speeds.
The Trojan leaflets use the
term "tailback," to describe
White's function. The 'SC
coaches realize that the word
disguises his awesome leaping
ability, and chose it to prevent
the Kremlin from insisting on
counting White as a strategic
nuclear launcher, or warhead,
or both.
On the other side of the
field, the Stanford team was
equally intense in its prepara
tion. Newly converted fullback
Gordon Banks was kneeling
over a chart. Darrin Nelson was
embroiled in a discussion with
Ken Margerurn. Steve Dils, —
that paradigm of athletic pro
wess, was hunched over a
book.
Capitalizing on the intellec
tual approach to football, no
doubt, I surmised. The USC
advantage in physique will be
more than compensated for by

our trick plays, subtle ca
dences and complex forma
tions.
Coach Walsh, his silver hair
in disarray, stomped down the
sideline and disrupted the
back field study group.
"Guys," he pleaded, "your
Econ. 1 midterm isn't until
Tuesday! "
In despair, I fled from the
warm-up session, out the
stadium gates and to the
nearest tailgater.
I surveyed the spread: platters

of shrimp and bluepoint oys
ters, trays of tiny chicken legs
and miniature franks rolled in
bacon, and a bar stocked with
enough booze to incite a court
injunction from Alcoholics
Anonymous.
Needless to say, I indulged.
Soon, the proximity of the USC
team, the vast intake of alcohol
and my grossly overfed
stomach combined to produce
a terrible flashback:
I was seated in the bleachers
of the L.A. Coliseum exactly a

year ago. Sharing a Hefty
trashbag raincoat with me was
a dormmate, who suffered
from a terminal craving for
spicy Chinese food and the
breath to match his affliction.
We had journeyed down to
the Southland only to be
greeted by thundershowers,
which made their appearance
20 minutes before kick-off
time. Seeing the rainclouds
form as I entered the stadium, I
had spotted a kio in a
white 1-shirt. In a supreme act

of charity I had given him my
two extra tickets. The kid had
proceeded to unload the tic
kets to a scalper for eight bucks
a shot.
