First of all, may we pat ourselves on the back.
Sports editor Chris Haft picked Stanford to beat
UCLA last week 27-24. As you know, the final
score was . . . 27-24. Haft has picked an unbe
lievable 12 out of 13 winners thus far.
In the world of sports, there are winners and
there are losers. Heading into his fifth year as
head coach of the Stanford Cardinal basketball
squad, Dick Dißiaso has known the pleasure of
both winning and losing.
Giving him a chance to feel more pleasure,
The Stanford Daily has designated Dißiaso as
our Guest Greek of the Week. This is an interest
ing week, for it is the only one in which all teams
in the Pacific-10 Conference play amongst each
other. Dißiaso has met the challenge with some

interesting predictions. Here they are:
Oregon State at California: I don't think the
Beavers can beat the Bears, but I can't bring
myself to pick Cal. Call it a 0-0 tie.
Oregon at Arizona: Oregon is coming off a big
win over California but Arizona is coming off a
bigger week of rest. I'm going with Arizona,
17-14.
Washington at Arizona State: ASU was thrashed
last year (Washington 41-7) but they will find
revenge in a big upset, 14-13.
UCLA at Washington State: I'm going with the
Bruins, 31-10.
Stanford at USC: Without question, Stanford
24-17. We prove we can sustain our effort.
