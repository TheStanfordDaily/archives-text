# Friday Interview: John Robinson
## 
### 
In three-and-one-halt years, there have been one national
championship, three bowl wins, an overall record of 36 wins and
only six losses, and the pressure of being the head coach of a
national tootball power.
With all this weight on his shoulders, USC head coach John
Robinson has stood up remarkably well. Friday interviewer Sally
lenkins discussed with Robinson the trials and tribulations of
being the Trojan head coach.
lenkins: You took over at USC about three years ago, is that right?
Robinson: Right. I came here in 1976.
lenkins: Did you have any trouble following John McKay's
footsteps at alli
Robinson: No. I don't think so. Of course, there are always
people who sit back and say 'Who is this guy? He'd better be
good.' But I had every opportunity, I didn't have any real opposi
tion. It can be very intimidating though. The worst problem is that

you tend to find yourself talking yourselt into some negative
things. I tried to keep away from that type of thing. And of course
we had good results right off, so it was easier. It probably would
have been different if we had had a losing season.
Jenkins: What's the most gratifying aspect of coaching for you
right now?
Robinson: The most immediate thing is thebuilding of your team:
I think that's true of any coach, watching it grow and take shape.
Long range, I'd say the relationship with the players. You build up
a relationship with these guys over four years, and watch them
change, and grow and improve, that whole thing, being involved
with their development as human beings.
Jenkins: In that same vein, how would you characterize your
relationship with your players?

Robinson: It's certainly not an authoritarian thing. We talk a lot
about commitment, and respect tor one another. It's on those
kinds of lines. Authoritarianism is not what we want. We try and
deal with each other on a 'feelings' basis. I'm not saying that one
is better than theother. But if you're willing toapproach it, todeal
with people on a 'feelings' basis I think it can be very productive,
lenkins: Is there anything you don't like about coaching at this
pointf
Robinson: Probably the demands on my personal time. I spend a
lot of time recruiting, I give about 100 speeches a year, I spend an
enormous amount of time away from home. I have very little time
to devote to developing myself. I have resented that oc< tonally,
lenkins: USC has been accused ol being a football machine. Barry
Switzer of Oklahoma has said that he doesn 't object to that kind
of thing because at Oil the football tradition came first, before its
academic tradition started. What do you think about thatf
Robinson: Don't put us in the same category with OU. People
tend to think that because we have a fine football team that we
have the same amount of money to spend, or time (to spend).
Actually, if you looked at the Stanford and USC budgets, I think
that you would find that they are fairly similar. It's the same with
the amount of time we spend recruiting. Our programs are fairly
similar. At Oklahoma it's like the state. To put us in that category,
that's not accurate.
The day-to-day life of a player here, at Cal and at Stanford is
about the same, in terms of the amount of time they spend in
class, the living conditions, the time they spend at practice,
lenkins: While you are comparing USC's and Stanford's programs,
how about comparing (USC quarterback and the nation 's leading
passer) Paul McDonald to Turk Schonert and John Elway?
Robinson: All three are outstanding players. Paul is leading the
nation in passing. I think Paul is asked to do different things on
our team, than your quarterbacks are at Stanford. He is more
involved with our running game, whereas at Stanford the quar
terback is more of a passer. I think both Schonert and Elway are a
little faster than Paul is. Paul is an accurate passer as well, of
course.
lenkins: Have you thought at all about going into pro ball as a head
coach?
Robinson: Well, I did some coaching at Oakland lor awhile as an
assistant. But as a head coach, I don't think so right now. Maybe
in a few years when my children are grown and out of the house.
But not until then, when I would have more time to put into it.
lenkins: USC has been on top for so long now; how much longer
do you expect it to last?
Robinson: I think there are normal cycles. I also think anyone in
California has a chance to be successful bee ause of the enormous
amount of talent out here. Cal is a very good team, UCLA, Stan
ford. They all have talent and of course there's the weather thing.
I don t see why we should limit it to years. I don't see why it
should fall off.
