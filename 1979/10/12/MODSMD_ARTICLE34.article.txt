# Scotchers shut out UOP; host matches tomorrow
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
The Stanford field hotkey
team continued their winning
ways, defeating the University
of Pacific team at Stockton
Wednesday, 5-0. The junior
varsity hockey team was also
victorious, beating American
River University 3-1 the same
day. The JV team thus remains
undefeated with a 6-0-2 record.
The Varsity holds a 6-1-0 win
loss record in their NorCal
League. Wednesday's victory
also confirmed the scotchers'
15th-place national ranking.
However, Saturday's home
games against NorCal rival
UC-Davis and Region 9 team
Washington State University
may favorably alter these
standings. The Women's Team
will meet Davis at 10 a.m. and
Washington State at i p.m. at
Roble Field.
I he also-fickle team stats
now rest at 15 goals scored by
Stanford, two taken by oppo
nents in six matches. Nancy

While, or "Whitey," leads the
teams' scoring with eight go
als. Three players, Kelly Wes
terwick, Lynn Keyser and Kathy
Nicholson, have put in two
goals eat ( Becky Howell and
Claudia ( ! I. id the assist list
with eight each m the season's
six games.
Wednesday s match with
UOP accounted for tive ot the
team goals, proving the suc
cess of the new personnel
combinations the team tried.
Stanford completely domi
nated the tirst half of the game,
taking 14 shots on goal and put
ting three in. "There was a real
flow to the play," head coach
Barbara Longstreth explained,
"and some impressive passing
combinations on both the
right-and left-hand sides of the
field."
In the second half of the
game, the line-up again
changed as three of this year's
rookies surfaced on the Varsity
tield. These line-up variations

the team experimented with
"answered a lot of questions,"
said Longstreth. What was
learned about optimum posi
tions and organization for the
team should prove beneficial
in this Saturday's double
header clash with Davis and
Washington State.
Davis, though a Division 3
team, is notoriously well
conditioned and much
improved from last year.
The scotchers' meeting with
Washington State should
prove to be an equally rigorous
game. Though Washington's
team is not a NorCal com
petitor, they are a Division 9
team. Recruits have been
sought from as far away as the
Canadian teams. Though Stan
lord did defeat Washington
State in the Oregon Invita
tional Tournament, it was only
by one goal. "They'll be good
teams," longstreth said.
"They'll both be tough, in
teresting matches."
