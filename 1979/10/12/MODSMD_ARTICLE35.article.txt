Brunch Sun. 11 a.m. — 2 p.m.
Before I begin, let me state
that I adore the New Varsity so
that those of you in cultural
limbo, unfamiliar with the
Mecca of greater Palo Alto,
may take my words with a grain
of salt. To the remaining read
ers who know the New Varsity
well, forgive me any under
statement.
The New Varsity, located
about one mile from campus at
456 University Avenue, is un
disputedly a class place to treat
that special someone to a

memorable evening of dining,
music and theater, but did you
ever think of suggesting cham
pagne brunch when you
awoke the morning after?
Entering the New Varsity's
courtyard on a lazy Sunday
morning, you are immediately
immersed in the relaxed at
mosphere of comfortable ele
gance. The hostess asks if
you've come for brunch. In a
deep, calmly assured voice,
suddenly spurred by a surge of
savoir faire, you answer, "Ta
ble for two please."
She shows you toyourchair:
Sean Connery. Quite right.
"Jacques Tati" is embroidered
on the back of your compan

ion's folding director's chair, a
silly mistake since they got
your seat right. But your com
panion doesn't notice and
coos, "Oh James!" She obvi
ously appreciates the best.
You browse through the
menu of select dishes, inhaling
the heady concotion of classi
cal guitar rifts, delicate aromas
and diners' din that swirls and
rises in the mediterranean sun
light streaming through the
white stucco arcade. From the
selection of before brunch
drinks, you can choose to sip
on an enormous Bloody Mary
or a refreshing pina colada.
The waitress arrives to take
your order, ludging from the
size of the crowd she has had a
busy morning, but the service
remains prompt and attentive.
Complimentary crullers, fresh
strawberries and a curious sour
cream rum sauce are served
along with the choice of a glass

of chablis or champagne while
you wait for your main dish.
Brunch is presented on a
simple earthenware plates.
Orange slices, sauteed fresh
vegetables and lyonnaise
potatoes garnish generous
helpings, making the repast a
feast for the eyes as well as the
taste buds.
The first bite reinforces
one's high opinion of this es
tablishment. For those with a
desire for something special
the eggs Deauville, seafood
quiche and frittata ravano are
all highly recommended. Eggs
and salmon poached and
placed on a bed of cream
spinach form the foundation of
the subtle eggs Deauville,
which is crowned with a hol
landaise sauce that comes
quite dose to perfection. The
seafood quiche, created with
an abundance of shrimp and
scallops, is an interesting adap

tation of Lorraine's famous
dish. Onions and spinach
blend sumptuously in the
souffle-style omelette dubbed
frittata ravano.
For more simple tastes and
tighter budgets, a wide selec
tion of omelettes and imagina
tive crepes, blintzes and eggs
Benedict complete the menu.
The only disappointment is the
eggs Benedict which carries
subtlety to the point of bland
ness. Otherwise all the food is
superbly seasoned.
French ground-roast coffee,
cappuccino, cafe au lait or
cafe mocha close brunch. It is
hoped you won't have to rush
oft and do homework, because
the New Varsity was meant for
lingering.
The guitarist plays on. The
man at the table across from
you reads the New York Times
and will be around for some
while. Others carry on their
conversations, which seem to
flow so easily in the courtyard's
ambiance, under the sparkling
eyes of the people watchers.
So before the rainy season
drives the most unique setting
on the Peninsula indoors, I
suggest that you put on your
white cotton suits and sun
dresses, don straw hats and
participate in the New Varsity
Sunday Brunch.
