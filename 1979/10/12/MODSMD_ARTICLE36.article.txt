Sun. Brunch 10 a.m. — 2 p.m.
Sunday is a very precious
day. It gives everyone a chance
to recover from Saturday night
parties and to maybe finish
homework before classes start
again on Monday. It also fea
tures one of the most festive
meals of the week — Sunday
brunch.
The Sunday brunch menu at
Hugo's Market presents the
diner with a difficult choice —
whether to choose one of the
elegant breakfast or dinner en
trees or the glamorous cham
pagne buffet called the Brunch
Galore.
All of the entrees begin with
complimentary champagne,
and a choice of freshly
squeezed orange juice or chil
led fresh fruit served with
honey, coconut and chopped
nuts.
Then there is a choice of en
trees: country fresh eggs, any
style, with Canadian style
bacon and hashed brown
potatoes ($5.95), a Belgian waf
fle smothered with yogurt and
fresh fruit or butter and warm
syrup ($5.95), New York Sirloin
steak and eggs with potatoes or
cottage cheese ($18.50), eggs
Benedict ($6.25) Sauteed
Red Snapper with mush
rooms, Hollandaise sauce,
potatoes and fresh veg
etables ($6.95) and French
Toast with bacon ($5.95). All of
the entrees include
homemade French pastries.
The Brunch Galore ($8.50) is
the chance to indulge yourself
with more than one helping of
the salads, fruits, entree and
desserts at no extra cost.

There is complimentary
champagne and Bloody Marys
or fresh orange juice to drink.
The specialty of Hugo's
Brunch Galore is the stupend
ous Market Place Salad Bar.
Shaped in a square, with a
fountain and surrounded by
plants as its centerpiece, it
looks very.much like a large
monopoly board.
I started at CO, and picked
up a large, chilled salad bowl.
After filling it with lettuce I had
to step back to absorb all the
different condiments — fresh
carrot and celery sticks, mus
hrooms, cauliflower and broc
coli spears, cucumber slices,
tomatoes, spinach leaves,
grated bleu cheese, bean and
alfalfa sprouts — all tastefully
arranged in bowls lined with
large lettuce leaves. After pil
ing most of those on and
choosing a dressing (bleu
cneese, garlic, Thousand Is
land, French or Hugo's special
dressing), I realized I was only
a third of the way around the
salad bar!
Next came the specialty
salads which included Wal
dorf, mushrooms and celery,
tomatoes in mustard sauce,
tuna lish, avocado, cucumbers
and onions, as well as cottage
cheese, bay shrimp, bite-size
slices of cold cuts and an
tipasto.
I managed to get to the fruit
salad and to slices of
fresh pineapple, cantaloupe
and watermelon on my third
trip to the salad bar.
The only drawback of the
brunch is that there is only one
entree — it happened to be
chicken teriyaki on this Sun
day. It was tasty, surprisingly
tender and well-seasoned. The
rice that went with the chicken
was lukewarm and very bland.

By this time I was rather full
but, as far as I was concerned,
the best was yet to come — the
ice cream sundae bar.
I grabbed a dish and saun
tered up to the soft ice cream
machine where there is a
choice of vanilla or chocolate,
or both. There are two top
pings: choco bits and coco
nut, and six sauces: mar
shmallow, boysenberry,
strawberry, banana, brandy
cafe and chocolate. I recom
mend trying the sundae bar last
since it is quite filling.
There is also a dessert as
sortment starring fresh straw
berries with cream and brown

sugar. The cream had a funny
taste to it. The display includes
tarts, puddings, chocolate
mousse, cakes and homemade
pastries.
The service was excellent.
We did not have to wait long to
order champagne, and
water glasses were never
empty and our dirty dishes dis
appeared before we could re
turn with the next plateful of
food.
A must for the salad and de
ssert lover, Hugo's Market is
open for brunch from 10 a.m.
until 2 p.m. Reservations are
recommended.
