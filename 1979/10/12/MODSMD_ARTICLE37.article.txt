The Holiday Inn adver
tises its Sunday brunch as
"The Peninsula's Most
Famous Buffet With One
Complimentary Glass of
Champagne," and it really is
wonderful. Your senses can
be easily overwhelmed by
the selection and the sheer
quantities of the dishes of
fered. Do take your time
and try to sample each one.
Your party will be seated
by the maitre d' at a white
tablecloth-covered table in
one of the two rooms, the
largest ot which is vaguely
reminiscent of a Middle

Eastern tent. Your waiter
will ask when you would
care for your glass of cham
pagne and, having decided,
you head for the buffet.
The long, tiered table
with large flower arrange
ments and decoratively
placed dishes is an inviting
sight. Take a warm plate
(too warm for your first
course of fruit and rolls), a
bit of butter, and a glass of
orange, tomato or grapef
ruit juice. Move on and dip
your hand into the baskets
of sweet rolls, danishes and
muffins; the banana-nut
bread is particularly good.
The fruit selection is mar
velous — fresh pineapple,
cantaloupe, honeydew me
lon, watermelon, and
strawberries; stewed

peaches and prunes;
grapefruit, baked apples,
and a fruit salad. Papayas
and figs are a special treat.
There is also cottage
cheese.
Our plates were heaping
by this time so we returned
to our table to sip cham
pagne and enjoy our selec
tions.
The chef shines on the
warm plates. Beside the
usual brunch fare of scram
bled eggs, eggs Benedict,
bacon, sausage and hash
brown potatoes we found
chicken crepes in a sup
reme sauce, rolled filet of
sole in a white wine sauce
with shrimp, sliced ham and
rice. I he chicken crepes
were very good, and we en
joyed the sole and eggs Be

nedict. The sauces were ex
cellent.
We had more than out
done ourselves but were
drawn to the dessert buffet.
The offerings range from a
simple dish of jello to
caramel creme, pretty
French patisseries, and
large bowls of chocolate
mousse. The mousse was
our favorite, and we each
had at least one of the de
lightful patisseries which
each tasted as wonderful as
they looked.
Throughout, our waiter
was most attentive despite it
being a particularly busy
Sunday and he kept our
places cleared and our cof
fee cups full. We were dis
appointed by the plate of
plastic cream containers on

our table. A small jug of
cream would have been
much nicer.
The Holiday Inn in Palo
Alto is very proud of its
brunch and with good
reason. They make every
thing from the flower ar
rangements right down to
the French patisseries. Ev
erything was delicious and
beautifully laid out. It is
somewhat noisy, but the
large turnover is necessary
it such a buffet is to be of
fered for only $7.95 per per
son.
The brunch is every Sun
day from 9:30 a.m. to 2:00
p.m. and is a fantastic place
lor a special outing with
friends or visiting family.
Reservations are a must.
