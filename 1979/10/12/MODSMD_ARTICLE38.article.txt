| Sunday Brunch —
• Quietly elegant; a place to visit
! with good friends to gorge on
food and conversation; a re
-1 laxed, home-like atmosphere
ithat incorporates silver cal
| delabras, oriental rugs, and an
tique Queen Anne chairs. All
this is The Gatehouse.
! This information may be in
jvaluable to a Stanford student
;af ter a fifteenth Stern,
Lagunita, or Flo Mo weekend
brunch. (Or are you fond of
"Western omelettes" a la food

service?) The Gatehouse,
though expensive ($8.25),
combines the two foremost
criteria of a restaurant, atmos
phere and food, excellently.
The first criterion is readily
apparent upon passing under
the wrought iron gate at the
street front. An open air dining
area is revealed. Flowering
plants hanging from old
lamp-posts and the simulated
Spanish walls, a large redwood
and an oak growing in the
midst of the tables, and a small
waterfall in back, greet the eye
with a cool, spring-like quality.
A free and unhurried feeling
pervades.

Inside, the mood changes. It
is cozy, here. Brown predomi
nates: the floor, tables, and
chairs, all of hardwood, spread
throughout the room, an odd
collection of prints decorate the
walls, and the antique cabinets
and chairs are beautiful in an
elegant, simple way.
As one sits down inside, ad
miration for the owners and
designers of the restaurant
grows. It opened in 1975, con
verted from what was once a
funeral home. The quality of
the place can be felt — one
realizes that though this re
staurant is almost full, there are
no hustling, harried waiters or

waitresses disturbing one's
sense of comfort and repose.
If the design and ambiance
of the restaurant is perhaps
more homey and less elabo
rate, then the second criteria,
the food, is the reverse. One
look at the Cold Buffet lay-out
— eight different salads,
cheeses, relishes, fruit and a
large broiled salmon spread
over white linen, surrounding
two distinctive silver candalab
ras — confirms this thought.
Classical music plays softly
as the complimentary cham
pagne (not too dry) or fruit
juice is served. From there,
one has only to follow the sim
ple three step procedure on
the menu to finish the morning
quite indulged.
The three steps are 1) the
Cold Buffet 2)the Hot Buffet
and 3) Dessert — coffee, milk,
or tea also comes with the
meal. (Here, the Gatehouse
has taken a trip from Ray Kroc:
make eating-out above all an
easy experience.)
The Cold Buffet features the
flaky tender salmon, and a de
licately seasoned shrimp salad
(literally on-the-half-shell!).
The other salads are passable
— again mixing basics with
more exotic dishes — potato,
macaroni, plain lettuce salad
alongside marinated herring
and the shrimp.
There are four different
types of melons and various
cheeses. Unfortunately, the
fruit, according to one cus
tomer, "was in varying states of
ripeness."
I suggest two trips to this
buffet — one for fruit and one
for salads. Here is, indeed, an
aspect that will please large
eaters. There is no limit on trips
back to either buffet. One can
be an intrepid diner and sam
ple everything!
After a short interlude of
chat and digestion, the Hot
Buffet is the next "step.''
There, a formidable alignment
of Eggs Benedict, cheese blintz
with blueberry sauce, and the
breakfast norm (scrambled
