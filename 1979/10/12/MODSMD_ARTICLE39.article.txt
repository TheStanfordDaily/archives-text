TWO SISTERS CREPERIE

941-2782
Sunday Brunch 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
If the thought of various meats, cheeses,
vegetables and seafoods, each smothered in
their own creamy sauce and wrapped in a
delicate pancake, tantalizes your taste buds,
then you are probably a crepe lover. And if
you are a crepe lover, then you will love the
Sunday champagne brunch at Two Sisters
Creperie in downtown Los Altos. Boasting a
regular weekday selection of more than nine
different crepes, Two Sisters Creperie takes
pride in the care with which they cook and
serve their specialty.
The brunch, available from 10:30 a.m. to 2
p.m., begins with a complimentary glass of
champagne to enjoy while browsing over the
10 brunch entrees offered. Among the crepe
dishes is the Florentine Crepe, a blend of
cream spinach and sauteed mushrooms, on
ions, cream cheese and Swiss cheese
gratineed.
Crepe au Poulet (tender chicken in a white
wine sauce) and Seafood Newburg (shrimp
and scallops topped with Newburg sauce) are
the other two crepe selections. Yet, beyond

this delicacy which bears the restaurant's
name, are various other dishes.
Related to the crepe family are the Spanish,
anci ham and cheese omelets, each stuffed
with mushrooms and additional vegetables.
Quiche Lorraine and Crab Quiche baked in a
tlaky crust provide delicious alternatives to
crepe cookery. Eggs Benedict and eggs S'Ar
dot (artichoke hearts, scrambled eggs, crab
and mushrooms on an English muffin) are
available for the traditional egg eaters. All
entrees include a choice of salad bar (not
overly impressive) or soup with rice and hot
sweet rolls.
Dark stained-wood tables and walls com
bine with hanging plants and stained-glass art
to form a somewhat rustic setting, although
strained by the plastic tablecloths. Piano and
string instrumental play softly over the
house system, lending to a more formal at
mosphere, however, suitable for conversa
tion. A complete cocktail bar is located in the
front of the small restaurant.
At first glance the prices may seem expen
sive but should be expected for a specialty
restaurant of this kind. All brunch entrees are
$6, with half-orders available for $3.
