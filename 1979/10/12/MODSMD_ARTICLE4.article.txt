# Mandatory counseling proposal in committee
## Faculty Senate debates advising system 
### Kathy Bowman 
The Faculty Senate yesterday re
turned a recommendation to com
mittee that would have assigned to
each fat uity member an average of
eight undeclared undergraduate ad
visees.
The senate also decided to con
tinue the East Asian Studies and
American Studies programs for
another live years, beginning in Au
gust 1981.
The advising report provided that
the duties of general advising be dis
tributed among the departments ac
cording to the number ot declared
students that department is already
advising and the number ot faculty
members in the department.
The plan, prepared by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies

(C-US), would substantially increase
the number of faculty advisers in the'
general advising system.
Speaking for the C-US, Physics
Prof. Alexander Fetter said the new
proposal would "place the bulk of
the responsibility where it belongs,"
with the undergraduate faculty.
The quality of undergraduate ad
vising has been an issue here for sev
eral years. Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Herant Kate hadourian called
it "one of the most serious problems
confronting undergraduate educa
tion." Vice Provost Gerald Lieber
man added that the current system is
"appalling and close to scandalous."
Undergraduate advising has con
sistently been ranked the worst of all
tacets of the University by students
declaring their majors who filled out

questionnaires on all aspects of the
University at the Academic Informa
tion Center.
The main bone of contention at the
meeting was whether faculty mem
bers who were required to advise
would make good advisers.
Philosophy Prof, lulius Moravcsik
said advisers' attitudes are most im
portant to the quality of advising, and
one "cannot legislate attitudes."
Associate Dean ot Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessels said he
fears a greater emphasis on general
advising could only come at the ex
pense of departmental and graduate
advising.
But more potentially good advisers
would be available to the students
when the faculty members recognize
advising as a responsibility, just as

teaching, Fetter said.
C-US member Walter Meyerhof, a
professor of physics, added that ad
vising is part ot what students are
paying tor when they come to Stan
ford.
Medical School Prof. Carlos
Camargo said the Med School makes
a substantial contribution to the 1 ad
vising program and expressed con
cern that the new program might
limit the Med School's involvement
in the advising program.
Ihe senate also heard a report
from President Richard Lyman on the
government's proposal for a sepa
rate Department ot I duration and its
insistence on a strict accounting ol
how faculty spend their time at work.
