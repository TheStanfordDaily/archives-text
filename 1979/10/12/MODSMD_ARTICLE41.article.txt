Apocalypse Now ** * *
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
brilliant cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind.

Autumn Sonata * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9 p.m.
Ingrid Bergman and Liv
Ullmann give exciting, obses
sively single-minded perfor
mances in this Ingmar Bergman
movie about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating because its lan
guage cannot do justice to either
the performances or Bergman's
assured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.
—R.L.

Animal House *■ ★ * *
Plaza, Daly City
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, )ohn Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
ot the "animals," in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and

while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.
Midnight Express ,
New Varsity
One of the most ugly pieces of
audience manipulation ever

filmed. Director Alan Parker and
his screenwriter, Peter Stone, get
audiences to cheer a man biting
another man's tongue off and
spitting it out. The movie is an
implicitly sexual glorification of
the most primal violence — it's a
pornography of violence.
In this tale of an American im
prisoned in Turkey for drug
smuggling, Parker and Stone
pervert movie technique to the
point where they've reduced
most people's emotional re
sponses to the lowest, most
brutal level. In this extremely li
mited way, they're "effective,"
but then I guess rapists are too.
—R.L.

The China Syndrome * * *
New Varsity
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, was per
versely vindicated by what hap
pened at Three Mile Island.
Those who called the movie "un
realistic" are hard to find now
(maybe they're out buying Col
umbia Pictures stock). Jane
Fonda and lack Lemmon are ex
cellent in this flashy mix of politi
cal commentary and straight
genre thriller. The performances
keep the movie in high gear even
when the director, fames Bridges,

loses his nerve and refuses to
take charge. In the end, an emo
tionally moving film, no matter
how you take its politics.
— R.L.
Young Frankenstein * * * *
Old Mill
Mel Brooks really needs Gene
Wilder (and vice versa) and this
movie makes that obvious. Wil
der wrote much of the
screenplay, and his performance
as Doctor Frankenstein begins to
remind you of Buster Keaton.
Brooks comes close to what can
be termed "good direction" and
his use of black-and-white

photography is particularly in
spired. Marty Feldman provides
the perfect comic foil as Igor.
— R.L.
Starting Over *
Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above the level of
uninspired '40s romantic com
edy: couple gets divorced, man
looks for someone new, lots of
"comic misadventures" along
the way, man finally finds some
one, his wife tries to take him
back, man forced to choose bet
ween his ex-wife and new love.

The major "suspense" concerns
who he will pick. Not exactly your
wonderfully novel movie idea.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much it the movie were carried
off with the kind of winking
lightness thai Burt Reynolds' per
formance here continually deliv
ers. |ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to
be bad — and she's successful.
Director Alan Pakula (Klute, All
The President's Men) is more at
home with drama; his comic
touch is, at best, unsure. No mat
ter what Burt Reynolds is in, it
seems, he ends up being the only
reason to see it.
— R.L.

Luna # *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's first English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo-

graphy in Apocalypse Now) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it. In a very different role, Jill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered perfor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best thing
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.
—R.L.

The Man Who Would Be Kin#
♦* ★ ★
Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:45 p.m.
Director )ohn Huston waited
nearly 30 years before he finally
made this classic Rudyard Kipling
fable into a movie. Cable and
Bogart were his original choices
for the two roguish leads, but
Bogart died before'that could
come off.
Sean Connery and Michael
Caine are the respective re
placements for Gable and
Bogart; while they aren't quite as
magical as the latter pair probably
would have been, they are mar
velous together. Grand enter
tainment done with a stylish
sense of adventure and wonder;
directed with great skill and love
by Huston. As Kipling, Christ
opher Plummer shines in a too
brief role.
— R.L.
Northern Lights * * * *
Surf, San Francisco
A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
plan to think about it and not just
bask in its glow. Artful black
and-white cinematography com
bines with new directing skills
and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden
Camera Award for the best fea
ture film this year. See it for its
human characterizations and
poignant plot. A thinking per
son's movie.
— Seth Zuckerman
Breaking Away * * *
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable film
with few pretensions — Breaking
Away may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter ißullitt) Vates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his ta
lent on a bicycle.
— Mike Kohn
The Seduction of joe Tynan * « *
Guild, Menlo Park
Alan Alda plays a dashing
young liberal senator from New
York whose rising career # begins
to leave his wife and daughter
behind. Meryl Streep plays a
talented lobbyist who picks up
the loose ends of Alda's life. But
in the end, well, we'll find out by
Thanksgiving. A good film prob
ing the problems of being both a
politician and a person.
—Rob Lempert


The Lady Vanishes
Monday, Cubberley, 7:30 p.m.
The Lady Vanishes is one of
Alfred Hitchcock's most droll,
most assured works; certainly one
of the very best of his English
movies. This 1938 classic contains
a gentle humor that belies the
otherwise suspenseful nature of the
plot.
A nice old lady (Dame May
Whitty) disappears from a train.
She may remind you of your
grandmother, but she's a spy
caught up in a favorite Hitchcock
situation, Us versus a vague (in this
case probably German) Them.
Pictured, from left to right:
Naunton Wayne-, Dame May
Whitty, Cecil Parker, Linden Trav
ers, Basil Radford, Margaret
Lockwood, Catherine Lacy and
Michael Redgrave (in his movie de
but).

Animal House *■ ★ * *
Plaza, Daly City
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, )ohn Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
ot the "animals," in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and

while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.
Midnight Express ,
New Varsity
One of the most ugly pieces of
audience manipulation ever

filmed. Director Alan Parker and
his screenwriter, Peter Stone, get
audiences to cheer a man biting
another man's tongue off and
spitting it out. The movie is an
implicitly sexual glorification of
the most primal violence — it's a
pornography of violence.
In this tale of an American im
prisoned in Turkey for drug
smuggling, Parker and Stone
pervert movie technique to the
point where they've reduced
most people's emotional re
sponses to the lowest, most
brutal level. In this extremely li
mited way, they're "effective,"
but then I guess rapists are too.
—R.L.

The China Syndrome * * *
New Varsity
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, was per
versely vindicated by what hap
pened at Three Mile Island.
Those who called the movie "un
realistic" are hard to find now
(maybe they're out buying Col
umbia Pictures stock). Jane
Fonda and lack Lemmon are ex
cellent in this flashy mix of politi
cal commentary and straight
genre thriller. The performances
keep the movie in high gear even
when the director, fames Bridges,

loses his nerve and refuses to
take charge. In the end, an emo
tionally moving film, no matter
how you take its politics.
— R.L.
Young Frankenstein * * * *
Old Mill
Mel Brooks really needs Gene
Wilder (and vice versa) and this
movie makes that obvious. Wil
der wrote much of the
screenplay, and his performance
as Doctor Frankenstein begins to
remind you of Buster Keaton.
Brooks comes close to what can
be termed "good direction" and
his use of black-and-white

photography is particularly in
spired. Marty Feldman provides
the perfect comic foil as Igor.
— R.L.
Starting Over *
Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above the level of
uninspired '40s romantic com
edy: couple gets divorced, man
looks for someone new, lots of
"comic misadventures" along
the way, man finally finds some
one, his wife tries to take him
back, man forced to choose bet
ween his ex-wife and new love.

The major "suspense" concerns
who he will pick. Not exactly your
wonderfully novel movie idea.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much it the movie were carried
off with the kind of winking
lightness thai Burt Reynolds' per
formance here continually deliv
ers. |ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to
be bad — and she's successful.
Director Alan Pakula (Klute, All
The President's Men) is more at
home with drama; his comic
touch is, at best, unsure. No mat
ter what Burt Reynolds is in, it
seems, he ends up being the only
reason to see it.

Luna # *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's first English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo-

graphy in Apocalypse Now) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it. In a very different role, Jill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered perfor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best thing
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.

The Man Who Would Be Kin#
♦* ★ ★
Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:45 p.m.
Director )ohn Huston waited
nearly 30 years before he finally
made this classic Rudyard Kipling
fable into a movie. Cable and
Bogart were his original choices
for the two roguish leads, but
Bogart died before'that could
come off.
Sean Connery and Michael
Caine are the respective re
placements for Gable and
Bogart; while they aren't quite as
magical as the latter pair probably
would have been, they are mar
velous together. Grand enter
tainment done with a stylish
sense of adventure and wonder;
directed with great skill and love
by Huston. As Kipling, Christ

A fantastic movie, but don't

bines with new directing skills
and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden

The Lady Vanishes
Monday, Cubberley, 7:30 p.m.
The Lady Vanishes is one of
Alfred Hitchcock's most droll,
most assured works; certainly one
of the very best of his English
movies. This 1938 classic contains
a gentle humor that belies the
otherwise suspenseful nature of the
plot.
A nice old lady (Dame May
Whitty) disappears from a train.
She may remind you of your
grandmother, but she's a spy
caught up in a favorite Hitchcock
situation, Us versus a vague (in this
case probably German) Them.
Pictured, from left to right:
Naunton Wayne-, Dame May
Whitty, Cecil Parker, Linden Trav

Lockwood, Catherine Lacy and
Michael Redgrave (in his movie de

Apocalypse Now ** * *
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad

Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in

Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
brilliant cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im

John Landis, the director, di
rects as if there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and

while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if Landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Midnight Express ,
New Varsity
One of the most ugly pieces of
audience manipulation ever

filmed. Director Alan Parker and
his screenwriter, Peter Stone, get
audiences to cheer a man biting
another man's tongue off and
spitting it out. The movie is an
implicitly sexual glorification of
the most primal violence — it's a
pornography of violence.
In this tale of an American im
prisoned in Turkey for drug
smuggling, Parker and Stone
pervert movie technique to the
point where they've reduced
most people's emotional re
sponses to the lowest, most
brutal level. In this extremely li
mited way, they're "effective,"
but then I guess rapists are too.
—R.L.

The China Syndrome * * *
New Varsity
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, was per
versely vindicated by what hap
pened at Three Mile Island.
Those who called the movie "un
realistic" are hard to find now
(maybe they're out buying Col
umbia Pictures stock). Jane
Fonda and lack Lemmon are ex
cellent in this flashy mix of politi
cal commentary and straight
genre thriller. The performances
keep the movie in high gear even
when the director, fames Bridges,

loses his nerve and refuses to
take charge. In the end, an emo
tionally moving film, no matter
how you take its politics.
— R.L.
Young Frankenstein * * * *
Old Mill
Mel Brooks really needs Gene
Wilder (and vice versa) and this
movie makes that obvious. Wil
der wrote much of the
screenplay, and his performance
as Doctor Frankenstein begins to
remind you of Buster Keaton.
Brooks comes close to what can
be termed "good direction" and
his use of black-and-white

photography is particularly in
spired. Marty Feldman provides
the perfect comic foil as Igor.
— R.L.
Starting Over *
Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above the level of
uninspired '40s romantic com
edy: couple gets divorced, man
looks for someone new, lots of
"comic misadventures" along
the way, man finally finds some
one, his wife tries to take him
back, man forced to choose bet
ween his ex-wife and new love.

The major "suspense" concerns
who he will pick. Not exactly your
wonderfully novel movie idea.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much it the movie were carried
off with the kind of winking
lightness thai Burt Reynolds' per
formance here continually deliv
ers. |ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to
be bad — and she's successful.
Director Alan Pakula (Klute, All
The President's Men) is more at
home with drama; his comic
touch is, at best, unsure. No mat
ter what Burt Reynolds is in, it
seems, he ends up being the only
reason to see it.

Luna # *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's first English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo-

graphy in Apocalypse Now) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it. In a very different role, Jill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered perfor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best thing
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.

The Man Who Would Be Kin#

Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:45 p.m.
Director )ohn Huston waited
nearly 30 years before he finally
made this classic Rudyard Kipling
fable into a movie. Cable and
Bogart were his original choices
for the two roguish leads, but
Bogart died before'that could
come off.
Sean Connery and Michael
Caine are the respective re
placements for Gable and
Bogart; while they aren't quite as
magical as the latter pair probably
would have been, they are mar
velous together. Grand enter
tainment done with a stylish
sense of adventure and wonder;
directed with great skill and love
by Huston. As Kipling, Christ

A fantastic movie, but don't

bines with new directing skills
and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far

1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden

poignant plot. A thinking per

The Lady Vanishes
Monday, Cubberley, 7:30 p.m.
The Lady Vanishes is one of
Alfred Hitchcock's most droll,
most assured works; certainly one
of the very best of his English
movies. This 1938 classic contains
a gentle humor that belies the
otherwise suspenseful nature of the
plot.
A nice old lady (Dame May
Whitty) disappears from a train.
She may remind you of your
grandmother, but she's a spy
caught up in a favorite Hitchcock
situation, Us versus a vague (in this
case probably German) Them.
Pictured, from left to right:
Naunton Wayne-, Dame May
Whitty, Cecil Parker, Linden Trav
ers, Basil Radford, Margaret
Lockwood, Catherine Lacy and
Michael Redgrave (in his movie de

Apocalypse Now ** * *
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
brilliant cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind.

Autumn Sonata * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9 p.m.
Ingrid Bergman and Liv
Ullmann give exciting, obses
sively single-minded perfor
mances in this Ingmar Bergman
movie about a parent-child rela
tionship. The film can often be
very frustrating because its lan
guage cannot do justice to either
the performances or Bergman's
assured visual conception. But
your frustration is, finally, erased
by joy. Even if Ingmar Bergman is
not yet ready to go all the way
with a movie again, his actresses
are, and they take the movie right
to the limit, roaring through it
like two great ladies of the thea
ter who haven't lost their zest.

Animal House *■ ★ * *
Plaza, Daly City
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat life in '62 works; Animal
House's approach fits its subject
matter very well.
As always, )ohn Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
ot the "animals," in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite

whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
