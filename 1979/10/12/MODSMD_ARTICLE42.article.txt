American shares Nobel award
Stockholm, Sweden — The Nobel Prize for
medicine was awarded yesterday to an American
and a Briton who in their separate ways helped
develop an X-ray technique — computer-assisted
tomography (CAT) — that enables man to peer
more clearly and safely than ever into the body.
Physicist Allan Cormack, 55, of Tufts University
in Medford, Mass.. said he was "amazed" to learn
that the Royal Caroline Medico-Surgical Institute
had selected him for the 1979 prize. His co-winner
is Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield, 60, a research
engineer with the British firm EMI.
Many in medicine view the CAT scanning
method as a revolution equal to the discovery of
the X-ray itself almost a century ago.
The CAT method works as follows:
The equipment beams a rotating X-ray through a
cross-section of the body from «very angle and
teeds the information back into a computer that
provides a picture of the "slice" of the brain or
other organ being examined.
Stock market slackens
New York — The stock market's three-day slide
stalled yesterday as trading on the New York S'ock
Exchange, although still heavy, was off considera
bly from Wednesday's record-setting pace.
Analysts were cautious in predicting an end to
the market's skid, ascribing the calming in the
market to a number of internal factors.
The closely watched Dow |ones industrial aver
age, after plunging 48.29 in the first three davs of
the week, began the day with a slight increase, fell
sharply and recovered to close at 844.62, down
4.70.
Trading wasn't at the feverish pitch that charac
terized Tuesday's session, when 55.56 million
shares moved on the New York Stock Exchange, or
Wednesday's session, when a record 81.62 million
shares changed hands, but the volume of 47.5i
million shares was still heavy.
Analysts listed as one of the most significant
steadying effects a development that seemed at
tirst glance to be negative: IBM, a favorite of inves
tor, particularly large ones like pension funds and
insurance companies, said its earnings for the
third quarter were down from last year.
T he news at first did not send IBM down further,
and many traders took that as a signal that the
market might have reached its bottom. Investors
began buying again to push the market averages
up, but IBM slipped again to else at $66,625, down
$1,125.
BART negotiations suspended
Oakland— Bav Area Rapid Transit (BARE) district
ta'ks broke off yesterday over the unions' de
mands lor a cost-of-living wage hike, and labor
leaders said negotiations would not be resumed
tor "a good while."
A 15-hour bargaining session ended when BART
district management retused to accept conces
sions the unions made over the controversial is
sue.
Negotiators agreed to suspend talks at least until
after a union meeting scheduled for next week,
and both sides conceded that the break-off could
harden bargaining positions.

Well-guarded Castro visits U.N.
New York — Fidel Castro, shielded by 2000
police and dozens of his own guards, spent his
first day in New York City in 19 apparently
holed up in the Cuban mission in a soot-begrimed,
13-story red brick building, preparing his speech
to the United Nations.
The Cuban president, who is to address the
General Assembly late this morning, was clad in
familiar green fatigues and had a cigar atilt in his
mouth as he arrived early yesterday on a jet flight
from Havana.
He was whisked into seclusion at the building at
38th Street and Lexington Avenue, seven blocks
from the United Nations.
It was far below the size of the 11,500-member
police detail that spread out to guard Pope John
Paul II last week. But it was unsurpassed for the
concentrated protection it afforded the bearded
Cuban dictator.
Pro and anti-Castro demonstrators were cleared
from a four-block area around the Cuban mission.
They were kept separated on the fringe of the
so-called "frozen zone."
It was Castro's first visit to New York since 1960,
20 months alter he took power in Cuba. His four
and one-half hour speech then still is a record for
the General Assembly.
This time, he was scheduled to speak 75 minutes
to the 152-nation assembly, beginning 11:30 a.m.
today.
The United Nations will be closed to the public
while the Cuban president is there.
Palestinians report new flare-up
Beirut — Palestinian sources said Syrian and Is
raeli warplanes traded fire in the skies of southern
Lebanon yesterday, but no jets were shot down.
Israel declined the report, and there was no com
ment from Syria.
The official spokesman for the Palestine Libera
tion Organization here said he was not aware of a
dogfight but that Israeli overflights in the south
had been reported.
Residents in Beirut said they heard a sonic boom
that shook windows at about 2:15 p.m., the same
time the highly-placed Palestinian sources said the
skirmish oc c urred somewhere south of Damour, 7
miles south ot Beirut.
In south Lebanon, Palestinian anti-aircraft gun
ners and Syrian peacekeeping troops went on
alert, and Palestinians in refugee camps took cover
when air raid sirens sounded the alarm, the Pales
tinian sources said.
Talmadge denounced by Senate
Washington — The Senate voted overwhelm
ingly yesterday to denounce Herman Talmadge,
one of»its most senior members, for "reprehensi
ble" handling of government funds.
The 81-15 vote culminated months of investiga
tion by the Senate Ethics Committee and a brief
debate on the Senate floor It was the tirst time the
Senate has used the word "denounce" in expres
sing disapproval of the actions of one of its mem
bers.
Sen. Adlai Stevenson CD-Ill), chairman of the
ethics panel had urged the Senate to "discharge a

disagreeable duty" and accept the panel's resolu
tion of denunciation against the Georgia Democ
rat.
While Stevenson listed the charges against Tal
madge, the Georgian sat quietly in the Senate
chamber with his lawyer.
After detailing the charges of financial miscon
duct against the senator, Stevenson urged the Se
nate to "characterize his conduct as reprehensible
and denounce that conduct . .
Immediately after the vote, Talmadge took the
floor to say he had made mistakes of negligence
and that he regretted them. However, he added
that the Ethics Committee had found nothing to
indicate his actions were willful.
Stevenson said the committee found Talmadge
had failed to report more than $10,000 in campaign
contributions, but it did not find that he personally
benefitted from the illegal conversion of the
funds.
Talmadge, who is running for re-election for a
fifth Senate term, has steadfastly maintained his
innocence of any wrongdoing.
Abortion issue delays Congress
Washington — House and Senate negotiators
worked yesterday toward a fragile compromise on
an abortion financing dispute that is stalling an
emergency appropriations bill which seven fed
eral departments need to keep operating.
Remaining totally unsettled, however, was the
separate issue of a 5.5 percent pay raise for mem
bers of Congress which also is tying up the bill.
There were indications that even if the con
ferees are able to agree on an abortion com
promise, the proposal would face a vigorous battle
on the House and Senate floors.
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) said the
House would remain in session indefinitely yes
terday in the hope of a compromise can be worked
out.
The seven Cabinet-level departments, mean
while, were starting to feel the pinch from having
to operate for 11 days on funds left over from the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
The Transportation and Labor departments al
ready have warned that their combined 90,000
employees would receive only halt pay in their
next paychecks.
The proposed abortion compromise would
allow federal financing of abortions when the
mother's life is directly threatened and in cases of
rape and incest. The change would be in effect
only for the life of the emergency bill — until Nov.
20.
Abortion financing is now allowed under condi
tions specified in the compromise and also in
cases where two doctors certity the long-term
health of the woman could be affected by a con
tinued pregnancy. The Senate previously had in
sisted on all four conditions.
The House wants federal money to be used only
when the lite of the mother is directly threatened.

San Francisco Bay Area — Variable cloudiness
through today. Mostly cloudy tonight and tomor
row with chance of showers. A little cooler tomor
row. Lows in the mid 50s to low 60s. Highs in the
mid 60s to mid 70s.

Abortion issue delays Congress
Washington — House and Senate negotiators
worked yesterday toward a fragile compromise on
an abortion financing dispute that is stalling an
emergency appropriations bill which seven fed
eral departments need to keep operating.
Remaining totally unsettled, however, was the
separate issue of a 5.5 percent pay raise for mem
bers of Congress which also is tying up the bill.
There were indications that even if the con
ferees are able to agree on an abortion com
promise, the proposal would face a vigorous battle
on the House and Senate floors.
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) said the
House would remain in session indefinitely yes
terday in the hope of a compromise can be worked
out.
The seven Cabinet-level departments, mean
while, were starting to feel the pinch from having
to operate for 11 days on funds left over from the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
The Transportation and Labor departments al
ready have warned that their combined 90,000
employees would receive only halt pay in their
next paychecks.
The proposed abortion compromise would
allow federal financing of abortions when the
mother's life is directly threatened and in cases of
rape and incest. The change would be in effect
only for the life of the emergency bill — until Nov.
20.
Abortion financing is now allowed under condi
tions specified in the compromise and also in
cases where two doctors certity the long-term
health of the woman could be affected by a con
tinued pregnancy. The Senate previously had in
sisted on all four conditions.
The House wants federal money to be used only
when the lite of the mother is directly threatened.

American shares Nobel award
Stockholm, Sweden — The Nobel Prize for

Physicist Allan Cormack, 55, of Tufts University

Stock market slackens
New York — The stock market's three-day slide
stalled yesterday as trading on the New York S'ock

Trading wasn't at the feverish pitch that charac

Wednesday's session, when a record 81.62 million

Analysts listed as one of the most significant

Well-guarded Castro visits U.N.
New York — Fidel Castro, shielded by 2000
police and dozens of his own guards, spent his
first day in New York City in 19 apparently
holed up in the Cuban mission in a soot-begrimed,
13-story red brick building, preparing his speech
to the United Nations.
The Cuban president, who is to address the
General Assembly late this morning, was clad in
familiar green fatigues and had a cigar atilt in his
mouth as he arrived early yesterday on a jet flight
from Havana.
He was whisked into seclusion at the building at
38th Street and Lexington Avenue, seven blocks
from the United Nations.
It was far below the size of the 11,500-member
police detail that spread out to guard Pope John
Paul II last week. But it was unsurpassed for the
concentrated protection it afforded the bearded
Cuban dictator.
Pro and anti-Castro demonstrators were cleared
from a four-block area around the Cuban mission.
They were kept separated on the fringe of the
so-called "frozen zone."
It was Castro's first visit to New York since 1960,
20 months alter he took power in Cuba. His four
and one-half hour speech then still is a record for
the General Assembly.
This time, he was scheduled to speak 75 minutes
to the 152-nation assembly, beginning 11:30 a.m.
today.
The United Nations will be closed to the public
while the Cuban president is there.
Palestinians report new flare-up

dogfight but that Israeli overflights in the south
had been reported.
Residents in Beirut said they heard a sonic boom
that shook windows at about 2:15 p.m., the same
time the highly-placed Palestinian sources said the
skirmish oc c urred somewhere south of Damour, 7
miles south ot Beirut.
In south Lebanon, Palestinian anti-aircraft gun

alert, and Palestinians in refugee camps took cover
when air raid sirens sounded the alarm, the Pales

Well-guarded Castro visits U.N.
New York — Fidel Castro, shielded by 2000
police and dozens of his own guards, spent his
first day in New York City in 19 apparently
holed up in the Cuban mission in a soot-begrimed,
13-story red brick building, preparing his speech
to the United Nations.
The Cuban president, who is to address the
General Assembly late this morning, was clad in
familiar green fatigues and had a cigar atilt in his
mouth as he arrived early yesterday on a jet flight
from Havana.
He was whisked into seclusion at the building at
38th Street and Lexington Avenue, seven blocks
from the United Nations.
It was far below the size of the 11,500-member
police detail that spread out to guard Pope John
Paul II last week. But it was unsurpassed for the
concentrated protection it afforded the bearded
Cuban dictator.
Pro and anti-Castro demonstrators were cleared
from a four-block area around the Cuban mission.
They were kept separated on the fringe of the
so-called "frozen zone."
It was Castro's first visit to New York since 1960,
20 months alter he took power in Cuba. His four
and one-half hour speech then still is a record for
the General Assembly.
This time, he was scheduled to speak 75 minutes
to the 152-nation assembly, beginning 11:30 a.m.
today.
The United Nations will be closed to the public
while the Cuban president is there.
Palestinians report new flare-up
Beirut — Palestinian sources said Syrian and Is
raeli warplanes traded fire in the skies of southern
Lebanon yesterday, but no jets were shot down.
Israel declined the report, and there was no com
ment from Syria.
The official spokesman for the Palestine Libera
tion Organization here said he was not aware of a
dogfight but that Israeli overflights in the south
had been reported.
Residents in Beirut said they heard a sonic boom
that shook windows at about 2:15 p.m., the same
time the highly-placed Palestinian sources said the
skirmish oc c urred somewhere south of Damour, 7
miles south ot Beirut.
In south Lebanon, Palestinian anti-aircraft gun
ners and Syrian peacekeeping troops went on
alert, and Palestinians in refugee camps took cover
when air raid sirens sounded the alarm, the Pales
tinian sources said.
Talmadge denounced by Senate
Washington — The Senate voted overwhelm
ingly yesterday to denounce Herman Talmadge,
one of»its most senior members, for "reprehensi
ble" handling of government funds.
The 81-15 vote culminated months of investiga
tion by the Senate Ethics Committee and a brief
debate on the Senate floor It was the tirst time the
Senate has used the word "denounce" in expres
sing disapproval of the actions of one of its mem
bers.
Sen. Adlai Stevenson CD-Ill), chairman of the
ethics panel had urged the Senate to "discharge a

disagreeable duty" and accept the panel's resolu
tion of denunciation against the Georgia Democ
rat.
While Stevenson listed the charges against Tal
madge, the Georgian sat quietly in the Senate
chamber with his lawyer.
After detailing the charges of financial miscon
duct against the senator, Stevenson urged the Se
nate to "characterize his conduct as reprehensible
and denounce that conduct . .
Immediately after the vote, Talmadge took the
floor to say he had made mistakes of negligence
and that he regretted them. However, he added
that the Ethics Committee had found nothing to
indicate his actions were willful.
Stevenson said the committee found Talmadge
had failed to report more than $10,000 in campaign
contributions, but it did not find that he personally
benefitted from the illegal conversion of the
funds.
Talmadge, who is running for re-election for a
fifth Senate term, has steadfastly maintained his
innocence of any wrongdoing.
Abortion issue delays Congress
Washington — House and Senate negotiators
worked yesterday toward a fragile compromise on
an abortion financing dispute that is stalling an
emergency appropriations bill which seven fed
eral departments need to keep operating.
Remaining totally unsettled, however, was the
separate issue of a 5.5 percent pay raise for mem
bers of Congress which also is tying up the bill.
There were indications that even if the con
ferees are able to agree on an abortion com
promise, the proposal would face a vigorous battle
on the House and Senate floors.
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) said the
House would remain in session indefinitely yes
terday in the hope of a compromise can be worked
out.
The seven Cabinet-level departments, mean
while, were starting to feel the pinch from having
to operate for 11 days on funds left over from the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
The Transportation and Labor departments al
ready have warned that their combined 90,000
employees would receive only halt pay in their
next paychecks.
The proposed abortion compromise would
allow federal financing of abortions when the
mother's life is directly threatened and in cases of
rape and incest. The change would be in effect
only for the life of the emergency bill — until Nov.
20.
Abortion financing is now allowed under condi
tions specified in the compromise and also in
cases where two doctors certity the long-term
health of the woman could be affected by a con
tinued pregnancy. The Senate previously had in
sisted on all four conditions.
The House wants federal money to be used only
when the lite of the mother is directly threatened.
Today's weather
San Francisco Bay Area — Variable cloudiness

American shares Nobel award
Stockholm, Sweden — The Nobel Prize for
medicine was awarded yesterday to an American
and a Briton who in their separate ways helped
develop an X-ray technique — computer-assisted
tomography (CAT) — that enables man to peer
more clearly and safely than ever into the body.
Physicist Allan Cormack, 55, of Tufts University
in Medford, Mass.. said he was "amazed" to learn
that the Royal Caroline Medico-Surgical Institute
had selected him for the 1979 prize. His co-winner
is Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield, 60, a research
engineer with the British firm EMI.
Many in medicine view the CAT scanning
method as a revolution equal to the discovery of
the X-ray itself almost a century ago.
The CAT method works as follows:
The equipment beams a rotating X-ray through a
cross-section of the body from «very angle and
teeds the information back into a computer that
provides a picture of the "slice" of the brain or
other organ being examined.
Stock market slackens
New York — The stock market's three-day slide
stalled yesterday as trading on the New York S'ock
Exchange, although still heavy, was off considera
bly from Wednesday's record-setting pace.
Analysts were cautious in predicting an end to
the market's skid, ascribing the calming in the
market to a number of internal factors.
The closely watched Dow |ones industrial aver
age, after plunging 48.29 in the first three davs of
the week, began the day with a slight increase, fell
sharply and recovered to close at 844.62, down
4.70.
Trading wasn't at the feverish pitch that charac
terized Tuesday's session, when 55.56 million
shares moved on the New York Stock Exchange, or
Wednesday's session, when a record 81.62 million
shares changed hands, but the volume of 47.5i
million shares was still heavy.
Analysts listed as one of the most significant
steadying effects a development that seemed at
tirst glance to be negative: IBM, a favorite of inves
tor, particularly large ones like pension funds and
insurance companies, said its earnings for the
third quarter were down from last year.
T he news at first did not send IBM down further,
and many traders took that as a signal that the
market might have reached its bottom. Investors
began buying again to push the market averages
up, but IBM slipped again to else at $66,625, down
$1,125.
