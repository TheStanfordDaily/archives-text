# SURE resumes job
## 
### Kathleen McClung 
After a controversial first year,
Students United for Rape Elimination
(SURE) will resume its campus-wide
escort service Sunday.
Speaking Wednesday night at the
first meeting of SURE's 25 escorts,
director Ron Lepow focused on the
organization's "ideology." The birth
of the service last year sparked
heated debate from many feminists
who claim SURE "propagated male
dominance," Lepow noted.
"We had to answer to the com
plaint that SURE looked like a bunch
of macho guys helping poor, de
fenseless women. We look at it as a
cost-benefit situation. If we can
eliminate both the fear of rape and
the possibility of rape, then we think
it's worth it to hurt the women's
movement," said Lepow.
Both men and women have volun
teered for the service. Three women
and more than 20 men were present
Wednesday. Women escorts work in
pairs in the program.
SURE will operate Sunday through
Thursday nights from 8:30 p.m. to
12:30 a.m. When a woman calls 497-
3217 to request an escort, she gives
her name, location and destination
to a dispatcher who then contacts an
available escort.

"A lot of time went into designinj
these procedures," Lepow told th<
group. "We're a very serious organi
zation, an extension of the Stanfor<
police department."
"We don't expect you to act a
police officers," said Director c
Police Services Marvin Herringtoi
addressing the escorts. Potential e
corts undergo thorough investi(_
tion, he said. "Your names will bt
run through all the criminal files ir
California."
Until now, one escort observed,
"SURE has been a word-of-mouth
sort of organization." An eight
member committee plans to change
this image through increased public
ity.
"Things are going to pick up.
We've got money now," Lepow said.
SURE received a grant of $900 from
the Dean of Student Affairs Olfice
earlier this year. "We're getting all
the support from the University we
could ask for," Lepow concluded.
Serving as an escort is "not like
some big crusade for me," said
senior Mike Bentz, new to SURE.
"The reason is not to prove anything.
I just feel bad that women are afraid
to go out at night. This is something I
do for my friends. Why not for
everybody else?"
