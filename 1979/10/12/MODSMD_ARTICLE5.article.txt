Official contact between the Republic Of Ireland
and the United Kingdom through the European
Economic Community and European Parliament
may contribute toa peaceful political settlement in
Northern Ireland, David Steel, leader of Britain's
Liberal Party, said yesterday.
Speaking before the International Law Society
here, Steel noted that a lack of consultation bet
ween the two governments has prevented prog
ress toward a satisfactory peace settlement.
"The governments ot the Republic of Ireland
and the United Kingdom must talk to each other,
not only about security, but about the long term
c onstitutional tuture of I-eland as well," he said. "I
hope these meetings could he the framework for a
reunification settlement.
"Within the European framework, the politi
cians are going to be forced to come together to
discuss the issues," he said.
Home-rule essential
Steel noted that the Liberal Party has consis
tently supported the idea of home-rule within the
United Kingdom and that Ireland should be a "un
itary state with close associations to Britain."
Nevertheless, "the terrorist campaigns have
made it more difficult to discuss reunification," he
said.
The Liberal Party rejects all demands to with
draw British troops from Northern Ireland, he ad
ded, given the scale of intimidation of c ivilians by
the Irish Republican Army and by Protestant
para-military organizations.
Instead, he said, a gradual transfer of responsi
bility from the military to a reformed local police
force would be desirable.
Politics over military
Steel said political measures, not military and

security means, should be used to bring about a
satisfactory settlement in Ireland.
Segregation of Protestants and Catholics is an
example of an area where politicians of all view
points could work together, he said.
"Teacher training is segregated as are the
schools," he said. This promotes and sustains the
cycle of hostility, he added.
Favors Zimbabwe ban
In the discussion following his speech, Steel
said he was "glad' that the new Conservative Party
government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
had not lifted trade sanctions on Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia.
The Liberal Party supports the talks at Lancaster
House led by (Foreign Secretary) Lord Car
rington," he said. "They have made quite remark
able progress."
Real difficulties lie, however, in the formulation
of an agreement for a transition period from the
present government of Prime Minister Abel
Muzorewa to one encompassing the guerilla
forces of )oshua Nkomo, he said.
Aj?reement 'doubtful'
"A lot of things hinge on control ot the armed
forces. The question of who will control internal
security is crucial," he said.
But the possibilities for a settlement are "doubt
ful", he added.
Asked whether the Conservative government
can successfully implement its economic policies,
Steel said the present policies are based on "19th
century liberal economics."
"They extoll the virtues of non-intervention ex
cessively," he added. They could inhibit effective
governmental response to rising inflation and un

employment. I think they will not be successful,"
he said.
'Turn around'
The last Conservative government of Edward
Heath started with the same conservative outlook
in economic policy but was forced to turn around
when its policies failed, he noted.
"My hunch is that such a turn-about will not
happen this time," he said, because of the strong
popular support of Thatcher's party.
The Liberal Party had supported the Conserva
tive Party bid for a vote of no-confidence in former
Prime Minister fames Callaghan's government last
spring. I iheral support was crucial in toppling the
Labor government, since the no-confidence mea
sure passed by only one vote.
Liberals wield punch
In the subsequent general election for the
House ot Commons, the Liberals secured 14 per
cent of the vote although they managed to capture
only 11 seats, less than two percent of the 635-seat
House of Commons.
Despite its underrepresented status, the Liberal
Party has often played a vital role in partisan poli
tics through its endorsement of either the Labor or
the Conservative Party at various times.
In 1977 the Liberal Party saved Labor's majority
in the House of Commons by agreeing to vote for
retention of the government in exchange for Labor
backing on several Liberal objectives.
"We would enter such a coalition again, if the
proper opportunity arises," Steel said, emphasiz
ing the Liberal Party's willingness to use its pecul
iar position as a powerful minority.
Steel has been leader of the Libruus since July,
1976, when he was elec ted by a broad franchise of
party members. That was the first time in British
political history when party leadership was
awarded through a broad electoral system.
