# Protesters alter boycott emphasis
## Health authorities demand True Coffee House demise 
### Fran Miller 
Coffee House workers who were
fired en masse July 27 have decided
to adopt a more grass roots approach
to their on-going protest.
At a meeting held last night, the
workers decided to maintain only
sporadic picketing rather than con
tinuous protests. Such action will
allow more time to visit dorms and
administrators to attract more wide
spread attention to the cause,
explained Amy Klatzkin, a former
Coffee House employee. The
boycott will continue as long as
people are willing to support it, she
added.
These decisions came in the wake
of the closing of one ot the group's
major tools of pr&test — The True
Cottee House, a foodstand set up
outside Tresidder shortly after the tir
ing-
Yesterday's, closing of the True
Coffee House by the Santa Clara

County Health Department came as
no surprise to the workers, accord
ing to director ot Tresidder Dan Wil
liams. He said he warned the group
that action would be taken because
the stand had no permanent permit
to operate.
Not harmful
One worker said she didn't think
the closing would be "detrimental to
our cause as a whole."
Warren Newfield, vice-president
ot TDS, the company contracted to
operate the Coffee House and sev
eral other campus eating establish
ments, said negotiations are under
way and a settlement will be reached
"hopefully very, very soon" with
former Coffee House employees.
The most recent step in this pro
cess was the issuance of live tele
grams to former workers since fast
Saturday, offering "immediate
reinstatement to your former posi
tion or a substantially equivalent pos
ition at the Coffee House." Re
sponses must be made by 5 p.m. to
morrow,
Treated separately
Klatzkin, who has not been offered
re-employment, said although
workers want their jobs back, they
are upset by the fact that they are
being treated individually instead of
as a group — the way we were
fired."
"Offering some people jobs sepa
rately is not negotiating," com
mented Klatzkin. She said the group
as a whole has never been contacted
directly.
Klatzkin said she believes the real
issue lies in the way Tresidder is run.
Student unions should be student
places.
