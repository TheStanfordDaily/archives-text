# Hotline to help combat VD 'epidemic'
## 
### Jeff Powell 
About 5000 persons in Santa
Clara County reported cases of
venereal disease last year and
officials estimate many more
are hesitant to seek help.
Concern over those hesitant
to consult the doctor promp
ted the American Social Health
Association (ASHA), a volun
tary, non-profit organization
headquartered in Palo Alto, to
open a toll-tree nationwide ve
nereal disease hotline this
Monday.
"We feel that there is a need
for information and referral on
a confidential basis. Venereal
disease is a big problem and it's

time someone came to deal
with it," Bea Mandel, director
of the hotline, said.
Mandel called VD the
"single most communicative
disease in the United States,"
saying it has reached epidemic
proportions.
"Our purpose is to provide
some means of intervention to
get early treatment lor possible
VD patients," she said.
The hotline, aided by a grant
from the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) and over 5000 clinics
throughout the country, will
be an information-referral op

eration, Mandel said.
Volunteer staffers, familiar
with the symptoms of the vari
ous types of VD, will direct cal
lers to nearby clinics if
symptoms are correct. The hot
lines will be open daily.
According to Mandel, staf
fers have gone through a vig
orous 15-hour training prog
ram versing them in both the
recognition of possible
symptoms and in communica
tion skills.
ASHA projects an initial
target number of 65 to 70 vol
unteers. It said it hopes to ex
pand that number to 100 or 150
later. Volunteers are of all

ages.
More volunteers ar
needed, Mandel said. Th
human biology departmen
will offer a three-unit intern
ship for students interested.
The service's "major concen
right now is to recruit volun
teers," Mandell said.
Advertising is limited to th«
Bay Area at present.
Mandel said she is confiden
that once awareness of the hot
line spreads across the coun
try, the service will "take ofl
like a shot.
"The hotline concept is al
ready out there and they (the
public) believe in it," she said.
