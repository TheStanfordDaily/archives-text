# JFK Library readied for opening
## 
### 
Boston (AP) â€” The famous
rocking chair, the carved
coconut shell, the doodles and
other flotsam and tokens of a
lifetime in public oftice are
back together, assembled in
the long-delayed )ohn F. Ken
nedy Library.
In a dramatic glass and con
crete building at the edge of
Boston Harbor, workers are
completing the exhibits that
will make the museum section
of the library a magnet for
tourists and Kennedy buffs.
The Kennedy tamily is turn
ing the library over to the fed
eral government on Oct. 20.

President Carter and dozens of
friends and appointees of the
late president will attend the
official ceremony.
The following Monday, the
public will get its tirst look at
what's inside. They will find a
slickly displayed collection of
the documents, gadgets and
trivia that were handled,
owned or somehow made spe
cial by Kennedy, his ancestors,
relatives and political pals.
For 75 cents, they can watch
a half-hour movie and browse
amid the exhibits, which takes
about an hour.
They will see the flag from

PT-109 and the coconut on
which Kennedy cut a plea for
help after the boat sank in
World War 11, Kennedy's col
lection of ship models and the
gown lacqueline Kennedy
wore to the inauguration. Also
included are Robert Kennedy's
Flarvard letter sweater, the
family Bible, campaign buttons
and telegrams sent between
the president and Soviet Pre
mier Nikita Khrushchev during
the Cuban missile crisis.
Their most arresting first im
pression, though, likely will be
the building itself, designed by
architect I.M. Pei. It is a

sculpture of dark glass am
gleaming white concrete at
ranged in three geometric
shapes.
The main building, whicl
holds the museum and ar
chives, is a nine-story triangl
lying on its side. Its point jut
into a soaring glass cube, ar
empty block crisscrossed b'
the matrix of steel that holds i
all in place. This room, callec
the pavilion, is decorated onl\
with a flag, and it is the last stof
on the museum tour.
Two movie theaters
Off to one side is a low circu
lar wing that holds the
museum's two 300-seat movie
theaters. The whole thing fits
together like a child's set of
blocks. It is expected to attract
one million visitors during its
first year of operation.
The building was con
structed with $18 million raised
by donations to a private cor
poration controlled by the
Kennedy family, who also ap
proved the introductory movie
and the exhibits.
"It's designed to give people
a sense of how the American
political system functions,"
said Director Dan Fenn, "how
campaigns are run, what the
presidency is all about, rela
tionships with the press and
what a cabinet officer does. We
hope the museum will give
people a little sense of the pro
cesses."
Politics displayed
Political campaign displays
and exhibits of artifacts show
the high points of foreign af
fairs and such domestic pro
jects as civil rights, the Peace
Corps and the space race. '
Mini-theaters show tapes of
presidential news conferences
and scenes from a typical day in
the White House.
Most of the exhibits are ar
ranged around a large round
room that holds a glassed-in
replica of the Oval Office as it
looked during the Kennedy
years. The desk, however, is a
copy, because the real one is
still in the White House.
