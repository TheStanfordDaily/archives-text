# Individual counseling available
## CAPS can help with adjustment 
### Laura Erickson 
If a problem is on your mind
and you want someone to talk
to, Cowell Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS)
can help.
CAPS, located in the rear of
Cowell infirmary and in Huston
House at 575 Salvatierra Street,
offers a "range of services from
individual counseling to group
workshops to help the Stan
ford student adjust to college
life," according to Barbara
Binkley, a social worker at
CAPS.
Binkley said that "CAPS prim
ary purpose is to offer indi
vidual counseling." Students
who would like counseling
should stop by or phone (497-
3785) for an appointment.
Emergency counseling is al
most always immediately avail
able, and a staff person is on
call 24 hours a day.
Special training
A staff of 24, all of whom
have at least master's degrees,
are available to counsel stu
dents. Most staff workers have
special training in a certain area
to better help students with
specific problems, Binkley
noted. Minority counselors are
also on the staff.
The difference between
CAPS and the Bridge, accord
ing to Binkley, is that many of
the services offered are similar,
but the Bridge is staffed by
peer counselors while CAPS is
staffed by professional mental
health workers. She added that
the Bridge will refer more seri
ous cases to CAPS.
A liaison from CAPS works
with the Bridge to coordinate
workshops and services.
Many seek help
Many students take advan
tage of the counseling ser
vices, Binkley said. Last year,
approximately 1700 students
visited CAPS every quarter.
More women sought advice
than men, and about half of the
visitors were graduate stu
dents. Binkely mentioned "the
pressures students experience
in grad school are pretty high."
She added, "More women
seek help than men all over the
country. Stanford follows the
norm in this respect."
Binkley also said, "A lot of
people think CAPS is a place to
come when they have a prob
lem. CAPS also offers preven
tive mental health services
such as training workshops
and group counseling ses
sions." This quarter, six work
shops on various subjects are
planned.
Asked how students reacted
to the workshops, Binkley re
plied, "They really seem to like

them. The workshops are al
ways very popular. Students
want to learn about the subject
of the workshop before they
get to a point where they really
need help."
Workshops
Binkley stressed that "all
workshops are oriented to
ward the concerns of the stu
dents who participate. Stu
dents get help with their
specific problems, not just
with general ideas."

The workshops are limited to
12-15 participants. Most are re
peated every quarter, so it's
possible to take a workshop
next quarter it it's already tilled
up this quarter.

this quarter:

Huston House is the location of the Cowell Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) here. The staff
consists of some 24 professionally trained social workers.
If a problem is on your mind
and you want someone to talk
to, Cowell Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS)
can help.
CAPS, located in the rear of
Cowell infirmary and in Huston
House at 575 Salvatierra Street,
offers a "range of services from
individual counseling to group
workshops to help the Stan
ford student adjust to college
life," according to Barbara
Binkley, a social worker at
CAPS.
Binkley said that "CAPS prim
ary purpose is to offer indi
vidual counseling." Students
who would like counseling
should stop by or phone (497-
3785) for an appointment.
Emergency counseling is al
most always immediately avail
able, and a staff person is on
call 24 hours a day.
Special training
A staff of 24, all of whom
have at least master's degrees,
are available to counsel stu
dents. Most staff workers have
special training in a certain area
to better help students with
specific problems, Binkley
noted. Minority counselors are
also on the staff.
The difference between
CAPS and the Bridge, accord
ing to Binkley, is that many of
the services offered are similar,
but the Bridge is staffed by
peer counselors while CAPS is
staffed by professional mental
health workers. She added that
the Bridge will refer more seri
ous cases to CAPS.
A liaison from CAPS works
with the Bridge to coordinate
workshops and services.
Many seek help
Many students take advan
tage of the counseling ser
vices, Binkley said. Last year,
approximately 1700 students
visited CAPS every quarter.
More women sought advice
than men, and about half of the
visitors were graduate stu
dents. Binkely mentioned "the
pressures students experience
in grad school are pretty high."
She added, "More women
seek help than men all over the
country. Stanford follows the
norm in this respect."
Binkley also said, "A lot of
people think CAPS is a place to
come when they have a prob
lem. CAPS also offers preven
tive mental health services
such as training workshops
and group counseling ses
sions." This quarter, six work
shops on various subjects are
planned.
Asked how students reacted
to the workshops, Binkley re
plied, "They really seem to like

them. The workshops are al
ways very popular. Students
want to learn about the subject
of the workshop before they
get to a point where they really
need help."
Workshops
Binkley stressed that "all
workshops are oriented to
ward the concerns of the stu
dents who participate. Stu
dents get help with their
specific problems, not just
with general ideas."

The workshops are limited to
12-15 participants. Most are re
peated every quarter, so it's
possible to take a workshop
next quarter it it's already tilled
up this quarter.
Workshops to be offered
this quarter:

Workshop: A training work
shop for students who want to
learn to communicate more ef
fectively under stress. Particip
