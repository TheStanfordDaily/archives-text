# Cards kiss Pac-10 sister USC in 21-21 shocker
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Los Angeles — It was Rocky
Balboa vs. Apollo Creed, Cas
sius Clay vs. Sonny Liston,
Leon Spinks vs. Muhammad
Ali, and it ended in a draw.
It was three-touchdown un
derdog Stanford coining from
three thouchdowns behind to
pull even with the University of
Southern California Trojans at
21-21.
It was a brash young fighting
team from Stanford remember
ing the beatings suffered the
last two years from the
heavyweight champions of col
legiate football, USC.
The Cardinals had a score to
settle Saturday, and they set
tled for a tie before a Trojan
homecoming crowd of 76,067,
but not before scaring the wits
out of the witless Trojans and
surely booting them out of
their number one ranking in
both wire service polls.
"Cain respect, all we wanted
to do was gain respect from
USC," said Stanford head
coach Rod Dowhower as he
slumped in a postgame chair.
Looking as if he had just played
four quarters himself,
Dowhower was obviously
proud of his squad, a team that
spotted USC 21 first-half
points.
Spotting that kind of team
that amount of points is akin to
giving Muhammad Ali first lick.
But Stanford did just that; they
gave USC first lick, got up,
dusted themselves off, and
proceeded to emotionally and

physically whip the Trojans in
the second half.
Two fights
It was two fights within one
— the first half dominated by
USC's White-lightning-quick
ground game, Charles White
slashing and jabbing through
the Stanford defense with the
deftness of a surgeon.
Yet in the second half Stan
ford counterpunched, solving
the dilemma of how to stop
USC's offense — they refused
to let them have the ball.
The second half was Turk
Schonert coming of age, coolly
directing the Cardinal offense
for over 20 minutes of the half,
•passing here, running there
and generally punishing a Tro
jan team that thought they had
laid another brick on the Rose
lined path to Pasadena.
Trojans rise
Yet, when down for the
count and seemingly surely
beaten, USC arose like a true
champion, stopping the Car
dinal offense and nearly deliv
ering a knockout punch of
their own.
With 53 seconds left in the
game, it looked as if Stanford
had it locked up. The Cards
had been marching confi
dently for almost two minutes
against a tired USC defense.
On the Trojans' 29-yard line,
third-and-five, Schonert took
the snap and began his bootleg
right.
He did not get very far.
Sneaking behind pulling tackle
Brian Holloway, defensive

tackle Dennis Edwards sacked
Schonert for a seven-yard loss.
Onto the field came last
week's hero, placekicker Ken
Naber. The slender blond set
the tee down at the 43-yard line
— three yards shorter than last
week's game winner as time
ran out against UCLA.
It was not meant to be — "I
mishit it," Naber related after
the game — and the Trojan
one-minute offense — the
same one that was employed
against Notre Dame last year to
win 27-25 — came onto.the
field.
Three completions, a pass
interference calT on Dave
Morze and 35 seconds later,
USC was on the Stanford 22-
yard line. It was their turn for
last-second heroics.
The ball never got off the
ground. Holder Scott Tinsley
fumbled the snapand was then
smothered by the Cardinal's
kickblockers and the game was
suddenly, anticlimactically
over, a 21-21 sister-kiss.
Elation, silence
One could not tell that no
one had won or lost by visiting
the respective locker rooms
after the game. While Stan
ford's was full of the electricity
and excitement of a winning
team, the USC rooms had the
aura of stillness and quietude
that usually accompanies the
short end of the score.
"It's a victory for the players
and the program," Dowhower
said. Interrupted every so

in Saturday's 21-21 standoff against number one ranked USC. Schonert's performance was outstanding and
confirmed his status as the Cards' starting quarterback.
often by congratulations from
both Stanford and USC parti
sans, he added, "It's an awfully
good tie after we beat UCLA
the week before."
"We had control and we let
them get away," said a disap
pointed USC head coach John
Robinson. "We gave them
some opportunities and they
made a great comeback. I
guess it's a shame nobody
won."
Individual stars
Not only was it a game of im
pressive half-performances
(USC —first half, Stanford—
second half) it was a game of
stunning individual perfor
mances as well.
For the Trojans, tailback
White had a Heisman-worthy
game. Averaging almost seven
yards a carry, White ran for 221
yards on 32 carries and two
touchdowns in becoming the
sixth leading rusher in NCAA
history.
For Stanford, Schonert
proved once and for all why he
is the starting quarterback.
Playing the entire second half,
Schonert completed 16 out of
27 passes for 163 yards, two
touchdowns and exhibited
supreme coolness in directing
the Cardinal attack into the
teeth of a supposedly invinci
ble defense.
"My hat is off to Schonert,"
Dowhower said. "He played a
marvelous game. We just went
into what worked best today
and that was Turk Schonert. I
have the same amount of con
fidence in Elway, and he prob
ably would've played the
fourth quarter had we not had
so much momentum behind
Schonert."
All USC
At the beginning of the
game, it was USC that had all

the momentum. The Trojans
won the toss and took the
opening kickoff 72 yards in
seven plays in only 2:42.
The story of the first half was
contained in that opening USC
drive. White gained 36 yards on
the first three plays, then alter
nated runs with quarterback
Paul McDonald's pinpoint pas
sing to score, the tailback
going the last eight yards.
Stanford, meanwhile, was
having uncharacteristic trou
ble moving the ball, getting but
one or two first downs at a time
before punting. The Cardinals
could not dent the Trojans' de
fensive line, thus the running
game was not moving.
Such was not the case with
the Trojans. The USC offense
swept down the field once
more as the first quarter en
ded, only to have placekicker
Eric Hipp badly hook a 24-yard
field goal. The score remained
7-0 but not for long.
Stanford, under the direc
tion of Elway, had moved to
midfield before halfback Mike
Dotterer was jarred free of the
ball by a Dennis Johnson
tackle. USC took over at the
Stanford 49 and breezed in in
nine plays, White once again
going the final foot. Hipp con
verted and at 14-0, it looked
like the USC scoring machine
was beginning to crank..
The defense set up the next
— and last — USC score'. On
the first play after the kickoff,
Elway overthrew halfback Vin
cent White in the right flat right
into the hands of cornerback
Herb Ward at the Stanford 26.
A Dan Floyd sack of
McDonald and a good one
on-one tackle of White by
safety Joe St. Ceme left the Tro
jans with a third-and-15 at the
31. Two plays later USC had
scored, as McDonald threw to

fullback Marcus Allen for 16
yards before Allen danced the
last 15 through the left side of
the field.
Thus it was USC 21, Stanford
0 at the half, and the Cards
looked as if they might be in for
the same type of afternoon as
they were two years ago
against USC in the Coliseum.
That final score was 49-0.
"At halftime, we analyzed
our game plan and decided to
stick with it. That first half was a
little frustrating, because we
shouldn't have been behind
21-0," Schonert said.
Certainly not if one checks
the halftime statistics. Even at
that point, the Cards had had
the ball more than the Trojans.
If anything, that was a har
binger of things to come.
The fun begins
Stanford took the second
half kickoff and marched 80
yards in 13 plays, the score
coming on a Schonert-to-
Dotterer swing pass that was
tailor-made to beat the blitz the
Trojans put on. Dotterer took
the ball at the 12 and tiptoed
down the left sideline, pirouet
ting over a USC defender to get
the six.
The teams traded possession
throughout the third period,
with the Cards starting their
second drive for a touchdown
late in the period.
That 11 -play, 61-yard drive
culminated in Margerum
catching his sixth touchdown
of the year with 12:23 to play in
the game.
"We ran a left side double
post," Margsrum said of the
nine yard pass from Schonert.
"I got all the way through their
defense and it works if I weave
through their linebackers
without getting a forearm."
The final touchdown — and

most convincing one — came
as a result of a 16-play, 87-yard
drive. The Cards had con
verted two third down situa
tions, when they found them
selves with a fourth-and-one at
the USC 11. Schonert took the
snap turned around and
pitched it to Mike Dotterer
who fumbled.
But wait! Dotterer scooped
up the ball, reversed direction
and ran 10 yards for a net gain
of one — but that was enough
for the first down.
Two plays later, Schonert rol
led left, saw the middle of the
field open and cut through to
the end zone, holding the ball
over his head the last five
yards. Naber converted and it
was a tie ballgame with 4:33 to
go-
That was how it ended — to
the chagrin of the number one
Trojans.
No 'rhythm'
"We (the offense) couldn't
get any rhythm," McDonald
said. "Whenever you have an
offense the caliber of ours, you
have to develop rhythm."
The Trojans had the ball for
only 9:22 throughout the final
two quarters, running but 23
plays as opposed to Stanford's
51. What McDonald meant was
you can't develop rhythm if
you don't have the ball.
"We shifted from an '80' de
fense to '50' defense," nose
guard Doug Rogers said. "We
went from a four-man line to a
three-man with two outside
linebackers (on the line)," he
explained. "We put pressure
on them and kept plugging
away."
Cards didn't die
Perhaps what Dowhower
was most proud of was that his
team refused to die.
"We learned to play that
sweep as the game went
along," Dowhower said. "It's
tough to duplicate it in prac
tice, so you keep playing. We
kind of got good, hung in there
and made good plays."
That brought Dowhower to
his most important point of the
game.
"I said all week we were just
going to have to stick with what

we were doing. It you get ou
of things and do things yoi
don't normally do, you ge
beat. I felt all along if we we
ren't flat whipped physically
we had a chance."
The Trojan defense wa
paralyzed by the passing ability
of the Cards — and Robinsor
did not like that at all.
"We got a little'numb — w<
were standing there hoping,'
Robinson said. "We got a little
frozen — instead of relaxing
and playing we got a little
tense.
"Maybe we should have
blitzed more. I am frustrated
by our inability to get to him
(Schonert). Both their quarter
backs have the ability to stand
back and throw. They have the
ability to run (too) — their
scrambling and running was an
important factor in their (S 112
ford) controlling the second
half," he added.
Complacency?
USC's second half alerted
the Trojans that not every game
is over after the first half —*
something not all of them
realized.
"I thought I had a little ten
dency to relax (in the second
half)," tailback White said. "I
had such an easy first quarter
(he gained 127 yards in the first
15 minutes) that I kinda got lac
kadaisical myself," he added.
The entire Stanford continl
gent was bursting with pride
about the character and fight-!
ing spirit shown by the Cards.'
"Some people say that 'ties
aren't very good,' " Schonert
said. "But the way this team
came back showed the charac
ter of this team no matter what
the odds are."
"We improve a little bit more
— each week we improve as a
team," Margerum said. The
fleet-footed junior caught six
passes for 104 yards and one
touchdown.
"They're amazing,"
Dowhower said of his charges.
"We were simply fighting for
our lives every minute of the ,
game. The players on the field
made it work — give them all
the credit."
Well, coach, maybe nota//of
the credit.
