# Cards kiss Pac-10 sister USC in 21-21 shocker
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Los Angeles — It was Rocky
Balboa vs. Apollo Creed, Cas
sius Clay vs. Sonny Liston,
Leon Spinks vs. Muhammad
Ali, and it ended in a draw.
It was three-touchdown un
derdog Stanford coining from
three thouchdowns behind to
pull even with the University of
Southern California Trojans at
21-21.
It was a brash young fighting
team from Stanford remember
ing the beatings suffered the
last two years from the
heavyweight champions of col
legiate football, USC.
The Cardinals had a score to
settle Saturday, and they set
tled for a tie before a Trojan
homecoming crowd of 76,067,
but not before scaring the wits
out of the witless Trojans and
surely booting them out of
their number one ranking in
both wire service polls.
"Cain respect, all we wanted
to do was gain respect from
USC," said Stanford head
coach Rod Dowhower as he
slumped in a postgame chair.
Looking as if he had just played
four quarters himself,
Dowhower was obviously
proud of his squad, a team that
spotted USC 21 first-half
points.
Spotting that kind of team
that amount of points is akin to
giving Muhammad Ali first lick.
But Stanford did just that; they
gave USC first lick, got up,
dusted themselves off, and
proceeded to emotionally and

physically whip the Trojans in
the second half.
Two fights
It was two fights within one
— the first half dominated by
USC's White-lightning-quick
ground game, Charles White
slashing and jabbing through
the Stanford defense with the
deftness of a surgeon.
Yet in the second half Stan
ford counterpunched, solving
the dilemma of how to stop
USC's offense — they refused
to let them have the ball.
The second half was Turk
Schonert coming of age, coolly
directing the Cardinal offense
for over 20 minutes of the half,
•passing here, running there
and generally punishing a Tro
jan team that thought they had
laid another brick on the Rose
lined path to Pasadena.
Trojans rise
Yet, when down for the
count and seemingly surely
beaten, USC arose like a true
champion, stopping the Car
dinal offense and nearly deliv
ering a knockout punch of
their own.
With 53 seconds left in the
game, it looked as if Stanford
had it locked up. The Cards
had been marching confi
dently for almost two minutes
against a tired USC defense.
On the Trojans' 29-yard line,
third-and-five, Schonert took
the snap and began his bootleg
right.
He did not get very far.
Sneaking behind pulling tackle
Brian Holloway, defensive

tackle Dennis Edwards sacked
Schonert for a seven-yard loss.
Onto the field came last
week's hero, placekicker Ken
Naber. The slender blond set
the tee down at the 43-yard line
— three yards shorter than last
week's game winner as time
ran out against UCLA.
It was not meant to be — "I
mishit it," Naber related after
the game — and the Trojan
one-minute offense — the
same one that was employed
against Notre Dame last year to
win 27-25 — came onto.the
field.
Three completions, a pass
interference calT on Dave
Morze and 35 seconds later,
USC was on the Stanford 22-
yard line. It was their turn for
last-second heroics.
The ball never got off the
ground. Holder Scott Tinsley
fumbled the snapand was then
smothered by the Cardinal's
kickblockers and the game was
suddenly, anticlimactically
over, a 21-21 sister-kiss.
Elation, silence
One could not tell that no
one had won or lost by visiting
the respective locker rooms
after the game. While Stan
ford's was full of the electricity
and excitement of a winning
team, the USC rooms had the
aura of stillness and quietude
that usually accompanies the
short end of the score.
"It's a victory for the players
and the program," Dowhower
said. Interrupted every so

Stanford quarterback Turk Schonert held the ball triumphantly over his head as he stored the tying touchdown
in Saturday's 21-21 standoff against number one ranked USC. Schonert's performance was outstanding and
confirmed his status as the Cards' starting quarterback.
