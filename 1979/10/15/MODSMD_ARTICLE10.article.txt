# Youth meet foreigners relax at Peking tavern
## 
### 
Peking (AP) — The liveliest
nightspot in town is a shabby
cafe where hundreds of young
Chinese smoke expensive
cigarettes, eat hot dogs and ice
cream sundaes, guzzle beer
and champagne and let off
steam.
A Chinese girl, her hair
curled by a permanent, her lips
blushing with a hint of lipstick,
boldly smokes a cigarette and
warms to the admiration of a
lonely African.
A 35-year-old philosophy
student eagerly asks Wester
ners about Hegel and Kant and
such films as "The Sound of
Music" and the vintage
"Waterloo Bridge."
Cafes like this existed in
China before Communist Party
radicals cracked down on fun
and frolic 14 years ago. After
years of austerity, this down
at-the-heels rendezvous is
something of an experiment,
officially condoned for the
present.
The brightly-lit cafe, with no
real name but known as the
Peace Hotel Cafe because it ad
joins the hostelry, has been
open since Jan. 1. More like a
soda fountain than a bar, it is a
meeting ground for Chinese
and foreigners.
The sometimes-raucous
room is filled with students,
laborers, professionals, the
unemployed and bored youth
returning from the coun
tryside.
Weighty discussions are
scarce; this is a decompression
chamber for fun-seekers, not
dissenters.
From 10a.m. tolOp.m. every
day, under the gaze of dour
plainclothes police, young

people park their bicycles in ;
gray alley and enter the narrow
dingy room, where plastic
flowers adorn the tables anc
Strauss waltzes fill the air.
They order and compulsively
devour an avalanche of food:
hot dogs, ice cream sundaes
vvith chocolate sauce, potato
salad, pastries, pickles, saus
age, milkshakes, mooncakes
and beer, always beer.
"My parents give me the
money for this," said one
young person who did not
want to be identified. Others
said the same.
. On a good day, one worker
said, the little cafe does abo:it
3000 yuan in business — about
$1250. It sells about 1000 bot
tles of beer and 500 of cham
pagne on such a day.
Waitresses referred other
queries to their supervisor,
who referred them to the man
ager, who referred them to the
information department of the
foreign ministry.
Each morning, the early
crowd sits killing time, waiting
for the government to assign
them work. A 14-year-old stu
dent pulls on his cigarette,
slops ice cream into his orange
soda and says he wants to prac
tice his English and get a good
job.
At night the cafe is jammed.
People stream in and out, mov
ing from table to table.
The harried and visibly vexed
waitresses are treated rudely,
but they hold their tongues in
front of these young high rol
lers with high connections.
A few girls come with
Chinese friends. Most are
smartly dressed in matching
pants and jackets, embroi
dered sweaters, dimestore
pins and even fake pearls. They
are boldly admired, or frankly
ogled, by African and Arab stu
dents, to the clear dismay of
Chinese men. Sometimes
there are fights.
A morose Egypt/an s/ts with a
few Chinese. "This is the only
place I can corbie and talk to the
Chinese," said the man, a lan
guage student. "Even so, no
body has much to say."
The 24-year-old son of a high
official who was purged but
rehabilitated after the cultural
revolution motions to Wester
ners to join him.
He said he's just entered col
lege, returning to school after
the 10-year turmoil of the cul
tural revolution. But school is
hard for him now. It bores him.
A diploma seems meaningless.
"Maybe my father can get me a
job. Something easy, then I will
have time to write my book.
"What's wrong with that?"
he asked. "Why shouldn't our
fathers help us? After all, we've
been through a lot. That's what
I will write about.

Peking (AP) — The liveliest
nightspot in town is a shabby
cafe where hundreds of young
Chinese smoke expensive
cigarettes, eat hot dogs and ice
cream sundaes, guzzle beer
and champagne and let off
steam.
A Chinese girl, her hair
curled by a permanent, her lips
blushing with a hint of lipstick,
boldly smokes a cigarette and
warms to the admiration of a
lonely African.
A 35-year-old philosophy
student eagerly asks Wester
ners about Hegel and Kant and
such films as "The Sound of
Music" and the vintage
"Waterloo Bridge."
Cafes like this existed in
China before Communist Party
radicals cracked down on fun
and frolic 14 years ago. After
years of austerity, this down
at-the-heels rendezvous is
something of an experiment,
officially condoned for the
present.
