# Iran cuts oil exports

New York (AP) — Iran appa
rently has drastically cut its oil
exports in recent days, oil in
dustry and U.S. government
sources said Friday. The
reasons for the cut were uncer
tain, but if prolonged, a reduc
tion could create a severe
squeeze in world oil supplies.
A government source said
world oil supply "is in very
tenuous balance — right on the
knife'sedge. This is not helpful
at all."
"Something is going on,"
said the source, who asked
anonymity. He said the Iranian
government had told several
oil companies in recent days
that shipments of oil from the
country would be delayed.
"Several oil companies have
been notified to push back
their October loadings" of oil
onto tankers, he said.
The delay was confirmed by
sources at a number of major
oil companies. "The ships are
backed up," said one at a com
pany that buys some oil from

Iran. "We don't know why."
A British publication, Lon
don Oil Reports, said a long
line of tankers has formed at
Kharg Island oil terminal, the
Iranian loading point in the
Persian Gulf.
Government and industry
sources were unable to esti
mate the extent of the apparent
reduction. But London Oil Re
ports said exports had been
reduced by 2.3 million barrels a
day to 1 million barrels. A bar
rel contains 42 gallons.
Earlier this week, the U.S.
trade publication Oil and Gas
lournal estimated Iranian pro
duction had dropped to 1 mill
ion barrels daily from the nor
mal level of about 4 million bar
rels. Because Iran consumes
about 700,000 barrels of oil a
day, that cut could reduce ex
ports to 300,000 barrels a day.
According to U.S. govern
ment figures, Iran supplies
about 900,000 barrels of oil a
day to the United States, about
12 percent of U.S. oil imports.
