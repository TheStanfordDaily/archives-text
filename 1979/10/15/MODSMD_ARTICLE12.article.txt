# French philosopher speaks on state power
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Michel Foucault, the
French philosopher and his
torian of thought, delved
last Wednesday into the
origins of the modern state
at the first of two Tanner
Lectures in Hunwi Values
scheduled this month.
Speaking to a full Memo
rial Auditorium, he
explained his interest in
analyzing human experi
ences such as madness and
sexuality and their relation
ship to the "technologies of
power." Foucault's books
on madness, the social sci
ences, medicine, prisons
and sexuality have made
him extremely influential on
the European continent and
more recently in English
speaking countries.
"Since the time of Kant,
the role of philosophy has
been to prevent reason
from going beyond what is
given in experience," said
Foucault. He sees himself as
continuing in that tradition.
The rationalization of
power is dangerous,
Foucault said, but this does
not mean that we have to
put reason on trial as did the
Frankfurt school. The
Frankfurt School of Social

Research grew before
World War II in fascist Ger
many and embraced
rationalism. The movement
had the American Marxist
philosopher Herbert Mar
cuse among its followers.
Foucauii biii u we do not
have to choose between
reason and unreason, but
have to liberate ourselves
by realizing what society
does to us. Many of the ac
tions we think are pre
determined are not, he said.
"The problem of self
identity, the problem of in
dividualizing power has be
come in the last 10 to 15
years what is maybe the
central problem in politics,"
Foucault said. This is true
for the women's liberation
movements as it is for the
movements of the sixties,
according to Foucault.
"Subjectivity does not
disappear when politics ap
pears," he said.
Thursday at a lunch with
undergraduates, he said
that since the French Re
volution, "The individual
has had no importance with
regard to society. The total
ity was the most important."
"With the failure of the
revolutionary theme is the

fact that the individual is be
coming for the first time a
political problem. The state
has to account for what it
does with individuals/'
Foucault said.
Since Jean-Jacques Rous
seau the state has evolved
toward a more centralized
form and has developed
techniques directed against
individualism, he said.

Foucault went on to
examine the roots of our
ideas of state power
originating in the ancient
cultures of Greece, Egypt,
Babylonia and Judaism,
among others.
"The problem of control
of the state or ruler is not
new," Foucault explained.
"The reason for insisting on
ancient texts is that they

show how early these prob
lems arose.
"The well-known welfare
state problem does not only
bring the needs of new gov
ernmental techniques to
light," Foucault said. It
must be recognized for
what it is: one of the ex
tremely numerous appear
ances of the tricky adjust
ment between political
power over the individual
and what Foucault calls
"pastoral power."
The metaphor of the ruler
as shepherd or pastor, as
the provider of food and
protection, comes mainly
from Egypt and Assyria,
Foucault said, and it was
even one of the titles of the
Assyrian kings.
The Greek notion of a
"shepherd" ruler was of
one that owned not the
people, but the land. It was
not the king that provided
mankind with food, but the
farmer. For the Greeks, the
ruler was one who appeases
conflict but not one who
guards the flock from day to
day.
The job of the politician in
Greece was "to weave a
strong fabric of the city,"
Foucault said.

The non-Greek, Mid-
Eastern ideas of the ruler
were altered by the clergy,
he said. The "shepherd"
had to assume responsibil
ity for the action of every
sheep and had to have the
compliance of the flock to
his will, Foucault said.
"For the Christians," he
continued, "sheep had to
be led every second. Those
who suffer no guidance
wither like a dead leaf."

examination and the idea of
progress towards perfec
tion of the self.
Part of our current prob
lems with state power is due
to the mixture of the two
traditions that combines the
notion of Creek "citizen
ship" with the "shepherd"
tradition, he said.
Foucault currently holds
the chair of the history of
systems of thought at the
College de France. The sec
ond and last lecture is set for
October 16.

power over the individual
and what Foucault calls
"pastoral power."
The metaphor of the ruler
as shepherd or pastor, as
the provider of food and
protection, comes mainly
from Egypt and Assyria,
Foucault said, and it was
even one of the titles of the
Assyrian kings.
The Greek notion of a
"shepherd" ruler was of
one that owned not the
people, but the land. It was
not the king that provided
mankind with food, but the
farmer. For the Greeks, the
ruler was one who appeases
conflict but not one who
guards the flock from day to
day.
The job of the politician in
Greece was "to weave a
strong fabric of the city,"
Foucault said.

The non-Greek, Mid-
Eastern ideas of the ruler
were altered by the clergy,
he said. The "shepherd"
had to assume responsibil
ity for the action of every
sheep and had to have the
compliance of the flock to
his will, Foucault said.
"For the Christians," he
continued, "sheep had to
be led every second. Those
who suffer no guidance
wither like a dead leaf."

examination and the idea of
progress towards perfec
tion of the self.
Part of our current prob
lems with state power is due
to the mixture of the two
traditions that combines the
notion of Creek "citizen
ship" with the "shepherd"
tradition, he said.
Foucault currently holds
the chair of the history of
systems of thought at the
College de France. The sec
ond and last lecture is set for
October 16.

Michel Foucault, the
French philosopher and his
torian of thought, delved
last Wednesday into the
origins of the modern state
at the first of two Tanner
Lectures in Hunwi Values
scheduled this month.
Speaking to a full Memo
rial Auditorium, he
explained his interest in
analyzing human experi
ences such as madness and
sexuality and their relation
ship to the "technologies of
power." Foucault's books
on madness, the social sci
ences, medicine, prisons
and sexuality have made
him extremely influential on
the European continent and
more recently in English
speaking countries.
"Since the time of Kant,
the role of philosophy has
been to prevent reason
from going beyond what is
given in experience," said
Foucault. He sees himself as
continuing in that tradition.
The rationalization of
power is dangerous,
Foucault said, but this does
not mean that we have to
put reason on trial as did the
Frankfurt school. The
Frankfurt School of Social

Research grew before
World War II in fascist Ger
many and embraced
rationalism. The movement
had the American Marxist
philosopher Herbert Mar
cuse among its followers.
Foucauii biii u we do not
have to choose between
reason and unreason, but
have to liberate ourselves
by realizing what society
does to us. Many of the ac
tions we think are pre
determined are not, he said.
"The problem of self
identity, the problem of in
dividualizing power has be
come in the last 10 to 15
years what is maybe the
central problem in politics,"
Foucault said. This is true
for the women's liberation
movements as it is for the
movements of the sixties,
according to Foucault.
"Subjectivity does not
disappear when politics ap
pears," he said.
Thursday at a lunch with
undergraduates, he said
that since the French Re
volution, "The individual
has had no importance with
regard to society. The total
ity was the most important."
"With the failure of the
revolutionary theme is the

fact that the individual is be
coming for the first time a
political problem. The state
has to account for what it
does with individuals/'
Foucault said.
Since Jean-Jacques Rous
seau the state has evolved
toward a more centralized
form and has developed
techniques directed against
individualism, he said.

Foucault went on to
examine the roots of our
ideas of state power
originating in the ancient
cultures of Greece, Egypt,
Babylonia and Judaism,
among others.
"The problem of control
of the state or ruler is not
new," Foucault explained.
"The reason for insisting on
ancient texts is that they

show how early these prob
lems arose.
"The well-known welfare
state problem does not only
bring the needs of new gov
ernmental techniques to
light," Foucault said. It
must be recognized for
what it is: one of the ex
tremely numerous appear
ances of the tricky adjust
ment between political
power over the individual
and what Foucault calls
"pastoral power."
