# A 						case for affirmative action: A. Esparza
## 
### Theresa Simons 
Though Andres Esparza says he
sometimes wonders if affirmative ac
tion provides an unfair advantage for
minorities, Ije is "sure that affirmative
action is still necessary in education."
"The number of minorities rep
resented in college constitutes a smal
ler percentage than is in the general
population. To become more a part of
the mainstream of the American way of
life, it's important that we (minorities)
become more educated," Esparza said.
Esparza is one of 12 engineering
graduate students enrolled at the Uni
versity under the sponsorship of the
National Consortium for Graduate De
grees for Minorities in Engineering
(GEM).
"The consortium provides fellowships
and summer work experience for qual
ified minorities. According to GEM lit
erature, the consortium was formed to

encourage minority men and women to
pursue advanced study in engineering
because a much smaller percentage of
minority engineering undergraduates
continue on to graduate education than
is reflected in the graduate population
as a whole.
After being accepted by GEM, Es
parza worked with minicomputer sys
tems for Argonne National Laboratory
during the summers of his junior and
senior years.
"I was using the job to check out dif
ferent options in electrical engineer
ing," he said. "The program provides
hands-on experience. It exposes you to
things you don't learn in books — you
learn what's expected ot you," Esparza
said.
Esparza worked with hardware,
which is working directly with electrical
components, and software, computer
programming. He said he found

software more interesting and will
probably pursue that area further in the
future.
Unlike most students with engineer
ing internships, Esparza received a full
engineer's salary for his summer work
at Argonne. Though the non-minority
interns at Argonne knew of this salary
difference, Esparza said he experi
enced no resentment or prejudice on
the job.
GEM, in cooperation with participat
ing industries and universities, pro
vides Esparza with his tuition and a
$4000 annual stipend while he is work
ing for his master's. The fellowship
does not extend beyond the master's
level. Esparza said he did not personally
wish to go beyond the master's level,
but said there were opportunities for
minorities who do wish to go on to doc
toral and post-doctoral work.
Nevertheless, there has been a de

cline of about 23 percent in graduate
minority enrollment at the University
during the past five year*, according to
Ed Escobar, assistant to the dean of
graduate studies. One cause, he said, is
the increased economic pressure of in
flation which usually weighs more
heavily on minorities.
"In addition, there is a bigger push
for affirmative action in industry, result
ing in more minorities being hired with
undergraduate degrees," he said.
Esparza is an exception. He did not
interview for jobs upon receiving his
undergraduate degree because he had
already chosen to go on to graduate
school in the GEM program.
Esparza stressed that those who re
ceived the benefits of a GEM fellowship
deserved it.
"They're bright people," he said.
"The consortium doesn't take just any
one out of college."
