## ASSU Senate endorsements 
### 
After two days of interviews with more
than 50 of the 80 candidates running for
ASSU Senate, theDa//y editorial board has
chosen to endorse the following senato
rial candidates.
The board only considered for en
dorsement those candidates who chose to
be interviewed by the Daily. Thus, some
candidates were not considered.
Nonetheless, the edit board was gener
ally favorably impressed with this year's
field of candidates — the largest in recent
years. The enthusiasm, dedication and
grasp of the ASSU organization in many of
the candidates was apparent.
Many candidates seemed sincerely in
tent on reforming the senate structure,
making campus issues the senate's priority
and considering world issues only when
relevant to students, and improving se
nate constituent communication through
mandatory meeting attendance, office
hours for senators and/or strengthened
senate committees.
There are a number of good ideas being
tossed about, including cooperative ser
vices for students and more student man
agement of campus organizations. Some
are feasible and others are not so realistic.
As in the past, there are candidates who
do not take the ASSU Senate seriously, or
are simply looking for something to add to
a resume.
But there seem to be enough candidates
who believe — and we agree with them —
that the ASSU Senate can only be a viable,

responsive and representative student or
ganization if the members themselves take
the organization seriously and recognize
the limitations of a student senate.
The Daily editorial board endorses the
following candidates:
Undergraduates
Steve Blum: junior, interested in options
to campus food services, realistic outlook
to focus of the senate.
Dick Butterfield: junior, sensitive to
views of independent campus organiza
tions.
Mark Epstein: freshman, has taken initia
tive to become familiar with several cam
pus issues.
Chris Greene: junior, has realistic prop
osals for organizational and budgetary as
pects of the senate.
T.J. Heyman: junior, proposes special is
sues committee to consider issues not co
vered by other senate committees.
Jeff Lepape: junior, has shown willing?
ness to take initiative by founding anti
draft organization on campus.
Jonathan McGee: freshman, well
informed and has strong potential for fu
ture leadership.
Ellyn Pildes: junior, interested in wo
men's issues and effective operation of
senate committees.
Leslie Torvik: senior, supports student
consumer movement, car and bike safety
and senate involvement in academic prog
rams.

Marc Ventresca: fifth-year senior, solid
record of involvement in campus projects.
Graduates
Jim Esserman: operations research, has
previous ASSU experience, hopes to fol
low through on projects begun last year.
Josh Censer: economics, member of
University nominations committee, good
grasp of campus issues.
Brian Leverich: operations research, has
extensive academic training and work ex
perience in management science.
Val Runge: medical school, former Stan
ford undergrad with sensitivity to under
graduate as well as graduate concerns.
Stan Sakabu: medical school, takes time
for undergraduate activities despite heavy
workload.
Fee assessments
The Daily strongly endorses both fee as
sessments on the ballot:
The Band: Inflation has taken its toll on
the Band and they need an additional
one-quarter assessment to do the same
amount of traveling they have done in the
past. They have relied on the same tunding
for the past six years.
Women's Center: The Center will receive
only $350 from the ASSU this year and
is in great need of a one-quarter fee as
sessment. All of their activities are free.
The Women's Center is growing rapidly
and has proposed a budget detailing
where all their fee assessment money
would be directed.
