## SU needs mascot, but not the Indian 
### 
As one who was brought up
on Stanford football, I re
member fondly the days of Pr
ince Lightfoot and the Stanford
Indians. So it was with mixed
emotions that I sat in the Stan
ford student section two
Saturdays ago and watched the
"return" of Timm Williams/
Chief Lightfoot.
Although alumni may have
cheered this figure from the
past, the reaction from the stu
dent section was mixed at best,
and my impression was that it
was, overall, negative and an
gry.
My own reaction was nega
tive also. Williams' presence
was, to me, the reopening of
an old wound. It was inapprop
riate, archaic and wrong.
As I watched Williams pass
through the section and then
onto the field, I realized, as the
alumni and the entire Stanford
community must now realize,
that the Indian can never again
be Stanford's mascot.
There are those who would
argue, as indeed I recently
might have, that the Indian

could be used as a symbol,
rather than as a mascot, and
hence not be subject to the
caricature and entertainment
aspects of being a mascot.
But the line between "sym
bol" and "mascot" is 100 fine,
and a symbol which dances on
the field, I realize now, will in
evitably be perceived as a mas
cot. The "symbol" solution is
not a viable one.
What can be done, then, to
end the "bring back the In
dian" campaign, to prevent the
reappearance of Timm Wil
liams and to reaffirm the
commitment to Native Ameri
cans which the University
made in its 1972 decision to
abolish the Indian mascot?
I believe that the answer is
simple: The University must
choose another mascot. The
"Cardinal" is a color, cardinal
red, not a bird. It is not a mas
cot.
There must be one mascot
behind which students,
athletes, faculty, staff and
alumni can unite. I do not have
the answer as to what that

should be; I do not believe that
it is as important which mascot
is chosen as it is that one is
chosen.
For as long as Stanford re
mains without a mascot, disun
ity among athletes, students,
alumni and faculty will reign,
and the campaign to reinstate
the Indian will continue to
plague us.
I urge the student body,
perhaps through the ASSU or
through student athletes, to
gether with the Administra
tion, the Athletic Department,
the faculty and the Alumni As
sociations,to form a commit
tee to choose a mascot im
mediately and to make a deci
sion soon, hopefully before
the next home football game,
in order to prevent Timm Wil
liams' reappearance.
Perhaps the choice could be
announced at Big Game. In any
case, the mascot issue can no
longer be seen as trivial in light
of Saturday's events. Only by
choosing a new mascot can we
show that we are no longer the
Stanford Indians.

The Stanford University Ad
ministration made a strong de
cision in 1972. In order to up
hold that decision, the Ad
ministration, the students, the
faculty and the Stanford
Alumni must now make a
strong decision by choosing a
mascot behind which Stanford
can unite.
