## Human survival uncertain 
### 
The SALT II debate between
Profs. Wolfgang Panofsky and
Edward Teller stimulated my
oyvn apprehensions on this
problem again as they have
done for 20 years.
Indeed I came to Stanford
and SLAC in the early 1960s in
part because I was horrified at
the policy of terror against
populations that I saw as a
member of the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory techni
cal staff.
Dr. Panofsky's strategy of re
straint seemed to provide a
reasoned alternative to this
complex problem. I still admire
his position, but I think there is
a fatal flaw even in Panofs
ky's logic.
Both Panofsky and Teller in
clude in their world view the
notion of "us and them" when
discussing defense issues. And
that is the flaw.
Having looked pretty care
fully at both political systems
and their defense arms, I am
persuaded by the argument of
the leadership of Common
Cause that we live in a "Special
Interest State."
What President Dwight
Eisenhower called the
"military-industrial complex"
and the "scientific
technological elite" have in
terests of their own which far
exceed any concern for the
"national interest."
I cannot accept the equation
of the interests of citizens in
general with the interests of
the defense industry, whether
publicly or privately adminis
tered.
There has been a dreadful
shift in public attitudes since
1914, when the involvement of
non-combatants as the pawns
of battle was universally rec
ognized as an atrocity.
Americans supported their
military in the two world wars
because our soldiers putfhem
se/ves at risk in pursuit of
humane political goals. Today
the American and Soviet
militarists make half the world
hostages in terror for purposes

long since forgotten.
We must deal with the reality
that state-subsidized interna
tional terrorist bureaucracies
are "them" wherever they are
based.
Civilian non-combatants
who refuse to participate in
planning for mass atrocities
become a genuine community
of interest in the modern era.
That is how "we" must be de
fined, and acted upon, before
any discussion of controls can
make much sense.

Until there is widespread
consensus on this issue, we
will live in times so demented
and distorted that human sur
vival is most uncertain.
In the absence of such.con
sensus of "our" interests, Dr.
Panofsky's arguments may be
adequate for a while.
In the meantime, all our lives
hang in the balance. I wouldn't
bet on the future.
