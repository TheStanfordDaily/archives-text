# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Leah Halper Women's center essential

Although the Stanford Women's Center has
been alive for ten years, it is still not, for many, a
viable part of the "Stanford Experience." In the
Oct. 16-17 ASSU elections voters will determine
whether they will pay a winter quarter fee as
sessment of one dollar to the Center. The impli
cations of that vote are as meaningful for the
community at large as they are for the Center
itself.
It is, perhaps, foolishly optimistic to expect
such a proposal to succeed on a campus where
male faculty members greatly outnumber
females, where role models for women are
scarce, where student leaders are most often
male, where rape and sexual assault are con
stant threats and where sex roles are often bor
rowed out of 1953.
Ironically, the life and purpose of the Center
is to fight these realities. Instead the Center still
fights for recognition.
Those who are voting face two issues. Is the
Center an organization benefiting all Stanford
students? And is the money really needed?
The name alone discourages many from visit
ing the Women's Center. That the Center was
founded to deal with issues of interest to women
should not, however, discourage men or non
feminists. Everyone is affected by rape, abor
tion, battered women and images of women in
advertising (like that of Dos Equis), even if indi
rectly.
By raising such issues, and keeping them in
the public eye, the Center helps stimulate action
and eventually change through community
education.
Open to all
Because our programming is of general in
terest, speakers, conferences, Tuesday gather
ings, parties and some workshops are open to
the public. Additionally, support and
consciousness-raising groups are offered.
And, an up-to-date referral file on Bay Area
services for women (and men) is available to
anyone who needs help. The Center's library is

free to students, and the facilities are a comfort
able place to study, talk or relax.
Funds needed
Does the Center need the money? Tradition
ally the energy of many volunteers and a few
work-study students, coupled with ASSU anc
special proposals, have seen the Centei
through.
Although the budget fluctuates, this year th<
ASSU has committed $350. Already $550 ha
been spent on programs, moving expenses fo
the new location in the Eating Clubs ana
fall projects. Without the fee assessment, th<
Center is $200 in debt before the year has ever
gotten off the ground.
'Red tape'
Of course, there are other ways to get money.
Proposals submitted to the University eventu
ally bring funds for specific projects. But work
ing through the red tape is a draining task when
staffers might be concentrating on better prog
ramming and resources. And University sources
often cannot fund honorariums or workshop
leaders.
The Center feels that free access to such
programs is important but, in the end, someone
has to pay to keep workshop leaders interested
in returning to Stanford.
In short, the Center needs a steady source of
funds that will cover a wide variety of programs,
A fee assessment is the best answer.
The importance of the role taken by the
Center is obvious and just about every Stanford
student can benefit from services offered.
Enough support for the Center exists on campus
to pass the fee assessment; whether those who
support the Women's Center actually vote is a
different question.
It would be wonderful to see people at the
polls this week, and even better if supporters of
the Center and its programs brought ten friends
with them to vote.

on behalf of the Stanford Women's Center.)
