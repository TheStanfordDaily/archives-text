## Examine senate candidates wisely 
### 
Most of us on campus will at
one time or another be ac
costed by a roving candidate
pleading for our vote and, if
not a candidate, then certainly
leaflets emblazoned with the
grins of America's future.
Last year 26 candidates ran
for the ASSU Senate. This year,
67 candidates — nine slates
and 23 individuals — are com
peting for office. This nearly
triples the number of grinning
faces we have to look at each
day, making a rational decision
more difficult than ever. Voters
will tend to rely on friendship
as the main voting criteria;
choosing a familiar face, a
once-heard name or using
some other equally baseless
selection rationale.
This kind of voter decision
making severely threatens the
effectiveness of the ASSU Se
nate. Senators elected in such

a fashion are less accountable
and responsible to the student
body.
This is a university — an in
stitution of higher learning.
We are her£ to educate our
selves and to be educated, to
learn how to in some way or
another taken control of our
lives and enter into the vaguely
defined realm of adulthood.
Mere material objects, such
as tennis court lights, will in no
way help us to achieve the
needed awareness that is man
dated by adulthood. What is
necessary is the exchange of
ideas — vigorous questioning
and requestioning of all that
exists around us.
Although not the answer to
all present problems, the Se
nate can provide a spark to ac
tion. It can learn and educate;
it can be responsive, but it
must change. In order to

change it needs, not experi
enced bureaucrats nor "un
aspiring politicos" but rather
people who will experiment
and take chances and attack
the job with heart.
When we scrutinize plat
forms we should demand that
candidates take substantive
stands on some of these is
sues: Senate reform, womens'
and minority issues and
student-operated services.
Responsible platforms
should deal with the districting
proposal — if in support, they
should explain why; if op
posed, they should give con
crete alternatives.
All candidates should de
monstrate their awareness of,
and commitment to women's
and minority concerns. The
current controversy surround
ing Chief Lightfoot must be put
to rest once and for all.

Women's and minority prog
rams should be clearly sup
ported and minority represen
tation in both student and fa
culty circles increased.
Regarding student services,
the Coffee House labor dis
pute has made us wonder why
students have not played a gre
ater role in operations such as
the Coffee House, the Transi
tion, and the Bookstore. Can
didates should examine the
potential of transferring con
trol of such services to stu
dents.
Let us vote carefully for
those who take the Senate
seriously. Examine each candi
date to see which ones mea
sure up to the yardstick of cre
dibility.
