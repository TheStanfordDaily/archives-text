Stanford's Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) has received a $1.9
million grant from the National Sci
ence Foundation (NSF) to purchase
operating time at the Stanford
Positron-Electron Asymetric Ring
(SPEAR).
Synchrotron radiation, generated
through normal operation of SPEAR,
is useless to physicists at SPEAR but
valuable to experimenters at SSRL
who are permitted to use it. But while
the arrangement has been a tre
mendous boon to SSRL, it has not
produced ideal experimental condi
tions, said SSRL's Operations Man
ager )ohn Cerino.
He explained that the energy level
at which SPEAR operates affects the
quality of the synchrotron radiation
produced. As SPEAR's operation is
extended to increasingly higher
energies, the quality of synchrotron
radiation improves.
Yet, the most interesting research

lately in high energy physics has re
quired SPEAR to operate at a level
lower than what is most beneficial to
experimenters at SSRL, according to
Cerino. Because SSRL's relationship
with SPEAR is "parasitic," SSRL scien
tists have had to accept the present
conditions, he said.
The NSF grant will end the depen
dent relationship and promises to in
crease SSRL's experimental capacity
enormously, however.
"For roughly 50 percent of the
running time during this coming fis
cal year, we (SSRL) will dictate the
operating parameters of the SPEAR
storage ring," Cerino said. "We will,
of course, tailor them to be suitable
for the maximum number of experi
ments."
The $1.9 million to be used at
SPEAR is part of the total $5.8 million
SSRL will receive in NSF grants dur
ing the 1980 fiscal year.
