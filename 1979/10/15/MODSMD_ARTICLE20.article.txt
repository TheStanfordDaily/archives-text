Reform U.S. politics
As editor of the World Affairs
Report I have to follow the
world press with singular care.
The Soviet press runs a con
stant campaign belittling
American politicians, describ
ing them as mass man
ipulators. Even the press of the
pro-American countries is ap
palled by the level of our politi
cians, notably those of Califor
nia.
There is something deeply
wrong with the system if the

best people avoid politics as a
career. In my many decades as
a professor, I have had only
one student who loudly proc
laimed his intention of going
into politics. He was I think the
most devious, underhanded
student I ever had, without the
redeeming quality of talent or
at least ability.
That was when I was a visit
ing professor at another in
stitution. There are of course
no students like that at Stan
ford.
Nevertheless the Stanford
student elections seem to con

sist primarily of plastering (he
campus with the names of the
candidates in large letters so
that even the semi-literate will
be programmed with the im
print.
All this in defiance of Univer
sity regulation about posters;
but why should future politi
cians worry about the law?
I have had some excellent
Stanford students who have
gone to Washington internship
programs, but little of this
seems to rub off on Stanford.
Why cannot Stanford politics

set an example by not treating
elections as a media event, by
not lousing up the Quad, but
by promoting serious, in
formed exchanges?
Stanford could lead the way
to a reformation in American
political life. We need this not
because of what the Russians
or anyone else think, but forits
own sake. Vet the battered
American image abroad should
be a matter of concern for us.
