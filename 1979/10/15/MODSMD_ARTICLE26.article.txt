# Kush dismissed over suit
## 
### 
Tempe, Ariz. (AP) — Frank
Kush, the nation's second win
ningest active football coach,
has had his coaching duties at
Arizona State stripped away.
But the reasons behind the ac
tion remain clouded.
The 50-year-old Kush,. a de
fendant in a $1.1 million dam
age suit filed by a former player
who claims Kush punched him,
says he's been fired. He main
tains that he was removed as
head coach — a post he has
held for 23 years — because his
boss didn't believe him when
he denied hitting Kevin Rut
ledge, a punter for the Sun De
vils during the 1977 and 1978
seasons.
Dr. Fred Miller, the Arizona
State athletic director who an
nounced Kush's dismissal
three hours before Arizona
State took the field, called the
action against Kush a suspen
sion. He said Kush would re
main on the faculty as an assis
tant professor of health and
physical education. However,
he said it "remains to be seen"
whether Kush would be
reinstated as coach.
Kush's career record rose to
a glittering 176-54-1 when an
emotional Arizona State team
gave him a farewell present by
upsetting sixth-ranked
Washington 12-7.

Miller told a news confer
ence Saturday night — after the
football game — that based
upon information received this
past week, he had removed
Kush as coach "pending
further review of the matter."
"Since there are other mat
ters surrounding my action
today that are involved in litiga
tion, I feel it would be impro
per for me to make public the
reasons for this decision," said
Miller. "However, I wish to
emphasize that his decision is
separate and apart from the
current litigation."
Pressed by reporters to give
a reason for Kush's dismissal,
Miller said, "I can't give it to
you."
Miller named Bob Owens, a
defensive assistant to Kush for
the past 12 years, as interim
head coach.
Kush had called a news con
ference three hours prior to
the start of the Washington
game, and told reporters that
he was being terminated, as of
Sunday. '
"What I cannot accept is the
manner in which this matter
was handled. No one can con
tradict rumors, innuendos or
untruths," said Kush, weeping

at times as he read a prepared,
one-page statement. "That is
why I feel so personally hurt
and troubled at the action
taken this weekend by Dr. Mil
ler."
