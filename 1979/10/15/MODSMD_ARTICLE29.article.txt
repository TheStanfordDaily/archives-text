# Cards enjoy 'October Bowl'
## 
### Chris Haft 
Los Angeles — All it lacked was an official
tjtle and a turn-of-the-year playing date,
and Saturday's Stanford-USC thriller
would have been mistaken for a bowl
game.
Certainly the usual bowl game ingre
dients were there: a big crowd in a big
stadium, a top-ranked team playing a
worthy challenger and more excitement
than a thousand roller-coasters could
generate.
Indeed, the spirit of last year's amazing
comeback victory in the Bluebonnet Bowl
was what ignited Stanford's reversal
Saturday.
Nearly to a man the Cards said that the
memory of defeating Georgia 25-22 after
falling behind 22-0 in the first half last Dec.
31 inspired them infinitely.
"Georgia was an outstanding team last
year, and USC was an outstanding team
this year . . . and we just weren't gonna
give up," quarterback Turk Schonert said.
"Everybody reminded each other of that
(the Bluebonnet Bowl) at halftime," safety
Joe St. Geme added.
The red-and-white hat linebacker Craig
Zellmer wore after the game caught the
gist of the halftime message Stanford ab
sorbed:
DON'T
PANIC
NO
PROBLEM
it read.
Stanford's problem in the first half was a
tentative, hesitant attitude, the inability to
play its game rather than let the Trojans
play theirs.
Tailback Mike Dotterer mentioned "in
timidation" when speaking of the Cards'
early faults. Cornerback Rick Parker elabo
rated more.
"We were just playing on our heels in
the first half," Parker said. "Wfe were wait
ing for them to do something, we weren't
attacking them. The different attitude was
just going out believing we could do it."

Roles, of course, were reversed after in
termission. "This is the greatest effort I've
ever been a part of," defensive tackle
Chuck Evans said. "We just knew we had
to keep plugging."
"From the freshmen to the fifth-year
seniors . . . you got such a great feeling
out there," flanker Ken Margerum said,
his voice quavering slightly from emotion.
From the freshmen to the fifth-year
seniors, it was a case of total domination
after halftime. The Cards possessed the
ball for 20:38 in the second half, the Tro
jans just 9:22. The Cards gained 17 first
downs to USC's eight, and ran 51 plays to
the Trojans' 23.
"They were panicking," Schonert said
of the Trojans. "They had no idea of what
we were ever going to do."
And in the middle of all this domination,
Schonert was the domineer. The many
Schonert critics can be quiet now, for in
throwing for Stanford's first two
touchdowns and running for the other,
Schonert proved his value as a quarter
back.
"He had a hell of a game," Margerum
said of the man who completed 16 of 27
passes for 163 yards. "He was ranked sec
ond in the Pac-10 (in passing) and sixth in
the nation, but people just gave him a bum
rap. He was great."
Schonert's 10-yard touchdown run, fit
tingly enough, tied the score. "That was
the biggest thrill of my life, (until) right
now," he exulted.
An equally exciting run was the one Dot
terer took two plays before Schonert'sTD.
On fourth-and-one from USC's 11-yard
line, the Cards sent Dotterer on a sweep
left. As the play developed it was apparent
that Dotterer was going nowhere, and to
make matters worse, he fumbled.
But Dotterer quickly picked the ball up,
reversed field and carried to the 10 for the
first down.
"I knew I was dead right there (after
fumbling)," he said, "so I s-aid, Hey,

they're flowing left,' so I went back
around."
Dotterer made another eventful jaunt
on what became Schonert's first TD pass.
To get to the end zone, Dotterer had to
tightrope down the sideline and then
somersault over a Trojan.
"I know in college you've gotta keep
going forward because guys are fast," the
6-foot, 183-pounder said. "You can't just
jitterbug around, so I kept going forward."
Stanford's going forward with the pass
was something that the Trojans were
especially fearful of. As a result, the Cards
didn't complete any bombs, but they did
succeed on most of their shorter attempts.
"The defensive backs didn't want to give
up anything deep," said split end Andre
Tyler, who took advantage of this by catch
ing six passes for 75 yards.
By contrast, the Cards' defense paid
close attention to USC's runningbacks,
particularly Charles White. White ran for a
career-high 221 yards on 32 carries, but
gained just 52 yards in the second half —
and just nine in the fourth quarter.
The Heisman Trophy candidate also
fumbled twice, once late in the third quar
ter when freshman noseguard Dennis
Engle hit him. Linebacker Terry Rennaker
fell on the ball, setting up Stanford's sec
ond touchdown.
"In the second half guys were swarming
the ball — that's what you need," Evans
asserted.
One man who has been swarming the
ball on field goal attempts is Gordon
Banks. After blocking three-point tries in
the Boston College and UCLA games,
Banks came up with his third snuff in three
weeks when he smothered Eric Hipp's 39
yard attempt as time ran out.
A poor hold mainly caused Hipp's fai
lure, but Banks was responsible for even
this. When asked if he thought the Trojan
kicking unit was conscious of him, Banks
stated flatly, "Without a doubt." His repu
tation, it appeared, preceded his arrival in
Los Angeles.
