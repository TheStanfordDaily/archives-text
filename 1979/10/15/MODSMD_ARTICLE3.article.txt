# Eighty students compete for senate offices

### Richard Kim 
Eighty students will compete for 20
spots on the ASSU Senate tomorrow
and Wednesday. What motivates
these people to seek a job that has, in
the past, required much time
consuming effort and garnered little
show of public appreciation?
According to ex-senator Ron
johnson, last year he spent "from six
hours up to 60 hours a week" work
ing on senate business. When asked
why he thought students ran for the
senate, johnson replied, "there are
as many reasons as there are stu
dents."
"For me," Johnson continued,,
"there waS the desire to give to the
University and to learn how the Uni
versity and political institutions op
erate."
Another ex-senator, Ted Gar
denswartz, echoed )ohnson's senti
ments. "I felt that I could do a lot for
the University."
Former Sen. Alex Alben said he be
lieves students "look at it as a chal
lenge to see if you get elected. It's a
test of your campaigning skills, per
sonality and perseverance. You
learn how to sell yourself."
lorn Cart, a member of last year's
senate and now on the Council of
Presidents (COP), regards the senate
as "a way to become active in school
and possibly benefit the students.
You get your hands on a lot of areas,"
he added.
Current aspirations
Many of the interviewed candi
dates have more singular reasons for
running. "I think it will be fun and
exciting. I have to do something be
cause I haven't done much around
here," said a junior canuidate.

"I'm running so I can actually do
the things I'd like to get done," con
fessed another potential senator.
The belief that all candidates envi
sion a senatorial position primarily as
a means to embellish their graduate
school applications was mentioned
often by both the candidates and the
ex-senators. "If you are running for
selfish reasons, that won't sustain
you," through the campaign, Alben
commented.
"The senate is not that impressive
a thing to be on," Gart claimed.
Law school preparation
A current candidate explained,
"Grad schools don't look as much at
your activities as colleges do. The
time involved in the senate is defi
nitely more than a five or six unit
class. If you were really interested in
law school, you could use the time to
study, to cram or to take an LSAT
course or something, and in the long
run, if you were pragmatic about it,
that would help you get into law
school a lot more."
Nonetheless, all the candidates in
terviewed listed law school as one of
their alternatives after graduation,
lohnson noted, however, that "the
most effective senators are the aspir
ing politicos who want to go to law
school."
For the most part, all the ex
senators interviewed considered the
senate to be a worthwhile experi
ence. Yet Mary Bateson, a senator of
two years ago, argued that the senate
"ended up being a big waste of
time." She also contended that the
senate should be disbanded because
it "seems to serve no purpose."
Publicity problem
Members of last year's senate said

that the media gave too much atten
tion to the off-campus issues while
virtually ignoring their on-campus
accomplishments.
"Last year the senate," according
to johnson, "did as much as they
could have. The students got the im
pression thai all the senate worked
on were the Bhutto and Coors issues
because the Daily chose those issues
to center their articles."
Gardenswartz remarked, "It'sfrus
trating to look at all those campaign
posters. We (last year's senate)
wanted to do the same things, but we
got tied down in bureaucracy and the

machinations of the senate. I've
learned that are certain
changes that can't be done by stu
dents."
Last year, the senate arranged for
lighting on the tennis courts, lifted
the bottle ban, arranged to have mail
delivered to all residences free of
charge, formed a task force on con
sumer affairs that investigated prices
in the Bookstore, Tresidder and food
service, Alben said. In addition, the
senate worked toward more lighting
on campus, preventing theft on
campus and acted as a consultant on
the new housing projects.
