# Poloists show who is boss in L.A.

### Brad Brockbank 
Bouncing back from last
week's loss to UCLA, the Stan
ford water polo team regained
its ability to dominate the
Pacific-10 Conference, beating
UCLA and USC in Los Angeles
over the weekend 8-6 and 9-7,
respectively.
And domination is what it
was, as the Cardinals led both
teams by as much as four goals
throughout the second halves
of both games.
Friday, with "a little revenge
in our minds," according to
Stanford coach Dante De
ttamanti, the Cards jumped out
in front of the Bruins and were
never seriously challenged for
the lead.
A 3-1 first quarter advantage
grew into a 5-2 margin by
halftime. The teams traded a
pair of scores in the third quar
ter, and sophomores Alan
Mouchawar and Chris Kelsey
fouled out of the game.
In the fourth quarter, with
Dettamanti substituting freely
to rest his starters for Satur
day's contest with USC, the
Cardinal second unit held off
the Bruins for the victory.
Freshman standout |amie
Bergeson led the Stanford
scoring attack with three goals,
two of which came during the
first quarter onslaught. )ody
Campbell contributed two,
and Mouchawar, Kelsey and
Smith each added one.
"The team really jelled
(against UCLA)," said De
ttamanti. "There was a lot of
communication. The loss was

one of the best things ihat
could have happened to us. It
really brought the team to
gether."
Until this weekend, Trojan
landers were talking about br
inging the NCAA champion
ship trophy back to USC this
year. The fourth-ranked Trojan
poloists were having their most
promising season in several
years and had already beaten
Card-conqueror UCLA.
But Stanford, the defenders
of that national title USC wants
so badly, shattered the Trojans'
hopes of an upset win.
"I'd say we dominated all
phases of the game," De
ttamanti said. "We took advan
tage of every opportunity."
As they did against the
Bruins, the Cards got ahead
early, running up a 3-1 lead by
the second quarter. But USC
fought back before the half
ended to tie the game at three.
Only a last-minute shot by
Randy Kalbus, who had gotten
inside the Trojan defense, gave
Stanford the edge at halftime.
Coming out for the second
half, however, the complexion
of the game quickly changed.
Stanford began to consistently
get men free on the counter
attack, something which usu
ally bodes ill for Card oppo
nents. For USC, it boded ejec
tions.
Two Trojan kickouts resulted
in goals by Bergeson and
Kelsey. Another Stanford
counter-attack resulted in the
favorable combination of

Kelsey to Smith to goal net. Al
most before the Trojans knew
what hit them, they were trail
ing by four goals — a margin
that held up through half of the
fourth period.
Though the Cardinals scored
only rarely on the counter
attack this weekend, De
ttamanti said that is not its only
purpose.
He explained that the
counter not only tires the other
team out, it also keeps them
worried on offense, which can
be distracting. He also said that
the counter allows Stanford to
get down the pool quickly, giv
ingthem more time to run their
offense.
"There are more ways of
stopping the counter," he ad
ded, "but it takes away from
your offense if you try."
Dettamanti lauded his
team's defensive play against
the southland teams. "The
only reason UCLA was even in
the game," he said, "was be
cause of some questionable
calls (by the referee) as far as
I'm concerned. There was a
great imbalance in the ejec
tions.
"The team defense is really
excellent," he added. "The
coordination is really there,
and that's the hardest thing to
learn. Now it's to the point
where (the players) know
(they're) going to have help."
The coach also commended
the play of Kelsey and goalie
)ohn Gansel.
"John played very well," he

said. "He played the way he's
capable of playing. It's difficult
for anyone to beat us when
)ohn plays the way he played
this weekend."
Kelsey, who scored four
goals against USC, is "really
developing into an offensive
threat," according to De
ttamanti.
The Cards are now 3-1 in
Pac-10 play and 14-2-1 overall.
Although California has only
played two conference games,
they have won both, putting
them ahead of the Cards in the
race for the Pac-10 title. The
two teams will not face each
other until November.

attack, something which usu
ally bodes ill for Card oppo
nents. For USC, it boded ejec
tions.
Two Trojan kickouts resulted
in goals by Bergeson and
Kelsey. Another Stanford
counter-attack resulted in the
favorable combination of

Kelsey to Smith to goal net. Al
most before the Trojans knew
what hit them, they were trail
ing by four goals — a margin
that held up through half of the
fourth period.
Though the Cardinals scored
only rarely on the counter
attack this weekend, De
ttamanti said that is not its only
purpose.
He explained that the
counter not only tires the other
team out, it also keeps them
worried on offense, which can
be distracting. He also said that
the counter allows Stanford to
get down the pool quickly, giv
ingthem more time to run their
offense.
"There are more ways of
stopping the counter," he ad
ded, "but it takes away from
your offense if you try."
Dettamanti lauded his
team's defensive play against
the southland teams. "The
only reason UCLA was even in
the game," he said, "was be
cause of some questionable
calls (by the referee) as far as
I'm concerned. There was a
great imbalance in the ejec
tions.
"The team defense is really
excellent," he added. "The
coordination is really there,
and that's the hardest thing to
learn. Now it's to the point
where (the players) know
(they're) going to have help."
The coach also commended
the play of Kelsey and goalie
)ohn Gansel.
"John played very well," he

said. "He played the way he's
capable of playing. It's difficult
for anyone to beat us when
)ohn plays the way he played
this weekend."
Kelsey, who scored four
goals against USC, is "really
developing into an offensive
threat," according to De
ttamanti.
The Cards are now 3-1 in
Pac-10 play and 14-2-1 overall.
Although California has only
played two conference games,
they have won both, putting
them ahead of the Cards in the
race for the Pac-10 title. The
two teams will not face each
other until November.
Bouncing back from last
week's loss to UCLA, the Stan
ford water polo team regained
its ability to dominate the
Pacific-10 Conference, beating
UCLA and USC in Los Angeles
over the weekend 8-6 and 9-7,
respectively.
And domination is what it
was, as the Cardinals led both
teams by as much as four goals
throughout the second halves
of both games.
Friday, with "a little revenge
in our minds," according to
Stanford coach Dante De
ttamanti, the Cards jumped out
in front of the Bruins and were
never seriously challenged for
the lead.
A 3-1 first quarter advantage
grew into a 5-2 margin by
halftime. The teams traded a
pair of scores in the third quar
ter, and sophomores Alan
Mouchawar and Chris Kelsey
fouled out of the game.
In the fourth quarter, with
Dettamanti substituting freely
to rest his starters for Satur
day's contest with USC, the
Cardinal second unit held off
the Bruins for the victory.
Freshman standout |amie
Bergeson led the Stanford
scoring attack with three goals,
two of which came during the
first quarter onslaught. )ody
Campbell contributed two,
and Mouchawar, Kelsey and
Smith each added one.
"The team really jelled
(against UCLA)," said De
ttamanti. "There was a lot of
communication. The loss was

one of the best things ihat
could have happened to us. It
really brought the team to
gether."
Until this weekend, Trojan
landers were talking about br
inging the NCAA champion
ship trophy back to USC this
year. The fourth-ranked Trojan
poloists were having their most
promising season in several
years and had already beaten
Card-conqueror UCLA.
But Stanford, the defenders
of that national title USC wants
so badly, shattered the Trojans'
hopes of an upset win.
"I'd say we dominated all
phases of the game," De
ttamanti said. "We took advan
tage of every opportunity."
As they did against the
Bruins, the Cards got ahead
early, running up a 3-1 lead by
the second quarter. But USC
fought back before the half
ended to tie the game at three.
Only a last-minute shot by
Randy Kalbus, who had gotten
inside the Trojan defense, gave
Stanford the edge at halftime.
Coming out for the second
half, however, the complexion
of the game quickly changed.
Stanford began to consistently
get men free on the counter
attack, something which usu
ally bodes ill for Card oppo
nents. For USC, it boded ejec
tions.
