# Delgado header wins marathon at San Jose
## 
### Dean Eyre 
San Jose — It took an hour
and 39 minutes to realize and
another 11 minutes to confirm,
but Stanford upset San Jose
State in a 2-1 overtime soccer
thriller Saturday night at Spar
tan Stadium, ending a half
decade dominance in the
Spartan-Cardinal series.
• Besides puttingan end tothe
San Jose win streak, the victory
also raises the Cards' overall
record to 9-1-1 and puts them
in the Pacific Soccer Confer
ence top spot with a 2-0 mark.
The win before 800 spec
tators, along with the 3-0 blank
ing of Sacramento State Thurs
day afternoon, may also erase
the 2-1 loss to Hayward State
earlier last week as far as the
Western regional rankings are
concerned — the Cards now
have a much improved chance
of holding their sixth-place rat
ing and could even advance a
notch.
As for the Spartans, the loss
drops their record to 8-2 and
places their fourth-place rating

in doubt.
From almost any angle, the
match was extremely satisfying
for the Cards. Not only did the
game bolster the team's out
look on paper regarding the
conference race and regional
ranking, but more importantly
the effort also solidified a team
performance in every sense of
the word.
Senior Laird Cagan noted,
"The big difference is that it
was a team game. It was in
tense, there was no let-up."
"I think it's the first game this
season where we've played to
gether with a team feeling,"
said sophomore striker Ted
Rafalovich. "It reminds me of
the Cal game last year." When
it was pointed out that the
match with Berkeley came at
the end of last season and the
'79 campaign is only at mid
point, Rafalovich replied,
"We're that far ahead."
Junior midfielder Dan
McNevin said that the San Jose
match-up is "always a good
game, but it's getting better

every year because we're get
ting better. That's due to team
intensity. It (the intensity) can
go a lot higher, it's just starting,
right at the start of the tough
part of our season.
"We're gaining poise —
learning when to pass, when to
hold the ball. A lot of frustra
tion has dissipated," he added.
Although playing well
against tough teams in the
past, including the best soccer
team in the nation, USF, both
during regular season play and
in the NCAA playoffs last
November, the veterans
unanimously named the Spar
tan defeat as the top perfor
mance of their careers.
"I'm as high as a kite," De
lgado proclaimed in the locker
room. "We haven't beaten San
Jose before in my four years
here. It's the greatest victory
been in in four years."
"It's the best game we've
played all season, probably the
best since I've been here," said
senior Craig Ueland, who had
to vacate his goalkeeper posi

tion early in the game due to
sore ribs, suffered when
kicked in the Washington
game and reinjured in practice.
While there were a number
of fourth-year vets celebrating
their first victory over Sparta, a
surprising aspect of Stanford's
showing was that three
freshmen each played close to
the full 110 minutes of regula
tion and double overtime.
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge lauded the perfor
mances of rookies Mark Tal
kington, Doug Clarke and Jeff
Jones as well as starters Neil
Tennyson and Delgado.
"That was a heck of a game to
step into," said Jones, who fil
led in for Ueland at keeper. "I
wasn't really nervous. I was
pretty-well psyched because
Craig told me he might not be
able to play."
Following the win over Sac
ramento State, Lodge pre
dicted that the San Jose game
would be "tough if we don't
score early. Momentum is im

portant — we have to get a
quick goal."
First came the quick score as
Willie Cuicce lined a penalty
shot off of the Spartans' goal,
then off their keeper and into
the net to give the Cards a 1-0
lead less than 11 minutes into
the game
San Jose tied the score with
under three minutes left in the
half. At halftime, Lodge
foresaw a 2-1 Stanford win. The
go-ahead play came about an
hour later, a Delgado header
on a Cagan assist to give Stan
ford the hard-earned win, 2-1.
The net result of the San Jose
acid test was a new-found con
fidence, necessary to propel
the Cards against a labyrinth of
tough opponents over the next
three weeks, starting with San
Francisco State Tuesday at 3
p.m.
Tennyson summed up that
confidence: "I don't think
anyone felt were going to lose
— it means Hayward was no
thing."

San Jose — It took an hour
and 39 minutes to realize and
another 11 minutes to confirm,
but Stanford upset San Jose
State in a 2-1 overtime soccer
thriller Saturday night at Spar
tan Stadium, ending a half
decade dominance in the
Spartan-Cardinal series.
• Besides puttingan end tothe
San Jose win streak, the victory
also raises the Cards' overall
record to 9-1-1 and puts them
in the Pacific Soccer Confer
ence top spot with a 2-0 mark.
The win before 800 spec
tators, along with the 3-0 blank
ing of Sacramento State Thurs
day afternoon, may also erase
the 2-1 loss to Hayward State
earlier last week as far as the
Western regional rankings are
concerned — the Cards now
have a much improved chance
of holding their sixth-place rat
ing and could even advance a
notch.
As for the Spartans, the loss
drops their record to 8-2 and
places their fourth-place rating

in doubt.
From almost any angle, the
match was extremely satisfying
for the Cards. Not only did the
game bolster the team's out
look on paper regarding the
conference race and regional
ranking, but more importantly
the effort also solidified a team
performance in every sense of
the word.
Senior Laird Cagan noted,
"The big difference is that it
was a team game. It was in
tense, there was no let-up."
"I think it's the first game this
season where we've played to
gether with a team feeling,"
said sophomore striker Ted
Rafalovich. "It reminds me of
the Cal game last year." When
it was pointed out that the
match with Berkeley came at
the end of last season and the
'79 campaign is only at mid
point, Rafalovich replied,
"We're that far ahead."
Junior midfielder Dan
McNevin said that the San Jose
match-up is "always a good
game, but it's getting better

every year because we're get
ting better. That's due to team
intensity. It (the intensity) can
go a lot higher, it's just starting,
right at the start of the tough
part of our season.
"We're gaining poise —
learning when to pass, when to
hold the ball. A lot of frustra
tion has dissipated," he added.
Although playing well
against tough teams in the
past, including the best soccer
team in the nation, USF, both
during regular season play and
in the NCAA playoffs last
November, the veterans
unanimously named the Spar
tan defeat as the top perfor
mance of their careers.
"I'm as high as a kite," De
lgado proclaimed in the locker
room. "We haven't beaten San
Jose before in my four years
here. It's the greatest victory
been in in four years."
"It's the best game we've
played all season, probably the
best since I've been here," said
senior Craig Ueland, who had
to vacate his goalkeeper posi

tion early in the game due to
sore ribs, suffered when
kicked in the Washington
game and reinjured in practice.
While there were a number
of fourth-year vets celebrating
their first victory over Sparta, a
surprising aspect of Stanford's
showing was that three
freshmen each played close to
the full 110 minutes of regula
tion and double overtime.
Stanford head coach Nelson
Lodge lauded the perfor
mances of rookies Mark Tal
kington, Doug Clarke and Jeff
Jones as well as starters Neil
Tennyson and Delgado.
"That was a heck of a game to
step into," said Jones, who fil
led in for Ueland at keeper. "I
wasn't really nervous. I was
pretty-well psyched because
Craig told me he might not be
able to play."
Following the win over Sac
ramento State, Lodge pre
dicted that the San Jose game
would be "tough if we don't
score early. Momentum is im

portant — we have to get a
quick goal."
First came the quick score as
Willie Cuicce lined a penalty
shot off of the Spartans' goal,
then off their keeper and into
the net to give the Cards a 1-0
lead less than 11 minutes into
the game
San Jose tied the score with
under three minutes left in the
half. At halftime, Lodge
foresaw a 2-1 Stanford win. The
go-ahead play came about an
hour later, a Delgado header
on a Cagan assist to give Stan
ford the hard-earned win, 2-1.
The net result of the San Jose
acid test was a new-found con
fidence, necessary to propel
the Cards against a labyrinth of
tough opponents over the next
three weeks, starting with San
Francisco State Tuesday at 3
p.m.
Tennyson summed up that
confidence: "I don't think
anyone felt were going to lose
— it means Hayward was no
thing."
