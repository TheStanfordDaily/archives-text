# Pirates stay alive with 7-1 drubbing of O's

### 
Pittsburgh (AP) — Bill Mad
lock ripped four hits and Tim
Foli drove in three runs as the
Pittsburgh Pirates, battling to
stay alive, defeated the Balti
more Orioles 7-1 yesterday in
Came Five of the 1979 World
Series.
The victory left the Pirates
still trailing the best-of-seven
Series 3-2 but forced the teams
back to Baltimore for a sixth
game tomorrow night. Came
Seven, if needed would be
played Wednesday night.
The Pirates had hoped to
start Bert Blyleven in Game Six,
but that plan was changed
when Manager Chuck Tanner
brought him out of the bullpen
Sunday for his first relief ap
pearance since 1972.
Blyleven allowed three hits
over the final four innings to
complete a six-hitter. Jim
Rooker had pitched the first
tive innings and left the game
trailing 1-0.
Fhe Pirates came up with
two-run innings in the sixth
and seventh to turn the game
around. The catalysts in both
rallies were the slap-hitting Foli
and slugger Dave Parker.
Then Pittsburgh sealed the
victory with a three-run eighth
built around Madlock's fourth
single of the game and a bases
loaded, two-out two-run single
by Foli.
Mike Flanagan, winner of
Came One in this Series, had
the Pirates shut out over the
first five innings and was lead
ing 1-0 on a run the Orioles
scratched off Rooker in the

fifth.
Foli opened the Pittsburgh
sixth with a walk on a 3-1 pitch.
Parker, who had struck out in
each of his first two at-bats
Sunday, followed with a single
to center.
With the Three Rivers
Stadium crowd of 50,920 chant
ing "Let's Go Bucs!" Tanner
had cleanup batter Bill Robin
son bunt the runners along.
It was an interesting strategy
move because earlier in the
Series Baltimore Manager Earl
Weaver had suggested that
bunting might not be such a
good idea because it means
your team is playing for a single
run. But the Pirates got two this
time.
Willie Stargell lifted one of
his patented rainbow fly balls
to center field. Al Bumbry set
tled under it easily but Foli
scored after the catch, tying
the game 1-1.
Parker moved to third on the
play and came home a moment
later when Madlock muscled
his third of four singles in the
game — this one into center
field.
With the Pirates in front, Bal
timore tried to play catch-up
baseball — an Orioles specialty
all season. But the Bucs we
ren't yielding.
After Blyleven retired the
first two hitters in the seventh,
catcher Rick Dempsey hustled
a routine hit into a double.
Now Weaver went to his
bench, which has been so suc
cessful throughout the Series.
Pat Kelly was sent up to bat for

Flanagan and Blyleven re
sponded by striking him out on
a 2-2 pitch.
Quickly, the Bucs went
about the work of adding to
their lead in the seventh.
Garner opened with a bouncer
to shortstop that took a huge
hop off the artificial surface in
field and went for a single.
Blyleven tried to sacrifice,
but forced Garner at second.
Then shortstop Kiko Garcia
made a brilliant stop on Omar
Moreno's shot up the middle
and turned it into another
force play.
Now Moreno began a cat
and-mouse game with relief
pitcher Tim Stoddard, who was
obviously concerned about the
fleet Pirate's speed. Stoddard
threw over to first base three
times while working to Foli.
The fourth throw, however,
got away and Moreno reached
second on the pitcher's error.
That was the break the Pi
rates needed. Foli rifled the
next pitch up the gap in right
center field, scoring Moreno to

make it 3-1. Left-hander Tippy
Martinez relieved for Balti
more and Parker upset that
strategy with a double for
another Pirates run.
Pittsburgh added to its cush
ion in the eighth inning after
Stargell and Madlock opened
with singles. It was Madlock's
fourth hit of the game, making
him the third player in this
Series to tie that single-game
record and the 39th in the 76-
year history of the Series to do
it.
After Steve Nicosia fouled
out, Garner drilled an RBI
single to left. It was Garner's
second hit of the game and
ninth of the Series, and kept
his batting average at .500 for
five games.
Blyleven bunted the runners
up and Moreno got an inten
tional walk, loading the bases.
That brought up Foli and, with
the crowd chanting his name,
he bounced a single up the mid
dle to drive in two more runs
and turn the game into a rout.
Rooker, the 37-year-old

left-hander who had spent
eight weeks on the disabled list
this season, pitched brilliantly
at the start, matching Flanagan
inning for inning. He retired
the first 10 Orioles and did not
allow a hit until the fifth.
But Baltimore got on the
scoreboard in that inning when
Gary Roenicke opened with a
double and Doug DeCinces
followed with single, sending
Roenicke to third. The Pirates
played their infield back, con
ceding the run to get the dou
ble play.
Rich Dauer obliged with the
grounder Pittsburgh needed
forthe double play as Roenicke
scored the game's first run. It
also turned out to be Balti
more's last one.
The Pirates have named )ohn
Candelaria, 14-9 during the
season, to start the sixth game
while the Orioles will counter
with Jim Palmer, who was 10-6.
Palmer started Game Two of
this Series while Candelaria
opened Game Three and was
the loser.
