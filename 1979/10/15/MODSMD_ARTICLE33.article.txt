Pittsburgh (AP) — Back to Bal
timore. That was the battle cry
of the Pittsburgh Pirates yes
terday after they stayed alive in
Game Five of the World Series.
"We're going to go to Balti
more and do some kind of
job," said Jim Rooker, an ailing
four-game winner in the regu
lar season, who combined with
Bert Blyleven to pitch
Pittsburgh to a 7-1 victory over
the Baltimore Orioles.
"We bury ourselves. We're
going back to Baltimore to
undig ourselves," said
shortstop Tim Foli, who drove

in three runs with a triple and a
single.
"If we go there and play Pi
rate baseball — like we did
today — this is going to get in
teresting," said third baseman
Bill Madlock who went 4-for-4.
"This was a heck of a victory.
Now we can go back to Balti
more and get some more of
that crab," kidded hungry
team captain Willie Stargell.
In Sunday's must-win game
the Pirates started Rooker, 4-7,
against Baltimore ace Mike
Flanagan, who beat Pittsburgh
in Game One after a 23-9 regu

lar season.
Was that a pressure position
for Rooker, who was on the
disabled list twice in a regular
season with arm trouble? Pres
sure? "Heck, no, I was
cruisin'," said Rooker. "When
you're down three games to
one how can you be uptight?"
Rooker held the Orioles hit
less for four innings. He trailed
1-0 on a three-hitter when he
left after five innings. Blyleven
allowed just three hits the rest
of the way.
"Rooker did his job, I did my
job," said Blyleven.
