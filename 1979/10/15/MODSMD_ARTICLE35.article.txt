Competitiveness seems to be the recurring theme for Stan
ford sports each Saturday. In addition to a football team that
provides breathtaking finishes, the Cardinals boast of a pair of
cross country teams that have been running consistently well
around the state.
Saturday morning the host teams displayed their competi
tive edge at the Stanford Invitational Meet held at the Stanford
golf course. The men's and women's teams strode to third and
fourth place finishes respectively out of a field of 18 teams.
Aided by grey skies and a light breeze the Cards paced their
way to good showings against highly touted collegiate and
club squads.
"It's a competitive field we're running against, "commented
women's head coach Laurel Treon, who pointed to better
pre-season preparation as a reason for faster individual times.
Dean Clark, mentor of the men's team felt that his squad
could have faired a little better. "As a team I thought they'd be a
little closer, but overall we ran a fair race," he said.
In the collegiate division theCal Poly-San Luis Obispo men's
squad captured first place while California's "A" team took top
honors in the women's section.'
Cal Poly-SLO provided the individual winners as Jim Schan
kel was the first man to cross the finish line with a time of
30:46.5 on the 10,000-meter course.
Female counterpart Maggie Keyes erased her own course
and meet record with 17:18.5 for 5000 meters as opposed to
17:34.8 set in 1978. The first five finishers ran under that mark
this year.
For the men senior All-American Roy Kissin led the Card
pack running 31:45.7 for eighth place out of 110 harriers.
Cited by Coach Clark for their "tremendous efforts,"
sophomore Rod Berry and senior Craig Corey were the next
Stanford runners in placing 12th at 31:54.2 and 24th with
32:22.9 respectively.
Bill Haldeman at 27th and Bill Graham at 34th completed the
scoring for the "A" squad, although 11 Cards competed in the
race.
The trio of Kim Schnurpfeil, Ann Thrupp and Ann Wothers
poon led the women's team again this week as they have
throughout the season.
Freshman Schnurpfeil was fourth overall out of 168
finishers and third on the collegiate level with a time of 17:34.0
on the home course.
Senior veteran Thrupp ran 18:16.3, good for 12th place col
legiately, while junior transfer Wotherspoon's mark of 18:55.1
placed her 20th out of the large field.
Rounding out the Card's "A" team were Susan Bragdon at
27th, )aneal Cabbage at 35th, Beth Flarrison at 44th, and Joanne
Ernst at 62nd. The "B" squad garnered 13th place in the col
legiate division led by Annette Mungai with a 43rd place show
ing.
