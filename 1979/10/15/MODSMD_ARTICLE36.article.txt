The new wooden posts re
placing the white metal poles
at the edges of the inner cam
pus are designed to help al
leviate the traffic problems in
the central campus which Stan
ford Planning Director Phil Wil
liams has described as a "vir
tual free-for-all of trucks, cars,
mopeds and motorcycles."
Destruction of the old bol
lards and access through con
struction sites has allowed a
large number of unauthorized
vehicles including private cars
and taxi cabs to enter the inner
campus area, he said.
Unlike their metal predeces
sors, the new bollards are
cemented firmly into the
ground. Locks were used to
keep the old poles in place.
Since the posts are immovable,
emergency vehicles, primarily
fire trucks because of their
immense size, will simply push
over posts if they must enter
the inner campus to answer an
emergency call, according to
Facilities Engineer John Lerry.
Palo Alto Fire Department
Battalion Chief James
McLaughlin expressed no con

cern about possible damage to
his engines. While the fire de
partment has not yet tested an
engine's ability to push
through the wood posts, he
said that Stanford planning of
ficials have tested them and
that he is comfortable with
their results.
The new bollards, which are
cheaper to install than the
metal poles, should be more
aesthetically pleasing, said
Lerry.
Williams hopes that the new,
nicer looking posts will escape
some of the abuse inflicted
upon their metal counterparts.
In the past, vandals have
knocked over the posts, cut
connecting chains with bolt
cutters and torches and even
rammed them with a forklift,
he said.
The new bollards are being
spaced so that the small
Cushman carts used by the
University mail service and
parking controllers and the
golf carts rented to injured or
handicapped students can pass
through unhindered, but the
smallest of compact cars can
not.

Ragtime music composed by the likes of Scott Joplin, Jelly Roll Morton, Eubie Blake and others was
performed Friday night at Memorial Auditorium by the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble.
Sponsored by the Lively Arts at Stanford, the group has previously been supported by the State
