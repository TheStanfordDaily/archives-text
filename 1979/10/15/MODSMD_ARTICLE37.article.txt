Heavy traffic in the Busi
ness School Library has
prompted librarians to
begin charging non-
University users of the lib
rary.
"Four to five hundred
people come into the library
each week, both students
and non-students, and we'd
have more people coming
in if we didn't charge
them," said Martha
Ashmon, senior librarian.
According to library staf
fers, all University students,
faculty and alumni are enti
tled to use the library
facilities free of charge.
Other persons are charged
$10 a day, or if they need
extensive access to library
materials, $40 a month.
Bay Area businesses are
the chief users of the daily

and monthly rate, Ashmon
said.
The policy of charging
non-University users, un
ique here to the Business
School Library, is designed
to "free the circulation at
tendents to help students,"
Ashmon said. The turnstyle
gate to the library is kept
locked and can be opened
with the use of a plastic
card.
The library card, which
costs $2, is not mandatory
and students without cards
are allowed into the library
by circulation attendents.
The library makes no pro
fit from card sales. Accord
ing to Ashmon, it costs $2.25
to produce each card. The
senior librarian recom
mended that students who
make frequent use of the
Business School Library
purchase a card.
