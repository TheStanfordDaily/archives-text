# Committee studies bicycle safety

### Gina Zadra 
Bicycles, those two-wheeled vehicles,
are as much a part of the University as
Hoover Tower.
While they are a fast and enjoyable way
to get around campus, bicycles are also
the subject of much cursing, concern and
planning.
Due to the growing concern over bicy
cle safety, a special Bicycle Safety Commit
tee was formed last year. The committee
had existed in prior years as a subcommit
tee to the Administrative Panel for Safety
and Health.
The committee meets once a month
and, according to Committee Secretary
Hal Wilson, it is extremely involved and
concerned with the safety of bicyclists at
the University.
One of the ongoing functions of the
committee is to maintain a computer list
ing of the number of bicycle accidents
which occur on campus. However, the
committee's figures are obtained from ac
cident reports filled out by students.
Wilson estimated that only 10-20 per
cent of all bike accidents result in a re
ported injury. The committee plans to
solve this problem by printing hundreds of

hazard report forms and making them av
ailable to students.
"In this way," said Wilson, "students
could make the committee aware of po
tential hazards or danger zones around
campus such as pot-holes in the bike
paths, unmarked obstacles, etc."
Along the lines of preventing bike acci
dents, the committee has also requested
that the University make available to them
plans for any future construction on cam
pus.
"In this way the committee could spot
potential hazards to cyclists and see that
they are corrected before the actual con
struction gets under way," said Wilson.
One of the committee's main goals, ac
cording to Wilson, is to encourage safe
bicycling. On October 18they will sponsor
a Bike Fair in front of Tresidder from 11:30
— 1:30.
"This will provide an opportunity for
students to get their bikes inspected for
mechanical difficulties, explore the variety
of bike equipment available on and near
campus as well as pick up lots of informa
tion regarding biking," said Wilson.
For the serious cyclist there will also be

information regarding CalTrans, a state
program which sponsors bicycle touring
trips and a commuter bicycle shuttle.
There will also be an opportunity for stu
dents to register their bicycles at the Fair.
The main focus of the bike committeeis
"Can You Be Seen?"
With Daylight Savings time quickly ap
proaching, many students who do not cur
rently need a light will find themselves in
the dark," said Wilson. "The law requires
that cyclists have a light if they ride at
night."
The bike committee is conducting a
study of lighting on campus, but Wilson
said that this is only an added step. Cyclists
who need a light or want advice on what is
available should come to the Bike Fair.
"The Committee has found that being
unseen is one of the most common and
dangerous mistakes made by cyclists,"
said Wilson.
Other problems the committee hopes
to solve this year includes mo-peds,
whether or not the University policy
should be to separate bikes and traffic and
an accurate count of just how many bikes
there are on campus.
