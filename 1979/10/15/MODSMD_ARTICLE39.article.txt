# Police curb crimes with fake 'stings'

### 
Rochester, N.Y. (AP) — For
three months, Rochester
police officers asked local
criminals what they knew
about a fencing operation
working out of an old
downtown grocery store.
Word spread.
So when thieves began driv
ing stolen cars into the garage
behind the store this spring,
they never suspected the
"fence" who was buying the
cars was really an undercover
police agent.
Agents made deals for 64 sto
len cars, paid $250,000 for
other stolen property and in
three months collected
enough evidence to arrest 36
persons on 111 counts of pos
session of stolen property.
With greater frequency,
police across the country are
using "stings," phony fencing
operations, to con thieves out
of millions of dollars in stolen
goods.
The operations were all part
of a new federal attack on
property crime, one that has
seen $190 million worth of
goods recovered with an ex
penditure of six million dollars.
Responsible for the increase
in anti-fencing operations is
the federal Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration,
which has funded 79 "sting"
operations since 1974 and is

now financing another 55.
The operations aim to dis
rupt the system by which sto
len property is distributed.
Taking away that market, LEAA
officials say, is a new approach
to cutting property crime,
which accounts for about 90
percent of all crimes reported
in the country.
"We're actively going after
criminals instead of waiting for
them to come to us," said
Rochester Police Chief Thomas
Hastings.
"Receiving stolen property is
probably the biggest
moneymaker for criminals in
the country,"said Rod Carr, a
Syracuse, N.V., police
spokesman.
"It's bigger than drugs, big
ger than anything. And now
that we have the funds from
LEAA, we're finally doing
something about it,"he said.
Since 1974, sting operations
have led to more than 6400 ar
rests across the country.
According to the LEAA, 8691
indictments have been handed
down, and because the evi
dence is so convincing, pro
secutors have posted a convic
tion rate of better than 90 per
cent, more than 17 percent
above the national average for
criminal convictions.
Because the phony opera
tions are so believable, crimi

nals who like to brag about
their exploits have unwittingly
confessed to more than just
property crimes.
The stings have led to con
victions for murder, arson, as
sault and drug dealing said
James Golden, director of
LEAA's Criminal Conspiracies
Division.
Golden said that even after a
sting has shut down, the mem
ory still deters crime. Four to 15
months after the finish of suc
cessful stings, he said, cities
reported a five percent drop in
larceny, 15 percent in robbery
and burglary and 26 percent in
car thefts.
Golden said the operation
makes criminals wary of ap
proaching a real fence for fear
they may be walking into a
trap.
"The operations have a
psychological affect among the
criminal community," he said.
"It keeps them nervous and off
balance."
The operations can be
dangerous.
Golden said a sting in Fl
Paso, Texas, was shut down last
year after seven armed men
tried to hold up the under
cover agents, starting a shoot
out that killed three persons,
including two agents.
Many police departments
protect their men by hiding of

ficers armed with shotguns
behind one-way mirrors. Also
concealed behind the mirrors
is equipment essential to later
convictions — movie cameras
and tape recorders.
"It's the old story of a picture
being worth a thousand
words," Golden said.
"In the past, police had to
testify as to what a suspect said
and what transpired, and it was
easier for the suspect to ar
gue," he said.
"Butwhat'son the videotape
is damned near irrefutable. It
psychologically zaps the de
fendants."
