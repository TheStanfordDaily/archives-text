# Supplies airlifted to strife-torn Cambodia

Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — Cargo
planes ferried tons of food and other
relief supplies Sunday to Phnom
Penh for Cambodia's starving
people, but organizers of the
emergency international airlift said
they feared a famine might not be
averted.
On the Thai-Cambodian border,
meanwhile, a mortar attack from the
Cambodian side killed five Cambo
dian refugees and injured 12 others
in a camp on Thai territory. Thai sol
diers said Vietnamese troops or sol
diers of the Hanoi-backed Cambo
dian government were believed re
sponsible.
The two mortar rounds fell in the
Thap Prik camp, 125 miles east of
Bangkok. Afterward Thailand moved
reinforcements into the border area,
where 34,000 sick and starving Cam
bodians have fled in the past five
days.
The Cambodian government gave
the go-ahead for the relief program
Saturday, and it got under way even
though formal agreement has been
held up over the government's insis
tence that no food should be given to
the followers of deposed Premier Pol
Pot.
Vietnamese and Cambodian gov
ernment forces continue to battle Pol
Pot's guerrillas in the Cambodian
countryside.
Thirty nations have pledged more
than $110 million to the relief effort,
coordinated by the Red Cross and
the U.N. Children's Emergency
Fund. Two planes carried 55 tons of
food into Phnom Penh on Sunday,
but officials of the international
agencies estimated 900 tons a day
would be needed.
The planes also carried four Red
Cross and UNICEF officials.

In a new estimate, UNICEF
spokesman Jacques Danois said
165,000 tons of food would be
needed over the next six months to
avert a famine. A number of relief
operations that could help reach that
goal are still in planning stages, but
more than 10,000 tons of food are
scheduled to be sent in by sea by the
end of the month.
The funds committed to the airlift
include an initial pledge of $7 million
and eventually as much as $30 million
from the United States.
Australia, the first nation to send in
aid, bypassed formal relief programs
as early as June and made its own
deliveries to the refugees on the
Thai-Cambodian border. Britain has
pledged at least $2.2 million. The
European Common Market has
made an initial pledge of $5.6 million.
The changing estimates of how
much relief is needed — a figure that
has risen from 700 tons a day — re
flect the difficulties aid groups are
facing with a reluctant government in
a country that has been decimated by
war, famine and the disruptive
policies of Pol Pot, who was topped
in January by the Vietnamese-led
forces.
But the major aid groups are stick
ing with their policy of "even
handed relief" to people under the
control of both sides, despite strong
objections by the new Phnom Penh
government.
The government has refused for
mal agreement with UNICEF and the
Red Cross as long as this policy is in
force, but the agencies still funnel
supplies across the Thai border to
areas controlled by the Pol Pot forces
and decided to go ahead with the
airlift to Phnom Penh.
