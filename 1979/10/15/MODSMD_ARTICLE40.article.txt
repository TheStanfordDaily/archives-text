Israelis allocate land to Jews
Jerusalem — The Israeli Cabinet, trying to
defuse an explosive domestic dispute, de
cided yesterday to allocate more state land for
lewish settlements in the occupied West Bank
of the Jordan River but firmly rejected settlers'
demands to seize private Arab property.
"The principle of the government policy is
not to confiscate or requisition or expropriate
or seize any inch of privately owned land un
less it is absolutely necessary for security
Ceasons," said Cabinet Secretary Aryeh Naor,
announcing the compromise.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet
pored over maps and legal opinions on land
ownership for six hours to find state-owned
land for the expansion of five existing settle
ments and the construction of a new Jewish
city in the predominantly Arab area. The city,
Ert'at, will be populated in part by Jews from
New York.
Naor said the Cabinet found no security jus
tification for the expansion of the settlements,
and would relocate the new city, whose origi
nal siting has been challenged in the courts by
Arab landowners.
In another development, a group of black
American civil rights leaders arrived in Tel Aviv
for meetings with Begin and other Israeli offi
cials to endorse U.S. guarantees for the sec
urity of the Jewish state.
Delegation member Bayard Rustin, presi
dent of New York's A. Phil Randolph Institute,
said the visit was calculated to offset support
for the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) voiced by some American blacks after
Andrew Young resigned as U.N. ambassador
in August. Young quit after an unauthorized
meeting with a representative of the PLO.
A spokesman for the group said on its arrival
here yesterday that its stand toward the PLO
"is identical with that of the people of Israel."
Carter victorious in Florida
Miami — With two large blocks of votes still
to be counted, President Jimmy Carter held a
statewide lead yesterday over Sen. Edward
Kennedy in Florida's Democratic Party cau
cuses and Carter backers claimed victory in the
first balloting of the 1980 presidential cam
paign.
But while Carter, whose campaign was sup
ported by the political power of the White
House, seemed certain to emerge with a

majority of the elected delegates, Kennedy
supporters called the Massachusetts senator's
showing "one of the greatest political upsets
of the century."
Still to be tallied were ballots for 198 dele
gates in populous Dade County, which in
cludes Miami, and for 60 delegates in Palm
Beach County.
At stake was the chance to draw first blood in
the anticipated fight between Carter and Ken
nedy for the 1980 Democratic presidential
nomination.
Reached in Louisville, Ky., on Saturday
where he was campaigning for John Brown,
the Democratic nominee for governor, Ken
nedy did not hesitate to pick Carter to win in
Florida.
"Clearly, he has all the horses down there,"
said the senator. "He's the odds-on favorite."
Kennedy added he believes the first true test of
the 1980 campaign will be the lowa party cau
cuses in lanuary.
Senate rejects pay increase
Washington — The Senate overwhelmingly
rejected on Friday a fragile compromise that
would have given members of Congress a pay
raise while restoring full salaries for 1.5 million
government workers.
The vote was 62-26 to reject the conference
report worked out earlier Friday.
At the last minute, Sen. Ted Stevens (R-
Alaska) made a parliamentary maneuver which
placed him into position to make a motion for
reconsideration of the action.
And then, noting that seven Cabinet-level
departments have been without funds for 12
days and cannot continue to operate much
longer, Stevens moved for reconsideration,
and debate was reopened.
Selected House and Senate members im
mediately huddled in an effort to find a way out
of the newest impasse.
Rejection of the compromise came after
Sen. Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.), told his col
leagues they should stand firm on their earlier
position of rejecting any pay raise for members
of Congress.
Referring to cutbacks in government
paychecks and programs, Weicker said, "Th
ose people and those programs were held hos
tage so the House of Representatives could
vote themselves a pay raise."

Gasoline price lids removed
Washington — The House, after turning back
efforts to reinstate price controls on pet
roleum products, voted 191-188 Friday to re
move existing price lids entirely from gasoline.
The move, if approved by the Senate, would
leave determination of the price charged at the
pump entirely up to oil companies.
Rep. ]ohn Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of
the House energy and power subcommittee,
claimed the move could send gasoline prices
soaring to $2 a gallon — a contention disputed
by advocates of the move.
With the House decision on Thursday to let
stand President Jimmy Carter's decision to
phase out federal price controls on crude oil,
gasoline remained the only fuel under federal
controls.
Rep. James Courter (R-N.J.), sponsor of the
amendment, argued that it made no sense to
decontrol crude oil while leaving price lids on
gasoline.
The House vote "is to completely surrender
to the 20 largest oil companies, those whose
profits over the last year have risen by 60 per
cent," said Rep. Bob Eckhardt (D-Texas), a de
control foe.
Price controls have been on gasoline since
1973. They prohibit price increases to consum
ers beyond those caused by inflation and
higher crude-oil acquisition costs.
50,000 march for gay rights
Washington — An estimated 50,000 persons,
bearing banners from nearly every state in the
union, marched through the nation's capital
yesterday, demanding civil rights protection
for homosexuals.
They marched down Pennsylvania Avenue
and behind the White House, then gathered
on the Mall below the Washington Monument
to hear dozens of speakers denounce what
one called the "homophobia" and
"heterosexism" of mainstream Americans.
U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd at
50,000, but march organizers claimed the
turnout was at least twice as large.
Most marchers were young, white and male,
but the throng included women and men of all
ages, including a few mothers pushing or car
rying their babies.
Nearby, a coalition of conservative ministers
branded the homosexuals as sinners and
urged them to repent.

Demonstrators harrass Nazis
Walnut Creek — Police report they will use
videotape to determine whether charges will
be filed against demonstrators who tossed de
bris at police and Nazis at a park rally in this San
Francisco suburb Saturday.
No arrests were made during the 15-minute
rally by eight Nazis which was disrupted by
about 800 demonstrators.
The Nazis, who had obtained a permit to
hold an "educational speech rally," arrived by
pickup truck and called the protesters "ani
mals." But the Nazi speeches over bullhorns
were drowned out by taunts and chants of
"Death to the Nazis."
Police used mace to hold back about two
dozen people in the crowd who tried to break
through a fence separating them from the
Nazis. About 50 of the demonstrators also tos
sed rocks and dirt clods at police and Nazis.
About 175 law enforcement officers with riot
gear, dogs and a helicopter kept things under
control.
USSR nukes under scrutiny
Moscow — After years of little but praise for
nuclear power in the Soviet Union, two top
energy specialists have voiced serious doubts
over the scope, safety and environmental con
sequences of this country's ambitious atomic
power program.
Unless the program is radically altered, they
say, more densely populated areas of Euro
pean Russia may soon reach the limits of their
"ecological capacity" to cope with new nuc
lear power stations.
Nikolai Dollezhal and Yuri Koryakin
sounded the warning in an authoritative article
published in last week'sedition of Kommunist,
the Soviet Communist Party's leading theoret
ical journal.
Western scientific sources in Moscow said
they were astonished at the critical frankness
of the Kommunist article, which contrasted
sharply with the upbeat tone typical of most
nuclear power coverage in the government
controlled news media.
Today's weather

chance of showers this morning. Lows in the
