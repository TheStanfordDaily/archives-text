# Compare recipes, sample new dishes
## Student panels test food service delights 
### Helen Casabona 
Any student who is feeling the ef
fects of the "food service blues" now
has the opportunity to fight back and
help upgrade the quality of the daily
menus in University-operated resi
dences.
Every five weeks the food service
holds tasting sessions where stu
dents test several dishes and rate
them on a scale ranging from excel
lent to very poor. These taste panels
convene in the Food Service Office
on Pampas Lane for students to voice
their opinions of the food served on
campus and make suggestions on
improving the dishes that are sal
vageable.
Participants compare variations of
the same recipe and also sample new
brands of food or new recipes that

are not currently in use.
The first taste panel this year was
held last week, but only eight of the
35 people who had signed lists to at
tend were present.
One student said she went to the
session mostly out of curiosity, but
others claimed a more serious desire
to contribute to the improvement of
the present food situation.
Student input needed
Students attested to cases when
food changes have been ac
complished by complaining directly
to the cafeterias in their residences.
For example, Serra Flouse recently
conducted a successful petition to
have Fruit Loops served for break
fast.
According to Test Kitchen Dieti
cian Lois Ohms, to have any influ

ence on an individual basis, students
should attend the taste panels. There
must be greaterstudent participation
if the panels are to be effective, she
said. All suggestions and comments
are taken into consideration, and she
reads all of the rating sheets herself,
she added.
Most of the students who had
served on previous taste panels said
they enjoyed tasting and rating the
food. Some, however, admitted that
the sessions left their stomachs feel
ing "mildly blah."
Common misconceptions
The same foods and recipes are
used by all the residence dining halls
run by the food service, but many
students still argue that some ser
vices are consistently better or worse
than others. Stern Hall has an undy

ing reputation for greasy dishes
while Lagunita and Branner are rated
slightly higher by the general con
sensus.
These discrepancies, said Ohms,
are unfair and have no justification
other than traditional opinions main
tained from year to year that remain
constant regardless of the quality of
the food.
All the food is purchased directly
from packers in large quantities, in
cluding such familiar items as
Campbell's soup.
Meat supplies choice
The University commissary buys
only choice cuts of meat, said Assis
tant Commissary Manager Dennis de
La Fontaine. "Buying premium
would be unrealistic, but we buy no-
