## Cuban addresses U.N. Castro seeks new world order 
### 
| United Nations (AP) — Fidel
;Castro, in an impassioned
bristling with anti-U.S.
Ibarbs, called on the nations of
;the world Friday to end the
"exploitation of the poor," and
build a new international order
or face an apocalypse.
"I speak in behalf of the chil
dren of the world who don't
even have a piece of bread!"
the Cuban president thun
dered. A wave of applause
Jrom the packed U.N. General
Assembly hall answered him.
* Castro's two-hour address,
•highlight of his first visit to
soil in two decades,
fended with a standing ovation
most of the Assembly's
152 members.
t Referring to the United
States, he declared in the first
few minutes of his speech that
he was not here to "wound
yvith unnecessary adjectives
our powerful neighbor to the
north in his own house," or to
speak of "the attacks on our
small but noble country for the
past 25 years."
But during the speech's first
hour he lashed out at his pow
erful northern neighbor more
than a half-dozen times — for.
its policies in the Mideast,
southern Africa and Latin
America, particularly Puerto
Rico.
Non-aligned 'solidarity'
To a 15-second ovation from
the Assembly, he noted that
the non-aligned movement in
its Havana summit meeting last
month had proclaimed its "sol
idarity" with the indepen

dence movement in that U.S.
commonwealth island, "de
spite the obstinancy of the Un
ited States government de
manding that the issue of
Puerto Rico be considered an
internal problem."
Castro also denounced
"hostile acts, pressure and
threats" against his country by
the United States, and noted
that the non-aligned confer
ence had condemned the "un
just" U.S. economic blockade
"by which the United States
seeks to isolate the Cuban re
volution, and to destroy it."
Castro said, he was speaking
on behalf of a Third World that
is "struggling for an eradica
tion of poverty, of hunger, of
disease, of illiteracy, from
which hundreds of millions of
human beings suffer."
'New world order'
He demanded establishment
of a "new world order based
on justice, on equity, on
peace" to replace "the unjust
world system that exists tp
day."
Under the current system, he
said, "wealth is still concen
trated in the hands of a few
powers" who profit from
"exploitation" of the Third
World.
Shouts of "Fidel! Fidel!"
rose in the packed hall, domi
nated by Third World dele
gates sympathetic to the Cu
ban's cause. The bearded Cas
tro, clad in his customary green
fatigues, left through a gather
ing of well-wishers in a nearby
lounge with 90 dignitaries, in

eluding American U.N. Am
bassador Donald McHenry.
Protests
As Castro spoke inside the
General Assembly building on
Manhattan's East Side, 2000
anti-Castro protesters de
monstrated on nearby Dag
Hammarskjold Plaza. A smaller
group of pro-Castroites de
monstrated five blocks away,
on the other side of the U.N.
entrance.
Local police and U.S., Cuban
and U.N. security agents, fear
ful of a possible assassination
attempt against Castro, had
thrown a tight security net over
the U.N. area.
As Castro spoke, a contingent
of U.S. Marines headed for a
mock reinforcement landing in
the U.S. naval base at Guan
tanamo Bay, Cuba, intended to
dramatize President Jimmy
Carter's declaration of in
creased vigilance in the Carib
bean.
Castro did not mention the
Soviet troops whose presence
on his island led to Carter's ac
tions.

| United Nations (AP) — Fidel
;Castro, in an impassioned
bristling with anti-U.S.
Ibarbs, called on the nations of
;the world Friday to end the
"exploitation of the poor," and
build a new international order
or face an apocalypse.
"I speak in behalf of the chil
dren of the world who don't
even have a piece of bread!"
the Cuban president thun
dered. A wave of applause
Jrom the packed U.N. General
Assembly hall answered him.
* Castro's two-hour address,
•highlight of his first visit to
soil in two decades,
fended with a standing ovation
most of the Assembly's
152 members.
t Referring to the United
States, he declared in the first
few minutes of his speech that
he was not here to "wound
yvith unnecessary adjectives
our powerful neighbor to the
north in his own house," or to
speak of "the attacks on our
small but noble country for the
past 25 years."
But during the speech's first
hour he lashed out at his pow
erful northern neighbor more
than a half-dozen times — for.
its policies in the Mideast,
southern Africa and Latin
America, particularly Puerto
Rico.
Non-aligned 'solidarity'
To a 15-second ovation from
the Assembly, he noted that
the non-aligned movement in
its Havana summit meeting last
month had proclaimed its "sol
idarity" with the indepen

dence movement in that U.S.
commonwealth island, "de
spite the obstinancy of the Un
ited States government de
manding that the issue of
Puerto Rico be considered an
internal problem."
Castro also denounced
"hostile acts, pressure and
threats" against his country by
the United States, and noted
that the non-aligned confer
ence had condemned the "un
just" U.S. economic blockade
"by which the United States
seeks to isolate the Cuban re
volution, and to destroy it."
Castro said, he was speaking
on behalf of a Third World that
is "struggling for an eradica
tion of poverty, of hunger, of
disease, of illiteracy, from
which hundreds of millions of
human beings suffer."
'New world order'
He demanded establishment
of a "new world order based
on justice, on equity, on
peace" to replace "the unjust
world system that exists tp
day."
Under the current system, he
said, "wealth is still concen
trated in the hands of a few
powers" who profit from
"exploitation" of the Third
World.
Shouts of "Fidel! Fidel!"
rose in the packed hall, domi
nated by Third World dele
gates sympathetic to the Cu
ban's cause. The bearded Cas
tro, clad in his customary green
fatigues, left through a gather
ing of well-wishers in a nearby
lounge with 90 dignitaries, in

eluding American U.N. Am
bassador Donald McHenry.
Protests
As Castro spoke inside the
General Assembly building on
Manhattan's East Side, 2000
anti-Castro protesters de
monstrated on nearby Dag
Hammarskjold Plaza. A smaller
group of pro-Castroites de
monstrated five blocks away,
on the other side of the U.N.
entrance.
Local police and U.S., Cuban
and U.N. security agents, fear
ful of a possible assassination
attempt against Castro, had
thrown a tight security net over
the U.N. area.
As Castro spoke, a contingent
of U.S. Marines headed for a
mock reinforcement landing in
the U.S. naval base at Guan
tanamo Bay, Cuba, intended to
dramatize President Jimmy
Carter's declaration of in
creased vigilance in the Carib
bean.
Castro did not mention the
Soviet troops whose presence
on his island led to Carter's ac
tions.
