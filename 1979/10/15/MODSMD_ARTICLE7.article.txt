# Refugees here could lose welfare funding
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” About
20,000 Indochinese refugees in
California could lose their fed
eral welfare aid next month, a
Brown administration official
said Thursday.
That likely cutoff, disclosed
by state Social Services Direc
tor Marion Woods, and other
funding shortages for Califor
nia's 104,000 refugees don't
appear to concern the Carter
administration or Congress,
said the chairman of the As
sembly Health Committee.
"Politics is being played
here. California is being given
the short end of the stick," said
Assemblyman Art Torres
(D-Los Angeles), who ap
peared at a news conference
with Woods.
"Congress and the administ
ration are not really providing
the push" for renewal of fed
eral aid to the states for re
fugees, said Torres, who had
just returned from a trip to
Washington, D.C., to discuss
the refugee issue.
He said President )immy Car

ter's budget office is pressing
for overall budget cuts to fulfill
a 1976 campaign pledge, and
members of Congress, worried
about re-election, "don't want
to push for more money, espe
cially when their states are not
involved. .. . They feel
California is rich enough."
California is home to nearly
half the nation's 227,000 In
dochinese refugees, and prob
ably will get a large share of the
168,000 scheduled to be flown
to the United States in the next
12 months, Woods said.
Of the 104,000 refugees now
in the state, 42,000 are on wel
fare or MediCal, and 20,000 of
those are in a special federal
aid program that will run out of
money Oct. 31, Woods said.
He said legislation now be
fore Congress, to continue
federal refugee aid, does not
include money for the 20,000,
who have been in this country
for more than two years and
earn too much money to qual
ify for county welfare prog
rams.
