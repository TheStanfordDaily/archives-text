### 
The Hague, Netherlands (AP)
— A gunman killed the only
son of the Turkish ambassador
to the Netherlands on Friday in
an apparent vengeance slaying
claimed by Armenians.
Ahmet Benler, the 27-year
old son of ambassador Oz
demir Benler, was shot as he
stopped his automobile at a
traffic light two blocks from the
Turkish embassy.
An Armenian terrorist group
identifying itself as the Justice
Commandos of the Armenian
Genocide claimed responsibil
ity for the killing in a call to The
Associated Press in Beirut and
said it was part of a struggle for
"due justice" against the Turks
they accuse of genocide 50
years ago.
Benler was the 11th member
of Turkey's foreign diplomatic
community to be slain by sus
pected Armenian terrorists in
the past six years, including a
1973 attack in Los Angeles
which killed two Turkish con
sulate officials.
A student at a technical uni
versity in Delft, southeast of
The Hague, Benler was shot at
an intersection in the city
centeron his wayto school. He
was" declared dead at the
scene.
Gunman waiting
Witnesses said the gunman,
who had a dark complexion
and appeared to be waiting for
Benler on the road leading to
the Delft highway, pumped
four to six shots through the
side windows, hitting Benler

directly in the chest.
They said Benle r 's foot appa
rently hit the gas pedal, caus
ing the car to go through the
intersection and hit several
cars on the other side of the
street. No injuries were re
ported and police said the
gunman escaped on foot.
Police were searching for a
man with curly brown hair, of
medium build, wearing a blue
jacket.
In Beirut, an anonymous
woman caller told AP she rep
resented the Justice Comman
dos group and that it claimed
responsibility for the killing.
The French newtagency in The
Hague received a similar call
from an anonymous person
who said he represented the
same group.
'Due justice'
The woman said her group
would continue to struggle "as
long as due justice has not
been done to the Armenian na
tion." She said the group was
responsible for acts against
Turkish ambassadors in Vie
nna, Paris, the Vatican and
Madrid.
The group was not familiar to
observers in Beirut. A group
calling itself the Armenian Sec
ret Army has claimed bomb
ings and other violent acts in
and out of Turkey.
Armenia, the ancient king
dom of Asia Minor, was ruled
by the Turkish Ottoman Em
pire for centuries. Historians
say a systematic plan for their

extermination was put into ef
fect by Turkey's rulers in 1894.
It continued sporadically until
1915 when mass executions of
Armenians began after Turkish
leaders accused them of aiding
the Russians who invaded the
Turkish territory.
Armenia's independence
ended in 1921 with the Russo-
Turkish Treaty that divided its
remaining territory between
Turkey and Russia.
