# Bookstore gets tax exemption
## 
### Hillary Earnest 
After buying this quarter's books,
students may find it hard to believe
that prices were not as high as might
have been expected.
Legislation sponsored by State As
semblyman Vic Calvo (D-Mt. View)
and recently signed into law by Gov
ernor Jerry Brown, will provide the
Bookstore with a property tax
exemption, resulting in an estimated
savings of $35,000. Some of the cost
reduction will be manifested in rela
tively lower prices than would
otherwise occur at the current rate of
inflation.
The passage of Calvo's bill allows
the non-profit campus bookstore the
same property tax exemption en
joyed by other California college
bookstores.
The Bookstore previously paid the
tax, while other state university
bookstores did not, because of its
status as an independent entity,
rather than as property of the state.
According to lack Friedenthal, law
professor and member of the
Bookstore's board of directors, the
bill, which was signed Sept. 12,
would have saved the Bookstore
over $70,000 before the passage of
Prop. 13.
Because the Bookstore is a non
profit organization, the savings will
return to general funds to be used for
employee benefits, improvements
and additions.
According to Bookstore assistant
manager Phil Chariamonte, the tax
exemption has been a factor in a
$700,000 increase in inventory allow
ing a greater selection of hard-cover
non-textbooks.
Calvo said the State Board of
Equalization had urged the
Bookstore to seek legislative ap
proval of the tax exemption on prop
erty owned or used by the non-profit
corporation.
All of the UC bookstores currently
receive the exemption, and Stanford
was believed to be the only non-UC,
non-profit, college-affiliated
bookstore not eligible for the
exemption.
"In the interest of equity, the Stan
ford Bookstore should receive the
same tax treatment as the other cam
pus stores," Calvo said. "Since a re
cent addition to the Bookstore would
have resulted in an even larger prop
erty tax bill, I am pleased this legisla
tion has been enacted.
Santa Clara County granted the
Bookstore a tax exemption which,
combined with the recent inventory
tax cut, would have cut taxes consid
erably. Calvo's bill furthermore as
sures that the Bookstore will not be
taxed for its lease.
