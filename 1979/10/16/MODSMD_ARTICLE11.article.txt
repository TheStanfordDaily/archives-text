# Palestinian homeland urged

"The creation of a Palestinian state is es
sential to Mideast peace," Scott Kennedy, a
member of an American delegation that vis
ited the Middle East last winter, said during a
noon speech at the Bechtel International
Center last week,
Kennedy, a staff member of the Resource
Center for Non-Violence in Santa Cruz, out
lined his plans for peace in the Mideast be
fore a crowd of 60 people. "Israel must re
move its settlements and withdraw from all
territory in 1967, including East Jerusalem, in
return for peace with security guarantees for
Israel and Palestine," he said.
During his January visit to Arab countries,
Kennedy met with a Palestine Liberation Or
ganization (PLO) spokesman. He sum
marized this meeting, saying he believes that
the PLO is ready to accept and maintain a
two-state settlement with Israel.
"The PLO now recognizes that an inde
pendent state cannot be achieved by vio
lence or war," he added.
"In calling for an independent Palestinian
state on the West Bank a n d Gaza Strip," Ken
nedy continued, "the PLO implies recogni
tion of Israel and willingness to co-exist with
Israel."
Kennedy said he believes Arab rejection of

the U.S.-sponsored Israeli-Egyptian peace
treaty stems from the treaty's "failure to rec
ognize the rights of the Palestinians."
"America must establish negotiations and
contacts with the PLO, cut any financial aid to
Israel used in the building of new settlements
and reduce military aid (to Israel)" in order to
halt Israeli military action in Lebanon, Ken
nedy said.
He compared the Palestinians' predica
ment with that of the Jews before Israel be
came a state. He said Palestinians are dis
criminated against in Israel and throughout
the Middle East and need a homeland to pro
tect their interests and freedom.
Kennedy emphasized he is a pacifist con
cerned with the mutual recognition and
well-being of Palestinians and Israelis.
"For Israel, peace means an unambiguous
affirmation of the Palestinians' right to na
tional self-determination.
"For the Palestinians, this means a declara
tion of an end to armed struggle against Is
raeli civilians and an unambiguous affirma
tion of Israel's right to exist.
"And for America, peace means renuncia
tion of a lifestyle and national political post
ure which requires the military or economic
domination of a region half way around the
world," he said.
