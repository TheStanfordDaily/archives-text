# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Kim Bancroft Remove sexism from our language 
### 
As another academic year
gets to a start, now is the time
we begin training and retrain
ing our minds in every
academic tradition, which
often carries important socio
economic consequences.
Most of these traditions are
based on the use of sexist lan
guage, meaning words,
phrases or sentences that serve
to degrade women's status.
An example of the use of a
sexist sentence would be,
"She's a good scientist, for a
woman." This implies that
women are normally not good
scientists, a false generaliza
tion.
This assumption betrays the
speaker's ignorance of the
context in which women have,
in recent decades, entered into
employment, professions and
disciplines previously reserved

only for men. The biased at
titudes in male bastions should
be eradicated-
An important sexist use of
language that we all must con
front is the use of "mankind,"
"men" and "man" and their
concomitents "he," "his"
and "him." Supposedly these
words serve generically, such
that all people — men and
women — are included in their
use. This is another falsehood.
Accuracy in language?
First, the use of "men" gen
erically is ambiguous. My
textbook states, "Through the
centuries, men have grappled
with the problems posed by
their changing environment."
One sensitive to accuracy in
language must question
whether the author means
women have not grappled with
similar problems.

If the author is assuming this
(in Law, Politics, and Birth Con
trol), then I must be skeptical
of his judgment throughout
the book. If the author does
not mean this, then why not
use "people?"
Besides the issue of accu
racy, language carries impor
tant psychological implica
tions. It not only reflects what
we think but shapes how we
think as well.
To read about "the great
men of history," or "the great
scientists who were men of
foresight" implants an uncon
scious vision in our minds,
which is why we still do double
takes to see female scientists or
to read about great women in
history (most texts and courses
neglect to mention or substan
tially deal with the great

women in our past).
No longer do we only have
congressmen, mailmen,
milkmen, repairmen, chair
men, etc. Women do these
things now and our language
should acknowledge that.
The new "Women's Guide to
Stanford" mentions that "lan
guage tends to elevate men
and to depreciate women; for
example, many seemingly
parallel terms for male and
female (e.g., spinster/
bachelor) have divergent con
notations, in most cases de
rogatory to women."
Why not woman?
This is true for another
word popularly used on cam
pus, "girl" instead of "wo
man." Though we have, more
often than not, matured into
women, just as the "boys"
have become "men," we are
still stuck with "girls" as the
best parallel to the slang of
"guys," even though some
"girls" may be over thirty.
It is not until we are re
spected as women that we will
leave behind the names and
treatment of adolescence and
childhood that we get now.
Of course it is difficult to
change the way we speak, as
much as to change the way we
think. But in the process, the
one will affect the other. Prac
tically speaking, many writers
and professors, or people in
day-to-day talk claim it is too
difficult to say "he or she,"
"his/her," because "if I say
'he,' you know I mean both."
Neglecting the human ele
ment for a moment of time is
inexcusable laziness, espe
cially in an academic environ
ment that stresses accuracy in
articulation and demanding
mental work. In other cases,
there are alternatives to re
place biased words, i.e., "mail
deliverer," "congress
member," "frosh."
Real effort needed
The ASSU Senate, and then
the Faculty Senate of 1978 ap
proved a resolution "to refrain
from using sexist language
. . ." I should like to see a real
effort made by the community
— especially by sU dents,
newspaper writers, adminis
trators and professors who
most rigorously use language
in formal communication — to
be true to these pledges for
non-sexist language.
The effort to include women
in discussions and analysis is
greatly appreciated by anyone
concerned with the advance
ment of women's status.

day-to-day talk claim it is too
difficult to say "he or she,"
"his/her," because "if I say
'he,' you know I mean both."
Neglecting the human ele
ment for a moment of time is
inexcusable laziness, espe

articulation and demanding

Real effort needed
The ASSU Senate, and then
the Faculty Senate of 1978 ap
proved a resolution "to refrain
from using sexist language
. . ." I should like to see a real
effort made by the community
— especially by sU dents,
newspaper writers, adminis
trators and professors who
most rigorously use language
in formal communication — to
be true to these pledges for
non-sexist language.
The effort to include women
in discussions and analysis is
greatly appreciated by anyone
concerned with the advance
ment of women's status.

As another academic year
gets to a start, now is the time
we begin training and retrain
ing our minds in every
academic tradition, which
often carries important socio
economic consequences.
Most of these traditions are
based on the use of sexist lan
guage, meaning words,
phrases or sentences that serve
to degrade women's status.
An example of the use of a
sexist sentence would be,
"She's a good scientist, for a
woman." This implies that
women are normally not good
scientists, a false generaliza
tion.
This assumption betrays the
speaker's ignorance of the
context in which women have,
in recent decades, entered into
employment, professions and
disciplines previously reserved

only for men. The biased at
titudes in male bastions should
be eradicated-
An important sexist use of
language that we all must con
front is the use of "mankind,"
"men" and "man" and their
concomitents "he," "his"
and "him." Supposedly these
words serve generically, such
that all people — men and
women — are included in their
use. This is another falsehood.
Accuracy in language?
First, the use of "men" gen
erically is ambiguous. My
textbook states, "Through the
centuries, men have grappled
with the problems posed by
their changing environment."
One sensitive to accuracy in
language must question
whether the author means
women have not grappled with
similar problems.

If the author is assuming this
(in Law, Politics, and Birth Con
trol), then I must be skeptical
of his judgment throughout
the book. If the author does
not mean this, then why not
use "people?"
Besides the issue of accu
racy, language carries impor
tant psychological implica
tions. It not only reflects what
we think but shapes how we
think as well.
To read about "the great
men of history," or "the great
scientists who were men of
foresight" implants an uncon
scious vision in our minds,
which is why we still do double
takes to see female scientists or
to read about great women in
history (most texts and courses
neglect to mention or substan
tially deal with the great

women in our past).
No longer do we only have
congressmen, mailmen,
milkmen, repairmen, chair
men, etc. Women do these
things now and our language
should acknowledge that.
The new "Women's Guide to
Stanford" mentions that "lan
guage tends to elevate men
and to depreciate women; for
example, many seemingly
parallel terms for male and
female (e.g., spinster/
bachelor) have divergent con
notations, in most cases de
rogatory to women."
Why not woman?
This is true for another
word popularly used on cam
pus, "girl" instead of "wo
man." Though we have, more
often than not, matured into
women, just as the "boys"
have become "men," we are
still stuck with "girls" as the
best parallel to the slang of
"guys," even though some
"girls" may be over thirty.
It is not until we are re
spected as women that we will
leave behind the names and
treatment of adolescence and
childhood that we get now.
Of course it is difficult to
change the way we speak, as
much as to change the way we
think. But in the process, the
one will affect the other. Prac
tically speaking, many writers
and professors, or people in
day-to-day talk claim it is too
difficult to say "he or she,"
"his/her," because "if I say
'he,' you know I mean both."
