## Creativity not a good test 
### 
Amongst my circle of friends
at college back East last year,
creativity was used as the stan
dard for judging people. None
of us thought too profoundly
about what creativity is, but
that never stopped us from
criticizing people for lack of it.
Anybody who could be
termed pre-professional was
sniffed at, but actors and direc
tors were highly respected.
Singers were treated politely.
Art students were forgiven any
trespass. We assumed they had
their minds on lofty subjects.
If a fellow student had writ
ten a short story and had it pub
lished he was to be congratu
lated, but the writer who had
been roundly rejected by
editors was treated with awe.
Certainly here was a talent too
rare and too refined for popu
lar taste.
'Unoriginal'
-Looking back, I can see how
painfully unoriginal we were in
regarding creativity, even
though we afforded it such a
premium. I myself didn't fit
into the mold my friends set at
all well. There's little bohemian
about me, my talents weren't
well-developed and the reason
I hadn't been published was
that I wasn't any good.
I never even liked the

stereotypic way of judging
people, but something in the
back of my mind — maybe it's
inbred — kept me from openly
declaring how ridiculous it
was.
Whenever I became fed up
by the labeling I closed my
mouth and nodded my head to
the praise and criticism that
were meted out, like a sheep.
'One of the boys'
Over that summer, working
at a blue-collar job, the stan
dards were changed radically.
None of my co-workers cared a
whit for creativity in art, even
though we were employed by a
movie studio. Instead, a man
could be "one-of-the-boys" if
he could down a six-pack of
Coors and boast of numerous,
varied sexual adventures.
I couldn't do either and I was
repulsed as others did. But I
kept the repulsion silent.
When one of my partners
ogled the beautiful women on
the set, I'd just smile a little and
nod my head quietly. That was
enough: I was accepted as one
of the boys.
Stanford stereotype
I haven't been at Stanford
long enough to know what the
dominant stereotype is here. I
expect it's a bit blonder and
more athletic than the eastern

ideal, more intellectual and
preppy than the blue-collar
one and about as inaccurate as
both of them
Both sets of standards, one
used by Ivy League pseudo
intellectuals and the other by
Los Angeles laborers, were
equally false. I copped-out in
both cases, for by nodding my
head silently I did nothing but
perpetuate the stereotypes,
give them a new adherent.
When I recall the situations I
have to think myself a little
weak-willed and stupid.
It wasn't long before I
realized these bogus standards
were the product of insecuri
ty.My friends back East had no
confidence in their originality
or intelligence; my friends
down South are very lonely
men who can't hold their
liquor. But it took me longer to
realize the number of people
who are oppressed by these
stereotypes.
Many serious-minded stu
dents going to prestigious
schools worry excessively
about whether they're suffi
ciently creative when they
ought to acknowledge the fact
that everyone doesn't have to
be brilliant and concentrate
instead on setting their inner
lives in order.
Concurrently, many kids my
age will enter that job in Los
Angeles and scrap whatever
traces of sensitivity they have
to fit into the "tough, male"
role imposed on them.
A few people will fit into the
stereotypes, a very few will es
chew them and most will be
left nodding their heads un
comfortably. Almost all of
them, in a few months, will re
peat those stereotypes as if
they invented them.
I don't know who did invent
the models but I know from
experience all too clear and all
too personal who" maintains
them.

repulsed as others did. But I
kept the repulsion silent.
When one of my partners
ogled the beautiful women on
the set, I'd just smile a little and
nod my head quietly. That was
enough: I was accepted as one
of the boys.
Stanford stereotype
I haven't been at Stanford
long enough to know what the
dominant stereotype is here. I
expect it's a bit blonder and
more athletic than the eastern

ideal, more intellectual and
preppy than the blue-collar
one and about as inaccurate as
both of them
Both sets of standards, one
used by Ivy League pseudo
intellectuals and the other by
Los Angeles laborers, were
equally false. I copped-out in
both cases, for by nodding my
head silently I did nothing but
perpetuate the stereotypes,
give them a new adherent.
When I recall the situations I
have to think myself a little
weak-willed and stupid.
It wasn't long before I
realized these bogus standards
were the product of insecuri
ty.My friends back East had no
confidence in their originality
or intelligence; my friends
down South are very lonely
men who can't hold their
liquor. But it took me longer to
realize the number of people
who are oppressed by these
stereotypes.
Many serious-minded stu
dents going to prestigious
schools worry excessively
about whether they're suffi
ciently creative when they
ought to acknowledge the fact
that everyone doesn't have to
be brilliant and concentrate
instead on setting their inner
lives in order.
Concurrently, many kids my
age will enter that job in Los
Angeles and scrap whatever
traces of sensitivity they have
to fit into the "tough, male"
role imposed on them.
A few people will fit into the
stereotypes, a very few will es
chew them and most will be
left nodding their heads un
comfortably. Almost all of
them, in a few months, will re
peat those stereotypes as if
they invented them.
I don't know who did invent
the models but I know from
experience all too clear and all
too personal who" maintains
them.

Amongst my circle of friends
at college back East last year,
creativity was used as the stan
dard for judging people. None
of us thought too profoundly
about what creativity is, but
that never stopped us from
criticizing people for lack of it.
Anybody who could be
termed pre-professional was
sniffed at, but actors and direc
tors were highly respected.
Singers were treated politely.
Art students were forgiven any
trespass. We assumed they had
their minds on lofty subjects.
If a fellow student had writ
ten a short story and had it pub
lished he was to be congratu
lated, but the writer who had
been roundly rejected by
editors was treated with awe.
Certainly here was a talent too
rare and too refined for popu
lar taste.
'Unoriginal'
-Looking back, I can see how
painfully unoriginal we were in
regarding creativity, even
though we afforded it such a
premium. I myself didn't fit
into the mold my friends set at
all well. There's little bohemian
about me, my talents weren't
well-developed and the reason
I hadn't been published was
that I wasn't any good.
I never even liked the

stereotypic way of judging
people, but something in the
back of my mind — maybe it's
inbred — kept me from openly
declaring how ridiculous it
was.
Whenever I became fed up
by the labeling I closed my
mouth and nodded my head to
the praise and criticism that
were meted out, like a sheep.
'One of the boys'
Over that summer, working
at a blue-collar job, the stan
dards were changed radically.
None of my co-workers cared a
whit for creativity in art, even
though we were employed by a
movie studio. Instead, a man
could be "one-of-the-boys" if
he could down a six-pack of
Coors and boast of numerous,
varied sexual adventures.
I couldn't do either and I was
repulsed as others did. But I
kept the repulsion silent.
When one of my partners
ogled the beautiful women on
the set, I'd just smile a little and
nod my head quietly. That was
enough: I was accepted as one
of the boys.
