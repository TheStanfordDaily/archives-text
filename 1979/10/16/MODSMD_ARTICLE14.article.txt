## Cynicism about senate 
### 
Well friends, it's ASSU Senate election time
again. Snore . . .
Forgive me if I sound a bit cynical. I sincerely
hope this year's senate is different. I really do.
But I've hoped the same for three years, and it
has yet to be.
I confess, things are on the rise.
The two concrete accomplishments of the se
nate during my stay here came last year.
But seriously, lighted tennis courts and an end
to the bottle ban at the stadium are not likely to
go down in the annals of University history as
significant accomplishments.
Besides, the senate did nothing except plead
our case with a sympathetic athletic director
who understands the importance of recreation
and fun.
To be honest, the senate campaign thus far
has not given me much reason to rejoice. Many
of the posters belie the ignorance, naivete or
stupidity (or combination thereof) of the candi
dates.
There are different types of candidates. There
is the type which has no clue as to the power (or
lack thereof) that the senate possesses. To
them, waving a magic wand will make what they
want appear.
Then there is the type which hopes to please
everyone by saying absolutely nothing, except
the requisite "I want to represent you" or "I
want to help make the ASSU more responsive"
line.
But my favorite is the pseudo-intellectual
poster. You know, the one put up by the candi
date who thinks he is second only to President
Richard Lyman in knowledge of the "issues" on
campus today.
This type fills his pieces of paper with useless,
often incorrect or incomplete information on
these "issues."
The big one this year is the housing shortage.
Some of these posters would have you believe
that no one in the administration is even aware
that such a shortage exists. One candidate de
mands a new dormitory be built.
I'm sure Housing Czar Norm Robinson (dean
of residential education) really appreciates the
help. Too bad for the candidate that he didn't
know Robinson and the administration in gen
eral has been acting on his demand for over a
year.
Another would-be politico says he will insist

on student input in the dorm planning proces
Again, the administration is way ahead. Thi
thought of putting students on the plannir
committee last December. And students ai
nearly half of the committee. And (here's the b
one) that committee will be making a progra
proposal for 800 units of new housing to tf
Board of Trustees in December.
So this year's senate will have nothing to sa
They probably won't even have their chairpe
son selected by then.
The time for the senate to have said somi
thing about housing was two or more years age
That was a time when the administration hadn
really thought about it that much.
Instead, two years ago, the senate spent i
time trying to salvage some credibility followin
a rather embarrassing series of campaign i
regularities which appeared to jeopardize th
seats of a majority of its members. And after thi
was cleared up, harp seals and other such gai
bage filled the body's agenda.
In fact, the senate never mentioned housin
until Dean of Students James Lyons brought it ti
their attention last year. That's how responsivi
our senate has been.
And the senate's effectuality rating isn't mucl
better. Witness the attempt at election reforn
last year.
This is not to sa*y that the senate is ill
intentioned or full of evil people. It isn't. It's jus
that politics and a lack of information seem t(
combine with other factors to make the senati
essentially worthless.
There is one happy note as we enter electior
time. The election itself. If history repeats itself
and let us pray that it will not, we won't ever
know for whom we are voting because of tht
ingenious coding methods used on ASSU bal
lots.
But that's okay because it won't really matte
who we vote for. The result will be the same.
In fact, watching the ASSU Senate for thret
years leads me to one conclusion: the students
should pray for the health and safety of the
ASSU Council of Presidents.
Only they seem endowed with the ability tc
get anything done, and only they can do it with
out the plethora of political (profanity deleted)
which plagues our senate perennially.
