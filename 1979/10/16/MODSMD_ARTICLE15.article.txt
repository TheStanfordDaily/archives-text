## Send 'Chief' out to pasture 
### 
Were it not such a sensitive
issue, Michael DiMartino's
opinion on the Chief Lightfoot
controversy (Daily, Oct. 11)
would have been quite amus
ing.
Attributing last year's loss to
UCLA to the absence of the
Chief? Really, now. I suppose
DiMartino would also have us
believe that we recently lost to
Army because some students
here oppose reinstating thf
draft.
In all seriousness, though, I
worry about the insensitivity to
native American concerns dis
played both by DiMartino in
his article and by many spec
tators at the UCLA game.
DiMartino and others argue
that the Indian mascot repre
sents "pride and respectabil
ity, not prejudice and degrada
tion." I will say that the native
Americans I know demonstrate
pride and command my re
spect.
But when I look at the
dashboard of an alumnus'

Cadillac and see a caricature of
an Indian warrior with his head
bopping up and down, I see
only prejudice and degrada
tion, to say nothing of disre
spect.
True, native American cul
ture is rich in noble ideals and
customs that we all would do
well to study. However, to try
to capture the essence of any
race of people in a symbol —
such as an Indian mascot — is
both futile and dangerous.
It helps limit other people's
perceptions of that culture to
the narrow confines of a
stereotype, and it leaves this
imperfect symbol open to mis
representation and exploita
tion.
Perhaps, as he indicated in
his article, DiMartino would be
proud to have his Italian ances
try mocked so, but I, also Ita
lian, choose to have no part of
it. I would not like to see a little
mustachioed caricature nod
ding its head at the traffic, both
hands holding a pizza and both
feet resting in a red gondola.
DiMarfino was right on one
point, though. The Daily
should refrain from using tact
less phrasing like "goon
squad" — there are more pre
cise terms befitting a responsi
ble editorial.
But DiMartino was even
more out of line by stating im
plicitly that the behavior of
Chief Lightfoot's bodyguards
was non-violent. Threats of
bodily harm and other thinly
veiled forms of coercion are

merely bloodless acts of vio
lence.
If, as he claims, DiMartino
did not view the bodyguards as
menacing, then he must have
grown up in a very tough
neighborhood, indeed.
I can sympathize somewhat
with the alumni's nostalgic af
fection for the Indian, and I am
sure that most of them intend
no malice when they don red
feathers four or five Saturdays
each fall. But I must sym
pathize most deeply with the
native Americans, who have
been fighting for their honor
for well over three centuries.
My sympathy for certain
alumni and students, however,
runs dry when I see them wear
ing T-shirts offensive to native
Americans.
As for Timm Williams him
self, I only hope that he listens
to and honors the wishes of the
native American students and
rechannels his misguided ef
forts. As for the spectators who
so distastefully welcomed the
return of the Chief, I only hope
they reflect upon their insensi
tive actions and rechannel
their disruptive energies to
ward honorable resolution of
the mascot issue.
!n closing, I would like to
commend the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization for
dealing responsibly with a very
emotional issue. Very soon I
would like to see the entire
issue put out to pasture.

But DiMartino was even
more out of line by stating im
plicitly that the behavior of
Chief Lightfoot's bodyguards
was non-violent. Threats of
bodily harm and other thinly
veiled forms of coercion are

merely bloodless acts of vio
lence.
If, as he claims, DiMartino
did not view the bodyguards as
menacing, then he must have
grown up in a very tough
neighborhood, indeed.
I can sympathize somewhat
with the alumni's nostalgic af
fection for the Indian, and I am
sure that most of them intend
no malice when they don red
feathers four or five Saturdays
each fall. But I must sym
pathize most deeply with the
native Americans, who have
been fighting for their honor
for well over three centuries.
My sympathy for certain
alumni and students, however,
runs dry when I see them wear
ing T-shirts offensive to native
Americans.
As for Timm Williams him
self, I only hope that he listens
to and honors the wishes of the
native American students and
rechannels his misguided ef
forts. As for the spectators who
so distastefully welcomed the
return of the Chief, I only hope
they reflect upon their insensi
tive actions and rechannel
their disruptive energies to
ward honorable resolution of
the mascot issue.
!n closing, I would like to
commend the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization for
dealing responsibly with a very
emotional issue. Very soon I
would like to see the entire
issue put out to pasture.
