justice to Israel
A prime source of misun
derstanding of the Middle East
situation is the inadequate no
tion of justice as occurring only
on one dimension, leaving out
the deeply personal and qual
itative dimension of existence.
A wise jurisprudence has
never neglected this dimen
sion, despite the sentimental
myth of pure equality bred by
the once-powerful enlighten
ment.

A great artist or political
leader is apt quite properly to
have "time off" a sentence for
his superior contribution to
society or life.
The gifts of the Hebrew tradi
tion to our mode of life are ob
viously part of the reason
Americans sway that way in re
cent polls.
One need not scant Arab
contributions, particularly in
the Middle Ages, in order to
see this. The Old Testament is
closer to us than the Koran, to
cite only the most obvious evi
dence.
Thus I am not particularly
moved by Einstein's remark
that the Jews have a "passion
ate sense of justice." Philip
Roth spoke as persuasively,
and partially, of the "passion
ate selfishness" of some of
them.
I am not denying that justice
in that sense has been an im
portant part of their doctrine
and tradition, but it is not what
strikes one first in the Middle
East picture.
In short, what I think is called
for here is justice to Israel, in
the full sense I spoke of, rather
than dubious claims of a par
ticular Jewish tradition of con
cern for others.
