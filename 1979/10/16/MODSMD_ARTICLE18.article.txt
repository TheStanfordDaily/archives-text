## Roses among the thorns 
### 
v It would be tempting to run
mrabout the Bread and Roses
concert, about the people who
fame, why they came, what
{tieir political beliefs are and
What sorts of records they own.
*, I will steel myself and resist
temptation, however, in favor
pf a more balanced look at the
event. In a sense, it was like a
football game.
I Waiting in line outside the
gates in a queue that wound
snake-like around the Berkeley
block, under the threatening
$kies, warmly clad against the
early October chiil, people

might as well have been wait
ing to see the Cal Bears per
form. But they weren't. We
were standing in line to see the
annual benefit concert for
Bread and Roses, an organiza
tion that sends musicians to
perform at mental hospitals,
prisons, convalescent homes
and other institutions.
Nuclear education
And standing in line was half
the fun. We educated the
people in front of us about the
dangers of nuclear power and
promised to send them "Ques
tion Authority" buttons (the

moral equivalent of rooting
pennants, I suppose). And
generally hung out patiently,
secure in the knowledge that
we'd get in soon enough.
And as the turnstile clunked
behind us and we found our
way to seats in Berkeley's
capacious Creek Theater, the
Persuasions came onstage, viv
idly clad and stomping out the
soul.
Fervor mounted. Applause
rang out. Only moments, dis
connected and hanging in the
overcast Berkeley afternoon
remain inscribed in my mind.
The one in the purple shirt
jumps off the stage onto the
pavement, just a few feet from
the first row. People come up
to join him, crooning into his
microphone, too. A few more
of the half-spectating, half
participating astonished audi
ence walk to his side, and start
to dance or sing.
Huddle
They huddle together to belt
out in unison, the rest of the
Persuasions climb down cauti
ously and go chanting up and
down the aisle. Arms raised in a
sense of victory and inspira
tion, they make their exit from
my memory.
A relief. I wasn't sure soul
and I would mix, but we did.
The master of ceremonies,
a minor figure in our tale,
makes his first appearance.
Pot-bellied and looking vag
uely like Bob Hope in an ab
surd black felt cowboy hat, he
fills the cracks between sets.

His monologue on political
argument, his German version
of Lewis Carroll's "Jabber
wocky" and his hokeyness will
probably stay in my memory
longer than I would like them
to.
And he finished his little act
by admonishing us to get up
and stretch and scratch and
"get it on."
Onward to Flora Purim. Her
last song is the only one I can
dredge up from the depths of
my mind. It was about getting
caught, it seemed
And letting yourself go, you
could feel the fear, the sinking
feeling in the pit of your
stomach you get if you see the
flashing blue light behind you.
Another intermission.
Another emcee, but a less re
markable one, by far. Grand
fatherly.
'Nuclear Madness'
At last, Graham Nash. Al
most timidly, he advanced to
the microphone with his har
monica on, and sang "Military
Madness," changing the
chorus to "Nuclear madness is
killing our country . . ."
Delicately, he removed his
dark blue blazer and brushed
his hair back. He could have
been just another person on
the Northside of Berkeley or in
Kepler's or Plowshare Books.
While he sang "Winchester
Cathedral," the sun peeked
through the clouds for the first
time in hours, uncannily cast
ing a golden shaft of sunbeams
onto the side of the amphithea
ter, lighting up the banks and
tiers of seats.
He called David Crosby out
of the wings to do a song with
him. That inevitably led to a
second, a third, and a fourth
harmonized version harking
back to days gone by. He told
us "You could be a really big
group — make it to the top.
Couldn't they, Dave?" And

Crosby agreed. He was choos
ing the old songs he was com
fortable with, he said, instead
of new material. And we ag
reed. Resoundingly.
We're back now after a suit
ably lengthy scratching break,
and the Polish Gdansk Medical
School Choir did its thing, a lit
tle extraneous to the mood or
the theme, perhaps, but we
were still riding high on
Graham Nash.
Glow quenched
And then came Maria Mul
daur, and the yeasty glow that
had risen in us was swiftly
punched down.
In lieu of real music, Mul
daur demonstrated how
enamored of her own voice
she could be. She lifted her
arms and flew on the wings of
her pendulous loose sleeves
from member to member of
her all-male accompanying
band, performing a short,
seductive courtship dance, a
parody of a bump-and-grind
routine, a slam-bam-thank
you-ma'am affair in front of
each. It's her style.
And for the encore, she
came out with the Persuasions
singing "Make It to the Prom
ised Land." As she danced
along with a Persuasion, it
looked like the two of them
might make it to the promised
bedroom before the day was
done.
Knights
Let us gloss over the New
Generation Singers, unctu
ously introduced by our favo
rite scratching emcee. Let us
gloss over their silver-and
-black capes, ties and handker
chiefs, undoubtedly meant to
make them look like knights in
shining armor (see also under
Bob Dylan).
Let us skip all that for our
patience's sake, and get right
to Peter, Paul and Mary.
In the now-waning light of a

fall afternoon, almost six hours
after the Persuasions had leapt
into our midst, a culmination
of sorts was about to begin.
Moments
Moments. A moment of sing
ing "If I had a Hammer," a
moment of appreciating old
English wassail songs. A mo
ment of appreciating Mary
Travers' abundant arm ges
tures and expansive expressive
motions. A touching moment
of 8000 people all whispering a
chorus of "Puff the Magic Dra
gon," all setting a sensitive
tone and lending a gentle
timbre to the gathering.
People instinctively swayed
with the music they had
swayed to so many years be
fore, and finally, for their en
core, Peter, Paul and Mary
brought out all the musicians
in the wings, includingCrosby,
Nash and Pete Seeger to sing a
song "that we couldn't sing for
many years." Would it be "The
Times They Are a-Changin'?"

And why couldn't they have
sung it before?
"I roamed and I rambled, and I
followed my footsteps
. . . "This land is your land,
this land is my land, from
California to the New York is
land, From the Gulf stream
waters to the Redwood
forests This land was made
for you and me." When they
were done we wouldn't let
them stop. So they obligingly
continued, ending the three
day acoustic-music festival
with Dylan's "Blowin' in the
Wind."
But I don't understand. Is
this land our land already or is
the answer still blowing in the
wind? We could debate that for
a long time. Come over some
night and maybe we will. But it
really doesn't matter that
much. Because we really were
a big group. We made it to the
top. After all, didn't David
Crosby agree?

David Crosby, Graham Nash and their accompanying guitarist sang
at the Bread and Roses concert in Berkeley's Greek Theatre last
weekend.
v It would be tempting to run
mrabout the Bread and Roses
concert, about the people who
fame, why they came, what
{tieir political beliefs are and
What sorts of records they own.
*, I will steel myself and resist
temptation, however, in favor
pf a more balanced look at the
event. In a sense, it was like a
football game.
I Waiting in line outside the
gates in a queue that wound
snake-like around the Berkeley
block, under the threatening
$kies, warmly clad against the
early October chiil, people

might as well have been wait
ing to see the Cal Bears per
form. But they weren't. We
were standing in line to see the
annual benefit concert for
Bread and Roses, an organiza
tion that sends musicians to
perform at mental hospitals,
prisons, convalescent homes
and other institutions.
Nuclear education
And standing in line was half
the fun. We educated the
people in front of us about the
dangers of nuclear power and
promised to send them "Ques
tion Authority" buttons (the

moral equivalent of rooting
pennants, I suppose). And
generally hung out patiently,
secure in the knowledge that
we'd get in soon enough.
And as the turnstile clunked
behind us and we found our
way to seats in Berkeley's
capacious Creek Theater, the
Persuasions came onstage, viv
idly clad and stomping out the
soul.
Fervor mounted. Applause
rang out. Only moments, dis
connected and hanging in the
overcast Berkeley afternoon
remain inscribed in my mind.
The one in the purple shirt
jumps off the stage onto the
pavement, just a few feet from
the first row. People come up
to join him, crooning into his
microphone, too. A few more
of the half-spectating, half
participating astonished audi
ence walk to his side, and start
to dance or sing.
Huddle
They huddle together to belt
out in unison, the rest of the
Persuasions climb down cauti
ously and go chanting up and
down the aisle. Arms raised in a
sense of victory and inspira
tion, they make their exit from
my memory.
A relief. I wasn't sure soul
and I would mix, but we did.
The master of ceremonies,
a minor figure in our tale,
makes his first appearance.
Pot-bellied and looking vag
uely like Bob Hope in an ab
surd black felt cowboy hat, he
fills the cracks between sets.

His monologue on political
argument, his German version
of Lewis Carroll's "Jabber
wocky" and his hokeyness will
probably stay in my memory
longer than I would like them
to.
And he finished his little act
by admonishing us to get up
and stretch and scratch and
"get it on."
Onward to Flora Purim. Her
last song is the only one I can
dredge up from the depths of
my mind. It was about getting
caught, it seemed
And letting yourself go, you
could feel the fear, the sinking
feeling in the pit of your
stomach you get if you see the
flashing blue light behind you.
Another intermission.
Another emcee, but a less re
markable one, by far. Grand
fatherly.
'Nuclear Madness'
At last, Graham Nash. Al
most timidly, he advanced to
the microphone with his har
monica on, and sang "Military
Madness," changing the
chorus to "Nuclear madness is
killing our country . . ."
Delicately, he removed his
dark blue blazer and brushed
his hair back. He could have
been just another person on
the Northside of Berkeley or in
Kepler's or Plowshare Books.
While he sang "Winchester
Cathedral," the sun peeked
through the clouds for the first
time in hours, uncannily cast
ing a golden shaft of sunbeams
onto the side of the amphithea
ter, lighting up the banks and
tiers of seats.
He called David Crosby out
of the wings to do a song with
him. That inevitably led to a
second, a third, and a fourth
harmonized version harking
back to days gone by. He told
us "You could be a really big
group — make it to the top.
Couldn't they, Dave?" And

Crosby agreed. He was choos
ing the old songs he was com
fortable with, he said, instead
of new material. And we ag
reed. Resoundingly.
We're back now after a suit
ably lengthy scratching break,
and the Polish Gdansk Medical
School Choir did its thing, a lit
tle extraneous to the mood or
the theme, perhaps, but we
were still riding high on
Graham Nash.
Glow quenched
And then came Maria Mul
daur, and the yeasty glow that
had risen in us was swiftly
punched down.
In lieu of real music, Mul
daur demonstrated how
enamored of her own voice
she could be. She lifted her
arms and flew on the wings of
her pendulous loose sleeves
from member to member of
her all-male accompanying
band, performing a short,
seductive courtship dance, a
parody of a bump-and-grind
routine, a slam-bam-thank
you-ma'am affair in front of
each. It's her style.
And for the encore, she
came out with the Persuasions
singing "Make It to the Prom
ised Land." As she danced
along with a Persuasion, it
looked like the two of them
might make it to the promised
bedroom before the day was
done.
Knights
Let us gloss over the New
Generation Singers, unctu
ously introduced by our favo
rite scratching emcee. Let us
gloss over their silver-and
-black capes, ties and handker
chiefs, undoubtedly meant to
make them look like knights in
shining armor (see also under
Bob Dylan).
Let us skip all that for our
patience's sake, and get right
to Peter, Paul and Mary.
In the now-waning light of a

fall afternoon, almost six hours
after the Persuasions had leapt
into our midst, a culmination
of sorts was about to begin.
Moments
Moments. A moment of sing
ing "If I had a Hammer," a
moment of appreciating old
English wassail songs. A mo
ment of appreciating Mary
Travers' abundant arm ges
tures and expansive expressive
motions. A touching moment
of 8000 people all whispering a
chorus of "Puff the Magic Dra
gon," all setting a sensitive
tone and lending a gentle
timbre to the gathering.
People instinctively swayed
with the music they had
swayed to so many years be
fore, and finally, for their en
core, Peter, Paul and Mary
brought out all the musicians
in the wings, includingCrosby,
Nash and Pete Seeger to sing a
song "that we couldn't sing for
many years." Would it be "The
Times They Are a-Changin'?"

And why couldn't they have
sung it before?
"I roamed and I rambled, and I
followed my footsteps
. . . "This land is your land,
this land is my land, from
California to the New York is
land, From the Gulf stream
waters to the Redwood
forests This land was made
for you and me." When they
were done we wouldn't let
them stop. So they obligingly
continued, ending the three

core, Peter, Paul and Mary
brought out all the musicians
in the wings, includingCrosby,
Nash and Pete Seeger to sing a
song "that we couldn't sing for
many years." Would it be "The
Times They Are a-Changin'?"

And why couldn't they have
sung it before?
"I roamed and I rambled, and I
followed my footsteps
. . . "This land is your land,
this land is my land, from
California to the New York is
land, From the Gulf stream
waters to the Redwood
forests This land was made
for you and me." When they
were done we wouldn't let
them stop. So they obligingly
continued, ending the three
day acoustic-music festival
with Dylan's "Blowin' in the
Wind."
But I don't understand. Is
this land our land already or is
the answer still blowing in the
wind? We could debate that for
a long time. Come over some
night and maybe we will. But it
really doesn't matter that
much. Because we really were
a big group. We made it to the
top. After all, didn't David
Crosby agree?

David Crosby, Graham Nash and their accompanying guitarist sang
at the Bread and Roses concert in Berkeley's Greek Theatre last
weekend.
v It would be tempting to run
mrabout the Bread and Roses
concert, about the people who
fame, why they came, what
{tieir political beliefs are and
What sorts of records they own.
*, I will steel myself and resist
temptation, however, in favor
pf a more balanced look at the
event. In a sense, it was like a
football game.
I Waiting in line outside the
gates in a queue that wound
snake-like around the Berkeley
block, under the threatening
$kies, warmly clad against the
early October chiil, people

might as well have been wait
ing to see the Cal Bears per
form. But they weren't. We
were standing in line to see the
annual benefit concert for
Bread and Roses, an organiza
tion that sends musicians to
perform at mental hospitals,
prisons, convalescent homes
and other institutions.
Nuclear education
And standing in line was half
the fun. We educated the
people in front of us about the
dangers of nuclear power and
promised to send them "Ques
tion Authority" buttons (the

moral equivalent of rooting
pennants, I suppose). And
generally hung out patiently,
secure in the knowledge that
we'd get in soon enough.
And as the turnstile clunked
behind us and we found our
way to seats in Berkeley's
capacious Creek Theater, the
Persuasions came onstage, viv
idly clad and stomping out the
soul.
Fervor mounted. Applause
rang out. Only moments, dis
connected and hanging in the
overcast Berkeley afternoon
remain inscribed in my mind.
The one in the purple shirt
jumps off the stage onto the
pavement, just a few feet from
the first row. People come up
to join him, crooning into his
microphone, too. A few more
of the half-spectating, half
participating astonished audi
ence walk to his side, and start
to dance or sing.
Huddle
They huddle together to belt
out in unison, the rest of the
Persuasions climb down cauti
ously and go chanting up and
down the aisle. Arms raised in a
sense of victory and inspira
tion, they make their exit from
my memory.
A relief. I wasn't sure soul
and I would mix, but we did.
The master of ceremonies,
a minor figure in our tale,
makes his first appearance.
Pot-bellied and looking vag
uely like Bob Hope in an ab
surd black felt cowboy hat, he
fills the cracks between sets.

His monologue on political
argument, his German version
of Lewis Carroll's "Jabber
wocky" and his hokeyness will
probably stay in my memory
longer than I would like them
to.
And he finished his little act
by admonishing us to get up
and stretch and scratch and
"get it on."
Onward to Flora Purim. Her
last song is the only one I can
dredge up from the depths of
my mind. It was about getting
caught, it seemed
And letting yourself go, you
could feel the fear, the sinking
feeling in the pit of your
stomach you get if you see the
flashing blue light behind you.
Another intermission.
Another emcee, but a less re
markable one, by far. Grand
fatherly.
'Nuclear Madness'
At last, Graham Nash. Al
most timidly, he advanced to
the microphone with his har
monica on, and sang "Military
Madness," changing the
chorus to "Nuclear madness is
killing our country . . ."
Delicately, he removed his
dark blue blazer and brushed
his hair back. He could have
been just another person on
the Northside of Berkeley or in
Kepler's or Plowshare Books.
While he sang "Winchester
Cathedral," the sun peeked
through the clouds for the first
time in hours, uncannily cast
ing a golden shaft of sunbeams
onto the side of the amphithea
ter, lighting up the banks and
tiers of seats.
He called David Crosby out
of the wings to do a song with
him. That inevitably led to a
second, a third, and a fourth
harmonized version harking
back to days gone by. He told
us "You could be a really big
group — make it to the top.
Couldn't they, Dave?" And

Crosby agreed. He was choos
ing the old songs he was com
fortable with, he said, instead
of new material. And we ag
reed. Resoundingly.
We're back now after a suit
ably lengthy scratching break,
and the Polish Gdansk Medical
School Choir did its thing, a lit
tle extraneous to the mood or
the theme, perhaps, but we
were still riding high on
Graham Nash.
Glow quenched
And then came Maria Mul
daur, and the yeasty glow that
had risen in us was swiftly
punched down.
In lieu of real music, Mul
daur demonstrated how
enamored of her own voice
she could be. She lifted her
arms and flew on the wings of
her pendulous loose sleeves
from member to member of
her all-male accompanying
band, performing a short,
seductive courtship dance, a
parody of a bump-and-grind
routine, a slam-bam-thank
you-ma'am affair in front of
each. It's her style.
And for the encore, she
came out with the Persuasions
singing "Make It to the Prom
ised Land." As she danced
along with a Persuasion, it
looked like the two of them
might make it to the promised
bedroom before the day was
done.
Knights
Let us gloss over the New
Generation Singers, unctu
ously introduced by our favo
rite scratching emcee. Let us
gloss over their silver-and
-black capes, ties and handker
chiefs, undoubtedly meant to
make them look like knights in
shining armor (see also under
Bob Dylan).
Let us skip all that for our
patience's sake, and get right
to Peter, Paul and Mary.
In the now-waning light of a

fall afternoon, almost six hours
after the Persuasions had leapt
into our midst, a culmination
of sorts was about to begin.
Moments
Moments. A moment of sing
ing "If I had a Hammer," a
moment of appreciating old
English wassail songs. A mo
ment of appreciating Mary
Travers' abundant arm ges
tures and expansive expressive
motions. A touching moment
of 8000 people all whispering a
chorus of "Puff the Magic Dra
gon," all setting a sensitive
tone and lending a gentle
timbre to the gathering.
People instinctively swayed
with the music they had
swayed to so many years be
fore, and finally, for their en
core, Peter, Paul and Mary
brought out all the musicians
in the wings, includingCrosby,
Nash and Pete Seeger to sing a
song "that we couldn't sing for
many years." Would it be "The
Times They Are a-Changin'?"

And why couldn't they have
sung it before?
"I roamed and I rambled, and I
followed my footsteps
. . . "This land is your land,
this land is my land, from
California to the New York is
land, From the Gulf stream
waters to the Redwood
forests This land was made
for you and me." When they
were done we wouldn't let
them stop. So they obligingly
continued, ending the three
day acoustic-music festival
with Dylan's "Blowin' in the
Wind."
But I don't understand. Is
this land our land already or is
the answer still blowing in the
wind? We could debate that for
a long time. Come over some
night and maybe we will. But it
really doesn't matter that
much. Because we really were
a big group. We made it to the
top. After all, didn't David
Crosby agree?
