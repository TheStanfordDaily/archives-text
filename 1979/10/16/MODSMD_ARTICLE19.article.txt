# Turrentine diversified
## 
### 
Tenor saxophonist Stan
ley Turrentine sampled
from a wide variety of musi
cal styles at his concert
Thursday night in Palo Alto.
During the course of the
evening at the Keystone,
Turrentine and his band
dabbled in straight jazz,
blues, fusion, pop and, of
course, the inevitable disco.
This diversity showed that
Turrentine is more at home
in some styles than others.
To the jazz purist, of
course, disco tunes are usu
ally a bit of a disappoint
ment. True to form, the sev
eral disco songs which Tur
rentine and his band per
formed Thursday night
tended to feature some
material which was musi
cally less interesting than
most of the rest. The
themes, melodies, and ar
rangements of these pieces
lacked an innovative and
individual sound and by the
third disco song in a row,
things were getting a bit re
petitious.
However, whatever some
may think of disco, it is what
a lot of the audience came
to hear, judging by the mul
titude of shaking booties
out on the dance floor. It
isn't hard to see why Turren
tine plays it.
The best points of the
show, by contrast, were the
blues pieces, played by Tur
rentine with soulful author
ity and conviction. A couple
of songs from Turrentine's
past days, "Don't Mess with
Mister T." and "Sugar,"
were particularly well done.
In "Don't Mess With Mis
ter T.", Turrentine soloed
creatively while the band
weaved different tempos
and textures backing him
up. John Miller on
keyboards contributed a
classical-sounding piano

break. On "Sugar," Turren
tine did his most experi
mental improvisation of the
night, and the guitarist
toned down his distortion
enough to play what
sounded more like a jazz
guitar solo. In the context of
this song it was just the right
touch.
The band also played
some more pop-oriented
tunes, among them the
well-received "Pieces of
Dreams." Turrentine par
ticularly stood out on a
couple of slow ballads; his
saxophone became like a
human voice as it cried out
the notes.
The Turrentine band also
attempted to do a version of
Weather Report's "Bird
land." It was a good effort,
but somehow did not quite
come off. Turrentine does
not have the bright, broad
tone of a Wayne Shorter
which makes the song so
notable. Miller also proved
to be less proficient on the
synthesizer than he was on
the piano; as a result his ver
sion lacked the dense layer
ing of sound of the original.
)ohn Palm opened the
show as a warmup act. He
sang several hilarious songs
lamenting the decadence of
life in the suburbs. After ap
proximately thirty minutes,
though, he was literally
shouted down and driven
off the stage by an obnoxi
ous audience which was
impatient to hear Stanley
Turrentine.
Though the concert suf
fered a little for its inconsis
tencies, one wasn't sure
whether it was a jazz con
cert or a disco dance, if one
was willing to accept it as a
littleofeach, itturnedoutto
be a pretty enjoyable even
ing.
