# Prof tells DOE no safe method exists for containment of nuclear waste

### Eileen Delehanty 
A University professor has entered the nuclear waste
disposal debate, telling a Department of Energy (DOE)
panel last week that underground storage of nuclear
wastes is dangerous and "cannot be relied upon as part
of an expanding nuclear electric power system."
C. Frederick Hansen, professor of aeronautics and
astronautics, told the five member panel in San Fran
cisco that there is "no safe way to store nuclear waste."
The panel was formed to evaluate an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) on management of commercially
generated radioactive waste.
The EIS, completed in April, concludes that "the dis
posal of radioactive waste in geologic formations can be
developed with minimal environmental consequ
ences."
Hansen disagreed. He termed the ElS's conclusions
"merely optimistic.
"I suspect these conclusions have been forced upon
personnel of the DOE by tremendous economic and
political pressures," he told the panel.
Hansen is also a senior staff scientist at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Re
search Center in Mountain View. He decided to testify at
the public hearing independent of both the University
and NASA.
Alternatives researched
Hansen has worked with NASA in developing and
comparing possible methods for nuclear waste disposal.
Prior to coming to the University in 1972, he had concen
trated his efforts on researching the possibility of
launching nuclear waste into space.
The space storage method was finally found to be
unfeasible, he said, because of the expense involved
and because the actual launching of the materials posed
a danger to the population.
In his testimony, he said that during his research he
came to the conclusion that there is "no safe way to store
nuclear waste."
It was with this conviction that he testified Monday.
He estimated later that those who testified were divided
50-50 on the feasibility and safety of nuclear waste stor
age in rock formations.
One of those who disagreed with Hansen was John
Van Hoomisen, manager of spent tuel services opera
tion for General Electric Corp.

He termed the danger of such storage of nuclear
wastes as "infinitesimal in comparison to natural
background" radiation, the radiation the world in gen
eral is exposed to from the sun and other sources.
Hansen discounted Van Hoomisen's argument, say
ing "You have to understand that the people who are
pro-nuclear storage have been trained this way. They
teel that this attack on nuclear energy is an attack on
their lives."
He said at the hearing that he can "sympathize with
the engineers and planners who prepared the EIS
document. The pressures on them are certainly tre
mendous."
Hansen said after the hearing that he believes many
companies will begin to withdraw support for the use of
nuclear fuel because of "too much responsibility.
"I see signs that nuclear fuel will be limited," specu
lated Hansen. And he added that he saw the DOE's
handling of the nuclear waste storage problem as merely
"a spearhead to what we should do about nuclear
weapons."
Makes recommendations
Hansen summarized his statement to the DOE panel
by making four recommendations. He suggested that
the panel: 1) make clear to the DOE that geologic burial
of nuclear waste is merely the best of presently available
options; 2) consider the problem of safe handling be
fore burial; 3) insist on realistic cost estimates for waste
disposal, and 4) admit to the public and government the
full spectrum of costs and hazards involved in nuclear
waste.
"Continuing to produce and use nuclear energy with
out proper disposal methods of by-products is like
building and operating a machine without knowledge
that your parts are going to work," he said after the
hearing.
Researchers nationwide have been investigating for
several years the feasibility of underground storage of
nuclear waste.
Two western sites, the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in
Eddy County, N.M., and the Hanford, Wash., project in
south-central Washington, are among several currently
being considered as nuclear waste depositories. In each
of those facilities, the wastes would be stored at 2000 to
3000 feet underground in areas determined to be not
susceptible to earthquakes or other dangers.

The EIS, completed in April, concludes that "the dis
posal of radioactive waste in geologic formations can be
developed with minimal environmental consequ
ences."
Hansen disagreed. He termed the ElS's conclusions
"merely optimistic.
"I suspect these conclusions have been forced upon
personnel of the DOE by tremendous economic and
political pressures," he told the panel.
Hansen is also a senior staff scientist at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Re
search Center in Mountain View. He decided to testify at
the public hearing independent of both the University
and NASA.
Alternatives researched
Hansen has worked with NASA in developing and
comparing possible methods for nuclear waste disposal.
Prior to coming to the University in 1972, he had concen
trated his efforts on researching the possibility of
launching nuclear waste into space.
The space storage method was finally found to be
unfeasible, he said, because of the expense involved
and because the actual launching of the materials posed
a danger to the population.
In his testimony, he said that during his research he
came to the conclusion that there is "no safe way to store
nuclear waste."
It was with this conviction that he testified Monday.
He estimated later that those who testified were divided
50-50 on the feasibility and safety of nuclear waste stor
age in rock formations.
One of those who disagreed with Hansen was John
Van Hoomisen, manager of spent tuel services opera
tion for General Electric Corp.

He termed the danger of such storage of nuclear
wastes as "infinitesimal in comparison to natural
background" radiation, the radiation the world in gen
eral is exposed to from the sun and other sources.
Hansen discounted Van Hoomisen's argument, say
ing "You have to understand that the people who are
pro-nuclear storage have been trained this way. They
teel that this attack on nuclear energy is an attack on
their lives."
He said at the hearing that he can "sympathize with
the engineers and planners who prepared the EIS
document. The pressures on them are certainly tre
mendous."
Hansen said after the hearing that he believes many
companies will begin to withdraw support for the use of
nuclear fuel because of "too much responsibility.
"I see signs that nuclear fuel will be limited," specu
lated Hansen. And he added that he saw the DOE's
handling of the nuclear waste storage problem as merely
"a spearhead to what we should do about nuclear
weapons."
Makes recommendations
Hansen summarized his statement to the DOE panel
by making four recommendations. He suggested that
the panel: 1) make clear to the DOE that geologic burial
of nuclear waste is merely the best of presently available
options; 2) consider the problem of safe handling be
fore burial; 3) insist on realistic cost estimates for waste
disposal, and 4) admit to the public and government the
full spectrum of costs and hazards involved in nuclear
waste.
"Continuing to produce and use nuclear energy with
out proper disposal methods of by-products is like
building and operating a machine without knowledge
that your parts are going to work," he said after the
hearing.
Researchers nationwide have been investigating for
several years the feasibility of underground storage of
nuclear waste.
Two western sites, the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in
Eddy County, N.M., and the Hanford, Wash., project in
south-central Washington, are among several currently
being considered as nuclear waste depositories. In each
of those facilities, the wastes would be stored at 2000 to
3000 feet underground in areas determined to be not
susceptible to earthquakes or other dangers.
