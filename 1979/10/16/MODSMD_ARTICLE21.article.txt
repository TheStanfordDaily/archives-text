# Juliet shines in ACT's Shakespearean gem
## 
### 
When Julia Fletcher's Juliet
first calls upon Romeo from
her balcony in the ACT's ad
mirable production of Romeo
and juliet, the audience, like
Romeo, finds itself transfixed
by both sound and sense.
Romeo, played by Thomas
Nahrwold, lies in the Capulet
orchard below, moaning out
his love — ind then stops, as
Fletcher's rich, gentle voice
fills the theater.
It is a theatrical moment so
right that the audience grows
tired with a tender awe. Not
only do we believe in the mo
ment, but at this moment so
full of life we cannot believe,
we forget, that the play will end
in a tomb.
It is, however, a moment that
Allen Fletcher's direction has
prepared us for: we are ready
to yield ourselves to the per
formance Fletcher's (Julia
Fletcher's father) choice of
styles for this production is es
sentially correct, correct be
cause the choices he has made
grow directly from the text,
rather than being tacked onto
the text as so many "innova
tive" productions of Shakes
peare are.
The result is a "straight"
production, with a meticulous
attention to detail that gives it
more of a Renaissance "feel"
than any in recent memory.
Verona's streets
Characters do not speak on a
stage devoid of background
life. When Capulet meets
Montague in the street, we
know it is a street, a street filled
with beggars and whores and
women doing washing who get
in the way of the combatants —
somehow without distracting
our attention, because

Fletcher makes us take them
for granted.
Mercutio and BenvoHo eat
apples on stage. Characters
wear codpieces, and motley,
upturned shoes. Beggars ask
for alms at the ends of the
scenes, are shoved away by
those who will not give alms.
The stage as a whole comes
alivewith a wealth of detail, de
tail of the sort usually ignored
on a stage although preserved
in movies. Fletcher's direction
reminds us that the play is not
set in a vacuum, but in a living
world.
Young love
Most importantly, he re
minds us that Romeo and Juliet
is about young love. The lines
themselves are enough for
that, but it helps for Romeo to
have an adolescent, freshly
scrubbed look to him, to walk
on stage plucking petals from a
flower. Julia Fletcher makes us
believe in Juliet as a fourteen
year old, who pouts and frets at
her Nurse's verbal meander
ings, as a giddy, coltish girl in
whom a sort of innocent sexu
ality is beginning to stir.
This emphasis is important;
what makes the tragedy possi
ble is not simply that Romeo
and Juliet are sundered lovers,
but that they are young lovers,
that only the very young can
love with their desperate year
ning, in which a minute apart
becomes eternity.
The play moves well initially;
when the first half closes, as
the couple kneel before Friar
Laurence at their wedding, we
are surprised at how very far
we've come in an hour.
There are, however, prob
lems with the second half's
pacing — problems not so

much in the performance, I
think, as in the play itself. The
second half opens with two
magnificently staged episodes
— first the battle between
Tybalt (Mark Murphey) and
Mercutio (Daniel Davis), a bat
tle which Mercutio plays for
laughs, in which he could kill
the Capulet half a dozen times,
but in which he himself is fi
nally slain.
A minute later Romeo and
Tybalt fight. It is Nahrwold's
high point, a moment of un
checked rage in which he not
only kills Tybalt — who gets
tangled in the laundry hung
out to dry in the street — but
stabs him a dozen times, an act
of brutality from which we
cannot draw our eyes.
Wilt's mistakes
The problem is that the
scene is so wrenchingly well
done that we are emotionally
ready for the play's conclusion.
Shakespeare has built to one
crescendo, but then has to let
us down and build to another.
It doesn't work. There are
some dull, mechanical scenes
to be gotten through before
the final one, scenes that the
acting can only rarely trans
cend, because the problem is
in the structure of the play it
selt, reminding us that this is

one of Shakespeare's early
tragedies, that though it may
be more satisfying than a later
play such as Othello, it doesn't
work as neatly.
The acting itself is good
throughout. Julia Fletcher is
simply magnificent; Nahrwold
is also good, but pales a bit, not
only beside Fletcher, but in
comparison with Davis' Mer
cutio.
Complex Mercutio
Mercutio is, I think, the
play's most complex character,
a character who seizes life with
a bawdy, comedic zest but in
whom melancholy rules,
melancholy which Davis allows
to steal over his face when no
one but the audience is watch
ing.
Juliet's Nurse is one of those
roles in which it is easy to en
dear yourself to an audience;
nevertheless, Anne Lawder
does it well, speaking in an
American working-class voice
which contrasts nicely with the
other character's crisp, patri
cian tones.
Among the supporting
players I especially enjoyed Jef
frey Allin as Benvolio, and
Thomas Oglesby as the clow
nish servant, Peter.
David L. Boushev's fight
sequences are done with an

authentic vigor, reminiscent of
Richard Lester's Three Mus
keteers. They are quite possi
bly the best fight scenes I've
yet seen on stage. Ralph
Funicello's set — a slanted
stage thrust into the audience,
dominated by the balcony —
works well, especially in the
way that he and Fletcher use
the beggars and such to move
the portable props around.
Warren Travis' costumes are
striking, and strikingly well in
tegrated with each other and
the production's style, adding
to our sense of the stage as not
just a stage, but a place.
So what's wrong with the
production? Very little, I think.
Richard Denison as the Prince
of Verona adds little; his voice
lacks the emotional distance
from the action which is essen
tial to a Shakespearean prince
of that sort. Larry Delinger's
score is a stylistic hodgepodge
which is only erratically effec
tive, and sometimes simply ob
trusive.
Beyond that, my quarrels are
few and far between, lost
somewhere between the street
scenes and Juliet's balcony. Co
see it.
