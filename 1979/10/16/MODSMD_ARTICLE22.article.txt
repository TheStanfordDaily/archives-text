1 dead in big S. Calif, quake
Calexico, Calif. — At least one person was
killed and 76 others injured yesterday as a
powerful earthquake toppled buildings and
bridges, started several fires and damaged an
aqueduct and water mains in the Imperial Val
ley.
High-rise buildings swayed as far away as Las
Vegas and Los Angeles.
The fatality was reported in Mexicali,
Mexico, just across the border from this
south-eastern California desert town.
Damage was widespread throughout the
90,000-population Imperial Valley, an irrigated
agricultural area about 100 miles east of San
Diego.
Seismologists at California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena said the 4:16 p.m.
temblor registered 6.4 on the Richter scale and
was centered 10 miles east of here — right on
the Mexican border. There were several dozen
aftershocks ranging up to 5 on the Richter
scale, Caltech seismologists said.
A geologist said the land fault where the
earthquake was centered probably was the
Imperial Fault, an extension of the San Andreas
Fault system that starts in Northern California
and runs down the length of the state, going
into the Gulf of California.
El Salvador president flees
San Salvador, El Salvador — Army rebels
seized four key military barracks yesterday,
forcing President Carlos Humberto Romero
from office, diplomatic and rebel sources said.
The reports said Romero fled the country
and one officer was killed.
The usually reliable diplomatic sources said
Romero left by commercial airline bound for
the United States with his family.

A rebel spokesman said a major and two
colonels, all unidentified, led the coup against
Romero, a rightist army general who was
elected two years ago to a four-year term.
Earlier, a rebel spokesman said the rebels
wanted to "seek a change in the structure of
the armed forces and effect the changes that
are necessary in the country."
The rebels claimed they were in control of all
14 departments, or states, throughout this
country, which has a population of 4.5 million
and is the smallest Central American nation,
sandwiched between Guatemala, Honduras
and the Pacific Ocean.
Libya, Iran raise oil prices
New York — Oil industry sources said yes
terday that Libya and Iran were raising the
prices of their crude oil, putting more pressure
on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) for a general price rise.
Analysts said the price increases by the two
nations could add a penny or two to the price
of a gallon of gasoline or heating oil in the
United States. Libya and Iran provide about 10
percent of the oil used by the United States.
President Jimmy Carter has repeatedly
blamed much of the United States' current in
flation on increases in the price of foreign oil.
Libya, which supplies about 5 percent of the
oil used by the United States, raised its price
for crude oil Monday by $2.77 a barrel, or 12
percent, to between $25.57 and $26.27 a barrel.
Libya produces some of the world's best oil,
ideal for the making of gasoline.
Iran raised the price of its best-quality oil by
$1.50 a barrel, to $23.50 a barrel, and of its
lower-quality crude by $2.87 to $22.77 a barrel,
retroactive to Oct. 1.
At OPEC's last meeting in June, the cartel

decided on official prices ranging from $18 to
$23.50 a barrel, and members pledged to try to
keep from exceeding the $23.50-a-barrel level.
But there have been hints in recent weeks that
the ceiling might be weakening.
Carter forms 'families' office
Chicago — President Jimmy Carter, declar
ing that the family unit is in trouble, told a
Roman Catholic audience yesterday that he is
establishing an "Office for Families" in the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW).
Speaking to the National Conference of
Catholic Charities meeting in Kansas City,
Mo., the president called the family "one as
pect of our national life" where a partnership
of public and private interests is needed.
Carter said three White House conferences
on families will be held next summer in Balti
more, Minneapolis and Los Angeles fora "long
overdue assessment of how actions by gov
ernment and major private institutions help,
hurt or neglect American families."
Carter said the "Office for Families" in HEW
is the first of its kind and will help implement
the recommendations of the White FHouse
conferences.
Turkish premier resigns
Ankara, Turkey — Turkish Premier Bulent
Ecevit announced his resignation yesterday
because of an election defeat that gave more
power to the opposition forces led by former
premier Suleyman Demirel.
Ecevit said he formally would submit the res
ignation of his government to President Fahri
Koruturk today.
"Our government has lost a majority in the

Parliament. The election results as they reflect
in the Parliament necessitate a change of gov
ernment," Ecevit told reporters after emerging
from the meetings.
The premier's party, which took power from
Demirel's Justice Party in 1977, lost all five As
sembly seats being contested in mid-term
elections Sunday as well as crucial seats in the
Senate.
In the elections, Ecevit's party drew 29 per
cent of the vote in the Senate elections, while
Demirel's party got 49 percent.
Ecevit's government has been plagued by
gang fighting and terrorism. At least 2100 per
sons have been killed during its tenure. Infla
tion reached 100 percent, unemployment rose
and there were shortages of goods ranging
from gasoline to lightbuibs.
