## Nobel science prizes awarded

Stockton, Sweden (AP) — Two
Americans and a Pakistani who took
up where Einstein left off in search
ing for a key to the universe won the
Nobel Prize in physics yesterday, and
an American and West German who
found ways to produce new drugs,
pesticides and other important or
ganic compounds were awarded the
chemistry prize.
It made 1979 another year of U.S.
domination of the three Nobel sci
ence prizes. Four of the seven
laureates are Americans, the same
proportion as in 1978.
The physics winners were two
Harvard professors, Sheldon
Clashowand Steven Weinberg, both
46-year-old New York City natives,
and Professor Abdus Salam, 53, a
physicist working in Britain and Italy
who is the first Pakistani to win a
Nobel.
Both Weinberg and Clashow have
taught at Stanford in the past.
Glashow was an asst. professor of
physics in 1961 and 1962, while
Weinberg has been a visiting profes
sor at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) off and on over the
last several years.
Sydney Drell, deputy director of
SLAC, said the award for the physi
cists' research is "a well-deserved
recognition."
"We're very delighted," Drell said.
"Their contribution has been a step
toward unifying weak and elec

tromagnetic forces."
Wittig's co-winner in chemistry
was Professor Herbert Brown, 67, a
London-born U.S. citizen teaching at
Indiana's Purdue University.
The selections were made by the
Swedish Royal Academy of Science.
Each prize carries a stipend of
$190,000 to be shared among its win
ners.
The three physicists were honored
for highly theoretical work on a fun
damental aspect of science — the
forces that hold matter together.
There are four fundamental forces
in nature: gravity, which makes ap
ples fall and the planets go around
the sun, electromagnetic which is .v»-
sponsible for electricity and holds
electrons in atoms, and two nuclear
forces, the strong and the weak,
which operate inside the atomic nuc
leus.
The prize-winning research was
aimed at demonstrating that elec
tromagnetic forces and "weak in
teraction" forces within the atom's
nucleus are just different forms of
the same phenomenon.
Glashow said he believes that a
single force underlies all three, and
that they are simply three ways in
which it is manifested.
Salam and Weinberg published
papers in 1967 postulating the
electromagnetic-weak interaction
link.
These findings were a "real break

through," bringing nearer the pros
pect of a unified theory of physics,
said Dr. Christopher Isham, a col
league of Salam's at London's Impe
rial College of Sciences and
Technology. It represented the first
unification of two basic natural
forces since electricity and mag
netism were shown to be connected
more than a century ago.
Isham said the theory would help
scientists understand the as
trophysics of stars and how the uni
verse originated.
"Einstein spent the last 20 years of
his life trying to do what Professor
Salam has done, without any suc
cess. It is a great achievement,"
Isham said.
Brown and Wittig, the chemistry
winners, were recognized for
pioneering work in developing
boron- and phosphorous-based
compounds as reagents, chemical
tools, for the synthesis of complex
organic compounds. Such complex
compounds have many applications,
from medicine to pesticides.
"Organoboranes," the Brown
developed boron reagents, have
been used, for example, in finding a
non-polluting method for bleaching
paper.
Wittig's phosphorous-based rea
gents have, among other things,
facilitated production of vitamins
and helped combat malaria mos
quitoes and other pests by making it
possible to synthesize new kinds of
pesticides to which they have not de
veloped resistance.
