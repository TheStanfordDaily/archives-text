# Elections slated for senate, referenda
## 
### Rebecca Moss 
When students cast their ballots in
the ASSU election today and tomor
row, they will be choosing from over
twice as many senatorial candidates
as last year.
Whereas 26 undergraduates and 10
graduates contended last year for the
20 available positions, 61 under
graduates and 19 graduates are cur
rently running.
Council "112 Presidents (COP)
member Torn Gart attributes this
sizeable increase in the number of
candidates to the record compiled by
the previous senate. "Even though
the senate wasn't totally successful
last year, they were active and did
some things that affected the stu
dents," he said.
The aggrandized number of can
didates will probably contribute to a
good voter turn-out, according to
Election Commissioner Mike
O'Reilly.
Besides the senate polling, voters
will also respond to three referen
dum issues.
Take your pick
The omnipresent mascot referen
dum will pit the Griffons, the Trees
and the Cardinal against each other.
The second referendum consists
of several proposals for senate elec
tion reform, including senate dis
tricting, live petitions and staggered
elections.
The districting concept, which
succumbed to procedural con
troversy last spring, would require a
future candidate to seek election in
only one district of his choice to rep
resent that district should he win.
Undergraduate precincts would be
determined by residential bound
aries while graduate sectors would
be based on departmental affiliation.
Proponents of this bill claim that
districting would promote senate
communication and accountability,

but critics argue that it would dis
criminate against minorities and spe
cial interest groups.
Elections are not dead
The live petition measure, origi
nally recommended by the 1977-78
Election Review Board (ERB), would
allow potential senators to collect a
sufficient number of student signa
tures on petitions to earn senate
membership.
The ERB suggested that this system
would overcome student voting
apathy by, in effect, "bringing the
polling booth out to the students."
One con stand alleges that live peti
tions would lead to a proliferation of
senate positions and make member
ship too easy to obtain.
The staggered elections choice
was advocated by last year's Senate
Rules Committee to hold elections in
both spring and autumn quarters.
Supporters observe that a sense of
continuity would arise from this bill.
Measure of last resort
The fourth and final reform bill
mandates no change in current se
nate election practices.
The third referendum solicits stu
dent opinion on the necessity of
lighted tennis courts on campus.
Two fee assessment requests will
also appear on the ballot to be vali
dated by a 50 percent favorable vote
from a turn-out of at least 20 percent
of the student body.
The Women's Center is seeking
funds to equip a new office and to
provide more activities and services
on women's issues.
The Band is asking for an extra
one-quarter fee assessment to fi
nance next year's Band trip to Boston
College.
Voting will be conducted in a
manner similar to last year's. Nine
polling places, manned by three to
four poll watchers, will function ac
ross campus at staggered hours bet
ween 9:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. both
today and tomorrow. The ballot will
also be computerized this year.
