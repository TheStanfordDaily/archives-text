San Francisco (AP) — An agree
ment to continue railroad com
mute service between San Fran
cisco and San Jose for at least 10
years was reached by Caltrans and
Southern Pacific yesterday.
A joint announcement noted
that many details were still to be
worked out, but implementation
of the contract would mean that
passengers could keep using the
trains for the 50-mile trip along the
San Francisco Peninsula.

The agreement requires ratifi
cation by various state and local
agencies and approval from the
Interstate Commerce Commis
sion (ICC) and California Public
Utilities Commission.
An ICC administrative law judge
issued a decision several months
ago which would have allowed SP
to discontinue commuter opera
tions in six months. But that deci
sion requires full ICC approval.
In that ruling, the judge said SP

lost $11.6 million on commuter
service in 1977.
The agreement between Cal
trans and SP estimates the 1980
operating loss would be about $10
million, with state and local agen
cies financing the deficit.
Under the agreement, Caltrans
would rent or purchase track rail
cars, locomotives and station
buildings and grounds. No figure
has been set as a purchase price.
