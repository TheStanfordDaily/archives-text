# The 						Bridge offers counseling, help
## 
### Tom Campbell 
Being human means wanting to talk:
about problems, about questions, about
learning. The Bridge at the University is a
comfortable and supportive place to talk
and learn.
Primarily a service community run by
students for students, The Bridge offers
counseling, educational and outreach ser
vices. It also functions as an information
and referral center for various campus and
area "help" programs.
The Bridge occupies a frame house at
f>4o Campus Drive, near the Campus Bike
Shop. Four people are living there now,
providing a nucleus for The Bridge com
munity, which includes those seeking
help or information, the volunteer staf
fers, and anyone who just wants to stop in
and talk. ■
Craig Goldman is a Bridge resident. A
junior in Human Biology, Goldman talked
about the peer counseling program,
where trained student volunteers try to
help the students who come to them with
personal or general problems and ques
tions.
v "Stanford students often feel that they
have to solve all their problems by them
selves," he said. "The Bridge offers an al
ternative to friends or housing associates
(RA) when the person feels those channels
aren't open. Friends often don't know
how to listen, even though they mean
well."
Eloise Crane, a junior and RA in Mir
rielees Hall, explained how peer coun
selors at The Bridge are trained to listen
and help students help themselves. She
and Goldman help teach The Bridge's peer
counseling course.
"Just paying attention, knowing the
right kind of questions to ask, and making
the person feel comfortable are important
to listening," Crane said. "We try to teach
these skills with actual demonstrations
and practice."
A period of training with a peer coun
selor follows for those students who want
to help at The Bridge. All peer counselors
are volunteers, serving anywhere from
three to eight callers per day. Dialogue
ranges from small talk and general "rap
sessions" to relationships in school and
family crises.

The Bridge also reaches out to people
through various educational programs. A
series of workshops covers diverse human
growth topics such as art and architecture
appreciation, massage and body move
ment.
A number of ongoing classes and
groups meet at The Bridge, including a
men's and women's support group which
offers an open, empathetic and supportive
atmosphere for its members to talk about
things they feel a need to express.
Outreach programs in learning massage
and growth games (games to increase
awareness, communication and good
times) are for everyone, especially the
dormitories. Peer counseling directed to
the specific needs of the gay community is
an additional, important source.

The Bridge has been around since the
fall of 1971. Dr. Vincent D'Andrea, its fa
culty sponsor, talked about the changes in
The Bridge over the years.
"Back in the early 70s drug abuse was a
serious problem. A group of eight or ten
students, including RAs, set up a drop-in
center geared toward drug problems, for
which I became consultant," he said.
Meditation and running workshops
were also offered in that early Bridge. Re
formed addicts helped deal with the seri
ous drug problems, including heroin.
Many drug users didn't want to go to the
University Health Service and looked to
The Bridge as an alternative support.
Gradually drugs became less of a prob
lem and The Bridge grew, becoming an
information and referral center for various
social and health agencies on the Penin
sula, and handling larger numbers of tele
phone callers. Counselor training
changed to put more stress on dealing
with personal and emotional problems.

During 1974-75 The Bridge came tc
gether with other campus counseling sei
vices like the Learning Assistance Center
the Career Planning and Placemen
Center, and contraceptive counseling ti
choose a basic training model for thei
counselors.
They chose "microcounseling," a prog
ram developed from the work of Univer
sity of Massachusetts Professor Allen Ivey
This approach breaks listening and coun
seling into definite skills, which after prac
tice are then integrated into the counseloi
role.
Originally a Stanford Workshop Or
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI)
course, peer counseling received accredi
tation through the Learning Assistance
Center during the 1975-76 school year.
Whereas agencies like the Learning As
sistance Center are paraprofessional, tne
Bridge is officially a volunteer student or
ganization. About 10 percent of its money
comes from the University, and the lion's
share from a spring crafts fair held on
Mother's Day weekend. Arts and crafts are
displayed, and food and beverages of
fered. Displayers pay a flat fee to The
Bridge to exhibit, at what is one of the
largest crafts fairs in the South Bay area.
Students support other students at The
Bridge. Dr. D'Andrea noted that
former Bridge staffers keep in touch,
which shows "the real sense of commun
ity" that develops among Bridge volun
teers and students who use it.
"Students have told me that The Bridge
is the most meaningful experience they
had at Stanford," he said.
However, as staffer Peter Salovey notes,
The Bridge may have a stigma for many
students.
"People sometimes think of The Bridge
as it existed in the early 19705, when drugs
were the major concern," he said. People
may also think that only those with severe
emotional problems use The Bridge.
But The Bridge isn't "only" for any
specific group. The Bridge is for everyone
who wants help or has a question that con
cerns them.
The Bridge is a bridge between people
and themselves.
