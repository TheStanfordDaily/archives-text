# Prof re-examines the Korean War
## 
### Chris Heftel 
Armed with over 400 recently
declassified documents, Stan
ford history professor Barton
Bernstein is writing what he calls
a "reinterpretation" of Korean
War History. Bernstein refutes
the traditional belief the
"Communist intransigence"
prolonged fighting until the
armistice in Ju1y,1953. His re
search pinpoints U.S. refusal
to compromise on one issue,
the repatriation of prisoners of
war, as the reason for the
stalemate from May, 1952, until
July, 1953.
According to Bernstein,
those last fifteen months were
especially tragic because not
only were heavy casualties in
curred on both sides, but ex
tensive U.S. bombings killed
countless numbers of North
Korean civilians.
"They ultimately are the real
victims of war, and only now
are we beginning to look at
why this had to happen to
them," Bernstein said last
week, in a colloquium at Stan
ford's Center for East Asian
Studies.
Pushed by an "intellectual
obsession" to find answers to
troubling questions about the
Korean War, Bernstein said he
has worked for the last two and
half years to get documents
declassified. Unlike the Viet

nam War, about which much
information was made public,
he said that ' Korea is the hid
den war" because so much in
formation is unavailable.
'Symbolic victory'
In his presentation last week
Bernstein explained that while
ground fighting was intense in
the last years of the.war, the
battle line never moved far
from the 38th Parallel. For polit
ical and moral reasons Presi
dent Truman and Secretary of
State Acheson wanted a "sym
bolic victory" for the U.N.
forces. Bernstein said this re
sulted in the United States
"making demands unaccepta
ble to the communists, who
were anxious to end the fight
ing.
Concessions made on both
sides resolved most differ
ences by May 1952, and left the
U.S. a chance to salvage a small
"moral victory. Only one is
sue, repatriation of prisoners,
remained.
China and North Korea
wanted an all-for-all exchange
of P.O.W.
. U.S. leaders knew that this
would require forcing some
prisoners to return to their
communist homelands who
did not want to go. According
to Bernstein, Acheson con
vinced Truman to take a strong
public stand that America
would never force prisoners to
repatriate.
Acheson assumed that most
prisoners would choose to re
turn to the communists, mak
ing this arrangement accepta
ble to the Chinese, while
enough prisoners would
choose to remain in South
Korea to allow for the claim of a
great triumph for freedom.
Bernstein said that "while it
may seem illusory and idealis
tic to us today, "leaders at the
timÂ£ believed that this plan
would prevent future Soviet
and Chinese aggression be
cause their armies would de
fect if they knew there would

be no forced repatriation.
Prisoners screened
The U.S. offered a plan of
voluntary repatriation after the
screening of prisoners. They
estimated, and promised tothe
communists, that about
116,000 of 132,000 prisoners
would be returned.
When the screening was
finished American leaders
were shocked: only 70,000
were willing to repatriate. Such
low nuiYibers, embarrassing to
the communists, made settle
ment unlikely.
Afraid to modify their stance,
however, American leaders
reported the results to the
Communists, who were furi
ous, Bernstein said.
Bernstein commented that
the U.S. government had
never taken appropriate steps
to correctly estimate the sc
reening results. They exercised
little control over the screen
ing process itself, which was
mostly handled by South Ko
rean and Nationalistic Chinese
troops.
Neither Truman, nor
Eisenhower, felt, however,
that they could back down
after the U.S. had taken such a
strong public stand for "volun
tary repatriation," he said.
The U.S. further miscalcu
lated when it was decided to
bomb heavily North Korea in
order to "coerce" the com
munists into a settlement. In
stead, Bernstein said, the
bombings only made the
communists more determined
not to be humiliated.
Nevertheless, the com
munists finally agreed to vol
untary repatriation and signed
an armistice in July of 1953. Ul
timately about 82,000 of
132,000 soldiers chose repatria
tion. Bernstein emphasized
that many questions about the
war, including why China re
lented, have not yet been suffi
ciently addressed. Efforts to
declassify documents, he said,
should be continued.
