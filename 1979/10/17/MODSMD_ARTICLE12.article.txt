# Afghanistan troop activity reported

New Delhi, India (AP) â€”
Tanks rolled through the
streets of Kabul and warplanes
struck targets 15 miles south of
the capital city, according to
reports emanating Monday
from Afghanistan.
One theory advanced about
the latest military activity was
that the new government was
preparing for a move against it
by Col. Aslam Watanjar, an in
terior minister in the govern
ment that was overthrown last
month.
But diplomats here said they
were not sure who was in
volved in the latest military ac
tivity or what it meant. The
State Department in
Washington reported the air
strikes but also said it did not
know what forces were in

volved.
Radio Pakistan, monitored
here, quoted Kabul reports as
saying tanks rolled through the
streets of the mile-high city,
where security measures have
been tightened.
"Kabul is calm but tense to
day," the broadcast said.
Afghanistan has been
wracked by anti-government
guerrilla warfare for more than
a year. During that time, vari
ous military units reportedly
have mutinied, against the
pro-Soviet governments.
Watanjar, the former in
terior minister, reportedly has
become one of the regime's
chief toes and is considered
capable of rallying disaffected
army units against Prime-Minis
ter Hafizullah Amin.
