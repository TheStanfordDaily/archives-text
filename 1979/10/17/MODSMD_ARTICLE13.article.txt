# Experts say Cuba issue political, not military

As the political debate continues on the
merits of the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks
(SALT II) treaty, reports of Soviet combat
troops in Cuba have jeopardized chances for
the treaty's ratification in the Senate.
According to Sidney Drell, deputy director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAO, the Soviet Union poses "no direct
military threat in Cuba, since they have no
airlift capability to go anywhere. The crisis is a
political one."
Alexander George, professor of political
science agreed. "Unfortunately, domestic
politics dominates a rational and controlled
foreign policy," he said.
Meanwhile, the political crisis is not yet
over for the Carter Administration.
"There is no way for (President Jimmy) Car
ter to look strong with the Cuban crisis. He
and (Secretary of State Cyrus) Vance made a
critical mistake in saying that the status quo in
Cuba was not acceptable," said Coit Blacker,
assistant director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Program here and a political
science lecturer.
"There is no way that the Russians would
back down, as they did in 1962," he claimed.
Alexander Dallin, professor of history and
political science said he views the present

Cuban controversy as an example of the
"unpredictability of the United States'
foreign policy."
Although he agreed that the Carter Ad
ministration handled the Cuban crisis
amateurishly, George noted that "domestic
politics makes it hard tor any administration
to have a coherent foreign policy.
"At least Carter had the good sense not to
use the Cuban situation to flex American
muscles," he added.
The extent to which the Cuban crisis will
affect the passage of SALT now depends
upon the Senate.
It would be "highly undesirable" to re
negotiate the treaty after seven years of talks,
Drell said.
Instead a possible alternative to Senate
amendments would be to insist upon a "re
servation" attached to the treaty, he con
tinued. Such a reservation would stipulate
that the treaty not go into effect until the
President announced that he was "satisfied
that the Soviet Union's troops in Cuba have
no combat capability.
"Prior to Cuba, the tenor of the SALT de
bate was that it was verifiable," Drell said.
"SALT is not a reward for good Soviet be
havior," he added. "It is a decrease in com
petition, in the national security interest of
both sides."
