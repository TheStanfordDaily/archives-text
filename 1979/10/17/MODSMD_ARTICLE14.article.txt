# Kingscote Gardens: unique collection of faculty, students
## 
### Margaret Lane 
One of the few architectural
anomalies on the University
campus is a small, elegant
apartment building known by
the obscure title of Kingscote
Gardens.
Those few who recall a
glimpse of Kingscote at some
time walking near Lake
Lagunita may vaguely re
member wondering why there
was a building without red tile
roofs here.. -
It is this uniqueness, as well
as a melange of diverse resi
dents, which gives Kingscote

Gardens its separate identity,
an identity commensurate with
its independence from the
University.
Snugly located on Lomita
Drive between Roble Hall and
the Faculty Club, the tradi
tional structure was built in
1917.
Independent from University
The Gardens is a part of the
Reese Evans Howard Estate and
is maintained through a 99year
lease from the University.
Howard, a New York execu
tive, retains control of'the
apartments, which were built

by his grandmother to house
visiting dignitaries on campus.
Linda Foret has managed
Kingscote Gardens with her
husband since July. There are
37 units ranging in price from
$150-$450 per month. Foret
calls the prices reasonable, al
though she said they are "a
long way from the day when
weekly room and board at
Kingscote was $4."
Foret, a former nurse and
mother of five, says she finds it
easy to relate to both the resi
dents of Kingscote and stu
dents at Stanford.

Her. only complaint with
whwi she considers a very de
sirable job is that students here
cannot read; "they park their
cars in front of the 'No Trespas
sing' signs and complain when
towed away.''
Diversity of residents
Foret believes that the diver
sity of Kingscote residents has
helped to maintain its quality.
Kingscote residents include
several undergraduates, long
time residents of 30 and 40
years, and a variety of others.
Nearly all of the residents have
some connection with Stan
ford. For example, there are
current and retired faculty,
graduate students and Univer
sity employees.
Kingscote has held a mul
titude of prominent persons;
the author Vladimir Nabakov,
visiting royalty and foreign
dignitaries and a former editor
of New Republic magazine
have all called Kingscote
home.
The present inhabitants
seem to prove similarly fas
cinating. One resident in his
80s frequently escapes to the
Gardens and composes verses
for the other tenants.
'Extended sort of family'
Dr. John Troxell, a retired
professor of the Graduate
School of Business, has lived at
Kingscote for nine years.

Troxell animatedly describes
Kingscote as "an extended sort
of family, like a dorm on a dif
ferent scale."
Resident Catherine Jones
highly praises the tranquility of
Kingscote within the hubbub
of .campus life. Jones, a former
student and member of the Ita
lian Department, feels that its
advantages lie in providing "as
much or as little student con
tact as one wishes; it's really up
to you."
For those hoping to discover
a sordid past lurking behind
Kingscote's stately exterior,
The Apartment, a novel written
by one-time resident Charles
Beardsley, provides what
Troxell labels "a distorted,
pornographic view of Kings
cote life," referred to by
Beardsley as "The Kumquat
Gardens."
Contact with students
One occupant who actively
encourages contacts with stu
dents is Rumanian -scholar
George Duca, professor of
political Science and history.
Duca, 73, has made Kingscote
his home for a year.
Although he finds the rent "a
little ridiculous," he adamantly
poi nts out the benefits of resid
ing five minutes from Lagunita,
where his freshman advisees
live, and a short distance from
his offices at Hoover Tower.

Duca directs the Rumanian col
lection and display of his own
political and personal memoirs
of sixty .years.
Students in his seminars
bring their friends to visit Duca
at Kingscote frequently, and he
in turn finds their attitudes and
responses "absolutely mov
ing."
Future
Kingscote's future is unclear,
although Foret postulates that
it may someday be given back
to the University.
Meanwhile, however, envi
ous trailer residents and other

victims of the housing shortage
can only enjoy Kingscote's
loveliness from the outside,
unless they are prepared to pay
the rentand keepan apartment
through the summer months.
Since it is distinct from Stan
ford, Kingscote will not even
be found on any university
map. Troxell jokes that
"perhaps Kingscote doesn't
really exist, and is only a mythi
cal Camelot." Yet one can only
leave Kingscote assured of its
existence and appreciative of
the lives within which continue
to enrich life here.
