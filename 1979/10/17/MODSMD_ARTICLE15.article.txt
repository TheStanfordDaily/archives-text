Craft explores third deepest lake on continent

Tahoe City, Calif. (AP) â€” A liny submarine and
its three-man crew emerged Monday from an
exploratory dive into Lake Tahoe atter plunging
at least 400 feet into the icy depths, 200 feet
deeper than anyone has descended into one of
the world's highest, deepest lakes.
University of California lake expert Dr.
Charles Goldman, with the 17-foot-long sub's
pilot and a reporter aboard, explored depths of
600 feet, a quarter mile off Blackwood Creek on
the lake's west shore. The depth was 400 feet
deeper than anyone has ever gone into Lake
Tahoe, one of the world's deepest, highest
bodies of fresh water.
Gordon Barksdale, a pilot of the Pioneer I, said
the craft had minor difficulties with the com
pressed air hookup used tor blowing the ballast
tanks. The dive occurred off Rocky Point, on the
lake's west shore.
The craft will explore, photograph and use a
mechanical arm to pick up objects during a
tour-day, around-the-clock probe with an esti
mated cost of more than $30,000.
Underwater studies
The vessel, armed with high-powered flood

lights and still and video photographic gear,
studied underwater alluvial fans and a sub
merged landslide, officials said.
The crew's two observers are in a prone posi
tion and look ahead through a plexiglass nose,
while the pilot is stationed beneath the hatch
behind them.
The sub entered the lake at 8:45 a.m. PDT and
began its test runs about an hour later. After
testing, a barge began a two-hour tow to take
the sub to the location of the dive.
Goldman said he expected about 50 hours of
diving, noting that for each eight hours under
water, eight more hours were needed to re
charge the sub's batteries.
'Fairest picture'
The lake that Mark Twain called "the fairest
picture the whole world affords" is estimated to
be 1645 feet deep, third deepest in North
America. At 6225 feet above sea level it is the
highest of its size in North America and holds
enough water to cover California to a depth of
14 Vi inches.
