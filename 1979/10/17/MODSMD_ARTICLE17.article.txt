# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Ronald Collins Max, I too am a possibilist 
### 
(The following is an open letter
to syndicated columnist Max
Lerner.)
Dear Max:
I read with interest your
essay in Newsweek magazine
(Oct. 8). It is good to see
someone in this era ot
naysayers willing to "break a
lance in defense of the possi
ble."
Moreover, it is refreshing to
read about the contemporary
American situation described
in terms other than unwar
ranted optimism or unbelieva
ble pessimism.
Like you, "I am a possibilist."
So where do we part com
pany? Our differences center
around our dissimilar under
standings of the realm of the
possible.
Certainly, I agree with you
that the "breakthroughs" of
the last decade or two have im
proved the options of
minorities, women, the aged
and the "code breakers." And
like you, I hold with the "life
affirming" principles that these
breakthroughs symbolize.
But I have reservations abou*
what you mean when you write
that ours is a culture moving
"toward a higher degree of
complexity." Is "complexity"
the end product of a morally,
culturally and humanely de
veloped society?
In one respect, I suspect that
the answer must be "yes." In
deed, you are on the right track
when you describe our civiliza
tion is one "that has not wholly
found itself." But I question
whether it is even looking.
You speak of "change" and
"trade-offs" as it they were so
cial goods in and of them
selves. But such change bor
ders on anarchism, and trade
off conflict resolution of the
kind you describe represents a
sort of quantum jump attitude
in an area where the magic of
physics is inapplicable.
Why is the change being
made? What exactly is it that we
are being asked to trade?
You see, Max, part of our
contemporary problem is our
inability as a society to even ask
these questions in the first in
stance.
Yet to tail to ask such ques
tions is, according to Plato's al
legory of the cave, tantamount
to mistaking shadows for real
ity.
How then can one be a pos
sibilist where inquiry itself has,
owing to our condition, be
come impossible?
How can one be a possibilist
where there is a general refusal
to evaluate our situation by re
ference to any and all criteria?
Let's consider the wide
range of personal and profes

sional options today open to
individuals. You place great
stock in this new day in the
American dream. From that
perspective, I can see what
prompts you to say that
"America today is the world's
most revolutionary culture."
But can we as possibilists
leave it at that? Can we look at
the gains and ignore the result
ing consequences?
I respond, in part, by calling
your attention to some points
made in Raghavan Iyer's new
book Parapolitics (Oxford
1979). Chapter fifteen of that
work is entitled "The Com
munity of Strangers."
Therein Iyer, as I understand
him, speaks not only to the
new triumphs that you
applaud, but more importantly
to the new frustrations that
have resulted.
After our initial triumphs, we
proceeded to forget "the
grander ideal behind the
American experiment."
The ideal of that grander
American goal was lost once
we attained a number of the
secondary goals. In lyers'
words, "The original impulse
became obscured or was per
verted."
And so where does this leave
us as possibilists?
True, we have new options,
but we also have new problems
— problems too many of us are
ignoring. Those problems, of
course, redefine the realm of
the possible.
What exactly, after all, is
possible where the social glue
that holds a community to
gether is no longer visible or
even valued?
What options does an indi
vidual really have in a commun
ity of strangers?
Or put another way, is it sen
sible to talk about notions like
the common good at a time
when the individual rights con
siderations occur in the ab
sence of any thought of human
obligations?
I have touched upon what
Solzhenitsyn calls the "calam
ity of an autonomous con
sciousness" in order to give a
more complete picture of the
nature of the changes you refer
to and thereby to case some
new light on just what is availa
ble to us by way of "trade
offs."
Viewed that way, I fear that it
may prove more confusing
than enlightening to think of
the body politic in terms of de
grees of complexity.
It seems more appropriate to
speak of the social organism
(as Simone Weil and others
have) in terms of a biology of
equilibrium. That strikes me as

a higher "life-affirming" prin
ciple.
In the end, Max, I too believe
in the "manifesto of the pos
sibilist." But if America is ever
again to be a truly great and
revolutionary culture, it must
first reckon with its new politi
cal problems.
It cannot afford to be unduly
optimistic about the signifi
cance of its new options.
On that score, remember
Willa Cather's advice —
"Coraggio, Americano!"
