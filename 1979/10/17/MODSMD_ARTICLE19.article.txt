## Choice, not abortion, is why we fight 
### 
The other day, while at Cowell, I
noticed a rather anxious looking
woman carrying a paper bag. She
, walked briskly into the lab, mumbled
something about "morning speci
men," and retreated quickly. As a pro
choice advocate-and contraceptive
counselor, I recognized the situation all
too well.
About 60 Stanford women this year
will have to deal with an unplanned,
unwanted pregnancy. Except for
perhaps one or two, these pregnancies
will end in safe, legal abortion, allow
ing the woman to continue her life as
planned, to continue her academic
pursuits and caTeer.
Fortunately, the prospect of having
to drop out of school (perhaps perma
nently) to deal with the realities of
motherhood when unprepared and
unwilling, to settle for a life of possible
frustration and resentment is not the
only option (as it once was).
Stanford women have the freedom to
choose abortion, the freedom to con
trol their lives. But we cannot take this
112 reedom to choose for granted, for it has
been a long, difficult struggle that con
tinues today.
Historically, American women have
had a keen interest in birth control and
abortion. Women were dying early
deaths due to the physical exhaustion

of giving birth 10 or 15 times, or dying in
childbirth or complications relating to
it.
When Margaret Sanger opened the
doors of her birth control clinics in the
19205, she was inundated by desperate,
pleading women asking for "The Sec
ret." Women did everything they could
to prevent pregnancy and childbirth,
including self abortion. And many died,
for many years.
In 1973, the Supreme Court legalized
abortion, leaving the decision to termi
nate a pregnancy up to the woman.
Since then, there have been restric
tions, funding cutbacks, and the
never-ending threat of losing the right
to choose altogether.
The anti-choice movement is well
funded, well organized and part of a
conservative backlash present in
American politics today. For that
reason, our right of abortion has re
mained tenuous, and is being
threatened.
The pro-choice movement realizes
abortion is a reality of life. If abortion is
not legal, women will obtain illegal
abortions. Countless women have died
or have had serious injuries due to
botched, illegal abortions.
Even now, when in principle, abor
tion is accessible to all women, in fact, it
is not. Restricted federal funds forabor
tion means poor women must choose

between an illegal abortion or another
unwanted pregnancy.
At this very moment, the House
wants to restrict the Hyde amendment
even further to allow federal funds only
when the woman's life is in danger.
Funds would not even be available for
women who become pregnant due to
acts of rape or incest (as they are pre
sently).
Pro-choice does not advocate man
datory abortion, but opposes mandat
ory pregnancy. We do not propose
abortion as a standard method of birth
control, but ratheras a backup method.
Contraceptive methods fail, no
method (not even the pill) is 100 per
cent effective. Also, contraceptives are
not easily accessible to all sexually ac
tive groups.
Even when all forms of contraception
are available (this means widely distri
buted and hopefully free), the fact re
mains, they are intrinsically fallible. â– 
Pro-choice believes sex education is
instrumental in reducingthe numberof
unwanted pregnancies, especially
among adolescents. Until birth control
information is widely distributed in
schools and adolescent clinics, teena
gers will continue to beconqe pregnant.
A family planning program must in
clude education and birth control as
well as abortion as backup.
Pro-choice is involved in all levels of

family planning, not just "ex post facto"
methods. We want to reduce the
number of unwanted pregnancies, as
well as unwanted children.
The pro-choice movement is a
humanistic one. We seek to improve
the quality of life for both men and
women. Instead of clinging to the mor
als and beliefs of the "good olc- days"
that have long since lost their useful
ness, we are realists.
We see present problems_and in
stead of blaming and moralizing, we
seek to solve. We feel every person has
the right to personal development and
should not be "fated" into premature
parenthood.
Stanford people are bright, moti
vated, and I hope, concerned. Realize
that some of you (or someone you care
about) will be anxiously awaiting test
results, like the woman I mentioned
earlier. Maybe this year, maybe the
next.
Realize that women have died; and
men and women have fought together
for reproductive rights. Realize that the
fight continues and your concern, sup
port and awareness are needed. Fight
to keep abortion safe and legal.
