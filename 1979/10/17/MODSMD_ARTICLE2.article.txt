# Test declared unfair to minority students
## IQ tests held unconstitutional

San Francisco — IQ tests which
lead to the placement of an unusually
large number of black youngsters in
so-called mentally retarded classes
were ruled unconstitutional by a
federal judge yesterday.
Chief U.S. District ludge Robert
Peckham, ruling in a statewide class
action suit filed in 1971 on behalf of
five black youngsters, said the use of
standardized IQ tests to place chil
dren in educable mentally retarded
(EMR) classes violated recently
enacted federal laws and state and
federal constitutions.
The judge said evidence showed
IQ tests were developed on white
populations and not adjusted or
even re-examined when it became
clear that certain groups — notably
blacks and Hispanics — received low
scores.
The decision ordered the continu
ation of a ban on IQ testing for
placement of black children into
educable mentally retarded (EMR)
classes.
Tests 'unbiased'?
Prof. Richard Snow of the Depart
ment of Education here protested
yesterday's ruling, calling the IQ
tests "relatively unbiased.
"The tests are relatively good in
struments for purposes of measuring
mental abilities," Snow said.
But, they are fallible, he added,
both in themselves and in the hands

of the user.
"There are uses and misuses of the
test," he said.
Snow, who researches individual
differences in learning and cognitive
abilities, uses the IQ tests to measure
the mental abilities of his subjects.
Diagnosis
"Our research is aiming at a more
diagnostic way to measure such
abilities," he said. "Anything we
come up with, however, will still be
some kind of a mental test."
Snow said that while it is true that

Stanford prof argues:
'The tests are relatively
unbiased/

blacks and other minorities can be
found to have lower scores on the
average on the test, cultural bias is
not a significant factor on some !Q
tests.
"The education system is pressed
into a damned if you do, damned if
you don't' situation as far as using
these tests to determine whether a
student should entera special educa
tion class," he said.
Dilemma
"On one hand, if you don't assign
the child to special education, he is
deprived of that opportunity and left

to the standard system where he
might not benefit as much. And if
you do enroll him in such a class, you
are accused of not giving him fair
treatment."
A year after the class action suit
was filed in 1971, Peckham ruled that
no black children in San Francisco
could be placed in EMR classes based
on IQ test results. He expanded the
order to the rest of the state in 1974.
Peckham's decision ordered the
state to retest youngsters now as
signed to the special classes.
Conditions set
He also ordered the state to take a
number of steps and receive court
approval before allowing the use of
standardized intelligence tests.
In his decision, Peckham said the
history of IQ tests and special educa
tion in California "revealed an un
lawful discriminatory intent . . . The

intent was not necessarily to hurt
black children, but it was an intent to
assign a grossly disproportionate
number of black children to the spe
cial, inferior and dead-end EMR clas
ses."
Low chance
Peckham said the high number of
blacks enrolled in EMR classes has
less than one-in-a-million chance of
happening by a color-blind system of
assignment."
The classes concentrate on physi
cal hygiene, grooming and social ad
justment rather than academic skills.
In 20 California school districts
which accounted for 80 percent of
the enrollment of black children in
1974-75, blacks comprised only 27.5
percent of the student population
but 62 percent of the EMR enroll
ment, the judge said.
