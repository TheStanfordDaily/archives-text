Sexism is big deal
After recovering from my in
credulous shock on reading
Dan Rath's letter (Daily, Oct.
12), I felt grateful to him for
exposing the attitude so many
feminists — men and women
—- are fighting against.
Rath, if serious, does not
seem to really understand what
sexism means and what its im
plications are. The Dos Equis
poster is sexist because it
exploits women's sexuality; it
lets women's bodies do the sel
•ing.
Women's history is full of'
this exploitation: women sel
ling their bodies as the only
means of making money,
women owned as property by
their husbands, women raped
and battered without respect
for their safety or feelings.
It is the desire of men to have
power over women and reduce
them to sexual objects that is at
the root of these incidents.
The poster is a "crime
against women" when at
titudes such as Rath has de
monstrated get out of control,
and lead to rape, battery and
other degradation of women's
status.
Why does Rath feel so
threatened, "teased?" I be
lieve it's due to the whole sex
role conditioning we all un
dergo. Women get messages,
especiaNy from the media (in
ads like the Dos Equis poster)
that to be acceptable, they
must be traditionally feminine:
innocent but seductive; pas
sive, yet attractive.
Men learn to be aggressive
and macho, to respond to
women with the prowess of
"animal instincts" (as Rath im
plies). So when women dress
scantily — which men do just
as much — a different value is
placed on 'their bodies and
beauty than on men's; men are
urged to possess them, to
"score" on them.
However, most women don't
want to be possessed when it
gets down to a question of
self-confidence and self
image. Women deserve to be
respected as other than ob
jects: as intelligent, thinking
people.
This is true for men, too,
who do not deserve to have
their feelings and vulnerability
hardened by the need to be
fnacho. We are not merely
animals, and I expect most
people in a university to know

that already.
I support the Daily's con
demnation of the ad. And I
suggest that Dan Rath read the
article by Charlie Burns (Daily,
Oct. 8) in which Burns discus
ses what it's like to be a
feminist man.
Granted, it's a struggle to
change deep-rooted attitudes,
but the safety and integrity of
all women are at stake.

Indians opposed
At our Board Meeting on Oc
tober 9, Hillel, the Jewish
Students' Organization, de
cided to oppose the adoption
of the Indian as the mascot for
Stanford's sports teams.
We are appalled by the in
sensitivity of the people sup
porting the Indian as mascot;
and as a cultural and religious
organization we fully sym
pathize with the native Ameri
cans' opposition to their adop
tion as a mascot.
As the most persecuted
group in American history, the
native Americans certainly do
not deserve this additional slap
in the face by way of a carica
ture of their culture.
Since the choice of mascot is
such a trivial issue, the native
Americans'opposition to their
adoption as mascot should be
an adequate incentive to end
the discussion.
However, it is obvious from
the reactions of the fans and
from the content of certain let
ters to the Daily that further
explanation is necessary.
The native Americans' cul
tural and religious rituals were
not designed with football in
mind. It is a prostitution of
their original purpose to pre
sent them at a football game.
Additionally, it is sacreligi
ous. An analagous situation
would be a team called the
Stanford Catholics with a cari
cature of the Pope giving
communion and salvation to
the Stanford players — and
damning the opposition.
We encourage the administ
ration to make a final decision
after the student vote today.
With the support of the stu
dents, this decision should lay
the mascot issue to rest.

Castro no dictator
I was shocked, dismayed and
downright embarrassed when
you referred to Fidel Castro as
a "dictator" in your Oct. 12 AP
article describing the Cuban
leader's arrival in New York
City.
I hope you realize that Cas
tro is probably the most re
spected and inspired of all
Third World (or First World for
that matter) political leaders.
He has come to this country
in order to give a speech to the
United Nations as representa
tive of the non-alligned na
tions.
To call him a dictator is not
merely an injurious insult to
socialism, but is a slap in the
face to all the Third World
countries that have chosen him
as representative spokesman
of their interests.
I can only hope that you
printed the word dictator out
of carelessness just as you did
the distasteful, sexist Dos Equis
advertisement.
But please wake up and rec
ognize your responsibilities.
Until the press in this coun
try begins to take its role a bit
more seriously, how can we
expect consciousness to be
raised.
I am assuming that you do
realize that communism is not
an ogre that sucks the blood of
little children and by the same
token, that you do not treat
women as degraded sex ob
jects.

$3 million tuition
The shock waves from my
bouncing tuition check mea
sured a 4.0 on the Richter scale
at my Chicago bank last week.
Though no serious damage oc
curred, the vibrations caused a
mild disturbance in my subur
ban home.
With the price of gold soar
ing to new highs and my
stomach sinking to new lows, I
felt it was now the time to take
appropriate action against in
flation.
Faster than one could say
"Federal Reserve Board
monetary policy," I reached
for my trusty calculator.
Computing this year's tui
tion, room and board at a de
vastating $7620-, I set out to cal
culate how much a Stanford

senior could expect to pay for
his or her first child's freshman
year at Stanford 22 years from
now — in the year 2001.
At the current 13 percent an
nual inflation rate, one year's
costs for tuition, room and
board will amount to
$112,119.39. Yes, and that
doesn't even include books.
If you wished your child to
make a symbolic protest of this
obscene fee, perhaps by hav
ing him pay one quarter's tui
tion in pennies, plan on having
a forklift and crane handy. The
pennies will weigh over 12
tons.
Paying in dollar bills may
prevent a double hernia, but it
will still take the cashier three
working days to count and stuff
those greenbacks.
Dating may be a tad expen
sive for your children, too. As
suming the OPEC decided not
to raise oil prices above infla
tion rates (an unlikely assump
tion seeing that oil prices rose
over 60 percent this year), a
tankful of gas will only cost
about $300.
A dinner for two at
McDonald's comes to a
"change back from your
hundred" $58.85. Two tickets
at the Palo Alto Square theatres
will cost just slightly over $100,
a medium sized popcorn $11
and a nickel candy bar (that
cost 25 cents in 1979) $3.67.
A hashing job paying $46.24
an hourwill help Mom and Dad
and child pay for some of this.
Of course,upon graduation in
2005 your child might find a job
with a starting salary of

$359,857.69, the equivalent to
$15,000 in 1979.
But as soon as he's paid off
his debts he will have to start
saving for his children's Stan
ford education. By2o3otuition,
room and board will be
$3,881,106.75 a year.
Is that too much? Well, ifyou
would prefer to opt out of this
rat-race you will not do too
poorly. In 2030 the poverty line
will be hovering around
$3,300,000 a year.
So, you may'ask, what is my
strategy to hedge against these
ominous effects of inflation?
I'm having my teeth filled this
week. At $400 an ounce who
can pass up the bargain?

Gripes, no action
As long as people would
rather gripe than take action,
Mike Charlson (Daily, Oct. 16)
is right in saying the Senate
sucks.
Anybody can rag on the Se
nate. Everybody rags on the
Senate. But how many of the
critics ever do anything about
it?
It doesn't take a magic wand
to change the Senate. It takes
average students who care
enough to talk with senators,
,the Council of Presidents, and
get on senate committees.
If you want to gripe about
the senate, senators will listen.
But show them what you've
done first.
