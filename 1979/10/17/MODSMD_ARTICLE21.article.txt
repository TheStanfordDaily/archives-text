# Students meet to support Kennedy
## 
### 
Law School Prof. William
Could, featured speaker
last week at a kick-off rally
for students favoring Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
for president, called Ken
nedy the Democrat most
likely to be elected.
Could, a specialist in
labor and employment dis
crimination law, served as
labor relations adviser for
Robert Kennedy during the
1968 presidential primary.
Speaking last week to a
group of 50 students, Gould
said he considered Kennedy
"the most qualified"
and the only Democrat who
could win.
"In 1980 it's vitally impor
tant that the Democrats
hold the White House,"
said Could. "And I don't be
lieve that there is a Democ
rat who can, other than Sen.
Kennedy."
Gould described the
prospect of. Ronald Reagan
or John Connally being
elected to the presiden
cy "a very extraordinary,
surprising and dangerous
possibility."
And he caHed Gov. Jerry
Brown an opportunist "wh
ose antics I think are
bizarre" and whose election
is "extremely unlikely."
Although he commended
President )immy Carter for
his "very good record, par
ticularly in the area of
foreign policy," he said that
issues related to economics
and energy have "simply

overwhelmed" the presi
dent.
Carter has lost the credi
bility that Kennedy now
commands in dealing with
Congress and promoting is
sues with the public, Gould
said. He compared Ken
nedy's ability to inspire con
fidence and to speak clearly
and frankly with that of
Franklin Roosevelt.
"Kennedy commands a
measure of respect and con
fidence from foreign lead
ers," he added.
Gould said he thought
Kennedy would do a better
job enforcing the civil rights
acts, something Carter has
not done as "enthusiasti
cally" as he implied in his
campaign. "I think that he
can, as his brothers could,
unite the races, unite blacks
and whites," he added.
When questioned about
Kennedy's involvement
with the Chappaquidick ac
cident several years ago,
Could replied,"There's no
excuse or adequate defense
for Chappaquidick. What
Sen. Kennedy did there was
inherently wrong and im
moral."
On the other hand,
Chappaquidick should be
viewed as only one evening
of an individual's entire
lifetime, he said.
"I think that his life and
record must be judged in
context," Gould said. "The
intent is going to be to focus
upon this to the exclusion of
other issues."
