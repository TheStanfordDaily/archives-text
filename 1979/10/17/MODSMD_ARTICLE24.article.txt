## Intercepting a knee with my eye 
### 
Chris Haft

Ah, intramural sports are with us
again. You can tell as you see T-shirted
groups of a half-dozen or so cross
Campus Drive on their way to the IM
football fields. You can tell as you pass
trios of sweaty gentlemen bedecked in
Converse All-Stars. You can tell as your
friends, slightly soiled and breathless,
return to your living place gushing
about their great victory or mumbling
about the jerks on the other (winning)
team.
I can tell as I look in the mirror, stare
at my black-and-blue left eye and touch
the painful scar hidden by my left eyeb
row.
Last Wednesday afternoon I and sev
eral co-habitants departed for the lush
IM playingfields tocompetein B league
football.
Since we arrived a half-hour before
the game, we had time to run through
passing drills. Our quarterback, a small
but powerful fellow, obviously thought
his receivers were a combination of Ken
Margerum, johnny Bench and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, for he insisted on throw
ing the ball high and hard.
Our signal-caller was oblivious to our
importunings and screams of anguish,
so we tried confessing that we had to
attend an important lecture on the Wit
and Wisdom of Adolf Hitler.
Fortunately, the game began. We
lined up against a team that billed itself
as "Physics," and proceeded to play un
inspiring football. Two-yard runs and
incomplete passes were the rule. The
referee contracted a severe case of nar
colepsy as a result, and had to be re
placed.
As the end of the first half ap
proached, I felt starved for action, since
the ball had not come near me on of
fense or defense. I started to have delu
sions of breaking this 0-0 tie with a leap
ing catch in the end zone or a 60-yard

interception return.
The ball was snapped, thus snapping
me out of my reverie. A receiver, a de
fender and the ball came toward me in
my cornerback position. Sensing my
chance, I hurled myself forward for the
low throw in an effort to intercept it.
What I did intercept was a solid part
of someone's body — an elbow or
knee, perhaps — with my eye. I went
down, painfully clutching my head but
knowing that the ache would soon sub
side, as aches often do.
My hand felt wet. Cosh, I thought,
was I sweating that much? I looked at
my hand and was surprised to see that
my sweat had turned red. "Ha-ha," I
said, meaning, "You fool."
I wasbleeding profusely from a gash
in my left eyebrow. My teammates
crowded around me, regarding me as
they would a fetal pig in high school
biology class.
Meanwhile, I was waiting for some
body to get me a Band-Aid so I could
play again in the second half. Then
somebody said something about
stitches.
"Stitches?" I exclaimed. "Bullshit!"
My pre-med teammates, however, as
sured me that no matter how I com
plained, my eyebrow would have to be
sewn back together. "Well, maybe I
won't be playing in the second half," I
mused.
A Good Samaritan whisked me to
Cowell, where I was immediately pre
pared for surgery. "This hydrogen
peroxide will bubble and fizz," warned
the nurse who cleaned my wound. "I
know. I used to work in an animal hos
pital," I replied.
The doctor who performed the quilt
ing bee on my eyebrow appeared be
mused, even though I probably kept
him from his golf game. "You should
have worn your face mask," he joked.

I left Cowell wearing a shiner and
seven stitches. Upon returning home,
my happy teammates informed me that
once I left, their offense began func
tioning magnificently, giving us a 19-6
victory. Boy, did I feel good.
An hour later I had to interview head
football coach Rod Dowhower for a
Daily story. The bruise above my eye, I
suppose, made me look at home in the
football office, but my slight build did
not.
Eventually Dowhower strode in, and I
started asking him questions about the
upcoming USC game. Midway through
my questioning, I noticed a dark
shadow out of the corner ot my eye. I
reached up, and my fingers met blood
oozing from the cut.
"Yecch!" I said, or something to that
effect. Dowhower, looking at me as if I
were a creature from Star Wars, asked
me what was the matter and would I
please stop bleeding all over the game
plan. I told him about that afternoon's
gridiron exploits, hurriedly finished the
interview and rushed back home.
Evidently my eyebrow was trying to
prevent me from writing my story, for
after I left the football office, the bleed
ing stopped.
I spent the rest of the week answer
ing questions about what fight had I
been in and why my girlfriend hated
me. All I could say was 1) had I been in a
fight, I would have been worse off, and
2) I don't even have a girlfriend to incur
the wrath of.
Monday I went to Cowell to have my
stitches removed. "Can I I asked
the nurse, meaning, can I play football,
basketball, tennis and ice hockey with
the Philadelphia Flyers.
She gave me the 0.K., and therefore I
will return to the verdant lawns of the
IM football fields today. If I don't watch
out, I'll probably be sent back to Cowell.

my questioning, I noticed a dark
shadow out of the corner ot my eye. I
reached up, and my fingers met blood
oozing from the cut.
"Yecch!" I said, or something to that
effect. Dowhower, looking at me as if I
were a creature from Star Wars, asked
me what was the matter and would I
please stop bleeding all over the game
plan. I told him about that afternoon's
gridiron exploits, hurriedly finished the
interview and rushed back home.
Evidently my eyebrow was trying to
prevent me from writing my story, for
after I left the football office, the bleed
ing stopped.
I spent the rest of the week answer
ing questions about what fight had I
been in and why my girlfriend hated
me. All I could say was 1) had I been in a
fight, I would have been worse off, and
2) I don't even have a girlfriend to incur
the wrath of.
Monday I went to Cowell to have my
stitches removed. "Can I I asked
the nurse, meaning, can I play football,
basketball, tennis and ice hockey with
the Philadelphia Flyers.
She gave me the 0.K., and therefore I
will return to the verdant lawns of the
IM football fields today. If I don't watch
out, I'll probably be sent back to Cowell.

Ah, intramural sports are with us
again. You can tell as you see T-shirted
groups of a half-dozen or so cross
Campus Drive on their way to the IM
football fields. You can tell as you pass
trios of sweaty gentlemen bedecked in
Converse All-Stars. You can tell as your
friends, slightly soiled and breathless,
return to your living place gushing
about their great victory or mumbling
about the jerks on the other (winning)
team.
I can tell as I look in the mirror, stare
at my black-and-blue left eye and touch
the painful scar hidden by my left eyeb
row.
Last Wednesday afternoon I and sev
eral co-habitants departed for the lush
IM playingfields tocompetein B league
football.
Since we arrived a half-hour before
the game, we had time to run through
passing drills. Our quarterback, a small
but powerful fellow, obviously thought
his receivers were a combination of Ken
Margerum, johnny Bench and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, for he insisted on throw
ing the ball high and hard.
Our signal-caller was oblivious to our
importunings and screams of anguish,
so we tried confessing that we had to
attend an important lecture on the Wit
and Wisdom of Adolf Hitler.
Fortunately, the game began. We
lined up against a team that billed itself
as "Physics," and proceeded to play un
inspiring football. Two-yard runs and
incomplete passes were the rule. The
referee contracted a severe case of nar
colepsy as a result, and had to be re
placed.
As the end of the first half ap
proached, I felt starved for action, since
the ball had not come near me on of
fense or defense. I started to have delu
sions of breaking this 0-0 tie with a leap
ing catch in the end zone or a 60-yard

interception return.
The ball was snapped, thus snapping
me out of my reverie. A receiver, a de
fender and the ball came toward me in
my cornerback position. Sensing my
chance, I hurled myself forward for the
low throw in an effort to intercept it.
What I did intercept was a solid part
of someone's body — an elbow or
knee, perhaps — with my eye. I went
down, painfully clutching my head but
knowing that the ache would soon sub
side, as aches often do.
My hand felt wet. Cosh, I thought,
was I sweating that much? I looked at
my hand and was surprised to see that
my sweat had turned red. "Ha-ha," I
said, meaning, "You fool."
I wasbleeding profusely from a gash
in my left eyebrow. My teammates
crowded around me, regarding me as
they would a fetal pig in high school
biology class.
Meanwhile, I was waiting for some
body to get me a Band-Aid so I could
play again in the second half. Then
somebody said something about
stitches.
"Stitches?" I exclaimed. "Bullshit!"
My pre-med teammates, however, as
sured me that no matter how I com
plained, my eyebrow would have to be
sewn back together. "Well, maybe I
won't be playing in the second half," I
mused.
A Good Samaritan whisked me to
Cowell, where I was immediately pre
pared for surgery. "This hydrogen
peroxide will bubble and fizz," warned
the nurse who cleaned my wound. "I
know. I used to work in an animal hos
pital," I replied.
The doctor who performed the quilt
ing bee on my eyebrow appeared be
mused, even though I probably kept
him from his golf game. "You should
have worn your face mask," he joked.

I left Cowell wearing a shiner and
seven stitches. Upon returning home,
my happy teammates informed me that
once I left, their offense began func
tioning magnificently, giving us a 19-6
victory. Boy, did I feel good.
An hour later I had to interview head
football coach Rod Dowhower for a
Daily story. The bruise above my eye, I
suppose, made me look at home in the
football office, but my slight build did
not.
Eventually Dowhower strode in, and I
started asking him questions about the
upcoming USC game. Midway through
my questioning, I noticed a dark
shadow out of the corner ot my eye. I
reached up, and my fingers met blood
oozing from the cut.
