# Bus shut out Orioles on seven hits
## 
### 
Baltimore (AP) — Dave
Parker and Willie Stargell, the
power part of Pittsburgh's
lineup, drove in a pair of
seventh-inning runs to ignite
the Pirates attack as they tied
the 1979 World Series at three
games apiece by defeating Bal
timore 4-0 in last night's sixth
game.
It was the second straight
victory for the Pirates and
forced the Series to a decisive
seventh game tonight. Scott
McGregor, the winner in Game
Three, will pitch for the Balti
more Orioles — possibly
against Jim Bibby, who started
Game Four but was not in
volved in the decision for
Pittsburgh.
Left-hander John Candelaria
and bullpen ace Kent Tekulve
combined for the seven-hit
shutout — the first of the Series
as Pittsburgh kept its
chances going to become the

fourth team to recover trom a
3-1 deficit and win best-of
seven Series.
Since scoring six runs in the
eighth inning of Came Four,
the Orioles have fallen into a
dreadful slump, managing just
one run in 19 innings. Their
slumbering bats proved fatal to
starter )im Palmer, who
pitched a creditable game,
matching Candelaria's shutout
through the first six innings.
Candelaria, who has been
troubled by back and rib cage
injuries, was lifted for pinch
hitter Lee Lacy leading off the
seventh as the Pirates sought to
get something going against
Palmer. But Lacy struck out as a
capacity Memorial Stadium
crowd of 53,739 roared its ap
proval.
Speedy Omar Moreno,
criticized for his poor hitting in
earlier games, drilled the sec
ond of his three singles on the

night to right field. Then, on a
hit-and-run play, Tim Foli
bounced a ball up the middle.
Orioles shortstop Kiko Garcia
tried to field the ball and keep
his foot on the base for the
force play on Moreno. But he
succeeded in neither, and the
ball squirted through for a
single.
That set the Pirates' table
with big guns Parker and
Stargell coming up. In the first
inning, Palmer had escaped a
similar jam against the same
two hitters. This time, how
ever, he didn't get away.
Parker, who carried a .429
Series hitting average into this
game, drilled a single past sec
ond baseman Rich Dauer, scor
ing Moreno with the game's
first run and sending Foli
scamperingtothird. A moment
later, Stargell got the second
run home with a sacrifice fly to
left field.

Finally in front, Pittsburgh
went to the ace of its bullpen,
the lanky, bespectacled
Tekulve. He had been ripped
in Game Four — the victim of
the bulk of that big Baltimore
six-run rally. This time, it was a
different story as he mowed
the Orioles down easily, allow
ing one hit the final three in
nings.
The Pirates doubled their
lead in the eighth. Ed Ott
opened with a single and
dashed to third on Phil
Garner's ground-rule double
that bounced into the left field
stands.
Bill Robinson, who had
come into the game in a defen
sive shift in the seventh, fol
lowed with another sacrifice fly
to left, and then Moreno, who
had left 11 men on base in the
first two games of the Series,
delivered an RBI single, mak
ing it 4-0.
