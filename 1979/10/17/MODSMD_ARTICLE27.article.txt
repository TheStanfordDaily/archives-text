tinued this weekend with a
double-header victory over
UC-Davis, 5-1, and
Washington Slate University,
2-1. These conquests bring the
scotchers' record to 8-1.
Stanford dominated Satur
day morning's game against
Davis, taking 36 shots on goal
as opposed to Davis's one.
Three of the goals were scored
by Kelly Westerwick, while
Nancy White and Becky Howell
were responsible for the other
two points scored.
Team members were
pleased with the morning's
match. Said lenine Valdez, "It
was a little slow in the first half;
we weren't connecting. But the
second half was beautiful, per
fect hockey."
"We played smooth hockey;
it felt good to play that well,"
Julia Johnson said'.
And White's comments

praising the new field setup —
running lengthwise instead of
across — seemed to reflect the
whole team's attitude on the
new organization. "The field
made a difference," White
said. "It seemed like there was
a tremendous amount of
space. We were able to make
some great combinations."
The morning's match with
Davis was tiring, though, and
Washington State was able to
put a goal in during (he first

three minutes of Saturday af
ternoon's confrontation.
Nonetheless, the scotchers
came back.
White scored both Cardinal
goals on a penalty stroke and a
corner-play drive.
It was a real effort for the
scotchers to take Washington,
but consistently good hockey,
particulaly from Johnson and
co-captain Nancy jackson,
made the match a successful
one for Stanford.
