# S.F. State upsets up-and-down Stanford

San Francisco — Despite dif
fering in many aspects, Stan
ford's football and soccer
programs share a perplexing
trait — that of playing up for
the big games while tending to
overlook those matches falling
in between. The Cardinals
found themselves at an "in be

tween" on their biorhythm
chart yesterday, hitting a valley
on their recent roller coaster
ride as they dropped a 2-1 over
time decision to San Francisco
State.
Following wins over Fresno
Pacific and the alumni, the
team started the pendulum

routine — losing to Hayward
State 2-1 then turning around
to blank Sacramento State 3-0
and upset San )ose State 2-1.
On a smaller scale, yester
day's events mirrored the same
pattern, with the afternoon
starting on a high note — Stan
ford was rated fourth in the
West, highest showing ever in
the regional poll. Later in The
City's Balboa Stadium, the
Cards found themselves
struggling through a scoreless
first half with the Gators.
Stanford worked its way up
to another peak when Willie
Guicci was tripped up in the
San Francisco goal area and
Dan McNevin put in the ensu
ing penalty shot, giving the
Cards a 1-0 margin 25 minutes
in to the second half. At that
point, it appeared that victory
could be snatched from the
jaws of the Gators.

A dozen minutes later, the
outlook, much like the
weather had changed — from
fair to foggy- Nakul Reddy, as
sisted by Mike Palu, put in a
shot with eight minutes re
maining in regulation play.
Reddy put the game away for
San Francisco, this time with an
assist by Scott Talbot, halfway
through the first overtime
periou.
The symptoms of the Card
patient are visible — a lack of
the hustle and communicated
intensity that shut down the
Spartans for much of last
Saturday's game. The condi
tions are not fatal. "Let's be
realistic," said head coach Nel
son Lodge, "it's only two los
ses." But the cure to avoid
overlooking the less-than
powerful teams is elusive and
requires some experimenta
tion.

Following the San Francisco
game, Lodge outlined some
possible changes. Instead of
Lodge cautioning the Cards
about future opponents,
which resulted in somewhat
apprehensive play, he will try
to emphasize building self
confidence, hopefully en
couraging bolder play which
naturally arises in the big
games but is absent in others.
Aside from the new attitude
approach, Lodge is also mak
ing some formation switches,
putting Cuicci at midfield and
Laird Cagan up in the front
line.
Stanford will put these
changes to the test and its 9-2-1
mark on the line Saturday
when Fresno State arrives for a
10 a.m. match-up. The game
with Cal State-Fullerton, previ
ously scheduled for tomorrow
afternoon,has been canceled.

Senior co-captain Greg Delgado lights for control of the ball during
yesterday's 2-1 loss to unheralded San Francisco State. Delgado, who
mans the sweeper position, is said to handle a broom better than
anyone else on the team.
