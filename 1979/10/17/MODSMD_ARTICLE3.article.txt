### 
Stockholm (AP) â€” An American and
a West Indian who teaches in the Un
ited States were jointly awarded the
1979 Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Science yesterday for their
work to improve economic and
"human" conditions, including wo
men's liberation, in the Third World.
The award, which carries a cash
prize of $190,000, was the fifth this
year received by Americans, who
have captured the lion's share of 1979
prizes as in past years. The award to
the West Indian was the first ever
given to an economist from the de
veloping world, according to the
Royal Swedish Academy.
Theodore Schultz, 77, of the Uni
versity of Chicago, and Sir Arthur
Lewis, b4, the West Indian native and
British subject who teaches at Prince
ton University,, "both have extensive
practical experience of development
problems and are deeply concerned
about the need and poverty in the
world and how to find ways out of
underdevelopment," the academy
said in a citation.
During the late 19505, Schultz did
research at the Center for Advanced
study in Behavioral Sciences in Palo
Alto.
In an interview with The As
sociated Press at his Princeton home,
Lewis, who was born on the island of
St. Lucia, said he was interested in
what happens to underdeveloped
countries as they become wealthier
and more modern.
"For example, there's a change
from working in factories and work

ing for wages. And there's a transfer
of labor out of the countryside into
the towns and urbanization," Lewis
said.
He had been in close contact with
Schultz since 1951, Lewis said, when
the two worked on a United Nations
committee studying developing
countries.
Schultz, born in Arlington, S.D.,
specialized in the economics of ag
riculture from the outset and was
known as "the father of human capi
tal evolution," the academy said. He
had stressed the importance of
human resources, education, health,
disease and population issues as es
sential factors in economic de
velopment, it said.
Schultz took his doctorate at the
University of Wisconsin in 1930 and
was Charles Hutchinson Professor at
Chicago since 1952 and professor
emeritus since 1972. His most trail
blazing book was "Transforming
Traditional Agriculture," published
in 1964.
Lewis has been an economics
adviser to many African, Latin Ameri
can, Caribbean and Asian countries.
He had put special emphasis on
the liberation of women in develop
ing countries and what that would
mean for their economies.
Three of the five 1979 Nobel
awards have been distributed this
year and of the nine winners, five
have been Americans. Two have
been Britons, one Pakistani and one
German.
