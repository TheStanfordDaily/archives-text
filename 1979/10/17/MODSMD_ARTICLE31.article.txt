# VTS looks at technology in culture
## 
### Fran Miller 
The world "doesn't organize
itself like university depart
ments. We must look beyond
the borders of any individual
discipline to deal with prob
lems. The Values, Technology
and Society (VTS) program at
Stanford cannot offer neatly
packaged solutions."
What VTS can do, however,
according to Economics Pro
lessor Nathan Rosenberg, is to
"deal simultaneously with dif
ferent kinds of concerns."
VTS was begun about nine
years ago by a group of faculty
who, according to Walter Vin
centi, one of the VTS founders,
"began to see that technology
is a useful focus for general
education — something that
brings together people from all
walks of life.
"Technology is the one thing
that distinguishes our culture
from others more than any
other single element; yet, we
regard it as something
exogenous to the culture,"

commented Vincenti. "It is an
enormously important activity
which characterizes the mod
ern world, but the nature of
which is hardly reflected at all
in the traditional departments
of the University.
"VTS is technological, but
not technical," he said. "It in
volves the interplay of
technological activities with
social institutions and values."
Courses listed range from
"Philosophy of Technology" to
"Technology and Musical Ex
pression" to "Energy and Soci
ety."
According to Robert
McGinn, associate director of
VTS and a member of the En
gineering Department, "VTS is
one of the few places on cam
pus where there is a concern
for ethics and human values in
a way which is intellectually re
spectable, not overly theoreti
cal."
Although McGinn teaches
the formal introductory course
in the program,"Contempor

ary Technological Society," he
said there are no prerequisites
for the courses and that they
attract all ages and majors. He
said, however, that he hopes to
increase the structure and
cohesiveness of the program in
the future.
"We prefer to have our own
identity and do not want to be
come an umbrella organization
— that is, by simply listing
courses which already appear
in other departments," said
McGinn. At present, 60 per
cent to 70 percent of the
courses offered were designed
specifically for VT*>.
McGinn noted three
changes which will, he hopes,
help improve and expand the
program. The first of these is
the Western Culture sequence
which will be taught beginning
this winter. In these courses,
where the number of guest lec
turers will be limited in order
to make the sequence "more
cohesive," students will study
the classics "as expressions of

a way of life which embodied
interactions of the ideas, val
ues, social institutions and the
technology of the day."
McGinn noted that the
broadening of the concept of
technology is a problem for
most people. "Technological
artifacts are any material ex
tending the realm of human
possibility. The Parthenon and
cathedrals are as much the
product of technological activ
ity as are computers, high rises
and 7475," he said, "and
technology is co-extensive
with human life."
According to McGinn, the
second boost to the program
will come with the establish
ment of a VTS major — a possi
bility in the near future.
Thirdly, the greater visibility
of the VTS honors program,
which can concur with any
major, will enhance VTS, said
McGinn. Because VTS is a
program and not a depart
ment, obtaining funds has
been a problem, as well as find

ing professors who have both
the desire and the time to par
ticipate in it.
Stephen Kline, mechanical
engineer and another of the
VTS "founding fathers," said
he is, "on the whole, pleased
with the overall development
of the program." He said he
hopes to enlist more faculty
from the area of social sci
ences, however.
He said that getting enough
"young manpower" was a
problem. Because one can
only obtain tenure in a de
partment, and it is "difficult to
get tenured anyway," VTS de
pends on already tenured pro
fessors. Kline is on sabbatical
leave this year, and is in the
process of writing a book
which "deals with the basic
conceptual matters of the VTS
program."
Professor of Religious
Studies Edwin Good, a,former
VTS chairman and a member of
the VTS administrative com
mittee along with History Prof.

Barton Bernstein, Kline,
McGinn, Rosenberg and Vin
centi, commented that when
one delves into a new area, one
always looks at his original field
of expertise differently.
In Good's course "Technol
ogy and Musical Expression,"
scheduled to be taught in the
spring, he will examine the his
tory of the piano (a favorite
subject of his) and the way the
machine itself and the music
written lor it are related. This
topic provided the inspiration
and subject matter for the
book Good is currently writ
ing.
Vincenti, chairman of the
program and an aeronautical
engineer, has also channelled
his energy into a new area —
the social history of technology
— and has turned this serious
study into a full time career.
Vincenti cited the writing of
a book with Rosenberg and the
task of putting together "truly

synthetic courses" for VTS as
two projects which required "a
lot of mutual education.
"It took three or four years to
build up common thinking,"
he said. "Words mean diffe
rent things in different de
partments." For Vincenti, who
teaches solely in VTS, as does
McGinn, the experience of
"working together across dis
ciplinary boundaries on com
mon projects has been enorm
ously valuable."

technology of the day."
McGinn noted that the
broadening of the concept of
technology is a problem for
most people. "Technological
artifacts are any material ex
tending the realm of human
possibility. The Parthenon and
cathedrals are as much the
product of technological activ
ity as are computers, high rises
and 7475," he said, "and
technology is co-extensive
with human life."
According to McGinn, the
second boost to the program
will come with the establish
ment of a VTS major — a possi
bility in the near future.
Thirdly, the greater visibility
of the VTS honors program,
which can concur with any
major, will enhance VTS, said
McGinn. Because VTS is a
program and not a depart
ment, obtaining funds has
been a problem, as well as find

ing professors who have both
the desire and the time to par
ticipate in it.
Stephen Kline, mechanical
engineer and another of the
VTS "founding fathers," said
he is, "on the whole, pleased
with the overall development
of the program." He said he
hopes to enlist more faculty
from the area of social sci
ences, however.
He said that getting enough
"young manpower" was a
problem. Because one can
only obtain tenure in a de
partment, and it is "difficult to
get tenured anyway," VTS de
pends on already tenured pro
fessors. Kline is on sabbatical
leave this year, and is in the
process of writing a book
which "deals with the basic
conceptual matters of the VTS
program."

mittee along with History Prof.

Barton Bernstein, Kline,
McGinn, Rosenberg and Vin
centi, commented that when
one delves into a new area, one
always looks at his original field
of expertise differently.
In Good's course "Technol
ogy and Musical Expression,"
scheduled to be taught in the
spring, he will examine the his
tory of the piano (a favorite
subject of his) and the way the
machine itself and the music
written lor it are related. This
topic provided the inspiration
and subject matter for the
book Good is currently writ
ing.
Vincenti, chairman of the
program and an aeronautical
engineer, has also channelled
his energy into a new area —
the social history of technology
— and has turned this serious
study into a full time career.
Vincenti cited the writing of
a book with Rosenberg and the
task of putting together "truly

synthetic courses" for VTS as
two projects which required "a
lot of mutual education.
"It took three or four years to
build up common thinking,"
he said. "Words mean diffe
rent things in different de
partments." For Vincenti, who
teaches solely in VTS, as does
McGinn, the experience of
"working together across dis
ciplinary boundaries on com
mon projects has been enorm
ously valuable."
The world "doesn't organize
itself like university depart
ments. We must look beyond
the borders of any individual
discipline to deal with prob
lems. The Values, Technology
and Society (VTS) program at
Stanford cannot offer neatly
packaged solutions."
What VTS can do, however,
according to Economics Pro
lessor Nathan Rosenberg, is to
"deal simultaneously with dif
ferent kinds of concerns."
VTS was begun about nine
years ago by a group of faculty
who, according to Walter Vin
centi, one of the VTS founders,
"began to see that technology
is a useful focus for general
education — something that
brings together people from all
walks of life.
"Technology is the one thing
that distinguishes our culture
from others more than any
other single element; yet, we
regard it as something
exogenous to the culture,"

commented Vincenti. "It is an
enormously important activity
which characterizes the mod
ern world, but the nature of
which is hardly reflected at all
in the traditional departments
of the University.
"VTS is technological, but
not technical," he said. "It in
volves the interplay of
technological activities with
social institutions and values."
Courses listed range from
"Philosophy of Technology" to
"Technology and Musical Ex
pression" to "Energy and Soci
ety."
According to Robert
McGinn, associate director of
VTS and a member of the En
gineering Department, "VTS is
one of the few places on cam
pus where there is a concern
for ethics and human values in
a way which is intellectually re
spectable, not overly theoreti
cal."
Although McGinn teaches
the formal introductory course
in the program,"Contempor

ary Technological Society," he
said there are no prerequisites
for the courses and that they
attract all ages and majors. He
said, however, that he hopes to
increase the structure and
cohesiveness of the program in
the future.
"We prefer to have our own
identity and do not want to be
come an umbrella organization
— that is, by simply listing
courses which already appear
in other departments," said
McGinn. At present, 60 per
cent to 70 percent of the
courses offered were designed
specifically for VT*>.
McGinn noted three
changes which will, he hopes,
help improve and expand the
program. The first of these is
the Western Culture sequence
which will be taught beginning
this winter. In these courses,
where the number of guest lec
turers will be limited in order
to make the sequence "more
cohesive," students will study
the classics "as expressions of

a way of life which embodied
interactions of the ideas, val
ues, social institutions and the
technology of the day."
McGinn noted that the
broadening of the concept of
technology is a problem for
most people. "Technological
artifacts are any material ex
