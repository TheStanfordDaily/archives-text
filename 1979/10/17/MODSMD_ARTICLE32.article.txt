Carter chastises Cubans
Chicago — President jimmy Carter, ending a
two-day trip to the Midwest, condemned
Cuban military activities yesterday and expres
sed delight over Mayor Jane Byrne's near
endorsement of his re-election.
Carter came to Chicago on uncertain politi
cal ground with the city's Democratic leaders,
but he returned to Washington with a surpris
ingly strong statement of support from
Byrne.
Although he did not get a firm endorsement
for his expected bid for another term, Carter
did get Byrne's assertion that if the deci
sion were to be made now, she would vote for
him.
Carter criticized Cuba as "the most highly
militarized country on Earth per capita." The
Cubans, he said, are "constantly interfering"
with the affairs of other countries.

Carter said the Cubans have more than
45,000 troops in countries where "they have
absolutely no business."
The United States will not move to establish
normal diplomatic relations with the island na
tion until Cuba ends its involvement in the
affairs of other countries and until the regime
of President Fidel Castro releases "hundreds
and hundreds, even thousands," of political
prisoners.
Over 400 hurt in train crash
Philadelphia — Screaming passengers were
sent "flying" down the aisles and slamming
into seatbacks when three packed commuter
trains crashed in a chain reaction at the peak of
the morning rush-hour yesterday. There were
more than 400 injuries, most of them minor,
authorities said.
"We were going at a good clip, 40 to 45 miles
an hour," said R.C. Morrow of Glen Mills, a
structural engineer and one of the commuters
on board.
There were no reports of fatalities in the 8:19
a.m. crash on the Media-West Chester line just
beyond a curve in the southwest section of the
city.
The passengers, many dazed and dabbing
their bloody faces with handkerchiefs, stum
bled from the cars as police wagons, ambu
lances and fire rescue vehicles raced to the
scene.
The injured were taken to 24 hospitals and
an elementary school, the police commis
sioner said.
Conrail officials said as many as 1200 passen
gers may have been riding on the trains.
Five cars derailed — two on the express and
three from the moving fourth train. The ex
press had originated in West Chester, the
other three trains in Media.
Miller expects mild recession
Washington — Treasury Secretary William
Miller said yesterday the nation still faces a
moderate recession, despite figures showing
industrial production in September registered
the biggest growth in four months.
Miller told a congressional panel, "We can
not be as certain as previously about the depth
and severity of the economic slow-down," he
said. But Miller quickly added that "there are
few signs" the recession will be as bad as the
1974-1975 downturn which was the worst since

the depression.
The treasury secretary's testimony before
members of the Joint Economic Committee
came at the same time the Federal Reserve
Board released figures showing industrial pro
duction was up by 0.5 percent last month.
The increase represented a turn-around
from a decline of 0.9 percent in August. The
improvement was largely a result of an in
crease in auto output as manufacturers began
production of 1980 models. But total output of
the nation's factories, utilities and mines still
was below the year's peak production levels
set in March.
Miller said the nation's economy in recent
weeks has shown "more strength than earlier
anticipated," but added that he still forecasts
"a moderate recession."
Quake damages water canal
El Cenfro, Calif. — The Ail-American Canal,
the lifeline that has turned this desert land near
the Mexican border into a fruitful agricultural
valley, suffered more than $1 million damage
in Monday's earthquake.
The canal normally carries about 3800 cubic
feet per second of irrigation and drinking
water 80 miles from Yuma, Ariz., to just south
of Calexico.
As soon as the 6.5 earthquake hit, irrigation
officials cut the flow of Colorado River water
by about 85 percent to keep it from overflow
ing the caving-in banks and seeping through
the spreading cracks.
El Centro, the county seat, has a two-day
supply of water in storage ponds, said Lonnie
McGlocklin, assistant to the general manager
of the Imperial County Irrigation District.
City and county officials urged residents to
conserve water and had tank trucks standing
by to deliver more drinking water if the chan
nel is not repaired by tomorrow.
The worst damage occurred where the Im
perial Fault intersects the 100-foot-wide canal.
On the south side ot the canal wall, 500 feet of
earth collapsed, and some water seeped into
the desert to form a temporary pond.
The north bank, bordering the baby crops,
collapsed for about 200 yards but no water
escaped to flood the fields.
Pinto safety reports not issued
Chicago — The Ford Motor Co. followed a
practice of not issuing reports on randomly

tested Pinto automobiles from the assembly
line that failed to meet federal safety stan
dards, a Ford document shows.
The Chicago Tribune reported that a Nov.
27, 1972, memo written by F.J. Finkenauer Jr.,
then manager of Ford's body-testing depart
ment, said the procedure was "somewhat
questionable."
Frank Armstrong, director of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration's office
of vehicle safety compliance in Washington,
D.C., said in an interview Monday he has not
seen the document cited by the newspaper.
But he said he told the Tribune, "This sounds
like a cover-up to me."
Armstrong added, "We certainly will look at
these things and investigate ... It sounded
suspicious, but you can't evaluate this stuff
over a telephone."
Italian financier reappears
New York — Italian financier Michele Sin
dona, who disappeared mysteriously 2Vi
months ago, surfaced in Manhattan yesterday
and was hospitalized with a leg wound, federal
officials said.
A government spokesman said two federal
marshals were sent to Doctors Hospital to
guard Sindona. He was not under arrest but a
24-hour guard was assigned, according to an
FBI spokesman.
A determination will be made later on how
long 59-year-old Sindonia, who faces trial on a
host of federal charges involving the failure of
a major bank, will remain in the hospital.

Over 400 hurt in train crash
Philadelphia — Screaming passengers were
sent "flying" down the aisles and slamming
into seatbacks when three packed commuter
trains crashed in a chain reaction at the peak of
the morning rush-hour yesterday. There were
more than 400 injuries, most of them minor,
authorities said.
"We were going at a good clip, 40 to 45 miles
an hour," said R.C. Morrow of Glen Mills, a
structural engineer and one of the commuters
on board.
There were no reports of fatalities in the 8:19
a.m. crash on the Media-West Chester line just
beyond a curve in the southwest section of the
city.
The passengers, many dazed and dabbing
their bloody faces with handkerchiefs, stum
bled from the cars as police wagons, ambu
lances and fire rescue vehicles raced to the
scene.
The injured were taken to 24 hospitals and
an elementary school, the police commis

Conrail officials said as many as 1200 passen

Five cars derailed — two on the express and
three from the moving fourth train. The ex

Miller expects mild recession
Washington — Treasury Secretary William
Miller said yesterday the nation still faces a
moderate recession, despite figures showing
industrial production in September registered
the biggest growth in four months.
Miller told a congressional panel, "We can
not be as certain as previously about the depth
and severity of the economic slow-down," he
said. But Miller quickly added that "there are
few signs" the recession will be as bad as the
1974-1975 downturn which was the worst since

the depression.
The treasury secretary's testimony before
members of the Joint Economic Committee
came at the same time the Federal Reserve
Board released figures showing industrial pro
duction was up by 0.5 percent last month.
The increase represented a turn-around
from a decline of 0.9 percent in August. The
improvement was largely a result of an in
crease in auto output as manufacturers began
production of 1980 models. But total output of
the nation's factories, utilities and mines still
was below the year's peak production levels
set in March.
Miller said the nation's economy in recent
weeks has shown "more strength than earlier
anticipated," but added that he still forecasts
"a moderate recession."
Quake damages water canal
El Cenfro, Calif. — The Ail-American Canal,
the lifeline that has turned this desert land near
the Mexican border into a fruitful agricultural
valley, suffered more than $1 million damage
in Monday's earthquake.
The canal normally carries about 3800 cubic
feet per second of irrigation and drinking
water 80 miles from Yuma, Ariz., to just south
of Calexico.
As soon as the 6.5 earthquake hit, irrigation
officials cut the flow of Colorado River water
by about 85 percent to keep it from overflow
ing the caving-in banks and seeping through
the spreading cracks.
El Centro, the county seat, has a two-day
supply of water in storage ponds, said Lonnie
McGlocklin, assistant to the general manager
of the Imperial County Irrigation District.
City and county officials urged residents to
conserve water and had tank trucks standing
by to deliver more drinking water if the chan
nel is not repaired by tomorrow.
The worst damage occurred where the Im
perial Fault intersects the 100-foot-wide canal.
On the south side ot the canal wall, 500 feet of
earth collapsed, and some water seeped into
the desert to form a temporary pond.
The north bank, bordering the baby crops,
collapsed for about 200 yards but no water
escaped to flood the fields.

from a decline of 0.9 percent in August. The
improvement was largely a result of an in
crease in auto output as manufacturers began
production of 1980 models. But total output of
the nation's factories, utilities and mines still
was below the year's peak production levels
set in March.
Miller said the nation's economy in recent
weeks has shown "more strength than earlier
anticipated," but added that he still forecasts
"a moderate recession."
Quake damages water canal
El Cenfro, Calif. — The Ail-American Canal,
the lifeline that has turned this desert land near
the Mexican border into a fruitful agricultural
valley, suffered more than $1 million damage
in Monday's earthquake.
The canal normally carries about 3800 cubic
feet per second of irrigation and drinking
water 80 miles from Yuma, Ariz., to just south
of Calexico.
As soon as the 6.5 earthquake hit, irrigation
officials cut the flow of Colorado River water
by about 85 percent to keep it from overflow
ing the caving-in banks and seeping through
the spreading cracks.
El Centro, the county seat, has a two-day
supply of water in storage ponds, said Lonnie
McGlocklin, assistant to the general manager
of the Imperial County Irrigation District.
City and county officials urged residents to
conserve water and had tank trucks standing
by to deliver more drinking water if the chan
nel is not repaired by tomorrow.
The worst damage occurred where the Im
perial Fault intersects the 100-foot-wide canal.
On the south side ot the canal wall, 500 feet of
earth collapsed, and some water seeped into
the desert to form a temporary pond.
The north bank, bordering the baby crops,
collapsed for about 200 yards but no water
escaped to flood the fields.
Pinto safety reports not issued
Chicago — The Ford Motor Co. followed a
practice of not issuing reports on randomly

tested Pinto automobiles from the assembly
line that failed to meet federal safety stan
dards, a Ford document shows.
The Chicago Tribune reported that a Nov.
27, 1972, memo written by F.J. Finkenauer Jr.,
then manager of Ford's body-testing depart
ment, said the procedure was "somewhat
questionable."
Frank Armstrong, director of the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration's office
of vehicle safety compliance in Washington,
D.C., said in an interview Monday he has not
seen the document cited by the newspaper.
But he said he told the Tribune, "This sounds
like a cover-up to me."
Armstrong added, "We certainly will look at
these things and investigate ... It sounded
suspicious, but you can't evaluate this stuff
over a telephone."

Peanut probe clears Carter
Washington — A special counsel, declaring
that "there is no evidence to establish that
Jimmy Carter comitted any crimes," said yes
terday no prosecution is planned in connec
tion with the financing of the president's fam
ily peanut business.
Special counsel Paul Curran, concluding a
six-month investigation, said "no indictment
can or should be brought against anyone" in
volved in nearly $10 million in loans from the
National Bank of Georgia to the peanut busi
ness.
Curran, in a 239-page report to Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti, said there was no
evidence any of the money was diverted into
Carter's 1976 presidential campaign. He also
concluded there was no evidence of any crim
inal activities stemming from the loans.
However, Curran described a series of fi
nancial irregularities, involving bookkeeping
mistakes and inadequate collateral on the part
of the Carter peanut warehouse, which has
been heavily in debt.
Curran also disclosed that he took an unpre
cedented four-hour deposition from the pres
ident at the White House on Sept. 5. '
It marked the first time in history that an
incumbent president had given sworn tes
timony in acrimiria! investigation, Curran said.
Former President Richard Nixon's depositions
in the Watergate scandal were taken after he
left office.
Carter chastises Cubans
Chicago — President jimmy Carter, ending a
two-day trip to the Midwest, condemned
Cuban military activities yesterday and expres
sed delight over Mayor Jane Byrne's near
endorsement of his re-election.
Carter came to Chicago on uncertain politi
cal ground with the city's Democratic leaders,
but he returned to Washington with a surpris
ingly strong statement of support from
Byrne.
Although he did not get a firm endorsement
for his expected bid for another term, Carter
did get Byrne's assertion that if the deci
sion were to be made now, she would vote for
him.
Carter criticized Cuba as "the most highly
militarized country on Earth per capita." The
Cubans, he said, are "constantly interfering"
with the affairs of other countries.

Carter said the Cubans have more than
45,000 troops in countries where "they have
absolutely no business."
The United States will not move to establish
normal diplomatic relations with the island na
tion until Cuba ends its involvement in the
affairs of other countries and until the regime
of President Fidel Castro releases "hundreds
and hundreds, even thousands," of political
prisoners.
Over 400 hurt in train crash
Philadelphia — Screaming passengers were
sent "flying" down the aisles and slamming
into seatbacks when three packed commuter
trains crashed in a chain reaction at the peak of
the morning rush-hour yesterday. There were
more than 400 injuries, most of them minor,
authorities said.
"We were going at a good clip, 40 to 45 miles
an hour," said R.C. Morrow of Glen Mills, a
structural engineer and one of the commuters
on board.
There were no reports of fatalities in the 8:19
a.m. crash on the Media-West Chester line just
beyond a curve in the southwest section of the
city.
The passengers, many dazed and dabbing
their bloody faces with handkerchiefs, stum
bled from the cars as police wagons, ambu
lances and fire rescue vehicles raced to the
scene.
The injured were taken to 24 hospitals and
an elementary school, the police commis
sioner said.
Conrail officials said as many as 1200 passen
gers may have been riding on the trains.
Five cars derailed — two on the express and
three from the moving fourth train. The ex
press had originated in West Chester, the
other three trains in Media.
Miller expects mild recession
Washington — Treasury Secretary William
Miller said yesterday the nation still faces a
moderate recession, despite figures showing
industrial production in September registered
the biggest growth in four months.
Miller told a congressional panel, "We can
not be as certain as previously about the depth
and severity of the economic slow-down," he
said. But Miller quickly added that "there are
few signs" the recession will be as bad as the
1974-1975 downturn which was the worst since

the depression.
The treasury secretary's testimony before
members of the Joint Economic Committee
came at the same time the Federal Reserve
Board released figures showing industrial pro
duction was up by 0.5 percent last month.
The increase represented a turn-around
from a decline of 0.9 percent in August. The
improvement was largely a result of an in
crease in auto output as manufacturers began
production of 1980 models. But total output of
the nation's factories, utilities and mines still
was below the year's peak production levels
set in March.

"a moderate recession."
