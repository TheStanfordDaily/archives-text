# High voter turnout marks first day of autumn ASSU elections
## 
### Rebecca Moss 
About 1300 students voted in the
ASSU elections yesterday, slightly
more than usual for the first day, ac
cording to Elections Commissioner
Mike O'Reilly. In order for the fee
assessment vote to be valid, at least
2700 ballots must be cast.
Competition is a little stiffer this
year than last year for the candidates.
There are 61 undergraduates and 19
graduates for the 20 seats in the se
nate, compared to last year's 26 un
dergraduates and 10 graduates.
Elections continue today at nine
polling spots across campus. Stu
dents will cast their ballots for
senators and vote on three referen
dum issues and two fee assessments.
The mascot referendum calls for
voters to choose between the Grif
fons, the Trees, and the Cardinal.
Election reform
The second referendum consists
of several proposals for senate elec
tion reform, including senate dis
tricting, live petitions and staggered
elections.
Districting would require candi
dates to seek election in only one
district. Candidates who win will rep
resent their respective districts.

Proponents of the idea claim that
districting would promote senate
communication and accountability.
Critics argue that it would discrimi
nate against special interest groups
and minorities.
'Live' petitions
The live petition plan would allow
any student to become a member of
the senate by obtaining 200 signa
tures on a petition.
Advocates of the staggered elec
tion proposal claim that a sense of
continuity will arise from elections in
the spring and fall.

The fourth option calls for no
change in current senate election
procedures.
Nighttime tennis
The third referendum asks stu
dents' opinion on the need for
lighted tennis courts on campus.
Two fee assessments — for the
Women's Center and the Band —
appear on the ballot. To pass, each
assessment needs a simple majority
of voters provided 20 percent of the
student body votes on it. If fewer
than that number vote, the results
will not be valid
