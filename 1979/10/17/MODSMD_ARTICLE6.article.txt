The Palo Alto City Council yester
day approved University plans for a
140-unit faculty housing develop
ment on Peter Coutts Hill near the
Stanford Industrial Park.
However, the 20-acre project drew
opposition from Palo Alto residents,
mainly from the College Terrace
area, who wanted to keep the space
open for a municipal park.
"That the council refused to rec
ognize opposition to the project was
surprising and disappointing,"
commented John Schaefer, a resi
dent of the College Terrace area.
"But it looked like the council had
pretty much made up its mind al
ready before the meeting began," he
said.
According to Bob Summers, man
ager of faculty staff housing, the pro

ject has been designed to leave as
much space open as possible. Pre
sent plans are for 10 multi-unit clus
ters of two- and three-story apart
ment buildings.
Costs to faculty to the completed
units will range from $100,000 to
$200,000, but special financing will
be made available, Summers said.
The University has been ex
periencing a severe faculty housing
shortage that has deterred some
prospective senior faculty members
from coming to Stanford, according
to Summers.
Now that the plans have been ap
proved by the city council, they will
go before several Santa Clara County
Boards which will make final deci
sions regarding development of the
hill.
