# S.F. Examiner photographers tell lurid tales
## 
### Jane West 
Secretaries swarm around a
male belly dancer during their
lunch hour. An old blind man
feels his way out of the vbting
building on election day.
These are just two of the many
photographs shown last week at a
presentation by three photo
graphers from the San Francisco
Examiner.
Entitled "Lurid Tales from a
Panel of Newspaper Photo
graphers," the presentation was
the first in the Student Arts at
Stanford lecture series on Six
Views of Photography.
Nicole Bengiveno, Katy Radditz
and Lee Romero, part of the
Examiner's 15-member photo
staff, shared their photos and per
sonal experiences with the audi
ence.
Radditz, a 32-year-old from Los
Angeles, began by showing 30 of
her favorite photographs and en
couraging audience feedback.
People featured
Her photo subjects, although
varied, were mainly involving
people — the audience at a loan
Baez concert, kids on a high
school field trip, someone laugh
ing and the first gay rights march
in San Francisco.
Radditz said her photo assign
ments have ranged from a heroin
bust she made with the police to a
baby being born. Making the drug
bust "was a creepy feeling be
cause I was literally breaking into
people's lives," she said.
In contrast, photographing the
birth was "probably one of the
most perfect situations. It was a
wonderful experience and the ac
cess was terrific," Radditz added.
"A bookseller's convention was
one of the most decadent things
I've seen," she continued. Her
picture of the convention fea
tured a dwarf lady and "a little bit
of everything."
Hired by 'Examiner'
After freelancing for a few
years, Radditz said she "con
vinced the Examiner through

great passion" to hire her. "I was
the second woman in the depart
ment and I like to think I do a very
good job," she added.
Bengiveno, 28, also freelanced
until she "built a great portfolio
and felt good enough to approach
the Examiner." Many of her pic
tures were photo essays, includ
ing fashion spreads, cable cars
and different ways people wait at
bus stops.
Her photos speak for them
selves. "One expression can tell
the visual story," she said. For
example, "in the Chinatown split
demonstration, one guy stood out
from the rest. I took him instead
of the crowds, and it made the
front page."
Active involvement
Bengiveno said she gets actively
involved in her photography. For
a story on a nudist beach, she
realized that photographing while
dressed might bother the nude
subjects.
"I got involved first, made
friends, and then they didn't mind
me taking pictures," she said.
At Marriott's Great America
amusement park, she snapped a
picture while riding upside down
on one of the rides, and while
photographing a fashion assign
ment, she had to put on roller
skates to show the model how to
skate.
Romero, who had worked at
several papers including the New
York Times and Los Angeles Times
by the age of 37, said he under
stands the delicate problems in
volved with photography.
Special approach
"You must approach people in
a certain way. They have a right to
privacy and they deserve respect.
There must always be a purpose
for illustrating something," he
said.
Romero used the example of an
investigative assignment he did in
Mexico where he approached an
apprehensive Mexican woman by
acting interested in her dog.
"After watching me photograph

her dog, she became interested
and invited me inside," he
explained. Then he was able to
photograph her freely.
Among his other photos were
scenes of Mexican factories,
bullfights and people at work.
One shot, in Romero's words,
showed Mexicans "standing at
the Tijuana border gazing at the
United States."
Seeks challenges
Romero said he thinks of him
self as a gypsy, forever searching
for challenges. But, like Radditz

and Bengiveno, he said he feels
the Examiner is a photographer's
heaven.
"We're allowed to go out and
get our own ideas and work on
special projects," said Bengiveno.
At a panel discussion following
the presentations, Eric Meskaus
kas, photo director at the
Examiner said, "This group is dif
ferent from average photo
graphers. They look for some
thing universal, generally find it
and then add something extra to
it."

their work at the first of a six-series lecture program on Views of Photography.

her dog, she became interested
and invited me inside," he
explained. Then he was able to
photograph her freely.
Among his other photos were
scenes of Mexican factories,
bullfights and people at work.
One shot, in Romero's words,
showed Mexicans "standing at
the Tijuana border gazing at the
United States."
Seeks challenges
Romero said he thinks of him
self as a gypsy, forever searching
for challenges. But, like Radditz

and Bengiveno, he said he feels
the Examiner is a photographer's
heaven.
"We're allowed to go out and
get our own ideas and work on
special projects," said Bengiveno.
At a panel discussion following
the presentations, Eric Meskaus
kas, photo director at the
Examiner said, "This group is dif
ferent from average photo
graphers. They look for some
thing universal, generally find it
and then add something extra to
it."

These are just two of the many
photographs shown last week at a
presentation by three photo
graphers from the San Francisco
Examiner.
Entitled "Lurid Tales from a
Panel of Newspaper Photo
graphers," the presentation was
the first in the Student Arts at
Stanford lecture series on Six
Views of Photography.
Nicole Bengiveno, Katy Radditz
and Lee Romero, part of the
Examiner's 15-member photo
staff, shared their photos and per
sonal experiences with the audi
ence.
Radditz, a 32-year-old from Los
Angeles, began by showing 30 of
her favorite photographs and en
couraging audience feedback.
People featured
Her photo subjects, although
varied, were mainly involving
people — the audience at a loan
Baez concert, kids on a high
school field trip, someone laugh
ing and the first gay rights march
in San Francisco.
Radditz said her photo assign
ments have ranged from a heroin
bust she made with the police to a
baby being born. Making the drug
bust "was a creepy feeling be
cause I was literally breaking into
people's lives," she said.
In contrast, photographing the
birth was "probably one of the
most perfect situations. It was a
wonderful experience and the ac
cess was terrific," Radditz added.
"A bookseller's convention was
one of the most decadent things
I've seen," she continued. Her
picture of the convention fea
tured a dwarf lady and "a little bit
of everything."
Hired by 'Examiner'
After freelancing for a few
years, Radditz said she "con
vinced the Examiner through

great passion" to hire her. "I was
the second woman in the depart
ment and I like to think I do a very
good job," she added.
Bengiveno, 28, also freelanced
until she "built a great portfolio
and felt good enough to approach
the Examiner." Many of her pic
tures were photo essays, includ
ing fashion spreads, cable cars
and different ways people wait at
bus stops.
Her photos speak for them
selves. "One expression can tell
the visual story," she said. For
example, "in the Chinatown split
demonstration, one guy stood out
from the rest. I took him instead
of the crowds, and it made the
front page."
Active involvement
Bengiveno said she gets actively
involved in her photography. For
a story on a nudist beach, she
realized that photographing while
dressed might bother the nude
subjects.
"I got involved first, made
friends, and then they didn't mind
me taking pictures," she said.
At Marriott's Great America
amusement park, she snapped a
picture while riding upside down
on one of the rides, and while
photographing a fashion assign
ment, she had to put on roller
skates to show the model how to
skate.
Romero, who had worked at
several papers including the New
York Times and Los Angeles Times
by the age of 37, said he under
stands the delicate problems in
volved with photography.
Special approach
"You must approach people in
a certain way. They have a right to
privacy and they deserve respect.
There must always be a purpose
for illustrating something," he
said.
Romero used the example of an
investigative assignment he did in
Mexico where he approached an
apprehensive Mexican woman by
acting interested in her dog.
"After watching me photograph

her dog, she became interested
and invited me inside," he
explained. Then he was able to
photograph her freely.
Among his other photos were
scenes of Mexican factories,
bullfights and people at work.
