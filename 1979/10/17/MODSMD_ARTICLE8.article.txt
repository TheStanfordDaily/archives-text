## More Israelis move into disputed land 
### 
Tel Aviv, Israel (AP) â€” Ultra
nationalist Israelis staked out
camps on the occupied West
Bank Monday and played
hide-and-seek with soldiers
trying to end their protest
against government settlement
policy.
At nightfall the army and de
fense ministry claimed to have
evacuated most of the
campsites, but settlers in at
least one camp refused orders
to leave. Others jumped from
one location to another when
troops approached.
"It's like a cat-and-mouse
game," said Defense Ministry
spokesman Dan Weinreich.
Nine of the demonstrators
were arrested, and one shoot
ing incident was reported
when Moshe Shamir, a parlia
ment member who supports
the settlers' protest, refused to
obey orders to stop at an army
roadblock north of Jerusalem.
A soldier fired one shot that hit
a wheel of Shamir's car, the
army spokesman said, but
there were no injuries.
Shamir claimed he had the
right to go anywhere as a
member of parliament, but a
senior military official, who
asked not to be identified, said
Shamir's behavior had been
provocative and he was lucky
that there had not been a
tragedy.
"Footholds"
Some 2000 Jewish settlers,
including women and chil
dren, moved out ot their West
Bank villages before dawn
Monday with tents and rough
building materials to erect
camps they called "footholds."
Reports on the number of
camps ranged from 28 to 40,
but it was by tar the largest and
best-orchestrated operation
launched by the Gush Emunim
settlement organization.
In recent weeks Gush
Emunim, whose name means
Bloc of the Faithful, Had haras
sed the army by putting up a
camp or two each week out
side authorized settlements.
Monday's big operation was
a response to a cabinet deci

sion Sunday against the ex
propriation of private Arab
land for Jewish settlements.
Gush Emunim says its West
Bank settlements are throttled
for lack of land, and the or
ganization was not satisfied
with the Cabinet's decision to
allocate state-owned land for
six settlements.
In Cairo, a statement issued
by the Egyptian Foreign Minis
try said the decision by Prime
Minister Menachem Begin's
cabinet was an obstruction in
the peace process. "There is
no difference between Israel's
seizure of land in the occupied
territories. All land is Arab land
and Israel has no right to it,"
the Egyptian statement said.


History prof. Barton Bernstein says U.S. obstinance on prisoner
repatriation may have prolonged the Korean war.
