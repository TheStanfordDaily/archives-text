Oslo, Norway (AP) — Mother
Teresa, Calcutta's "saint of the gut
ters," won the 1979 Nobel Peace
Prize yesterday and said she would
spend the $190,000 purse on lepers
and the destitute to whom she has
dedicated her life.
"Poverty and hunger and distress
also constitute a threat to peace," the
Nobel Committee said in citing the
sixth woman to win the prize.
The Yugoslav-born Roman
Catholic nun, daughter of an Alba
nian shopkeeper and now a citizen of
India, said she accepted the award
"in the name of the poor."
Her order, the Mission of Charity,
was founded in Calcutta's stums in
1948 when Mother Teresa opened
her first school with 40 cents in her
pocket and special permission from
Rome to live outside a convent. The
order now runs schools, hospitals,
youth centers and orphanages in 50
Indian cities and in others around the
world, from the Bronx, New York, to
Papua, New Guinea.
The five-member Norwegian
Nobel Committee said Mother
Teresa, 69, was given the prize "in
recognition of her work in bringing
help to suffering humanity." She has
been nominated for the prize for
several years and has often been
mentioned as a possible recipient.
President )immy Carter was

another nominee for the award for
his Mideast peace efforts. He was
first nominated for the 1978 award,
too late to be considered, and was
renominated this year. He received a
special mention for his efforts in the
citation given to the 1978 winners,
Prime Minister Menachem Begin of
Israel and Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat.
Hundreds of beggars, lepers, the
blind, the crippled, the dying and the
unwanted gather daily outside
Mother Teresa's Calcutta mission for
a free meal. For decades she has
given the poor of the slums medical
care, schooling, a bowl of gruel, a
slice of bread, or just a clean place to
die.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee
noted this was not the first time they
awarded the prize for work underta
ken to overcome poverty.
The hallmark of Mother Teresa's
work, it added, "has been respect for
the individual human being, for his
or her dignity and innate value. The
loneliest, the most wretched and the
dying have at her hands received
compassion without condescension,
based on reverence for man."
"I accept in the name of the poor
because I believe that by giving me
this prize they are recognizing the
presence of the poor in the world,"
said Mother Teresa, reached at the

headquarters of her mission in the
slums of Calcutta in east India. She
said she had heard the Oslo an
nouncement on local TV.
Talking with reporters after even
ing prayers, she spoke of love, pov
erty and greed. "Greed," she said,
"is the greatest obstacle to peace in
the world today — greed for power,
for money and for name."
With her prize money, "I will build
more homes for the destitute and the
poor, especially for the lepers," she
said.
It was not known if Mother Teresa
would personally accept the award in
a ceremony in Oslo on Dec. 10. The
presentation is made on the anniver
sary of the death of Swedish
dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel,
who set up the prizes. The other
awards are presented that same day
in Stockholm, including the Nobel
Prize for Literature which is to be an
nounced today.
Mother Teresa was born August
27, 1910, in Skopje, Yugoslavia, and
her original name was Agnes Gonxha
Bojaxhiu.
At age 12, she decided to become a
nun and six years later joined the Sis
ters of Loreto, an Irish order, which
sent her to India in 1928 to teach.

that Mother Teresa says she heard
her second call, "to serve Him
among the poorest of the poor."
When the short, slight woman
opened the mission's "home for the
destitute dying" next to a Hindu
temple in 1952, 400 Brahmin priests
staged a noisy street protest outside.
"If you want to kill me, kill me,"
she told the priests. "Let them (the
inmates) die in peace."
She won them over.
She accepts no direct financial as
sistance from the Indian govern
ment, only an occasional gift of land
for a new project, saying that "God is
our banker, he always provides."

work, not mine."
