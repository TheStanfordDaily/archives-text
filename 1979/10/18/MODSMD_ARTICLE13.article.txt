## Indian mascot inhumane 
### 
The use of the Native Ameri
can culture and religious prac
tices as a theme for a mascot is
the issue before the Stanford
community. It is not the band's
songs, Timm Williams appear
ing at the stadium ordecadesof
tradition at the university.
I challenge all of us in the
Stanford family to take a seri
ous look at the issue. I speak
from the perspective of a Stan
ford alum and a Stanford
employee.
Blind pride
I participated in intercol
legiate sports as a Stanford In
dian and I proudly described
myself and my school mascot
as the Indians. I was proud. I
was blind.
Once I stopped and thought
about how I would feel if either
my culture or religion were
used to entertain others, un
licensed and with little ap
preciation, and even less un
derstanding, the issue of sup
porting the Indian symbol be
came moot.
My understanding and ap
preciation for cultural herit
ages and the issues that sur
round their development was
greatly enhanced while a stu
dent here. It was the times, but
it was also a unique ability of a
university community to de
velop, change, and in some in
stances be morally supportive.
What was happening to Stan
ford, as in America generally,
was a gradual awakening to the
specific conditions of ethnic
people in America.
Those ethnic people were
becoming awakened to the
pride of their specific ac
complishments and contribu
tions previously overlooked,
and sought lasting recovery
from past injustices, some of
which were willful, some done
in the myopia of good clean
fun.
Change the bath water
Ridding ourselves of blind

images, well meaning though
they might be, is not like
throwing out the baby with the
bath water as some among us
would like us to believe.
We do not have to stop hav
ing Native Americans as part of
our heritage or our future.
There are ways to show our
respect and support other than
having them serve as our mas
cot.
What is so deficient, anyway,
about our efforts to provide
educational access and ser
vices to the Native Americans
among us? And, if we're even
more eager, why stop there?
As a community of tremen
dous intellectual and capital
means there is a great deal we

can do to assist Native Ameri
cans if that is the path we
choose.
Attempts to bring the Indian
symbol back is like never
changing the bath water.
Years, now, have been spent
trying to bail our way out of the
tub muddied with guilt, racism
and misconception.
It is time that the steadily
growing human inside the tub
raise itself upand pull the plug.
Then, let's refill it with the
substance we have as a com
munity to claim excellence in
academics, sports and a grow
ing humanity among us.
