# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Laurie Could Transfer finds greener pastures here 
### 
After a year at Stanford, I am
now writing the column I've
always wanted to write. Not so
much to tell you what my first
experiences were like here,
but to relate how they compare
to the ones I had at Northwest
ern, the school from which I
transferred.
First, for those of you who
don't know where Northwest
ern (N.U.) is, it's located in
Evanston, 111., a suburb north
of Chicago on the (bitter cold)

shores of Lake Michigan . . .
Last Saturday as I sat by the
White Plaza "claw," listening
to the drops of water tumble
into the pool and thinking
about the football game
against USC, my thoughts
raced backwards two years to
memories of those unmemor
able NU games.
A favorite post-game dinner
discussion was cutting down
the football team — when you
hold the proud position of

being the worst in the nation,
what else do you do? '
While the football fans in the
rest of the country watched the
top 10, we eyed the bottom 10
— could we retain that coveted
standing another year? It's nice
now to be at a school that
people have pride in — for
football, for the band, for
being better than the Ivy
League, or whatever.
One other thing I've noticed
in terms of school spirit is that
almost no one at Northwestern
wore school paraphernalia.
Here, people pride themselves
on having a whole wardrobe of
Stanford clothing or being the
first to discover a new T-shirt
when it comes in.
Housing. Now that's a good
topic. Admittedly, I wonder
where I'll be living during my
unguaranteed year, but I can't
help remembering some
freshman friends at NU (mostly
men) who were kicked out of
university housing after their
first year.
At Northwestern, if you pull
a terrible number in the hous
ing draw, you can be out of
university housing for good.
Time to pitch the old tent on
the shores of Lake Michigan.
Rents in Evanston are com
parable in cost to those in Palo
Alto, and off-campus housing
just as scarce, but with the
added disadvantage of having
to commute through snow and
20-50 degree below zero wind
chills for half of the year.
The administration at Stan
ford is definitely more
student-oriented — especially
their policies concerning pass/
fail, drop/add, and, yes, even
meal plans.
At NU if you fail a class, you

fail and your transcript shows it
(no, I'm not speaking from ex
perience!).
If you want to drop a class,
you must do it by about the
sixth week.
If you drop after the
specified date, your transcript
shows that you withdrew from
the class late, along with
whether you were passing or
failing.
If you had a meal plan, you
were only allowed to eat at
your dorm — that was really
bad for me, with all my classes
twenty minutes away.
One upsetting aspect of
going to school here is the
drinking age. At least in Illinois
you can drink beer and wine at
19.
Having just turned that age
before transferring, I could
have gone back to NU and at
least been able to drink wine.
But, no, I came to California —
two years until I can drink.
I thought this was supposed
to be a liberal state?! At least
that's what they told me back in
Nebraska (my home state).
That brings me to my last
topic — reactions to my home
town, Omaha, Neb. Most
people at NU had heard of it or
at least were aware that it's in
the Midwest. Out here when
someone asked me where I
was from and I responded
"Nebraska," he said, "Oh,
you're from back East?"
Even though these are ex
periences that are unique to
me, I thought in some way
everyone could relate them to
their lives here, too.
