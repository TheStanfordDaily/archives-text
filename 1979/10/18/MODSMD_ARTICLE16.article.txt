Insulting racism
All the distorted thinking
floating to the surface around
the mascot issue is pretty dis
turbing. I guess it comes as no
surprise that a lot of blatant ra
cism and Anglo paternalism is
coming out.
However, Lee Altenberg's
letter in the Oct. 10 Daily cal
ling for the mascot to be called
the Stanford "Coolies" opens
up new territory.
It is not enough that this per
son Altenberg wants to con
tinue calling for an ethnic
people to be used as mascot:
he wants to debate with the
rest of Stanford's racists as to
the target of this demeaning
name game.
Well, the position "We are
people, not symbols," out
lined by the Stanford American
Indian Organization goes for
Asian Americans too. For that
matter, it should go for all
people.
Perhaps most alarming ot all
is the way Altenberg attempts
to gloss over the history of op
pression that Asians have faced
for over a century in this coun
try.
He talks about how Asians
"helped" Leland Stanford
build the railroad and finance
this university as if Stanford
and more than 10,000 Chinese
laborers were partners in some
heroic deed.
Let's not forget abodit the
super-exploitation of the
Chinese workers and the fierce
resistance that they waged in
terms of strikes and other work
stoppages.
Let's not forget that after the
railroads were done, Leland
Stanford as Governor and Un
ited States Senator "rail
roaded" his Chinese "friends"
with his leadership in the
anti-Chinese movement in the
1880s.
More generally, Asians, as
other Third World people,
have had to face an assortment
of racist legislation, violent at
tacks on their attempts to or
ganize themselves in the
workplace and the community,
and many other ugly aspects of
national oppression.
And yet, Altenberg and
those pushing for the return of
Chief Lightfoot would heap on
Third World people this added
abuse.
One final point though is
that it is true that Asian people
have been proud and courage
ous, most particularly in the
face of right-wing reaction.
Japanese Americans resisted
the repression of the World
War II concentration camps
and were the most decorated
of all on the battlefields of
Europe in fighting Hitlerite fas
cism.
Some people have

suggested that perhaps the
political forces financing and
promoting the "Bring Back
Chief Lightfoot" campaign
might have sympathies in
common with right-wing con
servatism.
Let's examine the situation a
little closer and find out where
these folks are coming from.

Mascot issue
'ludicrous'
Ludicrous. This is the best
word I can think of to describe
the whole mascot issue. I have
had a hard time believing that
such a trivial issue has reached
these proportions.
I see no need for Stanford to
even have a mascot.ls it ana
priori truth that all schools
must have a symbol, or do
people want one just because
every other school has one?
As far as I can see, the best
thing about a mascot is that
other schools can caricature it,
sing dirty songs about it, or (as
in the case of poor Tommy Tro
jan) throw bags of flour at it.
Certainly a mascot would not
enhance Stanford, its image, or
any of its teams.
What is wrong with simply
rallying behind a winning and
gutsy football team, a nation
ally ranked soccer team or a
championship tennis or water
polo team?
In the post-game celebra
tions of the last two weeks the
student body was united by a
much stronger bond than any
mascot could provide — the
pride of going to a great and
winning university.

'Chief' causes harm
At the risk of extending a
minor matter beyond its useful
life, we want to offer these
brief comments on "Chief"
Lightfoot's appearance at the
UCLA game.
First, our faith in under
graduate taste at Stanford is in
tact. The chilly tolerance that
characterized the majority
reaction in the rooting section
was, it seemed to us, just about
right.
But it is important to re
memberthat tolerance is not in
finite, and the sensitivities as
sociated with this issue are
serious enough to demand that
one look beneath the admira
bly casual reaction of Satur
day's crowd.
Legitimate outrage is not li
mited to the Native Americans
who are part of this commun
ity, nor to the other minority
students and faculty who
perhaps best understand this

assault on their dignity.
We share it, and we believe
that the vast majority of Stan
ford people do as well.
For that reason we urge
Timm Williams and those who
are promoting the "bring back
the Indian" effort to consider
the damage they may inflict on
values about which' they as well
as we care very much.

Haste makes waste
Haste makes waste. That
tired old cliche may not carry as
much meaning as it once did,
but in light of Lisa Burns' col
umn (Daily, Oct. 16), it should
be remembered.
Burns advocated an im
mediate decision regarding
Stanford's mascot. I think this
is unwise.
None of the choices we pre
sently are faced with are satis
factory to a majority of stu
dents, administrators, athletes
or alumni. For that reason
alone, it would be not only
wrong, but impossible to
"choose a mascot im
mediately."
I agree with Burns that
the mascot issue can no longer
be considered trivial, and I
applaud the University's deci
sion to keep Timm Williams
from entering the field.
But to believe that the mas
cot itself is not important, so
long as "one is chosen," is not
a responsible way of thinking.
Reaching back in my bag of
cliches, I'd like to leave the
reader with another one.
Necessity is the mother of in
vention. The need for a mascot
is apparent.
But why don't we just settle
for being known as a color until
the right mascot is introduced?
Perhaps the cast of the Big
Came Gaieties will offer us
another interesting solution
again this year. Let's hope so.

S.F. crazies
In reference to Kathleen
McClung's letter "Crazy S.F. "
(Daily, Oct. 12), I would like to
defend the "city ftf crazies."
The sniper return ! toby
McClung was, in fact, not from
San Francisco, but trom Los
Angeles — he did not emerge
from any part of TheCity. Thus,
the "characters (who) are
harmless kooks" in San Fran
cisco are just that for the most
part.
As far as that goes, there are
always some "harmless kooks"
in every city. It is only once in a
great while tha4 a harmful kook
comes along and commits a
crime such as that of the San
Francisco sniper.
As illustrated by the S.F. situ
ation, these dangerous and
mentally ill criminals, because
they do not usually reside in
the area in which they commit
their crime, can strike any
where.
For that reason, if
McClung thinks that Los
Angeles or New York or Detroit
or any big city is any safer than
San Francisco, I think she will
be doing a lot of crying she
didn't expect to do in any of
these "safe" cities.

CroMem prejudice
This letter is about discrimi
nation. As I scan these pages
every day, I see minority after
oppressed minority pleading
their cases.
I now feel obligated to bring
to light a case of blatant dis
crimination against an oppres
sed group of human beings.
Who are these poor souls
shunned by all; ignored by the
band on Monday night;
laughed at by only marginally
attractive freshman women;
snubbed by only slightly cuter
upperclass coeds? Who are
these untouchables, these
outcasts from the Stanford
community?
To be a member of this
group is to endure injustice
and repression. Wherever they
go, prejudice and hatred are
met.
Well, these poor souls are
the residents of Crothers
Memorial Hall. Yes, you read
that right: Cro Mem.
You might be thinking:
"Hey, they're only graduate
engineering students (nurds,
sweeps, strange-o's, perverts,
Frenchmen, and EE's). They
don't deserve human rights."
Well the time has come for
Cro Mems to be recognized for
the warm, intelligent and
amazingly cool guys they are.
lust pick up your head from
this paper and look around.
Chances are one of these
cool guys is within sight. Why

don't you go up to him and say
"Hi!" He'd really appreciate it
and you'll feeC better too, by
fighting prejudice and dis
crimination at Stanford.

One track mind
I would like to apologize to
Dan Rath (Daily, Oct. 12) tor all
of my sins. Yes, I admit it. . . I
am one of those females who,
without shame, "puts food just
beyond the reach of a starving
animal."
I did not once consider that it
would be in the eighties at the
last football game I attended.
Nor did I stop to think that
my more conservative clothes
might be a little too constrict
ing to wear to an event which
includes much jumping and
leaping about.
No, I must confess that I
picked out my game attire with
just one thought in mind. With
malice aforethought, I set out
to drive men insane. (Or, at
least, to cause "lustful
thoughts.")
I think that Rath ought to
spend more time in a coed
dorm, interacting with women
on a more human basis. Maybe
then, he would be able to peel
his eyes off shorts and tank
tops.
Or maybe he could volun
teer to buy all of the women on
campus Eskimo suits. That
would surely alleviate the cor
ruption of his mind at football
games, or in White Plaza.

Women's pain
I wasn't going to write this
letter. It's a reaction to Dan
Rath's letter (Daily Oct. 12). To
properly respond, I had to
force myself to reread his let
ter, and reacquainting my
mind with that uncaring view
point, indifferent to a women's
essential worth, was painful.
The pain first comes when a
woman realizes, even before
high school, that no matter
who she is or what she does
well, no matter what talent and
personal creativity she has, she
will throughout her life be
judged mainly on her appear
ance.
The "body first" view
wouldn't harm us if we could
stay indifferent to how others
judged us. But the human need
for peer approval precludes a
completely subjective estimate
of self-worth.
So, programmed from an
early age, we develop stupid
little defense mechanisms.

Don't raise your hand often in
class; people might find out
you can think. Wear tight jeans
so they'll overlook the calculus
text you carry.
Better, take English or art.
(Don't otfend stereotypes — it
threatens society's stability).
Dress like a helpless female;
people won't expect much
from you.
On to college, where your
grandmother thinks you'll
catch a rich husband. Your
mother's friends shake their
heads and wonder how you'll
ever "get a man."
The women themselves have
been brainwashed to the point
that their priority sense distorts
your own.
Yet something in you tries to
scream,"l'm a person, in my
own right! I don't need a man
over me to justify my exis
tence."
But if you don't conform,
aren't continually attached to
some guy by a psychological
umbilicus, you're not "inde
pendent." The label is "shy" or
"weird."
So you play the game, your
Ambitions and dreams trampled
in his self interest when you ti
nally meet Mr. Necessary.
Then you're married,
struggling to reconcile a career
with baby-sitting, curlers in the
grocery store and broken nails
at the office bearing witness
that men are still more in

terested in an airheaded orna
ment than in a caring individual
with a mind of her own.

Rainbow removal
On Oct. 10, the Daily pub
lished an editorial entitled
"Rainbow was art," criticizing
the University's demands that
Alpha Delta Phi paint over their
rainbow mural. Calling the
University's action". . .at its
best a pompons display of
power and at its worst, a blat
ant disregard for a legitimate
work of art," the Daily ignores
the primary rationale for the
decision.
It doesn't require much im
agination to picture what the
campus would look like if
every dorm, office and group
decided to adorn its walls with
their own work of art.
To write off the fact that no
prior approval was received
and to justify the mural's exis
tence because of a subjective
dislike for the architecture of
the house is ludicrous.
The University has made an
extraordinary effort over the
years to preserve the beauty
and cohesiveness of the Stan
ford campus.
Was the rainbow art? I don't
think that is the issue.
