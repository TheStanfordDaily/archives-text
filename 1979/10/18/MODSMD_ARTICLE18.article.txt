## Clash: Loud, loose kings of punk take charge 
### 
Punk rock. And everyone
gets immediate visions of
leather-clad, violent demons
with safety pins through their
cheeks and gross, violent
thoughts on their minds.
Armed with the preconception
that this image couldn't be the
whole story, I experienced a
sensory overload last weekend
at my first punk-rock festival.
Kezar Pavilion. An old, old
basketball gym set near Gol
den Gate Park's Panhandle.
Haight Ashbury 12 years after
the Summer of Love.
The Punks. Full costume vis
ible only on about one-third of
the crowd. Most of the other
line-builders waiting to get in
wore Uncle Sam-approved clo
thing. A surprising number of
high school kids with dates.
Ihe Revolutionaries. De
ployed strategically, hitting the
line-builders from the broad
side with all manner of verbal
propaganda: Will I be taking
orders or will I be taking over?
The Clash want revolution,
they said, but the procession
wasn't buying it.

The Show. The first band, a
group called the Rebels,
played a curious mixture of
punk and rockabilly. Spent a
lot of time playing single notes
or chords over and over. The
lead guitarist wishing he was
Chuck Berry and the vocalist
wishing he was Elvis Presley.
The Dead Kennedys. That
was the name of the second
band. Not the highlight of the
evening, but definitely the
pleasant surprise. Music was
too loud to discern any but a
few lyrics. By the end of the
evening, I was used to that. I
don't really understand why
punk groups play all but one
(the human voice) of their in
struments so loud that you
can't hear a thing they're say
ing.
Dead Kennedy lead singer
Jello Biafra oozed all over the
stage. Gesturing, pantomim
ing, all very theatrical. His sing
ing was excellent.
lello Biafra. An official can
didate for the mayorality of the
City by the Bay. No bullshit. He
wasn't screwing around when

he cast his body into the
crowd, singing a song as he
was lifted and dropped and
hung upside down and passed
around above everybody's
head and, finally, bereft of any
clothing whatsoever, washed
astage by a tide of friendly
hands. He performed the rest
of the show concealing no
thing.
The Cramps. Not deserving
of the publicity they're getting
— which is fortunately very lit
tle. Where Biafra and his
cohorts were real and even
captivating, The Cramps were
an animated, two-dimensional
joke. And while the music has a
little more garnish in the recipe
than the average punk fare, it
leaves an awful taste in the
mouth.
The Wait. The excitement
Biafra created had the die
hards pogoing wildly on the
wooden floor. The shock
waves had the speaker col
umns rocking and a bank of
floodlights swaying like the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge. They
had to take it down, and setting

it back up again took time.
Even then, they only raised the
bank halfway up the support
poles.
The Clash. Finally, just be
fore 11:30, ears were punished
with the loudest onslaught of
the evening. Joe Strummer
screamed into "Safe European
Home" from the group's first
album. It was impossible to de
cipher the lyrics above the wat
tage of guitars, drums and
bass. And throughout the per
formance, not infrequent
feedback whines caused many
assembled to cover their ears
or to scream. And, on the floor,
a rippling mass of humanity, all
popping up and down like a
boiling stew. Frenzied — even
the Uncle Sam-approveds.
The Clash tore through the
music. And if you could
metaphysically turn down the
volume at which your ears re
ceived the sound, you could
hear the mastery of how they
played. The Clash are out

standing musical technicians
and the lyrics of their songs
conjure up images of the
Who's "My Generation" and
the Jefferson Airplane's "Vol
unteers."
Though the sonic blurr still
lingers, The Clash put on an
excellent show. Raw energy
crackled from the stage as
punk's best representative
drove the crowd to a feverish
level. Songs such as "Com
plete Control," "White Man in
Hammersmith Palais," "Jail
Guitar Doors," "Clash City
Rockers" and"I Fought the
Law" will be long remembered
for their sheer power.
Mick jones' lead guitar solos
are a crisp, creative assault de
livered sparingly between, and
sometimes over, Strummer's
crashing rhythms — them
selves much more than three
chord scratchings.
The Clash is easily the best
punk has to offer.
