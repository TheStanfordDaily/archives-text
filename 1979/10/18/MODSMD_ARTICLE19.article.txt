# Garcia's new band a hit
## 
### 
jerry Garcia brought his new
band to the Keystone Palo Alto
Sunday night and gave the
capacity crowd a mixture of the
old, the new and the surpris
ing. The band had made its
debut the week before in Ber
keley, but you'd never know
Sunday was only its second gig.
Many of the songs Garcia
performed had been done by
his old band, from which only
bassist |ohn Kahn remains. The
new four-piece group defi
nitely is more keyboard
oriented and, for the most
part, centers its new show
around Garcia. The absence of
Donna Godchaux hurt on a
couple of numbers as Garcia
ended up singing both lead
and background vocals.
Treat
Nevertheless, when the
band began the show with the
Grateful Dead classic.

"Sugaree," it was clear the full
house was in for a treat. Garcia
performed "Deal" and "They
Love Each Other," which
though they originally ap
peared on Garcia's solo al
bums, have become a part of
many Grateful Dead sets.
The show included music
from Garcia's solo albums.
"Russian Lullaby," from the
Garcia album, featured an im
pressive solo by Kahn. The
band closed the first set with
"I'll Take a Melody," from the
1976 Reflections. Garcia always
seems to do his closing song in
the first set so well that you
can't help but grow impatient
during the intermission.
The evening's two surprises
came when Garcia and the
band performed songs written
by other artists. In the first set,
Eric Clapton's "Alter Mid
night'' had the crowd dancing.
In the second set, Garcia sent

the whole club into awe with a
dazzling version of Bob Dylan's
"Positively Fourth Street." The
song featured the night's finest
guitar work.
Last notes
The show closed with a very
long version of )immy Cliff's
reggae classic, "The Harder
They Come." The biggest dis
appointment was the absence
of an encore. It was, however,
well into the morning when
Garcia struck his last note and
he most certainly had given the
audience its money's worth.
As the Grateful Dead's group
projects seem to become more
predictable, their solo efforts
become more unpredictable.
But as for jerry Garcia, he put it
best in "Shakedown
Street:
"Don t tell me this town ain 't
got no soul, you just gotta look
around."
