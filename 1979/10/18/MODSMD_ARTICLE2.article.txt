# Stargell leads Pirate triumph
## 
### 
Baltimore (AP) — Remarkable Willie
Stargell cracked a game-winning
two-run homer last night to give
Pittsburgh a 4-1 triumph over the Bal
timore Orioles and make the Pirates
only the fourth team to overcome a
3-1 game deficit and take a best-of
seven World Series.
Stargell, known affectionately as
"Pops" by the rest of the Pirates, put
the third of his four hits for the night
over his team's bullpen in the sixth
inning for his third homer of the 1979
Series.
Stargell unloaded against left
hander Scott McGregor, who
pitched a courageous game in defeat
for the Orioles.
In the ninth, Pittsburgh added two
wrapup runs, against a parade of five
Baltimore relief pitchers.
Phil Garner opened with a double
to left — his 12th hit of the Series —
and scored on Omar Moreno's third
hit of the game.
A single by Tim Foli moved
Moreno to third and then Dave
Parker and Bill Robinson were hit by
pitches, forcing home the final Pi
rates run.
Pittsburgh's historic comeback
from the 3-1 deficit matched the ac
complishment of their 1925 club that
came back against the Washington
Senators, the Detroit Tigers against
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1968 and
the New York Yankees against the
Milwaukee Braves in 1958.
The Boston Red Sox did it against
Pittsburgh in 1903, when the Series
was best-of- nine.
McGregor nursed a 1-0 lead
through the first five innings, a lead
provided by a third-inning home run
by Rich Dauer that set off a long, loud
celebration by the crowd of 53,733
that included President Jimmy Carter
and Speaker of the House Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill.
MgGregor opened the sixth by re
tiring dangerous Parker on a roller to
second. That brought up Robinson,
who bats cleanup in Manager Chuck

Tanner's lineup against left-handers
but sits on the bench against righties.
Robinson ripped a single past
shortstop Kiko Garcia, bringing
Stargell to the plate.
Willie the Wonder Man wasted no
time. He jumped on the first pitch
from McGregor and sent it soaring
high and far into the night.
The Pirate dugout emptied to wel
come Stargell with hugs much like
those a family might use for a father
returning home after a day at the of
fice.
It was Stargell who also scored the
winning run in the final game of the
1971 Series, a seven-game showcase
for the late Roberto Clemente. But
1979 belonged to "Pops," who was
named the Series' most valuable
player.
Stargell sparked his club with a re
cord seven extra-base hits, four dou
bles and the three home runs, in this
World Series. His 25 total bases tied
the series record set by Reggie
lackson in 1977.
The Pirates' fifth World Series
championship did not come easily.
First they had to overcome Dauer's
early homer. The Orioles' second
baseman had only nine all season
and 20 in his three years with Balti
more, but he reached Pittsburgh
starter Jim Bibby for a shot into the
left field bleachers on the first pitch
of the third inning.
Bibby was the first of four Pirates
pitchers. He left for a pinch hitter in
the fifth and when reliever Don
Robinson got in trouble with two out
in the Baltimore fifth, left-hander
Grant Jackson came on to end the
inning.
Jackson worked into the eighth,
and with one out, pinch-hitter Lee
May walked and then — as the crowd
rocked the stadium, urging their
Birds on — Al Bumbry worked out
another walk.
Jackson hadn't allowed a hit yet,
but Tanner decided it was time for

the lanky Kent Tekulve.
The sidewinding right-hander al
ready had two saves in the Series,
and had pitched three innings the
night before in Game Six. But he was
back again.
First he faced pinch-hitter Terry
Crowley, whose two-run double had
beaten him in Game Four — the last
time the Orioles won in this Series.
He got Crowley on a roller to second
as the runners advanced.
Ken Singleton, who had 10 hits in
the Series, was next and the Pirates
walked him intentionally, loading
the bases.
That brought up Eddie Murray,
who epitomized the Baltimore
slump. Going into Game Seven he
was locked in an 0-for-17 nightmare
and he stretched it to 0-tor-20.
Murray fouled off the first two
pitches and then Tekulve tried to get
him to bite at a pair of outside de
liveries. The Oriole cleanup man laid
off them, running the count to 2-2.
Then he sent a fly to right field.
Parker started in on the ball, then
staggered back and caught it one
handed, ending the inning.
That left only the ninth for the Pi
rates to pad their lead and leave it to
Tekulve to finish the Orioles off.
Disappointed Orioles fans began
to stream out of the stadium mo
ments before the Pirates clinched
their title as Tekulve struck out Gary
Roenicke and Doug DeCinces, then
got pinch-hitter Pat Kelly to loft a
Series-ending fly ball to Omar
Moreno in center field.

off them, running the count to 2-2.
Then he sent a fly to right field.
Parker started in on the ball, then
staggered back and caught it one
handed, ending the inning.
That left only the ninth for the Pi
rates to pad their lead and leave it to
Tekulve to finish the Orioles off.
Disappointed Orioles fans began
to stream out of the stadium mo
ments before the Pirates clinched
their title as Tekulve struck out Gary
Roenicke and Doug DeCinces, then
got pinch-hitter Pat Kelly to loft a
Series-ending fly ball to Omar
Moreno in center field.
Baltimore (AP) — Remarkable Willie
Stargell cracked a game-winning
two-run homer last night to give
Pittsburgh a 4-1 triumph over the Bal
timore Orioles and make the Pirates
only the fourth team to overcome a
3-1 game deficit and take a best-of
seven World Series.
Stargell, known affectionately as
"Pops" by the rest of the Pirates, put
the third of his four hits for the night
over his team's bullpen in the sixth
inning for his third homer of the 1979
Series.
Stargell unloaded against left
hander Scott McGregor, who
pitched a courageous game in defeat
for the Orioles.
In the ninth, Pittsburgh added two
wrapup runs, against a parade of five
Baltimore relief pitchers.
Phil Garner opened with a double
to left — his 12th hit of the Series —
and scored on Omar Moreno's third
hit of the game.
A single by Tim Foli moved
Moreno to third and then Dave
Parker and Bill Robinson were hit by
pitches, forcing home the final Pi
rates run.
Pittsburgh's historic comeback
from the 3-1 deficit matched the ac
complishment of their 1925 club that
came back against the Washington
Senators, the Detroit Tigers against
the St. Louis Cardinals in 1968 and
the New York Yankees against the
Milwaukee Braves in 1958.
The Boston Red Sox did it against
Pittsburgh in 1903, when the Series
was best-of- nine.
McGregor nursed a 1-0 lead
through the first five innings, a lead
provided by a third-inning home run
by Rich Dauer that set off a long, loud
celebration by the crowd of 53,733
that included President Jimmy Carter
and Speaker of the House Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill.
MgGregor opened the sixth by re
tiring dangerous Parker on a roller to
second. That brought up Robinson,
who bats cleanup in Manager Chuck

Tanner's lineup against left-handers
but sits on the bench against righties.
Robinson ripped a single past
shortstop Kiko Garcia, bringing
Stargell to the plate.
Willie the Wonder Man wasted no
time. He jumped on the first pitch
from McGregor and sent it soaring
high and far into the night.
The Pirate dugout emptied to wel
come Stargell with hugs much like
those a family might use for a father
returning home after a day at the of
fice.
It was Stargell who also scored the
winning run in the final game of the
1971 Series, a seven-game showcase
for the late Roberto Clemente. But
1979 belonged to "Pops," who was
named the Series' most valuable
player.
Stargell sparked his club with a re
cord seven extra-base hits, four dou
bles and the three home runs, in this
World Series. His 25 total bases tied
the series record set by Reggie
lackson in 1977.
The Pirates' fifth World Series
championship did not come easily.
First they had to overcome Dauer's
early homer. The Orioles' second
baseman had only nine all season
and 20 in his three years with Balti
more, but he reached Pittsburgh
starter Jim Bibby for a shot into the
left field bleachers on the first pitch
of the third inning.
Bibby was the first of four Pirates
pitchers. He left for a pinch hitter in
the fifth and when reliever Don
Robinson got in trouble with two out
in the Baltimore fifth, left-hander
Grant Jackson came on to end the
inning.
Jackson worked into the eighth,
and with one out, pinch-hitter Lee
May walked and then — as the crowd
rocked the stadium, urging their
Birds on — Al Bumbry worked out
another walk.
Jackson hadn't allowed a hit yet,
but Tanner decided it was time for

the lanky Kent Tekulve.
The sidewinding right-hander al
ready had two saves in the Series,
and had pitched three innings the
night before in Game Six. But he was
back again.
First he faced pinch-hitter Terry
Crowley, whose two-run double had
beaten him in Game Four — the last
time the Orioles won in this Series.
He got Crowley on a roller to second
as the runners advanced.
Ken Singleton, who had 10 hits in
the Series, was next and the Pirates
walked him intentionally, loading
the bases.
That brought up Eddie Murray,
who epitomized the Baltimore
slump. Going into Game Seven he
was locked in an 0-for-17 nightmare
and he stretched it to 0-tor-20.
Murray fouled off the first two
pitches and then Tekulve tried to get
him to bite at a pair of outside de
liveries. The Oriole cleanup man laid
off them, running the count to 2-2.
Then he sent a fly to right field.
Parker started in on the ball, then
staggered back and caught it one
handed, ending the inning.
