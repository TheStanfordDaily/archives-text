# Short works at Cinematheque
## 
### 
Greg Schitfner's short
films will be featured in the
third presentation of the
Stanford Cinematheque, 8
p.m. tomorrow upstairs at
Tresidder.
Schiffner employs a pro
vocative variety of cinematic
techniques to combine
abstraction and reality.
On the bill will be a col
lection of his experimental
works, including Short Ends
and Short Ends 11. In Inner
City, he transforms city
lights into a dazzling array of
manipulative camera
techniques.
The Cinematheque offers

"out-of-t he-mainstream"
films, according to or
ganizer leffrey Kimball.
Animation, shorts, experi
mental, documentary and
obscure foreign movies
make up most of the prog
rams.

tinue with a "Classic Hor
ror" night, Oct. 26, featur

films, and Vampyr (1931).

of Bruce Baillie and Bruce
Conner. Baillie works with a

cinematic language of im

editing old movie tootage
into powerful pieces on
contemporary culture.

documentary accounts of
the American military sys
