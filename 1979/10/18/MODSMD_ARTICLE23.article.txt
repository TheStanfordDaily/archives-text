# Ragtime rolls for Lively Arts
## 
### 
Q What do sour cream, the
sound of jazz, picnics, sym
phonies and a sold-out Mem
Aud have in common?
A. The Lively Arts at Stan
ford.
Although the Lively Arts
sponsored the San Francisco
Symphony's picnic concert
earlier this month, the grand
opening of this year's 10th an
niversary season was last Friday
when the New England Con
servatory Ragtime Ensemble
played in a packed Mem Aud.
The ensemble opened the
concert with a lively perfor
mance of Scott joplin's "Maple
Leaf Rag." Conductor Gunther
Schuller paused between
pieces to give titles of works, as
well as an entertaining history
of ragtime.
"Ragtime was originally writ
ten for the piano by black
musicians in bordellos. As it
gained acceptance in more re
spectable parlors, it was or
chestrated for mini
symphonies and given elegant
titles, usually taken from things
in nature." So saying, Schuller
launched into Joplin's
"Peacharine," "Sugar Cane,''
and "Pineapple" rags and the
"Sunflower Slow Drag."
The "Peacharine Rag" fea-

tured the first of many excel
lent piccolo solos by Stephanie
Jutt, whose skill and en
thusiasm made her the best of
the evening's soloists.
Ragtime originated in the
march, so after the first bois
terous rags, it was a relief to
hear the slower-paced
"Pineapple." A well-known
piece from The Sting, it con
tained some beautifully lyrical
passages using the strings and
a banjo without the usual drum
background.
The "Sunflower Slow Drag"
was another change of pace.
The slow drag was a dance
done to ragtime music, and
this one was written at the be
ginning of the jazz era. The
piece ended with a wonderful
crescendo at the end ot which
the entire brass section rose
and "soloed."
Jelly Roll Morton's
"Smokehouse Blues" was
another of the early jazz
pieces. It used only the brass,
percussion and piano. This
piece also had a deliciously sul
try trombone solo by Dan San
ders.
The last song before inter
mission was Morton's
"Grandpa Spells" with a very
theatrical pianist-versus-piano

solo by Chris O'Riley, and a
rowdy trumpet using the wawa
mute.
Highlights of the second half
included the crowd-pleasing
opener, "The Entertainer,"
and the "Ragtime Nightin
gale," one of Joseph Lem's
tone poems in ragtime. The
"Nightingale" was charac
terized by its different textures
and colors of sound, created
by the xylophone, the strings'
pizzicato section and a flowing
cello passage.
After an interesting modern
work, "Twelve Note Rag"
based upon the 12-tone scale,
and Morton's "Black Bottom
Stomp," the ensemble closed
with a rag by James Europe,
"Castle Home Rag." At the
conclusion of this fast-paced
rag, which had a drum solo that
sounded like artillery fire, the
audience not only applauded
but cheered and rose to its

feet. Conductor Schuller re
turned and rewarded the
crowd with "just one more" —
"The Stars and Stripes in Rag."
It is difficult to play so much
ragtime without becoming
monotonous, yet the ensem
ble avoided this problem by
combining early march-like
rags and jazzy later ones. The
informally-clad musicians
seemed to enjoy playing as
much as the audience enjoyed
listening. The "toe
tappingness" of the music was
reflected in the bobbing heads
of the audience, and unfortu
nately in the feet of the players,
but otherwise there were few
faults in their performance.
Lively Arts managed to pre
serve the feeling just a little bit
longer by serving pretzels and
beer at their reception, as well
as giving out kazoos, balloons
and water pistols.
