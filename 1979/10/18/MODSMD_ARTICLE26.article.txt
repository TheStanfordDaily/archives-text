Feds rule treaty action improper
Washington — A federal judge ruled yesterday
that President Jimmy Carter acted improperly in
terminating the United States' mutual defense tre
aty with Taiwan without first getting congressional
approval.
U.S. District judge Oliver Casch ordered the
Carter administration to take no action to termi
nate the 25-year-old treaty unless the administra
tion received approval by two-thirds of the Senate
or a majority of both the House and the Senate.
Casch's ruling came in a suit brought by Sen.
Barry Coldwater, (R-Ariz.) and 23 other members
of Congress.
Coldwater hailed the ruling as the first time "in
the nation's almost 200 years of constitutional his
tory that a federal judge has ruled directly on the
power of treaty termination."
Coldwater said he hoped "the president will
now submit a proper request for legislative ap
proval of his policy on its merits, rather than con
tinue to battle Congress over an issue of Constitu
tional power."
When Carter announced Dec. 15 that he was
granting full diplomatic recognition to the
People's Republic of China, he also exercised an
option in the Taiwan defense treaty allowing either
party to terminate the pact on a year's notice.
The treaty, in which the United States agreed to
come to the aid of Taiwan in the event of an attack
by the mainland Chinese, would end Jan. 1,1980,
under Carter's timetable.
The State Department issued a statement saying
that it did not feel Casch's ruling would have "any
immediate effect on our relations with the
People's Republic of China."
4.1 quake jolts 5 Calif, counties
Los Angeles — A sharp earthquake measuring 4.1
on the Richter scale jolted a five-county area of
Southern California yesterday, rattling windows
and triggering several minor rockslides.
No reports of damage or injury were received.
The 1:52 p.m. tremor was centered in the Pacific
Ocean eight miles south of Malibu, said Melinda
Brinza of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
The quake was apparently unrelated to Mon
day's 6.4-magnitude earthquake that devastated
portions of the Imperial Valley 150 miles south
east. It was not felt along the Mexican border,
where Monday's quake was centered.
Caltech seismologists said the quake may have
been an aftershock of the Malibu quake last New

Year's Day, which registered 4.6 on the Richter
scale.
"There was a sudden jolt, like a truck had run
into the side of the building right hereon the ninth
floor," said banker John Hainer, who was at work
in a downtown high-rise.
Several minor rockslides were reported near the
tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road, deputies said. But
the highway remained open.
"My whole house was shaking. I thought the
windows were about to fall out," said Culver City
resident Denise Holt. "I haven't felt one like that in
ages. It lasted a good five or 10 seconds."
General Telephone, which serves the Malibu-
Santa Monica area, said phone service in the area
was momentarily overloaded when too many ex
cited residents tried to dial at the same time follow
ing the tremor, said company spokesman Chuck
Halloran.
The quake was felt as far away as San Bernadino
and Riverside, 70 miles east, as well as in Orange
and Ventura.
CIA predicts return of gas lines
Washington — Gasoline lines have disappeared
only temporarily and will return, along with major
oil shortages, once the nation emerges from its
current economic downturn, the CIA predicted
yesterday.
The real crunch probably will come in 1981 or
1982, a CIA official told a House Intelligence sub
comittee. Prices will continue their upward spiral
unabated, testified Maurice Ernst, director of the
ClA's office of economic research.
Roger Glassey, assistant administrator of the
Energy Information Agency, told the subcommit
tee that world oil prices, which have increased 60
percent to around $20 a barrel in the past year,
could soar to $52 a barrel by 1995 — based on the
current value of the dollar.
Ernst said the CIA found that "the outlook for
world oil supply is dim."
"Although oil shortages have disappeared in re
cent months, they are likely to reappear during the
upswing of the next business cycle — perhaps in
1981 or 1982," Ernst testified.
"Thus . . . the world does not have years in
which to make a smooth transition to alternative
energy sources," he said.
Ernst said U.S. production already has begun to
decline markedly and he held out little hopes of
reversing the trend.
The situation is equally bleak in other producing
nations — both members and nonmembers of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

El Salvador still tense after coup
San Salvador, El Salvador — Army troops killed at
least six leftist protestors yesterday during a five
hour gun battle in a mountain town near tne capi
tal, witnesses reported. It was the second day of
fighting following Monday night's overthrow of
the right-wing government by members of the
military.
Only hours before the latest fighting erupted,
leaders of the new military government claimed
their coup had prevented a popular uprising and
"a sea of blood" in the Central American nation.
However, sources within three major leftist or
ganizations said Wednesday that their groups
would not accept the new government and would
continue their fight.
Witnesses said the six persons killed belonged
to a group that had put up barricades at the town's
entrance earlier in the day. The same witnesses
said leftists in the town were still in control of the
city hall, the church and other buildings.
There was no official confirmation that the
troops had fired on the protesters.
Monday's coup toppled the rightist gov
ernment of Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero,
whose regime was the target of mounting leftist
violence.
The new leaders appealed for calm and recon
ciliation in the divided nation, but moved quickly
on Tuesday to crush a series of leftist disturbances
in towns near the capital.

El Salvador still tense after coup
San Salvador, El Salvador — Army troops killed at
least six leftist protestors yesterday during a five
hour gun battle in a mountain town near tne capi
tal, witnesses reported. It was the second day of
fighting following Monday night's overthrow of
the right-wing government by members of the
military.
Only hours before the latest fighting erupted,
leaders of the new military government claimed
their coup had prevented a popular uprising and
"a sea of blood" in the Central American nation.
However, sources within three major leftist or
ganizations said Wednesday that their groups
would not accept the new government and would
continue their fight.
Witnesses said the six persons killed belonged
to a group that had put up barricades at the town's
entrance earlier in the day. The same witnesses
said leftists in the town were still in control of the
city hall, the church and other buildings.
There was no official confirmation that the
troops had fired on the protesters.
Monday's coup toppled the rightist gov
ernment of Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero,
whose regime was the target of mounting leftist
violence.
The new leaders appealed for calm and recon
ciliation in the divided nation, but moved quickly
on Tuesday to crush a series of leftist disturbances
in towns near the capital.

Feds rule treaty action improper
Washington — A federal judge ruled yesterday
that President Jimmy Carter acted improperly in
terminating the United States' mutual defense tre
aty with Taiwan without first getting congressional
approval.
U.S. District judge Oliver Casch ordered the
Carter administration to take no action to termi
nate the 25-year-old treaty unless the administra
tion received approval by two-thirds of the Senate
or a majority of both the House and the Senate.
Casch's ruling came in a suit brought by Sen.
Barry Coldwater, (R-Ariz.) and 23 other members
of Congress.
Coldwater hailed the ruling as the first time "in
the nation's almost 200 years of constitutional his
tory that a federal judge has ruled directly on the
power of treaty termination."
Coldwater said he hoped "the president will
now submit a proper request for legislative ap
proval of his policy on its merits, rather than con
tinue to battle Congress over an issue of Constitu
tional power."
When Carter announced Dec. 15 that he was
granting full diplomatic recognition to the
People's Republic of China, he also exercised an
option in the Taiwan defense treaty allowing either
party to terminate the pact on a year's notice.
The treaty, in which the United States agreed to
come to the aid of Taiwan in the event of an attack
by the mainland Chinese, would end Jan. 1,1980,
under Carter's timetable.
The State Department issued a statement saying
that it did not feel Casch's ruling would have "any
immediate effect on our relations with the
People's Republic of China."
4.1 quake jolts 5 Calif, counties
Los Angeles — A sharp earthquake measuring 4.1
on the Richter scale jolted a five-county area of
Southern California yesterday, rattling windows
and triggering several minor rockslides.
No reports of damage or injury were received.
The 1:52 p.m. tremor was centered in the Pacific
Ocean eight miles south of Malibu, said Melinda
Brinza of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena.
The quake was apparently unrelated to Mon
day's 6.4-magnitude earthquake that devastated
portions of the Imperial Valley 150 miles south
east. It was not felt along the Mexican border,
where Monday's quake was centered.
Caltech seismologists said the quake may have
been an aftershock of the Malibu quake last New

Year's Day, which registered 4.6 on the Richter
scale.
"There was a sudden jolt, like a truck had run
into the side of the building right hereon the ninth
floor," said banker John Hainer, who was at work
in a downtown high-rise.
Several minor rockslides were reported near the
tunnel on Malibu Canyon Road, deputies said. But
the highway remained open.
"My whole house was shaking. I thought the
windows were about to fall out," said Culver City
resident Denise Holt. "I haven't felt one like that in
ages. It lasted a good five or 10 seconds."
General Telephone, which serves the Malibu-
Santa Monica area, said phone service in the area
was momentarily overloaded when too many ex
cited residents tried to dial at the same time follow
ing the tremor, said company spokesman Chuck
Halloran.
The quake was felt as far away as San Bernadino
and Riverside, 70 miles east, as well as in Orange
and Ventura.
CIA predicts return of gas lines
Washington — Gasoline lines have disappeared
only temporarily and will return, along with major
oil shortages, once the nation emerges from its
current economic downturn, the CIA predicted
yesterday.
The real crunch probably will come in 1981 or
1982, a CIA official told a House Intelligence sub
comittee. Prices will continue their upward spiral
unabated, testified Maurice Ernst, director of the
ClA's office of economic research.
Roger Glassey, assistant administrator of the
Energy Information Agency, told the subcommit
tee that world oil prices, which have increased 60
percent to around $20 a barrel in the past year,
could soar to $52 a barrel by 1995 — based on the
current value of the dollar.
Ernst said the CIA found that "the outlook for
world oil supply is dim."
"Although oil shortages have disappeared in re
cent months, they are likely to reappear during the
upswing of the next business cycle — perhaps in
1981 or 1982," Ernst testified.
"Thus . . . the world does not have years in
which to make a smooth transition to alternative
