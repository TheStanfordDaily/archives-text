# Stanford SATs still high

The recent plunge in SAT scores of
students across the nation has not
affected Stanford students' scores,
said Fred Hargadon, dean of admis
sions. "I don't think Stanford
freshmen are getting 'dumber,' " he
said.
There has been no significant
change in the median SAT verbal and
math test scores of the entering
freshmen here over the past six
years, he added.
The relative consistency of the 1 av
erage scores of students here speaks
highly for Stanfordites, he added,
especially in view of the nationwide
decline.
A panel of education scientists this
year issued a lengthy report on de
clining scores. They did not pinpoint
any one cause or devise an explana
tion for the drop in scores, said Har
gadon.
The study attributed the fall to
many factors, he said.
Wide range
Among the causes it mentioned
were the impact of television, de
clines in high school English course
enrollment, the reduction in high
school homework loads, an increase
in the number of broken homes, and
the fact that a larger and more varied
group of high school students is tak

"I would certainly be concerned if
the SAT scores of our entering stu
dents dropped from the top of the
scale — where they are not — to the
bottom of it,"the dean said.
Private colleges and universities in
the East are making large gains in
selectivity, as measured by test
scores alone, according to a report
by Alexander Austin and Lewis Sol
omon of the Los Angeles Higher
Education Research Institute. Pub
lished in last month's issue of
Change magazine, the study said the
eastern institutions are enrolling a
higher ratio of the nation's top
freshmen.
Harvard outdraws
"Those eastern colleges and a
number of others, such as Stanford,
have always baen very popular
among bright students. Only one
college outdraws us in enrolling stu
dents both have accepted: Harvard.
And even there, a good many stu
dents accepted to both Harvard and
Stanford choose Stanford, ' Harga
don said.
He said he does not believe that the
Ivy League schools are "gaining in
popularity" among bright students.
"As long as we have the applicant
group we do and as long as we enroll
freshmen classes of the quality we
do, it really doesn't matter what hap
