# Stanford SATs still high
## 
### Lisa Adler 
The recent plunge in SAT scores of
students across the nation has not
affected Stanford students' scores,
said Fred Hargadon, dean of admis
sions. "I don't think Stanford
freshmen are getting 'dumber,' " he
said.
There has been no significant
change in the median SAT verbal and
math test scores of the entering
freshmen here over the past six
years, he added.
The relative consistency of the 1 av
erage scores of students here speaks
highly for Stanfordites, he added,
especially in view of the nationwide
decline.
A panel of education scientists this
year issued a lengthy report on de
clining scores. They did not pinpoint
any one cause or devise an explana
tion for the drop in scores, said Har
gadon.
The study attributed the fall to
many factors, he said.
Wide range
Among the causes it mentioned
were the impact of television, de
clines in high school English course
enrollment, the reduction in high
school homework loads, an increase
in the number of broken homes, and
the fact that a larger and more varied
group of high school students is tak
ing the tests, he added.

"I would certainly be concerned if
the SAT scores of our entering stu
dents dropped from the top of the
scale — where they are not — to the
bottom of it,"the dean said.
Private colleges and universities in
the East are making large gains in
selectivity, as measured by test
scores alone, according to a report
by Alexander Austin and Lewis Sol
omon of the Los Angeles Higher
Education Research Institute. Pub
lished in last month's issue of
Change magazine, the study said the
eastern institutions are enrolling a
higher ratio of the nation's top
freshmen.
Harvard outdraws
"Those eastern colleges and a
number of others, such as Stanford,
have always baen very popular
among bright students. Only one
college outdraws us in enrolling stu
dents both have accepted: Harvard.
And even there, a good many stu
dents accepted to both Harvard and
Stanford choose Stanford, ' Harga
don said.
He said he does not believe that the
Ivy League schools are "gaining in
popularity" among bright students.
"As long as we have the applicant
group we do and as long as we enroll
freshmen classes of the quality we
do, it really doesn't matter what hap
pens elsewhere," he added.
Stanford ranked 17th in the coun
try in 1976-77 in average freshman
scores, trailing Cal Tech, Harvard,
Yale, MIT and other schools. These,
the most recent rankings available,
were published in the Change arti
cle.
Article 'flimsy'
"The article which reported that
item is one of the flimsier pieces of
educational research I have ever
seen: it doesn't report the actual av
erages of any of the schools," said
Hargadon.
He also warned against equating
"selectivity" with "average test
scores" and said that perhaps some
colleges place greater weight on test
scores just to improve their "rank
ing."
"If nothing else, this study reveals
an abysmal lack of knowledge about
'selective admissions' in this coun
try. Actually, 'selectivity' may be a
matter of whom a college can afford
to turn down as much as it is a matter
of whom they take," Hargadon said.
Not only criterion
Test scores do not constitute Stan
ford's sole measure of selectivity, he
added. "If itdid,we'd just rank-order
all of our applicants by their test
scores and select from the top
down," said Hargadon.
Stanford places a substantial em
phasis on the courses a student has
taken in high school, achievements,
abilities, accomplishments outside
of the classroom and diversified ta
lents when deciding whom to admit,
he said.
The University had 11,787
freshman applicants for the Class of
1983 of whom 2450 were offered ad
mission. "We've had far more than
enough bright and able young men
and women to select from in recent
years," said Hargadon.

'selective admissions' in this coun
try. Actually, 'selectivity' may be a
matter of whom a college can afford
to turn down as much as it is a matter
of whom they take," Hargadon said.
Not only criterion
Test scores do not constitute Stan
ford's sole measure of selectivity, he
added. "If itdid,we'd just rank-order
all of our applicants by their test
scores and select from the top
down," said Hargadon.
Stanford places a substantial em
phasis on the courses a student has
taken in high school, achievements,
abilities, accomplishments outside
of the classroom and diversified ta
lents when deciding whom to admit,
he said.
The University had 11,787
freshman applicants for the Class of
1983 of whom 2450 were offered ad
mission. "We've had far more than
enough bright and able young men
and women to select from in recent
years," said Hargadon.
The recent plunge in SAT scores of
students across the nation has not
affected Stanford students' scores,
said Fred Hargadon, dean of admis
sions. "I don't think Stanford
freshmen are getting 'dumber,' " he
said.
There has been no significant
change in the median SAT verbal and
math test scores of the entering
freshmen here over the past six
years, he added.
The relative consistency of the 1 av
erage scores of students here speaks
highly for Stanfordites, he added,
especially in view of the nationwide
decline.
A panel of education scientists this
year issued a lengthy report on de
clining scores. They did not pinpoint
any one cause or devise an explana
tion for the drop in scores, said Har
gadon.
The study attributed the fall to
many factors, he said.
Wide range
Among the causes it mentioned
were the impact of television, de
clines in high school English course
enrollment, the reduction in high
school homework loads, an increase
in the number of broken homes, and
the fact that a larger and more varied
group of high school students is tak
ing the tests, he added.

"I would certainly be concerned if
the SAT scores of our entering stu
dents dropped from the top of the
scale — where they are not — to the
bottom of it,"the dean said.
Private colleges and universities in
the East are making large gains in
selectivity, as measured by test
scores alone, according to a report
by Alexander Austin and Lewis Sol
omon of the Los Angeles Higher
Education Research Institute. Pub
lished in last month's issue of
Change magazine, the study said the
eastern institutions are enrolling a
higher ratio of the nation's top
freshmen.
Harvard outdraws
"Those eastern colleges and a
number of others, such as Stanford,
have always baen very popular
among bright students. Only one
college outdraws us in enrolling stu
dents both have accepted: Harvard.
And even there, a good many stu
dents accepted to both Harvard and
Stanford choose Stanford, ' Harga
don said.
He said he does not believe that the
Ivy League schools are "gaining in
popularity" among bright students.
"As long as we have the applicant
group we do and as long as we enroll
freshmen classes of the quality we
do, it really doesn't matter what hap
pens elsewhere," he added.
Stanford ranked 17th in the coun
try in 1976-77 in average freshman
scores, trailing Cal Tech, Harvard,
Yale, MIT and other schools. These,
the most recent rankings available,
were published in the Change arti
cle.
Article 'flimsy'
"The article which reported that
item is one of the flimsier pieces of
educational research I have ever
seen: it doesn't report the actual av
erages of any of the schools," said
Hargadon.
He also warned against equating
"selectivity" with "average test
scores" and said that perhaps some
colleges place greater weight on test
scores just to improve their "rank
ing."
"If nothing else, this study reveals
an abysmal lack of knowledge about
'selective admissions' in this coun
try. Actually, 'selectivity' may be a
matter of whom a college can afford
to turn down as much as it is a matter
of whom they take," Hargadon said.

ford's sole measure of selectivity, he
added. "If itdid,we'd just rank-order
