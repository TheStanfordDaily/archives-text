# Testing may pose health hazard

The testing which involves various
chemical compounds at the Stanford
Industrial Park may be dangerous to
the health of residents in that area,
according to Gary Fazzino, Palo Alto
City Councilmember and chairman
of the Policy and Procedures Com
mittee.
Fazzino said a company "could test
just about anything" on the site.
Conceivably,, a "bombs manufac
turer could move into the area" and
conduct research without violating
the zoning laws, he added.
The site, which is zoned as a re
search/office park, drew wide atten
tion this summer when an equip
ment failure at Lockheed Missile
Company's Hanover Road facility on
Aug. 9 set off an explosion of 377
pounds of lithium, causing a fire and
release of a cloud of gas.
Residents evacuated
Because it was first feared that the
gas was hazardous to human health,
residents were evacuated from 60
local residences bordering the site.
Also, windows and the outside venti
lation system at the Palo Alto Vete
rans Hospital were closed.
It was later learned that the gas was
only a skin and eye irritant.
The Palo Alto Fire Department con
tained the fire by using a special
chemical that was on the site. When
the explosion occurred, the test
shack blew its top off because a spe
cial design prevented debris from
spewing laterally over the landscape.
27 feet away
The shack was located 27 feet from
adjacent private, residential prop
erty, despite a requirement that it be
50 feet away, according to George
Mulhern, director of public relations
for Lockheed.
Both the city and Lockheed over

looked the requirement when the
olans were submitted and approved
for the construction of the test build
ing, he said.
Lockheed has since closed down
the shack and will conduct the exper
iment involving lithium at another
site, according to Don Wallace of
Lockheed.
Despite this, other experiments
involving "dangerous materials" are
conducted by various firms in the
park, according to Naphtali Knox,
planning Hjrector for Palo Alto.
However, safety measures at the site
are extensive, he said.
Regular inspections
The Palo Alto Fire Department in
spects the site regularly and estab
lishes criteria for the use of poten
tially dangerous chemicals, accord
ing to Assistant Chief James
McLaughlin. "If something goes
wrong, and it always will," the fire
department should be able to handle
it, he said.

The department also makes re
commendations for site improve
ments to increase safety.
A study of the Lockheed explosion
by the city council looked into the
fire department's ability to respond
to accidents at the site, but it "didn't
focus on the question of hazardous
activities," said Vice Mayor Byron
Sher.
Issue unaddressed
The issue of testing hazardous
materials in close proximity to resi
dential areas has not been formally
addressed.
Fazzino said the council was
"groping" towards the problem, but
no formal study by the city is cur
rently underway.
Palo Alto City Manager William
Zaner has deemed the site "safe."
Terry Beham, spokesman for the
VA hospital located less than one
mile from the site, said he is "satis
fied with his neighbors" and fears no
hazard.
