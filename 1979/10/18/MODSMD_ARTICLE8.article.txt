# Children learn ecological awareness

Performing Indian rain ritu
als, learning how to cook
acorns, and "playing di
nosaur" — sound like a legiti
mate means for earning uni
versity credit? At the Hidden
Villa Environmental Project, it
is.
The Hidden Villa Project
seeks to increase the environ
mental and ecological aware
ness of local elementary school
children. Located in the footh
ills just beyond Los Altos, the
Hidden Villa Ranch presents
the ideal setting for such a pro
ject.
The ranch includes a farm
and an abundance of hiking
trails leading into the sur
rounding hills.
Local residents, mostly col
lege students from Stanford,
De Anza, San Jose State and
Foothill serve as guides and in
structors for the children. The
Human Biology program here
offers credit to students who
work at the ranch one day a
week during the quarter.

Through the use of slide
shows and talks at area
elementary schools, staff
members recruit second
through sixth graders to come
out to the ranch for two one
day sessions.
The Hidden Villa Environ
mental Project has some in
teresting goals and unique
methods. Some of the ac
tivities deal with explaining the
origin and eventual destination
of materials in the environ
ment.
"Most children think that
milk comes from Safeway,"
commented Kathy Anderson,
an intern at Hidden Villa. "The
children are enlightened when
they meet the farm animals."
Participants also analyze
their lunches to see if they've
brought any "trees" (paper
products) or "dinosaurs." Di
nosaurs, it is explained, died
and formed fossil deposits
which then became petroleum
products that, in the long run,
produced the plastic sandwich
bags.

Another activity includes de
vismgpossiblealternate means
of energy once all the di
nosaurs have been used up.
The guides also teach several
Indian principles to the chil
dren. Among these is the
"caretaker" idea that a person
never really owns the land but
merely takes care of it.
By means of group games
and Indian dances and rituals,
the children learn how to
cooperate with each other.
"The program is involved
with connecting a child to his
world," claims Lynne Stitzel,
one of the main coordinators
of the program.
The children learn not only
about the farm animals and the
forest, but also how these
things relate to the rest of their
environment. For instance, oc
casionally guides take groups
of children to the local super
market to see how many pro
ducts they can find that came
trom a farm or how many diffe
rent ways they can find a pig
packaged.

Judging from their reactions,
the guides at Hidden Villa gam
as much irom the experience
as the elementary schoolers.
Kathy Anderson, who
graduated from the University
last year with a degree in
Human Biology, was so en
thusiastic about being a guide
last year that she returned to
Hidden Villa this fall as an in
tern.
One San Jose State student
commented that the program
was "a great learning experi
ence."
Hidden Villa holds guide
training sessions twice a year,
once in the fall and once in the
winter. In order to become a
guide, one has to participate in
a series of training sessions.
The Hidden Villa Ranch was
purchased by the Duveneck
family about 50 years ago. In
the 1940'5, Mrs. Duveneck
started a multi-racial summer
camp at a time when such
thingswerealmost unheard of.
The camp still runs in the
summer, but with the rising
concern for ecology in the past
I 10 years, the Environmental
! Project has also been added.
| Funds for the project come
from the local elementary
schools and various grants and
donations.
A handbook for Hidden Villa
has just been published by
Pacific Gas and Electric. The ti
tle, reflective of one of the
central themes of the program
is Manure to Meadow to

a series of training sessions.

Youngsters work with volunteer "guides," learning about the environment through practical exploration
»n the ranch.
Performing Indian rain ritu
als, learning how to cook
acorns, and "playing di
nosaur" — sound like a legiti
mate means for earning uni
versity credit? At the Hidden
Villa Environmental Project, it
is.
The Hidden Villa Project
seeks to increase the environ
mental and ecological aware
ness of local elementary school
children. Located in the footh
ills just beyond Los Altos, the
Hidden Villa Ranch presents
the ideal setting for such a pro
ject.
The ranch includes a farm
and an abundance of hiking
trails leading into the sur
rounding hills.
Local residents, mostly col
lege students from Stanford,
De Anza, San Jose State and
Foothill serve as guides and in
structors for the children. The
Human Biology program here
offers credit to students who
work at the ranch one day a
week during the quarter.

Through the use of slide
shows and talks at area
elementary schools, staff
members recruit second
through sixth graders to come
out to the ranch for two one
day sessions.
The Hidden Villa Environ
mental Project has some in
teresting goals and unique
methods. Some of the ac
tivities deal with explaining the
origin and eventual destination
of materials in the environ
ment.
"Most children think that
milk comes from Safeway,"
commented Kathy Anderson,
an intern at Hidden Villa. "The
children are enlightened when
they meet the farm animals."
Participants also analyze
their lunches to see if they've
brought any "trees" (paper
products) or "dinosaurs." Di
nosaurs, it is explained, died
and formed fossil deposits
which then became petroleum
products that, in the long run,
produced the plastic sandwich
bags.

Another activity includes de
vismgpossiblealternate means
of energy once all the di
nosaurs have been used up.
The guides also teach several
Indian principles to the chil
dren. Among these is the
"caretaker" idea that a person
never really owns the land but
merely takes care of it.
By means of group games
and Indian dances and rituals,
the children learn how to
cooperate with each other.
"The program is involved
with connecting a child to his
world," claims Lynne Stitzel,
one of the main coordinators
of the program.
The children learn not only
about the farm animals and the
forest, but also how these
things relate to the rest of their
environment. For instance, oc
casionally guides take groups
of children to the local super
market to see how many pro
ducts they can find that came
trom a farm or how many diffe
rent ways they can find a pig
packaged.

Judging from their reactions,
the guides at Hidden Villa gam
as much irom the experience
as the elementary schoolers.
