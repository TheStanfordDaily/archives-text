Lie down
and
be counted.
P evident iimmy CaMer »ign#d up 51 tim^s
In America, 3% of the people
give 100% of all the blood
that's freely donated
Which means that if only 1 %
more people—maybe you—
became donors, it would add
over thirty percent more blood
to America's voluntary blood
stream. Think of it!
But forget arithmetic. Just
concentrate on one word.
The word is Easy.
Giving blood is easy. You
hardly feel it (in fact, some peo
ple say they feel better physi
cally after a blood donation).
And, of course, everybody
feels better emotionally.
Because it's a great feeling
knowing your one easy blood
donation has helped up to five
other people to live.
So how about it, 1 % of
America? Are you going to lie
down and be counted?
