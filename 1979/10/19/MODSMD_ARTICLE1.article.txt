# Big wave of voters carries slate candidates to victory
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
A record voter turnout of 28 percent of the entire
student body and 45.4 percent of all undergraduates
propelled slate candidates to victories in this week's
ASSU Senate elections.
[he election reform and lighted tennis court re
ferenda returns, as well as the fee assessment outcomes,
are as yet undetermined.
Because of "a few minor questions" and the necessity
to re-check preliminary figures, those totals will not be
available until next week, according to Elections Com
missioner Mike O'Reilly.
"We figured that people would be most interested in
the senate election and the mascot issue," he said, so
those results were tabulated first at the expense of the
other measures.
junior Renee Richards, a member of the Responsible
Action for Liberated Folks (RALF) slate, captured 688
votes to establish herself at the pinnacle of the crowded
undergraduate pile. Four of the nine remaining under
graduate winners also ran on slates.
Val Runge led his graduate slate to the top five posi
tions on the graduate side of the senate.
All announced results are tentative, pending official

certification of overseas ballots. Unofficial overseas
votes were obtained by Elections Commission members
by long-distance telephone and are included in the cur
rent provisional totals.
Foreign campus voting packets were mailed Oct. 9
and received by all centers except Florence. Florence
students voted yesterday morning on choices conveyed
over the telephone, and their decisions were relayed to
O'Reilly by 9:30 a.m. yesterday.
The actual ballots should arrive here next week, at
which time the election will be verified.
"I think that's just a formality," O'Reilly said, forese
eing no irregularities in election procedures.
The optimal scanner computer, used for the first time
to calculate results, was recommended to the commis
sion by Law Prof. )ohn Kaplan and contributed to better
documentation and a smoother election, O'Reilly said.
"I think voting was easier this year," he explained.
The computer system amassed a greater expense, but
costs were balanced by savings on paying human ballot
counters.
However, there were some problems with the com
puterized vote counting because of inexperience in
using the system, O'Reilly said:

The unprecedented turnout "really pleases me very
much," he said while attributing that phenomenon
to the "pretty high quality" of the candidates. He termed
the election "a positive response to the candidates,"
and, "a good first step for restoring the respectability
and credibility of the senate."
A large portion of her success could be ascribed to the
"joke vote," Richards admitted. " This can't be serious,'
a lot ot people said, but it's serious and here I am," she
added.
I want to get into action really fast and have plans to
start right off the bat," she said. "The Women's
Center and the mascot are my two priorities," she said,
but "the important thing is to start cooperating" and to
understand the concerns of all senators.
I want to get to know everyone else elected," she
added.
lunior T.J. Heyman, who independently gleaned the
second-place undergraduate spot with 655 votes,
echoed many of Richards' sentiments. "I'm naturally
pleased with the results, but, out of 60 energetic and
capable candidates, it's a shame a lot didn't make it,"he
said.
He cited a "couple of issues that I think the senators

can get together on right away," such as an amendment
to last year's Kingstone-Fremerman bill that would re
quire attendance in committees and the instatement.
a new special issues committee.
Heyman reiterated his campaign proposal to create
independent student task forces to involve other stu
dents in the decision-making process. "I think that there
are more than 10 competent people in this University,"
he stressed. "If every senator takes at least one inde
pendent task force, that will be a major accomplish
ment."
Heyman expressed his support of the Women's
Center, the Band and staggered elections. Although in
disagreement with the pre-election districting proposal,
"I'm looking forward to having a (post-election) dis
trict," he said.
"I think we'll get a lot done, and I'm kind of excited
about" the prospects," he said. "People take the elec
tion seriously, and I'm going to try my darndest to live up
to their expectations."
Richards promised, "We'll try and make meetings
more worthwhile." An orientation meeting for all
senators and alternates will be held in the ASSU lobby in
Tresidder at 7 p.m. Wed., Oct. 24.
