The topic of the week seems to be waiting tor
the Post Office:
Dear Bug Me,
Why is all the mail that is dropped at the Stan
ford Post Office (even for local Palo Alto deliv
ery) sent to San Francisco to be sorted first? Or is
this true? It just seems to take forever to receive
mail that goes through that office.
-DM
According to Manager Ron Sodlink, it is true
that mail goes to the City to be sorted. This is
done for all the cities on the Peninsula, even for
local mail. The reason is efficiency.
San Francisco has large mail sorting machines
which can work three times as fast as a clerk
doing the same job by hand. The Stanford Post
Office has no such facilities for sorting mail.
If you think the Stanford P.O. should save
transportation delays by sorting local mail by
hand, you obviously haven't waited in line there
recently. Here's a reader who has and isn't
pleased:
Is it my imagination or are the lines at the Post
Office longer than ever this year? I'm frustrated
because I often need stamps, and the machines
have been working only once (at least when I've
been there). Can the Post Office better maintain
the machines, or do something to let me write
my friends without waiting in a fifteen minute
linei
-Carl D.
Sodlink, who is temporarily working in Palo
Alto but has been to the Stanford office a
number of times, said that he doesn't think (he
lines are longer now than at the beginning of last
year. The lines are often out the door, but "it's
this way at the beginningof every year,'' he said.
Some of the reasons for the lines include the
large amounts of foreign mail going through the
office, and the need for renewing Post Office
boxes. The latter can be done by mail, Sodlink

said, which would help alleviate lines a bit.
I he Stanford Post Office has a limited number
of clerks who can work the windows. The Office
is working at capacity now, and is training two
new clerks as well.
I he stamp machines, as anyone who has been
around the Farm long enough knows, are a
habitual problem. But the full blame for their
repeated state ot disrepair seems to lie not on
the Post Office but the users. The machines are
constantly jammed by foreign coins.
The mechanisms in the machines are not as
archaic as their housing makes them seem. As
Sodlink said, they are "like a '57 Chevy with a
new engine." There are new mechanisms in the
stamp vendors, which are serviced every
month. But foreign coins, because of the diffe
rent metal contents, disturb the magnets in the
machines and jam them. There are brand new
machines at the Palo Alto Office, according to
Sodlink, but they have the same problem there.
One possibility which is often suggested is
that a "stamps only" line be created. There was
in tact such a line at Stanford a few years ago. But
the Postal Service has switched its national pol
icy, and now dictates a system of full service
windows.
It seems, then, that the only hope lies in pati
ence. Or in stocking up on stamps once, and
then laughing at the lines for the rest of the year.
Or in not writing letters.
