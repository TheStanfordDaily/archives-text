# Program helps U.S.-China relations
##

The University has played a
part in the recent expansion of
friendly relations with the
People's Republic of China,
according to Douglas Murray,
director of the U.S.-China Re
lations Program here.
Stanford has operated the
program since 1975, at first
under the supervision of the
Center for Research in Interna
tional Studies, and as of this
month under the newly estab
lished Northeast Asia-U.S.
Forum on International Policy.
A "negative" reason
triggered establishment ot the
project, Murray said.
"lor 10 years we had no
communication (with China).
A very major effort has to be

made to overcome the mutual
ignorance that developed over
those decades," he continued.
The program sponsors re
search and teaching in Chinese
studies, and, most notably,
coordinates a student and fa
culty exchange with China.
The University does not have
"a formal exchange agree
ment" with one exception, he
said.
Stanford presently has an ar
rangement with the Ministry of
Education for reciprocal ex
change of graduate students,
currently about three to five a
year, he said.
"That is based entirely on
our program's ability to raise
outside funds to pay the Stan

lord tuition of those three to
live Chinese students, in ex
change for which the Chinese
government pays the tuition of
the Stanford students," said
Murray.
There are currently 24
Chinese scholars and graduate
students here, all in science
and engineering. Up to a
do/en more are expected this
fall.
The University currently has
nine graduate students study
ing in China, four directly
through the program and the
other five through a similar na
tional competition.
Competition for the univer
sity positions for this year will
begin shortly, and is open to
advanced grad students with

two years of Chinese language
or the equivalent. A faculty
committee, in past years ap
pointed by the Center for Re
search in International Studies,
selects the exchange students.
The national selection pro
cess is currently under way,
with the deadline last ap
proaching, according to Mur
ray.
Although Stanford's prog
ram is not a part of any national
program, a number ot the
program's faculty are members
of national commillees on
U.S.-China Relations and some
of its research goes into na
tional studies.
Almost 100 University faculty
members have visited China at
one time or another.
