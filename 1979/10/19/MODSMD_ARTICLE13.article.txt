## Cure Early-Date syndrome 
### 
It was at the end of our date in the city when
she put one hand on my shoulder and another
on her doorknob and said sympathetically, "Bill,
Thanks so much for being my friend." Then she
closed the door.
I didn't know exactly what time it was, so I
asked a guy down the hall, figuring it was about
11:41.
It was then that I realized that I, Bill Kem
meries, was once more a victim of the "Early-
Date" syndrome (a fancy term for the dating
disease which results in massive amounts of lost
pride and money).
Now don't get me wrong. It didn't matter to
me at all that it took me 11 "hashing" hours to
pay for this date. What's money, huh?
And it really didn't matter to me that I have a
closer, more physical relationship with my
grandmother than I had with this girl tonight.
That doesn't matter to me that much (although I
do wonder sometimes).
What did matter was the fact that it was only
11:41. 11:41!
And now I had to suffer the consequences of
the Early-Date" syndrome — the paranoia of
knowing that someone else knows you got
"burned."
I remember last year going back to my dorm
• an "early-date," when someone out of the
Saturday Nite Live" gallery yelled out, "Hey,
Kemmeries, how was lunch? HAR HAR!!" It just
killed me.
And you know it'seven worse if you're in a frat.
I knew a guy who came home at 10:30 from an
"early-date," and his "brothers" immediately
locked him up in his room and didn't feed him
for a week.
But what in the heck can you do at the end of
an "early-date?" (I remember that night I went
over and hid in the bushes near Flo Mo for about
an hour, and then checked my P.O. box a
couple of times.)
What can you do? Vou can't go back to your
dorm or frat; that would be like returning to the
Alamo.
Is there anyway we can stop the "Early-Date"
syndrome, or at least halt this incredible pierc
ing of pride?
Well, lucky for you, I've come up with some
techniques and styles that I think might help.
As in dating itself, though, curing the "Early-
Date' syndrome takes two to tango, so both
girls and guys must work together to stop this

dating disease.
For Girls:
1. Blunt Honesty Approach: Girls, at the end
of your date just say, "Hey, I really don't feel any
physical attraction to you what-so-ever, but if
you would like to stick around and read for
awhile (Ladies, always keep some Si's or Sports
Magazine" in your room) you are more than
welcome." In fact girls, you can even go visit
some other friends or your boyfriend if you'd
like, just remember to save the guy's pride.
2. Octopus Rumor: Girls, when people want
to know why your date ended so early, just say
that he was "all arms and too aggressive." That
will, a) let people know that you are not "that
kind of girl," b) build up his pride (Have you
ever known a guy to deny that he's too aggres
sive?), and c) let those girls who are "that kind of
girl" know that he is around.
For Guys:
1. Cet Arrested: If you are driving home and
you know that the date is not going your way,
just go bananas! Drive like there is no tomor
row. Run every red light and stop sign you can.
This is at at least a two-hour shot because you'll
get arrested for sure, and then everything after
that will be fine — at least $150 worth!
2. Break-up Fake Out: After your date is over,
go sit in your dorm or frat lounge, stare at the
blank TV set, shaking vour head from side to
side and continually repeat, "I can't believe we
broke up." This is usually effective, but there are
two draw-backs to this technique — a) it's really
hard to pull off on a first-date type situation, and,
b) if you do it too much peopie will really think
you are "off the wall."
These are just a few of the things we can do to
stop this disease, and I hope that they will help
you this year.
Personally, I think the best thing would be for
all the victims of the "Early-Date" syndrome to
join together and form a "Losers Society" or
something like that.
Instead of everybody individually getting ar
rested or going to his P.O. box, everyone could
get together in the Flo Mo bushes between
11:30-12:00 on Friday and Saturday nights and
console each other, maybe "do" some beers
and "make" a night of a bad situation.
In fact, maybe I might see some of you in the
Flo Mo bushes tonight.
