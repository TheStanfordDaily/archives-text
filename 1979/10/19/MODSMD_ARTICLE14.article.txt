I was somewhat dismayed by
Leah Halper's column (Daily,
Oct. 15) on behalf of the Stan
ford Women's Center.
Speaking of the fee assess
ment ballot question, she said,
"It is, perhaps, foolishly op
timistic to expect such a prop
osal to succeed on a campus
where male faculty members
greatly outnumber females,
where role models for women
are scarce, where student
leaders are most often male
To me, this is implying that
men are, at best, insensitive
oppressors who could not pos
sibly recognize their interest in
changing the status quo.
I don't take this remark as a
deliberate offense. Halper
explicitly recognize, that all
members of the community
have a stake in the Center.
After all, if a change in the
self-image of women is to bring
about real progress rather than
increasingly angry confronta
tion, men must also re

evaluate the social connota
tions of gender.
But statements like the
above are just not helpful; put
ting people on the defensive is
not a good way to get them to
listen to you.
I consider myself a firm sup
porter of women's rights, but I
have to sympathize with a
friend who has developed an
allergic reaction to people who
label themselves feminists
(though he agrees with them
on a number of points).
The underlying theme of all
human rights movements is
that all people should be
judged as individuals. All
people — the "haves" as well
as the "have-nots."

Abortion question
This letter is in response to
the opinions expressed by
Dawn Upchurch's pro-choice
article {Daily, Oct. 17).

As do most people of similar
persuasion, Upchurch conve
niently avoids some pressing
issues when examining the
question of abortion, issues
which must be raised to give a
balanced perspective on the
"right to choose."
First, a man and a woman do
have the freedom of choice —
bluntly, the two available op
tions being whether or not to
hop between the sheets.
In light of Upchurch's
statement that no contracep
tive method is 100 percent safe,
they must exercise their right
to a choice — is the risk worth
it?
As adults, we must realize
that almost all of our decisions
will have consequences, some
of which we won't like; we
cannot run away from that real
ity.
In those instances where the
possible, unfavorable, con
sequences are known, such as
in the case here, we have all the
more reason to choose wisely.
Second, it was asserted that
the pro-choice movement is a
humanistic one, and that it
seeks to "reduce the number
of unwanted pregnancies, as
well as the number of un
wanted children." What about
the humans an abortion de
stroys?
Granted, it is difficult to
think of a small group of cells
as a human; but we all started
that way. And, many abortions
take place well into the
pregnancy, when it is difficult to
think of the unborn child as any
thing less than human.
If a child is born retarded —
unwanted by most expectant
parents — do they have the
right to end his or her life? Can
thev make that choice? Could
they have two weeks earlier,
had they been able to know?
For its involvement in family
planning, and their dissemina
tion of information about birth
control, I applaud the efforts of
pro-choice, and hope thay are
able to expand their efforts in
those directions.
But if they are to lend cre
dence to their programs they
must stop making shallow ar
guments that really say they are
not willing to live with the con
sequences of their own deci
sions — that they would rather
take it out on someone who
has no say in the matter.

Caption misleads
Your recent article (Daily,
Oct. 12) on the services offered
by Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services at Stanford was a
clear, well-balanced presenta
tion of some of what we offer.
Unfortunately, the caption
under the photograph was mis
leading, and I would like to
correct two points. •
First, the staff of CAPS have

offices in the out-patient area
of the Student Health Centeras
well as at Huston House, and
counseling is an integral of the
out-patient services offered.
Secondly, CAPS has an in
terdisciplinary staff of mental
health professionals that in
clude psychiatrists (physi
cians;, psychologists, social
workers, and career coun
selors.
It is this unique blending of
disciplines combined with a
wide variation in age and
ethnicity that allows CAPS to
offer services tailored to the
many needs of students on a
diverse campus such as Stan
ford.
Lastly, many of our staff are
involved with student living
groups, and other projects
around campus, for example,
every residence has a CAPS

professional assigned to it.
We are available to develop
workshops on student
initiated topics and welcome
the opportunity to respond to
student needs.
We encourage students to
work through their housing as
sociates and campus organiza
tions if there is an interest in
involving us in arranging or
participating in programs
where we may have expertise.

TV 'Miracle'
This past Sunday, I had the
privilege of experiencing a too
rare event on television: The
airing of a tremendously mov
ing dramatic film, "The Miracle

Worker."
It is rrot often that television
uses its awesome power to
communicate a worthwhile,
emotional experience to us.
Not only is it an exceptional
film, well acted and well pro
duced, but it is an example of
the incredible artistic heights
that television is capable of
achieving.
Even the sponsor, IBM, used
a unique and tasteful approach
with a minimum of commercial
interruptions.
The end result was an incred
ible film with solid, uplifting
emotional impact. It is a rare
experience television has pro
vided only a very few times be
fore.
Why not make a profit while
enriching us? Why not enter
tain with a purpose?
Why not be the eyes to the

soul that Helen never had?
The hard part is over, you
proved it can be done.

pro-choice, and hope thay are

Caption misleads
Your recent article (Daily,

by Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services at Stanford was a
clear, well-balanced presenta
tion of some of what we offer.
Unfortunately, the caption
under the photograph was mis
leading, and I would like to
correct two points. •
First, the staff of CAPS have

offices in the out-patient area
of the Student Health Centeras
well as at Huston House, and
counseling is an integral of the
out-patient services offered.
Secondly, CAPS has an in
terdisciplinary staff of mental
health professionals that in
clude psychiatrists (physi
cians;, psychologists, social
workers, and career coun
selors.
It is this unique blending of
disciplines combined with a
wide variation in age and
ethnicity that allows CAPS to
offer services tailored to the
many needs of students on a
diverse campus such as Stan
ford.
Lastly, many of our staff are
involved with student living
groups, and other projects
around campus, for example,
every residence has a CAPS

professional assigned to it.
We are available to develop
workshops on student
initiated topics and welcome
the opportunity to respond to
student needs.
We encourage students to
work through their housing as
sociates and campus organiza
tions if there is an interest in
involving us in arranging or
participating in programs
where we may have expertise.

TV 'Miracle'
This past Sunday, I had the
privilege of experiencing a too
rare event on television: The
airing of a tremendously mov
ing dramatic film, "The Miracle

Worker."
It is rrot often that television
uses its awesome power to
communicate a worthwhile,
emotional experience to us.
Not only is it an exceptional
film, well acted and well pro
duced, but it is an example of
the incredible artistic heights
that television is capable of
achieving.
Even the sponsor, IBM, used
a unique and tasteful approach
with a minimum of commercial
interruptions.
The end result was an incred
ible film with solid, uplifting
emotional impact. It is a rare
experience television has pro
vided only a very few times be
fore.
Why not make a profit while
enriching us? Why not enter
tain with a purpose?
Why not be the eyes to the

soul that Helen never had?
The hard part is over, you
proved it can be done.

I was somewhat dismayed by
Leah Halper's column (Daily,
Oct. 15) on behalf of the Stan
ford Women's Center.
Speaking of the fee assess
ment ballot question, she said,
"It is, perhaps, foolishly op
timistic to expect such a prop
osal to succeed on a campus
where male faculty members
greatly outnumber females,
where role models for women
are scarce, where student
leaders are most often male
To me, this is implying that
men are, at best, insensitive
oppressors who could not pos
sibly recognize their interest in
changing the status quo.
I don't take this remark as a
deliberate offense. Halper
explicitly recognize, that all
members of the community
have a stake in the Center.
After all, if a change in the
self-image of women is to bring
about real progress rather than
increasingly angry confronta
tion, men must also re

evaluate the social connota
tions of gender.
But statements like the
above are just not helpful; put
ting people on the defensive is
not a good way to get them to
listen to you.
I consider myself a firm sup
porter of women's rights, but I
have to sympathize with a
friend who has developed an
allergic reaction to people who
label themselves feminists
(though he agrees with them
on a number of points).
The underlying theme of all
human rights movements is
that all people should be
judged as individuals. All

Abortion question
This letter is in response to
the opinions expressed by
Dawn Upchurch's pro-choice
article {Daily, Oct. 17).

As do most people of similar
persuasion, Upchurch conve
niently avoids some pressing
issues when examining the
question of abortion, issues
which must be raised to give a
balanced perspective on the
"right to choose."
First, a man and a woman do
have the freedom of choice —
bluntly, the two available op
tions being whether or not to
hop between the sheets.
In light of Upchurch's
statement that no contracep
tive method is 100 percent safe,
they must exercise their right
to a choice — is the risk worth
it?
As adults, we must realize
that almost all of our decisions
will have consequences, some
of which we won't like; we
cannot run away from that real
ity.
In those instances where the
possible, unfavorable, con
sequences are known, such as
in the case here, we have all the
more reason to choose wisely.
Second, it was asserted that
the pro-choice movement is a
humanistic one, and that it
seeks to "reduce the number
of unwanted pregnancies, as
well as the number of un
wanted children." What about
the humans an abortion de
stroys?
Granted, it is difficult to
think of a small group of cells
as a human; but we all started
that way. And, many abortions
take place well into the
pregnancy, when it is difficult to
think of the unborn child as any
thing less than human.
If a child is born retarded —
unwanted by most expectant
parents — do they have the
right to end his or her life? Can
thev make that choice? Could
they have two weeks earlier,
had they been able to know?
For its involvement in family
planning, and their dissemina
tion of information about birth
control, I applaud the efforts of
pro-choice, and hope thay are
able to expand their efforts in
those directions.
But if they are to lend cre
dence to their programs they
