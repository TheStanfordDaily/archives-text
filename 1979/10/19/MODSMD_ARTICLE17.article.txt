## Nuclear secrets act ambiguous 
### 
In his challenge (.Daily, Oct.
9) to my congratulatory note to
the Daily (Oct. 4), Rudolf Sher
is severely handicapped by not
being a reader of The Progres
sive.
He says that "the necessity of
using an A-bomb to make an
H-bomb is . . . the worst-kept
secret of the century." I cer
tainly agree.
But Professor Sher is una
ware that this "secret" is prob
ably classified. That is, it is Sec
ret Restricted Data under the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
Later on he says, "Nothing
related to nuclear power gen
eration is classified (with some
exceptions)."
But the Act says,"The term
Restricted Data' means all data
concerning . . . weapons . . .
or the use of special nuclear
material in the production of
energy, but shall not include
data declassified . .
Sher will find there is no way
to determine it some concept
has been specifically declas
sified.
It he does make a public
point of a declassified docu
ment it will immediately be re
classified, as were the Los
Alamos library documents on

the H-bomb.
The Progressive controversy
illustrates how this dangerous
act invites prior restraint of the
press, then requires classifica
tion of the defendant's de
fense.
How can there be a public
trial or discussion?
The government had every
reason to believe that a small
magazine with nearly zero ad
vertising revenue would roll
over and play dead, thereby es
tablishing the precedent that
escaped when the New York
Times published the Pentagon
Papers.
But the Progressive fought
back (I contributed) and the
government dropped the case
to avoid setting any legal pre
cedent that would hinder its
doing the same thing again to
morrow.
Concept difficult for laymen
It is precisely this ambiguity
about what is and is not clas
sified that makes it impossible
for anyone whose living de
pends on his clearance to say
anything, and equally impossi
ble for a layman to make an
informed judgement on these
matters of his own life and
death.

Sher read my note saying an
A-bomb could only be made
with a nuclear power plant,
when the fact is that that is
simply the easiest way. My
wording was "what you need
to make an A-bomb is a nuclear
power plant"; I should have
said "all you need . .
Professor Sher is aware that
most of the countries he men
tioned made their first
A-bombs before nuclear
power plants existed — but
they had atomic piles. (An
atomic pile is like a power plant
with no place to plug in.)
'Hypocritical officials'
I am happy to supply the
names of the hypocritical offi
cials that Sher requested.
Among those who sent af
fidavits to Judge Warren in the
Progressive case were:
Cyrus Vance, secretary of
state — "publication . . .
would substantially increase
the risk that thermonuclear
weapons would become avail
able . .
Harold Brown, secretary of
defense — "Secret Restricted
Data contained in the Morland
paper describes correctly
. . .there is a substantial in
crease in the risk that the av-

ailability of thermonuclear
weapons would be increased."
James R. Schlesinger, sec
retary of energy — "disclosure
of the Secret Restricted Data
. . . would be contrary to the
non-proliferation policy of the
United States . . . and would
increase the risks of ther
monuclear war."
I believe Sher will agree that
all three of these "high-placed
officials" have a veto over ex
port of "profitable" nuclear
power plants.
The May 1979 Progressive ,
from which the above quota
tions were taken, is a compen
dium of classification absur
dities, including a con
gressman who was told his
questions were classified!
During the years I worked
under a "Q" (for Secret Re
stricted Data) clearance I saw
many instances of misuse.
After I pointed out a security
breach by the founder and
head of a multimillion-dollar
weapons company, he
explained: "The only purpose
for classification is to keep
congressmen from finding out
where the money was spent."

classified, as were the Los
Alamos library documents on

the H-bomb.
The Progressive controversy
illustrates how this dangerous
act invites prior restraint of the
press, then requires classifica
tion of the defendant's de
fense.
How can there be a public
trial or discussion?
The government had every
reason to believe that a small
magazine with nearly zero ad
vertising revenue would roll
over and play dead, thereby es
tablishing the precedent that
escaped when the New York
Times published the Pentagon
Papers.
But the Progressive fought
back (I contributed) and the
government dropped the case
to avoid setting any legal pre
cedent that would hinder its
doing the same thing again to
morrow.
Concept difficult for laymen
It is precisely this ambiguity
about what is and is not clas
sified that makes it impossible
for anyone whose living de
pends on his clearance to say
anything, and equally impossi
ble for a layman to make an
informed judgement on these
matters of his own life and
death.

Sher read my note saying an
A-bomb could only be made
with a nuclear power plant,
when the fact is that that is
simply the easiest way. My
wording was "what you need
to make an A-bomb is a nuclear
power plant"; I should have
said "all you need . .
Professor Sher is aware that
most of the countries he men
tioned made their first
A-bombs before nuclear
power plants existed — but
they had atomic piles. (An
atomic pile is like a power plant
with no place to plug in.)
'Hypocritical officials'
I am happy to supply the
names of the hypocritical offi
cials that Sher requested.
Among those who sent af
fidavits to Judge Warren in the
Progressive case were:
Cyrus Vance, secretary of
state — "publication . . .
would substantially increase
the risk that thermonuclear
weapons would become avail
able . .
Harold Brown, secretary of
defense — "Secret Restricted
Data contained in the Morland
paper describes correctly
. . .there is a substantial in
crease in the risk that the av-

ailability of thermonuclear
weapons would be increased."
James R. Schlesinger, sec
retary of energy — "disclosure
of the Secret Restricted Data
. . . would be contrary to the
non-proliferation policy of the
United States . . . and would
increase the risks of ther
monuclear war."
I believe Sher will agree that
all three of these "high-placed
officials" have a veto over ex
port of "profitable" nuclear
power plants.
The May 1979 Progressive ,
from which the above quota
tions were taken, is a compen
dium of classification absur
dities, including a con
gressman who was told his
questions were classified!
During the years I worked
under a "Q" (for Secret Re
stricted Data) clearance I saw
many instances of misuse.
After I pointed out a security
breach by the founder and
head of a multimillion-dollar
weapons company, he
explained: "The only purpose
for classification is to keep
congressmen from finding out
where the money was spent."

engineer from SI.AC.)
In his challenge (.Daily, Oct.
9) to my congratulatory note to
the Daily (Oct. 4), Rudolf Sher
is severely handicapped by not
being a reader of The Progres
sive.
He says that "the necessity of
using an A-bomb to make an
H-bomb is . . . the worst-kept
secret of the century." I cer
tainly agree.
But Professor Sher is una
ware that this "secret" is prob
ably classified. That is, it is Sec
ret Restricted Data under the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
Later on he says, "Nothing
related to nuclear power gen
eration is classified (with some
exceptions)."
But the Act says,"The term
Restricted Data' means all data
concerning . . . weapons . . .
or the use of special nuclear
material in the production of
energy, but shall not include
data declassified . .
Sher will find there is no way
to determine it some concept
has been specifically declas
sified.
It he does make a public
point of a declassified docu
ment it will immediately be re
classified, as were the Los
Alamos library documents on

the H-bomb.
