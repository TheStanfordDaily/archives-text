# Student vote axes Cardinals, but splits on Griffons, Trees
## 
### Andrea James 
Students abandoned the Cardinals as Stanford's mJS
- in Tuesday and Wednesday's balloting but could
come to no decisive choice between the Trees and the
Griffons.
So the mascot issue will continue to hover over the
University as it has since 1972, when the Indian was
banned from the campus.
University administrators who have the final say on
the mascot said it will remain the Cardinals for the rest of
the year and probably for the next few years because of
what they termed a lack of consensus among the stu
dents.
Tree wins, barely
I he Tree out-polled the Griffon by only 10 votes in the
election in which 28 percent of the student body went to
the polls. The Tree garnered 1,239 of the 3,490 votes cast,
with the Griffon receiving 1,229.
The Cardinal, the only other mascot option listed on
the ballot, received 664 votes.
The mascot issue has divided the University since
President Richard Lyman ordered the Indian removed as
the mascot. Several native Americans had presented him
with a petition claiming that the use of an Indian or any
race as a mascot was inappropriate.
Since then, numerous alumni have put increasingly
strong pressure on the administration to re-adopt the
Indian mascot.
Student reactions mixed
Reaction to the moves to bring back the Indian have
been mixed among current students. Many have
sported t-shirts with the image of a chief and the slogan
"Bring Back Chief Lightfoot to the Farm."

When Lightfoot made an unscheduled appearance at
the football game against UCLA on Oct. 6, the student
section responded with both boos and cheers while the
alumni sections cheered heartily.
And in this week's student body election, only one
student wrote in the Indian for mascot. Four students at
Stanford's overseas campus in Florence, Italy, wrote in
Panini, a small, usually hard and indestructible Italian
bread roll as a mascot possibility.
AndyGeiger, athletic director, said that because ot the
close race between the Tree and the Griffon. Stanford's
mascot will probably remain the Cardinal for some time.
Change unlikely
"I don't see how we've learned much by this vote," he
said yesterday after learning the results. "The president
(Lyman) and I, I'm sure, will meet to discuss the issue but
I don't see how we can make a decision based on these
figures."
Lyman, however, said yesterday that the Cardinal —
the color, not the bird — will remain the Universitv
mascot.
Appearing on KZSU's "Campus Conference" broad
cast, Lyman recognized that the inability ot the Univer
sity to rally behind a mascot would "leave the door
open"' for those who want the Indian brought back.
He said though, that the election results did not pro
duce a "consensus or anything resembling a consensus"
on which to base a change in mascots, so a change will
not be made.
The Stanford Tree has been the mascot of the Stanford
Band for several years and is pictured on the school
emblem. Two statues of the griffon, a half-lion half-eagle
beast, sit outside the Stanford Athletic Department
building on campus.
