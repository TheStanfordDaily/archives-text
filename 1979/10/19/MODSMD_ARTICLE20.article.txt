# District unites against rapist
## 
### Cindy Altick 
College Terrace, a group of more than 900
homes on the tree-lined streets just south of
campus, has been plagued by a suspected rapist
since 1971 and has now begun to fight back,
spokesmen say.
A string of recent attacks prompted a meeting
of residents with police and rape crisis center
volunteers. Publicity campaigns, too, have been
conducted.
Until May of this year, the attacks had
been infrequent, one or two per year, with none
reported from late 1976 until early 1979.
But since May, there have been three rapes,
and Brian Vierra, the Palo Alto detective as
signed to the case, said he believes the same
person has committed all 10 attacks over the
eight-year span.
According to Vierra, the rapist prowls bet
ween 10:30 p.m. and 2 a.m. and acquaints him
self with his victim's habits and house. The three
recent attacks have been in houses near an open
field or park, and police believe the rapist hides
out for hours and watches each house.
He enters through an unlocked door or win
dow and cuts the electricty and phone wires. He
carries a knife but has never used it, police said.
Because it seems clear to College Ter
race residents that they have been singled out
by this rapist, the community is starting to fight
back.
The police are leading the fight with extensive
publicity. Since May, they have twice circulated
flyers with the suspect's composite sketch and
description. Vierra estimates he has passed out
or posted 5000 such leaflets. The police have
also gone door to door, talking with residents
about their safety and checking houses to make
suggestions for tighter security.
Vierra has notified police agencies all over the
state and has answered more than 20 calls a day
from residents reporting prowlers or men that
fit the rapist's description.
The neighborhood, too, is organizing. Colin

Mick, a member of the College Terrace Resi
dent's Association, has organized volunteers to
distribute leaflets. He has also solicited pledges
from residents for a $500 reward to anyone with
information leading to the rapist's arrest.
Mick stressed neighborhood awareness.
"Know your neighborand your neighborhood,"
he urged.
The Mid-Peninsula Rape Crisis Cen'ler, a vol
unteer group funded by United Way, has also
worked with the police and community, provid
ing public education as well as counseling for
the victims.
The crisis center proposed the community
meeting which the police helped sponsor on
Oct. 4 in Escondido Elementary School, said a
volunteer at the center. The school's multi
purpose room was packed to the doors with
more than 300 residents, demonstrating the
neighborhood's concern.
"This is the first time in my community I've
seen the police, community and media act to
gether," another crisis center volunteer said.
She called it a case of "the community versus the
rapist."
"The only way we're going to catch this guy is
through neighborhood involvement," Mick
said. "The odds of him being caught by one of
you spotting him and calling are pretty good,
better than the police spotting him in some bush
at 5 a.m.," he told residents.
College Terrace residents are heeding this ad
vice and are becoming more aware and vigilant.
They have built cabinets around their fuse
boxes, installed more outside lights and are
keeping an eye out for unfamiliar faces, au
thorities said,
"People have really been helpful," Vierra
said. He described College Terrace as a cohesive
group and reported no negative responses from
the community. Vierra seemed to speak for the
community when he said, "I want to get him
caught."
