## Cards try to de-claw Wildcats in Pac-10 operation SPORTS 
### Mike Oneal 
Daily: Turk, how do you
think the team feels now,
going into Pac-10 competition?
Schonert: After the Army
game, we decided to start a
Vvhole new season, and now,
Since we beat Boston College,
we're 1-0.
Daily: 1-0, huh?
Schonert: Yeah — we feel
pretty good.
Well, that was two weeks
ago, before the Cardinals had
descended into Ihe Pacific-10
Conference inferno to face
what many had thought would
be the final swan song for a
once-proud, bowl-winning
Stanford football team.
It hasn't been. After two
straight weekends of staring
top-20 competition right in the
$yes, Stanford has iru reased its
"new season" ledger to 2-0-1
and the only song they're sing
ing now is "From Here to
Pasadena."
The Cards weathered the
toughest segment of their
schedule with poise — those
games against UCLA and USC
— and suddenly they're a con
ference championship con
tender.
Now they face the challenge
of keeping that poise intact
while letting their spirit and
underdog energy flow.
"I'm not surprised with how
our players have performed
over the last two weeks,"

commented Stanford head
coach Rod Dowhower. "Our
guys have a tremendous
amount of pride and determi
nation. Now, we have to go out
and take advantage of the situ
ation we have created."
The situation is that the
Cards share first place in the
Pac-10 and can look forward to
a schedule of teams they
should be able to beat. At this
point, it looks like Stanford, a
team which lost to Army, could
finish on top of the Pac-10.
But that's all a long way off
for the Cards and all they can
afford to think about now is
Arizona.
The have been
somewhat of a surprise this
season after tinishing sixth in
the conference last year. Al
though they started out slowly
in the Pac-10 by losing to
Calitornia 10-7, they soundly
beat Washington State before
that 22-7 and outlasted Oregon
24-13 last week.
"I don't really know much
about Arizona because we ha
ven't played them before,"
said coach Dowhower. "I do
know they use the option, and
that they have a fine quarter
back ()im Krohn) who can both
run and throw effectively.
We're going to have to contain
him if we expect to win.
They're coming off a great ef
fort against Oregon, and it's
homecoming tor them this
week."

The 'Cat offensive unit, be
sides Krohn, is sparked by
senior tailback Larry Heater, a
good ground gainer who aver
aged 88.1 yards per game last
year. Arizona's scoring offense
ranks fifth in the Pac-10, and
their rushing offense is sec
ond.
The defensive unit, which
has given up a mere 13.2 points
a game, is led by All-America
tackle Cleveland Crosby.
Crosby has five sacks this year
and 51 tackles. He should
prove to be a menace for the
Card offensive line which has
been erratic this season.
What all of this points out is
that Stanford can't afford to let
up at all this week in spite of its
tie with the Trojans last Satur
day.
A team as young and still as
unproven as the Cards has to
keep on winning to let the rest
of the country know that not
losing to both the teams from
Los Angeles for the first time in
eight years was filled with
something much deeper, than
luck. Stanford cannot sit back
on its laurels.
"I'm not worried,"
Dowhower said. "The guys feel
good about themselves and
should. We'll just stick with the
same methodical, relaxed ap
proach and mishaps won't be
something we can't contain.
The thrill for me is watching the

players do things they're not
supposed to do."
And the Cards have thrilled
him quite a bit lately.
The team has not synth
esized a kind of mood which
has become characteristic of
Stanford football this year, one
which is a funny combination
of laid-back and intense.
Perhapsthat'swhy it took them
so long to get going.
Schonert, who was named
Sports Illustrated and Pac-10
Offensive Player of the Week
for his efforts against USC, has
established himself as the
leader of the team. He is the
relaxed, quiet kind of field
general who throws the soft
pass. After the intensity of
Steve Dils, it may have taken
the Cards a few extra games to
get used to Schonert's brand of
quiet leadership.
But they're used to it now
and they're winning games.
Atter USC Schonert said,
"The last two weeks were a
confidence-builder. I think
now everyone on the team is a

firm believer that we can do it.
We're up there with the big
guys now."
The team in its "new season"
has been coming through with
the big plays all year.
"We've done that all year,"
coach Dowhower said. "We've
found what we needed to win
and found a way to deal with
momentary failure."
It's hard to find that kind of
energy all year long, and the
Cards have a long road ahead.
Arizona is the next hurdle. But
as Wildcat head coach Tony
Mason said, "The only thing I
know (about Stanford) is
they're capable of beating any
body in the country."
You never know.

guys now."
The team in its "new season"
has been coming through with
the big plays all year.
"We've done that all year,"
coach Dowhower said. "We've
found what we needed to win
and found a way to deal with
momentary failure."
It's hard to find that kind of
energy all year long, and the
Cards have a long road ahead.
Arizona is the next hurdle. But
as Wildcat head coach Tony
Mason said, "The only thing I
know (about Stanford) is
they're capable of beating any
body in the country."
You never know.
Daily: Turk, how do you
think the team feels now,
going into Pac-10 competition?
Schonert: After the Army
game, we decided to start a
Vvhole new season, and now,
Since we beat Boston College,
we're 1-0.
Daily: 1-0, huh?
Schonert: Yeah — we feel
pretty good.
Well, that was two weeks
ago, before the Cardinals had
descended into Ihe Pacific-10
Conference inferno to face
what many had thought would
be the final swan song for a
once-proud, bowl-winning
Stanford football team.
It hasn't been. After two
straight weekends of staring
top-20 competition right in the
$yes, Stanford has iru reased its
"new season" ledger to 2-0-1
and the only song they're sing
ing now is "From Here to
Pasadena."
The Cards weathered the
toughest segment of their
schedule with poise — those
games against UCLA and USC
— and suddenly they're a con
ference championship con
tender.
Now they face the challenge
of keeping that poise intact
while letting their spirit and
underdog energy flow.
"I'm not surprised with how
our players have performed
over the last two weeks,"

commented Stanford head
coach Rod Dowhower. "Our
guys have a tremendous
amount of pride and determi
nation. Now, we have to go out
and take advantage of the situ
ation we have created."
The situation is that the
Cards share first place in the
Pac-10 and can look forward to
a schedule of teams they
should be able to beat. At this
point, it looks like Stanford, a
team which lost to Army, could
finish on top of the Pac-10.
But that's all a long way off
for the Cards and all they can
afford to think about now is
Arizona.
The have been
somewhat of a surprise this
season after tinishing sixth in
the conference last year. Al
though they started out slowly
in the Pac-10 by losing to
Calitornia 10-7, they soundly
beat Washington State before
that 22-7 and outlasted Oregon
24-13 last week.
"I don't really know much
about Arizona because we ha
ven't played them before,"
said coach Dowhower. "I do
know they use the option, and
that they have a fine quarter
back ()im Krohn) who can both
run and throw effectively.
We're going to have to contain
him if we expect to win.
They're coming off a great ef
fort against Oregon, and it's
homecoming tor them this
week."

The 'Cat offensive unit, be
sides Krohn, is sparked by
senior tailback Larry Heater, a
good ground gainer who aver
aged 88.1 yards per game last
year. Arizona's scoring offense
ranks fifth in the Pac-10, and
their rushing offense is sec
ond.
The defensive unit, which
has given up a mere 13.2 points
a game, is led by All-America
tackle Cleveland Crosby.
Crosby has five sacks this year
and 51 tackles. He should
prove to be a menace for the
Card offensive line which has
been erratic this season.
What all of this points out is
that Stanford can't afford to let
up at all this week in spite of its
tie with the Trojans last Satur
day.
A team as young and still as
unproven as the Cards has to
keep on winning to let the rest
of the country know that not
losing to both the teams from
Los Angeles for the first time in
eight years was filled with
something much deeper, than
luck. Stanford cannot sit back
on its laurels.
"I'm not worried,"
Dowhower said. "The guys feel
good about themselves and
should. We'll just stick with the
same methodical, relaxed ap
proach and mishaps won't be
something we can't contain.
The thrill for me is watching the

And the Cards have thrilled
him quite a bit lately.

pass. After the intensity of
Steve Dils, it may have taken
the Cards a few extra games to
get used to Schonert's brand of
quiet leadership.
But they're used to it now
and they're winning games.
