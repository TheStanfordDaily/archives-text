# Spikers go south after losing at Cal
## 
### Edie Bogart 
Stanford's women's vol
leyball team played hard at
the beginning but fell apart
at the end last night at Ber
keley, losing to California
15-8, 14-16, 10-15, 15-4 and
15-11.
This weekend the spikers
travel to Southern Califor
nia for two matches. To
night Stanford faces San
Diego State and tomorrow
the Cardinals take on Cal
State-Long Beach in another
evening encounter.
Wednesday night at
Maples Pavilion Stanford
crushed the University of

San Francisco in three
straight games, winning
15-2, 15-10 and 15-4.
The match was relaxed
and generated momentum
for the upcoming matches.
Every Cardinal got a chance
to play, and Head Coach
Fred Sturm got a "good look
at the second-string
players."
Tucker Ford, Sandy Har
ris, Jenyth Gearhart and Kisi
Haine were especially im
pressive off the bench. The
match gave the Cards an
opportunity to work on
their floor positions and
shifts, as well as defensive
and offensive strategies.
