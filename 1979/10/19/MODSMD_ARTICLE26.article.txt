Stanford tans who follow
football on KSFO radio
surely associate Don Klein's

voice with Cardinal football.
Now in his 24th season cov
ering the Cards, Klein cur
rently does Stanford foot
ball and basketball on San
Francisco-based KSFO and
is the sports director at
KCBS.
As a shrewd, knowledge
able veteran of the col
legiate sporting scene, Klein
is usually accurate — which
is more than can be said for
the Daily sports editors,
whose records are becom-

ing more tarnished as the
weeks go by.
Hoping that Klein can
forecast as well as he can
broadcast, the Daily has
selected him as its Guest
Greek of the Week. Klein's
announcements follow:

California at UCLA: Bruins
are overdue, and it gets to
be a case of "Win one for
Donahue."
Washington State at Arizona

State: It's the Cougars' turn
to be surprised this week as
emotions run high in
Tempe. The Cougars' only
hope is for a Sun Devil sit
down strike for Frank Kush.
Air Force at Oregon: The
Ducks are better than they
looked against Arizona —
especially in Eugene.
San lose State at Oregon
State: The helpless Beaver
defense is no match for the
Spartan attack.

Pittsburgh at Washington:
The Huskies are still in the
Rose Bowl race — even
though being in the wrong
place at the wrong time (in
Tempe last weekend).
USC at Notre Dame: The
Trojans will play both halves
this week, Stanford having
taken away their press clip
pings.
Stanford at Arizona: The
Cards know they can play
with anyone after the USC
game.
