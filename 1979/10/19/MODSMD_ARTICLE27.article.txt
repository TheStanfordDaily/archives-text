# Strange but true newcomers join NBA
## 
### Associated Press 
Larry Bird was wined, dined
and finally signed to the largest
contract ever received by a
rookie in the National Basket
ball Association — $650,000 a
year for five years.
But the road to the NBA is
not paved with that kind of
gold for all first-year pros.
Thirty-nine rookies were
among the 242 players who
made NBA season-opening
rosters, with 10 more on the
injured list.
Not all of them were house
hold names carrying fancy
price tags.
Some could sign in as mys
tery guests on "What's My
Line" and siump the panel.
They are more than happy to
be playing for the minimum
salary of $30,000. After all, it
beats unemployment.
Take Paul Dawkins. The
6-foot-5 forward averaged 26.7
points per game for Northern
Illinois last season, but appa
rently didn't make much of an
impression on the pro scouts.
He lasted till the 10th and final
round of the NBA draft before
being picked up by Utah, No.
185 of the 202 players chosen.
Yet Dawkins made the roster
of the Jazz — beating out,
among others, the club's No. 1
pick, forward Larry Knight of
Chicago Loyola.

Then there's Hollis Cope
land. The 6-foot-5 forward
from Rutgers was the last
player cut by Denver a year
ago, but he decided to give pro
ball one more shot.
The New York Knicks invited
him to their rookie-free agent
camp, liked what they saw and
invited him back to the regular
camp.
Copeland kept on playing
well every chance he got, and
when the final cuts came
down, Copeland made the
squad — beating out veterans
Glen Gondrezick and John
Rudd.
Bill Willoughby is another
player who was waived out of
the league a year ago but made
a successful comeback.
A 6-foot-8 forward, Wil
loughby turned pro directly
out of high school in 1975, the
same year as Darryl Dawkins.
But while Dawkins became a
celebrity, and more recently a
starter, in Philadelphia, Wil
loughby languished on the
bench in Atlanta, then
bounced to Buffalo and San
Diego and out of the league.
He played with the Los
Angeles lakers' team in the
summer league and made a
good impression on the club's
coach, Stan Albeck.
When that Laker aide be
came coach of the Cleveland

Cavaliers he invited Wil
loughby to try out, and he
made the squad.
Since the Cavs had traded
away their No. 1 pick in the
NBA draft, and their second
and third-round picks had
elected to play in Europe, Al
beck now refers to Willoughby
as "my No. 1 pick — with three
years experience."
Major (ones of Houston, Bob
Carrington and Stan Piet
kiewicz of San Diego, Eric
Fernsten of Boston, Duck Wil
liams of Utah, Marlon Red
mond of Kansas City, Bubba
Wilson of Golden State, Mike
Evans of San Antonio, Jeff
Cook of Phoenix, Delmer
Beshore and Sam Smith of
Chicago and Cus Bailey of
Washington are other players
who fought their way off the
waiver lists and onto NBA ros
ters.
The most intriguing com
eback, however, was achieved
by John Roche, the guard who
used to play for the New York
Nets in the old American Bas
ketball Association. Even
though he'd been out of bas
ketball three years, Roche tried
out for the Denver Nuggets —
and made the team.
Others were not so lucky.
Among those who were un
successful in comeback bids
were former NCAA scoring

champions Bo Lamar, Johnny
Neumann and Larry Fogle and
familiar names like Marvin
Barnes, Ron Behagen, Wesley
Cox, Andre McCarter, Gary
Brokaw, Phil Walker, Mel Ben
nett, Glenn Hansen, Fly Wil
liams, Mo Layton, Lew Massey
and Earl Williams.
The New York Knicks lead
the league with five rookies:
Copeland, third-round draft
pick Geoff Huston and first
round picks Bill Cartwright,
Larry Demic and Sly Williams.
Detroit also has five first
round picks Greg Kelser, Ro\
Hamilton and Phil Hubbard,

third-rounder Terry Duerod
and 1978 draftee Earl Evans, but
Evans is currently on the in
jured list.
San Diego and Cleveland
were the only teams without
real rookies, since Carrington,
Pietkiewicz and Willoughby all
have NBA experience.
Cliff Robinson of the New
Jersey Nets, 19 years old, is the
youngest rookie to make the
grade. The oldest are both 28:
John Coughran of Golden
State, who spent six years play
ing ball in Europe, and Irv Kiffin
of San Antonio, who spent four
years with Athletes in Action.

Bill Willoughby is another
player who was waived out of
the league a year ago but made
a successful comeback.
A 6-foot-8 forward, Wil
loughby turned pro directly
out of high school in 1975, the
same year as Darryl Dawkins.
But while Dawkins became a
celebrity, and more recently a
starter, in Philadelphia, Wil
loughby languished on the
bench in Atlanta, then
bounced to Buffalo and San
Diego and out of the league.
He played with the Los
Angeles lakers' team in the
summer league and made a
good impression on the club's
coach, Stan Albeck.
When that Laker aide be
came coach of the Cleveland

Cavaliers he invited Wil
loughby to try out, and he
made the squad.
Since the Cavs had traded
away their No. 1 pick in the
NBA draft, and their second
and third-round picks had
elected to play in Europe, Al
beck now refers to Willoughby
as "my No. 1 pick — with three
years experience."
Major (ones of Houston, Bob
Carrington and Stan Piet
kiewicz of San Diego, Eric
Fernsten of Boston, Duck Wil
liams of Utah, Marlon Red
mond of Kansas City, Bubba
Wilson of Golden State, Mike
Evans of San Antonio, Jeff
Cook of Phoenix, Delmer
Beshore and Sam Smith of
Chicago and Cus Bailey of
Washington are other players
who fought their way off the
waiver lists and onto NBA ros
ters.
The most intriguing com
eback, however, was achieved
by John Roche, the guard who
used to play for the New York
Nets in the old American Bas
ketball Association. Even
though he'd been out of bas
ketball three years, Roche tried
out for the Denver Nuggets —
and made the team.
Others were not so lucky.
Among those who were un
successful in comeback bids
were former NCAA scoring

champions Bo Lamar, Johnny
Neumann and Larry Fogle and
familiar names like Marvin
Barnes, Ron Behagen, Wesley
Cox, Andre McCarter, Gary
Brokaw, Phil Walker, Mel Ben
nett, Glenn Hansen, Fly Wil
liams, Mo Layton, Lew Massey
and Earl Williams.
The New York Knicks lead
the league with five rookies:
Copeland, third-round draft
pick Geoff Huston and first
round picks Bill Cartwright,
Larry Demic and Sly Williams.
Detroit also has five first
round picks Greg Kelser, Ro\
Hamilton and Phil Hubbard,

third-rounder Terry Duerod
and 1978 draftee Earl Evans, but
Evans is currently on the in
jured list.
San Diego and Cleveland
were the only teams without
real rookies, since Carrington,
Pietkiewicz and Willoughby all
have NBA experience.
Cliff Robinson of the New
Jersey Nets, 19 years old, is the
youngest rookie to make the
grade. The oldest are both 28:
John Coughran of Golden
State, who spent six years play
ing ball in Europe, and Irv Kiffin
of San Antonio, who spent four
years with Athletes in Action.
Larry Bird was wined, dined
and finally signed to the largest
contract ever received by a
rookie in the National Basket
ball Association — $650,000 a
year for five years.
But the road to the NBA is
not paved with that kind of
gold for all first-year pros.
Thirty-nine rookies were
among the 242 players who
made NBA season-opening
rosters, with 10 more on the
injured list.
Not all of them were house
hold names carrying fancy
price tags.
Some could sign in as mys
tery guests on "What's My
Line" and siump the panel.
They are more than happy to
be playing for the minimum
salary of $30,000. After all, it
beats unemployment.
Take Paul Dawkins. The
6-foot-5 forward averaged 26.7
points per game for Northern
Illinois last season, but appa
rently didn't make much of an
impression on the pro scouts.
He lasted till the 10th and final
round of the NBA draft before
being picked up by Utah, No.
185 of the 202 players chosen.
Yet Dawkins made the roster
of the Jazz — beating out,
among others, the club's No. 1
pick, forward Larry Knight of
Chicago Loyola.

Then there's Hollis Cope
land. The 6-foot-5 forward
from Rutgers was the last
player cut by Denver a year
ago, but he decided to give pro
ball one more shot.
The New York Knicks invited
him to their rookie-free agent
camp, liked what they saw and
invited him back to the regular
camp.
Copeland kept on playing
well every chance he got, and
when the final cuts came
down, Copeland made the
squad — beating out veterans
Glen Gondrezick and John
Rudd.
