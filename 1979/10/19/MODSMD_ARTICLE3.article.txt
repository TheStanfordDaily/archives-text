Under-dogging the 'cats
judging by their performance so'far, one might
conclude that the Cardinals fare best when book
makers rate them as underdogs. Fortunately, as
the team tries to keep its Rose Bowl hopes alive, it
carries that advantage into tomorrow night's game
against the Arizona Wildcats. Mike Dneal pre
views the action in Tucson on page 6.
Sci fi highs
It you find that classes don't help you under
stand what life is all about, you may want to read
the story of the meatloaf that ate Cleveland. This
tale, says award-winning science fiction writer Ben
Bova, represents an effort to bring order into the
universe, while offering a glimpse of what the fu
ture may hold.
Unless you're from Cleveland, you may want to
know what else Bova thinks about science fiction,
which he reveals in a Daily interview on page 10.
Celluoid scene
One represents the work of a mad genius,
another comes off as a Godspell with dirty jokes,
and a third, at best, resembles the plot of a TV pilot
movie. If these movies don't intrigueyou, perhaps
one or more of the others reviewed in this week's
Cinemascope will. Check page 5 for details.
Klein's line
As KSFO's "voice" of Stanford sports, Don Klein
has recorded Cardinal highs and lows for 24 years.
Today on page 7, as the Daily's Guest Greek of the
Week, he prognosticates the outcome of the game
in Arizona, as well as of other Pac-10 games around
the nation.
In addition, Cardinals water polo goalie |ohn
Ciansel tells it like it is in the Friday Interview on
page 8.
