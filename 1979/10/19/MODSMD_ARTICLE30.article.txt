# Gansel tells all to Daily

### 
Stanford already has a tradition of fielding fine
quarterbacks on its football teams, but John
Gansel may start a new custom — water polo
goaltending excellence.
The junior All-America selection, widely con
sidered to be the best at his position, talked with
Daily Friday interviewer Sally lenkins about the
nuances of his position and his sport.
(enkins: First of all, why did you get involved in
water polo as opposed to any other sport?
Gansel: I don't really know. In junior high school
I always played baseball and football. But right
before I got out for the summer the coaches told
me that if I went out for water polo as a freshman
I could start, because the goalie had just
graduated. So I had to swim all that summer to
make sure I wouldn't get left behind. And I had
to swim every summer after that to keep up.
Jenkins: So you've been swimming ever since?
Gansel: Yes.
lenkins: It must be tiring. Do you ever have a hard
time reconciling your school work and the time
you have to put in for polo?
Gansel: It's not too bad. We practice about three
hours a day, but it's right ip the middle of the
afternoon, at about 2 p.m., so you can't really
work around it. It's hard to get anything done.
But other than that I haven't had too much trou
ble.
lenkins: If Stanford had an athletic team that you
could call a machine, I would think it would be
the water polo team. What do you think?

Gansel: Well, there are four really tough teams
in the Pac-10 this year. Just the other day we got
beat by UCLA because we didn't "get up" for the
game. The rest of the teams are all equal, so I
wouldn't call us a machine. During the season
last year it might have been that way a little bit.
But once you get to the NCAA Championships
everyone just gets sky-high.
Jenkins: Have you ever felt that the fans at Stan
ford take a good water polo team for granted?
Gansel: I don't know if it's a question of taking it
tor granted as muih > being interested in the
game. I don't think anyone pays much attention.
For one thing, after having a championship
team, I think that everyone expects you to start
at the end of the last year. But it's not like that,
you have to start from the very beginning.
Jenkins: Did you come to Stanford specifically to
play water polo?
Gansel: No. I came here for the academics. I
could have played for UCLA or USC: they have
excellent teams also. But I chose Stanford —
they were champions that year, so the water
polo was really attractive, but it was like a very
nice fringe benefit.
Jenkins: How do you feel about the team as a
whole at this pointi Particularly after the loss to
UCLAf
Gansel: I think we have the best six or seven
single players in the nation in our starting
lineup. But the problem is playing like a team.
Everyone was a star on his team in high school,
so they try and do it all by themselves.
Jenkins: Why did you decide to play goalie? It's
certainly not the most glamorous position to
play.
Gansel: Well, when I started playing in high
school I couldn't really swim like everyone else,
so the coach stuck me back in the goal. I was
kind of reckless in high school. I liked to get my
face in the way. I'm a little more careful now.
Jenkins: Was there any position you wanted to
play?
Gansel: Yeah, I wanted to be a field player. It
always seemed like the most fun.

Gansel: No. I came here for the academics. I
could have played for UCLA or USC: they have
excellent teams also. But I chose Stanford —
they were champions that year, so the water
polo was really attractive, but it was like a very
nice fringe benefit.
Jenkins: How do you feel about the team as a
whole at this pointi Particularly after the loss to
UCLAf
Gansel: I think we have the best six or seven
single players in the nation in our starting
lineup. But the problem is playing like a team.
Everyone was a star on his team in high school,
so they try and do it all by themselves.
Jenkins: Why did you decide to play goalie? It's
certainly not the most glamorous position to
play.
Gansel: Well, when I started playing in high
school I couldn't really swim like everyone else,
so the coach stuck me back in the goal. I was
kind of reckless in high school. I liked to get my
face in the way. I'm a little more careful now.
Jenkins: Was there any position you wanted to
play?
Gansel: Yeah, I wanted to be a field player. It
always seemed like the most fun.

Stanford already has a tradition of fielding fine
quarterbacks on its football teams, but John
Gansel may start a new custom — water polo
goaltending excellence.
The junior All-America selection, widely con
sidered to be the best at his position, talked with
Daily Friday interviewer Sally lenkins about the
nuances of his position and his sport.
(enkins: First of all, why did you get involved in
water polo as opposed to any other sport?
Gansel: I don't really know. In junior high school
I always played baseball and football. But right
before I got out for the summer the coaches told
me that if I went out for water polo as a freshman
I could start, because the goalie had just
graduated. So I had to swim all that summer to
make sure I wouldn't get left behind. And I had
to swim every summer after that to keep up.
Jenkins: So you've been swimming ever since?
Gansel: Yes.
lenkins: It must be tiring. Do you ever have a hard
time reconciling your school work and the time
you have to put in for polo?
Gansel: It's not too bad. We practice about three
hours a day, but it's right ip the middle of the
afternoon, at about 2 p.m., so you can't really
work around it. It's hard to get anything done.
But other than that I haven't had too much trou
ble.
lenkins: If Stanford had an athletic team that you
could call a machine, I would think it would be
the water polo team. What do you think?

Gansel: Well, there are four really tough teams
in the Pac-10 this year. Just the other day we got
beat by UCLA because we didn't "get up" for the
game. The rest of the teams are all equal, so I
wouldn't call us a machine. During the season
last year it might have been that way a little bit.
But once you get to the NCAA Championships
everyone just gets sky-high.
Jenkins: Have you ever felt that the fans at Stan
ford take a good water polo team for granted?
Gansel: I don't know if it's a question of taking it
tor granted as muih > being interested in the
game. I don't think anyone pays much attention.
For one thing, after having a championship
team, I think that everyone expects you to start
at the end of the last year. But it's not like that,
you have to start from the very beginning.
Jenkins: Did you come to Stanford specifically to
play water polo?
Gansel: No. I came here for the academics. I
could have played for UCLA or USC: they have
excellent teams also. But I chose Stanford —
they were champions that year, so the water
polo was really attractive, but it was like a very
nice fringe benefit.
