# Giving a glimpse of what the future might be

### Daily interview by Brad Brockbank 
Ben Bova was born and grew
up in South Philadelphia, in
■neighborhoods he says "we
ren't good enough to get into
Sylvester Stallone movies." He
went on to study journalism at
Temple University and worked
as a copy hoy for the Philadel
phia Inquirer.
After a stint working in the
aerospace industry, he became
a successful science fiction wri
ter. In the early 19705, he was
hired as editor of Analog
magazine, where he sub
sequently won five consecu
tive Hugo Awards for editing. A
year ago, he left Analog to write
full-time but instead decided
to accept the fiction editorship
of Omni, a new publication. In
August he was again honored
with the Hugo for Best Profes
sional Editor.
The following are excerpts
from an interview conducted
with Bova two weeks ago in San
Francisco.

Daily: Was becoming a science
fiction author and editor a
oream, or did you just kind of
happen upon it?
Bova: I never really planned to
be an editor. I've always
wanted to be a writer just to
write full-time. I've always
thought that was a marvelous
thing to do. One of these days
I'm going to try it!!
I became an editor after
working about 20 years in the
aerospace industry. I was
asked to take over Analog
magazine after John Campbell
died. It was sort of a shock to
me, but it's a little like being
asked to run for the presi
dency: you may be afraid that
you can't do it right, but you
don't say no.
So I went to Analog, stayed
about seven years, and then I
quit to be a full-time writer at
long last. But about 10 minutes
later, Bob Guccione came
along with Omni magazine and
I wound up being the science
fiction editor there.
Dhily: When did you write your
first novel?
Bova: Around 1949-1950, I
wtate a novel which was never
published, which like all first

novels of budding sf writers in
those days — wasanovel about
man's first trip to the moon.
The scenario I wrote out was
that the Russians were far
ahead of us in space activities,
and the U.S. launched a crash
program to get men to the
moon before the Russians did.
Many publishers |ust sent it
back with no comments. One
was kind enough to say, "This
isn't as bad as some of the sf we
do publish, but there's a

Senator )oseph McCarthy up in
Wisconsin who'd make life
miserable for you and me it I
published this."
So he encouraged me to
write something that was far
removed Irom politics and as
the years went by, I finally took
his advice and wrote what I still
consider to be the worst thud
and-blunder novel I've ever
seen. It's so bad, the only copy
of the book I have in my home
is in (apanese.
Daily: What was happening in
st during the 60s?
Bova: The 60s was a very turbu
lent decade for everybody. In
sf, we had a group ot young
writers come up with some
thing that got to be called the
New Wave — it's a little hard to
define, but basically, New
Wave stories were marked by

. . . it's to help you understand what life is
all about. That sounds awfully grandiose for
a story about a meat I oaf that eats
Cleveland. . .

an emphasis on style. Lois of
experimental writing that was a
box-offit e disaster.
Publishers found that al
though it impressed them
literarily, it really bombed out
at the newsstands. New Wave
insisted on more color, deeper
characterizations, a fuller rep
resentation of human life.
Sf had been very uptight

about sex. Ever since Hugo
Gernsba* k created the first st
pulp magazine back in 192b,
the dominant part of sf's read
ership had been teenage
males. Their guardians always
insisted that they be kept from
the bitter truths of the world,
so they were protected from
foul language and any discus
sions of sex.
In st, none of that appeared
until the 60s. Then, writers
seemed to take delight in flout-

B( X )KS

ing it before their readers.
There were huge arguments
about the use of it.
When Norman Spinrad's
novel Hug lack Baron was tirst
published, no magazine in the
States would touch it. It was
serialized in a British sf
magazine that had been par
tially funded by an arts grant
Irom, essentially, the British
government. A member of Par
liament got up and decried the
tact that the taxpayers' money
was being spent on this tilth
and perversion written by "a
nameless degenerate." So
whenever I meet Norman, I ask
how the old nameless degen
erate is doing,
Daily: What do you see as the
role ot st in society?
Bova: like any literature, its
role is to entertain and inform

the reader. Sort of like the role
of mythology, it's to help you
pass the crises in life, to help
you understand what life is all
about. That sounds awfully
grandiose for a story about a
meatloaf that eats Cleveland,
but at heart, I think that's what
all writers are trying to do.
It's an attempt to bring order
into the universe. St uses the

scientific knowledge that
we've built up as a framework
tor understanding the universe
and our place in it. Every cul
ture had a rfiythology. Earlier
mythologies used earlier sys
tems of belief. The mythology
of today can be thought of as
sf, and certainly the system of
belief that it leans on is the sci
entific set of understandings
that we have.
Daily: Tell me about your new
novel, Kinsman.

Bova: Well, Kinsman is a
character who, more or less,
carries in his own body all the
good and bad of our moving
into space.
He's a very emotional young
man who wants to be an as
tronaut and joins the Air Force
as the quickest way to get into
space. He views space more or
less as a Garden of Eden, and
he is both Adam and the snake.
He brings love into space —
he's the first man to make love
with a woman in zero-gravity —
he also brings murder into
space. He kills a Russian cos
monaut. And without realizing
if until very late in the game, he
is also bringing the whole
military complex into space.
He wants spat e to be a place
tor new human adventure; and
because he is a military man
himself, even though he
doesn't really like the military
life very much and is a very
unmilitary officer, perforce he
brings military interest and
military activities into space.
Daily: What's the market like
tor new sf today?
Bova: Oh, it's quite good.
Close to 15 percent of all the
new fiction books published in
the U.S. are sf. Magazines,
such as Omni of course, have
been a huge success. I am wait
ing for more competition for
Omni. Several publishers are
talking about it, but only in
terms of science fact. . . I think

they're missing an important
part of Omni's success, which
is the fiction.
It gives a different view, and I
think only in sf can you really
talk about the future in terms
that are meaningful to an indi
vidual reader. It's well and
good to look at what the scien
tists have to say, but when they
talk about the future they're
almost always wrong.
It's all well and good to look
at the political implications and
the ideas of today, but if you
want to see how these ideas
will affect human beings, how
they will change the way we
live and think, you've got to do
it with fiction. It's the only way
to get the human emotions
into it. Sf stories don't predict
the future, but they give you a
glimpse of what a possible fu
ture might be.
