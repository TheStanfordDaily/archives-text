# Putting art before life
## 
### 
While Ben Bova predicts a
rosy future for science fic
tion — and particularly his
branch of it, the "hard,"
technological variety —
there is no denying that the
most popular branch is sci
ence fantasy.
Ever since The Lord of the
Rings, bookstores have
been deluged with luridly
covered, often semi
pornographic, always vio
lent, fantasies.
Ihe art, in fact, is often
the best feature of these
tomes. Ergo, the Brothers
Hildebrandt have taken the
next logical step — Ur
shurak, a novel written to il
lustrate their artwork.

I hi" Brothers, famous for
their work on lord of the
Kings < alendars and the Star
Wars poster (that's right,
the one that made Carrie
Fisher look alluring), pro
vided t(> c olor paintings and
over HO blac k-and-white
drawings (two of which are
reproduced here). Author
Jerry Nichols provided 400
pages of the most wooden
prose this side of Richard
Bach.
Surprisingly enough,
while the text was being
written, the movie score
was being composed. One
would think that the
Brothers had planned it that
way.
