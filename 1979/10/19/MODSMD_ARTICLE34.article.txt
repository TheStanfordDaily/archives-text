Even the most dedicated of
newspaper readers may have
read enough about strikes
lately to last them a lifetime,
with the recent San Francisco
Federation of Teachers' prot
racted dispute. Nevertheless,
Robert Houston's latest novel,
Bisbee 17, based on a strike

which was called by the
Wobblies (the IWW) against
Phelps-Dodge in Bisbee, Ariz.,
belongs on your "must" read
ing list for 1979
Many writers have lived in
the West, but relatively few
have written about it success
fully. Houston's work is not an
entry into a vacuum, but it is in
a category in which there is
plenty of room for quality.
The author has chosen a
good subject, and an impor
tant one. Bisbee is an undisco

vered tourist mecca south of
Tucson which retains much of
its original mining camp flavor.
The strike was an event critical
to the development of the
labor movement in the West.
The cast of characters, some
real, some fictional, are gener
ally larger than life, in the clas
sic western tradition. There's
one-eyed "Big Bill" Haywood,
leader of the Wobblies, in Stet
son and black western-cut suit.
Mother lones, 87, and "still the
best cop baiter in the country,"
makes an appearance. Coinci

dentally, the article this book is
based on was first published in
Mother Jones magazine.
The best and most affecting
characterization, however, is
that of lawman Harry C.
Wheeler, "the last of the real
sheriffs." Formerly comman
der of the Arizona Rangers and
"able to hit 197 out of any 200
bull's-eyes," his story is one
that has worked in many west
erns before. Wheeler repre
sents the passing of the Old
West. He remarks that he was
lucky to have become sheriff of

"the roughest county in the
West (Cochise) before the pus
sies took that away, too."
Where do Houston's sym
pathies lie? The best indication
may be in the use of an intro
ductory quote from Joe Hill,
early labor organizer and folk
hero: "If you don't know the
reason why/Just strike for bet
ter wages,/And then, my
friends — if you don't die —
/You'll sing this song forages."
It's been said that in Arizona,
the three main industries are
old people, the Mafia and cop
per, not necessarily in that or
der. This strike was especially
significant because it was cal
led in a state which supplied
much of the copper for the
munitions and other war
related industries. It was World
War I, and the mood of the
country was wildly patriotic,
when hamburger steak be
came Salisbury steak. It was
not merely a dispute between
management and labor; it con
tained elements of class strug
gle, disillusionment with the
American dream, and opposi
tion to "J.P. Morgan's war."
Houston never forgets that
the novel can entertain as well
as instruct. Interspersed with
the drama of the strike and the
actions of the participants is
the romantic conflict of the
strikeorganizer, Elizabeth Cur
ley Flynn. It is uncommon to
find female charac
ters in western works, but
Flynn is the real article. She is
forced to choose between hei

ex-husband Bo Whitley, who is
leading the Bisbee strike, and
her Italian anarchist lover. She
is spared the decision by Bo's
gruesome murder at the hands
of strike breakers.
The book is composed so
that the reader views the action
through the eyes of a different
character in each chapter.
Though hardly innovative, the

device works well, and neither
the flow nor the action falters.
People should be watching
for the next novel by this prom
ising writer, now teaching at
the University of Arizona at
Tucson. His two previous
novels were/4 Drive with Ossie
and Monday, Tuesday, Wed
nesday!
