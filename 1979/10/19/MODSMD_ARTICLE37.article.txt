Apocalypse Now * ★ * *
Old Mill
Century 21, San Jose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppo
la exhibits a firmly-balanced intel
ligence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; he employs Conrad's
essential narrative but not his point
of view. Aided by brilliant
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images
of Vietnam that combine frighten
ing energy and. intensity with

humor, sensuality and overwhelm
ing evil. Coppola structures a jour
ney into almost literal hell that will
engross — horribly fascinate —
some, and turn away others.
Apocalypse Now is, I think, the
best American movie of this de
cade. It has almost untenable am
bitions, but the profound ques
tions that it confronts you with jus
tify the seeming craziness of this
"impossible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.
— Ron Lillejord
The Deer Hunter # # ★
New Varsity, Sunday-Tuesday
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is

confusing or contradictory or
both. But it's among the best war
movies ever made. Very little of the
"tell 'em I died for Betty" bullshit
that |ohn Wayne-types keep croak
ing on the shores of Iwo Jima; the
movie puts you face to face with
the horror of the thing.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse
of "realistic" redundancies — they
make sure that we hardly ever
notice. In the picture's central per
formance, Robert De Niro is starkly
individualistic in much the same
way that he has been starkly indi
vidualistic in practically everything

else he's made —and occasionally
he restores the movie when things
get out of shape. The Deer Hun
ter is more than a little missha
pen — sometimes unbelievably
wrong — but there is a masterpiece
buried in there somewhere, and it
more than repays an attempt at ex
cavation.
— |ohn Nielsen
Norma Rae * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 &9:15 p.m.
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
lights to unionize the
textile factory where she works.
Sally Field, in the title role, gives an
assured and very likeable perfor
mance; her days as The Flying Nun

seem far behind as she breathes
life into her rolling-gaited,
Southern-accented character. This
is a "small" movie in the same way
that An Unmarried Woman was
small — the emphasis is more on
exploring character than exploit
ing action. Ron Leibman and Beau
Bridges co-star.
—Jim Mattson
Life of Brian * ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This movie is sort of like Cods/jell
with dirty jokes. Several brilliant
sketches are lost in the drivel; it's all

funny, but it goes on for much too
long. Python takes aim at biblical
epics, terrorist logisticsand thePLO;
while they don't always score, even a
series of bullseyes would be boring.
A Python movie needs a better plot
than the Bible can provide.
—Mike Hale
And Justice For All *
Palo Alto Square
About 10 years ago, this film
would have made a great TV pilot
movie, and that's probably the best
that can be said for it. Lots of the
"can the honest, crusading lawyer
keep his integrity in the ugly, dog
eat-dog world of criminals, dirty at
torneys and dishonest judgesf"-
type conflict. Director Norman
lewison, who should know better,

directs the shallow dramatics
and cheap comedy in the script
with an embarrassing earnestness.
Al Pacino has never seemed so or
dinary; by sheer force of will, he's
interesting, but the biggest ques
tion this movie may leave you with
is "will Al Pacino be successful in
his bid for a weekly series?" Pacino
must be more ambitious than that.
— R.L.
Harold and Maude * * *
Old Mill, Midnight special
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodness of humanity. It's clear
from the beginning that the two
are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby, recently nominated foran
Oscar for Coming Home, di
rected this invigorating cult
comedy. The two principals are
played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Cordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.
—J.M.
Giant * * *
Friday, Kresge 7:30 p.m.
At this stage in his career, di
rector George Stevens (Shane)
was obsessed with making big,
slow-moving epics, regardless of
the subject. On at least one level,
this movie is supposed to be
"about Texas," but of the main
characters, only lames Dean rises
to larger-than-life status.
Elizabeth Taylor is intermittently
good, and Rock Hudson is com
pletely undone by the sheer size
of the film. Dean's performance
was his last, not his best, but he
dominates Giant, playing a seem
ingly worthless kid who becomes
one of the most powerful men in
Texas.
City Lights ★ * ★ ★
Monday, Cubberley 7:30 p.m.
In his first "sound" movie,
Charlie Chaplin made what is
probably his most mature, fully
emotional work. Actually, Chap
lin used no dialogue, instead
employing only music and sound
effects. Chaplin rightly guessed
that his story of a tramp who, mag
ically or accidentally, is able to
restore a blind girl's sight needed
no words. A classic comedy;
Chaplin and Virginia Cherill, as
the blind girl, are both astonish
ing.
— R.L.
The Lavender Hill Mob * ★ ★ ★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
One of the great early '50s Alec
Guinness comedies; Guinness
plays the familiar nondescript
character who is thought to be
harmless enough to be in charge
of shippinggoldbullion from the
smelters to the vault. As always.
Guinness has been underesti
mated. The laughs are fine-tuned
and subtle, perhaps an unfamiliar
quality to American audiences.
But Guinness' performance
knows no limitations; there's a
controlled madness in his eyes,
and he's almost hypnotic. With
Stanley Holloway and Sidney
lames; T.E.B. Clarke wrote the
script.

Northern Lights ★ * ★ ★
Surf, San Francisco
A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
plan to think about it and not just
bask in its glow. Artful black
and-white cinematography com
bines with new directing skills
and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but'
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden
Camera Award for the best fea
ture film this year. See it for its
human characterizations and

poignant plot. A thinking per
son's movie.
—Seth Zuckerman
Lund ★ *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts ap .arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's first English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo

graphy in Apocalypse Slow) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it. In a very different role, (ill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered perfor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best tiling
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.

The Ladykillers * * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alio
This 1955 rather macabre comic
gem again stars Alec: Guinness,
but this time he is a bumbler:
supposedly a master criminal,
Guinness can't figure out how to
knock off a seemingly harmless
old lady. Instead, he and his
cohorts manage to wipe out each
other. A wonderfully dark fan
tasy, starring Peter Sellers and
Herbert Lorn (who later teamed
up in the Pink Panther movies),
along with Cecil Parker and
Danny Green. Alexander Mac -
kendrick directed.

Starting Over ★
Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above the level of
uninspired '40s romantic com-

Excellent
Good
Fair
Better than TV
Guano

edy: couple gets divorced, man
looks for someone new, lots of
"comic misadventures" along
the way, man finally finds some
one, his wife tries to take back,
man forced to choose between
his ex-wite and new love. The
major "suspense" concerns who
he will pick. Not exactly your
wonderfully novel movie idea.
But all that wouldn't matter
much if the movie were carried
off with the kind ol winking light
ness that Burt Reynolds' perfor
mance here continually delivers.
)ill Clayburgh is wasted. Candice
Bergen is supposed to be bad —
and she's successful. Director
Alan Pakula (Klute, All The Presi-

dent's Men) is more at home with
drama; his comic touch is, at
best, unsure. No matter what
Burt Reynolds is in, it seems, he
ends up being the only reason to
see it.

The Seduction of foe Tynan * * *
Guild, Mcnlo Park
Alan Alda plays a dashing
young liberal senator from New
York whose rising career begins
to leave his wife and daughter
behind. Meryl Streep plays a
talented lobbyist who picks up
fhe loose ends of Alda's life. But
in the end, well, we'll find out by
Thanksgiving. A good film prob
ing the problems of being both a
pfolitician and a person.
— Rob Lempert


Looking more like Michael Corleone than a "crusading lawyer," Al Pacino struggles through
the schlocky And lustice For All.


Jill Clayburgh has it a little better than Pacino, but Bernardo Bertolucci's Luna spends much of its
time trying to figure out where it should go.
