negotiation," Harris told reporters. "Therefore,
the department is today initiating the process of
referring this matter to the Department of Justice
for appropriate action!"
She said the referral will take place in 10 days
"unless Chicago submits and acceptable desegre
gation plan." The 10-day interim is required by

for instance, is 5-foot-11. In the other it is 5-foot
-9," she said.
'Bombs' found in party offices
New York — Apparent pipe bombs were found
in the Democratic and Republican committee of
fices in midtown Manhattan yesterday, police
said. The devices were removed by the bomb
squad without incident.
It was not immediately known whether the'de
vices were explosive. An initial police report indi
cated the device found at the Republican offices
had all the components of a bomb, but could not
explode.
A spokeswoman at the Democratic State Com
mittee headquarters on East 42nd Street said the
cylindrical device, which was attached to a watch,
was found shortly after an anonymous male tele
phone caller warned "There's a bomb in the of
fice; this is no joke."
The call came at 11:10 a.m., said Joan Rothstein
of the Democratic state committee headquarters.
She said the man had a"strong voice," and did not
mention any affiliation with any radical under
ground group.
About 20 minutes later, a security man at the
Roosevelt Hotel found a similar device in the of
tices ot the Republican County Committee on the
hotel's second floor.
Nobel goes to Greek lyric poet
Stockholm — The Nobel Prize in literature was
awarded today to Greek poet Odysseus Elytis,
whose lyrical work portrays man's struggles
against the background of Aegean landscape and
Greek tradition.
The Swedish Academy of Letters' selection of
the bB-year-old Elytis, who is not widely known
outside his homeland, came as a surprise to many
observers of the international literary scene. But
the academy has often chosen aged and exclusive
poets — recent examples are Spaniard Vicente
Aleixandre in 1977, Italian Eugenio Montale in 1975
and Swede Harry Martinson in 1974.
Elytis is the 1 second Creek poet to receive the
coveted award, which this year carries a cash sum
of $190,000. Giorgos Seferis won it in 1963.
Khomeini calls halt to executions
London — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
religious leader, has ordered a halt to all execu
tions throughout the country until further notice,
Tehran Radio reported yesterday.
The official radio, monitored in London, said
announcement ot the execution ban was made by
Iran's general prosecutor's office.
The daily newspaper, Kanidad, reported the
order was forwarded to the central office of the
Islamic revolutionary court in Tehran and would

be dispatched from there to all city and provincial
revolutionary courts, the radio said.
Executions have been a common occurrence
since Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's regime was
overthrown in February and replaced by an Islamic
Republic government whose driving force has
been Khomeini, spiritual leader of the predomin
antly Shiite Moslem nation.
Many of those reported executed have been
members of the former government, former
agents of the shah's disbanded SAVAK security
force and others deemed "counter
revolutionaries" by the Islamic courts.
Report recommends gay priests
London — After pondering the controversial
subject for five years, the Church of England pro
duced a report today saying that homosexual rela
tionships can be justified and recommending that
homosexuals not be barred from the preisthood.
It rejected the concept of marriage between
homosexuals, though, prompting a gay Christian
group to term the report "wolly-minded."
Two bishops involved in preparing the report
clashed over its findings and the church's Board of
Social Responsibility, which ordered the inquiry,
said it was "deeply divided" about the result.
Release of the 34,000-word report and the at
tached 3500-word critical comment follows last
month's decision by the U.S. Episcopalian
Church's House of Bishops that it is "not approp
riate" to ordain a practicing homosexual.
The 3 million American Episcopalians belong to
the 65-million member Anglican Communion,
which has its center in the Church of England.
The Rt. Rev. Graham Leonard, Bishop of Truro
and chairman of the board, wrote in a foreward
that his members have "not adopted or endorsed
the contents" of the report.
"The question of homosexuality," he said,
"raises questions to do with the authority of scrip
ture and the church's tradition. We do not think
the Church of England is yet ready to declare its
mind on the subject of homosexuality."
Bishops should not refuse to ordain a man into
the clergy merely because he is a homosexual, the
report said. It also proposed that the homosexual
age of consent in England be reduced from 21 to
18.

Report recommends gay priests
London — After pondering the controversial
subject for five years, the Church of England pro
duced a report today saying that homosexual rela
tionships can be justified and recommending that
homosexuals not be barred from the preisthood.
It rejected the concept of marriage between
homosexuals, though, prompting a gay Christian
group to term the report "wolly-minded."
Two bishops involved in preparing the report
clashed over its findings and the church's Board of
Social Responsibility, which ordered the inquiry,
said it was "deeply divided" about the result.
Release of the 34,000-word report and the at
tached 3500-word critical comment follows last
month's decision by the U.S. Episcopalian
Church's House of Bishops that it is "not approp
riate" to ordain a practicing homosexual.
The 3 million American Episcopalians belong to
the 65-million member Anglican Communion,
which has its center in the Church of England.
The Rt. Rev. Graham Leonard, Bishop of Truro
and chairman of the board, wrote in a foreward
that his members have "not adopted or endorsed
the contents" of the report.
"The question of homosexuality," he said,
"raises questions to do with the authority of scrip
ture and the church's tradition. We do not think
the Church of England is yet ready to declare its
mind on the subject of homosexuality."
Bishops should not refuse to ordain a man into
the clergy merely because he is a homosexual, the
report said. It also proposed that the homosexual
age of consent in England be reduced from 21 to
18.

in the Oswald grave, then filed a lawsuit. He lost
again, and his lawsuit is pending in the ci.vil appe
als court.
Dr. Linda Norton, assistant Dallas County medi
cal examiner, said Eddowes' attorney approached
Dallas authorities last August and presented evi
dence casting doubt on the Oswald burial.
"The discrepancies were numerous — scars on
the body, color of the eyes, height. The differ
ences show up between his Army entrance re
cords in 195f0 and the autopsy. In one his height,
for instance, is 5-foot-11. In the other it is 5-foot
-9," she said.
'Bombs' found in party offices
New York — Apparent pipe bombs were found
in the Democratic and Republican committee of
fices in midtown Manhattan yesterday, police
said. The devices were removed by the bomb
squad without incident.
It was not immediately known whether the'de
vices were explosive. An initial police report indi
cated the device found at the Republican offices
had all the components of a bomb, but could not
explode.
A spokeswoman at the Democratic State Com
mittee headquarters on East 42nd Street said the
cylindrical device, which was attached to a watch,
was found shortly after an anonymous male tele
phone caller warned "There's a bomb in the of
fice; this is no joke."
The call came at 11:10 a.m., said Joan Rothstein
of the Democratic state committee headquarters.
She said the man had a"strong voice," and did not
mention any affiliation with any radical under
ground group.
About 20 minutes later, a security man at the
Roosevelt Hotel found a similar device in the of
tices ot the Republican County Committee on the
hotel's second floor.
Nobel goes to Greek lyric poet
Stockholm — The Nobel Prize in literature was
awarded today to Greek poet Odysseus Elytis,
whose lyrical work portrays man's struggles
against the background of Aegean landscape and
Greek tradition.
The Swedish Academy of Letters' selection of
the bB-year-old Elytis, who is not widely known
outside his homeland, came as a surprise to many
observers of the international literary scene. But
the academy has often chosen aged and exclusive
poets — recent examples are Spaniard Vicente
Aleixandre in 1977, Italian Eugenio Montale in 1975
and Swede Harry Martinson in 1974.
Elytis is the 1 second Creek poet to receive the
coveted award, which this year carries a cash sum
of $190,000. Giorgos Seferis won it in 1963.
Khomeini calls halt to executions
London — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
religious leader, has ordered a halt to all execu
tions throughout the country until further notice,
Tehran Radio reported yesterday.
The official radio, monitored in London, said
announcement ot the execution ban was made by
Iran's general prosecutor's office.
The daily newspaper, Kanidad, reported the
order was forwarded to the central office of the
Islamic revolutionary court in Tehran and would

be dispatched from there to all city and provincial
revolutionary courts, the radio said.
Executions have been a common occurrence
since Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's regime was
overthrown in February and replaced by an Islamic
Republic government whose driving force has
been Khomeini, spiritual leader of the predomin
antly Shiite Moslem nation.
Many of those reported executed have been
members of the former government, former
agents of the shah's disbanded SAVAK security
force and others deemed "counter
revolutionaries" by the Islamic courts.
Report recommends gay priests
London — After pondering the controversial
subject for five years, the Church of England pro
duced a report today saying that homosexual rela
tionships can be justified and recommending that
homosexuals not be barred from the preisthood.
It rejected the concept of marriage between
homosexuals, though, prompting a gay Christian
group to term the report "wolly-minded."
Two bishops involved in preparing the report
clashed over its findings and the church's Board of
Social Responsibility, which ordered the inquiry,
said it was "deeply divided" about the result.
Release of the 34,000-word report and the at
tached 3500-word critical comment follows last
month's decision by the U.S. Episcopalian
Church's House of Bishops that it is "not approp
riate" to ordain a practicing homosexual.
The 3 million American Episcopalians belong to
the 65-million member Anglican Communion,
which has its center in the Church of England.
The Rt. Rev. Graham Leonard, Bishop of Truro
and chairman of the board, wrote in a foreward
that his members have "not adopted or endorsed
the contents" of the report.
"The question of homosexuality," he said,
"raises questions to do with the authority of scrip
ture and the church's tradition. We do not think
the Church of England is yet ready to declare its
mind on the subject of homosexuality."
Bishops should not refuse to ordain a man into
the clergy merely because he is a homosexual, the
report said. It also proposed that the homosexual
age of consent in England be reduced from 21 to
18.

School desegregation suit asked
Washington — HEW Secretary Patricia Roberts
Harris, saying that negotiations have failed to
achieve an agreement with Chicago over school
desegregation, announced yesterday that she was
asking the Justice Dept. to take the city to court.
Her action will initiate one of the largest school
desegregation court cases in the nation's history.
The secretary of Health, Education and Welfare
told a news conference that Chicago school
Superintendent Joseph Hannon, in a letter Wed
nesday, had rejected HEW's charges that Chicago
had deliberately fostered school desegregation
for 40 years.
On Wednesday, the Chicago Board of Education
also rejected, 7-2, HEW's conditions for extending
the deadline for settlement by two months.
"I have concluded that compliance cannot be
secured by voluntary means, and I cannot in good
conscience agree to further delay in the guise of
negotiation," Harris told reporters. "Therefore,
the department is today initiating the process of
referring this matter to the Department of Justice
for appropriate action!"
She said the referral will take place in 10 days
"unless Chicago submits and acceptable desegre
gation plan." The 10-day interim is required by
federal regulations in the Civil Rights Act.
