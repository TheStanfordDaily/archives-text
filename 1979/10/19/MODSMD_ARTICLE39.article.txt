# Gas laws forgotten as fuel crunch eases
## 
### Eileen Delehanty 
Students with cars having even
numbered license plates can buy gas
at Santa Clara county stations today,
even though it's an odd day.
Gov. Jerry Brown released Santa
Clara County from the odd-even
emergency gas program earlier this
week after county officials told him
that "the problem odd-even was de
signed to solve no longer exists
here."
The program, initiated five months
ago to provide some relief for long
gas lines and conserve fuel supplies,
is still enforced in the Bay Area coun
ties of Contra Costa, San Francisco
and San Mateo.
San Mateo, however, is planning
todiscussa possible withdrawal from
the system at a county meeting Tues
day night.
Response from Palo Alto service
station owners to Brown's decision
was positive, with every station sur
veyed expressing relief at the end of
the plan.
"The odd-even was kept on a
month or two too long," said Gary
Roe, manager of Charleston Shell.
TerryTurlacherof Palo Altosaid he
feels the plan was useless because
"there was no enforcement at all to
wards the end."
With the end of the rationing plan
in Santa Clara County, neighboring
San Mateo County has taken steps to
do the same.
The request to drop the gas sales
program was brought up two weeks

ago by San Mateo County Supervisor
John Ward, and has been put on the
agenda for Tuesday's meeting of the
board of supervisors.
This move has pleased station
owners contacted in Menlo Park,
who are still under the effect of the
plan.
George and Bob's Chevron of
Menlo Park is "ready to get rid of the
program," according to manager
Larry )ensen.
And one service station owner re
vealed that his business hasn't fol
lowed the odd-even plan for two
months, "except on paper." The
operator (who requested anonymity)
said that there has been no need for
the program for this long.
Every station surveyed in Menlo
Park agreed that the plan is no longer
necessary to prevent long lines. In
fact, some station owners expressed
frustration because they could no
longer sell at a high volume.
"We have to stay open later and
more weekend hours to sell all our
gas, ' said Al Conley of Conley's
Mobil Service.
Vet the end of the odd-even plan
does not convince some station
managers that the fuel crisis can be
forgotten.
"We never know until the last day
of the month how much gas we will
have for the next month," said Roe.
"Everything depends upon the al
lotment we receive from the oil
company,'.' explained Turlacher.
"Who knows? Next month might be
worse."
