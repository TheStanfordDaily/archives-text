The parents of a student killed last year in a light plane
crash at Palo Alto Airport have filed a $2.25 million
wrongful death suit, charging that a poorly designed and
manufactured plane and an unqualified pilot led to the
death of their daughter.
|ohn and Audrey Eickhof, parents of crash victim
Gretchen Eickhof, filed the suit against Bellanca Aircraft
Corp., the plane manufacturer, the company which re
nted the plane to pilot leffrey Mandel, who also died in
the crash, the administrator of Mandel's estate and sev
eral other companies and persons whose names were
unknown at the time of the filing of the complaint.
All the defendents are charged with negligence and
$750,000 is asked in damages tor that alleged conduct.
In addition, ail defendents except the pilot are
charged with reckless conduct, and the Bellanca Aircraft
Corp. is charged with manufacturing a defective aircraft.
For those charges, a total of $1.5 million is asked in
damages.
Eickhof, 21, and Mandel, 19, both juniors here last
year, were killed on Oct. 12,1978, after the single engine
Bellanca Decathlon plane Mandel was piloting crashed
moments after takeoff in the marshland at the end of the
runway.
The Eickhofs claim in the suit that the plane was "de
fectively designed" and "in unsafe condition for the
purpose of flying and carrying persons."
In addition, they charge that Mandel "was an inex

perienced pilot, not properly trained, competent, or
qualified to fly" the Bellanca Decathlon plane.
Spirit of Palo Alto Aviation, Inc., the Palo Alto com
pany that rented the plane to Mandel, was charged with
negligently entrusting" the plane to the pilot.
A National Transportation Safety Board report on the
fatal crash determined that there was no malfunction in
the airplane which led to the crash. The board stated that
Mandel failed to keep sufficient flying speed after
takeoff to keep the aircraft from stalling as it attempted
its turn away from the runway.
In an investigation into the causes of the crash, a
transcript of the control tower's instructions to Mandel
revealed a possible misunderstanding which may have
caused him to change direction and stall the craft.
Mandel had logged 162 hours of flight time before he
died, according to the board. He had piloted the Bel
lanca aircraft before the crash and had been certified to
carry passengers in the plane.
His last flight in the Bellanca Decathlon was on Aug. 1,
1978, a little more than two months prior to the crash.
Eickhof, an engineering major, had flown with Mandel
before the crash, according to one friend of the two
victims.
Mandel, of Little Neck, N.Y., was an aeronautics and
astronautics major. According to Rick Grether, a pilot for
Spirit of Palo Alto Aviation, Mandel had been renting
planes from the firm for the previous year and was a
qualified aerobatics pilot.
