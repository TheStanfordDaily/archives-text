# Ballot errors slow computer count

The computerized ballot system used to count the
ASSU election ballots Wednesday night turned out to be
no faster a process than if the votes had been tallied by
hand, said Mike O'Reilly, elections commissioner.
However, he added, the slowness was due to inex
perience in working with the system. It was the first time
in several years a computer had been used to count
votes.
In past years, voting was done with paper ballots and
counters were hired to tabulate the results, often taking
the whole night to finish tallying votes.
But it was 3:30 a.m. before the counting was com
pleted by the computer. Checking and addition of each
precinct's votes were completed by 4:30 a.m., O'Reilly
said, and final unofficial results were posted at 9:30 a.m.
upon the receipt of the Florence campus vote count by
phone.
The count announced is "tentative, pending receipt of
the overseas ballots," he said, which are expected by
next Friday.
Results for the senate reform and tennis court re
ferenda will be available Monday, O'Reilly said.
Delays were caused by people who "marked the bal
lots incorrectly, using pens or making stray marks," he
explained. "We had to decide whether to accept those
ballots or not.
"When we decided to count them," he added, "we
had to go over and check each ballot to make sure it was
marked correctly before the computer would accept it."
This meant that each ballot had to be hand-fed into the
machine, causing a tremendous m the count
ing procedure, he said.
"Next year," he continued, "we plan to use a different
sort of ballot — one that is even faster and easier to
mark. In addition, we will not accept ballots that are
improperly marked,"
Despite its initial difficulties, the computerized system
still has advantages over the old system, O'Reilly said.
The computer is cheaper than human counters, he
said. Ballots cost $200 and the computer rental was $50.-
Hiring workers would have cost $350, he added.
The computerized system is more reliable, O'Reilly
added. "The computer keeps records of the results,
which the human counters had a hard time doing," he
said. This allows us to recheck the results with greater
accuracy.
"That is important when there are so many people
voting. With the big turnout that we had this year, the
computerized system is much simpler," he said.
O'Reilly said 28 percent of the student body voted.
