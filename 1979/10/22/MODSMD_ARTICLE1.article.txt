# Assessments are approved, referenda fail

In a record turnout, students ap
proved fee assessments for the Band
and the Women's Center but op
posed all senate election referenda.
"The voters were not well enough
informed," on the referenda issues,
said Election Commissioner Mike
O'Reilly. There was not enough pub
licity, and students did not under
stand the issues.
A simple majority with at least 20
percent of the student body voting
was required to pass the fee assess
ments. Twenty-eight percent of the
entire student population actually
cast ballots.
The Band's extra one-quarter fee
assessment, passed overwhelm
ingly, will finance its trip to Boston
College next year.
The new Women's Center funds
will help furnish a new office and
provide the campus with more ac
tivities and services on women's is
sues, advocates said.
Senate election reform measures
on districting, live petitions,
staggered elections and no change
were all rejected. But these ques
tions were used only to solicit stu
dent opinion to guide future senate
action. Their outcomes, therefore,
have no official significance.
The districting bill proposed that
undergraduate precincts be estab
lished by residence, while graduate
precincts would be departmentally
based. Proponents claimed the bill
would promote senate communica
tion and accountability. Critics ar
gued that it would discriminate
against minorities and special in
terest groups.
The live petition bill would allow
potential senators membership if
they collected a sufficient number of
student signatures on petitions. Ac
cording to its supporters, this mea
sure could help overcome voter
apathy by avoiding the necessity of
poll attendance. Those opposed
feared senate membership would
become too easy to obtain.
Staggered elections in the fall and
spring would have lent a sense of
community to the senate's year-by
year efforts, said advocates.
Students also expressed a need for
lighted tennis courts. The Athletic
Dept. will make the final decision on
this issue.
