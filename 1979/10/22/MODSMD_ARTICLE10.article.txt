# Navy maintains a taste of America in Cuba

Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (AP) â€” When a
show-the-flag force of 1200 U.S. Marines
landed in Fidel Castro's backyard, they
took up positions in a small community
where the people cling to such customs as
cookouts and drive-in movies.
"Gitmo," as the 45-square-mile naval
base on the tip of Cuba is popularly
known, is the only U.S. military base on
Communist soil. It is separated from the
rest of Cuba by a high fence, guards and
minefields.
Behind those barriers, 6000 military folk
and civilians spend idle moments much as
they would in any small community back
home, listening to American music on the
radio and watching American television
shows, in this case taped and flown in.
Crave Big Macs
"Sometimes you just crave a Big Mac but
all you can do is think about it,"says
Debbie Jenson, a 25-year-old Navy petty
officer third class who has been at Guan
tanamo for two years.
The naval base is maintained under a
1934 treaty between the United States and
Cuba and has been a thorn in Castro's side
since he came to power. Although the
Cuban president would like to see the
base shut down, the treaty can be dissol

ved only by mutual consent of both coun
tries.
President Jimmy Carter ordered the
landing of a Marine force last Wednesday
in a muscle-flexing exercise prompted by
the controversy over the presence of a
Russian brigade in Cuba. The Marines,
from Camp Bejeune, North Carolina, are
to remain on maneuvers for one month.
Several hundred Navy and Marine per
sonnel worked in support roles behind the
Marines who landed in helicopters and
amphibious craft on the base's rock
strewn Windmill Beach.
"It's not bad. It gives us something to
do," one Marine, who asked not to be
identified, said as he stood outside a
bunker.
There are about 2300 military men and
women at the base with the remainder of
the population made up of their families,
some American and Jamaican civilian
workers and a few Cuban refugees.
Wave to Cuba
Marine guard towers look out toward
Cuba, and their Cuban counterparts ob
serve the base from towers around the
perimeter. Guards on both sides fre
quently see each other, and sometimes
waves and gestures are exchanged.

"We fight the same mosquitoes they
tight and swat the same bugs," said Pfc.
David Overcashe, 19. "When it rains, we
both get wet. They're here for the same
reasons we are."
Guantanamo Bay is no tropical paradise.
Although trees and bushes were green last
week because of recent rain, vegetation
normally is varying shades of brown. The
base is on low-lands, surrounded by
Cuban controlled mountains, and warm
Caribbean waters lap rugged, rock-strewn
beaches.
'Good duty'
"It's good duty because it rarely rains,"
said one sailor. "Everything you do, you
do outdoors. You can go sailing or fishing,
and when you get time off, you can go to
Haiti or Jamaica to cut loose."
The military offers a wide range of recre
ational activities because residents spend
all their time at the base except for a few
days of leave a year. There are outdoor
movie theaters, with bleachers and chairs
facing a miniature drive-in movie screen,
and cookouts are a popular social pastime.
There are schools with civilian teachers
for children of military families and much
of the base social activity is geared toward
families.
