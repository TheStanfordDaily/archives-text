Mortar crews firing from inside
Cambodia pounded a Thai vil
lage marketplace with a bar
rage of 20 shells Sunday, killing
four persons and wounding
seven others. The attack,
blamed on Vietnamese troops,
heightened tensions between
Thailand and Vietnam.
It was the second such mor
tar attackagainstThai territory
in a week.
The open market in this town
120 miles east of Bangkok is
used by Cambodians who
cross the border to buy black
market items from Thai trad
ers. One of the dead was a
Cambodian, and the others
were Thais.
The area was cleared after
the shelling, but the Thai army
did not retaliate.
Thai officials said it appeared
the shells were fired by
mortar-men with the Viet

namese troops that have been
fighting inside Cambodia to
wipe out the last vestiges of
former Premier Pol Pot's guer
rilla army.
Vietnamese military opera
tions near the border in recent
months have worried the Thai
government. It has said it
would consider its border viol
ated if Vietnamese troops de
liberately enter it in hot pursuit
of Pol Pot guerrillas, if they
enter by mistake, or if they fire
mortars or artillery into it.
Market shelled
Just south of here a week
ago, mortar shells fired from
inside Cambodia killed five
Cambodians shopping at
another makeshift market.
On Saturday, Vietnam's act
ing foreign minister, Nguyen
Co Thach, in Bangkok for offi
cial talks, declared Vietnamese
troops would not enter Thai
land. "Our policy remains un
changed," he said. "Our
troops will not invade any
country and they will not cross
the border into Thailand."
The Vietnamese invaded
Cambodia in force last Christ
mas Day, ran out the Pol Pot
government, installed one
headed by Premier Heng Sam
rin and then set about mop
ping up the remnants of the
former regime.
'Temerity'
Bangkok's English-language
newspaper, The Nation, in a
page-one editorial Sunday,
said "it takes a lot of temerity"
for Thach to assure Thailand it
will not be invaded when Viet
namese troops are already
massed along the border "lob
bing shells into Thailand."
The Thai military reports
eight Vietnamese divisions, or
up to 40,000 men, are now
stationed just inside western
Cambodia.
Vietnam accuses Thailand of
aiding Pol Pot forces by allow
ing the existence of markets
like the one in Khok Sung,
where Cambodians buy food,
medicine, bicycles and bat
teries, then return to Cam
bodia.
