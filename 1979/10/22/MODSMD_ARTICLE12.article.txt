# Dink manager completes 750-mile bike race
## 
### Suzanne Smith 
Though his office is at the top of an
inconspicuous spiral staircase in the
backstage area of Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, the man who works there is
hardly cabin-bound.
He is John Hughes, manager of the
auditorium and a 1971 University
graduate. Early this September, Hughes
was one of 1550 participants in the an
nual 750 mile French bicycle race from
Paris to Brest and back. Hughes
finished in 73 hours, 63 of which were
spent on his bike.
Needless to say, those students who
complain about "the long bike ride
over to Lagunita" (or wherever) should
be duly impressed.
In high school and college Hughes
himself didn't own a bike. His career
was launched only six years ago when a
friend talked him into buying an expen
sive bike because his current one was
not holding up.
"Once I had the expensive bike, I
figured I should do something with it"
Hughes explains. So he and Ins friend
went riding up to the hills or to the
beach. "Gradually," says Hughes, "I
just kept looking for something harder
and longer."
Hughes entered a series of long,
timed rides — not races, he emphasizes
— in California. Four years ago, he
heard about the Paris-Brest affair. "I
thought, 'that sounds really hard— I'll
bet I couldn't do that.' But I kept it in
the back of my mind. Eventually, the
challenges in the U.S. ran out, and I
figured I could do the French race after
all."
Hughes' experiences in the race
make quite a story. The scariest part
came at the very beginning. Hughes'
custom-made French bike arrived three
days later than planned because of a

mixup in airline baggage handling. "For
awhile, I didn't know if I'd be in the race
at all," he says.
Fortunately, all other logistics were
under control. Barbara Harvie, a libra
rian for the University's East Asia collec
tion, came along and provided travel
and hotel Arrangements, provisions
and moral support.
Ihe start of the race was "quite an
ego trip," says Hughes. "Thousands of
people were cheering us on, and all the
roads were dosed off by policemen."
Hughes was interviewed on French
television at the first (ontrol stop. Con
trol stops were designated every 50
miles for participants to check in.
But soon elation gave way to suffer
ing. "The one time I really wanted to
quit was on the first day. It sounds odd,
but the hardest period of the race is the
ten hours after the first 30 minutes.
You're wavering between feeling good
and bad, so the bad really stands out.
After that, you've hit all your walls. You
level out at a constant fatigue, and
you've got nothing to compare that to.
"All that's really on your mind after
awhile is 'when will I be able to stop?'
Ih<* race requires a lot of concentration
and determination, fhe mental part is
harder than the physical. You have to
learn to accept the pain."
And pain there was. "I got big, raw
blisters on my butt. My hands are still
latter one and a half months) numb from
the pressure. I developed tendon prob
lems in my ankles. Fighting sleep was a
big problem." Surprisingly, "the legs
were great the whole way."
One diversion that Hughes dreamed
up was to convert miles into kilometers
and vice-versa. "You can kill a lot of
time that way," he says wryly.
Hughes spent much of the race riding
in a group. "Generally, riders of the

same caliber all cooperated. In a long
race, a few minutes don't matter so it's
not so competitive. Everyone's first
goal was to finish."
Because most of the riders spoke
only French, Hughes didn't do much
talking. "It got kind of lonely at times,"
he says.
Nevertheless, he found the French
people "very, very kind and suppor
tive. A lady offered me a massage at one
stop. French motorists would honk not
to get you out of the way but to say, 'All
right! Keep going!' "
Bike riding in France is a spectator
sport analogous to pro football in the
U.S. For this particular race, perhaps
the Super Bowl of bike riding, spec
tators chee r ed the riders on through
most of the daylight hours.
The French countryside, says
Hughes, was "very pretty, with many
little villages. It was especially beautiful
and peaceful at night, with lots of tail
and headlights glowing in the dark."
Hughes had decided in advance
where to spend the first two nights of
the race. He rode the first 280 miles
between 10 a.m. Sept. 3 and 4 a.m.
Sept. 4, then met companion Harvie at a
hotel in the town of Loudeac. Too
nervous to sleep, Hughes got up four
hours later and headed for Brest, the
midway point.
"Getting to Brest was very exciting. It
was a big uplift having made it halfway.
A lot of press were there, and we re
ceived a lot of congratulations from
"spectators." Hughes appeared on the
front page of the Brest newspaper.
Enroute back to Paris on the second
night, Hughes stopped again in
Loudeac to sleep several hours. He had
planned in advance not to sleep at all on
the third (last) night.
"The last night was extraordinarily

cold. It became very hard to stay awake.
At this point I was riding with an English
fellow. We tried to keep up a
semblance of a conversation to make
sure the other guy was awake."
"I remember the two of us stopping
for breakfast at six that morning and we
fell asleep for half an hour right at the
counter. The other racers were obvi
ously getting tired, too. People were
sleeping in ditches along the road to
catch one or two hours sleep."
Hughes says he even began to hal
lucinate near the end. "What seemed
to be huge cows turned out to be'
houses."
Hughes broke into tears at the end of
the race. "I wasn't elated — just re
lieved and tired. I'd expected to be
happy, but at first I really didn't care too
much. Hordes of spectators were ask
ing me questions, partly because I was
American, partly curious about my
bike. But I couldn't think of what to say
to them.
"About five or six hours after the
race, though, I had the most incredible
feeling of self-satisfaction. I sat there
and glowed."
Physically, Hughes was "a wreck. I
could walk only extremely slowly, and I
couldn't sleep well because of all the
sore spots."
Vicky Holt, Stanford's director of
public events, recalls, "He was notice
ably thinner after the race. His hands
were so stiff from gripping the hand
lebars that he couldn't bend them to
write."
In spite of all this, Hughes calls the
race "the experience of a lifetime. I de
cided before I went that it would be
worth it even if I didn't finish. Whether I
do it again depends on how long I take
to heal. I'd like to do this race again."
Again? Now that's a hero for you.

trol stops were designated every 50
miles for participants to check in.
But soon elation gave way to suffer
ing. "The one time I really wanted to
quit was on the first day. It sounds odd,
but the hardest period of the race is the
ten hours after the first 30 minutes.
You're wavering between feeling good
and bad, so the bad really stands out.
After that, you've hit all your walls. You
level out at a constant fatigue, and
you've got nothing to compare that to.
"All that's really on your mind after
awhile is 'when will I be able to stop?'
Ih<* race requires a lot of concentration
and determination, fhe mental part is
harder than the physical. You have to
learn to accept the pain."
And pain there was. "I got big, raw
blisters on my butt. My hands are still
latter one and a half months) numb from
the pressure. I developed tendon prob
lems in my ankles. Fighting sleep was a
big problem." Surprisingly, "the legs
were great the whole way."
One diversion that Hughes dreamed
up was to convert miles into kilometers
and vice-versa. "You can kill a lot of
time that way," he says wryly.
Hughes spent much of the race riding
in a group. "Generally, riders of the

same caliber all cooperated. In a long
race, a few minutes don't matter so it's
not so competitive. Everyone's first
goal was to finish."
Because most of the riders spoke
only French, Hughes didn't do much
talking. "It got kind of lonely at times,"
he says.
Nevertheless, he found the French
people "very, very kind and suppor
tive. A lady offered me a massage at one
stop. French motorists would honk not
to get you out of the way but to say, 'All
right! Keep going!' "
Bike riding in France is a spectator
sport analogous to pro football in the
U.S. For this particular race, perhaps
the Super Bowl of bike riding, spec
tators chee r ed the riders on through
most of the daylight hours.
The French countryside, says
Hughes, was "very pretty, with many
little villages. It was especially beautiful
and peaceful at night, with lots of tail
and headlights glowing in the dark."
Hughes had decided in advance
where to spend the first two nights of
the race. He rode the first 280 miles
between 10 a.m. Sept. 3 and 4 a.m.
Sept. 4, then met companion Harvie at a
hotel in the town of Loudeac. Too
nervous to sleep, Hughes got up four
hours later and headed for Brest, the
midway point.
"Getting to Brest was very exciting. It
was a big uplift having made it halfway.
A lot of press were there, and we re
ceived a lot of congratulations from
"spectators." Hughes appeared on the
front page of the Brest newspaper.
Enroute back to Paris on the second
night, Hughes stopped again in
Loudeac to sleep several hours. He had
planned in advance not to sleep at all on
the third (last) night.
"The last night was extraordinarily

cold. It became very hard to stay awake.
At this point I was riding with an English
fellow. We tried to keep up a
semblance of a conversation to make
sure the other guy was awake."
"I remember the two of us stopping
for breakfast at six that morning and we
fell asleep for half an hour right at the
counter. The other racers were obvi
ously getting tired, too. People were
sleeping in ditches along the road to
catch one or two hours sleep."
Hughes says he even began to hal
lucinate near the end. "What seemed
to be huge cows turned out to be'
houses."
Hughes broke into tears at the end of
the race. "I wasn't elated — just re
lieved and tired. I'd expected to be
happy, but at first I really didn't care too
much. Hordes of spectators were ask
ing me questions, partly because I was
American, partly curious about my
bike. But I couldn't think of what to say
to them.
"About five or six hours after the
race, though, I had the most incredible
feeling of self-satisfaction. I sat there
and glowed."
Physically, Hughes was "a wreck. I
could walk only extremely slowly, and I
couldn't sleep well because of all the
sore spots."
Vicky Holt, Stanford's director of
public events, recalls, "He was notice
ably thinner after the race. His hands
were so stiff from gripping the hand
lebars that he couldn't bend them to
write."
In spite of all this, Hughes calls the
race "the experience of a lifetime. I de
cided before I went that it would be
worth it even if I didn't finish. Whether I
do it again depends on how long I take
to heal. I'd like to do this race again."
Again? Now that's a hero for you.

John Hughes
Though his office is at the top of an
inconspicuous spiral staircase in the
backstage area of Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium, the man who works there is
hardly cabin-bound.
He is John Hughes, manager of the
auditorium and a 1971 University
graduate. Early this September, Hughes
was one of 1550 participants in the an
nual 750 mile French bicycle race from
Paris to Brest and back. Hughes
finished in 73 hours, 63 of which were
spent on his bike.
Needless to say, those students who
complain about "the long bike ride
over to Lagunita" (or wherever) should
be duly impressed.
In high school and college Hughes
himself didn't own a bike. His career
was launched only six years ago when a
friend talked him into buying an expen
sive bike because his current one was
not holding up.
"Once I had the expensive bike, I
figured I should do something with it"
Hughes explains. So he and Ins friend
went riding up to the hills or to the
beach. "Gradually," says Hughes, "I
just kept looking for something harder
and longer."
Hughes entered a series of long,
timed rides — not races, he emphasizes
— in California. Four years ago, he
heard about the Paris-Brest affair. "I
thought, 'that sounds really hard— I'll
bet I couldn't do that.' But I kept it in
the back of my mind. Eventually, the
challenges in the U.S. ran out, and I
figured I could do the French race after
all."
Hughes' experiences in the race
make quite a story. The scariest part
came at the very beginning. Hughes'
custom-made French bike arrived three
days later than planned because of a

mixup in airline baggage handling. "For
awhile, I didn't know if I'd be in the race
at all," he says.
Fortunately, all other logistics were
under control. Barbara Harvie, a libra
rian for the University's East Asia collec
tion, came along and provided travel
and hotel Arrangements, provisions
and moral support.
Ihe start of the race was "quite an
ego trip," says Hughes. "Thousands of
people were cheering us on, and all the
roads were dosed off by policemen."
Hughes was interviewed on French

between 10 a.m. Sept. 3 and 4 a.m.
Sept. 4, then met companion Harvie at a
hotel in the town of Loudeac. Too
nervous to sleep, Hughes got up four
hours later and headed for Brest, the
midway point.
"Getting to Brest was very exciting. It
was a big uplift having made it halfway.
A lot of press were there, and we re
ceived a lot of congratulations from
"spectators." Hughes appeared on the
front page of the Brest newspaper.
Enroute back to Paris on the second
night, Hughes stopped again in
Loudeac to sleep several hours. He had
planned in advance not to sleep at all on
the third (last) night.
"The last night was extraordinarily

cold. It became very hard to stay awake.
At this point I was riding with an English
fellow. We tried to keep up a
semblance of a conversation to make
sure the other guy was awake."
"I remember the two of us stopping
for breakfast at six that morning and we
fell asleep for half an hour right at the
counter. The other racers were obvi
ously getting tired, too. People were
sleeping in ditches along the road to
catch one or two hours sleep."
Hughes says he even began to hal
lucinate near the end. "What seemed
to be huge cows turned out to be'
houses."
Hughes broke into tears at the end of
the race. "I wasn't elated — just re
lieved and tired. I'd expected to be
happy, but at first I really didn't care too
much. Hordes of spectators were ask
ing me questions, partly because I was
American, partly curious about my
bike. But I couldn't think of what to say
to them.
"About five or six hours after the
race, though, I had the most incredible
feeling of self-satisfaction. I sat there
and glowed."
Physically, Hughes was "a wreck. I
could walk only extremely slowly, and I
couldn't sleep well because of all the
sore spots."
Vicky Holt, Stanford's director of
public events, recalls, "He was notice
ably thinner after the race. His hands
were so stiff from gripping the hand
lebars that he couldn't bend them to
write."
In spite of all this, Hughes calls the
race "the experience of a lifetime. I de
cided before I went that it would be
worth it even if I didn't finish. Whether I
do it again depends on how long I take
to heal. I'd like to do this race again."
Again? Now that's a hero for you.
