# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS

The Farm has a problem â€” mascot mania is
.. rearing its ugly head. Timm Williams' appear
ance at the UCLA game, distasteful as it was, has
refueled the controversy, and the elections will
1 not settle the problem.
Students lack direction; my own friends are
distracted; we cry out for a mascot that we can
collectively rally around.
The list of adjectives published in (he Daily
regarding the qualities of a mascot reads like
something our founders would have approved
with a tender pat on the head: strong, proud,
courageous, inspiring, entertaining.
But a Stanford mascot should symbolize
something greater, some broader vision of the
dreams and values of not only the university, but
of America. Equally, the mascot should be one
that can be magnanimously supported by the
entire "Stanford family."
Now let us look at the choices.
The Indian clearly is out since it is truly offen
sive to an ethnic group.
The Griffon? Or is it Gryphon? Most Stanford
students, the top 10 percent of their high school
classes, can't decide on the proper spelling. In
tho hands of AP's butchers, the lion-bird would
be chaotic.
Trees are an interesting idea. However, the
idea of a Sequoia is one of definite status. Let's
face it, trees stretch skyward, but they just can't
move laterally in the present day world that
demands mobility, in a nation where flexibility
and quick adaptation are the keys to success.
The Cardinals? Seriously folks, it's a cute little

bird, but it flies south in the winter, leaving the
basketball teams unsupported.
Oh, the color, I see. Well, we just as well
could be the Stanford Whites, but that could be
pretty offensive to an ethnic group.
Robber Barons is good, but not quite excel
lent. There are a big bunch of folks running
around here that have ties to certain capitalisti
cally inclined parents. We should not want to
offend them by using a caricature of a man
ipulating fascist as our mascot.
Which brings us to a solution. What symbol
encompasses the rigid requirements and is not
going to bum anyone out?
Quite simple, the Stanford Alumni is the only
viable choice. Proud, courageous, ad infinitum.
Certainly, the Stanford Alumni is a living symbol
of what Leland and Jane envisioned many years
ago.
Equally undeniable is the moral fortitude of
the Alumni. Why, judge for yourself at the next
football game. Exemplary behavior. Finally, a
Stanford divided cannot stand.
The recent elections will not leave everyone,
or even a clear majority, of the community
happy. By adopting the Stanford Alumni as our
mascot, we alleviate the possible offense caused
to any student, since each of us will someday
ascend to that hallowed state and become a
living mascot, an Alumni, a dynamic symbol of
the bold, cohesive unit that is Stanford Univer
sity.
