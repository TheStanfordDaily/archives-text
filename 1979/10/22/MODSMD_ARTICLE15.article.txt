## FDA policy lacks sense 
### 
There is little need around any university to
dwell on the evils of federal drug laws: that the
% to take marijuana or cocaine, like al
—cohol or tobacco, rightfully belongs to the indi
vidual, not government, is widely recognized.
That the same anti-prohibition policy should
•also apply to non-recreational substances like
cyclamates and Laetrile, currently
by the Food and Drug Administration,
should be evident a fortiori.
Nevertheless, Provost Donald Kennedy, re
cently returned from a stint as Commissioner of
the FDA, has continued to be outspoken in
defense of FDA regulations, right down to the
proposed saccharin ban, as recorded in a recent
interview in the Daily. It is apparently his posi
tion that FDA's technocrats know what is best
for us, and should accordingly determine what
we eat and drink.
Now, it is possible to take exception to this
paternalistic restriction of consumer choice
without ignoring the possibility that the FDA
may indeed have valuable advice to offer us as to
the possible health hazards of certain products.
The obvious alternative is to allow any food or
drug to be sold provided that is accompanied by
the relevant warnings (e.g., "Condemned by
FDA!", "Possible low-level bladder cancer
risk," etc.), with appropriate safeguards for the
protection of children and illiterates.
A moment's reflection will show that this sys
tem would be in every way superior to the
present one. Those who are satisfied to have
products banned could still boycott anything
bearing an FDA warning, while those who are
not satisfied with the FDA would be free to
consume whatever they please.
Given this possibility, it is astounding that
Kennedy should decry as "deliberate non
sense" the accusation that government is cur
rently limiting individual freedom.
On the contrary, there could be no more
blatant example of deliberate nonsense than

present federal policy on food and drugs.
Consider, for example, that while the FDA
tries to ban saccharin, the Department of Ag
riculture actively supports the tobacco industry
— despite the fact that, unlike saccharin, smoke
actually constitutes a public health nuisance.
Or consider the inconsistency of FDA's own
policy on carcinogens: while artificial food addi
tives are banned on the slightest suspicion of
carcinogenesis, far more potent natural risks are
ignored — for instance aflatoxins, which con
taminate peanut butter to a level far more
dangerous than diet soda.
In addition, present policy on food additives
is so obsessed with the threat of cancer that
other, possibly offsetting health benefits are
completely disregarded. This is especially sig
nificant for saccharin, wnose health benefits as a
dietary aid in reducing heart attack risk have
been estimated to be on the order of 10 to 100
times its apparent cancer risk.
Many experts have recommended that the
FDA ban only products that show an adverse
risk-benefit tradeoff (a suggestion with Kennedy
has in the past resisted).
But while this would clearly be preferable to
present policy, it is still a crude approach insofar
as it cannot take account of the fact that actual
health risks vary widely between persons, ac
cording to age, sex, genetic makeup, individual
environment and lifestyle.
Banning what is good for one person because
it is bad for another is both arbitrary and per
verse, but it is the inevitable result of trying to
dictate a national health orthodoxy through a
central bureaucracy like the FDA.
"In a large number of cases, what people are
mad about is not something bureaucracy can
fix," says Kennedy. So why does the FDA persist
in trying?
