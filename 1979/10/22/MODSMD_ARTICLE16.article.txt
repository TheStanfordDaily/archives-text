Satire apology
My most sincere apologies
to Francis Wong (see letter "In
sulting Racism," Daily, Oct. 18)
and to all those who took liter
ally my letter to the editor
(Daily, Oct. 10) "Why not
Cooleys?"
In it I parodied a previous let
ter, "A noble symbol" (Daily,
Oct. 8) calling for the return of
Chief Lightfoot, by proposing
that there be a new name, "The
Stanford Cooley's," for the
mascot.
I used much of the same text
as the previous letter, sub
stituting "Asian Americans"
and "Cooleys" for "native
American" and "Chief Light
foot."
I had hoped that, by applying
its argument to a different
ethnic group with different
stereotypes, the essential ra
cism would be revealed, and
that the inhumanity of making
any group of real, living people
into a pet would become obvi
ous.
The discussion of my letter
makes the same points I was
making. In particular, the his
tory of Asians in this state,
which I had alluded to, and he
detailed, is important for all to
know.
I should add myself, how
ever, that what was so distres
sing about the original "Noble
symbol" letter was its "benevo
lent" racism. It praised native
Americans by calling them "a

proud, courageous and brave
people whose heritage runs
deep in the land."
Yet this is the classic,
apologetic Indian stereotype,
and once we think in
stereotypes we lost sight of
what a person is. This kind of
argument is almost always an
apology for a basic act of dis
crimination, the "some of my
best friends are blacks" apol
ogy-
Enough of Chief Lightfoot. It
is a shame that such idiocy
should have demanded this
much of our energy. What
worries me is that native
Americans appear to be dying
from uranium mining wastes
dumped on the reservations.
This is a grave problem,
perhaps just too remote for
some to consider, too much a
"national issue for some of
the ASSU senators, yet talk is
cheap.
Again, I apologize to those
who took my letter literally and
were offended by it. And I cer
tainly hope that no one took
my letter literally and agreed
with it.

A true dictator
One cannot help deriving
anything but amusement from
the contents of Philippe Bour
gois' letter (Daily,Oct 17), in

which he admonishes the Daily
for referring to Fidel Castro as a
dictator.
Surely his senseof definition
embarrasses the mind. The
mere fact that the Cuban
people have not experienced a
free election in the last twenty
years is testament enough to
the autocratic nature of the
Castro regime.
Coupling that fact with the
oppressive disposition of Cas
tro's strong-arm tactics,
documented by Amnesty In
ternational in numerous
studies, only lends credence to
the obvious.
Indeed Bourgois is correct in
stating that much of the Third
World is inspired by the politi
cal stature of Castro, but this
inspiration is difficult to dis
cern. A quick scan of most of
the African portion of the third
world, taking into considera
tion the political temperament
of those governments, will
show a striking resemblance to
the dictatorial ingredients of
Cuba's reigning coterie.
Furthermore, the Third
World's "respect" for Castro
does not imply a lack of autoc
racy on Castro's part, yet Bour
gois seems to make the impli
cation in a manner that defies
logic. Franco and Mussolini
may have been "inspired" by
Hitler during their reigns, but
can one logically conclude that
Hitler was any less of a dictator
because of this?
Bourgois' concept of a non

aligned nation would appear
curious to any serious student
of recent developments in in
ternational relations. Cuba's
"non-aligned" soil presently
houses some 4000 Soviet com
bat troops.
Political dictatorship, rather
than being an injurious insult
to socialism, as Bourgois
suggests, has ultimately be
come socialism's handmaiden
and its only sustaining force.
Socialism itself is an injurious
insult to any person who re
spects individual liberty and
values the sanctity of human
dignity.
The notion that a socialist
dictatorship is a benevolent
and acceptable form of gov
ernment is merely ignoring the
stark evidence that history has
shown us. It is perverse to as
sume that "communism is not
an ogre that sucks the blood of
little children."
From Stalin's purges, to the
stultifying effects of China's
Cultural Revolution, through
the exploits of the Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia and the
Boat People of Vietnam, the
banner of this legacy remains
intact through the influence of
"leaders" like Fidel Castro.

'Chief' offends
In the recent conflict over
the mascot issue, people ob
jecting to the "Indian" have
cited primarily political
reasons about minority issues
in support of their position.
I agree with their reasoning,
but it is clear that the suppor
ters of Chief Lightfoot either
don't understand these
reasons or don't care about
them.
Even if political reasons are
set aside, however, the fact
remains that a portion of the
community is offended by the
use of the name "Indian" and
by Lightfoot's presence on the
field.
Any mature person should
be able to understand that it is
senseless and childish to have
a mascot that offends some
people.
Mascots just are not that im
portant. Besides, there are
plenty of possible mascots that
would not be offensive to any
one.
For instance, someone re
cently suggested to the Daily
that the many bees that have
been plaguing the campus are
trying to tell us that we should
be the Stanford Yellowjackets.
This person, however, does
not have the mind of an insect.
They're actually telling us we
should be the Stanfora Wasps.

ter, "A noble symbol" (Daily,
Oct. 8) calling for the return of
Chief Lightfoot, by proposing
that there be a new name, "The
Stanford Cooley's," for the
mascot.
I used much of the same text
as the previous letter, sub
stituting "Asian Americans"
and "Cooleys" for "native
American" and "Chief Light
foot."
I had hoped that, by applying
its argument to a different
ethnic group with different
stereotypes, the essential ra
cism would be revealed, and
that the inhumanity of making
any group of real, living people
into a pet would become obvi
ous.
The discussion of my letter
makes the same points I was
making. In particular, the his
tory of Asians in this state,
which I had alluded to, and he
detailed, is important for all to
know.
I should add myself, how
ever, that what was so distres
sing about the original "Noble
symbol" letter was its "benevo
lent" racism. It praised native
Americans by calling them "a

proud, courageous and brave
people whose heritage runs
deep in the land."
Yet this is the classic,
apologetic Indian stereotype,
and once we think in
stereotypes we lost sight of
what a person is. This kind of
argument is almost always an
apology for a basic act of dis
crimination, the "some of my
best friends are blacks" apol
ogy-
Enough of Chief Lightfoot. It
is a shame that such idiocy
should have demanded this
much of our energy. What
worries me is that native
Americans appear to be dying
from uranium mining wastes
dumped on the reservations.
This is a grave problem,
perhaps just too remote for
some to consider, too much a
"national issue for some of
the ASSU senators, yet talk is
cheap.
Again, I apologize to those
who took my letter literally and
were offended by it. And I cer
tainly hope that no one took
my letter literally and agreed
with it.

A true dictator
One cannot help deriving
anything but amusement from
the contents of Philippe Bour
gois' letter (Daily,Oct 17), in

which he admonishes the Daily
for referring to Fidel Castro as a
dictator.
Surely his senseof definition
embarrasses the mind. The
mere fact that the Cuban
people have not experienced a
free election in the last twenty
years is testament enough to
the autocratic nature of the
Castro regime.
Coupling that fact with the
oppressive disposition of Cas
tro's strong-arm tactics,
documented by Amnesty In
ternational in numerous
studies, only lends credence to
the obvious.
Indeed Bourgois is correct in
stating that much of the Third
World is inspired by the politi
cal stature of Castro, but this
inspiration is difficult to dis
cern. A quick scan of most of
the African portion of the third
world, taking into considera
tion the political temperament
of those governments, will
show a striking resemblance to
the dictatorial ingredients of
Cuba's reigning coterie.
Furthermore, the Third
World's "respect" for Castro
does not imply a lack of autoc
racy on Castro's part, yet Bour
gois seems to make the impli
cation in a manner that defies
logic. Franco and Mussolini
may have been "inspired" by
Hitler during their reigns, but
can one logically conclude that
Hitler was any less of a dictator
because of this?
Bourgois' concept of a non

aligned nation would appear
curious to any serious student
of recent developments in in
ternational relations. Cuba's
"non-aligned" soil presently
houses some 4000 Soviet com
bat troops.
Political dictatorship, rather
than being an injurious insult
to socialism, as Bourgois
suggests, has ultimately be
come socialism's handmaiden
and its only sustaining force.
Socialism itself is an injurious
insult to any person who re
spects individual liberty and
values the sanctity of human
dignity.
The notion that a socialist
dictatorship is a benevolent
and acceptable form of gov
ernment is merely ignoring the
stark evidence that history has
shown us. It is perverse to as
sume that "communism is not
an ogre that sucks the blood of
little children."
From Stalin's purges, to the
stultifying effects of China's
Cultural Revolution, through
the exploits of the Khmer
Rouge in Cambodia and the
Boat People of Vietnam, the
banner of this legacy remains
intact through the influence of
"leaders" like Fidel Castro.

'Chief' offends
In the recent conflict over
the mascot issue, people ob
jecting to the "Indian" have
cited primarily political
reasons about minority issues
in support of their position.
I agree with their reasoning,
but it is clear that the suppor
ters of Chief Lightfoot either
don't understand these
reasons or don't care about
them.
Even if political reasons are
set aside, however, the fact
remains that a portion of the
community is offended by the
use of the name "Indian" and
by Lightfoot's presence on the
field.
Any mature person should
be able to understand that it is
senseless and childish to have
a mascot that offends some
people.
Mascots just are not that im
portant. Besides, there are
plenty of possible mascots that
would not be offensive to any
one.
For instance, someone re
cently suggested to the Daily
that the many bees that have
been plaguing the campus are
trying to tell us that we should
be the Stanford Yellowjackets.
This person, however, does
not have the mind of an insect.
They're actually telling us we
should be the Stanfora Wasps.
