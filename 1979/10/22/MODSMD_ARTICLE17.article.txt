## Subtle sexism is the real 'crime' 
### 
A recent advertising campaign has plas
tered the campus with posters of two
blond, scantily-clad women sporting rol
ler skates and bottles of Dos Equis beer.
The message inked across many of these
posters ("a crime against women") is indi
cative of the feelings of anger these post
ers have aroused.
They have aroused for me some ques
tions: What was this "crime" and who are
the criminals?
Certainly the thrust of the advertising
was not the advancement of crimes
against women, but the selling of more
beer. The poster, assuming the advertis
ing agency hired knew its business, was
the end product of a lot of hard work con
cerning what would sell their beer the
best.
And since blond Americans on roller
skates have nothing to do with a Mexican
beer, it is safe to assume that the women
are used to sell the beer.
Perhaps this is one aspect of the
"crime": the insensitive use of women as

mere objects to sell other objects. But
there is a deeper question raised: Why is
this method so effective?
Anything used to sell as above must
have a basis in attractiveness or acceptabil
ity. We reject a bum's recommendation to
drink fizz beer because he is not someone
we find attractive or acceptable.
We want more than a beer when we
respond to Dos Equis: we find the women
on the poster attractive, sexy or fashiona
ble. We want them or want to be like
them: the beer is a compromise.
But I say (and this is the real point) that
this kind of "attractiveness" is only so by
definition, and the definition is not ours
but that of the advertising agency.
The ad companies are experts at selling
their products by getting people to buy
their definitions — of "fun," "sexy,"
"good beer" anything — and in the unwit
ting acceptance of these manipulative
standards we become partners to the
crime — whether we buy the product or
not.

It is our reluctance or inability to come
to conclusions about who we are or who
we want to be, and thus form our own
standards accordingly, that leaves us open
to the abundance of exploitive ones.
Look around you. Are the standards set
by TV or the movies any less criminal? And
pick up any one of the innumerable "fash
ion" magazines, ironically directed at
women, to see how closely our ideas of
beauty parallel what is being sold.
Yet these we accept.
I don't worry about the blatant "sexism"
of ads like the Dos Equis poster: they are
easy to spot. More importantly they
wouldn't be there at the iceberg's tip if
there weren't so much under the surface
to support them.
Examine the more subtle crimes against
women (and men, for our interaction is a
dialectic) and we will find, to use Poco's
immortal words: "We have met theenemy
and he is us."
