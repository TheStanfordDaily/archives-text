## Peace must include Palestinians 
### 
Having read her column, I
find it compelling to answer
the distorted views expressed
by Debra Leigh (Daily, Oct. 12)
for the sake of humanity and
academic honesty.
1) The Arab opposition to the
bilateral treaty between Egypt
and Israel does not originate,
as Leigh claims, in a lack of
desire for peace, but because
this peace should not and can
not be established on the mis
ery of the Palestinian people.
Leigh certainly is not una
ware of the Palestinians' na
tional aspiration for a home
land, a social and political force
deeply entrenched in every
human being, and ironically
once used by European
Zionists to justify the estab
lishment of their state. Now it
is hypocritical to deny a people
the very same thing you claim
to be your "Cod given" right
solely because the Palestinians

did not seize (he opportunity
12 years ago.
2)The second reason for
Arab opposition to the so
called 'peace' treaty is a fact
Leigh deliberately hides away,
namely that Israel as it has
stood since its inception as a
dream is a racist state. Depend
ing on who one talks to, Israel
is based either on religious af
filiation, on race, or on both.
None of these form legiti
mate grounds for a state to the
practical exclusion of other
races or religions.
The opposition to such sys
tems is thus similar to that
against Rhodesia and South Af
rica. The legitimacy of opposi
tion to Apartheid cannot — I
hope — becontested by Leigh.
3) The third and last point is
the expansionist nature of Is
rael. The newly created state
would not have survived in its

original 1947 borders (U.N. de
signated), not because of the
"war of extermination" waged
by the Arabs, but because of the
need to absorb thousands of
immigrants pouring in every
year. The limitation of its size
to 1947 borders would sooner
or later have come in sharp
contradiction with its ideal of
being "a haven" all Jews of the
world can come to.
The conceptualization pre
sented above has led to very
itragic consequences both for
the Palestinians and the Jews
alike. The bloodshed and mis
ery speak for themselves. The
Palestinians and the PLO as
their representative have always
demanded and will continue to
demand what is rightfully
theirs and what the world
community came to recognize:
the right to return to their
homeland and the right to es
tablish a state in it.
The PLO Charter, which
Leigh quotes out of context,
clearly proposes as the only
just andhuman solution the
establishment of a secular state
for all — a state where people
can live harmoniously regard
less of race or religious affilia

tion, and on equal footing. The
evolution of such state—if and
when it happens — implies the
dismantling or alteration of the
present political superstruc
ture in Israel.
However, in view of the ex
treme difficulty of realization
of this objective, the PLO has
been flexible enough to prop
ose an alternative that is via
ble and just; a Palestinian state
on part of Palestine where the
national aspiration of their dis
possessed people can be par
tially fulfilled.
This evolution in the Palesti
nian thinking can not be un
known to Leigh. Her choice to
neglect it is a deliberate distor
tion of reality. ,
The PLO has in effect
amended the original charter
cited above even though the
original text is still unchanged.
If we are to go by historic
documents, then allow me to
remind you that the Zionist
conference of 1897 proclaimed
the premise of "The greater Is
rael, from the Nile to the Eup
hrates" and that premise has
not been changed until now.
