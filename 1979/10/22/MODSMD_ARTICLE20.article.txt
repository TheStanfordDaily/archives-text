# Defense never rests in 30-10 triumph

### Chris Haft 
Tucson — You can talk about Stan
ford's high point production, or you
can rave over Turk Schonert's brilliant
passing and leadership.
• What made the difference Saturday
bight in Stanford's 30-10 football con
quest of Arizona, however, was the
Cardinal defense.
Acting as a dike against Arizona's
Swift flood of running backs, the Card
defense held Arizona to 246 total yards
and set up Stanford's last two
'touchdowns with a fumble recovery
and an interception.
Stanford head coach Rod Dowhower
«Vas fully aware of how valuable his de
fense was. After the game, Dowhower
diverted the offensive-oriented ques
tions of reporters to the subject of the
Card defenders.
" "But let's talk about the defense. God
damn, they're the ones that did it,"
Dowhower said with emphasis. "They
just took the ballgame away from
Arizona tonight."
j, By taking the game away from
Arizona, Stanford lifted its Pacific-10
Conference mark to 2-0-1, good for a
fjr,st-place tie with USC.
yThough the 4-2-1 Cards have four
games left, there's no reason for them
Ijpt to think of winning the conference
championship for a berth in the Rose
Bowl.
, "Hell yes, I'm gonna say I'm thinking
about the Rose Bowl," said a jubilant
Schonert, who completed 17 of 20 pas
ses for 194 yards and three
!uchdowns. "We're right in the mid
e of it (the league race)."
In control
The Cards were right in the middle of
— in terms of the score, at least —
jring the first half, as they were tied

7-7 at halftime.
Yet Stanford established control on
its second possession of the game.
Moving up the field on the determined
running of Mike Dotterer, Greg
Hooper and Vincent White, the Cards
drove 69 yards in 14 plays for their first
touchdown, a three-yard pass from
Schonert to Hooper.
It was the first collegiate touchdown
for Hooper, who gained 62 yards on 16
carries while playing most of the game
at fullback.
"He's a strong, determined runner,"
said Dowhower of Hooper. "He gives
us some depth at fullback because Jim
Brown has been hurting."
Arizona head coach Tony Mason was
grudging in his praise of Stanford's
ground attack. "The three freshmen
runningbacks (Dotterer, Hooper and
White) are good," Mason said, "but
you've got to understand the threat of
Stanford's passing makes their run
ningbacks a lot better."
Krohn inaccurate
Too bad that the threat of the
Wildcats' running doesn't make their
passing a lot better. Arizona quarter
back Jim Krohn completed just seven of
17 throwsfor7l yards and two intercep
tions.
However, with Card quarterback
John Elway suffering from a rare bout of
ineffectiveness, Arizona soon reached
the scoreboard.
Safety Reggie Ware intercepted an
Elway pass at the Stanford 48-yard line
and returned it to the 32, where he was
roughed by Andre Tyler to put the ball
on Stanford's 17.
Four plays later the Wildcats cashed
in on thegolden opportunity presented
them, as tailback Richard Hersey ran for
the tying touchdown from five yards

out.
Arizona rode its fleeting crest of
momentum into the second half. After
taking the kickoff, the Wildcats clawed
to Stanford's 9-yard line, mainly on the
strength of Hubert Oliver's 36-yard run
up the middle.
Staunch defense
But, to borrow one of John F. Ken
nedy's 1960 presidential campaign slo
gans, Saturday night was a "Time for
Greatness" for Stanford's defense.
The Cards used every bit of this
greatness to keep the Wildcats out of
the end zone. On first-and-goal
sophomore tackle Steve Ballinger sac
ked Krohn for a three-yard loss to the
12.
Linebackers Dave Morze and Craig
Zellmer teamed up to trap Oliver at the
10, and then tackle Chuck Evans
reached high into the breezy sky to bat
down a Krohn pass.
"We weren't making mistakes, basi
cally," linebacker Terry Rennaker said,
explaining Stanford's defensive excel
lence. "Up to this point we've been
beating ourselves — today, we cut way
back on the mistakes, and it showed
... it was very, very satisfying."
Zivic's 27-yard field goal gave Arizona
a 10-7 lead that lasted all of six minutes
and 38 seconds, which is how long
Stanford took to score the eventual
winning touchdown.
Steady offense
Following the kickoff, Schonert di
rected an 80-yard, 15-play march and
capped it with a 15-yard touchdown
pass to Tyler. Ken Naber's conversion
gave the Cards a 14-10 lead.
The (Sards made another big defen
sive play on Arizona's ensuing posses
sion. On third-and-one at the Wildcat
29, Zellmer nabbed l arry Heater for a

one-yard loss, forcing Arizona to punt.
Then came the fourth quarter, and
another Dotterer surprise.
Dotterer, who turned his own fumble
into an important first down in last
week's 21-21 tie with USC, took a hand
off from Schonert with 13:53 to play and
the ball on Arizona's 49.
Several Wildcats met Dotterer behind
the line of scrimmage and chased him
back nearly to Stanford's 30-yard line.
Finding a free split-second, Dotterer
suddenly lofted a crippled-looking pass
that was almost intercepted.
Afterwards Dotterer explained that
he saw tight end Pat Bowe downfield
and that the play was totally uninten
tional — "It was an improvisation," he
said, grinning impishly.
Nothing was improvisational about
the next play, though. Schonert, whose
85 percent completion rate came just
2.2 short of Dick Norman's single-game
mark of 87.2 (set in the 1959 Big Came
with a 34-for-39 performance), threw
deep to a streaking Tyler down the
sideline.
Tyler made an amazing catch, leaping
over a Wildcat defender while running
at full speed. The 37-yard play brought
Stanford to Arizona's 12-yard line and
set up Ken Naber's 30-yard field goal.
Seconds later the defense continued
its heroics. Linebacker Milt McColl
forced Oliver to fumble on a sweep,
and Evans recovered the ball on the
Wildcat 29.
From there the Cards took only five
plays to score, the fifth being a seven
yard pass from Schonert to Dotterer,
who outran Ware to the goal line.
Morze's interception and 12-yard re
turn with just over eight minutes left
enabled Elway to toss al3-yarder to Ken
Margerum for Stanford's final score.
