### Brad Brockbank 
A balanced storing attack and a little
amina helped the Stanford water polo
am return home yesterday after wiri
ng three games in three days against
>ng Beach State, UC-lrvine and
izona.
The busy travel schedule didn't hin
;r the Cardinals as they drowned the
lers Thursday night, 11-4, outlasted
e Anteaters 10-6 on Friday and flew off
tame the Wildcats 10-7 Saturday
orning. The victories boost the No. 1-
nked Cards to a 17-2-1 record overall,
1 in Pacific-10 play.

With junior Vince Vanelli starting in
the goal and anchoring a strong defen
sive effort, the Cards pummeled Long
Beach. The 49ers managed only one
goal in each of the four quarters, while
Stanford scored three tallies in all but
the fourth period.
According to Card coach Dante De
ttamanti, the team's objective was to
shut the Long Beach scorers off from
outside, from where they have accumu
lated a number of goals in recent
games. The strategy worked, as the49er
offense was "almost non-existent," De
ttamanti said.
Sophomores Alan Mourhawar and

Jody Campbell split the duties of scor
ing six of the 11 Card goals, and
freshman Jamie Bergeson added two.
Irvine fared slightly better against the
Stanford attack, but still found itself
behind 4-1 early in the second quarter.
Small offensive errors and subsequent
turnovers by the Cards, however, al
lowed the Anteaters to capitalize and
fight back to within one, 4-3, by
halftime.
But the defending national champ
ions came back in the second half, out
scoring Irvine 6-3. The tenacious An
teaters stayed in the game until the

closing moments of the final period,
lagging only two goals behind the
Cards, 7-5, with 4:28 left in the game.
"We had trouble putting them
away," Dettamanti said of Irvine.
"When we had the chance (in the sec
ond quarter), we let them back in the
game."
Dettamanti expressed the same frust
ration in speaking of the game against
Arizona Saturday. The Cards jumped
out to a 6-2 halftime lead, which grew to
7-i by the end of the third period. In the
fourth quarter, however, Arizona out
scored the Cards 4-3, making De
ttamanti a little uneasy.
