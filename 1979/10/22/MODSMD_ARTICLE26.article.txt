# White's goal ties Cal, 2-2
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
In one of the most exciting games this season,
the Stanford and California field hockey teams
played to a 2-2 tie Saturday at Roble Field.
It was a fast-paced match played primarily
from midfield — a spectator's dream for any
sport, but especially hockey. Close-matched
statistics of 15 shots for Stanford to Cal's 12, and
12 corners for Stanford to Cal's eight reflect how
even a game it was.
First-half play brought the game to a 1-1 stale
mate. Stanford's goal was scored on a beautiful
combination play by link Nancy White and left
wing Kelly Westerwick.
Scotcher forwards Nancy Geenan and Becky
Howell demonstrated particular expertise in the
first half, consistently making themselves avail

able for both offensive and defensive assis
tance.
Tension and techniques reached their apexes
in the second half, when Cal scored with seven
minutes left in the game.
"You do wonder if you can really come back in
seven minutes," said Stanford back Julia
Johnson about that moment, "but I think Ber
keley's scoring made us more determined at the
end. My personal feeling was I wasn't going to
let it end 2-1 no matter what."
And, indeed, with three minutes left, White
put one in off a corner shot. "It was a very
effective change in pace and tactics," com
mented coach Barbara Longstreth. "She put the
ball on her stick and maneuvered it past the
goalie."
