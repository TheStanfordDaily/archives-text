The women's cross country team's second-place performance
at the U.S. Track and Field Association Invitational Saturday was
"an excellent experience," Stanford head coach Laurel Treon
said.
Nine teams — 64 runners — competed in the meet at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo's 5000-meter course.
Stanford and the Aggie Running Club provided the only rep
resentation from Northern California; the remaining seven con
tenders ventured from the southern part of the state.
"It was a chance to run against new faces," commented Treon,
who also noted that the course was the hilliest and most challeng
ing the team had run to date.
In what must seem like old hat, Maggie Keyes set a new record
on her home course with a time of 17:30.0. It was the fourth time
in as many meets for the Cal Poly-SLO runner, who led her team
to a first-place finish with 23 points.
Kim Schnurpfeil, Ann Thrupp and Ann Wotherspoon led the
Cardinal contingent again this week finishing second, fifth and
tenth, respectively.
Schnurpfeil ran under the old course record for a mark of
17:54.1, also for the fourth time this season. Treon said of the
freshman runner, "She's continuing to become adjusted to col
legiate competition and is gaining confidence in her own ability."
Thrupp crossed the line at 18:35.7 while Wotherspoon was
clocked at 19:07.2.
