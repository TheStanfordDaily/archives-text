# Weak midfield costs Cardinals
## 
### Dean Eyre 
When the Stanford soccer team took the field Saturday, the
midfield was left on the sidelines and it cost the Cardinals coming
and going — Fresno State broke through for three goals while
Stanford was shut out. ,
The first blanking of the season drops the Cards' record to 9-3-1
overall and 2-1 in conference. Not only did the Bulldog team
backs hold Stanford scoreless, but they also stifled leading Cafd
scorer Willie Guicci, ending his nine-game scoring skein. ,
For Fresno, the win brings its overall mark to 7-2-1 and raises
the conference total to 4-1. The only losses have been to UQ-
Santa Barbara, 4-2, and to San Jose State, 2-1, in overtime.
The Bulldogs scored first on a shot by Denis Odorico, assisted
by Rosendo Cuttierez 40 minutes into the match. Tony Browns,
assisted by Keith Thomas, added another Fresno tally almost
halfway through the second period. Thomas then logged a goal of
his own, assisted by Kirk Nelson with 30 seconds remaining. ;
In most modern soccer strategies, the midfield serves as a vital
link between the strikers up front and the backs and sweeper
Losing that continuity against Fresno shut down the Stanford
passing, and without effective passing it's near-impossible tp
open up the opponent'" defense for a shot on goal.
Weakened offense and loss of the first wave of defense are not
the only results of the midfield problem — it also affects th 6
mental attitude of the whole team. • >
"(This) technical problem is initial," Lodge said. "The morale
(problem) comes about from poor technique — the midfield
defensing."
After rolling upa 9-1-1 record, the Stanford soccer machine is in
a brief stall, unfortunately late in the season with key games
upcoming. Before meeting powerhouses like Westmont, Sanfe
Barbara, UCLA, Santa Clara and USF, the Cards travel to St. Mary's
today. As a therapeutic measure, Lodge intends to "play more of
the bench to fire up the first team." "
