# OPEN STATEMENT TO THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY
## 
### TDS, INC. (OPERATOR OF THE COFFEE HOUSE) 
Q: Who (what) is TDS, Inc?
A: TDS, Inc. is a privately-owned food service management com
pany which successfully bid the current contract with the University
4-1/2 years ago.
Q: What is TDS philosophy about employing students?
A: TDS has been the largest private employer of students on the
campus for nearly seven years; many students have received and
mastered management positions with TDS.
Q: Whom does The Coffee House dispute concern?
A: The former workers and the management of TDS.
Q: Who is the NLRB and why is it involved?
A: The NLRB abbreviates the Notional Labor Relations Board and is
the administrative agency charged with enforcement of the provi
sions of the National Labor Relations Act. It is involved because
some of the former Coffee House employees invoked its jurisdic
tion, and not because TDS sought its intervention.
Q: Is it true that the NLRB has issued a "complaint"? What is a "com
plaint"?
A: A 'complaint" is merely the administrative mechanism which al
lows the NLRB to plan and conduct a formal hearing before an
Administrative Law Judge to ascertain whether or not TDS (the
employer) engaged in an unfair labor practice in connection with
the terminations of 37 Coffee House workers. It is not a finding that
TDS violated the low, it merely invokes the hearing process.
Q: How many workers were terminated? How many of these were
students?
A: Thirty-Seven (37) employees were terminated; nineteen (19)
were students.
Q: Why did TDS close the Coffee House?
A: TDS has a contractual obligation to meet the complete cash food
service needs of the entire student population. Discussions con
ducted by the TMU Food Sevice Advisory Committee (most mem
bers are students) revealed that The Coffee House was not giving
customers all it should have and was serving only a relatively small
segment of the University Community.
Q: Were all employees invited to apply for (new and substantially
equivalent) jobs when The Coffee House re-opened?
A: Yes, all except the two managers.
Q: How many of these eligible workers applied for positions?
A: Twenty-five (25).
Q: How many of these were offered jobs before The Coffee
House re-opened on July 31st?
A: Ten (10).
Q: How many of these ten individuals, who were offered jobs, actu
ally accepted them?
A: Three (3).
Q: In total how many of the former employees have been offered
jobs at The Coffee House?

TDS, INC

A: Twenty-One of the original Twenty-Five who expressed interest in
working hove been offered jobs.
Q: Were The Coffee House employees terminated because of Union
activities?
A: No, they were terminated because of not being able to run The
Coffee House up to operational and hygienic standards. There was
no union activity at The Coffee House as far as we know.
Q: When did the question of union activity arise?
A: Only after the employees had already been terminated and they
received legal advice that the only legal remedy they would hove
is if they claimed they had been terminated for union activity.
Q: . Is it true that many former workers were working as few as 2-3
hours/week?
A: Yes.
Q: Is it true that of the six (6) full-time former workers, only one (1)
was a Stanford student?
A: Yes.
Q: Is it true that TDS management has "refused to talk directly" with
the former workers?
A: The action by the former workers to invoke the NLRB, began a
legal process in which it is impossible to address the issues they
have raised outside of the confines of the NLRB.
Q: How much money, in the form of rent, has TDS, Inc. paid Stanford
during the current contract (April 1975 â€” to date)?
A: $414,107.94 (Four Hundred Fourteen Thousand One Hundred
Seven Dollars and 94/100 cents.)

July, August, and September of 1979?

Q: Were Stanford's self-operated food services in the red before
TDS took over in 1973?
A: Yes, the loss in the year before TDS took, over was in excess of
$150,000.00, which monies ultimately had to be mode up from
University general revenues.
Q: Does TDS want to settle this dispute?
A: Yes; TDS has instructed its attorneys to do everything possible to
effect a settlement quickly and fairly.
Q: Is it true that the presence of the "True Coffee House" stand for 8
weeks constituted a violation of the contract between TDS and the
University?
A: Yes, but TDS wishes to put this whole issue to rest, and currently has
no active plans to persue legal remedies against the University.

accepted positions.
