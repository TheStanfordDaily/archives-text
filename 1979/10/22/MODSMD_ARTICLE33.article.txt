Bishop dies in Nev. gas chamber
Carson City, Nev. — Spurning appeals for his life,
convicted killer Jesse Bishop died early today in
the Nevada gas chamber, the second man to be
executed in the United States this year.
State Prison Director Charles Wolff, who gave
the order to strap Bishop in the two-seat gas
chamber that had not been used since 1961, de
scribed the inmate as "tough" and "self
controlled."
Last-minute appeals to two U.S. Supreme Court
justices yesterday were rebuffed. Like Gary Gil
more, who was shot by a Utah firing squad in
January 1977, Bishop had repeatedly spurned ef
forts by those who wanted to stop his execution.
It marked the third execution in the United
States in a dozen years. The last person to be
executed was John Spenkelink, a convicted mur
derer who was electrocuted in Florida on May 25.
Spenkelink had fought his execution.
The prison chief had offered Bishop a chance to
appeal even up to the point at which Bishop, clad
in blue denim pants, a white shirt and white socks,
was strapped in the chair.
Bishop killed a Baltimore newlywed during a Las
Vegas casino robbery in 1977.
Bishop was able to look out at the 12 persons
allowed by prison officials to witness the execu
tion, Nevada's first in 18 years. Nevada pioneered
use of lethal gas in 1924, and 31 men have been put
to death in that manner in the state.
Sniper slays two in parking lot
Oklahoma City — A sniper killed a man and a
woman in a deliberate attack in the parking lot of a
shopping center here yesterday afternoon then
fled in an auto, police said.
Sgt. Tom Mundy said the two victims had left a
grocery store with their three children shortly be
fore 5 p.m. and were walking toward their auto
when someone opened fire with a high-powered
rifle.
Police identified the dead as Jesse Eugene
Taylor, 42, and Marion Vera Bresette, 31, both of
Oklahoma City.
Mundy said investigators believe the sniper
fired at least five shots from his hiding place in
some cedar trees on the north side of the Ok
lahoma State Fairgrounds across the street from
the shopping center.
The man and woman were reported dead at the

scene. Investigators believe each were hit once.
The children were uninjured. There were no
other injuries reported, but several unoccupied
cars were damaged by the gunfire.
Police said they have recovered three projectiles
from the shopping center parking lot and shell
casings from a group of cedar trees on the fair
grounds.
"It appears as though these were his intended
victims. He obviously was well-versed in the use of
a high-powered rifle because of the distance,"
Mundy said.
Cable car crashes at Texas fair
Dallas — Two cable cars plunged about 100 feet
from a midway ride yesterday at the crowded State
Fair of Texas, and fire department officials said 13
persons were injured, one seriously.
Scores of passengers were stranded when the
ride automatically shut down after the accident.
They were rescued without incident.
No official cause was reported for the mishap
involving the "Swiss Skyride," made by Von Roll
Co. of Bern, Switzerland.
Authorities said the two cars fell just feet apart,
with one of them crashing through a midway con
cession game stand. The other snagged on the
canvas awning of a nearby stand.
Witnesses said the cars missed the jammed
walkway between rows of concession stands by
only a few feet.
It was not known how many of the injured were
on the ground when the accident occurred.
Fire department officials said 12 persons were
taken to Parkland Hospital and another was taken
to nearby Baylor Hospital.
Firefighter Larry Lewis suffered a broken leg
when a fire truck ran over him as he attempted to
leap aboard while it was moving. He was not in
cluded in the injury figure of 13.
Bus wreck leaves three dead
Cherokee, N.C. — Three people were killed and
more than 50 were injured last night when a tour
bus hit a guard rail, struck three cars and careened
off a highway on the Cherokee Indian Reservation,
authorities said.
A Highway Patrol dispatcher in Waynesville said
three deaths were confirmed shortly after 9 p.m.
The victims were traveling by car, but it was not
immediately clear whether they were together or

in separate vehicles, he added.
All 52 persons aboard the bus were reported
injured.
Welch Tramper, a Cherokee farmer, said the
bus was "laying up against a big oak tree down
below the road."
Tramper said the bus traveled about 35 feet
down a high bank below two-lane U.S. 19, about
six miles from Cherokee in western North
Carolina, and another 15 feet before it stopped.
He said it appeared the bus "came around a
deep curve," struck three cars, then went off the
road. Two of the cars were demolished, he said.
Dwight Eisenhower tapes missing
Abilene, Kan. — A fragmented collection of
typewritten transcripts shows that the late Presi
dent Dwight Eisenhower taped conversations in
the Oval Office, an Eisenhower Library archivist
said yesterday.
However, the archivist, Jim Leyerzapf, said, "As
far as we know, the tapes don't exist.
"We have no knowledge of what happened to
them. Whethei they were left behind or destroyed
is a matter of speculation," he said.
The Houston Chronicle, in a copyright story
Saturday, reported that Eisenhower secretly taped
conversations that took place in the Oval Office.
In one, Eisenhower criticized his vice-president,
Richard Nixon, for Nixon's outspoken criticism of
the Democratic leadership's handling of foreign
policy.
The Chronicle said the recordings began with
meetings in October 1953 and continued at least
until December 1958.
Leyerzapf said the library's staff had discovered
the transcripts in early 1976 while processing pap
ers of the president's personal secretary, Ann
Whitman. He said the 6000-page file — called "The
Ann Whitman Diary" — was opened for general
research work in January 1977.
Weather today
Increasing clouds with rain and gusty winds
likely today. Chance of showers this evening.
Clearing tonight then fair tomorrow with patchy
morning fog or low clouds. Lows in the 50s. Highs
in the 60s. Southeast winds increasing to 20 to 35
mph late to northwesterly today. Chance of rain 80

Bishop dies in Nev. gas chamber
Carson City, Nev. — Spurning appeals for his life,
convicted killer Jesse Bishop died early today in
the Nevada gas chamber, the second man to be
executed in the United States this year.
State Prison Director Charles Wolff, who gave
the order to strap Bishop in the two-seat gas
chamber that had not been used since 1961, de
scribed the inmate as "tough" and "self
controlled."
Last-minute appeals to two U.S. Supreme Court
justices yesterday were rebuffed. Like Gary Gil
more, who was shot by a Utah firing squad in
January 1977, Bishop had repeatedly spurned ef
forts by those who wanted to stop his execution.
It marked the third execution in the United
States in a dozen years. The last person to be
executed was John Spenkelink, a convicted mur
derer who was electrocuted in Florida on May 25.
Spenkelink had fought his execution.
The prison chief had offered Bishop a chance to
appeal even up to the point at which Bishop, clad
in blue denim pants, a white shirt and white socks,
was strapped in the chair.
Bishop killed a Baltimore newlywed during a Las
Vegas casino robbery in 1977.
Bishop was able to look out at the 12 persons
allowed by prison officials to witness the execu
tion, Nevada's first in 18 years. Nevada pioneered
use of lethal gas in 1924, and 31 men have been put
to death in that manner in the state.
Sniper slays two in parking lot
Oklahoma City — A sniper killed a man and a
woman in a deliberate attack in the parking lot of a
shopping center here yesterday afternoon then
fled in an auto, police said.
Sgt. Tom Mundy said the two victims had left a
grocery store with their three children shortly be
fore 5 p.m. and were walking toward their auto
when someone opened fire with a high-powered
rifle.
Police identified the dead as Jesse Eugene
Taylor, 42, and Marion Vera Bresette, 31, both of
Oklahoma City.
Mundy said investigators believe the sniper
fired at least five shots from his hiding place in
some cedar trees on the north side of the Ok
lahoma State Fairgrounds across the street from
the shopping center.
The man and woman were reported dead at the

scene. Investigators believe each were hit once.
The children were uninjured. There were no
other injuries reported, but several unoccupied
cars were damaged by the gunfire.
Police said they have recovered three projectiles
from the shopping center parking lot and shell
casings from a group of cedar trees on the fair
grounds.
"It appears as though these were his intended
victims. He obviously was well-versed in the use of
a high-powered rifle because of the distance,"
Mundy said.
Cable car crashes at Texas fair
Dallas — Two cable cars plunged about 100 feet
from a midway ride yesterday at the crowded State
Fair of Texas, and fire department officials said 13
persons were injured, one seriously.
Scores of passengers were stranded when the
ride automatically shut down after the accident.
They were rescued without incident.
No official cause was reported for the mishap
involving the "Swiss Skyride," made by Von Roll
Co. of Bern, Switzerland.
Authorities said the two cars fell just feet apart,
with one of them crashing through a midway con
cession game stand. The other snagged on the
canvas awning of a nearby stand.
Witnesses said the cars missed the jammed
walkway between rows of concession stands by
only a few feet.
It was not known how many of the injured were
on the ground when the accident occurred.
Fire department officials said 12 persons were
taken to Parkland Hospital and another was taken
to nearby Baylor Hospital.
Firefighter Larry Lewis suffered a broken leg
when a fire truck ran over him as he attempted to
leap aboard while it was moving. He was not in
cluded in the injury figure of 13.
Bus wreck leaves three dead
Cherokee, N.C. — Three people were killed and
more than 50 were injured last night when a tour
bus hit a guard rail, struck three cars and careened
off a highway on the Cherokee Indian Reservation,
authorities said.
A Highway Patrol dispatcher in Waynesville said
three deaths were confirmed shortly after 9 p.m.
The victims were traveling by car, but it was not
immediately clear whether they were together or

in separate vehicles, he added.
All 52 persons aboard the bus were reported
injured.
Welch Tramper, a Cherokee farmer, said the
bus was "laying up against a big oak tree down
below the road."
Tramper said the bus traveled about 35 feet
down a high bank below two-lane U.S. 19, about
six miles from Cherokee in western North
Carolina, and another 15 feet before it stopped.
He said it appeared the bus "came around a
deep curve," struck three cars, then went off the
road. Two of the cars were demolished, he said.
Dwight Eisenhower tapes missing
Abilene, Kan. — A fragmented collection of
typewritten transcripts shows that the late Presi
dent Dwight Eisenhower taped conversations in
the Oval Office, an Eisenhower Library archivist
said yesterday.
However, the archivist, Jim Leyerzapf, said, "As
far as we know, the tapes don't exist.
"We have no knowledge of what happened to
them. Whethei they were left behind or destroyed
is a matter of speculation," he said.
The Houston Chronicle, in a copyright story
Saturday, reported that Eisenhower secretly taped
conversations that took place in the Oval Office.
In one, Eisenhower criticized his vice-president,
Richard Nixon, for Nixon's outspoken criticism of
the Democratic leadership's handling of foreign
policy.
The Chronicle said the recordings began with
meetings in October 1953 and continued at least
until December 1958.
Leyerzapf said the library's staff had discovered
the transcripts in early 1976 while processing pap
ers of the president's personal secretary, Ann
Whitman. He said the 6000-page file — called "The
Ann Whitman Diary" — was opened for general
research work in January 1977.
