"The University is studying a vari
ety of financial mechanisms to make
housing more accessible" to poten
tial faculty and staff, said University
President Richard Lyman on KZSU's
first Campus Conference of the year
Thursday night.
The current housing shortage has
created difficulty in attracting top fa
culty members to teach here.
Fielding queries regardingthe Palo
Alto City Council's recent approval
of plans to build 140 additional fa
culty and staff housing units on Peter
Coutts Hill, Lyman said that proposal
represented "only one step toward
solving the problem. The University
is considering such possibilities as
becoming a co-investor, that is, shar
ing the cost of the purchase of the
house and obviously sharing the sale
price of the house when it gets sold
again," he elaborated.

Lyman expressed "disappoint
ment" at the Palo Alto City Council's
rejection of the University recom
mendation to extend Willow Road to
El Camino Real. Such construction
would have allowed the University to
continue plans for the erection of
1200 to 1600 units of housing on Wil
low Road.
Last week's student body vote in
which the Trees narrowly edged the
Griffons by 10 votes did net show "a
consensus or anything resembling a
consensus," Lyman claimed.
Moreover, the Cardinal — the color
not the bird —will remain as the Uni
versity mascot, he affirmed. The
"Bring Back Chief Lightfoot" move
ment will have no bearing on any de
cision to change mascots because
"The Indian mascot is not returning
to Stanford. Period," he em
phasized.
