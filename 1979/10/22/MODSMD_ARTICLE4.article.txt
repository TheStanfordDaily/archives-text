# Must justify occupancy by Thursday
## Live-in staffers at Bridge may be evicted 
### Tom Campbell 
Live-in staffers at The Bridge may
have to move out unless they can
justify their use of University space to
Director of Student Activities
Thomas Massey at a meeting Thurs
day.
The Bridge is a student-run peer
counseling and information service
at 640 Campus Drive. Four volunteer
staffers live there.
Claiming a need to use the four
room live-in quarters at The Bridge
as office space and meeting rooms
for other student groups, the Uni
versity asked The Bridge to incorpo
rate other peer counseling organiza
tions into its building. If no groups
are found, the University itself will
find other occupants for the quar
ters, Massey said.
But resident Bridge staffer Craig
Goldman said "it's questionable that
we could offer 24-hour service with
out having live-in staffers. It's doubt
ful that people would be willing to
put in that much time."
'Imported nucleus'
Bridge live-in staffers provide es

sential support for such Bridge ser
vices as classes and workshops, and
are "an important nucleus for the
Bridge community," Goldman said.
Massey, however, disagreed with
that argument. Of all campus peer
counseling services, only The Bridge
has live-ins.
"Other programs do well without
them," he said.
Space for others
The Bridge live-in space would be
better utilized as office space for
other campus peer-counseling
groups, Massey claimed. He said he
envisions a "revitalization" of The
Bridge, making it a coordinator for
such groups.
According to Massey, many of the
more than 200 student organizations
have told the Student Activities Of
fice of their need for office and activ
ity space.
Last spring the University asked
The Bridge to come up with ways in
which its live-in space could be used
for housing other counseling ser
vices in addition to The Bridge. The
deadline was set for this quarter. Last

week, Bridge staffers received a let
ter from Massey asking what solu
tions The Bridge had come up with,
pursuant to the spring meeting.
A live-in each
Goldman has suggested that there
be one live-in from each of the sev
eral groups using The Bridge. That
way space for interested groups
would be made available while the
supportive benefits of resident staf
fers are maintained, he said.
Massey denied there is a need for
live-ins: "The live-in precedent is not
worth setting. A nucleus can be
formed without live-ins. The Bridge
is now well-established with its own
funding and a strong volunteer
group. A strong nucleus can be had
without live-ins."
"Undoubtedly," said Massey, all
such organizations would want resi
dent staffers if given the opportunity
and space. "I really care about The
Bridge and want to see its continued
viability. I wouldn't approach the
ejection of live-ins if I though it
would be harmful," he said.
The Bridge has offered space to

various groups, including Sisters
in-Stanford, the Asian-American
Students Association, and Con
traceptive Counseling. No group
thus far has expressed any particular
need or desire for Bridge office
space.
Some groups formerly housed at
The Bridge have been moved out.
Students United for Rape Elimina
tion was transferred to the Old
Firehouse, and the Women's Center
has also found space of its own at the
eating clubs. The Gay Counseling
Group maintains an office at The
Bridge.
