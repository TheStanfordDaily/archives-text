# SURE expands escort service to include off-campus locations
## 
### Vic Menon 
Effective tonight, the student escorts will be available
for women who are traveling from University grounds to
any point within a mile of the campus perimeter. The
service has confined itself to campus grounds until now.
Ron Lepow, director of Students United for Rape
Elimination (SURE), said the high incidence of rape in the
Palo Alto area was behind the expansion of the escort
service. More than 25 rapes have been reported in Palo
Alto this year. At least four rapists are still at large.
SURE escorts will accompany women from University
grounds to off-campus locations but will not operate in
the other direction.
"This alleviates the difficulty of locating off-campus
addresses, since the user of the service will be able to
direct the escort," he said.
In addition, people who want to be escorted off
campus must be riding bicycles.
SURE escorts are student volunteers operating under
the auspices of the Stanford Police Department and the
Dean of Student Affairs. The service, now in its second

year of existence, includes both men and women es
corts, the latter working in pairs. All escorts are Univer
sity students.
Each escort is equipped with a whistle, a flashlight and
a security identification card. All are used to identify the
SURE escort.
SURE receives only a few calls each night. Lepow sur
mised that many potential users of the service do not
take time to wait for an escort, not realizing that the
average response time is only about five minutes. He
added that other potential users probably feel they are
"putting someone to a lot of trouble, when in fact each
escort has one two-hour shift each week, during which
time he or she is waiting to respond to calls from the
SURE dispatcher."
SURE operates Sunday through Thursday, 8:30 p.m. to
12:30 a.m. The SURE dispatch telephone number is 497-
3217; a message may also be left during the day to make
arrangements for an escort later that night. Free phones
in all the libraries may be used to call SURE.
