## Moshe Dayan quits 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) â€” Moshe Dayan res
igned yesterday as Israel's foreign
minister, angered by Prime Minister
Menachem Begin's continued tough
line on the Palestinian issue.
The surprise resignation of the
military hero-turned-political
maverick threatened to deal a sharp
blow to Begin's shaky government
coalition. But its political impact
could not be assessed immediately.
The opposition Labor Party im
mediately renewed its call for new
elections, but Begin is expected to
reject the idea.
The 64-year-old Dayan, who un
derwent cancer surgery earlier this
year, notified Begin of his wish to
resign in a secret letter Oct. 2. He
confirmed it with another note to
Begin at yesterday's regular Cabinet
meeting, and the decision was an
nounced.
In the letter, read to reporters by
Cabinet Secretary Arieh Naor, Dayan
said he already had "expressed my
reservations on the way in which

negotiations on Palestinian au
tonomy are being conducted, and I
said that under these conditions I see
no purpose in my continuing in this
government as foreign minister."
Talks 'barren'
He said he believed the autonomy
talks of the past four months have
been "to a large extent barren
negotiations."
He described Israel's relations
with the Palestinian Arabs of the oc
cupied territories as "the key ques
tion in our lives over the years, one
which can be solved."
The solution envisioned by Dayan,
who was Israel's chief negotiator in
the treaty talks with Egypt, was
coexistence on an equal level.
He apparently thought the Israeli
negotiating stand did not go far
enough in outlining a partnership.
He felt not enough was being done
to attract Palestinians from the oc
cupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and the Gaza Strip into the talks, and
held eight secret meetings this year
with Palestinian leaders.
Dayan's resignation does not take
effect until tomorrow morning, but it
appeared unlikely he would retract
it.
Begin's 'deep sorrow'
Begin said he would take over
Dayan's tasks until a new foreign
minister is appointed and approved
by Parliament. The prime minister
expressed "deep sorrow" over the
resignation, which he called "an im
portant national and international
event."
Dayan, dashing patch-eyed army
general in the 1956 Arab-Israeli war
and defense minister in the 1967 and
1973 wars, said he will keep his Parli
ament seat, but he announced no
other personal plans.
He underwent surgery this year to
remove a cancerous intestinal tumor
and again to repair his vocal cords,
which were damaged in 1968.
