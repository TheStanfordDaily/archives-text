### Karen Springen 
Former Stanford Ail-American
football player Jack Chappie was kil
led in a plane crash at Palo Alto Air
port Friday night.
Chappie, 36, was a defensive guard
for Stanford from 1962 to 1964. He
joined the San Francisco 49ers but a
neck injury cut short his playing
career. He later returned to the Uni
versity to earn both a business and
law degree.
The Atherton resident was a pas
senger in a $1.4-million Merlin 2B
turboprop aircraft that flipped over
after landing at Palo Alto Airport at
11:27 p.m. Friday. The craft skidded
across the runway and smashed into
seven parked planes.
Also killed in the crash was George
Magulac, 24, of San Carlos, a busi
ness associate of Chappie's. The
pilot, Charles Lee Hadley, Jr., 33, of
Fremont, was taken to Stanford Uni
versity Hospital where he was listed
in stable condition last night with
head, chest and leg injuries.
The plane was owned by Valley
Equity Co. of Palo Alto, an invest
ment firm co-owned by Chappie.
The men were returning from a
business trip to Arizona, according
to Magulac's father.
Witnesses told Palo Alto police

they saw the plane approach the air
port and touch the runway in what
seemed to be a normal landing.
But then the plane started to climb
again, they said. It rolled to the left
and crashed head-on into seven
parked aircraft, demolishing one and
causing major damage to three
others.
A Palo Alto fireman who helped
remove the victims from the wrec
kage said it took half an hour to re
move the two dead passengers and
more than 45 minutes to remove
Hadley.
Cause of the crash is still unknown
and is under investigation by the Na
tional Transportation Safety Board.
Chappie was named to the News
paper Enterprise Association's Ail-
American list in 1964 for his perfor
mance as Stanford's defensive
guard.
Assoc. Director of Athletics Robert
Young remembered Chappie as a
"good athlete." Assistant football
coach Ray Handley desribed the man
as "intense and aggressive on the
playing field and fun-loving" when
the game ended.
He added that he had seen Chap
pie running up the University steps
into the Quad only a few days ago,
still trying to keep in shape.
