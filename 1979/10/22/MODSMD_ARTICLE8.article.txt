# 'We shall not survive'
## 'Issues of the '80s' raises concern on international issues 
### Kati Andreasson Samuel Howe 
Though champagne flowed when
the conference culminated, the par
ticipants raised doubts about the
prospects for celebration in the
world in the decade ahead.
A number of experts, half from
the Hoover Institution here and
most of the remainder from other
University departments took part in
the "Issues of the '80s" program
sponsored by the Alumni Associa
tion, Saturday at Memorial Au
ditorium.
On international issues, concern
was generally raised about Ameri
ca's "loss of vision" as the leader of
the free world and on the military
threat posed by the Soviet Union.
Domestically, most of the speak
ers prophesied public pressures for
a concept of "limited government"
in the 1980s and extolled recent ef
forts across the nation aimed at tax
limitations and deregulation of gov

ernment control.
Conservative ideology was the
order of the day, although some
conflicting views were aired during
panei discussions.
Book on '80s
The conference was an offshoot
of a major research project recently
completed at the Hoover Institution
to result in a book, The United
States in the 1980s, expected to be
published in January.
One of the book's co-editors,
Hoover Director of African Studies
Peter Duignan, lamented the limits
of American power abroad and the
gradual loss of military strength to
the Soviet Union.
"We shall not survive," Duignan
said, "unless we save more than we
spend, work more than we play, and
build more tanks than we build
cars."
Duignan scared
The findings "scare the hell out of
me," he added.
He pointed out what he termed

the Soviet exploitation of Africa, cit
ing Soviet intervention in the affairs
of Ethiopia, North Yemen, and Af
ghanistan, as well as in Angola.
And, Duignan said, given this very
real threat, "an imperial (U.S.) pres
idency is no longer a danger â€” but a
weak one is." He said that interna
tional perceptions of a weak leader
in this country have done much to
undermine the confidence in the
U.S. role as leader of the free world.
Soviets may dominate
Duignan claimed that the leaders
of the Soviet Union believe they can
"fight, survive and win nuclear
war," and that unless the United
States responds to this threat by
preparation, "the Soviets will over
take us."
Alvin Rabushka, a senior fellow at
the Institution and the other co
editor of the book, said that on the
domestic scene, "an equally chal
lenging but optimistic future" lies
ahead.
He said that Americans have

gradually perceived, over the last
few years, that "social problems are
not solved by throwing money
around."
Tax cuts encouraging
He cited as encouraging signs of a
new public approach to limited gov
ernment recent moves in several
states to constitutionally limit taxa
tion and/or government spending,
including California's Proposition
13.
Rabushka praised Proposition 13,
saying that unemployment is at an
all-time low in California.
Claiming that a welfare state "de
stroys work incentives for the
poor," Rabushka called for a "li
mited approach to government,"
and prophesied a "heightened call
for renewed competition made pos
sible by decreased regulation," in
the 1980s.
Economic issues
Milton Friedman, famed
economist and a senior research fel
low at Hoover, said that in the 1980s

"inflation, unemployment and big
government will continue to be the
headline (economic) issues."
However, the Nobel laureate con
tinued, those issues will all be sub
servient to a far more fundamental
issue concerning the basic role of
government.
Americans, he said, are caught in
a conflict between a conception of
government based on individual
freedom and responsibility (limited
government) and a conception of
government based on paternalism.
Extent of gov't
Sharp debate over the legitimate
extent of government interference
and regulation will come to a head,
he said, "and the real issue is how
that battle will be resolved."
The morning portion of the prog
ram concluded with a panel discus
sion on domestic issues of the 1980s.
On the panel were Rita Ricardo
Campbell and John Bun/el, both
senior fellows at Hoover, as well as
Stanford Economics Prof. Michael

Boskin and Everett Ladd, Jr., direc
tor of the University of Connecticut
Social Science Data Center.
Boskin criticized the U.S. social
security system from a financial
angle, saying that an increase in the
retiree-to-worker ratio by the end of
the century will put "tremendous
pressure" on the system to be
changed. Earlier, Friedman had de
cried the system as an example of a
government measure which un
dermines the family as a basic (so
cial) unit."
Health, education
Bunzel discussed the erosion of
the educational standards in
America, while Campbell, an expert
on health care, said that health-care
education in this country should be
a greater priority than a national
health care plan. There is no evi
dence that "planned allocation" of
care would work better than the cur
rent system of private care with
some government support, he ad
