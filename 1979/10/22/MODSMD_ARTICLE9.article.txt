## Chile communist denounces junta 
### Susan Essoyan 
The gradualism of the
elected socialist government
of Salvador Allende doomed it
to failure and facilitated the es
tablishment of "facism" in
Chile, Jorge Palacios, exiled
secretariat of the Revolutio
nary Communist Party of Chile,
said in a speech here Thursday
night.
The controversial speaker is
touring the United States to
discuss the Chilean "people's
struggle." His tour coincides
with U.S. publication of his
latest book, Chile: An Attempt
at Historic Compromise.
Delays in granting Palacios a
visa complicated his visit to the
United States. "Forces have
tried through all kinds of
means to prevent the American
people from hearing his re
marks," Lucas Cracia, presi
dent of the Palacios Tour Or
ganizing Committee, said.
The more than 200 persons
attending the speech had to
file slowly into Kresge Au
ditorium while members of the
committee checked bags for
"security reasons."
In his speech, Palacios de
nounced the military regime of
General Agusto Pinochet.
Pinochet's regime, backed by
the armed forces, deposed Al
lende in 1973 and has sent
more than one million persons
into exile, jailed more than
150,000 political prisoners, kil
led 20,000 persons including
Allende, and abolished legal
guarantees, representative in
stitutions and political parties,
he said.
Palacios served as chairman
of the Philosophy Department
at the University of Chile while
Allende was in power, but,
along with other Marxist pro
fessors, was suspended from
this position when Allende was
overthrown. Palacios now lives
in exile in Paris.
Unstable situation
Palacios condemned the
U.S. and Soviet roles in bring
ing Pinochet to power, saying
Senate testimony confirms
American guilt in engineering
the coup. But he said the
superpowers only exploited an
already unstable situation.

Speaking through interpret
ers, Palacios attributed the
coup to "causes deriving di
rectly from the Allende gov
ernment itself."
Allende, a socialist, elected
president in 1970 by a small
plurality, headed a leftwing co
alition government, Popular
Unity. The quick end of Al
lende's "gradual, peaceful
road to socialism" indicates
the concept is "absurd,"
Palacios said.
"Popular Unity won only an
election and gained control of
the government, which is just
one part of state power,"
Palacios said. "Reactionary
forces in Chile retained control
of the parliament, courts,
press, economy, police and
armed forces, he said.
Palacios criticized a gun con
trol law enacted under Allende
which prevented the Chilean
people from arming them
selves to "fight facism."
'Arm the masses'
"I am convinced that if the
Allende government and the
opportunities had not pre
dominated, if it had been de
cided to mobilize and arm the
masses, we would have been
able to beat back the rise of
facism," he concluded.
Allende failed to institute
what Palacios called "authentic
socialism." Although he
nationalized some industries,
ensuring state control, he did
not ensure that the proletariat
controlled the state, Palacios
said.
When asked to cite an exam
ple of a political system in
which the proletariat controls
matters of state like the one he
envisioned for Chile, Palacios
could not.
"At present the great
number of experiences of sei
zure of power by the pro
letariat are on their way back to
a system of exploitation," he
said.
Marxism still valid
But, he added, the retrog
ression that has occurred in
these countries does not in
validate Marxist theory.
The Revolutionary Com
munist Party now operating
clandestinely in Chile, is

"stronger than ever before,"
according to Palacios. "The
masses have begun to lose
their fear (of Pinochet) and
wage a constantly more open
struggle against the junta," he
said. This growing resistance is
evidenced in workers' de
monstrations which took place
last May Day in 17 Chilean
cities, he said.
Speech sponsors at the Uni
versity included the Bechtel In
ternational Center, Revolutio
nary Communist Youth
Brigade, Latin American
Studies, Speakers Bureau and
Council of Presidents (COP).
The Spanish Department
here declined to sponsor the
speech and faculty members
refused to allow posters an
nouncing the speech inside
the Spanish Department, ac
cording to Robert Pelta, a
member of the Revolutionary
Communist Youth Brigade.
Members of the department
were unavailable for comment

Allende government and the
opportunities had not pre
dominated, if it had been de
cided to mobilize and arm the
masses, we would have been
able to beat back the rise of
facism," he concluded.
Allende failed to institute
what Palacios called "authentic
socialism." Although he
nationalized some industries,
ensuring state control, he did
not ensure that the proletariat
controlled the state, Palacios
said.
When asked to cite an exam
ple of a political system in
which the proletariat controls
matters of state like the one he
envisioned for Chile, Palacios
could not.
"At present the great
number of experiences of sei
zure of power by the pro
letariat are on their way back to
a system of exploitation," he
said.
Marxism still valid
But, he added, the retrog
ression that has occurred in
these countries does not in
validate Marxist theory.
The Revolutionary Com
munist Party now operating
clandestinely in Chile, is

"stronger than ever before,"
according to Palacios. "The
masses have begun to lose
their fear (of Pinochet) and
wage a constantly more open
struggle against the junta," he
said. This growing resistance is
evidenced in workers' de
monstrations which took place
last May Day in 17 Chilean
cities, he said.
Speech sponsors at the Uni
versity included the Bechtel In

Chilean revulutionary Jorge Palacios said that former President
Salvador Allende's "gradual" policies gave rise to facism in Chile.
The gradualism of the
elected socialist government
of Salvador Allende doomed it
to failure and facilitated the es
tablishment of "facism" in
Chile, Jorge Palacios, exiled
secretariat of the Revolutio
nary Communist Party of Chile,
said in a speech here Thursday
night.
The controversial speaker is
touring the United States to
discuss the Chilean "people's
struggle." His tour coincides
with U.S. publication of his
latest book, Chile: An Attempt
at Historic Compromise.
Delays in granting Palacios a
visa complicated his visit to the
United States. "Forces have
tried through all kinds of
means to prevent the American
people from hearing his re
marks," Lucas Cracia, presi
dent of the Palacios Tour Or
ganizing Committee, said.
The more than 200 persons
attending the speech had to
file slowly into Kresge Au
ditorium while members of the
committee checked bags for
"security reasons."
In his speech, Palacios de
nounced the military regime of
General Agusto Pinochet.
Pinochet's regime, backed by
the armed forces, deposed Al
lende in 1973 and has sent
more than one million persons
into exile, jailed more than
150,000 political prisoners, kil
led 20,000 persons including
Allende, and abolished legal
guarantees, representative in
stitutions and political parties,
he said.
Palacios served as chairman
of the Philosophy Department
at the University of Chile while
Allende was in power, but,
along with other Marxist pro
fessors, was suspended from
this position when Allende was
overthrown. Palacios now lives
in exile in Paris.
Unstable situation
Palacios condemned the
U.S. and Soviet roles in bring
ing Pinochet to power, saying
Senate testimony confirms
American guilt in engineering
the coup. But he said the
superpowers only exploited an
already unstable situation.

Speaking through interpret
ers, Palacios attributed the
coup to "causes deriving di
rectly from the Allende gov
ernment itself."
Allende, a socialist, elected
president in 1970 by a small
plurality, headed a leftwing co
alition government, Popular
Unity. The quick end of Al
lende's "gradual, peaceful
road to socialism" indicates
the concept is "absurd,"
Palacios said.
"Popular Unity won only an
election and gained control of
the government, which is just
one part of state power,"
Palacios said. "Reactionary
forces in Chile retained control
of the parliament, courts,
press, economy, police and
armed forces, he said.
Palacios criticized a gun con
trol law enacted under Allende
which prevented the Chilean
people from arming them
selves to "fight facism."
'Arm the masses'
"I am convinced that if the
Allende government and the
opportunities had not pre
dominated, if it had been de
cided to mobilize and arm the
masses, we would have been
able to beat back the rise of
facism," he concluded.
