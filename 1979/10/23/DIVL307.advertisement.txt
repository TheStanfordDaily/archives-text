OPEN STATEMENT TO THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY
BY TDS, INC.
(OPERATOR OF THE COFFEE HOUSE)
TDS, Inc., is a privately owned food sen/ice management company which has been
contracted by the University to operate the food services in Tresidder Union.
Tresidder and thus TDS, seeks to serve a broad spectrum of students, faculty, staff,
guests and visitors.
The Coffee House customer count (a prime index of participation/satisfaction) had
declined from 333,540 as of July 23rd a year ago to 299,669 at the same date th's
year (1979). The operation has consistently lost money over the last year.
Informal probes of the market on campus, conducted by student members of the
Food Service Advisory Committee, confirmed that there were many potential
customers who could not find what they wanted at the Coffee House (viz., beer and
wine, sanitary preparation and food handling, quick service).
A complete re-thinking of the Coffee House's programs and service modes was
undertaken which led to the changes this summer.
The Sales (revenues) had been flat, corrected for inflation until the beer and wine
service was begun in the spring; since then, there has been a slight increase in actual
sales. The previous Coffee House managers resisted the addition of beer and wine
at every juncture, finally having to be ordered to comply with this intended bever
age service expansion.
During the past winter and spring, the Merchandising Standards Supervisor of TDS
spent nearly six weeks working in the Coffee House in order to re-instate the
minimum standards of service and sanitation (personal hygiene and food prepara
tion areas). The operation was re-focused with more efficient job descriptions and
scheduling. It was made clear that children and infants would no longer be tolerated
in the kitchen. All of these basic operational standards were not only ignored but
resisted by the Coffee House managers and workers.
The Coffee House managers and employees refused to use TDS' authorized
suppliers, which tended to erode the potential purchasing efficiencies and, con
sequently, worsen the inflationary pressure on retail (selling) prices in the Coffee
House. This pressure was aggravated, too, by the overstaffing and inefficient labor
schedules, which the former managers and workers had refused to alter.
Abnormal fluctuations of food cost occurred with a large amount of food and
product unaccounted for.
Because of the numerous operation problems, it was determined that a complete
overhaul of the Coffee House operation was necessary, including substantial staff
and management changes. Accordingly effective July 27, 1979 the entire staff and
management were terminated and the operation was temporarily shut down.
During the shutdown the facility was re-furbished and new managment and some
new staff were brought in to implement the planned operational changes. Some of
the former employees we're hired. We sought and made changes in order to
provide a Coffee House which would better serve Stanford; a service marked by
cleanliness, efficiency, good service, friendliness, the lowest possible costs to
customers, and a service that would welcome all members of the Stanford Com
munity.
