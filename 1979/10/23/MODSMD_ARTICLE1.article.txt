# Israeli court decision on West Bank
## Settlement ruled illegal 
### 
Jerusalem (AP) â€” The Israeli Sup
reme Court, in a landmark decision
that surprised the nation, ruled yes
terday that the government had il
legally seized private Arab land for a
Jewish settlement and ordered that
the hilltop outpost in the West Bank
be abandoned.
The ruling, the first in which an
Israeli court found a settlement in
the occupied territories to be illegal,
came just a day after Moshe Dayan
resigned as foreign minister in a
deep-seated dispute over the settle
ment policies of Prime Minister
Menachem Begin's government and
its tough line on Palestinian au
tonomy.
The developments dealt a one-two
punch to Begin's ruling coalition,
and hopeful speculation raced
through Arab capitals yesterday that
they might foreshadow major
changes in Israel.
No-confidence
The government will face several
motions of no-confidence in the Is

raeli Parliament today. But it is ex
pected to survive them, and Begin
will probably reject the opposition
Labor Party's call for new elections.
The five judge Supreme Court or
dered that the settlement at Elon
Moreh, near the Arab-populated
town of Nablus in the West Bank of
the Jordan River, be dismantled
within 30 days.
Security reasons
The court, acting on an appeal by
17 Arabs whose land was exprop
riated for the settlement, ruled that
the site was chosen by Begin's gov
ernment under pressure from
right-wing settlers and rejected the
argument that it was needed for sec
urity reasons.
The decision was a clear warning to
the government that the plea of na
tional security will no longer be au
tomatically accepted as a reason for
seizing land for settlement.
In Cairo, Egypt's top peace
negotiator, Butros Chali, called the
court decision "a positive step" and

predicted it would encourage West
Bank and Caza Strip Palestinians to
end their boycott and join the U.S.-
Egyptian-Israeli talks on autonomy
for the two occupied territories.
Palestinians
West Bank Palestinian leaders also
applauded the ruling but said all
Jewish settlements should be re
moved. "All settlements must go,"
said Mayor Elias Freij of Bethlehem.
Nablus Mayor Bassam Shaka noted
that the ruling appeared to apply
only to Elon Moreh and said he
feared it would be interpreted as giv
ing legitimacy to all other West Bank
settlements not built on private land.
There are 52 other settlements, inha
bited by approximately 12,000 Jews.
