# University policy allows profs to keep working past age 65
## 
### Adam Newar 
The California Legislature
recently passed a law calling
for mandatory retirement at
the age of 70 in the state of
California.
This law designates 70 as
the minimum age that a
corporation or institution
can force one of its workers
to retire. Prior to the adop
tion of this law, California
had no mandatory retire
ment age, although most
employers held 65 as the
"normal" retirement age.
Stanford was and is no ex
ception to this rule. Over
the last six months, there
has been controversy over
how this law will affect the
University's policies and
how these policies should
be changed in order to be
just and equitable to all in
volved.
Over the years, Stanford's
policy has been to retire te
nured faculty at age 65, and
this policy will be main
tained until July 1, 1982. At
this time, the new California
law will go into effect and
mandatory retirement age

will become 70 throughout
the state.
This change, however,
presents a problem to those
reaching 65 between now
and July 1, 1982. The major
ity of older professors
would rather continue
working past 65, but the
present policy will not allow
them to do so.
In order to accommodate
those professors who will
reach 65 between now and
July 1, 1982, the University
has taken advantage of a
windowin theold California
law which will allow these
faculty members the option
of working past 65 on a half
time basis, according to
Gerald Lieberman, vice
provost and dean of re
search.
The "kicker" in this op
tion, however, is that those
who choose to work on a
half-time basis will not re
ceive contributions to their
retirement funds from the
University after the age of
65.
To many, the concept of
forcing an individual to re

tire just because he reaches
a certain age is unjust.
Dr. Ross McFarland, in a
study commissioned by
Harvard University, claims
to have conclusively proved
that " 'age per se is not cor
related to performance,' "
and has postulated that the
reason for an age specifica
tion for retirement is the
stereotype of older adults
being functionally limited
and unproductive.
Although some believe it
is unfair to force someone
to retire at a certain age,
others argue thai it is a
necessary and efficient
manner of establishing pen
sion progravs and employ
ment opportunities.
President Richard Lyman,
in an interview last May,
commented that "it would
be more painful to have ab
solutely no retirement age
than to have the by-and
large reasonable one of 70."
He also stated that a man
datory retirement age of 70
"would certainly ease our
problem of insuring that

there will be some openings
for younger people."
According to Lieberman,
the faculty has been pleased
with the changes made by
the legislature and by the
University. Most faculty
members accept the notion
of mandatory retirement,
but, in recent years, there
have been complaints about
their retirement funds.
In a letter published by
Campus Report, the Univer
sity's weekly newspaper for
faculty and staff, 46 profes
sors cited the argument that
a professor who earns
$36,000 a year at retirement
will receive $12,000 a year
after retirement. If one as
sumes an inflation rate of 8
percent, the purchasing
power of this pension is re
duced to $8,100 in five years
and to $5,480 in ten years.
The administration, in re
sponse to this analysis, has
been studying the problem
but admits that it is "no sim
ple matter so long as infla
tion is out of control."
