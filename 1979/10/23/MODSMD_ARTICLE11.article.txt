# Group offers dance opportunities
## 
### Rose Cecile Chan 
Classes in jazz, ballet and
modern dance and a semi
monthly dance film series are
just a few of the activities on
the University's Dance
Quorum calendar.
A year old club, the Dance
Quorum was founded by two
dance students "to extend and
diversify the Stanford Dance
Program," according to co
founder Leslee Lewis.
"This year we want to make
the quorum offer something to
people, even people who
don't want to actually dance
but who have a desire to be
involved in dance," said
Eugenia Haney, a T.A. in
dance.
The club's only major activity
last year was sponsorship of a
class in beginning ballet.
'More organized'
Haney and another graduate
student in dance, Julie Wes
ton, will help oversee this
year's activities and hope to be
much more "organized" than
when the club started out last
year.
"The club is open to anyone
who wants to support dance at
Stanford," said Haney. The 20
people at the club's first meet
ing this year varied from those
with hardly any dance experi
ence to seasoned dancers.
They showed diversified in
terests in ballet, modern, jazz,
various ethnic forms, and

effort-shape dance (movement
analysis).
Proposed activities
In addition to the classes and
the film series, activities prop
osed at the meeting included
sponsoring master classes by
guest artists, helping out with
Dance Dept. productions, and
also raising funds to sup

port the various programs.
Group trips to dance concerts
in the Bay Area and an ambiti
ous student production in
winter were also suggested.
"Last year was its birth," said
Haney. "This year it's ready to
roll."
The $15 membership fee for
the year entitles the student to

free admission to quorum
guest master classes, to film
showings, and to a reduction
in registration fees for
lengthier workshops.
Classes, in both beginning
jazz and ballet, are taught by
Lewis, Beth johnson and Kristy
Scott, all graduate students in
dance.
