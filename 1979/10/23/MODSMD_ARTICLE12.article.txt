# 'Attempt to heighten political consciousness'
## Students sponsor mock SALT debate 
### Margaret Lane 
As political dissension over
the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT II) treaty increases
and national leaders grow
doubtful of its November
ratification, students here are
actively searching for a deeper
knowledge of SALT 11.
Students from Toyon and
American Studies are sponsor
ing a series of informative
programs on SALT to culminate
in an actual student simulation
of the U.S. Senate SALT debate
on October 30.
Peter Stamos, a Toyon hous
ing associate (RA) and coor
dinator of the events with Alex
Alben of American Studies and
the combined resident staffs,
explained that the project
evolved from a growing stu
dent need for in-depth com
prehension of current interna
tional affairs and the political
process through which solu
tions are sought.
"There is a strong, compel
ling reason to ratify SALT II,"
he claimed. "The best way to
achieve this is through educa
tion. After students are in
formed on the issues, they will
be encouraged to write their
senators and express their
views," Stamos said.
The SALT programs will at
tempt to heighten the political
consciousness of Stanford stu
dents within residences.
Stamos said he believes that
the debate will elicit students'
own positions on SALT and the
present U.S. political process.
Students will, thus, have the
opportunity to t.ike a political
stance through active partici
pation.
Various speakers represent
ing different viewpoints on
SALT have been chosen to en
lighten students. Alben and

Stamos both stressed that the
overall program is designed to
ensure objectivity through the
diversified range of speakers.
Earlier this month, Dr. Sidney
Drell, deputy director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) and prominent
national defense advisor spoke
on "Why SALT?" An anti-SALT
opinion was presented by Prof.
Henry S. Roen, of the Public
Management Program at the
Business School last Tuesday.
Tomorrow, students will
hear an alternative perspective
from History Prof. Barton
Bernstein. Finally, Dr. Coit
Blacker, assistant director of
Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Program and an
advisor to student participants
in the debatealong with Alben,
will acquaint listeners with the
Soviet out- look on SALT.
Nearly 75 persons expressed
an initial interest in the SALT
discussions. The direct interac
tion with speakers is stressed
by the coordinators; "the small
groups provide an intellectual
dialogue between speakers
and students" said Stamos.
The symposium's goal, an
enactment of the U.S. Senate
SALT debates which will prob
ably reach the Senate floor in
November, will give students
the opportunity to take direct

action and reach conclusions
on SALT 11.
Alben explained that 12 vol
unteers will represent the Se
nate at large and reflect its de
mographic structure â€” seven
Democrats and five Republi
cans. Students will assume the
roles of prominent senators,
including Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.), George McGovern
(D-So. Dakota), Alan Cranston
(D-Calif.), and lake Garn (R-
Utah).
Alben and Blacker will per
torm the roles of legislative
aides in two formal briefing
sessions prior to the debate.
"We hope to bring the legisla
tive process to life while
familiarizing Stanford students
with a set of important issues,"
said Alben.
The debates will adhere to
simplified rules of the Senate
Armed Services Committee,
assuming that the issue has
passed the Foreign Relations
Committee. The student
senators will make short
speeches on the Senate floor.
Possible amendments to the
treaty and a debate for ratifica
tion will close the debate. All
possible resources to add "re
ality" to the situation, such as a
sergeant at arms and a press
gallery, will be used.
