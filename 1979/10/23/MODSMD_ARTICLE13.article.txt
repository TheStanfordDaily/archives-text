## Palestinian homeland imperative 
### 
I'd like to respond to Debra
Leigh's "Egypt, Israel Working
Toward Peace" (Daily, Oct. 12).
Leigh's major thesis is that
"Egypt and Israel have agreed
that, by working with each
other, by creating rather than
destroying, the Middle East
could blossom." That sounds
very nice.
In reality, however, the
Egyptian-Israeli agreement has
made the Middle East more
miserable than it has ever been
since the establishment of Is
rael in 1948. Let's see how this
is the case.
The Egyptian soldiers that
had been stationed on the Is
raeli front were not sent back
home, i.e. after Camp David,
to work in factories and farms
that will put food in their starv
ing compatriots' mouths (Let
alone making the Middle East
"blossom!"). Instead, they
were increased and sent out to
four fronts.
Some of them were sent to
Libya where they captured a
few Libyan sandhills and killed
a few Libyan nomads. About
four thousand men were sent
to help dictator Mobutu of
Zaire to suppress his people's
rebellion against his ruthlessly
corrupt regime.
A few thousand Egyptian
soldiers were sent to King Has
san II of Morocco to bolster his
corrupt,hated regime against
any possible public upheaval.
A few thousand Egyptian sol
diers are now in Oman fighting
the Omani people who are in
rebellion against their criminal
Sultan Kaboos.
As a result of being "re
lieved" on the Egyptian front,
Israel's intransigence on the
other fronts has been
bolstered. Assured of Sadat's
"love, cooperation, friendship
and help," Israel has managed,
since the signing of Camp
David, to kill over 3200

Lebanese and Palestinian civi
lians, to put almost one million
Lebanese in refugee camps,
and to literally reduce Lebanon
to rubble.
Leigh asks, "Why does the
rest of the Arab World so bit
terly oppose the idea of peace
with Israel?" and answers it by
claiming that "four-fifths of
historic Palestine already exists
as an Arab state, namely Jor
dan."
The question is absurd be
cause the Arab states do not
oppose the idea of peace with
Israel.
However, they certainly op
pose an unjust "peace" like
that convened at Camp David;
they oppose selling the Pales
tinians out to destruction and
diaspora which is precisely
what the Camp David agree
ments amount to.
Leigh's (quoted above) ans
wer to her own question is also
equally absurd because she
must realize that Jordan is
Jordan, not Palestine. Historic
Palestine consists of the pre
-1%7-war Israel, plus the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Today, however, almost sixty
percent of Jordan's population
are Palestinians. Leigh says
they have "full citizenship."
Nothing is further from the
truth.
All of these Palestinians were
pushed out of Palestine in 1948
when Israel was established.
They were settled, temporar
ily, in refugee camps . . . sup
posedly until they were repat
riated back to Palestine. They
were never repatriated and the
majority of them still live in re
fugee camps.
Furthermore, they are sub
ject to all kinds of humiliation
and oppression under King
Hussein of Jordan. In 1970, his
army of Jordanian bedouins
massacred more Palestinians
than Israel did in 1967.
What the Arabs, and the

other Muslim and Third World
countries which oppose the
Camp David agreement are
saying is that the Palestinians
do not belong in Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon, or anywhere except
in Palestine.
What they are saying also is
that neither Israel nor Egypt,
nor the Mideast, nor anybody
else will have peace in the
Mideast unless the right of the
Palestinians to a state in Pales
tine is granted.
Since the Arab states have
been too impotent to bring the
Palestinian people to the reali
zation of their rights, the Pales
tinians have decided to take
their own destiny into their
own hands; in 1965 they estab
lished the PLO.
If the PLO does not repre
sent the Palestinians, who
does? Israel,whose establish
ment was the cause of their
misery? Or Jordan's king who
massacred them in 1970? Or
Sadat who sold them out in
Camp David? The answer is
simple: nobody represents the
Palestinians except the Palesti
nians' own PLO and anybody
who has doubts about this
should talk to any Palestinian,
anywhere.
Most of the world under
stands this fact; today there are
more nations that recognize
the PLO than nations that rec
ognize Israel.
Needless to say, Israel's in
sistence on not recognizing
the right of the Palestinians to
have their own state on their
own land will only prolong the
misery of the Middle East. Sure
enough, Israel today is power
ful enough, both in the
Mideast and in terms of its in
fluence on internal politics in
the United States to have its
supremacist policies furthered
by the crass exercise of milit
ary, financial and media
power.
However, in the long run, it

is as much in Israel's interest as
it is in the U.S. interest and the
Arabs' interest, for Israel to
share Palestine with the Pales
tinians.
Simply put, this means allow
ing a Palestinian state to take
place in the West Bank and
Gaza. The Palestinians will not
settle for anything less than
that.
