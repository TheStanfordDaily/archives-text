Reassess sexism
In order to gain any real cre
dibility, members of the
feminist movement are going
to have to admit some things to
both themselves (if they ha
ven't already) and to the gen
eral public, things that both
Johanna Hansen and Pat Berge
(Daily, Oct. 18) clearly aren't
willing to do.
That Dan Rath's comments
(Daily, Oct. 12) are wrong on
one level is undeniable. But on
another I think they are in line.
Hansen indicated that she
selects her attire (at least for
football games) on a strictly
utilitarian, functional level:
"Nor did I stop to think that my
more conservative clothes
might be a little too constrict
ing to wear to an event which
includes much jumping and
leaping about."
Why is it then that so often
we see the women in atten
dance at the football games
wearing clothes that are so
tight (constricting?) that they
reveal every nook and cranny
of their anatomical features. Is
it comfortable that way?
And, if tight clothes are not
meant to at least distract the
male population, why then
does Berge suggest that wear
ing tight jeans will cover up for
the calculus text she might be
carrying?
Leaders of the women's
movement are going to have to
admitthat menandwomen will
continue to be attracted to
each other on a physical basis,
and that this is not necessarily
wrong. I certainly agree that
such a basis should not form
the sole criteria for judging a
woman or a man, as Berge

rightly says is now often the
case, but it can take part.
The whole concept of
"judgement" is at first thought
not very attractive, but it even
tually comes down to that:
Who should I goout with?, etc.
One last thought on
"looks." Helen Curley Brown,
editor of Cosmopolitan, who,
in light of her business success
in a publishing world full of
men must be considered
highly by many feminists, re
cently said, "the most impor
tant reason for looking good is
so you have someone to go to
bed with." I don't agree, but
I'm sure many of her followers
do.
So let's be honest with one
another, and with ourselves.
Only then can an effort be
made that will bring the type of
equality to women and men
that is deserved.

Sexist language
With regard to Kim Ban
croft's column on sexist lan
guage (Daily, Oct. 16), my one
feeling after reading it was a
feeling I have experienced and
expressed many times.
While sexist language is one
of the many obstacles in the
path toward equality of the
sexes, it is by no means the
most pressing.
It seems to me that, if more
women focused on changing
the attitudes of men and the
myths which perpetuate op
pression of women, the adop
tion of non-sexist language
would follow naturally with the

enlightenment of men.
All too often the
technicalities of an issue as
sume major importance, and
valuable energy and good in
tent is lost in the process.
And though I agree that such
comments as "She's a good
scientist, for a woman," as well
as language which portrays the
entire human race as "man
kind," do reflect misconcep
tions and negative attitudes
toward women, I feel very
strongly that to change the lan
guage, we must first change
the way we are viewed in this
society.
I believe that the Women's
Movement can only be suc
cessful if we refrain from the
inclination to take men by
storm, granting them the un
derstanding and patience
necessary to change terminol
ogy they have used all their
lives.
And when I realize how
much has changed in the at
titudes of people I know and
deal with, in such a short span
of time, I can easily ignore a
few "slips." The issue here is
not one of terminology; it is
one of attitudes which have
existed since the beginnings of
civilization.

Heart-y mascot
While listening to the UCLA
game from my hospital bed
with my life hanging by the slim
threads of Turk Schonert's and
)ohn Elway's passes, I heard a
comment by one of the KZSU
announcers which gave a brief
surge to my pacemaker.
The most accurate descrip

tion of Stanford football I have
yet heard was uttered from the
lips of that unsuspecting an
nouncer.
"The Cardiac Cards," he
said, and from my hospital bed
on the verge of a coronary, I
was in no condition to disag
ree.
It is my belief that if the Car
diacs was to be placed on the
ballot for the Stanford Mascot
along with Griffons, Trees and
the incumbent Cardinals it
would probably win handily.
Some of the more convincing
reasons that make the Cardiac
symbol appropriate are the fol
lowing:
1) It succinctly captures the
Unpredictable and exciting na
ture of Stanford football.
2) In the same vein as the
Stanford band, it makes a
lighthearted attack on the trad
itional and often ridiculous
symbols of strength used by
other teams (e.g. Bears, Tigers,
Dolphins, etc.).
3) The Stanford colors would
be aptly represented.
4) It offers tremendous pos
sibilities for entertaining
halftime shows by the band â€”
e.g. reviving the slumping
"Cardiacs" with a new device
invented by a brilliant Stanford
researcher, or a heart trans
plant from a Martian.
5) It has the lightheadedness
(no pun intended) of the
"Trees," while eliminating the
nebulous and rather passive
stigmas associated with such a
symbol.
6) It hopefully will not cause
minority groups to feel that
they are being degraded,
exploited and dehumanized
under the guise of healthy, ath

letic competition.
7) The symbol is naturally di
verse, allowing for occasional
drubbing at the hands of USC,
and for the times we give the
dirty Golden Bear a "Cardiac"
arrest.
Congratulations KZSU! In
my opinion, the Cardiacs is the
way to go for the 80s. I can see
the headlines already: "Tro
jans rendered ineffective by
Cardiac surge."

Meager coverage
I think the Daily was delin
quent in its duty to inform the
Stanford student body of cam
pus issues and events in its
meager pre-election coverage
of the ASSU Senate races.
Three-line endorsements are
fine, but there are some of us
who like to have a little more
information, in order to make
up our own minds. Sure, there
were a lot of candidates, but a
few brief paragraphs from each
would have taken only two or
three pages.
Either the elections are im
portant or they're not; if they
are, voters shouldn't have tQ
rely on the posters of those
who have the money to print
them.
Ironically, the same editorial
page that carried the endorse
ments also included a column
headlined:"Examine Senate
Candidates Wisely." The ques
tion, particularly for those of us
who are new to the campus is,
How?
