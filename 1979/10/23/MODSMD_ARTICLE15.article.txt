## Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Politico 
### 
The annual election of a student senate at
Stanford provides, if nothing else, a humorous
focus on a perpetual campus struggle: politicos
vs. anarchists. The first group sets up camp in
university bathrooms, adorning the walls with
new posters, old campaign issues and innova
tive acronyms.
The anarchists respond with cruder ac
ronyms, hinting that the candidates use the re
strooms to gather campaign material, not to dis
tribute it.
The debate is moot, of course, since we all
know that ASSU Senate ambitions lie some
where deep down in every one of us. Research is
only now becoming clear, but it seems that
every Stanford student will — maybe not next
year, but certainly in the next ten — someday
wake up and exclaim, "Gee, I want to be an
ASSU senator!" If not aspiring politicos, we're
all at least perspiring ones.
Now as scary as that may sound, my transfor
mation came last week and I'm really proud of
the outcome: my campaign for next year has
already begun.
I'm naturally a bit uncertain about the campus
state-of-affairs one year from now, but our new
senate made many promises,' and I have no
reason to believe that they won't be carried out.
Here, then, is my prediction of campus issues
twelve months from now and my proposed solu
tions:
Housing Draw — Our new system got rid of bad
luck, but it still perpetuates randomness. Let's
throw the whole thing out and use the same
method that the U.S. used in settling Oklahoma.
All students start from a.roped-in area in White
Plaza and, on the word "go," are allotted rooms
solely on a first come/first serve basis.
Light the Mausoleum — Tennis courts were
successfully lit last year; let's light the
mausoleum and use the building for night

raquetball. It could also be a stop on the nigl
fitness trail.
Housing Crunch — Each year 25 percent 1
Stanford students still are not guaranteed hou
ing. The university has to allow student campin
in Frost Amphitheatre and spring houseboats 0
Lake Lagunita.
Districting — Senate effectiveness can best b
achieved by districting. However, residents
districting can be unfair and unrepresentative
Instead, districting should be done according t<
routes taken to the first Monday morning class,
This would insure frequent interaction and
senator accountability.
Senate Bulletins —Weekly senate bulletins last
year were not enough. Hourly reports of senate
opinions and senator whereabouts should be
made available on the LOTS computer facility.
Inflexible Food Service Meal Plans — New
meal plans C to J still do not provide enough
meal flexibility. Let's implement plan K, a 49
meal plan, for those used to home snacking.
Mail Delivery to Dorms — Let's use Paly High
School students to deliver mail directly to stu
dent doors. This would take advantage of an
abundant, cheap resource and free the campus
of present congestion.
All-School Field Day — Last year, a student
slate at the University of Wisconsin at Madison
promised to flood the football stadium for mock
naval battles, convert parking meters into gum
ball machines, and stuff and mount all deans.
Other schools have tried it, why can't we?
I understand that I haven't covered every im
portant issue, but I think that I've learned as
much as possible from this year's election. I
wish the new senate the best of luck, and I look
forward to meeting all of you next year in cam
pus bathrooms.
