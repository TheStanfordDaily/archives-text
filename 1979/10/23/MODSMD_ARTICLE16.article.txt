## Mark Albertson Florida caucus vote is meaningless 
### 
If a President from Georgia is called a
Georgian, and a President from California
is a Californian, then what does one call a
President from Massachusetts?
Answer: a Kennedy.
Glib humor for what promises to a fairly
grim election year. Issues such as infla
tion, energy shortages and nuclear power
are not exactly side-splitters, and national
polls have shown that a vast majority of the
American public view their elected offi
cials as anything but funny.
It is against this backdrop that the
Florida caucuses were held two weeks
ago. Despite the media hoopla surround
ing these straw votes, it is hard to take the
results very seriously.
Unlike the lowa caucuses of 1975, won
by a then unknown quantity named Jimmy
Carter, the Democrats of Flcida had no
unknowns to choose from in 1979. The
three Democratic frontrunners, Carter,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), and Califor
nia Governor Jerry Brown, have already
received a great deal of media exposure.
In view of the fact that Kennedy is not yet
a confirmed candidate, and Brown did not
make any kind of a serious effort in
Florida, Carter's 2 to 1 victory over the
Massachusetts senator can hardly be con
sidered a major win.
The biggest winner in all of this was the
state of Florida, which found itself being
showered with federal grants from a sud
denly benevolent Carter administration.
That's called politics, folks.

However, the upcoming election year
will be far from dull. Although Carter's
staff may not know how to run the Ameri
can government, they do know how to run
a Presidential campaign.
Their ability to organize support at the
local level throughout the South and
Northeast cannot be underestimated, and
Carter's incumbency and his power to dis
tribute federal grants like a presidential
Santa Claus will make him a formidable
contender, despite his current low stand
ing in the polls.
The presence of Ted Kennedy as a
strong candidate will certainly cause Car
ter a great deal of trouble.
The Kennedy family is the closest thing
we have in this country to royalty and the
Senator's esteem among the American
electorate is immense.
A survey taken by Louis Harris two years
ago showed that John F. Kennedy had the
best rating of any president since World
War 11. Franklin Roosevelt was a distant
second.
It will not be hard for Sen. Kennedy to
tap this groundswell of political nostalgia,
but whether it will overcome the thorny
issue of Chappaquiddick and carry him to
victory next November is open to ques
tion.
Perhaps the most fascinating campaign
at the moment is being run by Jerry Brown.
The California governor has been seri
ously hampered by images of him as a
"flake'' and a political opportunist.

In light of Brown's fancy footwork dur
ing the Proposition 13 campaign, these
labels may have some justification.
Yet, there is a school of thought which
sees Brown as the transitional figure bet
ween the "old" New Deal-Cold War poli
tics of Carter and Kennedy, and the "new"
politics of activists such as Tom Hayden,
Sam Brown and David Harris who cut their
teeth on the antiwar movement of the
1960 s.
Many of the "flower children" of the
Vietnam War period are now wearing
three-piece suits and carrying briefcases.
As this generation enters the 1980s, their
political presence will certainly be felt.
Whether Brown will be the catalyst for
this movement remains to be seen. The
governor's campaign forays into New
Hampshire and Minnesota have been
aimed at college-age audiences, indicating
that he is trying to position himself to the
left of both Carter and Kennedy.
Nevertheless, Brown remains firmly en
trenched in third place behind the other
two Democrats.
A great deal is sure to happen between
now and the California primary next June,
when residents of this state will travel to
polling places to cast their ballots. That is,
of course, assuming they have the gas to
get there.
