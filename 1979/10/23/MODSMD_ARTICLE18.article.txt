## Lewitzky troupe's high-voltage dancing 
### 
Memorial Auditorium saw
the products of creative, intel
ligent and inventive bodies and
minds last weekend when the
Bella Lewitzky Company gave a
performance for the Lively
Arts.
The Los Angeles-based
troupe has attracted much at
tention in recent years, Ms.
Lewitzky receiving the Dance
Magazine award this year. The
group has been noted for its
"western" (versus New York)
freshness and innovation
in costume and set design as
well as in movement. The
company probably is best
known to the layman for its
bold costumes by Rudi Ger
nreich, designer of the topless
bathing suit.
Three pieces were pre
sented: V.C.O. (Voltage Con
trolled Oscillator) danced by
the company, Recesses, con
sisting of three solos, and Pas
de Bach, also performed by the
whole company. In V.C.0.,
Bella, in a convention-breaking

twist, gives her dancers control
over the music. Two dancers,
"transmitters," are wired so
that movement of certain joints
is transmitted into the squeaks,
buzzes and slides of a synth
esizer via shortwave radio.
Because of the transmitters'
contraptions, unwired "mov
ers" do most of the dancing to
recorded music bv Larry Atta
way in variations focusing on
the particular joint wired, and
as the constricted transmitter
may have wished to dance.
Though dancers have worn
bells and bangles for millennia,
V.C.O. is a first attempt to con
trol sound with the movement
of dance using the tools of the
electronic age.
Lewitzky has a great deal of
respect for her dancers as indi
viduals as well as artistic
partners. Unlike other dance
mentors, she does not see the
dancers of her company as in
struments through which she
can transmit her ideas.
Recesses developed from

her acute observations of three
of her dancers — Sean Greene,
Loretta Livingston and Iris Pell.
It is an attempt to capture their
approaches to dance and both
Lewitzky's and their percep
tions of themselves as dancers.
Recesses grabs at the trans
ience of dance. Though it usu
ally is fought against, Bella has
considered this transience
precious and lets it have its
way. It is about and can only be
performed by three particular
individuals, and every perfor
mance will change with those
dancers.
The company generally does
not "play up" to its audience,
(with the exception of Sean's
very magnetic solo in Recesses
and Jennifer Hubbert, who
kept an amazingly wicked
smile while playing with and
rearranging the wires of her
rather ridiculous radio in
V.C.O. All the fun of Pas de

Bach was in the underplayed,
almost respectful way it poked
fun at the courtly ways of fash
ionable 17th-century ladies
and gentlemen and the tradi
tions of classicJ dance—of
dueling gentlemen, of little
ladies carried around by pr
incely beaus, and of faces
quietly horrified by social im
proprieties. The company
wore flesh colored leotard and
tights dotted with metallic
roses designed by Gernreich,
the men wearing priceless
aluminum perukes, complete
with beaver-tail ponytails, the
women with aluminum
corkscrews about the face.
The Lewitzky style makes
much of a loose and easy
strength, of blending and
complementary movement,
rather than crispness and
smooth execution. There is an
attempt to take away the flash
of even the most complex and

choreographed movements
and give them an air of natural
ness.
The dancers often seem ab
sorbed and pondering, forget
ful of their audience.
The company's inwardly fo
cused character is both its
strength and its weakness. A
less-absorbed member of the
audience may have found
stretches of the evening tire
some, especially in the
drawn-out solos of Recesses
and the somewhat monoton
ous sections of V.C.0., where
one watched a wrist or an ankle
go flip-flop-flip. But the dan
cers clear ability to work for
and draw from within them
selves, together with an intelli
gent collaboration held to
gether and inspired by
Lewitzky, produced an even
ing that won't let those who
were there ever think of dance
as just a lot of jumping around.

whole company. In V.C.0.,
Bella, in a convention-breaking

twist, gives her dancers control
over the music. Two dancers,
"transmitters," are wired so
that movement of certain joints
is transmitted into the squeaks,
buzzes and slides of a synth

Because of the transmitters'
contraptions, unwired "mov

the particular joint wired, and

Though dancers have worn
bells and bangles for millennia,
V.C.O. is a first attempt to con

Lewitzky has a great deal of
respect for her dancers as indi

partners. Unlike other dance
mentors, she does not see the
dancers of her company as in

can transmit her ideas.
Recesses developed from

her acute observations of three
of her dancers — Sean Greene,
Loretta Livingston and Iris Pell.
It is an attempt to capture their
approaches to dance and both
Lewitzky's and their percep

Recesses grabs at the trans

considered this transience
precious and lets it have its
way. It is about and can only be
performed by three particular
individuals, and every perfor

dancers.
The company generally does
not "play up" to its audience,
(with the exception of Sean's
very magnetic solo in Recesses
and Jennifer Hubbert, who
kept an amazingly wicked
smile while playing with and
rearranging the wires of her
rather ridiculous radio in
V.C.O. All the fun of Pas de

Bach was in the underplayed,
almost respectful way it poked
fun at the courtly ways of fash
ionable 17th-century ladies
and gentlemen and the tradi
tions of classicJ dance—of
dueling gentlemen, of little
ladies carried around by pr
incely beaus, and of faces
quietly horrified by social im
proprieties. The company
wore flesh colored leotard and
tights dotted with metallic
roses designed by Gernreich,
the men wearing priceless
aluminum perukes, complete
with beaver-tail ponytails, the
women with aluminum
corkscrews about the face.
The Lewitzky style makes
much of a loose and easy
strength, of blending and
complementary movement,
rather than crispness and
smooth execution. There is an
attempt to take away the flash
of even the most complex and

choreographed movements
and give them an air of natural
ness.
The dancers often seem ab
sorbed and pondering, forget
ful of their audience.
The company's inwardly fo
cused character is both its
strength and its weakness. A
less-absorbed member of the
audience may have found
stretches of the evening tire
some, especially in the
drawn-out solos of Recesses
and the somewhat monoton
ous sections of V.C.0., where
one watched a wrist or an ankle
go flip-flop-flip. But the dan
cers clear ability to work for
and draw from within them
selves, together with an intelli
gent collaboration held to
gether and inspired by
Lewitzky, produced an even
ing that won't let those who
were there ever think of dance
as just a lot of jumping around.

Memorial Auditorium saw
the products of creative, intel
ligent and inventive bodies and
minds last weekend when the
Bella Lewitzky Company gave a
performance for the Lively
Arts.
The Los Angeles-based
troupe has attracted much at
tention in recent years, Ms.
Lewitzky receiving the Dance
Magazine award this year. The
group has been noted for its
"western" (versus New York)
freshness and innovation
in costume and set design as
well as in movement. The
company probably is best
known to the layman for its
bold costumes by Rudi Ger
nreich, designer of the topless
bathing suit.
Three pieces were pre
sented: V.C.O. (Voltage Con
trolled Oscillator) danced by
the company, Recesses, con
sisting of three solos, and Pas
de Bach, also performed by the
whole company. In V.C.0.,
Bella, in a convention-breaking

twist, gives her dancers control
over the music. Two dancers,
"transmitters," are wired so
that movement of certain joints
is transmitted into the squeaks,
buzzes and slides of a synth
esizer via shortwave radio.
