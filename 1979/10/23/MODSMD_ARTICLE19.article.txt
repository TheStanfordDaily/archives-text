# '20th Century': Flash, puff, bang
## 
### 
Rock can't sing.
Judy Kaye can.
Robin Wagner's set deserves
to share top billing.
That's the story of On the
Twentieth Century, the
Broadway musical recreated by
the Civil Light Opera in a gran
diose but empty, dazzlingly
designed but technically
flawed production.
The show is nothing but
production numbers strung
together on the magnificent

Twentieth Century Limited,
the '30s express from Chicago
to New York which carried
mostly those too rich or fam
ous to care where they were
going.
The ride was all the fun, an
idea played up by composer Cy
Coleman and librettists/
lyricists Betty Comden and
Adolph Green.
They've made a goof-spoof
of the Hecht-MacArthur com
edy about a down-on-his-luck

stage producer (Hudson) who
tries to lure his old flame/
now-glamorous-starlet (Kaye)
into signing the contract that
will revive his career.
His efforts are aided by a
wacky philanthropist (Im
ogene Coca) but fought by
Kaye's rubber-band beau, (Pat
rick Quinn), who spends most
of his time bouncing off the
floor.
Coca's mugging and Quinn's
acrobatics win applause be

cause they don't depend on
the Orpheum's sound system.
The microphones keep buz
zing and going dead which
doesn't do much for the rest of
the cast, which manages to pull
off its scenes with sheer de
termination.
)udy Kaye doesn't need any
thing but her big beautiful
voice, however, and she
dominates the show. She can
handle Coleman's difficult
range jumps easily and she has
a tough-nut bravura that stands
up even through the limpid
plot.
She lacks the sophistication
of a movie queen, though, a
deficit that emerges most
clearly when she's onstage
with Hudson.
He can't carry a tune, hold a
note or keep a beat, but he has
a leading-man's cut and a con
genial self-assurance that says,
"What the heck? I'm here to
have fun."
The Coleman score is
pseudo-operatic: it ranges
from madrigals to typical bal
lads to a theme, which plays off
a seven-note pattern with lots
of verve and puffing steam.
The songs are usual Tin Pan
stuff, except for a few that dis
play a self-conscious attention
to lyrics. But they are so cram
med full of lines that they
sound witty enough, unless
you catch all the words.
Wagner's version of the
Twentieth Century Limited
glides and glares (its headlight
does, anyway) and glistens so
that you can't help, as the Vari
ety critic says, "whistling the
scenery" when you leave.
The whole show, with cos
tumes by Florence Klotz and
Harold Prince's usual
swashbuckling direction, is a
feast for the eyes.
And, if you've got nowhere
to go and nothing important to
do, it's worth taking a ride.
