# Trustees revamp committee system
## 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
An attempt to improve the effi
ciency of the Board of Trustees has
led to a reorganization of the board
committee system and a reduction in
the number of board meetings each
year.
At its meeting earlier this month,
the board approved a new set of by
laws which include the reorganiza
tion details. The new rules have al
ready been implemented.
Under the new system, the board
will meet six times a year, a decrease
from the former nine annual ses
sions.
Also, trustees have eliminated the
Lands and Buildings Committee and
transferred its function to the new
Finance and Administration Commit
tee. The latter replaces the old Fi
nance and Development Committee
with its fundraising effort now under
the auspices of the Academic Affairs
and Development Committee.
According to Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president for public affairs, the
new system more closely parallels
the structure of the University ad
ministration. Futherniore, the elimi
nation of one committee is expected
to alleviate some meeting scheduling
problems.
Rosenzweig said the administra
tion groups both lands and buildings
activities as well as finance activities
into the Office of the Vice President
for Business and Finance.
In the past, the Finance and De

velopment Committee had been
scheduled to meet at the same time
as the Lands and Buildings Commit
tee. Since the business and finance
vice president oversees both opera
tions, he was needed in two places at
once, causing problems from time to
time.
Rosenzweig said moving fundrais
ing to the Academic Affairs and De
velopment Committee, which is
headed by its own vice president,
recognizes the more 'logical con
nection between fundraising ac
tivities and spending for academic
programs than between fundraising
and finance."
In addition, the membership of the
Academic Affairs and Development
Committee will be reduced in size.
Formerly, Academic Affairs included
the entire board, making for a
"somewhat artificial" committee,
Rosenzweig said. Overlap in com
mittee assignments between Finance
and Administration and Academic
Affairs and Development has now
been eliminated.
The first real "concentrated dose"
of board business will come at its
next meeting in December, accord
ing to Rosenzweig.
At that time, the board traditionally
sets tuition and room and board rates
for the following year.
The administration will also prob
ably then present for approval the
academic program for a newBoo-unit
student residence to be built west of
Lagunita Court.
