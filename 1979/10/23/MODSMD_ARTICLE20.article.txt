# Dark tiles in musical mosaic shine in new Eagles album
## 
### 
The Long Run
The Eagles
Elektra Asylum
Go stand in the Quad and take a look around
you. All those towers of learning, of vanity, of
boredom. All that sandstone and red tile.
You should be impressed, of course. The Uni
versity puts on this whole show for you, right?
But, when I stand in the middle of what my
parents' money is paying for, a few other emo
tions always try to force themselves upon me.
Vague ones. Fear, maybe. Or intimidation. The
feeling that I've been trapped by my good for
tune. Those buildings may be large, but the
world they define can seem terribly narrow.
The Eagles are the chroniclers par excellence
of the American Southwest in the 19705. Since
On the Border, they have been building up a
devastating mosaic of the lives led by actual and
aspiring beautiful people. The Long Run, their
new album, adds more dark tiles; it may sound
happier than Hotel California, but that only
serves to make the message more insidious. The
world the Eagles sing about is a narrow one, too;
everyone in it is trapped, in one way or another;
and if you, like I, feel that something is missing
from our best of all possible worlds, then you'll
identify with how the Eagles feel about theirs.
Because their world is what they condemn so
well. Don Henley and Glenn Frey are beautiful
people; they live on cliffs, snort coke and mean
ingfully relate to Stevie Nicks. And we all know
that )oe Walsh drives a Maserati, when he has a
valid driver's license.

The album sounds slightly homogenized. Ev
erything is smooth, palatable; |oe Walsh's guitar
has been toned down; there's even a David
Sanborn sax solo. On the surface, the sound is
hard to distinguish from recent Carly Simon, or
Linda Ronstadt, or Jackson Browne. Or any
other Elektra Asylum clone.
But the Eagles are a bit more tough-minded
than that. And whatever you think they may be
lacking, there is one thing they undoubtedly
have — intelligence. Their music has never been
angry; they prefer more refined emotions, such
as disgust or weariness. Elektra's pablumized
style, while it ignores their considerable talents
as a straight-ahead rock band, adds a nice touch
of irony to their statements.
Getting down to cases — while there are no
instant classics here, nothing in the vein of "De
sperado"' or "Lyin' Eyes" or "Hotel California"
there are no duds, either. Timothy Schmidt, late
of Poco, who has replaced Randy Meisner bass,
contributes "I Can't Tell You Why," a bit
tersweet lament that is perhaps the album's best
song. Henley and Frey prove themselves again
to be the best song-writing team around; their
images of desolation, of end-of-line loneliness,
are as potent as they've ever been.
The Eagles don't claim to know any more
about where we're going or where we should go
than anyone else. But as The Long Run de
monstrates once again, they know an awful lot
about the places we should stay out of.
