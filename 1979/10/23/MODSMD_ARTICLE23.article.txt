# Bertolucci on Bertolucci 'growing up'
## 
### 
There were those in the audience in
the Palace of Fine Arts who wondered
whether Italian director Bernardo Ber
tolucci had conformed. If they came to
the San Francisco Film Festival to see
the Marxist, cinematic innovator who
•directed The Conformist, they were
disappointed. He's changed — he's
grown and matured.
After a short press conference last
week excerpts from his films were
shown, among them The Partner (Based
bn a story by Dostoevski), Last Tango,
the epic 1900 (From the four-hour, 10-
minute version), Luna, his latest film,
and an entire screening of The Confor
mist.
The director revealed a new intros
pection about his work, a more cauti
'ous tone. His maturity was shown in
both the progression of his work and in
his commentary. He was ready to de
lend himself and his movie.
"Some people have criticized me
about the eroticism in Last Tango," he
said, "and they say that patrons are
coming to see my films for the wrong
reasons. I reply that I don't care what
they feel when Ihey come in, but what
they feel when they leave the theater."
Bertolucci was a prize-winning poet
who turned to the cinema. No doubt
influenced by his father, a film critic in
Parma, Bernardo made his first feature
film, The Grim Reaper, when he was 21.

His work is characterized by a struggle
between his Marxism and his romanti
cism.
The audience seemed as interested
in Last Tango, released in 1973, as they
did in Luna. The director got a smatter
ing of applause and laughter when he
said, "I'm a very innocent person. I
don't know if you believe me. When I
saw Last Tango in its final version I
didn't think anyone would go see it. It
was too depressing. I didn't realize it
would have the impact it did."
Bertolucci looked and sounded like
an avant-garde European director. He
was wearing a harid-painted tie, Nike
sneakers and a baggy, wrinkled coat.
He spoke of people whose names in
spire a sense of magic: Bobby DeNiro,
Marlon and Pier Paolo.
"Marlon pretends to have a poor
memory, like he can't remember long
dialogues," Bertolucci said. "Actually,
he uses this pretense so he can recon
struct the dialogue as he goes along."
His early film experience was with
one of the greatest Italian directors.
"When I worked with Pier Paolo Paso
lini, it was like he created cinema every
day on the set," he said. "Pasolini
showed me that cinema is the true poe
tic language. It's much closer to poetry
than to theater."
Bertolucci was asked many questions
about the controversial 190() over which

he had a much publicized, protracted
dispute with producer Alberto
Grimaldi. The director was disarmingly
frank: "That film was made during my
megalomaniacal phase."
The film, 1900, celebrates the rise of
the communist movement among the
peasants and their ordeal under the
capitalist landowners and fascists, but
that was not what created the con
troversy. Bertolucci went $5 million
over budget, and his first version had a
running time of five hours, 10 minutes
One of the American directors he
admires is Francis Ford Coppola. "I
think Coppola's Apocalypse Now is
very audacious. He tried to do some
thing different. That's necessary in this
business, but risky."
He is worried about the fate of Luna,
which his brother helped him write. It
features Jill Clayburgh, whom many
remember for her role Unmarried
Woman, and Matthew Barry as her son.
"Luna is going to have a hard time in
this country," Bertolucci said. "It's not
afraid to show emotion. It's the most
experimental of the films I've done in
the last 10 years. In it I'm attempting to
deal with the incoherency of life."
The film already has received criti
cism because it deals with incest, but
Bertolucci found the reaction strange in
a country, which he said "has the

greatest rate of incest in the world." It is
his first totally English-speaking film.
Luna has become an important pro
ject for the director. It illustrates a
dramatic shift in his artistic objectives.
"In 1968, we thought the camera was a
machine gun," he said. "You can't in
fluence public opinion with such a gun,
but it's still an important thing to make a
movie.
"I found a kind of freedom in Luna
about expressing emotions," Ber
tolucci said. "I realized that as a camera
moves along the dolly track, it moves
toward the object of love. The camera is
like a baby coming toward its parents.
"Luna, which is about incest, will be
censored by a puritanical audience, not
to mention the critics," he said. Refer
ring to the censorship imposed on his
earlier films, he said, "In editing, it's
better to change the style ol a film than
the content."
He had much advice for American di
rectors. "When you make a movie, the
only tense you can use is the present,"
he said. "Cinema is always cinema ver
ite."
He exhorted the audience to be ter
rified of rules. He applied it to art as
well as to life. "Making a movie is going
in search of the secrets of the people in
front of the camera."
