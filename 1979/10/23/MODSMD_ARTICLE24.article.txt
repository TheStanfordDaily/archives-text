# A 						tribute to Sir Alec
## 
### 
"Sir Alec, Sir Alec," a voice
cries out from the crowd, "Are
you planning to do another
film?" The dignified man on
the stage answers elegantly.
"I'm totally out of work."
"Who is Sir Alec?" I hear
people ask, "and why is he out
of work?"
Sir Alec Guinness is one of
the greatest actors to appear
on the screen. He is out of
work because many people
don't know who he is.
"Oh yeah," I heard someone
say, "isn't he Obi-Wan
Kenobi?" No he is not Obi-
Wan Kenobi; he played Obi-
Wan Kenobi in a movie, cer
tainly not his best perfor
mance.
"Well, if he's so great, why
haven't I seen him before?" To
this I can only say that you
probably have. He has played
the young chemist in The Man
in the White Suit, the blind
butler, "Benson-mum" in
Murder by Death, Hitler in The

Last Ten Days of Hitler, the cap
tured British colonel in The
Bridge on the River Kwai, the
pope in Brother Sun, Sister
Moon, and eight roles in Kind
Hearts and Cornets.
"How could one person play
so many different roles?" Sir
Alec Guinness not only could
play them, he did. And that is
why the 23rd annual San Fran
cisco International Film Festi
val opened with a tribute to
him.
The tribute began with a
press conference. Clips from
17 films were shown, after
which the actor appeared on
stage to answer questions.
"Sir Alec," a young boy cried
out. "I want you to know that I
saw Star Wars 102 times, and it
would mean a lot to me if I
could have your autograph."
In his earlier years, Sir Alec
became known for his tre
mendous performances in
comedies.
He was asked where he de
veloped the very visual style
that he used in these com
edies. "I'm not very aware of
it,"he said. "I am aware I have
many regrettable idiosyn
crasies."
As for which roles are har
dest to play, he said that all
roles are hard, but that comedy
is the hardest. "I try and take
comedy very seriously indeed,
while something of a serious
nature makes me break up hys
terically."
When asked if he has aban
doned comedies, he said "I
don't think I've abandoned any
work that has come my way."
"Sir Alec, have you ever had
trouble disentangling yourself
from your roles?"
"I've always disentangled
immediately, as soon as I took
off my wig."
Someone asked if he thought
of doing a musical. (I guess this
comes up because o! a warm,
kind personality that could be
likened to Fred Astaire's.) "I
don't sing or dance," he said.
Sir Alec said he wanted to act
since he was 7 years old.
"At 15,1 realized that you could
earn a living (being an actor)."
He later went to drama school
on a scholarship, but dropped
out after eight months since he
felt it was important for him to
go out and make a living.
"All roles are challenging,
the danger lies when you think
they are not challenging," he

said. If someone asked was h
or wasn't he an actor, "I'd sa
see Tunes of Glory."
"Are there great roles yo
would like to play that you ha
ven't already?" Sir Alec said
"I'm too old for most of them.'
He added that he would like t(
play lago in Othello.
He said that if he had no
been an actor he would like tc
have been a writer. He ha;
done some writing, but con
siders himself "only ar
amateur." Most notably, ht
wrote a screenplay called The
Horse's Mouth.
A man in the audience askec
if Sir Alec could explain what il
was like to be knighted. "I
could, but I don't know if I
know you well enough.
"They tell you what to do,
I'm an actor and I can do that,"
he explained.
He added that when he was
kneeling before the Queen,
"someone gave her a sword
and I thought she was going to
cut off both my ears." He
said that she then "whipped
down the sword on both
shoulders. After I walked
backwards, some flunky stand
ing in the back said, 'I suspect
you'll run to the men's room,
they all do.' "
Sir Alec Guinness has never
developed a character that fol
lows him around in each film.
Instead he is a character actor,
and molds himself into each
role he gets. As a result, you
may not even realize who he is
when you see him, and that is a
great compliment to an actor.
Unfortunately, this does not
lead to being well known, so
Sir Alec must wait his turn to
appear on the screen, despite
an almost endless list of ac
complishments. May the force
be with him.

Sir Alec Guinness is one of
the greatest actors to appear
on the screen. He is out of
work because many people
don't know who he is.
"Oh yeah," I heard someone
say, "isn't he Obi-Wan
Kenobi?" No he is not Obi-
Wan Kenobi; he played Obi-
Wan Kenobi in a movie, cer
tainly not his best perfor
mance.
"Well, if he's so great, why
haven't I seen him before?" To
this I can only say that you
probably have. He has played
the young chemist in The Man
in the White Suit, the blind
butler, "Benson-mum" in
Murder by Death, Hitler in The

Last Ten Days of Hitler, the cap
tured British colonel in The
Bridge on the River Kwai, the
pope in Brother Sun, Sister
Moon, and eight roles in Kind
Hearts and Cornets.
"How could one person play
so many different roles?" Sir
Alec Guinness not only could
play them, he did. And that is
why the 23rd annual San Fran
cisco International Film Festi
val opened with a tribute to
him.
The tribute began with a
press conference. Clips from
17 films were shown, after
which the actor appeared on
stage to answer questions.
"Sir Alec," a young boy cried
out. "I want you to know that I
saw Star Wars 102 times, and it
would mean a lot to me if I
could have your autograph."
In his earlier years, Sir Alec
became known for his tre
mendous performances in
comedies.
He was asked where he de
veloped the very visual style
that he used in these com
edies. "I'm not very aware of
it,"he said. "I am aware I have
many regrettable idiosyn
crasies."
As for which roles are har
dest to play, he said that all
roles are hard, but that comedy
is the hardest. "I try and take
comedy very seriously indeed,
while something of a serious
nature makes me break up hys
terically."
When asked if he has aban
doned comedies, he said "I
don't think I've abandoned any
work that has come my way."
"Sir Alec, have you ever had
trouble disentangling yourself
from your roles?"
"I've always disentangled
immediately, as soon as I took
off my wig."
Someone asked if he thought
of doing a musical. (I guess this
comes up because o! a warm,
kind personality that could be
likened to Fred Astaire's.) "I
don't sing or dance," he said.
Sir Alec said he wanted to act
since he was 7 years old.
"At 15,1 realized that you could
earn a living (being an actor)."
He later went to drama school
on a scholarship, but dropped
out after eight months since he
felt it was important for him to
go out and make a living.
"All roles are challenging,
the danger lies when you think
they are not challenging," he

said. If someone asked was h
or wasn't he an actor, "I'd sa
see Tunes of Glory."
"Are there great roles yo
would like to play that you ha
ven't already?" Sir Alec said
"I'm too old for most of them.'
He added that he would like t(
play lago in Othello.
He said that if he had no
been an actor he would like tc
have been a writer. He ha;
done some writing, but con
siders himself "only ar
amateur." Most notably, ht
wrote a screenplay called The
Horse's Mouth.
A man in the audience askec
if Sir Alec could explain what il
was like to be knighted. "I
could, but I don't know if I
know you well enough.
"They tell you what to do,
I'm an actor and I can do that,"
he explained.
He added that when he was
kneeling before the Queen,
"someone gave her a sword
and I thought she was going to
cut off both my ears." He
said that she then "whipped
down the sword on both
shoulders. After I walked
backwards, some flunky stand
ing in the back said, 'I suspect
you'll run to the men's room,
they all do.' "
Sir Alec Guinness has never
developed a character that fol
lows him around in each film.
Instead he is a character actor,
and molds himself into each
role he gets. As a result, you
may not even realize who he is
when you see him, and that is a
great compliment to an actor.
Unfortunately, this does not
lead to being well known, so
Sir Alec must wait his turn to
appear on the screen, despite
an almost endless list of ac
complishments. May the force
be with him.

"Sir Alec, Sir Alec," a voice
cries out from the crowd, "Are
you planning to do another
film?" The dignified man on
the stage answers elegantly.
"I'm totally out of work."
