Erich von Stroheim — even
his name suggests officious
Germanic captains and tem
peramental FHollywood direc
tors. Von Stroheim — the mad
genius whose budgets could
make Coppola look like an
amateur; the brilliant director
who, exiled from Hollywood,
became an actor in such great
films as Grand Illusion and Sun
set Boulevard.
This documentary of the life
and work of von Stroheim does
little to change those myths.
The Man You Loved to Hate
skips from one movie to the
next, and remains a survey
course of von Stroheim more
than anything else. We have no
sense of the tragedy of his life,
that he, as well as Orson Wel
les, started at the top and
worked his way to the bottom.
Filmmaker Patrick Montgom
ery provides no insight into
von Stroheim, save for those
that emerge from the inter

views: "He was a gifted yet
frustrated director." Who
opee.
The structure of The Man
You Loved to Hate is standard
National Film Board even
though this is an American
production. The film begins
with a piece on his early career
and then flashes back to his
childhood. After more career
information, there is another
piece on his early years that
takes us to the point from
where the movie began. From
there it goes downhill.
Not that the documentary is
not enjoyable. It is. But it is
rather unambitious. Its super
ficial treatment of such a rich
human being tends to make
one think that it was made for
the TV market. The narrator
tells us that von Stroheim was
fascinated with the Hapsburg
military, but we have no sense
of that fascination. There are
themes, we are told, that ob

sessed him. But here again,
there is not enough follow
through. In a nutshell, the
movie is half-baked.
Montgomery wants his cake
and his pie, and he wants toeat
them both. But in Vh hours,
this is difficult. If the Hol
lywood studios did von
Stroheim a disservice by ab
ridging his films, Montgomery
performs a similar one to von
Stroheim's memory.
The filmgoer looking for a
rather nostalgic documentary
of a bygone Hollywood, and of
a director-writer-actor whose
hamartia are spelled out for
him, may find this is a film for
him. If he wants rendered the
complexities of this tragic,
creative genius, he should also
go. Where else can you see
great clips from von Stroheim's
films? They outclass The Man
You Loved To Hate. •
