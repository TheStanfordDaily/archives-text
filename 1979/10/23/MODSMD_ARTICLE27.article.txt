# Two films by Cuba's Alea
## A 						humanist with a political conscience 
### 
Twenty years ago there was
no Cuban cinema. Today, this
small island is producing eight
films a year. Thomas Cuttierez
Alea is one of the country's
most talented filmmakers. His
films are poignant criticisms of
bourgeois values in the style of
Luis Bunuel, the Spanish direc
tor. He is best known in this
country for his Memories of
Underdevelopment.
Alea's films are not what
most Americans would expect;
they are not crude prop
aganda. Instead they show a
depth of vision and insight of
someone with strong humanist
convictions. In his films Alea
attacks not only the values of
the old colonial past but also
the injustices of the new.
Aleas's latest film The Sur
vivors was shown at the film
festival last week with The Last
Supper, which was shown at an
afternoon discussion with
Alea.
Questions centered on the
topic people would like to
know most about, censorship.
The impressive thing about
Cuban cinema is that it offers
so much criticism. Censorship
in Cuba is self-imposed. Unlike

in the Soviet Union, there is no
bureaucratic apparatus to
watch over the artist. You can
not make an openly "counter
revolutionary" film, but there
seems to be a highly developed
political sense and content in
Cuban cinema perhaps be
cause of the high degree of
political awareness and, of
course, the fact that the box
office is not an important factor
as in all Socialist countries.
Alea and his colleague, Jorge
Fraga, argued that since Cuban
filmmakers all come from the
same political and philosophi
cal way of thinking disagree
ments rarely occur.
In his film Death of a
Bureaucrat, • Alea openly
criticized red tape in the cur
rent regime in a comedy about
a man who has trouble rebury
ing his sister, dug up by mis
take, because he has no exhu
mation permit. Even in Sur
vivors there is a subtle criticism
of those who strive to profit
under any regime.
Survivors deals with the dis
integration of the Orozco fam
ily, rich landowners and aris
tocrats.
"The picture is about the
survival of bourgeois values in
the midst of the revolution,"
Alea said. This has been his
major theme. "To those living
outside the revolution this may
be hard to understand," Alea
said.
In Survivors, the 400-year-old
Orozco clan decides to dig in
when the revolution comes.
They believe that the Ameri
cans will arrive soon and re
store "law and order." They
stock themselves with provi
sions and ammunition and bolt

the huge gates to their estate.
At first their spirits are high.
Life goes on as if nothing had
happened with cocktail par
ties, croquet, weddings and
anniversaries. Even the ser
vants are lured into staying.ln
side, there is the land of plenty,
while outside there is rationing
and economic hardship.
As the provisions run out
and the end of the revolution is
nowhere near, some servants,
even the priest, decide to
leave.
"How will I get into heaven
now," asks the distressed
grandfather as he is bidding
goodbye to the priest. "Son,
don't worry," replies the
priest, "one year of the revolu
tion is worth a thousand in
purgatory."
The servants plan a revolt.
The Orozco family has to act
quickly. Overnight the
grounds are turned into a plan
tation. Rusty old chains, once
relics, are put to work as are
whips and dogs.
Years later, the servants are
gone. The Orozco family is
alone in a mansion that collects
dust and moths. They all
realize that they have to work
in order to survive.
"No work. No food," says
the son.
"I knew it," laments another
member of the family, "that
these communist ideas would
infiltrate us someday."
Life is not easy. A woman
commits suicide rather than
work and when the family's
appetites are whetted by the
sight of a black cat, the family
goes on a hunt up and down
the great staircases and rooms
complete with red hunting jac

kets, bugles and dogs.
The film is not a portrayal of
the life of a bourgeois family in
revolutionary Cuba, but an al
legory, a dissection of
bourgeois mentality.
"The family goes backwards
in history," Alea said. They end
up feeding on roots and leaves
in the garden and finally even
on mother."
To appreciate Alea's second
film, The Last Supper, fully one
would have to be brought up in
the Latin American Catholic
tradition.
Based on a historical inci
dent, the film recreates an Eas
ter Holy Week on a sugar plan
tation near Havana toward the
end of the 18th century.
During this period Cuba be
came the world's foremost
sugar producer after a success
ful slave revolt in Haiti.
The pious plantation owner,
the count of Havana, is a very
religious man. He decides to
perform an act of spiritual
goodness to ease his consci
ence. He has 12 slaves chosen
and washes and kisses their
feet as Christ did to his disci
ples and invites them to a gar
gantuan feast at his table in a
reenactment of the Last Sup
per.
It is to them that he tries to
explain how Christ had to be
sacrificed for man's sins.
Someone has to suffer. In this
case it is the slaves, but for the
time being the count takes on
all guilt.
He recounts an episode in
the life of St. Francis of Assisi
who was questioned on what
the greatest happiness is. It is
not to be found in learning, not
in material wealth or comfort,

the moral goes, but in suffering
for the Lord. At this point the
count breaks out in sobs of
emotion
The wine begins to work on
the count and he finds himself
at ease with his slaves. They are
transformed from slaves into
men, "Things are looking good
now," sings one. The count
even speaks ill of the ruthless
mulatto overseer.
The count promises a holi
day on Good Friday but instead
the overseer forces all to work.
Thinking that this injustice will
be corrected by the count the
overseer is captured in a revolt.
The count sees this as a direct
threat to his authority and
ruthlessly supresses it. The
heads of all but one of the 12
slaves are hung on poles as
examples.
The Last Supper is perhaps a
little long and its final minutes
perhaps a little banal, the story
of the one slave that managed
to escape to freedom. What
makes this film worth seeing is
the study in hypocrisy and guilt
instilled in such pious men bya
Christianity that had to justify a
world contrary to its teachings.
Also, some beautiful photo
graphy makes the film look like
a Rembrandt.
Alea is perhaps nowhere as
subtle or as consistently
humorous in his satire as
Bunuel, but his films are a re
markable achievement for a
country so small without a trad
ition of filmmakers.
Perhaps his films will help in
breaking the kind of
stereotype in which Cuban cul
ture has been put and does not
deserve.

sions and ammunition and bolt

the huge gates to their estate.
At first their spirits are high.
Life goes on as if nothing had
happened with cocktail par
ties, croquet, weddings and
anniversaries. Even the ser
vants are lured into staying.ln
side, there is the land of plenty,
while outside there is rationing
and economic hardship.
As the provisions run out
and the end of the revolution is
nowhere near, some servants,
even the priest, decide to
leave.
"How will I get into heaven
now," asks the distressed
grandfather as he is bidding
goodbye to the priest. "Son,
don't worry," replies the
priest, "one year of the revolu
tion is worth a thousand in
purgatory."
The servants plan a revolt.
The Orozco family has to act
quickly. Overnight the
grounds are turned into a plan
tation. Rusty old chains, once
relics, are put to work as are
whips and dogs.
Years later, the servants are
gone. The Orozco family is
alone in a mansion that collects
dust and moths. They all
realize that they have to work
in order to survive.
"No work. No food," says
the son.
"I knew it," laments another
member of the family, "that
these communist ideas would
infiltrate us someday."
Life is not easy. A woman
commits suicide rather than
work and when the family's
appetites are whetted by the
sight of a black cat, the family
goes on a hunt up and down
the great staircases and rooms
complete with red hunting jac

kets, bugles and dogs.
The film is not a portrayal of
the life of a bourgeois family in
revolutionary Cuba, but an al
legory, a dissection of
bourgeois mentality.
"The family goes backwards
in history," Alea said. They end
up feeding on roots and leaves
in the garden and finally even
on mother."
To appreciate Alea's second
film, The Last Supper, fully one
would have to be brought up in
the Latin American Catholic
tradition.
Based on a historical inci
dent, the film recreates an Eas
ter Holy Week on a sugar plan
tation near Havana toward the
end of the 18th century.
During this period Cuba be
came the world's foremost
sugar producer after a success
ful slave revolt in Haiti.
The pious plantation owner,
the count of Havana, is a very
religious man. He decides to
perform an act of spiritual
goodness to ease his consci
ence. He has 12 slaves chosen
and washes and kisses their
feet as Christ did to his disci
ples and invites them to a gar
gantuan feast at his table in a
reenactment of the Last Sup
per.
It is to them that he tries to
explain how Christ had to be
sacrificed for man's sins.
Someone has to suffer. In this
case it is the slaves, but for the
time being the count takes on
all guilt.
He recounts an episode in
the life of St. Francis of Assisi
who was questioned on what
the greatest happiness is. It is
not to be found in learning, not
in material wealth or comfort,

the moral goes, but in suffering
for the Lord. At this point the
count breaks out in sobs of
emotion
The wine begins to work on
the count and he finds himself
at ease with his slaves. They are
transformed from slaves into
men, "Things are looking good
now," sings one. The count
even speaks ill of the ruthless
mulatto overseer.
The count promises a holi
day on Good Friday but instead
the overseer forces all to work.
Thinking that this injustice will
be corrected by the count the
overseer is captured in a revolt.
The count sees this as a direct
threat to his authority and
ruthlessly supresses it. The
heads of all but one of the 12
slaves are hung on poles as
examples.
The Last Supper is perhaps a
little long and its final minutes
perhaps a little banal, the story
of the one slave that managed
to escape to freedom. What
makes this film worth seeing is
the study in hypocrisy and guilt
instilled in such pious men bya
Christianity that had to justify a
world contrary to its teachings.
Also, some beautiful photo
graphy makes the film look like
a Rembrandt.
Alea is perhaps nowhere as
subtle or as consistently
humorous in his satire as
Bunuel, but his films are a re
markable achievement for a
country so small without a trad
ition of filmmakers.
Perhaps his films will help in
breaking the kind of
stereotype in which Cuban cul
ture has been put and does not
deserve.

Twenty years ago there was
no Cuban cinema. Today, this
small island is producing eight
films a year. Thomas Cuttierez
Alea is one of the country's
most talented filmmakers. His
films are poignant criticisms of
bourgeois values in the style of
Luis Bunuel, the Spanish direc
tor. He is best known in this
country for his Memories of
Underdevelopment.
Alea's films are not what
most Americans would expect;
they are not crude prop
aganda. Instead they show a
depth of vision and insight of
someone with strong humanist
convictions. In his films Alea
attacks not only the values of
the old colonial past but also
the injustices of the new.
Aleas's latest film The Sur
vivors was shown at the film
festival last week with The Last
Supper, which was shown at an
afternoon discussion with
Alea.
Questions centered on the
topic people would like to
know most about, censorship.
The impressive thing about
Cuban cinema is that it offers
so much criticism. Censorship
in Cuba is self-imposed. Unlike

in the Soviet Union, there is no
bureaucratic apparatus to
watch over the artist. You can
not make an openly "counter
revolutionary" film, but there
seems to be a highly developed
political sense and content in
Cuban cinema perhaps be
cause of the high degree of
political awareness and, of
course, the fact that the box
office is not an important factor
as in all Socialist countries.
Alea and his colleague, Jorge
Fraga, argued that since Cuban
filmmakers all come from the
same political and philosophi
cal way of thinking disagree
ments rarely occur.
In his film Death of a
Bureaucrat, • Alea openly
criticized red tape in the cur
rent regime in a comedy about
a man who has trouble rebury
ing his sister, dug up by mis
take, because he has no exhu
mation permit. Even in Sur
vivors there is a subtle criticism
of those who strive to profit
under any regime.
Survivors deals with the dis
integration of the Orozco fam
ily, rich landowners and aris
tocrats.
"The picture is about the
survival of bourgeois values in
the midst of the revolution,"
Alea said. This has been his
major theme. "To those living
outside the revolution this may
be hard to understand," Alea
said.

ples and invites them to a gar
gantuan feast at his table in a
reenactment of the Last Sup
per.
It is to them that he tries to
explain how Christ had to be
sacrificed for man's sins.
Someone has to suffer. In this
case it is the slaves, but for the
time being the count takes on
all guilt.
He recounts an episode in
the life of St. Francis of Assisi
who was questioned on what
the greatest happiness is. It is
not to be found in learning, not
in material wealth or comfort,

the moral goes, but in suffering
for the Lord. At this point the
count breaks out in sobs of
emotion
The wine begins to work on
the count and he finds himself
at ease with his slaves. They are
transformed from slaves into
men, "Things are looking good
now," sings one. The count
even speaks ill of the ruthless
mulatto overseer.
The count promises a holi
day on Good Friday but instead
the overseer forces all to work.
Thinking that this injustice will
be corrected by the count the
overseer is captured in a revolt.
The count sees this as a direct
threat to his authority and
ruthlessly supresses it. The
heads of all but one of the 12
slaves are hung on poles as
examples.
The Last Supper is perhaps a
little long and its final minutes
perhaps a little banal, the story
of the one slave that managed
to escape to freedom. What
makes this film worth seeing is
the study in hypocrisy and guilt
instilled in such pious men bya
Christianity that had to justify a
world contrary to its teachings.
Also, some beautiful photo
graphy makes the film look like
a Rembrandt.
Alea is perhaps nowhere as
subtle or as consistently
humorous in his satire as
Bunuel, but his films are a re
markable achievement for a
country so small without a trad
ition of filmmakers.
Perhaps his films will help in
breaking the kind of
stereotype in which Cuban cul
ture has been put and does not
deserve.
