Strangler given six life terms
Los Angeles — Kenneth Bianchi, quiet and
calm, was sentenced to life in prison after
pleading guilty yesterday to five slayings in the
"Hillside Strangler" murders that terrorized
Southern California women for six months.
"I wish I had the power that it be ordered
that your sentence . . . run consecutively,"
Superior Court Judge William Keene told Bian
chi after imposing six concurrent life sen
tences.
Bianchi had quietly answered, "Yes, I did,"
as Deputy District Attorney Roger Kelly asked
him if he killed each of five victims in a string of
10 slayings from September 1977 through Feb
ruary 1978. He also pleaded guilty to one count
of conspiracy.
Bianchi's cousin, Angelo Buono, 45, of
Clendale, had his arraignment on 24 counts
c ontinued two weeks by Municipal judge Gab
riel Gutierrez. No plea was entered.
He will remain in custody without bail until
the preliminary hearing, now set for Nov. 5.
Kelly said it was unlikely that Bianchi would
ever be paroled, but noted, "No matter how
heinous the crime, everyone comes up for a
parole hearing."
Bianchi admitted he committed each of the
crimes "in conjunction with" Buono.
Buono was arrested Friday and charged with
the slayings just minutes after Bianchi entered
guilty pleas to strangling two Western
Washington University coeds.
Hiring suit filed against Sears
Washington — The federal government took
Sears Roebuck & Co. to court in five cities
yesterday on charges that the world's largest
retailer practiced illegal job discrimination
against women and minorities across the Un
ited States.
A nationwide suit filed in federal court in
Chicago accused Sears of job discrimination
against women in the 48 contiguous states in
violation of the Civil Rights and Equal Pay acts.
Four other suits filed simultaneously in New
York City, Atlanta, Montgomery, Ala., and
Memphis, Tenn., charged the retailer with dis
criminating against minorities in hiring at
seven facilities in those four areas.
The suits, brought by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, are among the
largest employment discrimination cases ever
launched by the government and likely will be

the biggest job bias suit to be fought in court.
Sears is one of the nation's largest
employers, with a workforce of 400,000 in all 50
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico.
The suits were filed more than six years after
the federal agency first accused Sears of racial
and sexual discrimination in its employment
practices.
The suit charged that federal policies, such
as veterans preference laws, created a work
force that is dominated by white males, thus
preventing employers from providing equal
job opportunities to women and minorities.
The suit was later dismissed by the trial judge
as being without merit.
According to Sears figures based on 1977
employment, 20 percent of the company's
employees are minorities. Among "officials
and managers," 10 percent are minorities and
36 percent are female.
Exxon's 3rd quarter profits up
New York — Exxon Corp., the world's largest
oil company, said yesterday its profits were up
118 percent for the third quarter.
"It was a good quarter," Ulysses LaGrange,
the company's comptroller, said of the $1.14
billion profit. He said, however, that most of
the company's profits were not reaped at the
expense of American motorists and homeow
ners but from big increases in earnings from
the company's overseas operations.
This year's third-quarter profits were the
biggest in Exxon's history and among the most
ever earned in a quarter by a U.S. company.
Exxon's sales in the quarter rose to $20.65 bill
ion from $15.9 billion.
LaGrange said the size of the difference be
tween this year's third quarter and last year's
third quarter was slightly misleading because
last year's third quarter results were the
poorest for the firm in five years.
PacTel plans to raise rates
San Francisco — Pacific Telephone Co. will
seek a rate increase "in the range of $400 mill
ion annually" to help finance a record $2.4
billion construction program for 1980, a com
pany executive disclosed yesterday.
L. Reed Waters, vice president for regulatory
matters, said an application to be filed with the
California Public Utilities Commission (PUC)
in about two weeks will demonstrate an inabil

ity to obtain required financing at current
rates.
The $2.4 billion would provide plant and
equipment for 550,000 new telephones, he
said, and the rate increase would help Pacific
Telephone realize its authorized 9.73 percent
rate of return and thus create a better climate
in the financial marketplace for bond offer
ings.
Waters' made his disclosure to Associated
Press while at a PUC hearing into how Pacific
will make refunds totaling $341 million — as of
August — and reduce rates by some $38 million
annually as ordered by the agency.
London Times back to presses
London — The venerable Times of London,
one of the world's most influential newspap
ers, won't be calling it an era after all.
A last-minute accord Sunday between man
agement and a printers' union saved the 194-
year-old paper, which is as much a mainstay of
Britain as cricket and the stiff upper lip.
Publication of the Times, the Sunday Times
and three weekly supplements had been sus
pended for lOV2 months in a showdown with
labor over manning, strikes and technology.
The Times management and the National
Graphical Association announced agreement
less than five hours before a deadline set by
the International Thomson Organization, the
Canadian-based parent firm 0! Times News
papers Ltd.
The company had threatened to fire 3700
print workers and effectively close the papers
if agreement was not reached by 4 p.m. Sun
day. It planned to keep some 450 journalists
and 150 executives on the payroll — for un
specified purposes.
Michael Mander, Times deputy chief execu
tive, said it might resume publishing this week,
but "we won't be giving our rivals advance
notice of when it will be."
Sunday Times Editor Harold Evans said he
did not expect the Times to be back in print
until Nov. 13 or Nov. 14 and the Sunday Times
by Nov. 11 to Nov. 18, depending on time
needed to prepare equipment.
The suspension, originally estimated to last
only three or four months, ended up costing
$56 million in lost revenue, the Times said.

Czech dissident trial begins
Prague, Czechoslovakia — Six human rights
activists went on trial under heavy police guard
yesterday and the wife of one of the dissidents
was arrested after taking notes in the cour
troom. A second woman was taken into cus
tody outside the court building, dissident
sources said.
All six defendents in the biggest Czechos
lovak political trial in seven years were accused
of being founding members of a group formed
in 1978 to aid other dissidents. Czechoslovak
authorities charge the group was illegal and
that its members aided U.S.-guided prop
aganda campaigns against the country. If con
victed, they could be jailed for 10 years.
Playwright Vaclav Havel, 43, and govern
ment critic Petr Uhl, 38, had still not entered
pleas, dissidents said, but three of the others
pleaded innocent.
Otta Bednarova, 54, a former journalist, de
clined to enter a plea or answer questions, as
she had during earlier questioning, dissidents
said.

Czech dissident trial begins
Prague, Czechoslovakia — Six human rights
activists went on trial under heavy police guard
yesterday and the wife of one of the dissidents
was arrested after taking notes in the cour

that its members aided U.S.-guided prop
aganda campaigns against the country. If con

Strangler given six life terms
Los Angeles — Kenneth Bianchi, quiet and
calm, was sentenced to life in prison after
pleading guilty yesterday to five slayings in the
"Hillside Strangler" murders that terrorized
Southern California women for six months.
"I wish I had the power that it be ordered
that your sentence . . . run consecutively,"
Superior Court Judge William Keene told Bian
chi after imposing six concurrent life sen
tences.
Bianchi had quietly answered, "Yes, I did,"
as Deputy District Attorney Roger Kelly asked
him if he killed each of five victims in a string of
10 slayings from September 1977 through Feb
ruary 1978. He also pleaded guilty to one count
of conspiracy.
Bianchi's cousin, Angelo Buono, 45, of
Clendale, had his arraignment on 24 counts
c ontinued two weeks by Municipal judge Gab
riel Gutierrez. No plea was entered.
He will remain in custody without bail until
the preliminary hearing, now set for Nov. 5.
Kelly said it was unlikely that Bianchi would
ever be paroled, but noted, "No matter how
heinous the crime, everyone comes up for a
parole hearing."
Bianchi admitted he committed each of the
crimes "in conjunction with" Buono.
Buono was arrested Friday and charged with
the slayings just minutes after Bianchi entered
guilty pleas to strangling two Western
Washington University coeds.
Hiring suit filed against Sears
Washington — The federal government took
Sears Roebuck & Co. to court in five cities
yesterday on charges that the world's largest
retailer practiced illegal job discrimination
against women and minorities across the Un
ited States.
A nationwide suit filed in federal court in
Chicago accused Sears of job discrimination
against women in the 48 contiguous states in
violation of the Civil Rights and Equal Pay acts.
Four other suits filed simultaneously in New
York City, Atlanta, Montgomery, Ala., and
Memphis, Tenn., charged the retailer with dis
criminating against minorities in hiring at
seven facilities in those four areas.
The suits, brought by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, are among the
largest employment discrimination cases ever
launched by the government and likely will be

the biggest job bias suit to be fought in court.
Sears is one of the nation's largest
employers, with a workforce of 400,000 in all 50
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico.
The suits were filed more than six years after
the federal agency first accused Sears of racial
and sexual discrimination in its employment
practices.
The suit charged that federal policies, such
as veterans preference laws, created a work
force that is dominated by white males, thus
preventing employers from providing equal
job opportunities to women and minorities.
The suit was later dismissed by the trial judge
as being without merit.
According to Sears figures based on 1977
employment, 20 percent of the company's
employees are minorities. Among "officials
and managers," 10 percent are minorities and
36 percent are female.
Exxon's 3rd quarter profits up
New York — Exxon Corp., the world's largest
oil company, said yesterday its profits were up
118 percent for the third quarter.
"It was a good quarter," Ulysses LaGrange,
the company's comptroller, said of the $1.14
billion profit. He said, however, that most of
the company's profits were not reaped at the
expense of American motorists and homeow
ners but from big increases in earnings from
the company's overseas operations.
This year's third-quarter profits were the
biggest in Exxon's history and among the most
ever earned in a quarter by a U.S. company.
Exxon's sales in the quarter rose to $20.65 bill
ion from $15.9 billion.
LaGrange said the size of the difference be
tween this year's third quarter and last year's
third quarter was slightly misleading because
last year's third quarter results were the
poorest for the firm in five years.
PacTel plans to raise rates
San Francisco — Pacific Telephone Co. will
seek a rate increase "in the range of $400 mill
ion annually" to help finance a record $2.4
billion construction program for 1980, a com
pany executive disclosed yesterday.
L. Reed Waters, vice president for regulatory
matters, said an application to be filed with the
California Public Utilities Commission (PUC)
in about two weeks will demonstrate an inabil

ity to obtain required financing at current
rates.
The $2.4 billion would provide plant and
equipment for 550,000 new telephones, he
said, and the rate increase would help Pacific
Telephone realize its authorized 9.73 percent
rate of return and thus create a better climate
in the financial marketplace for bond offer
ings.
Waters' made his disclosure to Associated
Press while at a PUC hearing into how Pacific
will make refunds totaling $341 million — as of
August — and reduce rates by some $38 million
annually as ordered by the agency.

118 percent for the third quarter.
"It was a good quarter," Ulysses LaGrange,
the company's comptroller, said of the $1.14
billion profit. He said, however, that most of
the company's profits were not reaped at the
expense of American motorists and homeow
ners but from big increases in earnings from
the company's overseas operations.
This year's third-quarter profits were the
biggest in Exxon's history and among the most
ever earned in a quarter by a U.S. company.
Exxon's sales in the quarter rose to $20.65 bill
ion from $15.9 billion.
LaGrange said the size of the difference be
tween this year's third quarter and last year's
third quarter was slightly misleading because
last year's third quarter results were the
poorest for the firm in five years.
PacTel plans to raise rates
San Francisco — Pacific Telephone Co. will
seek a rate increase "in the range of $400 mill
ion annually" to help finance a record $2.4
billion construction program for 1980, a com
pany executive disclosed yesterday.
L. Reed Waters, vice president for regulatory
matters, said an application to be filed with the
California Public Utilities Commission (PUC)
in about two weeks will demonstrate an inabil

ity to obtain required financing at current
rates.
The $2.4 billion would provide plant and
equipment for 550,000 new telephones, he
said, and the rate increase would help Pacific
Telephone realize its authorized 9.73 percent
rate of return and thus create a better climate
in the financial marketplace for bond offer
ings.
Waters' made his disclosure to Associated
Press while at a PUC hearing into how Pacific
will make refunds totaling $341 million — as of
August — and reduce rates by some $38 million
annually as ordered by the agency.
London Times back to presses
London — The venerable Times of London,
one of the world's most influential newspap
ers, won't be calling it an era after all.
A last-minute accord Sunday between man
agement and a printers' union saved the 194-
year-old paper, which is as much a mainstay of
Britain as cricket and the stiff upper lip.
Publication of the Times, the Sunday Times
and three weekly supplements had been sus
pended for lOV2 months in a showdown with
labor over manning, strikes and technology.
The Times management and the National
Graphical Association announced agreement
less than five hours before a deadline set by
the International Thomson Organization, the
Canadian-based parent firm 0! Times News
papers Ltd.
The company had threatened to fire 3700
print workers and effectively close the papers
if agreement was not reached by 4 p.m. Sun
day. It planned to keep some 450 journalists
and 150 executives on the payroll — for un
specified purposes.
Michael Mander, Times deputy chief execu
tive, said it might resume publishing this week,
but "we won't be giving our rivals advance
notice of when it will be."
Sunday Times Editor Harold Evans said he
did not expect the Times to be back in print
until Nov. 13 or Nov. 14 and the Sunday Times
by Nov. 11 to Nov. 18, depending on time
needed to prepare equipment.
The suspension, originally estimated to last
only three or four months, ended up costing
$56 million in lost revenue, the Times said.

Czech dissident trial begins
Prague, Czechoslovakia — Six human rights
activists went on trial under heavy police guard
yesterday and the wife of one of the dissidents
was arrested after taking notes in the cour
troom. A second woman was taken into cus
tody outside the court building, dissident
sources said.
All six defendents in the biggest Czechos
lovak political trial in seven years were accused
of being founding members of a group formed
in 1978 to aid other dissidents. Czechoslovak
authorities charge the group was illegal and
that its members aided U.S.-guided prop
aganda campaigns against the country. If con
victed, they could be jailed for 10 years.
Playwright Vaclav Havel, 43, and govern
ment critic Petr Uhl, 38, had still not entered
pleas, dissidents said, but three of the others
pleaded innocent.
Otta Bednarova, 54, a former journalist, de
clined to enter a plea or answer questions, as
she had during earlier questioning, dissidents
said.

Dow Jones average down 5.55
New York — Continued worries about the

Tederal Reserve sent the stock market down

Strangler given six life terms
Los Angeles — Kenneth Bianchi, quiet and
calm, was sentenced to life in prison after
pleading guilty yesterday to five slayings in the
"Hillside Strangler" murders that terrorized
Southern California women for six months.
"I wish I had the power that it be ordered
that your sentence . . . run consecutively,"
Superior Court Judge William Keene told Bian
chi after imposing six concurrent life sen
tences.
Bianchi had quietly answered, "Yes, I did,"
as Deputy District Attorney Roger Kelly asked
him if he killed each of five victims in a string of
10 slayings from September 1977 through Feb
ruary 1978. He also pleaded guilty to one count
of conspiracy.
Bianchi's cousin, Angelo Buono, 45, of
Clendale, had his arraignment on 24 counts
c ontinued two weeks by Municipal judge Gab
riel Gutierrez. No plea was entered.
He will remain in custody without bail until
the preliminary hearing, now set for Nov. 5.
Kelly said it was unlikely that Bianchi would
ever be paroled, but noted, "No matter how
heinous the crime, everyone comes up for a
parole hearing."
Bianchi admitted he committed each of the
crimes "in conjunction with" Buono.
Buono was arrested Friday and charged with
the slayings just minutes after Bianchi entered
guilty pleas to strangling two Western
Washington University coeds.
Hiring suit filed against Sears
Washington — The federal government took
Sears Roebuck & Co. to court in five cities
yesterday on charges that the world's largest
retailer practiced illegal job discrimination
against women and minorities across the Un
ited States.
A nationwide suit filed in federal court in
Chicago accused Sears of job discrimination
against women in the 48 contiguous states in
violation of the Civil Rights and Equal Pay acts.
Four other suits filed simultaneously in New
York City, Atlanta, Montgomery, Ala., and
Memphis, Tenn., charged the retailer with dis
criminating against minorities in hiring at
seven facilities in those four areas.
The suits, brought by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, are among the
largest employment discrimination cases ever
launched by the government and likely will be

the biggest job bias suit to be fought in court.
Sears is one of the nation's largest
employers, with a workforce of 400,000 in all 50
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico.
The suits were filed more than six years after
the federal agency first accused Sears of racial
and sexual discrimination in its employment
practices.
The suit charged that federal policies, such
as veterans preference laws, created a work
force that is dominated by white males, thus
preventing employers from providing equal
job opportunities to women and minorities.
The suit was later dismissed by the trial judge
as being without merit.
According to Sears figures based on 1977
employment, 20 percent of the company's
employees are minorities. Among "officials
and managers," 10 percent are minorities and
36 percent are female.
