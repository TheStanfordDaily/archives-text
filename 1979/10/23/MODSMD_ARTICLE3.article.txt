# Students urged to battle for funded abortions
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
A Planned Parenthood worker
urged students here at a noon rally
yesterday to "match the dedica
tion, energy and organizational
skills of those who would deprive
you of your reproductive rights" by
becoming involved in the fight for
federal and state funded abortions.
In a speech heavily laced with re
ferences to anti-abortion organiza
tions, Steven High, a Santa Clara
County Planned Parenthood staf
fer, told a White Plaza group of
about 100 that, "although we can

not help but be impressed with the
scope of anti-abortion successes at
the federal, state and county level,
no one should assume that the op
ponents of safe and legal abortion
are satisfied with merely elimina
tion of abortion rights for poor
women.
"Their ultimate goal is an
amendment to the U.S. Constitu
tion outlawing abortion com
pletely," he said.
The Planned Parenthood staffer
also commented on U.S. Senate
passage of the Hyde Amendment to

an HEW appropriations bill (H.R.
4381). This amendment, introduced
in Congress last year and passed by
the Senate in July, prohibits the use
of federal medical funds for abor
tion in all but a few exceptional
cases.
"Their (anti-abortion groups)
greatest victory and our biggest de
feat has been the acceptance of the
Hyde Amendment," High claimed.
"Having won this victory, they
have turned their attention to state
legislatures where similar language
outlawing state funds for abortion
has been successful in all but about
a dozen states," he continued.
High told the Daily after the rally
that anti-abortion groups are pre
sently lobbying strongly in Sac
ramento to ban the use of state
funds for abortion.
The California Supreme Court
has not yet reached a final decision
on whether to allow state funds to
be used for abortions for poor wo
men. That court did, however, rule
that until a decision is reached,
state funds will continue to be used
for abortions, High noted.
The date for the court's final ver
dict is very tentative, High ob
served. "The decision could be to
morrow or it could be months from
now," he said.
Estimating that the chances of the
court ruling in favor of state-funded
abortions are slim, High said. "My
guess is that they'll rule against
abortion on the grounds that it is
within legislative budgetary author
ity to decide how state funds will be
spent."

He called the right to an abortion
a human right. "I think you know
that human rights must include
women's rights and that women's
rights must include reproductive
rights."
Criticizing anti-abortion groups,
High continued, "What you may
not know, in its fullest dimensions,
is that these rights are under a furi
ous, determined and effective
siege by groups who mask their
hatred and contempt for women
under the high-sounding label,
'right-to-life.' "
Nanette Kelly, a spokesman for
the Coalition for Abortion Rights
Equality, a Mid-Peninsula pro
abortion organization, spoke after
High. She urged students to do
their utmost to lobby for the allo
wance of state funds for abortions
for poor women.
"It's time we mobilized, wrote
letters, did a simple thing such as
register to vote" in order to protect
abortion rights, she said.
Calling "pro-life" organizations
"anti-rights movements," Kelly told
audience members "your voice is
important" and "we need your
help" to combat anti-abortion
group attempts at restricting funds.
The rally was sponsored by the
campus Pro-Choice Alliance, a stu
dent coalition dedicated to educat
ing the Stanford community on the
abortion issue, according to group
spokesman Gabriella Rehmann.
The rally began six-day-series of
campus activities commemorating
National Abortion Rights Action
Week.
