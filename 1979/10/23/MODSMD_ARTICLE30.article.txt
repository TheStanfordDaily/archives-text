Correction
Sunday's Stanford Run was co
sponsored by Theta Delta Chi, Delta
Upsilon and Zeta Psi fraternities
along with Blue Cross of California
and KVA radio. The Daily incorrectly
identified Delta Kappa Epsilon as one
of the event's sponsors while omit
ting Delta Upsilon. The Daily regrets
the error.
Freshmen
Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don and about 30 professors will
meet with the freshman class this
Friday afternoon in a program spon
sored by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation.
The purpose of the event, accord
ing to FHargadon, is to give the
freshmen the experience of meeting
faculty members "to find out early
that faculty are approachable."
Unauthorized insert

the "Revolutionary Communist
Youth Brigade" were inserted into
some issues of the Daily. These inser
tions were made without the Daily's

Daily does not condone any tamper
ing with copies of its papers.
