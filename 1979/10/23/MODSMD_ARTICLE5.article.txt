# Coffee House concert angers ex-workers
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Despite protests by fired
employees of the Coffee House, the
ASSU will go ahead with plans to
stage a Tom Scott concert there Oct.
25.
A statement released last week by
the Council of Presidents (COP) says
the decision to authorize the concert
in the Coffee House is not "a state
ment in support or non-support of
the boycott" and will be maintained,
despite possible threats to picket the
Coffee House by some former
employees.
Former workers of the Tresidder
concession are calling the decision
authorized by the COP, ASSU Spe
cial Events and the ASSU Student Fi
nancial Manager Bruce Bendix, a
"broken promise."
According to Chip Zempel, one of
the 37 employees fired en masse by
Guckenheimer Enterprises July 27,
"We talked to (Director of Special
Events) John Harris at the time school
started. He promised us that ASSU
would not hold any concerts in the
Coffee House.
"It seems to us that if any group
should support us it should be the
ASSU," said Zempel. "In my opinion
they're doing their best to attract
people to the Coffee House."
He also said that, "if the concert
goes on, we will definitely be there
with pickets."
Only available site
Harris said that the decision to
hold the concert in the Coffee House
was basically a COP matter and was
made because "We simply could not
find another place to hold the con
cert."
Harris explained that the aim of
this year's concert schedule is to
provide "good quality acts at a low
cost to students."
Last year a series of concerts were
held at Encina Station, but visiting
artists complained about the acous
tics in the station. Therefore, "We

did not want to risk our relationship
with the major agents by having ar
tists perform there," Harris said.
A Special Events spokesman said
that Scott's agent is aware of the
labor dispute surrounding this con
cert. Both the agent and Scott were
unavailable for comment.
Free concert concept discarded
This concert is the only one Special
Events has scheduled this year for the
Coffee House, according to Harris,
because future concerts have been
relocated to other places. Special
Events had originally planned to
sponsor four free concerts per week
at the Coffee House. That idea was,
however, "scrapped" when Special
Events coordinators learned of the
boycott and "couldn't get it together
with Tresidder," he said.
Other efforts directed toward forc
ing Guckenheimer Enterprises to
bargain collectively with the

employees' group have included a
Santa Clara Labor Council
sanctioned picket line in front of the
Coffee House, a petition signed by
more than 4000 members of the Stan
ford community in support of the
fired workers and attempts to gain
the support of various campus
groups including the ASSU.
Requests for COP bail
Delegations of former Coffee
House workers have contacted the
COP seeking support on three sepa
rate bccasions, according to a
spokesman from the group.
The COP statement contended
that the Scott concert "is simply a
matter of Special Events using a Stan
ford University facility for a Stanford
concert. TDS is the only conces
sionaire in the facility. All revenues
from the concert will go directly to
the ASSU for production and promo
tion costs.

"The ASSU is taking no cut in con
cessions that night," according to
the statement.
ASSU remains neutral
COP member Sibby Freeman said
that the ASSU has not pledged its
support on either side in this dispute
because no clear statement has
reached the COP from either TDS or
the fired employees. "Leadership
will have to emerge before we can
say it is or is not in the best interest of
students to support either side," said
Freeman.
Tillie Garay, a fired employee, dis
counted ASSU claims of providing a
valuable service to the students by
staging this concert. "Not that many
people come in saying 'we want a
Tom Scott concert in the Coffee
House,' but here is an active voice
(the petition signatures) saying 'we
support the members of the Coffee
House,' " she said.

Requests for COP bail
Delegations of former Coffee
House workers have contacted the
COP seeking support on three sepa
rate bccasions, according to a
spokesman from the group.
The COP statement contended
that the Scott concert "is simply a
matter of Special Events using a Stan
ford University facility for a Stanford
concert. TDS is the only conces
sionaire in the facility. All revenues
from the concert will go directly to
the ASSU for production and promo
tion costs.

"The ASSU is taking no cut in con
cessions that night," according to
the statement.
ASSU remains neutral
COP member Sibby Freeman said
that the ASSU has not pledged its
support on either side in this dispute
because no clear statement has
reached the COP from either TDS or
the fired employees. "Leadership
will have to emerge before we can
say it is or is not in the best interest of
students to support either side," said
Freeman.
Tillie Garay, a fired employee, dis
counted ASSU claims of providing a
valuable service to the students by
staging this concert. "Not that many
people come in saying 'we want a
Tom Scott concert in the Coffee
House,' but here is an active voice
(the petition signatures) saying 'we
support the members of the Coffee
House,' " she said.
Despite protests by fired
employees of the Coffee House, the
ASSU will go ahead with plans to
stage a Tom Scott concert there Oct.
25.
A statement released last week by
the Council of Presidents (COP) says
the decision to authorize the concert
in the Coffee House is not "a state
ment in support or non-support of
the boycott" and will be maintained,
despite possible threats to picket the
Coffee House by some former
employees.
Former workers of the Tresidder
concession are calling the decision
authorized by the COP, ASSU Spe
cial Events and the ASSU Student Fi
nancial Manager Bruce Bendix, a
"broken promise."
According to Chip Zempel, one of
the 37 employees fired en masse by
Guckenheimer Enterprises July 27,
"We talked to (Director of Special
Events) John Harris at the time school
started. He promised us that ASSU
would not hold any concerts in the
Coffee House.
"It seems to us that if any group
should support us it should be the
ASSU," said Zempel. "In my opinion
they're doing their best to attract
people to the Coffee House."
He also said that, "if the concert
goes on, we will definitely be there
with pickets."
Only available site
Harris said that the decision to
hold the concert in the Coffee House
was basically a COP matter and was
made because "We simply could not
find another place to hold the con
cert."
Harris explained that the aim of
this year's concert schedule is to
provide "good quality acts at a low
cost to students."
Last year a series of concerts were
held at Encina Station, but visiting
artists complained about the acous
tics in the station. Therefore, "We

did not want to risk our relationship
with the major agents by having ar
tists perform there," Harris said.
A Special Events spokesman said
that Scott's agent is aware of the
labor dispute surrounding this con
cert. Both the agent and Scott were
unavailable for comment.
Free concert concept discarded
This concert is the only one Special
Events has scheduled this year for the
Coffee House, according to Harris,
because future concerts have been
relocated to other places. Special
Events had originally planned to
sponsor four free concerts per week
at the Coffee House. That idea was,
however, "scrapped" when Special
Events coordinators learned of the
boycott and "couldn't get it together
with Tresidder," he said.
Other efforts directed toward forc
ing Guckenheimer Enterprises to
bargain collectively with the

employees' group have included a
Santa Clara Labor Council
sanctioned picket line in front of the
Coffee House, a petition signed by
more than 4000 members of the Stan
ford community in support of the
fired workers and attempts to gain
the support of various campus
groups including the ASSU.
