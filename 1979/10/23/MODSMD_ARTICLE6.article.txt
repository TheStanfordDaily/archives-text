# 10,000 letters to high schools
## Hargadon critiques curriculum 
### Richard Shames 
Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don is concerned about the content
and quality of secondary education.
He has to be. He is responsible for
selecting a new freshman class for
the University each year, and he
doesn't like to see the quality of sec
ondary education drop. At all.
He is concerned that bright stu
dents are taking ielatively light
academic loads, are not being chal
lenged enough, are veering away
from the basics, and in some cases
are short-changed out of some 'im
portant' educational opportunities.
"The high school curriculum is
veering away from the basics," he
explains. "Very few of us do more
than is required."
So, in an effort to do something

about the problem, Hargadon writes
letters. Lots of letters.
One urging high school students
to take a strong academic program
was mailed last year to about 10,000
secondary schools. Hargadon's of
fice later received requests for 15,000
reprints from parents, administrators
and students who were not included
in the first mailing.
"We were in a good position to
make the recommendations since
we are not a college struggling for
applicants," Hargadon said in expla
nation of the letter. "We were curi
ous about the reaction and surprised
that it was as positive as it was."
No rigid guidelines
The letter does not stipulate abso
lute course requirements but rather
"recommends what students ought
to be taking," Hargadon said. In
cluded are four actual applicant
transcripts which show consistently
high grades but extreme variation in
level of difficulty of the high school
program.
"At this point, we want to use all
sorts of persuasion short of being
mandatory," Hargadon said.
"Perhaps in the future we will have to
make it mandatory."
The problem in making precise re
quirements is that people will tend to
meet them in a minimal way, he said.
"Adopting a strict formula for admis
sion requirements goes against what
most students want â€” for the admis
sions committee to see them as a
person. We get a lot of bright people
who just don't match any formula,"
he added.
The letter outlines several basic
concerns noted by Hargadon and the
University Committee on Under
graduate Admissions and Financial
Aid. One involves the decline in writ
ing competency, which Hargadon at
tributes to watered-down solid
courses.
Substance suffers
"Courses in government have be
come courses in newspaper read
ing," he said. "History courses have
become very topical without teach
ing much history. English courses
have generally become weak with
less emphasis on literature and writ
ing."
English courses have also shown
less tendency to constructively
criticize students' work, he said.
"Speaking in educational terms,
schools and parents are equally at
fault," he said. "Schools should pro
vide the leadership and tell the
community what is a good program.
Now they must respond to what the
community wants."
As Hargadon explains, the solid
courses should receive greater
stress. For instance, a student lead

ership course should not be offered
during the school day if it denies stu
dents a chance to take an academic
course offered at the same time.
These declining standards have
surfaced because of education's
"popularity philosophy," Hargadon
postulated. He observes a "make
the-kids-happy" syndrome in which
administrators fear that students will
be bored by the basic solids and must
be provided more "interesting"
material.

"I am not convinced students will
resist the basic courses just because
they are difficult," he argued. "Stu
dents will rise to the challenge. Just
as many are turned off by education
because there is no challenge."
The University memorandum ad
vocates a philosophical return-to
the-basics theory. Short of making
precise requirements, the memo
urges students to take a minimum of
three years of English and mathema
tics, two years of history, one or
more years of laboratory science,
three years of a foreign language and
some study of art or music.
Hargadon's recommendations
have been well-received by all par
ties concerned. Teachers have re
quested copies of the letter to help
dissuade school boards from making
budget cuts in frequently over
looked areas. "Teachers say, 'There's
a good school calling for the reten
tion of certain programs, like the
Fine Arts,' " Hargadon said.
Helps save programs
In addition, language departments
have shown the memo to school
boards as a firm indicator of the im
portance of learning a foreign lan
guage, he said. Parents have used the
advice, too, as informal guidelines
for their childrens' curricula in cases
where counseling is weak.
Hargadon atrtributes his success
to the memo's phraseology. "It is not
specifically directed to Stanford but
