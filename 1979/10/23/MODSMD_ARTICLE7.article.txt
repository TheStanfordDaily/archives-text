# Richardson endorses nuclear energy, opposes conscription
## 
### David Frank 
Elliot Richardson endorsed
nuclear energy and criticized
conscription before a packed
Bishop Auditorium on Friday
night.
Richardson, U.S. ambas
sador-at-large and spe
cial representative to the Un
ited Nations Law of the Sea
Conference, said that "care
fully regulated use of nuclear
energy production" should be
part of the total mix of U.S.
energy sources.
Richardson added that this
mix should include "the de
velopment of alternatives, at
least in the form of coal, heavy
oil and oil shale."
The once U.S. Attorney Gen
eral for former President
Richard Nixon also said he
found it "ironical" that many
Americans avoided comparing
the risks between nuclear
power and fuel-burning .re
sources.
According to Richardson,
the chances are "very, very
remote" that a nuclear plant
will "blow up" and cause a
hazardous health situation. He
pointed to "certain costs to life
and health" resulting from
coal-mining and burning:
black lung for miners and in
creased air pollution for urban
dwellers.
At one point, a member of
the audience reminded
Richardson of a Harvard Busi
ness School energy project
that had advocated conserva
tion. Richardson, a Harvard
graduate, responded, "I think
you can push conservation as
far as the study advocates and
still have an excessive reliance
on imported oil."
'Problems' with draft
Richardson indicated he had
"problems" in accepting the
conscription legislation pre
sented to Congress this year.
He said he doubted "that there
could be created meaningful
opportunities for service for
the enormous numbers of
young people that would be

obligated to serve year by
year."
Richardson added that un
less such "meaningful" oppor
tunities could be created, the
conscription issue would be
come "pretty tancid."
Richardson answered ques
tions on several issues in addi
tion to nuclear energy and
conscription for the audience
of more than 200 persons.
He said he agreed with prop
osed increases in national de
fense spending, citing a need
to beef up U.S. military
strength on the NATO front of
central Europe. He also said he
approves increases in U.S.
naval strength, mentioning
that the U.S.'s ability to project
a "critical presence" in places
such as the Indian Ocean "had
been worn down too much."
Pressure in Mideast
On the subject of Middle
East peace policy, Richardson
said the U.S. "has to think of
the manner in which it exer
cises its influence in the pur
suit of a permanent settle
ment." At a given date, he ad
ded, the U.S. must say, "This is
what the settlement should be,
and we are going to put pres
sure on to get it."
Richardson also expressed
skepticism on the issue of
Palestinian self-determination,
saying it was "premature" to
approach the question of the
West Bank if it would result in
the establishment of an inde
pendent Palestinian state.
He refused to take sides on
the C.O.P. presidential nomi
nation but said he thought it
"unlikely" that former Presi
dent Gerald Ford would be
nominated unless the conven
tion was in a real deadlock.
Law of sea
Richardson devoted most of
his speech to his job at the Un
ited Nations (U.N.) Conver
ence on the Law of the Sea. The
Conference is a worldwide, in
stitution for managing re
sources of the world's oceans.
According to Richardson, the
Conference draws representa

tives from 160 nations — eight
countries more than the
number of nations attending
the UN.
The Conference has pro
duced rules to regulate prob
lem situations: sea-bed mining
of manganese nodules, drilling
foroffshore oil and natural gas,
fishing territory disputes and
territorial sovereignty of the
seas, he said.
Sovereignty of the seas re
fers to the offshore band of
ocean over which a country
exercises authority.
Richardson said that problems
arose when nations discussed
rules for the passage of military
vessels through these
sovereign waters.
To preserve the mobility of
its forces, Richardson said the
U.S. had to fight for conditions
preserving free passage of its
military ships through strategi
cally important areas.
Richardson described the
overall effort of the Confer
ence as "ambitious." It "will
have profound implications for
every future situation in which
the world community is ad
dressing the question of how
to manage any resource
deemed to belong to the world
as a whole," he concluded.

was mixed, according to several audience members. One senior
described the speech as "bantering," and a sophomore called
Richardson's presentation "interesting and funny." Richardson also
fielded audience questions for 20 minutes after the speech.

remote" that a nuclear plant
will "blow up" and cause a
hazardous health situation. He
pointed to "certain costs to life
and health" resulting from
coal-mining and burning:
black lung for miners and in
creased air pollution for urban
dwellers.
At one point, a member of
the audience reminded
Richardson of a Harvard Busi
ness School energy project
that had advocated conserva
tion. Richardson, a Harvard
graduate, responded, "I think
you can push conservation as
far as the study advocates and
still have an excessive reliance
on imported oil."
'Problems' with draft
Richardson indicated he had
"problems" in accepting the
conscription legislation pre
sented to Congress this year.
He said he doubted "that there
could be created meaningful
opportunities for service for
the enormous numbers of
young people that would be

obligated to serve year by
year."
Richardson added that un
less such "meaningful" oppor
tunities could be created, the
conscription issue would be
come "pretty tancid."
Richardson answered ques
tions on several issues in addi
tion to nuclear energy and
conscription for the audience
of more than 200 persons.
He said he agreed with prop
osed increases in national de
fense spending, citing a need
to beef up U.S. military
strength on the NATO front of
central Europe. He also said he
approves increases in U.S.
naval strength, mentioning
that the U.S.'s ability to project
a "critical presence" in places
such as the Indian Ocean "had
been worn down too much."
Pressure in Mideast
On the subject of Middle
East peace policy, Richardson
said the U.S. "has to think of
the manner in which it exer
cises its influence in the pur
suit of a permanent settle
ment." At a given date, he ad
ded, the U.S. must say, "This is
what the settlement should be,
and we are going to put pres
sure on to get it."
Richardson also expressed
skepticism on the issue of
Palestinian self-determination,
saying it was "premature" to
approach the question of the
West Bank if it would result in
the establishment of an inde
pendent Palestinian state.
He refused to take sides on
the C.O.P. presidential nomi
nation but said he thought it
"unlikely" that former Presi
dent Gerald Ford would be
nominated unless the conven
tion was in a real deadlock.
Law of sea
Richardson devoted most of
his speech to his job at the Un
ited Nations (U.N.) Conver
ence on the Law of the Sea. The
Conference is a worldwide, in
stitution for managing re
sources of the world's oceans.
According to Richardson, the
Conference draws representa

tives from 160 nations — eight
countries more than the
number of nations attending
the UN.
The Conference has pro
duced rules to regulate prob
lem situations: sea-bed mining
of manganese nodules, drilling
foroffshore oil and natural gas,
fishing territory disputes and
territorial sovereignty of the
seas, he said.
Sovereignty of the seas re
fers to the offshore band of
ocean over which a country
exercises authority.
Richardson said that problems
arose when nations discussed
rules for the passage of military
vessels through these
sovereign waters.
To preserve the mobility of
its forces, Richardson said the
U.S. had to fight for conditions
preserving free passage of its
military ships through strategi
cally important areas.
Richardson described the
overall effort of the Confer
ence as "ambitious." It "will
have profound implications for
every future situation in which
the world community is ad
dressing the question of how
to manage any resource
deemed to belong to the world
as a whole," he concluded.


Elliot Richardson, U.S. ambassador-at-large, discussed his diplomatic
responsibilities and his work as U.S. representative to the United
Nations Law of the Sea Conference during a 40-minute speech here
last Friday evening. Student reaction to the former attorney general

was mixed, according to several audience members. One senior
described the speech as "bantering," and a sophomore called
Richardson's presentation "interesting and funny." Richardson also
fielded audience questions for 20 minutes after the speech.
Elliot Richardson endorsed
nuclear energy and criticized
conscription before a packed
Bishop Auditorium on Friday
night.
Richardson, U.S. ambas
sador-at-large and spe
cial representative to the Un
ited Nations Law of the Sea
Conference, said that "care
fully regulated use of nuclear
energy production" should be
part of the total mix of U.S.
energy sources.
Richardson added that this
mix should include "the de
velopment of alternatives, at
least in the form of coal, heavy
oil and oil shale."
The once U.S. Attorney Gen
eral for former President
Richard Nixon also said he
found it "ironical" that many
Americans avoided comparing
the risks between nuclear
power and fuel-burning .re
sources.
