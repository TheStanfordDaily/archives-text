National Board Exam scores for
Medical School students here are
higher than they were last year, the
office of student affairs at the Med
School announced Monday.
Only 15 percent of the students
taking the test failed all or part of it
this year, as compared to 37 percent
failing last year.
John Steward, dean of student af
fairs at the Med School, attributed
the high number of failures last year
to "an attitudinal problem."
"I'm sure that they dropped be
cause the students thought the
scores weren't important. Students
are putting a higher priority on the
boards and are studying more for
them now," Steward said.
"The faculty never made com
ments when the scores were good,"
Steward added. However, when the
scores went down the faculty made it
clear to students that the tests were
important, he said.
Two parts
The exam is divided into two parts.
The first part, usually taken after two
years of med school, tests know
ledge in the basic sciences. Part two,

usually taken after the third year,
tests knowledge in the clinical sci
ences. The University requires stu
dents to pass both parts to receive a
medical degree.
Last year, 71 students here took the
exams. Of these students, 11 failed
the entire test and 15 failed one or
more of the subsections. This year,
of the 87 students who took the
exam, only two faijed the test overall
and 11 failed at least one part.
Only 16 students performed at or
above an 83 percentile last year com
pared to 26 this year.
Apparently, the Med School has
highly emphasized research and
electives in the past, said Steward.
Must make time
When asked if these areas were
de-emphasized to improve board
scores this year, Steward replied, "If
the students are going to put more
emphasis on the boards they will
have to find some way to study for
them. Some may do less research,
some may sleep less and others may
choose to take fewer electives."
Last year, when failures increased
from 27 percent of the students fail-
