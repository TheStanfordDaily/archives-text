# Religion at Stanford: still a force for students?
## 
### Maria Higuera First of two parts 
Nietzsche to the contrary,
God lives on in one form or
another in many of the minds
and hearts of Stanford stu
dents.
As stipulated by Jane Stan
ford in 1902, "the University
must be forever maintained
upon a nonsectarian basis . . .
entirely free from all denomi
national alliances," and yet
there are at least 22 organiza
tions both on and off campus
that serve the religious needs
of students here.
The Dean of Memorial
Church, Robert Hamerton-
Kelly, estimated that religious
organizations do not affect
more than 20 percent of the
University. "Dormant religious
convictions can be made to live
again, though," he added.
Father Robert Giguere of the
Roman Catholic Newman
Center said he is unimpressed
by low attendance figures: "I
think students today are more
religious than ever; they're
hungry for religion but aren't
quite sure that the institutional
church can provide some food
for their spiritual and religious
needs."
'Parallel' growth
The avenues of religious ex
pression here are as diverse as
the student body itself. Assis-

tant Dean of Memorial Church
Donald Caughey expressed a
general attitude among the
campus clergy when he said,
"We're anxious to provide for
the variety of students' needs
through the whole support

range of ministries because it's
important that spiritual growth
parallel personal and cognitive
growth."
For the most part, students
can forget about finding a re
ligious organization at Stan
ford that will relieve them of
the burden of making their
own decisions. "A living faith is
not one that's just dogmatic,
but one that struggles with
one's own doubt," agreed
Manfred Bahmann, minister ot
the Stanford Lutheran Center.
He added, "Doubt and skepti
cism are a part ot my faith."
As Byron Bland of the United
Campus Ministry said, "Unless
you doubt, unless you hurt,
you won't be able to grow.
I'm not interested in whetner
or not a student practices with
a church; I'm interested in
being with students individu
ally as they struggle through
the development anci growth
of their belief and faith."
Hillel, the umbrella organi
zation for Stanford Jewry,
plans to sponsor a new prog
ram of regular discussions for
agnostic Jews this quarter.
Testing ideas
According to Caughey, re
ligious organizations don't
usually place enough emphasis
on skepticism, and it is just this
aspect ot faith that concerns
many undergraduates who are
"testing all of the ideas they've
received before and who have
no sense of values because ev
erything is relative."
Bland also acknowledged
this part of faith: "Many stu
dents at Stanford are in a stage
of faith development where re
ligious affiliation doesn't meet
their present spiritual or social
needs. In some instances, it is a
matter of their rejecting old be
liefs so that a newer, richer,
deeper faith may develop."
Acceptance
So if dogma is de
emphasized and, as Caughey
said he believes, "It doesn't
really matter whether
Cod exists or not," what kinds
of values do the religious or
ganizations here espouse?
"Ultimately," Caughey
answered, "Love is more im
portant than alienation."
Rabbi Mark Cartun of Hillel
also considered emotionally
satisfying interpersonal rela

tionships high among the ex
pectations of those students
involved in religious organiza
tions.
When it happens that a stu
dent gets hurt in a relationship,
"Religion can play the part of
comforter and supporter,"
Hamerton-Kelly affirmed. Cru
cial to this kind of humanita
rian spirituality, according to
Caughey, is admitting one's
needs, admitting that one is
lonely and ignorant, and that
sometimes one needs to trust
in order to get through the day.

Junior Mark Barak, an Ur
thodox Jew, expressed similar
sentiments: "I think that most
religious people have to realize
that religion is a crutch but I
think we all have broken legs."
Consequently, a lot of cam
pus ministries work through
counseling and informal con
versation. Wendy Smith, as
sociate dean of Memorial
Church, said she counsels stu
dents for an average of 15
hours a week on a variety of
personal, psychological or

spiritual problems.
Community
As far as Barak is concerned,
one of the most important
parts of being Jewish is being
part of a community: "It's ex
tremely important for moral
support."
Speaking of the relation
ships among her fellow Cam
pus Crusaders, junior Liz
Layman said simply, "We'reall
just really good friends."
Stanford religious com
munities extend beyond the
boundaries of the University,

often acting as liaisons bet
ween local ministries and the
campus. Bahmann values this
exchange: "It's a healthy
bridge between the lives of the
students and area residents."
It's common for students and
local folks to share social ac
tion concerns.
One concern that sup
posedly affects students in par
ticular is academic life.
Whether academics conflict
with religion at Stanford is a

question that prompted a wide
range of responses.
Academic conflict
Although admitting to the
challenge that meets all stu
dents arriving in the
heterogeneous atmosphere of
the University where a signific
ant "adjustment of values is
necessary," Calegari said his
academics complimented his
spiritual growth.
"My academic work here has
enriched my faith and my intel
lectual approach to religion."
Barak, on the other hand,

spoke of religion as being "un
fashionable" at Stanford be
cause, as he claimed, "Most
people don't think there is an
intelligent approach to relig
ion."
The "intelligence" factor in
cludes most of the faculty.
Smith said he has the impres
sion that there are a number of
faculty who have active biases
against religion in general.
One sophomore majoring in
religious studies complained

about a professor who periodi
cally asks his class, "By the
way, none of you believe in
Cod anymore, do you?"
Hamerton-Kelly said that the
attitude of that particular pro
fessor isn't at all representa
tive. "In general, the faculty
gives the impression that relig
ion is an outmoded attitude
that s not even worth bringing
up. It's something for imbe
ciles, children and old wo
men," he smiled. "God just
isn't interesting anymore."
Religion an issue for profs?
Speaking from a perspective
approximating the intersection
between academics and relig
ion, Religious Studies Dept.
Chairman William Clebsch was
of the same opinion as
Hamerton-Kelly: "I think to
call the faculty here anti
religious would overly dignity
their interest in religion. It
simply isn't an issue for most
academics."
At the same time, Clebsch re
jected an undergraduate's
claim that religious studies was
an "atheistic" department:
"The academic study of relig
ion requires a suspension of
particular religious loyalties for
the sake of understanding."
Such objectivity apparently
poses a threat to the beliefs of
some students. One religious
studies major commented,
"It's not infrequent that a fun
damentalist Christian will go
into a comparative religious
thought class and be blown
away."
The intense academic pres
sure at Stanford also compli
cates religious pursuits be
cause it leads to competitive
ness and loneliness. Overall,
though, Hamerton-Kelly said
that University students value
spirituality: "They're smart
enough to know that simply
feeding your face, simply cul
tivating your every whim is not
the way to go."
Patricia Brandt of the Office
of Student Activities said that
religious organizations on
campus are growing.
"We started out three years
ago with six or eight students
and ended up last year with
110," said Jan Volker, a co
founder of Campus Crusade
here. Even Bob Dylan, radical

rock star of the 60s, has been
"born again," Volker said.
Return to values?
Hamerton-Kelly attributes
this growth to the nation's
troubled economy and falter
ing self-esteem and sees it as a

part of a return to more con
servative values. Whatever the
immediate causes, though,
Hamerton-Kelly also finds his
torical significance in the in
crease: "I think that the 250
years or so since the En
lightenment has been a period
of aborted projects to make
sense out of human life and
that it is finally getting through
to us that without God that en
terprise is bankrupt."
Clebsch said he believes that
religious activity in this country
has remained more or less
constant since the first census
in 1790. "I don't think we're se
eing a peak now, but the rever
sal from a trough in the '60s to a
peaking again."
Bahmann expressed ambiva
lence over the increase. "Relig
ion is in again. If people are just
coming back to their old relig
ion as a security blanket,
though, I'm not happy about
it."
Along with the other minis
ters, however, Bahmann's
over-all tone was warmly op
timistic: "I don't believe that
this is a 'me only' generation. I
think something new is on the
way in. I respect a very great
sincerity and seriousness that I
find in the present Stanford
student."

no sense of values because ev
erything is relative."
Bland also acknowledged
this part of faith: "Many stu
dents at Stanford are in a stage
of faith development where re
ligious affiliation doesn't meet
their present spiritual or social
needs. In some instances, it is a
matter of their rejecting old be
liefs so that a newer, richer,
deeper faith may develop."
Acceptance
So if dogma is de
emphasized and, as Caughey
said he believes, "It doesn't
really matter whether
Cod exists or not," what kinds
of values do the religious or
ganizations here espouse?
"Ultimately," Caughey
answered, "Love is more im
portant than alienation."
Rabbi Mark Cartun of Hillel
also considered emotionally
satisfying interpersonal rela

tionships high among the ex
pectations of those students
involved in religious organiza
tions.
When it happens that a stu
dent gets hurt in a relationship,
"Religion can play the part of
comforter and supporter,"
Hamerton-Kelly affirmed. Cru
cial to this kind of humanita
rian spirituality, according to
Caughey, is admitting one's
needs, admitting that one is
lonely and ignorant, and that
sometimes one needs to trust
in order to get through the day.

Junior Mark Barak, an Ur
thodox Jew, expressed similar
sentiments: "I think that most
religious people have to realize
that religion is a crutch but I
think we all have broken legs."
Consequently, a lot of cam
pus ministries work through
counseling and informal con
versation. Wendy Smith, as
sociate dean of Memorial
Church, said she counsels stu
dents for an average of 15
hours a week on a variety of
personal, psychological or

spiritual problems.
Community
As far as Barak is concerned,
one of the most important
parts of being Jewish is being
part of a community: "It's ex
tremely important for moral
support."
Speaking of the relation
ships among her fellow Cam
pus Crusaders, junior Liz
Layman said simply, "We'reall
just really good friends."
Stanford religious com
munities extend beyond the
boundaries of the University,

often acting as liaisons bet
ween local ministries and the
campus. Bahmann values this
exchange: "It's a healthy
bridge between the lives of the
students and area residents."
It's common for students and
local folks to share social ac
tion concerns.
One concern that sup
posedly affects students in par
ticular is academic life.
Whether academics conflict
with religion at Stanford is a

question that prompted a wide
range of responses.
Academic conflict
Although admitting to the
challenge that meets all stu
dents arriving in the
heterogeneous atmosphere of
the University where a signific
ant "adjustment of values is
necessary," Calegari said his
academics complimented his
spiritual growth.
"My academic work here has
enriched my faith and my intel
lectual approach to religion."
Barak, on the other hand,

spoke of religion as being "un
fashionable" at Stanford be
cause, as he claimed, "Most
people don't think there is an
intelligent approach to relig
ion."
The "intelligence" factor in
cludes most of the faculty.
Smith said he has the impres
sion that there are a number of
faculty who have active biases
against religion in general.
One sophomore majoring in
religious studies complained

about a professor who periodi
cally asks his class, "By the
way, none of you believe in
Cod anymore, do you?"
Hamerton-Kelly said that the
attitude of that particular pro
fessor isn't at all representa
tive. "In general, the faculty
gives the impression that relig
ion is an outmoded attitude
that s not even worth bringing
up. It's something for imbe
ciles, children and old wo
men," he smiled. "God just
isn't interesting anymore."
Religion an issue for profs?
Speaking from a perspective
approximating the intersection
between academics and relig
ion, Religious Studies Dept.
Chairman William Clebsch was
of the same opinion as
Hamerton-Kelly: "I think to
call the faculty here anti
religious would overly dignity
their interest in religion. It
simply isn't an issue for most
academics."
At the same time, Clebsch re
jected an undergraduate's
claim that religious studies was
an "atheistic" department:
"The academic study of relig
ion requires a suspension of
particular religious loyalties for
the sake of understanding."
Such objectivity apparently
poses a threat to the beliefs of
some students. One religious
studies major commented,
"It's not infrequent that a fun
damentalist Christian will go
into a comparative religious
thought class and be blown
away."
The intense academic pres
sure at Stanford also compli
cates religious pursuits be
cause it leads to competitive
ness and loneliness. Overall,
though, Hamerton-Kelly said
that University students value
spirituality: "They're smart
enough to know that simply
feeding your face, simply cul
tivating your every whim is not
the way to go."
Patricia Brandt of the Office
of Student Activities said that
religious organizations on
campus are growing.
"We started out three years
ago with six or eight students
and ended up last year with
110," said Jan Volker, a co
founder of Campus Crusade
here. Even Bob Dylan, radical

rock star of the 60s, has been
"born again," Volker said.
Return to values?
Hamerton-Kelly attributes
this growth to the nation's
troubled economy and falter
ing self-esteem and sees it as a

part of a return to more con
servative values. Whatever the
immediate causes, though,
Hamerton-Kelly also finds his
torical significance in the in
crease: "I think that the 250
years or so since the En
lightenment has been a period
of aborted projects to make
sense out of human life and
that it is finally getting through
to us that without God that en
terprise is bankrupt."
Clebsch said he believes that
religious activity in this country
has remained more or less
constant since the first census
in 1790. "I don't think we're se
eing a peak now, but the rever
sal from a trough in the '60s to a
peaking again."
Bahmann expressed ambiva
lence over the increase. "Relig
ion is in again. If people are just
coming back to their old relig
ion as a security blanket,
though, I'm not happy about
it."
Along with the other minis
ters, however, Bahmann's
over-all tone was warmly op
timistic: "I don't believe that
this is a 'me only' generation. I
think something new is on the
way in. I respect a very great
sincerity and seriousness that I
find in the present Stanford
student."

Nietzsche to the contrary,
God lives on in one form or
another in many of the minds
and hearts of Stanford stu
dents.
As stipulated by Jane Stan
ford in 1902, "the University
must be forever maintained
upon a nonsectarian basis . . .
entirely free from all denomi
national alliances," and yet
there are at least 22 organiza
tions both on and off campus
that serve the religious needs
of students here.
The Dean of Memorial
Church, Robert Hamerton-
Kelly, estimated that religious
organizations do not affect
more than 20 percent of the
University. "Dormant religious
convictions can be made to live
again, though," he added.
Father Robert Giguere of the
Roman Catholic Newman
Center said he is unimpressed
by low attendance figures: "I
think students today are more
religious than ever; they're
hungry for religion but aren't
quite sure that the institutional
church can provide some food
for their spiritual and religious
needs."
'Parallel' growth
The avenues of religious ex
pression here are as diverse as
the student body itself. Assis-

tant Dean of Memorial Church
Donald Caughey expressed a
general attitude among the
campus clergy when he said,
"We're anxious to provide for
the variety of students' needs
through the whole support

range of ministries because it's
important that spiritual growth
parallel personal and cognitive
growth."
For the most part, students
can forget about finding a re
ligious organization at Stan
ford that will relieve them of
the burden of making their
own decisions. "A living faith is
not one that's just dogmatic,
but one that struggles with
one's own doubt," agreed
Manfred Bahmann, minister ot
the Stanford Lutheran Center.
He added, "Doubt and skepti
cism are a part ot my faith."
As Byron Bland of the United
Campus Ministry said, "Unless
you doubt, unless you hurt,
you won't be able to grow.
I'm not interested in whetner
or not a student practices with
a church; I'm interested in
being with students individu
ally as they struggle through
the development anci growth
of their belief and faith."
Hillel, the umbrella organi
zation for Stanford Jewry,
plans to sponsor a new prog
ram of regular discussions for
agnostic Jews this quarter.
Testing ideas
According to Caughey, re
ligious organizations don't
usually place enough emphasis
on skepticism, and it is just this
aspect ot faith that concerns
many undergraduates who are
"testing all of the ideas they've
received before and who have
no sense of values because ev

Bland also acknowledged
this part of faith: "Many stu

challenge that meets all stu
dents arriving in the
heterogeneous atmosphere of
the University where a signific
ant "adjustment of values is
necessary," Calegari said his
academics complimented his
spiritual growth.
"My academic work here has
enriched my faith and my intel
lectual approach to religion."
Barak, on the other hand,

spoke of religion as being "un
fashionable" at Stanford be
cause, as he claimed, "Most
people don't think there is an
intelligent approach to relig
ion."
The "intelligence" factor in
cludes most of the faculty.
Smith said he has the impres
sion that there are a number of
faculty who have active biases
against religion in general.
One sophomore majoring in
religious studies complained

about a professor who periodi
cally asks his class, "By the
way, none of you believe in
Cod anymore, do you?"
Hamerton-Kelly said that the
attitude of that particular pro
fessor isn't at all representa
tive. "In general, the faculty
gives the impression that relig
ion is an outmoded attitude
that s not even worth bringing
up. It's something for imbe
ciles, children and old wo
men," he smiled. "God just
isn't interesting anymore."
Religion an issue for profs?
Speaking from a perspective
approximating the intersection
between academics and relig
ion, Religious Studies Dept.
Chairman William Clebsch was
of the same opinion as
Hamerton-Kelly: "I think to
call the faculty here anti
religious would overly dignity
their interest in religion. It
simply isn't an issue for most
academics."
At the same time, Clebsch re
jected an undergraduate's
claim that religious studies was
an "atheistic" department:
"The academic study of relig
ion requires a suspension of
particular religious loyalties for
the sake of understanding."
Such objectivity apparently
poses a threat to the beliefs of
some students. One religious
studies major commented,
"It's not infrequent that a fun
damentalist Christian will go
into a comparative religious
thought class and be blown
away."
The intense academic pres
sure at Stanford also compli
cates religious pursuits be
cause it leads to competitive
ness and loneliness. Overall,
though, Hamerton-Kelly said
that University students value
spirituality: "They're smart
enough to know that simply
feeding your face, simply cul
tivating your every whim is not
the way to go."
Patricia Brandt of the Office
of Student Activities said that
religious organizations on
campus are growing.
"We started out three years
ago with six or eight students
and ended up last year with
110," said Jan Volker, a co
founder of Campus Crusade
here. Even Bob Dylan, radical

rock star of the 60s, has been
"born again," Volker said.
Return to values?
Hamerton-Kelly attributes
this growth to the nation's
troubled economy and falter
ing self-esteem and sees it as a

part of a return to more con
servative values. Whatever the
immediate causes, though,
Hamerton-Kelly also finds his
torical significance in the in
crease: "I think that the 250
years or so since the En
lightenment has been a period
of aborted projects to make
sense out of human life and
that it is finally getting through
to us that without God that en
terprise is bankrupt."
Clebsch said he believes that
religious activity in this country
has remained more or less
constant since the first census
in 1790. "I don't think we're se
eing a peak now, but the rever
sal from a trough in the '60s to a
peaking again."
Bahmann expressed ambiva
lence over the increase. "Relig
ion is in again. If people are just
coming back to their old relig
ion as a security blanket,
though, I'm not happy about
it."
Along with the other minis
ters, however, Bahmann's
over-all tone was warmly op
timistic: "I don't believe that
this is a 'me only' generation. I
think something new is on the
way in. I respect a very great
sincerity and seriousness that I
find in the present Stanford
student."

Nietzsche to the contrary,
God lives on in one form or
another in many of the minds
and hearts of Stanford stu
dents.
As stipulated by Jane Stan
ford in 1902, "the University
must be forever maintained
upon a nonsectarian basis . . .
entirely free from all denomi
national alliances," and yet
there are at least 22 organiza
tions both on and off campus
that serve the religious needs
of students here.
The Dean of Memorial
Church, Robert Hamerton-
Kelly, estimated that religious
organizations do not affect
more than 20 percent of the
University. "Dormant religious
convictions can be made to live
again, though," he added.
Father Robert Giguere of the
Roman Catholic Newman
Center said he is unimpressed
by low attendance figures: "I
think students today are more
religious than ever; they're
hungry for religion but aren't
quite sure that the institutional
church can provide some food
for their spiritual and religious
needs."
'Parallel' growth
The avenues of religious ex
pression here are as diverse as
the student body itself. Assis-

tant Dean of Memorial Church
Donald Caughey expressed a
general attitude among the
campus clergy when he said,
"We're anxious to provide for
the variety of students' needs
through the whole support

range of ministries because it's
important that spiritual growth
parallel personal and cognitive
growth."
For the most part, students
can forget about finding a re
ligious organization at Stan
ford that will relieve them of
the burden of making their
own decisions. "A living faith is
not one that's just dogmatic,
but one that struggles with
one's own doubt," agreed
Manfred Bahmann, minister ot
the Stanford Lutheran Center.
He added, "Doubt and skepti
cism are a part ot my faith."
As Byron Bland of the United
Campus Ministry said, "Unless
you doubt, unless you hurt,
you won't be able to grow.
I'm not interested in whetner
or not a student practices with
a church; I'm interested in
being with students individu
ally as they struggle through
the development anci growth
of their belief and faith."
Hillel, the umbrella organi
zation for Stanford Jewry,
plans to sponsor a new prog
ram of regular discussions for
agnostic Jews this quarter.
Testing ideas
According to Caughey, re
ligious organizations don't
usually place enough emphasis
on skepticism, and it is just this
aspect ot faith that concerns
many undergraduates who are
"testing all of the ideas they've
received before and who have
no sense of values because ev
erything is relative."
Bland also acknowledged
this part of faith: "Many stu
dents at Stanford are in a stage
of faith development where re
ligious affiliation doesn't meet
their present spiritual or social
needs. In some instances, it is a
matter of their rejecting old be
liefs so that a newer, richer,
deeper faith may develop."
Acceptance
So if dogma is de
emphasized and, as Caughey
said he believes, "It doesn't
really matter whether
Cod exists or not," what kinds
of values do the religious or
ganizations here espouse?
"Ultimately," Caughey
answered, "Love is more im
portant than alienation."
Rabbi Mark Cartun of Hillel
also considered emotionally
satisfying interpersonal rela

tionships high among the ex
pectations of those students
involved in religious organiza
tions.
When it happens that a stu
dent gets hurt in a relationship,
"Religion can play the part of
comforter and supporter,"
Hamerton-Kelly affirmed. Cru
cial to this kind of humanita
rian spirituality, according to
Caughey, is admitting one's
needs, admitting that one is
lonely and ignorant, and that
sometimes one needs to trust
in order to get through the day.

Junior Mark Barak, an Ur
thodox Jew, expressed similar
sentiments: "I think that most
religious people have to realize
that religion is a crutch but I
think we all have broken legs."
Consequently, a lot of cam
pus ministries work through
counseling and informal con
versation. Wendy Smith, as
sociate dean of Memorial
Church, said she counsels stu
dents for an average of 15
hours a week on a variety of
personal, psychological or

spiritual problems.
Community
As far as Barak is concerned,
one of the most important
parts of being Jewish is being
part of a community: "It's ex
tremely important for moral
support."
Speaking of the relation
ships among her fellow Cam
pus Crusaders, junior Liz
Layman said simply, "We'reall
just really good friends."
Stanford religious com
munities extend beyond the
boundaries of the University,

often acting as liaisons bet
ween local ministries and the
campus. Bahmann values this
exchange: "It's a healthy
bridge between the lives of the
students and area residents."
It's common for students and
local folks to share social ac
tion concerns.
One concern that sup
posedly affects students in par
ticular is academic life.
Whether academics conflict
with religion at Stanford is a

question that prompted a wide
range of responses.
