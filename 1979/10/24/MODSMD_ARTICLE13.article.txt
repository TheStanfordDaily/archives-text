## Child abuse cripples nation 
### 
As the year 1979 has been set aside as the
International Year of the Child, it is appropriate
to consider a major problem which currently
plagues the little people of American society.
Child neglect and abuse have become increas
ingly prevalent components of the child-rearing
process in our population.
Data from a variety of sources indicates that
over one million children are currently subject
to maltreatment, ranging from physical and
mental punishment to gross neglect and starva
tion.
Vincent DeFrancis, director of the children's
division of the American Humane Society, has
estimated that between 30,000 and 40,000 cases
of battered children are reported annually,
along with over 100,000 instances of sexual
abuse and 200,000 to 300,000 psychologically
abused children each year.
Based on a 20 percent increase of reported
child abuse cases, the next decade is expected
to include 1.5 million cases of suspected mal
treatment, 50,000 childhood deaths and a
minimum of 300,000 permanently injured chil
dren.
Shocking as these statistics may be, they do
not convey the full tragic story of child abuse.
Studies have shown that many infants and
young children subjected to the abusive and
neglecting hands of their parents — if they sur
vive — show evidence of emotional and
psychological disturbances leading to juvenile
delinquency in adolescence.
Individuals who engage in violence tend to
have once been its victims, hence this genera
tion's battered children may well become the
battering parents of the future.
Accurate statistics concerning the incidence
of child abuse in America are not available, as
only a fraction of affected children are taken to
physicians or hospitals for medical attention.
Of those who are, many are misdiagnosed
due to seemingly legitimate parental stories,
lack of input from the victim due to age limita
tion or denial and fear of legal complications on
the part of health care practitioners.
Thus, despite the alarming magnitude of

documented cases, we are clearly seeing only
the tip of the iceberg.
Based on these facts, an editorial in the jour
nal of the American Medical Association stated
that child abuse could possibly turn out to be "a
more frequent cause of death than such well
recognized and thorougly studied diseases as
leukemia, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dys
trophy, and may even rank with automobile ac
cidents and toxic and infectious encephalitis as
causes of atypical disturbances of the central
nervous system."
However, unlike the entities listed in the
above passage, the maltreatment of children is a
preventable pediatric disease.
Clearly, definitive measures are indicated to
eradicate this intolerable symptom of the vio
lence which is presently running rampant in
American society.
A sustained and determined campaign should
be undertaken throughout the nation, utilizing
the mass media and formal educational chan
nels, to awaken the general public to the prob
lem of child abuse.
Practicing physicians have, in recent years,
been alerted to clues suggesting the diagnosis,
but more emphasis is needed in the medical
literature.
Most importantly, efforts must be made to
encourage abusing parents to report their ac
tions and to seek psychological, medical, social
and legal assistance.
Child abuse is a form of violence which ulti
mately results in social disorganization and dis
integration.
If allowed to continue at its present pace, it
will inevitably threaten the future of the Ameri
can family and taint the entire fabric of our civili
zation.
Children are our most precious gift and hold
the hope and promise of a better future society.
Rather than abuse these innocent and helpless
individuals, we should recall words from the
United Nations charter: "Mankind owes to the
child the best it has to give."

leukemia, cystic fibrosis, and muscular dys
trophy, and may even rank with automobile ac
cidents and toxic and infectious encephalitis as
causes of atypical disturbances of the central
nervous system."
However, unlike the entities listed in the
above passage, the maltreatment of children is a
preventable pediatric disease.
Clearly, definitive measures are indicated to
eradicate this intolerable symptom of the vio
lence which is presently running rampant in
American society.
A sustained and determined campaign should
be undertaken throughout the nation, utilizing
the mass media and formal educational chan
nels, to awaken the general public to the prob
lem of child abuse.
Practicing physicians have, in recent years,
been alerted to clues suggesting the diagnosis,
but more emphasis is needed in the medical
literature.
Most importantly, efforts must be made to
encourage abusing parents to report their ac
tions and to seek psychological, medical, social
and legal assistance.
Child abuse is a form of violence which ulti
mately results in social disorganization and dis
integration.
If allowed to continue at its present pace, it
will inevitably threaten the future of the Ameri
can family and taint the entire fabric of our civili
zation.
Children are our most precious gift and hold
the hope and promise of a better future society.
Rather than abuse these innocent and helpless
individuals, we should recall words from the
United Nations charter: "Mankind owes to the
child the best it has to give."
