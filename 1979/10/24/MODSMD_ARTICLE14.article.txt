# Julie Kulhanian and Robert Boyajian
## Armenian's cause a peaceful one 
### 
As concerned individuals
and as representatives of the
Armenian community here, we
find the murder of the son of
the Turkish ambassador to the
Netherlands, Ahmet Benler, by
I he suspected terrorist group
"lustice Commandos of the
Armenian Genocide," a de
plorable and irresponsible ac
tion ("Armenian Terrorists Slay
Turk," Daily, Oct. 15).
We believe that the murder
of innocent Turks is morally
wrong, and this incident
should not be condoned by the
Armenian community.
Those readers who have had
little exposure to Armenians
should not judge the Armenian
cause by this incident. The
Armenians are a peaceful and

proud people who have lived
through many struggles in
their two and one-half millenia
history, both on their native
lands and later in diaspora. We
have survived and ma *ain a
rich cultural heritage.
The Commandos apparently
acted out of deep frustration.
For over sixty years, the Arme
nian people have peacefully
tried to intorm the world about
the Genocide of 1915 in which
one and one-half million
Armenians, over halt the entire
population of Armenians, were
massacred by the Turks.
Insuing Turkish govern
ments have fabricated the alibi
that the Armenians had to be
punished because they sup
ported Russian troops who in

vaded Turkey through the
Caucasus.
This claim is contrary to the
documented reports of the
British Bryce and Toynbee, the
French Pinon, the German
Lepsius, and the Americans
Morgenthau and Gibbons.
Armenians fell victim to the
concept of "Turkey for Turks
only" which ran rampant in the
early twentieth century. World
War I gave the Turks the oppor
tunity to solve the "Armenian
Question" once and for all
while the rest of the world was
at war.
There is a disturbing similar
ity between this action and
Germany's use of the shelter of
World War II to deal with the

")ewish Problem." Yet, Ger
many has since recognized the
Jewish Holocaust whereas the
Turkish government has un
ceasingly refused to acknow
ledge all references to the
Armenian Genocide.
The Armenian community,
including the Armenian Cul
tural Association at Stanford,
works peacefully to present
the Armenian cause. Unfortu
nately, the effect of Ahmet
Benler's assasination will not
end with the October 15 AP re
port.
Innocent Armenian families
in Turkey will now pay heavily
with harassment, beatings and
taxations as they have in the
past.
In the wake of Premier De
mirel's reassumption of power
and a rise in Turkish
nationalism, we are especially
concerned about the unwar
ranted reprisals against Arme
nians in Turkey.
