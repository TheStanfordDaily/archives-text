# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Dorosin Adjusting to new circumstances? 
### 
Feeling strange? Bewildered? A little
"off center" perhaps?
Most all students here have some
"newness" in their circumstances in start
ing a new year, whether it be a new univer
sity, a new country, a new dorm, new
roommates, new courses or a new major.
People usually respond to change with a
mixture of feelings.
You can think of this experience as a
"crisis of transition" which occurs tem
porarily when people suddenly are in a
new place. During this period ot transi
tion, you might notice several things in
your feelings, thoughts and behavior.
Perhaps you feel exhilarated over an ex
perience which confirmed your expecta
tions of Stanford one moment, and yet
later have a pang of sadness thinking
about the familiarity of your room at
home.
It's natural to have mixed or even com
peting feelings in situations that matter a
great deal. For example, a sleepless night
may result from a combination of excite
ment about all that happened that day and
some worry about what the next day might
bring.
I ry to discriminate between the various
states of heightened emotion which you
experience; and try to define whether you
are feeling exhilarated, interested, uncer
tain, anxious or overloaded.
You will often experience heightened
feelings as novelty mobilizes not only
positive expectations and hopes, but fears
and uncertainties as well.
Some insure the accuracy of their in
tormation by "checking it out" with other
sources. Some want to share information
with others, and find the process of shar
ing helpful in clarifying issues. Some want
to get it all now. Still others wish to be told
what's most important so that they can
organize this information overload.
You've probably already discovered that
some of your expectations about this year
at Stanford were more accurate than
others.
You also might note some differences in

how you behave. Some find that they
withdraw in a new environment, dealing
with new circumstances more deliber
ately.
In testing new waters, they want to stick
a toe in rather than jump in. Others en
gage in a flurry of activity, talking to
everyone, going every place, reading ev
erything. Still others find themselves more
irritable and impatient with people.
Vou might find yourself experimenting
more.
You can try on "new selves" with
people, seek new experiences, try your
hand at developing new skiils, or take
courses in areas which have not interested
you in the past. These experiments are an
opportunity to learn about yourself, your
interests, and your capacities.
Vou may experience conflicts of values
when you are away from that which is
familiar and when you are confronted with
new people who think and behave diffe
rently than yourself. The novelty of such
experiences can be both interesting and a
bit disorienting.
Social, moral and sexual values can be
challenged, or you can even confront im
portant value decisions that have not yet
been resolved.
We are certain that the next few months
will be challenging ones for you, and that
there will be ups and downs. The follow
ing suggestions might help ease your ad
justment and increase your skill in adapt
ing to new circumstances.
1) Maintain continuity of pleasurable
past activities. For example, if you have
been a jogger then continue jogging.
Don't stop now when you need it most. If
you've enjoyed bull sessions, then find
some people and start some here. If you
have enjoyed listening to music in private,
do so.
2) Spend some time getting a handle on
things by sitting down, getting "cen
tered," and organizing what you have to
do. Do one thing at a time. Finish one
before starting another.
3) Friends are assets — for information,

for support

hand at developing new skiils, or take
courses in areas which have not interested
you in the past. These experiments are an
opportunity to learn about yourself, your
interests, and your capacities.
Vou may experience conflicts of values
when you are away from that which is
familiar and when you are confronted with
new people who think and behave diffe
rently than yourself. The novelty of such
experiences can be both interesting and a
bit disorienting.
Social, moral and sexual values can be
challenged, or you can even confront im
portant value decisions that have not yet
been resolved.
We are certain that the next few months
will be challenging ones for you, and that
there will be ups and downs. The follow
ing suggestions might help ease your ad
justment and increase your skill in adapt
ing to new circumstances.
1) Maintain continuity of pleasurable
past activities. For example, if you have
been a jogger then continue jogging.
Don't stop now when you need it most. If
you've enjoyed bull sessions, then find
some people and start some here. If you
have enjoyed listening to music in private,
do so.
2) Spend some time getting a handle on
things by sitting down, getting "cen
tered," and organizing what you have to
do. Do one thing at a time. Finish one
before starting another.
3) Friends are assets — for information,

for support
