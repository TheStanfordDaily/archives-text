## Who's worried about prestige? 
### 
I was pleased to see that Fred
Hargadon discounted the im
portance of a survey showing
that Stanford ranked 17th
nationwide in median SAT
scores ("Stanford SATs still
high," Daily, Oct. 18). It's
hoped that Hargadon would
have similarly dismissed the
results had Stanford phced

first by 100 points.
The survey in question
couldn't have merit: SATs
don't denote much, except
maybe luck. Nor is the fact that
many high-scoring students
don't choose to go here (or
some other college) revealing.
Top students, whether they be
at Harvard, Stanford or UCLA,
are probably fairly equivalent.
But even had the survey used
another criterion, its results
probably would have been use
less. Ranking schools doesn't
communicate anything and at
worst it is misleading and de
structive.
Unfortunately, I have much
experience on this issue. I was
prestige-oriented in high
school. When applying to col
leges I checked all the surveys,
studies and reports, trying to
find the "No. 1" school. I
didn't realize that academic
departments can't be ranked
like football teams.
I finally chose Vale. Perfect.
It was supposed to be tops in
my field, humanities. The only
problem was that I hated it.
Prestige had made too much of
the place.
One couldn't enter the En
glish department building
without seeing posted some
survey showing Yale as No. 1
(other surveys were tastefully
omitted).
Such a survey could not re
veal, of course, that many En
glish and literature courses

were poorly taught by famous
professors.
When trying to decide to
which school I should transfer,
I again consulted a number of
surveys. Harvard, Princeton,
MIT, Stanford and Berkeley
were all top-ranked some
where.
As it turned out, the best way
to distinguish between these
turned out to be specific
criteria: locations, facilities,
programs. I'm quite happy
here and have had far better
luck with courses.
I still haven't freed myself
from prestige-consciousness,
however. No one need remind
me that I could get a pretty
comparable education at UCLA
at a savings of $5,000 per an
num.
The current popularity of
such surveys, I think, has a
foundation of two compo
nents.
First, sports culture is do
minant here. If our presidential
candidates use football and
baseball analogies, why
shouldn't academians publish
polls analogous to the weekly
UPI and AP NCAA ratings?
Secondly, it is easier for the
public to comprehend
academic excellence through
numbers than through qual
ities. Indeed, it isn't easy for a
high school senior to decide
exactly what it means to say
Harvard is No. 1.
No. 1 in what? And why?

Who says so? What does No. 1
entail, anyway? These ques
tions are difficult to answer.
There's a lot to be said lor the
absence of prestige. It oftens
means a lessening of egotism
and a devotion to teaching on
the part of professors. Of
course, there's much to be said
for prestige, also. Rut there's
nothing to be said for polls in
dicating prestige.
The tendency to rank col
leges can be amusing. Last
year, for example, a freshman
pre-med told me that jersey
College of Medicine at Newark
was the 38th best med-school
in the country, putting it in the
top-third.
Who in the world bothered
to determine that? Probably
the AMA, but why? If all med
schools are accredited, why
rank them?
Certainly some schools are
better than others, but isn't it
better to specify individual ad
vantages than to rank?
Untortunately, this tendency
isn't constructive and can in
deed be dangerous. It pro
motes negative competition be
tween universities. The Ameri
can academic community is all
too much in an ivory tower of
isolation. It can scarcely afford
to divide itself over survey re
sults that are probably spuri
ous.
