Door is not open
Contrary to the impression
that might have been conveyed
in the Oct. 19 Daily, the recent
mascot vote does not "leave
the door open for those who
want the Indian brought
back."
As I said in my Oct. 8 KZSU
Campus Conference session,
"The Indian Mascot is not re
turning to Stanford, period!"

Stop anti-choice
Many thanks to Dawn Up
church and the Pro-Choice Al
liance for a fine column on the
pro-choice movement. I wish
to expand on some of their
comments by stressing the
urgency with which we must
demand pro-choice legislation
and votes from all our legis
lators.
We must not begin to take
for granted the legal access to
family planning and abortion
which we now have. The cur
rent federal and state funding
restrictions are a severe attack
on reproductive freedom.
The only way to protect
these hard-won rights will be
by making sure officials at all
levels of government repre
sent the pro-choice majority.
Two years ago the Hyde
Amendment cut off nearly 99
percent of federal abortion
funding by allowing assistance
only for victims of rape and in
cest, for pregnancy endanger
ing a woman's life, and for pre
gnancy likely to cause "severe
and long-lasting physical
health damage."
This year House anti-choice
leaders are arguing (success
fully) that this same language is
nearly synonymous with
"abortion-on-demand."
Remember that such lan
guage does not allow for fund

ing for, as examples, middle
aged women, women whose
mental health would be en
dangered, women carrying an
embryo known to be diseased
nor for teenagers.
The Hyde amendment and
such further restrictions are
clearly driving poor women
and teenagers back to the
"alley-abortionists" and un
wanted parenthood.
Those legislators voting
against poor women's rights to
choice are responding to in
tensive lobbying by groups
representing a minority opin
ion.
These anti-choice groups
state that they intend to elect
enough anti-choice legislators

so that, in the words of Rep.
Henry Hyde, (D-lll.) "we can
return to the pre-Jan. 22, 1973
days when abortion was a
crime." (National Catholic Re
gister, Aug. 5).
Write your legislators, keep
track of their voting records,
and campaign for pro-choice
candidates.
We must all take a moment
to remember back to before
the Supreme Court decision
and then, very clearly, very
loudly, and very often, female
and male, send our message to
every "Mr. Hyde": "Never
again!"
