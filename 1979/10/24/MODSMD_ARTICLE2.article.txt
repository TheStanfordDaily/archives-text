# Student loan default rate minimal here
## 
### Jim Sakamoto 
The University's default rate on
student loans is now down to 5 per
cent, one-half the national 10 per
cent average at American univer
sities, according to Ken Kaufman,
loan officer in the Financial Aids Of
fice.
"We have the problem very much
in control," he said.
Since 1976, when the University
was suffering an alarming increase in
the default rate on student loans
from the National Direct Student
Loan (NDSL) program, the Tinancial
Aids Office has adopted a tighter,
more business-like policy when
lending to students. This change in
policy has been the major factor in
abating the default rate, Kaufman
explained.
He said the new policy includes
improvement of the internal ac
counting system and formation of a
new department concerned only
with loan collection. Before 1976,
only one person was in charge of col
lecting student loans. This new office
allows more employees to pursue
each individual case more rigor
ously.
If a student is delinquent in making
a payment, the University mails him a
letter of reminder. In instances
where a student makes no attempt to

contact the University, the case may
be relinquished to collectors after a
120-day period.
New contract in making
In addition, the University is com
pleting a new contract with a national
corporation that intorms business
corporations of individuals' credit
ratings.
This new contract will allow the
University to inform the credit
agency of those students whose de
fault cases have been assumed by a
collection agency, reported Joseph
|edd, bursar in charge of student fi
nancial affairs.
With the threat of a poor credit
rating hanging over their heads, bor
rowers should pay more attention to
paying back loans, Jedd said.
Deficits loom
Since 1966, when the NDSL prog
ram was first started, Stanford has
accumulated a deficit of $659,000 in
defaulted student loans. Under this
program, the government subsidizes
$9 for every $1 which the University
lends to a student. So the actual
amount which the University is still
trying to collect is approximately
$66,000.
An $857,000 deficit resulting from
defaults on loans which Stanford has
given students from its own funds
has also been incurred. Thus, the

University is still attempting to col
lect a total of $923,000, according to
Jedd.
On the national level, $1 billion in
student loans has been handed out
over the past 20 years under NDSL
and Guaranteed Student Loan prog
rams, which have yet to be collected
by the government, according to
Charles Banks, information officer
for the Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare.
One of the major reasons why de
fault rates on student loans from uni
versities is so high is because stu

dents don't think a loan from a uni
versity entails as much responsibility
as does a loan from a bank or a lend
ing institution, said Kaufman.
Credit rating plays an important
role in this distinction, he added. A
default on a bank loan would im
mediately be referred to a credit
agency. But, if a student defaults on a
school or government loan, many
times his credit rating remains intact
and will not reflect the default.
For this reason, Kaufman said the
new University contract with the
credit agency will help to further
lower the default rate here.
