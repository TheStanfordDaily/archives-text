# Press slights women according to Mills

With the fire that has marked her years
as a journalist, Kay Mills, an editor at the
Los Angeles Times and a former Profes
sional Journalism Fellow here, spoke on
the relationship between women and the
press at a noon lecture at Terman last
week.
"I was being interviewed by Ben Bradlee
for a job with the Washington Post. I told
him the Post's coverage of the women's
movement stunk. I didn't get the job," she
said.
About 120 persons attended the speech,
the third in a weekly series sponsored by
the Center for Research on Women
(CROW) here.
"The press is an eyeglass through which
people view the world. It can magnify or
distort," she said.
Mills described the late 1960s as a period
in which most politically minded women
would not talk to the press.
Press coverage needed
"Women now realize they need press
coverage if their movement is going to ac
complish anything at all," she said.
Ten years ago, editors wouldn't even
consider covering the women's move
ment unless they felt it was doing some
thing "politically newsworthy," Mills said.
These editors are finally being made to

realize that "The women's movement is aIL
political. The movement deals with shift
ing roles, that is power, and power is what
politics is all about."
Despite this realization, women's politi
cal organizations still are not getting seri
ous media coverage, according to Mills.
"The LA. Times is the only major news
paper in the country which publicly sup
ported an extension of the voting deadline
for the Equal Rights Amendment," Mills
noted, "but even it lacks concern at
times,"

Citing an instance of this lack of con
cern, Mills said that "The morning follow
ing ]ane Byrne's mayoral victory in
Chicago, our paper ran the following front
page headline: ' Tiny Blonde Has the
Clout in City of Big Shoulders.'"
The article opened with a reference to
Mrs. O'Leary's cow starting the Chicago
fire of a century ago, and compared this to
Chicago being "Byrned" more than a cen
tury later. Mayor Byrne was described as
"a 44-year-old diminutive mother . . .* a

housewife that made it big. They didn't
even mention her name until the fifth
paragraph," Mills said.
"With coverage like this, how seriously
can readers be taking our legitimate con
cern as women?" she added.
Several months ago, the L.A. Times
editorial staff discussed the possibility of
an editorial on spousal rape. "One male
colleague turned to me and asked if it
would be considered rape if a man
threatened to cut off his wife's allo
wance," she said.

The women's movement's courting of
the press, according to Mills, "has made
us become much like the others. Our
movement has allowed itself and the press
to designate leaders."
"The press gave Phyllis Schlaffly equal
time when she didn't represent an equal
amount of opinion. Now she deserves the
attention due to the size of her following,
thanks to the media. I hope the time will
come when I forget how to spell Phyllis
Schlaffly," she added.
