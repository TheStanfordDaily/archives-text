## The 						plight of Craig Fertig: how not to fire a coach 
### 
Ivan Maise

Oregon State head foot
ball coach Craig Fertig was
fired Monday. That in itself
is not much of a surprise.
The Beavers are 0-7 this year
and Fertig is 7-33-1 in his
three-and-one-half years in
Corvallis. No matter how
"successful" a coach's
program might be, the bot
tom line is that he is only as
successful as his last win.
On the list of secure jobs,
college football head coach
lies somewhere between a
Latin American dictator and
a kamikaze pilot. With few
exceptions, there is no
middle ground: you either
win or you are shown the
door — or kicked out of it.
In Fertig's case, no one
could find the door — there
was that kind of confusion.
Two weeks ago, Oregon
State athletic director Dee
Andros recommended to
the university's administra
tion that Fertig be fired. An
dros could not tire Fertig; he
just recommended that he
be fired.
That is somewhat akin to
putting a noose around Fer
tig's neck and refusing to
kick the chair out from
under him, for on the cor
porate ladder of college ath

letics, Andros is more or
less Fertig's superior.
Andros' superior, univer
sity President Dr. Robert
Mac Vicar, was out of the
country while all of this was
happening. Since it is he
who does the hiring and the
firing, Fertig was left dangl
ing for the past two weeks.
Mac Vicar resolved the
issue Monday — sort of. He
fired Fertig, but only effec
tive at the termination date
of the coach's contract,
which is December 31,1980.
Fertig will finish out as head
coach this season, then
serve in a yet-unnamed
capacity until his contract
runs out.
Thus, Fertig's chair is fi
nally kicked out from under
him — but only one leg at a
time.
What does all this matter?
The bottom line is win, win,
win and the one thing Fertig
did not do is win. The crux
of the matter is that the
Oregon State administra
tion handled this with all the
grace of Inspector
Clouseau. The damage
done to an already teetering
football program is incom
prehensible — not to men
tion the state of morale of

the group of young men
playing for Fertig.
Fertig's Pac-10 head
coaching brethren tread
rather lightly when asked
about the plight ot the
Beaver head coach. It was as
if the angel of death had vis
ited the house down the
street and they did not want
to attract his attention on his
flight home.
"It seems like this confer
ence has had its share of
controversy this year,"
Stanford head coacfc Rod
Dowhower said, referring
to the suspension-firing of
Arizona State head coach
Frank Kush. "It is difficult at
best for the whole team and
the program."
"You're not in this pro
fession to do a lousy job,"
California head coacb Roger
Theder said.
The coaches were all in
agreement on the fact that
the OSU administration
mishandled the situation.
"I think one of the evils of
college tootball right now —
maybe of all sports, maybe
it's our way of life — is that
everybody is quick to say 'I
confess, he did it,' " USC
head coach lohn Robinson
said. "It's a phenomenon

that seems to be happening.
People are willing to aban
don him (Fertig). They are
oblivious to the feelings of
the players and the
coaches."
Theder concurred with
his coaching opponent of
this Saturday. "It would
have been nice to allow the
guy (Fertig) to finish the sea
son. To do it in the middle ot
the year may have an effect
on the way his team per
forms," the Cal coach said.
Though he has been at his
job the least amount of time
of all the conference
coaches, the usually re
served Dowhower was
quite vocal in his tongue
lashing of the OSU ad
ministration's procedures.
"It seems like there's
more there than meets the
eye," Dowhower said.
"Anytime you fire a coach
under those circumstances
on a collegiate level, you're
really asking for problems
because kids look to the
coach for leadership.
"I just don't see the value,
when dealing with young
men, of changing coaches
in the middle of the sea
son," he continued. "I
don't know whose ass

they're trying to save.
"We say we're interested
in providing young men
with an education and all,
but then loyalty and things
like that go by the wayside,"
Dowhower added.
The only thing left to find
out is whether or not the
Oregon State players can
pick up the pieces through
the remainingfourgamesof
the season. Thev get their
first chance Saturday
against Stanford.
"You never know what
kind of effect these things
have," Dowhower said,
"but we need to win."
Upon hearing of Andros'
recommendation two
weeks ago, one OSU player
said he would never forgive
the administration for what
they did. That kind of at
titude is not the attitude of a
winning football program.
But then the actions of the
OSU administration were
not those of a winning foot
ball program either.
Maybe it's appropriate
that a team as riddled with
ineptitude as Oregon State
would suffer an administra
tion that could not fire a
coach without fumbling the
ball.
