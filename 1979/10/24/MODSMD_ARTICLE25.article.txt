# Booters ravage Gaels, 8-0
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Moraga — It was not your
run-of-the-mill soccer game.
How else do you describe an
8-0 victory in which winner and
loser alike clear the benches?
Such was the case as Stan
ford beat winless St. Mary's to
raise its record to 10-3-1 overall
and 3-1 in the Pacific Soccer
Conference.
The victory puts the Cardi
nals in second place, behind
2-0 Santa Clara and ahead of 2-1
University of San Francisco and
Fresno State. San )ose State
University, 2-2, is fourth in the
league.
Willie Cuicci, who saw his
nine-game scoring streak end
Saturday in a 3-0 shutout at the
hands of Fresno, initiated the
Stanford barrage, with an assist
by Dan McNevin.
Ted Rafalovich put in two
consecutive goals in the next
dozen minutes, the first on a
double assist by Jon Hecht and
McNevin, the second unas
sisted.
Rafalovich then assisted
sweeper Greg Delgado with a
tally four minutes later.
Stanford's final score of the
half came in the last five mi
nutes on a shot by Abe Dras
sinower, assisted by Barry Lin

nett.
The Cards continued to
threaten the Gaels' goal from
the start of the second half,
chalking up a score four mi
nutes into the half by Dras
sinower, assisted by Bill Hof
fenberg.
With less than 10 minutes
remaining, McNevin dribbled
into the St. Mary's goal area to
record an unassisted score.
The final Card goal came
on a pass by Hoffenberg to Fred
Benz, who scored a minute and
a half before the gun.
Kandy Farris, St. Mary's
first-year head coach,
explained that this is "a build
ing year," and noted the
number of young players on
his squad, mostly freshmen
and sophomores.
"It was a decent showing —
last year it was 10-0," Farris ad
ded. "Our season is all defeats,
but we're improving on the
scores. Stanford played a good
game."
Besides the decisive confer
ence victory, the most impor
tant aspect of the mismatch
was to give the starters confi
dence in the "Stanford swirl,"
a pass-oriented style of play
patterned after the successful

Dutch whirl of the Holland na
tional team.
"I think we needed the win
for the conference and confi
dence," observed Lodge. "We
had particularly good perfor
mances from Abe and our de
fense— St. Mary'sonlygottwo
shots.
"It's the first time against a
'lower opponent' that we
didn't play down to their
level," Lodge added. "We kept
our poise."
After flying to Southern
California today for matches
with Westmont this afternoon
at 3 p.m. and tomorrow with

UC-Santa Barbara at 3 p.m.,
Stanford returns to the Penin
sula to take on the front
running Broncos at Buck Shaw
Stadium Sunday at 1:30 p.m.
As for the Stanford ratings
after two losses in a row to San
Francisco State and Fresno,
Lodge predicted the Cards
would stay in the top ten, but
would probably drop from last
week's school high'of fourth to
eighth.
Beating Westmont and Santa
Barbara could reverse that
trend, especially since Santa
Barbara beat Fresno earlier this
season.

sisted.
Rafalovich then assisted
sweeper Greg Delgado with a
tally four minutes later.
Stanford's final score of the
half came in the last five mi
nutes on a shot by Abe Dras
sinower, assisted by Barry Lin

nett.
The Cards continued to
threaten the Gaels' goal from
the start of the second half,
chalking up a score four mi
nutes into the half by Dras
sinower, assisted by Bill Hof
fenberg.
With less than 10 minutes
remaining, McNevin dribbled
into the St. Mary's goal area to
record an unassisted score.
The final Card goal came
on a pass by Hoffenberg to Fred
Benz, who scored a minute and
a half before the gun.
Kandy Farris, St. Mary's
first-year head coach,
explained that this is "a build
ing year," and noted the
number of young players on
his squad, mostly freshmen
and sophomores.
"It was a decent showing —
last year it was 10-0," Farris ad
ded. "Our season is all defeats,
but we're improving on the
scores. Stanford played a good
game."
Besides the decisive confer
ence victory, the most impor
tant aspect of the mismatch
was to give the starters confi
dence in the "Stanford swirl,"
a pass-oriented style of play
patterned after the successful

Dutch whirl of the Holland na
tional team.
"I think we needed the win
for the conference and confi
dence," observed Lodge. "We
had particularly good perfor
mances from Abe and our de
fense— St. Mary'sonlygottwo
shots.
"It's the first time against a
'lower opponent' that we
didn't play down to their
level," Lodge added. "We kept
our poise."
After flying to Southern
California today for matches
with Westmont this afternoon
at 3 p.m. and tomorrow with

UC-Santa Barbara at 3 p.m.,
Stanford returns to the Penin
sula to take on the front
running Broncos at Buck Shaw
Stadium Sunday at 1:30 p.m.
As for the Stanford ratings
after two losses in a row to San
Francisco State and Fresno,
Lodge predicted the Cards
would stay in the top ten, but
would probably drop from last
week's school high'of fourth to
eighth.
Beating Westmont and Santa
Barbara could reverse that
trend, especially since Santa
Barbara beat Fresno earlier this
season.
