Interest rates hit 15 percent
New York — Several major U.S. banks, faced
with high costs of acquiring funds, yesterday
raised their prime lending rates on business
loans to a record 15 percent.
Analysts expect the rest of the nation's
biggest banks to follow suit in a few days.
Only two weeks ago, the nation's major
banks raised the rate they charge for loans to
their most credit-worthy corporate borrowers
by an unprecedented full percentage point, to
14.5 percent.
Morgan Guaranty Trust, the fifth-largest
U.S. bank, in ranking by deposits, was the first
of the big banks to post the half-point rise
yesterday.
It was soon joined by more than a dozen
commercial banks, including most of the 15
largest.
Many banks in several areas of the nation,
have cut back lending or raised interest rates
for consumer credit such as installment loans
or home mortgages.
Carter urges China trade pact
Washington — President jimmy Carter sent
to Congress yesterday a trade agreement
granting most-favored-nation treatment to
China, giving it tariff advantages not yet availa
ble to the Soviet Union.
In letters to the presiding officers of the Se
nate and House, Carter said, "Conclusion of
this agreement is the most important step we
can take to provide greater economic benefits
to both countries from this relationship.
"It will also give further impetus to the prog
ress we have made in our overall relationship
since normalization of our diplomatic relations
earlier this year."
The agreement should make possible an ex
pansion of U.S.-China trade to $5 billion a year
by 1985, up from $1.2 billion last year, said
Kempton Jenkins, deputy secretary of com
merce for East-West trade.
Nuclear moratorium rejected
Washington — A presidential commission,
while highly critical of those involved in the
Three Mile Island nuclear accident, has con
cluded that safety problems do not warrant a
halt in construction or licensing of new reac
tors, according to panel sources.
The 12-member commission completed its
six-month investigation sharply divided over

the issue of whether to call for a moratorium
on new reactor construction until its safety
recommendations are acted upon.
One source said yesterday the moratorium
question encompassed "a long involved dis
cussion that went on for three days" with the
six supporters of a moratorium one vote shy of
getting it approved.
The commission's findings and recommen
dations, which are only advisory, will be pre
sented to President jimmy Carter, probably
next Tuesday. The president has said he hoped
to follow up on the panel's recommendations
"where practical."
Nuclear industry representatives said yes
terday they were relieved the moratorium was
not approved.
"It would have been something that we
would have been up in arms about," said Carl
Walske, president of the Atomic Industrial
Forum. He said a moratorium on future con
struction, "would have done great damage"
since it would have jeopardized a number of
planned projects.
Some nuclear critics, meanwhile, were dis
appointed that the commission is not making a
stronger statement on the future of nuclear
power.
Labor vote fails to oust Begin
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and his conservative Likud bloc defeated
live no-confidence motions in Parliament yes
terday, winning the support of former Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan who had resigned in a
dispute over Israeli settlements on occupied
Arab land.
All five no-confidence motions were de
feated by a single vote of 59-47.
No-confidence motions offered by opposi
tion parties are a routine feature of the winter
opening of the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
But these came at a time when Begin's control
seemed fragile — following Dayan's weekend
resignation and a Supreme Court ruling that a
government-approved West Bank settlement
was illegal.
Begin summoned traveling members of the
Likud bloc back to Jerusalem to meet the chal
lenge and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman
broke off a trip to Egypt to be present. In its
motions, the Labor Party opposition, which
did not make a major effort to rally its forces for
the vote, called for immediate elections and

the government's resignation.
Earlier, Dayan announced he would help de
feat the ouster moves.
"I will vote for confidence in the govern
ment I served until an hour ago,'' Dayan told a
new conference.
Ex-prof heads peace mission
Beirut, Lebanon — U.S. State Department
senior advisor Philip Habib, a guest professor
at Stanford last year, flew into Beirut yesterday
on a double-pronged peace mission aimed at
defusing the southern Lebanon trouble spot
and broadening the Mideast peace talks.
The bald, bespectacled Habib, an old hand
at Mideast politics, was to travel to Syria, Jor
dan, Israel and possibly France and the Vatican
in a bid to arrange an international conference
on Lebanon.
"Mr. Habib's dual mission also is aimed at
reactivating the Mideast peace process on a
broader horizon," a Lebanese official said.
"He's expected to arrange a parallel to the
Camp David peace accords." .
U.S. senators visit Cambodia
Bangkok, Thailand — Three U.S. senators will
go to Phnom Penh today with a new proposal
to aid Cambodia's starving people. They will
be the first U.S. officials to visit the capital
since the communist takeover in April 1975.
Senators James Sasser (D-Tenn.), John Dan
forth (R-Mo.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.)
would like to get a green light from the Phnom
Penh government for their plan of sending
truck convoys carrying a daily load ot 1000 tons
of food into the country from Thailand for six
months.
Although aid programs have begun for the
estimated 2 million people who face starva
tion, Phnom Penh continues publicly to refuse
aid from agencies who also supply areas con
trolled by ousted Premier Pol Pot. The re
mnants of Pol Pot's supporters are waging a
guerrilla war against the Heng Samrin govern
ment that was installed by Vietnam last winter.
Ex-Shah enters N.Y. hospital
New York — The deposed Shah of Iran, said

weeks, began extensive tests in one of the
world's top hospitals yesterday after U.S. offi
cials allowed him to enter the country for med

ical treatment.
Shah Mohammad Reza Pablavi, who will be
60 on Friday, was described as appearing weak

after a flight from his place of exile in Cuer
navaca, Mexico.
Traveling with himwerehiswife,a retinueof
personal bodyguards, and two Doberman
pinscher guard dogs.
Responding to an unofficial description of

Interest rates hit 15 percent
New York — Several major U.S. banks, faced
with high costs of acquiring funds, yesterday
raised their prime lending rates on business
loans to a record 15 percent.
Analysts expect the rest of the nation's

banks raised the rate they charge for loans to
their most credit-worthy corporate borrowers

U.S. bank, in ranking by deposits, was the first

Nuclear moratorium rejected
Washington — A presidential commission,
while highly critical of those involved in the
Three Mile Island nuclear accident, has con

halt in construction or licensing of new reac

The 12-member commission completed its
six-month investigation sharply divided over

the issue of whether to call for a moratorium
on new reactor construction until its safety
recommendations are acted upon.
One source said yesterday the moratorium
question encompassed "a long involved dis
cussion that went on for three days" with the
six supporters of a moratorium one vote shy of
getting it approved.
The commission's findings and recommen
dations, which are only advisory, will be pre

next Tuesday. The president has said he hoped
to follow up on the panel's recommendations
"where practical."
Nuclear industry representatives said yes

Labor vote fails to oust Begin
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and his conservative Likud bloc defeated
live no-confidence motions in Parliament yes

Arab land.
All five no-confidence motions were de

No-confidence motions offered by opposi

But these came at a time when Begin's control

Begin summoned traveling members of the
Likud bloc back to Jerusalem to meet the chal

broke off a trip to Egypt to be present. In its
motions, the Labor Party opposition, which
did not make a major effort to rally its forces for
the vote, called for immediate elections and

the government's resignation.
Earlier, Dayan announced he would help de

"I will vote for confidence in the govern

Ex-prof heads peace mission
Beirut, Lebanon — U.S. State Department
senior advisor Philip Habib, a guest professor

on a double-pronged peace mission aimed at
defusing the southern Lebanon trouble spot

The bald, bespectacled Habib, an old hand
at Mideast politics, was to travel to Syria, Jor

in a bid to arrange an international conference
on Lebanon.
"Mr. Habib's dual mission also is aimed at
reactivating the Mideast peace process on a

"He's expected to arrange a parallel to the
Camp David peace accords." .
U.S. senators visit Cambodia
Bangkok, Thailand — Three U.S. senators will
go to Phnom Penh today with a new proposal
to aid Cambodia's starving people. They will
be the first U.S. officials to visit the capital
since the communist takeover in April 1975.
Senators James Sasser (D-Tenn.), John Dan
forth (R-Mo.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.)
would like to get a green light from the Phnom
Penh government for their plan of sending
truck convoys carrying a daily load ot 1000 tons
of food into the country from Thailand for six
months.
Although aid programs have begun for the
estimated 2 million people who face starva
tion, Phnom Penh continues publicly to refuse
aid from agencies who also supply areas con
trolled by ousted Premier Pol Pot. The re
mnants of Pol Pot's supporters are waging a
guerrilla war against the Heng Samrin govern

Ex-prof heads peace mission
Beirut, Lebanon — U.S. State Department
senior advisor Philip Habib, a guest professor
at Stanford last year, flew into Beirut yesterday
on a double-pronged peace mission aimed at
defusing the southern Lebanon trouble spot
and broadening the Mideast peace talks.
The bald, bespectacled Habib, an old hand
at Mideast politics, was to travel to Syria, Jor
dan, Israel and possibly France and the Vatican
in a bid to arrange an international conference
on Lebanon.
"Mr. Habib's dual mission also is aimed at
reactivating the Mideast peace process on a
broader horizon," a Lebanese official said.
"He's expected to arrange a parallel to the
Camp David peace accords." .
U.S. senators visit Cambodia
Bangkok, Thailand — Three U.S. senators will
go to Phnom Penh today with a new proposal
to aid Cambodia's starving people. They will
be the first U.S. officials to visit the capital
since the communist takeover in April 1975.
Senators James Sasser (D-Tenn.), John Dan
forth (R-Mo.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.)
would like to get a green light from the Phnom
Penh government for their plan of sending
truck convoys carrying a daily load ot 1000 tons
of food into the country from Thailand for six
months.
Although aid programs have begun for the
estimated 2 million people who face starva
tion, Phnom Penh continues publicly to refuse
aid from agencies who also supply areas con
trolled by ousted Premier Pol Pot. The re
mnants of Pol Pot's supporters are waging a
guerrilla war against the Heng Samrin govern
ment that was installed by Vietnam last winter.

world's top hospitals yesterday after U.S. offi
cials allowed him to enter the country for med

ical treatment.
Shah Mohammad Reza Pablavi, who will be
60 on Friday, was described as appearing weak
and moving with a slow, shuffling gait when he
arrived at LaGuardia Airport on Monday night
after a flight from his place of exile in Cuer
navaca, Mexico.
Traveling with himwerehiswife,a retinueof
personal bodyguards, and two Doberman
pinscher guard dogs.
Responding to an unofficial description of
the shah as gravely ill, a spokesman at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said,
"there is no truth to it at all."

Francisco's 5600 teachers and paraprofession
alsendedyesterdayaftera small groupofaides
joined the teachers in approving a new con
tract calling for the rehiring of hundreds of
laid-off teachers.

whom are represented by the San Francisco
Federation of Teachers, voted 59-76 to reject
the contract. After meeting with union presi
dent Jim Ballard, the aides voted 140-43 for
approval.
The 3600 teachers and 2000 paraprofession
als were due to return to their jobs today in the
58,700-pupil school district.

Interest rates hit 15 percent
New York — Several major U.S. banks, faced
with high costs of acquiring funds, yesterday
raised their prime lending rates on business
loans to a record 15 percent.
Analysts expect the rest of the nation's
biggest banks to follow suit in a few days.
Only two weeks ago, the nation's major
banks raised the rate they charge for loans to
their most credit-worthy corporate borrowers
by an unprecedented full percentage point, to
14.5 percent.
Morgan Guaranty Trust, the fifth-largest
U.S. bank, in ranking by deposits, was the first
of the big banks to post the half-point rise
yesterday.
It was soon joined by more than a dozen
commercial banks, including most of the 15
largest.
Many banks in several areas of the nation,
have cut back lending or raised interest rates
for consumer credit such as installment loans
or home mortgages.
Carter urges China trade pact
Washington — President jimmy Carter sent
to Congress yesterday a trade agreement
granting most-favored-nation treatment to
China, giving it tariff advantages not yet availa
ble to the Soviet Union.
In letters to the presiding officers of the Se
nate and House, Carter said, "Conclusion of
this agreement is the most important step we
can take to provide greater economic benefits
to both countries from this relationship.
"It will also give further impetus to the prog
ress we have made in our overall relationship
since normalization of our diplomatic relations
earlier this year."
The agreement should make possible an ex
pansion of U.S.-China trade to $5 billion a year
by 1985, up from $1.2 billion last year, said
Kempton Jenkins, deputy secretary of com
merce for East-West trade.
Nuclear moratorium rejected
Washington — A presidential commission,
while highly critical of those involved in the
Three Mile Island nuclear accident, has con
cluded that safety problems do not warrant a
halt in construction or licensing of new reac
tors, according to panel sources.
The 12-member commission completed its
six-month investigation sharply divided over

the issue of whether to call for a moratorium
on new reactor construction until its safety
recommendations are acted upon.
One source said yesterday the moratorium
question encompassed "a long involved dis
cussion that went on for three days" with the
six supporters of a moratorium one vote shy of
getting it approved.
The commission's findings and recommen
dations, which are only advisory, will be pre
sented to President jimmy Carter, probably
next Tuesday. The president has said he hoped
to follow up on the panel's recommendations
"where practical."
Nuclear industry representatives said yes
terday they were relieved the moratorium was
not approved.
"It would have been something that we
would have been up in arms about," said Carl
Walske, president of the Atomic Industrial
Forum. He said a moratorium on future con
struction, "would have done great damage"
since it would have jeopardized a number of
planned projects.
Some nuclear critics, meanwhile, were dis
appointed that the commission is not making a
stronger statement on the future of nuclear
power.
Labor vote fails to oust Begin
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and his conservative Likud bloc defeated
live no-confidence motions in Parliament yes
terday, winning the support of former Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan who had resigned in a
dispute over Israeli settlements on occupied
Arab land.
All five no-confidence motions were de
feated by a single vote of 59-47.
No-confidence motions offered by opposi
tion parties are a routine feature of the winter
opening of the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
But these came at a time when Begin's control
seemed fragile — following Dayan's weekend
resignation and a Supreme Court ruling that a
government-approved West Bank settlement
was illegal.
Begin summoned traveling members of the
Likud bloc back to Jerusalem to meet the chal
lenge and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman
broke off a trip to Egypt to be present. In its
motions, the Labor Party opposition, which
did not make a major effort to rally its forces for
the vote, called for immediate elections and

the government's resignation.
Earlier, Dayan announced he would help de
feat the ouster moves.
"I will vote for confidence in the govern
