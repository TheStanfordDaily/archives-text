A 20-station conditioning trail, designed to give
students and faculty members "recreation and rela
xation," was installed near Angell Field last week, said
Ray Young, associate athletic director here.
The unpaved trail starts on the southwest side of
Angell Field and features 20 stations. At each station
the jogger must complete a series of exercises de
signed to develop the cardiovascular system, in
crease muscle strength and flexibility and release
stress tension.
The trail is equipped with bars, steps, posts and
other equipment to be used in conjunction with the
various exercises.
The trail is not paved between the stations, but
general directions to the next station are given on
each green sign.
Young said Gamefield Concepts donated the $5500
conditioning trail to the University. Stanford paid the
cost of installation, estimated to be $3200, and will
pay for the upkeep of the trail.
"Basically we're just a sales pitch for them," Young

said. "Some classes may use it, but its main purpose is
just for recreation and relaxation."
Mitch Meneged, president of Gamefield Concepts,
said the trail was designed by leading physiologists,
physicians and psychologists and will provide excel
lent physical and psychological benefits with regular
use.
The jogger may vary the difficulty level of each
exercise by choosing to ' play for fun," "play for a
workout" or "play for competition." The trail winds
its way past the tennis courts, around the football
stadium and past the deCuerre pools.
The trail, which is available for public use, provides
equipment for exercising the entire body and in
cludes the following 20 stations in order: Slalom
Reach, Hamstring Stretch, Hop and Stretch, Thigh
Stretch, Leg Lifts, Dips and Saddlebag Reducer, Side
jump, Push-ups, Trunk Stretch, Hurdle Bridge,
Chin-ups, Sit-ups, Achilles Strength, Step and Hop,
Hopping Wheel, Monkey Climb, Thigh Roll, Double
Achilles Stretch and Stress Release Closing.


The new multi-station conditioning trail at Angell Field is
now open to all who wish to test their endurance. The trail
