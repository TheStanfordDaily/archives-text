# Patterson, gorillas move off campus

Say goodbye to Koko the gorilla.
As soon as Koko and her friend
Michael recover from their simian
bouts with the flu, their trainer Dr.
Francine "Penny" Patterson will
move them to off-campus facilities in
the foothills.
Assistant Provost Patricia Devaney
explained that, because Patterson
received her Ph.D. from Stanford in
the spring, she no longer has a for
mal affiliation with the University.
Therefore, she and her research
assistants, not to mention the two
gorillas, were asked by the University
to move off campus.
But it will be an unwilling move for
Patterson, who has gained nation
wide recognition for teaching Koko
and Michael more than 375 words in
sign language.
Mike Hudnall, staff counsel for the
University, explained that there was
simply not enough interest expres
sed by members of the Psychology
Dept. to continue sponsoring Patter
son's research project.
Quality questioned
Chairman of the Psychology Dept.
Cordon Bower was quoted in yester
day's San lose Mercury as saying that
her research was "not that high a
quality," a comment which took Pat
terson straight to her attorney.
"There may be a number of reper
cussions from that statement," Pat
terson said, adding that Bower's
comment was "unintelligent and un
fair."
Bower prepared a statement last
night saying he did not "intend to
convey the negative impression of
that article."
Patterson "launched on a program
of research that presented certain
difficulties concerning subjects and
housing of the project," he stated.
"The University and the Psychology
Department have been supportive of

the project for a number of years.
"However, Miss Patterson com
pleted her Ph.D. dissertation in
Spring 19/9. She has been urged
several times to make long-range
plans for the future of her project.
"The department felt that the re
search program would profit most by
moving to some other setting, where
more adequate facilities would exist
for the continuation and expansion
of the project.
"We (the Department) wish her
well in relocating and continuing her
research program and we look for
ward to seeing the findings from it."
Bower said that no one at the Uni
versity was willing to assume full re
sponsibility for the program now that
Patterson has completed her Ph.D.
work, although there are many pro
fessors who are "sympathetic" to the
project.
Tension mounted
"I had an unusual dissertation pro
ject," Patterson retorted. "I was get
ting a lot of pressure from the Uni
versity to finish up, and, as a result, I
had to let the project suffer. About
six months of the data was not as
complete as I would have liked."
She claimed the University was
pushing her to finish because she
was setting "a bad example.
"People were thinking 'She can
take longer than four years to finish
her degree, so why can't I?' " Patter
son explained.
Move subsidized
The University asked Patterson to
leave Stanford grounds by Aug. 1.
Hudnall said that, although he never
filed an eviction order nor took any
legal action, he had been in contact
with Patterson and had been referred
to her Oakland attorney when he
learned in September that she was
planning to leave campus by mid-
October.
Her move to a six-acre lot in the
Stanford foothills is being funded by
a grant from the David and Lucille
Packard Foundation, Patterson said.
National Geographic will film the
move, she added.
Most of Patterson's research is
being tunded by various non-profit
organizations, including her own
Gorilla Foundation.
