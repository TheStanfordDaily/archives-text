# NSF finances student-originated projects
## Research funding available to undergrads 
### Boh Deyling 
Many undergraduates here dream
of participating in research projects,
but most students think that project
funding is available only to profes
sors and a few lucky graduate stu
dents. There is a government organi
zation, however, which exists solely
to give undergraduates the oppor
tunity to pursue their research in
terests.
The National Science Foundation

(NSF) Student-Originated Studies
Program (SOS) is designed to pro
vide teams of college students with
experience in independent, self
directed study in which they initiate,
plan and direct their own summer
research activities with minimal
supervision.
Each project must be problem
oriented, seeking an understanding
of and possible solutions to a local
problem or issue of public policy that
has immediate relevance to society.
In recent years financial support
has been given to projects on natural
resource utilization, pollution
studies, waste disposal, transporta
tion, health care, land use and design
studies for improving the safety and
longevity of consumer products.
Two research projects have been
conducted by student groups here in
the past few years.
Aged study
Last summer about 20 Stanford
students joined forces to study
hospital-based home care for the el
derly. Project director Karen (K.C.)
Englehardt and her team are cur
rently putting the finishing touches
on their final report to be published
sometime next year.
Englehardt is completing work on
adoublemajorin human biologyand
psychology. She summarized her en
thusiasm and thoughts on the re
search experience in a recent inter
view.
"The opportunity to be exposed to
the rigors and realities of research
early in our careers is an invaluable
experience," she said.
The team found research could be
"challenging and exciting, frustrat
ing and at times downright frighten
ing. It was very hard work, but we
gained a sense of accomplishment
and an attitude of 'can do' that will
influence each of us for a long, long
time," she said.
Vast cooperation
"We hope the data we generated
this summer can be used to add to
the existing information on how we,
as a society, can best address the
myriad health needs of our elderly,"
she added.
Thirteen paid members worked on
the team. The $16,309 NSF grant co
vered most operating expenses of
the project, as well as a stipend for
eight of the paid members. Five
others received compensation
through the local Veterans Administ
ration hospital, which took an active
interest in the project.
A number of volunteer members
were also involved, including some
graduate students.
"The support and willingness to

cooperate on the part of the entire
Stanford community was the only
way we could have pulled it off ." En
glehardt said. The group interviewed
over 150 people in the course of its
research, including person' from all
over the Bay Area as well as ai the
Andrews Research Center at the Uni
versity of Southern California
Not just rote learning
"Ours was more than just a
textbook exercise in the study of the
aging process," Englehardt
explained. "It was a totally engulfing
experience which looked at complex
social problems first hand. We
studied the feasibility of family con
tributions to the cost of health care
for the elderly and the difference in
needs between males and females,
to name a few aspects of the study."
The group also designed a pilot

'The opportunity to be exposed to the rigors and
realities of research early in our careers is an
invaluable experience/

project for training of home health
care personnel. The final report,
originally 75 pages, has blossomed
into a 300-page book as data con
tinues to be compiled and analyzed.
Two team members are now teach
ing SWOPSI courses on the aging
process, two are in Human Biology
workshops concerning aging, two
are writing honors theses and one
has decided to major in gerontology,
the study of aging.
Foul air vs. health
Another study was funded for
Stanford students in 1971 when Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham,
then an undergraduate here, was the
project director for a study inves
tigating the effects of air pollution on
the health of students at
California universities.
The team concluded that air pollu
tion may well be responsible for a
16.7 percent increase in respiratory
ailments.
The study received more than
$20,000 in NSF funds.
Durham said he feels the experi
ence of working on the research
team was his most important learn
ing experience as an undergraduate.
Since then he has vigorously encour
aged his students to submit propos
als.
"This research opportunity is a
very rare one, and it is ironic that very

few prof osals are even submitted,"
Durharr. saic. "Indeed, most stu
dents dc> Vt even realize that they can
possibly hope to do research as an
undergraduate â€” much less get
money tu do it."
The siudy which Durham headed
had its find! report published in a sci
entific journal. It was later used as a
source foi the formation of pollution
control i-;encies in California. "It is a
rare distinction for students to be
published autnors as under
graduates," Duiham said.
He ssid that many project mem
bers wrote honors theses/elated to
their research experience. Others
pursued careers in related fields.
And Dl rham, like the directors of all
projects was invited to Washington,
D.C., lo serve on the evaluation
committee for the following year's

proposals.
Multi-pronged gain
"Working on one of these projects
i<> an invaluab'- educational and per
sonal experience tor students in
volved," he maintained, "but the
taxpayers also benefit by providing
funds for the project. Dollar for dol
lar the payoff in terms of scientific
personnel improvement must far ex
ceed their (NSF's) estimates."
In fiscal year 1979, 178 proposals
were submitted to SOS. The total
dollar amount requested was $2.68
million, while the program was able
to support 69 projects at a cost of
almost $1 million. The same level of
funding is expected in the coming
year.
Proposals may be submitted in any
combination of scientific disciplines,
but the approach to collection,
analysis and eventual application of
the data gathered must be interdis
ciplinary in nature.
The actual proposal should de
scribe the scientific research the stu
dent group wishes to carry out and
give a detailed account of funds that
will be required for that purpose.
Upon completion of projects, the
team must submit a final report on
the project, both to provide a factual
account of the project and to give
NSF the opportunity to assess the
project's effectiveness.
