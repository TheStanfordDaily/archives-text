## Senators unite to pass SALT II treaty 
### 
Washington (AP) — After ini
tial success in defeating
amendments certain to have
killed the Salt II treaty, Senate
supporters of the pact are try
ing to construct a coalition to
make sure it is ratified.
"For a treaty that was sup
posed to be dead, there's a lot
going on," one Senate aide
remarked. "It's like an Irish
quilting bee and they haven't
quite decided on the shape of
the quilt."
Some of the SALT II
quiltmakers include a panel of
senators appointed by Senate
Majority Leader Robert Byrd
to try to work out a formula to
ease concerns and attract the
votes of the largest possible
number of senators.
One proposal is an increase
in defense spending to ease
worries over what many see as
a growing Soviet military
threat.
In addition to adding sub
stantial amendments, treaty
opponents are also trying to
slow the process down to keep
the pact from coming to the
Senate floor anytime soon, de
laying it enough to throw the
issue into the uncertain eddys
and currents of the 1980 politi
cal season.
On Friday, Sen. John Tower,
(R-Tex.), objected seven times
to requests to permit the
committee to continue work
on the treaty during Senate
sessions. Byrd complained of
the delaying tactics and re
marked, "the senator from
Texas has backslid to the point
that he is just unsavable."
At his news conference
Saturday, Byrd said senators
who oppose the treaty "ought
to hit the issue head on." He
said that once the pact is voted
out of the committee, debate
on the Senate floorshould take
no more than three weeks.

The majority leader's GOP
counterpart, Senate Republi
can Leader Howard Baker,
has been heading the fight in
side the committee to amend
the text of the treaty.
Baker was outvoted in his
first bid to alter the pact with an
amendment offering a formula
to count the Soviet backfire
bomber as a strategic weapon.
After seeing the amendment
defeated 9-6, Baker said if that
margin prevails on the Senate
floor, SALT II will be denied the
two-thirds vote needed for
ratification.
"Amending the treaty is a
way to kill it," Byrd told repor
ters. "That treaty should be
voted on up or down."
The committee is adding a
numberof understandings and
reservations to the separate re
solution of ratification and
Byrd said he has no objection
to such actions which would
not force new negotiations.
