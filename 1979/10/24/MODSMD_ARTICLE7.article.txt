# Turkish elections mirror doubt

### 
Ankara, Turkey (AP) — Tur
key, a key NATO ally, faces an
uncertain future after national
elections that generated more
questions than answers.
The immediate result of the
October 14 balloting was the
resignation of Premier Bulent
Ecevit's 21-month-old leftist
government.
But no party now commands
a majority in parliament. Al
though Ecevit has joined
others in calling for a "strong
and effective" new govern
ment, the likelihood is a weak
coalition possibly unable to
take swift action.
Such is the case at a time
when Turkey, whose 30-year
experiment with democracy
has twice been interrupted by

military intervention, faces dif
ficulties at home and abroad,
including:
—Inflation approaching 100
percent.
—Mile-long gas lines.
—Shortages of several es
sential goods including coffee,
light bulbs and medicine.
—Terrorism that resulted in
100 deaths a month during
Ecevit's term and the imposi
tion of martial law in 19 pro
vinces.
American bases
—Negotiations with the Un
ited States over four key
American defense bases and
American use of Turkey's air
space to monitor the SALT II
agreement, and
—Difficult talks over the dis
pute in Cyprus where 18,000

Turkish troops have been
stationed since 1974.
Six-time former premier
Suleyman Demirel and his cen
trist justice Party were the big
winners in the election, captur
ing 47 percent of the vote. But
the midterm balloting involved
only about a third of the na
tion's 20 million eligible voters,
and Demirel is said to favor
new general elections in an ef
fort to win a clear mandate.
Staging such elections won't
be easy, however, even though
the voter turnout in the recent
election was high: 73 percent
despite threats by terrorists.
Traditionally, national elec
tions are held in the spring be
cause of the difficulty of cam
paigning and voting during the
harsh Turkish winter.
'Good will'
A Turkish Foreign Ministry
official said in an interview
Wednesday that there was
"good will" between the Un
ited States and Turkey in ef
forts to reach a new defense
agreement by Jan. 9.
But the same official warned
that Turkey does not intend to
keep the four bases open
without an agreement.
Turkey closed down the four
bases in 1975 after Congress
imposed an arms embargo on
Turkey following its invasion of
Cyprus. However, the bases
were subsequently reopened
and now are of greater impor
tance to the United States be
cause of its intelligence losses
in neighboring Iran.
