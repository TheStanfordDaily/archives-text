# Hoover fellow charges
## U.S. vulnerable to terrorism 
### Carol Rose 
America remains "poorly
prepared" to deal with nation
ally disruptive acts of ter
rorism, according to Darrell
Trent, associate director and
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Trent recently co-authored
(with Robert Kupperman) a
new Hoover Institution Press
book entitled, Terrorism:
Threat, Reality, Response.
The United States is a likely
target for terrorist attacks be
cause "We stand for every
thing that the terrorists hate:
imperialism, colonialism,
capitalism and the exploitation
of emerging nations," he said.
"Since the United States is
the most open country, it is
possible to move freely, and it
is easy to evade prosecution, as
the Hearst case illustrated," he
contended. The freedom of
the press translates into grea
ter publicity for terrorist ac
tivities, which is their goal,
Trent said.
Why haven'twe been hit yet ?
One reason, he asserted, is
that "security and law en
forcement are better here thun
in some countries. The policy
of no prisoner release and no
negotiation is also a deterrent
to terrorists. They want to have
their demands met but also
have their freedom. Our policy
mitigates that."
"In the Mideast, it is easier to
travel from country to country,
and escape prosecution than
in the United States," accord
ing to Trent. Vet, "as turopean
nations step up their fight
against terrorism, often at the
cost of civil liberties, America's
open society will attract
foreign terrorists, both as a
land of exile and as a stage for
new terrorist activities," he
said.
Price we pay
Even in the United States,
"we pay a price in the sacrifice
of human liberties to provide
for protection against ter

rorism," he said. "It costs each
passenger as he must undergo
X-ray searches in this country
before boarding an airplane. In
the Far East, one is subject to as
many as three searches."
Security measures also con
tribute to unreasonable search
and seizure threats because it
is "hard to find bomb factories
without searching homes,"
Trent said.
Of utmost importance,
however, is that the United
States retain all of its civil liber
ties even at the greater risk of
an attack, he argued. "The ter
rorists want change, therefore
our response should not be
their victory. The integrity of
the system is the most impor
tant thing."
International crisis
"The thrust of the threat is
also transnational," Trent
claimed, "creating interna
tional friction between the
governments of different
countries. Since the laws vary
in each country, terrorists
often use the contrasting laws
of various countries to escape
punishment," he explained.
American extradition
treaties do not discourage ter
rorists, as political prisoners
are not subject to them. Thus
"the problem of this policy is a
lack of clear definition of the
term political prisoner. One
man's freedom fighter is
another's terrorist," Trent said.
Moreover, terrorism "poses
a possibility of an end in con
tinuation of some govern
ments," he said.
For example, 300 hostages
were taken by a group of Pales
tinian and West German hijac
kers to Entebbe, Uganda in
)une 1976 to be exchanged for
fifty political prisoners from
five countries. Because Israel
practiced a policy of non
negotiation, the possibility of
losing those hostages existed.
"If those 300 people had
been murdered, the govern
ment of Israel would have fal

len from the internal public
reaction," Trent said.
No individual solutions
Terrorism can no longer be
halted by merely ameliorating
each group's political prob
lems, such as furnishing a
homeland for the Palestinians,
according to Trent.
"Most of the terrorist groups
have lost their political iden
tity, so that the professional
terrorists have merged into
one network of about 200 pro
fessionals and 6000 backups.
They train together and have
the high technology weapons,
supplied by the communist
block countries, particularly
Czechoslovakia," he said.
Since the goals of terrorist
groups are no longer political,
Trent identified the terrorist
goal as "nihilism, the destruc
tion of whatever government is
in power."
Carter tries his hand
In an attempt to stem ter
rorism in the United States
President Jimmy Carter has
created a Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
Although FEMA represents a
step in the right direction,
there are many "logistic" dif
ficulties plaguing the agency,
according to Trent.
"There are 28 federal agen
cies involved, and there is no
central leader. They are short
of funds and, consequently, of
the research that is needed to
combat terrorism" he said
"FEMA is only equipped to
deal with the consequences of
a terrorist attack. What is
needed is a way to deal with the
incident while it is in prog
ress," he added.
"There is a need for practical
application," he noted. "We
do not know if we would effec
tively deal with an attack since
we can never test the system.
An international system would
provide this training."
No "catch-all solution" is av
ailable, Trent emphasized.
"The government bureaucracy
prevents an adequate com
mitment to preparedness.
After the first major terrorist
incident, we will realign the
system. Unfortunately, what is
needed now is a government
that is active, instead of reac
tive," he said.

They train together and have
the high technology weapons,
supplied by the communist
block countries, particularly
Czechoslovakia," he said.
Since the goals of terrorist
groups are no longer political,
Trent identified the terrorist
goal as "nihilism, the destruc
tion of whatever government is
in power."
Carter tries his hand
In an attempt to stem ter
rorism in the United States
President Jimmy Carter has
created a Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA).
Although FEMA represents a
step in the right direction,
there are many "logistic" dif
ficulties plaguing the agency,
according to Trent.
"There are 28 federal agen
cies involved, and there is no
central leader. They are short
of funds and, consequently, of
the research that is needed to
combat terrorism" he said
"FEMA is only equipped to
deal with the consequences of
a terrorist attack. What is
needed is a way to deal with the
incident while it is in prog
ress," he added.
"There is a need for practical
application," he noted. "We
do not know if we would effec
tively deal with an attack since
we can never test the system.
An international system would
provide this training."
No "catch-all solution" is av
ailable, Trent emphasized.
"The government bureaucracy
prevents an adequate com
mitment to preparedness.
After the first major terrorist
incident, we will realign the
system. Unfortunately, what is
needed now is a government
that is active, instead of reac
tive," he said.
America remains "poorly
prepared" to deal with nation
ally disruptive acts of ter
rorism, according to Darrell
Trent, associate director and
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Trent recently co-authored
(with Robert Kupperman) a
new Hoover Institution Press
book entitled, Terrorism:
Threat, Reality, Response.
The United States is a likely
target for terrorist attacks be
cause "We stand for every
thing that the terrorists hate:
imperialism, colonialism,
capitalism and the exploitation
of emerging nations," he said.
"Since the United States is
the most open country, it is
possible to move freely, and it
is easy to evade prosecution, as
the Hearst case illustrated," he
contended. The freedom of
the press translates into grea
ter publicity for terrorist ac
tivities, which is their goal,
Trent said.
Why haven'twe been hit yet ?
One reason, he asserted, is
that "security and law en
forcement are better here thun
in some countries. The policy
of no prisoner release and no
negotiation is also a deterrent
to terrorists. They want to have
their demands met but also
have their freedom. Our policy
mitigates that."
"In the Mideast, it is easier to
travel from country to country,
and escape prosecution than
in the United States," accord
ing to Trent. Vet, "as turopean
nations step up their fight
against terrorism, often at the
cost of civil liberties, America's
open society will attract
foreign terrorists, both as a
land of exile and as a stage for
new terrorist activities," he
said.
Price we pay
Even in the United States,
"we pay a price in the sacrifice
of human liberties to provide
for protection against ter

rorism," he said. "It costs each
passenger as he must undergo
X-ray searches in this country
before boarding an airplane. In
the Far East, one is subject to as
many as three searches."
Security measures also con
tribute to unreasonable search
and seizure threats because it
is "hard to find bomb factories
without searching homes,"
Trent said.
Of utmost importance,
however, is that the United
States retain all of its civil liber
ties even at the greater risk of
an attack, he argued. "The ter
rorists want change, therefore
our response should not be
their victory. The integrity of
the system is the most impor
tant thing."
International crisis
"The thrust of the threat is
also transnational," Trent
claimed, "creating interna
tional friction between the
governments of different
countries. Since the laws vary
in each country, terrorists
often use the contrasting laws
of various countries to escape
punishment," he explained.
American extradition
treaties do not discourage ter
rorists, as political prisoners
are not subject to them. Thus
"the problem of this policy is a
lack of clear definition of the
term political prisoner. One
man's freedom fighter is
another's terrorist," Trent said.
Moreover, terrorism "poses
a possibility of an end in con
tinuation of some govern
ments," he said.
For example, 300 hostages
were taken by a group of Pales
tinian and West German hijac
kers to Entebbe, Uganda in
)une 1976 to be exchanged for
fifty political prisoners from
five countries. Because Israel
practiced a policy of non
negotiation, the possibility of
losing those hostages existed.
"If those 300 people had
been murdered, the govern
ment of Israel would have fal

len from the internal public
reaction," Trent said.
No individual solutions
Terrorism can no longer be
halted by merely ameliorating
each group's political prob
lems, such as furnishing a
homeland for the Palestinians,
according to Trent.
"Most of the terrorist groups
have lost their political iden
tity, so that the professional
terrorists have merged into
one network of about 200 pro
fessionals and 6000 backups.
They train together and have
the high technology weapons,
supplied by the communist
block countries, particularly
Czechoslovakia," he said.
Since the goals of terrorist
groups are no longer political,
