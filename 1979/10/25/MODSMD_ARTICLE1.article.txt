# Middle-East development spurs talk

### Dave Rugh 
The resignation of Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Dayan last Sunday and
the decision on Monday by the Israeli
Supreme Court against the govern
ment's illegal seizure of Arab land left
the government headed by Prime
Minister Menachem Begin in what
many consider a precarious position.
The resignation came in response to
what Dayan called Begin's continued
intrasigence on the Palestinian issue.
Dayan had previously said over Is
raeli radio that, "In my opinion, in the
final analysis, the Middle East conflict
between us and the Arabs will not be
totally solved as long as the refugee
problem is not settled."

In a television interview, Dayan
explained his "Four Points" plan which
called for the unilateral withdrawal of
Israeli military authorities from the oc
cupied West Bank and an evacuation of
Israeli military forces from Arab popu
lation centers.
Dayan also recommended the dele
gation of municipal authority to local
Palestinian councils.
Reaction here to Dayan's resignation
was mixed.
Rabbi Mark Cartun of the Hil lei
Jewish Center remarked, "I totally
agree with his (Dayan's) Four Points
plan. . . . Although he is nominally a
'hawk' he is the most astute (Israeli)
cabinet member on the Arab prob
lem. ... I'm really sad to see him go. I
wish Dayan had been in charge all
along," he added.
Hamad al-Ba'ady, president of the
Arab Students Association here said,
"The opposition will be better served
by Dayan. Dayan is not doing this as a
humanist, it is more for practical
reasons, for he has contributed as
much to the misery of the Palestinians
as anyone else."
Al-Ba'ady added that the Palestinian
Arabs included on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip comprise about 40 percent
of the total population of Israel. Al-
Ba'ady said the Arabs would soon be in
the majority in Israel because ot their
birth rate, one of the highest in the
world.
His desire for a breakthrough in the
negotiations notwithstanding, Dayan
left no doubt about his position that
. . under no circumstances will we
meet with the PLO."
He said that the goals of the PLO
include . . the right of refugees to
return to their lands and homes. . . and
the liberation of Palestine which in
cludes what is now Israel."
Dayan said that Israel would not par
ticipate ". . . in any issue connected in
one way or another with laying the
foundation for the establishment of a
Palestinian state."
Dayan's definition of autonomy con
trasts with the predictions of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat who said,
"Three years after the establishment of
a Palestinian entity the Palestinians will
participate in determining their future.
After the elections the Palestinians will
shoulder their full responsibility."
Whatever the outcome of the Dayan
resignation, Begin's hard line position
has apparently lost much of its support.
Dayan has been criticized for his
meetings with PLO sympathizers in Is
rael but has replied that, "I only
wanted to know— and only as it per
tains to them— how they regard the
common life with Israel.
"The question is," he said, "what
patterns of life can we set up which
would be acceptable to both parties,
and no side— either Jews or Arabs—
would regard themselves as receiving
the worse lot, be it in Jerusalem, Gaza,
or any other place. . .
