# Religion at Stanford: still a force?
## 
### Maria Higuera 
Second of (wo parts
Even primitive man had it —
religion, that is— but what
about the Stanford student in
these latter years of the twen
tieth century?
One student interviewed ar
dently claimed, "Cod is awe
some," to which his friend re
plied, "A lot of religions are
bogus, though."
Another conversation was
sprinkled with the word
"god," it turned out to be a
recap of the Stanford-USC
football game.
Stereotypes
"There's a ridiculous myth
that people who are involved
in religious organizations are
kind of eccentric," said senior
Sandra Shanker, a member of
the social action committee of
Hi I lei, "but that's simply not
true."
Rabbi Mark Cartun sup
ported Shanker's view: "A lot
of people think that the stu
dents in religious organiza
tions are weirdos or some
thing. Actually, they're often
among the most popular, most
well-liked students."
The force that brings indi
viduals into religious organiza
tions varies from one person to
the next.
Junior Tony Tsai got involved
with Campus Crusade through
a friend who led him to Christ.
Describing his conversion, Tsai
said, "Basically what happens
is that a little light turns on in
side of you. My inspiration
came through the people I was
living with, but my becoming a
Christian was primarily be
cause of a ch:mge in my heart."
One of the five o; six Or
thodox jews at the University,
junior Mark Barak attributes
his practice primarily to his
background: "My father tried
to bring me up as Jewishly as he
could."
With one exception, Barak
has been extremely observant
all his life. "When I came to the
University my freshman year,
the first thing I did was rebel. I
became a secularist. I re
member the night of my ad
visor's dinner was the first time
I had ever been in the car on
the Jewish sabbath. It was
traumatic." Barak laughs easily
about it now.
Graduate student Holly
Mclntyre candidly stated, "It's
not just by chance that I wan
dered into Memorial Church
one day." As a Reformation
historian, she said, "My own
studies have been very condu

cive to religion." Almost
everyone in her field is in
volved with one church group
or another.
Fellowship
Once a student feels enough
interest to one of
the organizations ii<?re, the
magnetism of the community
often holds him there. "The
Stanford Jewish community,
though it's not too observ
able, is very vibrant," said Barak.
"As a Christian, you need to
have some fellowship in a de
signated group," Tsai

explained, "And the main
reason for the group is to get a
bunch of people funneling all
of their energy into one area."
This energy often gets re
channeled into the organiza
tion of campus-wide activities,
community service or social ac
tion. A member of the Oppres
sed )ewry Committee, senior
Brian Rosman explained, "An
important part of our religion is
social action; we're concerned

with |ewish survival."
In the sermon at the Univer
sity Lutheran Church, the
guest speaker, Associate Dean
of Memorial Church Ernie
Young spoke about the prob
lems he'd seen during recent
trips to South Africa and
Northern Ireland and about
the importance of conserving
energy.
Lutheran minister Manfred
Bahmann said of some of the
people in his church, "They re
ally don't know if they can for
mulate a clear concept about

God, but they do want to serve
their fellow human beings."
Personalities
Besides offering the warmth
and energy of the community,
a very special group of people
make up the campus clergy. It
is largely because of their per
sonal qualities that the religi
ous organizations are growing
stronger.
One of the most significant
developments in the Universi

ty's religious community since
1974 has been the tremendous
revival of the Jewish religious
presence, according to Dean
of Memorial Church Robert
Hamerton-Kelly. Most obser
vers attribute this growth to
Rabbi Mark Cartun's extraor
dinary energy and charisma.
The image of the clergy as
venerable and unapproacha
ble has broken down in a pro
cess of "depriestification," as
Cartun referred to it. "We're
not holier than anyone else,"
he added with a smile.
"Man is maturing,"
explained Kamal Zein of the
Baha'i Club; "he doesn't need
an intermediary to come bet
ween him and God."
In spite of the formal grand
eur of the building itself, Kelly
injects humor and warmth into
the Memorial Church services.
Part of Sunday's sermon is
especially for children who sit
gathered around Kelly on the
altar stairs.
"Today we're going to talk
about forgiveness," Kelly be
gins. "Why do you think we
need to forgive each other?"
A boy answers, "Because if
we didn't, we'd always be fight
ing." His perspective is re
freshing; Kelly smiles in ag
reement. When the children
leave the altar, one especially
tiny boy turns to the congrega
tion and waves, "Bye, Mom."
Greater understanding
Through work within the
Stanford United Ministry, the
clergy hopes to create greater
understanding among the re
ligious organizations. "What
unites us in our Judaic-
Christian tradition is far more
important than what divides
us," commented Father Robert
Giguere of the Newman
Center.
"Our common goal is to
raise the consciousness of the
whole university community in
the area of religious, moral and
ethical values. There is cer
tainly no competition for con
verts," he said.
Involved with several ecu
menical (meaning cooperation
among different faiths) social
issues groups, Byron Bland,
Minister of the United Campus
Christian Ministry, believes
that common action unites re
ligious organizations.
In Kelly's opinion, the uni
versity atmosphere facilitated
ecumenical endeavors: "The
University encourages toler
ance and mutual understand
ing."

football game.
Stereotypes
"There's a ridiculous myth
that people who are involved
in religious organizations are
kind of eccentric," said senior
Sandra Shanker, a member of
the social action committee of
Hi I lei, "but that's simply not
true."
Rabbi Mark Cartun sup
ported Shanker's view: "A lot
of people think that the stu
dents in religious organiza
tions are weirdos or some
thing. Actually, they're often
among the most popular, most
well-liked students."
The force that brings indi
viduals into religious organiza
tions varies from one person to
the next.
Junior Tony Tsai got involved
with Campus Crusade through
a friend who led him to Christ.
Describing his conversion, Tsai
said, "Basically what happens
is that a little light turns on in
side of you. My inspiration
came through the people I was
living with, but my becoming a
Christian was primarily be
cause of a ch:mge in my heart."
One of the five o; six Or
thodox jews at the University,
junior Mark Barak attributes
his practice primarily to his
background: "My father tried
to bring me up as Jewishly as he
could."
With one exception, Barak
has been extremely observant
all his life. "When I came to the
University my freshman year,
the first thing I did was rebel. I
became a secularist. I re
member the night of my ad
visor's dinner was the first time
I had ever been in the car on
the Jewish sabbath. It was
traumatic." Barak laughs easily
about it now.
Graduate student Holly
Mclntyre candidly stated, "It's
not just by chance that I wan
dered into Memorial Church
one day." As a Reformation
historian, she said, "My own
studies have been very condu

cive to religion." Almost
everyone in her field is in
volved with one church group
or another.
Fellowship
Once a student feels enough
interest to one of
the organizations ii<?re, the
magnetism of the community
often holds him there. "The
Stanford Jewish community,
though it's not too observ
able, is very vibrant," said Barak.
"As a Christian, you need to
have some fellowship in a de
signated group," Tsai

explained, "And the main
reason for the group is to get a
bunch of people funneling all
of their energy into one area."
This energy often gets re
channeled into the organiza
tion of campus-wide activities,
community service or social ac
tion. A member of the Oppres
sed )ewry Committee, senior
Brian Rosman explained, "An
important part of our religion is
social action; we're concerned

with |ewish survival."
In the sermon at the Univer
sity Lutheran Church, the
guest speaker, Associate Dean
of Memorial Church Ernie
Young spoke about the prob
lems he'd seen during recent
trips to South Africa and
Northern Ireland and about
the importance of conserving
energy.
Lutheran minister Manfred
Bahmann said of some of the
people in his church, "They re
ally don't know if they can for
mulate a clear concept about

God, but they do want to serve
their fellow human beings."
Personalities
Besides offering the warmth
and energy of the community,
a very special group of people
make up the campus clergy. It
is largely because of their per
sonal qualities that the religi
ous organizations are growing
stronger.
One of the most significant
developments in the Universi

ty's religious community since
1974 has been the tremendous
revival of the Jewish religious
presence, according to Dean
of Memorial Church Robert
Hamerton-Kelly. Most obser
vers attribute this growth to
Rabbi Mark Cartun's extraor
dinary energy and charisma.
The image of the clergy as
venerable and unapproacha
ble has broken down in a pro
cess of "depriestification," as
Cartun referred to it. "We're
not holier than anyone else,"
he added with a smile.
"Man is maturing,"
explained Kamal Zein of the
Baha'i Club; "he doesn't need
an intermediary to come bet
ween him and God."
In spite of the formal grand
eur of the building itself, Kelly
injects humor and warmth into
the Memorial Church services.
Part of Sunday's sermon is
especially for children who sit
gathered around Kelly on the
altar stairs.
"Today we're going to talk
about forgiveness," Kelly be
gins. "Why do you think we
need to forgive each other?"
A boy answers, "Because if
we didn't, we'd always be fight
ing." His perspective is re
freshing; Kelly smiles in ag
reement. When the children
leave the altar, one especially
tiny boy turns to the congrega
tion and waves, "Bye, Mom."
Greater understanding
Through work within the
Stanford United Ministry, the
clergy hopes to create greater
understanding among the re
ligious organizations. "What
unites us in our Judaic-
Christian tradition is far more
important than what divides
us," commented Father Robert
Giguere of the Newman
Center.
"Our common goal is to
raise the consciousness of the
whole university community in
the area of religious, moral and
ethical values. There is cer
tainly no competition for con
verts," he said.
Involved with several ecu
menical (meaning cooperation
among different faiths) social
issues groups, Byron Bland,
Minister of the United Campus
Christian Ministry, believes
that common action unites re
ligious organizations.
In Kelly's opinion, the uni
versity atmosphere facilitated
ecumenical endeavors: "The
University encourages toler
ance and mutual understand
ing."

Second of (wo parts
Even primitive man had it —
religion, that is— but what
about the Stanford student in
these latter years of the twen
tieth century?
One student interviewed ar
dently claimed, "Cod is awe
some," to which his friend re
plied, "A lot of religions are
bogus, though."
Another conversation was
sprinkled with the word
"god," it turned out to be a
recap of the Stanford-USC
football game.
