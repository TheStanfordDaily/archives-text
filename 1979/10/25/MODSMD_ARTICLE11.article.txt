# Smokers are 'riskier'
## Insurance discounts predicted 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” An insur
ance executive predicts that
discounts for non-smokers will
spread through the life insur
ance industry because of a
study that showed smokers are
a much riskier group to insure.
The study, by the State
Mutual Life Assurance Co.
which pioneered non
smokers' discounts in 1964, is
the first time any company has
made public death statistics
about policy-holders who
smoked.
"The differences between
the mortality of smokers and
non-smokers are too large to
be ignored ... in individual
life insurance underwriting
and pricing," concluded the
report released last Monday.
It suggests that non
smokers, who are a 2-to-1
majority of adults, be consi
dered the norm and that
smokers be placed in a "sub
standard" risk category.
Approximately 50 of the 1800

U.S. life insurance firms offer
non-smoker discounts, but
none of the 10 firms with the
most business do. State Mutual
ranks among the top 20.
State Mutual President W.
Douglas Bell predicted the
study will "rapidly" convince
more firms to offer discounts,
and ultimately will push the in
dustry to change its standard
life tables to put smokers in a
risk category.
State Mutual compared
deaths among 60,000 non
smoking and 45,000 smoking
customers and found non
smokers died at rates nearly 50
percent below industry expec
tations for the general popula
tion, while cigarette smokers
died at rates 30 percent above
the statistical norm.
That means that, statistically,
the cigarette smokers were
dying at rates 2Vi times higher
than non-smokers, according
to Bell.
Translated into terms of life

expectancy, he said, a 32-
year-old male smoker is ex
pected to die before age 72,
some 7.3 years sooner than a
non-smoking counterpart.
That is wider than the five-year
gap between the sexes in the
industry's life tables, which fi
gure a 32-year-old woman will
live until 79 and a man to 74.
