# Getting around without a car
## 
### Victor Goetz 
A multitude of mass transit systems encircl
ing the Bay Area bring nearly any point within
reach for University students without cars or
looking for a cheap way of getting around.
The City is less than an hourand a half away
on either San Mateo County Transit (Sam
trans) buses or Southern Pacific (SP) trains.
Once in the City, Municipal Transit buses
operate throughout San Francisco while Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART) crosses over to the
east side of the Bay (although service is cur
rently limited by a strike), and Golden Gate
Transit runs north to Marin County. Alameda
County Transit (AC) also covers the East Bay.
San Jose is a short ride away on either Santa
Clara County Transit buses or SP trains.
The average cost from end to end on each
of these systems is just over $1, with SP trains
the most expensive at $2.55 one way from
Palo Alto to San Francisco.
To San Francisco
Samtrans buses begin at Page Mill Road
and run up El Camino. There are several stops
within convenient reach of campus between
Page Mill and Stanford S.lopping Center.
Service begins at 5:25 a.m. weekdays and
6:25 weekends; buses depart approximately
every half hour. Route 7F is the one to take for
a direct ride to the city or the airport 5L is
best for cities in between, such as San Mateo,
since the 7F is an express which runs along
the freeway at Belmont.
lust 55 cents pays for the 50 minute ride on
Samtrans to the airport. The City is $1.10 and
an hour and 20 minutes away.
The final bus to The City leaves Palo Alto at
11:58 p.m. Last bus returning from The City
leaves at 12:49 a.m. and arrives at campus at
2:10 a.m.
SP runs 22 trains a day in each direction
from 5:05 a.m. weekdays and 7:10 a.m.
weekends to 10 p.m. weekdays and 12:35
weekends. The schedule is built around
commuter traffic, with trains running much
more often at rush hours.
The SP station is located off University Ave.
just across El Camino.
Samtrans runs down Mission Street to the
Transbay Terminal. Connections are availa
ble at Transbay to AC across the Bay, Golden

Gate to Marin, Municipal buses, Amtrak and
gambling buses to Reno.
The station is a five minute walk from the
Embarcadero BART station.
Samtrans buses also stop at the Greyhound
station for connections anywhere in the U.S.
SP makes 28 stops along its San Jose to San
Francisco route, terminating at 4th and
Townsend, below Market Street.
To East Bay
When running normally, BART is probably
the fastest, easiest way to cross the Bay.
Management staff are running eight trains
between 24th street in The City and Lafayette
station in Concord at 30 minute intervals
midday and 16 minutes at commuting hours.
Service goes from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.
Under normal conditions, BART runs bet
ween Daly City, Concord, Richmond and
Fremont. End to end rides cost a little over a
dollar. Downtown S.F. Embarcadero to UC-
Berkeley, for example, takes 85 cents. Trains
would run six minutes apart commuter hours
and 12 minutes midday.
To San Jose
Santa Clara County Transit provides a 25
cent link between Stanford and San jose. A 50
cent express bus from Page Mill Road at El
Camino Real cuts the regular hour and a half
ride to about an hour.
Bus number 22 runs every 10 minutes in
front of Stanford Shopping Center on El
Camino (the express from Page Mill every 30
minutes).
The last express leaves downtown San Jose
at 5:55 p.m.
To get to San Jose airport, transfer from bus
22 to bus 64 at Monroe and Franklin in Santa
Clara city. Just pay the 25 cents and ask the
bus driver for a transfer at bearding.
Additional Service
Every once in a while rumors float around
that BART might be extending its service
through San Mateo County.
According to the BART Coordinations
Dept., however, "there are no official plans
at this time. There were originally all kinds of
plans for the extent of BARTservice. Periodi
cally politicians will revive one of these plans
to run through his area to keep his voters
happy. Plans have not changed."
