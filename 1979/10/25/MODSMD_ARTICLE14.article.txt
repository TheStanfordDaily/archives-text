## Make the senate work 
### 
We have completed yet another ASSU
Senate election and contrary to the re
cent past, the outlook is promising. Stu
dents seem to have elected a well
balanced group of senators.
The large number of candidates and
high percentage of voters demonstrates
an increased interest in the senate. Stu
dents seem to have decided that perhaps
the senate is not as unimportant and
uninfluential as it has been reputed to be
in the past couple of years.
Consequently, students will probably
be expecting more from their senators
than in the recent past.
The 20 senators just elected have a
commitment to the students of the uni
versity — a commitment to act responsi
bly, to solicit student opinion and to
help fulfill the students' needs. These
are not minor commitments, but they
are ones that we hope the newly elected
senators can fulfull.
Many new senators advocated man
datory attendance at senate meetings
and increased interaction with students.
They have promised to make a con
certed effort to talk with students and

solicit their opinions. We can only hope
they will follow through with these as
surances.
The newly elected senators also said
they would concentrate on local issues
and matters of interest to students here.
We hope the senate can achieve an
equitable balance between University
and outside issues, with the priority
given to issues directly affecting the stu
dents here.
Topics of interest to most of the
senators include housing, Tresidder Un
ion, student services, lighting on cam
pus and advising; theseareall issues that
can be addressed by the senate.
A rather difficult issue the senate will
have to resolve is its internal organiza
tion. As evidenced by the election, stu
dents want some kind of change in the
structure of the senate and election of
senators, but they are not happy with
any of the proposals on the fall ballot —
districting, staggered elections and live
petitions. It is up to the newly elected
senators to deal withthisissueandcome
up with an alternative that is acceptable
to a majority of students.
