## Blame Congress, not FDA 
### 
Dale Cieringer's column on
the Food and Drug Administra
tion (Daily, Oct. 21) was re
markable — not so much be
cause it seta record forquoting
me out of context, but because
it repeats a misconception I
frequently encountered dur
ing my tour as Commissioner.
It is that the bureaucracy is
somehow a creator instead of
an executor of regulation.
In fact, regulation is a crea
tion of the Congress and not of
executive agencies. None of
the actions referred to in
Cieringer's column — not
Laetrile, not saccharin, not a
single one — reflects anything
but adherence to a specific
legal requirement.
The 1%2 amendments to the
Food, [Drug and Cosmetic Act
require that new drugs be
proven effective as well as safe

before they can be marketed —
and the Supreme Court re
cently rejected, in a unanim
ous decision, the claim that the
terminally ill were an excep
tion. The 1958 food safety
amendments require that sub
stances intentionally added to
food be proven to be sale be
fore they can be marketed.
And so on.
Those who dislike govern
ment regulation would like to
put the blame elsewhere, so
they can urge that the bureauc
racy be "controlled." There's a
way to do that: get the Con
gress to change the laws.
The real truth is, ot course,
that despite a good deal of
complaining like Cieringer's
there has been little sentiment
in the Congress for a major
loosening of the protections
afforded by existing health and

safety legislation.
It there is really widespread
public support for relying en
tirely on label warning for
handling all the risks as
sociated with substances
added to food, for example, I
have no doubt that Congress
will act accordingly when it
considers the food safety laws
in the next session.
My prediction is that it will
tind that approach inadequate,
as I do. I also predict that even
a reiteration of Congressional
intent will still find Gieringer
blaming the bureaucrats for a
national consensus he doesn't
like. That's all you can do when
you don't have the votes.
(Donald Kennedy, who served
as FDA commissioner for two
years, is Vice President and
Provost.)
