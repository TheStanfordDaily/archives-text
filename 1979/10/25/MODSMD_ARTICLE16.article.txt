## Historical facts vindicate Israel 
### 
Ali Hassan responded to the
Daily column of Debra Leigh on
the Middle East conflicts sup
posedly "for the sake of
academic honesty and human
ity." Examination of Hassan's
column (Daily, Oct. 22) shows it
to lack precisely that honesty.
The people of Israel have had
to defend themselves five times
against Arab wars of annihila
tion; each time they somehow
survived. Continuously since
1948 Israel has called on her
Arab neighbors to make peace
and end the continuous cycle of
violence which has left her sons
dead; each time she had been
met with crocodile tears and re
newed war. Only Egypt has
dared to make peace.
The Israeli economy is collaps
ing with near 100 percent infla
tion as a result of staggering de
fense costs; every Israeli family
prays that its sons will not be
forced to fight a sixth war.
Now the world cries that Israel
should create a Palestinian state
on the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
with Yasir Arafat at its head. Let
me remind Hassan that this
Arafat once declared that "El
Fatah (the striking arm of

Arafat's P.L.0.) is intending to
.. . establish a final solution to
the Jewish problem,'' an un
ashamed allusion to the
euphemism by which Hitler re
ferred to his genocide of six mill
ion Jews.
What separates the "moder
ate" Arafat from his "extremist"
cohorts? Arafat seeks a Palesti
nian state from which he will
work toward the "liberation" of
Palestine, whereas the ex
tremists want to liberate Pales
tine at once. Nevertheless, Israel
has given indications that it will
negotiate even with Arafat
should he declare a moratorium
on killing schoolchildren, setting
bombs in marketplaces and
other terrorist acts.
All Israelis realize that true
peace must include the Palesti
nians— even Prime Minister
Menachem Begin has admitted
as much. But after 31 years of
incessant warfare, Israelis are
very wary of Arabs who claim to
want peace. The edges of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
the site of the proposed Palesti
nian state, are ominously close to
the lewish population centers in
Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem.

Only with the passage of time,
with the alleviation of tensions,
and an atmosphere of trust bet
ween lews and Arabs can Israel
consider returning the West
Bank.
Hassan asserts that Israel prac
tices apartheid, much as does
South Africa. This statement is
misleading at best, an outright lie
at worst. Israel's Arabs enjoy the
same economic and political
rights as do lews, the sole excep
tion being that Arabs are excused
from military service. Israel is
the only state in the Middle East
in which Arab citizens can popu
larly elect representatives to the
national parliament— many
Arabs serve in the Israeli Knesset.
If Israel is apartheid it is in the
sense that it upholds the religious
character of the state, lews sub
mit civil disputes to Jewish
courts of law, Christians to
Christian courts and Moslems to
Islamic courts. It restricts the au
tonomy of the Islamic courts in a
humane sense— for instance, it
will not allow an Islamic court to
chop off a thief's hand as pre
scribed by Islamic law.
All groups have unrestricted
access to their holy places in
Jerusalem, something which did
not occur when Arabs controlled
that city.
Hassan's charge of Israeli
apartheid is especially mislead
ing in the light of the notorious
lack of harmony with which
Arab governments have existed
with their minority populations.
The dominant Islamic majorities
continue to oppose the existence
of most minority groups,
whether they be Kurds in Iraq,
Coptic Christians in Lebanon, or
Jews wherever they be found.
Israel is not, as Hassan claims,
expansionist. Hassan points out
that Israel is larger than it was in
1947 and attributes this growth
to its need to accommodate large
numbers of immigrants. He neg
lects to mention that the vast
majority of these levvish immig
rants, over 700,0000f them, fled
to Israel as a sanctuary from the
oppression of such Arab states as
Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria.
In four of the five so-called
"expansionist wars," Israel was
attacked by vicious Arab
neighbors determined to destroy
her. In the fifth, the 1967 war,
President Camel Abdul-Nasser
of Egypt had kicked out the U.N.
peacekeeping troops, amassed
his entirearmyon Israel's border
with the Sinai, blockaded Israel's
southern ports (a legal act of
war), and announced to the
world, "Our basic aim is the de

struction of Israel."
Israel, which had mobilized
every soldier in the country the
month before in response to
Nasser, believed Nasser was not
lying about his intentions. Israel
launched a pre-emptive strike on
Egypt, which can be called "of
fensive" only with gross neglect
of the intentions of each of the
parties involved.
Hassan's "just and human"
solution is the establishment of a
secular state for all— where
people can live "harmoniously."
The only state in the Middle East
where lews and Arabs have ever
lived harmoniously is Israel.
