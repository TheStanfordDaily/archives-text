# THE STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Tom Pratt America faces crucial decision 
### 
We are living in an exciting
time. Perhaps at no other time
in the last 40 years have the
foundations of modern Ameri
can society seemed as vulner
able as they do now. A severe
reordering of American culture
— tor better or worse — seems
inevitable.
Impossible? Well, it's true
that at first glance 1979 seems
no more exciting than a flat
tire; the amount of depressing
news about the state of the
country and the world is
enough to keep anyone's ad
renalin low.
And as for Stanford, well,
students seem to be caught up

more than ever on the anes
thetizing treadmill toward pro
fessional career while honored
scholars like Peter Duignan tell
us that we need to "build more
tanks than we build cars" or
"the Soviets will overtake us"
(Daily , Oct. 22).
Yet I think that a close look at
our current national situation
reveals a monumentally sig
nificant fact: our faith in
"economic expansionism" —
the foundational concept of
modern America — is faltering,
along with our faith in the polit
ical liberalism that justifies it
and the methodology of sci
ence that undergirds it.
Will we face the reality of the
"age of scarcity" and alter our
national values accordingly, or
will we more firmly entrench
ourselves in our selfish expan
sionists values and be forced
to defend them — with force if
necessary — against an increas
ingly Impoverished world?
Though the latter possibility
is a terrifying one, it is nonethe
less very real. If we choose this
road it is inevitable that
America will feel itself an island
surrounded by a hostile world.
We will need to rely more and
more on military might to sec
ure the raw materials we need
from a world less and less will
ing to supply these materials to
us.
Perhaps even more disturb
ing, within our own nation we
may opt for an authoritarian
model of government. Francis
Schaeffer, a well known Christ
ian theologian, comments
that, "History indicates that at a

certain point of economic
breakdown people cease
being concerned with indi
vidual liberties and are ready to
accept regimentation."
I think our current national
trend toward hero-worship is a
subtle reminder of people's
loss of rationality when societal
problems seem too difficult to
overcome.
But we need not opt for in
creasing expansionism and the
loss of freedom that would ac
company it. I'm confident that
as a nation we won't, and al
ready I see indications that we
may be heading down a more
realistic path.
Political liberalism, the
philosophical foundation of
economic expansionism, is on
the wane. This, is because
liberalism is founded on the
myth that man can find com
plete fulfillment by overcom
ing economic scarcity, thus al
lowing everyone a piece of the
pie.
Along with the decreasing
potency of liberalism as an
ideology, I see a decreasing
faith in technology and science
as expansionistic society's "de
liverers," deliverers that can
keep pulling rabbits out of
laboratories. Technology and
science operate on the as
sumption that the world, in
cluding man, can be reduced
into parts which can then be
manipulated without respect
for the whole.
This attitude shows up in the
old adage, "I'm not interested
in what can't be shown empiri
cally." Unfortunately, this dis

regard for the whole manifests
itself in a depleted and devas
tated environment that be
comes shorter on non
renewable resources daily.
But even this scientific re
ductionism is beingchallenged
in America, primarily by the in
creasing interest in spiritual
values. As a Christian I'm
pleased to see many Americans
searching for a more holistic
view of man than secular sci
ence can offer, as well as a
more holistic view of the world
and the environment.
As Americans begin to re
gard themselves and their en
vironment as complex and
holistic systems, the disregard
scj prevalent today for the envi
ronment and for spiritual val
ues such as sacrificial love can
only diminish.
To put it all together, I think
we can slowly (but not too
slowly) but surely become a na
tion made up of decentralized,
more self-sufficient com
munities where labor intensive
production modes and use of
renewable resources would be
the norm.
As a member of Stanford
Christian Fellowship, I along
with others am beginning to
explore the implications of
these trends for our group, and
I challenge other Stanford stu
dents to evaluate themselves
and their groups in regard to
national direction. Apathy is
the only inexcusable response.
