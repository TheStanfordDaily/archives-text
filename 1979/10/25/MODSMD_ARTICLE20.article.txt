## I don't want to pay for your abortion 
### 
Upon reading the "pro
choice" column concerning
abortion {Daily, Oct. 17) I was
struck by a particular reaction
which I now relay to the
reader. Namely, that tht; col
umn presented arguments
consisting of a confusion of
realities and rights overlaid
with justifications based al
most entirely on fashionability
and convenience.
The column contends that
abortion is a "reality of life" in
that women will obtain
dangerous illegal abortions if
abortion itself is illegal or
otherwise inaccessible be
cause of cost. The cause for
this behavior is implied earlier:
these women are "unwilling"
or "unprepared" to deal with
the "realities of motherhood"
which would impose a "life of
possible frustration and re
sentment."
Apparently we are permitted
to ignore one reality in favor of
another as we please. But there
is an additional "reality" in

volved here: the life of the un
born child. The opposition to
abortion and its funding can
not fairly be described as some
nebulous "conservative
backlash." It is, rather, a
genuine concern over the wel
fare of a defenseless human
life.
To hold up the reality of il
legal abortions as a justification
for federal funding is tan
tamount to threatening suicide
if I refuse to aid you in a mur
der. It is nothing less than
moral blackmail.
The above point brings us to
the issue of freedom of choice.
The claim is that women have
the right to control their own
lives. However, the con
troversy stems not from an op
position to this right as such,
but from the question of what
lives are involved.
Let us recall that the "fetus"
or "embryo" or "child," what
ever the name, is genetically a
human life from conception.
The controversy rests only on

whether it is a worthwhile life.
Thus we are measuring the
rights of one life versus those
of another, where the con
sequences are death for one
opposed to hardship for the
other.
The judicial argument in
volves the previous issue in
sofar as it legally determines
who should decide on the
value of the life to be aborted.
It cites the 1973 Supreme Court
ruling that the woman alone
should be left with the deci
sion. Given this situation, can
we conclude that this confers a
right to federal funding?
To claim such a right is actu
ally a claim to a right to usurp
the product of a citizen's labor
for a purpose he or she finds
morally objectionable on the
grounds that it is murder.
Where then does this leave
freedom of choice?
The final argument supposes
a general philosophical justifi
cation because "pro-choice is
humanistic," apparently be
cause it seeks "to improve the
quality of life for both men and
women." The question is —
how?
How does the "pro-choice"
movement improve the life of
man? The column's arguments
show no concern for this and
ignore the role of the father in
the decision. This peculiar
humanism also regards moral
ity as an encumbrance, no
longer "useful'' and hence to
be discarded.
Morality has never relied

upon expediency but ratheron
a realization that actions have
consequences, good and evil,
and that this occurs in the con
text of individual responsibil
ity.
Finally, this "humanism" in
its benevolent pragmatism
proclaims a belief that "every
person has a right to personal
development." Need I point
out the irony?
On balance, the pro-choice
argument depends on assum
ing that the legal right to
choose is a right to funding
even though this in turn usurps
others' freedom of choice. It
employs tunnel vision by judg
ing acceptable realities accord
ing to convenience.
There is no such thing as a
"mandatory pregnancy" ex
cept in cases of rape, and abor
tion is not necessarily the best
resolution of this exception.
Whatever course is taken,
there is likely to be some suf
fering involved.
But I would hope that we try
to face the realities by positive
measures such as social sup
port services and fuller in
volvement of the father.
No solution is perfect, but
pro-life is not intended to be
anti-woman. It is just what it
says — "pro-life," refusing to
ignore the helpless party.
Thus, while abortion may stand
legal, there is no right implicit
in that to anyone's wages aid
ing it.

No solution is perfect, but
pro-life is not intended to be
anti-woman. It is just what it
says — "pro-life," refusing to
ignore the helpless party.
Thus, while abortion may stand
legal, there is no right implicit
in that to anyone's wages aid
ing it.

Upon reading the "pro
choice" column concerning
abortion {Daily, Oct. 17) I was
struck by a particular reaction
which I now relay to the
reader. Namely, that tht; col
umn presented arguments
consisting of a confusion of
realities and rights overlaid
with justifications based al
most entirely on fashionability
and convenience.
The column contends that
abortion is a "reality of life" in
that women will obtain
dangerous illegal abortions if
abortion itself is illegal or
otherwise inaccessible be
cause of cost. The cause for
this behavior is implied earlier:
these women are "unwilling"
or "unprepared" to deal with
the "realities of motherhood"
which would impose a "life of
possible frustration and re
sentment."
Apparently we are permitted
to ignore one reality in favor of
another as we please. But there
is an additional "reality" in

volved here: the life of the un
born child. The opposition to
abortion and its funding can
not fairly be described as some
nebulous "conservative
backlash." It is, rather, a
genuine concern over the wel
fare of a defenseless human
life.
To hold up the reality of il
legal abortions as a justification
for federal funding is tan
tamount to threatening suicide
if I refuse to aid you in a mur
der. It is nothing less than
moral blackmail.
The above point brings us to
the issue of freedom of choice.
The claim is that women have
the right to control their own
lives. However, the con
troversy stems not from an op
position to this right as such,
but from the question of what
lives are involved.
Let us recall that the "fetus"
or "embryo" or "child," what
ever the name, is genetically a
human life from conception.
The controversy rests only on

whether it is a worthwhile life.
Thus we are measuring the
rights of one life versus those
of another, where the con
sequences are death for one
opposed to hardship for the
other.
The judicial argument in
volves the previous issue in
sofar as it legally determines
who should decide on the
value of the life to be aborted.
It cites the 1973 Supreme Court
ruling that the woman alone
should be left with the deci
sion. Given this situation, can
we conclude that this confers a
right to federal funding?
To claim such a right is actu
ally a claim to a right to usurp
the product of a citizen's labor
for a purpose he or she finds
morally objectionable on the
grounds that it is murder.
Where then does this leave
freedom of choice?
The final argument supposes
a general philosophical justifi
cation because "pro-choice is
humanistic," apparently be
cause it seeks "to improve the
quality of life for both men and
women." The question is —
how?
How does the "pro-choice"
movement improve the life of
man? The column's arguments
show no concern for this and
ignore the role of the father in
the decision. This peculiar
humanism also regards moral
ity as an encumbrance, no
longer "useful'' and hence to
be discarded.
Morality has never relied

upon expediency but ratheron
a realization that actions have
consequences, good and evil,
and that this occurs in the con
text of individual responsibil
ity.
Finally, this "humanism" in
its benevolent pragmatism
proclaims a belief that "every
person has a right to personal
development." Need I point
out the irony?
On balance, the pro-choice
argument depends on assum
ing that the legal right to
choose is a right to funding
even though this in turn usurps
others' freedom of choice. It
employs tunnel vision by judg
ing acceptable realities accord
ing to convenience.
There is no such thing as a
"mandatory pregnancy" ex
cept in cases of rape, and abor
tion is not necessarily the best
resolution of this exception.
Whatever course is taken,
there is likely to be some suf
fering involved.
But I would hope that we try
to face the realities by positive
measures such as social sup
port services and fuller in
volvement of the father.
No solution is perfect, but
pro-life is not intended to be
anti-woman. It is just what it
says — "pro-life," refusing to
ignore the helpless party.
