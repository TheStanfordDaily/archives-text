# Bianchi admits five stranglings

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Quietly
repeating, "Yes, I did," Ken
neth Bianchi admitted taking
the lives of five women in the
"Hillside Strangler" slayings
that terrorized Los Angeles and
was sentenced to six life prison
terms.
"I wish I had the power to
run the sentences consecu
tively, but in this state they
must be merged as a matter of
law, "Superior Court judge
William B. Keene told Bianchi
as he imposed the terms Mon
day.
Bianchi's pleas were part of a
bargain struck with authorities,
allowing him to escape the
death penalty for strangula
tions here and in Washington
state in exchange for his tes
timony against his cousin,
Angelo Buono.
Buono had been scheduled
to be arraigned in connection
with 10 of the slayings after
Bianchi was sentenced Mon
day, but his attorney won a
two-week delay. Attorney
Ronald Bain later said he may
ask to have the case removed
from Southern California,
where the killings occurred be
tween October 1977 and Feb
ruary 1978.
The killings were called the
"Hillside Strangler" slayings
because the victims were
tound dumped on slopes
around Los Angeles and
Glendale. All the victims were
young women.
Bianchi, a former security
guard, also pleaded guilty to a
charge of conspiracy to com
mit murder and kidnap —
which brought another life
sentence — and to one count
of sodomy, for which he re
ceived a five-year term.
Lach count stated Bianchi
committed the crimes "in con
junction with" Buono, a Glen
dale upholsterer.
"I am satisfied with what's
been done," Deputy District
Attorney Roger Kelly said after
Bianchi was sentenced. "Now

we will be able to prosecute
Mister Buono, and that gives
me a great deal of satisfaction."
Bianchi was ordered to the
California Men's Institution at
Chino to begin serving his
prison term. Under state law,
he will be eligible for parole in
seven years.
On Friday, Bianchi told a Bel
lingham, Wash., court he
strangled two Western
Washington University coeds.
He received two consecutive
life sentences there.
After Bianchi's plea and sen
tencing in Superior Court,
Buono made a brief appear
ance in Municipal Court,
where his arraignment on 24
felony charges was continued
to Nov. 5. No plea was entered
during the appearance.
Because "special cir
cumstances" are alleged in
Buono's case that could result
in a death sentence if he is con
victed, Buono was held with
out bail in county jail.
