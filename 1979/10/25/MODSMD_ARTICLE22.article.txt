# Lowenstein calls Kennedy a 'unifying' force
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) is the only
potential presidential candidate who can bring
Americans into the political process and raise
the nation's spirit, Allard Lowenstein, former
New York congressman and a leader of the
"Draft Kennedy" movement, said here last
week.
"While I was working on the campaign in
Florida, I realized that the mere mention of
Teddy Kennedy is enough to bring people to
gether. They get excited about him," he said.
Lowenstein said he saw "group after group"
of supporters at Kennedy's headquarters in Or
lando, and that "in that mosaic of Americans I
understood that Edward Kennedy has the ability
to galvanize and unify people."
Lowenstein, who recently returned from
three weeks of Kennedy campaigning in Florida,
emphasized the need for leadership to "over
come the cynicism that has become so stylish."
Rigged voting
The Democratic Party leadership in Florida
made voting for Kennedy delegates like "getting
an elephant through the eye of a needle," Low
enstein said. In a more private meeting with
Stanford Students for Kennedy members at
Toyon Hall, the one-time president of Ameri
cans for Democratic Action called the election
process "rigged" for a Kennedy defeat.
He asked his more than 100 listeners in Kresge
Auditorium not to concentrate on Kennedy's
tragedy at Chappaquiddick.
"The fact is," the former Stanford dean of

men said, "accidents in cars occur."
The hour-long speech did not outline a possi
ble Kennedy platform for the 1980 election and
Lowenstein skirted questions about one during
a question-and-answer period that followed.
"I can't talk for him as long as his candidacy is
unofficial," Lowenstein said. "Everybody usu
ally moves to the middle. Politics is not going to
change in 1980,'' he added.
"Schizophrenic state"
Lowenstein described "the schizophrenic
state in America," that he said entailed a con
cern for the future but a relaxation in the pre
sent. "The result is that nobody does anything,"
he said.
Lowenstein concluded his speech on a
positive note, stating, "We are not ungoverna
ble nowanymore than we were ungovernable in
1932 or 1941." The "parochialism" and "fac
tionalism" of current American politics must
end, starting at this campus, he said.
Lowenstein has returned to the Stanford
campus on numerous occasions to arouse stu
dent interest and support for a number of
causes. In particular, he has appeared in con
junction with protests against apartheid policies
in South Africa.
Peter Stamos, the director of Stanford Stu
dents for Kennedy, said the professor of politi
cal science had been invited to talk because
"hfc's been inside the Democratic Party" and
"has an interesting perspective."
