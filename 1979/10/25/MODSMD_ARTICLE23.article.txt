# Commuter airline business runs into foul weather
## 
### 
The Associated Press
The commuterairline industry is big
business. It is also in big trouble.
The past year — the 12 months since
the airlines were deregulated — has
witnessed a dramatic increase in fatal
crashes among commuter carriers,
and alarmed officials blame poor
training and maintenance proce
dures.
Thirty-six people died in commuter
air accidents in all of 1978. That death
rate of 2.79 passengers per 100 million
miles flown was 400 times that of .007
deaths for commercial airlines in 1978.
So far this year, 51 people have
perished.
The National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) —which has sent panels
around the country to investigate the
crashes — has announced an unusual
hearing of the full five-member
board, to start Jan. 28.

The board said it will look into evi
dence of "repeated safety deficien
cies" and "a lack of safety surveillance
and enforcement" by the Federal Av
iation Administration. (FAA).
"We were seven months into the
year and we had more accidents now
than all of last year," said NTSB chair
man lames King. "A lot of these acci
dents could have been prevented -
you don't see this kind of thing in the
larger air carriers."
On Oct. 24,1978, the industry burst
wide open with the Airline Deregula
tion Act. To many travelers, deregula
tion simply meant the airlines could
set their own fares. But it also permit
ted trunk carriers to abandon service
to economically marginal markets.
The big airlines have announced
plans to pull out of 79 cities. The na
tion's 262 commuter airlines, taking

up the slack, predict a 22 percent in
crease in passengers this year.
In 1978, commuter airlines carried a
record 10.7 million passengers, "and
this year we'll carry about 12 million,"
said Tulinda Deegan, spokeswoman
for the Commuter Airlines Associa
tion of America. "It's a booming in
dustry."
A good example is Apollo Airways
of Santa Barbara, Calif. Apollo began
its family-owned commuter business
in October 1975, making daily runs
between Santa Barbara and San lose.
Apollo carried 2600 passengers in May
1978.
Then came deregulation. Hughes
Air West cut its Bakersfield run two
months later. Now Apollo's five
Culfstream II jets serve nine markets
with another three ready to start. In
May 1979, Apollo carried 11,044 pas

sengers.
"In August we broke all records —
11,300 passengers," said Terry Cedar,
one of Apollo's managers. He pre
dicted a 70 percent gain in traffic by
next year.
Some officials believe the boom in
the commuter airline business came
so quickly that training and mainte
nance were neglected.
"It's distressed us that we're finding
the level of pilot training is not what it
should be and some aircraft mainte
nance is not up to standards," said
King.
An NTSB panel held hearings in
Cambridge, Mass., in September on
two summer accidents involving
Downeast Airlines of Rockland,
Maine, and Air New England, a
Boston-based carrier.
Both accidents involved twin
engine DeHavilland Otters that

crashed on final approach to fog
shrouded airports. Seventeen died in
the Maine crash; the Air New England
pilot was killed.
Former Downeast pilots testified
that management often berated pilots
who wouldn't fly in poor weather. One
pilot said he refused to fly the Dow
neast plane that crashed because of
engine problems.
A Navy pathologist told the panel
the Air New England captain should
have been grounded because of sig
nificant heart disease.
King blames the problems on the
way the FAA has monitored the com
muter lines following decontrol.
"When decontrol was being consi
dered, the FAA made assurances that
it could handle the increase in busi
ness for the small lines," said King.
"Now we go out and see some things
that don't speak highly of that."

The commuterairline industry is big
business. It is also in big trouble.
The past year — the 12 months since
the airlines were deregulated — has
witnessed a dramatic increase in fatal
crashes among commuter carriers,
and alarmed officials blame poor
training and maintenance proce
dures.
Thirty-six people died in commuter
air accidents in all of 1978. That death
rate of 2.79 passengers per 100 million
miles flown was 400 times that of .007
deaths for commercial airlines in 1978.
So far this year, 51 people have
perished.
The National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) —which has sent panels
around the country to investigate the
crashes — has announced an unusual
hearing of the full five-member
board, to start Jan. 28.

The board said it will look into evi
dence of "repeated safety deficien
cies" and "a lack of safety surveillance
and enforcement" by the Federal Av
iation Administration. (FAA).
"We were seven months into the
year and we had more accidents now
than all of last year," said NTSB chair
man lames King. "A lot of these acci
dents could have been prevented -
you don't see this kind of thing in the
larger air carriers."
On Oct. 24,1978, the industry burst
wide open with the Airline Deregula
tion Act. To many travelers, deregula
tion simply meant the airlines could
set their own fares. But it also permit
ted trunk carriers to abandon service
to economically marginal markets.
The big airlines have announced
plans to pull out of 79 cities. The na
tion's 262 commuter airlines, taking

up the slack, predict a 22 percent in
crease in passengers this year.
In 1978, commuter airlines carried a
record 10.7 million passengers, "and
this year we'll carry about 12 million,"
said Tulinda Deegan, spokeswoman
for the Commuter Airlines Associa
tion of America. "It's a booming in
dustry."
A good example is Apollo Airways
of Santa Barbara, Calif. Apollo began
its family-owned commuter business
in October 1975, making daily runs
between Santa Barbara and San lose.
Apollo carried 2600 passengers in May
1978.
Then came deregulation. Hughes
Air West cut its Bakersfield run two
months later. Now Apollo's five
Culfstream II jets serve nine markets
with another three ready to start. In
May 1979, Apollo carried 11,044 pas

sengers.
