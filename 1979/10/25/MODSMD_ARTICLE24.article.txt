## Perry Mason would object to Justice 
### 
General critical reactions are
sometimes genuinely puzzling
to me. To steal a very good line,
for some critics, the only major
criterion seems to be whether
they can understand a movie's
basic premise and whether that
premise has some "meaning"
for them.
. . . And lustice For All is a
case in point. The movie really
deserves no respect at all; it's a
dishrag of a movie, and the
dishrag is well worn. If you take
out the broadly comic scenes,
this movie might have made a
great TV pilot, but then again,
the "crusading lawyer" days of
Owen Marshall, et al. already
seem to be ancient history in
TV land.
Yet somecriticswill haveyou
believe that Justice is the
"Network of the legal profes
sion" or "an hilarious satire."
While that may indeed be the
movie's intention, far lower
expectations would be more
appropriate.
Shallowness
The simplistic moral choices,
the shallow dramatics and the
cheap comedy in the Barry
Levinson-Valerie Curtin script
are presented with embarras
sing earnestness by director
Norman lewison, who should
know better, lewison has suf
fered through a long dry spell;

his last real hit was In The Heat
of the Night, released in 1967.
Here, lewison is like a badly
scared rookie in a film produc
tion class, overdoing every
thing, searching desperately
for the "big scene" that will
make somebody notice him.
And you notice all-too-many
things in this movie. The
Levinson-Curtin script essen
tially comes down to "good
guy lawyer finds himself having
to defend hated judge who is
as guilty as hell of a rape and
assault charge." The rest of the
movie is padding populated by
buffoons.
Shameless
As a manic-depressive
judge, lack Warden overacts
shamelessly, completely de
stroying whatever satiric po
tential his character might have
had. It's true that many of the
people entrusted with ad
ministering justice in this
country are far less than per
fect, but what lustice does is to
simply make those seemingly
complex characters cheap
comic-book figures.
This "satire" doesn't even
begin to sting the viewer — it's
too easy to laugh away the
people here. They're more like
safe, faintly amusing monkeys
in a sparkling glass cage than

truly satiric characters, charac
ters who make us question our
own basic assumptions.
Rising above
The only actors who begin to
manage to rise above TV-series
standards are John Forsythe
and Al Pacino. Forsythe plays
the smug, hypocritical judge
with a practiced evil that,
amidst what's going on around
him, is almost refreshing.
(And, of course, Forsythe
makes great copy for the
movie's ads, which proclaim
"come see the voice of Charley
in Charley's Angels.)
By sheer force of will, it
seems, Pacino, as the good guy
lawyer, is sometimes interest
ing here. Still, he's never
seemed so ordinary. When he
can play off other actors, he's
at his best, but here Pacino, as
in his last movie, Bobby Deer
field, finds himself playing the
star, always on camera, called
upon to carry the movie.
The worst
But he can't. Pacino's shriek
ing, shrill concluding summa
tion may be the worst movie
sequence of his career; he has
literally nothing to build on,
and the scene is so hackneyed
and obvious that you start to
feel sorry for him.

The ending is supposed to
serve as a statement of moral
courage and outrage, but in
stead, it leaves you, if you still
care by this point, more be
mused than moved.
As the credits roll at the
movie's close, Pacino sits on
the courthouse steps with a
faraway look in his eye. It's as if
further adventures await him.
And that, of all the questions
this movie leaves you with,
may be the one that sticks with
you. "Will Al Pacino be suc
cessful in his bid for a weekly
series?"
Pacino, at the very least,
must be more ambitious than
that.
