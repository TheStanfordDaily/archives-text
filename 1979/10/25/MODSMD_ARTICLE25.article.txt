# Erasmus actors view life on the stage
## 
### 
The Daily interviewed four
actors who will appear in the
Stanford Drama Department's
fall production of Erasmus
Montanus, which will open
October 3 7 and run for two
weeks. The interviewees in
clude junior Doug Schuetz
(Erasmus), sophomore Richard
dyne (Peer), senior Brent
Shaphren (lesper) and
freshman Sally Morton
(Lisbed). All except Morton
have declared their majors in
drama.
Daily: What, theatrically, did
you do this past summer?
Schuetz: I was part of the Con
temporary Theater Workshop
at Stanford this summer, and
played Paul Bunyan in
Shepard's Mad Dog Blues.
Clyne: I was ass t director/stage
mgr. of Codspell in the Reno/
Sparks area.
Shaphren: I acted for the Pacific
Conservatory of the Perform
ing Arts is Hamlet, As You Like
It, and Fiddler on the Roof.
Morton: Last August, I attended
The Royal Academy of the
Dramatic Arts in London.
Daily: Could you tell me a little
bit about the play?
Schuetz: Erasmus Montanus is
not "Julius Caesar goes to De
nmark" as the title suggests. It
is a comedy that everyone on
campuswill reallyfind interest
ing as well as funny.
Daily: Why?
Schuetz: The character of Mon
tanus is very near to people
around me at Stanford. Many
people are scholars in certain
areas, but are lacking in others.
Everybody will find this play

highly amusing because it
deals with the life of a student.
Daily: Is acting, then, an imita
tion of real life?
Shaphren: Yes, but presented
in a larger-than-life format.
Daily: Any other opinions?
Clyne: Acting is using literature
to illuminate or create emo
tions and sensations of which
the audience may not have
been fully aware. Of course, it
has to be entertaining as well.
Daily: Why do you act?
Shaphren: Each of us has a
myriad of characters locked in
side of us, and we rarely show
more than a few of them. Act
inggives methe opportunity to
express some of these "hid
den" characters that I wouldn't
ordinarily show.
Morton: There are two sides to
acting. Outwardly, it entertains
by giving the audience impetus
to reflect on ideas and ques
tions the play raises. Inwardly,
it enhances self-awareness and
gives me confidence and
poise.
Daily: How much of theater is
ego?
Clyne: A lot. My ego is what
keeps me on stage. Even in the
worst rehearsal or perfor
mance, I have to be able to say
that "it was a mistake" and
convince myself that I'm not
really as bad as I may have just
appeared.
Daily: Is acting hard?
Schuetz: Too many people
think that acting is easy and not
work. Acting is hard. It's more
than just memorizing lines. It's
getting yourself to move across
the stage without looking likea
clutz.

Morton: I find it difficult to ini
tially delve and discover my
own personal emotional re
sponses. Like anyone, I have
my own protective screen
around me. But when I am able
to reach past this screen and
extract emotion, then I'm act
ing.
Daily: What's the worst part of
acting?
Shaphren: The audition pro
cess!
Clyne: Placing your trust for the
concept of the show in some
one else's hands. I always want
to be the director myself.
Daily: Do you plan to pursue a
career in the theater?
Schuet/: My goal after gradua
tion is to go back to Chicago
and get into The Second City,
which is a famous improvisa
tional group. While learning
the finer points of comedy, I
plan also to write plays.

Clyne: I'd like to go into reg
ional theater: Asliland, Second
City, Stratford, etc. —with my
eye on New York or L.A. pro
fessional companies.
Shaphren: I would like to con
tinue training in an MFA prog
ram somewhere on the West
Coast.
Daily: Any final wisdom?
Schuetz: Essentially, you
graduate with the ability to do
absolutely nothing practical.
But drama forces you to go out
and attack life in the outside
world. It's the unpredictability
of this life that appeals to me.
Clyne: Someone once said,
"They don't pay you to act;
you'd do it for free. They pay
you for waiting." That's really
the case. What one loves about
acting, or physics, or advertis
ing, makes the bad times worth
the wait.
