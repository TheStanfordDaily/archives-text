# Flawless accompaniment by pianist Hagopian
## 'Ondine's Curse' no problem for flautist Hawley 
### 
Flautist Alexandra Hawley is
part of a long woodwind tradi
tion. Her mother, Francis
Blaisdell, is a flautist of world
reknown and was one of the
first women ever admitted to
the Julliard School. Hawley's
young daughter is already ac
complished on the instrument
and Hawley herself is no
stranger to success. She is a
former student of Jean Pierre
Rampal and made her New
York debut in Carnegie Hall.
Last Sunday in Annenberg
Auditorium, Hawley, a
member of the Stanford faculty,
gave a recital accompanied by
pianist Robert Hagopian, pro
fessor of music at San
Raphael's Dominican College
and the 1972 winner of the
Katchaturian Competition in
New York. Hawley and Hago
pian have performed together
for a number of years.
Hawley selected a program
that will be usedagain this Feb
ruary for the New York Met
ropolitan Museum of Art In
troduction Series. The recital
opened with a solid interpreta
tion of the Sonata in B minor by
lohann Sebastian Bach. The
Andante was performed with
equanimity, cban articulation
and exacting intonation, the
Largo e dolce was rendered
with a singing tone, admirable
phrasing and a sense of open
throated sound.
The following piece of music
was somewhat of a letdown —
not in the performance so
much as in the nature of
I laydn s Five Pieces for the Mus
ic,L?/ Clock itself. More apropos
lor a "Young People's Con
cert" as an introduction to an
instrument called the flute

than a recital at Stanford, let
alone the New York Metropoli
tan Museum, the light series of
five short pieces was neverthe
less well executed and undeni
ably "cute." It elicited chuck
les from the audience at the
end.
By far the most interesting of
the suite was the Allegro with
its lengthy passage for flute
and piano in perfect unison.
These pieces incidentally were
not written specifically for the
flute, but rather for the flutec
lock, a popular 18th and 19th
century instrument similar to a
mechanical organ. In this case,
Franz Vester arranged them for
flute and piano.
With such a vast repertoire
for the flute, I feel that Hawley
could have selected another
perhaps more challenging
—certainly more significant
piece to represent not only her
instrument but her virtuosity as
well.
I have no qualms whatsoever
with the degree of difficulty of
the remainder to the program,
as Hawley selected monu
ments of flute repertoire. She
included an above standard
performance of the standard
Sonata for Flute and Piano by
Francis Poulenc, and a lyrical,
almost mystical performance
of Samuel Barber's Ca/.one.
The Sonata for Flute and
Piano, Opus 14 composed in
1960 by Robert Muczynski, an
American composer in resi
dence at the University of
Arizona was also noteworthy.
This tremendously difficult
piece, for the flute and even
more so for the piano, was
executed with confidence and
flair. The Alleuro deciso was

delivered with full realization
of the rhythmic intricacies in
cluding synchopations and a
realm of interesting tensions.
The Andante began with a
well balanced flute solo. The
Allegro con moto was a move
ment of contrasts between the
power of the piano and the
lyricism of the flute, as well as
the contrast of bell-like melody
and incessant, perpetual
rhythms. The Scherzo: Vivace,
however, was stolen by the
pageturner who seemingly
never failed to jumble the en
tire score. Try as she might she
could not foil seasoned
musician Robert Hagopian
who never lost his place, his
patience or his cool.
Hagopian, however, posses
ses far greater talents than
mere coordination and toler
ance. He is a performer who
demands attention. It is indeed
rare to encounter an accom
panist so provocative as to rival
a soloist, yet Hagopian how
ever unintentionally does just
that. His absolutely flawless
command of the most difficult
conceivable of accompani
ments coupled with his poetic
technique and approach to the
piano puts him in the spotlight
regardless of his musical role.
The main criticisms I have of
the performance in general are
few and isolated, and may in
fact be purely circumstantial.
Annenberg Auditorium was
unusually cold during the reci
tal, and this could most defi
nitely have an effect upon the
flute accounting for a slight
weakness I perceived in the
low register and an occasional
"pinched" quality in the upper
register of the instrument.

The focal point of the entire
concert was a piece by Karl
Reinecke, Sonata, Opus. 167,
"Undine". Undine is the story
by Friedrich Heinrich Karl,
Baron de la Motte-Fouque, of a
water nymph (Undine) who
marries a man in order to gain a
mortal soul. The tluid, stormy,
turbulent sound of the Allegro
consistently evoked the sub
ject matter of the tale. All tour
movements in fact were per
formed in an impassioned and
dynamic style.
Alexandra Hawley is a fine
flautist. I would even venture
to say that she figuratively suf
fers from "Ondine's Curse."
This is a compliment.
In the story of Undine (or
Ondine) the water nymph is
jilted by her husband. As a
punishment, Ondine impaired
his autonomic functions in
cluding the reflex to breathe.

The victim of the curse died in
his sleep when he "forgot" to
breathe.
In medicine, "Ondine's
Curse" refers to a well
documented clinical entity in
respiratory medicine, neurol
ogy and pediatrics. I am refer
ring to the all important mus
ical element of phrasing. A fine
flautist must disguise the au
tonomic function of breathing
with both physical stamina
and cleverness giving the illu
sion that the phrases are con
tinuous.
It is interesting that Reinecke
chose the story of Ondine to
prove the programmatic
backdrop for his sonata.
Alexandra Hawley has certainly
fulfilled the intention behind
the music with her mastery of
the phrase — the crowning
glory of any flautist.

Stanford's Alexandra Hawley performed last Sunday in Annenberg,
including selections from Bach, Haydn, Pouleni, and Keinecke. She
was accompanied by pianist Robert Hagopian.
Flautist Alexandra Hawley is
part of a long woodwind tradi
tion. Her mother, Francis
Blaisdell, is a flautist of world
reknown and was one of the
first women ever admitted to
the Julliard School. Hawley's
young daughter is already ac
complished on the instrument
and Hawley herself is no
stranger to success. She is a
former student of Jean Pierre
Rampal and made her New
York debut in Carnegie Hall.
Last Sunday in Annenberg
Auditorium, Hawley, a
member of the Stanford faculty,
gave a recital accompanied by
pianist Robert Hagopian, pro
fessor of music at San
Raphael's Dominican College
and the 1972 winner of the
Katchaturian Competition in
New York. Hawley and Hago
pian have performed together
for a number of years.
Hawley selected a program
that will be usedagain this Feb
ruary for the New York Met
ropolitan Museum of Art In
troduction Series. The recital
opened with a solid interpreta
tion of the Sonata in B minor by
lohann Sebastian Bach. The
Andante was performed with
equanimity, cban articulation
and exacting intonation, the
Largo e dolce was rendered
with a singing tone, admirable
phrasing and a sense of open
throated sound.
The following piece of music
was somewhat of a letdown —
not in the performance so
much as in the nature of
I laydn s Five Pieces for the Mus
ic,L?/ Clock itself. More apropos
lor a "Young People's Con
cert" as an introduction to an
instrument called the flute

than a recital at Stanford, let
alone the New York Metropoli
tan Museum, the light series of
five short pieces was neverthe
less well executed and undeni
ably "cute." It elicited chuck
les from the audience at the
end.
By far the most interesting of
the suite was the Allegro with
its lengthy passage for flute
and piano in perfect unison.
These pieces incidentally were
not written specifically for the
flute, but rather for the flutec
lock, a popular 18th and 19th
century instrument similar to a
mechanical organ. In this case,
Franz Vester arranged them for
flute and piano.
With such a vast repertoire
for the flute, I feel that Hawley
could have selected another
perhaps more challenging
—certainly more significant
piece to represent not only her
instrument but her virtuosity as
well.
I have no qualms whatsoever
with the degree of difficulty of
the remainder to the program,
as Hawley selected monu
ments of flute repertoire. She
included an above standard
performance of the standard
Sonata for Flute and Piano by
Francis Poulenc, and a lyrical,
almost mystical performance
of Samuel Barber's Ca/.one.
The Sonata for Flute and
Piano, Opus 14 composed in
1960 by Robert Muczynski, an
American composer in resi
dence at the University of
Arizona was also noteworthy.
This tremendously difficult
piece, for the flute and even
more so for the piano, was
executed with confidence and
flair. The Alleuro deciso was

delivered with full realization
of the rhythmic intricacies in
cluding synchopations and a
realm of interesting tensions.
The Andante began with a
well balanced flute solo. The
Allegro con moto was a move
ment of contrasts between the
power of the piano and the
lyricism of the flute, as well as
the contrast of bell-like melody
and incessant, perpetual
rhythms. The Scherzo: Vivace,
however, was stolen by the
pageturner who seemingly
never failed to jumble the en
tire score. Try as she might she
could not foil seasoned
musician Robert Hagopian
who never lost his place, his
patience or his cool.
Hagopian, however, posses
ses far greater talents than
mere coordination and toler
ance. He is a performer who
demands attention. It is indeed
rare to encounter an accom
panist so provocative as to rival
a soloist, yet Hagopian how
ever unintentionally does just
that. His absolutely flawless
command of the most difficult
conceivable of accompani
ments coupled with his poetic
technique and approach to the
piano puts him in the spotlight
regardless of his musical role.
The main criticisms I have of
the performance in general are
few and isolated, and may in
fact be purely circumstantial.
Annenberg Auditorium was
unusually cold during the reci
tal, and this could most defi
nitely have an effect upon the
flute accounting for a slight
weakness I perceived in the
low register and an occasional
"pinched" quality in the upper
register of the instrument.

The focal point of the entire
concert was a piece by Karl
Reinecke, Sonata, Opus. 167,
"Undine". Undine is the story
by Friedrich Heinrich Karl,
Baron de la Motte-Fouque, of a
water nymph (Undine) who
marries a man in order to gain a
mortal soul. The tluid, stormy,
turbulent sound of the Allegro
consistently evoked the sub
ject matter of the tale. All tour
movements in fact were per
formed in an impassioned and
dynamic style.
Alexandra Hawley is a fine
flautist. I would even venture
to say that she figuratively suf
fers from "Ondine's Curse."
This is a compliment.
In the story of Undine (or
Ondine) the water nymph is
jilted by her husband. As a
punishment, Ondine impaired
his autonomic functions in
cluding the reflex to breathe.

The victim of the curse died in
his sleep when he "forgot" to
breathe.
In medicine, "Ondine's
Curse" refers to a well
documented clinical entity in
respiratory medicine, neurol
ogy and pediatrics. I am refer
ring to the all important mus
ical element of phrasing. A fine
flautist must disguise the au
tonomic function of breathing
with both physical stamina
and cleverness giving the illu

tinuous.
