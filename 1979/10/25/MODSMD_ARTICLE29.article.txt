# Wholly happy, they're maidens of God

The Fiandmaidens of Cod,
one of two documentaries
shown at the San Francisco
Film Festival will not make
money or win many awards.
Indeed, it likely will be quietly
forgotten as "that Canadian
entry I missed at last year's fes
tival." But for those few who
saw it, Handmaidens will be
remembered for its sensitivity
and ability to capture mood on
film.
The IHandmaidens of God, or
Les Servantes du Bon Dieu,
documents the daily lives and
chores ot an order of nuns in
Sherbrooke, O ue bec. They live
to serve the Catholic priests

who spread the word of Christ.
Director Diane L'eternou
presents a warm, compassion
ate, entertaining and en
lightening view ot these elderly
women, most of whom had
taken their vows while still in
their 20s
What brings the film off is
the incredible control that
L'eternou exerts over emotion
and mood. The camera is un
biased and unobtrusive. The
handmaidens are shown sew
ing, cooking, repairing
gadgets, printing newspapers
and making music. Most of
them have workeci at the same
job tor more than 20 years. In

their work, and in the enter
tainment we are shown wholly
happy people â€” their eyes tell
it all.
But they are more than
happy; they are fascinating.
From off camera, the director
asks them questions: "Why
did you take the vows," and
"Do you miss men," even
"How old are Questions
that in another context could
be offensive.
Ironically, the nuns, or les
petites soeurs, are much more
alive and interesting than the
rather colorless priests they
serve. The nuns are the ones
with hope. As a chaplain re

marks, "They are pious, yet jo
vial."
Some may find, as did this
reviewer, this portrait of
these women, subordinating
their lives to men, disconcert
ing. But the handmaidens are
entirely satisfied. All of them
would do it again, they said, if
they had the chance. They re
gret that young women, no
longer join the convent, but
that's life, they say. Thus the
film points to a period in the
history of Quebec that has
been left behind. And so
would have these women if
this film had not been made.
