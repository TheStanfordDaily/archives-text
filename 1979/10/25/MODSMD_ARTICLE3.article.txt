# Lighting priorities explored

### Christina Gavin 
Campus lighting has been the subject
of numerous complaints of late but ef
forts to fill the numerous requests for
more lighting are facing, in their turn,
many constraints.
The University's Facilities Planning
Office is currently organizing a com
prehensive lighting plan for future
lighting around the campus, but )im
Nelson, asst. business manager and di
rector of facilities and properties cited
an economic problem in dealing with
all the lighting needs of the campus.
"There are always many projects
competing for limited funds," he said,
"so we have to make priority deci
sions."
One concern which was revealed by
several interviews was the problem of
rape. When asked if rape reports might
expedite the implementation of light
ing in a given area, Max Mazenko,
campus planner, said "Last year, there
were only two documented rapes on
campus. One was inside a dorm and
one was in broad daylight. So it (rapes)
hasn't really entered in."
But it appears that the fear of rape
may be a larger problem. Women's
Center outreach coordinator Deborah
DeMott said the fear of rape was of
such concern that a student using the
facilities at the Center filed a request
for more lighting in the area.
Phi Psi house, located at 550 San

)uan, has had its lighting problems also.
Monica Menco, food manager, and
Chris Pilon, house manager, said they
felt the University was not responding
quickly enough to a "very serious situa
tion."
Menco said there is a very dark path
that leads from Campus Drive to the
side of the house. The University has
not yet acted on a request for lighting
that the house made more than a year
ago, she said.
"A lot of people just don't feel very
safe walking in the dark," Menco ad
ded, and accused the University of
being bogged down in "red tape."
Lighting is a sore subject in the
house, Pilon said, adding that he felt
there did exist a hazard that should be
given top priority.
He also gave little credence to the
University's claims of limited funding.
Campus Planner Mazenko agreed
that "there is a definite need for more
lighting because we have a night-time
campus. It's a residential campus, and
people use it at night."
Mazenko added that at last count
there were close to 1500 outside lights
on campus, not counting those at the
entrances to buildings and "mounted
lights."
The new lighting plan would set up a
priority rating system based on need
foroptimum security and safety as well
as aesthetic purposes, Mazenko said.

Nelson cited an economic problem
in dealing with all the lighting needs of
the campus. In the tive year span since
1975, total expenditures for new instal
lations were $363,000, he said.
In the past, dorm parking lob were
given higher priority on our laundry list
or projects because that's w'lere we
saw a need. But there are always some
projects that don't get done," he said.
Mazenko said the University is di
vided into lighting zones that help to
establish priority. "In the innercampus
(the Quad, malls and libraries)," he
said, "we try to achieve saturation
lighting, an even level of illumination
throughout the area.
"Other zones are determined by
'corridors' (streets and paths) radiating
from the inner campus. The priority
level of these corridors is then set by
the density of traffic on each at night."
Lighting problems are identified in
one of four ways: (1) periodic review
with the police department to deter
mine areas with high crime rates; (2)
empirical observation by the Facilities
Planning Office to decide if lighting is
justified in those areas; (3) external
input from the University committee
structure (i.e. the Bicycle Safety Com
mittee, the Transportation Committee,
the Committee on Land and Building
Development, etc.); and (4) individual
requests from organizations around
campus.

of numerous complaints of late but ef
forts to fill the numerous requests for
more lighting are facing, in their turn,
many constraints.
The University's Facilities Planning
Office is currently organizing a com
prehensive lighting plan for future
lighting around the campus, but )im
Nelson, asst. business manager and di
rector of facilities and properties cited
an economic problem in dealing with
all the lighting needs of the campus.
"There are always many projects
competing for limited funds," he said,
"so we have to make priority deci
sions."
One concern which was revealed by
several interviews was the problem of
rape. When asked if rape reports might
expedite the implementation of light
ing in a given area, Max Mazenko,
campus planner, said "Last year, there
were only two documented rapes on
campus. One was inside a dorm and
one was in broad daylight. So it (rapes)
hasn't really entered in."
But it appears that the fear of rape
may be a larger problem. Women's
Center outreach coordinator Deborah
DeMott said the fear of rape was of
such concern that a student using the
facilities at the Center filed a request
for more lighting in the area.
Phi Psi house, located at 550 San

)uan, has had its lighting problems also.
Monica Menco, food manager, and
Chris Pilon, house manager, said they
felt the University was not responding
quickly enough to a "very serious situa
tion."
Menco said there is a very dark path
that leads from Campus Drive to the
side of the house. The University has
not yet acted on a request for lighting
that the house made more than a year
ago, she said.
"A lot of people just don't feel very
safe walking in the dark," Menco ad
ded, and accused the University of
being bogged down in "red tape."
Lighting is a sore subject in the
house, Pilon said, adding that he felt
there did exist a hazard that should be
given top priority.
He also gave little credence to the
University's claims of limited funding.
Campus Planner Mazenko agreed
that "there is a definite need for more
lighting because we have a night-time
campus. It's a residential campus, and
people use it at night."
Mazenko added that at last count
there were close to 1500 outside lights
on campus, not counting those at the
entrances to buildings and "mounted
lights."
The new lighting plan would set up a
priority rating system based on need
foroptimum security and safety as well
as aesthetic purposes, Mazenko said.

Nelson cited an economic problem
in dealing with all the lighting needs of
the campus. In the tive year span since
1975, total expenditures for new instal
lations were $363,000, he said.
In the past, dorm parking lob were
given higher priority on our laundry list
or projects because that's w'lere we
saw a need. But there are always some
projects that don't get done," he said.
Mazenko said the University is di
vided into lighting zones that help to
establish priority. "In the innercampus
(the Quad, malls and libraries)," he
said, "we try to achieve saturation
lighting, an even level of illumination
throughout the area.
"Other zones are determined by
'corridors' (streets and paths) radiating
from the inner campus. The priority
level of these corridors is then set by
the density of traffic on each at night."
Lighting problems are identified in
one of four ways: (1) periodic review
with the police department to deter
mine areas with high crime rates; (2)
empirical observation by the Facilities
Planning Office to decide if lighting is
justified in those areas; (3) external
input from the University committee
structure (i.e. the Bicycle Safety Com
mittee, the Transportation Committee,
the Committee on Land and Building
Development, etc.); and (4) individual
requests from organizations around
campus.
