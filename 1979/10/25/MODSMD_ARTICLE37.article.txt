Kennedy to be 'official' candidate
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy will an
nounce formation of an "exploratory" campaign
committee Monday, an aide said yesterday.
That will make the Massachusetts Democrat an
official candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
Tom Southwick, Kennedy's press secretary,
confirmed that announcement of the campaign
committee will be made Monday after several
sources in the movement to draft Kennedy for the
party nomination said they had received indirect
signals that the move was imminent.
Registration of a committee with the Federal
Election Commission will make Kennedy a legal
candidate, although he is not expected to formally
announce his candidacy until later in the year.
Meanwhile, several leaders of the draft move
ment, formed last spring to lure Kennedy into a
race against President jimmy Carter, said they ex
pect to convert their operations immediately to
campaign status.
FEC records showed 68 different Kennedy dratt
committees had registered as of Wednesday, but
only 10 have filed financial reports showing how
much money they have raised. Those 10 commit
tees reported raising $256,900 and spending
$164,025 by the end of September.
Most of the draft committees, which were
exempt from normal rules governing spending
money, are expected to disband after the
exploratory panel is formed, but many of those
who worked in the draft movement are expected
to join the official campaign.
Carter's campaign committee has protested this
unofficial campaign organizing with charges that
the effort was centrally orchestrated Irom
Washington and not a spontaneous draft move
ment.
The election commission notified several of the
draft committees on Tuesday that it had found
"reason to believe" there may have been some
violation of campaign law and that it would pro
ceed with an investigation of the Carter charges.
House votes to keep gas controls
Washington — Bowing to the wishes of the Car
ter administration, the Ftouse reversed itself yes
terday and voted to retain price and allocation
controls on gasoline through mid-1981.
The 225-189 turnabout vote came amid expres
sions of dismay by congressional leaders over
soaring oil-industry profits.
The House action overturned a 191-188 vote
taken on Oct. 12 for immediate and full gasoline
decontrol — action some critics said might have
sent prices at the pump soaring toward $2 a gallon.
The vote means the controls, which opponents
claim have done little to check spiraling prices at
the pump, will stay on until Sept. 30, 1981, when
they are set to expire automatically.
Knocking price and allocation controls off
gasoline would create serious confusion in the
energy marketplace, said Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) who led the reconsideration effort.
He called immediate decontrol "not very well
thought out."
But Rep. James Courter (D-N.J.), author of the
decontrol amendment, defended his proposal,
claiming it would make gas lines less likely in the

future by shucking the government's complex al
location system.
Yesterday's House vote leaves intact the presi
dent's decision to phase out price lids gradually on
U.S.-produced crude oil by 1981. It also has no
effect on heating oil or diesel fuel, which are al
ready free from price controls.
Carter pledges aid to Cambodia
Washington — President )immy Carter commit
ted the United States government yesterday to
providing $69 million in aid to Cambodia in an
effort to avert "a tragedy of genocidal propor
tion."
Carter's proposal came little more than an hour
after Sen. Edward Kennedy criticized the administ
ration for moving too slowly to aid millions of
Cambodians who face starvation.
The president's announcement and Kennedy's
criticism followed approval by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee of a bill authorizing the expen
diture ot $30 million to aid the Cambodians. Carter
included that $30 million in the program he an
nounced.
Carter equated the famine in Cambodia with the
World War II Holocaust.
Kennedy, speaking to a Georgetown University
audience, said, "We must take essential steps now
if we are to stave off mass starvation in Cambodia
and avoid graver dangers to the peace in Southeast
Asia."
Members of Congress were told by State De
partment officials that 3 million Cambodians may
die without the $110 million international prog
ram, to which the United States would contribute.
Relief agencies estimate they will need $110 mill
ion for six months, with about 30 nations con
tributing supplies and money.
FTC rules AMA restrains trade
Washington — The American Medical Associa
tion (AMA) has kept doctors' bills high by cam
paigning against competition among physicians,
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled yester
day.
The FTC, in a decision likely to be appealed to
the federal courts, said the AMA illegally re
strained competition among its 200,000 members,
a majority ot American physicians.
It ordered the AMA to end "ethical" restrictions
on member doctors ruling out advertising and
other ways of attracting patients through low fees.
"Consumers lack access to fee and other infor
mation necessary to make an informed choice of a
physician," the decision by Commissioner David
Clanton said. "Information obtained by word
of-mouth does not fill this need."
Clanton said it is impossible to say how much
extra Americans pay physicians because of the
AMA actions, "but we are convinced that the re
cord in this.case supports a finding of substantial
injury."
Ex-shah undergoes major surgery
New York — Shah Mohammad Keza Pahlavi,
who has lymph cancer, underwent surgery yester
day to remove his gall bladder and to remove a
stone from his bile duct, a spokesman for the shah
said.

Robert Armao, the spokesman, said the de
posed shah has been suffering from lymphoma, a
cancer of the lymph nodes, for about six years, but
"did not wish it to be known," when he was ruler
of Iran.
After V/i hours of surgery, which began around
8 a.m., Armao said a recovery "without complica
tions" was expected.
The shah was taken to the recovery room shortly
before noon, hospital spokesman Eamon Brennan
had said earlier. .
"He is far from breathing his last breath, but
obviously he is an ill man," Armao said before the
operation.
The U.S. State Department cleared the shah for
the trip here, but only as long as he remains hos
pitalized.
U.S. senators visit Phnom Penh
Bangkok, Thailand — Three U.S. senators visited
Phnom Penh for 12 hours yesterday and said that
only final Cambodian approval is needed to
launch a massive aid plan that could save hun
dreds of thousands of Cambodians from starva
tion.
Sens. James Sasser (D-Tenn.), John Danforth
(R-Mo.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the first U.S.
officials to visit the capital since the communist
takeover in 1975, briefed Foreign Minister Hun
Sen of their plan to truck 1000 tons of aid into
Cambodia daily.
They said he was "appreciative, genuinely ap
preciative" and that he told them it would be up to
Cambodia's Communist Party Central Committee
to approve the plan.
"We stated to them and we re-state for the world
that the decision is now in their hands, that they
have the ability to say yes or no," Danforth told a
news conference here. Everyone else has said
yes. . . . We are now waiting for Phnom Penh's
answer."
The senators said their plan could be opera
tional within days of Cambodia's approval.
According to Cambodian and international es
timates, from 2 million to 3 million people, outofa
population estimated at around 4 million, could
starve to death.

"We stated to them and we re-state for the world
that the decision is now in their hands, that they
have the ability to say yes or no," Danforth told a
news conference here. Everyone else has said
yes. . . . We are now waiting for Phnom Penh's
answer."

Kennedy to be 'official' candidate
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy will an
nounce formation of an "exploratory" campaign
committee Monday, an aide said yesterday.
That will make the Massachusetts Democrat an
official candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
Tom Southwick, Kennedy's press secretary,
confirmed that announcement of the campaign
committee will be made Monday after several
sources in the movement to draft Kennedy for the
party nomination said they had received indirect
signals that the move was imminent.
Registration of a committee with the Federal
Election Commission will make Kennedy a legal
candidate, although he is not expected to formally
announce his candidacy until later in the year.
Meanwhile, several leaders of the draft move
ment, formed last spring to lure Kennedy into a
race against President jimmy Carter, said they ex
pect to convert their operations immediately to
campaign status.
FEC records showed 68 different Kennedy dratt
committees had registered as of Wednesday, but
only 10 have filed financial reports showing how
much money they have raised. Those 10 commit
tees reported raising $256,900 and spending
$164,025 by the end of September.
Most of the draft committees, which were
exempt from normal rules governing spending
money, are expected to disband after the
exploratory panel is formed, but many of those
who worked in the draft movement are expected
to join the official campaign.
Carter's campaign committee has protested this
unofficial campaign organizing with charges that
the effort was centrally orchestrated Irom
Washington and not a spontaneous draft move

The election commission notified several of the
draft committees on Tuesday that it had found
"reason to believe" there may have been some
violation of campaign law and that it would pro

House votes to keep gas controls
Washington — Bowing to the wishes of the Car
ter administration, the Ftouse reversed itself yes
terday and voted to retain price and allocation
controls on gasoline through mid-1981.
The 225-189 turnabout vote came amid expres
sions of dismay by congressional leaders over
soaring oil-industry profits.
The House action overturned a 191-188 vote
taken on Oct. 12 for immediate and full gasoline
decontrol — action some critics said might have
sent prices at the pump soaring toward $2 a gallon.
The vote means the controls, which opponents
claim have done little to check spiraling prices at
the pump, will stay on until Sept. 30, 1981, when
they are set to expire automatically.
Knocking price and allocation controls off
gasoline would create serious confusion in the
energy marketplace, said Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) who led the reconsideration effort.
He called immediate decontrol "not very well
thought out."
But Rep. James Courter (D-N.J.), author of the
decontrol amendment, defended his proposal,
claiming it would make gas lines less likely in the

future by shucking the government's complex al
location system.
Yesterday's House vote leaves intact the presi

U.S.-produced crude oil by 1981. It also has no
effect on heating oil or diesel fuel, which are al
ready free from price controls.
Carter pledges aid to Cambodia
Washington — President )immy Carter commit
ted the United States government yesterday to
providing $69 million in aid to Cambodia in an
effort to avert "a tragedy of genocidal propor
tion."
Carter's proposal came little more than an hour
after Sen. Edward Kennedy criticized the administ
ration for moving too slowly to aid millions of
Cambodians who face starvation.
The president's announcement and Kennedy's
criticism followed approval by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee of a bill authorizing the expen
diture ot $30 million to aid the Cambodians. Carter
included that $30 million in the program he an
nounced.
Carter equated the famine in Cambodia with the
World War II Holocaust.
Kennedy, speaking to a Georgetown University
audience, said, "We must take essential steps now
if we are to stave off mass starvation in Cambodia
and avoid graver dangers to the peace in Southeast
Asia."
Members of Congress were told by State De
partment officials that 3 million Cambodians may
die without the $110 million international prog
ram, to which the United States would contribute.
Relief agencies estimate they will need $110 mill
ion for six months, with about 30 nations con
tributing supplies and money.
FTC rules AMA restrains trade
Washington — The American Medical Associa
tion (AMA) has kept doctors' bills high by cam
paigning against competition among physicians,
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled yester
day.
The FTC, in a decision likely to be appealed to
the federal courts, said the AMA illegally re
strained competition among its 200,000 members,
a majority ot American physicians.
It ordered the AMA to end "ethical" restrictions
on member doctors ruling out advertising and
other ways of attracting patients through low fees.
"Consumers lack access to fee and other infor
mation necessary to make an informed choice of a
physician," the decision by Commissioner David
Clanton said. "Information obtained by word
of-mouth does not fill this need."
Clanton said it is impossible to say how much
extra Americans pay physicians because of the
AMA actions, "but we are convinced that the re
cord in this.case supports a finding of substantial
injury."
Ex-shah undergoes major surgery
New York — Shah Mohammad Keza Pahlavi,
who has lymph cancer, underwent surgery yester
day to remove his gall bladder and to remove a

said.

Robert Armao, the spokesman, said the de
posed shah has been suffering from lymphoma, a
cancer of the lymph nodes, for about six years, but
"did not wish it to be known," when he was ruler
of Iran.
After V/i hours of surgery, which began around
8 a.m., Armao said a recovery "without complica

The shah was taken to the recovery room shortly
before noon, hospital spokesman Eamon Brennan
had said earlier. .
"He is far from breathing his last breath, but

The U.S. State Department cleared the shah for

Affairs Committee of a bill authorizing the expen
diture ot $30 million to aid the Cambodians. Carter
included that $30 million in the program he an
nounced.
Carter equated the famine in Cambodia with the
World War II Holocaust.
Kennedy, speaking to a Georgetown University
audience, said, "We must take essential steps now
if we are to stave off mass starvation in Cambodia
and avoid graver dangers to the peace in Southeast
Asia."
Members of Congress were told by State De
partment officials that 3 million Cambodians may
die without the $110 million international prog
ram, to which the United States would contribute.
Relief agencies estimate they will need $110 mill
ion for six months, with about 30 nations con
tributing supplies and money.
FTC rules AMA restrains trade
Washington — The American Medical Associa
tion (AMA) has kept doctors' bills high by cam
paigning against competition among physicians,
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled yester
day.
The FTC, in a decision likely to be appealed to
the federal courts, said the AMA illegally re
strained competition among its 200,000 members,
a majority ot American physicians.
It ordered the AMA to end "ethical" restrictions
on member doctors ruling out advertising and
other ways of attracting patients through low fees.
"Consumers lack access to fee and other infor
mation necessary to make an informed choice of a
physician," the decision by Commissioner David
Clanton said. "Information obtained by word
of-mouth does not fill this need."
Clanton said it is impossible to say how much
extra Americans pay physicians because of the
AMA actions, "but we are convinced that the re
cord in this.case supports a finding of substantial
injury."
Ex-shah undergoes major surgery
New York — Shah Mohammad Keza Pahlavi,
who has lymph cancer, underwent surgery yester
day to remove his gall bladder and to remove a
stone from his bile duct, a spokesman for the shah
said.

Robert Armao, the spokesman, said the de
posed shah has been suffering from lymphoma, a
cancer of the lymph nodes, for about six years, but
"did not wish it to be known," when he was ruler
of Iran.
After V/i hours of surgery, which began around
8 a.m., Armao said a recovery "without complica
tions" was expected.
The shah was taken to the recovery room shortly
before noon, hospital spokesman Eamon Brennan
had said earlier. .
"He is far from breathing his last breath, but
obviously he is an ill man," Armao said before the
operation.
The U.S. State Department cleared the shah for
the trip here, but only as long as he remains hos
pitalized.
U.S. senators visit Phnom Penh
Bangkok, Thailand — Three U.S. senators visited
Phnom Penh for 12 hours yesterday and said that
only final Cambodian approval is needed to
launch a massive aid plan that could save hun
dreds of thousands of Cambodians from starva
tion.
Sens. James Sasser (D-Tenn.), John Danforth
(R-Mo.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.), the first U.S.
officials to visit the capital since the communist
takeover in 1975, briefed Foreign Minister Hun
Sen of their plan to truck 1000 tons of aid into
Cambodia daily.
They said he was "appreciative, genuinely ap
preciative" and that he told them it would be up to
Cambodia's Communist Party Central Committee
to approve the plan.
"We stated to them and we re-state for the world
that the decision is now in their hands, that they
have the ability to say yes or no," Danforth told a
news conference here. Everyone else has said
yes. . . . We are now waiting for Phnom Penh's
answer."
The senators said their plan could be opera
tional within days of Cambodia's approval.
According to Cambodian and international es
timates, from 2 million to 3 million people, outofa
population estimated at around 4 million, could

Kennedy to be 'official' candidate
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy will an
nounce formation of an "exploratory" campaign
committee Monday, an aide said yesterday.
That will make the Massachusetts Democrat an
official candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
Tom Southwick, Kennedy's press secretary,
confirmed that announcement of the campaign
committee will be made Monday after several
sources in the movement to draft Kennedy for the
party nomination said they had received indirect
signals that the move was imminent.
Registration of a committee with the Federal
Election Commission will make Kennedy a legal
candidate, although he is not expected to formally
announce his candidacy until later in the year.
Meanwhile, several leaders of the draft move
ment, formed last spring to lure Kennedy into a
race against President jimmy Carter, said they ex
pect to convert their operations immediately to
campaign status.
FEC records showed 68 different Kennedy dratt
committees had registered as of Wednesday, but
only 10 have filed financial reports showing how
much money they have raised. Those 10 commit
tees reported raising $256,900 and spending
$164,025 by the end of September.
Most of the draft committees, which were
exempt from normal rules governing spending
money, are expected to disband after the
exploratory panel is formed, but many of those
who worked in the draft movement are expected
to join the official campaign.
Carter's campaign committee has protested this
unofficial campaign organizing with charges that
the effort was centrally orchestrated Irom
Washington and not a spontaneous draft move
ment.
The election commission notified several of the
draft committees on Tuesday that it had found
"reason to believe" there may have been some
violation of campaign law and that it would pro
ceed with an investigation of the Carter charges.
House votes to keep gas controls
Washington — Bowing to the wishes of the Car
ter administration, the Ftouse reversed itself yes
terday and voted to retain price and allocation
controls on gasoline through mid-1981.
The 225-189 turnabout vote came amid expres
sions of dismay by congressional leaders over
soaring oil-industry profits.
The House action overturned a 191-188 vote
taken on Oct. 12 for immediate and full gasoline
decontrol — action some critics said might have
sent prices at the pump soaring toward $2 a gallon.
The vote means the controls, which opponents
claim have done little to check spiraling prices at
the pump, will stay on until Sept. 30, 1981, when
they are set to expire automatically.
Knocking price and allocation controls off
gasoline would create serious confusion in the
energy marketplace, said Rep. John Dingell (D-
Mich.) who led the reconsideration effort.
He called immediate decontrol "not very well
thought out."
But Rep. James Courter (D-N.J.), author of the
decontrol amendment, defended his proposal,
claiming it would make gas lines less likely in the

future by shucking the government's complex al
location system.
Yesterday's House vote leaves intact the presi
dent's decision to phase out price lids gradually on
U.S.-produced crude oil by 1981. It also has no
effect on heating oil or diesel fuel, which are al
ready free from price controls.
Carter pledges aid to Cambodia
Washington — President )immy Carter commit
ted the United States government yesterday to
providing $69 million in aid to Cambodia in an
effort to avert "a tragedy of genocidal propor
tion."
Carter's proposal came little more than an hour
after Sen. Edward Kennedy criticized the administ
ration for moving too slowly to aid millions of
Cambodians who face starvation.
The president's announcement and Kennedy's
criticism followed approval by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee of a bill authorizing the expen
diture ot $30 million to aid the Cambodians. Carter
