# Radioactive dump sites closed; 300 experiments endangered
## 
### 
The recently announced closing of
the nation's two western radioactive
waste disposal sites may affect about
300 research projects here within a few
months, John Holmes, the University's
senior health physicist said yesterday.
The shutdown of the Washington
and Nevada sites will have no im
mediate effect, since a recent shipment
of radioactive materials was sent to the
Washington site near Richmond just
before its closing three weeks ago.
Holmes has asked campus users of
radioactive materials to minimize the
volume of waste where possible. He
said the University could get by for
only about two months storing the
wastes in its own facility while reduc
ing the volume of radioactive material.
The University has three or four
shipments of radioactive wastes each
year, totaling about 170 55-gallon
drums, Holmes said.
Among the 300 projects affected in
varying degrees are research efforts at
Palo Alto Veterans Medical Center, the
Children's Hospital at Stanford, the
Carnegie Institute and Hopkins Marine
Station.
The projects most adversely affected
are basic chemical and biochemical re
search, including recombinant DNA
and cancer therapy.
The two most commonly used
radioactive materials in such projects
are Carbon-14 and Tritium. Both are
low risk radioisotopes, but have long
half-lives, requiring safe storage until
they decay, according to Spyros An
dreopolous, director of the Medical
Center News Bureau.

Radioisotopes used in diagnosis and
treatment by nuclear medicine have
very short half-lives and could be
stored at the campus disposal facility
on Bonair Siding until they decay.
Many of the latter materials have
half-lives of only a few days or hours,
said Andreopolous.
Both Andreopolous and Holmes said
the radioactive materials used here are
of very low radiation levels and the
hazards from the materials are much
less than from the materials used in
industry.
"We're extremely cautious and al
ways use proper disposal techniques,"
Holmes said.
The University recently hosted the
annual conference of California cam
pus radiation officers. In a letter to
Washington Governor Dixie Lee Ray,
the 18 participants urged action to

reopen the site.
"Because we have responsibility for
radioactive waste disposal from uni
versity research programs, we are fac
ing a dilemma as to how such research
can continue," the letter stated.
"We may well have to curtail vital
medical and biological research on
major campuses throughout the state.
We ask that you not impose unduly
restrictive regulations on our ultra-low
level wastes which present minimal
hazards, in contrast to the much higher
activities and concentrations of low
level' waste from industry," the letter
continued.
Similar letters were sent to the gov
ernors of Nevada, which closed its site
earlier this week, and South Carolina,
which contains the only open disposal
site for such wastes. About HO percent
of the nation's low-level radioactive
wastes, almost all generated in the East,
ends up at the dump near Barnwell,
S.C.
Holmes said California has much de
sert area comparable to that in
Washington and Nevada which could
support a waste disposal site.
"I think such asite could be prepared
and studied within a year if the state
makes a dedicated effort," Holmes
said. There are no existing proposals
for such a site at this time, however, he
added.
