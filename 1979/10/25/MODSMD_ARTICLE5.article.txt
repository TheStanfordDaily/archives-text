# Bankruptcy threatens Berkeley's Daily Cal
## 
### Richard Hefter 
Threatened with bankruptcy and
foreclosure, UC-Berkeley's student
newspaper, The Daily Californian, is
subsisting on funds from donation
drives and alumni contributions, ac
cording to the paper's editor in chief,
Tom Abate.
Increased printing costs and finan
cial mismanagement almost forced the
Daily Cal to shut down last spring until
a Berkeley Student Senate loan of
$52,000 saved the paper from ban
kruptcy, Abate said.
"Every day, we take out $470- bet
ter than a page of advertisements— to
pay back that debt," Abate said. How
ever, he said the long term debt to the
Student Senate is not the most serious
problem facing the paper.
Short term cash needed
"The real danger is tfie short term
cash shortage," he said, explaining that
payment for September ads will not
begin to arrive until December. "We
don't have the cash to meet our print
bills in October and November."
Meeting these expenses requires ex
tensive fund raising, Abate said.
"We just began a donation drive on
campus where we're raffling off funny
prizes like a free year's parking spot
near campus or a free page in the
(Daily) Cal.
"We also took out an ad (for con
tributions) in the California Monthly
(the Cal alumni paper)," he said.
Abate said he hopes to raise $40,000
from the donation drive and alumni
contributions and said the Daily Cal
will also seek help from former staff
members.
Management problems cited
Abate attributed many of the paper's
problems to "some serious problems
last year in management" and told of
some steps taken to make the paper a
tighter ship.
"This year we have reorganized the
business staff. Also, the financial man
ager must supply a budget. We never

had a budget before— something that
was long overdue," he said.
Abate said the term of the paper's
board of directors has been extended
from six months to one year to give
directors more experience and "im
prove the continuity and efficiency in
running the paper."
The Daily Cal's troubles go back to
1971 when the paper declared itself
independent of UC-Berkeley. The uni
versity then began to phase out its sub
sidies of faculty and staff subscriptions,
Abate said.
The Daily Cal was still making
money until about 1976, Abate said,
when the paper added a typesetting
shop while, at the same time, its school
subsidies were completely cut off.
Economic realities struck
Daily Cal general manager Craig
Cordon added, ."The economic
realities of the seventies just hit the
paper.
"Advertisement revenue started flat
tening out in an inflationary time — so
we were really losing. In addition,
printing costs rose dramatically."
Problems intensified last year when
the majority of business department
personnel went on strike after the
board of directors fired the general
manager. "For a period of a month and
a half there was total chaos in the busi
ness department," Abate said.
One of the results of last year's man
agement troubles was $40,000 of "bad
debts" owed to the paper, Abate said.
Uncollectibles high
An audit last summer revealed that
one third of the newspaper's accounts
receivable were not collectible. Those
owing were unable to pay.
Today, the newspaper is working
hard to pay back its debts and merely
survive.
"The morale is good and people are
getting together with the raffle," Gor
don said. "It might take about two
years to become economically self
sufficient."
