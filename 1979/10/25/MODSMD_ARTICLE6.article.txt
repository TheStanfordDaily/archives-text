# Edward Teller labels nuclear energy protesters 'elitists'
## 
### Peter Steinerman 
Dr. Edward Teller, considered
by many to be among the most
brilliant physicists of this century,
has been one of the more outspo
ken scientists in the United States
for several years.
Also known as the "Father of
the H-Bomb" ("It's never sent me
a Father's Day card yet," he has
said), Teller did not literally "in
vent" the H-Bomb; rather, he was
responsible for some of the con
ceptual advances that made its
construction possible.
He was also one of the initial
group of physicists to begin de
signing the first nuclear reactors to
be built in this country.
Teller is also noted for his con
tributions to the development of
thermonuclear weapons, chemi
cal and nuclear physics, and quan
tum theory. He has written several
books dealing with issues related
to energy, politics and science;
Teller's newest, Energy: From
Heaven and Earth, published by
W.H. Freeman and Company,
presents his analysis of the
worldwide energy situation and
the case for nuclear power. He is
currently a Senior Research Fellow
at the Hoover Institution.
Daily: Freeman Dyson, in his new
book "Disturbing the Universe,"
describes you as a person "who

does physics more for fun than for
glory." Is that true?
Teller: (smiles) That's absolutely
true. If I had my choice, I wouldn't
do anything but physics. And when
I am doing politics, it is from some
peculiar sense of obligation which
goes back to the day, after Hitler
invaded Holland and Belgium,
when I heard President (Franklin
D.) Roosevelt say to a Pan American
scientific congress that "unless sci
entists in the Free World will work
on defense, freedom will cease to
exist."
Daily: Dyson also wrote that in 195J
and 7954 you advocated the design
of a reactor that could be operated
in perfect safety by a staff of high
school students. Whatever hap
pened to these plans?
Teller: Freeman .Dyson mentions
that I have been an advocate of
reactor safety. Actually, I was
chairman of the first Reactor
Safeguard Committee and very
worried about reactor safety. The
committee was established by the
Atomic Fnergy Commission in 1948.
And because of the fact that by
industrial reactors which had to
obey the safety regulations which
we started to establish, and which
have been worked much further,
nobody has yet been hurt by a big
regulated industrial reactor. That is
a much better record than any
energy producing industry can

boast about.
However, these big reactors are
certainly not the ones with which
high school students could play. I
wanted such a reactor — and there
are two (presently) that I know of.
Such reactors exist; but I doubt
whether such a reactor will ever
exist if the reactor is really big. Be
cause then it contains so much
radioactivity inside it that very care
ful handling becomes necessary.
We also have learned to do this
careful handling. It is remarkable
that in Three-Mile Island why the
operators mishandled the reactor
in every possible way — and high
school students could hardly have
done worse.
Yet, nobody got hurt. Damage to
the tune of $500 million was pro
duced. It is a better situation that
we pay for our mistakes in dollars
than if we pay for them in lives.
And I think Three Mile Island has
gone a long way to persuade
people to get better educated reac
tor operators — and, what goes
hand in hand with better education
— better paid.
Daily: Referring to the anti-nuclear
movement, you wrote in your book
that the movement has no basis in
fact, but that it stems from an indi
vidual's fear of the unknown. Could
it be more than this?
Teller: There is a peculiar cir
cumstance — that the people who

protested against Vietnam now
protest against nuclear power. One
well known example is )ane Fonda.
Another one, I forget the name
(smiles). . . that man on child rear
ing. . . .
Daily: Dr. Spock?
Teller: Dr. Spock. There is an in
teresting question: What is there in
common between Dr. Spock and
lane Fonda? It is not their know
ledge of nuclear power; it is not
their real expertise in world poli
tics. Perhaps it is their proclivity for
protesting.
Daily: If that is the case, how are
they able to stimulate the younger
people?
Teller: Well,byavariety of means. A
movie actress is good at it. And it
should be no surprise (that) a man
who spent his life finding out the
behavior of small children would
also not be so poor at it.
The fact is, you know, that chil
dren like to be scared. Even grown
ups like to be scared. And if some
body wants to be scared, and wants
to see a horror movie . . . what are
those people called.
Teller: Dracula is the word that I
want. If people want to watch
Dracula, if that is their taste, I have
no objection. But if our political de
cisions, and our economic deci
sions are made on the intellectual
level of Dracula, then I think we are
in for trouble.

Daily: You were once quoted as say
ing that. members of the anti
nuclear movement are "elitists."
Why is that?
Teller: People who oppose nuclear
reactor development are, in many
cases, compulsive protesters.
I want to tell you a rather terrible
story. A lady escaped from that hor

rible massacre in Guyana. And she
was interviewed on television — a
little tactless. At the end the poor
woman said "I lost my relatives. I
lost everything I had ... I don't
know what to do next — I'll join the
anti-nuclear movement!" Having
joined that (Jim Jones) sect was a
step in that direction.
