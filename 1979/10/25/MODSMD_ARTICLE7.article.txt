# 'Perfect place for study breaks'
## Chinese cuisine highlights tea house

Returning students will be
glad to know that Asian Ameri
can food will be served again
this year by the People's Tea
House, which opened for its
seventh year in Wilbur Hall
Oct. 15. New students, too,
can delight in discovering the
unique Far East atmosphere
and in sampling the ethnic
cuisine.
The Tea House is staffed by
thirty or forty student volun
teers. All profits are donated to
Asian American groups on
campus and in the Bay Area.
Organizations requesting
funds usually reciprocate by
volunteering to work in the Tea
House.
This year's managers, Jeff
Wong, Wolf Brolley, Jane
Siguenza and Craig Tramell,
are enthusiastic about improv
ing and expanding the Tea
House.
"We hope to improve the
atmosphere with our new in
terior decorating," said Wong.
"Two new wall murals and new
carpeting will be present this
year."
"We'd like to expand the di
versity of our food," said Brol
ley. "Hopefully, we will get
new specials this year such as
(apanese sushi, a rice roll with
fish or vegetable inside, and
lumpia, which is sort of a Phil
ippine version of the eggroll."
The menu is roughly the
same as it was when the Tea
House first opened. It includes
mostly Chinese cuisine or
dered from restaurants in San

Francisco's China Town. In
past years, popular items have
included chai siu bao, bar
becued pork wrapped in
dough and steamed for 30
cents; Ramen, noodles in a
slightly spicy soup base for 40
cents; and siu mai, ground
pork wrapped in steamed won
tons for 20 cents. Or, for the
less esoteric, ]apanese rice
crackers, almond cookies and
a variety of teas are available.

In recent years, the Tea
House has been patronized by
all members of the Stanford
community. "The operation of
the Tea House is not just an
Asian American activity; it's
open to all members of the
community who would like to
work or eat there," affirmed
Brolley.
"We are a separate entity
from Junipero, the Asian

American theme house on
campus," Wong explained.
However, Junipero has always
been supportive of the Tea
House's operation, he said.
Open Sunday thru Friday, 9
to 12 p.m., the Tea House is a
favorite spot of many students.
In the words of one long-time
patron, "The relaxed atmos
phere is perfect for late night
study breaks."
