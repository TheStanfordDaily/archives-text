INTRODUCING MICHEL GALLOIS —
(Parisian Hair Designer, now in Palo Alto)
It is my business to care and dress hair,
because I know hair . . .
At first, an "ANTOINE" student in PARIS, I mastered
my practice all over Europe (PARIS, CANNES,
DEAUVILLE, LONDON), also doing Hair Shows for the
beauty business (French High Coiffure — CLAIROL —
OREAL — WELLA — TOCO MAGICO).
Today, with NICOLE DEL FRARL my partner,
Le Salon de Coiffure offers a variety of services, to keep
your hair ahead of fashion.
"Les Specialistes de la Chevelure" is something
more significant than just a slogan; it is a service
comprehensive, exclusive and second to none.
You are welcome to visit our salon for a consultation,
entirely free of charge and obligation.
A bientot, Madame.
