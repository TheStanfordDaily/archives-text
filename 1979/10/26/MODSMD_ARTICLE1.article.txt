# Ethics cited as central in Bridge issue

A decision on whether the Bridge
has justified reasons for its use of
University housing space by live-in
student staffers will be reached "as
early as next week, and if not, defi
nitely by Nov. 21," said Director of
Student Activities Thomas Massey.
Massey and resident student staff
members at the Bridge continued
their debate on the live-in staffer
issue yesterday afternoon in Mas
sey's office.
The Bridge is a student-run peer
counseling and information center at
450 Campus Drive. It currently
houses four volunteer student staf
fers.
"The issue at stake is whether only
one student organization should
have live-ins," said Massey. "We
have to ask whether or not this is a
good precedent to set, and it it is not,
we have to ask about alternatives."
Massey said he thinks the Bridge
can function without live-in staffers.
"The Bridge definitely has strong
enough volunteer and financial re
sources to flourish without a live-in
staff."
Resident staff member Craig
Goldman said the Bridge has money
to pay eight workers, but "having
these resources is not what is at
stake. What is crucial," he said; "is
that the Bridge could not continue to
offer its extensive counseling and
community services without the nuc
leus of live-ins."
Goldman noted that no other
< ampus counseling group offers the
combination of 24-hour counseling,
peer counsel training, and commun
ity workshop services ottered by the
Bridge.
Without the four live-ins, he said,
"the Bridge would eventually col
lapse. I doubt if there would be
enough students willing to put in the
time it they couldn't utilize the
Bridge House as an office and home
base."
Massey was particularly concerned
about wh.it he called "the question
of equity." He said there are many
other organizations that could share
the live-in space at the Bridge house.
I am concerned with the tact that by
letting the Bridge have live-in staf
fers, it is getting an unfair compensa
tion of a very scarce resource: hous
ing."
Prior to yesterday's meeting, Mas
sey had asked the Bridge to write up
alternatives to share house space.
The three live-in staffers who met
with Massey presented a report out
lining five alternatives. The five
ranged from having no in-house staf
fers to hiring a full-time, non-student
administrator to provide the services
of present live-ins.
