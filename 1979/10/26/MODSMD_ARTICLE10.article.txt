# LOTS lines vary
## 
### Mark Hosbein 
Low Overhead Time Shar
ing (LOTS) — the academic
computing facility on cam
pus — is infamous for its
long lines, but Manager
Ralph Gorin says that 80
percent of the time there is
little or no wait.
The average student ex
periences "long" waits only
20 percent of the time he
wishes to use the terminal,
according to Gorin.
Students commonly
complain of the queue for
the 64 terminals on campus,
which has grown to as many
as 100 persons at 3 a.m., ac
cording to one student.
But Gorin said that he
saw no point in "spending
more money to increase the
system when most of the
time it will not be used."

"There is a direct correla
tion between long lines and
project due dates," he said.
Management has no
specific plan to alleviate the
crowding problem at this
time, according to Corin.
Corin said that any plans
to expand LOTS would have
to be comprehensive
enough to build on the
whole system as well as ad
ding new features, such as
graphic terminals and a
word-processing machine.
Students using the com
puter agreed that just ad
ding terminals would be of
little use, saying that "in
creasing the system's capac
ity would be the best alter
native." Some plans to do
this are in the works, said
Corin, but nothing official
has been proposed.
