Thomas Edison passed an electric current through a piece of
charred cotton thread in a glass globe, and invented the first light
bulb some 100 years ago in October, 1879. The first bulb's
cousins, dating back to the 1880 sand '90s, are on exhibit and for
sale this montn at the Stanford Museum of Art. Profits from the
sale will go toward the Museum's acquisitions fund. The bulbs,
one of which is shown above, have survived a major earthquake,
two world wars, and a recent move to the Museum's main lobby
during renovations.
