# When the polls disagree
## 
### Associated Press 
Does the American public
support or oppose the
Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty (SALT)
Yes. And no.
It depends upon the poll —
for the percentage in favor has
been reported at anywhere
from 26 to 87 percent.
The wide variation in results
doesn't mean the polls are
wrong. It does show, though,
that polls on complex issues
must be read warily if mistaken
conclusions are to be avoided.
Key to the big swing on SALT
was the way the question was
asked. But a poll's results can
be swayed in other ways.
These include the order of
the questions, whether the in
terview was done in person or
over the phone, the date of the
interview and the skill of the
pollster in analyzing the re»
suits.
And sometimes a poll tries to
define public opinion before
the public has made up its
mind.
"Because there's a percen
tage there, it doesn't mean the
public opinion is there," says
Albert Cantril, president of the
National Council on Public Pol
ling.
Political polls present their
own problems. It's easy for
people to "vote" in the polls
for any imagined ideal. But on
election day, they face imper
fect candidates and com
promise, deciding perhaps
that the candidate who once
looked so unattractive is the
best of the lot.
Professor Philip Converse of
the University of Michigan
mentions yet another problem
with political polls.
"The fuzziest part of these
predictions is who is actually
going to vote" says Converse,
who characterizes attempts to
compensate for it as "the kinds
of games that pollsters get into
— a real art."
And when pollsters try to
make up for flaws in their sam
ple — a disproportionate
number of, say, Democrats on

an election question — they
veer farthest from the science
of polling and more toward its
art.
On the very eve of an elec
tion, however, the art has been
sufficiently refined so that
pollsters can come quite close
to the ultimate result. The elec
torate has by then made final
decisions, and pollsters can
also get a pretty good idea by
then who will vote.
Normally, the only clue to
the soundness of a poll is sam
pling error. But this just recog
nizes that pollsters can't count

on exactly matching the group
interviewed with the whole
population.
Pollsters acknowledge that
sampling error may be far less
important than question word
ing. Yet it is the exact wording
that pollsters often fail to pro
vide or that the media leave out
of poll results.
For example, in the case of
the SALT question — which
embraces concern about
communism, national security
and pacifism, among other
things, what the pollster asked
and how it was asked is crucial.
