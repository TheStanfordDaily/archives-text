# Early campaign money collected
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Cecil An
drus, secretary of the interior,
didn't wait.
He's already anted up a cam
paign contribution. And Presi
dent Jimmy Carter hasn't even
gone through the formality of
saying he'll run.
Press secretary Jody Powell;
U.S. Marshal Earle McLaughlin
of Burlington, Vt.; James Earl
Carter 111, son of the president;
Anne Wexler, an assistant to
the president, and her hus
band, Joseph Duffey,
chairman of the National En
dowment for the Humanities,
didn't wait either.
Each gave $250 to the Carter
campaign.
In politics, early money is the
best. It provides the wherewith
al for a campaign to break
quickly from tne starting gate;
it is the money that raises more
money.
A number of those who work
in the White House, in U.S.
embassies abroad and in the
bureaucracy have hurried in to
help Carter with campaign
contributions.
Reports on file at the Federal
Election Commission show
that John Sullivan, a Carter
classmate at Annapolis ap
pointed to run the F" deral Rail
road Administration, also gave
Carter $250, as did his wife, his
son and his daughter.
Gene Stuckey, a rural mail
carrier in Statesboro, Ga., and
his wife Nellie, gave $1000
each. Stuckey is past president
of the Georgia Rural Letter Car
riers Association.
Of course, most of the $2.4
million raised so far bv the

Carter-Mondale Presidential
Committee came from people
outside government. And
there is nothing in the law to
prevent people who owe their
jobs to Carter from contribut
ing to his campaign.
As yet, there's no accounting
for how much money suppor
ters of Sen. Edward Kennedy
have raised or spent.
Draft Kennedy committees
in the 50 states haven't all filed
reports. Since they are draft
committees and not a candi
date's campaign committee,
the law makes a distinction.
Draft committees may get up
to $5000 from an individual.
Campaign committees may
take no more than $1000 per
contributor before the
primaries and another $1000 in
a general election campaign.
Kennedy will be subject to the
same limits if he becomes a
candidate.
Among reported con
tributors to some Draft Ken
nedy committees are Norman
Lear, the television producer,
$3000; Mark Siegel, who once
worked in the Carter White
House, then quit in disen
chantment, $1000; Ted Ashley,
of Warner Brothers, $4000; and
his wife, Joyce, $5000; Carter
Burden, former New York City
councilman, $1250; movie
producer Margo Winkler,
$5000; former Masachusetts
Gov. Endicott Peabody, $1000;
Charles Bluhdorn, chairman of
Gulf and Western, $5000; and
former New York Post pub
lisher Dorothy Schiff, $250.
