Dear Omniscient Bug Me Person:
How could I not answer a question that starts
out so nicely?
What is the new house that's being built on
Santa Ynez Avenue, about a block off Mayfield?
And, although I know the University doesn't
officially deal with such things, what's the aver
age CPA of a Sta/Hord graduate? (If the school
won't tell you, maybe Phi Beta Kappa will . . . )
Thanks,
lust another curious student.
First things first. Being the investigative repor
ter that I am, I sought the answer to the house
question at the house.
It stands on the corner of Santa Ynez and
Costanzo, across from Koth House. Although
the finishing touches are still being added, the
house has been inhabited since Sept. 1, accord
ing to Andy Arrow. Andy, a student at Cunn
High School, lives there with a brother, a dog
named Joe, and his parents.
Andy's father is Nobel Laureate Professor of
Economics Kenneth Arrow. Arrow, who taught
at Stanford from 1949 to 1969, has returned to
the Farm after a 10-year stint at the 'Stanford of
the East,' Harvard.
Now about the grades. First of all, Stanford
does not compute a CPA for students here.
When needed, they produce something called a
LCI, Letter Grade Indicator. Second of all, there
are no statistics available as to the average LC! of
graduates, or anyone else for that matter.
The reason for this, as various officials re
spond, is that "Stanford just doesn't do that,"
and "that statistic just isn't generated, or asked
for, or wanted."
Phi Beta Kappa was a good suggestion, but
even here the best answer is a partial one. The
honorary organization uses the LCI to get a list
of the members of the senior class with B-plus
averages or better. The only indication of aver
age CPA lies buried somewhere in the fact that
about one third of the senior t lass falls into this

category. Beyond that, a good guess or a com
puter genius is all I can suggest for a better
answer.
Since the very title of this column tends to
generate negative comments from the commun
ity about goings on at Stanford, it's time to give
the other side a chance. This week's Please Me
concerns the new bollards, or vehicle barriers
that are growing around campus.
Replacing the white concrete-filled posts are
new green wooden ones. According to Max
Mazenko of the Planning Office, the replace
ment program itself started this last year, and
will probably be completed by the end of the
calendar year.
"The idea was the concept of the Planning
Office," Mazenko said, both as a result of an
ongoing effort to eliminate vehicles from the
inner campus area, and a lack of aesthetic re
sponse to the old barriers.
The bollards are part of a major project to
reserve the center of campus for bike and foot
traffic only. Along with the wood posts, there
will be two gates installed, similar to the existing
gate behind Memorial Church. One will be
placed near the CERAS Building and the other
on the north side of the Physics Tank.
These gates will be card activated, the cards
being limited to service, emergency and deliv
ery vehicles. There will also be exceptions to
allow access for the physically handicapped.
Ultimately, according to Mazenko, the Plan
ning Office would like to eliminate even motor
cycles and mopeds from the inner campus area.
Specific routes for delivery are also planned.
The green bollards are not complete yet, as
anybody on campus late at night can attest to.
The posts still need to be equipped with white
reflecting discs, so they will be more visible in
the dark.
That's all for this week. Send your questions,
answers and preppie jokes to Bug Me c/o The
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building,

them by the office!
