# The
						Stanford daily OPINIONS
## Kirk Luetkehans Cynicism about senate too cynical 
### 
I would like to thank Mike
Charlson for making me angry
enough to respond to his ASSU
Senate election-day column
("Cynicism about senate,"
Daily, Oct. 16).
I have never been this ex
cited about the senate. Hell, I
have never been so excited
about Stanford, period.
Unfortunately, while his
column excited me enough to
encourage voters in my dorm,
some people were content
with their decision not to vote
and, indeed, used the column
as justification. Charlson's col
umn was not merely "cynical",
it was downright destructive.
His belief that the senate is
hopeless infuriates me.
Charlson said that the senate in
past years has been "essen
tially worthless," and con
dudes that "it won't really mat
ter who we vote for. The result
will be the same."
I might just as easily say that I
believe the United States Se
nate has been "essentially
worthless" in the past, so it
makes no difference who we
vote for, or, indeed, whether
we vote at all, because the Se
nate will remain worthless re
gardless of the individuals we
elect.
I don't believe this. And I
can't believe Charlson. He evi
dently finds the ASSU Senate a
bunch of "(profanity de
leted)," and that's okay insofar
as everyone is entitled to an
opinion. I only hope he feels
this way because he's a senior
and figures he'll soon be "outa'
here."

What I found more disturb
ing than Charlson's negative at
titude about the senate in gen
eral was his grouping of the
candidates into three "types."
I find it hard to believe that any
of the candidates fits these
stereotypes, let alone the
majority of those candidates.
But perhaps Charlson has
developed this impression be
cause he only read the posters.
I must admit that after reading
dozens of campaign posters
they did seem to be repetiti
ous. But I didn't let this color
my opinion of the candidates.
Rather, I asked questions if I
met a candidate on my way to
class. Charlson might have
been surprised to find how
truly informed and sincere the
candidates are.
If I read Charlson correctly,
he figures that since the ad
ministration, championed by
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson, is working on
the housing shortage, we all
ought to let it be.
Baloney. Charlson himself
points out that it's been "over a
year" since the administration
began action on the problem.
He adds that the senate
won't have anything to say
about the housing issue be
cause a "program proposal" is
to be delivered to the Board of
Trustees in December. There
tore, he leels the candidate
who would demand a new
dormitory be built is campaign
ing uselessly.
Golly, gee. Does this mean
that the trustees are obligated
to approve the proposal, and

that construction will get
under waytin time to usher in a
new and larger freshman class?
None of us is into such heavy
duty daydreaming.
I hope the architects who vis
ited my dorm last year were
joking when they told me that
even if the proposal were acted
on immediately, we might not
see construction for another
three to five years.
The candidate who is excited
enough to say he'll demand a
new dorm be built might be
just the catalyst the ASSU
needs.
The housing issue encom
passes much more than an end
to the housing shortage.
Changes in the Draw, better
off-campus-living oppor
tunities and room improve
ments were among the cam
pa'gn proposals.
Merely because a candidate
declares that housing is a prior
ity item does not mean he is ig
norant, naive or stupid, as
Charlson would have us be
lieve. I think that such a candi
date means to get the job done
as soon, and as well, as possi
ble.
Let me comment on another
of Charlson's points. He was
disappointed in the ASSU bal
lot, citing "ingenious coding
methods" which won't allow
us to know who we are voting
tor. I can't believe it was that
hard for him to figure out. I
wish I had been there to help
him (it he voted).
Furthermore, I'll bet
everyone who voted could
have helped him fill out the bal

lot correctly. Anyone who
could not understand the very
clear directions on the ballot
must somehow have bypassed
the SATs.
The only improvements I
could see would be to state
that one needn't vote tor 10
candidates and to provide a
mechanism for abstaining on
referendum items which vot
ers were not educated about.
Actually, Charlson is no
more cynical about the ASSU
Senate than are many of my
friends. But things can change
only if we help them along.
I might not have been so
angry had the Daily practiced a
little editorial discretion and
printed Charlson's column in
time for others to respond.
Instead, his column was run
on the day of the election,
when many students wonder it
they should bother with the
"hassle" of voting.
I hope he didn't push too
many students over the edge.
I look forward to the orienta
tion of the new senate be
cause, like Charlson, I feel past
senates have been ineffectual.
This is all the more reason to
take a more serious view of the
ASSU elections.
As for Charlson's prayers for
the health and safety of the
ASSU Council of Presidents ("
. . . only they seem endowed
with the ability to get anything
done"), I'm sure they ap
preciate the thought, but I
think they would have been
even more appreciative ot
some vestige of hope in his
closing remarks. I know the
COP is eager to begin working
with the senate.
It promises to be a pleasant
surprise.
