## Controlling our technology 
### 
Several years ago, n the
town of Worcester, Mas
sachusetts, I attended a poetry
reading given by Daniel Berri
gan. The crowd, which seemed
to be made up mostly of former
New England anti-war activists,
was larger than the planning
committee had anticipated,
and the reading was moved to a
more spacious room.
After the new sound system
had been hastily set up, Kerri
gan walked up to the podium
and spoke into the mic
rophone. It crackled and his
sed, then went dead.
Berrigan was untroubled by
the problem. "Life must be
great here in Worcester," he
commented wryly and to en
thusiastic applause. "Your
technology is really lousy."
This sort of attitude was de
rigueur among Berrigan and
other social activists in the
early 70's. The values of
technology were considered
antithetical to those of human
life. The increasing develop
ment and use of technology in
both peaceful and military ap
plications was seen as mis

guided, or in extreme cases,
malevolent.
Technology seemed to be in
control of Western man, and
was identified as the source of
his widespread sense of aliena
tion and despair.
Things seem a bit different
now. For one thing, the public
debate about environmental
and energy issues has grown
more sophisticated. Even the
most radical environmentalist
concedes that technological
approaches must be a part of
any solution to our environ
mental and energy problems.
Technology and human exis
tence are no longer seen as
mutually exclusive by nature.
Privately, too, Americans are
approaching technology with a
different attitude. The energy
crunch has brought out a
whole flock of engineers and
entrepreneurs, busily design
ing, building, and marketing all
sorts of energy-efficient
gadgets: automobiles, stoves,
windmills, electrical
appliances and even wind
powered cargo ships.

One of the hopeful aspects
of this new view of technology
is that it represents an attempt
to control — at the grass roots
level — the very technological
forces which have hitherto
seemed to be in control. It is in
keeping with the tone of the
late 70s that this should be so.
The contemporary with
drawal into the self, whatever
ill effects it has had on large
scale activism, has at least
prompted Americans to take
more responsibility for their
own lives (if we can believe the
rhetoric of the times).
Taken far enough, this em
phasis on self-development
could help to alleviate the
"crisis of confidence" which
seems so evident in America
today.
Among the several diverse
manifestations of the current
national mood are at least two
which seem possible candi
dates for the renewal of Ameri
can confidence. Both involve
the judicious use of technol
ogy-
The first is the emphasis,
begun in the 60s, on the indi
vidual's role in the state of his
or her own physical health. It is
now becoming clear that per
sonal lifestyle (including diet,
amount of physical exercise
and emotional state) is at least
as important a determinant of
an individual's health as the
sort of medical care he or she is
able to receive.
Vegetarianism, bicycling,
jogging, organic gardening
and natural childbirth are all
expressions of this realization.
The other encouraging trend
is the growth of the movement
to oppose nuclear energy,
primarily on the grounds that it
is particularly liable to escape
from human control, and, in an
uncontrolled state, poses un
acceptable risks to public
health.
It is not obvious that the
anti-nuclear and self-health
care movements will win the
day. Nor is it obvious that, if
they do succeed, their success
will result in a new sense of
purpose for Americans. It is,
however, encouraging to think
that this might be so.
One thing is certainly clear.
No political "hero" is going to
instill a permanent sense of
confidence into America.
Motivation and meaning come
from within the individual,
from choices properly made
and solutions commonly pur
sued.
If America is to re-establish
herself as a humanizing force
at home and abroad, she will
do so because her citizens
have decided upon it. There is
no other way.
