And only the Master shall praise us,
and only the Master shall blame;
And no one shall work for money
And no one shall work for fame;
But each for the joy of the working
and each, in his separate star,
Shall draw the Thing as he sees it,
tor the Cod of things as they are!
—Rudyard Kipling
. What a marvelous work ethic Kipling de
scribes in this verse! It appears that he is dream
ing of a society in which money and tame take
the back seat to the satisfaction one derives
from working hard.
Such an ethic didn't exist in Kipling's day, nor
does it widely exist in our own time.
fortunately, one of the last great storehouses
of such a work ethic is our own Stanford Univer
sity, for if one takes a close look at our campus,
we find isolated examples of jobs that afford the
employee that great fulfillment about which Ki
pling so admirably writes.
Anybody with a burning desire to work solely
lor the sake ot working should examine closely
the six jobs I am about to describe.
I therefore present "Stanford's Six Most UN
IQUE Jobs." Potential employees, take heed!
I begin with the "comfy desk jobs."
1) Undergraduate Library Book-Checker -
Now, here's the desk job that can only appeal to
a special human being, tor 'lie scholar who
holds this position must align with certain
criteria.
Initially, the book-checker must be a master in
the art of deception. He must be able to de
monstrate proficiency at appearing to be look
ing in a bookbag while actually reflecting upon
the Bugs Bunny short shown at the previous
Sunday's tlick.
He must be schooled in the art of talking on
the telephone for long periods of time in bet
ween calculus problem sets.
Though it is not imperative, it would help if
the prospective employee had had some train
ing with the shot put because he would there
lore be in shape to perform the many complex
llicks ol the wrists that signify passage in front of
his desk without inspection.
For the future-oriented individual, this job is
recommended as a great stepping stone to later
service with U.S. Customs Inspections.
2) Stanford Parking Enforcement Officer ( a
roving "desk" job) — If public service interests
you, this may be just where you belong.
join the corps ol the physically-fit who stand
ever ready lor active duty, pen in one hand, pad
in the other. Though fully equipped land-rovers
are provided lor transportation, dedicated of
ficers often choose to hike across campus,
forever-seeking ultimate fulfillment: a shiny,
bare rear bumper just begging to be ticketed.
Experienced commanders lead platoons into

the field into such far-away areas as Mem Aud,
Tresidder, and, dare we say, the fraternities! Big
bonuses stand waiting tor most "green stamps"
handed out per month, so don't hesitate to join
the forces today.
So much for the comfy "desk jobs," I now
entreat you to listen up if meeting many new
people is your desire.
3) Noontime White Plaza Preacher — Have) ou
ever wanted to be the individual who brightens
up the day for thousands of students who just
haven't "heard the word?" Here's the perfect
opportunity to take your case right to the
people.
This job is recommended tor ex-encyclopedia
salesmen who have always dreamed of being
able to give just one speech without having a
door slammed in their face.
A good performance could open up the door
to a wide variety of better jobs, perhaps in TV or
the movies, it you are convincing enough. Isn't
this how all the great stars got their start?
4) White Plaza Cushion Vendor — That's right,
It you're up for it, you might just qualify for this
opportunity to serve as master over a pile of
large cushions that never seem to get bought.
Never tear, though, because we'll make sure
that your cushions are strategically located
amidst great of bike traffic, thus giving
you the chance to break someone's fall in the
case ot an accident.
A good speaking manner is not needed; all
you have to do is sit there and meditate.
Besides, who knows when someone just
might want an inter-dorm pillow fight catered!
Finally, we present two jobs that have yet to be
created, but are seen as potential smash hits for
the Stanford campus.
5) President of "Stanford Students for McClos
key" — This is solely a "volunteer" position, but
if we just can't get the "right" type of person for
the job, the congressman himself might just feel
inclined towards some sort of "alternative selec
tion policy" with an option for community ser
vice instead.
6) Coffee House Fund- Raising Chairman -
This job would entail active solicitation, dorm
to-dorm, in search ot funds lor Stanford's most
exclusive hang-out.
Enlisting wide student support might be dif
ficult, but don't worry, big business has ways of
dealing with these problems.
One word of caution, however, notice of ter
mination of employment may be given without
notice, regardless of the quality of performance.
All in all, this campus offers many unique
employment opportunities suited to your own
particular tastes. Kipling's work ethics are not
dead after all!
Besides, it nothing else suits your fancy,
there's always a Daily column!

there's always a Daily column!

glish. His column appears every three weeks.)
And only the Master shall praise us,
and only the Master shall blame;
And no one shall work for money
And no one shall work for fame;
But each for the joy of the working
and each, in his separate star,
Shall draw the Thing as he sees it,
tor the Cod of things as they are!
—Rudyard Kipling
. What a marvelous work ethic Kipling de
scribes in this verse! It appears that he is dream
ing of a society in which money and tame take
the back seat to the satisfaction one derives
from working hard.
Such an ethic didn't exist in Kipling's day, nor
does it widely exist in our own time.
fortunately, one of the last great storehouses
of such a work ethic is our own Stanford Univer
sity, for if one takes a close look at our campus,
we find isolated examples of jobs that afford the
employee that great fulfillment about which Ki
pling so admirably writes.
Anybody with a burning desire to work solely
lor the sake ot working should examine closely
the six jobs I am about to describe.
I therefore present "Stanford's Six Most UN
IQUE Jobs." Potential employees, take heed!
I begin with the "comfy desk jobs."
1) Undergraduate Library Book-Checker -
Now, here's the desk job that can only appeal to
a special human being, tor 'lie scholar who
holds this position must align with certain
criteria.
Initially, the book-checker must be a master in
the art of deception. He must be able to de
monstrate proficiency at appearing to be look
ing in a bookbag while actually reflecting upon
the Bugs Bunny short shown at the previous
Sunday's tlick.
He must be schooled in the art of talking on
the telephone for long periods of time in bet
ween calculus problem sets.
Though it is not imperative, it would help if
the prospective employee had had some train
ing with the shot put because he would there
lore be in shape to perform the many complex
llicks ol the wrists that signify passage in front of
his desk without inspection.
For the future-oriented individual, this job is
recommended as a great stepping stone to later
service with U.S. Customs Inspections.
2) Stanford Parking Enforcement Officer ( a
roving "desk" job) — If public service interests
you, this may be just where you belong.
join the corps ol the physically-fit who stand
ever ready lor active duty, pen in one hand, pad
in the other. Though fully equipped land-rovers
are provided lor transportation, dedicated of
ficers often choose to hike across campus,
forever-seeking ultimate fulfillment: a shiny,
bare rear bumper just begging to be ticketed.
Experienced commanders lead platoons into

the field into such far-away areas as Mem Aud,
Tresidder, and, dare we say, the fraternities! Big
bonuses stand waiting tor most "green stamps"
handed out per month, so don't hesitate to join
the forces today.
So much for the comfy "desk jobs," I now
entreat you to listen up if meeting many new
people is your desire.
3) Noontime White Plaza Preacher — Have) ou
ever wanted to be the individual who brightens
up the day for thousands of students who just
haven't "heard the word?" Here's the perfect
opportunity to take your case right to the
people.
This job is recommended tor ex-encyclopedia
salesmen who have always dreamed of being
able to give just one speech without having a
door slammed in their face.
A good performance could open up the door
to a wide variety of better jobs, perhaps in TV or
the movies, it you are convincing enough. Isn't
this how all the great stars got their start?
4) White Plaza Cushion Vendor — That's right,
It you're up for it, you might just qualify for this
opportunity to serve as master over a pile of
large cushions that never seem to get bought.
Never tear, though, because we'll make sure
that your cushions are strategically located
amidst great of bike traffic, thus giving
you the chance to break someone's fall in the
case ot an accident.
A good speaking manner is not needed; all
you have to do is sit there and meditate.
Besides, who knows when someone just
might want an inter-dorm pillow fight catered!
Finally, we present two jobs that have yet to be
created, but are seen as potential smash hits for
the Stanford campus.
5) President of "Stanford Students for McClos
key" — This is solely a "volunteer" position, but
if we just can't get the "right" type of person for
the job, the congressman himself might just feel
inclined towards some sort of "alternative selec
tion policy" with an option for community ser
vice instead.
6) Coffee House Fund- Raising Chairman -
This job would entail active solicitation, dorm
to-dorm, in search ot funds lor Stanford's most
exclusive hang-out.
Enlisting wide student support might be dif
ficult, but don't worry, big business has ways of
dealing with these problems.
One word of caution, however, notice of ter
mination of employment may be given without
notice, regardless of the quality of performance.
All in all, this campus offers many unique
employment opportunities suited to your own
particular tastes. Kipling's work ethics are not
dead after all!

there's always a Daily column!
