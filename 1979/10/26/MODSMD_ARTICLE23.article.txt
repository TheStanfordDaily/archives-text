Bridge live-ins'
Having limited myself tor the
sake of objectivity in my writ
ing of the article, I will now ex
press my opinions regarding
the possible ejection of resi
dent Bridge staffers, and also
clarify certain issues raised in
Monday s article "Live-in staf
fers ..." (Daily, Oct. 22).
First, the use of "evicted" in
the headline implies a direct
confrontation concerning only
The Bridge and Director of
Student Activities Thomas
Massey.
It should be made clear that
consultation between those
two parties on the matter ex
tends well back into the previ
ous academic year.
Also, while Massey has juris
diction over how The Bridge
organization is run, the build
ing is under the auspices of
Cowell Health Service, and is
intended for use by counsel
ling groups.
The article further stated,
"Some groups formerly
housed at The Bridge have
been moved out." They
moved, but in case anyone
drew the implication, they
were not kicked out by The
Bridge.
Space for student organiza
tions is the basic issue in this
affair: physical space to carry
on their activities and human
space in which to provide their
services to those who need and
want them.
Lack of physical space is os
tensibly the reason Massey is
bearing down on The Bridge.
Denying the value of live-in
staffers, Massey points out that
no other peer-counseling
groups on campus have them.
But other counseling groups

don't offer the range and depth
of services that The Bridge
does twenty-four hours a day.
Volunteers aren't likely to be
so dedicated that round-the
clock service could be con
tinued.
In arbitrarily limiting the use
of physic al space at The Bridge
to his notion of their worth,
Massey is crushing the human
space of a vital service organi
zation.
If indeed student organiza
tions are so hard-pressed for
space, let us find it for them.
But don't cut out one of the few
truly human places on campus
in an arbitrary bureaucratic
power push.

Tired of dispute
It seems to me that the Cof
fee House dispute has dragged
on long enough. Will it con
tinue indefinitely?
The fired employees strug
gle to make their views known,
TDS issues an "Open State
ment" (costing over $500, I un
derstand), and the Council of
Presidents maintains a discreet
distance.
Meanwhile, lhose of us who
support the Coffee House
boycott feel cheated out of an
important campus facility — a
facility that, by rights, should
not be governed by those who
have no stake in the campus
social life.
COP member Sibby
Freeman claims that a solution
depends upon "emerging
leadership." I agree. Leader
ship, from the COP, would un
doubtedly help to solve the
dispute.
It seems odd even to have to

suggest that the COP take ac
tion on this matter. A few years
ago, I suspect, student gov
ernment would immediately
have turned a critical and in
quiring gaze on such a prob
lem.
I may be prejudiced, but I
grow more convinced that a
third party needs to probe and
clarify the issues of this dispute
when I read an apologia such
as the "Open Statement."
After considering such
choice phrases as "broad spec
trum," "flat revenues cor
rected tor inflation," "poten
tial purchasing efficiencies"
and "terminated staff and
management," I can hardly
help but think that something
crucial to the Coffee House —
a certain indeoendence, an
unwillingness to sacrifice
character to real or imagined
economic exigencies — has
been drained away.
A little leadership would in
deed be welcome. In the
meantime, I'll continue to
support the boycott.

Why Koko?
The San Francisco Chronicle
reported on Monday, Oct. 22,
that Penny Patterson and Pro
ject Koko are being evicted
from the Stanford campus.
In 1972, Penny Patterson,
then a Ph.D. candidate, moved
a young female lowland gorilla
named Koko into a trailer on
the campus. Thus began Pro
ject Koko, the first attempt to
teach a gorilla to use sign lan
guage.
The seven years since then
have been productive: Penny
has received her Ph. D. and

Koko converses regularly in
American Sign Language.
Project Koko has attracted
international attention. Na
tional Geographic magazine
did a feature article on the pro
ject last October, and Jane
Goodall visited the project in
April.
The project is supported bv
National Geographic and by
the Gorilla Foundation, an or
ganization of over 1600 indi
viduals interested in the pro
ject.
The University has provided
no financial support for the
project, and now insists that
the gorillas present a danger
and must be removed from
Stanford property.
This judgment was made by
University administrators and
researchers who have no direct
experience with gorillas.
Moreover, Stanford has a re
search facility well suited to the
Koko Project — the Stanford
Outdoor Primate Facility
(SOPF) — but has chosen to
use it to breed apes for medical
research instead. (These apes
will be sold for profit.)
Project Koko is by far the
most successful research effort
in interspecies communica
tion. Koko has a vocabulary of
more than 375 signs and has
achieved a score of 95 on the
Stanford-Binet IO Test.
When asked "Y-O-U A-N
-l-M-A-L O-R P-E-R-S-O-N?"
Koko replied: "F-l-N-E A-N
-l-M-A-L G-O-R-l-L-L-A."
Shown a picture of a horse with
a bit in its mouth, Koko signed
"H-O-R-S-E S-A-D." Asked
why, she replied: "T-E-E-T-H."
And Stanford is breeding
apes for profit.

Also, while Massey has juris
diction over how The Bridge
organization is run, the build
ing is under the auspices of
Cowell Health Service, and is
intended for use by counsel
ling groups.
The article further stated,
"Some groups formerly
housed at The Bridge have
been moved out." They
moved, but in case anyone
drew the implication, they
were not kicked out by The
Bridge.
Space for student organiza
tions is the basic issue in this
affair: physical space to carry
on their activities and human
space in which to provide their
services to those who need and
want them.
Lack of physical space is os
tensibly the reason Massey is
bearing down on The Bridge.
Denying the value of live-in
staffers, Massey points out that
no other peer-counseling
groups on campus have them.
But other counseling groups

don't offer the range and depth
of services that The Bridge
does twenty-four hours a day.
Volunteers aren't likely to be
so dedicated that round-the
clock service could be con
tinued.
In arbitrarily limiting the use
of physic al space at The Bridge
to his notion of their worth,
Massey is crushing the human
space of a vital service organi
zation.
If indeed student organiza
tions are so hard-pressed for
space, let us find it for them.
But don't cut out one of the few
truly human places on campus
in an arbitrary bureaucratic
power push.

Tired of dispute
It seems to me that the Cof
fee House dispute has dragged
on long enough. Will it con
tinue indefinitely?
The fired employees strug
gle to make their views known,
TDS issues an "Open State
ment" (costing over $500, I un
derstand), and the Council of
Presidents maintains a discreet
distance.
Meanwhile, lhose of us who
support the Coffee House
boycott feel cheated out of an
important campus facility — a
facility that, by rights, should
not be governed by those who
have no stake in the campus
social life.
COP member Sibby
Freeman claims that a solution
depends upon "emerging
leadership." I agree. Leader
ship, from the COP, would un
doubtedly help to solve the
dispute.
It seems odd even to have to

suggest that the COP take ac
tion on this matter. A few years
ago, I suspect, student gov
ernment would immediately
have turned a critical and in
quiring gaze on such a prob
lem.
I may be prejudiced, but I
grow more convinced that a
third party needs to probe and
clarify the issues of this dispute
when I read an apologia such
as the "Open Statement."
After considering such
choice phrases as "broad spec
trum," "flat revenues cor
rected tor inflation," "poten
tial purchasing efficiencies"
and "terminated staff and
management," I can hardly
help but think that something
crucial to the Coffee House —
a certain indeoendence, an
unwillingness to sacrifice
character to real or imagined
economic exigencies — has
been drained away.
A little leadership would in
deed be welcome. In the
meantime, I'll continue to
support the boycott.

Why Koko?
The San Francisco Chronicle
reported on Monday, Oct. 22,
that Penny Patterson and Pro
ject Koko are being evicted
from the Stanford campus.
In 1972, Penny Patterson,
then a Ph.D. candidate, moved
a young female lowland gorilla
named Koko into a trailer on
the campus. Thus began Pro
ject Koko, the first attempt to
teach a gorilla to use sign lan
guage.
The seven years since then
have been productive: Penny
has received her Ph. D. and

Koko converses regularly in
American Sign Language.
Project Koko has attracted
international attention. Na
tional Geographic magazine
did a feature article on the pro
ject last October, and Jane
Goodall visited the project in
April.
The project is supported bv
National Geographic and by
the Gorilla Foundation, an or
ganization of over 1600 indi
viduals interested in the pro
ject.
The University has provided
no financial support for the
project, and now insists that
the gorillas present a danger
and must be removed from
Stanford property.
This judgment was made by
University administrators and
researchers who have no direct
experience with gorillas.
Moreover, Stanford has a re
search facility well suited to the
Koko Project — the Stanford
Outdoor Primate Facility
(SOPF) — but has chosen to
use it to breed apes for medical
research instead. (These apes
will be sold for profit.)
Project Koko is by far the
most successful research effort
in interspecies communica
tion. Koko has a vocabulary of
more than 375 signs and has
achieved a score of 95 on the
Stanford-Binet IO Test.
When asked "Y-O-U A-N
-l-M-A-L O-R P-E-R-S-O-N?"
Koko replied: "F-l-N-E A-N
-l-M-A-L G-O-R-l-L-L-A."
Shown a picture of a horse with
a bit in its mouth, Koko signed
"H-O-R-S-E S-A-D." Asked
why, she replied: "T-E-E-T-H."
And Stanford is breeding
apes for profit.
