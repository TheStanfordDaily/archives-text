# Author claims intelligence drops with assignments
## More homework in high schools urged 
### Steve Brown 
"We must enhance the authority of the
public school teacher in the classroom,
see that more work is assigned and that
higher standards are set" Paul Copper
man, author of The Literary Hoax and
founder of the Institute of Reading De
velopment, said in a speech here last
week.
Major testing organizations refuse to
disclose statistics that showa "dangerous"
17 percentile drop in high school intelli
gence scores, Copperman said in a speech
sponsored by the Speakers Bureau and the
Publications Board.
"If you took a typical 1963 eighth grade
class of 28 and replaced the seven
brightest students with seven who were
below average, you would have a class
with 1978 reading and math skills," he told
his Tresidder audience.
Political solution
Copperman has testified before the
House Select Committee on Education
about the skills decline and said he is
"convinced that the solution has to be a
political one." Textbook publishers, pro
fessors of education and bureaucrats pro
fit but "children have a lot to lose from the

status quo," he said.
Copperman blamed collective bargain
ing for giving teachers unions control of
policy decisions. Because of tenure, he
said, "It's very hard to fire someone unless
they pull down their pants in front of the
class." Rules also make it impossible to
require teachers to stay after school for
remedial help, he added.
"The skill that's declined most dramati
cally is writing, said Copperman. He
partly blamed !ewt>r homework assign
ments, citing a University of Washington
study that showed high school students
going on to college write 2.5 essays a year
compared to 18 to 36 written in the 19605.
Class hours shorter
Changes in curriculum are also to
blame, said Copperman. "The average
student receives 30 percent fewer hours of
academic instruction than 15 years ago."
He criticized the change from a required
to an elective curriculum and the resulting
shift to more popular and easier classes.
For political and racial reasons the De
partment of Health, Education and Wel
fare has forced schools to eliminate ability
groupings so that students cannot be di

vided according to their academic skills,
Copperman said.
This forces curriculum to be
downgraded and textbooks rewritten with
a simpler vocabulary for the slower stu
dents, he said. "This especially hurts the
bright kids," he added.
Gifted kids deprived
Copperman noted that skills of top stu
dents have dropped at twice the average
rate. The gifted child today is the most
deprived member of society," he said.
A change in the relationship between
adolescents and adults has resulted in less
authority and discipline in the classroom,
according to Copperman. The older gen
eration once "set the standards and the
values ol young people" he said. But with
the "baby boom," resistance grew and at
tacks on the old educational philosophy
were made.
Some critics have "urged teachers to
abandon their destructive and exploita
tive' role in the classroom which was be
lieved to cause anxiety in children," Cop
perman said. The result is that teachers are
no longer as "demanding and don't main
tain order."
