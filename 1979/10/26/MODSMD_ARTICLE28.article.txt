# Stanford visits hapless OSU
## SPORTS 
### Peter Finch 
Considering what we've
seen so far, it seems as though
there are only two possible
outcomes for Stanford's con
frontation with Oregon State
tomorrow.
a) A confident Cardinal
squad invades Corvallis and
ruthlessly destroys a hapless
Beaver team, or
b) An over-confident Stan
ford unit floats northward and,
unbelievably, suffers a
humiliating defeat.
Of course, there are proba
bly countless numbers of other
ways the game could be de
cided, but these are certainly
two of the most likely.
Hot off a 30-10 trouncing of
Arizona's Wildcats, a tie with
mighty USC and a miraculous
win over UCLA, Rod
Dowhower's Cards are picked
as 21-point favorites tomor
row. And while (as any Stan
ford player will attest) odds
don't really mean a thing, the
Cards are easily capable of win
ning by three touchdowns.
First of all, Oregon State is
without a coach — well, sort of
without one. Craig Fertig,
whose contract with the Beav
ers extends through the end of
this year, was fired last week.
Yet he is still coaching, and
will continue to do so until his
contract runs out.
Secondly, the Beavers are
riding on a school-record

nine-game losing streak, hav
ing dropped seven straight this
year, and their final two last
year.
So, can OSU do anything
right?
By all means. Their "star,"
wide receiver Steve Coury, i«
the Pacific-10 Conference's
leading receiver. So far this year
he has 40 receptions. Coming
into tomorrow's contest,
Coury has caught a pass in 21
straight games and is just nine
short of OSU's all-time record
of 109 career receptions.
Tailback Daryl Minor, whose
104-yard rushing effort against
San Jose State last week was
the first 100-yard game by an
OSU running back since 1977,
is listed as the team's top run
ner. Fullback Mike Smith, who
leads the Beavers in rushing
with 295 yards, did not play
against San Jose State because
of fractured ribs. It is doubtful
that he will play tomorrow.
At the quarterback spot for
the Beavers is Scott
Richardson. A junior,
Richardson has, according to
OSU coaches, matured con
siderably since his freshman
year when he was thrust into a
starting role against USC, Stan
ford, and rival Oregon because
of injuries to other Beaver
quarterbacks.
"Scott is a very adequate
runner and a good passer,"
Fertig said. "And his most out

standing trait is his leadership
and intelligence in play selec
tion and decisions."
So far this season Richardson
is hitting on 44.4 percent of his
passes for a gain of 973 yards.
He threw two interceptions
against San Jose State (his 11th
and 12th of the year), and com
pleted just 15 of 39 attempts.
His one touchdown pass last
week was only his second of
the year.
The Beaver defense has
given up an average of 36
points per game. End Nick
Westerberg and tackle Tom
Schillinger have been the only
real standouts on OSU's de
fensive team.
Westerberg, whom Fertig
calls "a madman," has 55 tack
les so far, and has caused three
fumbles. Schillinger, also an
outstanding discus, shot put,
and hammer thrower, is cre
dited with 41 tackles.
"We look forward to going
to Corvallis, but we're also
wary of Oregon State,"
Dowhower said. "They've got
their backs up against the wall,
and there's always the possibil
ity that they'll get tired of it and
rise to the occasion. There's
the human factor that many
people don't realize."
Dowhower's team has been
doing some rising to the occa
sion of its own lately, so he
knows what he's talking about.
After starting off incredibly

sluggishly, the Cards have re
directed their fortunes to the
tune of a four-game unbeaten
string and a tie for first place in
the run for the Rose Bowl.
The biggest reason behind
Stanford's turnaround is the
performance of quarterback
Turk Schonert. Now throwing
at a healthy 64.8 completion
percentage, Schonert is above
both the Pac-10 (64.1 percent
by Cal's Paul Larson) and Stan
ford (Steve Dils with 63.2 per
cent) single season marks.
Freshman halfbacks Mike
Dotterer and Vincent White
also continue to grind out yar
dage. And as of Saturday, the
young runners have combined
for 50 catches, the same
number of receptions grabbed
by Darrin Nelson in each of his
last two campaigns.
Greg Hooper, another
freshman, rambled for 62 key
yards from his fullback spot.
He will back up senior Jim
Brown in the line-up against
the Beavers, but should see
plenty of action tomorrow.
Defensively, the Cards
forced five Arizona turnovers,
two interceptions and three
fumbles. Standouts against the
Wildcats were inside linebac
kers Dave Morze (15 tackles,
one interception) and Craig
Zellmer (11 tackles, one fum
ble recovery) and safety Steve
Foley (eight tackles, one pass

standoff with the Trojans. Tomorrow, the much-improved Stanford defense faces the Oregon State
Beavers, whose only trait in common with (JSC is that they belong to the same conference.
