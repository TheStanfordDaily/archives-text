# Friday interview features Nancys White and Jackson
## 
### 
Field hockey, an increasingly successful sport
at Stanford, is the focus for Sally Jenkins' Friday
interview this week. Jenkins talked with co
captains Nancy White and Nancy Jackson about
the growing but still relatively obscure field hoc
key program at the Farm.
Jenkins: It seems like hockey is dying out. Do
you think so?
While: Well, it's really big in the East, and I think
it's even growing. Some ot the strongest teams
now are places like Delaware and Penn. More
players, I think, are wanting to compete at a
higher level, and so the level is improving every
year.
lenkins: As co-captains of the team, what do you
include as your responsibilities? How do you
approach it?
Jackson: Everything from recruiting, and taking
people around to classes and showing them
something other than the hockey aspect, to
being a liaison between the coach and the team.
White: Leadership on the field —when the team
is dragging it's our responsibility. People look to
us to start that spark.
lenkins: You are 8-1-1 this year, which is much
better than last year. Flow far do you think you
can go? Flave you thought about it yet?
Jackson: We're planning on making Nationals.
White: We've got a really good chance. That's
our goal right now.
Jackson: But when we get there we'd really like
to show them that the West can play hockey.
Jenkins: Have you seen the program at Stanford
improve noticeably since you've been here?
Jackson: Tremendously, yes. When we first got
here we had a coach who basically didn't do
anything. There was no recruiting, no scholar
ships. . . .
Jenkins: Who was that?
White: I don't think you should have said that
(laughing).
Jackson: Well anyway, we got a new coach (Bar

bara Longstreth) after our freshman year and
since then — well, this year we have 17 new
freshmen, and most of them were recruited,
and the amazing thing is the junior varsity. Two
years ago we were putting ads in the paper to get
people to play, and now we've got loads of
people.
Jenkins: Do you find a lot of interest in the game
here, or apathy?
White: Growing interest. My freshman year
there were very few people out to see a game.
This year we've had a good crowd. The stands
have been filled for every game, which is some
thing we've never seen before.
Jenkins: What kind of improvements would you
make on the team rignt now?
White: Experience. Playing together, and shar
pening up all the aspects of the game. The basics
are there, it's just a matter of practicing and
playing in games.
Jenkins: As captains, do you feel capable at this
point of moving the team, getting them going?
Jackson: Whoever is captain, the team kind of
looks towards her. If they see her really going,
that gets them more motivated.
White: Sometimes it's frustrating when you
know that the team is so good, and has so much
potential, and you see them not concentrating.
That's when you get frustrated, and you say
'Stop it, let's play." But that doesn't happen very
often.
Jenkins: What's the most enjoyable aspect of
hockey for you?
Jackson: Mainly being able to get out there and
play with a team, a good team, and testing my
self athletically. And being with the people. It's a
good group of people.
White: The camaraderie really makes it worth it.
It's a game based on team effort as well as indi
vidual effort. Because it's such a fun group of
people to work with, you work hard, and we're
successful at it.

can go? Flave you thought about it yet?
Jackson: We're planning on making Nationals.
White: We've got a really good chance. That's
our goal right now.
Jackson: But when we get there we'd really like
to show them that the West can play hockey.
Jenkins: Have you seen the program at Stanford
improve noticeably since you've been here?
Jackson: Tremendously, yes. When we first got
here we had a coach who basically didn't do
anything. There was no recruiting, no scholar
ships. . . .
Jenkins: Who was that?
White: I don't think you should have said that
(laughing).
Jackson: Well anyway, we got a new coach (Bar

bara Longstreth) after our freshman year and
since then — well, this year we have 17 new
freshmen, and most of them were recruited,
and the amazing thing is the junior varsity. Two
years ago we were putting ads in the paper to get
people to play, and now we've got loads of
people.
Jenkins: Do you find a lot of interest in the game
here, or apathy?
White: Growing interest. My freshman year
there were very few people out to see a game.
This year we've had a good crowd. The stands
have been filled for every game, which is some
thing we've never seen before.
Jenkins: What kind of improvements would you
make on the team rignt now?
White: Experience. Playing together, and shar
pening up all the aspects of the game. The basics
are there, it's just a matter of practicing and
playing in games.
Jenkins: As captains, do you feel capable at this
point of moving the team, getting them going?
Jackson: Whoever is captain, the team kind of
looks towards her. If they see her really going,
that gets them more motivated.
White: Sometimes it's frustrating when you
know that the team is so good, and has so much
potential, and you see them not concentrating.
That's when you get frustrated, and you say
'Stop it, let's play." But that doesn't happen very
often.
Jenkins: What's the most enjoyable aspect of
hockey for you?
Jackson: Mainly being able to get out there and
play with a team, a good team, and testing my
self athletically. And being with the people. It's a
good group of people.
White: The camaraderie really makes it worth it.
It's a game based on team effort as well as indi
vidual effort. Because it's such a fun group of
people to work with, you work hard, and we're
successful at it.
