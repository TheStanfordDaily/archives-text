# Fired workers at Coffee House concert
## Pickets ask boycott support 
### Joan O'Connell 
Concert-goers in line for the Tom
Scott performances last night were
asked by former Coffee House
employees to "enjoy the concert but
don't support TDS by buying any
thing" as the fired workers con
tinued their boycott of the Tresidder
concession by picketing both shows.
About five workers and a group ot
"moral supporters" from other cam
pus groups were on hand to ap
proach those in line for the first show
at 8:30 p.m. A representative from
the Democratic Socialist Organizing
Committee (DSOC) told volunteers
they should try to dissuade people
from buying food or drinks inside the
Coffee House but not to discourage
them attending the concert.
By 10:30 p.m., at least a dozen
former Coffee House employees and
friends had lined the entrance to the
Coffee House carrying signs and ask
ing those going in not to show iden
tification, a prerequisite for buying

drinks inside the room.
Lenny Lieberman, of ASSU Special
Fvents, said that both concerts were
sold out to the 200-person capacity
and people were being turned away
at the door.
Many of those waiting in line ex
pressed sympathy for the boycott
and said they would not purchase
food or drink inside. A quick glance
at tables near the end of the first
show seemed to confirm their state
ments, as only a few glasses and very
little food was in sight. Operators of
the food concession would give no
estimate of the amount of food or
drinks whi( h had been sold.
Ann Lowery, one ot the tired
workers, said that the people she had
talked to in line were very responsive
to the pleas ot the boycotters.
"A lot of people aren't showing
their ID's. which is great," she said.
Tom Scott's road manager Lawr
ence levy said that he learned Tom

Scott was informed "about tour days
ago" that there was a labor problem
surrounding the Coffee House con
cert.
"I don't mean to seem cold but we
think it's completely irrelevant in
formation. This seems to be an inter
nal problem at Stanford," said l evy.


Urging those in line to "enjoy Tom Scott but don't support
TDS" by buying food, about 20 former Coffee House
employees and supporters from other campus organiza
tions picketing last night's Tom Scott concert held at the

Coffee House. Most of those in line for the sold-out act
said they would support the boycott, hut one man said his
support would depend on "how thirsty I get."
