# USC, Long Beach State at deGuerre
## Poloists host two crucial matches 
### Brad Brockbank 
One thing is definite about
today's 3 p.m. water polo game
between Stanford and USC at
deGuerre pool: the loser will
no longer find themselves
among the trio of teams tied for
first place in the Pacific-10 Con
ference.
Along with California, the
Cards and the Trojans share the
distinction of having lost only
one conference game this fall.
For USC, this weekend's trip
north represents a do-or-die
situation. With a game against
Cal tomorrow in Berkeley to
think about, this weekend will
probably spell either success
or disaster in their quest for a
berth in the NCAA champion
ships in November. In short,
they're desperate.
"They're a very intense, ag
gressive team," said Cardinal
senior Randy Kalbus. "They're
going to be really up — they've
got to win this weekend (in

order to have a chance at the
nationals)."
A loss would drop the Tro
jans out of first, with two
games against Cal and one
against UCLA still to play this
fall
The Cards have two Pac-10
games left after today, both
with Cal. But as sophomore
Chris Kelsey puts it, if Stanford
wins tuday, "it could take the
pressure off."
According to Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamanti, USC has the
best team they've had in years,
When the two teams met two
weeks ago, the Cards emerged
as two-goal victors. But it took
what Dettamanti called "the
best water polo we've played
this year" to do it.
"We're going to have to play
good, consistent water polo"
to beat USC, Kelsey said, "We
can't make mistakes." Kelsey
said the team's too-frequent
turnovers last week must be

avoided against the Trojans.
"The key will be stopping
their outside shots and not get
ting kicked out," he said.
"Hopefully, the counterattack
will be a key factor. They usu
ally commit themselves pretty
much toward offense." If Stan
ford can hold off the Trojans'
offensive attack, Kelsey said he
thought the counterattack
would be successful.
Kalbus agreed the Trojans
could be caught over
committing themselves.
"Whatever is going well for
them at the ti me (offense or de
fense), the other will suffer."
He added that he expects a lot
of "intense driving and intense
offense" from the Trojans.
"(We'll need) a lot of helping
on defense," he said.
"The man you have to stop if
you want to beat USC," De
ttamanti said, is Zack Stimson,
"an excellent shootei arid
driver." The Cards held Stim

son in check until the last few
minutes of the game when the
two teams clashed two weeks
ago. But they'll have to repeat
that effort today in order to
control the Trojans.
The Cardinals will be con
centrating on controlling the
ball on offense today, some
thing they have had occasional
difficulty doing in recent
weeks.
"We just have to be more pa
tient," Kalbus said, "and not
take riskv shots."
Tomorrow at 10 a.m., Long
Beach State will challenge the
Cards. Stanford dominated the
49ers last week in Long Beach,
but Dettamanti said he expects a
closer match tomorrow,
"they're capable of playing
much better than they did," he
said. "In the past, they've
played us tougher up here than
down there."

deGuerre Pool today at 3 p.m. Stanford, USC and California are all tied at the top of the Pacific-10
Conference heap with one loss apiece, so the loser of today's match will see their hopes for a bid to the
NCAA tournament severely stunted.
