# Polhemus prognosticates Pac-10 pigskin prowess
## 
### 
Shamed by the prowess of
Don Klein, the voice of Stan
ford football and last week's
nearly flawless (6-1) Guest
Greek of the Week, the fear
less Daily prognosticators have
taken a class in Remedial Pre
dicting.
While we needed to bone up
on our homework, the same
cannot be said for this week's
Guest Greek. In what is surely
his finest academic hour, En
glish professor Rob Polhemus
has consented to divulge his
pearls of pigskin wisdom as
this week's Guest Greek of the
Week.
In great physical shape for a

75-year-old, Polhemus, 42, is
an avid sports enthusiast and
one of the great armchair quar
terbacks of the Bay Area.
Polhemus is teaching a course
in comic fiction this quarter.
With the picks that follow here,
one can see that this man
knows a lot about comedv.
Utah St. at Arizona St. —
Who's the coach of Arizona
State? It depends on theirmen
tal state. Arizona should win —
I don't know much about Utah
State.
USC at Cal — It's gonna rain,
it's gonna be muddy. 'SC isn't
going to lose any more games
and they need to win.

Oregon at Washington St. — A
tough one. Oregon is better
than Washington State but
Washington State has a chance
with the home field.
Washington at UCLA —
Washington's got to win, but
UCLA had a good win last (
week. The Bruins have good
material and they've had one of ,
their toughest schedules.
Stanford at Oregon St. — Voy,
know what the weather's been
like up there? Stanford always
plays at the level of its opposi-.
tion. The Cardinals won't beat
the spread, especially if it's a
wet field.
I'm honored to pick 'em. (
