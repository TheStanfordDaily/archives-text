# UA holds Cards to 0-0 tie
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
Anyone who missed the final
whistleof the Stanford-Arizona
State 0-0 field hockey tie would
have promised that the Cardi
nals had it "in the bag."
Stanford completely domi
nated the game Thursday af
ternoon, taking 30 shots to
Arizona's none and winning 24
corners over Arizona's one.
Further indication of this
statistical rout was the
penetration-time contrast:
Stanford had 19 minutes, while
Arizona had only 45 seconds.
"It was very frustrating," said
freshman Becky Howell.
"Their goalie had to be great,
because we were really putting
some shots on her."
"The girls played beautiful
hockey; it's very difficult to
generate such consistent of
fense as they did. We just
didn't get lucky on the finish."
explained Stanford coach Bar
bara Longstreth.
Particularly excellent plays
were made by links Nancy
White and Lynn Keyser. Long
carries, powerful drives and
quickly generated defense
offense switches kept Arizona
chasing after the ball.
Defensively, the scotchers
held ground as well, allowing
Arizona players only momen
tary penetration of Card territ
ory.
Co-captain Nancy lackson

was particularly effective at
right half, where Arizona gen
erated most of its offensive at
tempts.
Why no score, despite
superior play? Kelly Wester
wick explained, "It was soooo
frustrating! We dominated the
whole game. Only thing is, we
didn't really change fields Jeti

to right) enough. We got a little
clogged on the right."
The scotchers will have an
opportunity for vindication
Sunday at 1 p.m. when they
meet Simon Fraser. Here for a
tournament, Simon Fraser is a
Canadian team, the only one
that offers Canadian women
scholarship,.
