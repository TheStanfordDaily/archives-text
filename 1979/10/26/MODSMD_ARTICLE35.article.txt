This weekend marks the beginning of championship com
petition for the Stanford cross country teams. In what will be
their most important races to date, the women's squad hosts
the NorCal Championships today at 4 p.m. at the golf course,
while the men's team travels to UCLA to compete in the
Pacific-10 Conference Southern Division Saturday.
Laurel Treon, coach of the women's team, predicted that
her team will do well, noting that "We've prepared ourselves
to compete well." Men's coach Dean Clark, also confident of
his runners, said that "We have enough talent and ability to
make a good showing."
Kim Schnurpfeil, Ann Thrupp and Ann Wotherspoon lead
the field of 17 Cardinal runners for the women. The entire
team has been constantly improving during the season and is
expected to farewell. The University of California, the Univer
sity of Santa Clara and the University of San Francisco will be
vying against Stanford in the meet.
The men's team, despite being hit with illness recently, is
anticipating running full strength in Westwood. All-America
senior Roy Kissin leads the Cardinal contingency of seniors
Craig Corey and Tom Lobsinger, junior John Schaer, sopho
more Rod Berry, and freshmen Bill Graham and Mike Melen
dez. Clark predicts that the Card's toughest opponents will be
defending meet champ Arizona and host team U.C.L.A.
The meets this weekend will give both squads a chance to
tune up for championship meets to be held in November.
Coach Clark feels his team is ready for the meet, which he
describes as "the most competitive since the inception of the
conference." For the women, Coach Treon expressed confi
dence in her team's chances and explains, "We've been mak
ing progress individually, and we've become more aggres
sive." In both cases the competition promises to be tough and
exciting.
