Welcome to the Harbor
House restaurant, where
the view is magnificent, the
food good, and the atmos
phere a little too casual.
From one of the many
window-tables there is a
stunning view around and
across the Bay of strings of
lights, the shadows of sail
boats in the foreground,
and the stars above.
The interior decor is re
miniscent more of a
cafeteria than of a restaur
ant.
The menu is fairly exten
sive, offering appetizers,
soups, dinner salads, sea
food dinners, steaks, side
orders, sandwiches and
chili specials.
As for the appetizers, the
tried clams ($2.35) are ten
der and crisp, not greasy.
The crab cocktail ($3.25) is
slightly salty, but with the
cocktail sauce, tasty. Also
available are polish sausage
($1.60) and shrimp
cocktail(s2.7s).
All the seafood dinners
are served with trench fries,
vegetables, garlic bread and

a choice of soup or salad. I
chose the salad and was not
disappointed.
It is also possible to order
dinner salads which are
served with garlic bread:
chef's salad ($3.75), shrimp
louie ($4.50), crab louie
($5.25) and mixed fruit and
cottage cheese ($1.75 and
$3.001.
The deep-sea scallops
($6.50) were medium-sized

and fairly tender though no
thing spectacular. Other
seafood dinners include
fried prawns ($6.50), filet of
sole meuniere ($5.95) and a
combination seafood plat
ter ($6.95).
The New York steak
($9.50) was charcoal-broiled
and very juicy. Thoroughly
enjoyable. It is served with a
baked potato and vegeta
bles.

Along with the dinners,
we sampled side orders of
sauteed mushrooms
($1.50), which are delicious,
and Italian fried zucchini
($1.50), which is slices of
zucchini dipped in an egg
batter and then fried, and
which tastes like a fried egg.
The tables are a bit close
together and decorated
with pamphlets about
beefaloes — a cross bet
ween cattle and buffalo —
wedged between an empty
wine bottle and a candle
holder. Beefalo is the
novelty of the restaurant,
much like buffalo stew is to
Tommy's Joint in San Fran
cisco.
The Beefalo entrees in
clude a Beefalo burger
($2) and a Beefalo West
ern ($4.75), one-half pound
ground steak on a
cracked-wheat roll with
salad and baked beans.
For dessert there is
cheesecake ($1 .CM)) and ice
cream ($.75).
Ihe prices are moderate
and the seafood selection is
very limited, but the steaks
are excellent. A nice place
to escape for an informal
dinner.

Pole's Harbor House is located on the Redwood City marina. As the signs outside the establish
ment say, the diner enters an entirely different world — the world of Pete's.
