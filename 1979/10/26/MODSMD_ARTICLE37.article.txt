Driving past a lake nestled in
a cozy little haven in Maine,
one might come across a large
pastoral home. Closer exami
nation would reveal a New Eng
land restaurant with all the
charms that this implies. But
traveling 20 miles south of San
Francisco, one could not ex
pect to see such a sight. Un
less, of course, you came ac
ross the Shore Bird at
Princeton-by-the-Sea.
lust off Highway 1, Shore
Bird is tucked away on a back
road leading around Pillar
Point Harbor. Approaching the
broad oak door from a
scenically landscaped walk
way, one feels as if invited to
dinner at the home of a friend.
The wood-planked floor and
coastal ornamentations add to
the Eastern Seaboard atmos
phere.
This initial impression of
solid quality is not lost with the
menu. The Shore Bird offers a
varied seafood assortment that
ranges from fresh fish daily to
stuffed mountain trout al
madine.
Before one has the oppor
tunity to enjoy the entrees, var
ious appetizers appear to pre
pare the way. A loaf of warm
sourdough bread warms the
palate, to be followed by a
fresh salad enriched by
homemade dressings. A fresh
raw vegetable plate replete
with especially delicious dill
dip concludes the pre-entree
delights.
As the main course arrives at
just the appropriate moment,
the discriminating diner finds
that his meal has been further
enhanced by appealing and,
surprise, edible garnishes. The
fresh fish is just that, fresh, and
is prepared to accent this. A
wide selection of snapper,
halibut, Ling cod, petrale,

swordfish, and the always
pleasant shark, is attractive to
any fish lover. They are priced
daily and fall within the $7 to
$10 range.
In the more expensive brac
ket lie the true dishes of a sea
tood restaurant. The lobster
and sirloin is succulently pre-

pared to satisfy the appreciator
of good food. Among
others are scallop and shrimp
dishes, along with teriyaki,
chicken and fillet of sole. Each
dish is accompanied by the
fresh vegetable of the day. A
bottle of moderately priced
wine adds a taste of elegance to
a satisfying meal.
The finishing touch is a
selection from the dessert list.
A superb homemade choco
late mousse is equaled only by

a delicious concoction of
strawberries, custard and
liqueur.
The New England appear
ance of the Shore Bird is one of
its greatest assets. One would
believe that it is a converted
home. Built eight years ago,
the Shore Bird is owned by two

men closely affiliated with
Stanford University.
Chuck Vanling is a Stanford
alumnus who played golf while
on the Farm. The other, Grant
Spath, is the son of the former
dean ot the law school. Both
have upheld the Stanford trad
ition of success. They have de
veloped a fine eating estab
lishment that is a readily
accessible dining pleasure.
The attempt to cultivate a
pastoral and comfortable at

mosphere is realistically main
tained. The finished-wood in
terior is ornamented with cop
per pottery and plank paint
ings. While waiting for dinner,
one can relax in the lounge
near the brick fireplace and an
tique bar, which form a pleas
ant prelude. Seated at a table
enjoying dinner, the diner can
look out at the harbor. The
white picket fence and cypress
trees complete the picture.
The dress ranges from
families in casual clothes to
couples attired for a night on
the town in San Francisco.
Dimmed lights and the low
murmur ot voices makes the
Shore Bird ideal for almost any
occasion. The excellent food,
lair prices and relaxing atmos
phere is just right to entertain
triends, enjoy good company,
or impress someone special.
Open daily for lunch and
dinner, the Shore Bird offers
solidly Californian cuisine that
satisfies a wide range of tastes
while maintaining excellent
quality and appeal.
It is an entirely enjoyable ex
perience that is elegantly top
ped off with a long-stem rose
for all female guests, compli
ments of the Shore Bird.
