THE FISH MARKET
3150 El Camino Real
493-9188
Walking into the Fish Mar
ket, the first thing noticed is
the polished hardwood in
terior and impressive sand
blasted glass panelling on the
doors and partitions The at
mosphere is casual though, be
cause in addition to being a re
staurant, it is also a tresh fish
market. So, as you stand there
in your very informal garb next
to the couple in tailored out
fits, you realize that whatever
dress is comfortable for you is
acceptable. The surroundings
are a combination of simple,
tastefully executed elegance
and the easy-going at
mosphere of a quaint little fish
market.
Walls are adorned with old
black and white photos of
fishermen and nautical scenes,
part of a collection from the
California Maritime Museum.
The interior is well lit and im
maculate, and the potted
plants and slow-moving fans
hanging from the ceiling create
an open, relaxed setting.
Immediately inside the entr
ance is a buffet style array of
fresh sea foods and shell fish to
enjoy as appetizers for those
who are waiting to be served.
Further into the waiting area is
the market where all of the

fresh fish offered on the menu
is sold daily.
All of the fish on display is on
the shelves for one day only,
after which it is cooked and
served. There is a new ship
ment brought in daily so that
everything served and sold is
the freshest possible.
The processing of the fish,
specifically boning and smok
ing, is done in the restaurant to
save on expenses and to insure
high quality fillets and the ut
most freshness. The various
specials offered daily are im
ported fresh, and the only fish
they serve which has been fro
zen is that which they offer
regularly, but is out of season.
The menu offers a wide vari
ety of appetizers and choices
for ordering a la carte. Their
seafood salads (they offer sev
eral different kinds) seem to be
very popular. There are about
twelve regular choices on the
menu which include red snap
per, scallops, halibut, lobster
and other tantalizing delecta
bles. The dinner plates are
served with a choice of
potatoes or rice, a choice of
salads, and fresh French bread,
right out of the oven. Their
wine list, which features only
California wines, is extensive
enough to have something for
everybody.
The daily specials, which are

listed on a blackboard hanging
in the middle of the dining
area, are changed every day.
These are fresh seafoods that
are seasonal and have to be
imported from places off the
East Coast, Australia and the
waters off the Mexican penin
sula. A recent special that was

extremely popular was their
fresh albacore fillet. This fish, a
member of the yellow-tail fam
ily, is reallya treat; it has a very
succulent flavor and an in
teresting consistency, not un
like its cousin the yellow-fin
tuna.
The preparation of the fish is

given as much care as the pro
cessing; the emphasis being
on bringing out the natural
flavor. They use as little sea
soning as possible, and use
only those seasonings that en
hance the natural flavor of the
fish.
The shellfish are steamed,
and the fillets and other cuts
are cooked over mesquite co
als. The mesquite is brought up
from Mexico, where it is har
vested by Indians who have
exclusive harvesting rights.
The combination of the sea
soned salt, paprika and mes
quite wood serve to bring out
the best flavor of the fish and
give it a particular richness that
is incomparable. After one bite
your mouth is watering for
more, and the portions are by
no means skimpy, so eat your
fill and enjoy.
Because the excellent ser
vice, culinary delights and
pleasant atmosphere are irv
such demand, you can expect
to have about a half an hour's
wait or longer as it gets later
into the evening. However
there are many things going on
to keep your interest while you
wait. Aside from the regular
business of the fish market, the
seafood cocktail bar is always
bustling. There are enough
memorabilia to keep a curious
eye busy for hours. In addition

to these beautiful distractions,
the diners also have the
privilege of watching the cooks
work their wizardry on the
food they are preparing, be
cause they work in an area en
closed in glass.
In spite of the extensive
measures that The Fish Market
goes to in order to put forth
such outstanding service and
unbeatable cuisine, the prices
are very reasonable. Of the

regular menu, the average
dinner plate is about $7, the
most expensive plate being the
lobster, which runs about
$10.50 per plate. The daily spe
cials vary in price according to
availability.
The Fish Market can be
found nearby at 3150 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto. They will soon
be opening another of these
delightful places in Santa
Clara. This one will be larger,

with a full bar, (something the
restaurant on El Camjno
doesn't have room for) and an
oyster bar as well. For those
who are fish lovers, The Fish
Market is a must. Those who
are "ho-hum" about seafood
will probably get hooked after
one visit. The Fish Market is
certainly something that
shouldn't be missed; it has
something to offer evervone.

soned salt, paprika and mes
quite wood serve to bring out
the best flavor of the fish and
give it a particular richness that
is incomparable. After one bite
your mouth is watering for
more, and the portions are by
no means skimpy, so eat your
fill and enjoy.
Because the excellent ser
vice, culinary delights and
pleasant atmosphere are irv
such demand, you can expect
to have about a half an hour's
wait or longer as it gets later
into the evening. However
there are many things going on
to keep your interest while you
wait. Aside from the regular
business of the fish market, the
seafood cocktail bar is always
bustling. There are enough
memorabilia to keep a curious
eye busy for hours. In addition

to these beautiful distractions,
the diners also have the
privilege of watching the cooks
work their wizardry on the
food they are preparing, be
cause they work in an area en
closed in glass.
In spite of the extensive
measures that The Fish Market
goes to in order to put forth
such outstanding service and
unbeatable cuisine, the prices
are very reasonable. Of the

regular menu, the average
dinner plate is about $7, the
most expensive plate being the
lobster, which runs about
$10.50 per plate. The daily spe
cials vary in price according to
availability.
The Fish Market can be
found nearby at 3150 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto. They will soon
be opening another of these
delightful places in Santa
Clara. This one will be larger,

with a full bar, (something the
restaurant on El Camjno
doesn't have room for) and an
oyster bar as well. For those
who are fish lovers, The Fish
Market is a must. Those who
are "ho-hum" about seafood
will probably get hooked after
one visit. The Fish Market is
certainly something that
shouldn't be missed; it has
something to offer evervone.

The Fish Market offers its patrons the succulent delight of fresh fish — either prepared on the premises
for the delighted diner or wrapped to take home for the resident chef.
THE FISH MARKET
3150 El Camino Real
493-9188
Walking into the Fish Mar
ket, the first thing noticed is
the polished hardwood in
terior and impressive sand
blasted glass panelling on the
doors and partitions The at
mosphere is casual though, be
cause in addition to being a re
staurant, it is also a tresh fish
market. So, as you stand there
in your very informal garb next
to the couple in tailored out
fits, you realize that whatever
dress is comfortable for you is
acceptable. The surroundings
are a combination of simple,
tastefully executed elegance
and the easy-going at
mosphere of a quaint little fish
market.
Walls are adorned with old
black and white photos of
fishermen and nautical scenes,
part of a collection from the
California Maritime Museum.
The interior is well lit and im
maculate, and the potted
plants and slow-moving fans
hanging from the ceiling create
an open, relaxed setting.
Immediately inside the entr
ance is a buffet style array of
fresh sea foods and shell fish to
enjoy as appetizers for those
who are waiting to be served.
Further into the waiting area is
the market where all of the

fresh fish offered on the menu
is sold daily.
All of the fish on display is on
the shelves for one day only,
after which it is cooked and
served. There is a new ship
ment brought in daily so that
everything served and sold is
the freshest possible.
The processing of the fish,
specifically boning and smok
ing, is done in the restaurant to
save on expenses and to insure
high quality fillets and the ut
most freshness. The various
specials offered daily are im
ported fresh, and the only fish
they serve which has been fro
zen is that which they offer
regularly, but is out of season.
The menu offers a wide vari
ety of appetizers and choices
for ordering a la carte. Their
seafood salads (they offer sev
eral different kinds) seem to be
very popular. There are about
twelve regular choices on the
menu which include red snap
per, scallops, halibut, lobster
and other tantalizing delecta
bles. The dinner plates are
served with a choice of
potatoes or rice, a choice of
salads, and fresh French bread,
right out of the oven. Their
wine list, which features only
California wines, is extensive
enough to have something for
everybody.
The daily specials, which are

listed on a blackboard hanging
in the middle of the dining
area, are changed every day.
These are fresh seafoods that
are seasonal and have to be
imported from places off the
East Coast, Australia and the
waters off the Mexican penin
sula. A recent special that was

extremely popular was their
fresh albacore fillet. This fish, a
member of the yellow-tail fam
ily, is reallya treat; it has a very
succulent flavor and an in
teresting consistency, not un
like its cousin the yellow-fin
tuna.
The preparation of the fish is

given as much care as the pro
cessing; the emphasis being
on bringing out the natural
flavor. They use as little sea
soning as possible, and use
only those seasonings that en
hance the natural flavor of the
fish.
The shellfish are steamed,
and the fillets and other cuts
are cooked over mesquite co
als. The mesquite is brought up
from Mexico, where it is har
vested by Indians who have
exclusive harvesting rights.
The combination of the sea
soned salt, paprika and mes
quite wood serve to bring out
the best flavor of the fish and
give it a particular richness that
is incomparable. After one bite
your mouth is watering for
more, and the portions are by
