black-and-white cinematography
combines with new directing
skills and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden
Camera Award for the best fea
ture film this year. See it for its
human characterizations and
poignant plot. A thinking per
son's movie.
—Seth Zuckerman
Luna * *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and a son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's first English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the brilliant
cinematography in Apocalypse
Now) provides him with startling
mages, but Bertolucci seems to
till be groping with the intellec
tual dimensions of his subject;
he's not quite sure how to com
municate it. In a very different
role, |ill Clayburgh is sporadically
good; it's her most mannered
performance, and such an ap
proach doesn't quite suit her. As
the son, Matthew Brady is the
best thing in the movie. Both

overpoweringly violent and sur
prisingly sensual, Brady delivers
a frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.
—Ron Lillejord
Breaking Away * * *
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretensions — Breaking
Away may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his ta
lent on a bicycle.
—Mike Kohn
Starting Oi er ★ *
Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above the level of
uninspired '40s romantic com
edy; couple gets divorced, man
looks for someone new, lots of
"comic misadventures" along
the way, man finally finds some
one, his wite tries to take him
back, man forced to choose bet
ween his ex-wife and new love.
The major "suspense" concerns
who he will pick. Not exactly your
most wonderfully novel movie
idea.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much if the movie were carried
off with the kind of winking
lightness that Burt Reynolds' per
formance here continually deliv
ers. )ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to
be bad — and she's successful.
Director Alan Pakula (K/ufe, All
The President's Men) is more at
home with drama; his comic
touch is, at best, unsure. No mat

ter what Burt Reynolds is in, it
seems, he ends up being the only
reason to see it.

Apocalypse Now * * * *
Old Mill
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
)oseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie ot this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.
—R.L.
Life of Brian * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Sort of like Codspell with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all
funny, but it goes on for much
too long. Python takes aim at bi-

blical epics, terrorist logistics,
and the PLO; while they don't
always score, even a series of
bullseyes would be boring. A
Python movie needs a better plot
than the Bible can provide.
—Mike Hale
The Lion in Winter * *
Friday, Kre->ge 7:30 & 9:45 p.m.
A very overrated movie; direc
tor Anthony Harvey is responsi
ble for much of the damage — his
combining of the realistically
bawdy and wildly theatrical
never quite comes off. Katherine
Hepburn and Peter O'Toole en
gage in loud, uproarious shout
ing matches; the lames Goldman
script calls for punchy, vocal
humor, and Hepburn and
O'Toole carry it off, but the final
effect is not an enjoyable one.
—R.L.
And justice For All *
Palo Alto Square
About fO years ago, this tilm
would have made a great TV pilot
movie, and that's probably the
best that can be for it. Lots of
the "can the honest, crusading
lawyer keep his integrity in the
ugly, dog-eat-dog world of crim
inals, dirty attorneys and dishon
est judges?" type conflict. Direc -
tor Norman lewison, who should
know better, directs the shallow
dramatics and cheap comedy in
the script with an embarrassing
earnestness. Al Pacino has never
seemed so ordinary; by sheer
force of will, he's interesting, but
the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be successful in his bid for
a weekly series?" Pacino must be
more ambitious than that.
—R.L.
Animal House * * * A
Plaza, Daly City
Animal House is a slightly
crazed, generally sophomoric
and mindless movie which serves
as one big glorification of white
male fantasies. And because of
this, this story of various forms of
frat lite in '62 works; Animal
House's approach tits its subject
matter very well
As always, |ohn Belushi gives
an inspired performance as one
of the "animals," in the "worst
frat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuff.
|ohn Landis, the director, di
rects as it there is no speed but
fast and no volume but loud, and
while that doesn't hurt him too
much here (although, because of
this tendency, Animal House has
a decidedly limited emotional
range), I wonder if landis can do
anything else but movies like
this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
-R.L.

Heaven Can Wail * * *
Old Mill
Very wry. Like a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent for
its success upon machinations of
the plot that come totally out of
the blue— if the movie is to work
it must continually outwit its au
dience.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obsti
nate persistence and a stubborn
sense that he's been cheated.
Strange as it sounds, he's good at
this, and his efforts are sup
ported by those of a well-addled
supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as
it is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. 11 doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play orf
its inferiority to the original —
this is a thoughtful
tion to a tar more intelligent kind

Sunset Boulevard * * * *
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Gloria Swanson gives an abso
lutely astounding performance
as an actress, well past her prime,
who still thinks and lives as a star.
Director Billy Wilder, who him
self has fought and compromised
himselt in the depths of Hol
lywood presents a study of the
emptiness of iame with great
skill, skill born out of hard, un
sentimental experience. A young
William Holden plays Swanson's
gigolo who is revulsed and finally
consumed by the gaudy,
strangely grand unreality sur
rounding him. In an all-too-true
role, Erich Von Stroheim plays a
formerly great film director who
now is Swanson's overlooked bu
tler. With Hedda Hopper and
Jack Warner.


Monty Python's Terry Jones directs a scene from the disappointing Life ol Brian. |one> also plays Brian's mother in the movie


Matthew Brady is the single compelling presence in an otherwise
subpar Bernardo Bertoluni movie, Luna.
