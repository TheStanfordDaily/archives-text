The year's first heavy rainfall had
the campus |umpmg yesterday.
Maintenance workers were called
nut 70 times to take care ot rain
related incidents all over campus.
"In the first rain of the year we
always get all kinds of calls," said |im
Horgan, associate dire* tor ot
facilities operations and mainte
nance. "This was not an unusually
high number tor the tirst rain."
Horgan said 14 of the 70 calls were
major incidents requiring follow-up
repair and clean-up. Floods caused
by clogged drain pipes and damaged
ceilings caused by leaky roofs
plagued buildings in all areas of the
campus, including the. School of
Education and the Medical Mic
robiology E^litiding across from the
Medical Center.
The most serious incident occur
red at the Varian Building in the
physics labs where a flood damaged
a power transformer and forced
maintenance crews to turn on a
generator to keep electricity in the
building.
There was no estimate on the cost
of damage to the Varian Building or

to any other buildings affected by
floods and leaks.
Old Pavilion, where planning and
facilities offices are located, also suf
fered a power outage for several
hours yesterday.
With few exceptions, most of the
major incidents had been responded
to just d tew hours after they had
been reported to maintenance
crews, Morgan said.
"Everybody got into the act," Mor
gan said. "Usually if there's a flood
you have the plumbing department
of our office take care of it. But
everyone was involved in all sorts of
calls."
Another factor which helped
maintenance crews work fast was the
sudden cease in the morning
downpour around II a.m.
"Because of this we were able to
get everything under control by
mid-afternoon," Horgan said.
There were no reports ot carpet
damage in the flooded rooms, Mor
gan said.
The 70 quick-response calls turned
in to the maintenance department
yesterday compares to the 10 calls on
a normal working day.
