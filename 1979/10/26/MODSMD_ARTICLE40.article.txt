Tentative Chrysler pact reached
Highland Park, Mich. — Chrysler Corp. and the
United Auto Workers union reached tentative ag
reement on a new contract yesterday that will give
the company $403 million in concessions over the
next two years to help keep the struggling No. 3
automaker afloat.
In a precedent-shattering side agreement,
Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca will recommend
nomination of UAW President Douglas Fraser to
the board of directors at the annual meeting next
May.
The pact gives the union two long-sought social
goals: the right to recommend investment policy
for part of the pension fund, and the right to re
commend investment sanctions against some
firms it may designate for their South Africa
policies.
The $40i million consists of $203 million in de
ferred wages and benefits and a previously an
nounced $200 million in a one-year deferral of this
year's payments to the pension tund.
Dumps sought for nuclear waste
Washington — With two of the country's three
low-level nuclear waste dumps closed, the gov
ernment is planning to ask governors to provide
temporary storage sites for radioactive waste pro
duced in their own states, officials said yesterday.
A dump in Washington state was closed because
improperly packaged wastes were being delivered
to the site. Another site, in Nevada, was closed
after radioactive waste was discovered outside
dump boundaries.
The third site, in South Carolina, remained open
yesterday, but officials said none of the wastes that
would normally go to Nevada or Washington
could be sent there.
Government officials and spokesmen for the
medical community have said hospitals, research
facilities and some nuclear power plants will face
serious problems within weeks because they will
have nowhere to ship their radioactive wastes.
Low level radioactive wastes are generated in
almost every state, with the largest amounts pro
duced in California, Illinois and the Northeast
where there are concentrations of hospitals, re
search facilities and nuclear power stations.
House begins debate on fuel aid
Washington — House Speaker Thomas O'Neill,
calling fuel assistance for the year a "national
priority," predicted swift passage yesterday of an
urgent $1.35 billion aid measure.
"This to me is a national emergency," O'Neill

told reporters shortly before the House began de
bate on the hurry-up legislation to help poor
people pay their heating bills this winter. "This is a
crisis."
While passage seemed assured, a lengthy de
bate also was a possibility as House members
wrangled over details of the costly program.
The $1.35 billion, when combined with $250 mill
ion approved earlier by the House, would provide
a total of $1.6 billion for low-income households
whose heating bills have gone up sharply since last
winter.
S. African nuke blast suspected
Washington — U.S. intelligence has evidence
indicating that South Africa may have exploded a
nuclear device in the atmosphere on Sept. 22,
government officials said last night.
Intelligence officials said the indicators, picked
up by a U.S. reconnaissance satellite, were not
conclusive enough to make a firm judgment and it
was possible the satellite detected a natural
phenomenon.
U.S. officials are checking other sources of in
formation, including various detection devices,
and have contacted U.S. allies in Western Europe
to determine what their intelligence may have
learned.
Last year, the intelligence sources said the Un
ited States and the Soviet Union both indepen
dently detected through satellite photography
signs that the South Africans may have built a nuc
lear test structure in the Kalihari Desert. The Rus
sians contacted the United States at that time.
A spokesman for the South African government
was quoted as saying that the report was "mere
speculation. South Africa has insisted for some
time that it has no interest in building a nuclear
device."
Spain to try women for abortion
Bilbao, Spain — Feminists readied demonstra
tions across Spain as the state prepared to put 11
women on trial today on abortion-related charges
in a case that has brought the nation's criminal
code and Roman Catholic family lite under attack.
A feminist spokeswoman said at least 20 women
would chain themselves outside the lustice Palace
entrance.
Hundreds of other women were coming by bus
to Bilbao to protest in the street, she said, risking a
repeat of violence last week in Madrid when police
waded into demonstrators with clubs.
The closed-door trial involves nine working
class women who had abortions, one of them II
years ago, and the abortionist and her teenage

daughter. The prosecution is expected to ask
prison terms ranging from 6 montns to 60 years.
Defense lawyers have kept their clients' identities
secret.
The lawyers have said they will try to use the trial
as a lever to change the law that makes abortion a
crime in Roman Catholic Spain.
The case attracted fresh attention last week
when IJOO Spanish professional women, includ
ing some of the nation's leading actresses, lawyers
and singers, signed a public document saying they
had had abortions.
FDA to regulate beer brewing
Washington — The Food and Drug Administra
tion said yesterday it will take regulatory action
against any domestic beer made after Jan. 1, 1980
that contains more than 5 parts per billion of the
cancer-causing agent nitrosamines.
At the same time, the agency said the U.S. Brew
ers Association reports that more than half of
American brewers have altered their brewing pro
cess to reduce formation of nitrosamines, and that
more than 80 percent will have done so by next
month.
The FDA also released test results on a check of
Scotch whiskeys for nitrosamines. It found only
trace levels in 29 brands tested, in amounts rang
ing from none to 2.3 parts per billion.
The FDA does not consider findings below 5
parts per billion to be scientifically reliable.
Last month, the FDA released the results of tests
ot 30 brands of beer in which 28 had some level of
nitrosamines. Most were below 5 parts per billion.
