# Change clocks
## 
### 
Don't forget to set your clock
back one hour Sunday morn
ing to return to standard time.
California joins most of the
nation in "turning back the
hands of time" at 2 a.m. Sun
day, and in case you have trou
ble remembering whether to
go forward or back, try to think
of the famous jingle "spring
forward, fall back."
The Daily advises you to set
your clock's alarm for 2 a.m.
Sunday morning so you can get
up and turn your clock back.
