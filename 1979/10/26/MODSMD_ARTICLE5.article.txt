# Southern Pacific commuter stays alive
## 
### Mike Vaska 
At the turn of the century, Leland Stanford used
the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) to travel from his
San Francisco home to the Farm. Under a recent
agreement between SP and Caltrans, the Califor
nia State Transportation agency, that same com
mute service will continue to be available to area
residents.
SP had planned to end commute service on |an.
1, 1980, according to Gerald Perra, manager of
commute traffic for the company, However, a July
6 decision by Administrative Law judge Robert
Wallace of the Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC) supporting SP removed the one remaining
legal obstacle to ending the service, sai,d Perra.
The current accord is only an "agreement of
principles," said |im Graebner, Santa Clara
County Transit chief. Negotiations between Cal
trans and SP will solidify the agreement, and it will
then be presented to county transit authorities for
their approval, he said.
Losses to be substantial
Graebner estimated that the service will run at a
loss of some $10 million for the year 1980, the first
year in which the agreement will be in effect. Still
to be determined is what share of this loss Cal
trans, the federal government and local transit dis
tricts each will pay.
Under the initial agreement, SP will continue to

operate and servi< e the trains, while Caltrans will
either purchase or rent the equipment, said Perra.
He said the system could maintain its 9.5 percent
on-time record.
Craebner said that many eastern cities were
using this method of service very effectively and
that he foresaw no ma|or problems in operating an
efficient system.
Ridership dropping
Ridership on the' SP commute run had been
"declining for 10 years" before the gas crisis ear
lier this year, said Perra. During the middle of the
crunch, however, "people were practically hang
ing out the windows," he said.
Overall ridership was up about 27 percent this
year, peaking at 10,000 riders per day or 20,000
rides, according to Perra. Even so, he estimated
that triple the number of riders would be needed
for the system to break even.
It is hoped that increased st'rvice heading south
during morning rush hour and north during even
ing rush hour will allow "reverse commute" driv
ers to use the SP system, said Graehner.
Citizens fight back
When the decision to end the commute service
was announced last summer, local citizens formed
an organization known as Save the Peninsula Area
Rail Commuter (SPARC). Members ot SPARC'S
hearing board included representatives from the

three counties involved.
SPARC sponsored four hearings in the area af
fected by the service, said Norma Mencicci, coor
dinator tor SPARC. Meetings were well attended
with "standing room only at three ot the meet
ings," she said.
The public's support was "narrowly crucial" in
achieving the agreement, according to Craebner.
The willingness of the transit districts to work to
ward maintaining the system was the deciding fac
tor, he said.
Marguerite unchanged
The Marguerite shuttle service, which began
runs this summer between campus and the SP
depot, should be unaffected by the agreement
unless substantial changes are made in the SP
schedule, said University administrator Alan
Cummings. About 145 persons use the Marguerite
each day, which is a considerable increase in rid
ership since the service began, according to
Cummings.
Perra claimed that the SP run may be the last
commute service in the nation which is privately
owned. Amtrak, Conrail and other municipal en
tities have replaced most private passenger ser
vice.
The SP commute service will inevitably be sub
sidized or will cease to exist, Perra predicted.
