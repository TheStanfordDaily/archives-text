# Marguerite shuttles to shopping center resume
## 
### Nancy Springen 
A petition, 12 letters of complaint
and about 20 phone calls prompted
University officials to reinstate Mar
guerite shuttle bus service to the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Service to the center will resume
Nov. 1 and will operate from 11:30
a.m. to 1:30 p.m. weekdays as an ex
tension of the regular run to the
Medical Center, according to Bob
Hamrdla, chairman of the Commit
tee on Parking and Transportation.
The committee "unanimously ap
proved the decision to reinstate the
run, said Alan Cummings, the Uni
versity administrator in charge of the
Marguerite shuttle.
The service was canceled Sept. 1
because of "rising costs coupled
with inadequate ridership," he said.
The costs simply outweighed the
benefits," he added, even in light of
the recent gas shortage.
Ridership
Commuters urged that it begin
again, however. And ridership in
creased substantially in |une and Au
gust because of the gas crisis, Cum
mings said.
Kiders have also given an en
thusiastic response to the two
month-old Marguerite service to the
Palo Alto Southern Pacific train de
pot. An average of 145 people rode it
every day during the first two weeks
of autumn quarter, said John Breed
love, coordinator of an ad hoc trans
portation committee of the Office of
Business and Finance.

That route, which operates during
morning and afternoon commute
hours only, will continue at least
until Dec. 31, according to Jeff
Littleboy ot the News and Publica
tions Service.
Frequency up
Two new buses will go into opera
tion Nov. 1, reducing the time bet
ween buses to eight minutes from
th« current 10. When the run is ex
tended to the shopping center, how
evei, the shuttles will only come
every 10 minutes, according to the
News and Publications Service.
The old shuttle was "like the San
Francisco cable car system" with
people hanging on, Cummings said.
"The Marguerite depends on rid
ership," said Hamrdla. The service is
tree and is designed to be "helptul to
a lot of people."
The Marguerite shuttle was inau
gurated in 1976 to alleviate the on
campus parking shortage and loosen
trattic snarls. It was also hoped that it
would increase shopping center
trade volume, but "it simply has not
met expectations," according to
Cummings. This year, shopping
center tenants were unwilling to
share in the increasing c ost ot operat
ing the service.
Ihe shuttle to the SP depot serves
the Hoover Pavilion, the Medical
Center and the Quad at the top of the
Oval. The bus makes 20-minute
round trips between 6:30 and 9:30
a.m. and J:3O to 6:10 p.m.
