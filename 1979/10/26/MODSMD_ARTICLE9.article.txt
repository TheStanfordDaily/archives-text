# Swami promotes self awareness

"Know yourself and accept
yourself," Swami Dayananda
Saraswati, a world-renowned
Indian teacher of Vedantic
philosophy told students here
Monday.
The swami gives the final lec
ture of his week-long series on
campus tonight.
In his introductory lecture to
a crowd of 200 in Skilling Au
ditorium, the swami called the
self both the problem and the
solution.
"Man wants to prove himself
because he is self-conscious."
he said.
Swami, the title given to
Hindu monks, is a Sanskrit
word that means "master of
oneself."
Wearing orange robes and
seated in a yoga position, the
swami explained that the reali
zation of his own inadequacy
makes man want to change his
situation.
Orange flame
Orange, the color of a flame,
symbolizes light and know
ledge in India, according to the
swami. A swami wears orange
as a sign of his communication
of light and knowledge to the
world.
The yellow dot painted on
the Swami's forehead indicates
his offering of his knowledge
to the Lord, the swami said
after his lecture.
The swami warned that
changing one's "situation" can
be difficult and often does not
solve inadequacies of charac
ter.
"Any situational change in
volves loss on your part and no

situational change is going to
solve your problems," he said.
Striving for change
But people continue to strive
for change, he added.
"What you want changes,
but that you want does not
change; it is a constant," he
said.
Vedantic philosophy teaches
people how to become normal
people, according to the
swami. He defined a normal
person as "one who accepts
himself."
Swami Dayananda directs a
Sanskrit and Vedantic Institute
in Bombay, India. He has re
nounced possessions and fam
ily. Invited around the world to
teach Vedantic philosophy, he
lives by the generosity of his
hosts who provide him with
food and clothing. Before com
ing to California he taught for
two weeks in Sydney, Au
stralia.
Study self
Vedantic philosophy is the
study of self, God and world
and the mutual relationships
between them, according to
the swami. He says that Ved
anta "is not a philosophy be
cause it is not speculative, but
it is not a religion because it is
the ultimate end of all relig
ions."
In the past Vedantic study
was reserved for priests in
India but is now taught to
others. The Vedic-Sanskrit cul
ture of India, historically based
on oral collections of know
ledge called the Vidas, is gen
erally considered to be the
basis of Hinduism and Buddh
ism.
