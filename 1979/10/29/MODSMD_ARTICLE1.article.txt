# Educators differ on new DOE
## 
### Mike Vaskd 
The new Department of Education,
recently signed into law by President
)irnmy Carter, has received mixed re
views from educators nationwide.
Stanford President Richard Lyman
has called the new bureaucratic en
tity "a significant step toward creat
ing a central federal ministry of edu
cation."
Purdue President Arthur Hansen
shares some of Lyman's concerns.
"I tended to be leery about the
new department because of the
threat it could place on the au
tonomy of higher education. But lam
now willing to trust in the hopes set
forth and to make use of the oppor
tunities which the new department
should offer," he said.
The president of the National Edu
cation Association. William
McCuire, however, called passage ot
the Education Department legisla
tion, "one of education's finest
hours. Better managed federal
education programs will also gain
from a fiscally responsible federal
presence in education," he said.
13th cabinet branch
Alfred Sumberg, director of gov
ernment relations for the American
Association ot University Professors,
said, "Hopefully, now that education
will be removed from EIEW (The De
partment of Health, Education and
Welfare), it will reduce theamount ot
time it takes to make money available
to higher-education institutions and
the time it takes to get regulations
approved/'
The new department, which will
become the 13th cabinet level post,
will have a budget of over $14 billion
and employ between 17,000 and
18,000 persons. HFW will be re
named the Department of Health
and Human Services.
More government intrusion
While that department will have no
immediate, short-run effect on the
University, "sooner or later it will
begin trying to develop policies for
all of education, emanating from
Washington," Lyman said.
He noted at a recent press confer
ence that revised cost principles,
stemming from Office of Manage
ment and Budget (OMB) circular
A-21, will require Stanford faculty
who do not directly benefit from gov
ernment research contracts to pro
vide an accounting for their work
time.
In particular, faculty will be asked to
account for UK) percent ot their time
on a quarterly basis by specified
category, such as a percent of time
devoted to teaching and departmen
tal research, sponsored research
contracts, departmental administra
tion, etc.," according to a report to
Lyman from Gerald Lieberman,
vice-provost and dean of research..
Large research funds
During fiscal year 1977, Stanford
ranked second nationally in total
funds for research and development,
receiving $73.4 million, according to
the National Science Foundation.
Only the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, which collected $91.8
million, was granted more funding.
"We are attempting to walk a tight
rope," the report added.
"We are pulled on the one hand by
the desire to protect the freedom of

the laculty and maintain an atmo
phere conducive to research. On tf
other hand, we are pulled by
government's insistance on more 112
culty accountability and prescribt
accounting procedures for the Ur
versity if the federal government
going to permit us to recover dire
and indirect costs associated wit
government-sponsored programs.
"The genius of education (in th
United States)," Lyman said, "if thei
is such a genius, is local roots, loc.
control and local regional respons
bility."
"While the new department isn
going to turn into a federal bureauc
racy telling everybody how to teacl
school overnight, bureaucracies d
tend to try to accumulate power am
grow," he said.
