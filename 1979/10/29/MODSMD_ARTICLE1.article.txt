The new Department of Education,
recently signed into law by President
)irnmy Carter, has received mixed re
views from educators nationwide.
Stanford President Richard Lyman
has called the new bureaucratic en
tity "a significant step toward creat
ing a central federal ministry of edu
cation."
Purdue President Arthur Hansen
shares some of Lyman's concerns.
"I tended to be leery about the
new department because of the
threat it could place on the au
tonomy of higher education. But lam
now willing to trust in the hopes set
forth and to make use of the oppor
tunities which the new department
should offer," he said.
The president of the National Edu
cation Association. William
McCuire, however, called passage ot
the Education Department legisla
tion, "one of education's finest
hours. Better managed federal
education programs will also gain
from a fiscally responsible federal
presence in education," he said.
13th cabinet branch
Alfred Sumberg, director of gov
ernment relations for the American
Association ot University Professors,
said, "Hopefully, now that education
will be removed from EIEW (The De
partment of Health, Education and
Welfare), it will reduce theamount ot
time it takes to make money available
to higher-education institutions and
the time it takes to get regulations
approved/'
The new department, which will
become the 13th cabinet level post,
will have a budget of over $14 billion
and employ between 17,000 and
18,000 persons. HFW will be re
named the Department of Health
and Human Services.
More government intrusion
While that department will have no
immediate, short-run effect on the
University, "sooner or later it will
begin trying to develop policies for
all of education, emanating from
Washington," Lyman said.
He noted at a recent press confer
ence that revised cost principles,
stemming from Office of Manage
ment and Budget (OMB) circular
A-21, will require Stanford faculty
who do not directly benefit from gov
ernment research contracts to pro
vide an accounting for their work
time.
In particular, faculty will be asked to
account for UK) percent ot their time
on a quarterly basis by specified
