# By whom the bells toll
## 
### Rose Cecile Chan 
Several times a week
around meal time, students
can hear free bell concerts
from Hoover Tower; many
wonder what goes on up
there. Is the University
perhaps experimenting
with theories of classical
conditioning using students
as subjects? Is it a real per
son up there or is it just
another tape recording?
The 35 bronze bells which
ring out are up on top of
Hoover Tower, enclosed in
a wire cage to keep pigeons
out. The keyboard of the
carrillon is found on the
13th floor, below the bells,
in an attic filled with dusty
books and papers.
For almost 20 years, Prof.
)ames Angell has energeti
cally played the key lever
and the pedals to entertain
the University.
The University's only
carilloner, Angell is also as
sociate chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Dept.
"I would have been an
organist if my parents had
been wealthy," Angell said.
But, Angell says he does
enjoy his job as associate
chairman and finds the elec
trical engineering increas
ingly interesting.
Angell says his agreement
with the president "lets me
do whatever I darn well
please, except that I
shouldn't do it too much
while classes are in ses
sion."
Angell plays a few times a

week, usually at noon and
after 5 p.m. The two students
he has this quarter usually
practice on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Angell also en
tertains on special occa
sions such as Big Games and
dedications.
Although he says chances
are slim that anything would
happen, the loudness of the
bells can cause harm to
people with shell shock and
epilepsy. Therefore, he pre
fers to play when the Tower
is closed to the public.
Starting out as a choir
member and moving up to
the position of assistant or
ganist, Angell learned to
play the carillon in the 1950s
in a church back East with a
"marvelous music prog
ram."
While he was on sabbati
cal leave in Holland last
year, he squeezed in a few
lessons with the head of the
Dutch Carillon School.
Stanford's carillon was
made in Belgium in 1938 for
the Belgian Pavilion of the
New York World's Fair in
1940. According to Angell,
the Belgian-American As
sociation saw no point in br
inging the bells back to Bel
gium if they would end up in
Nazi showcases.
Instead, they were pre
sented to the University in
gratitude for Herbert
Hoover's efforts to recon
struct Europe after World
War I. According to Angell,
the University's first caril
loner, )im Lawson, used to

live in a garage in back of
Kingscote Gardens.
The bells are now valued
at $7 per pound, Angell said,
which means that one of the
bigger 1350 lb. bells is worth
about $10,000. Angell
judges the bells as not par
ticularly well-tuned, but "al
right." Each bell should
produce five different to
nes.
"One bell never sounds
the same twice — that's a
part of its individuality. The
pedals always strike a little
differently. How it rings de
pends on how it was vibrat
ing before you hit it again,"
Angell said.
One of Angell's favorite
tunes is "Preludio No. 5" by
Mathias Van den Chuen,
which "exploits the tones of
the carillon beautifully."
"The satisfaction of these
sounds is such that the
majority of people who hear
them never tire of the
sound. With electronic
bells, you sort of get tired,
think you've heard it all and
wish they'd shut up," said
Angell of the advantage of a
mechanical keyboard.
According to Angell, the
carillon allows for much
personal expression, which
he can illustrate with a
"schmaltzy" rendition of
"Sunrise, Sunset." In the
words of one Manzanita
Park resident, Angell's
melodies give the campus a
very "collegiate" atmos
phere. Besides, where can
you find betterdinner bells?

he has this quarter usually
practice on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Angell also en
tertains on special occa
sions such as Big Games and
dedications.
Although he says chances
are slim that anything would
happen, the loudness of the
bells can cause harm to
people with shell shock and
epilepsy. Therefore, he pre
fers to play when the Tower
is closed to the public.
Starting out as a choir
member and moving up to
the position of assistant or
ganist, Angell learned to
play the carillon in the 1950s
in a church back East with a
"marvelous music prog
ram."
While he was on sabbati
cal leave in Holland last
year, he squeezed in a few
lessons with the head of the
Dutch Carillon School.
Stanford's carillon was
made in Belgium in 1938 for
the Belgian Pavilion of the
New York World's Fair in
1940. According to Angell,
the Belgian-American As
sociation saw no point in br
inging the bells back to Bel
gium if they would end up in
Nazi showcases.
Instead, they were pre
sented to the University in
gratitude for Herbert
Hoover's efforts to recon
struct Europe after World
War I. According to Angell,
the University's first caril
loner, )im Lawson, used to

live in a garage in back of
Kingscote Gardens.
The bells are now valued
at $7 per pound, Angell said,
which means that one of the
bigger 1350 lb. bells is worth
about $10,000. Angell
judges the bells as not par
ticularly well-tuned, but "al
right." Each bell should
produce five different to
nes.
"One bell never sounds
the same twice — that's a
part of its individuality. The
pedals always strike a little
differently. How it rings de
pends on how it was vibrat
ing before you hit it again,"
Angell said.
One of Angell's favorite
tunes is "Preludio No. 5" by
Mathias Van den Chuen,
which "exploits the tones of
the carillon beautifully."
"The satisfaction of these
sounds is such that the
majority of people who hear
them never tire of the
sound. With electronic
bells, you sort of get tired,
think you've heard it all and
wish they'd shut up," said
Angell of the advantage of a
mechanical keyboard.
According to Angell, the
carillon allows for much
personal expression, which
he can illustrate with a
"schmaltzy" rendition of
"Sunrise, Sunset." In the
words of one Manzanita
Park resident, Angell's
melodies give the campus a
very "collegiate" atmos
phere. Besides, where can
you find betterdinner bells?
Several times a week
around meal time, students
can hear free bell concerts
from Hoover Tower; many
wonder what goes on up
there. Is the University
perhaps experimenting
with theories of classical
conditioning using students
as subjects? Is it a real per
son up there or is it just
another tape recording?
The 35 bronze bells which
ring out are up on top of
Hoover Tower, enclosed in
a wire cage to keep pigeons
out. The keyboard of the
carrillon is found on the
13th floor, below the bells,
in an attic filled with dusty
books and papers.
For almost 20 years, Prof.
)ames Angell has energeti
cally played the key lever
and the pedals to entertain
the University.
The University's only
carilloner, Angell is also as
sociate chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Dept.
"I would have been an
organist if my parents had
been wealthy," Angell said.
But, Angell says he does
enjoy his job as associate
chairman and finds the elec
trical engineering increas
ingly interesting.
Angell says his agreement
with the president "lets me
do whatever I darn well
please, except that I
shouldn't do it too much
while classes are in ses
sion."
Angell plays a few times a

week, usually at noon and
after 5 p.m. The two students
he has this quarter usually
practice on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Angell also en
tertains on special occa
sions such as Big Games and
dedications.
