# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## John Willis Nukes must go, not us

Dr. Edward Teller, a promi
nent physicist renowned as the
"Father of the H-Bomb,"
strongly advocated the con
tinued use of nuclear power in
a Daily interview published
()ct. 25. The following is an at
tempt to refute both his argu
ments and those of other lead
ing nuclear supporters.
Perhaps the first crucial
point which should be raised
concerns the nature of the nuc
lear argument: it is a problem
which cannot be left to physi
cists and natural scientists.
Rather, it involves the interac
tion of people with the tools of
science, and must therefore be
discussed on a sociological
level. Human beings, unlike
machines and nuclcar breed
ers, are an arid blend of emo
tion and instinct, and they can
not be predicted as accurately
as natural scientists tend to
presume.
Indeed, the Three Mile Is
land incident is indicative of
this unpredictability. As Teller
commented, "it is remarkable
that in Three Mile Island . . .
the operators mishandled the
reactor in every possible way
. . . Yet, nobody got hurt."
Teller's implication is that
the plant's satety devices had
been (onstructed in such a way
tli.it no amount of human error
could possibly cause' a
meltdown, or anv lesser catas
trophe.
Such logic is exemplary oT
circular reasoning: it ignores
the obvious tact that it humans
involved in plant maintenance
are capable of suc;h gross er
rors, then those involved in the
building and installation of the
"Ilawless safety devices" must
be equally prone to blunder.
Many argue that the risk of a
nuclear accident is miniscule
to the point of irrelevance (one
may recall similar arguments
voiced by many physicists dur
ing the l l M()s regarding nuclear
fallout, which was held to be

impossible). Whatever the
danger might be, however, it
does not involve the possibility
that a few technicians may die,
or even several hundred.
According to Dr. Linus Paul
ing, who was awarded Nobel
prizes both for chemistry and
for the advancement of peace,
it endangers the lives of "hun
dreds of thousands of people."
That is a risk we need not take.
The fact is, we do not even
need nuclear fission. In the
short-run, we must merely
conserve more and make use
of available energy, in the
forms of oil, gas, and perhaps
coal. In the long-run, solar
power can provide for all of our
energy needs, both cheaply
and renewably.
Nuclear power, however, is
non-renewable. It cannot be
obtained merely by splitting
any atom. Rather, it requires
the use ot special types of
uranium, which are scarce and
highly conducive to the con
struction of nuclear bombs by
terrorist groups.
Regarding the waste disposal
problem, I quote from E.F.
Schumacher's Small is Beauti
ful : "A new dimension is given
by the fact that while man now
can and does create radioac
tive elements, there is nothing
he can do to reduce their
radioactivity once he has
created them . . . what is a safe
place, let us say, for the
enormous amounts of radioac
tive waste products created by
nuclear reactors? No place on
Earth can be shown safe."
Anti-nuclear activists, such
as Shumacher, Pauling, or the
distinguished members of the
Cambridge-based Union of
Concerned Scientists are
clearly not intent upon
frightening America, contrary
to the implications of Teller.
Nor are the unanimous insur
ance executives who refuse to
insure nuclear plants against a

catastrophe.
And, if these experts and
other opponents of nuclear fis
sion are opposed to the con
cept of America fighting in Vie
tnam, then that should be held
to their credit, as indicative of
their capacity to reason.
In closing, I again quote
from Schumacher: "No degree
of prosperity could justify the
accumulation of highly toxic
substances which nobody
knows how to make 'safe' . . .
To do such a thing is a trans
gression against life itself. . .It
means conducting the
economic affairs of man as if
people really did not matter at
all."
