## '80s forum takes narrow focus 
### 
The Issues of the '80s prog
ram illustrated the lack of
broad understanding among
most American economists,
businessmen and political sci
entists of some critical ques
tions concerning the United
States' relationships with other
countries and about the re
straints that may be imposed
upon our economic growth by
environmental factors in the
future.
Peter Duignan's statement
that, "the Soviets will overtake
us" unless we improve our
military strength assumes that
the Soviet arms buildup is for
offensive purposes against the
United States, rather than a de
fensive response to our own
massive arms buildup follow
ing World War 11.
There is not strong evidence
to support such a supposi
tion. The United States pre
sently poses no great threat to
the Soviet Union.
Duignan's assertion that the
Soviet leaders feel they can win
a nuclear war is entirely un
founded. Russia cannot de
stroy U.S. weapons systems

adequately or fast enough to
prevent effective U.S. retalia
tion.
Our military experts openly
recognized this while testifying
at the SALT II debates in Con
gress this cummer. It does not
seem plausible that the Soviet
leaders do not recognize this
fact also.
The most likely cause of a
Russian attack on the United
States is the possibility that
Russian leaders might view
U.S. arms buildups as a threat
to their security as the tyrant
leaders of a great power.
That Russian imperialism is
motivated by defensive goals is
evidenced by Russia's failure to
establish satellite states in any
countries except those which
immediately encircle its boun
daries, although such an op
portunity has existed. Soon
after World War II Russian
troops retreated from Finland,
which they had occupied dur
ing the war, though the United
States imposed no pressure
upon them to do so.
The United States has been
more aggressive in establish

ing influence for military and
perhaps economically im
perialistic reasons, over na
tions whose allegiance is not
required for military security.
Turkey, Pakistan, India and
East Timor are examples.
Taxes and government
spending are too high. How
ever Alvin Rabuska's implica
tion that this is due to too much
government regulation is en
tirely false.
The greatest part of our gov
ernment spending consists of
subsidies and contracts
awarded to businesses to fund
research and development ef
forts.
Failure to regulate the
growth of large businesses ren
dered large corporations fi
nancially powerful enough to
organize unduly effective lob
bies in Congress, which en
dorse policies beneficial to the
companies they represent,
such as government subsidies
and contracts.
Big business is also able to
lobby effectively for tax breaks,
which create unfair disadvan
tages forsmall, new businesses
and also necessitate increasing
taxes imposed upon private
citizens.
Rabuska's claim that "re
newed competition" would be
"made possible by decreased
regulation" is clearly false, for
our society has undeniably
demonstrated that in this age
of fast, long-distance transpor
tation and communication,
business, if unregulated, forms
trusts which create
monopolies. Also, our society
has demonstrated clearly that
regulation is necessary to pro
tect consumers and laborers
from exploitation and to pro

tect the environment.
None of the speakers at th«
program dealt with there
straints environmental factor*
will impose upon oui
economic growth, despite the
feelings of many environmen
talists that continuec
economic growth could rendei
the earth unfit for human habi
tation.
Even assuming we never
poison our air, water or food, it
is imminent that the depletion
of non-renewable natural re
sources, which provide the raw
materials for nearly all of our
production, will lead to scar
city, inflation and, eventually,
depression. The prices of gold,
silver, aluminum, copper, oil
and natural gas have already
begun to skyrocket as easily
accessible reserves run out.
If conservation necessitates
limiting our CNP, then we
need to do this. Vet none of the
speakers at the Issues of the
'80s program even questioned
continued growth as an
economic goal.
I feel that the program was of
little value because it failed to
address key ideological ques
tions concerning American
values, ethics and perceptions.
That only a narrow range of
viewpoints was presented is
evidenced by the dominance
of economists on the roster.
Not a single environmentalist
spoke. If the purpose of this
program was to present new
and original ideas, or simply to
broaden the understanding of
the participants, then the
Alumni Association definitely
failed to achieve its goals.

values, ethics and perceptions.

The Issues of the '80s prog
ram illustrated the lack of
broad understanding among
most American economists,
businessmen and political sci
entists of some critical ques
tions concerning the United
States' relationships with other
countries and about the re
straints that may be imposed
upon our economic growth by
environmental factors in the
future.
Peter Duignan's statement
that, "the Soviets will overtake
us" unless we improve our
military strength assumes that
the Soviet arms buildup is for
offensive purposes against the
United States, rather than a de
fensive response to our own
massive arms buildup follow
ing World War 11.
There is not strong evidence
to support such a supposi
tion. The United States pre
sently poses no great threat to
the Soviet Union.
Duignan's assertion that the
Soviet leaders feel they can win
a nuclear war is entirely un
founded. Russia cannot de
stroy U.S. weapons systems

adequately or fast enough to
prevent effective U.S. retalia
tion.
Our military experts openly
recognized this while testifying
at the SALT II debates in Con
gress this cummer. It does not
seem plausible that the Soviet
leaders do not recognize this
fact also.
The most likely cause of a
Russian attack on the United
States is the possibility that
Russian leaders might view
U.S. arms buildups as a threat
to their security as the tyrant
leaders of a great power.
That Russian imperialism is
motivated by defensive goals is
evidenced by Russia's failure to
establish satellite states in any
countries except those which
immediately encircle its boun
daries, although such an op
portunity has existed. Soon
after World War II Russian
troops retreated from Finland,
which they had occupied dur
ing the war, though the United
States imposed no pressure
upon them to do so.
The United States has been
more aggressive in establish

ing influence for military and
perhaps economically im
perialistic reasons, over na
tions whose allegiance is not
required for military security.
Turkey, Pakistan, India and
East Timor are examples.
Taxes and government
spending are too high. How
ever Alvin Rabuska's implica
tion that this is due to too much
government regulation is en
tirely false.
The greatest part of our gov
ernment spending consists of
subsidies and contracts
awarded to businesses to fund
research and development ef
forts.
Failure to regulate the
growth of large businesses ren
dered large corporations fi
nancially powerful enough to
organize unduly effective lob
bies in Congress, which en
dorse policies beneficial to the
companies they represent,
such as government subsidies
and contracts.
Big business is also able to
lobby effectively for tax breaks,
which create unfair disadvan
tages forsmall, new businesses
and also necessitate increasing
taxes imposed upon private
citizens.
Rabuska's claim that "re
newed competition" would be
"made possible by decreased
regulation" is clearly false, for
our society has undeniably
demonstrated that in this age
of fast, long-distance transpor
tation and communication,
business, if unregulated, forms
trusts which create
monopolies. Also, our society
has demonstrated clearly that
regulation is necessary to pro
tect consumers and laborers
from exploitation and to pro

tect the environment.
