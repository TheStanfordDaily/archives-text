## Daily publishes heinous ad 
### 
It seems hard to believe that
after all the outrage expressed
— correctly — over the sexist
Dos Equis advertisement, the
Daily would see fit to publish a
full-page ad for the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, the
largest developer and deposit
ory of nuclear weapons in the
world.
It would seem almost superf
luous to say that the arms race
is one of humanity's gravest
problems, and that the idea of
the government holding its
own citizens hostage in a nuc
lear deterrence strategy is no
thing short of murderous.
Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory is not merely a par
ticipant in this terrorism — a
role that would be reason
enough to refuse its adver
tisement — it is the chief de
veloper of nuclear weapons
technology in the Western

world.
The relationship of Liver
more Labs to the University of
California has come under in
creasing scrutiny and criticism
of late. Serious questions have
been raised over the relation
ship of university research to
the maintenance of the arms
race, and of higher education
to the nature of the state as an
alien, demanding entity.
Livermore Labs is only the tip
of the proverbial iceberg on
this issue, but its role in nuc
lear weapons technology
makes it a priority tor activists.
The publication of this ad
vertisement calls into question
the consciousness of the entire
Daily editorial staff as to what is
important to students.
Only last year student-run
newspapers turned down luc
rative advertisement contracts
with the Bank of America, Ford

and other U.S. corporations
because of their involvement
in South Africa. Only several
weeks ago students protested
the Dos Equis ads.
The role of Lawrence Liver
more Labs is not an equivocal
issue — the level of activism on
the issueof the laboratory itself
should have made the inclu
sion of this ad a non-debatable
issue in the Daily office.
The question then is: is there
any advertisement policy in
practice at the Daily? How
many more post facto
apologies can we expect?
