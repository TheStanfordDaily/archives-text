## TDS displays gumption 
### 
As I wait with bated breath
for the next installment of the
TDS self-righteousness dis
play, I marvel at the gumption
of a company that fired 36
employees for a supposed an
nual profit loss of a sum barely
large enough to pay for one
half of one of their full-page
ads in the Daily last week.
Among TDS's more interest
ingand ever-mutating justiffca
tions for the mass firing is the
statement that they did not
know we were talking unions
— a degree of obtuseness even
we failed to merit them with,
given the fact that Andrew
Brooks, TDS food manager,
was told by both our managers
weeks before the firing, and
admitted such knowledge in
the same paper that his com
pany now denies it.
But I mean to set the com
munity straight on various fai
lures TDS has not yet exhumed.
For instance, the issue of the
platoons of children we regu
larly entertained in our
kitchen. One of our greatest
disappointments in our con
certed efforts to desanitize the
Coffee House was the collapse

of plans to invite an entire Little
League fresh from „ the
diamond to tramp mud across
the prep table. The best we
ever managed was an occa
sional visit by our manager's in
fant son, whose mother stoutly
refused to allow him to play
freely in a tub of egg salad, as
we would have liked.
And although we made every
effort to lower the laudable
hygienic standards of our
taskmakers, we never success
lully managed to win a citation
from the Health Department.
To our dismay, one of the in
spectors told us the Coffee
House was one of the few
places in Palo Alto where he
would consider buying food.
And alas, those six full-time
workers: one of them really let
us down by daring to enroll iri
Stanford while working a 40-
hour week. Not to mention the
part-timers, some of whom did
not take a summer vacation
from the University. We knew
they'd fall through when au
tumn came, but we hoped bet
ter of them during the hot
months.

But attention, Stanford! TDS
has failed to inform you that
these same horrible, lazy, dirty
workers have all been offered
their jobs back in a barrage of
telegrams over the last two
weeks. Some of them have ac
tually survived nearly three
months of unemployment and
have accepted these positions!
The question of back pay has
been graciously deferred until
court proceedings begin in
February.
The real question for the
Stanford community these
days is a far greater issue than
the Coffee House. For those
three-quarters of the under
graduates who cannot partici
pate in the wonderfully
profitable atmosphere of a
beer joint favored by TDS, Tre
sidder remains about as much
of a student union as an airport
waiting lounge. Some would
even assert that there is no stu
dent union on campus.
Well, campers, appearance
is as appearance does. Wel
come to the Tresidder Shop
ping Center.
