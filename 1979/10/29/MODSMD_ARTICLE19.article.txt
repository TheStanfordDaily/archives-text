Sex object-tion
The single most intelligent
statement I have heard on the
women's movement and the
relationship between the sexes
comes from a woman who has
fought all her life for women's
rights, and is the divorced
mother of two.
"There is absolutely nothing
wrong with men making sex
objects of women — or women
making sex objects of men, for
that matter. After all, we are
human. What is wrong is mak
ing them into nothing but sex
objects."
To any intelligent reader,
this is patently obvious. But
how often is it stated?
The fact is, as human beings
we are sexual animals; it fills
our lives and culture, and af
fects the things we do in more
ways than we know.
As long as there are human
beings, there will be sex and
sex objects. The crucial thing
to remember is that people are
more than simply sex objects.
On the other hand, how
ever, Dan Rath's letter (Daily,
Oct. 12) was way off the beam,
light clothing is comfortable
I here isn't any reason why we
shouldn't all take advantage of
the sun while we can.
In many parts of the world,

people wear nothing but
G-strings, but a G-string is per
fectly appropriate dress and is
not considered "revealing" in
any way.
Only the fact that our society
is hideously sexually repressed
causes us to react in the way
that Rath describes.
I would suggest that he calm
down and think about it a little
more. No one is "teasing" him
— his "lustful thoughts" are
the products of his own mind.
There is nothing wrong with
his thinking them, provided
that he is aware that the person
he is looking at has other qual
ities, too, and may not like
being treated first and
foremost as a «ex object.

Charles Hoard (Daily, Oct.
19) and I clearly have consider
able differences of opinion on
nuclear powei, but let me has
ten to assure him that I am not
about to defend the classifica
tion ambiguities and absur
dities of the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954. What I said in my letter
was that nothing related to
nuclear power generation is
classified (with noted excep
tions), and I stand by that
statement.

Such data were in fact de
classified in 1955 (in conformity
with the provisions of the Act
quoted by Hoard); since then,
all basic nuclear data and nuc
lear power plant design and
engineering data have been
openly published.
In fact, the extensive growth
and development of nuclear
power, which its critics con
stantly complain of, would
have been absolutely impossi
ble if classification restrictions
applied.
On whether nuclear power
plants are "what" one needs
or "all" one needs, I don't dis
pute that other countries could
use nuclear plants for weapons
development. But there are
many other paths to weapons
that don't require nuclear
power plants.
We have no control over
most of these paths. We do
have some control over the
nuclear power path, through
domestic export regulation
and through international
safeguards as administered by
the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
Finally, the matter of
"hypocritical" officials.
Export-import regulations for
nuclear materials and facilities
are given in the Code of Fed
eral Regulation and conform »o
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation

Act of 1978,
Under the law and these
regulations, authority for
licensing nuclear exports rests
with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, subject to review
by the Executive Branch. The
criteria for such review are
carefully specified; the ex
ported material or reactor must
be subject to lAEA safeguards,
cannot be used for explosives,
will not be inimical to the na
tional defense, etc.
These, not "profitability,"
are what the officials have to
determine and demonstrate. I
see no inconsistency, to say
nothing of hypocrisy, in an of
fice like Sec. of State Cyrus
Vance approving the export of
a power plant if these non
proliferation objectives have
been met, N and his condemna
tion of what he perceives as a
different type of proliferation
threat. I say this even though I
may disagree with his percep
tion in the case of the Progres
sive article.

No tanks
We were impressed with the
compelling logic of Peter
Duignan ("Issues of the
'80s . . Daily, Oct. 22) who

spoke so eloquently of the
need to fortify a frail America.
In particular we are taken with
his suggestion that we . .
build more tanks than we build
cars."
Only the timid will be dis
turbed to note certain con
sequences of Duignan's
suggestion.
It we assume tanks bought in
bulk (wholesale, so to speak)
can be obtained for $10,000
each, a bargain if we ever heard
of one, the 10 million tanks
would cost $100 billion per
year, which might not leave
enough for bullets and other
sundries.
Of course, purple prose is
the prerogative of panicked
pedants, and, on reflection,
doubtless, the eminent
economist might speak with
more circumspection or preci
sion.
Or perhaps he had a serious
purpose in mind — namely, a
solution, albeit uncomforta
ble, to the urgent need for
mass transit.
To that we say "No Tanks."

most of these paths. We do
have some control over the
nuclear power path, through
domestic export regulation
and through international
safeguards as administered by
the International Atomic
Energy Agency.
Finally, the matter of
"hypocritical" officials.
Export-import regulations for
nuclear materials and facilities
are given in the Code of Fed
eral Regulation and conform »o
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation

Act of 1978,
Under the law and these
regulations, authority for
licensing nuclear exports rests
with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, subject to review
by the Executive Branch. The
criteria for such review are
carefully specified; the ex
ported material or reactor must
be subject to lAEA safeguards,
cannot be used for explosives,
will not be inimical to the na
tional defense, etc.
These, not "profitability,"
are what the officials have to
determine and demonstrate. I
see no inconsistency, to say
nothing of hypocrisy, in an of
fice like Sec. of State Cyrus
Vance approving the export of
a power plant if these non
proliferation objectives have
been met, N and his condemna
tion of what he perceives as a
different type of proliferation
threat. I say this even though I
may disagree with his percep
tion in the case of the Progres

No tanks
We were impressed with the
compelling logic of Peter
Duignan ("Issues of the
'80s . . Daily, Oct. 22) who

spoke so eloquently of the
need to fortify a frail America.
In particular we are taken with
his suggestion that we . .
build more tanks than we build
cars."
Only the timid will be dis
turbed to note certain con
sequences of Duignan's
suggestion.
It we assume tanks bought in
bulk (wholesale, so to speak)
can be obtained for $10,000
each, a bargain if we ever heard
of one, the 10 million tanks
would cost $100 billion per
year, which might not leave
enough for bullets and other
sundries.
Of course, purple prose is
the prerogative of panicked
pedants, and, on reflection,
doubtless, the eminent
economist might speak with
more circumspection or preci
sion.
Or perhaps he had a serious
purpose in mind — namely, a
solution, albeit uncomforta
ble, to the urgent need for
mass transit.
To that we say "No Tanks."

Sex object-tion
The single most intelligent
statement I have heard on the
women's movement and the
relationship between the sexes
comes from a woman who has
fought all her life for women's
rights, and is the divorced
mother of two.
"There is absolutely nothing
wrong with men making sex
objects of women — or women
making sex objects of men, for
that matter. After all, we are
human. What is wrong is mak
ing them into nothing but sex
objects."
To any intelligent reader,
this is patently obvious. But
how often is it stated?
The fact is, as human beings
we are sexual animals; it fills
our lives and culture, and af
fects the things we do in more
ways than we know.
As long as there are human
beings, there will be sex and
sex objects. The crucial thing
to remember is that people are
more than simply sex objects.
On the other hand, how
ever, Dan Rath's letter (Daily,
Oct. 12) was way off the beam,
light clothing is comfortable
I here isn't any reason why we
shouldn't all take advantage of
the sun while we can.
In many parts of the world,

people wear nothing but
G-strings, but a G-string is per
fectly appropriate dress and is
not considered "revealing" in
any way.
Only the fact that our society
is hideously sexually repressed
causes us to react in the way
that Rath describes.
I would suggest that he calm
down and think about it a little
more. No one is "teasing" him
— his "lustful thoughts" are
the products of his own mind.
There is nothing wrong with
his thinking them, provided
that he is aware that the person
he is looking at has other qual
ities, too, and may not like
being treated first and
foremost as a «ex object.

Charles Hoard (Daily, Oct.
19) and I clearly have consider
able differences of opinion on
nuclear powei, but let me has
ten to assure him that I am not
about to defend the classifica
tion ambiguities and absur
dities of the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954. What I said in my letter
was that nothing related to
nuclear power generation is
classified (with noted excep
tions), and I stand by that
statement.

Such data were in fact de
classified in 1955 (in conformity
with the provisions of the Act
quoted by Hoard); since then,
all basic nuclear data and nuc
lear power plant design and
engineering data have been
openly published.
In fact, the extensive growth
and development of nuclear
power, which its critics con
stantly complain of, would
have been absolutely impossi
ble if classification restrictions
applied.
On whether nuclear power
plants are "what" one needs
or "all" one needs, I don't dis
pute that other countries could
use nuclear plants for weapons
development. But there are
many other paths to weapons
that don't require nuclear
power plants.
We have no control over
most of these paths. We do
have some control over the
