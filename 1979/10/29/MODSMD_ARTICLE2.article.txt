# Parking zones under closer police scrutiny

"Our goal is not to get people to
purchase parking stickers," said
Marvin Herrington, director of the
Stanford Department of Public
Safety, "hut we are trying to enforce
the parking regulations more strictly
this year."
According to Robert Hamrdla,
chairman of the University Commit
tee on Parking and Transportation
and assistant to the president, the
basis for the parking sticker
"crackdown" is that it is simply unfair
for some students to get by without
buying parking stickers."
The fraternities seem to be most
directly affected by the parking
sticker crackdown. "The frats are a
part ot the Stanford system. Al
though they may not respect the
rules of the system, they must pay
their tines like everyone else here,"
said Herrington.
Last summer, signs designating
certified parking areas were posted
near the fraternities. According to
Herrington and Hamrdla, however,
members of some of the fraternities
tore them down.
At a committee on Parking and
Transportation meeting Friday, Oct.
19, Herrington called the parking
problem between the fraternities
and the police a "miniature war."
Avoid confusion
Now that the six community ser
vice officers are increasing surveil
lance near the fraternities, various
steps have been taken by Herrington
and his staff to avert misunderstand
ings about parking.
"We first placed warning notes on
the cars illegally parked around the
frats. We wanted to make sure that
everyone realised that we were en
forcing the rules. Tickets are now
being given for violations," Her

rington said.
The Department ot Public Safety
met with the house managers from
several fraternities a lew weeks ago.
The trats were informed by Her
rington that their "grace period" was
over, and they should consider
themselves lucky tor any "lenience"
in the past.

Alpha Delta house manager Roger
Wiebelhaus said he had noticed
more officers in the area but had not
heard too many people complain.
John Peck house manager at
Sigma Alpha Epsilon said that his
fraternity had researched the parking
situation. "We are taking the
crackdown more seriously, and we
are trying to cooperate," he as
serted.
The number ot tickets being writ
ten has not substantially risen during
the past few weeks, Herrington
acknowledged. The community ser
vice officers have merely been
shitted to the areas near the frater
nities to accomodate the new direc
tion of enforcement.
The fine for parking illegally is
$2. All of the money collected
from fines goes to Santa Clara
County and not to Stanford.
Although the prices of the stickers
have not yet soared with inflation,
the committee mav need to consider
a possible parking sticker fee in
crease in the tall of 1900 or 1981, Her
rington said. Such a decision would
require more data, Hamrdla noted.
"It's not that we're trying to
squeeze more money out of those
people parking in residences and
fraternities. We are just trying to do a
more effective and efficient job of
enforc ing the regulations in the areas
designated lor certain vehicles and
stickers, ' Herrington concluded.
