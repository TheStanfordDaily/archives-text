# Oregon State snaps losing streak at Cards' expense, 33-31
## Beavers' gnawing makes Stanford's stomach turn 
### Ivan Maisel 
Corvallis, Ore. — The Stan
ford Cardinals proved Saturday
against Oregon State that they
have learned from experience
— only they learned the wrong
lessons.
Looking just as USC did
against the Cards two weeks
ago, three-touchdown favorite
Stanford jumped to a big lead,
relaxed, then Mailed helplessly
4s winless Oregon State rose
trom the Pacific-10 Conference
dead to upset the Cards 33-31.
The lly in Stanford's oint
ment was not just that Oregon
State was 0-7, not that the
Beavers had not scored a
touchdown in conference
play. I! was not even the tact
that Oregon State had not
beaten Stanford since 1968.
And although the loss
knocked the Cards out of prac
tical contention for the Pac-10
spot in the Rose Bowl, that was
not the most stomach-turning
effect, either.
It was the way they lost. In a
finish that no one would dare
make up, the Cards went from
eight points up to two points
down in only two seconds.
Tyinj> TD
Down il-23 with 1:15 to play
in the game, Oregon State
capped its third length-of-the
field drive when freshman tail
back Terry Southern, subbing
for injured starter Darryl
Minor, bulled over left tackle
on a fourth-and-goal from the
one to pull (he Beavers within
two at
OSU converted its second
two-pointer this year when
quarterback Scott Richardson
lofted a pass to fullback Tony
Robinson, who was the only

player on the left side of the
field.
The Cards lined nine men up
front for the expected onside
kick by Kieron Walford. The
OSU kicker double-crossed
them, sending it deep and over
the heads of .Cardinal return
men Rick Gervais and Vincent
White.
Gervais, playing before a
home-state crowd, ran back
and caught the ball over his
right shoulder at the two and
downed the ball in the end
zone for an apparent
touchback.
However, once the ball is
caught in the field of play it
cannot be downed in the end
zone. Thus Gervais' knee
touching the end zone grass
cost the Cards two points, pos
session of the ball, and on the
scoreboard at least, the game.
All this in only two seconds.
The Cards got possession
once more, desperately drove
to the OSU 40, and then
watched sickly as Ken Naber's
booming 57-yard field goal at
tempt was wide by less than a
yard.
Explanation
A thoroughly despondent
Gervais slumped as he sat on
the postgame locker room
bench, rubbing his tear
streaked eyes and trying to re
cover from the shock of his last
catch.
"I was running looking up
held at the ball. I caught it,
looked down and I was in the
end zone. I downed the ball —
the best thing was to down the
ball," Gervais quietly
explained. "We didn't have a
return set up (because of the
expected onside kick).

Referee Charles Moffett cal
led the safety, explaining "I felt
he (Gervais) caught the ball be
tween the two and the 3-yard
line. There is no such thing as
momentum on a kick play car
rying you into the end zone.
When you catch the ball in the
field of play and carry it into the
end zone, you must bring it
out."
An obviously disappointed
Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower was philosophical
about Gervais' mistake, calling
it a "judgment on Rick's part."
"He was confused. They
were gonna kick onside but
they changed their mind when
they saw us (the nine men) up
there. He (Gervais) felt it was
worth anything to get the ball,"
Dowhower said.
"I don't know what the
communication was back
there," Dowhower continued.
"A difficult catch is not prefer
red to letting the ball roll
through the end zone. He
wanted a return."
The communication was
good as the kick sailed back,
according to White, the other
return man. "We both thought
he caught it at the one and the
ball carried him in.' I just said
'Stay down.' "
It was a particularly sweet
win for OSU head coach Craig
Fertig, who was fired this past
week (effective at the end of
the season). At the end of the
game Fertig was carried to the
middle of the field by his ecsta
tic players and then engulfed
by them.
"I can't say enough for these
kids," Fertig said. "It was a
great effort against an out
standing football team, after

what they (the OSU players)
have been through. That was
one hell of an effort against a
damn fine football team."
Big early lead
Stanford looked damn fine
as the game began, taking the
opening kickotf and then
going 80 yards in only three
plays. On a second-and-eight
trom the Stanford 22, fullback
Greg Hooper, starting in place
of Jim Brown, broke open
down the left sideline for 55
yards before being knocked
out of bounds at the OSU 23 by
safety Leroy Edwards. It was
the longest run from scrim
mage by a Card this year.
It that was a surprise, then
the touchdown on the follow
ing play was a shock. Reserve
lullback Mark Mordell, sub
bing for the winded Hooper,
slipped into the right secon
dary where quarterback Turk
Schonert found him all alone at
the 12. Mordell breezed into
the end zone untouched and
Stanford had scored in only 55
seconds. Naber converted to
make it 7-0.
The teams traded possession
and the Cards were in a punt
ing situation on fourth-and
nine at their own 12.
Naber's line-drive kick was
caught by Beaver returner
Steve Coury at Stanford's 48.
Coury got to the left sideline,
cut back behind Naber at the
ten and sped into the end zone
to the joyous howls of the es
timated crowd of 16,000
touchdown-starved OSU fans.
Stanford came back on the
ensuing possession, driving 75
yards in twelve plays to go
ahead 14-7 with 1:52 left in the
opening quarter. Schonert was
the key man in the drive,
sneaking tor 14 yards or. a
lourth-and-one from the
Beaver 23 to keep the drive
alive.
Three plays after the score,
the Cards had the ball again.
Safety Kevin MacMillan sepa
rated OSU tailback Minor from
a Richardson pass with a vici
ous hit, and Gervais fell on the
ball at the Beaver 38.
Stanford got a field goal out
of that possession, Naber split
ting the uprights from 46 yards
to make it 17-7 with 14:15 re
maining in the halt.
MacMillan set up another
Stanford score with his second
interception of the season. The
freshman, playing before
friends (MacMillan is from Port
land), grabbed a pass Coury
coughed up and weaved down
the left side of the field to the
Oregon State 12. A personal

foul on the Beavers moved the
ball to the six.
On third down from the
four, Ken Margerum reached
backwards while running full
speed to catch a Schonert pass
and put Stanford ahead by a
23-7 score.
Turning point
The following drive was the
turning point of the game.
Oregon State steadily drove 80
yards, the last 36 exclusively on
the ground, to pull within 10 at
the half. Robinson dove over
left guard for the six, and Wal
ford converted.
"I told our players at halftime
that we took the morrientum
away from Stanford with the
second touchdown and if we
could take the opening kickoff
of the second half and go down
and score we could win this
football game," Fertig said.
Oregon State took the sec
ond half kickoff and marched
75 yards in 18 plays, swallowing
8:25 of the clock; 16 of the
plays were runs, Robinson
going over the left side once
again for the touchdown. Wal
tord's extra point was wide left,
thus the score remained 24-20.
That was the only scoring of
the third quarter, as the Stan
ford offense played as if going
through the motions. The
Cards only had the ball for 3:43
of the quarter, and lost their
second possession when
White fumbled the ball at the
OSU 46seconds into the fourth
quarter.
The Beavers pounced on the
opportunity the fumble pre
sented them, getting two first
downs before a third-down
blitz caught Richardson nine
yards behind the line at the
Cardinal 32. Walford blasted
his 50-yard field goal attempt
against the wind through the
uprights and the Beavers were
within one, 24-23.
Stanford momentarily woke
up, striking for a touchdown in
lightning-quick fashion. In just
over a minute-and-a-half, the
Cards moved 72 yards in five
plays, with )ohn Elway passing
to a leaping Andre Tyler for the
score from eight yards out.
Naber converted, and the
Cards had a supposedly safe
eight-point lead with 8:46 left
to play.
Oregon State's final
touchdown drive took 19 plays
and almost seven-and-one-half
minutes. They converted two
third down plays and two
fourth down plays, including
Robinson's final touchdown
that set off the incredible series
of events of the final 1:15.
