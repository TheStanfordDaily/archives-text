# Yankees fire Martin again

### 
New York (AP) — Billy Martin,
fresh from another of his
celebrated controversies, was
fired yesterday as manager of
the New York Yankees.
The Yankees announced that
Dick Howser, a previous Yan
kees' coach and presently
manager of the Florida State
University baseball team,
would be Martin's replace
ment.
It is the second time in his
stormy career that Martin
has parted ways with the al

ways news-making Yankees. In
the middle of the 1978 season,
Martin bid a tearful and bitter
farewell after a series of prob
lems both with management
and superstar Reggie jackson.
With a long history of fight
ing, the trigger-tempered Mar
tin caused the Yankees no end
of embarrassment. After he
was involved in a fight with a
sports writer in Reno, Nev., in
November 1978, Yankee owner
George Steinbrenner handed
down an ultimatum that Martin

would only return to the Yan
kees if he "were on his best
behavior."
He was relatively fight-free in
1979, although he had person
ality conflicts with jackson in a
continuing clash of monumen
tal egos.
Less than a month after the
season, Martin then made
some news of his own in
Bloomington, Minn., when he
was accused of punching an Il
linois man in a hotel.
