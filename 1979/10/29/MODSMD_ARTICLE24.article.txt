## Poloists lose to USC 
### Brad Brockbank 
Sudden death meant exactly
that for the Stanford water polo
team Friday as USC's Craig
Furniss fired a shot past Cardi
nal goalie John Gansel in the
opening seconds of the sud
den death overtime period,
giving the Trojans a shocking
10-9 upset victory over the No.
1-ranked Cards.
Even more shocking was the
fact that Stanford had the game
seemingly well in hand as regu
lation play began to close. With
a minute left in the contest, the
Cards held a seemingly insur
mountable 9-7 lead. Then
funny things started to hap
pen.
With 55 seconds left, Stan
ford had apparently turned
back a USC 6-on-5 situation,
junior Steve Smith and two
Trojan players were batting a
loose ball about when the
spheroid disappeared under
the beseiged surface..of the
water for several seconds.
The Cards, logically, antici
pated the call from referee Bob
Lee signifying a USC turnover.
But no call was forthcoming,
and Trojan Les Wulk slung a
shot past the unprepared Car
dinal defense.
Victory still seemed immi
nent for the Cards, however, as
they found themselves in pos
session of the ball with.less

than 35 seconds left after re
covering their own shot.
But like the football team in
Corvallis, victory was not meant
to be for Stanford. Instead of
passing the ball back to Gansel
to let him run the time out, the
fickle orb was tossed some
what errantly toward Jamie"
Bergeson, who was closely
guarded on the right side of the
pool.
(he ensuing seconds saw
USC's Jeff Stevens steal the ball
and drive down the pool to
shoot an unassisted, unham
pered tying goal.
With 13 seconds remaining
in the game, the Cards were a
man up. Unfortunately, Stan
ford was unable to capitalize
on the advantage, neither team
could score in standard over
time, and the game went into
sudden Card death.
The climactic ending over
shadowed whal was otherwise
a very good game for both
teams. Stanford edged out to a
2-1 lead at the end of the first
quarter, then pulled to a 6-4
advantage by halftime.
An exciting third quarter, in
which the two teams ex
changed a pair of goals, ended
with four rapid-fire shots by
the Cards. Unfortunately, Tro
jan goalie Jack Graham
blocked each one successfully.

day at Oregon State, completing 17 of 20 passes for 238 yards and

however, as Stanford fell to the Beavers 33-31.
