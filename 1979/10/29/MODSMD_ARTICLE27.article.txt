# McNevin's goal beats Santa Clara
## Cards build 1-0 shutout 
### Dean Eyre 
Santa Clara — "It wasn't
pretty," said head coach Nel
son Lodge, "but a win is a win is
a win."
Without flair, Stanford's
soccer team got the job done,
shutting down most of Santa
Clara's offense in a 1-0 upset
victory over the country's
11th-best squad yesterday af
ternoon.
Rather than striving for an
award-winning structure, the
Cardinals constructed a con
crete wall, much like the stark,
solid lines of Buck Shaw
stadium and defended the lone
goal, Dan McNevin's penalty
shot for 70 minutes.
By defeating the Broncos,
Stanford improves its record to
12-3-2, one of the best in the
West, and moves into first
place in the Pacific Soccer Con
ference with a 4-1 league mark.
Santa Clara, now 11-4-1 overall,
3-1 in conference play, drops
out of first.
More importantly, the vic
tory actually edges the Cards
past the Broncs as far as reg
ional rankings go, since Stan

ford tied Westmont 1-1 last
week and the Warriors had
previously beaten Santa Clara
and UCLA, while the Bruins
shut out the Broncos 1-0 ear
lier.
Stanford's yo-yo-like per
formance in the ratings game
should take another upswing,
since prior to the Santa Clara
game the Broncos were ranked
second in the West and 11th
nationally.
Following losses to San Fran
cisco" State and Fresno State,
Stanford went from fourth to
10th, lower than its preseason
ranking. On the strength ot a
solid performance against
Westmont Wednesday, a 2-1
overtime victory over UC-
Santa Barbara Thursday and
yesterday's shutout, the Cards
could move up to third or
fourth in the West, according
to Lodge.
What made yesterday's
upset so sweet, even eclipsing
the 2-1 overtime victory over
San Jose State, is that since
1973 the Broncos dominated
the series, allowing only one
win in '77.

"It was another best victory
in my career," exclaimed a ju
bilant Greg Delgado after the
final gun. The senior sweeper,
along with outstanding per
formances by Neil Tennyson,
Doug Clark, Barry Linnett,
Rick Cordon and Craig L'eland,
anchored a stingy defense that
shut down many Bronco scor
ing threats.
"It was a defensive strug
gle," Lodge said. "All five de
fenders were incredible. It was
kind ot scary soccer. . . and of
course we were lucky; you've
got to have luck."
Santa Clara has been missing
the midfield services of Clive
Barrett, but striker Miguel Avila
was off the bench after being
injured earlier in the season.
Avila's effectiveness was
scouted by Lodge and his team
during Friday's Bronco-San
Diego State match, won by
Santa Clara. The Cards did
their homework with the sneak
preview, capitalizing on the
Broncos' weak side and thwart
ing Avila's goal potential by as
signing Tennyson to cover
him.
