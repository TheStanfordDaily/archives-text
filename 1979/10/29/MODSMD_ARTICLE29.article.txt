### Jennifer Seymour 
Stanford's field hockey team
overwhelmed the Simon Fraser
squad in Sunday's match with a
2-0 victory over the Canadian
visitors.
The Cardinals outshot Simon
Fraser 17 to one and won 10
corners to their three. Stanford
carried 10 minutes penetration
time, while Simon Fraser en
tered Stanford's 16-yard circle
(penalty area) for a total of
about four-and-one-half mi
nutes;

Stanford's domination came
trom the midfield where they
controlled the play both offen
sively and defensively, chang
ing fields and place before the
visitors could recover.
The lirst goal was put in by
Nancy White off a corner play
hand stop by Becky Howell.
This White-Howell combina
tion play proved effective again
when Nancy White fed the ball
to Claudia Cold for the team's
second goal.
"Good same. We're really

doing well now; we've got it
together," said forward Becky
Howell after the game. Indeed,
the Cards' superiority was evi
dent Sunday, especially in the
skills and tactical maneuvers.
White and Nancy )o Geenan
both came through for numer
ous offensive rushes, while
halfbacks consistently gener
ated a variety of plays and shots
to the wings in both fields. This
manipulation kept the game
spread out and fast-paced as
Stanford consistently beat

Fraser to the ball.
The Cards' victory is a tune
up for Wednesday's final
NorCal home game of the
season, when they will meet
Sacramento State at 2:30 p.m.,
Roble Field.
Two weekends of travel will
follow this important match, as
the team goes south for two
matches with Arizona State and
Long Beach State. The follow
ing weekend they will partici
pate in the crucial Region Eight
Tournament.
