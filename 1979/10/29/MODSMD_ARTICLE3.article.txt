# Trustees to hear new dorm plans in Dec.
## 
### Victor Goetz 
various design proposals for the
new student residence to be built on
the west side of Lagunita Court are
currently being evaluated and will be
presented lor Board of Trustees dis
cussion in December.
Formal at tion on the project, how
ever, will not begin until alter the
board's February meeting.
One hitch in present plans is that
most proposals involve the removal
of the Lagunita parking lot built just
last year in the face of some emo
tional opposition.
The start of construction is
scheduled lor early 1982, according
to James Nelson of the business and
finance office. Therefore, some
question has been raised about the
planning that led to the possibility ot
a tour-year life for the $250,000 park
ing lot.
"The architects are strongly
against leaving the parking lot be
cause both visually and conceptually
it would be easier to establish a con
tinuity with the rest ot the campus if
there is not a parking lot there," said
Sally Cole, director ot research for
Student Affairs.
Yet, relocation of the parking lot is
unlikely, at least in the next few
years, according to Director ot Plan
ning Philip Williams.
Lot removal uncertain
"I doubt it would be moved be
cause of the cost (ot moving the lot).
This cost would only be justified if

that part ol the site were very impor
tant to the project. The architects
(Esherick, Homsey, Dodge and Davis
in San Erancisco) woulcJ prefer to
move it from the environmental
standpoint, he said.
"But they have presented plans
that do not involve its removal, and
these are most likely the ones we
would choose," he added.
The concern tor the immediate fu
ture is preparing a "program descrip
tion" for discussion at the December
board meeting.
Many considerations
The parking lot issue is just one of
the points that will be included in
that detailed evaluation ot each plan
currently under way by the Advisory
Committee on New Residences.
This year-old group ot 20 students,
faculty and staff, headed by Cole,
was "quite carefully selected to pro
vide the broadest perspective on re
sidence lite," she said.

It is important when you describe
a large building proposal to the
board that you give a pretty detailed
description ot the relative advan
tages of this site as opposed to the
others that you have explored," said
Cole.
In detail
The report, to be mailed to the
board in mid-November, will include
a "detailed description of what we
want — the type of housing, activities
that should be part of the residence
life," said Cole.
"There will be a section on cost
factors and alternative financing
strategies and a section on physical
sites which have been evaluated,"
she said.
"We don't have a final cost esti
mate tor the project yet. That is the
kind of thing that will be in the cost
section of the report. In the
November report it will not be a re
fined figure," said Cole.

Nelson said that his office is cur
rently digesting the information
given them by the program commit
tee and should have a cost estimate
within a few weeks.
"I'm a little reluctant at this time to
quote numbers because they're
quite general and I'm not sure just
how much meaning they have. Cost
rise is very important. Costs are ris
ing much taster than when we made
our $25 million estimate," said Nel
son.
Plans are moving along as quickly
as possible. Especially after the prime
lending rate has just gone up to 15
percent, "we assume that the costs
keep going up and are acting accord
ingly. No one is waiting around,"
said Williams.
Plans basically rest on alternative
designs tor two sites next to Lagunita
along Santa Teresa street or
pushed back from the street along

the lake.
The Santa Teresa site is the only
place large enough to accommodate
800 units, the housing need that was
determined in a )anuary 1978 report,
said Cole.
"This has long been a projected
housing site," she confirmed, ad
ding to the irony ot the parking lot
question.
"I think it's ironic that the parking
lot will probably have to be removed
after it wasn't so well received in the
first place," said Mike Charlson, a
student member of the committee.
Another student committee
member, who asked not to be named,
pointed out "that says something
about land use and how long-range
their (University planners') decisions
are. It says something about what
what sort of master plans they work
for."
"It seems a little silly to put in a

parking lot that isn't much used any
way and then to tear it right bad
down again. It was put up partly foi
the new dorm in the first place," saic
Rob Robinson, a Resident Fellow a
Lagunita who led the original opposr
tion to the lot. He is also a member ol
the advisory committee.
The site along the lake, which
seems to be favored, raises another
relocation cost: the driving range.
"I favor the plan that wraps around
the lake, but it's probably too expen
sive, and I think it'll be canned tor
that reason," said Charlson.
"There are some problems in
volved such as keeping the lake filled
on a full time basis, which isn't prac
tical. But no one wants to look out
over an empty pit," said the other
student committee member.
"I think that one of the things that
is important to us in the educational
sense is that the residents of the new
complex do not feel isolated from
the rest of the campus," Cole said.
