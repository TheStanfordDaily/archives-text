Kennedy wants to "get going"
Boston — Sen. Edward Kennedy, saying "I want
to get going," moves a step closer to becoming a
presidential candidate today with the formation of
an exploratory committee.
The Kennedy camp, having picked up the sup
port of Chicago's mayor Jane Byrne over the
weekend, will announce in Washington that a
committee is being set up to collect funds and
assess the Massachusetts senator's chances against
President )immy Carter in 1980.
However, aides say Kennedy will officially an
nounce his candidacy soon, perhaps even this
week.
On a flight across Massachusetts Friday night,
Kennedy told reporters, "I'm tired of screwing
around with this. I want to get going."
Kennedy is already considered to be a candidate
by the Federal Election Commission because he
has accepted campaign contributions.
On Saturday, Byrne said she will formally en
dorse Kennedy tomorrow. Her endorsement, she
said, "will go through November and until a Ken
nedy returns to the White House."
She said she was waiting until tomorrow be
cause, "I don't want to detract from his press.
"I still support the president. I make it very
clear. I think the president is a very good man and a
very honest man and that I would support him
until I thought ne could not win," Byrne said Satur
day.
Less than two weeks ago, Carter attended a din
ner in Chicago that raised more than $1 million for
Byrne, and the mayor said that if the election was
being held that day, she would vote for Carter.
Funds for King's work shelved
Washington — The Carter administration has
quietly shelved a request that the government
atone for FBI harassment of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. by using public funds to carry on the work
of the slain civil rights leader.
The proposal was presented to the Justice De
partment in October 1977 by former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark and came to light last week
in congressional testimony by King's widow,
Coretta Scott King.
Both Clark and Mrs. King said in interviews that

they believed the proposal was still under active
consideration by the Justice Department.
However, former Attorney General Griffin Bell,
who met with Clark on the subject in 1977, said the
idea "never got off the ground." A department
spokesman also said the proposal was no longer
under consideration.
Clark, who was attorney general from 1967 to
1969, said he gave Bell a list of suggestions that
called for the government to atone for the FBl's
attempt to discredit King in the 1960s by establish
ing a program to "advance the cause of Dr. King."
House pushes for oil profits tax
Kansas City, Mo. — Congress, "infuriated" by
the major oil companies' sharply higher third
quarter protits, will have a windfall profits tax on
President Jimmy Carter's desk by Thanksgiving,
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill said yesterday.
Speaking at a news conference here, where he
was to attend a fund-raising dinner for Rep.
Richard Boiling, (D-Mo.) O'Neill said he does not
accept the companies' claims that the profits are
needed to finance new oil exploration.
"I don't buy that," said O'Neill, (D-Mass). "They
say, 'He's just a politician, what does he know
about the oil business?' But I know what the
American people are concerned about, and they'd
better learn that soon."
He called the companies' third-quarter profits
— most of which were up substantially, some well
over 100 percent — "unpardonable."
"I wouldn't doubt, if the House were serious,
that they could even nationalize them," O'Neill
said, adding that he did not anticipate any such
effort.
"I would hope the conscience of the big oil
companies of America would reduce the price of
home tuel oil," he said. But O'Neill said he did not
expect any price reduction in gasoline.
Mexican plane crash kills 10
San Diego — A Mexican government airplane
flying American prisoners to a border exchange
slammed into a telephone pole in dense fog and
burst into flames early yesterday, killing all 10 per
sons aboard, officials said.

The dead included tour American prisoners and
six Mexicans, including four guards, the pilot and
the co-pilot, according to the U.S. consu'ate in
Tijuana, Mexico.
San Diego police Lt. Dave Spisak said the pilot of
the twin-engine Otter turboprop apparently be
came disoriented in the fog, and the plane wan
dered over the border into the United States.
The pilot contacted the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration's Miramar air traffic facility, and
operators there gave him his bearings and handed
control of the craft to Tijuana, Spisak said.
"After turning around, the craft hit a pole on top
of Spring Canyon and crashed," Spisak said. The
plane crashed and burned in the rugged Otay
Mesa south of San Diego.
Spisak said the plane picked up two of the pris
oners in Merida and two in Monterrey and was
headed for the airport at Tijuana, where they were
to be exchanged for Mexicans jailed in the United
States. The crash occurred less than one mile from
the U.S.-Mexican border.
Fonda plans to drop out of politics
Davis — Actress Jane Fonda, nowas fervent a foe
of nuclear energy as she was of the Vietnam War,
said Friday she will drop out of politics for a few
years to make films.
"I am stepping down from the political arena
and will be spending the next years of my life
pretty much exclusively making six films," Fonda
said. She did not give a reason for her plans.
She talked with reporters before she and her
political activist husband, Tom Hayden, spoke to
about 5000 students and faculty at the University
of California campus here.
They were joined at the rally by United Farm
Workers President Cesar Chavez.
The three were booed repeatedly by a small
sign-waving group called "Concerned Ameri
cans," which chanted "Fonda Co Home."
Today's weather
Fair but windy through tomorrow. Lows in the
40s to low 50s. Highs in the 60s to low 70s. Small
