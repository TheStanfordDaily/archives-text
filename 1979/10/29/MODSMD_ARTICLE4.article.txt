### 
Seoul, South Korea â€” President
Park Chung-heeand live bodyguards
were gunned down deliberately in an
assassination planned and executed
by the head of the South Korean
Central Intelligence Agency (KCh\),
the South Korean government said
yesterday.
The ot tic ial report said KCIA chief
Kim lae-kyu killed Park Eriday night
because he was out of favor and
feared he would be fired. It did not
explain why the government first
thought that Kim killed the president
accidentally during an argument with
chiet presidential body guard Cha
Chishul.
"Kim was reprimanded by Park on
several occasions tor incompetence
in carrying out his duties. There was
recently talk of a reshuffle of top
posts. So Kim, worried about his
dismissal, committed the crime,"
chief investigator Gen. Chon
Doohwan told reporters. Efe said Kim
shot Park and Cha three times each
during a dinner at a KCIA building

500 yards from the presidential
palace.
By prior arrangement with Kim,
five KCIA agents waiting in an adjoin
ing room killed four presidential
bodyguards and seriously wounded
another as soon as they heard Kim's
shots, Chon said. Kim, his five agents
and many other KCIA agents have
been arrested and were being inter
rogated, Chon said.
The government has denied that
Kim planned a coup, and U.S. offi
cials in Seoul said, "We have not
seen the type of events normally as
sociated with a coup attempt, such as
mass arrests and seizure of com
munications facilities."
Despite apparent calm in the na
tion of 37 million, martial law con
tinued under acting President Choi
Kyu-hah, who was Park's prime
minister.
Close to 12,000 troops were posted
throughout the capital, the usual
midnight to 4 a.m. curfew was ex
panded to 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., unau
thorized public gatherings were
prohibited and the news media were
under military censorship.
Korean sources predicted a lead
ership crisis following the death (if
Park, who left no clear successor and
tolerated no political rivals after he
took power in a military coup on May
16,1961.
But even leaders opposed to Park's
authoritarian regime publicly
mourned him and warned Com
munist North Korea to take no bel
ligerent action during a possible
leadership crisis.
"I warn North Korea not to take
advantage of the current situation as
the entire people's voice is united
against the Communists, transcend
ing political differences," said dissi
dent politician Kim Dae-jung in a
statement read by a Seoul radio sta
tion.
"We must avoid any internal ion
fusion. However, the current dif
ficulties can be solved only through
restoration of a democratic system.
Only a democratic government can
strongly ensure the happiness of the
people by winning their support and
cooperation," he said.
Kim Dae-jung, a vehement gov
ernment critic who had been jailed
by Park for three years and remained
under house arrest after his release
in December.
Thousands of South Koreans lined
up at public altars set up in the capital
and throughout the nation to pray
and burn incense for the late presi
dent.
Opposition leader Kim Young-sam
joined acting president Choi and
other government officials paying
last respects to Park, lying in state at
the official Blue House residence.
Park will be buried next Saturday in
Seoul's national cemetary alongside
his wife, killed in a 1974 attempt on
the president's life.
The U.S. military commander in
South Korea, Gen. |ohn Wickham,
met top South Korean defense offi
cials yesterday to reiterate American
support.
Wickham later said joint U.S.-
South Korean forces were "adequate
to meet any possible requirement
that may develop" and were "pre
pared to defend the Republic of
Korea under any circumstances."
