## '20s prosperity, 'Black Tuesday' recalled 
### 
New York (AP) —American lite was
everything new — a carnival of fast
cars and faster money, speakeasies,
radio, lipstick and people who sat on
flagpoles.
It was that great year, 1929, and fhe
old American dream of boundless
prosperity shone brighter than ever
before.
But 50 years ago today, the Great
Crash on Wall Street sadly exposed
that vision as a bathtub gin mirage.
The archetypical American of the
'20s had been Charles Lingbergh, fly
ing the Atlantic to world acclaim and
a $25,000 prize.
The symbolic figure of the 1930s
was to be an anonymous vendor on a
cold street corner selling apples tor a
nickel apiece.
In the popular memory, the pivotal
date of that riches-to-rags transfor
mation was Black Tuesday, Oct. 29,
1929, when Wall Street was in the
midst of the severest market decline
in its history.
"Selling began as soon as the mar
ket opened and in huge volume,"
wrote John Kenneth Cialbraith in his
book The Great Crash 1929.
"Repeatedly and in many issues

there was a plethora of selling orders
and no buyers at all."

The crash wiped out fortunes,
large and small, faster than the New
York Stock Exchange ticker tape,
running two and a half hours late,
could record the damage.
Sequence of events
For all its hysteria, though, Black
Tuesday was just one in a long sequ
ence of events that ushered in the
decade-long Depression of the
19305.
Most observers looking back today
agree that the Roaring '20s, with their
rampant optimism, had sown the
seeds for the crash by encouraging
wild stock market speculation on
borrowed money.
The mood expressed by President
Calvin Coolidge, who declared in a
Dec. 4, 1928, message to Congress:
"No Congress of the United States
ever assembled, on surveying the
state of the Union, has met with a
more pleasing prospnct than that
which appears at the present time."
Farly the following September, as
Wall Street went back to work afteia
sultry Labor Day weekend, stock
prices stood at an all-time hich.

On Sept. 5, a Wellesley, Mass. z
economist named Roger Babson,
known as something of a maverick,
caused a brief scare in the markets by
forecasting both a "crash" and a
"serious business depression."
More conventional experts of the
time dismissed him as a perpetual
dealer in gloom and doom. As it
turned out, he was all too accurate.
In the next four years, $9 out of
every $10 in the stock market was
obliterated, and the unemployment
rate soared from 3.2 percent to 24.9
percent.
As the economy turned upside
down, many of the heroes and the
revered institutions of the prosper
ous days became the villains and the
scapegoats of the Depression.
Esteem to disgust
Business in general, and Wall
Street in particular, fell from a peak
of high social status to a point some
where between distrust and disgust.
In the eyes of some, American busi
ness never regained that high es
teem.
"In those days business was a very
honorable profession," recalls Ar
nold Bernhard, in 1929 a fledgling

security analyst and today the owner
of a company that operates the na
tion's largest investment advisory
service. "Today, if a business is pro
fitable, there seems to be something
obscene about it."
The collapse was equally hard on
the reputation of Herbert Hoover,
who succeeded Coolidge in the
White House less than a year before
the crash.
Beyond the simple fact that the
Depression struck during his tenure
of office, Hoover's image suffered
after the crash trom his futile efforts
to restore confidence by issuing up
beat economic forecasts that refused
to come true.
But Frederick lewis Allen, in the
1931 book, Only Yesterday, which
has come *o Ie regarded as a classic
of the period, argued that most of the
blame should g<,, not to Hoover, but
to economic forces that had been at
work for years.
"Doubtless the administration's
campaign of optimism had been
over/eaious," Allen said. "But Mr.
Hoover's greatest mistake had been
in getting himself elected for the
1928-32 term."
