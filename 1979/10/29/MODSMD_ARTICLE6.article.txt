## Park regime troubled U.S. 
### 
Washington (AP) — The au
thoritarian Park Chung-hee re
gime in South Korea gave the
Carter administration fits.
On the one hand, there was
U.S. admiration for the
enormous economic strides
achieved under Park's leader
ship. On the other, his stiff
security measures, throttling
the political opposition, were
viewed as excessive.
South Korea, under Park,
was a natural target of Presi
dent |immy Carter's human
rights campaign.

News analysis

The president's trip last
summer gave at least symbolic
support to his rule. However,
Carter also called for South
Korea to match its economic
strides with similar progress in
political and human rights.
There was a new crackdown
after he went home. A bloody
police raid on opposition party
headquarters Aug. 10 was an
unpleasant development for
the U.S. administration.
Carter initially planned a
wholesale cutback in U.S.
troops in South Korea. But ul

timately, he became convinced
they were needed as a coun
terweight to North Korean
forces. In July, he reversed
himself.
Opposition ousted
This month, the conflict be
tween U.S. security concerns
and respect for human rights
sharpened. Opposition leader
Kim Young Sam was ousted
from the National Assembly
and U.S. ambassador William
Cleysteen was recalled to
Washington for consultations.
The State Department ex
pressed regret about the
treatment of Kim, declaring it
to be "inconsistent with the
principles of democratic gov
ernment."
Kim was among those who
met with Carter in Seoul in
July.
However, Defense Secretary
Harold Brown went ahead with
a scheduled trip to South
Korea, assuring the Park gov
ernment that the United States
would act "promptly and deci
sively" if it is attacked by North
Korea.
Ambassador returned

Brown, returning to his post.

tion evidently had come down
on the side of security.
Some within the administra
tion were unhappy with the
decision. They felt Brown
should have canceled and sent
a lower-level Pentagon official
in his place. And Gleysteen's
return may have offset what
ever was gained by the ambas
sador's recall.
Park's repressions hurt
South Korea's image in his
country and, in the view of
some U.S. observers,
weakened American public
support for maintaining nearly
40,000 American servicemen
there.
Even more damaging,
perhaps, were revelations dur
ing the Ford administration
that the Korean Central Intelli
gence Agency had steadily ex
tended its reach in the United
States.
Agency officers operated
from the Korean embassy in
Washington and consulates
around the country, and Ko
rean diplomats attempted to
influence U.S. legislators with
offers of money and other
gifts.
