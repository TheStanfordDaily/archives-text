### Associated Press 
North Korea's ruling Communist Party on
Sunday condemned the late President Park
Chung-hee of South Korea and said his assassi
nation reflected a rapidly deepening political
crisis in that country.
The party's Rodong Shinmun newspaper cal
led Park "a truculent fascist dictator" who
"plunged South Korea into a sea of blood, ar
resting, imprisoning and brutally murdering
those. . . who called for the democratization of
society and the reunification of the country."
Park "fanned up war fever" and rejected "all
the fair and aboveboarc) policies and proposals
put forward by us for the independent and
peaceful reunification" of North and South
Korea, said the commentary, which was carried
by North Korea's official Central News Agency,
monitored in Tokyo.
Park, who the South Korean government said
was assassinated by the head of his nation's

Central Intelligence Agency, was a staunch
anti-Communist who opposed reunification on
North Korean terms.
Rodong Shinmun said rioting in South Korea
this month after the expulsion of a key opposi
tion leader from the National Assembly "seized
the puppet rulers with uneasiness and fear."
"The shooting of Park Chung-hee proves how
serious the political crisis and social disorder in
South Korea are," the commentary said.
In New York, Defense Secretary Harold
Brown reiterated the U.S. commitment to South
Korean security and said the United States, fol
lowing Friday's assassination, has sent two
sophisticated radar aircraft to South Korea and
moved an aircraft carrier closer to Korean wat
ers.
The Carter Administration placed the 38,000
U.S. troops in South Korea on alert hours atter
Park's death, and warned North Korea against
aggression during a possible leadership crisis.
