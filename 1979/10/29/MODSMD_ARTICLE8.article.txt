Despite evidence of wide
spread global human rights
violations, the United States
should focus upon South Af
rica as a particularly serious of
fender because ot its racial pol
icy, David Abernethy, profes
sor ot political science, said
here last Monday.
Speaking before an audi
ence of 50 persons at Memorial
Church, Aberneftiy said that
South Africa is in many re
spects "a uniquely bad human
rights violator, especially bad
among regimes on the right."
Civil and political liberties in
South Africa have been elimi
nated over time and replaced
with participation rights "in an
ultimately fraudulent scheme
of bantu stands whose bound
aries have been set without
consultation of (black) Afri
cans."
A unique feature in South Af
rica is the denial of nationality,
he said.
"South Africa is systemati
cally at the center of trying to
break itself up into many diffe
rent countries," without the
consultation of those blacks
who have wanted to remain
South Africans, just as the
whites.
The banning of various black

organizations and leaders
"undermines the free expres
sion of the majority of the
population," Abernethy said.
The lack and violation of these
rights is "particularly poig
nant" since black South Afri
cans may clearly see what they
are missing in white multi
party democracy, he added.
Yet South Africa clearly is not
in the same category as Cam
bodia, Paraguay or Uganda in
terms ol the percentage oi
population killed or tortured at
the government's behest.
"South Africa is evil because
it is efficiently repressive. It
does not need to resort, as
other regimes do, to that kind
of crude repression," Aber
nethy said.
South African law is
"schizophrenic," he said,
since some people may pos
sess "integrity ot the person's
rights" by virtue ol their skin
color, while others may not.
Compared to other African
nations, vital needs (health
care and education) are met re
latively well in South Africa. Yet
South Africans may be even
more dispossessed than
people in impoverished coun
tries such as Lesotho and
Mozambique, because of the
extreme inequities in income

distribution.
The world should attempt to
lessen the occurrence of
human rights violations in
South Africa, Abernethy said.
By reducing economic interac
tion, lor example, the present
government might be induced
to make reforms from above,
he said.
"There is a case of continu
ing to push tor withdrawal
from the country of firms
which are poor employers or
which produce items which
have a clear repressive poten
tial — oil, computers or au
tomobile firms," he said.
Sanctions leading to a possi
ble recession, however, might
not help blacks in relation to
whites, Abernethy warned.
Any unemployment would be
foisted on the black population
simply because the govern
ment would not tolerate white
unemployment over 1 percent.
"If we can act with a con
scious awareness that we must
continually avoid self
righteousness and that we will
be ready to change our tactics
it it turns out that the results of
our actions are counter
productive," then action in
South Africa and other nations
can be effective, he said.
