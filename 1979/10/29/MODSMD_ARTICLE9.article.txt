London (AP) — Britain, seek
ing to impress China ot its po
tential as an important trading
partner, welcomed Chinese
Premier Hua Guofeng Sunday
with a glittering display ot
pomp and calls for closer ties
with the Communist nation.
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher was at Heathrow Air
port when Hua stepped from
the blue and white jet onto a
red carpet rolled out on the
tarmac. He arrived in London
from Munich, West Germany,
for a week of talks on the third
leg of his four-nation tour of
Western Europe.
Queen Elizabeth It's Lord in
Waiting, who holds three titles
— Lord Mowbray, Segrave and

Stourton — also was there
along with an honor contin
gent from the Coldstrear
Guards armed forces unit. Th<
battalion's band played th<
Chinese national anthem.
A limousine motorcade es
corted by police outriders car
ried Hua into the city to th
venerable Claridge's Hotel
where he got a "dragon's wel
come" from London's Chinest
community.
Big fabric dragons undulatet
in colorful patterns as Hui
waved and "smiled at tht
Chinese, and at the Britons
who joined in greeting him.
At the airport reception,
Thatcher told Hua his visit is a
unique event, the first to Bri
tain by a premier of the
People's Republic of China.
"China is a great and historic
nation which has a crucial role
to play in world affairs and we
attach great importance to our
bilateral relations," she said.
Hua said his visit "represents
a new stage of closer ties bet
ween China and Britain . . .
There is much common
ground between China and
Britain on a large number of
international issues."
Britain's Trade and Industry
Department and British
businessmen are eager to
sound out the visiting Chinese,
particularly powerful Vice
Premier and economic planner
Yu Quili, on the recent slow
down in China's development
plans.
Britain ranks only ninth
among China's trading
partners, but had great expec
tations from an economic
cooperation agreement signed
in March, which envisioned
last year's level of $425 million
in bilateral trade expanding to
a cumulative $14 billion in the
next six years. Businessmen
say contracts so far have fallen
short of that level.
Talks with Thatcher and
members of her government
are expected to touch on the
controversial proposed
Chinese purchase of 80 to 90
British-made Harrier vertical
takeoff fighters.
