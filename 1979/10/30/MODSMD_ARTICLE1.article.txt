# Town funds fireman's care

"There was simply no one else to
turn to."
Fhis was the foremost thought in
fireman Frank Kelley's mind when he
approached the residents of his
home town of Framingham, Mass.,
tor money to finance his possible
heart transplant at the Medical
Center. Neither Medicare nor Kel
ley's private insurance policy would
cover any of the cost of such an oper
ation.
Kelley is currently undergoing ten
days of tests at the Medical Center to
determine his potential as a heart
transplant patient.
Framingham citizens voted 104-13
at a town meeting to donate $60,000
toward Kelley's medical expenses.
Fhe now-retired firetighter had
based his plea tor municipal aid on
the city's heart-lung law, which al
lows fire and police workers to re
ciuest monetary relief for job-related
disabilities.
The meeting's decision was an
nounced amid loud applause. "It
was really wonderful hearing all the
hurrahs," recalled Kelley's wife, Eve
lyn.
A Framingham fundraising drive
contributed another $77,000 to Kel
ley's cause, but $WJ,OOO more will be
necessary to cover the testing,

surgery and recovery costs should he
be one of around 40 people to qualify
for a heart transplant at the Medical
Center this year.
Surprise attack
At 3 o'clock in the morning July 9,
1978, Kelley awoke in the Framin
gham firehouse with severe chest
pains. This was the first of two heart
attacks 39-year-old Kelley would suf
fer before he was forced to retire
after fifteen years of service.
Kelley hardly looks like a man in
need of a heart transplant. Nor does
he look like the father of five children
who range in age from 10 to 20 years
old. Thus, it came as a surprise when
the seemingly healthy Kelley had his
first attack.
The money donated by the resi
dents of Framingham served as a
launching mechanism for the Kel
leys. They boarded a flight to San
Francisco and have since experi
enced a whirlwind of activities.
Fanfare welcome
Upon arrival, they were greeted by
lony Spitaleri, head of the Palo Alto
firefighters union, and 25 different
television and news reporters.
Spitaleri escorted the Kelleys to a
Palo Alto hotel where they will stay
until other arrangements can be
made.
All hotel costs will be paid by the

union which will rent a home if the
Kelleys' stay is prolonged.
Also, "the union will pay the plane
fare so Kelleys five children can visit
him for Christmas," Spitaleri said.
"If it weren't for them, we'd be
nowhere," said Kelley in commenda
tion of the people of Framingham
and the union here.
The Kelleys have also received
hundreds of letters from well
wishers all over the world.
"Everyone has been so good to us.
We've had nothing but positive sup
port," said Mrs. Kelley.
Faith supports
Always a loving family, according
to Mrs. Kelley, they have grown still
closerand credit their faith as a major
stabilizing factor. "It you didn't have
faith there'd be no other way out of
it," Kelley said.
"We've been married 21 years.
You think you have it made. The kids
are almost grown, things are finally
settling down, and then it hits you,"
Mrs. Kelley explained.
"I will never live for my future
again. You have to take each day one
at a time and enjoy it for the beauty it
is," she emphasized.
Contributions to Kelley may be
sent to: Frank Kelley Heart Fund, c o
Palo Alto Firefighters, 711 Serra St.,
Stanford, Ca. 94305.


Fred and Evelyn Kelley are happy to be in Palo Alto. This
summer, Kelley's hometown in Massachusetts voted to
send the ex-fireman here for tests to find if he can undergo

a heart transplant. The Palo Alto firefighters are attempt
ins to raise money to help pay for the operation.
