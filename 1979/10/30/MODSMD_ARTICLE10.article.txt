Los Angeles (AP) — Some
good news may < ome from the
destriu tion wrought by an ear
thquake that rocked the Impe
rial Valley this month: It may
teach engineers and officials
how to reduce the damage
from future tremors.
Scientific instruments previ
ously scattered over the valley
should help explain why some
buildings such as Imperial
County's six-story General
Services Building and scores of
mobile homes — were
wrecked by the Oct. 15 quake,
while others escaped with little
or no damage.
And"from a scientific view
point, this could bean extraor
dinarily important ear
thquake," said Robert Olson,
executive director of Califor
nia's Seismic Safety Commis
sion. "It occurred in one of the
most heavily instrumented
areas in the country, it not the
world.''
Scientists were obviously de
lighted that dozens of perma
nent instruments were already
in place when the quake jolted
across the Southern California
desert.
Although they say the read
ings made before, during and
after the quake aren't likely to
produce dramatic break
throughs in earthquake predic
tion, they should add impor
tant new pieces to the predic -
tion puzzle.
And Olsen said some ot the
most important results will
probably come from strong
motion instruments that mea
sure the type and power ot
ground movements caused by
the earthquake.
" I his should give us a much
better understanding of
ground shaking and the sub

sequent effects on buildings''
and lead to improved en
gineering and design stan
dards, he said.
One especially valuable in
strument was inside the Gen
eral Services Building, which
has been described as a total
loss that will cost $7 million to
replace. The building, the
largest structure in El Centro,
sagged ominously at one end
when supporting pillars were
damaged.
"That building," Olson said,
"is the kind ot thing that will be
studied in great detail to tind
out just what went wrong —
whether it was a problem ot
design or building codes or
construction or what."
Instruments inside the build
ing, he said, "will let us take a
look at exactly what happened
in that building and why it
tailed. That will probably be
one ot the most significant
findings."
Olson also noted the exten
sive damaue suffered by

mobile homes throughout the
valley — a problem that be
comes increasingly apparent
with each earthquake. Al
though wood-trame homes —
"about the least hazardous ot
any structure" — flex and sway
with little damage, mobile
homes are often wrecked in
tairly mild tremors.
He said damage usually
comes when the trailers are
shaken off the jacks that sup
port them — "It literally pulls
the rug out Irom under them."
Ihe mobile home resi
dent, Olson said, "is not re
ceiving equal protection as
those oi us who live in wood
trame dwellings . . . and we're
trying to figure out what to do
about it."
He said the commission has
lor several years been working
on design standards tor mobile
homes and trying to find ettec
tive ways to brace or anchor
them against earthquakes.
"It's a big void and we're try
ing to till it," Olson said.
