# Aikido class becomes way of life
## 
### Greg Dahlen 
In sunlight that filters down
trom the windows high in En
cina gym, a practitioner ot the
Japanese art ot aikido stands
surrounded by three would-be
attackers, all armed with thick,
heavy poles. A moment later,
he has slipped through a gap
between two ot his assailants
and stands ready for a possible
second assault.
Aikido was born after the
first World War. Its father,
Morihei Uyeshiba devoted
many years to the study of the
martial arts, and became one of
its greatest masters.
As a spiritually-inclined man,
however, he was increasingly
troubled by the competitive
victories propounded by the
martial arts. He believed that
true selt-detense lay in over
coming the discord within
oneself.
More than a martial art,
Uyeshiba's aikido was a way of
existing. Hence it was named
aikido, "a way of harmony with
the spirit of the universe."
Each session begins with an
exchange of bows between the
students and the teacher,
Frank Doran. Optimally, Doran
said, the bow is more than a
torm, but an acknowledge
ment of the respect that must
exist on both sides ol the
student-teacher relationship.
After a series of warmup and
stretching exercises, Doran
leads practice of the
techniques. The 50 or so in (he
kneel in a ring on the
edge ol the mat while Doran
demonstrates a technique. At a
handclap they group in pairs,
hurry to a place on the mat and
practice for two or three mi
nutes, then return to the edge.
With the students choosing
new partners and practicing
different techniques, the pro
cess is repeated with varia
tions.

Doran speaks briefly of the
principles underlying a given
exercise. He explains the
equilibrium ot tension and re
laxation, a kind of natural
rhythm, that is manifest in the
movements.
These originate from the
center of the body, he exp
lains, and generally take form
in spiraling or circling motions
that emulate their abundant
counterparts in nature.
"Look at nature and you will
see its energies in circular
forms: the way water flows
around a rock, or the revolu
tion of the planets," Doran
said. "Contrast that with the
linearity ot man's skyline, or
the lines ot a treeway. Aikido
attempts to relate each of its
movements toones in nature."
Instead of trying to block
force, or respond with force,
according to Doian the
aikidois* aims to rendei the
force ineffectual by guiding it
away where it can do no harm.
The aikidoist will, ior example,
pivot trom a punch, quickly
clutch the assailant's wrist, and
push the fist toward empty air.
To neutralize force instead
of destroying it is not easy.
One student likened it to tak
ing apart a watch. A person can
either smash the watch, which
is easy to do but destructive, or
can with diligence learn the
skill ol taking apart and reas
sembling the watch, leaving it
intact and able to continue
functioning.
Aikido demands the c are and
skill required by the latter
route. "Once in a while there
come times ol effortlessness,
ol freedom that is beautiful and
indescribable in words," one
student said.
David Brown, cotounder ol
the Stanford Aikido Club and
holder ol a second-degree
black belt, spoke 01 the
aikidoist's quest lor resolution
ol conflict through "blending"

with a potentially harmtul situ
ation, instead of struggling in
counterproductive opposition
to it.
"One ot the very basic prin
ciples of aikido is to learn to
blend with the direction ol at
tack, to be free within so as to
be able to adapt and blend with
the world around, with nature
and our tellow man. We act de
spotically against man and na
ture only at our own peril;
whatever we put out eventually
comes back," said Brown.
"We attempt in aikido to
work in the spirit of love and
harmony, believing that that
can dissipate conflict . . . the
truest training takes place in
side," he said.
Aikidoists insist (hat the art's
most important lessons are
given outside the gymnasium.

They maintain that it is in apply
ing the principles ot aikido to
their daily lives that they re
ceive their severest and most
satisfying test.
"It can be something very
simple," said one student.
"I'm driving on the freeway,
and some guy starts to tailgate
me. I can either say 'I'm not
going to let that SOB go by me,'
or I can move over and let him
pass."
At the end ol the session, the
students and teacher again
bow to each other and then, in
' gratitude, to a portrait ol the
art's founder. They gather in a
circle to quietly exchange a few
minutes of conversation.
Then, as they break up and
dritt oft, there is tinal bow to
, the gymnasium itself. They exit
■ and begin the truest applica
tion ol their art.

Instead of trying to bloc k force, or respond with force, the aikidoist
tries to render force ineffective !>y Kiiidin>> it out of harm's way.
In sunlight that filters down
trom the windows high in En
cina gym, a practitioner ot the
Japanese art ot aikido stands
surrounded by three would-be
attackers, all armed with thick,
heavy poles. A moment later,
he has slipped through a gap
between two ot his assailants
and stands ready for a possible
second assault.
Aikido was born after the
first World War. Its father,
Morihei Uyeshiba devoted
many years to the study of the
martial arts, and became one of
its greatest masters.
As a spiritually-inclined man,
however, he was increasingly
troubled by the competitive
victories propounded by the
martial arts. He believed that
true selt-detense lay in over
coming the discord within
oneself.
More than a martial art,
Uyeshiba's aikido was a way of
existing. Hence it was named
aikido, "a way of harmony with
the spirit of the universe."
Each session begins with an
exchange of bows between the
students and the teacher,
Frank Doran. Optimally, Doran
said, the bow is more than a
torm, but an acknowledge
ment of the respect that must
exist on both sides ol the
student-teacher relationship.
After a series of warmup and
stretching exercises, Doran
leads practice of the
techniques. The 50 or so in (he
kneel in a ring on the
edge ol the mat while Doran
demonstrates a technique. At a
handclap they group in pairs,
hurry to a place on the mat and
practice for two or three mi
nutes, then return to the edge.
With the students choosing
new partners and practicing
different techniques, the pro
cess is repeated with varia
tions.

Doran speaks briefly of the
principles underlying a given
exercise. He explains the
equilibrium ot tension and re
laxation, a kind of natural
rhythm, that is manifest in the
movements.
These originate from the
center of the body, he exp
lains, and generally take form
in spiraling or circling motions
that emulate their abundant
counterparts in nature.
"Look at nature and you will
see its energies in circular
forms: the way water flows
around a rock, or the revolu
tion of the planets," Doran
said. "Contrast that with the
linearity ot man's skyline, or
the lines ot a treeway. Aikido
attempts to relate each of its
movements toones in nature."
Instead of trying to block
force, or respond with force,
according to Doian the
aikidois* aims to rendei the
force ineffectual by guiding it
away where it can do no harm.
The aikidoist will, ior example,
pivot trom a punch, quickly
clutch the assailant's wrist, and
push the fist toward empty air.
To neutralize force instead
of destroying it is not easy.
One student likened it to tak
ing apart a watch. A person can
either smash the watch, which
is easy to do but destructive, or
can with diligence learn the
skill ol taking apart and reas
sembling the watch, leaving it
intact and able to continue
functioning.
Aikido demands the c are and
skill required by the latter
route. "Once in a while there
come times ol effortlessness,
ol freedom that is beautiful and
indescribable in words," one
student said.
David Brown, cotounder ol
the Stanford Aikido Club and
holder ol a second-degree
black belt, spoke 01 the
aikidoist's quest lor resolution
ol conflict through "blending"

with a potentially harmtul situ
ation, instead of struggling in
counterproductive opposition
to it.
"One ot the very basic prin
ciples of aikido is to learn to
blend with the direction ol at
tack, to be free within so as to
be able to adapt and blend with
the world around, with nature
and our tellow man. We act de
spotically against man and na
ture only at our own peril;
whatever we put out eventually
comes back," said Brown.
"We attempt in aikido to
work in the spirit of love and
harmony, believing that that
can dissipate conflict . . . the
truest training takes place in
side," he said.
Aikidoists insist (hat the art's
most important lessons are
given outside the gymnasium.

They maintain that it is in apply
ing the principles ot aikido to
their daily lives that they re
ceive their severest and most
satisfying test.
"It can be something very
simple," said one student.
"I'm driving on the freeway,
and some guy starts to tailgate
me. I can either say 'I'm not
going to let that SOB go by me,'
or I can move over and let him
pass."
At the end ol the session, the
students and teacher again
bow to each other and then, in
' gratitude, to a portrait ol the
art's founder. They gather in a
circle to quietly exchange a few
minutes of conversation.
Then, as they break up and
dritt oft, there is tinal bow to
, the gymnasium itself. They exit
■ and begin the truest applica
tion ol their art.
