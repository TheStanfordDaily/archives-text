## Cuba a truer democracy 
### 
"Socialism itself is an injuri
ous insult to any person who
respects individual liberty and
values the sanctity of human
dignity." That is what Gary Bar
ton and Brian Farr said in their
discussion ot Cuba (Daily, Oct.
22).
To see it this is true, let us
look at Cuba before the revolu
tion. Then let us compare my
liberty as a working woman
here with that of a Cuban
woman today.
Cuba before the revolution
Simply put, the United States
owned most of Cuba: most of
the fertile land, the sugar, zinc
and copper mines, oil, banks,
phones,utilities, casinos and
even the baseball players. Sci
entifically put, Cuba's
economy was foreign
controlled monopoly
capitalism.
As a result of this economy,
25 percent of the population
was unemployed and 5 million
out of 6 million people did not
own their own houses. In the
rural area 43 percent of the
people were illiterate, while
most had no land and no heal
thcare.
In the cities, 15 thousand
women were prostitutes —
mostly for American
businessmen.
Arthur Schlesinger, advisor
to President )ohn Kennedy de
scribed Hdvana as follows:
"My fellow countrymen reeled
through the streets, picking up
tourteen-year-old Cuban girls
and tossing coins to make men
scramble in the gutter." This is
dignity?
Cuba after the revolution
The extra houses of the weal
thy were taken from them and
given to those with no houses.
Everyone who rented an
apartment or house became
the owners ol them, although
they continued to pay rent to
the landlords for 5 to 10 years.
Rents became 10 percent of in
come and phones became
free.
Hospitals were built in the
rural area, medical care be
came tree and infant mortality
rate was reduced io 22 per 1000
births.
By 1968, seven thousand new
schools were built, all levels of
education became free and il
literacy was reduced to three
percent.
Land was taken from U.S.
corporations and from U.S.
plantation owners, and given
to those with no land.
Prostitution was virtually
eliminated through full
employment, re-training for
the women, free childcare and
equal p.n — the most exten-

sive social reform in any
capitalist country).
And most delightfully,
women joggers are unlikely to
be attacked in Havana.
My liberties here
Now, let's look at my liberty
here. I am a woman who has
worked for 21 years.
1) Unlike the Cuban woman,
every night I jog after work. I
wonder whether I am going to
live or die — for exercising my
right to go out at night.
2)Unlike the Cuban woman,
I am economically punished if I
have a child.Childcare costs
will take one-third to one
fourth of my pay which is al
ready too low to pay the rent.
3) Unlike the Cuban woman,
I can be ruined by medical
costs, I can be laid off from
my job, and then, because I
can't pay the rent, I can be
evicted from my home. This is
liberty?
Economic democracy
Now all of this is not to say
the Cuban woman lives in a
paradise compared to me.
Cuba has many problems.
It does not have the material
wealth that imperialism has
generated for the United
States.
When medicine was
socialized 2500 out of 7200 doc
tors left for greener pastu res as
did many other high paid pro
fessionals. Counter
revolutionaries have been
dealt with harshly.
And finally, equality for
women has a long way to go.
Only recently was a law finally
passed which makes husbands
of working women legally re
sponsible for half of the
housework.
In spite of these problems, in
those areas of life most impor
tant to me — the right not to be
attacked, the right to a roof
over my head, to a job, the
right to childcare and the right
to medical security — the
Cuban woman has a freedom I
do not have. This is because
she has economic democracy
and I do not.
Bourgeois democracy
In this country the bottom 60
percent of the population
shares eight percent of the na
tic n's wealth. The top one per
cent gets 33 percent of the
wealth and the top two percent
owns close to half. What we
have here is not economic
democracy, but bourgeois
democracy.
This means that I get to vote
for jimmy Carter or Ted Ken
nedy or any other representa
tive of that small percentage of
people who own and control
most of everything worth own-

ing and controlling, including
the industries that run the
country and the media that
shape our opinions.
Besides this kind of electoral
right, I have other bourgeois
liberties the Cuban woman
would be imprisoned for trying
to exercise. I can be a landlord
and evict tenants, I can be a
doctor and I can promote
counter-revolution.
In fact I can say or do almost
anything that does not seri
ously threaten the property
rights of that two percent.
Yet everytime that workers
have seriously threatened
those propety rights, either in
elections, as in Chile, or in the
streets, as in 1930 Germany,
those bourgeois liberties (in
cluding the right to vote) have
been snatched away until "or
der" has been restored.
In other words, in this coun
try I have bourgeois democ
racy if it is not a threat to the
bourgeoisie. We have
economic democracy not at all.
In 1960, one million Cubans
went to the People's National
Assembly in Havana and voted
to endorse this statement:
"...Democracy is incompatible
with financial oligarchy..." In
my opinion, liberty and human
dignity are also incompatible
with financial oligarchy.
