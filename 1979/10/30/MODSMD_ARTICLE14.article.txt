Women were not meant to
run; they feel that they may be
overtaken. Running is not the
only thing they do ill, but it is
the only thing they do awk
wardly; their elbows glued to
their sides and pointed back
wards look ridiculous, and the
high heels on which they are
perched make them look like
so many grasshoppers trying to
run instead of to jump.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau
Emile. Book V.
While conducting a personal
survey of women's literature, I
chanced upon a provocative
looking book, Getting Strong,
by Kathryn Lance. On the jac
ket was this thin yet muscular
woman with a crewcut, sur
rounded by various athletic
paraphernalia, who looked as
if she'd as soon punch you out
as talk to you. At last I
thought, a serious book on the
subject.
To my dismay, she was guilty
of the same double-standard
that thwarts athletic-minded
women everywhere. While ad

vocating "serious" weight
training, Lance tells women to
substitute "things you have
around the house," — like 16
oz. cans of corn or tomato juice
— for a pair of inexpensive
dumbbells. Can you imagine a
man who decided to get into
shape starting off by "pumping
tomato juice?"
This light-hearted low
pressure attitude towards
women and training was iden
tical to the one I encountered
throughout grade school and
high school.
While I was on exercise mats
learning how to be "lithe and
graceful," my male classmates
were learning how to strain
and challenge themselves on
the track or basketball court.
"If it hurts, stop," girls were
told.
According to sociologist
Kathleen Barry, "Surviving and
the strength forsurvival are not
written into the code of
socialized female behavior.
Girls do not go to boot camp or
battle it out on the football

field and in the locker room.
Instead, girls' socialization as
sumes a life where they will not
need survival skills; husband
replaces father as protector;
life is seen in terms of being,
not doing."
Barry's point is an important
one, although I don't think
women need boot camp or
football to become strong and
independent.
Because of their lack of
strength and self-confidence,
women are handicapped in
many areas of their lives.
Not only are we less effective
in the sports we choose to par
ticipate in, but we feel, andare,
more vulnerable in terms of
the activities of daily living —
like walking the streets alone.
Obviously, I'm making a
case for women to increase
mental confidence and well
being by becoming more phys
ically active. "Getting strong"
doesn't mean looking like an
East German swimmer. If a
woman embarked upon the
same weight-training regimen

as a man, her muscle mass
would increase only one-tenth
as much as his because of hor
monal differences. (What
normally happens is that fat is
replaced by taut muscle, not
bulk.)
Weight training is only one
method of tackling the prob
lem. Running and other sports
in which the goal is maximum
physical exertion are also ex
cellent.
What's important for women
is to learn that pain, and push
ing oneself to do that extra mile
or pool lap, are inherent in any
serious effort to better one's
strength and ability.
There's a certain elation and
pride in realizing that you can
make yourself overcome the
discomfort or psychological
rationalizations that have
hampered you in the past.
Learning to be "aggressive"
is often difficult for women
who have the inertia and in
grained passivity of a lifetime
to overcome.
For men, being aggressive
on the athletic field has been a
long-standing way of releasing
tensions and frustrations.
If you've been sedentary for
most of your life, start out
slowly (but not with cans of
tomato juice). Take a class on
conditioning or weight
training or self-defense and
stick with it.
Realize that only you can
apply pressure to yourself, and
all the support and words of
encouragement from friends
aren't going to help you make
it up that last hill.
If you sufficiently challenge
yourself, and realizeyourphys
ical potential, increased self
confidence will be one of the
benefits.
Despite Aristotle's allegation
that, "Physical work clogs the
mind; and mental work ham
pers the body," I find that
physical fitness increases my
mental well-being and alert
ness.
If you're going to be "liber
ated," be independent physi
cally, as well as psychologi
cally. The two cannot be sepa
rated successfully.
