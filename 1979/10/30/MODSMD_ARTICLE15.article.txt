Teller at issue
As one who recognized
Hoover Fellow Edward Teller as
one of the most highly qual
ified physicists in the country, I
was disappointed by his shal
low analysis of the anti-nuclear
movement (Daily, Oct. 25).
In the interview, Teller ac
cused the anti-nuclear move
ment of relying on scare tactics
rather than fact. The truth is the
facts about nuclear power are
frightening.
Teller claimed that "nobody
has yet been hurt by a big regu
lated industrial reactor."
Vet, because the nuclear
power industry is fairly young,
we do not yet know all of the
long-range effects that it will
have on our lives.
It is a fact that many
radiation-induced cancers do
not appear for 10 to 20 years
after the initial exposure.
The experts differ in their
opinions. Radiological physi
cist Ernest Sternglass reports
that the Three Mile Island acci
dent may have exposed about a
million people to up to 130
times more radiation than has
been reported.
He estimates that an addi
tional 300 to 2500 people could
develop lungcancer in the next
10 to 20 years, as a result of
their exposure to the accident.
In addition, we cannot pre
dict what health effects that
radiation will have on our chil
dren.
Teller presented no statistics
or facts, only unsupported
analogies and accusations. He
clearly dodged the question of
nuclear safety.
He chose instead to attack
individual personalities within
the anti-nuclear movement, a
reflection of his reluctance to
deal with the arguments at
hand on the f r merits.
Teller mistakenly believed
that )ane Fonda and Dr. Spock
are spokespeople for the anti
nuclear movement. In reality,
the anti-nuclear movement is a
grass roots organization, with a
decentralized leadership.
It consists of a people, young

and old, rich and poor, all un
ited by a common desire not to
be irradiated.
Most ironically, Teller at
tempts to link the anti-nuclear
movement to the )im Jones
sect in Guyana. The fallacy in
his reasoning is all too obvious.
The people in Guyana were
afraid to question authority —
even when their lives were in
danger. The people who are
opposed to a nuclear environ
ment are doing their question
ing before more lives are lost.
The anti-nuclear movement
is not an elite group. Everyone
is wanted and needed to help
to put an end to the spread of
nuclear power.
In addition, the highly
trained specialists, such as Tel
ler are needed to contribute to
a positive and constructive
dialogue about the future of
nuclear power.
Whether for or against nuc
lear power, the issue should be
taken seriously. It must be all
of us working together to save
our environment, and our
lives.

Clerical workers
The Daily has been doing a
good job of covering the Cof
fee House situation and
boycott. What I don't under
stand is why the Daily isn't also
covering the efforts of the of
fice staff at the University to
create a collective bargaining
unit.
By looking up the Daily arti
cles in July and August of this
last summer, you can garner
enough background informa
tion for an article.
Yet the Daily seems to be ig
noring this effort which affects
so many employees.
All students come into con
tact with clerical workers, who
are an essential base for all
University operation. But how
many students and faculty are
aware of the fact that many of
fice workers are having to hold
down extra jobs in order to
make ends meet?

Mike Hale's Daily interview
with Florence Miller last Au
gust sums up the situation of
office workers (most of whom
are women) very well.
The Office Staff Organizing
Committee has about 75 per
cent of the signatures needed
to petition the National Labor
Relations Board for a union
election.
This week, October 29 -
November 2, the Organizing
Committee is sponsoring an
action week to inform the Uni
versity community about the
situation of office staffers and
to collect the remaining signa
tures needed to file a strong
petition with the Labor Board.
Student support is wanted
and needed in this effort.
Those who wish to help can
contact the USE office. The

Organizing Committee hopes
to petition the Labor Board be
fore Thanksgiving. This is big
news for both employees and
students.
Why isn't the Daily covering
this drive?

Wrong attitude
Stacie Newman's letter
(Daily, Oct. 23) on my column
on sexism and language (Oct.
16) portrays a very important
attitude that I would rather not
let slip by without comment.
First off, she says that "if
more women focused on
changing the attitudes of men
and the myths which per
petuate oppression of women,

the adoption of non-sexist lan
guage would follow naturally
with the enlightenment of
men."
In reducing language to an
effect of a cause, a "technical
ity," Newman ignores my point
that the use of language affects
attitudes and vice versa. We
can help change attitudes by
using non-sexist language now
around people who never
thought about the implications
of language before.
With so much change need
ing to happen, as she says, we
cannot isolate one area from
another; I have simply put em
phasis on an issue we should
all be aware of in an academic
environment. »
Furthermore, on her general
attitude: "the enlightenment
of men" will not happen with
out the enlightenment of wo
men.
Though feminism benefits
both sexes, it is the women —
of all classes, ages and colors
— who need to have power in
their lives, who need to over
come the rape, battery, end
less childbirths and other
forms of discrimination.
We demand from those men
in power (legislators, for
example) what we deserve as
basic rights (sometimes we
must "take them by storm" to
be heard); we ask support
from those men we love, and
for the changes they make, we
give support.
But in the end, let the men
learn from the women who
teach and help each other.

'Never again'
It is sad to see a man with the
brilliant talents of Edward Tel
ler, "Father of the hydrogen
bomb," committed to continu
ing intensive research for ever
more deadly weaponry and
warning us about the Russian
threat.
Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky,
equally gifted, had a saner vie
wpoint, I thought, arguing in
favor of Salt II at the Oct. 5

Stanford debate.
It seems a mockery to de
clare one side ahead when
each already has a great over
kill capacity. The very manufac
turing of these horror weapons
adds to the poisoning of the
earth.
In this "International Year of
the Child" are we concerned
about the welfare of all chil
dren ? Do we have a care for our
repressed minorities?
This month I received a re
port from the National Indian
Youth Council stating that their
people have been working in
the uranium mines for many
years without having been
warned of the danger. Now
♦hey are suffering the cancer
ous effects.
The water these Indians
drink, the air they breathe,
their houses are all radiocative.
The report said "Gulf Oil is
sinking the world's deepest
mine shaft into Mount Taylor,
one of the four sacred moun
tains of the Navajo people."
Are nuclear weapons or
power worth it? Albert Einstein,
who with others created the
atomic bomb, comprehended
the terrible threat to all human
ity. On Aug. 6,1947 he wrote to
a friend, "In the shadow of the
atomic bomb it has become
apparent that all men are
brothers."
Dare we call the Russians our
tolerable fellow inhabitants of
this small space ship Earth? Live
together or perish together is
our choice. After the twin hor
rors of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, we would-be
peacemakers say, "Never
again."

A life lost
We should realize that
human beings are being sys
tematically killed; and that
these unfortunate lives have
no way to fight for their human
rights.
We should realize that we

must be the voice of the voice
less, and, as the fight con
tinues, your concern, support
and awareness are needed.
Fight to show that human life
is human life.
The people of whom I speak
are those aborted infants that
Dawn Upchurch forgot to
mention in her column (Daily,
Oct. 17).
I disagree with Upchurch's
opinion that one human life is
greater, more precious, than
another.
She says at the beginning of
her column that, thanks to
"safe," legalized abortion, a
Stanford woman with an un
wanted pregnancy can "con
tinue life as planned" and
"continue academic pursuits
and career."
But this occurs at the ex
pense of other human lives —
other human lives that have no
choice on either their concep
tion or destruction.
A woman knows that there is
no infallible birth control
method apd she must realize
this before consummation.
This is where the choice lies.
She understands the con
sequences, and she chooses.
If, by chance, she does get
pregnant then the choice has
already been made — unless
murder has become the order
of our day.
Granted, this may lead to the
ruination of two lives, and
probably many more, but this
was her choice. It's all part of
the "game."
Here, I would like to explain
that I have not mentioned the
male role in this issue because
Upchurch failed to do the
same.
I would like to use a quote
from the editorial comment:
"Stanford women have the
freedom to choose abortion,
the freedom to control their
lives." And apparently, accord
ing to Upchurch and the Stan
ford Pro-Choice Alliance, they
have the freedom to create and
destroy.

after the initial exposure.
The experts differ in their
opinions. Radiological physi
cist Ernest Sternglass reports
that the Three Mile Island acci
dent may have exposed about a
million people to up to 130
times more radiation than has
been reported.
He estimates that an addi
tional 300 to 2500 people could
develop lungcancer in the next
10 to 20 years, as a result of
their exposure to the accident.
In addition, we cannot pre
dict what health effects that
radiation will have on our chil
dren.
Teller presented no statistics
or facts, only unsupported
analogies and accusations. He
clearly dodged the question of
nuclear safety.
He chose instead to attack
individual personalities within
the anti-nuclear movement, a
reflection of his reluctance to
deal with the arguments at
hand on the f r merits.
Teller mistakenly believed
that )ane Fonda and Dr. Spock
are spokespeople for the anti
nuclear movement. In reality,
the anti-nuclear movement is a
grass roots organization, with a
decentralized leadership.
It consists of a people, young

and old, rich and poor, all un
ited by a common desire not to
be irradiated.
Most ironically, Teller at
tempts to link the anti-nuclear
movement to the )im Jones
sect in Guyana. The fallacy in
his reasoning is all too obvious.
The people in Guyana were
afraid to question authority —
even when their lives were in
danger. The people who are
opposed to a nuclear environ
ment are doing their question
ing before more lives are lost.
The anti-nuclear movement
is not an elite group. Everyone
is wanted and needed to help
to put an end to the spread of
nuclear power.
In addition, the highly
trained specialists, such as Tel
ler are needed to contribute to
a positive and constructive
dialogue about the future of
nuclear power.
Whether for or against nuc
lear power, the issue should be
taken seriously. It must be all
of us working together to save
our environment, and our
lives.

The Daily has been doing a
good job of covering the Cof
fee House situation and

stand is why the Daily isn't also
covering the efforts of the of
fice staff at the University to
create a collective bargaining
unit.
By looking up the Daily arti

last summer, you can garner
enough background informa
tion for an article.
Yet the Daily seems to be ig
noring this effort which affects
so many employees.
All students come into con
tact with clerical workers, who
are an essential base for all
University operation. But how
many students and faculty are
aware of the fact that many of
fice workers are having to hold
down extra jobs in order to
make ends meet?

Mike Hale's Daily interview
with Florence Miller last Au
gust sums up the situation of
office workers (most of whom
are women) very well.
The Office Staff Organizing
Committee has about 75 per
cent of the signatures needed
to petition the National Labor
Relations Board for a union
election.
This week, October 29 -
November 2, the Organizing
Committee is sponsoring an
action week to inform the Uni
versity community about the
situation of office staffers and
to collect the remaining signa
tures needed to file a strong
petition with the Labor Board.
Student support is wanted
and needed in this effort.
Those who wish to help can
contact the USE office. The

Wrong attitude
Stacie Newman's letter
(Daily, Oct. 23) on my column
on sexism and language (Oct.
16) portrays a very important
attitude that I would rather not
let slip by without comment.
First off, she says that "if
more women focused on
changing the attitudes of men
and the myths which per
petuate oppression of women,

the adoption of non-sexist lan
guage would follow naturally
with the enlightenment of
men."
In reducing language to an
effect of a cause, a "technical
ity," Newman ignores my point
that the use of language affects
attitudes and vice versa. We
can help change attitudes by
using non-sexist language now
around people who never
thought about the implications
of language before.
With so much change need
ing to happen, as she says, we
cannot isolate one area from
another; I have simply put em
phasis on an issue we should
all be aware of in an academic
environment. »
Furthermore, on her general
attitude: "the enlightenment
of men" will not happen with
out the enlightenment of wo
men.
Though feminism benefits
both sexes, it is the women —
of all classes, ages and colors
— who need to have power in
their lives, who need to over
come the rape, battery, end
less childbirths and other
forms of discrimination.
We demand from those men
in power (legislators, for
example) what we deserve as
basic rights (sometimes we
must "take them by storm" to
be heard); we ask support
from those men we love, and
for the changes they make, we
give support.
But in the end, let the men
learn from the women who
teach and help each other.

'Never again'
It is sad to see a man with the
brilliant talents of Edward Tel
ler, "Father of the hydrogen
bomb," committed to continu
ing intensive research for ever
more deadly weaponry and
warning us about the Russian
threat.
Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky,
equally gifted, had a saner vie
wpoint, I thought, arguing in
favor of Salt II at the Oct. 5

Stanford debate.
It seems a mockery to de
clare one side ahead when
each already has a great over
kill capacity. The very manufac
turing of these horror weapons
adds to the poisoning of the
earth.
In this "International Year of
the Child" are we concerned
about the welfare of all chil
dren ? Do we have a care for our
repressed minorities?
This month I received a re
port from the National Indian
Youth Council stating that their
people have been working in
the uranium mines for many
years without having been
warned of the danger. Now
♦hey are suffering the cancer
ous effects.
The water these Indians
drink, the air they breathe,
their houses are all radiocative.
The report said "Gulf Oil is
sinking the world's deepest
mine shaft into Mount Taylor,
one of the four sacred moun
tains of the Navajo people."
Are nuclear weapons or
power worth it? Albert Einstein,
who with others created the
atomic bomb, comprehended
the terrible threat to all human
ity. On Aug. 6,1947 he wrote to
a friend, "In the shadow of the
atomic bomb it has become
apparent that all men are
brothers."
Dare we call the Russians our
tolerable fellow inhabitants of
this small space ship Earth? Live
together or perish together is
our choice. After the twin hor
rors of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, we would-be
peacemakers say, "Never
again."

A life lost
We should realize that
human beings are being sys
tematically killed; and that
these unfortunate lives have
no way to fight for their human
rights.
We should realize that we

must be the voice of the voice
less, and, as the fight con
tinues, your concern, support
and awareness are needed.
Fight to show that human life
is human life.
The people of whom I speak
are those aborted infants that
Dawn Upchurch forgot to
mention in her column (Daily,
Oct. 17).
I disagree with Upchurch's
opinion that one human life is
greater, more precious, than
another.
She says at the beginning of
her column that, thanks to
"safe," legalized abortion, a
Stanford woman with an un
wanted pregnancy can "con
tinue life as planned" and
"continue academic pursuits
and career."
But this occurs at the ex
pense of other human lives —
other human lives that have no
choice on either their concep
tion or destruction.
A woman knows that there is
no infallible birth control
method apd she must realize
this before consummation.
This is where the choice lies.
She understands the con
sequences, and she chooses.
If, by chance, she does get
pregnant then the choice has
already been made — unless
murder has become the order
of our day.
Granted, this may lead to the
ruination of two lives, and
probably many more, but this
was her choice. It's all part of
the "game."
Here, I would like to explain
that I have not mentioned the
male role in this issue because
Upchurch failed to do the
same.
I would like to use a quote
from the editorial comment:
"Stanford women have the
freedom to choose abortion,
the freedom to control their
lives." And apparently, accord
ing to Upchurch and the Stan
ford Pro-Choice Alliance, they
have the freedom to create and
destroy.

Teller mistakenly believed
that )ane Fonda and Dr. Spock
are spokespeople for the anti
nuclear movement. In reality,
the anti-nuclear movement is a
grass roots organization, with a
decentralized leadership.
It consists of a people, young

and old, rich and poor, all un
ited by a common desire not to
be irradiated.
Most ironically, Teller at
tempts to link the anti-nuclear
movement to the )im Jones
sect in Guyana. The fallacy in
his reasoning is all too obvious.
The people in Guyana were
afraid to question authority —
even when their lives were in
danger. The people who are
opposed to a nuclear environ
ment are doing their question
ing before more lives are lost.
The anti-nuclear movement
is not an elite group. Everyone
is wanted and needed to help
to put an end to the spread of
nuclear power.
In addition, the highly
trained specialists, such as Tel
ler are needed to contribute to
a positive and constructive
dialogue about the future of
nuclear power.
Whether for or against nuc
lear power, the issue should be
taken seriously. It must be all
of us working together to save
our environment, and our
lives.

Clerical workers
The Daily has been doing a
good job of covering the Cof
fee House situation and
boycott. What I don't under
stand is why the Daily isn't also
covering the efforts of the of
fice staff at the University to
create a collective bargaining
unit.
By looking up the Daily arti
cles in July and August of this
last summer, you can garner
enough background informa
tion for an article.
Yet the Daily seems to be ig
noring this effort which affects
so many employees.
All students come into con
tact with clerical workers, who
are an essential base for all
University operation. But how
many students and faculty are
aware of the fact that many of
fice workers are having to hold
down extra jobs in order to
make ends meet?

Mike Hale's Daily interview
with Florence Miller last Au
gust sums up the situation of
office workers (most of whom
are women) very well.
The Office Staff Organizing
Committee has about 75 per
cent of the signatures needed
to petition the National Labor
Relations Board for a union
election.
This week, October 29 -
November 2, the Organizing
Committee is sponsoring an
action week to inform the Uni
versity community about the
situation of office staffers and
to collect the remaining signa
tures needed to file a strong
petition with the Labor Board.
Student support is wanted
and needed in this effort.
Those who wish to help can
contact the USE office. The

Organizing Committee hopes

Wrong attitude
Stacie Newman's letter
(Daily, Oct. 23) on my column
on sexism and language (Oct.
16) portrays a very important
attitude that I would rather not
let slip by without comment.
First off, she says that "if
more women focused on
changing the attitudes of men
and the myths which per
petuate oppression of women,

the adoption of non-sexist lan
guage would follow naturally
with the enlightenment of
men."
In reducing language to an
effect of a cause, a "technical
ity," Newman ignores my point
that the use of language affects
attitudes and vice versa. We
can help change attitudes by
using non-sexist language now
around people who never
thought about the implications
of language before.
With so much change need
ing to happen, as she says, we
cannot isolate one area from
another; I have simply put em
phasis on an issue we should
all be aware of in an academic
environment. »
Furthermore, on her general
attitude: "the enlightenment
of men" will not happen with
out the enlightenment of wo
men.
Though feminism benefits
both sexes, it is the women —
of all classes, ages and colors
— who need to have power in
their lives, who need to over
come the rape, battery, end
less childbirths and other
forms of discrimination.
We demand from those men
in power (legislators, for
example) what we deserve as
basic rights (sometimes we
must "take them by storm" to
be heard); we ask support
from those men we love, and
for the changes they make, we
give support.
But in the end, let the men
learn from the women who
teach and help each other.

'Never again'
It is sad to see a man with the
brilliant talents of Edward Tel
ler, "Father of the hydrogen
bomb," committed to continu
ing intensive research for ever
more deadly weaponry and
warning us about the Russian
threat.
Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky,
equally gifted, had a saner vie
wpoint, I thought, arguing in
favor of Salt II at the Oct. 5

Stanford debate.
It seems a mockery to de
clare one side ahead when
each already has a great over
kill capacity. The very manufac
turing of these horror weapons
adds to the poisoning of the
earth.
In this "International Year of
the Child" are we concerned
about the welfare of all chil
dren ? Do we have a care for our
repressed minorities?
This month I received a re
port from the National Indian
Youth Council stating that their
people have been working in
the uranium mines for many
years without having been
warned of the danger. Now
♦hey are suffering the cancer
ous effects.
The water these Indians
drink, the air they breathe,
their houses are all radiocative.
The report said "Gulf Oil is
sinking the world's deepest
mine shaft into Mount Taylor,
one of the four sacred moun
tains of the Navajo people."
Are nuclear weapons or
power worth it? Albert Einstein,
who with others created the
atomic bomb, comprehended
the terrible threat to all human
ity. On Aug. 6,1947 he wrote to
a friend, "In the shadow of the
atomic bomb it has become
apparent that all men are
brothers."
Dare we call the Russians our
tolerable fellow inhabitants of
this small space ship Earth? Live
together or perish together is
our choice. After the twin hor
rors of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, we would-be
peacemakers say, "Never
again."

A life lost
We should realize that
human beings are being sys
tematically killed; and that
these unfortunate lives have
no way to fight for their human
rights.
We should realize that we

must be the voice of the voice
less, and, as the fight con
tinues, your concern, support
and awareness are needed.
Fight to show that human life
is human life.
The people of whom I speak
are those aborted infants that
Dawn Upchurch forgot to
mention in her column (Daily,
Oct. 17).
I disagree with Upchurch's
opinion that one human life is
greater, more precious, than
another.
She says at the beginning of
her column that, thanks to
"safe," legalized abortion, a
Stanford woman with an un
wanted pregnancy can "con
tinue life as planned" and
"continue academic pursuits
and career."
But this occurs at the ex
pense of other human lives —
other human lives that have no
choice on either their concep
tion or destruction.
A woman knows that there is
no infallible birth control
method apd she must realize
this before consummation.
This is where the choice lies.
She understands the con
sequences, and she chooses.
If, by chance, she does get
pregnant then the choice has
already been made — unless
murder has become the order
of our day.
Granted, this may lead to the
ruination of two lives, and
probably many more, but this
was her choice. It's all part of
the "game."
Here, I would like to explain
that I have not mentioned the
male role in this issue because
Upchurch failed to do the
same.
I would like to use a quote
from the editorial comment:
"Stanford women have the
freedom to choose abortion,
the freedom to control their
lives." And apparently, accord
ing to Upchurch and the Stan
ford Pro-Choice Alliance, they
have the freedom to create and
destroy.

Teller at issue
As one who recognized
Hoover Fellow Edward Teller as
one of the most highly qual
ified physicists in the country, I
was disappointed by his shal
low analysis of the anti-nuclear
movement (Daily, Oct. 25).
In the interview, Teller ac
cused the anti-nuclear move
ment of relying on scare tactics
rather than fact. The truth is the
facts about nuclear power are
frightening.
Teller claimed that "nobody
has yet been hurt by a big regu
lated industrial reactor."
Vet, because the nuclear
power industry is fairly young,
we do not yet know all of the
long-range effects that it will
have on our lives.
It is a fact that many
radiation-induced cancers do
not appear for 10 to 20 years
after the initial exposure.
The experts differ in their
opinions. Radiological physi
cist Ernest Sternglass reports
that the Three Mile Island acci
dent may have exposed about a
million people to up to 130
times more radiation than has
been reported.
He estimates that an addi
tional 300 to 2500 people could
develop lungcancer in the next
10 to 20 years, as a result of
their exposure to the accident.
In addition, we cannot pre
dict what health effects that
radiation will have on our chil
dren.
Teller presented no statistics
or facts, only unsupported
analogies and accusations. He
clearly dodged the question of
nuclear safety.
He chose instead to attack
individual personalities within
the anti-nuclear movement, a
reflection of his reluctance to
deal with the arguments at
hand on the f r merits.
Teller mistakenly believed
that )ane Fonda and Dr. Spock
are spokespeople for the anti
