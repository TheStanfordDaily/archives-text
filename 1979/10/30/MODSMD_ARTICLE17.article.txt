## Shepard's twisted, torturous view from the bottom 
### 
Buried Child, says Sam
Shepard, is the unearthing of a
terrible secret which holds a
family together, while tearing it
apart.
That symbiotic antagonism
harks back »o the '60s and, in
deed, this play runs a lot like
Virginia Woolf or The
Homecoming. But, there's
immeasurably more hate than
love in the relationships here
and the games of word and
ritual mushroom beyond
Albee and Pinter in outright
viciousness.
Buried Child is as tasteless as
the dead-baby joke upon
which it is built; it wallows in a
powerfully drawn world of
savagery and the macabre —
what's commonly known as
'70s middle America.
Shepard uses a sledgeham
mer, where a scalpel would do
because, he says, no way will
people listen to his cry that the
American dream has not been
destroyed from without, but
has caved in, its roots as de
cayed and its heart as empty as
are those of the people in this
play.
ACT's production stays loyal
to these intentions, although it
slips too much to the condes
cending. Despite Edward Hast
ings' tight direction and the
strong ensemble acting,
everyone hesitates just a bit be
fore delivering those brutal

scenes. The cast seems to fear
that the audience will turn
away (the popular answer to
ugly situations) and so it playsa
tug-of-war between honoring
the script's razored edges and
holding hands with those in
the orchestra who are about to
rush out for air.
By the second (of three) acts,
self-consciousness has sur
rendered to trust in Shepard's
gifts as entertainer and writer.
His affinity for shock and gore
often obscures his mastery ot
comedy, especially what Cow
ard called true wit — the ability
to get a laugh out of a well
turned cough.
He has tun making fun of his
own seriousness in theme and
imagery: his penchant for
murky poeticism is parodied in
the opening scene, in which
Halie (Marrian Walters) re
minisces lyrically, while hus
band Dodge (William Pater
son) indulges in beer-sodden
mugging. Walters and Pater
son specialize in such stuff and
they carry the show on their
shoulders.
Shepard the entertainer also
loves the comic-thriller. Buried
Child is a twist on this: we
know whodunit, what we must
figure out is whot "they" did. A
problem, though, is knowing
when to laugh. A man crawling
and begging after a woman
dangling his artificial leg — is

that funny? The joke's on us.
We laugh, then think we
should catch ourselves, then
Shepard says, So there. You
aren't so different from these
people, are you?
And the characters really
aren't that removed from life;
they simply don't fit within its
bounds. Paterson and Walters
are wise enough to underplay
these nonconformities, for in
stance, shouting THE WORDS,
not SHOUTING the words. The
others are less controlled, yet
you can't deny the haunting
power of these grotesquely
played grotesques: Lawrence
Hecht as the halt-wit son with a
whiif of incest; Raye Birk as his
amputee brother; and Jeff
McCarthy as Hecht's son, rep
resenting the buried child in
the way the Young Man is Al
bee's American Dream.
Barbara Dirickson as McCar
thy's girlfriend and Sydney
Walker as the family priest get
away with playing to form, be
cause their characters are the
"givens" off which all else
bounces.
Hastings and his designers
have taken an interesting turn.
Shepard worries over the ar
tificialities of American pre
sent, Martha Burke's costumes,
Ralph Funicello's set and Dirk
Epperson's lighing run toward
the earthbound naturalistic.
The family farmhouse is a barn

and the characters resemble
animals: Paterson burrowing
into his sofa-nest; the simian
McCarthy jumping around the
furniture; or Dirickson, with
big eyes and a perky nose,
warm in a rabbit coat.

Perhaps Hastings sees
Shepard's interest in American
Surface reaching back through
those decayed roots and empty
hearts to The Beginning; that
no matter how high man has
built his towers, the founda

tion still rests in such basic
struggles as the tight for posses
sion and the search for iden
tity. So, Buried Child is about
FAKE, WIN and GLOAT: from
fhe most intimate prizes (Birk's
artificial leg, Paterson's moral

dignity) to the grandest
(McCarthy claiming the family
house as his legacy/curse. "I
see a long line of faces behind
me. Faces changing into faces
. . . my father's face into my

tace . . . and it never stops.")
That leads to Buried Child's
use ol laces — and also voices
to show that the ties that
bind are those that blind: who
we are and what we mean to
each other (especially in family
relationships) are not truths in
scribed in stone; they precari
ously rest upon the willingness
ot others to believe. (Father
Dodge to children: "Who says
you must love your offspring!
Haven't you seen a bitch eating
her puppies?")
I he weight ol all these ideas
and imagery makes Buried
Child, the "unearthing," seem
more like a burial — with us at
the bottom, the playwright
raining clods upon us, pausing
only to slip in an ending thai
'eels .is it he had whacked us in
the head with his shovel.
I he view up is bleak.
(ACT s Buried Child runs in re
pertory with Romeo and luliet
.ind Hay Fever at the Geary
theatre, 450 Geary St. in San
Francisco.)
