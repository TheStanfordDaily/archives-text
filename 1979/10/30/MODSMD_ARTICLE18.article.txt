# Band hits Stern before the charts
## 
### 
Stern Hall's Halloween party
was a success last Friday par
tially because of the music pro
vided by the up and coming
band |ason. The band was un
ique to Stanford parties in that
it is on the brink of national
recognition and includes stu
dent Greg Lowitz as
saxophonist.
As a ten member band, )ason
has a polished, versatile
sound, playing songs from ar
tists ranging from Boston to the
Commodores. The group has
also written much of their own
material, and are now in the
process of recording their
debut album at Overland Re
cording Studios. Two of their
songs have been aired by two
big L.A. stations — KEZV and
KWST.
Formed in 1971, )ason has th
rived for nearly a decade per
forming for campus dances,
hotels, the Arlaheim Conven
tion Center, the Ice House and
an audience of over 40,000
people at the Post President's

Conference in Washington,
D.C. Within the last year and a
half, |ason has written and re
corded the entire music
soundtrack to the mystery
comedy, "Of Corpse You
Can." and has recently
finished an industrial TV com
mercial for the BMX racing
bike company.
As a result of their success in
their first movie, )ason has now
contracted to work on an up
coming release, "California
Girls," to be distributed by the
same distributors of the box of
fice hit, "Animal House."
Zapata resident Lowitz says
he is confident that Jason will
hit the ( harts shortly after their
first public release. "With all
the talented musicians and
songwriters in the band, the
record industry would be
foolish to let us slide. We've
already had some positive re
sponse from the biggies like
ASCAP, BMI and several other
publishing firms . . . now it's

just a matter of time and a lot of
perseverance. We're at that
critical point when other bands
fall by the wayside."
Saturday night's perfor
mance demonstrated both the
extreme musical talent of the
group, and the lack of electric
ity their polished sound can
lead to. In the reproduction of
other artist's songs and in the
performance of their own
material, Jason's talent was
evident. The varied styles of
female vocalists )ane Zevon
and Kimaya Koepke and male
lead Dirk Stewart allowed the
group to vary its sound tre
mendously. w The group
switched from Toto to Earth,
Wind and Fire to Chicago with
out difficulty.
The horn section with Ken
Bell on trombone, Charlie
Zevon on trumpet and Craig
Gardner and Greg Lowitz on
saxes also help give Jason its tat
sound. At times, though, the
horn section didn't seem to

make its presence felt enough,
letting the talent of its mem
bers be drowned out by the
rest of the band. The group
also features Tom Ravel, Steve
Billman, Randy Gonzales, and
Bob Black on drums, bass,
keyboards, and guitar respec
tively.
The main problem with la
son's performance was that it
was almost too polished. Espe
cially early in the evening one
had the leeling "was it live or
was it Memorex?"
The group seemed to be
come more energetic by the
end of the evening though. Its
finale lett the crowd shouting
for more.
Especially at the end of the
evening, one could see why
the music experts think |ason
could be on the way to success.
Hopefully the next time the
band comes to Stanford they'll
be well on their way to national
prominence.

first public release. "With all
the talented musicians and
songwriters in the band, the
record industry would be
foolish to let us slide. We've
already had some positive re
sponse from the biggies like
ASCAP, BMI and several other
publishing firms . . . now it's

just a matter of time and a lot of
perseverance. We're at that
critical point when other bands
fall by the wayside."
Saturday night's perfor
mance demonstrated both the
extreme musical talent of the
group, and the lack of electric
ity their polished sound can
lead to. In the reproduction of
other artist's songs and in the
performance of their own
material, Jason's talent was
evident. The varied styles of
female vocalists )ane Zevon
and Kimaya Koepke and male
lead Dirk Stewart allowed the
group to vary its sound tre
mendously. w The group
switched from Toto to Earth,
Wind and Fire to Chicago with
out difficulty.
The horn section with Ken
Bell on trombone, Charlie
Zevon on trumpet and Craig
Gardner and Greg Lowitz on
saxes also help give Jason its tat
sound. At times, though, the
horn section didn't seem to

make its presence felt enough,
letting the talent of its mem
bers be drowned out by the
rest of the band. The group
also features Tom Ravel, Steve
Billman, Randy Gonzales, and
Bob Black on drums, bass,
keyboards, and guitar respec
tively.
The main problem with la
son's performance was that it
was almost too polished. Espe
cially early in the evening one
had the leeling "was it live or
was it Memorex?"
The group seemed to be
come more energetic by the
end of the evening though. Its
finale lett the crowd shouting
for more.
Especially at the end of the
evening, one could see why
the music experts think |ason
could be on the way to success.
Hopefully the next time the
band comes to Stanford they'll
be well on their way to national
prominence.
