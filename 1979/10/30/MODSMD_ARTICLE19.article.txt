# Hound is quite a mystery
## 
### 
The most overwhelming fea
ture of The Real Inspector
Hound, produced by the
Company last weekend, is that
the plot is weird. It is one of
those plays about a play that
merrily makes tun of itself and
where 't takes a moment to
even be sure exactly where the
cast stops and the audience
begins.
During the course of this one
act show, four characters
change roles, scenes are re
peated verbatim with different
leading males, and in the end,
the actor who solves the mys
tery of two bewildering, but
not exactly frightening mur
ders, terminates so many sub
plots at once that even he is not
sure the true name of the
character he is playing.
Hound's protagonists are
two reviewers who sit in the
tront row alternately discus
sing the rest of the play and the
latest crisis of their lives. The
lirst, Moon, played by Scott
Fnright, is tired of his role as a
second-string reporter and is
preoccupied with dreaming of
his superior's demise.
The second, Birdboot,
played by Kuss Lees, makes a

habit of writing sterling re
views ot leading ladies in re
turn for post-performance
gratuities. He is quickly taken
by Lady Cynthia, Marylou
Torre, the widowed mistress of
Muldoon manor.
In the middle of the show,
Birdboot is summoned
onstage by a ringing phone
which turns out to be his wife
("I told you not to call me at the
office honey") and when Lady
Cynthia comes on stage he de
cides to join the cast. He is
murdered and Moon rushes
out to save his friend, to be
come first detective and then
the accused killer,
Lees and Enright performed
their parts well, being both
suitably confused and suitably
British to capitalize on the
often ridiculous content of
their dialogues.
The rest of the parts allowed
little chance for any personal
ity, though. The maid Mrs.
Drudge, Stacy A/ama, speaks
like a descriptive interlude in a
Victorian novel and answers
the phone like a narrator,
"Muldoon man, one spring af
ternoon, may I help you?" Lady
Cynthia answers almost every

question with an expression of
loyalty to her long lost husband
so satirical that it could only be
played with the slightest bit of
melodrama.
The mysterious Major Mag
nus, Jay Martel, lays his
clues with lines that also must
be spoken like a straight man
would, "Pardon me, I must go
oil my gun." He does however,
do an excellent job of piloting
his errant wheelchair deftly ac
ross the stage.
The play was put on in the
Old Union's Nitery, an excel
lent location. This small theater
let Moon and Birdboot be part
of both the audience and the
cast, which is essential to
heighten the sense of the
ridiculous on which this play
depends.
As a whole the show was
good, though not fabulous. It
depends on its jokes, which
were often hilarious, but the
plot didn't allow any of the
characters to become particu
larly memorable. For an even
ing ot comical entertainment,
though, one can't complain,
even if the reviewer did get
shot.
