# OSOC aims to unionize clericals
## 
### Kathleen McClung 
Clerical workers' frustration over
salaries and grievance procedure
may end soon in unionization.
At least that is the goal of the Office
Staft Organizing Committee
(OSOC), a group of University cleri
cal workers.
This week the OSOC is sponsoring
an Office Stall Rally/Action Week
featuring daily activities to publicize
their drive to establish an autonom
ous bargaining unit within United
Stanlord Employees (USE), the cam
pus employees' labor union. A rally
will be held on Thursday.
Since June, the OSOC has been
collecting "blue card" signatures
from University clericals, authorizing
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) to hold a union election.
At least 10 percent of the Universi
ty's 2000 clerical workt â€¢rs must sign
cards lor an election to be held.
More than 600 cards have been
submitted already. "We're pushing
tor 900 because some will be in
valid," said OSOC spokesman
Natalie Eisher, a secretary at the
School ot Medicine. Signatures will
be invalid if the worker is no longer
employed here.
From past work in the University's
Personnel and Affirmative Action of
fices, "I learned that there is no such
thing as equality here," said loyce
Tipps-Coats, chair ot OSOC. "Men
in unskilled jobs are receiving higher
pay than women in skilled posi
tions."
Salaries tor clerical workers here
are considerably lower than salaries
elsewhere and many secretaries here
are forced to hold down other jobs,
said Fisher.
She also criticized the grievance
procedure for non-union
