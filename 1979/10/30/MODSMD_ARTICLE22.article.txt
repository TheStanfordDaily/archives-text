# Tom Scott blows his horn of plenty

### 
The Tom Scott Band proved
something Thursday night at
the Coffee House that was
most uplifting to this reviewer:
when the music is hot and in
tense, alcohol and the audi
ence need not mix for good
times to be had by all.
Judging by the very tew who
had bottles or glasses on their
tables, it was a sober crowd
that grooved to the fire blazing
from Scott's saxophones.
Primarily because of the pub
lic's response to former Coffee
House employees and boycott
supporters picketing outside,
the Coffee House sold little al
cohol and food to the standing
room only audience.
It took the audience all of
five minutes to come on to the
band pouring shot after shot of
funk throughout the room,
joyfully intoxicating all in at
tendance.
Scott began his high-energy
assault with a climactic lyricon
solo. Oversimplified, a lyricon
is a synthesized electric
saxophone that is slightly smal
ler in size and shape than a
soprano saxophone. With Tom
Scott in command, the lyricon
became an orator of high
speed extra-terrestrial conflict.
Hence the name of the open
ing song: "Car Wars."
The next number, "Dirty Old
Man," showcased fhe band's
electric guitarist, Carlos Rios,
in a solo that took the audience
from a romantic Earl Klugh-like
introduction into a rare display

of technical virtuosity (speed)
with a lot of feeling behind it.
It's uncommon to find a jazz
rock fusion guitarist who plays
from the heart and not the
head, allowing technique to
further, rather than hinder, his
emotional expression. Rios is a
member of this group. Listen
ing to him evoked an aural
image of what Carlos Santana
might have sounded like had
he entered the musical genre
of fusion funk.
Unfortunately, Rios' guitar
solo was so climactic that the
following tune, "Breezin'
Easy," was the low point of the
concert. Beginning with a
slowly paced samba feel, it
soon degenerated into some
thing one might hear in the
contexj of a movie soundtrack.
One guy from a nearby table
remarked that it belonged in
the Stanford Shopping Center
rather than the Stanford Coffee
House. I won't take it that far,
although the point is clearly
made.
The band made up tor this
during the rest of the set. Scott
was especially brilliant and
funky on alto and tenor saxes
with his soprano and lyricon
playing not tar behind. His alto
and tenor work had a sharp
edge and a teel that cured my
nostalgia tor the sounds of that
funk saxophone king, Lenny
Pickett (ol Tower ot Power
tame), used to project. Scott's
soprano, especially on his

was mostly his own distinct
voice at its subtlest, with hints
of Grover Washington |r. sur
facing occasionally.
The rest ot the band, includ
ing David Garfield on
keyboards and Neil
Steubenhaus on bass, played
in a supportive groove
throughout the show. They of
fered no surprises of either vir
tuosity or incompetence, al
though much ot the crowd was
outspokenly impressed by the
only drum solo in the show.

cuil Events and the Coffee
House for a well-produced
concert. The ASSU brought a
top-name jazz act to an inti
mate setting at Stanford, while
the Coffee House waitresses
provided wonderful enter
tainment by frequently stumbl
ing through the crowded audi
ence, winding up in surprised
laps, and, at one point, causing
the bass player to grin so
"Cheshirishly" that he missed
a beat.
