Yadin rejects Begin's offer
Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Menachem
Begin (ailed yesterday in his first attempt to
choose a new foreign minister and pull himself
out of a cabinet crisis that could topple his
government.
Deputy Prime Minister Vigael Vadin turned
down Begin's offer to take over, the post left
vacant last week by Moshe Dayan, who quit in
a disagreement over the goverment's policy in
the occupied West Bank.
Echoing Dayan's contentions, Yadin told Is
rael Radio "there are differences of views bet
ween our party and the major party on some
issues of foreign policy," which prevented him
from accepting the job. But he added that if
Begin offers him to head Israel's negotiating
team on West Bank autonomy, he would re
consider his refusal.
Begin offered the post to Yadin at Hadassah
hospital in Jerusalem, where Yadin is recover
ing from a mild heart attack.

bles, told Israeli newspapers he would leave by
mid-November, and Ariel Sharon, the minister
in charge of West Bank settlement, threatened
to walk out it the government ordered evacua

tlement evacuated, holding that it was set up in
violation ot international law which permits
building on occupied lands only tor security
purposes.

No successor for Park yet
Seoul, South Korea — The assassination of
President Park Chung-hee may have set the
stage tor a softening of the iron rule that has
held down opposition in this < ountry for years,
informed political sources said yesterday.
The government may have signaled its inten
tions by allowing publication of an opposition
appeal for democratic reforms in South Korea.
But North Korea c harged that the Park killing
was actually aimed at preserving the "fascist
regime." And the Soviet Union accused the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency of having di
rected the death plot to protect American in
terests, an allegation denied by the Carter ad
ministration.
The helicopter carrier USS Blue Kidge,
meanwhile, was cruising toward the South Ko
rean port ot Pusan in a demonstration ot con
tinued American support for the Seoul gov
ernment. It was scheduled to arrive today.
South Korea's acting president, Choi Kyu

hah, and cabinet ministers met in hours-long
sessions behind closed doors yesterday, pre
sumably discussing the leadership crisis and
possible replacements for Park.
At the Defense Ministry, top generals were
reported to have begun meeting at 10 p.m.,
when a martial-law curfew went into effect. No
information was available on the gathering of
the military chiefs, who have long been the
real power base in South Korea.
The nation remained outwardly calm as
hundreds of thousands in cities and towns ac
ross South Korea prayed before public altars
set up to memorialize Park.
Sources agreed that Assembly members Kim
)ong-pil, 53, and Chung 11-Kwon, 61, both
former military men and one-time prime
ministers, are possible successors to Park. But
one source noted that both men have enemies
inside and outside the ruling Democratic Re
publican Party.
"Therefore, acting president Choi may
emerge as a compromise candidate to take
power, with some understanding among the
opposing political forces that political reforms
will be made within a certain period," accord
ing to the source.
Court to review life patenting
Washington — The Supreme Court, agreeing
tor the tirst time to probe the field of "genetic
engineering," said yesterday it will decide
whether corporations may patent new life
forms.
The justices voted to review a lower court's
ruling that such laboratory-produced life is pa
tentable. At stake could be millions of dollars
tor those firms that find commercially profita
ble uses for such life forms.
Government lawyers are urging the justices
to reverse a ruling announced last March 29 by
the U.S. Court of Customsand Patent Appeals.
The lower court ruled that micro-organisms
developed by Upjohn Co. and General Electric
scientists had to be issued patents.
"The economic implications of that holding
are very significant, given the vast area that it
opens to patentability," the government ar
gued in seeking Supreme Court review.
Following a two-week recess, the court left
intact rulings that federal employees are not
covered by a 1970 law protecting worker health
and safety. Thus, federal workers who smoke
will not be manditorily segregated from those
who do not.
The justices agreed to review rulings that
blocked an Ohio woman from appealing the
loss ot custody ot her two children because
she could not afford to buv a lower-court trans
cript necessary for the appeal. At issue is
whether states must provide free transcripts in
such cases for persons who cannot afford to
pay tor them.

Three beers may be healthy
Chicago — A study of the drinking habits of
more than 1100 men has shown that moderate
consumption of beer, wine and liquor may
reduce the risk of heart attack, according to a
report in the Nov. 2 issue of the journal of the
American Medical Association.
The report says that people who drink about
three beers, two glasses of wine or two high
balls per day may be less likely to die of coro
nary disease than people who abstain from
alcohol.
But an editorial printed in the Nov. 2 issue
says doctors should look cautiously at the find
ing.
"With 17 million alcoholics in this country
we perhaps have a message for which this
country is not yet ready," writes Dr. W.P. Cas
telli, ot the National Heart Institute.
The researchers, a team of doctors at Har
vard Medical School, collected data on 568
men who had died ot heart disease and com
pared it to data on an equal number of men in
the same age groups and with the same socio
economic background, researcher Dr. Walter
Willett said in a telephone interview.
He said previous studies also have found
some medicinal value in liquor.
States may oppose new border
Carson City, Nev. — The U.S. Supreme Court
issued an order yesterday giving Nevada and
California 45 days in which to challenge a spe
cial master's recommendation that the border
between the two states not be moved.
The high court's brief order also gives
lawyers for either side an additional 30 days to
respond to one another's exceptions to the
report from U.S. District Court )udge Robert
Van Pelt of Nebraska.
It's not known whether California plans to
challenge the report, but Nevada does. Special
counsel )im Thompson contends the border
should be moved west as much as a mile.
Earlier this month, Judge Van Pelt endorsed
the present line, known as the Von Schmidt
survey line from the Oregon border to the
middle of Lake Tahoe, and a U.S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey line running south from
Tahoe to the Colorado River.
Thompson said Nevada's main contention is
that the Houghton-Ives survey line, estab
lished in 1863, should be recognized. The Von
Schmidt line was done in 1872, and the
U.S.C.S. line was completed in 1899.
The case came before the Supreme Court in
1977, when California tiled what was viewed as
a friendly suit asking that a dispute over the
border be resolved.
At tirst, the suit was viewed as a means to
formally recognize the existing line. But
claims, counterclaims and other moves to ex

pand the litigation developed.
For instance, California requested that a new
boundary survey be conducted using modern
methods. California Controller Ken Cory has
said he was certain a new survey would move
four Nevada casinos in the north Lake Tahoe
area in to California.
Nevada's countering move was to seek more
westerly boundaries and regain anywhere
from 200 to 1100 square miles more, including
part of South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
San Mateo to end odd-even
Sacramento — San Mateo County has been
given permission to drop out ot the state's
odd-even gasoline sales program, leaving only
three counties in the program, Gov. Jerry
Brown announced yesterday.
The Democratic governor said he had ap
proved the request from the county's super
visors to withdraw from the program, effective
midnight tomorrow.
Brown authorized the odd-even program,
based on the last digit of a vehicle's license
plate, on May 9 in an attempt to shorten gas
station lines and keep stations open longer.
Fourteen counties volunteered to take part
in the program at the outset. San Mateo's
withdrawal leaves only Los Angeles, Alameda
and Contra Costa Counties still in the state
program. San Francisco supervisors have
voted to drop the plan next month.
Market opens despite protest
New York — Stock prices were mixed in light
trading yesterday, the 50th anniversary of
"Black Tuesday," as thousands demonstrated
outside the New York Stock Exchange to de
mand an end to Wall Street support of nuclear
power.
Cheers broke out on the floor of the ex
change as the market opened at its normal
hour, despite thousands of demonstrators
who had vowed to close the exchange to pro
test Wall Street support of the nuclear indus
try.
The Dow (ones average of 30 industrials fell
.68 to 808.62 but advancers led losers by an 8-7
margin.
Volume was 22.72 million shares, the lowest
since May 14, a fact that shows how much the
NYSE has grown since "Black Tuesday," when
the 16.41 shares traded broke the previous
volume record by 27 percent and staggered the
market.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with patchy fog near
the coast late tonight and tomorrow morning.
