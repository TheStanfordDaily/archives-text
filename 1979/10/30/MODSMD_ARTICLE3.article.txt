# Business move lowers gas prices
## Shell says Standard Oil in competitive position 
### Steve Brown 
Chevron gasoline, diesel fuel and
heating oil will cost three cents less
per gallon because of a wholesale
price cut announced by Standard Oil
of California last week.
Company-owned service stations
have already lowered their prices.
Independent Chevron dealers will
do the same when new deliveries ar
rive because dealers are limited to a
15.4 cents per gallon profit margin by
the Department of Energy.
"Our costs have moderated and
we're passing along the savings,"
said lerry Martin of Public Affairs at
Chevron. He explained that Chevron
previously had to purchase finished
products on the expensive spot mar
ket to meet its own refineries. A
major Chevron refinery in Florida
shut by Hurricane David has re
sumed production.
Martin said the price change was
"a business decision and it's not de
signed tor public relations."
Shell Oil Co. Public Affairs rep
resentative Bill Eisenlord said the
price decrease "puts Chevron in a
very keen competitive position."

Eisenlord would not say whether
Shell would also reduce its prices.
"Any comment I make on our pricing
plan is considered collusion."
A Daily survey of 20 Palo Alto area
stations shows average self-service
gasoline prices were $1.014 for regu
lar, $1.06 for unleaded and $1.079 for
supreme. Averages for full-service
gasoline were 1.5 cents higher.
The lowest prices in the area for all
types of gasoline were found at the
Chevron-Standard station at El
Camino Real and Homer Avenue in
Palo Alto. Self-service prices were
92.2 cents for regular, 96.8 cents for
unleaded, and 99.4 cents for sup
reme. These reflected the 3 cent
drop made Thursday.
The highest prices were about 15
percent more than the lowest.
The California State Automobile
Association (CSAA) reported that
gasoline prices have increased one
cent in the last month, and diesel fuel
two cents. Palo Alto prices averaged
one cent less than the average for
Northern California.
The CSAA also reported that fuel
available near major highways per

mits "relatively unrestricted travel at
any time," but warned that gas may
be difficult to find late at night. Ac
cording to the CSAA, considerably
fewer stations are open on Sunday
also. At least 20 percent ot Palo Alto
stations surveyed by the Daily are
open for limited hours on Sunday.
Martin, of Chevron, called the cur
rent gasoline situation "a delicate
equilibrium between reduced de
mand and supplies."
Martin said, "No one knows what
the future holds" for gasoline prices.
He predicted the phasing out of
crude oil price controls would con
tribute less than one cent to gasoline
price increases this year.
"We have big lines again down
along the road," said a Palo Alto
Chevron station manager who asked
not to be identified. He also said he
was. selling more than his daily quota
of gasoline and would have to further
restrict his hours.
Other dealers reported no prob
lem with lines but said they could not
predict what the availability or price
of gasoline will he in the future.
