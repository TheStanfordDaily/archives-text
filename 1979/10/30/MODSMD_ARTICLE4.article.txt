# Demonstrators march against Lockheed
## 
### Simon Labov 
Sunnyvale — About 20 Stanford
students were among the marchers
who held a peaceful protest here Sun
day against the Trident missile sys
tem. They called tor converting Loc
kheed Space and Missiles to a non
military production plant.
The Trident submarines and mis
siles are the latest modernization ot
the U.S. defense system. The mis
siles have longer range and better
accuracy than the Poseidon system.
The march was organized as part of
a national protest. Actions were also
held in New York, Kingsbay, Geor

gia; Bangor, Washington; Groten,
Connecticut; Washington, D.C.;
and elsewhere around the nation.
They were all organized in response
to the deployment of the tirst Trident
missiles on a modified Poseidon
submarine last week.
Director of Public Relations for
Lockheed, George Mulhern, said in
an interview that the Sunnyvale
march was "one of many such
things." He emphasized the legiti
macy ol Lockheed's work, saying that
the Trident is "a number one priority
program, approved by Congress."
"I would say it is the most essential

part of the security of this country,"
he added.
The participants ranged in age
from infants in backpacks and strol
lers to older people. They marched
for miles carrying the "Trident Mons
ter," a symbolic representation of
the submarine. The "Monster" is 560
feet long, the length of the sub
marine, and has two long rows of
black flags, one for each of the 408
warheads a fully loaded Trident
submarine could carry.
The procession stopped first in
front of Lockheed, then continued to
Westinghouse, where the protesters
stood in silent vigil. Westinghouse is
where the launch tubes for the sub
marine are built.
One protester said "The theme is
STOP, stop developing more
weapons." Several people carried
banners with slogans such as: "What
costs over two billion dollars and
must never be used? One Trident
submarine." and "Give our children
dreams, not nuclear nightmares."
For the past four Fridays, people
have been distributing leaflets to the
workers as they enter the plant early
in the morning. Last Friday, protes
ters handed out leaflets at the Soviet
Consulate calling for Soviet disar
mament.
On Monday, protesters peacefully
entered the plant to talk with work
ers and distribute more leaflets.
More than 150 people were there at
6:30 a.m. and 43 people were ar
rested for trespassing.
W.R. Hilbrink, public information
administrator at Lockheed, said in an
interview after the arrests that the'
demonstration was "what we ex
pected — it was what they said they
were going to do."
"We've gone through this be
fore," he added. "It's pretty much
routine."
Roses Against a Nuclear Environ
ment (RANE), a campus group, en
dorsed the action and many of its
members attended.
Following the "Trident Monster"

many people carried signs protesting
the arms rate and calling for disar
mament. One group carried the flags
of the six countries with thermonuc
lear weapons: the United States, the
Soviet Union, China, England, Fr
ance and India.
Tony Moy, a Stanford alumnus,
who has been active in the "Stop
Trident/Convert Lockheed" coali
tion, said, "The coalition is not just
tor unilateral disarmament, but for
total disarmament. There are an al
most equal number of lethal nuclear
weapons in the Soviet Union as
well."


About 600 demonstrators Sunday marched to Lot kheed
construction of the Trident Missile and related components.

W.R. Hilbrink, public information
administrator at Lockheed, said in an
interview after the arrests that the'
demonstration was "what we ex
pected — it was what they said they
were going to do."
"We've gone through this be
fore," he added. "It's pretty much
routine."
Roses Against a Nuclear Environ
ment (RANE), a campus group, en
dorsed the action and many of its
members attended.
Following the "Trident Monster"

many people carried signs protesting
the arms rate and calling for disar
mament. One group carried the flags
of the six countries with thermonuc
lear weapons: the United States, the
Soviet Union, China, England, Fr
ance and India.
Tony Moy, a Stanford alumnus,
who has been active in the "Stop
Trident/Convert Lockheed" coali
tion, said, "The coalition is not just
tor unilateral disarmament, but for
total disarmament. There are an al
most equal number of lethal nuclear
weapons in the Soviet Union as
well."


About 600 demonstrators Sunday marched to Lot kheed
construction of the Trident Missile and related components.
