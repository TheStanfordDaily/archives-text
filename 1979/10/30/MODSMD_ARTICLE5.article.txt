### 
New York (AP) — To the beat of a
brass band, more than 1000 anti
nuclear demonstrators tried in vain
yesterday to close the New York
•Stock Exchange on the 50th anniver
sary ot the stock market crash.
Police reported 1045 arrests in
what was the largest of several anti
nuclear demonstrations across the
nation.
In Washington, D.C., about 250
protesters blocked doorways to the
Energy Dept. and rallied on
Independence Avenue, and 88 per
sons were taken into custody during
a protest at the Trident nuclear sub
marine base in Bangor, Wash.
In New York, scores of de
monstrators jammed the exchange
on Wall and Broad streets, saying
their targets were firms that finance
the nuclear industry.
"Don't go to work today arid take a
holiday from death," one de
monstrator urged the Stock Ex
change employees.
Wall and Broad streets were
closed, hut traffic was backed up for
nine blocks on nearby Broadway.

Among the tirst to lie arrested was
Daniel Ellsberg, key figure in the
Vietnam-era Pentagon Papers case.
The exchange brought many of its
em()loyees in early and opened on
schedule at 10 a.m. to active trading.
"We intend to remain open and op
erate normally," said one exchange
official.
Aside from occasional brief scuttl
ing at police barricades, the mood
was festive, with the 15-piece band
providing circus music.
"I haven't had this much tun since
the 19605," Police Capt. Thomas
Ryan said, referring to the many
anti-war protests of that decade.
Police dragged some of the de
monstrators away by the arms,
others were transported on stretch
ers. Ten buses were on hand, along
with a similar number ot small police
wagons. Most ot the protestors were
taken to police headquarters uptown
from Wall Street. The overflow was
taken to Brooklyn for booking.
Most of them were < hargecJ with
disorderly conduct, obstruction ot
governmental administration. Those
who laid down were booked for re
sisting arrest. Police said 750 sum
mons were issued and 295 persons
were jailed. It could not be deter
mined it some protestors received
more than one summons.
Stock Exchange officials had been
asked by demonstration leaders ear
lier this month to suspend 61 mem
bers who deal in nuclear weapons
and power.
In turning them down, Stock Ex
change Vice President Richard
Grosso said the type of business a
member was engaged in was not a
concern ot the stock market. He said
standards for admission required
only that a member distribute its
stock nationally, and that the com
pany be in a sound financial condi
tion.
