# Buses uncrowded
## 
### Mike Vaska 
Despite increased use of
local transit systems as a re
sult of the recent gas
crunch, students here
should not be bothered by
overcrowded buses, ac
cording to Jim Gallagher,
spokesman for the San
Mateo County transit dis
trict (SamTrans).
Students boarding buses
at the Stanford Shopping
Center for the City and the
airport can find seats easily
because they "are at the
head of the line for city
bound buses," Gallagher
said. Route 7F, an express
line to the airport and San
Francisco, and SL, which
runs to the BART station,
both begin at Page Mill
Road.
But some SamTrans
routes are severely over
crowded at times.
"The problem is that
everyone wants to ride at
the same time," he said. Al
though buses are crowded

during morning and even
ing commute hours, they
have "tons of capacity" at
other times.
Steady growth in rider
ship since SamTrans began
operation in 1976 has accel
erated during the gas crisis,
he said. The system carried
42,000 passengers per day,
or 900,000 a month before
the spring gas crunch, and
now carries about 65,000 a
day, or 1.5 million a month.
The system will receive
100 new buses at the end of
this year, although no major
changes in service are plan
ned to meet the increased
ridership, Gallagher said.
About 50 of the new buses
will replace older models
that are being phased out of
operation and the other 50
"are earmarked for high
volume areas," he said.
SamTrans presently has
about 250 buses in its fleet.
The SP trains also run up
