No Nitrosamines
in Coors Beer*
Recently developed
laboratory techniques
have found nitrosamines—
suspected cancer-causing
agents—in some beers
in minute amounts.
There are no detectable
nitrosamines in Coors or
Coors Light as determined by
the United States Food and
Drug Administration, using
the most sophisticated ana
lytic techniques.
Here's why: Some years ago,
as part of a continuing effort
to make the best beer possible,
we instituted an unconven
tional malting process. This
special process not only creates
a better beer, it avoids the possi
bility of nitrosamines.
Coors has a tradition of
bringing innovative methods
to the brewing of beer. Always
attempting to brew a better,
finer, purer beer. Once more,
Coors' dedication to brewing
excellence has paid off.
