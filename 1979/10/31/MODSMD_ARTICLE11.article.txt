EDITOR'S NOTE: Thousands otCam
bodians wander through their country
trying to escape the war between the
Vietnam-hacked government of Heng
Samrin and the soldiers ot tormer Pre
mier Pol Pot, who was forced from
power last winter. Many reach the Thai
border camps where international aid
organizations try to help them, hut for
some it is too late. Jeftrey Rohbins,
Southeast Asia photo editor for The As
sociated Press writes of one child, one
day.
Sa Kaew, Thailand (AP) — She was
only live years old. It took her months
to walk to this refugee camp, but only
30 minutes to die, her twig-thin arms and
legs spread out on a straw mat as a doc
tor and two aides tought to tind a vein
tor a blood transtusion.
"I can't find a vein, I can't tind a
vein," the doctor muttered as he
probed her arms, her groin, her neck,
shrunken trom malnutrition.
Her heart stopped once but with
rough massaging a nurse brought it
back to lite. It stopped and the

nurse gave her mouth-to-mouth resus
citation; the doctor pushed on her thin
chest. This time she was dead.
Her mother, who squatted timidly in
the background, began to cry quietly
but was too shy to come forward to
hold her motionless child. Medical
aides carried the body away.
For Dr. Andre Pieren of France, there
was no time tor reflection about the
little girl he couldn't save. By the time
she was carried away he was down on
his knees again beside the next patient.
The little girl, who had trekked for
months with her family through the
Cambodian jungle, trying to escape the
starvation and war of her country,
tound sanctuary in this Thai camp just
Monday morning.
But she was too starved and weak to
know where she was, to move or to
speak, and only stared wide-eyed at the
doctor and aides who worked on her.
She lay tor three hours at a nursing
station in this teeming camp of JO,OOO
refugees before the doctors realized
she was dying. "It this had been a nor
mal hospital under normal conditions

anywhere else in the world, we would
have saved her," said one medical aide.
The little girl was one of 20 retugees
who died Monday in this camp — lying
crammed among more than 1000 other
sick and dying people on mats on the
muddy ground.
The doctors here, too few and with
out the equipment tor proper diagnosis
and care, pick their way carefully
among the patients who lie jumbled to
gether — those with malaria, with
tuberculosis, with acute malnutrition,
with dysentery, retching and defecat
ing where they lie.
"We do what we can," said Jeffrey
Chulay, an American doctor here as a
volunteer, "but it's very trustrating be
cause it is so difficult to know what is
wrong, with the limited equipment we
have.
"We treat lever as malaria. We treat
people who look pale as anemia. It they
don't get better we see what else we
can do.
"I've never seen this many people
this sick," Chulay said.
