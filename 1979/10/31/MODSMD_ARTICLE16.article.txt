# 3.7 percent hike due to fuel prices
## CAB allows air fare increase 
### 
Washington (AP) — Domestic
air travelers will pay 3.7 percent
more for tickets next month
following Civil Aeronauti
Board action Friday to help air
lines cope with the soaring cost
of fuel.
The fare raise was the fourth
across-the-board boost ap
proved by the CAB this year
and brings the total increase
since January to 25.9 percent.
With the latest increase, for
example, the price of a one
way coach ticket between New
York and Los Angeles will rise
from $288 to $298. A
Washington-Chicago flight will
go from $97 to $100, Atlanta-
Dallas from $110 to $114,
Boston-Miami from $161 to
$167 and Cleveland-Detroit
from $37 to $38.
The increase, which the air
lines can implement Nov. 1,
comes as some of the largest
carriers are reporting third
quarter losses or drastically re
duced earnings compared with
the same period last year.
"We need all the help we can
get," United Airlines spokes
man )im Linse said in reporting
that United will file the new
higher tariffs with the CAB on
Monday.
UAL Inc., United's parent
company, reported a net loss
ot $15.9 million in the three
months ended Sept. 30. The
airline itself had a net loss of
$21.5 million, compared with
net earnings of $166.1 million
in the same quarter last year.
The company said fuel costs
were 54 percent higher than a
year ago.

\B said "the price ot jet
: has risen from an average
! 37 cents a gallon in
y to 67 cents in Sep
i ;mber. Many airlines are buy
ing at least some of their tuel at
spot market prices of up to 90
cents a gallon.

The board said it would con
tinue to allow airlines to adjust
their tares to higher fuel pri<;e
on short notice, but it warned
arriers not to implement the
increases until they had prop
erly informed their ticket
agents and the public.
