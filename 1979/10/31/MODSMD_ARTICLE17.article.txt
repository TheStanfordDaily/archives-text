## We can go shopping again 
### 
Marguerite shuttle bus service to the
Stanford Shopping Center will be
reinstated tomorrow. The resumption of
that service is welcome news.
The run to the shopping center had
been dropped Sept. 1, due to "rising
costs, coupled with inadequate rider
ship/' according to Vice President for
Business and Finance William Massy. A
shuttle to the Southern Pacific train
depot in Palo Alto had been started ear
lier in the summer, and will continue.
The shopping center shuttle obviously
provides a service to shoppers who
would have no alternate transportation
to the center, other than by car.
The Cnmmittee on Parking and Trans

portation should be commended for its
responsiveness to a petition circulated
to reinstate the shopping center shuttle.
A number of letters and phone calls were
also directed to the committee.
Students and others who would
otherwise travel to the center by car are
urged to take advantage of the shuttle,
which runs between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30
p.m. weekdays.
At the time of the cancellation, rider
ship had been increasing due to gas
shortages. With the prospect of future
shortages, rising costs of gas and the
genuine need for conservation, a high
level of ridership should ensure that the
shuttle will keep running.
