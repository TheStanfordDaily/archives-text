## Dayan takes step in right direction 
### 
The intricate details behind
the recent resignation ot
Moshe Dayan as the Israeli
foreign minister will take quite
some time to become known
to the public. But judging by
Dayan's characteristic reserve,
some ot those details may
never be known.
(or one thing, he is sick,
though he is not dying. But
sickness has never been a
reason lor any Israeli politi
cian's stepping out ol a posi
tion. So, what are the reasons?
Or, what could they be?
When lirst asked by jour
nalists lor explanation, Dayan
mentioned, rather brielly, the
necessity tor coming to terms
with the Arabs among whom
he said Israel must live.
That's hardly news since
every Israeli politician says his
purpose is to lind peace with
the Arabs. It is the method ol
achieving that peace which
matters, not the purpose. The
latter is taken tor granted.
With a preview ol the Israeli
Supreme Court's decision on
the illegality ot seizing Arab land
lor the establishment ol new
lewish non-delense-related
settlements, it became clearer
to Dayan that Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin s
tough-guy method ot achiev
ing peace with the Arabs by
pushing them out ol their land
is not going to work.
It doesn't even convince
many ol the more enlightened
Israelis, let alone the rest ol the
world where even Israel's best
Iriend and patronizer (the land
that produced bothGolda Meir
and |ohn Waynei has consis
tently objected to Israeli set
tlements in the occupied Arab
lands.
Though Dayan is known lor
his tough dealing with the
Palestinians, he now, alter a
lifetime ot lighting them, is
not sure that lighting is the best
way to deal with them.
There are other things on
Dayan's mind. All Arabs now,
outside the Egyptian leader
ship, know that the Camp
David agreement was a sell-out
ot the Palestinians.
Not a single Palestinian has
agreed to join the Israeli-
Egyptian talks on the luture ol
the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
And Begin s tough methods
(destroying Lebanon and erect
ing more settlements on Arab
lands) are not making things
easier.
Another thing that bothers
Dayan's mind is the Islamic

revivalist movement that
seems to be sweeping the Mus
lim world. Reaching an agree
ment with the Palestinians will
not stop that movement but it
will make things easier on Is
rael both internally, where it
will have to deal with more
than two million Muslim Pales
tinians, and on its borders,
with its predominantly Muslim
Arab states which may end up
united under a Khomeini-type
ot government.
Internally, Dayan is aware ot
something else, something
people outside Israel rarely
know: there is a moral di
lemma in Israel, especially
among the young and the edu
cated.
The ideals that these young
people are taught to cherish
come daily into clash with the
realities ot Israeli lite. I reedom
is gained at the expense ot lour
million Palestinians who are
either homeless refugees or a
(onquered people inside Is
rael. Land is acquired by push
ing its owners out ot it. Security
is achieved by destroying other
people and other people's
land.
Unlike immigrant parents,
these young Israelis are bored
and even appalled with the
war-like Israeli way ot lite.
"Lear" tor Israel and their lite
still takes them to victories, but
how long can the propaganda
departments ot the Israeli gov
ernment sustain that state ot
tear?
There is also a growing con
cern about the tact that al
though a democracy, Israel is a
military state, governed by
military men, lor military pur
poses and a concern that un
less peace with the Arabs is
reached, this military way ol
lite will continue.
One thing Dayan knows is
that ignoring the PLO does not
work. Not only are there more
governments (hat recognize it
than governments that recog
nize Israel, there is also an in
creasing amount ol pressure
on Israel to come to terms with
the PLO by some ol Israel's
most faithful supporters. At
some point, Israel will have to
comply with their wishes.
Despite all these possible
reasons lor his resignation,
Dayan does not seem to have a
vision ot the luture ot
Palestinian-Israeli co-existence
will be or should be like.
In his interview with ABC's
Barbara Walters, Dayan ap
peared to be contused and un
decided. He disagreed with

Begin's intent to annex the
West Bank and Gaza to Israel.
Me said he does not want |or
dan to have the West Bank. Nor
does he want a Palestinian state
to be erected there.
The latter point is particu
larly disappointing to an in
creasing number of observers
who leel that unless an inde
pendent Palestinian state is al
lowed to be created in the
West Bank and Gaza, the
Mideast will continue to boil in
trouble like it ha*- since Israel
was established in 1948.

However, the mere tact that
a man of Dayan's weight in Is
raeli politics has resigned, bas
ically because he disagrees
with the obviously non
working inflexible policies ot
his boss, is in itselt a positive
development that will hope
fully aid, somehow, the effort
to bring the Israelis and the
Palestinians into some accept
able peacetul coexistence in
Palestine.

cern about the tact that al
though a democracy, Israel is a
military state, governed by
military men, lor military pur
poses and a concern that un
less peace with the Arabs is
reached, this military way ol
lite will continue.
One thing Dayan knows is
that ignoring the PLO does not
work. Not only are there more
governments (hat recognize it
than governments that recog
nize Israel, there is also an in
creasing amount ol pressure
on Israel to come to terms with
the PLO by some ol Israel's
most faithful supporters. At
some point, Israel will have to
comply with their wishes.
Despite all these possible
reasons lor his resignation,
Dayan does not seem to have a
vision ot the luture ot
Palestinian-Israeli co-existence
will be or should be like.
In his interview with ABC's
Barbara Walters, Dayan ap
peared to be contused and un
decided. He disagreed with

Begin's intent to annex the
West Bank and Gaza to Israel.
Me said he does not want |or
dan to have the West Bank. Nor
does he want a Palestinian state
to be erected there.
The latter point is particu
larly disappointing to an in
creasing number of observers
who leel that unless an inde
pendent Palestinian state is al
lowed to be created in the
West Bank and Gaza, the
Mideast will continue to boil in
trouble like it ha*- since Israel
was established in 1948.

However, the mere tact that
a man of Dayan's weight in Is
raeli politics has resigned, bas
ically because he disagrees
with the obviously non
working inflexible policies ot
his boss, is in itselt a positive
development that will hope
fully aid, somehow, the effort
to bring the Israelis and the
Palestinians into some accept
able peacetul coexistence in
Palestine.

The intricate details behind
the recent resignation ot
Moshe Dayan as the Israeli
foreign minister will take quite
some time to become known
to the public. But judging by
Dayan's characteristic reserve,
some ot those details may
never be known.
(or one thing, he is sick,
though he is not dying. But
sickness has never been a
reason lor any Israeli politi
cian's stepping out ol a posi
tion. So, what are the reasons?
Or, what could they be?
When lirst asked by jour
nalists lor explanation, Dayan
mentioned, rather brielly, the
necessity tor coming to terms
with the Arabs among whom
he said Israel must live.
That's hardly news since
every Israeli politician says his
purpose is to lind peace with
the Arabs. It is the method ol
achieving that peace which
matters, not the purpose. The
latter is taken tor granted.
With a preview ol the Israeli
Supreme Court's decision on
the illegality ot seizing Arab land
lor the establishment ol new
lewish non-delense-related
settlements, it became clearer
to Dayan that Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin s
tough-guy method ot achiev
ing peace with the Arabs by
pushing them out ol their land
is not going to work.
It doesn't even convince
many ol the more enlightened
Israelis, let alone the rest ol the
world where even Israel's best
Iriend and patronizer (the land
that produced bothGolda Meir
and |ohn Waynei has consis
tently objected to Israeli set
tlements in the occupied Arab
lands.
Though Dayan is known lor
his tough dealing with the
Palestinians, he now, alter a
lifetime ot lighting them, is
not sure that lighting is the best
way to deal with them.
There are other things on
Dayan's mind. All Arabs now,
outside the Egyptian leader
ship, know that the Camp
David agreement was a sell-out
ot the Palestinians.
Not a single Palestinian has
agreed to join the Israeli-
Egyptian talks on the luture ol
the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
And Begin s tough methods
(destroying Lebanon and erect
ing more settlements on Arab
lands) are not making things
easier.
Another thing that bothers
Dayan's mind is the Islamic

revivalist movement that
seems to be sweeping the Mus
lim world. Reaching an agree
ment with the Palestinians will
not stop that movement but it
will make things easier on Is
rael both internally, where it
will have to deal with more
than two million Muslim Pales
tinians, and on its borders,
with its predominantly Muslim
Arab states which may end up
united under a Khomeini-type
ot government.
Internally, Dayan is aware ot
something else, something
people outside Israel rarely
know: there is a moral di
lemma in Israel, especially
among the young and the edu
cated.
The ideals that these young
people are taught to cherish
come daily into clash with the
realities ot Israeli lite. I reedom
is gained at the expense ot lour
million Palestinians who are
either homeless refugees or a
(onquered people inside Is
rael. Land is acquired by push
ing its owners out ot it. Security
is achieved by destroying other
people and other people's
land.
Unlike immigrant parents,
these young Israelis are bored
and even appalled with the
war-like Israeli way ot lite.
"Lear" tor Israel and their lite
still takes them to victories, but
how long can the propaganda
departments ot the Israeli gov
ernment sustain that state ot
tear?
There is also a growing con
cern about the tact that al
though a democracy, Israel is a
military state, governed by
military men, lor military pur
poses and a concern that un
less peace with the Arabs is
reached, this military way ol
