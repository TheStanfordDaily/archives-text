Examine TDS
TDS, Inc. has shown the
same clumsy inability to man
age Tresidder tood service op
erations that we've seen in
President jimmy Carter's Mail
ing ettorts to handle energy
and inllation problems. Both
seem to have adopted the
same solution: start tiring
people in the hopes that the
problems will somehow go
away.
Don't get me wrong. I be
lieve the service in the Cotlee
House was inexcusably bad
over the past two years that I
have been on campus. Im
provements and changes were
badly needed, and the current
boycott has served mainly to
remind me of numerous resol
utions "never again" to pat
ronize the place alter waiting
halt an hour lor the three
people ahead ot me to be
served.
At the same time, however,
it's wrong to lay the lull blame
on the Cotlee House stall, be
cause service has been equally
poor throughout the TDS do
main.
Strikingly high prices, in
terior lood, indillerent service,
argumentative cashiers, laugh
ably inappropriate menu selec

lions — these problems cer
tainly characterize the Transi
tion operation, perhaps even
more so than the Cotlee
House.
I have wondered whether
either ol these opera
tions would have been run any
dillerently il TDS had hired a
consultant to suggest ways ol
driving customers away.
TDS' "open statements" that
appeared in the Daily last week
have done nothing but confirm
my impression ol TDS as
inept, unable to cultivate
any sort ot healthy and produc
tive employer-employee rela
tionship, yet unatraid to
exploit its monopoly position
through shameless price
gouging.
The Cotlee House was
poorly managed, yes, but so
were its managers -- that's
what the "open statement" re
ally says.
Whatever the resolution ot
the current Cotlee House dis
pute, a central difficulty re
mains. We simply have no as
surance that conditions will
not become just as bad in the
luture, leading to the same sort
ot desperate act — tiring
everybody — that we have just
witnessed.
One wonders whether this

company might not be
pathologically incapable ol
implementing the fundamen
tals ot a successful lood service
operation.
Indeed, University officials
and members of the Stanford
community would do well to
examine the overall TDS re
cord carefully, in case the pre
sent Coffee House llap rellects
more serious underlying prob
lems with this contractor.

Terra House has had a policy
for the past several years that
flyers and other advertising
matter be confined to our two
centrally located bulletin
boards. Small notices on those
boards make this clear.
We do this for two reasons:
(1) We want our house to look
like a house, not like an adver
tising agency; (2) We hold the
principle thai paper is not to be
wasted in such an obviously
unnecessary manner.
Recently, for example, rov
ing ASSU candidates were
made aware ot this, and tor the
most part, they respected our

wishes.
This past Saturday, however,
two pre-teenage boys were
placing Coffee House ads on
every doorknob inside and
outside ot our house.
These flyers, shaped like
"Do Not Disturb" signs, re
mind us ot sleazy motel decor.
The 40 of them totalling 13
square teet ot wasted wood
pulp exceed Terra's yearly use
of paper napkins by precisely
13 square teet.
Does anyone need 40 nap
kins? If not, Terra will recycle
the wasted paper.

have been on campus. Im
provements and changes were
badly needed, and the current
boycott has served mainly to
remind me of numerous resol
utions "never again" to pat
ronize the place alter waiting
halt an hour lor the three
people ahead ot me to be
served.
At the same time, however,
it's wrong to lay the lull blame
on the Cotlee House stall, be
cause service has been equally
poor throughout the TDS do
main.
Strikingly high prices, in
terior lood, indillerent service,
argumentative cashiers, laugh
ably inappropriate menu selec

lions — these problems cer
tainly characterize the Transi
tion operation, perhaps even
more so than the Cotlee
House.
I have wondered whether
either ol these opera
tions would have been run any
dillerently il TDS had hired a
consultant to suggest ways ol
driving customers away.
TDS' "open statements" that
appeared in the Daily last week
have done nothing but confirm
my impression ol TDS as
inept, unable to cultivate
any sort ot healthy and produc
tive employer-employee rela
tionship, yet unatraid to
exploit its monopoly position
through shameless price
gouging.
The Cotlee House was
poorly managed, yes, but so
were its managers -- that's
what the "open statement" re
ally says.
Whatever the resolution ot
the current Cotlee House dis
pute, a central difficulty re
mains. We simply have no as
surance that conditions will
not become just as bad in the
luture, leading to the same sort
ot desperate act — tiring
everybody — that we have just
witnessed.
One wonders whether this

company might not be
pathologically incapable ol
implementing the fundamen
tals ot a successful lood service
operation.
Indeed, University officials
and members of the Stanford
community would do well to
examine the overall TDS re
cord carefully, in case the pre
sent Coffee House llap rellects
more serious underlying prob
lems with this contractor.

Paper waste
Terra House has had a policy
for the past several years that
flyers and other advertising
matter be confined to our two
centrally located bulletin
boards. Small notices on those
boards make this clear.
We do this for two reasons:
(1) We want our house to look
like a house, not like an adver
tising agency; (2) We hold the
principle thai paper is not to be
wasted in such an obviously
unnecessary manner.
Recently, for example, rov
ing ASSU candidates were
made aware ot this, and tor the
most part, they respected our

wishes.
This past Saturday, however,
two pre-teenage boys were
placing Coffee House ads on
every doorknob inside and
outside ot our house.
These flyers, shaped like
"Do Not Disturb" signs, re
mind us ot sleazy motel decor.
The 40 of them totalling 13
square teet ot wasted wood
pulp exceed Terra's yearly use
of paper napkins by precisely
13 square teet.
Does anyone need 40 nap
kins? If not, Terra will recycle
the wasted paper.
