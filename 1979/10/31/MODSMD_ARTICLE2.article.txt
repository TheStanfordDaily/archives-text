# Examining potential for student-run eatery
## Task force to scrutinize Coffee House 
### Mike Vaska 
An ASSU task force is currently
being formed to examine the "finan
cial potential for a student-run Cof
fee House," said Laura Mead, Coun
cil of Presidents (COP) member. The
task force will include COP mem
bers, ASSU Senators, ex-Coffee
House workers and interested stu
dents, she said.
On |uly 27, the entire Coffee
House staff was fired by TDS, the
company contracted to run the busi
ness. This action triggered a con
troversy involving the former
employees, TDS, the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) and a fact
finding committee of University ad
ministrators.
According to Mead, problems with
the Coffee House began two years
ago. "Students were more and more
dissatisfied with what they were re
ceiving," she said.
"Questions have arisen over the
rate of price increases," and TDS has
shown a "lack of response" to con
sumers, Mead added.
As a result of the current con
troversy, many people are "re
thinking" the amount of control that
a contractor should have over the

operations of the Coffee House, said
COP member Tom Cart.
This increased interest comes "at
the proper time", according to Cart,
because a new contract will be
signed in April to manage the food
service operations at Tresidder and
Encina Commons and to provide cat
ering services on campus.
The purpose of the task force is to
guide former Coffee House workers
and concerned students "in a more
positive direction" toward determin
ing how the Coffee House can better
serve the students, he said.
"The task force needs to under
take consideration of the problems
involved with splitting up the con
tract," said Dan Williams, manager of
Tresidder. According to Williams,
"the Coffee House is the most attrac
tive segment" of the present con
tract, because it tends to be more
popular and less expensive to main
tain than the other campus food ser
vice operations.
Williams estimated that the Coffee
House will gross $400,000 in sales this
year, compared to an estimated
$500,000 at the Transition.
"Maybe students weren't playing
enough of a role in decision making"

at the Coffee House and Tresidder
Union, he said. However, "Tresidder
never was conceived to be just for
students."
"There is an ill-conceived notion
that it is a student union. Philosophi
cally it was not designed to be that
way," Williams continued. It was de
signed to be a University-widecenter
of activity, he said.
Although Tresidder receives rent
from tenants and about 10 percent of
gross sales from the Coffee House
and the Transition, it will still cost the
University $4%,000 for this year, said
Williams. Students pay some of this
amount indirectly through tuition
and fees, he added.
At UC-Berkeley and other schools,
students have more control over
their student unions because they
pay a direct subsidy each quarter to
help pay operating costs, Williams
said.
To increase campus input in the
food service operations of TDS, the
Food Service Operations Committee
(FSOC) was formed last spring, said
Mead. The committee is "composed
of staff, faculty and a majority of it is
students," she said.
Williams said he hopes that before
the end of this quarter, the FSOC will
become part of an advisory board to
give direction to Tresidder Union.
The long-term goal of this board will
be to see that Tresidder Union is op
erated consistently with University
policy, he said.
A recently released preliminary
consulting report varifies some of
the complaints about the Coffee
House cited by Mead. The study,
conducted by Paul Cleary, Director
of Food Service for the University of
Wisconsin system, investigated
problems at both the Coffee House
and the Transition.
The report states that the "contrac
tor (TDS) is providing an above aver

age menu selection" and is doing
"an effective job . . . to merchandise
products with attractive display."
But the report also states that
"operating costs must be controlled
by corrective actions rather than con
tinued sales price increases" and
urges that there be "roll backs on
items when over-pricing has occur
red."
Problems with theft by employees
and food waste were also cited in the
report as reasons for high food
prices.
