## Scott Zarrow and Eric Miethke Conservatives haunt 'Issues of '80s' 
### 
It is indeed appropriate that
the Hoover Institute and the
Alumni Association choose the
Halloween season for the
gathering of the conservative
coven to discuss "Issues of the
'80s.''
Not since Macbeth have so
many charlatans gathered
around a steaming pot of is
sues, only to brew up so much
steam and so little substance.

The distinguished lineup of
conjectural conjurers reads
like a roll call in a William F.
Buckley tantasy: Friedman,
Boskin, Campbell, Duignan,
Rabushka and Shultz, to name
but a lew.
Asking a cast with such a
wide diversity ol views to pre
dict the '80s is somewhat akin
to asking the Grand Inquisitor
his views on torture as a means
ot achieving salvation.
But bubble, bubble, toil and
trouble, and voila! Out pops
the biggies tor the forthcoming
decade — Soviet military
superiority and Proposition 13.
Ftoover Fellows Peter Duig
nan and Alvin Rabushka made
these two issues the themes of
Iheir upcoming book (77)e Un
ited States in the 1980s soon
available for twenty ot your
inflation-crippled dollars) as
well as of a recent Alumni As
sociation conference.
Both were augmented with
trajectories lor the big cor
nucopia by Hoover Fellow Mil
ton Friedman and other
status quo soothsayers.
We acknowledge that these
issues are important. Soviet
military buildup (an issue of

the Cold War years and still an
occasional lunchroom topic at
Hoover) is distressing and has
contributed to a loss of U.S.
credibility abroad.
But so have Vietnam, Chile
and Iran, as well as other coun
tries where we have cast our
magical spell, only to find the
Third World resentful of the
lorm our presence took.
This problem, however, will
not be solved by building
"more tanks than cars" as
Duignan suggests.
The other speakers were
cheerleaders for the same old,
tired conservative themes: li
mited government, deregula
tion ot the economy and medi
cal tield, and individual free
dom and responsibility.
Rabushka, in a leap of faith ot
Olympic magnitude, attri
buted Calitornia's low un
employment rate to Proposi
tion 13, in spite of a Depart
ment ot Economic and Busi
ness Development survey that
showed only 16 percent ot the
corporations surveyed report
ing a significant impact by
Prop. 13 on their business.
Kabushka further called tor
"renewed competition" and

"decreased regulation" <jt a
time when Texaco reported
third quarter profits up 212
percent and airline deregula
tion has sent the cost ot a plane
ticket to Southern California so
high that flying home for the
holidays requires the saje ot
your first-born male child.
Individual freedom and re
sponsibility? We're all for it,
and justice as well. But as
Richard Pryor once pointed
out, "Who says there ain'f'no
justice in America? Look'at
who's in the ghetto and in jail
— just us."
The old standby about
"equality of opportunity" in a
land of such blatant in
equalities must be cruel corn
tort to those laced with the
treedom and responsibility to
choose between medical care,
heating oil or tood.
What the witches and war
locks of Hoover and the
Alumni Association must
realize is that problems don't
disappear with a wave of the
Invisible Hand and incantation
about commodities futures.
Granted, thus far the gov
ernment has mastered "re
verse alchemy" while trying to
solve social problems: th£y
turn gold into crap. But the
answer certainly isn't to turn
the "tree market" loose to al
locate resources by the ability
to pay rather than by social
need.
By the same token, while
military preparedness helps jo
establish U.S. credibility as a
leader, world respect will I
never be gained it we insist on
arming to the teeth so the Third
World will be "free" to de
velop in our image — complete
with income inequalities,
waste, conspicuous consump
tion, inflation and prejudice.;
The Hoover Institute's com
prehensive solution tor the
'80s would involve a "Nuke 'em
til they glow" attack on poor
countries in Atrica, thus
eliminating their poverty,
showing an imperial and deci
sive presidency while checkirjg
Soviet expansion and provid
ing jobs in tank factories to the
U.S. poor.
These prescriptions tor
prosperity would also give the
Hoover crew and the Alumni
Association the opportunity to
take another well-balanced
and objective, yet myopic and
astigmatic, peek into the fu
ture.
But the next time a holiday is
selected for the presentation,
we hope they choose some
thing more appropriate — such
as April 1.
