## Bridge must maintain autonomy 
### 
The Budge oilers much to
the Stanford community
peer counseling, an all-night
crisis phone line, a wide selec
tion of workshops, outreach
programs for residences and
groups, a training class in
counseling and listening skills.
All this is lairly well known.
Not as well known, however,
is what the Bridge otters to
those who work, staff, and live
there — community, involve
ment and a unique environ

ment lor learning.
It is my concern that this un
ique environment may be ir
reparably damaged or de
stroyed, and through this letter
! .imply wish to make people
aware ot what is being
threatened.
Some background: The
Bridge is a volunteer student
organization. Virtually none ot
the people who run the Bridge
receive nny compensation, in
either money or units, from the

University.
Live-ins, very much like RAs,
receive compensation in the
form ot tree housing, but that
is all.
The Bridge is also over 90
percent self-funded. The
three-day Spring Faire gener
ates between $11,000 and
$14,000 a year, which goes to
ward operating expenses, as
does $1000 trom the ASSU. The
Bridge therefore is almost to
tally self-supporting.
Most importantly, the Bridge
is self-administrated.
The Bridge trains its own
people through the classes
which, with the exception of
Dr. Vince D'Andrea, are taught
by Bridge staffers and live-ins.
Bridge people organize and
run the Spring Faire — inter
viewing craftspeople, obtain
ing publicity, setting it up,
making sure it goes smoothly.
Students run the organiza
tion — arranging workshops,
putting out the brochures each
quarter, conducting surveys to
see how to better serve the
Stantord community, arrang
ing for and supporting staffers,
and ot course, counseling.
Finally, the Bridge sets its
own policies — what hours
we're open, whom we counsel
and whom we refer, what
programs we offer, how we or
ganize and administrate ourse
lves.
The Bridge, through its own
ettorts, must discover its
shortcomings and seek its own
solutions.
We, as members of the
Bridge and as individuals, must
be responsible for, and enti
tled to, both our failures and
our successes. There is no
other way to learn; there is no
other way to live.
The administration would
have otherwise.
Again and again, it fails to
realize that autonomy, in

independence, and freedom are
the essential prerequisites tor
learning; again and again it st
rives lor standardization,
homogenization, control.
Why, when the University
can otter us autonomy and
Ireedom, does it otler us this? I
do not know.
All I know is that, should our
autonomy be taken from us,
the learning, the joy, the care,
the people will go. Wewill die.
