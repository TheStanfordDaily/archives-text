# 'Heavy workload' little problem
## Approval greets pilot course 
### Scott Waxman 
Ten years ago, faculty dissatisfaction and stu
dent protest prompted repeal of the University's
Western Civilization requirement.
Today, students taking Western Culture I, the
pilot course for a proposed reinstatement of the
♦equirement, accept the heavy workload of the
(?o'prse in their enthusiasm for its discussion
oriented format.
After several years of debate over the neces
sity of Western Culture study as part of under
graduate education, the Academic Senate voted
in December 1976 to reinstate the requirement.
A task force was subsequently formed to re
commend the scope and format of the course.
'' In November 1977, this task force submitted a
plan for 80 classes of 20 students each which
would allow all students to fulfill the require
ment, preferably freshman year. This proposal
was vetoed because of the excessive cost of
hiring new faculty for the course.
The task force responded with a secondary
proposal allowing for the requirement to be ful
filled by a maximum of six courses (Humanities
61 to 63, History 1 to 3) which must comply with
explicit academic requirements. The Western
Culture course would be limited to 20 sections
of 20 students each.
A Western Culture pilot course was first of
fered last year to five sections and was expanded
this year to include 400 students in 20 sections. A
different speaker lectures each week.
In January of 1980 the Academic Senate will
make its final decision on the requirement.
Professor Ronald Rebholz, who served on the
Western Culture task force, is in favor or

reinstating the requirement. "I feel it is impor
tant for students to be exposed to the know
ledge and vision that these courses (fulfilling the
requirement) offer," he said.
Rebholz, who coordinates the current West
ern Culture pilot course, explained that the
reading list is determined by the professors
teaching the course each quarter. "There is a
great deal of faculty debate over the optimum
content for the course, but an agreement is
reached," he said.
Western Culture Prof. Sander Goldberg said
the size of the course and its availability to
freshmen are its main strengths.
"Many students get through high school
without having learned to read a text,"
Goldberg said. "The small class allows us to give
the students personal attention to help them
understand the works and to improve their
study skills as well."
Reactions of freshmen taking Western Cul
ture this year range from,"I love the class, I love
the prof, I love Homer and Sophocles . . ." to
"The workload is awesome, but I never regret
taking the course."
Sophomore Jim Lewinson said he considers
the course a necessary ingredient in the math
saturated curriculum required for his computer
science major.
Students from five different sections agreed
almost unanimously that personal contact with
the professor made the course worthwhile. Stu
dents praised the professors for being sensitive
to the needs and fears of freshmen. They also
described the discussions as encouraging in
volvement without creating a pedantic atmos
phere.
