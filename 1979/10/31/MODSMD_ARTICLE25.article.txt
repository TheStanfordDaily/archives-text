# Assemblymember decries back-alley butchers
## Funded abortions essential for women 
### Kathleen McClung 
Restricting MediCal fund
ing for abortions would
"put back-alley butchers
back to work," said Los
Angeles Assemblymember
Maxine Waters in a lecture
here last Wednesday.

Waters, whose assembly
district includes south
central Los Angeles and
Watts, addressed a noon
audience of 150 in Terman
Auditorium.
In a speech entitled "Pub
lic Policy Issues: Minority
Women," Waters focused
on California's current legis
lative debate on abortion
funding, because she be
lieves the issue "centers in
on minority women."
"Black women are in
terested in all issues affect
ing women but they must
always be concerned about
the bread and butter is
sues," explained Waters.
Abortion is one of these
"bread and butter issues,"
she asserted.
"Californians pride them
selves on being open
minded. Restricting Medi-
Cal funds for abortions
would be an ugly blot on

our reputation," she said.
Political opportunism,
along with "ignorance and
an utter lack of understand-
some lawmakers
threaten legal abortions for
poor women, Waters states.
"Some legislators just want
to be in the right place at the
right time."
A small-but-vocal consti
tuency of conservative
groups plays off these legis
lators, she observed.
Waters acknowledged
that many who oppose
abortion do so for sincere
religious or moral reasons,
"but," she contended, "re
ligious beliefs have no place
in state statutes. Restricting
medical care on moral at
titudes is unprecedented."
It is notable, she said, that
"the same people who
don't want to fund abortion
don't want to fund child
care, welfare, affirmative ac

tion. They are not only racist
but they're anti
progressive."
Describing visits to hous
ing projects in her district,
Waters said, "I witness lots
of teen-age pregnancies. I
see babies not cared for
properly, babies left to
grandmothers or great
grandmothers to raise.
Abortion is not talked about
in the black community.
"It is absolutely essential
that we inform women
about their sexuality, so
they can make informed
choices. But they must also
have alternatives after they
become pregnant," she
said.
Waters, a Democrat,
serves as Assembly Majority
Whip and sits on several As
sembly committees, includ
ing the Health and Labor
committees.
