## Kuhn misses jackpot in Mays' gambling fiasco 
### 
- Chris Haft

Rich mart, poor man,
beggar man, thief; doctor,
lawyer, Indian chief. With
the possible exception of
the second and third ones,
these occupations have
probably attracted most
males at one time or
another — particularly dur
ing early youth, when we
wanted to be a fireman one
day, a policeman another
day, Batman the next, and
so on.
There is an addition to
this list: Willie Mays. Surely
millions of people have
wished, if only for a mo
ment, that they could be
transported into No. 24's
body and perform the mar
velous feats he did.
Nothing that Bowie Kuhn
does, however, can be
termed marvelous. Kuhn's
ordering Mays out of
baseball for accepting an
executive position with
Bally International, an Atla

tic City gambling casino
hotel corporation, repre
sents another blunder by
the major leagues' head
honcho. Though Mays' de
parture won't negatively af
fect baseball, the incident
serves as an annoying re
minder that a hypocritical
buffoon inhabits the com
missioner's chair.
Enthusiasm for baseball
has dramatically increased
in recent years, as evi
denced by the attendance
records set by both major
leagues. This resurgence
has occurred despite
Kuhn's presence. His idea
of consideration for the fans
is giving them the All-Star
vote, which has become a
travesty, as undeserving
players continue to win
starting berths.
Another recent example
of Kuhn's inadequacy is his
fining of Montreal Expo
pitcher Bill Lee, who admit

ted that he smoked
marijuana. If Kuhn wants to
uphold baseball's image,
which was his concern in
punishing Lee, he should
shift his attention to the
World Series.
The World Series is sup
posed to be baseball's finest
moment, and it usually is.
Yet recall the 1976 and 1979
Fall Classics, which were
played under Arctic condi
tions. The field was com
posed not of grass or artifi
cial turf, but tundra. The
players emerged not from
dugouts, but from igloos.
We have Kuhn, the man
who caused the Series to be
played a night, to thank for
presenting this frigid image
of the game.
Now Kuhn continues his
quest to keep baseball
Simon-pure by forcing Mays
out of his job with the New
York Mets. As he did in the
Lee case, Kuhn is placing his

focus on the wrong subject.
Certainly gambling, if it is
allowed to infiltrate profes
sional sports, will ruin them
altogether. The fear that
games will be "fixed," thus
eliminating the essential
and wonderful uncertainty
ofan athletic event, isavalid
one.
But this isn't Al Capone or
Joe Conforte that Kuhn is
dealing with, it's Willie
Mays. Mays could no more
corrupt baseball than
Dorothy in The Wizard of
Oz could hurt her dog Toto.
His role with Bally will be
with public relations, not
with aces and one-eyed
jacks.
Howard Cosell, of all
people, made a good point
while interviewing Kuhn at
halftime of ABC's Monday
Night Football game. Cosell
asked Kuhn how he could
justify ordering Mays out of
baseball while allowing

owners such as George
Steinbrenner (Yankees) and
John Galbreath (Pirates) to
continue their ties with
thoroughbred racing.
In fine Watergate fashion,
Kuhn never answered the
question, choosing instead
to discuss how he advised
certain owners to relinquish
their gambling interests
when he took over,
Mays probably knew he
would have his hand slap
ped by Kuhn for accepting
the position with Bally.
However, for $100,000 a
year for 10 years, $500 a
month for expenses and a
two-bedroom apartment,
Mays can afford to endure
some sore knuckles.
Kuhn's ignorance is as
odd as a basket catch (the
kind Willie used to make)
and as inexcusable as mis
sing the cutoff man. Say
hey, Mr. Kuhn, you belong
in Class A ball.

players emerged not from
dugouts, but from igloos.
We have Kuhn, the man
who caused the Series to be
played a night, to thank for
presenting this frigid image
of the game.
Now Kuhn continues his
quest to keep baseball
Simon-pure by forcing Mays
out of his job with the New
York Mets. As he did in the
Lee case, Kuhn is placing his

focus on the wrong subject.
Certainly gambling, if it is
allowed to infiltrate profes
sional sports, will ruin them
altogether. The fear that
games will be "fixed," thus
eliminating the essential
and wonderful uncertainty
ofan athletic event, isavalid
one.
But this isn't Al Capone or
Joe Conforte that Kuhn is
dealing with, it's Willie
Mays. Mays could no more
corrupt baseball than
Dorothy in The Wizard of
Oz could hurt her dog Toto.
His role with Bally will be
with public relations, not
with aces and one-eyed
jacks.
Howard Cosell, of all
people, made a good point
while interviewing Kuhn at
halftime of ABC's Monday
Night Football game. Cosell
asked Kuhn how he could
justify ordering Mays out of
baseball while allowing

owners such as George
Steinbrenner (Yankees) and
John Galbreath (Pirates) to
continue their ties with
thoroughbred racing.
In fine Watergate fashion,
Kuhn never answered the
question, choosing instead
to discuss how he advised
certain owners to relinquish
their gambling interests
when he took over,
Mays probably knew he
would have his hand slap
ped by Kuhn for accepting
the position with Bally.
However, for $100,000 a
year for 10 years, $500 a
month for expenses and a
two-bedroom apartment,
Mays can afford to endure
some sore knuckles.
Kuhn's ignorance is as
odd as a basket catch (the
kind Willie used to make)
and as inexcusable as mis
sing the cutoff man. Say
hey, Mr. Kuhn, you belong
in Class A ball.

Rich mart, poor man,
beggar man, thief; doctor,
lawyer, Indian chief. With
the possible exception of
the second and third ones,
these occupations have
probably attracted most
males at one time or
another — particularly dur
ing early youth, when we
wanted to be a fireman one
day, a policeman another
day, Batman the next, and
so on.
There is an addition to
this list: Willie Mays. Surely
millions of people have
wished, if only for a mo
ment, that they could be
transported into No. 24's
body and perform the mar
velous feats he did.
Nothing that Bowie Kuhn
does, however, can be
termed marvelous. Kuhn's
ordering Mays out of
baseball for accepting an
executive position with
Bally International, an Atla

tic City gambling casino
hotel corporation, repre
sents another blunder by
the major leagues' head
honcho. Though Mays' de
parture won't negatively af
fect baseball, the incident
serves as an annoying re
minder that a hypocritical
buffoon inhabits the com
missioner's chair.
Enthusiasm for baseball
has dramatically increased
in recent years, as evi
denced by the attendance
records set by both major
leagues. This resurgence
has occurred despite
Kuhn's presence. His idea
of consideration for the fans
is giving them the All-Star
vote, which has become a
travesty, as undeserving
players continue to win
starting berths.
Another recent example
of Kuhn's inadequacy is his
fining of Montreal Expo
pitcher Bill Lee, who admit

ted that he smoked
marijuana. If Kuhn wants to
uphold baseball's image,
which was his concern in
punishing Lee, he should
shift his attention to the
World Series.
The World Series is sup
posed to be baseball's finest
moment, and it usually is.
Yet recall the 1976 and 1979
Fall Classics, which were
played under Arctic condi
tions. The field was com
posed not of grass or artifi
cial turf, but tundra. The
players emerged not from
dugouts, but from igloos.
We have Kuhn, the man
who caused the Series to be
played a night, to thank for
presenting this frigid image
of the game.
Now Kuhn continues his
quest to keep baseball
