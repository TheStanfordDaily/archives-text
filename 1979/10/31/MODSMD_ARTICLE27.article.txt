## Spikers drum Fresno in four 
### Edie Bogart 
On a day that the Cardinals
were "psyched to win," in the
words of sophomore setter
Paula Carmack, Stanford de
feated Fresno State 13-15,15-8,
15-13 and 17-15 Tuesday after
noon at Maples Pavilion.
In defeating Fresno for the
second time this season, the
Cards evened their NorCal
Conference record at 4-4 and
upped their season record to
10-7 overall.
In the first game, Jan Linden
spiked hard and freshman Kisi
Haine dived for several spikes,
but the team didn't play to
gether as well as it did later in
the match.
The Cards had trouble pas
sing the ball to the setter and
there were a few bad calls by
back-row players. Deanna
Boyette entered halfway in the
game, replacing Haine.
Boyette, an incredible
freshman starter, placed some
very accurate hits.
The pace slowed down in the
second game, when Fresno
dinked the ball into a gap in the
Cards' defense. The oppo
nents also blocked the ball
well, although senior Jane Bas
sett was hitting hard-driven
spikes. The rallies were slow
and neither team played
smoothly.
The Cards' momentum
picked up again, when the

score was 8-7. Carmack and
Linden, in a play that worked
throughout the match, showed
the spectators howa set should
be hit. Sherry Norman and
Tammy Jernigan blocked the
ball excellently, and Bassett
also hit well.
There were some tense mo
ments near the end of the
game, when a ball hit the line,
but was called out by the back
row Cards. The team also
tended to bunch when a tough
spike came over; no one was
left to cover the back court.
The spikers really came to
gether in the third game. Lin
den and Carmack played well
together, as Linden seemed
very confident and spiked hard
into the Fresno defense and
Carmack blocked several
tough hits and Jernigan dug
Fresno's serves with determi
nation.
Norman and Boyette
blocked well, and Boyette hit
to the opponents' weak spots.
Linden covered Fresno's tricky
dinks perfectly.
The score reached 12-12 and
Stanford seemed to lose its
concentration. But as Fresno
started to scramble for the ball,
Haine served the winning
points with power and preci
sion. With a spike that nar-

rowly missed the court, Fresno
lost this crucial game 13-15.
The final game began with
excellent playing by the spik
ers. Boyette, Linden, Norman
and )ernigan were all spiking
powerfully. With a 5-0 lead, the
momentum was lost again, as
two Cards shouted "Set!"
while they watched the ball hit
the floor. Tucker Ford,
freshman, was substituted for
Boyette. Jernigan spiked right
into the opponents' block so
that the ball fell straight down
on their side. The score be
came 6-5 and Stanford again
did not take advantage of their
lead. AtB-9, the Cards bunched
and lost the point.
Boyette began hitting regu
larly and the score was tied at
11-11. At 12-12, Boyette served
into the net. The tension in
creased as the Cards struggled
to maintain a tie, 13-13. Then
the team started to hustle; Lin
den ran to save a ball just under
the ref. Boyette hit a beautiful
spike to the far left corner, and
the final point was won when a
Fresno spiker hit the ball out.
"We finally have won a close
match; the kind we should
have been winning all season,"
Carmack commented after the
match. The Cards lost to UOP
Thursday night but they are na
tionally ranked. "Today we
were really psyched to win."
