Stanford's first-place
finish at the Pacific-10
Southern Division Cross
Country Championships at
UCLA Saturday was a culmi
nation of a "total team ef
fort" and well-planned
strategy, according to men's
head coach Dean Clark.
"We've been looking and
keying on this meet and we
really tried to prepare for
it," commented Clark,
whose squad hasn't placed
below third in a meet this
season. "The group really
thoughtand reacted com
petitively," he added.
The Cardinals' total of 47
points provided a slim but
nonethelessdefinite margin

of victory over UCLA's 48,
thus averaging their show
ing at the Stanford Invita
tional two weeks ago where
they placed behind the
Bruins by 37 points.
Ari/O ed fifth na
tionally pre-season,
tallied 5. its for third
place while California took

minute faster than his show
ing last year at the meet.

first v\ s Arizona's Thom
Hunt, v\hose course-record
time of 29:27 erased the
mark of 29:59 set by Steve
Prefonatine of Oregon eight
years ago. Hal Schulz of Cal
was third with a time of
30:54.
Berry pointed to solid
mental preparation as one
of fl reasons for his per
form ice. "Mentally I was
pretty psyched up. The
course was hilly and I had
been working on hills. As a
team we're more psyched
than we've ever been,"he
noted.
Senior Roy Kissin was the
next man in for the Cards at
firth place with a 31:11
clocking. Junior Tom Lob

singer, recovering trom a
cold at the time, paced to

other three schools, a big
factor in the Cards' victory.

race for Stanford were
freshmen Bill Graham and
Mike Melendez, who took
24th and 28th respectively,
and sophomore John
Schaer in the 30th slot. Clark
noted that these runners
have been contributing to
the success of the team all

season.
The Cards' next stop on
the way to the nationals will
be Nov. 10 when they host
the Pac-10 and NCAA
District-8 Championships.

UCLA, and Washington
State.
According to the teamand
the coach, the harriers will
be ready. Lobsinger com
mented, "We've got the
spirit this year. This is the
highest we've been in three
years." Berry summed up
the outlook for the team
saying. "People don't know
how good we are."
