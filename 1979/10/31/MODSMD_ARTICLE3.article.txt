# President's commission calls for major changes in nuclear plants
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The presidential commission on
Three Mile Island called yesterday for "fundamental
changes" in the way nuclear plants are built, operated
and regulated, but said adoption of its recommenda
tions still would not "assure the safety of nuclear
power."
The commission told President Carter that broad
range of deficiencies — from licensing and regulating
atomic plants to the training of operators — made an
atomic accident such as the one at Three Mile Island
"eventually inevitable."
The panel called last March's accident the worst to
occur at a U.S. commercial nuclear reactor, but said
health effects probably were limited to "severe mental
stress" to area residents.
Radiation released was so minor that it may never be
possible to detect whether the March 28 accident near
Harrisburg, Pa., will cause additional cases of cancer
among those who live near the facility, the commission
said.
The 12-member panel's finding are advisory and many
of its recommendations, including a proposal that the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission be abolished, would
take congressional approval.
In accepting the report, Carter said the recommenda
tions "will be studied very carefully" and that after an
analysis he will make a report to Congress and the na
tion.
But he said, "Our own assessment and our decisions
on what to do cannot be made immediately, and we'll
have to be very careful and very methodical in our re
commendations to the public."
Panelist Ariaona Gov. Bruce Babbit, at a news confer
ence, expressed the panel's serious concerns about the

NRC. He called the NRC "a headless agency" that "lacks
the sense, direction, the vitality that is necessary to ad
minister safety consideration on a day-to-day basis."
NRC spokesman )oe Fouchard said the agency would
not comment on the criticism until members have a
chance to study the panel's report.
After a six-month investigation that included seven
public hearings and the taking of depositions from more
than 150 government officials, utility employees and
citizens living near the plant, the presidential panel said
it had concluded:
— The company that operated Three Mile Island, Met
ropolitan Edison Co., "did not have sufficient know
ledge, expertise and personnel to operate the plant or
maintain it adequately."
— Emergency response to the accident by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, state and federal emergency
authorities and utility officials "was dominated by an
atmosphere of almost total confusion."
— The "most serious health effect of the accident was
severe mental stress, which was short lived" and that the
amount of radiation released "will have a negligible ef
fect on the physical health of the individuals."
—Though operator errors contributed significantly to
the accident, equally at fault were poorly designed in
struments and the inability of the nuclear power indus
try to heed signals from previous problems at nuclear
facilities.
'Our findings do not, standing alone, require the
conclusion that nuclear power is inherently too danger
ous to permit it to continue and expand as a form of
power generation. Neither do they suggest that the na
tion should move forward aggressively to develop addi
tional commercial nuclear power," the commission
said.
