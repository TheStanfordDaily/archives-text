Phoenix, Ariz. (AP) â€”
Pacific-10 Executive Director
Wiles Hallock said Monday he
is investigating the eligibility of
eight Arizona State University
football players.
It is "possible, but not in
evitable" the probe could lead
to forfeiture of some or all of
the Sun Devils' victories this
season, he told The Phoenix
Gazette.
Hallock would neither iden
tify the players nor state the na
ture of the charges. The inves
tigation was requested by the
Arizona State athletic depart
ment, he said.
"Hopefully, in the next few
days we will have a resolution
on this," Hallock said.
The Sun Devils, who play

Stanford Saturday, are 3-1 in
conference play and have an
outside chance at the Pactfft
title and a Rose Bowl bid ttaat
goes with it.
Hallock said the probe con
cerns a violation of a confer
ence rule and has nothing to
do with any alleged infractions
being investigated by the
NCAA.
The NCAA investigation fol
lows the Oct. 13 dismissal of
Frank Kush as head football
coach at Arizona State, amid
charges that he punched
former punter Kevin Rutledge
and pressured assistant
coaches and players to lie
about the incident.
