Japanese cabinet resigns
Tokyo— Prime Minister Nasayoshi Ohira and his
21-member cabinet resigned en masse yesterday
in a move required by Japan's constitution at the
opening of a newly elected Parliament.
Ohira and his cabinet will remain in office on a
caretaker basis until the Diet, Japan's Parliament,
chooses a new government. But whether Ohira
will be re-elected depends on the outcome of a
power struggle between him and rival leaders of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party who are de
manding that he quit because of the party's set
back in the Oct. 7 elections.
The Diet convened later yesterday, but there
was no indication when the leadership crisis
would be resolved and a new government would
be named.
Ohira has the support of enough elements in his
faction-ridden party to resist the demand for his
resignation and says he intends to stay in office.
But opposition by former Prime Ministers Takeo
Miki and Takeo Fukuda and the former secretary
general of the party, Yasuhiro Nakasone, has
deadlocked the party, preventing agreement on
Ohira's continuance in office.
Chrysler reports record loss
Detroit — Chrysler Corp. said yesterday that it
lost $480.6 million in the third quarter — a loss tor
the single quarter that was larger than any re
ported by a U.S. company for an entire year.
The huge deficit, which had been expected
among industry observers, may help the com
pany's campaign for financial help from the fed
eral government.
In 1975, Singer Co. reported $451.9 million in
losses — the worst previous financial performance
in U.S. corporate history. Bethlehem Steel Corp.
lost $448.2 million in 1977. Both companies
showed profits the next year.
"Chrysler's loss of $4f)0.6 million for the third
quarter is further indication that this company is
on the cutting edge of developments which have
serious possible consequences for the entire in
dustry," Chrysler Board Chairman Lee lacocca
said in a letter to shareholders.
Auto fuel standards may rise
Washington — The Carter administration told
Congress yesterday it is considering setting
tougher auto fuel-economy standards as part of a
campaign to make conservation its No. 1 energy

priority.
Deputy Energy Secretary John Sawhill said
strengthening the standard beyond the 27.5 mile
per-gallon performance specified for 1985 models
under existing laws is being studied.
He also said an effort will be made to apply the
same type of fuel economy standards to light
trucks, beginning in 1982, that now apply to autos.
He said the energy officials would get together
with Transportation Department and Environmen
tal Protection Agency officials to review the situa
tion.
The 27.5 mpg average — which represents the
"fleet average" for an automaker's entire produc
tion — can be raised beyond 1985 by administra
tive action, if neither House of Congress votes to
block such a move within 15 days.
Salvadorans raid U.S. embassy
San Salvador, El Salvador — About iOO militant
leftists attacked the U.S. Embassy yesterday, firing

ing. Two Marines were reported to have been
slightly wounded.
In Washington, State Department officials said
one Marine guard was wounded slightly when a
bullet grazed his ear. They said the Marine proba

There was no report of casualties among the
left-wing invaders.
The 45-minute attack occurred at midday, the
Washington officials said, and Salvadoran soldiers
responded quickly to help the Americans and fired
on the attackers.

Japanese cabinet resigns
Tokyo— Prime Minister Nasayoshi Ohira and his
21-member cabinet resigned en masse yesterday
in a move required by Japan's constitution at the
opening of a newly elected Parliament.
Ohira and his cabinet will remain in office on a
caretaker basis until the Diet, Japan's Parliament,
chooses a new government. But whether Ohira
will be re-elected depends on the outcome of a
power struggle between him and rival leaders of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party who are de
manding that he quit because of the party's set
back in the Oct. 7 elections.
The Diet convened later yesterday, but there
was no indication when the leadership crisis
would be resolved and a new government would
be named.
Ohira has the support of enough elements in his
faction-ridden party to resist the demand for his
resignation and says he intends to stay in office.
But opposition by former Prime Ministers Takeo
Miki and Takeo Fukuda and the former secretary
general of the party, Yasuhiro Nakasone, has
deadlocked the party, preventing agreement on
Ohira's continuance in office.
Chrysler reports record loss
Detroit — Chrysler Corp. said yesterday that it
lost $480.6 million in the third quarter — a loss tor
the single quarter that was larger than any re
ported by a U.S. company for an entire year.
The huge deficit, which had been expected
among industry observers, may help the com
pany's campaign for financial help from the fed
eral government.
In 1975, Singer Co. reported $451.9 million in
losses — the worst previous financial performance
in U.S. corporate history. Bethlehem Steel Corp.
lost $448.2 million in 1977. Both companies
showed profits the next year.
"Chrysler's loss of $4f)0.6 million for the third
quarter is further indication that this company is
on the cutting edge of developments which have
serious possible consequences for the entire in
dustry," Chrysler Board Chairman Lee lacocca
said in a letter to shareholders.
Auto fuel standards may rise
Washington — The Carter administration told
Congress yesterday it is considering setting
tougher auto fuel-economy standards as part of a
campaign to make conservation its No. 1 energy

priority.
Deputy Energy Secretary John Sawhill said
strengthening the standard beyond the 27.5 mile
per-gallon performance specified for 1985 models
under existing laws is being studied.
He also said an effort will be made to apply the
same type of fuel economy standards to light
trucks, beginning in 1982, that now apply to autos.
He said the energy officials would get together
with Transportation Department and Environmen
tal Protection Agency officials to review the situa
tion.
The 27.5 mpg average — which represents the
"fleet average" for an automaker's entire produc
tion — can be raised beyond 1985 by administra
tive action, if neither House of Congress votes to
block such a move within 15 days.
