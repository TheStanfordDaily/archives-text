Dr. Lewis Thomas — scientist,
educator, physician and author —
has accepted President Richard Ly
man's invitation to speak at this
year's commencement exercises.
The content of the speech has not yet
been decided. Thomas and Lyman
will agree upon the topic sometime
later this year.
"We are delighted that lewis
Thomas (will) speak at the 1%0
graduation ceremony," said the
senior class presidents. "l.iven this)
rare qualities, Lewis Thomas will
serve as an inspiration to us all."
Thomas, author of The Lives of a
Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher, and
The Medusa and the Snail: More
Notes of a Biology Watcher, is cur
rently the president and chief execu
tive officer of the Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center, one of the
leading cancer research centers in
the world.
The Lives of a Cell earned him the
National Book Award in 1974 and The
Medusa and the Snail has been

ranked in the top ten for the past 22
weeks by the New York City Book
Review.
Each book is a collection of short
essays which deal with Thomas' ef
forts to find a place for the human
being in a biological world.
"I have the highest regard for his
writing . . . and he is an excellent

"A gifted writer with wit, imagination and a bold,
encouraging vision of both man and nature
- Time

individual/' said Arthur Kornberg, a
professor in the Biochemistry De
partment here.
Alan Alpert, a senior class presi
dent, said Thomas' name was sub
mitted to Lyman because "we
wanted someone outside the usual
political framework."
"He is so interdisciplinary that he
can relate to many people and there
fore have a more widespread ap
peal," said Cray Boyce, another
senior class president.
Alpert added that an advantage of
choosing someone who is relatively
unknown is that "it gives us a chance
to say who he is and what he's done,
rather than making the selection on
just a popularity contest."
The University would not release
the other five names considered by
Lyman.
Thomas' name was originally
suggested through informal surveys
given to the senior class. His name
was added to a list of about 150
others that were then considered by
the Advisory Commencement Panel
composed of the four senior presi
dents, two professors, one graduate
student and Lyman's assistant, lean

Fetter. They narrowed the list down
to six names, from which Lyman
chose Thomas to be the 1980 com
mencement speaker.
Thomas noted for his medical re
search, has received degrees from
Princeton University, Harvard Medi
cal School and Yale University. He
served his internship at Boston City

Hospital.
In the capacity n! professor, ad
ministrator or adviser, Thomas has
worked at seveiai medical tacilities
including Johns Hopkins, New York
University, University ot Minnesota
Medical School, the New York-
Bellevue Medical Center and Yale.
Thomas wrote his most famous
work, The Lives of a Cell, in 1974. In
it, he states "The trouble with Mod
ern Man is that he has been trying to
detach himself from nature."
He continues this theme is his sec
ond book, The Medusa and the Snail,
saying, "We tend to think of ourse
lves as the only wholly unique crea
tions in nature, but it is not so. Un
iqueness is so commonplace a prop
erty of living things that there is really
nothing at all unique about it."
Thomas has been affiliated with
the New York City Board of Health,
the Narcotics Advisory Committee of
the New York City Health Research
Council, the Marine Biological
Laboratory at Woods Hold, Ma., the
National Academy of Sciences and
