# Financing problems may block installing of tennis court lights

The student body voted over
whelmingly in favor of lighted tennis
courts in the ASSU election of Oct.
16-17, so lights will soon be installed
on campus courts, right? Wrong.
According to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Bob Young, "as of now lights
are not going in," and it will be at
least a month before a final decision
is made. It "comes down to a dollars
priority" — whether the Athletic De
partment or the University can find
room in their tight budgets for the
funding of tennis court lights, he
said.
The final decision will be made by
Athletic Director Andy Geiger, after
review and recommendation by a
committee appointed by President
Richard Lyman and agreement bet
ween the University Provost and the
Athletic Department on who will
fund it.
The ASSU ballot referendum
served only as a student opinion poll
on the issue.
The President-appointed Commit
tee of Athletics, Physical Education
and Recreation (CAPER) is responsi
ble for reviewing and making re
commendations on issues such as
lighting campus tennis courts.
CAPER Chairman Gerald Lieberman

said the "question of lighted tennis
courts" was brought before CAPER
by a group of students last spring,
but was left as the "one piece of un
finished business" to be taken up
when the committee reconvened
this fall.
At CAPER's first meeting last week,
Geiger was asked to get estimates for
installing court lights and to report
them at the next meeting on Nov. 28.
The committee will then decide on
its recommendation.
The students who brought the
issue to the attention of the Athletic
Department last spring were mem
bers of an ASSU Senate task force
appointed to study the need for
lighted courts. Then-senator Ron
Johnson headed the committee,
which included ASSU Sen. Tom Gart
and five other interested students.
According to Johnson, the investi
gations of the task force "de
monstrated that there was an over
whelming need" for lighted courts
and a "groundswell of student sup
port behind the proposal."
Johnson said that because most
students have classes during morn
ing hours and the courts are used by
P.E. classes in the afternoons, many
students cannot play tennis here.
He also discovered, "for every

student enrolled in a tennis class
there are two who tried to get in."
Lights would make night classes and
night recreational play possible, he
said.
With the "unanimous support" of
the senate, the committee submitted
the report to Ceiger and to CAPER.
After reviewing the report last
spring, Ceiger said the Athletic De
partment "would like the courts, but
it was a question of finances as to
when it would be" — probably
"either during the summer or by
January of next year," Johnson said.
Upon returning this fall and find
ing that nothing had been done yet, a
group of former senators, acting in
the interim before the election of
new senators, included the lighted
court referendum on the fall ASSU
ballot. This was done to "re
emphasize" the need the students
feel for lighted courts, Johnson said.
The ballot questions read: "Do
you feel there is a need for lighted
tennis courts?" and "Would you use
them if the Athletic Department pro
vided them?"
The way the ballot was set up, the
voter could either mark the space to
vote "yes" or leave it blank t<f vote
"no." Any voter who did not vote on
the issue was thereby tabulated on
the "no" side.
The ballots showed that of 3490
voters, 2121 said there is a need for
lighted courts, and 1873 of these said
they would use the courts if availa
ble.
Both Young and Lieberman stres
sed that the looming question mark
is funding. If the Varsity teams were
to use the lighted courts, then financ
ing would fall under the Athletic De
partment's responsibility. But be
cause the teams use Maples Pavilion
for their night matches, tennis coach
Dick Could says they have "no
need," according to Young.
It has not yet been determined
whether the Provost will agree to
subsidize the cost. If not, then "we
may have to take gift dollars,"
Lieberman said.

Young said that if lights are instal
led, they will probably be at the En
cina courts because the compact lay
out of the courts facilitates lighting.
In 1973, a similar proposal was
made to put the lights in at the driv
ing range by Lake Lagunita, but there
were too many complaints by nearby
residents about the brightness at
night.
Young said there is a possibility
that Toyon residents might be af
fected by the brightness of lights at
Encina, but they "should be far
enough away."
judging from past records,
chances are very good that lights will
be put in if CAPER recommends
them. In Lieberman's three-and
one-half years as chairman, no
CAPER recommendation has been
rejected by the Athletic Department
or by the University, he said.
