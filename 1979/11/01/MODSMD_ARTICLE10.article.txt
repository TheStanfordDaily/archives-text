# Alcohol use, abuse on campus
## Increased concern over liquor consumption 
### Jan Mireles 
A few years ago, in high
school, i t was a tew beers
with the gang late at
night in someone's car. These
days, a tequila sunrise or a rum
and coke will do. And several
years hence, martinis in the
business world and cocktail
parties will be the order of the
day.
The widespread availability
of alcohol at social functions
on campus fuels these
stereotypes. But it is not the
use of alcohol that concerns
Stephanie Brown of the Al
cohol Clinic at Stanford.
Rather, it is the misuse of al
cohol that is her special con
sideration.
"The use of alcohol is
broadening, but are we watch
ing for abuse?" asked Brown.
She cited pressure as one step
in the development of alcohol
abuse.
"There is much more pres
sure to drink than not," said
Brown. "Children in society
don't drink as a norm, but
adults in society do. Con
sequently, if you want to be
considered normal and
'adult,' you must learn to
drink. Thus, the use of alcohol
becomes an institution."
The reasons students give
for drinking range from peer
pressure to their desure to re
lieve academic or personal
tensions. It is these drinking
habits, established during col
lege years, that are the focus of
the work of Brown and Dr.
Vince D'Andrea, staff psychiat
rist at Cowell Health Center.
"It's the kind of lifestyle stu
dents lead, their tensions and
hysteria about studying, that
can lead to dependency on al
cohol," said D'Andrea. "Most
students drink to relieve ten
sion and most can do this with
out harming themselves.
Brown and D'Andrea are
concerned with those students
who can't drink without en
dangering themselves.
The damage caused by al
cohol abuse is two-fold,
D'Andrea said. Overuse
creates both physical and
psychological side effects.,
"The infirmary will often
have students who have suf
fered injuries caused by exces
sive drinking," he said. "This is
especially true on weekends
when social activities are in
creased."
The idea of someone trip
ping over his own feet or falling
out of a tree because he drank
too much is amusing to some,

but impairment of motor abil
ity is not the only type of physi
cal damage which occurs with
the misuse of alcohol, Brown
said.
''The more you drink, the
greater the chance of develop
ing severe internal physical
damage such as liver damage,"
she explained.
The psychological side ef
fects of alcohol abuse are also
ot great importance. Many
people do drink to relieve ten
sion and have a good time, but
according to Brown, drinking
becomes a problem when al
cohol "begins to provide a
false illusion of ability that ends
when you're sober."
"Alcoholics don't drink to
get drunk. They drink to feel
normal," explained D'Andrea.
"Alcohol arrests emotional
development — at any level,"
stressed Brown. Emotional ar
rest can last until the drinker
changes his drinking habits or
quits drinking entirely. Failure
to curtail excessive drinking
patterns can lead to depen
dency.
"The business of holding
yourliquorisamachoimage. It
may be a sign of alcoholism,"
said D'Andrea.
Signs of drinking problems
often evade students. To com
bat this, various treatment and
information centers are availa
ble to University students.
Posters, tracts and alcohol
quizzes have also been de
veloped to expand student
awareness.
The Alcohol Clinic at Stan
ford Medical Center offers
consultation, group, family or
individual counseling, and ser
vices for relatives of alcoholics.
The clinic charges for its ser
vices.
Cowell Health Services and
The Bridge also deal with stu
dent drinking problems. Their
services are free to students.
"There are very few al
coholics on campus, but there
are very many more potential
alcoholics. The whole situation
of alcohol is just a measure of
mindlessness," concluded
D'Andrea.
It is unusual for people to
realize that they may de
velop drinking problems in
the first place, but there is one
group of students on campus
who know they have just that
potential and work together to
avoid such an outcome.
These are Students With Al
coholic Relatives, otherwise
known as SWAR.
"They understand that they
are a higher risk for al

coholism," said D'Andrea.
"It's basically just a support
group, a place where you can
air your complaints,"
explained SWAR member
Suzanna Jacobson.
The problems of children of
alcoholics can be very intense,
according to D'Andrea. Many
of them tend to be overachiev
ers in school and later in life.
Because of this, their prob
lems often go undetected and
unsolved. Studies conducted
by Brown have shown that
many children turn to alcohol
as a cure for the problems they
encounter, and thus per
petuate alcoholism in their
generation.
"Here you have all these
Stanford students who are
whiz kids, and because they fit
the mold, their problems are
glossed over and ignored.
When they get older their only
road to achievement is drink
ing," said David French, foun
der of SWAR.
Jacobson urged student in
volvement in encounter
groups.
"There is something very
comforting about being in a
room of people, sharing your
problems with them, and
knowing they understand,"
she said.
SWAR is not the only organi
zation on campus dealing with
the alcohol situation.
"Alcohol use is often seen as
a problem of the fraternities,"
said Diana Conklin, assistant
director of the Row, private
houses and the fraternity sys
tem.
"But it is not just their prob
lem," she added. "Theyare not
the only ones on campus using
alcohol, and they are certainly
not the only ones on campus
misusing alcohol."
Conklin stressed that solving
the problem of alcohol abuse
requires a campus-wide effort.
She has been working in con

junction with D'Andrea to de
velop ways of changing the
image of alcohol use. Their
major emphasis is on modera
tion in drinking, and encourag
ing students to feel they can
choose to not drink alcohol
without feeling pressured.
Bringing about student
awareness is not an easy task,
according to Conklin. She is
working with the Inter-
Fraternity Council {IFC) to help
them set their own guidelines
concerning drinking policies
for rush and fraternity parties.
According to IFC President
John Kinney (SAE), "There are
no set rules for fraternities yet.
We have appointed an alcohol
committee that will review
rush, report how much alcohol
is consumed, and set up some
guidelines."
"Our purpose is to propose
guidelines to the IFC about
what should and should not
happen at fraternity parties.
We want to avoid pressuring
people to drink during rush
and offer alternatives to al
cohol at parties," explained
committee member Doug Bal
linger (Beta).
The fraternities, however,
said they are not the only ones
responsible for the drinking
situation.
"We set up the alcohol
committee not only because
there is a problem, but also be

cause of the opinion (of us) on
campus. We are being respon
sible. We are not the devils
who cause all the drinking
problems," said Kinney.
Ballinger took this point one
step further, "Housing as
sociates (RAs) in the freshmen
dorms should be aware of the
problem. They should educate
people about drinking. We can
offer an alternative, but that's
about it. After that it's up to
each individual to decide how
much they should drink."
Conklin and D'Andrea are
concentrating on the dorms.
They've held seminars for the
RAs and stress the importance
of making students feel they
have a choice.
"We urge thought about
how alcohol is used at func
tions, where they keep it, who
has access, and that houses
make available as much non
alcoholic beverages ds liquor,"
said D'Andrea.
Conklin and D'Andrea said
they hope that these preven
tive measures will encourage
those who might develop a
problem to drink moderately.
Conklin summed up the
main goal.
"I have almost a missionary
zeal, not for abstinence — that
would be ridiculous — but for
choice. We're just trying to in
crease some behavioral op
tions."

SWAR is not the only organi

"Alcohol use is often seen as
a problem of the fraternities,"
said Diana Conklin, assistant

"But it is not just their prob

the only ones on campus using

Conklin stressed that solving
the problem of alcohol abuse
requires a campus-wide effort.
She has been working in con

While a well-stocked bar may be the lubricating factor of a "good
party," many are concerned with the potential for abuse.
A few years ago, in high
school, i t was a tew beers
with the gang late at
night in someone's car. These
days, a tequila sunrise or a rum
and coke will do. And several
years hence, martinis in the
business world and cocktail
parties will be the order of the
day.
The widespread availability
of alcohol at social functions
on campus fuels these
stereotypes. But it is not the
use of alcohol that concerns
Stephanie Brown of the Al
cohol Clinic at Stanford.
Rather, it is the misuse of al
cohol that is her special con
sideration.
"The use of alcohol is
broadening, but are we watch
ing for abuse?" asked Brown.
She cited pressure as one step
in the development of alcohol
abuse.
"There is much more pres
sure to drink than not," said
Brown. "Children in society
don't drink as a norm, but
adults in society do. Con
sequently, if you want to be
considered normal and
'adult,' you must learn to
drink. Thus, the use of alcohol
becomes an institution."
The reasons students give
for drinking range from peer
pressure to their desure to re
lieve academic or personal
tensions. It is these drinking
habits, established during col
lege years, that are the focus of
the work of Brown and Dr.
Vince D'Andrea, staff psychiat
rist at Cowell Health Center.
"It's the kind of lifestyle stu
dents lead, their tensions and
hysteria about studying, that
can lead to dependency on al
cohol," said D'Andrea. "Most
students drink to relieve ten
sion and most can do this with
out harming themselves.
Brown and D'Andrea are
concerned with those students
who can't drink without en
dangering themselves.
The damage caused by al
cohol abuse is two-fold,
D'Andrea said. Overuse
creates both physical and
psychological side effects.,
"The infirmary will often
have students who have suf
fered injuries caused by exces
sive drinking," he said. "This is
especially true on weekends
when social activities are in
creased."
The idea of someone trip
ping over his own feet or falling
out of a tree because he drank
too much is amusing to some,

but impairment of motor abil
ity is not the only type of physi
cal damage which occurs with
the misuse of alcohol, Brown
said.
''The more you drink, the
greater the chance of develop
ing severe internal physical
damage such as liver damage,"
she explained.
The psychological side ef
fects of alcohol abuse are also
ot great importance. Many
people do drink to relieve ten
sion and have a good time, but
according to Brown, drinking
becomes a problem when al
cohol "begins to provide a
false illusion of ability that ends
when you're sober."
"Alcoholics don't drink to
get drunk. They drink to feel
normal," explained D'Andrea.
"Alcohol arrests emotional
development — at any level,"
stressed Brown. Emotional ar
rest can last until the drinker
changes his drinking habits or
quits drinking entirely. Failure
to curtail excessive drinking
patterns can lead to depen
dency.
"The business of holding
yourliquorisamachoimage. It
may be a sign of alcoholism,"
said D'Andrea.
Signs of drinking problems
often evade students. To com
bat this, various treatment and
information centers are availa
ble to University students.
Posters, tracts and alcohol
quizzes have also been de
veloped to expand student
awareness.
The Alcohol Clinic at Stan
ford Medical Center offers
consultation, group, family or
individual counseling, and ser
vices for relatives of alcoholics.
The clinic charges for its ser
vices.
Cowell Health Services and
The Bridge also deal with stu
dent drinking problems. Their
services are free to students.
"There are very few al
coholics on campus, but there
are very many more potential
alcoholics. The whole situation
of alcohol is just a measure of
mindlessness," concluded
D'Andrea.
It is unusual for people to
realize that they may de
velop drinking problems in
the first place, but there is one
group of students on campus
who know they have just that
potential and work together to
avoid such an outcome.
These are Students With Al
coholic Relatives, otherwise
known as SWAR.
"They understand that they
are a higher risk for al

coholism," said D'Andrea.
"It's basically just a support
group, a place where you can
air your complaints,"
explained SWAR member
Suzanna Jacobson.
The problems of children of
alcoholics can be very intense,
according to D'Andrea. Many
of them tend to be overachiev
ers in school and later in life.
Because of this, their prob
lems often go undetected and
unsolved. Studies conducted
by Brown have shown that
many children turn to alcohol
as a cure for the problems they
encounter, and thus per
petuate alcoholism in their
generation.
"Here you have all these
Stanford students who are
whiz kids, and because they fit
the mold, their problems are
glossed over and ignored.
When they get older their only
road to achievement is drink
ing," said David French, foun
der of SWAR.
Jacobson urged student in
volvement in encounter
groups.
"There is something very
comforting about being in a
room of people, sharing your
problems with them, and
knowing they understand,"
she said.
SWAR is not the only organi

too much is amusing to some,

but impairment of motor abil
ity is not the only type of physi
cal damage which occurs with
the misuse of alcohol, Brown
said.
''The more you drink, the
greater the chance of develop
ing severe internal physical
damage such as liver damage,"
she explained.
The psychological side ef
fects of alcohol abuse are also
ot great importance. Many
people do drink to relieve ten
sion and have a good time, but
according to Brown, drinking
becomes a problem when al
cohol "begins to provide a
false illusion of ability that ends
when you're sober."
"Alcoholics don't drink to
get drunk. They drink to feel
normal," explained D'Andrea.
"Alcohol arrests emotional
development — at any level,"
stressed Brown. Emotional ar
rest can last until the drinker
changes his drinking habits or
quits drinking entirely. Failure
to curtail excessive drinking
patterns can lead to depen
dency.
"The business of holding
yourliquorisamachoimage. It
may be a sign of alcoholism,"
said D'Andrea.
Signs of drinking problems
often evade students. To com
bat this, various treatment and
information centers are availa
ble to University students.
Posters, tracts and alcohol
quizzes have also been de
veloped to expand student
awareness.
The Alcohol Clinic at Stan
ford Medical Center offers
consultation, group, family or
individual counseling, and ser
vices for relatives of alcoholics.
The clinic charges for its ser
vices.
Cowell Health Services and
The Bridge also deal with stu
dent drinking problems. Their
services are free to students.
"There are very few al
coholics on campus, but there
are very many more potential
alcoholics. The whole situation
of alcohol is just a measure of
mindlessness," concluded
D'Andrea.
It is unusual for people to
realize that they may de
velop drinking problems in
the first place, but there is one
group of students on campus
who know they have just that
potential and work together to
avoid such an outcome.
These are Students With Al
coholic Relatives, otherwise
known as SWAR.
"They understand that they
are a higher risk for al

coholism," said D'Andrea.
"It's basically just a support
group, a place where you can
air your complaints,"
explained SWAR member
Suzanna Jacobson.
The problems of children of
alcoholics can be very intense,
according to D'Andrea. Many
of them tend to be overachiev
ers in school and later in life.
Because of this, their prob
lems often go undetected and
unsolved. Studies conducted
by Brown have shown that
many children turn to alcohol
as a cure for the problems they
encounter, and thus per
petuate alcoholism in their
generation.
"Here you have all these
Stanford students who are
whiz kids, and because they fit
the mold, their problems are
glossed over and ignored.
When they get older their only
road to achievement is drink
ing," said David French, foun
der of SWAR.
Jacobson urged student in
volvement in encounter
groups.
"There is something very
comforting about being in a
room of people, sharing your
problems with them, and
knowing they understand,"
she said.
SWAR is not the only organi
zation on campus dealing with
the alcohol situation.
"Alcohol use is often seen as
a problem of the fraternities,"
said Diana Conklin, assistant
director of the Row, private
houses and the fraternity sys
tem.
"But it is not just their prob
lem," she added. "Theyare not
the only ones on campus using
alcohol, and they are certainly
not the only ones on campus
misusing alcohol."
Conklin stressed that solving
the problem of alcohol abuse
requires a campus-wide effort.
She has been working in con

junction with D'Andrea to de
velop ways of changing the
image of alcohol use. Their
major emphasis is on modera
tion in drinking, and encourag
ing students to feel they can
choose to not drink alcohol
without feeling pressured.
Bringing about student
awareness is not an easy task,
according to Conklin. She is
working with the Inter-
Fraternity Council {IFC) to help
them set their own guidelines
concerning drinking policies
for rush and fraternity parties.
According to IFC President
John Kinney (SAE), "There are
no set rules for fraternities yet.
We have appointed an alcohol
committee that will review
rush, report how much alcohol
is consumed, and set up some
guidelines."
"Our purpose is to propose
guidelines to the IFC about
what should and should not
happen at fraternity parties.
We want to avoid pressuring
people to drink during rush
and offer alternatives to al
cohol at parties," explained
committee member Doug Bal
linger (Beta).
The fraternities, however,
said they are not the only ones
responsible for the drinking
situation.
"We set up the alcohol
committee not only because
there is a problem, but also be

cause of the opinion (of us) on
campus. We are being respon
sible. We are not the devils
who cause all the drinking
problems," said Kinney.
Ballinger took this point one
step further, "Housing as
sociates (RAs) in the freshmen
dorms should be aware of the
problem. They should educate
people about drinking. We can
offer an alternative, but that's
about it. After that it's up to
each individual to decide how
much they should drink."
Conklin and D'Andrea are
concentrating on the dorms.
They've held seminars for the
RAs and stress the importance
of making students feel they
have a choice.
"We urge thought about
how alcohol is used at func
tions, where they keep it, who
has access, and that houses
make available as much non
alcoholic beverages ds liquor,"
said D'Andrea.
Conklin and D'Andrea said
they hope that these preven
tive measures will encourage
those who might develop a
problem to drink moderately.
Conklin summed up the
main goal.
"I have almost a missionary
zeal, not for abstinence — that
would be ridiculous — but for
choice. We're just trying to in
crease some behavioral op
tions."

While a well-stocked bar may be the lubricating factor of a "good
party," many are concerned with the potential for abuse.
A few years ago, in high
school, i t was a tew beers
with the gang late at
night in someone's car. These
days, a tequila sunrise or a rum
and coke will do. And several
years hence, martinis in the
business world and cocktail
parties will be the order of the
day.
The widespread availability
of alcohol at social functions
on campus fuels these
stereotypes. But it is not the
use of alcohol that concerns
Stephanie Brown of the Al
cohol Clinic at Stanford.
Rather, it is the misuse of al
cohol that is her special con
sideration.
"The use of alcohol is
broadening, but are we watch
ing for abuse?" asked Brown.
She cited pressure as one step
in the development of alcohol
abuse.
"There is much more pres
sure to drink than not," said
Brown. "Children in society
don't drink as a norm, but
adults in society do. Con
sequently, if you want to be
considered normal and
'adult,' you must learn to
drink. Thus, the use of alcohol
becomes an institution."
The reasons students give
for drinking range from peer
pressure to their desure to re
lieve academic or personal
tensions. It is these drinking
habits, established during col
lege years, that are the focus of
the work of Brown and Dr.
Vince D'Andrea, staff psychiat
rist at Cowell Health Center.
"It's the kind of lifestyle stu
dents lead, their tensions and
hysteria about studying, that
can lead to dependency on al
cohol," said D'Andrea. "Most
students drink to relieve ten
sion and most can do this with
out harming themselves.
Brown and D'Andrea are
concerned with those students
who can't drink without en
dangering themselves.
The damage caused by al
cohol abuse is two-fold,
D'Andrea said. Overuse
creates both physical and
psychological side effects.,
"The infirmary will often
have students who have suf
fered injuries caused by exces
sive drinking," he said. "This is
especially true on weekends
when social activities are in
creased."
The idea of someone trip
ping over his own feet or falling
out of a tree because he drank
too much is amusing to some,

but impairment of motor abil
ity is not the only type of physi
cal damage which occurs with
the misuse of alcohol, Brown
said.
''The more you drink, the
greater the chance of develop
ing severe internal physical
damage such as liver damage,"
she explained.

fects of alcohol abuse are also
