# A Kihn sense of destiny
## He says his band's just getting into stride 
### Brad Brockbank Ron Lillejord 
A concert crowd that
knows it is about to hear
a local tavo te on the
near edge of national su<
cess is a happy and testive
crowd. And it was such a crowd
that gathered at the Keystone
Palo Alto to hear Greg Kihn and
his band.
The Berkeley-based group,
which only five years ago was
recording music available only
by mail-order, has now

churned out four albums, the
latest of which — In the Naked
Eye — made Billboard's Top
100. A new album is due out
early in 1980.
Since the formation of the
band half a decade ago, the
quartet has risen to the top of

the Bay Area rock scene. The
groups first album, Greg Kihn,
met with some local attention
and featured three-fourths of
the current membership of the
group: Kihn on rhythm guitar
and lead vocals, Larry Lynch on
drums and Steve Wright on
bass. Lead guitarist Dave Car
pender plugged in with the
band just before the second
album, Greg Kihn Again,
which was the first of the
group's albums to receive sub
stantial FM airplay.
The addition of Carpender
played a catalytic role in the

group's development. With a
fuller, complete sound, songs
such as "Madison Avenue
Man," "Love's Made a Fool of
You" and the cover version of
Bruce Springsteen's "For You"
impressed FM D|s and
foreshadowed an exciting fu

ture tor the embryonic group.
Their third album, Next of
Kihn, was released in 1977.
"Remember," a song as
memorable as its title, domi
nated among FM favorites for a
while and even received sparse
airplay on disco-dominated
AM.
The fourth and most recent
album, In the Naked Eye, con
sisted of shorter, more
commercially oriented songs
which have received both FM
and AM airplay. Although the
album did not achieve the mus
ical heights of its predecessor,

it served to propel the group
into the national spotlight.
Despite the attempt at com
mercialization, however, the
album stands out on its own
merits. The talents of each of
the group's members are effec
tively, if not extensively, dis
played. "Roadrunner" and
"Rendezvous" — another
Springsteen song — are both in
true Kihn tradition and high
light the album.
In concert, as the Keystone
crowd two weeks ago disco
vered, the band has made the
quantum leap to a first-rate na
tional act. Without losing one
ounce of integrity as an
audience-capturing rock per
formance, Kihn's show has
evolved into a tight profes
sional display of pure talent.
Between sets at the Keys
tone show, we had an op
portunity to spend over 20
minutes with a relaxed Greg
Kihn. Selected portions of that
interview follow:
Daily: Is there much difference
between the early days and now?
Kihn: Oh, yeah. There's a lot of
difference. We're all driving
better cars now, the weather's
better. In the early days, we
were available only through
mail-order. Then Playboy Re
cords, and that was pretty
much just like mail-order.
Daily: How did Berserkley (Kihn's
independent label) come about?
Kihn: I don't know. I mean it
just sprang up and it just
started out as a joke, 'cause we
were just going to do it for one
or two records. And it just
turned into reality — a joke that
became history.
Now it feels okay. I don't
know what's going to happen
next. With Berserkley, the fu
ture's always strange. I kind of
hope we have a hit record,
