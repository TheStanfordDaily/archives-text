# A 						Kihn sense of destiny
## He says his band's just getting into stride 
### Brad Brockbank Ron Lillejord 
A concert crowd that
knows it is about to hear
a local tavo te on the
near edge of national su<
cess is a happy and testive
crowd. And it was such a crowd
that gathered at the Keystone
Palo Alto to hear Greg Kihn and
his band.
The Berkeley-based group,
which only five years ago was
recording music available only
by mail-order, has now

churned out four albums, the
latest of which — In the Naked
Eye — made Billboard's Top
100. A new album is due out
early in 1980.
Since the formation of the
band half a decade ago, the
quartet has risen to the top of

the Bay Area rock scene. The
groups first album, Greg Kihn,
met with some local attention
and featured three-fourths of
the current membership of the
group: Kihn on rhythm guitar
and lead vocals, Larry Lynch on
drums and Steve Wright on
bass. Lead guitarist Dave Car
pender plugged in with the
band just before the second
album, Greg Kihn Again,
which was the first of the
group's albums to receive sub
stantial FM airplay.
The addition of Carpender
played a catalytic role in the

group's development. With a
fuller, complete sound, songs
such as "Madison Avenue
Man," "Love's Made a Fool of
You" and the cover version of
Bruce Springsteen's "For You"
impressed FM D|s and
foreshadowed an exciting fu

ture tor the embryonic group.
Their third album, Next of
Kihn, was released in 1977.
"Remember," a song as
memorable as its title, domi
nated among FM favorites for a
while and even received sparse
airplay on disco-dominated
AM.
The fourth and most recent
album, In the Naked Eye, con
sisted of shorter, more
commercially oriented songs
which have received both FM
and AM airplay. Although the
album did not achieve the mus
ical heights of its predecessor,

it served to propel the group
into the national spotlight.
Despite the attempt at com
mercialization, however, the
album stands out on its own
merits. The talents of each of
the group's members are effec
tively, if not extensively, dis
played. "Roadrunner" and
"Rendezvous" — another
Springsteen song — are both in
true Kihn tradition and high
light the album.
In concert, as the Keystone
crowd two weeks ago disco
vered, the band has made the
quantum leap to a first-rate na
tional act. Without losing one
ounce of integrity as an
audience-capturing rock per
formance, Kihn's show has
evolved into a tight profes
sional display of pure talent.
Between sets at the Keys
tone show, we had an op
portunity to spend over 20
minutes with a relaxed Greg
Kihn. Selected portions of that
interview follow:
Daily: Is there much difference
between the early days and now?
Kihn: Oh, yeah. There's a lot of
difference. We're all driving
better cars now, the weather's
better. In the early days, we
were available only through
mail-order. Then Playboy Re
cords, and that was pretty
much just like mail-order.
Daily: How did Berserkley (Kihn's
independent label) come about?
Kihn: I don't know. I mean it
just sprang up and it just
started out as a joke, 'cause we
were just going to do it for one
or two records. And it just
turned into reality — a joke that
became history.
Now it feels okay. I don't
know what's going to happen
next. With Berserkley, the fu
ture's always strange. I kind of
hope we have a hit record,

Entertainment
blow the whole thing wide
open. It'sbeen simmeringfora
while; the stew is about ready.
Daily: What about "Rendezv
ous"? Did you think that would
be a hit?
Kihn: I didn't know. I'll tell you,
man, how off-base I am. I
thought "Beside Myself" (from
In the Naked Eye) should have
been a hit. But they didn't even
think about that one. Now
"Roadrunner" is the single and
we're hoping it does real good.
It's got a "Louie, Louie" flavor
that I've always liked.
Daily: How much do you think
about the commercialism?
Kihn: Well, I go through weeks
where I think about it a lot and
some weeks where I don't
think about it at all. I don't
write myself into a corner. We
try continuously to go new di
rections and write new kinds of
songs. The last album had a lot
of different songs on it, like
"Moulin Rouge."
Daily: Are you going to try to
continue that?
Kihn: Yeah, we're going to con
tinue to expand, although that

was our commercial attempt,
the last album. All the songs
were about three minutes
long, and they were pretty
standard arrangements. Now
we've decided to go back to
our formula, just doing the
songs, whatever we feel is
necessary. It might be four or
five minutes, or whatever.
We're still gonna write short
songs, but there are a couple of
new ones on the new album
that are four plus, five plus
(minutes). It's more like "Re
member"; that third album,
Next of Kihn, we didn't care at
all about singles. We justdidn't
give a shit, so we just went
ahead and played everything
the way it felt. The last one, we
did try to keep things in
perspective, keep 'em three
minutes, and not have any long
guitar solos and stuff. The next
album, screw that approach,
we're going back to the other
approach. We've tried every
thing, you know. The band's
evolving, and I just want to let
them play more.
The new songs are a lot
thicker-sounding. We're doing

itall live. Weareoverdubbinga
lot of vocals and guitars, but
the tracks . . . they sound real
booming, like "Roadrunner." I
really like the sounds like Led
Zep's drum sound, boom,
boom boom. So we're going to
do some songs on the new
album that if you didn't know it
wasus, it couldbe Foreigner or
Led Zep or something.
Daily: Have you considered
working with Roy Thomas Baker
(producer of Foreigner's latest
album)?
Kihn: I'd like to, but I don't
know. You see, we're just com
ing into our own now. Every
guy in the band produces his
own part — so we kind of pro
duce ourselves. We're just get
ting into our stride, we felt,
with the close of the last al
bum. We just wanted to find
out if we couldn't make a clas
sic by ourselves. I know even
tually, if we ever have hit re
cords and stuff, I'd love to
work with all these guys, 'cause
when I'm an old man, I want to
tell my kids that I worked with
Roy Thomas Baker, George
Martin, Clyn Johns, and all

these people, and had lunch
with the Who.
You know, our idols are the
basics of rock. We want to be a
basic-diet band that you can
really get your teeth into, like
Creedence Clearwater Revival
or the Who. Just straight
ahead, no smoke bombs
needed. That's what we're
shooting for right now.
Daily: You played the East Coast
recently. How did that go?
Kihn: It went great. We played
before more people than we
ever have. We did lead act with
Louise Coffin opening up for
most of the tour; we headlined
Central Park. We did a few
shows opening up for real big
groups. We did two shows in
Philadelphia at the Spectrum
with The Cars. It was 20,000 a
night and it was crazed. It really
went good. I like playing the
big shows; you have to play
them different.
Usually opening bands don't
get any sound checks. So we
always have to suffer the slings
and arrows.
But they've got to do more
than deny us a sound check to
stop us, they'd have to unplug
the PA. I mean, we'd go out
and do an entire setacappella,
man. We don't care; we came

to play and nothing can stop
us. Most of the big gigs we do
are without sound checks. We
expect it, man; if we get one,
it's a luxury, and if we don't. . .
it's, like, the Beatles did whole
tours without sound checks.
We want to be the toughest
band alive, so we just eat
sound checks for lunch, you
know?
Daily: How did "Rendezvous"
come about?
Kihn: Brucie (Springsteen) gave
it to us. He saw us at the Roxy
(in L.A.) about a year ago, and
he came backstage. We were
talking and he mentioned this
song "Rendezvous" because
he'd really liked "For You." It
turned out that we were stay
ing at the same hotel, so we got
together at the pool the next
morning, and he gave me the
lyrics and stuff.
I really like Bruce a lot. He's
one of the true gentlemen of
rock and roll. We've met a lot
of assholes, but he's one of the
great gentlemen. A lot of 'em
come and go, but he's going to
be around for decades.
Daily: What do you think is your
best album?
Kihn: I like them all; I don't
have any favorites. I like every
thing. I even like Liberace.

knows it is about to hear

which was the first of the
group's albums to receive sub
stantial FM airplay.
The addition of Carpender
played a catalytic role in the

group's development. With a
fuller, complete sound, songs
such as "Madison Avenue
Man," "Love's Made a Fool of
You" and the cover version of
Bruce Springsteen's "For You"
impressed FM D|s and
foreshadowed an exciting fu

ture tor the embryonic group.
Their third album, Next of
Kihn, was released in 1977.
"Remember," a song as
memorable as its title, domi
nated among FM favorites for a
while and even received sparse
airplay on disco-dominated
AM.
The fourth and most recent
album, In the Naked Eye, con
sisted of shorter, more
commercially oriented songs
which have received both FM
and AM airplay. Although the
album did not achieve the mus
ical heights of its predecessor,

it served to propel the group
into the national spotlight.
Despite the attempt at com
mercialization, however, the
album stands out on its own
merits. The talents of each of
the group's members are effec
tively, if not extensively, dis
played. "Roadrunner" and
"Rendezvous" — another
Springsteen song — are both in
true Kihn tradition and high
light the album.
In concert, as the Keystone
crowd two weeks ago disco
vered, the band has made the
quantum leap to a first-rate na
tional act. Without losing one
ounce of integrity as an
audience-capturing rock per
formance, Kihn's show has
evolved into a tight profes
sional display of pure talent.
Between sets at the Keys
tone show, we had an op
portunity to spend over 20
minutes with a relaxed Greg
Kihn. Selected portions of that
interview follow:
Daily: Is there much difference
between the early days and now?
Kihn: Oh, yeah. There's a lot of
difference. We're all driving
better cars now, the weather's
better. In the early days, we
were available only through
mail-order. Then Playboy Re
cords, and that was pretty
much just like mail-order.
Daily: How did Berserkley (Kihn's
independent label) come about?
Kihn: I don't know. I mean it
just sprang up and it just
started out as a joke, 'cause we
were just going to do it for one
or two records. And it just
turned into reality — a joke that
became history.
Now it feels okay. I don't
know what's going to happen
next. With Berserkley, the fu
ture's always strange. I kind of
hope we have a hit record,

Entertainment
blow the whole thing wide
open. It'sbeen simmeringfora
while; the stew is about ready.
Daily: What about "Rendezv
ous"? Did you think that would
be a hit?
Kihn: I didn't know. I'll tell you,
man, how off-base I am. I
thought "Beside Myself" (from
In the Naked Eye) should have
been a hit. But they didn't even
think about that one. Now
"Roadrunner" is the single and
we're hoping it does real good.
It's got a "Louie, Louie" flavor
that I've always liked.
Daily: How much do you think
about the commercialism?
Kihn: Well, I go through weeks
where I think about it a lot and
some weeks where I don't
think about it at all. I don't
write myself into a corner. We
try continuously to go new di
rections and write new kinds of
songs. The last album had a lot
of different songs on it, like
"Moulin Rouge."
Daily: Are you going to try to
continue that?
Kihn: Yeah, we're going to con
tinue to expand, although that

was our commercial attempt,
the last album. All the songs
were about three minutes
long, and they were pretty
standard arrangements. Now
we've decided to go back to
our formula, just doing the
songs, whatever we feel is
necessary. It might be four or
five minutes, or whatever.
We're still gonna write short
songs, but there are a couple of
new ones on the new album
that are four plus, five plus
(minutes). It's more like "Re
member"; that third album,
Next of Kihn, we didn't care at
all about singles. We justdidn't
give a shit, so we just went
ahead and played everything
the way it felt. The last one, we
did try to keep things in
perspective, keep 'em three
minutes, and not have any long
guitar solos and stuff. The next
album, screw that approach,
we're going back to the other
approach. We've tried every
thing, you know. The band's
evolving, and I just want to let
them play more.
The new songs are a lot
thicker-sounding. We're doing

itall live. Weareoverdubbinga
lot of vocals and guitars, but
the tracks . . . they sound real
booming, like "Roadrunner." I
really like the sounds like Led
Zep's drum sound, boom,
boom boom. So we're going to
do some songs on the new
album that if you didn't know it
wasus, it couldbe Foreigner or
Led Zep or something.
Daily: Have you considered
working with Roy Thomas Baker
(producer of Foreigner's latest
album)?
Kihn: I'd like to, but I don't
know. You see, we're just com
ing into our own now. Every
guy in the band produces his
own part — so we kind of pro
duce ourselves. We're just get
ting into our stride, we felt,
with the close of the last al
bum. We just wanted to find
out if we couldn't make a clas
sic by ourselves. I know even
tually, if we ever have hit re
cords and stuff, I'd love to
work with all these guys, 'cause
when I'm an old man, I want to
tell my kids that I worked with
Roy Thomas Baker, George
Martin, Clyn Johns, and all

these people, and had lunch
with the Who.
You know, our idols are the
basics of rock. We want to be a
basic-diet band that you can
really get your teeth into, like
Creedence Clearwater Revival
or the Who. Just straight
ahead, no smoke bombs
needed. That's what we're
shooting for right now.
Daily: You played the East Coast
recently. How did that go?
Kihn: It went great. We played
before more people than we
ever have. We did lead act with
Louise Coffin opening up for
most of the tour; we headlined
Central Park. We did a few
shows opening up for real big
groups. We did two shows in
Philadelphia at the Spectrum
with The Cars. It was 20,000 a
night and it was crazed. It really
went good. I like playing the
big shows; you have to play
them different.
Usually opening bands don't
get any sound checks. So we
always have to suffer the slings
and arrows.
But they've got to do more
than deny us a sound check to
stop us, they'd have to unplug
the PA. I mean, we'd go out
and do an entire setacappella,
man. We don't care; we came

to play and nothing can stop
us. Most of the big gigs we do
are without sound checks. We
expect it, man; if we get one,
it's a luxury, and if we don't. . .
it's, like, the Beatles did whole
tours without sound checks.
We want to be the toughest
band alive, so we just eat
sound checks for lunch, you
know?
Daily: How did "Rendezvous"
come about?
Kihn: Brucie (Springsteen) gave
it to us. He saw us at the Roxy
(in L.A.) about a year ago, and
he came backstage. We were
talking and he mentioned this
song "Rendezvous" because
he'd really liked "For You." It
turned out that we were stay
ing at the same hotel, so we got
together at the pool the next
morning, and he gave me the
lyrics and stuff.
I really like Bruce a lot. He's
one of the true gentlemen of
rock and roll. We've met a lot
of assholes, but he's one of the
great gentlemen. A lot of 'em
come and go, but he's going to
be around for decades.
Daily: What do you think is your
best album?
Kihn: I like them all; I don't
have any favorites. I like every
thing. I even like Liberace.
A concert crowd that
knows it is about to hear
a local tavo te on the
near edge of national su<
cess is a happy and testive
crowd. And it was such a crowd
that gathered at the Keystone
Palo Alto to hear Greg Kihn and
his band.
The Berkeley-based group,
which only five years ago was
recording music available only
by mail-order, has now

churned out four albums, the
latest of which — In the Naked
Eye — made Billboard's Top
100. A new album is due out
early in 1980.
Since the formation of the
band half a decade ago, the
quartet has risen to the top of

the Bay Area rock scene. The
groups first album, Greg Kihn,
met with some local attention
and featured three-fourths of
the current membership of the
group: Kihn on rhythm guitar
and lead vocals, Larry Lynch on
drums and Steve Wright on
bass. Lead guitarist Dave Car
pender plugged in with the
band just before the second
album, Greg Kihn Again,
which was the first of the
group's albums to receive sub
stantial FM airplay.

the group's members are effec
tively, if not extensively, dis
played. "Roadrunner" and
"Rendezvous" — another
Springsteen song — are both in
true Kihn tradition and high
light the album.
In concert, as the Keystone
crowd two weeks ago disco
vered, the band has made the
quantum leap to a first-rate na
tional act. Without losing one
ounce of integrity as an
audience-capturing rock per
formance, Kihn's show has
evolved into a tight profes
sional display of pure talent.
Between sets at the Keys
tone show, we had an op
portunity to spend over 20
minutes with a relaxed Greg
Kihn. Selected portions of that
interview follow:
Daily: Is there much difference
between the early days and now?
Kihn: Oh, yeah. There's a lot of
difference. We're all driving
better cars now, the weather's
better. In the early days, we
were available only through
mail-order. Then Playboy Re
cords, and that was pretty
much just like mail-order.
Daily: How did Berserkley (Kihn's
independent label) come about?
Kihn: I don't know. I mean it
just sprang up and it just
started out as a joke, 'cause we
were just going to do it for one
or two records. And it just
turned into reality — a joke that
became history.
Now it feels okay. I don't
know what's going to happen
next. With Berserkley, the fu
ture's always strange. I kind of
hope we have a hit record,

Entertainment
blow the whole thing wide
open. It'sbeen simmeringfora
while; the stew is about ready.
Daily: What about "Rendezv
ous"? Did you think that would
be a hit?
Kihn: I didn't know. I'll tell you,
man, how off-base I am. I
thought "Beside Myself" (from
In the Naked Eye) should have
been a hit. But they didn't even
think about that one. Now
"Roadrunner" is the single and
we're hoping it does real good.
It's got a "Louie, Louie" flavor
that I've always liked.
Daily: How much do you think
about the commercialism?
Kihn: Well, I go through weeks
where I think about it a lot and
some weeks where I don't
think about it at all. I don't
write myself into a corner. We
try continuously to go new di
rections and write new kinds of
songs. The last album had a lot
of different songs on it, like
"Moulin Rouge."
Daily: Are you going to try to
continue that?
Kihn: Yeah, we're going to con
tinue to expand, although that

was our commercial attempt,
the last album. All the songs
were about three minutes
long, and they were pretty
standard arrangements. Now
we've decided to go back to
our formula, just doing the
songs, whatever we feel is
necessary. It might be four or
five minutes, or whatever.
We're still gonna write short
songs, but there are a couple of
new ones on the new album
that are four plus, five plus
(minutes). It's more like "Re
member"; that third album,
Next of Kihn, we didn't care at
all about singles. We justdidn't
give a shit, so we just went
ahead and played everything
the way it felt. The last one, we
did try to keep things in
perspective, keep 'em three
minutes, and not have any long
guitar solos and stuff. The next
album, screw that approach,
we're going back to the other
approach. We've tried every
thing, you know. The band's
evolving, and I just want to let
them play more.
The new songs are a lot
thicker-sounding. We're doing

itall live. Weareoverdubbinga
lot of vocals and guitars, but
the tracks . . . they sound real
booming, like "Roadrunner." I
really like the sounds like Led
Zep's drum sound, boom,
boom boom. So we're going to
do some songs on the new
album that if you didn't know it
wasus, it couldbe Foreigner or
Led Zep or something.
Daily: Have you considered
working with Roy Thomas Baker
(producer of Foreigner's latest
album)?
Kihn: I'd like to, but I don't
know. You see, we're just com
ing into our own now. Every
guy in the band produces his
own part — so we kind of pro
duce ourselves. We're just get
ting into our stride, we felt,
with the close of the last al
bum. We just wanted to find
out if we couldn't make a clas
sic by ourselves. I know even
tually, if we ever have hit re
cords and stuff, I'd love to
work with all these guys, 'cause
when I'm an old man, I want to
tell my kids that I worked with
Roy Thomas Baker, George
Martin, Clyn Johns, and all

these people, and had lunch
with the Who.
You know, our idols are the
basics of rock. We want to be a
basic-diet band that you can
really get your teeth into, like
Creedence Clearwater Revival
or the Who. Just straight
ahead, no smoke bombs
needed. That's what we're
shooting for right now.
Daily: You played the East Coast
recently. How did that go?
Kihn: It went great. We played
before more people than we
ever have. We did lead act with
Louise Coffin opening up for
most of the tour; we headlined
Central Park. We did a few
shows opening up for real big
groups. We did two shows in
Philadelphia at the Spectrum
with The Cars. It was 20,000 a
night and it was crazed. It really
went good. I like playing the
big shows; you have to play
them different.
Usually opening bands don't
get any sound checks. So we
always have to suffer the slings
and arrows.
But they've got to do more
than deny us a sound check to
stop us, they'd have to unplug
the PA. I mean, we'd go out
and do an entire setacappella,
man. We don't care; we came

to play and nothing can stop
us. Most of the big gigs we do
are without sound checks. We
expect it, man; if we get one,
it's a luxury, and if we don't. . .
it's, like, the Beatles did whole
tours without sound checks.
We want to be the toughest
band alive, so we just eat
sound checks for lunch, you
know?
Daily: How did "Rendezvous"
come about?
Kihn: Brucie (Springsteen) gave
it to us. He saw us at the Roxy
(in L.A.) about a year ago, and
he came backstage. We were
talking and he mentioned this
song "Rendezvous" because
he'd really liked "For You." It
turned out that we were stay
ing at the same hotel, so we got
together at the pool the next
morning, and he gave me the
lyrics and stuff.
I really like Bruce a lot. He's
one of the true gentlemen of
rock and roll. We've met a lot
of assholes, but he's one of the
great gentlemen. A lot of 'em
come and go, but he's going to
be around for decades.
Daily: What do you think is your
best album?
Kihn: I like them all; I don't
have any favorites. I like every
thing. I even like Liberace.
A concert crowd that
knows it is about to hear
a local tavo te on the
near edge of national su<
cess is a happy and testive
crowd. And it was such a crowd
that gathered at the Keystone
Palo Alto to hear Greg Kihn and
his band.
The Berkeley-based group,
which only five years ago was
recording music available only
by mail-order, has now

churned out four albums, the
latest of which — In the Naked
Eye — made Billboard's Top
100. A new album is due out
early in 1980.
Since the formation of the
band half a decade ago, the
quartet has risen to the top of

the Bay Area rock scene. The
groups first album, Greg Kihn,
met with some local attention
and featured three-fourths of
the current membership of the
group: Kihn on rhythm guitar
and lead vocals, Larry Lynch on
drums and Steve Wright on
bass. Lead guitarist Dave Car
pender plugged in with the
band just before the second
album, Greg Kihn Again,
which was the first of the
group's albums to receive sub
stantial FM airplay.
The addition of Carpender
played a catalytic role in the

group's development. With a
fuller, complete sound, songs
such as "Madison Avenue
Man," "Love's Made a Fool of
You" and the cover version of
Bruce Springsteen's "For You"
impressed FM D|s and
foreshadowed an exciting fu

ture tor the embryonic group.
Their third album, Next of
Kihn, was released in 1977.
"Remember," a song as
memorable as its title, domi
nated among FM favorites for a
while and even received sparse
airplay on disco-dominated
AM.
The fourth and most recent
album, In the Naked Eye, con
sisted of shorter, more
commercially oriented songs
which have received both FM
and AM airplay. Although the
album did not achieve the mus
ical heights of its predecessor,

it served to propel the group
into the national spotlight.
Despite the attempt at com
mercialization, however, the
album stands out on its own
merits. The talents of each of
the group's members are effec
tively, if not extensively, dis
played. "Roadrunner" and
"Rendezvous" — another
