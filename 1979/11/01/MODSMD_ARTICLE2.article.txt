Its been a long tour weeks that we've spent on this magazine
and a long four months we've put into the Hoover article. And here
they are.
Jhe Stanford Daily Magazine is a different toimat than the regu
lar large-page Daily — one we can be innovative with simply be
cause it isn't the same as usual.
The Daily staff has labored over this first magazine, and each
department represented — features, entertainment and nev\s —
has contributed its due. To them our thanks, and to the people
who helped us bring the magazine and article to fruition, like
Randy David, Barbie Fields. Monika Guttman, Sara Lesslev, Alan
Matsumoto. Jay Mitchell andGary Reyna, the indetatigablegraphic
artist.
We helped this magazine happen this first time, but now that the
ball is rolling, we deliver it into other hands. This magazine is not
ours — the next issue v\ill be coordinated by others. To them good
luck, to you happy reading and to us a good night.
