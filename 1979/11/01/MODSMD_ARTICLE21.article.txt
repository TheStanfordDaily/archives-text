# Dylan all gone?
## 'The malleable idol... upfront and commonplace' 
### Tom Casciato 
In a soldier's stance I aimed my
hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my
enemy
In the instant that I preached
Bob Dylan probably won't
play "My Back Pages" dur
ing his upcoming stint at
San Francisco's Fox Warfield
Theater. Most likely he will
concentrate on celebrating his
newfound Christianity. "My
Back Pages" might sound out
of place alongside the dogma
tic hymns of the recently re
leased Slow Train Coming.
Of course, it's easy to take a
15-year-old quote, throw it in
the man's face, and cali him a
hypocrite. Vet the problem
with Dylan is not one of hypoc
risy. Paradoxically, change has
been the only constant of his
career and new directions have
always been accompanied by
critical indignation. He has al
ways been a malleable idol,
ruthlessly shaped and molded
by his devotees into their own
self-serving images. When he
quit protest in favor of more
personal songs, those who had
used him as both symbol and

ing, however, a single message
is rammed home song after
song after song.
"How long can you falsify
and deny what is real?
How long can you hate your
self for the weakness you con
ceal?
Of every earthly plan that be
known to man, he is uncon
cerned
He has plans of his own to set
up his throne when he re
turns."
There is nothing rich about the
language he uses or the images
he attempts to create, and for
the first time we know exactly
what he means. For the first
time, Bob Dylan is boring.
The music behind the mes
sage of the new songs is stan
dard commercial pop, geared
to appeal to as many people as
possible. Except for a few hot
licks by guitarist Mark Knopf
ler, it could have been played
by anybody.
It can be argued that he is
trying to demystify himself,
maintaining a high profile,
playing typical rock music, and
singing about a higher being as
if to scoff at those who have
called the singer himself a god.
But if his new accessibility de
stroys his myth, it doesn't give
us a glimpse of a real complex

father-figure felt abandoned.
When he discarded his acous
tic guitar in favorof a Stratocas
ter, the folkies called him
traitor. When he came back
playing country music after a
near-fatal motorcycle accident,
the rockers couldn't relate. On
Self-Portrait he committed the
unpardonable sin of playing
other people's compositions.
Last year he went officially
show-biz, complete with
horns, gospel singers and mas
cara, and the "sell-out" cry was
heard again. Now he is playing
slick rock and roll and singing
about Jesus. There is nothing
hypocritical in this. He is sim
ply changing his mind and style
again.
The problem is that Bob
Dylan just doesn't matter any
more. He's upfront and com
monplace. A Dylan concert
used to be a rare and exciting
occasion, but lately he has
toured extensively and now
he's playing a 14-night, Las
Vegas-like engagement at the
Fox Warfield. If you can't get a
ticket for the show, you can
turn on the television and see
him on Saturday Night Live,
just another special guest, as
accessible as Chicago. Maybe
in five years he'll be guest
hosting the Tonight Show.
But why look ahead five
years: the future is grim
enough. Dylan's new lyrics are
one dimensional. His best
work has always been charac
terized by irony, anger, inten
tional ambiguities and vaguely
threatening characters and
persons who lurk their way
down Desolation Row.
Maggie's Farm can be a
metaphor for any number of
places or institutions. The Idiot
Wind blows everywhere from
the Grand Coulee Dam to the
Capitol. On Slow Train Com

human being, but rather de
motes him from demigod to
mere rock star.
I'm afraid I'm just ranting,
caught in the trap into which all
Dylan loyalists eventually fall. I
want Dylan to be not what he
wants to be, but what I want
him to be. I want him to be
something personal, all mine.
In the past, despite Dylan's
wide-scale appeal, he wasn't
for everybody. You couldn't
just turn on the TV and find him
singing on a variety show. You
couldn't figure out what he
meant just by listening to the
songonce, you had towearout
the grooves. I worked for it,
and it was mine.
Now, with his narrow mes
sage and formula music he has
made himself appealing to
anybody and everybody, and
there's nothing about him I can
call my own anymore. I'm af
raid I've come to view Dylan as
an ex-lover gone promiscu
ous; if he's out there doing it
for everybody, what's so spe
cial about him ever having
done it for me?
But that's my problem. It's
my fault for having made him
more than just an ordinary star
in the first place. It would be
best to let the man be. He's
making a living doing what he
likes to do, and seems to have
found yet another reason to
keep on doing it.
Ironically, another passage
from "My Back Pages" might
sum up the feeling he expres
ses today:
"My existence led by confu
sion boats
Mutinied from stern to bow
But I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now."
And so, sadly, we part ways.
I'm older than that now and,
for me, Bob Dylan doesn't mat
ter any more.
