# Quintessential 'New Yorker'
## A 						cartoonist scribbling life on cocktail napkins 
### Michael Gorra 
His cartoons are comfort
able. Not comfortable
because in looking at
them you find yourself in a
familiar world — although they
are that too — but because
they do not appear meticulous,
do not appear to be precisely
drawn. His characters and
landscapes have soft edges;
backgrounds, tennis rackets,
drinking glasses, books, are
often |ust hinted at, because
they are not meant to be our
focus. His characters' clothing
fades out at the bottom of the
drawing, because he does not
draw complete human figures,
but halt ligures, which gives
them an air of informality even
when they are wearing lies.
frequently their hair is
tousled, not perfectly in place.
Their clothes are rumpled, ex
cept at the dinner table, and
their noses are always too big.
They are clearly not Beautiful
j People but instead possess a
well-bred scruffiness, as if their
i creator was aware that to make
them perfect would be a sign of
ill-breeding on both his part
and theirs, a hint of something
j terribly noveau.
The perfect gentleman must
always have a slight scuff on his
I shoes. William Hamilton
! knows that. His characters,
I"The Now Society," are not
drawn with the surgical preci
sion used by cartoonists for the
I skin magazines — publishing's
noveau. Hamilton is in many
ways the quintessential New
Yorker cartoonist, and that
magazine was never noveau.

not even when it was founded
m 1925.
His cartoons are social com
edies, set in restaurants,
around the family dinner table,
on tennis courts, at cocktail
parties, in boardrooms. No
body dies in them. We never
see anything macabre, al
though we do see divorce. But
divorce done tor fun, for
laughs.
His characters are meant to
be laughed at, not with, be
cause Hamilton does not give
Ins creations any conscious
ness that they are amusing. All
ot them, from lawyer to
housewife to novelist, take
themselves far too seriously.
And so we laugh at how terribly
involved they are with their
world, with their momentary
!c rises.
We laugh the harder, I think,
when we recognize our own
behavior in his drawings — if
we make the connection bet
ween his characters and our
selves.
Sometimes, of course, we
may be discomfited by the
connection, it we have not
made it before. "How many
(times do I have to tell you to
stay the hell away from me
iwhen I m writing poetry!" one
tigure glares at another.

Or, says a Bright Young
Thing to a young man (proba
bly a lawver — after a while,
one can recognize Hamilton's
lawyers) "You're stutty. That's
nice." Or a wife to her husband
(one presumes) on leaving a
party, "I almost died over your
pronunciation of oeuvre."
These may be small faults to
recognize in yourself. But they
sting a bit, and perhaps one
tries to be less stuffy, tries not
to yell at relatives who disturb
our pastimes, tries not to get
so upset at those who fall short
of our idealistic and idyllic
standards of Good Breeding.
There is that happy medium,
that range in which most of us
live, I think, in which we can
laugh at these cartoons with
out malice. They are about
people, characters, carica
tures, who are like our friends
and ourselves, at whom we can
laugh without malice. As
perhaps we can, or should be
able to, laugh at ourselves and
our friends.
Hamilton himself laughs at
his creations, but not against
them. "I don't feel repelled by
my characters," he says."I
don't despise them; I don't re
vere them either. I just know
them. I've grown up in that
world, and I suppose I would
take the same attitude towards
any world in which I grew up."
He claims not to approach
his cartoons as political state
ments, claims to lack a political
attitude toward the American
upper-middle class he depicts,
although he is quite willing to
make sport of that class' own
political attitudes: "You never
heard Thomas lefferson

apologize lor being a wealthy
liberal," says a man in a dinner
jacket.
This is finally why Hamilton's
cartoons are truly comfortable
ones. Not just graphically, not
just as pleasant drawings upon
which to rest the eye. Not just
because their furniture, the
cocktail parties, the restaur
ants are familiar. They are com
fortable because Hamilton is
willing to allow that furniture
to remain familiar without mak
ing us feel guilty about it, with
out making us apologize for if.
He makes us laugh at it and
at ourselves, perhaps discon
certing us for a moment, until
we realize that being discon
certed is good because it
shows that we still have some
distance, some perspective on
our actions. This too is reassur
ing, as is the teeling we get
when we close one of his
books: that in his drawings,
ordinary, comfortable, dull
daily lite goes on, no matter
what.
It Hamilton's cartoons con
cern themselves with a par
ticular class, they also deal
with a particular region. He is a
carioofiist uf the Eastern sea
board, ot Boston and New York
and Philadelphia and their
suburbs. So it is surprising at

first to realize that Hamilton is !
not a native of the society he so
wittily depicts. He was instead'
born in Palo Alto in 1939, and i
grew up on his parents' ranch '
in the Napa Valley. His mother ;
still lives there, with his step- i
father; Hamilton says his own [
father died while he was a j
junior in college. Now he lives |
in San Francisco, near Cow j
Hollow.
He has, however, only been 1
back on the West Coast tor five j
years. When he was 14, his pa- !
rents sent him to Phillips
Academy in Andover, Mas
sachusetts, the oldest boys'
boarding school in the coun
try, located in a small New Eng
land town of clapboard houses
and sugar maples. After An
dover he went to Yale, in some
ways the most provincially
Eastern of all the Ivy League
schools, from which he was
graduated in 1962. In 1964 he
was drafted; in 1965 he began
to sell cartoons to The New
Yorker and lived in New York
until he moved back to the Bay
Area.
Hamilton claims, however,
that his life in the East was
spent as an outsider, a
stranger, which gave him an
advantage. He could watch
Eastern life, could observe the
nuances of speech and dress
without having to become part
of them — "I wasn't as blind to

it as if I'd grown up in it." — yet
without having to reject them
either.
Most writers cannot tell of
the place from which they've
come with balanced emotions.
They either hate it or love it.
Hamilton does not have the
same moral or emotional stake
in Eastern life as he would if
he'd grown up in Westchester
County.
We meet for lunch in a sort
of cliche-cafe — small, round,
marble table-tops, cane
bottomed chairs — around the
corner from his apartment. I
begin to ask questions, and he
does not want to falk. He
seems shy, reticent, barely
answers questions about his
personal background; he is
separated from his wife and
has a seven-year-old daughter.
Only later does he note that his
marital situation is a rich sub-

"Are you |uit taking pMurei or «re you doing photographyT

ject, that "It I were happily
married I wouldn't have any
thing to draw."
He has been taking up pens
since before he went to An
dover but never made cartoon
ing a profession until he got
out of the Army, when he was
"desperate to find some way of
living without working. That
drove me to cartooning. I sent
out millions of them." His first
sale was to Cycle World, fol
lowed by Gourmet, and then
The New Yorker, which he says
is "the top of the heap unless
you want to do cartoons about
fornication."
Hamilton has been under
contract to The New Yorker
ever since. They get first choice
of all his cartoons; in return he
receives a regular advance —
"it's not much" — against any
drawings they do take. Their


"If only Haydn could have heard himself in quad "

regular fee is hard to calculate,
he says, because any earnings
over the advance are sent to
him at the end of the year, and
are "skewed around accorJing
to the cost of living and
things."
The rest of his work is syndi
cated as a daily cartoon under
the title "The Now Society" by
Universal Press Syndicate, with
whom he's been for "between
five and seven years." The car
toon now appears in about 30
newspapers and has the "mar
velous advantage of supplying
an income."
Hamilton says he can't do
enough cartoons to give his
syndicate a choice, and in fact
would like to do even fewer. At
the moment, however, he says
he can't afford that, and so
periodically threatens to stop
altogether in order to shake a
better deal out of Universal
Press.
I flip through the book of his
drawing, Husbands, Wives and
Live-Togethers, which I've
brought along, and say, "I can
almost pick out which ones
were in The New Yorker, and
which were in the newspaper."
I pick a cartoon. It shows one
couple parting from another in
a doorway. The caption reads,
"Ciao, Joan, that was an incred
ibly together duck." Definitely
from7he New Yorker, I say. He
smiles and says no, because
"New Yorker has a way of not
buying what you think they
should." He seems to agree
with me that this cartoon, at
least, is one they should have
taken.
I ask the classic trite question
about the sources of his mate
rial. How does he keep up with
"The Now Society"? The ans
wer is embarrassingly simple.
Newspapers. Listening to the
radio while at the easel. Par
ties. And "Hanging out. I hang
out a lot."
Most of the people with
whom he hangs out now are
writers or other artists, who
"tend to gravitate toward each
other because people in the
arts share certain problems."
But he does not gravitate to
ward other cartoonists, who
are generally "morose, dif
ficult people, who are all such
misfits that they don't seem to
make good gathering mate
rial."
He does not seem to exclude
himself from this, and al
though an occasional question
makes him catch fire, sparks a
minute-long reply, he does not
in general say much. Sons mots
are saved for the easel.
We leave the restaurant.
Walking beside him, back to
his apartment, I realize for the
first time how tall he is — 6-ft 4
in. or so, with a classic WASP
snub nose and receding black
hair. He has a slender but
sturdy basketball player's
build. I ask about sports. They
were required at Andover, but
Hamilton says " I wasn't good at
sports as a kid. I took a long
time to grow." Tennis is the
only game he has pfayed con
sistently. Watching him walk,
one believes that his growth
came late. His gait is awkward,
his walk a series of stiff, jerking
strides He does not appear to
have gotten used to the idea of
being 6-4, does not appear at
all comfortable with his size or
body.
I ask ibout other types of
writing, about what other
things he has written in all the
years he 's been making his liv

ing as a cartoonist. "I've writ
ten some 'Notes and Com
ments' torThe New Yorker. But
there's no money in it, really,
no market for short stories. It
doesn't seem to be a time of
great readership.'' Novels?
"I've never been able to write
them, although I've tried. I
suppose I like the fast hit of a
cartoon or play. Writing a
novel is such a sustained un
dertaking, which someone im
patient — like I am — finds
hard to sustain." He laughs.
"They're like a tapestry, and
I'm a water-color man."
One type of writing pays very
well and does not call for such
a sustained effort: television
scripts. But Hamilton hasn't
"thought very much about
television, probably because
you don't become a writer
doing that. It's not worth what
they pay you. It's much more
important to find out who you
are as an artist." His voice takes
on a harsher edge; he has
rarely shown any sort of emo
tion during our conversation,
aside from an occasional
chuckle, but now he seems al
most angry.
"Once I was offered a job as
a gag writer for johnny Carson.
But it didn't look like a good
deal. All you got was money,
johnny Carson got the gags.
They're not your gags but his,
even though you wrote them.
In the end you've got nothing.
You might as well have been a
lawyer."
He smiles at the line, appears
to like it. The birth of a caption,
perhaps, of a caption that no
actor will be able to fake away
from him.
