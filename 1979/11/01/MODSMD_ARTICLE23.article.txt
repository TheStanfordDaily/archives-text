Mamie Eisenhower dies at 82
Washington — Former first lady Mamie Eisenhower
died peacefully in her sleep early today at Walter
Reed Hospital, officials said.
The widow of former President Dwight Eisenhower
was 82, said hospital spokesman Pete Esker. Her 83rd
birthday was two weeks away.
Doctors attributed her death at 1:35 a.m. to heart
failure, Esker said.
Eisenhower had been at the hospital since Sept. 25
for treatment of a stroke, he said.
Three Mile report 'far reaching'
Washington — Members of the Three Mile Island
commission told congressional critics yesterday that
the final report of their investigation is far reaching,
even though it does not recommend a nuclear
moratorium.
John Kemeny, chairman of the presidential com
mission, told a joint congressional hearing that the
day-old report recommends strong medicine for the
nuclear industry and its government regulators.
But the 179-page report on the March 28 nuclear
accident drew strong criticism from the chairmen of
the two congressional panels that oversee nuclear
power. They said its recommendations didn't go far
enough.
"In the absence of a moratorium there will be a
tendency to use Band-Aids where surgery is re
quired,"said Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.),chairmanof
the House Interior Committee.
And Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), chairman ot the Se
nate Nuclear Regulatory subcommittee, said, "I am
troubled by the commission's decision not to re
commend a delay in construction of new plants."
But Kemeny, president of Dartmouth College, con
tended the commission recommended what
amounts to a form of moratorium. He pointed to the
panel's recommendations that no new nuclear plants
be licensed unless major safety improvements are

incorporated, the plant operator agrees to live up to
tough new standards and unless the state has an
approved evacuation plan on the books.
Laser weapon potential explored
Washington — The Air Force research chief said
yesterday the United States probably could develop a
workable laser beam weapon against some Soviet
satellites within about four years.
But Lt. Gen. Thomas Stafford said "we decided not
to push it." Instead, he said, "we would hope to
negotiate a treaty" with the Soviet Union that would
ban such weapons.
A high-intensity laser generates a concentrated
beam of light that scientists say could burn out a
satellite's electronic circuits and key equipment, thus
disabling it. The United States also has explored the
possibility of using lasers against hostile missiles and
planes.
Such a system would be placed on mountaintops
and aimed at satellites in low-altitude orbits. Many
spy satellites using cameras and infra-red detecting
devices operate in low orbits.
Stafford said the Russians are doing research on
beam weapons, "as we are." He did not indicate
whether the United States or the Soviet Union is
ahead.
Congress trims defense budget
Washington — House and Senate negotiators
reached agreement yesterday on a $547.6 billion 1980
budget that trims the Senate's demand for sharply
higher defense spending by $700 million.
The Senate had called for a 3 percent increase
above inflation in defense spending. The com
promise outlay for defense calls for $129.9 billion in
fiscal 1980 spending, about a V/i percent "real" in
crease.
The compromise came as House and Senate
negotiators voiced increasing concern about the lack

of a congressional budget one month into the new
1980 fiscal year, which started Oct. 1.
The compromise proposal, which still must be ap
proved by the House and Senate, projects a $29.8
billion deficit, slightly higher than the red-ink spend
ing for fiscal 1979.
Carter proposes aid to Chrysler
Washington — The Carter administration tenta
tively has decided to propose more than $1 billion in
federal loan guarantees to help the ailing Chrysler
Corp. avert bankruptcy, sources said last night.
The aid package, which must be approved by Con
gress, is about double what the administration previ
ously has indicated it would be willing to recommend
to keep Chrysler afloat.
The aid package that the administration will prop
ose approximates the $1.2 billion in loan guarantees
that Chrysler officials originally sought from the ad
ministration in September, according to sources,
who asked not to be named. The company sub
sequently trimmed its request back to $750 million
after Treasury Secretary G. William Miller said $1.2
billion was too high.
Dow Jones drops 8.11
New York — The Dow Jones average of 30 indust
rials dropped 8.11 t0815.70, erasing more than half of
Tuesday's 15.19-point advance.
The average wound up with a 62.88 loss for Oc
tober, a month in which both the stock and bond
markets were rocked by the Federal Reserve's new
plans for clamping down on credit.
Today's weather
Fair through Friday. Cool nights but a little warmer
days. Lows in the mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the mid
60s to mid 70s. Northwest winds 10 to 20 mph after
