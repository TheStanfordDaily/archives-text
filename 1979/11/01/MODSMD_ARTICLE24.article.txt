## Mexico City plane crash leaves 71 dead Western Airlines DC-10 from Los Angeles goes down on wrong runway 
### 
Mexico City (AP) — Inves
tigators are examining cockpit
recordings to determine why a
Western Airlines DC-10 from
Los Angeles touched down on
the wrong runway and crashed
at Mexico City's fog-shrouded
airport yesterday, killing 71 of
the 88 persons aboard, officials
said.
Three persons also were re
ported killed on the ground as
the jetliner skidded out of con
trol and smashed into a truck
and two buildings.
Red Cross and U.S. consular
officials said 63 bodies were re
covered and there was no hope
that the eight missing persons
would be found alive.
An airline spokesman said
the pilot, Capt. Charles Gil
bert, 53, of Rolling Hills, Calif.,
was among those killed.
"Everybody didn't die right
away. Some were trying to get
out. Some of them . . . they
were crying Help, Help!' then
they were either calm or some
thing must have happened to
them," said Pandora Scott, 19,
of Chico, Calif., a passenger.

As the huge jet broke apart
chunks of wreckage cut
through a slum tenement dis
trict, but rescue workers said
they did not find any victims in
the area.
A Western Airlines spokes
man in Los Angeles said there
were 77 passengers and 11
crew aboard Flight 605 on its
regular early morning run to
Mexico City. Earlier, the Mexi
can government said there
were 89 persons on the flight
and a U.S. Embassy official had
listed 90.
The Mexican Department of
Communications and Trans
portation said the accident
probably occured because the
plane tried to land on a runway
that had been declared closed
for almost two weeks. The offi
cials said they would examine
black box tape recordings of
communications between the
plane's crew and the control
tower.
Mexican officials said a pre
liminary check of control
tower communications "con
firm that the pilot was au-

thorized to use runway No.
23-right, which is in use."
An official said runway No.
23-left, which has a sophisti
cated instrument landing sys
tem preferred by pilots, was
closed on Oct. 19 for repair
work. All airlines were notified
of the closure and were in
structed to land on the adja
cent No. 23-right.
In Washington, a spokesman
for the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) said the
major question is why the pilot
was attempting to land on a
closed runway. Mexican
authorities hope the black box
will provide answers. FAA and
National Transportation Safety

Board members will be in
Mexico to observe the
investigation, authorities said.
"It was definitely not
structural; there's no question
about that," said FAA
spokesman Dennis Feldman in
Washington. He said the crash
was caused by an unknown
approach-and-landing error.
McDonnell Douglas sent its
own team of investigators from
its Long Beach, Calif.,
assembly facility, to aid in the
crash investigation
In Los Angeles, Linda
Dozier, director of public rela
tions for Western Airlines, said
the ill-fated plane was a substi
tute for another DC-10

scheduled tor flight 605 which
was grounded tor routine
maintenance.
Manuel Bustamante, a
spokesman for the Mexican
Civil Aviation Administration,
refused to speculate on the
cause of the crash.
Mexico City international
airport handles more than 500
flights a day, the bulk of it
commercial. For about six
hours traffic was diverted to al
ternate airports in the country
The airport is considered dif
ficult by pilots, with mountains
nearby and with about one
million persons living in 20
blocks surrounding the field.
