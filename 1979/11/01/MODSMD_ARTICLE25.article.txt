# Student group forms to assist Cambodians
## 
### Brad Crystal 
The Stanford Coalition for
Indochinese Relief, a student
organization created Tuesday
night, is looking for a means to
raise $10,000 to help aid the
millions of displaced and starv
ing people in Cambodia.
About 25 students attended
the organizational meeting.
Initiated by Stanford Hillel's
Social Action Committee, the
coalition is comprised of rep
resentatives from a variety of
campus ethnic and religious
groups.
Hillel member Andy Weiner
said the purpose of the coali
tion is to provide "short-term
emergency help, which will
carry Cambodia through the
agricultural crisis it is facing
until it can get back on its feet
again."
The widely documented
hunger problem in the strife
torn country has earned Cam
bodia the nickname, the "Au
schwitz of Asia."
"The Cambodian situation is
unprecedented," Weiner said.
Although the coalition's
original plan was to request a
$2 spring quarter fee assess
ment, that idea may have to be
scrapped because the Univer
sity's status as a non-profit
educational institution nor
mally requires that money col
lected from students be chan
neled back into the school, ac
cording to Dean of Student Af
fairs lames Lyons.
"There is nobody, however,
who wouldn't support the
urgency of responding in some
helpful way to the situation in
Cambodia," Lyons said.
At a meeting yesterday with
membersof the ASSU Council
of Presidents, Lyons suggested

the establishment of a
permanent campus-wide
charity to collectively raise
funds.
A "community chest" or
ganization existed at one time
here, but was disbanded in the
late 60s when student partici
pation in "establishment" or
ganizations was at an all-time
low, Cart said.
Lyons' proposal has been
warmly accepted by leaders of
thecoalition. Hillel representa
tive Sandra Shanker said she
hopes the fundraisers "will not
only raise a lot of money for
Cambodia, but raise the con
sciousness of students regard
ing the impact of this issue."
A benefit concert, film
series, rallies and dorm solici
tations are among the fund
raising events the coalition has
proposed. But because of the
immediacy of Cambodia's dire
food scarcity, the coalition
would prefer to borrow the
money now, and repay it
spring quarter, said Shanker.
The money would be given
to a reputable international re
lief group and earmarked di
rectly for Cambodia, according
to Weiner.
To obtain a loan, the coali
tion plans to draw up a charter
of specific objectives and pre
sent it to Vice President of De
velopment Joel Smith. If he
approves, Smith would help
find a corporate or individual
lender.
Also, despite Lyons' reserva
tions over the legal status of a
fee assessment, coalition rep
resentative Brian Rosman will
meet tomorrow with Univer
sity legal counsel )ohn
Schwartz to consider an as
sessment in light of the ex
traordinary Cambodian prob
lems.
