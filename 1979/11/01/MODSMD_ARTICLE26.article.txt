# 33% graduate annually with honors
## Percentage here lower than some other top schools 
### Richard Kim 
Almost one third of all Stan
ford seniors graduate with
honors, according to figures
from the Office of Under
graduate Studies — a smaller
percentage than at many other
top universities.
In 1976 and 1977, an average
of 33 percent of the graduating
class received some form of
academic honors ranging from
Phi Beta Kappa distinction to
departmental honors or Uni
versity Distinction. Academic
departments select the stu
dents who will receive Univer
sity Distinction. Departmental
honors are awarded to those
who undertake special pro
jects within a department,
while Phi Beta Kappa is an in
dependent organization.
Departments are not ex
pected to confer University
Distinction on more than a
quarter of their students, said
Bill Washburn, research coor
dinator of the Undergraduate
Studies Office.
The percentage of students
who receive honors is rela
tively low compared to some
Eastern universities. For exam
ple, approximately 45 percent
of the graduating class at Yale
University receives honors.
The honors are divided into

three levels and are based sol
ely on grades.
Despite the large percen
tage, Ray Suttle of the Depart
ment of Institutional Statistics
at Yale, said the honors system
is "relatively stable. In fact,
there is not even a whisper
about changing the require
ments."
At Princeton University,
about 40 percent of the
graduating seniors receive
honors. They must be recom
mended by the faculty of at
least one department. Accord
ing to the Registrar's Office at
Princeton, those students who
graduate with honors generally
have a 90 percent average or
better.
Stanford's Dean of Under
graduate Studies,
Katchadourian said he "feels
good that a substantial number
of students are doing well
enough to get honors." He ad
ded, however, that he's trou
bled that people sometimes
think, "Gee, it must not be very
difficult."
Nevertheless, Katchadou
rian said, "Nothing is being
done to change the grading
policy."
Registrar Sally Mahoney,
said the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Achievement has been discus

sing a "higher level of distinc
tion concerning a much smal
ler group of people." Mahoney
added the idea was first prop
osed several years ago and has
been reviewed by the Faculty
Senate several times.
University of Chicago re
quires seniors to have a
minimum average of 3.25 on a 4
scale to graduate with honors.
Last year, 42 percent of the
seniors were awarded honors.
Duke University issues hon
ors to about one-half of their
graduating seniors. A student
must have a 3.0 average or
higher on a scale of four to re
ceive honors.
At Indiana's Northwestern
University, seniors are ranked
by their grade point average
with the top 5 percent graduat
ing with honors. The honors
are divided into two levels with
the highest 2 percent receiving
highest distinction and the re
maining 3 percent receiving
distinction.
UCLA awards honors to ap
proximately 25 percent of its
graduating class. Honors are
determined by grade average
with 3.4 being the minimum.
Some schools such as UC-
Berkeley and Cornell Univer
sity do not keep records of
what proportion of seniors
graduate with honors.
