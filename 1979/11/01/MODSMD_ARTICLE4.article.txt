# The 						Hoover institution: the might of the right?

/ /"T"he purpose of this Institution must be, by its
I research and publications, to de
monstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx —
whether Communism, Socialism, economic
materialism, or atheism — thus to protect the Ameri
can way of life from such ideologies, their con
spiracies, and to reaffirm the validity of the American
system."
This statement was written by Herbert Hoover,
former president of the United States and founder of
the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace,
for a 1959 pamphlet prepared for University trustees.
The frank, unadorned language of the paragraph is
easily remembered; it may be the most widely known
declaration to emanate from the Institution.

Also, the seemingly large
sweep of the paragraph is ideal
for those who seek simplistic,
quickly digested, buzz-word
knowledge of the Hoover.
But the Hoover Institution is
no longer just a world-famous
library and archives and small
research staff concerned
mainly with Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union.
The Hoover's budget has in
creased from less than $400,000
in 1959-bO to $2.1 million in
1970-71 to an estimated $5.7
million for the current fiscal
year.
The funding for research has
increased from a 9 percent

share of the budget 20 years
ago to approximately a 40 per
cent share today. The number
of senior fellows and senior re
search fellows has more than
doubled since the early 70s,
when there were 18. This major
increase largely reflects the
addition in this decade of a
domestic studies program
which now receives roughly as
much support as the long
standing international studies
program does. And further, a
national fellows program, br
inging young scholars to the
Hoover for a year-long re
search period, was started in
1971 (see box this page).
The Institution archives, be
sides housing such items as of
ficial records of the Nazi Party
and files of the Czarist secret
police, expand at the rate of
approximately "100 new col
lections per year," according
to Deputy Archivist Charles
Palm.
The Hoover Library's fund
ing is now more than $4 mill
ion. In the current fiscal year,
anestimateds2.l million of that
will come from the Institution,
with the rest coming from Uni
versity general funds. More
than 1.3 million books, as well
as 24,000 magazines and 6000
newspaper titles are kept in the
library. Although it has de
clined as a percentage of the
total budget, the Hoover's
spending on its library has
more than doubled in the past
decade.
Forty-nine titles including
reprints will be published by
the Hoover Institution Press
this year, nearly tripling the
publishing totals from a de
cade ago.
In 1978, the Herbert Hoover
Memorial building was com
pleted, adding nearly 100 of
fices (see box page 6). As
sociate Director Darrel Trent,
who along with Senior Fellow
Rita Ricardo Campbell helped
oversee the building's con
struction, said "I think we have
the finest research facility in

the country. Perhaps in the
world."
In short, as Richard Staar, as
sociate director of the Hoover
observes, "the growth here
has been astonishing, to say
the least."
Although much more dif
ficult to measure pre
cisely, the Institu
tion s impact on public policy
formulation has increased.
Clearly, the addition of the
domestic studies program has
brought greater national atten
tion to the Hoover.
"Our work is more interest
ing now to the typical con

gressman, who didn't care
what went on in China, but
does care whether or not his
constituents can fly back and
forth across the country at low
rates," said Thomas Moore,
senior fellow at the Institution
and director of the domestic
studies program.
"I think domestic studies
may have attracted more atten
tion for that reason," he con
tinued. "International studies
was always policy-relevant, but
only to a group of people who
were focused on international
problems. All you have to do is
take a count of the number of
bureaucrats in Washington
concerned with international
problems and those con
cerned with domestic policy
and I'm sure the ration must be
one to 10."

A senior staff member of the
President's Council of
Economic Advisers from 1968-
1970, Moore thinks he has had
"a major impact in fostering a
movement toward deregula
tion in transportation, includ
ing airlines, trucking and rail
road deregulation." In fact,
displayed prominently in
Moore's office is a letter from
Sen. Edward Kennedy ID-
Mass.) thanking the senior fel
low for his work in airline de
regulation.
Milton Friedman, Nobel
Prize winner and Hoover
senior research fellow, writes a
Newsweek column, and his
widely disseminated views
have also influenced public
policy. Friedman, Alexander
Solzhenitsyn and Friedrich
Hayek are the three Nobel
Prize-winners associated with
the Hoover.
Editorials by members of the
Hoover staff appear regularly
in major newspapers, includ
ing the New York Times and
the Wall Street Journal.
Economist Rita Ricardo
Campbell, Hoover senior fel
low, believes she has had "a
considerable impact on pol
icy," citing her testimony for
the Senate Finance Committee
and her work in the health, so
cial security and drug sectors
as examples. Campbell, who
considers herself a feminist,
also played a major role in leg
ally defining working women's
pregnancies as temporary
work disabilities.
Senior Fellow Martin Ander
son, who served as a special
assistant to former President
Richard Nixon, is working as a
policy adviser in Ronald
Reagan's bid for the 1980 Re
publican presidential nomina
tion. He filled the same post in
the 1976 campaign.
Trent is considering offers
from Reagan and"from at least
two of the other (Republican)
candidates to be part of their
campaign staffs." Reagan is an
honorary fellow at the Hoover
(see box page 4).
"I welcome the fact that
serious candidates for the
highest oitice in the land con
side ur staff members to be
sufficiently qualified and with
sufficient good judgment to
want our staft member's ad
vice," said W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the In
stitution since 1959.

Campbell sees nothing
wrong with having an Institu
tion on "war, revolution and
peace" heavily involved in
domestic politics. "I don't
think there was ever any ques
tion in the founder's mind that
domestic studies was included
within the rubric of 'war, re
volution and peace.' In fact, if
you go back to the '30s you'll
find that we had a New Deal
collection at the Hoover In
stitution. In the meantime, for
financial reasons, and also be
cause of the interests of my
predecessors, who were prac
tically all history professors,
the domestic studies program
was slow in developing."
A full-fledged domestic

studies program began in the
early 70s. Campbell said that
the best time to have begun a
domestic program'would have
been prior to 1971, during the
so-called campus unrest, that
period in which many people
thought we faced revolution
domestically. You're talking to
a man who's very proud of the
fact that the Hoover Institution
was never occupied by protes
ters."
As the Hoover's impact on
policy increases, the be
liefs of people at the
Institution have become more
important.
"Many of the staff, at least on
the domestic side, are "liberal
in the 19th Century sense," ac

cording to Moore, who con
siders himself a libertarian.
"We tend to ask other ques
tions," he continued. "Brook
ings (Institution, in
Washington, D.C.) might ask
'How can we devise a new
program to help poor people?'
We might ask, 'Does that prog
ram indeed help poor people?'
If it doesn't, then even Brook
ings will have to stop and think,

'Well, maybe this isn't a prog
ram we should he pushing and
supporting.' For example, a
liberal institution like Brook
ings wouldn't ask whether or
not the minimum wage actually
worked."
Similarly, Senior Fellow and
Political Science and Sociology
Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset
said some people at the Institu
tion are trying to learn why
government regulation con
tinues even though
"economists will demonstrate
beyond a shadow of theoreti
cal doubt" that regulation
doesn't work. "Somebody is
something out of this"
or the government would not
continue to pass new regula

tions, he said.
Friedman said that the
Hoover's importance lies not
in its values, but in the quality
of its research. "Most differ
ences about policy reflect a dif
ference in scientific consequ
ences, not in values."
Like Moore, Friedman cited
the minimum wage as an
example: "Everyone wants to
employ and feed people; the
difference is that people disag
ree about ' : "e effect of an in
creased minimum wage."
Market economics Friedman
and Moore said that a higher
minimum wage in tact hurts
poor people because it re
duces the number of low
paying jobs businesses can of

fer, th increasing un
employr among the poor.
Friedn saici he thought
many Hot ; r employees be
lieve that government should
be limited and perform only a
few, well-defined functions.
Although Friedman added,
"This belief is by no means, of
course, uniform or universal at
Hoover," it is difficult to find
serious disagreement with this
basic notion at the Institution.
As Associate Director Trent
puts it,"I think when it comes
down to making a decision on
who can better spend your
money, yourself or the gov
ernment, I can tell you from
first-hand experience that you
probably can."
In a speech summarizing the
findings of the Hoover's up
coming United States in the
'80s, a volume of issues
analysis and prescription,
Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka
did little to weaken the conser
vative, free-market image of
the Institution. Rabushka, co
editor of the book, spoke re
cently at the Stanford Alumni
Association's "Issues of the
'80s'' forum.
Rabushka proclaimed that an
"era of limits" is coming. The
first signs are growing move
ments favoring decreased
taxes. California's famous
Proposition 13 was a "good
thing,"accordingto Rabushka,
and he welcomed the spread of
such initiatives throughout the
country.
"Deregulation and in
creased competition are better
than big government," said
Rabushka. The collection con-

As Associate Director Trent puts it, 'I think when it
comes down to making a decision on who can better
spend your money,yourself or the government, I can
tell you from first-hand experienceyou probably can.'

nature of being a good person,' said Peter Duignan,
head of the Institution's African pr dm.
eludes that the "price
mechanism" usually works
better than any other
economic force. Increased pri
vate activity in the welfare sec
tor is advocated in the volume,
said Rabushka, who con
tinued, "The welfare system
has destroyed work incentives
for the poor."
Rabushka went on to report
that those contributing to the
domestic portion of the book,
predominantly Hoover fel
lows, favor the deregulation of
crude oil, reduction of gov
ernment involvement in hous
ing, elimination of federal
budget deficits, economic im
pact statements when new
regulations are proposed, and
a shift toward fiscal conser
vatism throughout the coun
try. Rabushka quoted Thomas
Jefferson, saying, "a govern
ment that governs least gov
erns best."
On the international
side, Campbell said
that he would
have phrased Hoover's famous
anti-Marxist paragraph "difte
rently." But he justified the
paragraph's wording by saying
that it was endorsed unanim
ously by then-University Presi
dent Wallace Sterling and the
Board of Trustees.
Asked whether one of the pur
poses of the Institution is still
to "demonstrate the evils of
the doctrines of Karl Marx,"
Campbell replied, "to the ex
tent they should be criticized,
of course."
Opponents of Communism
hold prominent positions in
the international studies prog
ram. Richard Staar, associate
director of the Institution and
head ot international studies
does not call himself an "anti
communist." But he did say
that he is "against com
munism. It's an evil system. An
inhuman system. So I am
against it. If you wan! to call

that anti-communism. that'sl
anti-communism. But I am nut!

Duignan continued, "The
United States should make it a '

Cold War attitude of contain

There's nothing there. It's only
for strategic purposes. That's a
choke point. The U.S.S.R.
wants to be able to pressure
the U.S. and Western Europe
by a slow or sudden stoppage
of supplies."
Terming this scenario "the
'Finlandization' of Western
Europe," Duignan warned that
it the United States doesn't
show resolve, the Soviets will
soon assume a virtual veto
power over the foreign policy
and security decisions of
Western European leaders.
Duignan said that the United
States should provide tor
"legitimate needs," such as

states.

Political science Assoc. Prot.
David Abernethv specialist on
Atrican politics said that he

'The Hoover Institution has far more value for their
library and archives than tor the research they
produce,' said former Hoover Senior Fellow and
Historv Prof. Alexander Dallin.


Thomas Moore
"just doesn't agree with Duig
nan on that (containment)."
Abernethy added that Duig
nan's position "may involve an
overestimation of the military
threat that the Russians or Cu
bans represent in Africa. The
Russians have suffered great
defeats recently — in Egypt,
Somalia, Ghana."
And Staar wouldn't go so far
as Duignan either. "I don't
think that containment is a via
ble policy today," he said. "I
think containment was a policy
you could pursue if you had
superiority. Today we don't
have that — we're inferior. I
think competition is the name
of the game, not contain
ment."
! In summing up the interna
tional section of United States
in the '80s volume, co-editor
Duignan expanded on the
theme of increased competi
tion with the Soviets.
In his speech at the "Issues
of the '80s" forum, Duignan
didn't mention containment,
but he did report that the pre
dictions in the Hoover's up
coming book had "scared the
hell" out of him.
The contributors to the in
ternational portion of the vol- |
ume, who include Duignan
I and Staar as well as Senior Fel
-1 low Lewis Cann, Senior Re-
I search Fellow Edward Teller
j and Hoover consultant Yuan-Li
| Wu, concluded that the United
| States has lost superiority to
I the Soviets, that the United j
i States is in a "race for survival," |
1 and that the "Soviets believe [
they can fight, survive and win !
I a nuclear war," Duignan said. |
Duignan also said that "The
! United States must plan for a
I long war as well as a short one
... replace rhetoric with re
solve, replace detente with re
solute defense and produce
more tanks than cars."
Duignan and Rabushka's
ideologically consistent
summations of the
Hoover's most ambitious and
expensive volume yet
exemplify the lack of disag
reement among the Hoover
fellows on political issues.
I 'We're not monolithic,"

Moore says. But Soviet
specialist Alexander Dallin,
history professor here and
former senior fellow at the
Hoover, said that the skewing
| of political views toward the
1 right "is more than random, to
j put it mildly."
One former visiting fellow,
| who preferred to remain
anonymous, said, "The
Hoover Institution is an amal
j gam of free market economists
! in the domestic situation and
cold warriors on the interna- !

tional side."
The charge that the Hoover's
political outlook affects its
choice of research and the
findings of its research is not a
new one.
"Hoover has not changed,"
the former visiting fellow said.
Dallin said, "There are
criteria being applied beyond
just academic excellence,"
They don't go through the
lengthy and rigorous process
of finding faculty, he con
tinued. "By and large, they
know whom they want and
they go ahead and make ap
pointments."
Politics have also adversely
affected the quality of the
Hoover's work, critics have ar
gued. "The Hoover Institution
has far more value for their lib
rary and archives than for the
research they produce," said
Dallin.
Calling the Hoover's political
outlook "outrageous," the
former visiting fellow said "the
thinking of the people at the
Hoover is second-rate and
most Hoover fellows are third
rate."
The former visiting fellow di

reefed some of his criticism at
the Hoover's International
Communist Yearbook. Staar
edits the annual volume and
calls it a "research tool that
doesn't have a political view
point."
The former visiting fellow
disagreed, saying the yearbook
"poses as being descriptive"
but is actually "value-laden."
Dallin added that the yearbook
"could be much improved,
largely in terms of political in
sights."

Lipset admits that before he
came to the Institution, he was
bothered a little by Hoover's
general political image. "I
think that an essentially
academic institution shouldn't
have political images, and that
the politicization of academic
institutions, whether from the
left or right, is wrong. People
shouldn't be hired and work
shouldn't be evaluated in
terms of people's politics."
But Lipset, a Democrat, has
found that political considera
tions haven't affected his work
or "the choice of people, at
least in our bailiwick" (sociol
ogy and political science).
Dallin agreed that the
Hoover didn't try to dictate
work. But he found himself
"out of tune too much with the
dominant political view" at the
Institution. "I felt uncomforta
ble and constrained in expres
sing my own views," he con
tinued. Dallin said he feels
"cleaner and freer now that
he has left the Hoover.
The Hoover staft considers
the charge that the Institu
tion is not balanced
and is lacking opposing view
points to be a "bum rap," as
Trent put it.
Campbell said he thinks the
Hoover is in "the mainstream"
politically, and said that there
is "no ideological saliva test"
involved in the Institution's re
cruitment of staff.
Campbell doesn't think that
the perception of the Institu
tion as a "right-thinking think
tank" has damaged the
Hoover's recruitment. "If
someone is going to bothered
by that label,'' Campbell said,
"or ashamed of the Institution
by what I consider to be an un
fair label, I don't think he
would want to be here or we
would really want him."
Teller said he feels no politi
cal constraints at the Hoover:

One former visiting fellow said, 'The Hoover
Institution is an amalgam of free market economists
in the domestic situation and cold warriors on the
international side.'

"If anything attracted me tothe
Hoover Institution, it was its
liberal orientation. Liberal in
the somewhat basic sense of
the word, namely, being toler
ant oiall ideas, even right-wing
ideas. The 'liberals,' these
days, are intolerant of some
ideas, and therefore, in an
older sense of the word, they
are not liberal at all. I have
found no such intolerance at
Hoover, not of liberal ideas,
not of conservative ideas."
"There's more diversity at
Hoover than people give us
■credit for, not only in terms of
resident long-term staff, but in
terms of the fellowship prog
ram and in terms of our publi
cations and programs," Duig
nan says. "Let's face it; the fact
of university life around the
country is that there aren't very
many conservatives in
academia any longer. You
couldn't run a research prog
ram with just conservatives.
"Clearly, there's again a
double standard," Duignan
continued. "If Hoover does it,
if it has more conservatives
than liberals, that's somehow
rather evil. But how many Stan
ford departments and how
many university faculties even
attempt to have balance. One
can argue that Hoover is more
balanced on this question of
liberal, left, conservative. We
have more of the left liberal
side than they have of the con
servative side in their depart
ments."
History Assoc. Prof. Mark
Mancall said he agreed that the
Hoover has "indeed
broadened its perspective and
we have to give it credit for that
— grudgingly, but still we do
have to give it credit." Both
Mancall and Duignan point to
the Institution appointments
of philosopher Sidney Hook,
who calls himself socialist, and
Lipset, a lifelong Democrat, as
examples of the Institution's
widening perspective.
During the past 20 years,
however, the Institu
tion's relation
ship to the rest of the Univer
sity has sometimes been
shrouded in controversy and
misunderstanding.
The initial disagreements
arose over Campbell's ap
pointment as director of the
Hoover. Many faculty mem
bers opposed his appointment
and felt the University should
not accede to what was essen

tially a unilateral decision by
Herbert Hoover himself.
As the former visiting fellow
said, the Institution used to be
"Hoover's private bastion and
fiefdom."
Since Hoover's death in
1964, the situation has changed
markedly. The president of the
University appoints an ad hoc
advisory committee to consult
with him whenever a senior fel
low is to be named. Campbell
said the president or the trus
tees could veto appointments
of senior fellows or senior re
search fellows. He could ap
peal to the trustees but, he
said, "no case like that has
come up."
The trustees have developed
new procedures for the selec
tion of future Institution direc
tors. In january 1971 the trus
tees approved a proposal that a
search committee would
nominate several persons for
the director's position. The
president of the University
would select one of those
nominees, who would then
have to be approved by the In
stitution's Board of Overseers,
the Board of Directors of the
Hoover Foundation and the
University Board of Trustees.
In this way, a one-sided deci
sion like Hoover's choice of
Campbell could be avoided.
Another form of the
Hoover-University liaison is
the joint appointment. Some
fellows at the Hoover have
joint appointments with other
departments in the University,
notably the departments of
political science, history,
economics and sociology.
Senior Research Fellow
George Marotta, for example,
offers an undergraduate semi
nar in U.S. foreign policy and
Senior Fellow Seymour Martin
Lipset teaches an under
graduate course in "political
sociology" once a year.
Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig said
the growing number of joint
appointments "reflects an in
creasing awareness of com
mon interests" shared by the
University and the Hoover.
On the other hand, Dallin,
the first person to receive such
a joint appointment, said the
program was not as helpful as it
is often made out to be. Who
ever in the administration
thought joint appointments
would bring the Hoover and
the faculty closer together
"was a bit naive," he said.
Some faculty members are
not happy, Dallin continued,
that the Hoover does not go

through the rigorous process
faculty search committees
must use. And, he said, "A
good many people at Hoover
use the label 'professor' but
technically they are not."
The former visiting fellow
said "I don't think the Hoover
Institution loomed large in the
discussion of faculty members
— many had their prejudices
and attitudes, but it was not a
subject for discussion."
But Mancall said bad feelings
between the Institution and
the rest of the University are
not systemic. "As in all colle
gial relationships," he said,
"individual personalities are
involved. People often disag
ree with its (the Hoover's) poli
tics, but differences are no
thing but personal ones."
The finances of the Hoover
are largely independent of the
University as a whole. John
Kates, associate director of
corporate relations for the
University, said his office
would "coordinate fundraising
with Hoover if companies ex
press an interest in the Institu

tion" but the two entities usu
ally operate separately.
At Hoover, no professional
fundraiser is employed.
Campbell is the prime fun
draiser.
"Most contributors, particu
larly people who are going to
give you significant sums of
money, want to talk to the di
rector of the Institution or to
the senior scholars who are
going to be involved in the pro
jects. Now, I'm not deprecat
ing good staff work,"
Campbell said, "but I think
you'll find that President
Lyman or the provost are per
sonally involved in every major
gift to Stanford.''
Major donors include the
Scaife family, who gave $49,500
in 1968-69. Richard Scaife, pub
lisher of the Tribune Review
Publishing Company, has been
a member of the Board of
Overseers for more than 10
years. The ). Howard Pew Trust
last year gave the Hoover
$500,000, according to
Campbell, $400,000 of that
going to the domestic studies

program, while $100,000 went
to the national fellows prog
ram.
Other major contributors
have included David Packard,
chairman of the board of the
Hewlett-Packard electronics
company and a member of the
Board of Overseers; Standard
Oil of California, whose presi
dent, John Grey, is also a
member ot the Board of Over
seers; Pacific Gas and Electric
Company; Getty Oil Com
pany; the Alcoa Foundation;
the Southern Pacific Founda
tion; the Food Machinery Cor
poration.
This complex institution
merits continued attention due
to its growing impact on public
policy formulation. Continued
growth of the Hoover promises
to make the opinions voiced
there ever more prominent
and influential.
