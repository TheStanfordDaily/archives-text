# The Hoover institution: the might of the right?
## The programs, the researchers, their beliefs and the connections with the University

/ /"T"he purpose of this Institution must be, by its
I research and publications, to de
monstrate the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx —
whether Communism, Socialism, economic
materialism, or atheism — thus to protect the Ameri
can way of life from such ideologies, their con
spiracies, and to reaffirm the validity of the American
system."
This statement was written by Herbert Hoover,
former president of the United States and founder of
the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace,
for a 1959 pamphlet prepared for University trustees.
The frank, unadorned language of the paragraph is
easily remembered; it may be the most widely known
declaration to emanate from the Institution.

Also, the seemingly large
sweep of the paragraph is ideal
for those who seek simplistic,
quickly digested, buzz-word
knowledge of the Hoover.
But the Hoover Institution is
no longer just a world-famous
library and archives and small
research staff concerned
mainly with Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union.
The Hoover's budget has in
creased from less than $400,000
in 1959-bO to $2.1 million in
1970-71 to an estimated $5.7
million for the current fiscal
year.
The funding for research has
increased from a 9 percent

share of the budget 20 years
ago to approximately a 40 per
cent share today. The number
of senior fellows and senior re
search fellows has more than
doubled since the early 70s,
when there were 18. This major
increase largely reflects the
addition in this decade of a
domestic studies program
which now receives roughly as
much support as the long
standing international studies
program does. And further, a
national fellows program, br
inging young scholars to the
Hoover for a year-long re
search period, was started in
1971 (see box this page).
The Institution archives, be
sides housing such items as of
ficial records of the Nazi Party
and files of the Czarist secret
police, expand at the rate of
approximately "100 new col
lections per year," according
to Deputy Archivist Charles
Palm.
The Hoover Library's fund
ing is now more than $4 mill
ion. In the current fiscal year,
anestimateds2.l million of that
will come from the Institution,
with the rest coming from Uni
versity general funds. More
than 1.3 million books, as well
as 24,000 magazines and 6000
newspaper titles are kept in the
library. Although it has de
clined as a percentage of the
total budget, the Hoover's
spending on its library has
more than doubled in the past
decade.
Forty-nine titles including
reprints will be published by
the Hoover Institution Press
this year, nearly tripling the
publishing totals from a de
cade ago.
In 1978, the Herbert Hoover
Memorial building was com
pleted, adding nearly 100 of
fices (see box page 6). As
sociate Director Darrel Trent,
who along with Senior Fellow
Rita Ricardo Campbell helped
oversee the building's con
struction, said "I think we have
the finest research facility in

the country. Perhaps in the
world."
In short, as Richard Staar, as
sociate director of the Hoover
observes, "the growth here
has been astonishing, to say
the least."
Although much more dif
ficult to measure pre
cisely, the Institu
tion s impact on public policy
formulation has increased.
Clearly, the addition of the
domestic studies program has
brought greater national atten
tion to the Hoover.
"Our work is more interest
ing now to the typical con

gressman, who didn't care
what went on in China, but
does care whether or not his
constituents can fly back and
forth across the country at low
rates," said Thomas Moore,
senior fellow at the Institution
and director of the domestic
studies program.
"I think domestic studies
may have attracted more atten
tion for that reason," he con
tinued. "International studies
was always policy-relevant, but
only to a group of people who
were focused on international
problems. All you have to do is
take a count of the number of
bureaucrats in Washington
concerned with international
problems and those con
cerned with domestic policy
and I'm sure the ration must be
one to 10."

A senior staff member of the
President's Council of
Economic Advisers from 1968-
1970, Moore thinks he has had
"a major impact in fostering a
movement toward deregula
tion in transportation, includ
ing airlines, trucking and rail
road deregulation." In fact,
displayed prominently in
Moore's office is a letter from
Sen. Edward Kennedy ID-
Mass.) thanking the senior fel
low for his work in airline de
regulation.
Milton Friedman, Nobel
Prize winner and Hoover
senior research fellow, writes a
Newsweek column, and his
widely disseminated views
have also influenced public
policy. Friedman, Alexander
Solzhenitsyn and Friedrich
Hayek are the three Nobel
Prize-winners associated with
the Hoover.
Editorials by members of the
Hoover staff appear regularly
in major newspapers, includ
ing the New York Times and
the Wall Street Journal.
Economist Rita Ricardo
Campbell, Hoover senior fel
low, believes she has had "a
considerable impact on pol
icy," citing her testimony for
the Senate Finance Committee
and her work in the health, so
cial security and drug sectors
as examples. Campbell, who
considers herself a feminist,
also played a major role in leg
ally defining working women's
pregnancies as temporary
work disabilities.
Senior Fellow Martin Ander
son, who served as a special
assistant to former President
Richard Nixon, is working as a
policy adviser in Ronald
Reagan's bid for the 1980 Re
publican presidential nomina
tion. He filled the same post in
the 1976 campaign.
Trent is considering offers
from Reagan and"from at least
two of the other (Republican)
candidates to be part of their
campaign staffs." Reagan is an
honorary fellow at the Hoover
(see box page 4).
"I welcome the fact that
serious candidates for the
highest oitice in the land con
side ur staff members to be
sufficiently qualified and with
sufficient good judgment to
want our staft member's ad
vice," said W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the In
stitution since 1959.

Campbell sees nothing
wrong with having an Institu
tion on "war, revolution and
peace" heavily involved in
domestic politics. "I don't
think there was ever any ques
tion in the founder's mind that
domestic studies was included
within the rubric of 'war, re
volution and peace.' In fact, if
you go back to the '30s you'll
find that we had a New Deal
collection at the Hoover In
stitution. In the meantime, for
financial reasons, and also be
cause of the interests of my
predecessors, who were prac
tically all history professors,
the domestic studies program
was slow in developing."
A full-fledged domestic

studies program began in the
early 70s. Campbell said that
the best time to have begun a
domestic program'would have
been prior to 1971, during the
so-called campus unrest, that
period in which many people
thought we faced revolution
domestically. You're talking to
a man who's very proud of the
fact that the Hoover Institution
was never occupied by protes
ters."
As the Hoover's impact on
policy increases, the be
liefs of people at the
Institution have become more
important.
"Many of the staff, at least on
the domestic side, are "liberal
in the 19th Century sense," ac

cording to Moore, who con
siders himself a libertarian.
"We tend to ask other ques
tions," he continued. "Brook
ings (Institution, in
Washington, D.C.) might ask
'How can we devise a new
program to help poor people?'
We might ask, 'Does that prog
ram indeed help poor people?'
If it doesn't, then even Brook
ings will have to stop and think,

'Well, maybe this isn't a prog
ram we should he pushing and
supporting.' For example, a
liberal institution like Brook
ings wouldn't ask whether or
not the minimum wage actually
worked."
Similarly, Senior Fellow and
Political Science and Sociology
Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset
said some people at the Institu
tion are trying to learn why
government regulation con
tinues even though
"economists will demonstrate
beyond a shadow of theoreti
cal doubt" that regulation
doesn't work. "Somebody is
something out of this"
or the government would not
continue to pass new regula

tions, he said.
Friedman said that the
Hoover's importance lies not
in its values, but in the quality
of its research. "Most differ
ences about policy reflect a dif
ference in scientific consequ
ences, not in values."
Like Moore, Friedman cited
the minimum wage as an
example: "Everyone wants to
employ and feed people; the
difference is that people disag
ree about ' : "e effect of an in
creased minimum wage."
Market economics Friedman
and Moore said that a higher
minimum wage in tact hurts
poor people because it re
duces the number of low
paying jobs businesses can of

fer, th increasing un
employr among the poor.
Friedn saici he thought
many Hot ; r employees be
lieve that government should
be limited and perform only a
few, well-defined functions.
Although Friedman added,
"This belief is by no means, of
course, uniform or universal at
Hoover," it is difficult to find
serious disagreement with this
basic notion at the Institution.
As Associate Director Trent
puts it,"I think when it comes
down to making a decision on
who can better spend your
money, yourself or the gov
ernment, I can tell you from
first-hand experience that you
probably can."
In a speech summarizing the
findings of the Hoover's up
coming United States in the
'80s, a volume of issues
analysis and prescription,
Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka
did little to weaken the conser
vative, free-market image of
the Institution. Rabushka, co
editor of the book, spoke re
cently at the Stanford Alumni
Association's "Issues of the
'80s'' forum.
Rabushka proclaimed that an
"era of limits" is coming. The
first signs are growing move
ments favoring decreased
taxes. California's famous
Proposition 13 was a "good
thing,"accordingto Rabushka,
and he welcomed the spread of
such initiatives throughout the
country.
"Deregulation and in
creased competition are better
than big government," said
Rabushka. The collection con-

As Associate Director Trent puts it, 'I think when it
comes down to making a decision on who can better
spend your money,yourself or the government, I can
tell you from first-hand experienceyou probably can.'
