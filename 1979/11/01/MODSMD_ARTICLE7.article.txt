Made up of more than
50 members,
Hoover's Board of
Overseers serves as an ad
visory board to the director
of the Institution, Glenn
Campbell.
Most of its members are
prominent in business or
politics. The board has
gained many renowned
people in the past 15 or 20
years, according to
Campbell.
But "it would take several
of our present-day mem
bers to even come close to
equalling the eminence of
the Founder of the Hoover
Institution," Campbell said.
Some of the more widely
known members of the
board include Anne
Armstrong, former ambas
sador to the Court of St.
lames; William Simon,
former secretary of the treas
ury under Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford; two members
of the Hoover family;
William Baroody, head of
the American Enterprises In

stitute, an East-Coast coun
terpart to Hoover; and Jack
Parker, vice chairman of the
board ot the General Electric
Company.
The board also numbers
among its members John
Swearingen, chairman of
the board of Standard Oil
Company of Indiana and
Dean Watkins, chairman of
the board of Watkins-
Johnson Company. Senior
Fellow Rita Ricardo
Campbell is on the board of
directors of Watkins
lohnson.
David Packard, chariman
of the board of the
Hewlett-Packard elec
tronics company, is an over
