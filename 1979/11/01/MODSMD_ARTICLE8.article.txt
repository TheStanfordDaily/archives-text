Perhaps the most obvious
feature of the
Hoover Institution is its
imposing tower, which can
be seen from almost every
place on campus.
But the tower is only one
part of a structure that took
close to 60 years to develop.
At its inception in 1919,
Hoover had nowhere to
keep all the materials being
sent from countries around
the world. According to
Deputy Archivist Charles
Palm, a special section was
set up in Main Library,

which housed the Institu
tion for 20 years.
Then in 1941, the tower
was completed and the In
stitution moved to its own
building.
A new structure, the Lou
Henry Hoover Building, was
dedicated in 1967. It now
houses the Asian languages
collection, the newspaper
collections, and some of the
offices of scholars and staff
of the Institution.
The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building is the
latest structural addition to
the Institution, next to the

tower and parallel to the
Lou Henry Hoover Building.
Dedicated in 1978, it is the
only memorial to former
president Herbert Hoover.
There are no other memo
rials to any former president
at other major U.S. univer
sities.
The Institution was
awarded a $7 million grant
from the federal govern
ment to help build the
memorial. The grant had to
be matched with equal
funding from the Institution
itself.
