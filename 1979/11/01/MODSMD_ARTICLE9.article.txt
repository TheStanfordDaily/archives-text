# Educational quality
## Where does the reform begin? 
### Monika Guttman 
Even before the story of Ab
raham Lincoln walking
miles in the snow to
borrow books to read by
candlelight, education in this
country had been surrounded
by an aura ot reverence. And
since the Supreme Court de
cided Brown v. Board of Educa
tion in 1954, a quality education
has been considered the ina
ttenable right of every citizen.
So when national statistics
show a decline in the average
reading level of the high school
graduate, and when scores on
various proticiency tests are
down drastically from ten years
ago, many people become
concerned.
Recently, major universities
such as Stanford have tried to
encourage stricter standards in
basic high school classes; two
years ago, Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Fred
Hargadon distributed a letter
to high schools nationwide cal
ling for more stringent English
requirements, and in 1977
UC-Berkeley did away with a
provision allowing journalism
classes to fulfill English re
quirements.
Lower achievement in public
schools has concerned many
parents, politicians and
educators. Their increasing
anxiety has focused on secon
dary schools. Teachers, state
bureaucracy, declining social
standards and even television
have all been blamed at one
point or another, yet the direct
cause has not been deter
mined, and attempts to deal
with the problem have been
sporadic and fragmented.
"Public education has been
on the frying pan for a long
time," commented one high
school principal interviewed.
"Everyone in pert of some
sort, and they all decry diffe
rent aspects ot the same situa
tion."
In California, considered a
trend-setter in many other parts
ot the nation, educational qual
ity is a topic of debate in both
academic and political circles.
Ideas for restructuring the pub
lic school system range from a
change in the required qualifi
cations tor teachers to a more
rigorous emphasis on basic
subjects such as reading, writ
ing and mathematics.
One of the most radical

plans being discussed is a
complete change of the cur
rent method of school financ
ing to a "voucher" system.
Students would be provided
with a stipend trom the state
(the amount would be estab
lished by adjusting the average
cost of a public school educa
tion in 1979 to current inflation
rates), and this voucher could
then be given to the school ot
the student's choice. This fi
nancial emphasis is due in part
to recent legal actions by the
California Supreme Court.
In 1976, the Court handed
down a decision in Serrano v.
Priest which stipulated that the
quality of a California school
child's education "must not
depend on the wealth of his
neighbors." The decision
made it illegal to have in
equalities in revenues available
to local school districts be
cause of differences in local
property values.
As a result, the debate sur
rounding what should be done
about the declining quality of
public school education took
on a new and immediate angle:
education in California's 1044
school districts would have to
be equalized. (The average
state has 20 to 30 school dis
tricts.)
The Serrano decision
changed the definition of a
"good education." Instead of
relying specifically on student
performance on standardized
tests and the number of Na
tional Merit scholars as indi
cators of the quality of educa
tion in a particular district, fac
tors such as class size, laborat
ory equipment, number of
field trips and the size of lib
raries and swimming pools be
came the criteria of what is a
"good school."
In short, "quality" became
directlv related to cost.
Perhaps the most debated
proposal yet is the "Family
Choice in Education"
initiate .signatures are being
collected to place it on the |une
1980 ballot. The initiative "sets
forth a different way for or
iginl financing and gov
rnu iucation for children
in grades kindergarten
through 12 than currently
exists," according to a descrip
tion by the non-partisan
California Coalition for Fair
School Finance.
Basically, the initiative would

change the method of paying
tor schools to a "voucher" sys
tem. Families would have the.
choice of sending their chil
dren to one of four different
kinds of schools: a public
school (public schools would
continue to be free), a private
school (which would continue
to charge tuition) or one of the
new publicly supported
schools: "independent pub
lic" or "family choice."
The California Coalition for
Fair School Finance defines the
two schools in the following
manner: "independent pub
lic" — separate nonprofit cor
porations established by pub
lic school districts, community
colleges or public universities
and run by a governing body of
staff, parents and trustees as
determined by the founding
institution; "family choice" —
separate nonprofit corpora
tions privately administered.
Existing private schools can
apply for either status.
A voucher, or "educational
certificate," would be pro
vided by the state to students
who wished to attend an "in
dependent public" or "family
choice" school. The two new
types of schools would be con
sidered non-profit, and relig
ion could be taught only in the
"family choice" schools. All
schools except private schools
would be regulated by the
Education Code tor curriculum
and personnel for private
••schools of 1979.
Since no limits are placed on
the tuition a school ma>
charge, the total cost of a par
ticular school may be over and
above the fixed amount of the

voucher. The individual
families would have to make
up this difference in price.
The "Family Choice in Edu
cation" voucher plan was de
veloped primarily by two Ber
keley Law School professors,
John Coons and Stephen
Sugarman. Coons said he felt
the initiative would change
education for the better.
"This system would create
opportunities for new forms of
education," he said. "There
would be greater flexibility,
more parental power to put to
gether different types of
schools that concentrate on
education in different ways.
For instance, some "indepen
dent public" or "family
choice" schools would be run
by the parents themselves,
others by a head-master and so
forth.
Yet reaction to the proposal
has been skeptical. Many ad
ministrators and others in
volved in the school system
feel the voucher system would
only further fragment public
education.
Michael Atkin, dean of the
Stanford School of Education,
said that although he knew tew
of the specifics of the prop
osed initiative, he felt such a
measure would further divide
existing social institutions.
"Schools are seen by some
historians as unifying," he
said. "There are already lots of
indications that society is
fragmenting into special in
terest groups — groups using
the government to further
"heir own ends."
Newman Walker, superin
ndent ot the Palo Alto school
district, spoke of administra
i e problems which could
possibly be brought about by
the initiative.
"The thing that concerns me
is the logistical feasibility of the
proposal," he said. "Since the
proposal allows students to
cross districts and choose
whatever type of school they
want, there would be large
numbers of students shifting
from one school to another.
"Certain problems, such as
the certification of staff, collec

tive bargaining, affirmative ac- |
fion and desegregation all con
strict the flexibility necessary
to adapt to such changes in en
rollment."
Doug Murray, principal of
Carlmont High School in Bel
mont, said he felt that the
economics of the proposal
could eventually become even
more disastrous than the pre
sent system.
"Taxpayers are probably
looking at easy short-term solu
tions to a long term disaster,"
said Murray. "There is no local
responsibility with vouchers.
"Private enterprise will have
tuitions that will go up and
phase out blue collar means.'
Those who can't afford the pri
vate tuition will get what's left
ot public education," he said.
But Coons said he feels that
too many students are forced
to go to public schools in the
existing system because pri
vate schools are so expensive.
"What other monopoly (be
sides public schools) has 80
percent of the market automat
ically because others cannot af
ford the tuition of private
schools, and yet legally atten
dance is compulsory?" he
asked. "No wonder they're
hanging on to the system they
have."
Some of the parents of
school age children that were
interviewed said they felt there
could be some merit in the
"Family Choice in Education"
initiative.
"It could possibly give
power to groups which tradi
tionally haven't had any," said
one parent.
"Vet traditionally that has
never happened," she added.
Many of those interviewed,
however, said they felt the
basic problem of declining
educational standards could
not be dealt with on a finan
cial level.
Robin Ohls, a freshman
here, said she felt that the
standards required of teachers
was a much more important
factor in terms of upgrading
accomplishment in the
schools.

The debate over how best to upgrade educational quality has focused on many factors, including the quality of
teachers and the size of laboratories and other facilities.
