# Fall ASSU referenda vote called 'worthless'
## 
### Fran Miller 
ASSU Senate election reform and
lighted tennis court referenda results
from the Oct. 16and 17election were
"basically worthless," said Elections
Commissioner Mike O'Reilly at the
first official ASSU Senate meeting of
the year Wednesday night.
Because no place existed on the
ballots for "no" votes or abstentions
on those two issues, the obtained re
sults were not precisely indicative of
student desire.
"The ultimate fault was with the
ballot," O'Reilly claimed. The com
puterized ballot sheets lacked
enough spaces to provide for nega
tive responses and abstentions on
every question, he explained.
"We didn't realize there was going
to be a problem until we got the bal
lots back," O'Reilly said.
Since fee assessment passage re
quires a turnout of at least 20 percent
of the student body and a majority
favorable vote, the specific "no" and
abstain choices were absolutely
necessary to those provisions. The
space priority therefore allotted to
the fee assessments precluded the
proper format for the other re
ferenda.
Solicit opinion
Moreover, the tennis courts ques
tion and the election reform mea
sures were simply used to solicit stu
dent opinion to guide future senate
action. Those results were, thus, in
tended for the benefit of the senate
alone and not to actually effect
change, O'Reilly remarked.
O'Reilly suggested finding a new
computer and a company capable of
producing a differently constructed
ballot before the next election.
It is essential that the ballots con
tinue to be automated and that the
use of a number-two pencil be more
strictly enforced, he concluded.
The senate then certified all the
election results with the understand
ing that the aforementioned re
ferenda results were inaccurate.
Appointments
Senate committee appointments
were made, and seven nominations
were accepted for a new senate
chairperson. Nominations will re
main open for two weeks while
former chairperson George Drysdale
temporarily runs the meetings.
Senators voted to place a proposal
concerning mandatory Senate atten
dance before the Rules Committee.
A senate districting proposal, au
thored by Senators Augusto Failde
and Eric Terzuolo was also delegated
to the Rules Committee. That prop
osal would make each senator re
sponsible for reporting senate news
to a certain campus region.
Sen. Val Runge's motion to limit
senate meetings to three hours (7-10
p.m.), with the provision that they
can be extended it necessary, also
passed.
