Lots of questions this week! Here, in no
particular order are some of them.
There is a bathroom with a shower in the
basement of Herrin (bio labs) which was av
ailable to men and women. This shower has
been shut off since last March due to "water
leakage." There is a shower in the fourth floor
men's room.
Can the basement bathroom be repaired or
can the fourth floor men's room be made
available to both sexes? ,
-Women do field research too.
The basement bathroom was in fact closed,
due to severe leakage, according to Val Mal
lin, Administrative Officer of the Biology de
partment. It wasn't in good shape, Mallin
said, so "we just cut it off, and it's no longer
in use." Because of the expenses involved,
there are no plans to repair it, he said.
An upstairs solution to the problem looks
unlikely as well. "We haven't reached the
stage of unisex facilities," Mallin said. In fact,
it hasn't even been brought up. If a question
were directed to the chairman of the depart
ment, which Mallin said would be the usual
procedure for such a request, it would have
to be decided by the entire department. In
the meantime, as Mallin suggests, there are
other shower facilities on campus for wo
men.
Dear Bug Me:
Are the dates on the date palms edible (no
poisonous sprays)? Can they be picked?
-Looking for a date
"We have never sprayed them," said Larry
Atwater, a grounds supervisor here. "But
they are not edible, he added. The majority of
the palms at the University are Canary Island
Date Palms. You would probably severely dis
like the taste if you tried to eat one.
Dear Bug Me:
About two weeks ago, walking near Frost
Amphitheater I saw a fox. Three other people
saw it also - there was no chance for mistake .
I would like to know, has anyone ever re
ported a fox on campus before? Where could
it have come from?
Thanks, NJ-GSB
Actually, foxes are not entirely uncommon
on campus, Atwater said. The University, be
sides other wildlife it harbors (pre-meds,
EE's, rad's, frats, etc.), is also the home of
foxes, skunks, racoons and even deer. They
wander down to the center of campus from
the hills, Atwater said, especially when

they're hungry. Many roam into Erost be
cause it is particularly woody.
Bug Me:
Having presented my inquiry to a number
of upperclassmen, I am baffled by their want
of curious initiative. I want to know what the
source anc' nature of the hot water is which
rises as steam from beneath Stanford's
streets.
-a freshman crusading against ignorance
Well, you've brought your crusade to the
right place. If there's anyone who knows
about ignorance, it's me.
Actually, the answer is fairly simple, ac
cording to Lois Breckenridge, a supervisor in
building maintenance. The steam seen rising
from manholes on cold mornings is created
when water accumulates around steam
pipes, and is heated up by them.
"It's a daily thing," Breckenridge said.
"There are about 25 miles of steam pipes in
the ground under us, serving much of the
heating, hot water and cooking needs on
campus.
"Another source of steam escape comes
from steam leaks, also a fairly regular occurr
ence," Breckenridge said.
When the Senior Class year markers run all
the way around the inner quad, asked a
friend, will they begin going around the outer
quad?
Not likely! Consider this: in the year 2000,
the graduating class' time capsule will be in
front of the Human Bio department. The
seniors in 2023 will have to split their capsule
in half, as their diamond is bisected by the
archway. Not until the year 2150 will the brass
markers reach around to the arches across
from Mem Chu.
The class of 2225 will bury their life
duplicator and buzzwarp transformers in
front of Richard Lyman the tenth's office. And
not until 2390, five centuries after the incep
tion of the university, will the plaques wind
their way to their point of origin. By then, the
big bomb will have trashed the greater Palo
Alto area, and students at Stanford-on-Mars
won't even know what the outer .quad is!
One final question to start off your Friday
morning:
Dear Bug Me:
Is it true that all Stanford men are asexuali

I won't speak for the others, but I'm not.
Enjoy the weekend!
