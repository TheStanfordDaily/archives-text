# Manzanita Park: here for a while
## 
### Diane Greening 
For ten years the tin boxes
known as the trailers have
stood behind the eating clubs
and across the street from Wil
bur Hall. Although Manzanita
Park may not be in the draw
much longer, it looks as
though the trailers will remain
a part of the campus for ten
more years.
Dean of Residential Educa
tion Norm Robinson said that
when the trailers opened in the
fall of 1969, they were intended
to be a quick, temporary (5-
year) solution to the housing
crunch facing the University at
that time. But Robinson said
the trailers will now continue
to serve as undergraduate
housing until the new dorm
complex is completed around
1983, atwhich timethey will be
used for housing single
graduate students. The trailers
will then have three occupants
each. After the trailers are re
moved, around 1989, the site
will continue to be used for
housing, he said.
To those that have never vis
ited Manzanita, it is not the
maze it appears to be. One
road makes a loop through the
entire park. The trailers are
grouped in clusters of four,
and each cluster is identified
by a single number. Each trailer
also has a letter W, X, Y or Z.
Robinson said he thinks that
the trailers are in good shape.
He admitted that some of the
trailers have been abused and
that the University will be
spending some money on
them. Improvements will in
clude hiring a professional to
look at the trailers individually
and check their foundations,
and repairing the outside ap
pearance of those trailers with
kicked-in sides.
The residents at Manzanita
appear to be less optimistic
about the condition of their
trailers. They point to the water
stains on the ceilings and men
tion that it has not really rained
yet.

One trailer was described as
a "disaster," and although the
students living there said they
had requested maintenance,
nothing had been done.
Tammy Ritchey, a housing
associate (RA) for the park,
said that maintenance tor sec
urity reasons was done first.
"The manager of facilities is
working hard to make the trail
ers livable," she said. "The
trailers are getting old, but
then so is Wilbur."
Despite the fact that trailer
13W burned down several
years ago, Robinson said he
feels there is no need for con
cern.
"If the trailers weren't safe,
we wouldn't have them," he
said. "The fire in 13W took a
long time to start. The students
thought that they had put it out
arid left the trailer. It was not
out, so the trailer burned
down. It could have been
saved." He suggested that
the fire department be called
even after a fire appears to be
out.

While many people maintain
that they would not want to live
in the trailers, there are a large
number who wouldn't live
anywhere else.
"There is a group of about
100 to 120 people every year
who put Manzanita as first
choice on their draw cards,"
said Robinson.
Most of the residents of
Manzanita are enthusiastic
about trailer living. Noel
Rosales, a sophomore who got
into the park in his unguaran
teed year, said he really likes it.
He said he enjoys his room
mates and saving about $200 on
food bills.
"I don't miss Mother Stern
one bit!" he said.
Although he thinks the trail
ers are a good experience, he
doesn't want to return because
"there are better places to live
on campus."
"I see my neighbors every
day,"he added. "If someone
feels isolated, it's their own
fault."
One transfer student ag

reed, saying that although
she's had to work harder to
meet people, the benefits of
having a living room and a
kitchen would make her re
turn.
Though most students say
they are happy with the trail
ers, one sophomore said she
felt they were disappointing
after a year in a freshman
dorm.
"They're not bad," she said,
"but I don't like living here as a
sophomore. They'd be fine for
a junior or senior who has a lot
of friends around campus.
Common complaints about
the trailers seem to be ants,
noise and toilet paper. "We
pay as much as the people in
the dorms," said one student,
"but we don't get toilet paper
or light bulbs." He said the
park office issues one roll,
which must be signed for, and
must last the year for two bath
rooms. He and his trailer
mates have been forced to
make raids on Toyon and Wil
bur.

who put Manzanita as first
choice on their draw cards,"
said Robinson.
Most of the residents of
Manzanita are enthusiastic
about trailer living. Noel
Rosales, a sophomore who got
into the park in his unguaran
teed year, said he really likes it.
He said he enjoys his room
mates and saving about $200 on
food bills.
"I don't miss Mother Stern
one bit!" he said.
Although he thinks the trail
ers are a good experience, he
doesn't want to return because
"there are better places to live
on campus."
"I see my neighbors every
day,"he added. "If someone
feels isolated, it's their own
fault."
One transfer student ag

reed, saying that although
she's had to work harder to
meet people, the benefits of
having a living room and a
kitchen would make her re
turn.
Though most students say
they are happy with the trail
ers, one sophomore said she
felt they were disappointing
after a year in a freshman
dorm.
"They're not bad," she said,
"but I don't like living here as a
sophomore. They'd be fine for
a junior or senior who has a lot
of friends around campus.
Common complaints about
the trailers seem to be ants,
noise and toilet paper. "We
pay as much as the people in
the dorms," said one student,
"but we don't get toilet paper
or light bulbs." He said the
park office issues one roll,
which must be signed for, and
must last the year for two bath
rooms. He and his trailer
mates have been forced to
make raids on Toyon and Wil
bur.
For ten years the tin boxes
known as the trailers have
stood behind the eating clubs
and across the street from Wil
bur Hall. Although Manzanita
Park may not be in the draw
much longer, it looks as
though the trailers will remain
a part of the campus for ten
more years.
Dean of Residential Educa
tion Norm Robinson said that
when the trailers opened in the
fall of 1969, they were intended
to be a quick, temporary (5-
year) solution to the housing
crunch facing the University at
that time. But Robinson said
the trailers will now continue
to serve as undergraduate
housing until the new dorm
complex is completed around
1983, atwhich timethey will be
used for housing single
graduate students. The trailers
will then have three occupants
each. After the trailers are re
moved, around 1989, the site
will continue to be used for
housing, he said.
To those that have never vis
ited Manzanita, it is not the
maze it appears to be. One
road makes a loop through the
entire park. The trailers are
grouped in clusters of four,
and each cluster is identified
by a single number. Each trailer
also has a letter W, X, Y or Z.
Robinson said he thinks that
the trailers are in good shape.
He admitted that some of the
trailers have been abused and
that the University will be
spending some money on
them. Improvements will in
clude hiring a professional to
look at the trailers individually
and check their foundations,
and repairing the outside ap
pearance of those trailers with
kicked-in sides.
The residents at Manzanita
appear to be less optimistic
about the condition of their
trailers. They point to the water
stains on the ceilings and men
tion that it has not really rained
yet.

One trailer was described as
a "disaster," and although the
students living there said they
had requested maintenance,
nothing had been done.
Tammy Ritchey, a housing
associate (RA) for the park,
said that maintenance tor sec
urity reasons was done first.
"The manager of facilities is
working hard to make the trail
ers livable," she said. "The
trailers are getting old, but
then so is Wilbur."
Despite the fact that trailer
13W burned down several
years ago, Robinson said he
feels there is no need for con
cern.
"If the trailers weren't safe,
we wouldn't have them," he
said. "The fire in 13W took a
long time to start. The students
thought that they had put it out
arid left the trailer. It was not
out, so the trailer burned
down. It could have been
saved." He suggested that
the fire department be called
even after a fire appears to be
out.

While many people maintain
that they would not want to live
in the trailers, there are a large
number who wouldn't live
anywhere else.
"There is a group of about
100 to 120 people every year
who put Manzanita as first
choice on their draw cards,"
said Robinson.
