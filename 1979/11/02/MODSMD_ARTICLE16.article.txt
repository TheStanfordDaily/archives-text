## Tours mis-guide prospective students 
### 
I am sure that you have
noticed groups of high school
students touring the campus
these past few weeks. I cer
tainly noticed one group more
than the rest — my bicycle
brakes in their usual condition
failed and it was quite a mess.
Needless to say, those high
schoolers are not considering
Stanford anymore. The big
question here is whether any
of these prospective students
should consider Stanford.
I never had the opportunity
to take one of the Stanford
mis-guided tours for prospec
tive students. No, I had two
siblings enrolled so they
showed me the realities of
Stanford — the trailers and
mid-terms.
I also found that the all-too
familiar line given to my pa
rents when they called for my
brother or sister — that they
were not home and "are study
ing in the library" — was true.
Since I had never experi

enced the Stanford mis-guided
tour for prospective students, I
decided to see just what it is
they tell those bright smiling
faces of visiting high schoolers
to lure them to the Farm.
Tour "A" is during the mid
terms and consists of a ride to
the top of Hoover Tower.
Upon viewing the campus and
the ant-like forms below, the
tour guide began her spiel,
"This is the Stanford campus
and those students down there
are all as happy as can be."
From a thousand feet up who
can tell if someone is happy or
not? So, I pulled out my
binoculars and gazed over in
the direction of Kresge. A large
crowd was emerging and
"happy" was not quite the
word I would use to describe
them. Perhaps hysterical. They
had just finished a Human
Biology mid-term.
When the guide saw my
binoculars she let out a scream
and lunged for them. "What

are you doing, if we wanted
you to see details, we would
have taken you on Tour B!"
The next week I took Tour
"B." This tour is conducted
when there are no mid-terms
or finals. We started in the
Quad and within five minutes
the whole group was huddled
in a protective circle. Class had
just gotten out and bicycles,
mopeds, motorcycles and wal
kers had spilled forth from
every possible crevice.
One visitor asked about the
number of bikes on campus.
She seemed concerned for her
life. The guide responded by
saying that "today is a special
bicycle day and usually
everyone walks."
Deception number one. "In
truth everyone rides a bike and
the average student can expect
5.6 accidents by the time of
graduation," I said. The guide
just glared at me and herded us
in the direction of CERAS
where the LOTS facilities are.

We came about two feet in
side the door and our guide
told us, "The terminals are
something like little TV's that
the students watch. Most stu
dents like it so much that they
stay here for days at a time."
I could not stand it anymore
and began to feel a bit queezy.
Ask anyone in Computer Sci
ence 105 or 106 and I think they
would come up with a different
explanation as to what is going
on.
I ran out of the building and
headed in the direction of
White Plaza.
Suddenly a bicyclist came ca
reening into me. I scraped my
self off the ground and con
soled myself witli the fact that
"today was a special bicycle
day and everyone would be
walking around campus to
morrow." Yes, everyone
seems happy here ... •

truth everyone rides a bike and
the average student can expect
5.6 accidents by the time of
graduation," I said. The guide
just glared at me and herded us
in the direction of CERAS
where the LOTS facilities are.

We came about two feet in
side the door and our guide
told us, "The terminals are
something like little TV's that
the students watch. Most stu
dents like it so much that they
stay here for days at a time."
I could not stand it anymore
and began to feel a bit queezy.
Ask anyone in Computer Sci
ence 105 or 106 and I think they
would come up with a different
explanation as to what is going
on.
I ran out of the building and
headed in the direction of
White Plaza.
Suddenly a bicyclist came ca
reening into me. I scraped my
self off the ground and con
soled myself witli the fact that
"today was a special bicycle
day and everyone would be
walking around campus to
morrow." Yes, everyone
seems happy here ... •
