Middle East
It seems that everyone can
get into the act of pouncing
upon Debra Leigh's "Egypt, Is
rael Working Toward Peace"
(Daily, October 12), but read
ing Muhammad Zwayyid's
learned reply (Daily, October
23) in regarding the realities of
today by stating that the
Egyptian-Israeli Agreement has
made the Middle East more
miserable than it has ever been
since the establishment of Is
rael in 1948 makes me wonder
if Zwayyid really believes what
he is talking about.
Granted, he knows more
about Arab-Egyptian soldiers
fighting other Arab soldiers,
but to accuse Israel of "literally
reducing Lebanon to rubble" is
so incredible as to doubt
Zwayyid's sincerity.
Surely he must know, as
everyone does, that the PLO,
frustrated by not being able to
hijack planes anymore, went
into the business of hijacking
countries — like the attempt at
overthrowing King Hussein's
government in lordan in 1970
and then by failing, succeeding
in doing so with Lebanon.
Who was fighting whom in

Lebanon for years?
Another small point,
Zwayyid must surely know that
historic Palestine consisted of
today's Jordan and Israel.
It so happens that in 1922 Bri
tain partitioned Palestine into
two entities; the biggest part
went to the Saudi Arabian Emir
Abdullah as payment for help
ing them defeat the Ottoman
Empirein the Province of Pales
tine and Syria; the other part
was still called Palestine until
1948 when Israel was created.
So Leigh's statement is cor
rect when she says that "four
fifths of Palestine already exists
as an Arab state, namely Jor
dan" and one-fifth exists as Is
rael today.
Is it not fair then to say that
Israel is Israel and not Pales
tine?
Anybody with some books
and maps of the Middle East
can see that historic Palestine
did not consist of pre-1967 Is
rael plus the West Bank and
Gaza (which incidentally were
captured and annexed by
Transjordan and Egypt respec
tively in 1948-49 from the allot
ted territory of the future Arab
State in the second half of
Palestine.)
Nobody denies that the fate

of the remaining Palestinians
(jordanians?) now living in the
West Bank and Gaza is one of
the vexing problems in the reg
ion and will have to and can be
solved by the people living in
this area, but not by threat
from the outside.

Why boycott?
It's time to blow the cover on
the Coffee House Boycott
movement. An aimless boycott
of a campus student center has
gone on long enough, and I
think the many mistruths circu
lated by the fired workers need
to be unmasked.
TDS did fire 36 employees
without notice this summer.
Many of us continue to deplore
the method of firing, but it is
the motives behind the dismis
sals that pertain to (and cur
rently fuel) the boycott issue.
Ask a boycotter what he is
specifically supporting. If a list
of what he is protesting spews
forth, then stop him and press
him again for his goals. A
boycott without direction is
senseless.
Instead of aims, you are
likely to hear accusations from
the former workers. That
"our" Coffee House was run
out of town. That the estab
lishment should be student
run. That workers were fired
for unionizing.
I simply don't understand
how it was ever "our" Coffee
House to begin with. The old
Coffee House was notorious
for its murky atmosphere and
largely non-student patronage.
Appeals to students to demand
back a campus hang-out are
ridiculous.
That students should run the
Coffee House is also a fine ral
lying cause, but what does it
have to do with the boycott?
(And what specifically does it
have to do with the many non
student former workers?)
A bid for the upcoming con
tract, not a boycott, is the cor
rect vehicle for such state
ments.
Finally, the allegations that
rights to unionize were viol
ated are outside campus juris
diction and in the hands of the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB). One purpose of an
outside arbitrator is to make
pickets andboypotfs unneces
sary. If they exist in support of
the union issue, they are im
proper.
I'm disappointed in a system
which allows an external labor

dispute to cripple our one po
tential student center. I'm
disgusted by a directionless
boycott that seeks to rally stu
dents behind mistruths.
Let's attend the Coffee
House in droves — and shape it
such that we can call it "ours."

Provocative
The men on this campus are
extremely provocative in their
manner of dress. During warm
weather it is shocking to a
middle-aged lady like me to
see bare-chested men flaunt
ing their bodies.
The students are young and
reckless but what excuse is
there for the faculty? Profes
sors close to retirement age
have joined in this display of
flesh by exposing their legs
with complete disregard for
the possible consequences.
Let this be a warning — we
women are only human and
our frustrations may lead to il
legal actions!
The next time a shapely man
parades past me in shorts and
tight T-shirt there's no telling
what may happen — and it will
be his own fault!
