# THE

## Marc Rosaaen Lessons taught in Vietnam 
### 
American opinion was divided into three parts
during the Vietnam War: liberals said do no
thing because it was none of our business; con
servatives said fight to win to protect an ally from
invasion; and the middle said give South Viet
nam enough help to enable it to defend itself.
The frustrations implicit in a no-win situation
gradually alienated everybody, and pushed the
middle into abandoning our ally.
Of the three options open, the United States
chose the worst.
By wasting 55,000 American lives, we man
aged to delay the Communist takeover of
Southeast Asia by maybe nine years. Had we
done nothing, the Communists might have won
by 1966. South Vietnam would still have suffered
its bloodbath, but Cambodia's might have been
milder.
Had we fought to win, North Vietnam would
now have no capacity to conquer its neighbors,
and the balance of South Asia would be rela
tively free.
Ky/Thieu democracy was no prize, but it was
preferable to death by relocation.
Americans gradually became unpersuaded by
the conservatives' warnings about the consequ
ences of leaving South Vietnam to its fate. The
domino theory was pooh-poohed by people
happy to pretend the conflict was a civil war.
If it was a civil war, why does Vietnam run Laos
and most of Cambodia? How many more coun
tries must fall before the domino theory is vindi
cated?
Thailand nervousely eyes the Vietnamese
troops across its border with Cambodia. And
predictions of a bloodbath were similarly dis
counted, with results that in proportion make
Hitler seem a man of limited vision.
Victory in Vietnam was too risky, the liberals
said. In particular, China and Russia might have
reacted to our moves to win. But our destruction
of the Cambodian sanctuaries, the mining of
Haiphong, and stepped-up bombing of the
North, when we finally got around to them,
evoked nothing more than verbal outrage.
Fear of such reaction turned out to be a slim

reason to pay enough tor World War II again.
Victory would have been cheaper, at a saving'
of tens of thousands of American and millions o
Southeast Asian lives.
But historically a more important consequ
ence will prove to be the sapping of our national
will, which has led to a foreign policy of retreat.
The United States no longer wants to resist
Soviet expansion militarily.
Instead, we threaten not to sell them comput
ers.
We were displeased by Cuban intervention in
Angola, but Congress voted not to aid the pro-
Western forces.
Russia, in its historic drive south to the Indian
Ocean, sends arms to prop up its puppet Af
ghanistan, but we don't aid the rebels. We
would rather Russia not foment revolution, but
we won't do anything to counterbalance these
efforts.
But Southern Africa looms as a stunning self
inflicted defeat for the West. We won't back
pro-Western, pro-democratic Rhodesian
"leader" Abel Muzorewa because he gives
guarantees to the whites, the people he needs
to run the country.
It's obvious that Rhodesians, black and white,
and the West will be worse off if the terrorists
win. But we put the wishes of the Nigerian oil
spigot ahead of the interests of the Rhodesians.
We probably won't lift a finger when Russia
turns the screws on South Africa. Apartheid is a
vile system, but to South Africa's credit are the
highest black standard of living and the freest
press on the continent, staunch anti-
Communism, and a passable democracy.
These benefits would be lost along with apar
theid it outside rebels win. There are, after all,
only two or three black democracies in Africa.
It's clearly to our and all South Africans' ad
vantage for South Africa to evolve internally
without a Russian-backed revolution.
But such realistic analysis is not typical of this
post-Vietnam era.
