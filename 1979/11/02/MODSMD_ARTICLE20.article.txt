## FDA a bureaucratic mess 
### 
Donald Kennedy's column
on the Food and Drug Ad
ministration (Daily, Oct. 25)
indicates that new drugs are
being used prior to FDA ap
proval. In this case, former
FDA Commissioner Kennedy
must have taken a "rose
colored glasses" drug. A per
son taking this drug perceives
that the federal government
functions exactly as described
by a seventh grade civics
teacher.
Kennedy argues that "regu
lation is a creation of the Con
gress and not of the executive
agencies." Precisely the oppo
site is true: Law is a creation of
Congress and regulation is a
creation of the executive agen
cies.
Kennedy contends that
Congress passes laws and the
FDA mechanistically adminis
ters these laws — certainly
there is no need for anyone at
the FDA to interpret those
often times cryptic words the
president signs into law.
The point is that the FDA
(and all of the other agencies)
is given enormous authority to
interpret, explain and some
times distort laws passed by
Congress. Moreover, Con
gressional reversal of an ad
ministrative regulation is ex
tremely rare.
A perfect example of this
problem is a law Kennedy men
tions, the 1962 Amendments to
the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act. One of the main provi
sions of these amendments re
quired that new drugs be
proven effective as well as safe.

Certainly a noble idea, but one
that has proven to be unwork
able and terribly expensive to
the American public.
The FDA has had problems
over the years defining safety
in operational terms; efficacy
is many times more difficult to
define.
Numerous FDA documents
have been written in an at
tempt to define effectiveness
in a useful, practical manner.
The FDA has taken the ill
fated — and certainly not Con
gressionally mandated — path
of incredibly stringent pre
market testing.
The result has been that the
time and expense of testing
new drug products have both
been multiplied by a factor of
at least 10 since 1962.
Important new drugs, such
as sodium valproate, and anti
epileptic drug which could
prevent as many as one million
seizures per year, have been
introduced in the United States
10 to 15 years later than their
European introduction, if at all.
One can easily argue that the
bulk of current food and drug
regulatory problems come di
rectly from the FDA. The fact
that Congress originally writes
the legislation certainly does
not relieve the agencies from
liability for mismanagement.
Kennedy makes one last in
correct point. He argues that
since the current laws are not
being repealed or dramatically
changed they must, therefore,
be generally accepted and
"good." There are two points

against this argument.
First, every major U.S. drug
law (the 1906 Pure Food and
Drug Act, the 1938 Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act and the 1962
Amendments) has been pre
ceeded by an emotional
tragedy. The 1962 Amend
ments, for example, were on
the verge of being abandoned
until the report of thalidomide
babies in Europe.
The fact that the 1962
Amendments added
effectiveness-testing and that
thalidomide presented safety
problems did not seem to con
cern the Congress — they sim
ply needed to pass a bill to
show that they were con
cerned. The point is that all of
the major legislation has had
less than rational support.
Second, it is much more dif
ficult to repeal legislation than
to pass legislation. This is par
ticularly true when the legisla
tion to be repealed has created
a powerful special interest
group such as the employees
of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
I have a great deal of respect
for Kennedy and he was cer
tainly an improvement over the
past two FDA Commissioners.
The fact remains, however,
that the FDA is one of the most
poorly run federal bureauc
racies in existence. Even Con
gress would not be foolish
enough to mandate the current
operation of the FDA.
