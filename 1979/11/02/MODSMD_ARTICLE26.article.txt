Boston (AP) — Caution:
drinking tea with lemon may
be hazardous to your health.
But only if you drink it from a
polystyrene cup, says a Con
necticut doctor.
The physician says it's the
cup, actually, that's the prob
lem. He claims lemon dissolves
it.
Ihe seriousness of his find
ings, however, was disputed
by the National Cancer Insti
tute, which said that dissolved
polystyrene is not dangerous.
In a letter in yesterday's New
England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Michael Phillips wrote:
"Since polystyrene is car
cinogenic in laboratory ani
mals, I suggest that the time is
now ripe to return to the tradi
tion of drinking lemon tea from
cups of fine bone china — a

practice with more aesthetic
appeal and less potential
hazard."
He decided to investigate
the dissolving cup problem
after he "noticed that the in
terior of the polystyrene cup
was dissolving before my eyes
and even perforating in places.
This obser/ation so thoroughly
destroyed my appetite that I
decided to pursue it in the
laboratory."
In his letter, Phillips cited a
1955 study that found polys
tyrene causes cancer in lab
animals.
But a spokesman for the Na
tional Cancer Institute in
Washington said a study re
leased in September found no
evidence that polystyrene
causes cancer in rats or mice.
