# Bedeviled Sun Devils confront rollercoaster Stanford
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Those Stanford fans who were cancel
ling plane reservations to Pasadena and
tearing up season tickets after last week's
nauseating loss to Oregon State should
consider themselves lucky.
They could be Arizona State fans.
While it is true that the Sun Devils are
very much in the thick of the Rose Bowl
race and riding a five-game winning streak
into Stanford Stadium tomorrow, the fact
is that the hardy souls who still follow ASU
football have suffered more indignities
than a Gay Liberation Front member at a
John Birch meeting.
First there is the still-unsettled Frank
Kush fiasco, in which the 22-year veteran
head coach of ASU football was fired for
supposedly asking players and coaches to
cover up events surrounding his alleged
striking of former Sun Devil punter Kevin
Rutledge.
Rutledge is suing Kush and the school
for $1.1 million, charging that Kush
punched him in the face following a poor
punt in the 1978 ASU-Washington game.
Amid all the mud being slung back and
forth in the Kush case, last week the NCAA
ordered an investigation into possible im
proprieties concerning the school's pro
ceeds from ticket sales.
On top of that, the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Council met yesterday concerning
eight Sun Devil players who may be
academically ineligible because they at
tended an extension course at a small
California college last summer.
If the players are ineligible, the Sun De
vils might have to forfeit their three con
ference wins this year. That depends on
the whims of the Council.
Mental toughness
In the midst of this madness are a group
of collegians and coaches who only want
to concentrate on football. That they have
won three games since the trouble started
is a tribute to the mental toughness of
everyone involved in the ASU program.
No one is more aware of that than Stanford

head coach Rod Dowhower.
Arizona State is a fine team. They've
come a long way since the beginning of
the year. They have done well under ad
verse conditions," Dowhower said.
Down in Tempe, no one will even say
that much concerning their problems. In
terim head coach Bob Owens has refused
to talk to reporters, and those that do talk
haven't much to say.
No comment, I'm not involved in
that," offensive coordinator Don Baker
said. "Whatever happens, happens. The
kids (players) are dedicated to a great year
to show people. They just want to forget it
and play football."
The Sun Devils have been playing good
football lately, something they were not
doing at the beginning of the year. They
lost their first two games this season, 17-9
to California and 31-3 to sixth-ranked
Florida State, but have bounced back to
shut out Toledo and Oregon State and
beat Washington, Washington State and
Utah State, averaging 32 points over those
five victories.
Malone: offensive key
ASU's pro-set offense is as potent and
quarterback-oriented as Stanford's.
Senior Mark Malone is the Sun Devil quar
terback and is the key to their offense.
The 6-foot-4, 220-pounder is this week's
Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week after a
sterling performance against Utah State,
gaining 133 yards on the ground, including
a 98-yarder for a touchdown.
Malone ranks third in total offense and
is the tenth leading rusher in the confer
ence, an unusual statistic for a quarter
back.
"Malone is an outstanding runner,"
Dowhower said. "We definitely have to
stop him to stop their offense."
The job of stopping Malone — and the
other 10 men of the Arizona State offense
— lies with the Stanford defense that gave
up 33 points and bunches of time to the
supposedly meager Oregon State offense.
The Cardinal linebacking corps was so

riddled with injury last week that offensive
guard Charles Bedford played briefly at
outside linebacker. This week, they are
healthier.
Dave Morze returns to the starting
linebacking squad after the flu prevented
him from travelling to Corvallis. Vinee Wil
liams is at full-strength after being slowed
down since the USC game with a pinched
nerve.
Linebacker Milt McColl is sidelined
again with neck problems and cornerback
Rick Parker remains out with a bad shoul
der. On the offensive side, fullback Jim
Brown is still hurting from a calf injury, so
freshman Greg Hooper will start for the
third straight week.
"There's no doubt we miss Brown,"
Dowhower said, "but I like the way Greg
has stepped in. He has made some good
receptions."
Schonert in command
Most of those receptions were courtesy
of the Pac-10's leading passer and the na
tion's number two passer — Turk
Schonert. The senior has completed 85
percent (34-40) of his passes over the last
two games, and has thrown 71 consecutive
passes without an interception.
"I'm very happy for Turk," split end
Andre Tyler said. "The confidence he has
gained in himself has made all the differ
ence in the world."
Some of that confidence no doubt was
obtained from the emergence of Tyler in
his own right. The junior leads the team in
receptions with 32, taking advantage of the
double- and triple-teaming of teammate
flanker Ken Margerum.
"Andre has come a long way in seven
games," Dowhower said. "He has pro
vided balance to our offense. He is a real
complement to Ken Margerum and one of
the best in the Pac-10."
Arizona State's defensive secondary
the group that Tyler and Margerum will go
up against — is riddled with injury after
strong safety Mike Maloney broke an arm
last week.

terim head coach Bob Owens has refused
to talk to reporters, and those that do talk
haven't much to say.
No comment, I'm not involved in
that," offensive coordinator Don Baker
said. "Whatever happens, happens. The
kids (players) are dedicated to a great year
to show people. They just want to forget it
and play football."
The Sun Devils have been playing good
football lately, something they were not
doing at the beginning of the year. They
lost their first two games this season, 17-9
to California and 31-3 to sixth-ranked
Florida State, but have bounced back to
shut out Toledo and Oregon State and
beat Washington, Washington State and
Utah State, averaging 32 points over those
five victories.
Malone: offensive key
ASU's pro-set offense is as potent and
quarterback-oriented as Stanford's.
Senior Mark Malone is the Sun Devil quar
terback and is the key to their offense.
The 6-foot-4, 220-pounder is this week's
Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week after a
sterling performance against Utah State,
gaining 133 yards on the ground, including
a 98-yarder for a touchdown.
Malone ranks third in total offense and
is the tenth leading rusher in the confer
ence, an unusual statistic for a quarter
back.
"Malone is an outstanding runner,"
Dowhower said. "We definitely have to
stop him to stop their offense."
The job of stopping Malone — and the
other 10 men of the Arizona State offense
— lies with the Stanford defense that gave
up 33 points and bunches of time to the
supposedly meager Oregon State offense.
The Cardinal linebacking corps was so

riddled with injury last week that offensive
guard Charles Bedford played briefly at
outside linebacker. This week, they are
healthier.
Dave Morze returns to the starting
linebacking squad after the flu prevented
him from travelling to Corvallis. Vinee Wil
liams is at full-strength after being slowed
down since the USC game with a pinched
nerve.
Linebacker Milt McColl is sidelined
again with neck problems and cornerback
Rick Parker remains out with a bad shoul
der. On the offensive side, fullback Jim
Brown is still hurting from a calf injury, so
freshman Greg Hooper will start for the
third straight week.
"There's no doubt we miss Brown,"
Dowhower said, "but I like the way Greg
has stepped in. He has made some good
receptions."
Schonert in command
Most of those receptions were courtesy
of the Pac-10's leading passer and the na
tion's number two passer — Turk
Schonert. The senior has completed 85
percent (34-40) of his passes over the last
two games, and has thrown 71 consecutive
passes without an interception.
"I'm very happy for Turk," split end
Andre Tyler said. "The confidence he has
gained in himself has made all the differ
ence in the world."
Some of that confidence no doubt was
obtained from the emergence of Tyler in
his own right. The junior leads the team in
receptions with 32, taking advantage of the
double- and triple-teaming of teammate
flanker Ken Margerum.
"Andre has come a long way in seven
games," Dowhower said. "He has pro
vided balance to our offense. He is a real
complement to Ken Margerum and one of
the best in the Pac-10."
Arizona State's defensive secondary
the group that Tyler and Margerum will go
up against — is riddled with injury after
strong safety Mike Maloney broke an arm
last week.

has benefited nicely from the double and sometimes triple-coverage that Ken Margerum receives/leads
the Cards with 32 catches.
Those Stanford fans who were cancel
ling plane reservations to Pasadena and
tearing up season tickets after last week's
nauseating loss to Oregon State should
consider themselves lucky.
They could be Arizona State fans.
While it is true that the Sun Devils are
very much in the thick of the Rose Bowl
race and riding a five-game winning streak
into Stanford Stadium tomorrow, the fact
is that the hardy souls who still follow ASU
football have suffered more indignities
than a Gay Liberation Front member at a
John Birch meeting.
First there is the still-unsettled Frank
Kush fiasco, in which the 22-year veteran
head coach of ASU football was fired for
supposedly asking players and coaches to
cover up events surrounding his alleged
striking of former Sun Devil punter Kevin
Rutledge.
Rutledge is suing Kush and the school
for $1.1 million, charging that Kush
punched him in the face following a poor
punt in the 1978 ASU-Washington game.
Amid all the mud being slung back and
forth in the Kush case, last week the NCAA
ordered an investigation into possible im
proprieties concerning the school's pro
ceeds from ticket sales.
On top of that, the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Council met yesterday concerning
eight Sun Devil players who may be
academically ineligible because they at
tended an extension course at a small
California college last summer.
If the players are ineligible, the Sun De
vils might have to forfeit their three con
ference wins this year. That depends on
the whims of the Council.
Mental toughness
In the midst of this madness are a group
of collegians and coaches who only want
to concentrate on football. That they have
won three games since the trouble started
is a tribute to the mental toughness of
everyone involved in the ASU program.
No one is more aware of that than Stanford

head coach Rod Dowhower.
Arizona State is a fine team. They've
come a long way since the beginning of
the year. They have done well under ad
verse conditions," Dowhower said.
