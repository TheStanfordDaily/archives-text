### Brad Brockbank 
Stanford water polo
coach Dante Dettamanti is
very pragmatic about the
importance of today's 3
p.m. game with California at
Berkeley's Harmon Pool.
"We've backed ourselves
into a corner, and now
we've got to fight our way
out."
The Cardinals are cur
rently tied with USC for
second place in the Pacific
-10 with two conference
games left to play — both
with the first-place Bears. In
order to be considered for a
berth at the NCAA champ
ionships later this month,
Stanford must win at least
one of those two games.
The perennial rivals will
clash again at deGuerre on
Nov. 17.
"This is the single most
important game this sea
son," Dettamanti said.
"What we don't want is to
come back here (Nov. 17) in
a must-win situation. We

want to beat them over
there."
Beating Cal "over there"
is something the Cardinals
have managed only once in
the past ten years. Although
Dettamanti expressed con
fidence that his team could
reverse that trend today, he
emphasized that his team
will have to adjust quickly to
Cal's shorter, 25-yard pool
to do it.
"To come back in that
pool is very tough," De
ttamanti said. "It's always
taken us a quarter to adjust
to the pool. We've got to
make a quick adjustment
(this time) and really play
tough defense in the first
quarter."
On offense, the Cards will
have to play a solid front
court offense. The effec
tiveness of the counter
attack, Stanford's most
powerful offensive weapon,
will be limited by the size of
the pool.
More emohasis on front

court offense means more
driving; and more driving
means more ejections,
something Dettamanti said
"will probably decide the
game." In addition, the
smaller pool will mean more
shots, and consequently, a
higher scoring game. And
with goals coming fast and
furious, the little mistakes
can mean a lot.
According to sophomore
Chris Kelsey, the team that
makes the fewest of those
little mistakes will probably
win. He added that the
Pac-10 teams are very even
this year, and that on any
given day, one team could
beat another.
But according to junior
John Gansel, today's game
could be decided on the
basis of one thing: Pride.
"We're going to have to
have pride," the nation's
top goalie said. "To win,
we're going to have to want
it more."
