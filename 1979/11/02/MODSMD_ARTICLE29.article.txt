## Cards overtake Stanislaus in prep for soccer's 'Big Game' vs. Bears 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's soccer team finds
itself in an unaccustomed posi
tion — tied for first place in the
Pacific Soccer Conference with
just two league games remain
ing.
Although the program has
grown dramatically in the past
three years, November usually
found the Cardinals in fourth
place behind traditional PSC
(and regional, even national)
powers University of San Fran
cisco, San Jose State and Santa
Clara University.
This year, however, the
Cards have ignored tradition
by upsetting both the Spartans
and the Broncos, earning Stan
ford a 4-1 league record, iden
tical to that of defending NCAA
champion USF. The key to a
top finish in the PSC and post
season competition is the con
test with the West's top-rated
Dons in San Francisco Tuesday
at 2 p.m.
Before that crucial meeting
with USF, Stanford has serious
business at hand, namely the
Golden Bears from California,
to whom Stanford plays host
Sunday at 1 p.m. on Harry
Maloney Field.
At this point in the season,
the Cards can't afford to look
past anybody, as they almost
did yesterday against Stanis
laus State.
The "state school syn
drome," as head coach Nelson
Lodge described it, came back
to haunt Stanford. Playing
down to their opponent the
Cards experienced a dose of
deja vu — going for a repeat of
the performance perfected
against Hayward State, San
Francisco State and Fresno
State. Fortunately, the spell
wore off.
After spotting the Warriors a
2-0 lead with 20 minutes left in
the game, Stanford came back
from the dead, doing the trick
with four goals and treating it
self to a 13-3-2 overall record.

Senior Jon Hecht got things
started for the Card comeback
by scoring off a corner kick
play. Doug Clark used his
height to best advantage by
heading a high corner kick past
the Stanislaus goalie. Dan
McNevin assisted Willie
Cuicci for the go-ahead tally
and Ted Rafalovich confused
the Warrior defense, causing
Stanislaus to score a goal
against itself.
"We sat back and suddenly
realized (we were going to
lose)," explained Lodge.
"Stanislaus was really respect
able. They had nothing to lose.
It was a helpless feeling for
me."
A day after All Hallows Eve,
Lodge called the late-game
rally "magic, — you just don't
see that happen," referring to
Stanford's four goals in 20 mi
nutes.
"I saw the difference as soon
as jon scored," Lodge said. "I
saw the spark."
Stanford's magic failed to
appreciably influence the reg
ional team rankings — the
Cards only moved from 10th to
eighth in the West despite up
setting Santa Clara 1-0 last
Sunday. In the latest polls, the
Broncos rated 14th in the na
tion and claimed second in the
West.
USF retained its first place
standing in the Western rank
ings and San lose State, also
upset by Stanford, was third.
