# On-campus meetings for sororities okayed
## SC president tells chapter leaders 
### Julie Kaufmann 
Presidents of the six local
sororities were told by Inter-Sorority
Council President Nancy Hoffman
earlier this week that they have been
granted permission to hold meetings
on campus.
Some sorority members are seeing
this as a move towards the University
eventually recognizing the sororities
as official University organizations, a
status they have sought since last
spring.
Hoffman said she was told by Pat
ricia Brandt, student activities ad
viser, and Norman Robinson, as
sociate dean for residential educa
tion, that the groups could hold
meetings on campus.
Official University confirmation
was not available last night.
Until now, the sororities have
been meeting off campus. The ex
pense and inconvenience of main
taining off-campus meeting places,
the risks of women traveling off
campus at night and the growing size

of the chapters have all created prob
lems for the groups, said Pam Hutch
craft, Kappa Alpha Theta president.
Costly
Hoffman explained that meeting
off campus in apartments or hotel
meeting rooms has been quite
costly.
"It's nice to be able to meet on
campus and use University rooms,"
she said.
Hutchcratt said she hopes the Uni
versity action is a move towards rec
ognition, but Hoffman said the move
did not necessarily indicate a swing
in that direction.
"It seemed as if the University was
just saying, 'Well, because of the in
convenience, you can meet here on
campus,'" she said. "It's not neces
sarily a move toward recognition."
Meanwhile, the proposals for rec
ognition must still be approved by
several University departments, in
cluding residential education. If rec
ognized, the chapters could apply
for on-campus housing facilities, al
though none of the sororities are
contemplating that move now, said
Hutchcraft.
No desire
The University is aware that the
groups are not desirous of housing
now, but they are asking us that for
20 years down the line," she said.
Points of contention delaying the
recognition decision concern na
tional sorority policies and rules in
cluding residence restrictions that
prohibit alcohol in members' rooms
and confine men to the first floor of
the house. These regulations, which
vary slightly among the different
sororities, conflict with University
housing policy, sorority members
explained.
The rules
Hutchcraft said she doesn't think
