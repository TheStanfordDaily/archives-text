Stanford's women's vol
leyball team travels to UCLA
today to participate in a tour
nament dubbed "crucial" by
head coach Fred Sturm.
"We're trying to qualify for
the regionals, and playing well
in this tournament is very sig
nificant," Sturm said. The
competition includes 24 of the
country's top teams, so the
caliberof play will beexcellent.
The real significance of the
tournament is that the Reg
ional Selection Committee will
be evaluating the teams lor the
six "at large" positions that will
compete in the Regional
championships. There are two
or three guaranteed spots for
league champions.
This committee judges by a
specific set of criteria. Sturm
described the three major fac
tors: conference standing,
how the team fares with other
teams in the conference and
the team's competitive
schedule. The committee
examines quality in relation to

the overall win-loss record.
In the tourney, Stanford will
compete in a "strong pool" of
six teams: Arizona State,
Florida State, USC, UC-Sanfi
Barbara and Hawaii. Thn
these teams are nationally
ranked, with Hawaii first I C
eighth, and UC-Santa Barbara
10th.
According to Sturm, Stan
ford is capable of finishing first
or second in this pool, pro
vided the Cardinals sustain ex
cellent play and avoid careless
mental blunders. Sturm calls
Stanford a "regional caliber
team with superior potential."
The schedule for Saturday's
tournament features each
team competing against the
others in its pool, with the two
top teams from each pool
going on to the quarterfinals at
3:45 p.m.
The semifinals take place at
6:30, the consolation match is
at 7:45 and the final match is at
8:30. The remaining eight
teams play in a single
elimination tournament.
