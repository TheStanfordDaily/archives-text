The remainder of the season
hinges on one crucial meet for
the Stanford women's cross
country team as it competes
in the AIAW Region Eight
Championships at Sierra Col
lege in Rocklin tomorrow.
The race, hosted by Sac
ramento State, will feature
teams from Arizona, Califor
nia, Hawaii and Nevada. The
top three teams will go on to
compete in the AIAW National
Championships at Florida
State, along with the first 15 in
dividual runners.
Stanford, racing in Division
I, is hoping to continue the
Reason as a team but is
nevertheless expec ted to place
some individuals in the qualify
ing spots.
Head coach laurel Treon in
dicates that the team has sha
ken off much of the inexperi
ence present in earlier meets
and has progressed right on
Schedule. "Team awareness
and unity has grown and is bet
ter than it's ever been. The
Stantord team is intact men
tally and physically," she said.
The Cardinals will be rep

resented by nine runners, of
which seven will actually score.
Expected to lead the scoring
contingent is freshman Kim
Schnurpfeil, who in her first
season has set the record at the
Stanford course twice — the
second time beating her own
mark by 9.1 seconds. All-
America senior Ann Thrupp
and junior Ann Wotherspoon
also figure to play major roles
in the Cards' showing.
Other Cards who could
score in the race are junior An
nette Mungai, sophs Susan
Bragdon and Beth Harrison,
and freshman )aneal Cabbage,
lunior Joanne Ernst and
sophomore Carolyn Layzerwill
also take part in the meet.
Treon points to Arizona, Cal
Poly-SLO, California, UCLA
and her own team as the main
contenders in this champion
ship. While Stanford might get
a shot at an at-large berth in the
nationals, their only sure bet
lies in a solid performance to
morrow. Acknowledging the
significance of the meet, Treon
said, "As a team, this is our last
shot if we want to go on."
