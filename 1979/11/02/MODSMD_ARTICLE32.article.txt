# This week's Guest Greeks give peek from radio seat
## 
### 
It is indeed true that history
repeats itself. When Ivan
Maisel picked USC to beat
California last week 24-14, it
marked the second time that a
Daily sports editor forecasted
the exact score for a game.
Must be Ivan's Alabaman intui
tion.
To honor this occasion, the
Daily again decided to bestow
the Guest Creek of the Week
laurels upon a radio an
nouncer, since KSFO's Don
Klein distinguished himself by
picking six out of seven win
ners two weeks ago.
In fact, the Daily liked this idea
so much that it collared two
masters of the microphone as
this week's Guest Greeks:
KZSU Sports Directors Rick Os

tiller and Rasha Drachkovitch.
The joint predictions of Ostil
ler, a graduate of Vin Scully
High School in Chavez Ravine,
Calif, and Drachkovitch, who
hails from the Curt Gowdy
Preparatory School located
near Three Rivers Stadium, fol
low:
Washington State at Ore
gon State - Despite last week's
outbreak of BEAVER FEVER,
this is still the Pac-10 Garbage
Bowl. Give the nod to the
Cougars in a game where the
coin flip may provide the
biggest excitement.
LJSC at Arizona-The Trojan
defense is susceptible to the
forward pass, but Arizona's of
fense is allergic to it. The one
thing U of A won't catch will be
Charles White, as he and his

teammates romp to an easy
win.
Washington at (California —
This game shows why the
Pac-10 is like a forest.
Washington is in the thick of
the Rose Bowl hunt and Hus
kies are great animals under
these conditions. Meanwhile,
we all know what Bears do in
the woods, so look for Cal to
drop another one. Poor
Weenies!
Arizona Stale at Stan ford -
Frank Kush has no class
though his Sun Devils can
run and pass.
The Cards will come out a
frenzied mass,
and on national TV they'll
kick their knee.
