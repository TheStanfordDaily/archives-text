# AN OPEN LETTER TO THE STUDENT BODY RE: BLOCK SEATING AT FOOTBALL GAMES
## 
### 
Several members of the student community have brought to our attention their
concern and unhappiness over the practice of large groups, mostly residential
groups, reserving blocks of seats in the Stanford student rooter section at home
football games. The student rooter section is unreserved and available to all stu
dents who purchase tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.
Therefore, blocks that are reserved by a few students for their friends who are
arriving at the Stadium at a later time have no priority standing in the student section.
This practice of "holding" empty seats in advance really isn't fair, and it has proven
troublesome to large numbers of students. Several students have reported that they
have been hassled and threated with physical harm if they did not move from a
"reserved block."
We are asking the cooperation of all students in discontinuing such practices at the
Stadium. There will be student monitors working at the Arizona State game to
prevent unpleasant situations from occurring.
If there is a desire on the part of student organizations for a formalized block seating
program, we would be most interested in receiving suggestions and meeting with
representatives of the various groups to try to develop a plan that is fair to all
students.
We thank you for your understanding and cooperation in making Stanford football
games an enjoyable experience for everyone.
