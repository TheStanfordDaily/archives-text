## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
The Stanford field hockey
team clearly demonstrated its
strength Wednesday with a 4-1
victory over NorCal confer

ence toe Sacramento State.
This final home game of the
season gives the scotchers a 4-1
conference record and places
them second in the league be
hind San lose State.
Though the Cardinals and
Sacramento State won almost
equal numbers of corners —13
and 14, respectively — Stan
ford took 33 shots to Sac
ramento State's 12 and amas
sed a total of ten-and-one-half
minutes penetration time in
contrast to Sacramento's six
minutes of penalty area domi
nation.
Goal Scorers were Kelly Wes
terwick (two), Na't y > ,iitc
and Becky Howell. Wester
wick's shots were push-passes
past lcramento's goalie, both
assisted by White. "Whitey's"
shot came early in the game,
taken off a corner play made by
Becky Howell and Claudia
Gold. Stanford's final point
came from link Becky Howell
on a hard drive after several
tense moments of penalty box
play.
The three-goal margin over
Sacramento State does not
satisfactorily reflect the
scotchers on-field command
Position interchanges and
numerous long passes sparked
the effective, fast-flowing of
fense Stanford maintained.
Forwards Westerwick and Lynn
Keyser combined with link
White to generate some par

ticularly impressive defense
offense changes and goal at
tacks.
The Cards' defense had to
contend with Sacramento
State's long drives and fre
quent flicks (air balls), against
which they used a "two
dribble-drive" technique.
Fullback Jeanine Valadez and
Nancy Jo Geenen showed spe
cial endurance here, fre
quently coming through to
generate the attack. Valadez
also actually stopped two
drives on goal with her stick.
The game took its toll, how
ever, as starting halfback lnlia
Johnson was injured early in
the first half with a broken
ankle. She will he out for the
duration of the season, head
coach Barbara Longstreth said,
whi< h will be a real loss >r the
team.
Turning to a more < unistic
subject, Longstreth spuke
bout the upcoming mate he
Hi'i <-s next weekend,

ose are the crucial ones — the
Region 112 ight games. Those are
the ones wr iave to win," she
cont u« d. Princeton (site of

ships) is our dream. So I look at
next weekend as getting us in
shape for the Regionals, get
