# 'My leadership comes from my play'
## The 						Friday Interview: Evans 
### 
Controlled ferocity is Chuck Evans' game. The outstanding de
fensive tackle and co-captain of Stanford's football team hits
hard, often and intelligently, as he is tied for the lead in tackles
with 81. A fifth-year senior, Evans stopped hitting long enough to
talk with Sally Jenkins, the Daily's Friday interviewer.
Jenkins: What would you say the main problem was against Ore
gon State last week?
Evans: Well, we let them drive on us and score right before the
half, and that gave them the momentum. It was a total shift. And
then they came right out and scored in the third quarterand really
got pumped up. We just couldn't hold them.
Jenkins: What did you talk about at halftimei Do you think any
body was feeling cocky?
Evans: No, not at all. We were very concerned. We knew that the
first series of the second half was going to be the key, and then
they came right out and scored on us.
Jenkins: As one of the veteran players, do you feel that you are one
of the team leaders?
Evans: Yeah, I do. I am one of the oldest on the team. But a lot of
my leadership comes from my play, I think. I'm not a rah-rah type.
But if guys see that I'm really making an effort, then maybe it
pumps them up too.
Jenkins: What does that include for you? Do you feel that you have
any obligations by being a leader?
Evans: I don't feel any extra burden at all. I like it. It's just that I've
been here awhile. It's by the way you play, if you work hard.
I here are times maybe when someone needs to have a little talk,
and me or Turk (Schonert) will sit down with them. I like to feel
that way.
Jenkins: How much communication is there between the offense
and defense?
Evans: Yeah, yeah, there definitely is a lot. We are a really close
knit group. It's good — a lot of fun. E ?rybody's good friends, you
know. I have a lot of good friends on the offense. Turk and I are
close, Andre Tyler, (Andre) Hines . . . there's a lot of communica
tion on the field, too.
Jenkins: How do you prepare for a game> Do you have a special
routine on game day<
Evans: Well, we meet at Rickey's Hyatt House and have breakfast.
Then I look over the scouting report again. But there's not a

whole lot I can get out of it by that time. I like to set goals for
myself, think of plays that I would like to make. Not that I can go
out and do it, but I like to think of the best game I could play.
Jenkins: Any thoughts of pro football?
Evans: Sure. There are lots of pro scouts around here. I would
love to play, but I don't really know at this point. It's going to
depend on how I play these last three games. But I'm not count
ing on it. If I can't play on a pro level I have other outlets. I have
two or three solid job prospects. It's not my only hope. But I
would like to play.
Jenkins: What's the most satisfying aspect of football for you right
now?
Evans: At this point, I just want to win the next three games. It'smy
last season, and of course I want to win. But what I want is not as
important as the team; I want the team to win. That would be the
most satisfying thing right now — to win these last games.
Jenkins: With one of the best offenses in the nation, do you think
maybe the defense doesn't get the recognition it should? Do you
ever feel that the offense gets all the glory, so to speak?
Evans: No. Not at all. I think we get the recognition we deserve.
There have been times when the offense has bailed us out, like
when UCLA scored those two touchdowns in the second half, the
offense kept up with them. But then there are times when we
help them out too, like blocking that field goal. I think we com
plement each other. I'm not proud of the way we played last
week; that was bad but we got it out of our systems.
Jenkins: What do you think of Mark Malone, the Arizona State
quarterback?
Evans: He's a heck of a quarterback. He's the best running quar
terback we will face or have faced all year. Besides that, he's also
an effective passer. All we can hope to do is contain him — not let
him get away from us. He's got incredible speed. We have to
contain him and also put pressure on him and the passing game
— it's going to be up to the defensive line to do that. Taking away
the running aspect and putting pressure on him is the key. If we
can do that we will be OK.
Jenkins: Do you think you yourself can contain him ? Do you feel
capable of itt
Evans: I'm going to do my job. I'm not going to let him get outside.
Of course I will; it's really important that I do well, for me. I'll
certainly be working hard on Saturday. I won't let down.
