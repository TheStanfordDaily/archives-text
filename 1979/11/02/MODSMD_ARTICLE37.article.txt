# Ryan is big prize in baseball draft
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” Pitcher
Nolan Ryan of the California
Angels is the likely target of the
most vigorous bidding war in
baseball's free agent draft set
for today at the plush Plaza
Hotel.
Ryan headlines this year's
crop of more than 40 veteran
players who have declared for
free agency, hoping to mine
some of the gold that baseball
has distributed since the re
entry system began in 1976.
By unofficial count, 34
players have signed contracts
worth more than $1 million

after being claimed in the free
agent draft which replaced
baseball's more restrictive re
serve system. It was the chal
lenge of a pair of pitchers, Andy
Messersmith and Dave Mc-
Nally, who played the entire
1975 season without signing
contracts, that eventually shat
tered the reserve system in the
courts.
The first millionaire created
by the re-entry draft was relief
pitcher Bill Campbell, who
signed with the Boston Red Sox
on Nov. 6, 1976, two days after
the first draft.

There is an interesting mix of
pitchers and veteran players
available in this year's draft.
Besides Ryan, pitchers who
will attract their share ot atten
tion include Al Hrabosky of the
Kansas City Royals, Dave Goltz
of the Minnesota Twins, Fred
Norman of the Cincinnati
Reds, Don Stanhouse of the
Baltimore Orioles, Rick Wise of
the Cleveland Indians, Rudy
May of the Montreal Expos and
Bruce Kison, who started the
opening game of the World
Series for the Pittsburgh Pi
rates.
Also available are veteran
sluggers Bob Watson of the
Boston Red Sox, Tony Perez of
the Montreal Expos, Willie
Horton of the Seattle Mariners.
Two longtime New York
players, Ed Kranepool of the
Mets and Roy White of the
Yankees, are in the draft pool.
Second baseman Joe Morgan
ot the Cincinnati Reds and
shortstop Fred Patek of the
Kansas City Royals, both im
portant regulars on recent divi
sion winning teams, also are up

for grabs.
Merely drafting a player
today means very little, since
all clubs will do at that time is
claim negotiating rights. Each
player may be drafted by 13
clubs and his old team can also
retain negotiating rights to
him.
