Arizona State football players
before making a ruling.
A decision will be made by

case, and keeping in mind due

the Pacific-10 Council has de

into the facts must be con
tinued by the Pac-10 in concert
with the National Collegiate
Athletic Association," said
Wiles Hallock, executive direc
tor for the conference.
The eligibility of the eight
players, therefore, will not be
immediately affected. Several
of them are scheduled to start

Calif.

pete in the annual Head of Es
tuary Sunday at Oakland. The
women will enter a varsity
