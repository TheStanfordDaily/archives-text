"We're putting together a
very good team," fencing
coach )ean Helliwell said Tues
day. Last week's victory over
Sonoma in the season opener
gave the coach reason to feel
optimistic.
"It wasn't just the win, but
the way we saw it done that
pleases me," Helliwell said.
Helliwell's optimism will be
put to the test today when
Stanford crosses swords with
San Jose State, the top fencing
team in the nation.
"We'll have our work cut out
for us this weekend," Helliwell
admitted. "There's no doubt
about it."
Helliwell said the men's foil
and epee teams were a good
bet to win, but that "sabre and

women's foil are a question
mark."
The San Jose State women's
foil team has finished in first
place nationally for five con
secutive years. Stanford
fencers Eva Lohrer, Maria To
kola, Clarissa Eastham and
Kathleen Upton will do their
best to puncture this impres
sive record today.
Tokola, whose devastating
style allowed only one touch to
be scored against her in last
week's meet, should be par
ticularly successful at eluding
the Spartan women's parries.
"We're definitely the under
dogs, but not the underdogs
we've been in the past," new
assistant coach Buzz Hurst said
of the sabre team. Fencing
sabre today will be Peter Costi

gan, Pardner Wynn, Roy Mita
and Jeff Gueble.
Hoping to skewer the Spar
tans in men's foil will be John
Burgess, Raymond Langley,
David Barhott and Tom Bran
non. Burgess had only three
touches scored against him in
last week's meet.
Competing in epee will be
Phillip Gerring, Gary Johnson,
Matt Foley and Harry Coin.
