# Carter backs $1.5 billion Chrysler bailout

Washington (AP) — The Carter administration
went to the rescue of financially troubled Chrysler
Corp. yesterday, urging Congress to approve up
to $1.5 billion in loan guarantees for the nation's
No. 3 automaker.
Treasury Secretary William Miller said the ad
ministration decided to go ahead with the bailout,
the largest ever for a U.S. corporation, even
though it disagrees philosophically with the no
tion of direct government intervention in private
enterprise.
"This is a unique situation . . . that stands on its
own merits," Miller said. "The alternative costs are
more onerous to our country than the risk of loan
guarantees."
The administration aim is to head off a collapse
that could result in widesoread lavoffs and nose

another major headache for an already troubled
economy.
The plan sent to Congress would double the
$750 million that the administration previously in
dicated was the most it would support for
Chrysler.
Under the plan, Chrysler would be required to
raise an additional $1.5 billion from private
sources before it is assured the government loan
guarantees.
He said such a collapse would "affect the stabil
ity of the nation's overall economic outlook" and
bring the risk of "substantial unemployment and
economic disruption."
In New York, Chrysler chairman Lee lacocca
told reporters he was "delighted with the action"
and considered it "a vote of confidence we

needed." The board of directors of the Detroit
based company was meeting in New York.
Chrysler's disappearance would increase un
employment and welfare payments, reduce fed
eral and local taxes and force the government to
pay out pension guarantees to many automakers,
Miller said.
In addition, he said, "We need to maintain a
competitive posture" in the auto industry.
Chrysler's demise would leave only two major au
tomakers — Ford and General Motors.
Chrysler announced Tuesday a staggering
$460.6 million loss in the third quarter, the largest
deficit ever for an American corporation. That
brought the company's losses so tar this year to
$721 million, and Chrysler officials expect 1979's
final deficit to reach a whopping $1 billion.
