## A 						fluffy, not stuffy, Erasmus 
### 
The Drama Department has
launched its 1979-80 season
with a light, engaging treat
ment of Ludvig Holberg's
Erasmus Montanus. Director
Fritz Brun has surprisingly cho
sen a 250-year-old play, whose
level of sophistii .ition is suited
mainly for children.
The play is about a student,
Erasmus (Doug Schuetz), who
has just returned from the
world of academia to the peas
ant life of his home town.
There, he argues with
Jeronimus (Gregg Jackson), a
wealthy freeholder, that the
earth is round. He also proves
that Peer (Richard Clyne), the
Deacon, is a cock.
To change Erasmus' re
volutionary ideas, ]esper
(Brent Shaphren), the Bailiff,
has the Lieutenant (Alfonso
Landa) trick him into the milit
ary. Miserable in this new life
style, Erasmus must finally
proclaim the earth flat to return
to civilian life. At this, the
townspeople are happy, and

Lisbed (Sally Morton), the
daughter of jeronimus, now is
allowed to marry Erasmus.
Thunder, lightning
The play is that simple and
old-fashioned. Only once does
Erasmus engage in any
intellectual/emotional crisis,
the melodrama of which is
nicely underscored with lightn
ing and thunder by lighting de
signer Michael Ramsaur and
sound designer Todd Russell.
William Eddelman's delight
ful set looks like something
thit could have come out of
one of the fairy tales of the
brothers Grimm, especially the
large scroll that divides the play
into its five acts. He enhances
the comedy and cartoon-like
quality of the play even further
with several amusing cut-outs
of the sun, the moon and vari
ous skies raised and lowered
by wires from above the pros
cenium.
The costumes, designed by

Douglas Russell and con
structed by Barbara Cleveland,
are authentic 18th-century
Scandinavian,the soldiers' cos
tumes particularly colorful and
impressive. The whole show is
visually beautiful and well
balanced.
Best showings
While the actors work fairly
well together, some of the in
dividual performances need
polishing. Jim Morrison, who
plays Jacob, the brother of
Erasmus, turns in the best
showing as the comic, brainy

counterpart to the hero. Shap
hren, Landa and Roy Kissin,
who plays the Corporal, also
do fine jobs.
The rest of the cast, how
ever, lacks at least one of three
things: 1) a well-defined
character, 2) a properly pro
jected character, or 3) a believ
able character — a few roles
are over-acted. Players not yet
mentioned include Lee Wit
tenberg and Vanessa MacLaren
as Erasmus' parents, and
Rimma Bogert as jeronimus'
wife.
Aside from this imbalance,
the show runs very smoothly
and should improve with each
performance. Director Brun
has given the Stanford com
munity an unusual play, which
does not especially cater to the
student. Here is a play that, be
cause it relies mostly on sight
gags and character acting, will
appeal to a younger audience.
Erasmus lacks intellectual
stimulation and the customary
social and family pressures that
accompany today's student.
The play runs tonight and
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the Little
Theater, and Wednesday
through Saturday nights next
week.
Tickets are $3 for general
admission, $2.50 discounted
for staff and faculty and $1 for
students. — FENTRESS HILL
