# Fans pogo, Ramones play
## 
### 
I learned to "pogo" last
Saturday night. The hard way.
The occasion was the
Ramones concert at the Oak
land Auditorium Arena, al
though "concert" may not be
the right word for a 5!6-hour
marathon that featured four
bands and began with a show
ing of the Ramones' junk-film
classic, Rock 'n Roll High
School.
Indeed, the evening's fes
tivities illustrated how the
traditional rock "concert" has
been revolutionized by punk
new wave music. The real show
was the audience — not, as in
most 70s rock, the technical
virtuosity or theatrical stunts of
the performers.
When the lights finally dim
med for the Ramones, after
more than four hours of antici
pation, the crowd was on its
feet. The band's appearance
set off a crushing wave of mo
tion, bodies hurtling into
bodies hurtling into more
bodies, pinning the front row
of fans against the stage bar
ricades.
With the first power-chords
from Johnny Ramone's guitar,
the "Cretin-hop" began.
People bounded up and down
like jackhammers, careening
into and off of one another,
bouncing about the arena in
furious random motion. Large
swells rolled through the
crowd, picking up pockets of
fans and depositing them 20
feet farther on.
I quickly discovered that the
only safe place to be was up in
the air. With both feet on the
ground, it was impossible to
avoid being knocked to the
tloor. But by "pogoing" up and
down from foot to foot, I could
harmlessly bounce off of each
collision.
The crowd was a curious
mixture of collegiate fans, local
punks in full regalia, and a few
leather-jacketed street toughs
— punks from another era —
who, unfortunately, seemed to
be at the concert looking for a
little of the old ultraviolence.
Generally, though, the
crowd was extremely well
behaved, united in their en
thusiasm for the four refugees
from Forest Hills, now
happily-familied under the

name Ramone.
In contrast to the audience,
the Rarnones' stage manner
was surprisingly sedate. The
band played with a frenzied
power, but their theatrical
knack ended with the patches
on their jeans.
Johnny played lead guitar
with all the flair one usually re
serves for mowing the lawn.
Singer Joey was forever frozen
in the same absurd pose: his
left knee bent at the edge of
the stage, his right leg lagging
far behind, as if he were about
to serve a tennis ball into the
audience. "I can't believe he's
actually as ugly as he was in the
movie," one girl commented.
Only Dee Dee had real style,
smiling at the crowd and flex
ing his bass guitar like a new
muscle he'd developed at the
end of his arm.
Musically, the Rarnones
were in fine form, although if
one wasn't familiar with the
songs, there was little to make
out amidst the auditorium's
terrible acoustics.
The band charged through
more than 25 songs in 70 mi
nutes, including two encores.
Such manic intensity has estab
lished the Rarnones' music as
the most exciting rock 'n' roll in
America, matching the primal
energy of British punk-rock.
Vet the Rarnones harbor
none of the hostility of their
British counterparts; they rep
resent a distinctly American
breed of punk — the bored
suburban teenager, just hang
ing out looking for some ac

tion, always acting a little
tougher than he really is.
Since the Rarnones emerged
from the New York club scene
in 1975, their reputation has
grown to near-mythic propor
tions among their small body
of fans and the rock press. And
there is something larger than
life about the Rarnones; they
are the real thing, genuine
Americana, unawed by their
legendary status(though at re
ported earnings of $300 a
month each, it is hard to be
spoiled by success) and unin
terested in changing theii
modest way of life.
The Rarnones now a re on the
verge of perhaps the biggest
event in their career, a soon
to-be-released album re
corded with celebrated '60s
producer, Phil Spector. The
only disappointment Saturday
was their failure to play any of
that new material.
Nobody was complaining,
however. The Rarnones
finished up with their classic
tale of domestic dementia,
"We're a Happy Family." Joey
even released his tight hold ori
the mike-stand, just long
enough to raise his arms over
the front-row fans and baptize
them in the rousing chorus.
The fans left the show hap
pily exhausted, having not so
much witnessed a concert as
staged an event. For the audi
ence unmistakably shared
center-stage with the Rarnones
in creating the evening's raw
excitement.
