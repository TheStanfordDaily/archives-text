# Dear John: A sad, soggy night
## 
### 
Dear John Fahey:
Maybe I should just write
that you're a genius, that
you're a truly gifted musician.
Maybe I should just pretend
that you weren't drunk at your
Saturday concert in Cubberly
Auditorium.
But I wouldn't feel right
about glossing over your be
havior, because you're a man
and not just a guitar-playing
machine. "Fahey, the artist"
astounded many of us with his
music, but "Fahey, the man"
alienated many others with his
conduct. I saw people walking
out on you, John. You must
have seen them too.
What kinds of obligations do
performers have to their audi
ences? Do we just put up with
anything — like your
between-song ramblings,
stumblings and spilled beer
bottles — as long as you pro
duce the fine music we came to
hear?
And the music Saturday was

indeed fine. Don't misun
derstand. When you're work
ing I'm convinced that you
could play anything and play it
superbly. When you can make
a simple acoustic guitar sound
like a harp, a fiddle, an electric
guitar — all in one piece — I
know that you're tremend
ously serious about your craft.
"Now we're going to go into
void," you told us early in the
concert. First was "disco void"
— uptempo, flashy; next was
"pure void" — enveloping,
abstract. I didn't always under
stand what you were doing
(maybe no one can) but I ad
mired your immense talent.
As you sat in that hard,
wooden chair and played the
steel guitar on "Steamboat
Goin' Round the Bend", I was
mesmerized. I sat in my own
slightly more comfortable
chair and watched the joints of
your hands. Vou were as
tonishing.
But then you knocked off a

piece of the microphone and
flicked your cigarette ash into
your case and discussed
brands of beers for an inter
minable length of time. I was
embarrassed for you.
Other people didn't bother
to pity you. They just left. They
missed out on some beautiful
guitar-playing — your long,
closing medley — but I guess
they just couldn't take any
more of you.
Maybe the people that left
had only come to hear Reilly
and Maloney, the "special
guests," the warm-up act. The
whole auditorium was fond of
these two guitarists who've
played the Coffee House here
several times in the past.
Ginny Reilly and David
Maloney knew their audience.
They were comfortable with us,
and we with them. Everything
they sang was filled with intel
ligence and humor. Their lyrics
expressed deep strength, a
theme in much of folk music,

old and new.
Ginny's songs particularly
charmed us. We laughed in
sympathy with one entitled
"The I Don't Know What I Want
From You But I Ain't Getting It
Blues." Her song "He's a Fool"
belonged to the I'm OK-
You're-A-)erk school of
thought. In it, she expressed
hoth hurt and resiliency, emo
tions that her audience could
readily hold onto.
Reilly and Maloney put on a
total performance. "It's a plea
sure to play in a real au
ditorium," Maloney said, al
luding to past Coffee House
gigs. And it was a pleasure to
listen to them.
But for you, John Fahey, I
didn't pay my money to see
shoddy behavior. I could have
gone to a Johnny Rotten show
lor that. I just expected from
you as much human dignity as
artistic dignity. I wish you
could have given both.
