This Tree Will Be Here For A
Thousand Years
Robert Bly
Harper and Row
64pp. $8.95
In his introduction to this
new collection of poetry,
Robert Bly warns his readers
that many of the poems which

follow are "quite slender." I
would go a step further, and
say that most of the poems col
lected in This Tree Will Be Here
For A Thousand Years are un
pardonably emaciated. In spite
of the diffident language of his
introduction, Bly makes large
claims for these small poems,

claims on which they mostly
fail to deliver.
Bly spells out for us the
philosophical premises of his
new poetry. He intends his
poetry to suggest . . that
human beings and the 'green
world' share a consciousness.
Each of the poems that follow

contains an instant, sometimes
twenty seconds long, some
times longer, when I was aware
of two separate energies: my
own consciousness, which is
insecure, anxious, massive,
earthbound, persistent, cun
ning, hopeful; and a second
consciousness which is none
of these things.
Nothing new
Emerson and Whitman
would have approved; Bly is
hardly announcing ideas new
to American poetry. Fie be
lieves, however, that this
deeply felt relationship bet
ween human consciousness

and nature is vitally important
to us all at this moment in his
tory.
Bly's problem in this book is
that even deeply felt intuitions
about the nature of things
don't translate themselves au
tomatically into profound
poems. The opening of "Frost
Still in the Ground" illustrates
the thinness of Bly's
technique:
I walk out in the fields; the frost
is still in the ground.
It's like someone just begin
ning to write, and nothing has
been said!
Bly leaps from the barest
possible description of the
physical scene into a descrip
tion of the consciousness in
side the scene without expla
nation or justification; the exc
lamation point tries to impart
to the second line an emo
tional authority and conviction
that it doesn't really possess.
The rest of the poem (it is
only eight lines long, not un
usually short in this book) of
fers little more in the way of
amplification. Bly doesn't, for
me, succeed very well at con
veying his sense of an aware
ness in nature that is somehow
related to human conscious
ness.
Here and in other poems he
considers it enough to give us
the object and assert the rela
tionship, without substantiat
ing it emotionally. For all their
exclamation points, the poems
are lifeless and unconvincing.
Nature's intentions
The book fails, then, at its
central task of communicating
the "two presences," human
consciousness and the con
sciousness alive in nature. Bly
also fails to confront the dif
ficulties he runs into when he
assumes a consciousness in na
ture. If there is consciousness
in nature, we may ask, what are
its intentions? Could it be indif
ferent or hostile to human life?
In his prose poem "Walking
Where the Plows Have Been
Turning" it occurs to Bly to
wonder about nature's appa
rent randomness. "In the risen
sun the earth provides a

cornhusk in one place, a Cot
tonwood tree in another, for
no apparent reason." He
doesn't care, in this poem, that
he doesn't understand na
ture's intentions; he feels fine;
he's confident that "there are
eternities near, the body free
of its exasperations, ready to
see what will happen." All
right. Who cares whether there
is a meaning in the fall of a
cornhusk?
Dismisses suffering
When nature is randomly
destructive, we do ask for
meanings. What is nature's
purpose in floods, fire, dis
ease? Bly treats catastrophe in
the same tone as a fallen
cornhusk:
Disasters are all right, if they
teach men and women to turn
their hollow places up.
This is an outrageously blithe
dismissal of the problem of
human suffering in nature. No
poem is entitled to preach so
trite a moral with so little sen
sitivity to human pain.
I've judged This Tree Will Be
Here For A Thousand Years
harshly because it is frustrating
not to get good poetry from a
National Book Award-winning
poet who enjoys the sort of
reputation that Robert Bly
does. There are successful
poems in this book: "Amazed
by an Accumulation of Snow"
is one of them, but they suc
ceed very modestly.
Frost better than snow
None of these good short

poems begins to approach the
craft and intensity of Robert
Frost's short lyrics, which
explore questions that Bly's
best poetry seems only dimly
aware of. Sometimes Bly
sounds like a Woody Allen
parody of modern poetry:
I woke from a first-day-of-snow
dream.
I met a girl in an attic, who
talked of operas, intensely.
, I wish Bly's subconscious
would dredge up more in
teresting dreams. I wish the
seasons would change for him;
it always snows in Bly's poetry.
I wish this book had given us
less snow, and more poetry.

Robert Bly
This Tree Will Be Here For A
Thousand Years
Robert Bly
Harper and Row
64pp. $8.95
In his introduction to this
new collection of poetry,
Robert Bly warns his readers
that many of the poems which

follow are "quite slender." I
would go a step further, and
say that most of the poems col
lected in This Tree Will Be Here
For A Thousand Years are un
pardonably emaciated. In spite
of the diffident language of his
introduction, Bly makes large
claims for these small poems,

claims on which they mostly
fail to deliver.
Bly spells out for us the
philosophical premises of his
new poetry. He intends his
poetry to suggest . . that
human beings and the 'green
world' share a consciousness.
Each of the poems that follow

contains an instant, sometimes
twenty seconds long, some
times longer, when I was aware
of two separate energies: my
own consciousness, which is
insecure, anxious, massive,
earthbound, persistent, cun
ning, hopeful; and a second
consciousness which is none
of these things.
Nothing new
Emerson and Whitman
would have approved; Bly is
hardly announcing ideas new
to American poetry. Fie be
lieves, however, that this
deeply felt relationship bet
ween human consciousness

and nature is vitally important
to us all at this moment in his
tory.
Bly's problem in this book is
that even deeply felt intuitions
about the nature of things
don't translate themselves au
tomatically into profound
poems. The opening of "Frost
Still in the Ground" illustrates
the thinness of Bly's
technique:
I walk out in the fields; the frost
is still in the ground.
It's like someone just begin
ning to write, and nothing has
been said!
Bly leaps from the barest
possible description of the
physical scene into a descrip
tion of the consciousness in
side the scene without expla
nation or justification; the exc
lamation point tries to impart
to the second line an emo
tional authority and conviction
that it doesn't really possess.
The rest of the poem (it is
only eight lines long, not un
usually short in this book) of
fers little more in the way of
amplification. Bly doesn't, for
me, succeed very well at con
veying his sense of an aware
ness in nature that is somehow
related to human conscious
ness.
Here and in other poems he
considers it enough to give us
the object and assert the rela
tionship, without substantiat
ing it emotionally. For all their
exclamation points, the poems
are lifeless and unconvincing.
Nature's intentions
The book fails, then, at its
central task of communicating
the "two presences," human
consciousness and the con
sciousness alive in nature. Bly
also fails to confront the dif
ficulties he runs into when he
assumes a consciousness in na
ture. If there is consciousness
in nature, we may ask, what are
its intentions? Could it be indif
ferent or hostile to human life?
In his prose poem "Walking
Where the Plows Have Been
Turning" it occurs to Bly to
wonder about nature's appa
rent randomness. "In the risen
sun the earth provides a

cornhusk in one place, a Cot
tonwood tree in another, for
no apparent reason." He
doesn't care, in this poem, that
he doesn't understand na
ture's intentions; he feels fine;
he's confident that "there are
eternities near, the body free
of its exasperations, ready to
see what will happen." All
right. Who cares whether there
is a meaning in the fall of a
cornhusk?
Dismisses suffering
When nature is randomly
destructive, we do ask for
meanings. What is nature's
purpose in floods, fire, dis
ease? Bly treats catastrophe in
the same tone as a fallen
cornhusk:
Disasters are all right, if they
teach men and women to turn
their hollow places up.
This is an outrageously blithe
dismissal of the problem of
human suffering in nature. No
poem is entitled to preach so
trite a moral with so little sen
sitivity to human pain.
I've judged This Tree Will Be
Here For A Thousand Years
harshly because it is frustrating
not to get good poetry from a
National Book Award-winning
poet who enjoys the sort of
reputation that Robert Bly
does. There are successful
poems in this book: "Amazed
by an Accumulation of Snow"
is one of them, but they suc
ceed very modestly.
Frost better than snow
None of these good short

poems begins to approach the
craft and intensity of Robert
Frost's short lyrics, which
explore questions that Bly's
best poetry seems only dimly
aware of. Sometimes Bly
sounds like a Woody Allen
parody of modern poetry:
I woke from a first-day-of-snow
dream.
I met a girl in an attic, who
talked of operas, intensely.
, I wish Bly's subconscious
would dredge up more in
teresting dreams. I wish the
seasons would change for him;
it always snows in Bly's poetry.
I wish this book had given us
less snow, and more poetry.
