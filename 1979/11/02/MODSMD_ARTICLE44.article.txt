This year is the tenth an
niversary of the death of Jack
Kerouac. I suspect that most of
the present generation is famil
iar with Kerouac primarily
through On the Road, his
chronicle of the cross-country
travels of a young man in the
late forties.
Or perhaps he is known only
peripherally, through his as
sociations with such modern
literary figures as Allen
Ginsberg and William Bur
roughs, who were among his
closest friends.
If, to the reader, names like
Kerouac, Burroughs and
Ginsberg mean little or no
thing, then lack's Book is not
for you — yet. First go to a
bookstore and pick up a copy

of On the Road (and perhaps
Naked Lunch and Howl as
well); read it a few times, to
gain your impressions of the
author and of the times about
which he was writing; then let
all this ferment for a year or
three. Then read lack's Book. (I
do not feel biography is the
proper introduction to fiction:
the answers become more
meaningful after having seen
the puzzle.)
Oral biography
lack's Book is an "oral biog
raphy," the main focus being
Kerouac as seen through the
eyes of his friends with the au
thor's material filling in blank
spots and providing con
tinuity. Among those inter
viewed are Gary Snyder, Ken
neth Rexroth, Gregory Corso,
Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and
wives, lovers, friends and vari
ous acquaintances of Kerouac.
This oral approach has both

advantages and disadvantages.
It provides a widely varied pic
ture of Kerouac, from his boy
hood in Lowell, New England
to his death in Florida, seen
from the many perspectives of
the people he knew. The book
works best when the speakers
are capable of the keen in
sights necessary in reconstruc
ting an individual as compli
cated as Kerouac, a task made
harder by the nearness of the
times in which he lived.
While some of the speakers
achieve this insight, many do
not. There is much repetition
of less than profound details,
statements to the effect of
"Jack was a great guy; every
body liked him," or "Jack really
liked people."
'Tragic flaw?'
The problem with these
vague banalities is they shed
no light on a major problem:
why was this gregarious, well
liked, promising writer dead at
forty-seven, a lonely alcoholic?
The brief explanation given in
the prologue, Kerouac's death
ascribed to a failure to adopt
any "survival techniques" to
combat the effects of success,
only begins to address this
fundamental question.
Did Kerouac have a "tragic
flaw?" Was his demise a func
tion of the times? Could his
friends have helped, and why
didn'tthey? In spiteof the mass
of information about Kerouac,
these questions slip through
unanswered.
It is questionable whether or
not this oral biography could
answer these questions. In
deed, many of the people in
terviewed are still caught up in
answering them: many have
not come to terms with either
Kerouac's death or their role in

it. The tendency towards self
destruction was not confined
to Kerouac alone.
Burroughs and his wife were
addicts for years (her death,
casually reported, may be the
most shocking incident of the
book). Neal Cassady,
Kerouac's close friend, tried to
commit suicide, and it can be
argued that he succeeded in
the long run. Even Allen
Ginsberg was tending toward
the same ends as his friends
until he finally accepted the
fact of his homosexuality, a
turning point in his life and his
career as a poet. What was act
ing on these people?
Beyond Kerouac
It may be that ten years is not
enough time for a decision.
Tragedy almost always makes it
harder to judge a man impar
tially. And nostalgia, which
permeates Jack's Book in the
reminiscences of his friends, is
not the perspective we need in
considering a man like
Kerouac. One thinks of the re
lentless wanderings of On the
Road, both a search for a solu
tion to the promise of unend
ing poverty and aimlessness,
and a flight from the fact that
such a solution may never be
found. For Kerouac it was not.
The value of this book goes
beyond its relating of the life
and death of Jack Kerouac. It is
also a biography of the many
people who, in speaking about
Kerouac, tell so much about
themselves. The book might
more aptly be titled "Jack's
World" for it is an historical
document as well, an insight
into not only the lives but the
times of these people who, like
Kerouac, have become so im
portant a part of America's
literary tradition.
