Richard Helms' first ambi
tion in life was to own a news
paper. Indeed, upon gradua
tion from college he worked
{or the United Press in Europe
$nd later for the Indianapolis
■jimes. Then came World War
11, and Helms got his first job in
Intelligence.
•* Thirty years later, as former
head of the Central Intelli
gence Agency, Helms' little
fcnown face was seen by mill

ions of television viewers as he
was being cross-examined by
•he Senate Watergate Commit
tee.
Definitive work
Pulitzer-prize winning au
thor Thomas Powers takes up
from those early days in the
Navy Office of Strategic Ser
vices through the time Helms
was fired by Nixon at Camp
David. This is perhaps the de
finitive work on the CIA and
certainly on Helms.
The cast of characters is stun
ning, more so because they
were real and the most power

ful people in the world. Start
ing with an interview Helms
conducted with Adolf Hitler on
the parapets of Nuremberg
Castle in 1936, appearances are
made by Harry Truman, Sal
vador Allende, John F. Ken
nedy and his brother Robert.
The characters, coupled with
Powers' straightforward, con
trolled "new journalistic" writ
ing, gives some clue why, as
Texas author Larry McMurtry
said, journalism may be de
stroying the novel. It is be
cause the journalist's subject
matter, reality, can't be beat,
and they're simply out-writing
the fiction mongers.
Bay of Pigs
An example of the force of
Powers' narration is his de
scription of the Bay of Pigs fiasco
and th'e reasons behind its fai
lure. "Almost as soon as the
initial 25 (CIA-trained exiles)
went to Panama in September
1960, it became clear that the
resistance within Cuba had
been much exaggerated, and
the efficiency of the Cuban
security forces underesti
mated. Infiltrated agents were
often picked up within a day or

two. Communications were so
bad that air-dropped supplies
frequently arrived too early or
late or were intercepted out
right by Castro's forces."
Of Kennedy's role in the
Cuban invasion, Powers
writes: "He was principally
concerned with the political
consequences: reluctant to
abandon it entirely, and thus
invite Republican charges he
was soft on Communism. Ken
nedy hoped to scale down the
invasion sufficiently that it
might pass relatively un
noticed."
Helms, Powers reveals, was
not wild about the notion, and
was particularly concerned
when it changed from a clan
destine guerilla operation to an
armed invasion. "But at the
same time," he writes,"he
(Helms) could not stand en
tirely aside." According to one
report Powers quotes, Helms
insisted on the involvement of
James Angleton's counterintel
ligence staff in the anti-Castro
plans.
Chile
Equally revealing and in
teresting is the examination of
the CIA-ITT involvement in the
infamous Chilean episode.
Powers recalls the words of
Henry Kissinger in 1970, "I
don't see why we have to let a
country go Marxist just be
cause its people are irrespon
sible. "The author explains that
Kissinger restricted the U.S.
involvement to "spoiling op
erations and a $500,000 con
tingency fund" to influence
the final vote of the Chilean
Congress.
The book states what most
people know or suspect, that
Helms repeatedly lied before
Senate investigative commit
tees — on the CIA role in Chile
and on other matters. Helms
was generally placed in a very
difficult position, having to

choose between his own hide
and loyalty to the Agency.
Writes Powers: "Helms
knew that it he changed his tes
timony he would be drawing
attention to the ClA's cam
paign to prevent Allende's
election. An even deeper sec
ret was the ClA's unsuccessful
effort to mount a military coup
in Chile to prevent Allende
from taking office after he had
won a plurality in the elec
tion."
Interestingly, Powers con
tradicts Charles Colson's and
H.R. Haldeman's claims that
the CIA masterminded the
Watergate break-in. Helms
said time and again that he
didn't know anything about it,
that nobody in the Agency ever
confessed having prior know
ledge, that E. Howard Hunt was
not under Agency orders, and
that the CIA had no part in the
break-in. "The evidence," says
Powers, "tends to support his
claims."
Sympathetic portrayal
The portrayal of Helms at
times is almost sympathetic,
for Powers is cognizant of the
fact that Richard Helms is a
man who at the end of his long
career found himself charged
with perjury for doing what he
conceived to be his job. He
seldom saw the ClA's actions
as being ethically or inherently
wrong.
Powers early in the book out
lines his own perspective: "I
have tried to avoid a pro
secutorial approach, because it
leads to a legalistic definition
of the problem, and leaves out
more than it includes."
The author's analysis goes
right to the heart of the matter.
What should concern Ameri
cans, he says, is not primarily
the fact that certain CIA opera
tives have escaped justice —
Helms' is a larger view. What
we need to contemplate is the

"nature of the role that the Un
ited States has chosen for itself
in the world, a role importantly
supported and implemented
by the CIA."
Public service
The reviewer is wholly in ag
reement with the Boston
Globe's comment that the
book is a "public service." It is
one of those very rare books
that needs to be read, and one
that will give even the most ar
dent patriot and interven
tionist reason to pause, to re

flect. The list of dirty tricks is
long, and some items are hor
rifying, such as the plot con
cerning a poisoned handker
chief to "incapacitate" General
Kassem of Iraq in 1%0.
Perhaps readers as they
finish the book will concur
with Powers: "It is tough
enough for Americans to run
their own country wisely; the
idea that they can do better for
someone else's is sheer pre
sumption."

The portrayal of Helms at
times is almost sympathetic,
for Powers is cognizant of the
fact that Richard Helms is a
man who at the end of his long
career found himself charged
with perjury for doing what he
conceived to be his job. He
seldom saw the ClA's actions
as being ethically or inherently
wrong.
Powers early in the book out
lines his own perspective: "I
have tried to avoid a pro
secutorial approach, because it
leads to a legalistic definition
of the problem, and leaves out
more than it includes."
The author's analysis goes
right to the heart of the matter.
What should concern Ameri
cans, he says, is not primarily
the fact that certain CIA opera
tives have escaped justice —
Helms' is a larger view. What
we need to contemplate is the

"nature of the role that the Un
ited States has chosen for itself
in the world, a role importantly
supported and implemented
by the CIA."
Public service
The reviewer is wholly in ag
reement with the Boston
Globe's comment that the
book is a "public service." It is
one of those very rare books
that needs to be read, and one
that will give even the most ar
dent patriot and interven
tionist reason to pause, to re

flect. The list of dirty tricks is
long, and some items are hor
rifying, such as the plot con
cerning a poisoned handker
chief to "incapacitate" General
Kassem of Iraq in 1%0.
Perhaps readers as they
finish the book will concur
with Powers: "It is tough
enough for Americans to run
their own country wisely; the
idea that they can do better for
someone else's is sheer pre
sumption."

The Man Who Kept the
Secrets
•Thomas Powers
"Alfred A. Knopf
'?27 pp. $12.95
Richard Helms' first ambi
tion in life was to own a news
paper. Indeed, upon gradua
tion from college he worked
{or the United Press in Europe
$nd later for the Indianapolis
■jimes. Then came World War
11, and Helms got his first job in
Intelligence.
•* Thirty years later, as former
head of the Central Intelli
gence Agency, Helms' little
fcnown face was seen by mill

ions of television viewers as he
was being cross-examined by
•he Senate Watergate Commit
tee.
Definitive work
Pulitzer-prize winning au
thor Thomas Powers takes up
from those early days in the
Navy Office of Strategic Ser
vices through the time Helms
was fired by Nixon at Camp
David. This is perhaps the de
finitive work on the CIA and
certainly on Helms.
The cast of characters is stun
ning, more so because they
were real and the most power

ful people in the world. Start
ing with an interview Helms
conducted with Adolf Hitler on
the parapets of Nuremberg
Castle in 1936, appearances are
made by Harry Truman, Sal
vador Allende, John F. Ken
nedy and his brother Robert.
The characters, coupled with
Powers' straightforward, con
trolled "new journalistic" writ
ing, gives some clue why, as
Texas author Larry McMurtry
said, journalism may be de
stroying the novel. It is be
cause the journalist's subject
matter, reality, can't be beat,
and they're simply out-writing
the fiction mongers.
Bay of Pigs
An example of the force of
Powers' narration is his de
scription of the Bay of Pigs fiasco
and th'e reasons behind its fai
lure. "Almost as soon as the
initial 25 (CIA-trained exiles)
went to Panama in September
1960, it became clear that the
resistance within Cuba had
been much exaggerated, and
the efficiency of the Cuban
security forces underesti
mated. Infiltrated agents were
often picked up within a day or

two. Communications were so
bad that air-dropped supplies
frequently arrived too early or
late or were intercepted out
right by Castro's forces."
Of Kennedy's role in the
Cuban invasion, Powers
writes: "He was principally
concerned with the political
consequences: reluctant to
abandon it entirely, and thus
invite Republican charges he
was soft on Communism. Ken
nedy hoped to scale down the
invasion sufficiently that it
might pass relatively un
noticed."
Helms, Powers reveals, was
not wild about the notion, and
was particularly concerned
when it changed from a clan
destine guerilla operation to an
armed invasion. "But at the
same time," he writes,"he
(Helms) could not stand en
tirely aside." According to one
report Powers quotes, Helms
insisted on the involvement of
James Angleton's counterintel
ligence staff in the anti-Castro
plans.
Chile
Equally revealing and in
teresting is the examination of
the CIA-ITT involvement in the
infamous Chilean episode.
Powers recalls the words of
Henry Kissinger in 1970, "I
don't see why we have to let a
country go Marxist just be
cause its people are irrespon
sible. "The author explains that
Kissinger restricted the U.S.
involvement to "spoiling op
erations and a $500,000 con
tingency fund" to influence
the final vote of the Chilean
Congress.
The book states what most
people know or suspect, that
Helms repeatedly lied before
Senate investigative commit
tees — on the CIA role in Chile
and on other matters. Helms
was generally placed in a very
difficult position, having to

choose between his own hide
and loyalty to the Agency.
Writes Powers: "Helms
knew that it he changed his tes
timony he would be drawing
attention to the ClA's cam
paign to prevent Allende's
election. An even deeper sec
ret was the ClA's unsuccessful
effort to mount a military coup
in Chile to prevent Allende
from taking office after he had
won a plurality in the elec
tion."
Interestingly, Powers con
tradicts Charles Colson's and
H.R. Haldeman's claims that
the CIA masterminded the
Watergate break-in. Helms
said time and again that he
didn't know anything about it,
that nobody in the Agency ever
confessed having prior know
ledge, that E. Howard Hunt was
not under Agency orders, and
that the CIA had no part in the
break-in. "The evidence," says
Powers, "tends to support his
claims."
