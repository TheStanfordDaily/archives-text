Surf, San Francisco
A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
intend to think about it and not
just bask in its glow. Artful
black-and-white cinematography
combines with new directing
skills and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden
Camera Award for the best fea
ture film this year. See it for its
human characterizations and
poignant plot. A thinking per
son's movie.
—Seth Zuckerman
Luna * *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful ettorts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
Ihe dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and a son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's tirst English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the brilliant
cinematography in Apocalypse
Now) provides him with startling
images, but Bertolucci seems to
till be groping with the intellec
tual dimensions ol his subject;

he's not quite sure how to com
municate it. In a very different
role, |ill Clayburgh is sporadically
good; it's her most mannered
performance, and such an ap
proach doesn't quite suit her. As
the son, Matthew Brady is the
best thing in the movie. Both
overpoweringly violent and sur
prisingly sensual, Brady delivers
a frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.
—Ron Lillejord
Apocalypse Non * * * *
Old Mill
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.

Starting Ovei * *
Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above the level of
uninspired '40s romantic com
edy; couple gets divorced, man
looks for someone new, lots of
"comic misadventures" along
the way, man finally finds some
one, his wife tries to take him
back, man forced to choose bet

ween his ex-wife and new love.
The major "suspense" concerns
who he will pick. Not exactly your
most wonderlully novel movie
idea.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much if the movie were carried
off with the kind o! winking
lightness that Burt Reynolds' per
formance here contrnually deliv
ers. (ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to

be bad — and she's successful.
Director Alan Pakula (Klute, All

home with drama; his comic
touch is, at best, unsure. No mat
ter what Burt Reynolds is in, it
seems, he ends up being the only
reason to see it.

Life of Brian * it
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Sort of like Codspell with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all
funny, but it goes on for much
too long. Python takes aim at bi
blical epics, terrorist logistics,
and the PLO; while they don't
.always score, even a series of
bullseyes would be boring. A
Python movie needs a better plot
than the Bible can provide.
—Mike Hale
And lustice For All *
Palo Alio Square
About 10 years ago, this film
would have made a great IV pilot
movie, and that's probably the
best that can be said for it. Lots of
the "can the honest, crusading
lawyer keep his integrity in the
ugly, dog-eat-dog world of crim
inals, dirty attorneys and dishon
est judges?" type conflict. Direc
tor Norman Jewison, who should
know better, directs the shallow
dramatics and cheap comedy in
the script with an embarrassing
earnestness. Al Pacino has never
seemed so ordinary; by sheer
force of will, he's interesting, but
the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be successful in his bid for
a weekly series?" Pacino must be
more ambitious than that.

Annie Hall * * * *
New Varsity, Thursday-? nday
A movie about a skinny, red
haired schlemeil comedian with
No-Doz mannerisms and a
masochistic wit. Roughly di

tone and a vaguely disturbing af
tertaste. In short, the best movie
Woody Allen has ever made. For

all of their strengths, Allen lilms
until Annie had been exert ises in
comic overkill, they never let up,

stunning images of Vietnam that

the profound questions that it

A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
intend to think about it and not
just bask in its glow. Artful
black-and-white cinematography
combines with new directing
skills and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden

human characterizations and
poignant plot. A thinking per

Luna * *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful ettorts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
Ihe dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and a son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's tirst English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the brilliant
cinematography in Apocalypse
Now) provides him with startling
images, but Bertolucci seems to
till be groping with the intellec
tual dimensions ol his subject;

he's not quite sure how to com
municate it. In a very different
role, |ill Clayburgh is sporadically
good; it's her most mannered
performance, and such an ap
proach doesn't quite suit her. As
the son, Matthew Brady is the
best thing in the movie. Both
overpoweringly violent and sur

a frighteningly intense embodi

Annie Hall * * * *
New Varsity, Thursday-? nday
A movie about a skinny, red
haired schlemeil comedian with
No-Doz mannerisms and a
masochistic wit. Roughly di
rected, with a whiney, indulgent
tone and a vaguely disturbing af
tertaste. In short, the best movie
Woody Allen has ever made. For

all of their strengths, Allen lilms
until Annie had been exert ises in
comic overkill, they never let up,
and eventually, albeit guiltily, we
wish he would shut up for a mi
nute. Annie is ditterent in that it
lets the ribs rest from time to
time. To use a wildly revealing
phrase, this is a movie with
depth.

Northern Lights # * * *■
Surf, San Francisco
A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
intend to think about it and not
just bask in its glow. Artful
black-and-white cinematography
combines with new directing
skills and a fresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal of the struggle for far
mers' rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden
Camera Award for the best fea
ture film this year. See it for its
human characterizations and
poignant plot. A thinking per
son's movie.
—Seth Zuckerman
Luna * *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful ettorts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
Ihe dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and a son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's tirst English-language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the brilliant
cinematography in Apocalypse
Now) provides him with startling
images, but Bertolucci seems to
till be groping with the intellec
tual dimensions ol his subject;

he's not quite sure how to com
municate it. In a very different
role, |ill Clayburgh is sporadically
good; it's her most mannered
performance, and such an ap
proach doesn't quite suit her. As
the son, Matthew Brady is the
best thing in the movie. Both
overpoweringly violent and sur
prisingly sensual, Brady delivers
a frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.
—Ron Lillejord
Apocalypse Non * * * *
Old Mill
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.
—R.L.

Starting Ovei * *
Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above the level of
uninspired '40s romantic com

looks for someone new, lots of
"comic misadventures" along
the way, man finally finds some
one, his wife tries to take him
back, man forced to choose bet

ween his ex-wife and new love.
The major "suspense" concerns
who he will pick. Not exactly your
most wonderlully novel movie
idea.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much if the movie were carried
off with the kind o! winking
lightness that Burt Reynolds' per
formance here contrnually deliv
ers. (ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to

be bad — and she's successful.
Director Alan Pakula (Klute, All
The President's Men) is more at
home with drama; his comic
touch is, at best, unsure. No mat
ter what Burt Reynolds is in, it
seems, he ends up being the only
reason to see it.

Aquarius, Palo Alto
Sort of like Codspell with dirty

are lost in the drivel; it's all
funny, but it goes on for much
too long. Python takes aim at bi
blical epics, terrorist logistics,
and the PLO; while they don't
.always score, even a series of
bullseyes would be boring. A
Python movie needs a better plot
than the Bible can provide.
