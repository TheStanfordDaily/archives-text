# Law School gets Calder 'beastie'
## 'Faucon' to be assembled today 
### Cheryl Fujimoto 
"Le Faucon" (The Falcon), a dramatic, black-painted,
three-ton sculpture by Alexander Calder is scheduled to
be assembled today in the Law School courtyard.
An ironworker who worked for Calder for many years
flew in from Connecticut last night to supervise the
reassemblage. The work, which arrived Wednesday in
three parts, is made of steel, stands 12 feet high and
measures 20 feet long by 10 feet wide.
The Falcon was fabricated in 1961 in an iron works in
Tours, France, six miles from Calder's studio outside the
village of Sache. It remained in front of his studio from
the time of its completion until after Calder's death in
1976.
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lang of Seattle, who endowed
the dean's chair at the Law School, donated the work.
Lang is a member of the Law School class ot 1929 and a
well-known art collector.
Prof. Albert tlsen, acting chairman of the Art Depart
ment and instrumental in bringing the sculpture here,
said that Lang wanted an outdoor sculpture which woulrl

provide a strong contrast to the building and perpetual
enjoyment to faculty, staff and students.
The sculpture is one of a series of "beasties" Calder
made beginning in the mid-19205. According to Elsen, a
characteristic of Calder's sculptures is a certain "pro
vocative ambiguity."
"This falcon can be seen from some angles as a kind of
winged dragon, as well as a bird," Elsen said. "(Calder)
designed his sculptures to have a plurality of views and
meanings."
Elsen described Calder as one of the pioneers of mass
less sculpture meant to be seen in the round.
Calder — and the Ealcon — are not total strangers to
Stanford students as people in the Tours program often
visited him at his studio, where the Falcon sat on a
terrace overlooking a valley, Elsen said.
"Sandy Calder had a witty, as well as serious, side, and
in all probability he would have been amused that his
sculpture, whose name is associated with a bird of prey,
is now located in front of a law school."
