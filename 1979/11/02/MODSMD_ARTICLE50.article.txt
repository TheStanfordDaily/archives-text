Army colonel leads Bolivian coup
La Pa/, Bolivia — A right-wing army colonel seized
power yesterday in a pre-dawn coup against President
Walter Guevara, Bolivia's first democratically elected
president in a decade. Guevara had been in office less
than three months.
Students and workers opposed to the takeover by Col.
Alberto Natusch took to the streets of the capital, hurl

ing rocks at armored cars. The soldiers opened fire, and
police sources and witnesses said at least five civilians
were killed and dozens wounded.
The47-year-old Natusch, a former agriculture minister
and until two weeks ago commander of the military
college, declared himself president and said he would
guarantee freedom tor Bolivia's political parties.
Guevara, who took office Aug. 8, went into hiding. He
issued a signed appeal for military units in other parts of
the country to rescue his government, but there was no
immediate sign of any counter-coup.
Food prices drop, others increase
Washington — Wholesale prices increased another 1
percent in October, less than the September increase,
but enough to signal more tough going for inflation
weary consumers.
The only good news in the government's wholesale
price report yesterday was an 0.1 percent decline in food
prices, the first drop in four months. Food prices in
creased 1.8 percent in September.
But the easing of food prices was largely offset by
higher prices in other areas, especially fuel, but also for
1980 automobiles. Gasoline was up 5.1 percent, while
heating oil rose 4.7 percent.
If the trend continues, and consumer prices rise by
near 13 percent for the year, it will make 1979 the worst
year for inflation since 1946, when prices increased 18.2
percent after war-time wage and price controls were
lifted.
PacTel seeks $381 million rate hike
San Francisco — Pacific Telephone asked for a $381
million annual rate increase yesterday to "improve the
company's bleak financial outlook," pay for a $2.3 billion
construction program and "prevent a breakdown in ser
vice."
The proposed increases requested from the California
Public Utilities Commission would raise revenues by
less than 9.5 percent, the telephone company said, with
60 percent of the increase borne by business customers
and 40 percent by residential subscribers.
If approved, the new rates would increase the
monthly bill of an average residence customer by $2.

ailing Chrysler Corp., a barrage of news from Interna
tional Business Machines Corp. and merger develop
ments overshadowed a mixture of economic news yes
terday as the stock market recorded an advance.

Food prices drop, others increase
Washington — Wholesale prices increased another 1
percent in October, less than the September increase,
but enough to signal more tough going for inflation
weary consumers.
The only good news in the government's wholesale
price report yesterday was an 0.1 percent decline in food
prices, the first drop in four months. Food prices in
creased 1.8 percent in September.
But the easing of food prices was largely offset by
higher prices in other areas, especially fuel, but also for
1980 automobiles. Gasoline was up 5.1 percent, while
heating oil rose 4.7 percent.
If the trend continues, and consumer prices rise by
near 13 percent for the year, it will make 1979 the worst
year for inflation since 1946, when prices increased 18.2
percent after war-time wage and price controls were
lifted.
