# Transplant candidate ineligible
## 
### Andrea lames 
The 39-year-old former firefighter
whose hometown collected $60,000
so he could afford tests for a delicate
heart transplant operation here was
determined to be ineligible for the
risky surgery, University physicians
announced yesterday.
Fred Kelley, who was admitted to
the University Hospital Monday for
extensive tests, does not have a heart
condition serious enough to warrant
■ risks associated with
transplantation, doctors said.
Such risks include rejection of the
transplanted heart by the body and
increased susceptibility to infection.
About one out of every 40 candidates
qualify for the surgery.
This current decision does not,
however, ruje out the possibility that
the Framingham, Mass. man may be
a candidate in the future, spokesmen
said.
Citizens of Framingham voted
104-13 at a town meeting in early Oc
tober to donate $60,000 toward Kel
ley's medical expenses.
That collection will now be held in
escrow to be used in a later re
evaluation of Kelley's heart condi
tion, the patient said.
Kelley was released from the Hos
pital yesterday and will return to
Massachusetts to remain under his
own doctor's care. If his condition
declines, he will return here for
further tests, physicians said.

Two heart attacks since mid-1978
forced Kelley to retire after 15 years
from the Framingham Fire Depart
ment. He was referred to Stanford by
doctors in Massachusetts.
Upon his arrival in Palo Alto last
week, the local firefighters union
and television and news reporters
greeted Kelley. The local union paid
his hotel expenses and plane fare.
"If it weren't for them, we'd be

nowhere," Kelley said in reference tc
the people of I ramingham and the
union here.
"Everyone has been so good to us
We've had nothing but positive sup
port," added his wife.
The University is one of the major
heart transplant centers in the world.
About 70 percent of its patients are
still living one year after heart trans
plant surgery and nearly 50 percent
are still alive tive years later.
