# Security on campus:
## Personal responsibility, visible security force considered key crime deterrent, officials say 
### Victor Goetz 
A single locked door is the dormitory resident's
only protection against the wide variety of strangers
who can easily wander in, according to Director of
Police Services Marv Herrington.
"We've had the kind of 'garden variety' of petty
thefts and burglaries that naturally occur with so
many people living so close together. People leave
their doors open and someone picks up a wallet or a
purse or a watch," said Herrington.
"When you're dealing with people you're going to
have security problems," Medical Center Director of
Facilities Protection Hilary Ryniewicz said.
But he added there have been few cases of doors
being forced.
In the dorms, resident fellows and house as
sociates (RAs) place major emphasis from the begin
ning of the year on the precautions individuals must
take to protect themselves and their property.
Responsibility
"We encourage personal responsibility by telling
people to lock their doors and not be hesitant about
reporting unfamiliar people to the RAs or resident
fellows," said Meb Vikramsingh, an RA at Lagunita.
"When you see someone you don't know who
appears lost or suspicious, don't be afraid to confront
them, not in an aggressive way, but just to ask them if
you can help them. If they give you an evasive answer
or still seem suspicious, don't be afraid to give us
(campus security) a call and have us check them out,"
said Herrington.
"Remember, that dorm is your home."
Doors locked
Outside doors of dorms are locked for the flight so
only residents using their room keys can enter. The
hours vary from dorm to dorm.
Keeping the outside doors locked is half the pre
vention since it keeps potential trouble out before it

can happen.
"We kind of preach at it all the time, but propping
outside doors open is just inviting problems. It en
courages people who don't belong to come in and do
what they will," said Herrington.
Larkin incident
Yet with all the emphasis Campus Security and RAs
place on personal responsibility, an incident at Larkin
House Monday night points out the possible holes in
the sytem.
According to RA David Bohrer, it took five weeks
before he was informed Monday night by security
that it was his responsibility to lock the outside
door with his master key.
Locking the doors "was very irregular; whenever
security made their routine patrol they would lock
our doors if they weren't locked," he said.
"I'm still concerned that something of that impor
tance isn't made clear to us. I would say that we've
been a fairly huge security risk for the past five
weeks," Bohrer said.
Other risk areas
Dorms are not the only security risk on campus.
There are between 70 and 100 security alarms in build
ings around campus, according to Herrington, pro
tecting such things as Wells Fargo Bank, valuable
collections and official documents.
The Medical Center has its own security force.
"A health care institution such as this has a built-in
security risk because it is open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week," said Ryniewicz.
"Health care includes every facet of the security
field. We have a diet department comparable to a
restaurant, patients comparable to hotel guests, a
cashier comparable to a bank and a receiving opera
tion the same as in any industry."
So the Med Center hires more than 20 security

officers who put in about 900 man-hours a week to
patrol the 1.25-million-square-foot facility.
Campus police regularly patrol the rest of the cam
pus throughout the night.
The Med Center force encounters the problems
common to hospitals — parking lot thefts,
emergency room disturbances and internal property
theft.
The security officers "are a highly visible, mobile
deterrent force," Ryniewicz said.
Security personnel are distinctively dressed and
easily recognizable as they walk through all parts of
the building.
Escorts
Employees are provided with escort service to and
from their cars by two clearly marked, radio
equipped vans that make regular rounds of the park
ing lots.
Closed-circuit TV cameras monitor all parking lots
and many internal points as well, such as the
emergency room, cashier's office and main lobby.

Signs proclaim the presence of the equipment.
Monitors can also tape a crime in progress.
"This equipment was put in at great expense to the
Medical Center, but we feel that anyone intent on
tommitting a crime will see the signs and equipment
and think twice about maybe going somewhere that
isn't quite as well watched," said Ryniewicz.
The dorms may be one such less-watched place.
Furniture
This year there have been some problems with
theft of furniture from dorms. "Some we find, some
surlaces at the end ot the year, and some we never
see again," said Herrington.
"We did have some things stolen when people
were moving in and no one really knew who was
who," said Ann Jennings, head RA at Toyon.
"It is really important to realize that this place is a
mecca for thieves and people who have ulterior mo
tives simply because there are so many people so
concentrated living in a relatively rich style," said
Robert Hamrdla, Larkin resident fellow.

and think twice about maybe going somewhere that
isn't quite as well watched," said Ryniewicz.
The dorms may be one such less-watched place.
Furniture
This year there have been some problems with
theft of furniture from dorms. "Some we find, some
surlaces at the end ot the year, and some we never
see again," said Herrington.
"We did have some things stolen when people
were moving in and no one really knew who was
who," said Ann Jennings, head RA at Toyon.
"It is really important to realize that this place is a
mecca for thieves and people who have ulterior mo
tives simply because there are so many people so
concentrated living in a relatively rich style," said
Robert Hamrdla, Larkin resident fellow.
A single locked door is the dormitory resident's
only protection against the wide variety of strangers
who can easily wander in, according to Director of
Police Services Marv Herrington.
"We've had the kind of 'garden variety' of petty
thefts and burglaries that naturally occur with so
many people living so close together. People leave
their doors open and someone picks up a wallet or a
purse or a watch," said Herrington.
"When you're dealing with people you're going to
have security problems," Medical Center Director of
Facilities Protection Hilary Ryniewicz said.
But he added there have been few cases of doors
being forced.
In the dorms, resident fellows and house as
sociates (RAs) place major emphasis from the begin
ning of the year on the precautions individuals must
take to protect themselves and their property.
Responsibility
"We encourage personal responsibility by telling
people to lock their doors and not be hesitant about
reporting unfamiliar people to the RAs or resident
fellows," said Meb Vikramsingh, an RA at Lagunita.
"When you see someone you don't know who
appears lost or suspicious, don't be afraid to confront
them, not in an aggressive way, but just to ask them if
you can help them. If they give you an evasive answer
or still seem suspicious, don't be afraid to give us
(campus security) a call and have us check them out,"
said Herrington.
"Remember, that dorm is your home."
Doors locked
Outside doors of dorms are locked for the flight so
only residents using their room keys can enter. The
hours vary from dorm to dorm.
Keeping the outside doors locked is half the pre
vention since it keeps potential trouble out before it

can happen.
"We kind of preach at it all the time, but propping
outside doors open is just inviting problems. It en
courages people who don't belong to come in and do
what they will," said Herrington.
Larkin incident
Yet with all the emphasis Campus Security and RAs
place on personal responsibility, an incident at Larkin
House Monday night points out the possible holes in
the sytem.
According to RA David Bohrer, it took five weeks
before he was informed Monday night by security
that it was his responsibility to lock the outside
door with his master key.
Locking the doors "was very irregular; whenever
security made their routine patrol they would lock
our doors if they weren't locked," he said.
"I'm still concerned that something of that impor
tance isn't made clear to us. I would say that we've
been a fairly huge security risk for the past five
weeks," Bohrer said.
Other risk areas
Dorms are not the only security risk on campus.
There are between 70 and 100 security alarms in build
ings around campus, according to Herrington, pro
tecting such things as Wells Fargo Bank, valuable
collections and official documents.
The Medical Center has its own security force.
"A health care institution such as this has a built-in
security risk because it is open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week," said Ryniewicz.
"Health care includes every facet of the security
field. We have a diet department comparable to a
restaurant, patients comparable to hotel guests, a
cashier comparable to a bank and a receiving opera
tion the same as in any industry."
So the Med Center hires more than 20 security

common to hospitals — parking lot thefts,
emergency room disturbances and internal property
theft.
The security officers "are a highly visible, mobile
deterrent force," Ryniewicz said.
Security personnel are distinctively dressed and
easily recognizable as they walk through all parts of
the building.
Escorts
Employees are provided with escort service to and
from their cars by two clearly marked, radio
equipped vans that make regular rounds of the park
ing lots.
Closed-circuit TV cameras monitor all parking lots
and many internal points as well, such as the
emergency room, cashier's office and main lobby.

Signs proclaim the presence of the equipment.
Monitors can also tape a crime in progress.
"This equipment was put in at great expense to the
Medical Center, but we feel that anyone intent on

isn't quite as well watched," said Ryniewicz.
