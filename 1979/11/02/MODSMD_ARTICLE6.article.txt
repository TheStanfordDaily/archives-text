# Security on campus:
## Personal responsibility, visible security force considered key crime deterrent, officials say 
### Victor Goetz 
A single locked door is the dormitory resident's
only protection against the wide variety of strangers
who can easily wander in, according to Director of
Police Services Marv Herrington.
"We've had the kind of 'garden variety' of petty
thefts and burglaries that naturally occur with so
many people living so close together. People leave
their doors open and someone picks up a wallet or a
purse or a watch," said Herrington.
"When you're dealing with people you're going to
have security problems," Medical Center Director of
Facilities Protection Hilary Ryniewicz said.
But he added there have been few cases of doors
being forced.
In the dorms, resident fellows and house as
sociates (RAs) place major emphasis from the begin
ning of the year on the precautions individuals must
take to protect themselves and their property.
Responsibility
"We encourage personal responsibility by telling
people to lock their doors and not be hesitant about
reporting unfamiliar people to the RAs or resident
fellows," said Meb Vikramsingh, an RA at Lagunita.
"When you see someone you don't know who
appears lost or suspicious, don't be afraid to confront
them, not in an aggressive way, but just to ask them if
you can help them. If they give you an evasive answer
or still seem suspicious, don't be afraid to give us
(campus security) a call and have us check them out,"
said Herrington.
"Remember, that dorm is your home."
Doors locked
Outside doors of dorms are locked for the flight so
only residents using their room keys can enter. The
hours vary from dorm to dorm.
Keeping the outside doors locked is half the pre
vention since it keeps potential trouble out before it

can happen.
"We kind of preach at it all the time, but propping
outside doors open is just inviting problems. It en
courages people who don't belong to come in and do
what they will," said Herrington.
Larkin incident
Yet with all the emphasis Campus Security and RAs
place on personal responsibility, an incident at Larkin
House Monday night points out the possible holes in
the sytem.
According to RA David Bohrer, it took five weeks
before he was informed Monday night by security
that it was his responsibility to lock the outside
door with his master key.
Locking the doors "was very irregular; whenever
security made their routine patrol they would lock
our doors if they weren't locked," he said.
"I'm still concerned that something of that impor
tance isn't made clear to us. I would say that we've
been a fairly huge security risk for the past five
weeks," Bohrer said.
Other risk areas
Dorms are not the only security risk on campus.
There are between 70 and 100 security alarms in build
ings around campus, according to Herrington, pro
tecting such things as Wells Fargo Bank, valuable
collections and official documents.
The Medical Center has its own security force.
"A health care institution such as this has a built-in
security risk because it is open 24 hours a day, seven
days a week," said Ryniewicz.
"Health care includes every facet of the security
field. We have a diet department comparable to a
restaurant, patients comparable to hotel guests, a
cashier comparable to a bank and a receiving opera
tion the same as in any industry."
So the Med Center hires more than 20 security

would-be criminals.
