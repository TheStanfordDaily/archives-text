# Sun booths and lamps available
## 'Tanning centers' let all the sun in

San Diego (AP) — As au
tumn's chill pushes the mer
cury down to 70 degrees in
Southern California, a cold fear
has struck the hearts — and
skin — of the suntan set. Fad
ing.
Even as tourists flock to San
Diego's sun-drenched
beaches, the restless natives
are paying $35 each to toast
under sunlamps in two "tan
ning centers" that recently
opened.
More than 1000 "tanning
centers" have sprouted up ac
ross the nation in the past year
— luring Eastern palefaces and
beachless Mideasterners into
"sun booths" where they can
bask under the artificial rays of
a sunlamp.
The new San Diego facilities
have so far attracted some 300
members.
But the latest fad to catch the
fancy of sun-loving Southern
Californians has brought harsh
criticism from dermatologists
who say the centers pose a
health hazard to the people
who spend time under the ul
traviolet lamp rays.
At a recent "Sunlight Sym
posium" in Newport Beach,
dermatologists warned sun
bathers that their chances of
developing skin cancer are

dramatically increased when
they use sunlamps to keep
their tans.
"If you tan in the sun all
summer long, then go into the
tanning boxes in the winter,
there's little doubt you will
eventually get skin cancer as
well as pre-mature wrinkling,
aging and blemishes," said Dr.
loseph Walter.
Walter, an assistant profes
sor of medicine in dermatology
at the University of California
at San Diego, said the lights
used in the tanning centers
"are much more potent than
the sun."
But, he said, "you generally
don't die from skin cancer. It's
just all the scars you get when
they scrape it off."
The managers of the local
sun centers and the people
who patronize them dismiss
notions that such a risk is in
volved.
"Everything causes cancer,"
shrugged one tan-for-dollars
fan.
"A tan is equated with good
health, leisure, wealth — all of
the things that lead to suc
cess,'' explained an insurance
agent who regularly suns
under the lamps. "If you're
white in our society, basically
you're out of it,"he said.

He refused to identify him
self, however, saying he didn't
want anybody to know his tan
wasn't natural.
Managers at the tan salons
say each minute or two under
the sunlamps is equal to an
hour under the sun.
Club members are advised
to visit the tanning booths
every day or two while de
veloping a tan, then return
once or twice a week to pre
serve their tans.
John Ramuno, manager of

Tan Kite, where 16 lightinj
tubes are found in each o
eight booths, said exposure i:
carefully timed.
"We offer a program, not ai
instant tan," he said, addinj
that the system is both faste
and safer than beach tanning
"We monitor how mucl
time each person gets with th»
sunlamps. When people go tc
the beach for a tan, they otter
go out there and cook them
selves," Ramuno said.
"We're being their brain or
the beach."
