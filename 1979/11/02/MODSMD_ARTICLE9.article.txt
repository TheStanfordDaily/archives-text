# Limit on nuclear wastes reduced
## 
### 
Barnwell, S.C. (AP) â€” Nuclear
energy is no bugaboo in
Barnwell County, South
Carolina, where the country's
last operating commercial nuc
lear burial ground is located.
Folks here support nuclear
power. They just don't want to
live in the nation's nuclear
dump.
To that effect, Gov. Dick
Kiley on Wednesday ordered a
50 percent reduction in the
amount of low-level nuclear
waste that may be buried in
South Carolina, a two-year
process to begin immediately.
At a news conference in Col
umbia, S.C., Riley said the
Barnwell site will continue to
accept all low-level nuclear
waste generated in South
Carolina, but will reduce
shipments from other states.
Kiley had foreshadowed the
decision last week, telling re
porters his state would not ab
sorb the waste turned away
from Washington state and
Nevada, whose governors
closed disposal sites there.
A month ago, low-level nuc
lear wastes generated in the
United States were trucked to
just three sites: 15 percent to
the Hanford site near Richland,
Wash.; 5 percent to Beatty,
Nev.; and BO percent to
Barnwell, with more than halt

of that coming from the North
east.
On Oct. 4, Gov. Dixy Lee Kay
closed the Washington dump,
citing unsatisfactory enforce
ment of shipping regulations.
On Oct. 23, Nevada Gov.
Robert List closed the site near
Keno. "I'm just tired ot having
to assume the responsibility
tor having our people take the
risks . . List said.
Kiley said Wednesday he
thought resolution of the prob
lem was essential to continued
nuclear development in the
United States and he hoped his
announcement would spark
national action.
Riley's cutback order sharply
reduces the disposal options
available to hospitals, research
labs and commercial reactors,
which daily create such low
level waste as contaminated
clothing and real tor sludge.
For now, nuclear facilities
are storing waste on site. How
long they can do that "depends
on the type ot waste," said
Louise Dressen ot the LJ.S. I )e
-partment of tnergy. She said
hospitals which use nuclear
equipment for diagnosis and
treatment have only a two-to
three-week storage capacity.
Eighteen states now outlaw
disposal of nuclear waste
within their borders.
