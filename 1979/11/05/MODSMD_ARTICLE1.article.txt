# Voters to decide gov't spending, busing issues
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
California voters will decide the
fates of four constitutional amend
ments on the election ballot tomor
row. Two of those measures, one
against busing and the other against
government spending, are already
expected to win easily.
Although polls predict that 60 to 75
percent of the electorate favors
Proposition 1, which would force
California courts to apply federal
court standards in integration cases,
and Proposition 4, "The Spirit of 13"
initiative designed to cut govern
ment costs by capping states and
local spending, it is not clear whether
either proposal will prove successful
if approved.
In the case of Prop. 1, author State
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys)
says that voter apathy and misin
terpretation might defeat the
amendment.
The anti-busing measure,
launched after court-ordered busing
in Los Angeles signalled the adoption
of broader integration standards
than those used by federal courts,
has only a "60-40 chance" of stop
ping the Los Angeles busing prog
ram, Robbins admitted.
Under federal standards, schools
need only be integrated through bus
ing and other means if segregation
resulted from deliberate and inten
tional action. In 1976, the California
Supreme Court held that racially
segregated schools would have to
take "all reasonable and feasible"
steps toward integration, whether or
not segregation had resulted from
deliberate actions.
Although Prop. 1 would abolish
broader interpretations of the fed
eral integration standard, the 1976
ruling also upheld a lower court find
ing in 1970 that deliberate segrega
tion was being practiced in Los
Angeles. This would make changes
in that city's busing program, now in
its second year, unlikely.
The anti-spending amendment,
written for the most part by Prop. 13
co-author Paul Gann, prohibits local

and state authorities from increasing
spending by more than the rate of
inflation. A proportional adjustment
for population increases is included.
The proposal orders any extra re
venue collected above the set limits
to be returned to taxpayers within
two years.
Opponents of Prop. 4, including
Howard Jarvis, take issue with
Gann's claim that the measure will
save California taxpayers another $6
billion in the next three years, given
the current rate of inflation.
Less controversial have been
Propositions 2 and 3, which will also
appear on the ballot tomorrow.
Prop. 2, proposed by the California
legislature, rejects a 10 percent ceil
ing on commercial loan interest rates
written into state law 45 years ago.
The original 10 percent limit of
1934 did not apply traditional lenders
such as commercial banks, loan
companies, savings associations and
pawn brokers. These businesses
were and still are allowed to charge
according to market demand.
However, mortgage bankers, in
surance companies and pension
funds, restricted by the limit, have
since become major lenders. They
are effectively barred from the
California loan market by the current
limit, much to the dismay of indus
tries here in need of financial capital.
Prop. 2 frees the business loans of
these entities from the limit and
further opens up the market for
financing in California by adding real
estate brokers to the list of exempted
lenders. The measure also grants the
state legislature the right to exempt
others from newly defined, interest
rate regulations.
Prop. 3 is simply a measure de
signed to make the property tax sys
tem more comprehensible to tax
payers. The amendment does not
change the amount of tax paid by
anyone k> the state and is relatively
unopposed.
Current law requires county asses
sors to appraise property at one
quarter of of its full market value by
using a series of complicated
mathematical equations.
Prop. 13, passed 18 months ago,
limited property taxes to 1 percent of
full market value. Prop. 3 would
eliminate the 25 percent assessment
ratioand allow the government to list
(axes as a simple percentage of the
full market value.
The measure further ensures that
veterans' tax exemptions will not be
reduced under the new svstem.
In San Francisco, a separate
amendment, Prop. O has received
attention from Mayor Dianne Feins
tein in her race for reelection against
Supervisor Quentin Kopp, the prop
osition's author.
The proposal would limit new
high-rise buildings to 20 stories or
about 200 feet. In a statement re
leased late Wednesday, Feinstein
said she will vote for the proposal.
"I am persuaded it will not jeopar
dize the city's economy or job oppor
tunities," she said.
Feinstein said she would seek sev
eral modifications of the measure if it
is approved, specifically by a June
ballot amendment to exempt three
high-rise structures already under
way by Crocker Bank, Itel Corp. and
Southern Pacific.

Feinstein's support for Prop. O
came late in the campaign after her
two closest competitors had already
declared their full support for it.

written for the most part by Prop. 13
co-author Paul Gann, prohibits local

and state authorities from increasing
spending by more than the rate of
inflation. A proportional adjustment
for population increases is included.
The proposal orders any extra re
venue collected above the set limits
to be returned to taxpayers within
two years.
Opponents of Prop. 4, including
Howard Jarvis, take issue with
Gann's claim that the measure will
save California taxpayers another $6
billion in the next three years, given
the current rate of inflation.
Less controversial have been
Propositions 2 and 3, which will also
appear on the ballot tomorrow.
Prop. 2, proposed by the California
legislature, rejects a 10 percent ceil
ing on commercial loan interest rates
written into state law 45 years ago.
The original 10 percent limit of
1934 did not apply traditional lenders
such as commercial banks, loan
companies, savings associations and
pawn brokers. These businesses
were and still are allowed to charge
according to market demand.
However, mortgage bankers, in
surance companies and pension
funds, restricted by the limit, have
since become major lenders. They
are effectively barred from the
California loan market by the current
limit, much to the dismay of indus
tries here in need of financial capital.
Prop. 2 frees the business loans of
these entities from the limit and
further opens up the market for
financing in California by adding real
estate brokers to the list of exempted
lenders. The measure also grants the
state legislature the right to exempt
others from newly defined, interest
rate regulations.
Prop. 3 is simply a measure de
signed to make the property tax sys
tem more comprehensible to tax
payers. The amendment does not
change the amount of tax paid by
anyone k> the state and is relatively
unopposed.
Current law requires county asses
sors to appraise property at one
quarter of of its full market value by
using a series of complicated
mathematical equations.
Prop. 13, passed 18 months ago,
limited property taxes to 1 percent of
full market value. Prop. 3 would
eliminate the 25 percent assessment
ratioand allow the government to list
(axes as a simple percentage of the
full market value.
The measure further ensures that
veterans' tax exemptions will not be
reduced under the new svstem.
In San Francisco, a separate
amendment, Prop. O has received
attention from Mayor Dianne Feins
tein in her race for reelection against
Supervisor Quentin Kopp, the prop
osition's author.
The proposal would limit new
high-rise buildings to 20 stories or
about 200 feet. In a statement re
leased late Wednesday, Feinstein
said she will vote for the proposal.
"I am persuaded it will not jeopar
dize the city's economy or job oppor
tunities," she said.
Feinstein said she would seek sev
eral modifications of the measure if it
is approved, specifically by a June
ballot amendment to exempt three
high-rise structures already under
way by Crocker Bank, Itel Corp. and
Southern Pacific.

Feinstein's support for Prop. O
came late in the campaign after her
two closest competitors had already
declared their full support for it.
California voters will decide the
fates of four constitutional amend
ments on the election ballot tomor
row. Two of those measures, one
against busing and the other against
government spending, are already
expected to win easily.
Although polls predict that 60 to 75
percent of the electorate favors
Proposition 1, which would force
California courts to apply federal
court standards in integration cases,
and Proposition 4, "The Spirit of 13"
initiative designed to cut govern
ment costs by capping states and
local spending, it is not clear whether
either proposal will prove successful
if approved.
In the case of Prop. 1, author State
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys)
says that voter apathy and misin
terpretation might defeat the
amendment.
The anti-busing measure,
launched after court-ordered busing
in Los Angeles signalled the adoption
of broader integration standards
than those used by federal courts,
has only a "60-40 chance" of stop
ping the Los Angeles busing prog
ram, Robbins admitted.
Under federal standards, schools
need only be integrated through bus
ing and other means if segregation
resulted from deliberate and inten
tional action. In 1976, the California
Supreme Court held that racially
segregated schools would have to
take "all reasonable and feasible"
steps toward integration, whether or
not segregation had resulted from
deliberate actions.
Although Prop. 1 would abolish
broader interpretations of the fed
eral integration standard, the 1976
ruling also upheld a lower court find
ing in 1970 that deliberate segrega
tion was being practiced in Los
Angeles. This would make changes
in that city's busing program, now in
its second year, unlikely.
