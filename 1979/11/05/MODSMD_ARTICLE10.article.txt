# Post correspondent sees conservative upswing
## U.S. African policy 'losing initiative' 
### Susan Essoyan 
The resignation of U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young last
August symbolized the end of
America's activist policy in
Southern Africa, Washington
Post correspondent David At
taway told a group of 40 in the
Meyer Forum Room Tuesday
night.
Lack of concrete results from
Young's initiatives in Southern
Alrica and renewed administ
ration concern over the Soviet
Union has pushed the United
States back to Kissinger-style
diplomacy, Attaway said.
Kissinger dealt with Africa
solely in terms of superpower
interests and was unpopular
among Africans, he said. Atta
way expressed concern over
"slipping back" to that policy
as it undermines U.S. credibil
ity in Africa that President
jimmy Carter and Young have
established.
Attaway has covered the
Rhodesian conflict from his
post in Lusaka, Zambia, since
Carter took office and also
served as the Post's African
correspondent while Henry
Kissinger was secretary of
state.
"Kissinger was the symbol of
the way they (Africans) did not
want the West to look at Africa
. . . as a pawn in the East-West
struggle," he said.
U.S. policy avowedly prom
otes social and economic de
velopment in Africa, but Atta
way called present LJ.S. de
velopment efforts "insignific
ant."
'Conservative upswing'
Instead, he said the recent
moves to sell arms to Morocco
and a Congressional vote to lift
sanctions against Zimbabwe
express a "conservative upsw
ing" in policy. Carter has
shifted with this conservative
tide because Young's ap
proach "didn't really pay off,"
Attaway said.
When Carter took office, he
and Young concentrated on
three issues, Namibia (south

west Africa), Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia and South Africa it
self, Attaway said.
It was "the first time an ad
ministration began its term
with a grand design for Africa,"
Attaway said. Carter and
Young, with "naivete and mis
sionary zeal," attacked the
three issues simultaneously
but "ran up against a stone wall
on all three," he said.
Attaway questioned their as
sumption that it is possible to
have a peaceful settlement. In
each case, he said, Americans
"thought that somehow it was
possible to take these diamet
rically opposed groups, put
them together in a room and
get them ... to convert the
whole shooting war into a
democratic process."
Complex problems
Attaway said that such an ap
proach ignores the complexity
of the problems and added, "I
wonder whether a settlement
that neither side really agrees
upon but is forced into is wise
or preferable to fighting it
out."
In any event, the situation in
each case is now "out of our
hands," he said.
In Namibia, Americans
negotiated with the South Afri
can government to define an
internationally acceptable sol
ution for Namibia, including
full black participation in the
political process, Attaway said.
The. United Nations in 1966 de
clared an end to South Africa's
mandate over Namibia and
does not recognize South Afri
can administration of the area.
South Africa, however, has
said it will go ahead with its
own elections and in the mean
time the United States has
turned over the initiative to a
British diplomat, Attaway said.
In Rhodesia, the United
States tried to produce prop
osals acceptable to both the
Patriotic Front (nationalist
guerrillas) and the Salisbury
government. But Salisbury
never accepted the Anglo-

American proposals and pro
ceeded instead with its own
elections. The British are pre
sently negotiating with both
parties.
Verbal attacks
In South Africa, the United
States continued verbal attacks
on discrimination and sup
ported the U.N. embargo on
arms sales to that country. But
the administration has em
phasized that an arms embargo
was "as far as we were going to
go," Attaway said, enabling
South Africa to call the West
ern bluff.
Reforms enacted in South
Africa under Prime Minister
Pieter Botha, including legaliz
ing black trade unions, have
caused major change in U.S.

policy, according to Attaway.
"The United States is think
ing more in terms of the carrots
it might offer South Africa
rather than the sticks it might
wield" to induce change, he
said.
"If they (South Africans) are
perceived to be making re
forms, I don't see how we can
turn our back on them," he
said. He added he saw little al
ternative to U.S. policy in
Southern Africa, given political
constraints, but said he felt the
United States could deal more
effectively with South Africa.
Attaway and his wife are in
the United States on leave from
the Post, working on a forth
coming book on Afrocom
munism.

each case, he said, Americans
"thought that somehow it was
possible to take these diamet
rically opposed groups, put
them together in a room and
get them ... to convert the
whole shooting war into a
democratic process."
Complex problems
Attaway said that such an ap
proach ignores the complexity
of the problems and added, "I
wonder whether a settlement
that neither side really agrees
upon but is forced into is wise
or preferable to fighting it
out."
In any event, the situation in
each case is now "out of our
hands," he said.
In Namibia, Americans
negotiated with the South Afri
can government to define an
internationally acceptable sol
ution for Namibia, including
full black participation in the
political process, Attaway said.
The. United Nations in 1966 de
clared an end to South Africa's
mandate over Namibia and
does not recognize South Afri
can administration of the area.
South Africa, however, has
said it will go ahead with its
own elections and in the mean
time the United States has
turned over the initiative to a
British diplomat, Attaway said.
In Rhodesia, the United
States tried to produce prop
osals acceptable to both the
Patriotic Front (nationalist
guerrillas) and the Salisbury
government. But Salisbury
never accepted the Anglo-

American proposals and pro
ceeded instead with its own
elections. The British are pre
sently negotiating with both
parties.
Verbal attacks
In South Africa, the United
States continued verbal attacks
on discrimination and sup
ported the U.N. embargo on
arms sales to that country. But
the administration has em
phasized that an arms embargo
was "as far as we were going to
go," Attaway said, enabling
South Africa to call the West
ern bluff.
Reforms enacted in South
Africa under Prime Minister
Pieter Botha, including legaliz
ing black trade unions, have
caused major change in U.S.

policy, according to Attaway.
"The United States is think
ing more in terms of the carrots
it might offer South Africa
rather than the sticks it might
wield" to induce change, he
said.
"If they (South Africans) are
perceived to be making re
forms, I don't see how we can
turn our back on them," he
said. He added he saw little al
ternative to U.S. policy in
Southern Africa, given political
constraints, but said he felt the
United States could deal more
effectively with South Africa.

The resignation of U.N. Am
bassador Andrew Young last
August symbolized the end of
America's activist policy in
Southern Africa, Washington
Post correspondent David At
taway told a group of 40 in the
Meyer Forum Room Tuesday
night.
Lack of concrete results from
Young's initiatives in Southern
Alrica and renewed administ
ration concern over the Soviet
Union has pushed the United
States back to Kissinger-style
diplomacy, Attaway said.
Kissinger dealt with Africa
solely in terms of superpower
interests and was unpopular
among Africans, he said. Atta
way expressed concern over
"slipping back" to that policy
as it undermines U.S. credibil
ity in Africa that President
jimmy Carter and Young have
established.
Attaway has covered the
Rhodesian conflict from his
post in Lusaka, Zambia, since
Carter took office and also
served as the Post's African
correspondent while Henry
Kissinger was secretary of
state.
"Kissinger was the symbol of
the way they (Africans) did not
want the West to look at Africa
. . . as a pawn in the East-West
struggle," he said.
U.S. policy avowedly prom
otes social and economic de
velopment in Africa, but Atta
way called present LJ.S. de
velopment efforts "insignific
ant."
'Conservative upswing'
Instead, he said the recent
moves to sell arms to Morocco
and a Congressional vote to lift
sanctions against Zimbabwe
express a "conservative upsw
ing" in policy. Carter has
shifted with this conservative
tide because Young's ap
proach "didn't really pay off,"
Attaway said.
When Carter took office, he
and Young concentrated on
three issues, Namibia (south

west Africa), Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia and South Africa it
self, Attaway said.
It was "the first time an ad
ministration began its term
with a grand design for Africa,"
Attaway said. Carter and
Young, with "naivete and mis
sionary zeal," attacked the
three issues simultaneously
but "ran up against a stone wall
on all three," he said.
Attaway questioned their as
sumption that it is possible to
have a peaceful settlement. In
each case, he said, Americans
"thought that somehow it was
possible to take these diamet
rically opposed groups, put
them together in a room and
