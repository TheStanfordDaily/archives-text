# Quebec separatists offer self-rule plan

Quebec (AP) — The
separatist government of
Quebec province called
Thursday on French-Canadians
to "come to terms with our de
stiny," withdraw from the
Canadian confederation and
establish a new nation with all
the powers of a sovereign
country.
In an official "white paper,"
the Parti Quebecois govern
ment proposed a
"sovereignty-association" plan
by which Quebec would be
self-ruling but maintain close
economic ties with Canada — a
common currency, free trade

and the free movement of
people and capital.
"We Quebecers are a na
tion, the most firmly anchored
nation on this continent," pro
vincial. Premier Rene Levesque
declared in the closing state
ment.
The long-awaited document
presents the Parti Quebecois
platform for a provincewide re
ferendum on the issue
scheduled for next May or
June. Party leaders have out
lined the sovereignty
association scheme previ
ously, but the white paper is
the most formal and complete
statement of the plan thus far.
In the referendum, Quebec
voters are not expected to be
asked whether they want such
a form of independence, but
whether they authorize the
Levesque government to
negotiate sovereignty
association with the federal
government in Ottawa.
In a public-opinion poll last
summer, 54 percent of the
Quebecers surveyed said they
would vote "yes" to authorize
negotiations, and 30 percent
said they would vote "no."
But the same poll showed 37
percent of the voters favored
sovereignty-association and 42
percent opposed it.
There was no immediate
comment on the white paper
from the federal government
of Prime Minister Joe Clark.
Levesque's Parti Quebecois,
which came to power in elec
tions three years ago, has long
supported secession from the
112-year-old Canadian confed
eration.
