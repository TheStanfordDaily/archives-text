# Energy needs may prompt more Soviet activity in Middle East
## 
### Katy Lawrence 
Increasing energy consumption and limited
energy sources will probably lead to increased
political and military activity by the Soviet Union
and Eastern European nations in oil rich areas,
according to Werner Gumpel, professor of
economics and director of the Institute for East
ern and Southeast European Economic Studies
at the University of Munich.
In a study titled, Energy Policy of the Soviet
Union, published by the Hoover Institution
here, Gumpel states that the Soviet Union's fu
ture energy needs depend on the development
of a broader base for fuel production by exploit
ing new reserves. Should the energy situation in
the Soviet Union worsen in the next few years,
the Soviets will attempt to increase their political
influence in the Middle East by delivering arms
to Arab states in exchange for oil, he said.
"This is the case in Afghanistan, from which
the Soviet Union receives four billion cubic
meters of gas a year, and it is also the case in
Iran, where the Soviet Union uses, supports and
promotes the revolutionary situation for its own
political and economic purposes," Gumpel
notes.
Although the Soviet Union is currently the
largest producer of oil in the world, the Soviets
have difficulties in exploiting new reserves,
many of which are inconveniently located. The

nation's extensive high-quality reserves lie in
areas removed from existing transport lines and
communications, and in inhospitable climate
and terrain, Cumpel said. Oil fields currently in
use are being rapidly depleted.
Expanding industry
Expanding industry places a strain on Soviet
energy supplies, Cumpel said. Electricity con
sumption has been particularly high because of
Soviet policies of modernization and rationali
zation in industry to increase international
competitiveness.
Individual consumption of energy, although
low by Western standards, has also shown an
upward trend, and will steadily increase as
women join the labor force and rely upon
labor-saving electrical appliances, he added.
Growing numbers of privately owned motor
vehicles, construction of residential accommo
dations, and a general demand for consumer
goods will also add to Soviet energy needs.
The Soviet Union also serves as a supplier of
oil and natural gas to the Comecon countries.
"To secure adherence to its leadership,"
Gumpel asserts, "it desires to remain the prim
ary supplier." Comecon nations find this ar
rangement to their advantage, since they need
not pay their energy costs in terms of hard cur
rency, but rather in machinery and industrial
goods, he added.
