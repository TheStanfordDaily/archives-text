# Student rooms: what makes a home away from home
## 
### Eleanor Meltzer Pam Mollohan 
Home is where the hat is.
And the dirty underwear. And
the dying philodendron. And
your roommate's scuzzy
friends.
But seriously, what is it like
to live in a home away from
home? The answers range from
"fantastic" to '/Â»-<&!!".
Except for the trailers, most
rooms in University housing
are constructed in a conven
tional, rectangular form. Stan
dard equipment includes
beds, closets, lights and desks;
the variety stems chiefly from
the number of inhabitants and
the decor of each den. Lofts,
posters and rugs provide a
break from the monotony of
cell-type architecture.
Asked to say the one word
which describes their room,
three Brannerites replied with,
"Mellow/kinky/laid back!"
(It's a triple room, re
member?). Two Arroyo House
residents retorted with an off
the-wall comment, "Ar
tichokes!"
Comparing present rooms
with ones left behind, spastic
laughter was a common reply.
A Branner housing associate
(RA) explained, "My room at
home is all antiques. It's not at
all as messy as this place is."
The question reminded many
people of things they would
like to bring from home. The
list included girlfriends, pets,
psychedelic curtains, stereos,
jacuzzis and privacy.

Most people felt that the lo
cation of their rooms, as well as
the interiors, was an important
consideration. The consensus
seemed to be that coed dorms
generally had the healthiest
atmosphere.
"You lose any idealized con
ceptions of the opposite sex
real fast around here, espe
cially when you see them at six
in the morning," commented
another Brannerite.
While most people rated
their rooms highly, further im
provements were still forth
coming. One enterprising
bunch (bio and art majors)
proposed to tunnel into the
girls' room next door. Tapes
tries, lasers and kayaks were
other planned additions in
other dorms.
Finally, though most resi-

dents said they loved, or at
least tolerated, their rooms
and roomies, few people were
able to do intensive studying
in the rooms. Reasons given
ranged from "noisy room
mates" to "I can't find my desk
in all this mess!" One outspo
ken individual went as far as to
claim, "My roommate's mas
sage business makes it very dif
ficult to concentrate on Econ
1."
From penthouses with un
obstructed views of Hoover
Tower, to dark, putrid pits,
every room seems to have its
own character. However,
whether the atmosphere is
"collegiate," "radical," or
"moderately mellow," without
exception it is the people in the
rooms who really make them
home.
