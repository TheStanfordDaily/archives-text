## Med scores show high skill

This column is written not to
challenge the accuracy but to
correct the thrust ol the article
on Stanford Medical School
student performance on the
National Hoard examinations
this year. (Daily, O c t. 24,1979).
1 he impression the reader is
left with is that Stanford stu
dent performance improved
over last year but the article
(ails to emphasize the excel
lence of Sttfhford student per
formance in relationship to
students across the country.
• rr,idii'onally, Stanford stu
dent porlc mance has been at
the very highest level nation
ally. When the National Board
of Medical I \aminers reported
school standings in relation
ship to on'> mother, Stanford
was alwa\s ranked imong the
top foui hools (Stanford rank
1971 — second; 1972 first;

1973 — fourth; 1975 — first).
School ranking was discon
tinued by the National Board of
Medical Examiners in 1976
while I was serving as its Presi
dent and Director. My know
ledge ot data from the National
Board of Medical Examiners
leads me to conclude that Stan
ford student performance on
the Part I examination this year
would return Stanford to a very
high level by comparison with
schools nationally. The mean
score achieved by Stanford
students (554) is above that in
1974 (538) when Stanford
ranked fourth of 80 schools in
the country.
The pass rate set by the Na
tional Board of Medical
Examiners for its purpose of
certification for diplomate
status is set at a high level. For
all U.S. and Canadian students

taking the Part I examination in
1979 the fail rate was 16.4 per
cent (16,700 examinees). There
were only two Stanford stu
dents who failed the 1979
examinations.
The high level of overall per
formance of Stanford students
and the low failure rate of the
National Board's high stan
dards prompts this observer to
congratulate the students for
their voluntary effort.
When our students do their
best — they are the best, not
only in their performance on
objective examinations but in
scholarship, research, and pro
fessional interpersonal skills.
That is the impression I would
hope to see the Daily report
— because it's true.

Holman Professor of Surgery at
