Racist ride
You wore t.iken tor a racist
ride on "Midnight Express," if
you happened to go to the
Sunday llivk last night Fhe
furl at Stanford want you to
know how the American press
felt about the movie:
—"Despite all the advance
hype, "Midnight Express" is
•one of the year's most un
pleasant and dishonest
movies. It wallows in brutality
. . . "(New Wi:st Magazine)
" 'Midnight Express' is suf
fused with strident anti
rnrkish sentiments The film
insists over and over again that
Turks are duly and inferior.
Sexually p<i verse and morally
corrupt On trial, tears stream
ing down his handsome, all
Amerit an face, Hayes calls the
Turks 'A nation of pigs.' The
movie is a rat ist screen from
beginning to end ' (David
Rosenbaum, film critic,
ftov'o blerald American)
— " . , seriously weakened
by its slur-, on the Turkish na
tion.'' (lilm & Broach Re
view )
'That the Turks should
find thi• film an extended slur
does not surprise me."
(Thomas Dowling, Washington
btar)
—"A thoroughly repulsive
movie." <Time magazine)
—"Guano" Stan lot d Daily)
One wonders what criteria
ASSU Sunday Flicks manage
ment uses in selecting movies.
We just hope that anti-racist at
titude applies not only to those
nations who have an ethnic
grouf) in the United States, but
to every human race on the
earth.
We, the Stanford Turkish
Student Asso iatioil, strongly

protest the judgment of Sun
day Flicks management.

Mixed housing?
The other day I sat down to
lunch in my eating club next to
a graduate student also in the
club. Our conversation
touched on many subjects of
interest until finally we come to
dwell on housing.
I he question that intrigues
us most was why graduates and
undergraduates are segre
gated in campus housing?
Here at the eating club we have
a great time and from my per
sonal view point, the exposure
the club gives me to graduate
students is one of its greatest
assets.
My lunch companion too felt
that he really enjoyed the club,
largely because it gave him the
opportunity to meet and get to
know undergraduates.
I recalled a conversation I
had had just the day before
with an undergrad friend who
is living in Crothers. She says
she loves it and that living with
the grads is wonderful.
Naturally the majority of
grads and undergrads cannot
be expected to want to live to
gether. There are differences
in age, maturity, academic in
terest and other interests in
general.
However, the conclusion we
came to was that there really
should be some form of mixed
Grad-Undergrad housing av
ailable for those who think that
they might like it.
Perhaps one or two dorms,
or some of the row houses. I
am interested to know how
others feel on this matter, and

whether or not there is any
support for this idea.

The solution
I've been waiting for a consen
sus to emerge, but still no mas
cot. Jeff Dangl's column sup
porting the Alumni as the mas
cot (Daily, Oct. 22) was the last
straw. Now you must suffer my
long withheld suggestion: the
Stanford Students.
)ust imagine Sunday and
Monday morning newspaper
headlines — "Stanford Out
smarts Gridiron Foe" or "Stan
ford Students Study For Next
Battle" followed by lead-in
sentence — "Under pressure,
Stanford Students pass field
examination with flying col
ors."
Stanford is proud of its repu
tation for academic quality and
achievement. In fact, many of
our star athletes claim that
their decision to attend Stan
ford\vas based on the overall
combination of excellence in
sports and academics.
The Band could abandon any
last-ditch attempt at wearing
uniforms since they would
merely have to look like Stu
dents (Is that possible?).
The Dollies could either go
formal in cap and gown or in
formal in the latest Student
fashions.
And last but not least, for
those who wish to maintain a
spirit of controversy, one
could imagine an appropriate
abbreviation for this new
found mascot: the Stanford
Studs.
