## Short people get the short end of the stick 
### 
The IXnly has done it again! Only a
few weeks after absorbing massive
criticism for acceptance of the Dos
Equis advertising which offended large
segments of the community with its
blatantly sexist treatment of women,
you have allowed another purveyor of
intoxicants, one that we now learn will
not cause cancer in boll weevils, to in
sult an even larger portion of the popu
lation, namely short people.
I refer of course to the full page
Coors ad of Friday, Oct. 26, which con
sisted mainly of tasteless jokes
speculating on "What it Napoleon had
been taller?' Why is being short a prob
lem? Why is it something Coors feels
safe joking about?

This is the second time in several
years that I have had to call to the Dai
ly's attention your casual oppression,
your tolerance for the tragic sufferings,
the unnoticed indignities, and the sys
tematic discrimination against short
people.
Would you have been so insensitive
as to have accepted an ad which read,
What if Martin Luther King had been
white'' or "What if Gloria Steinem
were a man?" and then proceeded to
poke fun at their contributions to his
tory.
After all, most of the great leaders of
history: King Tut, Charlemagne, Gen
ghis Kha, as well as Napoleon, have
been short. We deserve some re
spect! But short people are OK to kid

about; we live in an openly heightist
society, where height is admired and
rewarded. Short people today are not
organized, and we can't reach up to
punch you in the nose when we're mad
(but we can kick).
But we do buy beer just like you tall
folks, and if Coors wants to extol its
"High Country" product, I can go out
and urge you all to buy "Death Valley
Beer," which is brewed by dwarfs
below sea level and is made from sea
water.
The hidden discrimination we suffer
from is the worst kind because it is un
recognized and rarely talked about.
More of you are short than realize it;
you've probably been kidding yourself
all along that you're pretty tall or tall

enough, but maybe you're really short.
If you're not Fred Hargadon or Tom
Schmalzried (both good friends of
mine), you probably spend some time
each day looking up at people, reach
ing up for doorknobs, standing tiptoe
for misplaced lavatories (men only),
looking for shirts where the sleeves
don't have to be altered.
If the ethnic groups, the workers,
and now the office staff can organize,
so can we.
Short people of the world, unite. You
have nothing to lose but your elevator
shoes!
