# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mildred Nilsson Clerical workers shouldn't complain

I should like to give a better
balanced picture of the situa
tion with regard to the prop
osed unionization of the cleri
cal staff.
A lot of the clerical staff are
wives of students who defi
nitely would not want to join a
bargaining unit and pay
monthly dues out of an already
stringent budget because their
tenure is determined solely by
the length of time it takes their
spouses to complete their
studies.
In a presentation for unioni
zation recently, the case of
sexual harassment in an office
was mentioned as a reason for
organizing. No organization
will prevent sexual harass
ment! As individuals we have
the right to say "No" no matter
whether it be on a date or in the
office.
If such harassment does
occur there is always someone
within the department to ap
peal to and who will be sym
pathetic. This is no new prob

lem in offices and it can be
dealt with very effectively.
The amount of funds availa
ble for salaries and wages and
the day-to-day operational
costs of each department is the
yardstick for determining the
number and kinds of person
nel in a department, and to a
degree the annual percentage
increase in salaries.
A lot of clerical workers may
not realize that research con
tracts are responsible for pro
viding salaries regardless of the
department they are in. Prom
otions are restricted by the or
ganization of the department
in which a clerical worker is
employed. The statement that
Stanford's clerical salaries "are
considerably lower than
salaries elsewhere" is errone
ous.
After being employed for 17
years at Stanford, my position
was terminated this summer
because our research sponsor
failed to renew our research
contracts. In addition to sub

mitting my resume to other
departments where vacancies
existed, I consulted the job
files at the State Employment
Agency and other outside list
ings. There was no salary to
match mine here at Stanford
for comparable positions so I
don't believe the organizers
have done their homework.
We work at Stanford be
cause we choose to. No one
assigned us to work here
whether we wanted to or not
(see Daily of Sept. 24, 1979 for
working conditions in China).
The option is still ours to
choose where we want to work
and what we want to do. Dissi
dents should look for higher
paying jobs and better working
conditions, if they can find
them, in a profit-making or
ganization or retrain to do
something else which provides
a higher remuneration.
The spiralingcost of living af
fects each and every one of us
from the university's president
down to the lowliest worker.

Single parents do have a tough
time but all the ones I come in
contact with are doing a
reasonably good job without
moonlighting.
I don't know of any who are
eating dog or cat food, as
stated in a recent speech I
heard on clerical organization.
But I have heard of an
employee making a perfectly
respectable salary fraudulently
obtaining public funds in order
to purchase a Mercedes!
Stanford has now provided a
Dental Plan to be implemented
in 1980. This benefit is most de
sirable, especially for staff
members with growing chil
dren. The Retirement Plan for
non-exempt employees could
be improved upon.
But what other corporation
or institution provides for the
education of the children of its
staff to the extent Stanford
does?
(Mildred Nilsson is an 18-year
employee in Industrial En
gineering.)
