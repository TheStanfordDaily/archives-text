## Pro-abortionists dread abortion, too 
### 
I write in response specifi
cally to Gerard Rebagliati's
column "I Don't Want to Pay
for Your Abortion" (Daily, Oct.
25) and generally to anybody
with anti-pro-choice senti
ments. I won't rehash the
philosophical arguments; I do
want to make three points
which have not been em
phasized in previous pro

choice articles and which need
to be recognized by everyone.
Rebagliati asserts that govern
ment funding for abortion,
while indulging the choice of
pregnant women, flouts the
choice of the U.S. citizens who
may not want their tax dollars
used to support what they con
sider murder.
Well, the same U.S. citizen's
taxes are presently supporting
Charles Manson, paying for his
food, lodging, and medical
care, along with that of count
less other convicted burglars,
rapists, arsonists, kidnappers
and murderers.
Moreover, even crime vic
tims themselves, without
choice, support their own
malefactors: they hardly have
the option to retain that minute
percentage of their taxes which
help pay for the meals of the
man who raped or robbed
them.
Nor am I implying that they
should have that option. Soci
ety has a responsibility to all its
members, even those who
transgress its laws and moral
codes. To give citizens such a
choice (i.e., to allow them to
withhold their tax dollars if
they did not approve of how
the government spent them)
would be a step backwards a
century or two, to an age when
virtually all financial support
for the poor, the disabled, the
infirm, the insane, as well as
the criminal, camefrom private

charity — what little there was.
The conditions for anyone in
those categories were deplor
able. Clearly, there are times
when a decision affecting the
general quality of life in a soci
ety overrides the personal pre
ferences of some individuals.
How do freely available
abortions improve the quality
of life for anyone besides the
woman? This leads to my sec
ond point. Unwanted and dep
rived children, and their ef
fects upon society, have been
discussed before. Instead, I'll
deal with the position of the
man in the abortion question,
which Rebagliati accuses the
pro-choice movement of ig
noring. I think there is some
thing Rebagliati is ignoring. . .
I challenge every male —
every potential father — to
consider very seriously the fol
lowing: Suppose you sleep
with a woman, and although
you are both scrupulously
careful about using birth- con
trol, she gets pregnant anyway.
(That does happen. No con
traceptive is 100 percent safe.)

Would you be willing to de
vote the next 20 years of your
life to raising that child? Alone,
if you had to?
Now imagine the same thing
happening to you as a junior in
high school. Are you still wil
ling?
Of course, this does not de
pict the types of situations
which most often result in
abortions. My point, however,
is implicit.
Finally, in general response
to all those who anticipate that
free abortions will promote
sexual irresponsibility and be
come an alternative method of
birth control — be realistic. No
woman wants to go through an
abortion!
Any method of contracep
tion — including celibacy — is
more desirable to a woman
than abortion. Having an abor
tion causes the woman physi
cal pain, shame and — even for
the most passionate pro
abortionist — a deep stab of
moral agony.
