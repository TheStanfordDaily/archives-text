# Alliances shift in Vietnam

Difficulty in separating the "good guys from
the bad guys" blocks understanding of the
forces in Indochina today, according to John
Spragens, co-director of Berkeley's Southeast
Asia Research Center.
Spragens, a former freelance journalist anc
translator who has followed the situation in In
dochina for over 14 years, spoke to approxi
mately 75 people gathered at a Bechtel Interna
tional Center luncheon last week.
His one-hour presentation entitled, "Viet
nam, China and the United States: Shifting Is
sues on an Old Battleground," focused on the
changing role of each of the countries played in
Vietnam since 1972 when former President
Richard Nixon declared "There can be no vac
uums in Indochina."
Alliances among the countries have shifted
greatly since 1972. Spragens recalled former
Chairman MaoTse-tung's statement that "China
and Vietnam are as close as lips and teeth,"
made in 1974. But China's incursion into Viet
nam earlier this year spurred by Vietnam's 1978
aggression into Cambodia clearly invalidated
Mao's analogy, Spragens said.
United States switches roles
Similarly, during the Cultural Revolution,
China considered both the United States and
the Soviet Union enemies, Spragens continued.
But now the United States and China have re
sumed "friendly relations." Trade relations are
expanding and both nations have professed a
common mistrust of the Soviets, he said.
Spragens criticized U.S. interference in Viet
nam since the end of the Vietnam War, saying
American policy has made things "as difficult as
possible short of intervention" in the country.
Americans guilty
He blamed the United States in part for Chi
na's incursion into Vietnam following the visit of
Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping to the Un
ited States last year.
"U.S. involvement in an alliance with China

has added to the pressures of the war between
Vietnam and China," he said. "If the United
States had normalized trade and diplomatic rela
tions with both China and Vietnam simultane
ously, the conflict might have been avoided,"
he added.
When questioned on the likelihood of
another Chinese invasion into Vietnam, Spra
gens outlined the positions of each country. He
said the Vietnamese are predicting another attack
and that the Chinese are "talking about the pos
sibility of teaching Vietnam a second lesson."
Another attack unlikely
The United States, however, does not foresee
another attack because of the expense it poses
to China.
Spragens expressed concern over what he
termed a growing "paranoia" among Viet
namese. "They seem to be seeing Chinese be
hind every door," he said.
Spragens also discussed the black market
networks operating in Southeast Asia, the
American gesture of reparation toward re
building Vietnam after the war, and food shor
tages and overpopulation problems currently
plaguing Vietnam.
Cruelty relative
In response to a question concerning human
rights violations in Vietnam, Spragens said that
"cruelty is related to people's backgrounds."
Apparently many formerly wealthy Vietnamese
have been forced to comply with food rationing
and perform manual labor under the Com
munist regime, he said. Some consider this
cruelty because they had been used to higher
living and fine food, Spragens said.
Spragens also maligned American press
coverage of Indochina. During the Vietnam
War, he said, "Vietnam was the city of Saigon."
Now, he added, the press focuses almost exclu
sively on the boat people fleeing Vietnam.
"While the boat people have real problems,
there are 55 million people within Vietnam with
real problems also," he said.
