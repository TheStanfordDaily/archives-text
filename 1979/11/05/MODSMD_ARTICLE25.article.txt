# Stanford as right as rain in soggy 28-21 victory

As plain as the Goodyear blimp aloft
in the leaden skies, the two plays that
propelled Stanford to a 28-21 Pacific-10
Conference football victory Saturday
over Arizona State stood out in their
prominence.
The exciting triumph, witnessed by
30,885 Stanford Stadium rain
worshippers, a nationwide television
audience and representatives from the
Fiesta and Peach bowls, kept the 5-3-1
Cardinals' bowl hopes hovering like a
dirigible, low but at least off the
ground.
"People are looking for us — we're
an attractive team," Card split end
Andre Tyler said.
A major reason why Stanford attracts
bowl officials is its ability to unleash the
big play — the leopard couched in the
underbrush that springs without warn
ing, quickly and fatally.
One such play came after Arizona
State's Willie Cittens had returned Ken
Naber's punt 44 yards to Stanford's
9-yard-line with over ten-and-one-half
minutes left in the game. Tied with the
Cards 21-21, the Sun Devils had an al
most sure shot at taking the lead.
Evans close* the door
Almost. On third-and-goal from the 3,
Sun Devil quarterback Mark Malone
rolled left and was totaled by Card de
fensive tackle Chuck Evans. Evans' hit
forced the ball loose, and linebacker
Kevin Bates recovered the fumble on
the ten.
Evans called this play the greatest of
his career. "It came at a crucial time. I
can't think of one I enjoy more," he
said.
The other big play occurred mo
ments later, with Stanford facing an un
eviable third-and-14 from its 6.
Quarterback Turk Schonert, trying to
create another gem with his

conference-leading passing craftsman
ship, dropped back into the end zone
and was chased by linebacker Gary Pad
jen.
Schonert barely eluded the pawing
Padjen and Jiurled one down the
sideline to a streaking Ken Margerum.
The nonpareil receiver made the catch
in full stride and ran to the Sun Devil 48
to complete a 46-yard pass play.,
'The guy just bit'
Margerum was running a "deep out"
pattern before the secondary's cover
age and Padjen's pursuit of Schonert
told him to break deep.
"The guy just bit on it," Margerum
said of his defender, adding later, "The
deep safety just wasn't deep enough,
and I knew I was going to be open."
Margerum again made a remarkable
catch on another third-down play, this
time diving to his right to snare
Schonert's pass for 25 yards and a first
and-goal at the Sun Devil 9.
Schonert wasted no time in securing
the winning points for Stanford, as he
hit halfback Mike Dotterer on a curl
pattern with 5:48 left to cap a 90-yard,
eight play march.
Twice in the closing minutes Arizona
State began driving threateningly
downfield, but each time the Cards
pacified the Sun Devils with intercep
tions by Kevin MacMillan and Keith
Burcham.
The interceptions climaxed Stan
ford's outstanding second-half defen
sive effort. After yielding 21 points and
263 yards in the first half, the Cards shut
out Arizona State and gave up just 137
yards after intermission.
"I have a tremendous feeling for our
defense. It really came to the forefront
today," Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower said, looking like he had
just swum across the English Channel.
"The pass defense was excellent — our

defenders rallied to the ball well."
Schonert outstanding
Schonert, for his part, rallied to ev
erything well. The fifth-year senior hit
on 13 of 18 passes for 271 yards and
three touchdowns and won ABC's Stan
ford Player of the Game honors.
"I guess you would have to say now
he's a pretty good quarterback,"
Dowhower said in a clear understate
ment.
Arizona State momentarily stopped
Schonert and the Card offense on their
first two series, meanwhile taking a 3-0
lead on barefooted kicker Scott Lewis'
31-yard field goal.
Then Dowhower pulled out his re
cipe for instant touchdowns, consisting
of strong arms, sure hands and healthy
legs.
After Joe St. Geme returned Mike
Black's punt 19 yards to the Card 42, it
took Stanford just one play to erase the
Sun Devils' lead.
On a truly awesome play, Schonert
connected with Margerum on a 58-yard
scoring bomb with 5:08 left in the first
quarter.
Margerum, who gained 129 yards on
just three receptions, made the catch
around Arizona State's 20, cut to the left
and surged into the end zone behind
Tyler's fine block at the 10.
Upon regaining possession, Stanford
took only two minutes and 40 seconds
to tally its next touchdown and take a
14-3 lead.
Schonert's passes of 14 and 32 yards
to Tyler were the key plays that brought
Stanford to Arizona State's 9.
From there, freshman fullback Greg
Hooper churned into the end zone
through the right side of the Sun Devil
defense, high-stepping the last few
yards.
ASU roars back
This, however, was Stanford's last

opportunity to kick its heels together
until thethird quarter, as the Sun De\<sls
roared back with 18 second-quarter
points.
)ohn Elway, substituting at quarter
back according to Dowhower's plaris,
scrambled wildly and fired a long but
ill-advised pass that safety Don Hen
dricks intercepted and returned ,to
Stanford's 46.
Robert Weathers' 23-yard gain afid
Malone's 14-yard keeper put Arizona
State on Stanford's 9. Weat ers ripped
up the middle into the end zone on tfSe
next play, and Malone's conversion
pass to Bernard Henry reduced Stan
ford's lead to 14-11.
Unable to generate any offense, the
Cards had to punt. Naber got off his
worst kick of the day — a 32-yarder—
which gave the Sun Devils good field
position and set up Lewis' tying 32-yard
field goal.
After Stanford stalled again, Naber
made, in terms of distance, his best
punt. The Cincinnati n ve hit a 64-
yarder, aided by a good bounce, that
forced Arizona State to start from its 6.
But on a 94-yard, 13-play drive pro
longed by Wayne Apuna's 10-yard run
on fourth down from punt formation,
the Sun Devils took a 21-14 lead on Ar
thur Lane's 4-yard run and Lewis' con
version kick.
The Cards responded early in the
third quarter with a long 92-yard drive
of their own to re-tie the score.
Tyler's 22-yard catch, Arizona State's
15-yard personal foul penalty and
Hooper's 13-yard burst each gained
first downs for the Cards and sent them
into Arizona State territory.
On second-and-eight from the Sun
Devil 20, Schonert rolled right, stopped
just short of the line of scrimmage and
floated the ball to Tyler, who cradled it
for six points.
