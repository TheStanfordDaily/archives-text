# Jackson's world not as simple as ABC
## 'Anyone who doesn't believe college athletics is a business is a damn fool' 
### 
He is the television jour
nalist most identified with
college football. He is a vet
eran of over 20 years of
broadcasting and has won a
great many awards for his
work as play-by-play for
ABC-TV Sports. He was re
tently profiled in Sports Il
lustrated.
"He"is Keith lackson, the
man who announced the
exploits of Turk Schonert,
Chuck Evans and Ken
Margerum to 85 percent of
the country Saturday in
ABC's national coverage of
the Stanford-Arizona State
game.
In a special Monday edi
tion of the Friday Interview,
Sally Jenkins discusses with
Jackson his background in
broadcasting, the state of
college football and the
state of sports media in gen
eral.
Jenkins: How do you go
about preparing for a game?
lackson: You prepare all the
time. You never knowwhen
you might learn something
that you can use. You could
learn something in February
that could be useful in Sep
tember. We learn what
game we will be covering on
Monday, and then we zero
in on the teams. I look at
films, talk to the assistant
coaches to find out what
they are trying to do, and
study the history of the
school if I am not familiar
with it.
That was not necessary
for Stanford, because I have
been covering Stanford
games since about 1957.
(enkins: Do any games that

you have covered stand out
as being particularly great,
or interesting?
Jackson: You never know
when you're going to have a
great game. Going in it
could look like a dog, and
then it turns into a great
one. Your likes and dislikes
should have nothing to do
with it. You might get a spot
ter, or a camera man who
gets lazy if they get bored,
and that shouldn't happen.
But there is always a level
of ball that you know is
going to be great. You know
it's going to be a significant
game because they have
quality people. USC-Notre
Dame is an example,
Alabama, Oklahoma-
Nebraska is another. There
are also teams like Stanford
that don't have the depth or
quality that USC does, but
USC has a hard time beating
them. I don't know why that
happens.
Jenkins: Have you noticed
any significant changes in
college football since
you've been covering it?
lackson: Of course it's
changed. It's probably bet
ter right now than it's ever
been. You have bigger
players, better conditions.
There is also one factor that
seems simple, but is really
very complex, that started in
a sense with the Vietnam
War. In the sixties and
seventies there was a
societal shift in this country
that eliminated the military
hero. We have no more
military heroes, or political
heroes. The astronauts got
short-changed, I think.
The societal hero is now

an athlete. Years ago it was
not so respectable to be a
professional athlete. Today
being a pro athlete is a very
honorable and coveted
position. Younger players
and college athletes are aim
ing there now, con
sequently the quality of play
is better.
And I'll tell you one thing.
Anyone who doesn't be
lieve college athletics is a
business is a damn fool. It's
the most viable product a
university can have — all
you have to do is look at
Notre Dame to tell that.
Where would they be with
out their football team?
lenkins: The idea of a college
football playoff has been
kicked around a lot in the
last couple of years. People
have argued that the bowl
games don't really tell you
who has got the best team in
the nation. What do you
think?
Jackson: I don't think it's
necessary yet. I don't think
it will happen until fiscally,
universities are backed
against the wall — then you
get it. And again, it's mer
chandising. The argument
between USC and Alabama
over who's really number
one is off-season merchan
dising,
lenkins: What do you think
about the dictatorial coach
ing methods that some
coaches use? Do you think
that it's significant two of
those types of coaches have
been fired; Woody Hayes
and Frank Kush?
lackson: I don't think it's
significant. It's a case of
people maybe coaching too

long, and losing their
temper. There is an over
whelming factor that exists
at this time that creates tre
mendous distortion and
misinformation, and that's
the media. It's the reason
why sports has become so
big.
An example is the Gator
Bowl thing when Woody
Hayes hit the Clemson
player. Eventually you're
going to get caught if you do
things like that, because of
the media. But (sometimes)
the media overkills it.
(Jackson has been ac
cused of covering up the
Hayes affair because he
failed to mention it on the
air. He went on to discuss
it.)
ABC screwed it up, they
showed it on the air and
never showed the tape (on
Jackson's monitor). I was
busy looking for final cre
dits and never saw it, so I
didn't say anything about it.
But every damn reporter
was running around
screaming, and people ac
cused me of covering it up.
Now down in Arizona, I
don't know what's going
on, and I don't really care.
But apparently Kevin Rut
ledge, the boy who was hit,
has filed a suit, and the Rut
ledge family has been in
volved in something like 13
suits with the university
over the last 5 years. Well
Frank Kush has filed his own
suit for something like 40
million dollars.
Of course I disapprove of
a coach hitting a player. But
if I was a 19- or 20-year-old
kid with a nine-inch neck,

and a 50-year-old coach
tried to hit me, I'd knock
him on his ass.
One good example of
media overkill: when the
Reggie )ackson-Billy Martin
controversy reached its
peak. Just out of curiosity I
went down to the Yankee
clubhouse. A baseball team
is allowed only 25 players
and reserves. That day the
reserves were hitting in bat
ting practice, so there were
only about 16 players in
there. I counted 16 players
and 38 media people in that
clubhouse.
Now you tell me how
you're going to get the truth
out of that. Thirty-eight de
sperate reporters, all look
ing for any kind of story they
can get. It's too easy to get
distortion out of it.
Jenkins: You talk about
media overkill, and the dan
gers that exist, but you are a
member of the media. Don't
you feel some sort of con
flict there?
Jackson: The ultimate de
fense in every case is the
truth.
Jenkins: Don't you feel some
journalistic obligations to
find the story, or do you not
consider yourself a jour
nalist?
Jackson: Yes, I consider my
self a journalist. I have spent
twenty years as a corres
pondent, in Seattle,
Washington and at ABC. I
have every kind of journalis
tic award hanging on my
wall.
What is news, anyway?
William Allen White
couldn't define it, how can
you or I?
