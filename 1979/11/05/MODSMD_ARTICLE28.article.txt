# Stanford moves into first with 5-1 triumph
## Giucci pulls hat trick in soccer's Big Game 
### Dean Eyre 
Soccer's edition of the Big
Came turned out to be more of
a mental rivalry than a physical
battle royal as Stanford rolled
to a 5-1 victory over UC-
Berkeley.
By winning yesterday's
match-up at Maloney Field, the
Cardinals move into the Pacific
Soccer Conference lead with a
5-1 league record, passing the
University of San Francisco.
The Dons, with a 4-1 confer

ence mark, drop into second
place.
Overall, the Cards post a
14-3-2 record, unbeaten in
their last six games and making
it four straight Big Came vic
tories since Nelson Lodge took
over the reins of the Stanford
soccer program in the fall of
1976.
Cal, on the other hand, is in
the doldrums ot a "disappoint
ing" 7-9-3 season, failing to
score in the past two weeks,

according to Berkeley head
coach Bob DiCrazia. After los
ing to Stanford, Berkeley drops
to 2-4 in conference play.
Against a team that is not
playing well, Stanford would
normally tend to similarly play
below its potential. Fortunately
the Stanford-Cal rivalry was in
mind, if not visible on the field,
keeping the Cards fired up
until building up a four-goal
lead early in the second half.
Just 75 seconds into the

game Stanford jumped out in
front on a goal by Ted
Rafalovich, assisted by Willie
Giucci.
Next on the scorecard was
Giucci, claiming a goal of his
own, with an assist by Peter
Phillips at 30:19. With 37 sec
onds in the first half, Giucci
struck again, this time teaming
up with Dan McNevin.
In the second half, Stanford
continued where it had left off,
scoring with only a few mi
nutes elapsed in the final
period on a shot by Greg De-
Igado, assisted by Rafalovich.
Cal spoiled any Stanford vis
ions of a shutout by logging its
only tally after 75 minutes on a
shot by Matt Bryant.
Giucci scored his third goal
ot the afternoon, his second
hat trick of the season, with a
minute left, demonstrating a
patented Achille's tap — with
his back to the Bears' goal,
Giucce popped a pass from
Fred Benz into the net with a
dexterous heel. Giucci now
leads the Cards in scoring with
19 goals in as many games.
Although the Cards let up
somewhat after leading 4-0,
they played well enough to
keep the momentum, Berkeley
too tired and far behind to
pose a threat.
"It's a tradition — I don't
have to get them up (for the
game)," Lodge said. "The in
tensity was there, the unity was
there. They're higher than
kites,they love to beat Ber

keley."
Lodge cited Giucci's "out
standing" play up front and De-
Igado and Neil Tennyson's
tenacious defensive skills as
key elements in the match. On
the basis of his strength at
sweeper, Delgado was named
last week as the conference
Defensive Player of the Week.
"We didn't keep it (the out
come) a surprise," said
freshman Doug Clark. "We
were playing really well and
moving the ball well. It was one
of our best (played) games of
the season."
And it couldn't have come at
a more significant point in the
season — from Stanford's
perspective, the Big Game was
BIG. Besides the unbeaten
string, the winning streak over
the Golden Bears, and first
place in the PSC, the victory
improves Stanford's credibility
in the regional rankings.
Also, it served as an excellent
tune-up for the Grand Prix,
rather, make that the motoc
ross endurance race, with USF
Tuesday on Ulrich Field in The
City at 2 p.m. Stanford faces
the defending national champs
in a meeting crucial for post
season play consideration.
And of the 1500 fans at
Maloney yesterday, few could
be more pleased than the one
who served as ballperson in
the first halt, guest during the
halftime interview and spirited
sideliner throughout — Athle
tic Director Andy Geiger.
