# New name for Junipero sought

The name of the Asian American theme house in Wil
bur Hall, lunipero, may change before the end of the
year.
For the past four years, house residents and members
of the Asian American community have tried to abolish
the name lunipero, a Spanish word commemorating
Father lunipero Serra. But their efforts were stymied
because they could not agree on a proper substitution
tor the current name.
Now, however, an acceptable solution may be at
hand. Residents are currently rallying behind "Pacifica,"
an idea suggested by house member Ricardo Custodio
during an October house meeting, according to Lisa
Pan, a lunipero theme associate.
"The name means peace," explained Carolyn Chin,
one of (unipero's Resident Fellows. "More specifically,
though, the word would incorporate all of the Asian
Americans because the term implies the countries bor
dering on the Pacific Ocean."
An in-house committee has formed to investigate the
actual process of officially changing the name. Within a
month the committee and the house will assemble to

formally vote on the name.
"The decision must come from within the house, but
we are very concerned about the ideas and desires of the
Asian American community," Chin said. Such consider
ation does, however, delay the official process, she ad
ded.
Non-resident Woody Ichiyasu argued at a recent
house meeting against "Pacifica".
The issue has been drawn out for several years be
cause people have been "bogged down" in choosing a
name that is acceptable to all, said )ohn Dean, another
lunipero resident.
"The process is more difficult than one would im
agine," Chin said. "The name of a house can depict the
political nature and flavor of the residents. It's very hard
to select a name that pleases everybody and does what
the people want it to do: stop perpetuating stereotypes
and emphasize the unification of the Asian American
people."
Once a name is approved by the house, it will be
submitted to Norm Robinson, director of Residential
Education, who will direct procedures to officially
change the name.
