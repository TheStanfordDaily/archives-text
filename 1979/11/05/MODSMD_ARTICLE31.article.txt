## Cal drowns poloists; one shot remains 
### Brad Brockbank 
The Stanford water polo team put all its hopes for a berth in the
upcoming NCAA Championships into a single Big Game basket
this weekend, losing to California Friday, 10-7. In order to have a
shot in qualifying for the nationals, the Cards must beat the Bears
Nov. 17 at deGuerre.
The loss drops Stanford into third place in the Pacific-10, be
hind Cal and USC, but the final standings in the dog-fighting
conference are far from decided. Though the Cards have only the
Cal game left on their Pac-10 schedule, the Bears must first play
USC this weekend in Los Angeles. From the Cards' standpoint, it
doesn't matter who wins that game; Stanford's fate rests entirely
in their own hands. They must beat Cal on Big Game day to assure
themselves of second place in the conference and a berth in the
NCAAs over Thanksgiving.
A victory Friday could have saved them the trouble, but a
nightmarish third quarter and four goals from Cal's Kevin
Robertson put an end to Stanford's bid for an upset win.
The Cards, who played in streaks during the entire game,
adjusted quickly to Cal's smaller pool, but nevertheless found
themselves trailing 3-2 at the end of the first quarter. A strong
defensive team effort and two goals by sophomore Chris Kelsey
in the second period brought Stanford even with the Bears at four
by halftime.
But all hell broke loose in the third quarter, as Cal scored three
unanswered goals to race ahead 7-4.
"We just stopped playing," said head coach Dante Dettamanti
of his team's third-quarter collapse. "We stopped driving; I had
to call a time-out to get people going."
The Cards finally did get going in the fourth quarter. Two
consecutive Cal ejections resulted in goals by Jody Campbell and
Jamie Bergeson, and Stanford was back in the game.
But not for long. With just over four minutes left to play,
Campbell was ejected for a dead-time foul. Moments later, Cal's
Robertson caught the Cards' man-down defense out of position
and scored.
A minute later, Robertson put the last nail in the Cards' coffin,
penetrating the Stanford defense and scoring on the drive.
"Robertson ate us up," said Dettamanti. "He's a hell of a ball
player."
The Cards made one last attempt to get back into the game
before the time ran out when, with 1:45 remaining, Campbell
scored again on a man-up situation. With memories of USC's
last-minute comeback the previous week still in their minds,
Stanford refused to roll over. But 20 seconds later, Carlos Steffens
— in his last game at Harmon pool — scored, putting the game
beyond the realm of miracle finishes.
The loss itself was bad enough, but the Cardinals' woes were
compounded by their miserable seven-for-30 shooting percen
tage. In addition, several more would-be shots were thwarted by
a stingy Bear defense that continually collapsed around Stanford
drivers, knocking the ball from their hands before a shot could be
taken.
"We didn't compensate for that," senior Randy Kalbus said.
"The pass from the hole should have gone back outside, not to
the driver."
Stanford, who came back Saturday morning to sink San jose
State 12-4 in San lose, owns an overall record of 19-4-1, with two
weekends left in the season. Next Saturday, the Cards face UC-
Santa Barbara, the number one-ranked team in the nation.
