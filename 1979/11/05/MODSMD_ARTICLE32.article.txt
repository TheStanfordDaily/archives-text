## 
### Robert Stone 
According to women s cross country head "coach Laurel
Ireon, surprisingly fast times and "very tough competition"
characterized the AIAW Region Eight Championships held
Saturday at Sierra College in Rocklin. Striding to a fifth place
finish in Division I, Treon's squad was led by the one-two
combination of Kim Schnurpfeil and Ann Thrupp, who placed
11th and 14th respectively.
('lacing ahead of Stanford's 152 points in the division were
tirst place California with a total of 44, Arizona in second with
51, UCLA with 70 points for third place, and Cal Poly-SLO in
fourth with 92. The first three teams have qualified for the
AIAW National Championships to be held in two weeks at
Florida State, in addition to the other runners who finished in
the top 15.
The heavy rainfall that soaked the course and the runners for
a third of the race seemed to have had little effect on the quick
pace of the meet as Kathy Mintie of UCLA sped to a first in
Division I with a clocking of 16:17.4. Maggie Keyes of Cal
Poly-SLO covered the course in 16:50.8 for second place,
while California's Jan Oehm took third with a time of 16:53.2.
Leading the Cardinal contingency in what would be the
season finale for the team was freshman harrier
Schnurpfeil, whose 17:33.5 time was good for 11 th place in the
field of 72 and a chance to compete in the nationals. Also
runningat Florida State will be senior Thrupp, who placed
11th there last year. Her 14th place finishinthetimeofl7:4l.l
enabled her to complete her last season on a high note.
Completing the scoring for the Cards was junior Ann
Wotherspoon who finished 28th in 18:22.2, sophomore Susan
Bragdon in 47th with an 18:58.6 time, freshman janeal Cab
bage who clocked 19:13.3 for 56th position, soph Beth Harri
son in the 64th spot with a 19:59.4 showing, and junior Annette
Mungai who placed 65th with a 20:14.2 clocking. Also compet
ing for the Cards but not scoring was junior Joanne Ernst who
finished 70th with a time of 21:10.0.
Schnurpfeil explained that the fast start and quick pace of
the race hurt her at the end. "I really went for it, I was going for
the best, but I didn't have the background. Because of the
incredibly fast start I went into oxygen debt at the end," she
said. She also observed that this was the first time'she's
reached the pain barrier this season.
The conditions and competition seemed to be overwhelm
ing according to Thrupp, who forged ahead from 16th place
with three-quarters of a mile to go for her qualifying berth. "It
was an extremely competitive race, it was the most competi
tive thing I've ever been in," said the veteran who added, "I've
never been in that kind of race. I'm just glad to be in the
finals."
Treon believes that the race provided a chance for her team
to gain experience. "As a team we really did well. Last year we
were seventh in lesser competition. The team effort was defi
nitely good but we'll have to make another big leap next year,"
she said, adding, "We learned so much as a group, this has
been a great learning experience."
