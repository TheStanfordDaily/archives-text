# Schonert passes with flying colors
## 
### Mike Oneal 
Great passing has been a
tradition at Stanford for so long
now that most Cardinal fans
take it for granted. It started in
1940 when head coach Clark
Shaughnessy initiated the Farm
to the T-formation offense and
set the then-Indians on a 40-
year aerial attack that has pro
duced seven All-America quar
terbacks, five NCAA passing
champions, and one Heismann
Trophy winner. Over the last
three weeks, it has continued
via the arm of senior quarter
back Turk Schonert.
Schonert, the victim of tradi
tion and a path of deep, deep
footsteps to follow, has had to
wing the ball for an overall per
centage of .678 (.810 in the last
three weeks) to prove to the
Stanford community, and
more importantly, the rest of
the country that he is one hell
of a quarterback. Percentage
wise, he is passing better than
Steve Dils or Guy Benjamin and
is on the way to setting new
Pacific-10 Conference and
Stanford passing records.
Schonert was 34 for 40 in the
last two games and 13 for 18
Saturday. In three tough games
he has looked as poised as any
of the Stanford greats. As Stan
ford head coach Rod
Dowhower said after the ASU
game:
"Turk got sacked, came
back, and took control. He got
us out of a hole. Turk Schonert
had an outstanding game to
day. He took his lumps and
came back. I'd guess you'd
have to say he's a good quar
terback."
Overall, the passing offense
has been outstanding for three
weeks. It salvaged any sort of
pride the Cards had in last
week's humiliation at the
hands of Oregon State and
helped prove in Saturday's
game that when the defense
clicks, Stanford is a team to be

reckoned with.
The receivers, the other half
of the passing attack, have
been outstanding as well. Ken
Margerum, considered by
many to be the best wide re
ceiver in the country, finally
caught up with Tony Hill this
week as he caught his 18th
touchdown reception to tie the
now-Dallas Cowboy star in the
Stanford record books.
Margerum snagged three

Schonert passes for 129 yards
and one touchdown Saturday
and showed a national TV au
dience what being a wide re
ceiver is all about.
Andre Tyler, who leads the
team in receiving statistics,
with 38 catches for 567 yards,
was 6 for 121 and one
touchdown against the Sun
Devils.
The fact that Margerum and
Tyler were responsible for 250

of the 271 yards passing of
fense shows how effectively
the Cards are using their one
two punch in the aerial attack.
Teams have double- and
triple-teamed Margerum only
to leave Tyler more open.
The pass has been effective
all season for the Cards, thus it
has been quite common to see
Stanford's ball in the air. What
made Saturday's game against
Arizona State different and
more appealing to the
excitement-seeking bowl di
rectors was Stanford's exten
sive use of the long bomb.
The reason for the long pas
sing was ASU's use of man
to-man coverage. The Cards
felt they had to go long.
"If you don't go deep on
them, they won't respect you,"
said Schonert. "They'll just sit
on your ass."
ASU didn't have a chance to
sit on anything against
Margerum and Tyler. The two
speedsters ran right past the
tight coverage and were open
most of the time.
The best way to burn a man
to-man is to take them long and
outrun them. This is exactly
what Stanford did. Schonert
completed passes of 58, 46 and
32 yards and two of those were

for touchdowns. The passes
were there and Margerum and
Tyler seemed to know they
could get open.
"After the first couple of
plays, Andre and I picked out
that they were playing man
to-man," Margerum said.
"When we got back to the
huddle we kind of winked at
each other and said 'This is
gonna be a good one.' "
It certainly was — for both.of
them. Tyler caught the game
tying touchdown pass in the
end zone in the third quarter
on a perfectly-executed quar
terback keep to the right.
Margerum caught the
game-saving 46-yard bomb
trom Schonert, who was stand
ing in the end zone. The sure
handed junior ran a comeback
pattern at first but a sideline
streak in the end. It was the
play that was called, mixed
with a certain team sense the
Cards have developed.
"I was just moving around in
the pocket waiting for him
(Margerum) to get open,"
Schonert said. "Kenny's smart,
he knows how to read de
fenses — it was a spontaneous
reaction. I have confidence in
the receivers."
And by now, they have con
fidence in him.

Margerum caught the
game-saving 46-yard bomb
trom Schonert, who was stand
ing in the end zone. The sure
handed junior ran a comeback
pattern at first but a sideline
streak in the end. It was the
play that was called, mixed
with a certain team sense the
Cards have developed.
"I was just moving around in
the pocket waiting for him
(Margerum) to get open,"
Schonert said. "Kenny's smart,
he knows how to read de
fenses — it was a spontaneous
reaction. I have confidence in
the receivers."
And by now, they have con
fidence in him.

Having completed 47 of 58 passes in his last three games, quarter
back Turk Schonert is threatening to establish new Stanford and
Pacific-10 Conference passing marks.
Great passing has been a
tradition at Stanford for so long
now that most Cardinal fans
take it for granted. It started in
1940 when head coach Clark
Shaughnessy initiated the Farm
to the T-formation offense and
set the then-Indians on a 40-
year aerial attack that has pro
duced seven All-America quar
terbacks, five NCAA passing
champions, and one Heismann
Trophy winner. Over the last
three weeks, it has continued
via the arm of senior quarter
back Turk Schonert.
Schonert, the victim of tradi
tion and a path of deep, deep
footsteps to follow, has had to
wing the ball for an overall per
centage of .678 (.810 in the last
three weeks) to prove to the
Stanford community, and
more importantly, the rest of
the country that he is one hell
of a quarterback. Percentage
wise, he is passing better than
Steve Dils or Guy Benjamin and
is on the way to setting new
Pacific-10 Conference and
Stanford passing records.
Schonert was 34 for 40 in the
last two games and 13 for 18
Saturday. In three tough games
he has looked as poised as any
of the Stanford greats. As Stan
ford head coach Rod
Dowhower said after the ASU
game:
"Turk got sacked, came
back, and took control. He got
us out of a hole. Turk Schonert
had an outstanding game to
day. He took his lumps and
came back. I'd guess you'd
have to say he's a good quar
terback."
Overall, the passing offense
has been outstanding for three
weeks. It salvaged any sort of
pride the Cards had in last
week's humiliation at the
hands of Oregon State and
helped prove in Saturday's
game that when the defense
clicks, Stanford is a team to be

reckoned with.
The receivers, the other half
of the passing attack, have
been outstanding as well. Ken
Margerum, considered by
many to be the best wide re
ceiver in the country, finally
caught up with Tony Hill this
week as he caught his 18th
touchdown reception to tie the
now-Dallas Cowboy star in the
Stanford record books.
Margerum snagged three

Schonert passes for 129 yards
and one touchdown Saturday
and showed a national TV au
dience what being a wide re
ceiver is all about.
Andre Tyler, who leads the
team in receiving statistics,
with 38 catches for 567 yards,
was 6 for 121 and one
touchdown against the Sun
Devils.
The fact that Margerum and
Tyler were responsible for 250

of the 271 yards passing of
fense shows how effectively
the Cards are using their one
two punch in the aerial attack.
Teams have double- and
triple-teamed Margerum only
to leave Tyler more open.
The pass has been effective
all season for the Cards, thus it
has been quite common to see
Stanford's ball in the air. What
made Saturday's game against
Arizona State different and
more appealing to the
excitement-seeking bowl di
rectors was Stanford's exten
sive use of the long bomb.
The reason for the long pas
sing was ASU's use of man
to-man coverage. The Cards
felt they had to go long.
"If you don't go deep on
them, they won't respect you,"
said Schonert. "They'll just sit
on your ass."
ASU didn't have a chance to
sit on anything against
Margerum and Tyler. The two
speedsters ran right past the
tight coverage and were open
most of the time.
The best way to burn a man
to-man is to take them long and
outrun them. This is exactly
what Stanford did. Schonert
completed passes of 58, 46 and
32 yards and two of those were

for touchdowns. The passes
were there and Margerum and
Tyler seemed to know they
could get open.
"After the first couple of
plays, Andre and I picked out
that they were playing man
to-man," Margerum said.
"When we got back to the
huddle we kind of winked at
each other and said 'This is
gonna be a good one.' "
It certainly was — for both.of
them. Tyler caught the game
tying touchdown pass in the
end zone in the third quarter
on a perfectly-executed quar
terback keep to the right.
Margerum caught the
game-saving 46-yard bomb
trom Schonert, who was stand
ing in the end zone. The sure
handed junior ran a comeback
pattern at first but a sideline
streak in the end. It was the
play that was called, mixed
