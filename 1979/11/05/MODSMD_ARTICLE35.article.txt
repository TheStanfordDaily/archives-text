The Stanford Cardinals fell
victim to a strong field and the
luck of the draw this weekend
as the women's volleyballers
finished fourth in their six
team division at the National
Invitational Volleyball Tour
nament on the UCLA campus.
"This is the strongest tour
nament ever for the NIVT
compared to previous years
and the second-strongest
competition compared to the
national championships,"
head coach Fred Sturm said.
The spikers' winning games
were played with consistency
and strength. They could not
keep up the effort over the en
tire tournament, however, as
the competition was fierce.
There were three six-team
divisions in the meet, and Stan
ford was placed in a division
with top-ranked Hawaii and
USC, who finished one-two in

the overall standings. Pepper-,
dine placed third overall, beat
ing out UCLA for fourth place.
University of Pacific, one of
Stanford's toughest rivals this
year, finished third in the
Cards' division and lost a:
three-game quarterfinal match
they should have won, accord
ing to Sturm.
The Stanford coach was
pleased with the Cards' per
formance this weekend, par
ticularly the tight blocking.
In addition, the mental in
consistencies that have pre
vented Stanford from being a
top team were eliminated and
the team played as a unit. Con
sidering the caliber of contend
ing teams like Hawaii and USC^ 1
Stanford's performance was
like that of a game fighter V
however, the punches came
too fast.
