Four killed at anti-KKK rally
Greensboro, N.C. — Police arrested two more
suspects yesterday and charged them with conspi
racy to commit murder in connection with a
weekend "Death to the Klan" rally that left four
dead and 10 wounded.
Meanwhile, Andrew Pelczar, agent in charge of
the FBl's Greensboro office, said the bureau had
entered the case to determine whether there were
any civil rights violations.
While authorities searched for the two suspects
yesterday, the rhetoric heightened from the
Communist victims of the Saturday bloodbath and
sympathizers with the armed whites who broke up
an anti-Klan rally with gunfire.
Civil rights organizations, in the meantime,
blamed the bloody attack on a resurgence of Klu
Klux Klan activity across the South and the failure
of law enforcement officials to prosecute
Klansmen committing acts of violence.
Already in jail were a dozen men charged with
first-degree murder following Saturday's assault
on an anti-Klan rally organized by the leftist Work
ers Viewpoint Organization, which earlier had
taunted Klansmen as "cowards."
While police said some of the suspects were
avowed members of the Klan, local KKK leaders
said they were members of other right-wing or
ganizations. Two different Klan sources labeled
them as Nazis, but that could not be confirmed.
Steve Suitts, executive director of the Southern
Regional Council in Atlanta, blamed the shooting
on a lack of diligence by law enforcement officers.
Carloads of whites, some armed with automatic
weapons, drove into the rally site and gunfire
broke out after words were exchanged between
the two groups. All the victims were from among
the 100 participants in the rally, authorities said.
A Klan leader, who was the focal point of litera
ture announcing the Saturday rally, denied his
group had anything to do with the violence.
Joe Grady of Winston-Salem, a leader of a Klan
group called the White Knights of Liberty, said: "It
was not the Ku Klux Klan over there. They were
damned Nazis."
There has been no significant Klan activity in
North Carolina since the civil-rights battles of the
19605.
Suit filed against Livermore Lab
Livermore — The widow of a Lawrence Liver
more Laboratories technician has filed a $10 mill
ion lawsuit, charging that the lab negligently ex
posed her husband to radiation which caused his
death from a rare form of skin cancer.
The suit alleges that Richard McSwiggen, an
electronics technician from Pleasanton, died from
metastatic malignant melanoma on Nov. 5, 1978,
after he was exposed to radioactive materials dur
ing his employment.
He had worked at the lab for 18 years.

Attorney Victor Poree said he thought this is the
first suit of its kind filed against the Livermore Lab,
a nuclear weapons research facility, which is man
aged by the University of California and funded by
the federal Department of Energy.
Poree cited eight causes of action in the suit,
among them that lab medical staff members Dr.
Max Biggs, John Beatty and 30 unnamed co
defendants did "carelessly diagnose, examine,
advise and treat" McSwiggen, who relied upon
their professional diagnosis and advice.
The suit holds that "harmful, poisonous. . .rays
were given off into the atmosphere where
McSwiggen and others in his position carried out
their duties . . . working with such radioactive
materials."
McSwiggen was one of four Livermore Lab
employees to die of melanoma since 1974.
In all, 14 cases of melanoma have been diag
nosed since 1968 from among the Livermore Lab's
7000 employees. Thirteen of those cases occurred
between 1972 and 1977. State health officials say
the normal melanoma rate is one case per 10,000
persons.
Quake fault near nuke facilities
Livermore — Federal geologists report they have
confirmed that an earthquake fault runs near two
nuclear weapons laboratories in the Livermore
Valley 40 miles east of San Francisco.
But the facilities insist the fault poses no public
radioactivity hazard.
The U.S. Geological Survey says the Las Positas
Fault was discovered Wednesday to run east-west
along a stream bed that passes through the Sandia
Livermore Laboratory, which is across the street
from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
The fault line was confirmed by trenches dug in
the region.
Talks open on MX missile plan
Cedar City, Utah — A House subcommittee
opens hearings today on the Carter administra
tion's proposal to build the controversial $33 bill
ion MX mobile missile system in Utah and Nevada.
In the meantime, Utah Gov. Scott Matheson
said, when he suggested his state to President
jimmy Carter as a site last spring, he had no idea of
the enormous potential impact from the project.
To assess that impact on both states, the House
subcommittee will hear testimony from Air Force
Secretary Flans Mark, Matheson, Rep. Dan Mar
riott (R-Utah) and a string of government and pri
vate witnesses.
The iytX system would involve 200 missiles —
each deployed on its own "race track" — spread
across 24,000 square miles of Great Basin desert.
The MX was approved for development by Car
ter in June, and the Air Force already has asked for

$57 million to build roads and facilities at Vanden
berg Air Force Base, Calif., for test firing over the
Pacific Ocean in early 1983.
Defense officials say they will ask Congress next
year for $112 million for buildings and road con
struction for the Utah and Nevada sites, aiming at
bringing the project to partial combat readiness by
1986.
The MX is intended to replace the nation's aging
system of Minuteman intercontinental ballistic
missiles.
The MX concept would allow the Air Force to
hide its powerful missiles in hardened shelters
that could stand up to all but a direct hit from a
Soviet missile.
Audits show UC misused grants
Santa Ana — Audits of the nine University of
California campuses by the federal Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) indicate
mismanagement of $48 million in research grants
over a five-year period, the Orange County Regis
ter reported Friday.
The audits claim altering of bookkeeping re
cords, illegal transfer of funds from one project to
another and overcharging of sponsors were some
of the methods used to pad funding, the paper
said.
The HEW audits challenge the use or intended
use of $48 million in federal research monies, of
which more than $2 million have been refunded.
But UC officials maintain that in most cases the
alleged mismanagement either was justified to
ensure that research was completed or was unav
oidable because of a shortage of bookkeepers.
In the 1979-1980 school year, the nine UC
schools will receive an estimated $1.1 billion of
their $2.9 billion operating budget from federal
grants and Department of Energy contracts.
Fake 'pistol' fired at SF mayor
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein, cam
paigning for this week's election, was startled by a
man who pointed a pistol-shaped lighter at her
and pulled the trigger.
The authentic-looking pistol shot out a butane
flame, and the mayor was unharmed during the
incident Saturday.
A police inspector who doubles as the mayor's
driver and bodyguard was trailing the mayor and
several aides during the campaign swing.
No attempt was made to detain the unidentified
man.
