# Proposition 13 efforts furthered
## 'Spirit of 13' proposal nears vote 
### Kimberly Brown 
It is hard to say just when the great
"tax revolt" began in California. Cer
tainly not with Proposition 13 — that
was a result, not a beginning. The
battle has been raging for the past
decade and, with the passage of 13 in
1978, finally culminated in an over
whelming victory — or, depending
upon which side you fought — a
crippling defeat.
Now, 1 Yi years later, the battlefield
is still smoking. Continuing public
discontent will manifest itself tomor
row on the special election ballot
armed with Paul Gann's "Spirit of 13"
spending limitation initiative.
While Howard jarvis's Prop. 13
concentrated on property tax re
form, the Gann proposal attacks
government spending. It is based on
a formula which restricts state and
local governments from increasing
their spending more than the yearly
increases in cost of living and popu
lation growth. The effect would be to
hold the growth rate of spending
considerably below what has been
the norm for many decades.
The last California polls showed 61
percent of the voters favoringGann's
initiative, 28 percent opposingand 11
percent undecided. This voter sen
timent has not gone unnoticed and
many liberal politicians who fought
Prop. 13 have lined up behind the
new measure.
Gann, the less flamboyant partner
in last year's eminently successful
larvis-Gann property tax reduction
movement, says his "Spirit of 13,"
formally titled Proposition 4 is simply
the icing on the Prop. 13 cake. The
measure, he says, is designed to un
iformly closed loopholes that state
and local governments might devise
to get around the property tax
slashing decision by California vot
ers.
• New analysis*
Will Prop. 4 indeed force Sac
ramento and local lawmakers to be
more selective in their spending
programs?
Or, as its opponents claim, will the
amendment gradually strangle
California's economy?
No one analyzing the proposition
from a neutral position can say for
sure. California government
analysts, after examining the prop
osal, only concluded that, "the im
pact of this measure in future years
cannot be estimated, although the

measure could cause government
spending to be significantly lower
than it would be otherwise."
Those who have taken sides in the
battle have nonetheless armed
themselves with a barrage of opin
ions and figures.
Michael Kirst, President of the
State Board of Education and a pro
fessor of education here, said,
"Gann's proposed amendment ap
pears to be a reasonable and effec
tive measure at first glance. How
ever, it is so riddled with loopholes
that it will be ineffective for most
governmental jurisdictions."
According to Kirst, "The proposi
tion's ambiguous provisions ask the
voter to approve a detailed measure
that, with unknown impact, would
regulate more than 6000 units of gov
ernment. Since the legislature can
not adapt a constitutional amend
ment to local circumstances, this
simplistic proposition is dangerous."
Because of his position on the
State Board of Education, Kirst is par
ticularly aware of the effects the
proposal would have on California
school districts.
Unfair basis
Since the Cann formula for school
funding is based on enrollment and
not population, "Prop. 4 would un
fairly penalize school districts that
have declining enrollment," he said.
The Palo Alto School District
would particularly suffer from this
measure because the average daily
attendance has dropped 8 to 9 per
cent each year over the last decade,
from 16,244 to 11,340.
Moreover, "School financing is
now based on several special factors
the initiative ignores," Kirst said.
"For example school districts faced

with unusual and uncontrollable
high costs, such as large percentages
of disadvantaged, handicapped and
bilingual pupils, now receive more
money." The Gann Amendment
does not take these special cir
cumstances into consideration.
Also opposed to Gann's proposal
is Ray Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning
'Politics of exasperation'
"I am frustrated by the politics of
exasperation," he said. He called
Prop. 4 "a meat axe approach" and
said he fears that advocates are "go
ing about things without paying at
tention to the consequences."
Bacchetti said he isn't sure what
will be cut from the schools' budgets
if the initiative passes. "The wording
of the proposal is very vague and will
require a great deal of time to inter
pret," he said.
Glenn Hoffman, city superinten
dent of Santa Clara Schools, expres
sed similar views on the issue. He
identified two main problems which
would face the schools — "unlimited
appropriations, because the districts
don't have 'fees' as such, and declin
ing enrollment."
Hoffman also could not foresee
the actual consequences of the de
clining enrollment, but said he be
lieves the initiative would cause con
siderable cutbacks in some districts.
Participatory democracy
To all of this debate, Gann suppor
ters reply that in the final analysis,
the voters will decide such issues.
"It is participatory democracy at
the core," says W. Craig
Stubblebine, a political economics
professor at Claremont Men's Col
lege who helped draft the proposal.
"The power to determine the
overall taxing and spending of each
unit of California government would
be returned directly to and be exer
cised directly by the people," he
said.
Prop. 4 establishes initial approp
riations limits for each unit of
California government in terms of
that unit's appropriations for fiscal
year 1978-79, adjusted for inflation
and population.
Since no one simple-limit formula
can accommodate the diversity
among California communities, the
initiative permits the voters of every
community to adopt whatever ap
propriations limit they find neces
sary.
"Prop. 13 was statewide. However,
our proposal allows for lower limits
to be set in some communities and
higher limits in others," Stubblebine
explained.

"Under the Gann Initiative the
State legislature can increase and de
crease 'certain areas' as it sees fit,"
said California Chamber of Com
merce member Jim Kennedy, who
worked on the initiative with
Stubblebine. "Unlike Prop. 13 where
a given group benefits, this system
would help all taxpayers," he said.
Supporters view the measure as a
means to limit state and government
spending, refund excess taxes re
ceived by the state to the taxpayer,
curb excessive user fees imposed by
local government and close
loopholes government bureaucrats
have devised to evade the intent of
Prop. 13.
Those on the opposing front see
the proposal as no guarantee that the
"fat" will be cut from the govern
ment. They claim that Prop. 4 is not
tax reform, but is instead a rash mea
sure that places a straightjacket on
government at they very moment
when Californians are faced with an
uncertain economic future.
