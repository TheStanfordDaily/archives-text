# Iranian students take U.S. Embassy
## 
### Associated Press 
A mob of Iranian students overran
U.S. Marine guards in a three-hour
struggle yesterday and invaded the
American Embassy in Tehran, seizing
dozens of staff members as hostages,
Tehran Radio reported. They de
manded that the United States send
the exiled shah back to Iran for trial,
the radio said.
No serious injuries were reported.
Tehran Radio said as many as 100 hos
tages were being held, but an Iranian
Foreign Ministry spokesman said he
believed it was fewer than 45 â€”
about 35 Americans and seven or
eight Iranians.
The spokesman, who asked not to
be identified, said an estimated 200
or 300 students were involved.
The Tehran Radio broadcasts,
monitored in London, said the em
bassy's Marine guards hurled tear
gas cannisters but were unable to
hold back the waves of students.
None of the broadcasts mentioned
weapons other than tear gas.
U.S. State Department spokesmen
said the Iranian government had "gi
ven assurances that our people being
held are safe and well."
]ust hours after the embassy inva
sion, seven demonstrators chained
themselves inside the Statue of Lib
erty in New York Harbor to protest
the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi's presence in New York,
where he is hospitalized for cancer
treatment. After 3Vi hours, au
thorities cut the chains and took the
protesters into custody.
The Tehran broadcasts, some not
clearly received, said the students
were motivated by a message from
the leader of Iran's Islamic revolu
tion, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini.
The Moslem clergyman on Sunday
once again denounced the United
States for allowing the deposed shah
into the country. Pahlavi, living in
Mexico, went to New York last
month on a special medical visa and
underwent gallbladder surgery and
testing. Doctors recommended he
stay in the United States for six
months to a year for drug treatment
of his cancer.
Khomeini and his supporters have
repeatedly accused the United States
and other countries of fomenting re
bellion against his anti-Western,
anti-communist regime, which is
troubled by unrest among Kurdish,
Arabic and other minorities.
This was the second time the em
bassy has been taken over since the
revolution. Gunmen believed to be
renegade revolutionaries invaded
the embassy last Feb. 14, killing one
Iranian and taking 101 hostages, in
cluding Ambassador William Sullivan
and 19 Marine guards.
