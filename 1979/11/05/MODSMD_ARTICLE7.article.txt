# Fourth area attack in six months
## Woman raped in College Terrace 
### 
A 29-year-old woman was raped in
her home in the College Terrace area
near campus Thursday morning in
the fourth such attack over the past
six months.
The methods employed in the as
sault were identical to those of the
three earlier attacks, leading police
to conclude that the same assailant
continues to victimize single women
in that neighborhood.
The incident occurred between
4:30 and 5 a.m. when a man dressed
in dark clothes and surgical rubber
gloves entered the house by slicing
through a screen covering a living
room window, according to Palo Alto
Police Lt. Bruce Cumming. Also, as in
all past cases, the rapist cut tele
phone lines, disconnected electrical
power, wielded a knife and de
scended upon a woman living alone.
The woman suffered hand abra
sions from the encounter.
Police described the suspect as a
white male in his late 20s with neatly
cut dark hair, weighing 155 to 170
pounds and standing around 5 feet 7
inches.
After the last attack Sept. 15, Palo
Alto Police Detective Brian Vierra
confirmed that authorities were cer
tain that the same man had then
committed 10 similar acts of violence
in the community. Seven sexual as
saults were reported between 1971
and 1976 while the rest took place
this year.
Not all of those occasions culmi
nated in successfully accomplished

rapes, however. Police said the man
completed one rape May 16 and at
tempted another July 4 before the
September and most recent efforts.
Following the July struggle a more
thorough endeavor to enlighten re
sidents and circulate the attacker's
description was undertaken. Pre

ceding the September effort , de
terient procedures were re
emphasized and vigorous search re
sumed. Over 200 concerned resi
dents met then to develop combative
measures.
