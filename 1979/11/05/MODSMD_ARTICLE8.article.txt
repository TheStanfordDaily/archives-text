## Vietnam uses poison gas on refugees, senator says 
### 
Washington (AP) — There is
evidence that some Cambo
dian relugees have been at
tacked with poison gas as well
as being exposed to the rav
ages of starvation and disease,
a Senate refugee subcommit
tee was told last week.
Sen. lames Sasser and folk
singer Joan Baez testilied that
they were told by refugees that
poison gas had been used dur
ing lighting between Viet
namese units and the forces of
now-deposed Cambodian
leader Pol Pot.
The two have completed re
cent inspection tours of Cam
bodian refugee camps in Thai
land.
Sasser (D-Tenn.) said lie was
told that evidence of three dif
ferent types of gas was found
on the clothes of many re
fugees.
He said two ot the gasses
were deadly and the third was
non-lethal tear gas. Sasser said
the two deadly gasses were
nerve gas and a gas which kills
by causing internal bleeding.
He said he interviewed a
tribesman who told him that a
band of 800 were subjected to
gas attacks on a trek across the
length of Cambodia.
Aid delayed
•Meanwhile, a cargo ship til
led with food was forced to
v\siit five days recently before
unloading at a Cambodian
port, illustrating the difficulty
of delivering the massive aid
pouring in from around the
world.
Daily aid (lights from
Bangkok are limited by Thai
controls, the Cambodians have
rejected the idea of overland
truck convoys, and deliveries
by sea have become the main
lifeline tor the more than two
million Cambodians said to
face death by starvation.
But the country's only
deepwater port, Kompong
Som, can handle only four

ships at a time and unload
them at the rate of only 350
tons a day, according to aid of
ficials here.
When two ships bringing
6000 tons of supplies donated
by international agencies ar
rived late last week, three
Soviet vessels were already
docked, and one of the new
arrivals could do nothing but
wait.
But the aid keeps pouring in
from international aid
groups such as the World Food
Program, the International Red
Cross and the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and
from the Soviet Union and
other communist countries.
'Sufficient aid'
When the Cambodian gov
ernment rejected a U.S. prop
osal to trui k huge amounts of
aid across the Thai border to
the capital Phnom Penh, it
claimed that sufficient aid is
reaching the country by other
means.
The government also said
the agriculture system which it
claims was disrupted by the Pol
Pot regime is beginning to re
vive, with a harvest of some
56,000 tons ot rice expected
soon.
Fint this figure, along with
the i laim that the huge amount
of 200,000 tons of relief has
been delivered by communist
allies, is questioned by analysts
here.
Meanwhile, Western relief
agencies are quietly delivering
hundreds ot tons of supplies
directly across the Cambodian
border Irom Thailand to areas
that are not under the control
of the Vietnamese-backed
government of FHeng Samrin in
Phnom Penh.
This aid, including more
than 900 tons ot food, a ton of
medicine, tens of thousands ot
vitamin pills and thousands of
shelter tarpaulins and mos
quito nets, goes to people in
areas controlled by Pol Pot

guerrillas and by third-force
right-wing "Free Khmer"
troops.
In the next tew days, sources
here say, another cross-border
delivery of 1500 tons of rice and
several hundred tons of dried
fish and cooking oil is planned.
The Heng Samrin govern
ment vigorously objects to
these relief operations, which
are carried on without public
ity, and because of them has
refused to acknowledge offi
cially the air and sea deliveries.
