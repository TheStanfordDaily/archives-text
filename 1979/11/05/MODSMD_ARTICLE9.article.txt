Soweto, South Africa (AP) —
Black guerrillas struck a police
station in this sprawling black
community early Friday with
Soviet-made hand grenades
and assault rifles, killing two
black policemen. The govern
ment blamed "Moscow" for
the attack.
A black policeman and a civi
lian were wounded in the as
sault, the second in six months
on a police station in Soweto.
Maj. Gen. Victor Verster,
police commander of riot con
trol said as many as four blacks
attacked the Orlando police
station at about 12:40 a.m.
He said the attackers let
loose with an "indiscriminate"
burst ot tire from Soviet-made
AK-47s at policemen and civi
lians in the charge office. At the

same time, Verster said, other
men threw four hand grenades
at the back of the station. All
the shooting victims were
black.
Police officers said the entire
attack lasted only a few mi
nutes, and the guerrillas fled
by car.
"What particular instruc
tions Moscow gave them I do
not know," Verster said.
Verster's statement reflects
the government's belief that
there is a connection between
organized black terrorism and
Moscow, and ttie belief that
exile black organizations like
the African National Council
and Pan African Council get
financing and training from the
Soviet Union.
