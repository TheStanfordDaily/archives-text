Le Faucon (The Falcon) settles
in Law School courtyard
Workers assembled a 3-ton steel faucon (falcon) last week in
the courtyard of the Law School. The sculpture, created in 1961 by
the late Alexander Calder, remained outside Calder's studio in
Tours, France until his death in 1976.
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lang, who endowed the dean's chair,
donated the work, which stands 12 feet high and measures 20 feet
long by 10 feet wide.
Prof. Albert Elsen, acting chairman of the Art Department cal
led the falcon's "provocative ambiguity" characteristic of Cal
der's works.
