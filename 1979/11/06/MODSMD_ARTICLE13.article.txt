## Editorial Live-ins Bridge the gap 
### 
The issue of live-ins at The Bridge paints
up many of the dangers of employing rigid
bureaucratic rules to cover diverse cir
cumstances.
The Bridge is a student-run peer counsel
ing and information center. Among other
unquestionably valuable services, The
Bridge provides, in coordination with
Cowell Student Health Center, the only
nearly 24-hour counseling and emergency
service available on campus.
Four live-in staffers are the resource The
Bridge utilizes to provide this service. Staf
fers at The Bridge argue that the live-ins
also form "an important nucleus" for such
Bridge services as classes and workshops.
They believe that without the live-in incen
tive, the almost round-the-clock counsel
ing service The Bridge provides would be in
danger.
Although he has not yet made a decision,
Director of Student Activities Thomas Mas
sey has said that it is unfair for The Bridge to
have live-in staffers when other campus
groups do not.
Equity is the issue here, Massey argues.
Both the nearly 24-hour service and the
strong nucleus that the live-ins currently
provide can be had without live-ins, Mas
sey has said.
An additional point to be made is that, to
some extent, the Dean of Student Affairs
office has itself created this issue. Appa
rently no other campus counseling group
has made a demand for Bridge space; nor
have there been complaints from other

groups concerning the equity of the space
situation. The Bridge has responded to
legitimate requests from the student affairs
office in the past. In the last few years, The
Bridge has acceded to requests to shift its
emphasis from the general community to
Stanford. Now all the live-in staffers are
Stanford students.
We agree with both Massey and Bridge
staffers that The Bridge provides important
services. We disagree with Massey that
these services could be provided without
live-ins.
Every campus group is different; every
campus group makes use of different re
sources. The Bridge effectively makes use
of a major resource, live-in staffers, to pro
vide valuable services. Without live-ins, it
will probably be much more difficult for
The Bridge to provide these counseling
services.
Massey is concerned that by allowing
staffers to continue to live in at The Bridge,
a precedent will be set for other campus
groups. But rather than institute a strict pol
icy against live-ins, we think that judging
each case on its own merits as it occurs is a
better way to proceed. The live-in resource
should not be eliminated in order that a
neat bureaucratic standard be instituted.
The debate over this issue has taken up
much of Massey's and the Bridge staffers'
valuable time. We think that The Bridge
should be left alone to devote its efforts
exclusively to its counseling and informa
tional work.
