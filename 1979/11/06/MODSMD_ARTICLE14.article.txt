# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Larry Diamond Appreciate plight of clerical staff 
### 
In the last few weeks, we have seen a
group of people, mostly women, on
whom the smooth functioning of this Uni
versity vitally depends emerging from a
timid obscurity to claim their rights.
Inspired by the ideas and values of the
women's liberation movement, and by the
harsh, for some devastating, impact of gal
loping inflation, they are demanding bet
ter benefits, greater respect but most of all
a living wage for the maybe 2000 office and
clerical staff here. To pursue these goals,
they are seeking to organize a union.
There are many issues at stake, but the
paramount one is money. A large propor
tion of the office and clerical staff are
single parents trying to support a family.
Most of these ( probably more than 80
percent of all secretaries and clerical
workers) are women. And unless they
have some additional source of income,
they are increasingly hard-pressed to
make ends met*. 1
Consider #"WsaMs>tic example. The Oct.
10 issue of Campus Report lists a job de
scription for a secretary at level 111 (the
highest grade). This person is required to
perform a wide range of secretarial and
administrative functions for a starting
monthly salary of $1038-1090.
If this person is raising a couple of chil
dren (especially teenagers), she is going to
be struggling to do it on — let's be optimis
tic — $1100 a month. State and federal
taxes will likely claim around $250, leaving
her with roughly $850 each month. Given
the severe shortage of moderate income
housing in this area, it will be quite a trick
for her to find an apartment for her family

renting for less than $400 a month.
The further she lives from Stanford, the
cheaper perhaps, but the costlier it is to
commute. She likely owns an old car that is
repeatedly breaking down but that she
can't afford to properly repair. She will
easily pay $60 a month in gas, oil, insur
ance, maintenance and repairs.
Clothes for the children and for herself
will run at least $80a month.
What will be most painful will be the
grocery bill. As anyone who has regularly
had to feed and care for two children
knows, it is pretty hard to do these days for
even $50 a week. Say she'll spend $200 a
month at the market and the drug store,
pinching pennies everywhere possible.
Health care (under the Kaiser plan avail
able through Stanford) will run $54 for her
two children (hers is free). Utilities and a
host of miscellaneous expenses will
quickly add another $60 at least.
The bottom line is that the basic ex
penses of this secretary 111, quite conserva
tively estimated, will absorb around $850 a
month — or just about all of her take
home pay.
These are basic expenses. I asked one
secretary what she and her friends do for
recreation. "Forget that," she said. "You
go to church for recreation." She didn't
say what you do if your child needs some
special treatment. Or the car breaks down
altogether. Maybe some go to church then
too. Others take on a second, even a third
job.
To return to the job listing, for this
struggling wage the Secretary 111 is ex
pected not only to type fast and accurately,

but also to: "work with little or no supervi
sion; exercise mature judgement and tact
when relating to faculty, students, visitors
and recruiters; . . . handle correspon
dence, reports, research proposals, man
uscripts and forms involving specialized
terminology; audit and prepare expense
reports; arrange cash advances; make fi
nancial commitments on research grants;
maintain the department computer ac
count; arrange and coordinate confer
ences; and handle applications for admis
sion to Graduate School."
It's a good bet to assume that this
talented and versatile secretary will also be
required to add word processing and
computer skills, with no increase in pay,
just to remain eligible for a Stanford posi
tion. This points to an additional injustice:
a great many office and clerical staff here
are simply not paid what they are worth.
We as consumers owe it to these people
to stop taking them for granted.
We can show our appreciation for their
dedication and our sympathy for their
plight just by telling them we're behind
them. Formal endorsements by student
leaders and organizations will be impor
tant and personal messages of support will
haveaspecial meaning.
Aided by decades-old stereotypes, de
pendencies and fears, an employer may be
able to withstand an attempt by workers to
unionize and win a living wage. But when
the consumers stand behind the workers,
no employer can defeat their cause.
