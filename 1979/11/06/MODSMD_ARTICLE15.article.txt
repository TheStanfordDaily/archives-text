## Life after the diploma 
### 
Last week a friend of mine was telling me all
his plans for working in government, preferably
in the energy field.
When I told him I was majoring in compara
tive literature he said, "Oh, you're Koine to law
school, right?"
"No," I said.
"Then you're going to take a Ph.D. and teach,
right?"
"No, not that either."
He looked at me with great disappointment
and asked me what I was going to do with my
degree besides framing it and hanging it on my
wall. Uncomfortable, I changed the subject.
I understood where he was coming from,
however. Two or three years ago, when I had
ambitions, I was jus? as certain of where I was
headed. Often I'dquestion myfriendszealously
as to their plans and if they'd say they didn't have
any definite ones, I'd reprove them: "You've
got to start planning early or you can't get
ahead."
I said it and believed it. But being only sixteen
or seventeen I was as stupid as I was ambitious.
Gradually all the important facets of my life
began to change: subjects that formerly were
fascinating became dull, I started to hate the
cities I used to love and love those I had hated, I
didn't like the school I'd always planned to at
tend.
And as quickly as you can snap your fingers all
the carefully- nurtured ambitions didn't fit any
more. Now if asked where "I'm headed" I can
manage some vague words (say, the "enter
tainment industry") but no more.
Changing just a little can derail all the long
range planning. Am I sorry about that? I can't
retrieve my previous ambitions; those are gone.
But I can't help thinking that all those years of
being career-oriented, all those times I declared
my major a year in advance and said that I had
solid, unalterable goals precluded any possibil

ity of me really learning and changing my mind
as much as the world around me was changing.
But if I'm free of ambitions now, I'm not (and
probably never will be) liberated from the
deep-seated feeling (whether it's personal or
societal I'm not sure) that I should be intense, I
should have a high goal, I should, I should.
I'm not free enough not to worry about
exams, not to think that if I get a C or a D in some
obscure course now, it will ruin some future
opportunity.
Deep in the back of my mind (though I rarely
disclose this) I envy my government-oriented
friend. He's got his goals; they're even tangible
goals that can be reached.
I still feel that his is the correct way of going to
college and that there is something wrong in my
spending the money only to put my diploma in
my desk drawer to gather dust (if I can afford a
desk).
At the same time, however, I fear for my
friend. Perhaps he'll undergo the changes I've
experienced in a few years but be too deeply
esconced in a career to free himself. The career
will then define the person, instead of the other
way around.
There's another type of person I envy far
more, a member of a far smaller group. He
chooses his major by flipping a coin, doesn't
really care about getting a few C sand is
genuinely oblivious to the anxieties over
careers.
When asked what he's "going to do" after
school he answers with the equally trite and
true: "Begin life." This person knows, I think,
that choosing one career or another can't
change the personality one has.
Yes, I envy him, but I could never be that
smart.
