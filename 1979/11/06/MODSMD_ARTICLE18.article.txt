## University must revamp Tresidder 
### 
Stanford University came to
a fork in the road some years
ago and chose a path marked
"Residential Education." The
other road, the one not taken,
was marked "Campus-wide In
teraction" and immediately fell
into disuse and disrepair. And
that has made all the differ
ence.
Understand first that resi
dential education is an under
rated beauty of our university.
Its approach to fostering in

teraction, activities and
warmth within each residence
is largely quite successful.
But also understand that re
sidential education is not the
complete answer to student
needs and that singular em
phasis on it will cripple other
aspects of student living. Dorm
walls should not impede
campus-wide activities.
Think of the common com
plaints concerning student af
fairs at Stanford. The ineffec
tiveness of our ASSU Senate.
The woes of our college union.
The difficulty of staying in
touch with old friends.
Then blame the system. Not
only do we currently ignore
certain student activities, but
we even more ignominiously
ignore certain students. Resi
dential education has little to
offer students living off
campus.
A strong community union is
needed to serve as a partner'to
residential education. It must
be frequented for its social and
extra-curricular offerings as
well as for its student services
(banking, barbering, buying.)

Stanford currently lacks not
just such a center; it lacks such
an approach. Students are ob
liged to follow the same path
that university planners chose
years ago — leading to the re
sidences, not to Tresidder.
(Follow a campus Band rally
sometime and find out for
yourself.)
It doesn't have to be that
way. Though Tresidder was
ill-conceived, itdoesn't have to
be disowned. It's time to re
think the grand plan behind
Tresidder. It's time to rethink
the grand plan behind this uni
versity.
Why are student offices on
the second floor of our student
union? Why do revenue
producing concerns dominate
the first? Where is the lounge
space? Why are prices so high?
The faults again are in the
system. University planners
took a path years ago that left
Tresidder to financially fend
for itself. As a result, revenue
producing concerns win out
over student ones.
The University must now
consider subsidization of our
community center in a manner

similar to university support of
residential education. The pre
cepts of interaction, activities
and warmth are the same.
Renovation of the current
building is an important step.
Not only is student office space
woefully scarce on campus, it
is also woefully scattered. An
accessible concentration of
student offices would greatly
enhance student involvement.
Most importantly, Tresidder
must become an habitual
gathering spot. People must go
there to eat, meet old friends,
meet new ones. The Transition
must be rebuilt, renamed, re
vived. University finances are
the only means to this end.
Someday, our ASSU Senate
might meet regularly at our
campus center. Band rallies
might stop there. Students
might protest outside it.
But the University must
commit itself to a student
center before students will.
The University must recon
sider the path it took some
years ago.
