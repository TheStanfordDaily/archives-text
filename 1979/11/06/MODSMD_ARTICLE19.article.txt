Rape 'survey'
It has been called to my at
tention that at least one stu
dent has received a call from a
person doing a "survey" and
identifying himself as con
nected with our service. The
survey purported to deal with
"rape awareness."
We do not know anything of
the person or the purported
survey.
On occasion, we have either
done ourselves or aided others
in doing surveys in the Stan
ford community. At all times,
we communicate first by letter
or by other means clearly
identify ourselves in a verifi
able fashion.
If in the future, you are ap
proached by someone doing a
survey, however on the surface
well-intentioned, I would
suggest you ask for some
means of verifiable identifica
tion and institutional sanction
before responding.
Some make it a practice not
to respond at all to questions
over the phone to people not
known. Others ask for a phone

number to call back, and be
fore responding, check out
whetherthe person is pursuing
a legitimate purpose.
In our service, we would not
expect people to answer ques
tions of a personal nature to a
stranger over the phone and
doubt that any accountable in
dividual or organization would
either.

To debate all the issues
raised by Scott Zarrow and Eric
Miethke ("Conservatives
haunt 'Issues of '80s'," Daily,
Oct. 31) would take up too
much space. I shall confine
myself to saying that Soviet
theoreticians agree with us
concerning the growing milit
ary imbalance between the
Soviet Union and the United
States.
U.S.-Soviet policy makers
proclaim that the "correlation
of forces" between East and
West is increasingly shifting in
favor of the "socialist camp;"
the Soviets, in their own
words, aim at making this de
velopment "irreversible."
This prospect worries not
merely American conserva
tives, but also a great variety of
other people — including the
communist leaders of China,
Soviet dissenters like physicist
Andrei Sakharov, and above
all, millions of ordinary people
who do not wish to live under
Soviet rule.
Moreover, I object to the
tone of the column. The
speakers at the conference all
expressed themselves in
courteous and moderate lan
guage — their critics might do
the same. Instead they use a
very different terminology.
The authors describe the
conference speakers as "char
latans, witches and warlocks"
who turn "gold into crap," and
who supposedly advocate a
policy of "Nuke 'em till they
glow" against poor countries
in Africa.
If conservatives were to
write about communists or
communist sympathizers in an
equally mendacious or in
flammatory manner, there
would be complaints galore
concerning anti-communist
"hysteria," "divisiveness,"
"insensitivity," and "bigotry."

Conservatives are entitled fo
demand from their critics in
academia a standard of public
discourse equal to that which
left-wingers demand for them
selves.

The male role in the issue of
abortion is hardly ever men
tioned, in regard to Zach Nel
son's observations {Daily, Oct.
30), because in the majority of
cases it is always the women
who must bear the moral re
sponsibility for her previous
actions and the choice of either
keepingthechild ortoabort it.
How many men, college-age
or not, would also accept the
same responsibilities? How
many of these men would ac
tually care for and love the
woman and the child and give
them "respectability," i.e.,
marriage?
Nelson forgets that it takes
"two to tango," and where
men have not had the guts,
women have, despite censure
and heartbreak. I am angered
at the continual slinging of
mud on the woman who ob
tains an abortion, that she has
the rampant "freedom to
create and destroy" human life
out of overweening selfishness
and inhumanity, that she must
always, alone, lie on her own
bed.
Would Nelson involuntarily
quit school, become a welfare
mother, while your Phi Beta
Kappa lover went on to do what
he damn-well pleased?
Perhaps if part of the
sexually-active male popula
tion would consent to an equal
role in birth control, such as in
proven-effective and reversi
ble vasectomies, this would
help the situation.

many of these men would ac
tually care for and love the
woman and the child and give
them "respectability," i.e.,
marriage?
Nelson forgets that it takes
"two to tango," and where
men have not had the guts,
women have, despite censure
and heartbreak. I am angered
at the continual slinging of
mud on the woman who ob
tains an abortion, that she has
the rampant "freedom to
create and destroy" human life
out of overweening selfishness
and inhumanity, that she must
always, alone, lie on her own
bed.
Would Nelson involuntarily
quit school, become a welfare
mother, while your Phi Beta
Kappa lover went on to do what
he damn-well pleased?
Perhaps if part of the
sexually-active male popula
tion would consent to an equal
role in birth control, such as in
proven-effective and reversi
ble vasectomies, this would
help the situation.

Rape 'survey'
It has been called to my at
tention that at least one stu
dent has received a call from a
person doing a "survey" and
identifying himself as con
nected with our service. The
survey purported to deal with
"rape awareness."
We do not know anything of
the person or the purported
survey.
On occasion, we have either
done ourselves or aided others
in doing surveys in the Stan
ford community. At all times,
we communicate first by letter
or by other means clearly
identify ourselves in a verifi
able fashion.
If in the future, you are ap
proached by someone doing a
survey, however on the surface
well-intentioned, I would
suggest you ask for some
means of verifiable identifica
tion and institutional sanction
before responding.
Some make it a practice not
to respond at all to questions
over the phone to people not
known. Others ask for a phone

number to call back, and be
fore responding, check out
whetherthe person is pursuing
a legitimate purpose.
In our service, we would not
expect people to answer ques
tions of a personal nature to a
stranger over the phone and
doubt that any accountable in
dividual or organization would
either.

'80s defense
To debate all the issues
raised by Scott Zarrow and Eric
Miethke ("Conservatives
haunt 'Issues of '80s'," Daily,
Oct. 31) would take up too
much space. I shall confine
myself to saying that Soviet
theoreticians agree with us
concerning the growing milit
ary imbalance between the
Soviet Union and the United
States.
U.S.-Soviet policy makers
proclaim that the "correlation
of forces" between East and
West is increasingly shifting in
favor of the "socialist camp;"
the Soviets, in their own
words, aim at making this de
velopment "irreversible."
This prospect worries not
merely American conserva
tives, but also a great variety of
other people — including the
communist leaders of China,
Soviet dissenters like physicist
Andrei Sakharov, and above
all, millions of ordinary people
who do not wish to live under
Soviet rule.
Moreover, I object to the
tone of the column. The
speakers at the conference all
expressed themselves in
courteous and moderate lan
guage — their critics might do
the same. Instead they use a
very different terminology.
The authors describe the
conference speakers as "char
latans, witches and warlocks"
who turn "gold into crap," and
who supposedly advocate a
policy of "Nuke 'em till they
glow" against poor countries
in Africa.
If conservatives were to
write about communists or
communist sympathizers in an
equally mendacious or in
flammatory manner, there
would be complaints galore
concerning anti-communist
"hysteria," "divisiveness,"
"insensitivity," and "bigotry."

Conservatives are entitled fo
demand from their critics in
academia a standard of public
discourse equal to that which
left-wingers demand for them
selves.

The male role in the issue of
abortion is hardly ever men
tioned, in regard to Zach Nel
son's observations {Daily, Oct.
30), because in the majority of
cases it is always the women
who must bear the moral re
sponsibility for her previous
actions and the choice of either
keepingthechild ortoabort it.
How many men, college-age
or not, would also accept the
same responsibilities? How
many of these men would ac
tually care for and love the
woman and the child and give
them "respectability," i.e.,
marriage?
