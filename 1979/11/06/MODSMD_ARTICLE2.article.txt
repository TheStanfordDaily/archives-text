# Leftists organizing anti-KKK movement
## Klansmen jailed after shootings 
### 
Greensboro, N.C. (AP) â€” Fourteen
men, described by a judge as "immi
nently dangerous to others of the
community," were ordered held
without bond yesterday in a shooting
rampage that left five persons dead at
an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally.
The rally was an example of milit
ary resistance from leftist organiza
tions which the resurgent KKK has
been meeting in other states as well.
Persons outside the courtroom
said they could hear voices singing
"God Bless America"and "Onward
Christian Soldiers" in the holding
cell where the suspects awaited their
court appearances.
Four persons died at the scene of
Saturday's shootings in a predomin
antly black housing project. A filth
victim, Michael Nathan, a physician
from Durham, died yesterday at a
Greensboro hospital. Nine other
persons were injured.
Although one KKK member has cal
led the recent anti-Klan movement
the start of a "race war," skin color
was apparently not the issue in the
Greensboro incident. Four of those
killed were white. One was black.
"It wasn't one white group against
one black group," said H.M.
Michaux, a black who is the U.S. at
torney in Greensboro. "It was one
white group against another white
group that was trying to elicit support
from the black community."
Twelve men were arrested a few
hundred feet from the scene of the
shootings, where gunmen fired re
peatedly into a crowd gathered for an
anti-Klan march sponsored by the
leftist Workers Viewpoint Organiza
tion. Police seized a yellow van that
was packed with pistols, shotguns

and rifles.
Each of the 12 arrested Saturday
taces four counts of conspiracy to
commit murder. District Attorney
Michael Schlosser said before the
fifth victim died that he expected
other charges to be filed.
Two suspects were arrested in
Winston-Salem on Sunday. Each was
charged with one count of conspi
racy to commit murder.
The group which drew about 100
demonstrators to the "Death to the
Klan'' rally was the Communist
Workers Party, U.S.A., which until
about a month ago was named the
Workers Viewpoint Organization.
Espousing the principals of Marx,
Lenin and Mao Tse-tung, the organi
zation has been active in trying to
organize workers in North Carolina's
textile mills.
Another left-leaning group attack
ing the Klan with more than rhetoric
is the International Committee
Against Racism (INCAR), which was
born in Brooklyn in the early 1970s
and has staged demonstrations in
Virginia and Mississippi and
elsewhere in recent months.
About 20 INCAR protestors broke
through police lines at a KKK rally in
Virginia Beach, Va., on Oct. 5, grab
bed the robes of two Klansmen and
knocked another to the ground.
They burned the robes in the street.
It was two self-professed INCAR
members, a man and a woman, who
jumped up on a stage yesterday and
pelted New York Mayor Edward Koch
with eggs as he was welcoming 3000
persons to a meeting of the American
Public Health Association.
"Koch is a fascist," the woman
said.

In the meantime, the Communist
Workers Party said yesterday it will
conduct a funeral march for its slain
members in Greensboro on Sunday,
despite a city ban on parade permits.
A branch of the organization in
Pittsburgh scheduled its own "Death
to the Klan" rally for Nov. 26 at the
federal building in downtown
Pittsburgh, and another group called
the Liberation League is planning a
"Smash the Klan" rally on Friday at
Allegheny Community College.
Members of the United Auto
Workers (UAW) union at a Ford
Motor Co. plant in Dearborn, Mich.,
are calling for a "Smash the Klan Ter
ror" rally Saturday in downtown De
troit.
The Detroit rally plans grew out of
a resolution passed by UAW Local
600 calling tor the firing of two plant
foremen who came to work in Sep
tember wearing Ku Klux Klan-type
garb. The foremen were transferred,
but not fired.
In yesterday's court hearing on the
Greensboro rally, District judge
Robert Cecil ordered the defendants
jailed pending a probable-cause
hearing on Nov. 20.
He denied bond tor any of the men
after Schlosser described them as "a
band of marauders, 14 strong, who
descended on Guilford County and
cut a path of destruction that left
dead and bloody bodies."
In handcuffed pairs, the defen
dents were brought into the cour
troom to hear the charges and to tell
C ecil whether they planned to hire a
lawyer.
Most of the men stood passively
and said nothing except for simple
answers to Cecil's questions.
