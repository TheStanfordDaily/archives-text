# Political homogeneity sought
## Series explores nuclear issues 
### Jim Isaacs 
The debate over the use of
nuclear power is a controversy
that generates a lot of opinion
and a lot of emotion. And the
controversy has inspired a
of students here to put
together a unique, multimedia
series to explore the pros and
cons of the issue.
Every Tuesday night this
quarter, the Nuclear Politics
Film Workshop has presented
films, speakers or debates on
the topic of nuclear power. The
project of undergraduates Jeff
Hook, Cilista Eberleand Jeffrey
Kimball, the series has re
ceived the support of the East
Asian studies department, the
Human Biology program, the
Civil Engineering department,
Stanford Workshop on Politi
cal and Social Issues
(SWOPSI), the Dickenson
Symposium Fund and the Of
fice of Student Activities.
According to the students
who put the series together,
the Workshop has neither em
phasized any single issue nor
claimed to represent any par
ticular organization. Rather,
speakers and films from such
diverse perspectives as Friends
of the Earth and the Atomic
Energy Commission (AEC)
have presented a wide spec
trum of opinion on the use of
the atom.
The energy issue elicited
emotional responses from the
start. The introductory prog
ram on October 9 featured a
showing of Doctor Strangelove
and a commentary by Profes
sor John Barton of the law
s( hool.
Barton's principle thesis pre
sented at the workshop was
that although the prospects of
a total social disaster like that in
Strangelove seem far fetched,
they are not beyond the realis
tic possibility of occurrence if
we continue to utilize the
atom. Fhis set the goal of the
workshop: to analyze where
we are going and what risks we
are taking with nuclear power.
The next two sessions co
vered the safety factors in
volved in nuclear power de
velopment. The crowd was

humored by the simplistic na
ture of the pro-nuclear films
presented, but the AEC's posi
tion was defined more clearly
by Thomas Passell, the nuclear
division manager of the Electric
Power Research Institute.
Passell proclaimed that the
anti-nuclear movement is "the
greatest hoax ever perpetrated
on the American people." He
sighted numerous studies that
reported comparatively low
danger from nuclear power in
light of the problems as
sociated with fossil fuels.
Opposing Passell was An
drew Baldwin, the legal direc
tor of Friends of the Earth.
Baldwin proposed that since
private insurance firms refused
to write policies for nuclear
plants, the plants had been
found economically risky in
the marketplace.
The perspective Baldwin
presented in his speech was
supported by the film Incident
at Brown's Ferry, concerning
the possibilities of a
"meltdown" accident, and a
BBC documentary on nuclear
waste.
The workshop is set up in
such a manner that theories are
not just presented by the
speakers, but proponents have
a chance to interact. With at
tendance averaging over 100 at
each meeting, the program has
been highlighted by the some
times intense interaction of
audience members with the
speakers and each other.
Consequently Baldwin and
Passell each rebutted the
other's contentions. Passell's
studies, Baldwin claimed, were
based on citations of scientists
who have publically called the
studies "childish, unsophisti
cated shams." Passell in turn
pointed out that insurance
firms are increasingly involved
in the nuclear field.
The energy issue was con
cluded with an examination of
our energy alternatives. Nuc
lear fusion was examined
through a film and the techni
cally competent commentary
of Thomas Connoly, associate
chairman of mechanical en
gineering here. Connolly

sought to answer a variety of
questions to provide the audi
ence with a greater under
standing of the scientific issues
of fusing heavy hydrogen as an
alternative to normal reactors.
Solar power was advocated
by a pair of films and in a pre
sentation given by Gil Masters
of the department of civil en
gineering. Masters argued for
the economic viability of solar
power in the Palo Alto area.
According to his analysis,
when tax breaks and fuel sav
ings are measured, a net cash
savings occurs every year from
installation of a solar unit.
In general the solar propo
nents sought to implement
their systems from the bottom
up aiming first at tfie individual
homeowner.
This week the Weapons De
bate opens with a series of
films on the Hiroshima-
Nagasaki bombings. A film by

the U.S. Army will be jux
taposed with one by Japanese
director Akira Kurosawa in
order to offer a breadth of
opinion.
Next the question of perma
nent radioactive contamina
tion from both bombing and
bomb testing will be studied.
Dr. Roland Finston, director of
Health Physics here, is
scheduled to introduce the
subject of health risk and what
constitutes acceptable radia
tion dosages on Nov. 13.
The following week Dr. Coit
Blocker of the Arms Control
and Disarmament Program will
comment on a series of short
films concerning the perils of
nuclear escalation.
Finally, to conclude the
workshop, a panel discussion
will be held November 27 to
synthesize the various aspects
of nuclear power as both
energy and weapon.

series to explore the pros and
cons of the issue.
Every Tuesday night this
quarter, the Nuclear Politics
Film Workshop has presented
films, speakers or debates on
the topic of nuclear power. The
project of undergraduates Jeff
Hook, Cilista Eberleand Jeffrey
Kimball, the series has re
ceived the support of the East
Asian studies department, the
Human Biology program, the
Civil Engineering department,
Stanford Workshop on Politi
cal and Social Issues
(SWOPSI), the Dickenson
Symposium Fund and the Of
fice of Student Activities.
According to the students
who put the series together,
the Workshop has neither em
phasized any single issue nor
claimed to represent any par
ticular organization. Rather,
speakers and films from such
diverse perspectives as Friends
of the Earth and the Atomic
Energy Commission (AEC)
have presented a wide spec
trum of opinion on the use of
the atom.
The energy issue elicited
emotional responses from the
start. The introductory prog
ram on October 9 featured a
showing of Doctor Strangelove
and a commentary by Profes
sor John Barton of the law
s( hool.
Barton's principle thesis pre
sented at the workshop was
that although the prospects of
a total social disaster like that in
Strangelove seem far fetched,
they are not beyond the realis
tic possibility of occurrence if
we continue to utilize the
atom. Fhis set the goal of the
workshop: to analyze where
we are going and what risks we
are taking with nuclear power.
The next two sessions co
vered the safety factors in
volved in nuclear power de
velopment. The crowd was

humored by the simplistic na
ture of the pro-nuclear films
presented, but the AEC's posi
tion was defined more clearly
by Thomas Passell, the nuclear
division manager of the Electric
Power Research Institute.
Passell proclaimed that the
anti-nuclear movement is "the
greatest hoax ever perpetrated
on the American people." He
sighted numerous studies that
reported comparatively low
danger from nuclear power in
light of the problems as
sociated with fossil fuels.
Opposing Passell was An
drew Baldwin, the legal direc
tor of Friends of the Earth.
Baldwin proposed that since
private insurance firms refused
to write policies for nuclear
plants, the plants had been
found economically risky in
the marketplace.
The perspective Baldwin
presented in his speech was
supported by the film Incident
at Brown's Ferry, concerning
the possibilities of a
"meltdown" accident, and a
BBC documentary on nuclear
waste.
The workshop is set up in
such a manner that theories are
not just presented by the
speakers, but proponents have
a chance to interact. With at
tendance averaging over 100 at
each meeting, the program has
been highlighted by the some
times intense interaction of
audience members with the
speakers and each other.
Consequently Baldwin and
Passell each rebutted the
other's contentions. Passell's
studies, Baldwin claimed, were
based on citations of scientists
who have publically called the
studies "childish, unsophisti
cated shams." Passell in turn
pointed out that insurance
firms are increasingly involved
in the nuclear field.
The energy issue was con
cluded with an examination of
our energy alternatives. Nuc
lear fusion was examined
through a film and the techni
cally competent commentary
of Thomas Connoly, associate
chairman of mechanical en
gineering here. Connolly

sought to answer a variety of
questions to provide the audi
ence with a greater under
standing of the scientific issues
of fusing heavy hydrogen as an
alternative to normal reactors.
Solar power was advocated
by a pair of films and in a pre
sentation given by Gil Masters
of the department of civil en
gineering. Masters argued for
the economic viability of solar
power in the Palo Alto area.
According to his analysis,
when tax breaks and fuel sav
ings are measured, a net cash
savings occurs every year from
installation of a solar unit.
In general the solar propo
nents sought to implement
their systems from the bottom
up aiming first at tfie individual
homeowner.
This week the Weapons De
bate opens with a series of
films on the Hiroshima-
Nagasaki bombings. A film by

the U.S. Army will be jux
taposed with one by Japanese
director Akira Kurosawa in
order to offer a breadth of
opinion.
Next the question of perma
nent radioactive contamina
tion from both bombing and
bomb testing will be studied.
Dr. Roland Finston, director of
Health Physics here, is
scheduled to introduce the
subject of health risk and what
constitutes acceptable radia
tion dosages on Nov. 13.
The following week Dr. Coit
Blocker of the Arms Control
and Disarmament Program will
comment on a series of short
films concerning the perils of
nuclear escalation.
Finally, to conclude the
workshop, a panel discussion
will be held November 27 to
synthesize the various aspects
of nuclear power as both
energy and weapon.
The debate over the use of
nuclear power is a controversy
that generates a lot of opinion
and a lot of emotion. And the
controversy has inspired a
of students here to put
together a unique, multimedia
series to explore the pros and
cons of the issue.
