# Work week cut debated
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — For two generations ot
American workers, the 40-hour work week
has been a fact of life. But concern about high
unemployment is reviving a drive in Con
gress to cut the legal work week to 35 hours.
Legislation introduced by Rep. John Con
vers (D-Mich.) to shorten working time drew
long-time labor and business adversaries
back into the fray during House hearings on
the bill this past week.
The idea behind Conyers' bill is for Ameri
cans to share work when there aren't enough
jobs to go around.
Labor unions and other proponents say the
measures would create millions of new jobs
and relieve the nation of a huge social burden
that comes from carrying six million un
employed people on its shoulders.
Not so, counter the Chamber of Com
merce and other employer groups. They con
tend that workers would never go along with
a 35-hour work week unless they were
guaranteed 40 hours of pay. That would send
labor costs soaring, contribute to inflation
and ultimately result in fewer jobs, the oppo
nents argue.
Opponents also say the legislation would
not help solve the problems of two major
groups of jobless Americans — teenagers

who lack basic job skills, and women
homemakers who are seeking part-time
work.
Conyers, who represents a Detroit district
with traditionally high unemployment, wants
the Fair Labor Standards Act amended to re
duce the legal "normal" work week from 40
hours to .37Vi in 1981 and to 35 in 1983. Excess
hours of work would have to be paid at over
time rates.
The bill also would increase the overtime
rate from time-and-a-half to double time, and
bar employers from assigning mandatory
overtime except in "emergencies."
1 he bill is designed to make it more attrac
tive economically for employers to increase
their work forces than to schedule overtime.
Congress has not altered the legal week
since it passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in
1938, during the depth of the Great Depres
sion. The law reduced the work week from 48
hours to 40 hours, established a 30-cents
an-hour minimum wage and ordered time
and-a-half for overtime.
Today, the law, which has been amended
repeatedly to increase the minimum wage,
covers 57 million wage earners — about 60
percent of the U.S. workforce.
