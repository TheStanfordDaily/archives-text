# Empty evening at Rhinoceros
## 
### 
The Theatre Rhinoceros
has taken over part of the
threatened Goodman Build
ing in San Francisco and
turned it into a flexible and
intimate acting space. The
company's objective, as
stated in the program, is to
present "plays for and
about gays-Faggots." Their
current production is a
double bill of My Cup Ran
neth Over and T Shirts, the
third offering in a season of
plays by Robert Patrick.
Patrick says he is "Ameri
ca's most produced playw
right." It seems scarcely
worth arguing with this im
plausible and, in any event,
meaningless claim, but it is
true that in the Small Thea
ter Movement, for which he
is an enthusiastic pro
selytizer, he has a consider
able following. His reputa
tion is primarily based on
Kennedy's Children, a nos
talgic '60s trip. Last month,
Theatre Rhinoceros
put on a creditable
production partly rewritten
by Patrick inrehearsal,which
showed that the play still
stands up as social com
mentary, and still limps a lit
tle as drama.
Patrick's 1979 message to
his followers is that the
commercial theater is ter
rified, for financial reasons,
of offending any of its audi
ence and, therefore, at
tempts to avoid "serious is
sues." He offers as proof of
this the fact that Cassie was
offered a part in A Chorus
Line after a poll of preview
audiences revealed consid
erable dissatisfaction with
the original sad ending. Pat
rick, on the other hand, is
very keen on issues - really
into them in fact. Seen in
this light, the two plays now
at Theatre Rhinoceros are
very curious.
It would be a kindness to
draw a veil over the first -
My Cup Ranneth Over.
The central character,
Yucca, is meant to be Patti
Smith, and produces an ac
ceptable impersonation in
the three opening songs,
during what is supposed to
be her first successful gig.
The rest of the play deals
with the morning after the
night before. Yucca lives
with Paula, an unsuccessful
writer who wallpapers her
bedroom with rejection
slips from Cosmopolitan.
Paula is not pleased when
a succession of rock jour
nalists from the New York
Times, Newsweek and Rol
ling Stone call up to inter
view the newly celebrated
Yucca. The women argue.
What seemed like the 100 th
call turns out to be from,
you guessed it, Cosmopoli
tan. Yucca agrees to an exc
lusive interview as long as it
is written by Paula.
Unfortunately, while
Yucca can sing, neither of
the women can act. And
they are not helped by the
director's requirement that

they deliver 90 percent of
the dialogue over a loudly
ringing telephone. Even the
exceedingly well-disposed
first night audience of
friends and relations began
to plead for someone to
answer the damn thing. I
was sorely tempted, but
there were three in
tertwined couples on cush
ions between me and the
stage.
The second play was
much more interesting,
though only a little more
satisfactory as drama. About
Marvin, an aging gay
dramatist who can't get laid,
it is, I guess, loosely au
tobiographical. At least, I
hope only loosely. Marvin
lives with Kink, a carpenter,
and spends his time chang
ing from one wittily slogan
ned T-shirt to another,
drinking Scotch, and listen
ing to tape recordings of
himself masturbating —
"tickling the bad boy 'til he
sneezes."
The oppressive atmos
phere is lightened some
what by the arrival of Tom, a
hunky male model, who
apparently is the boyfriend
of the guy next door. How
will our two heroes per
suade him to take his pants
down?
Conveniently, it is raining
heavily and Tom's clothes
are all wet. Chance is a fine
thing. He is given a pair of
shorts with "melts in your
mouth, not in your hand"
stencilled on. But he just
can't bear to wear them. So,
the three boys while away a
dull afternoon striking nude
poses in front of the TV,
until the neighbor returns
and the male model has to
leave.
The above resume may
not do justice to some of the
finer points, perhaps. There
is some self-consciously
witty dialogue of the sort
you would expect — "Do
you think the revival of the
nostalgia craze will ever
come back?"
And Marvin makes a
poignant speech or three
about life as an overweight
gay playwright. Martin Xero
makes the most of the part
— and he certainly looks it.
But the issues? I wonder.
It is fair to say that the rest
of the audience seemed
happy enough. Plays on
everday gay life clearly have
a market, even if they are
devoid of plot, interest,
theme, wit or originality.
But it is a safe prediction, I
think, that the vogue won't
last if plays of this kind re
main content-free.
Patrick himself, strange
ly enough, knows the prob
lem, and articulates it well.
He is dismayed, he says,
that gays "can only get to
gether when they're against
something." But these two
one-acts are just proof of
that. They are anti-straight
plays, and no more.

are all wet. Chance is a fine
thing. He is given a pair of
shorts with "melts in your
mouth, not in your hand"
stencilled on. But he just
can't bear to wear them. So,
the three boys while away a
dull afternoon striking nude
poses in front of the TV,
until the neighbor returns
and the male model has to
leave.
The above resume may
not do justice to some of the
finer points, perhaps. There
is some self-consciously
witty dialogue of the sort
you would expect — "Do
you think the revival of the
nostalgia craze will ever
come back?"
And Marvin makes a
poignant speech or three
about life as an overweight
gay playwright. Martin Xero
makes the most of the part
— and he certainly looks it.
But the issues? I wonder.
It is fair to say that the rest
of the audience seemed
happy enough. Plays on
everday gay life clearly have
a market, even if they are
devoid of plot, interest,
theme, wit or originality.
But it is a safe prediction, I
think, that the vogue won't
last if plays of this kind re
main content-free.
Patrick himself, strange
ly enough, knows the prob
lem, and articulates it well.
He is dismayed, he says,
that gays "can only get to
gether when they're against
something." But these two
one-acts are just proof of
that. They are anti-straight
plays, and no more.

The Theatre Rhinoceros
has taken over part of the
threatened Goodman Build
ing in San Francisco and
turned it into a flexible and
intimate acting space. The
company's objective, as
stated in the program, is to
present "plays for and
about gays-Faggots." Their
current production is a
double bill of My Cup Ran
neth Over and T Shirts, the
third offering in a season of
plays by Robert Patrick.
Patrick says he is "Ameri
ca's most produced playw
right." It seems scarcely
worth arguing with this im
plausible and, in any event,
meaningless claim, but it is
true that in the Small Thea
ter Movement, for which he
is an enthusiastic pro
selytizer, he has a consider
able following. His reputa
tion is primarily based on
Kennedy's Children, a nos
talgic '60s trip. Last month,
Theatre Rhinoceros
put on a creditable
production partly rewritten
by Patrick inrehearsal,which
showed that the play still
stands up as social com
mentary, and still limps a lit
tle as drama.
Patrick's 1979 message to
his followers is that the
commercial theater is ter
rified, for financial reasons,
of offending any of its audi
ence and, therefore, at
tempts to avoid "serious is
sues." He offers as proof of
this the fact that Cassie was
offered a part in A Chorus
Line after a poll of preview
audiences revealed consid
erable dissatisfaction with
the original sad ending. Pat
rick, on the other hand, is
very keen on issues - really
into them in fact. Seen in
this light, the two plays now
at Theatre Rhinoceros are
very curious.
It would be a kindness to
draw a veil over the first -
My Cup Ranneth Over.
The central character,
Yucca, is meant to be Patti
Smith, and produces an ac
ceptable impersonation in
the three opening songs,
during what is supposed to
be her first successful gig.
The rest of the play deals
with the morning after the
night before. Yucca lives
with Paula, an unsuccessful
writer who wallpapers her
bedroom with rejection
slips from Cosmopolitan.
Paula is not pleased when
a succession of rock jour
nalists from the New York
Times, Newsweek and Rol
ling Stone call up to inter
view the newly celebrated
Yucca. The women argue.
What seemed like the 100 th
call turns out to be from,
you guessed it, Cosmopoli
tan. Yucca agrees to an exc
lusive interview as long as it
is written by Paula.
Unfortunately, while
Yucca can sing, neither of
the women can act. And
they are not helped by the
director's requirement that

they deliver 90 percent of
the dialogue over a loudly
ringing telephone. Even the
exceedingly well-disposed
first night audience of
friends and relations began
to plead for someone to
answer the damn thing. I
was sorely tempted, but
there were three in
tertwined couples on cush
ions between me and the
stage.
The second play was
much more interesting,
though only a little more
satisfactory as drama. About
Marvin, an aging gay
dramatist who can't get laid,
it is, I guess, loosely au
tobiographical. At least, I
hope only loosely. Marvin
lives with Kink, a carpenter,
and spends his time chang
ing from one wittily slogan
ned T-shirt to another,
drinking Scotch, and listen
ing to tape recordings of
himself masturbating —
"tickling the bad boy 'til he
sneezes."
The oppressive atmos
phere is lightened some
what by the arrival of Tom, a
hunky male model, who
apparently is the boyfriend
of the guy next door. How
will our two heroes per
suade him to take his pants
down?
Conveniently, it is raining
heavily and Tom's clothes
