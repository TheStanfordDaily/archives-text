## Peeking inside that wonderful world of Disney 
### 
It was not the sort of party at
which one would expect to
meet the director of Winnie the
Pooh and the Blustery Day. The
Korbel champagne flowed like
milk at a Mouseketeers' reun
ion, and Wolfgang "Woolie"
Reitherman, producer of ani
mated features at Disney
Studios, stood among jaded
film critics and assorted mem
bers of the press talking about
his work and himself.
"I got into the animation
business because I was impre
ssed when I saw pictures mov
ing," Reitherman said at a San
Francisco party last week pub
licizing the re-release of Fan
tasia and Sleeping Beauty.
"Where there's movement,"
he said, "there is life. No, that's
not exactly right, but I knew
that even Michelangelo
couldn't make his pictures
move."
Reitherman started at Disney
in 1933 as an animator on Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs.
He soon established himself as
a member of Disney's inner
core of artists, sometimes cal
led "the nine olcf'men" (a satir
ical reference to Franklin
Roosevelt's Supreme Court
appointees.)
"I've worked on Pinocchio,
Dumbo, Peter Pan and Lady
and the Tramp, both as an
animator and an animation di
rector," Reitherman said.
His directorial tasks in
creased on Sleeping Beauty
and 707 Dalmatians, and in
1967 he accepted an Academy
Award for Winnie the Pooh.
There was a short interrup
tion in Reitherman's career at
Disney — he was an ace pilot in
World War 11. "When Bambi
was released, the war was in
progress, the big one," he
said. "I'm afraid that most
people didn't want any part of
fantasy at the time. War was
heck, but I wanted to get in
volved, like everybody else."
When Disney died in 1966,
Reitherman became the pro
ducer for all animated features.
He also works on the de
velopment of animated pro
jects such as Disney's next film
The Black Cauldron, and a film
featuring the big-screen return
of Mickey Mouse.
"Oh, the innocence of all
those Mickey Mouse films!
They're what made Disney,
though," Reitherman said. "I
think irreverence is an impor
tant part of reverence, but it's a
cheap shot from this guy, Dan
O'Neill, who has done films
showing Mickey and M'nnie in
sexually compromising posi
tions."
Walt's ideas
Like many of the people who
worked closely with Disney,

Reitherman is his admirer.
"When Walt got excited about
an idea, he would thrill us with
his vision," he said. "I can't say
he treated me nicely, but he
always treated me honestly."
It has been said by those who
knew him that Disney often
was overbearing, and that
other artists at the studio were
sometimes submerged in his
personality. "I was the first
person to get full directorial
credit in the long history of
Disney," Reitherman said.
"The reason? I guess that's like
the prostitute joke — just
lucky, I guess."
Reitherman said that "Uncle
Walt" supervised every aspect
of the product. "He never lost
sight of the final goal, the
finished film," he said. "There
were disagreements, sure. But
I believed in him. His batting
average was pretty good, bet
ter than for most people."
Though Disney could be ir
ritating, Reitherman felt that it
was necessary to have a do
minant person at the studio.
"Somebody had to drive the
damn boat," he said. "He was a
very common man, from mid
dle America. He was brash
when young, but always
reached for things that were
beyond his immediate grasp."
Disney had the exceptional
ability to sense what people
wanted and what they would

pay for. "At the time of his
death, Walt was diversifying
heavily, getting more and more
into the parks and God
knows-what," Reitherman
said.
Disney's last
The Jungle Book was the last
animated film to come out
while Disney was alive. Reith
erman remembers Disney's
reaction: "When he saw the
rushes, Walt said, 'Let's get rid
of that sickeningly sweet stuff.'
One of the animators quit be
cause of it, but Disney knew
thefilm had to have good, sim
ple characters and situations. It
worked, because that's what
the Kipling story called for."
The director was concerned
about the rising costs of anima
tion. "It takes 24 drawings for
one second of film. Onefootof
film costs $2000," he said. "I
thank God for a period after
Walt died when we showed
that the feature-length ani
mated film was still a lucrative,
viable option. We had a
plateau period that showed the
best of what Walt left us — his
legacy."
Part of that legacy is a wil
lingness to experiment. Reith
erman spoke of using two
different-colored xerox lines
for the first time in the recent
release, The Fox and the
Flound, and the use of the mul
tiplane camera, a device in-

vented by Disney in the 1930s
to create a dimensional effect.
"As early as 1938, we began
mixing a naturalistic effect with
fantastical renderings, such as
the animals and dwarfs in Snow
White, Reitherman said.
"Some of the artwork seemed
primitive, but the artists knew
what they were doing."
Potboiler
He predicted a return to a
"classical" period, similar to
that which existed in the early
days of the studio, with the
next animated film, The Black
Cauldron. "It's based on a
Welsh folk tale. It's going to
take time and nerve to do it.
We want to do a great, honest
fantasy with a lot of emotion in
it."
Reitherman hasn't found it
difficult to manage the
animators at the studio. He
said that animation is a team
effort. "While some of the
animators are geniuses at what
they do, some tend to be a bit
eccentric. Sometimes, though
not often, their independence
has to be controlled."
Asked about the stories
which used to circulate about
the wild nature of Disney ar
tists, Reitherman was un
equivocal: "I think there were
some wild parties at the studio,
but we weren't abnormal.
Sure, we had sexual encoun
ters, but I don't think there

were many drug problems.
"One of the animators was
an alcoholic," he said. "We've
always had very talented
people at Disney, and some
have been different. One guy
was a child in a man's body —
but a wonderful, talented guy,
who happens to have written
several books. If someone
does good work, I don't see
what difference it makes."
Fantasy plus
There was naturally much in
terest at the party in Fantasia,
for which Reitherman did the
"Rite of Spring" sequence,
based on Tchaikovsky's music.
Fantasia is a good example
of the fact that when Uncle
Walt wanted something done,
you put your heart in it. "At the
time, I frankly thought he was
overdoing it with the evolution
of the world and man bit. I
didn't think the American pub
lic was ready for it, but as usual,
Disney was right."
"On Fantasia, Walt wanted
the whole enchilada," said
Reitherman. "The sound track
that accompanied the print
didn't please him like the
music did. So in each theater in
which it was originally shown,
a makeshift stereo system was
set up with around 15 speak
ers."
Reitherman felt that the
"Silly Symphonies" series at

Disney prepared the way for
the cinematic tone-poem, Fan
tasia. "That film represents a
voyage into the imagination,"
he said proudly.
Sleeping Beauty was another
work Reitherman contributed
to that had a Tchaikovsky
score. "We tried to match the
eloquence of his music with
visual perfection," he stated.
"In my opinion, Sleeping
Beauty represents a high point
in Disney creativity," Reither
man said. "The backgrounds
are so stylized and artfully de
signed it made Bambi look like
soft, fluffy stuff. Much of it waS
influenced by Brueghel (the
Flemish painter.)"
As in Pinocchio, the charac
ters were modeled after live fi
gures. He said that the film re
quired "tremendous time
consuming detail."
"A professional animator has
to be honest above all, and his
work has to come from the
gut," Reitherman said. He is
probably the best example of
his own preaching.
