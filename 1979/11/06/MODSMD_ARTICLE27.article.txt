# Raw' Asparagus': chills, thrills, hairy male skin
## 
### 
San Francisco theater-goers
tend to be monotheistic —
they worship the great god
ACT without recognizing the
existence of other companies.
Witness the demise of Wild
West ltd.'s Turning of the
Sinew last week, despite great
reviews and the promise of a
national tour. Those who have
$fi to spend on a theater ticket
refuse to do it more than four
blocks from the St. Francis.
But half the charm of seeing
a play can be in wondering
what you have gotten yourself
into. The Geary is predictable,
it not completely safe; the

Phoenix Theater is neither. At
an ACT performance, you
know that Peter Donat is not
going to walk down the aisle
and politely request that you
strap him into a straitjacket. At
a meeting of the Asparagus Val
ley Cultural Society, you may
be spat upon, or robbed, or
have knives juggled before
your blindfolded eyes.
Or, as I was, asked to strap
Penn Jillette (the star, if such a
term applies) into a straitjac
ket. The three cast members of
Asparagus, a play conceived,
written and performed by the

Asparagus Valley Cultural Soc
iety, take audience participa
tion to a new level. The As
paraguys don't pretend to bes
tow upon you a glimpse of
their privileged world; they
tease you, embarrass you, tell
you when to laugh, and pass
out posters after the show.
All tied up
Back to that straitjacket — I,
as audience participant, was
embarrassed. After several mi
nutes of tugging vainly at the
straps of a jacket designed for a
THO-lb. man, jillette (6'6", 215
lbs.) loudly called for help from
the crew. We couldn't spend

all night waiting for this skinny
runt to finish.
The Asparagus Valley Cul
tural Society does not, as a
general rule, have a very good
opinion of its audience. "We
can't say 'Ho' every time we
expect wild applause," is fol
lowed by a short demonstra
tion of proper applause cues.
"We're all stuck here together
for the next two hours, so why
don't we just make the best of
it?" Or, most telling of all,
"Don't you wish you were
downtown seeing a real play?"
Asparagus defies categoriza
tion. While it is theater, it isn't
really a play; its closest relative
is probably vaudeville. Jillette 112
juggles and purveys shtick; i
Teller wears tights and doesn't
speak while performing some'
amazing magic (especially hard
to do in a 20 x 50 quonset-hut
theater); and Weir Chrisamer,
Amherst grad, in suit and tie
through the show, serves as
straight man.
The claims of East Coast cri
tics that Asparagus is "com
plexly plotted" say more about
the perceptiveness of East

Coast critics than the structure
of the show. The Asparaguys
don't want quiet appreciation
— they're after helpless laugh
ter. Which, with few excep
tions, they get.
The exact appeal of As
paragus can be hard to deter
mine. Critics feel obliged to
justify their plaudits, to fabri
cate reasons for their complex
sensibilities being aroused by
the show. It's really very sim
ple. The Asparagus Valley Cul
tural Society takes a large
amount of good sophomoric
humor, adds thrills and chills
and some hairy male skin, and

plays it all off against the audi
ence's expectations. O'Neill it
isn't; but it does bear certain
affinities with Pirandello.
Asparagus premiered in 1975
at Princeton's Theatre In-Time,
and has been playing on and
off across the country ever
since. Much of the humor
seems designed for students,
and I especially identified;
Weir's SAT scores were identi
cal to mine, as it turned out.
But whatever your qualifica
tions, a night with the Cultural
Society is as much fun as San
Francisco currently offers.

Coast critics than the structure
of the show. The Asparaguys
don't want quiet appreciation
— they're after helpless laugh

The exact appeal of As

justify their plaudits, to fabri

sensibilities being aroused by
the show. It's really very sim
ple. The Asparagus Valley Cul
tural Society takes a large
amount of good sophomoric
humor, adds thrills and chills
and some hairy male skin, and

plays it all off against the audi
ence's expectations. O'Neill it
isn't; but it does bear certain
affinities with Pirandello.
Asparagus premiered in 1975
at Princeton's Theatre In-Time,

San Francisco theater-goers
tend to be monotheistic —
they worship the great god
ACT without recognizing the
existence of other companies.
Witness the demise of Wild
West ltd.'s Turning of the
Sinew last week, despite great
reviews and the promise of a
national tour. Those who have
$fi to spend on a theater ticket
refuse to do it more than four
blocks from the St. Francis.
But half the charm of seeing
a play can be in wondering
what you have gotten yourself
into. The Geary is predictable,
it not completely safe; the

Phoenix Theater is neither. At
an ACT performance, you
know that Peter Donat is not
going to walk down the aisle
and politely request that you
strap him into a straitjacket. At
a meeting of the Asparagus Val
ley Cultural Society, you may
be spat upon, or robbed, or
have knives juggled before
your blindfolded eyes.
Or, as I was, asked to strap
Penn Jillette (the star, if such a
term applies) into a straitjac
ket. The three cast members of
Asparagus, a play conceived,
written and performed by the

Asparagus Valley Cultural Soc
iety, take audience participa
tion to a new level. The As
paraguys don't pretend to bes
tow upon you a glimpse of
their privileged world; they
tease you, embarrass you, tell
you when to laugh, and pass
out posters after the show.
All tied up
Back to that straitjacket — I,
as audience participant, was
embarrassed. After several mi
nutes of tugging vainly at the
straps of a jacket designed for a
THO-lb. man, jillette (6'6", 215
lbs.) loudly called for help from
the crew. We couldn't spend

all night waiting for this skinny
runt to finish.
The Asparagus Valley Cul
tural Society does not, as a
general rule, have a very good
opinion of its audience. "We
can't say 'Ho' every time we
expect wild applause," is fol
lowed by a short demonstra
tion of proper applause cues.
"We're all stuck here together
for the next two hours, so why
don't we just make the best of
it?" Or, most telling of all,
"Don't you wish you were
downtown seeing a real play?"
Asparagus defies categoriza
tion. While it is theater, it isn't
really a play; its closest relative
is probably vaudeville. Jillette 112
juggles and purveys shtick; i
Teller wears tights and doesn't
speak while performing some'
amazing magic (especially hard
to do in a 20 x 50 quonset-hut
theater); and Weir Chrisamer,
Amherst grad, in suit and tie
through the show, serves as
straight man.
The claims of East Coast cri
tics that Asparagus is "com
plexly plotted" say more about
the perceptiveness of East

Coast critics than the structure
of the show. The Asparaguys
don't want quiet appreciation
— they're after helpless laugh
ter. Which, with few excep
tions, they get.
