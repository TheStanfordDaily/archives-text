# S.F. Symphony
## A

### 
Ihis year, the San Francisco
Symphony welcomes author
and musicologist Michael
Steinberg to its staff. Widely
known tor his work as the
music critic for the Boston
C/06e, Steinberg will assume
the post of artistic advisor and
publications director.
Steinberg's new duties will
include work on orchestral
programs, educational prog
ranis and special events. As
publications director, he will
write program notes and edit
all of the printed material is
sued by the symphony.
In tempo
A graduate of Princeton in
musicology and the recipient
of a Fulbright scholarship,
Steinberg brings keen interests
in criticism, teachingand "how
the music machine functions in
the world."
Steinberg said his job will be
challenging because he will
have to juggle so many consid
erations in planning an entire
symphony season. Particularly
interesting will be the problem

of balancing old and new,
familiar and unfamiliar music.
Other considerations involve
scheduling music that the
musicians want to play while
satisfying public desire to hear
age-old favorites.
An example ot this type of
balance is the March 19 sym
phony of Schubert with Berg's
violin concerto and the
Bach-Webern Ricernre trom
the Musical Offering. While at
first glance one might think
that the three pieces were un
related, Steinberg notes that
each can be linked to the
others. Berg and Schubert
both lived in Vienna, and their
music reflects the culture of
that country, while Webern
was a contemporary of Berg's
whocomposed in a -ery similar
fashion.
Steinberg looks forward to
solving these problems with
Music Director Edo de Waart.
Steinberg mentioned de Waart
as one of the reasons he chose
to join the symphony staff. A
longtime admirer of de Waart's

Steinberg said he felt "very in
tune with the musicianship he
(de Waart) represents."
Adagio
Although he has not been
able to construct any specific
plans, Steinberg hopes to ex
pand the symphony's educa
tional programs, of which an
integral part is the new build
ing into which the symphony
will move next year. The hall,
which will be completed in
|une 1980, includes not only a
main concert auditorium, but
also smaller rooms which
Steinberg plans to use for pub
lic forums, lectures and pre
sentations.
Steinberg also hopes to have
contact with the student
forum, an organization of
about 2000 college students
who attend subscription con
certs at special rates. Steinberg
said students form an impor
tant part of the audience be
cause they are particularly
knowledgeable listeners.
