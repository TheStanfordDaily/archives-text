# Francesco Trio exquisite
## 
### 
The Francesco Trio is an exc
lusive blend of musical chemis
try, consistency and cama
raderie. Bonnie Hampton,
cello; David Abel, violin; and
Nathan Schwartz, piano; con
tribute their supreme indi
vidual talents to the ensemble,
giving it an intrinsic strength,
mature confidence and brea
thing vitality.
The mutual respect and im
plicit understanding that exists
among the musicians was
immediately noticeable. This
musical symbiosis is the artistic
signature. The ensemble-in
residence performed last
Saturday to a full house in
Kresge in a concert of Beeth
oven and Faure.
Two Piano Trios in D major
and E flat major, Opus 70,
Numbers 1 and 2 by Beethoven
were performed.
The trio in D major has been
nicknamed the "Ghost," after
the mysteriously melancholy
largo movement, expressively
rendered by the trio.
Hampton's melodies soared.
Schwartz's pianissimos were
haunting, yet exact and clear.
Abel was outstanding in his
ability to coax the melodic line
along with a feeling of drama,
expectation and anticipation.
The presto, dynamic and
challenging in nature, was pre
sented with great stamina and
energy. The tempo would un

dulate and recoil with the
musicians observing the ac
celerandos and ritardandos
with synchronization. The in
struments would change
moods simultaneously.
The trio was joined by John
Graham, a violinist on a current
tour with the Juilliard Quartet,
in the Quartet in C minor,
Opus 15 by Gabriel Faure. The
first allegro was animated and
full-bodied. Melodic and
rhythmic motives gave the im
pression of "dots" of sound in
an impressionistic sensation.
Abel's agitating tremelos
would suddenly burst into the
theme, beautifully capturing
the elegant yet volatile nature
of the piece.
The adagio had a subtle
strength. Hampton's opening
cello passage liberated a stir
ring yet melancholy theme.
The adagio was pensive and in
tricate, and its vanishing point
ending was both enigmatic and
sensational.
The allegro molto was re
miniscent of the first move
ment in its energy and pace.
Highlights of the last move
ment would include the warm
solo passages of the violin and
cello, and the vibrant precision
ending of the piece.
The Francesco Trio returned
to Beethoven for its last selec
tion. The first movement of the
trio in E flat major had a quiet

consistency and a feeling of
control. Schwartz de
monstrated great command of
the piano throughout the
program, and demonstrated in
the poco sostenuto his con
centration, expression and
technical perfection.
The allegretto was majesti
cally performed. The fully
resonant pizzicatos of the cello
were outstanding.
In the next movement, Abel
showed his ability to execute
the most beautiful of melodies,
then to relinquish them grace
fully to the other instruments.
This trio is entirely deserving
of the widespread critical
acclaim with which it is
consistently received. The
Francesco Trio respects the
sanctity of great musical litera
ture in its accomplished per
formances, and in turn earns
the respect of its audience.
