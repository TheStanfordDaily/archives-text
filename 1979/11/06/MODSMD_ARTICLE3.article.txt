# Californians to vote on spending, busing
## Off-year elections held today 
### Associated Press 
Republicans hope to capture two
key governorships from the Democ
rats, and almost a third of the coun
try's predominantly Democratic big
cities are picking mayors in "off
year' elections across the country
today.
Despite strong Republican chal
lenges and the lack of any incum
bents in the races, the Democratic
candidates are still slight favorites for
governor in Mississippi and Ken
tucky.
Among the dozen top cities hold
ing elections, only three — In
dianapolis, Phoenix, Ariz., and Col
umbus, Ohio — have Republican
mayors now, and the Democrats are
expected to retain their edge.
Gil Carmichael hopes to become
Mississippi's first Republican gover
nor since Reconstruction. His
Democratic opponent is William
Winter. In Kentucky, former Repub
lican Gov. Louis Nunn seeks a com
eback against Democratic nominee
lohn Brown.
City hall races are being held in 49
of the 169 cities in the country with
populations of more than 100,000,
including mayoral contests in
Philadelphia, Houston, Cleveland,
Baltimore, San Francisco, Boston,
Minneapolis and Miami.
Feinstein runs again
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feins
tein, seeking election to the office
she inherited after the City Hall as
sassination of Mayor George Mos
cone, hoped a predicted moderate
voter' turnout today would work in
her favor.
A moderate to large turnout would
favor Feinsteiri, said sides who
reasoned her liberal followers
wouldn't vote as readily as the more
conservative constituency of super

visor Quentin Kopp, her main com
petition.
There are a host of other candi
dates on the non-partisan San Fran
cisco ballot, and the top tinishers will
face a run-off election Dec. 11 it no
one gets a majority of the votes.
Myriad issues
All Californians will vote on
propositions concerning
government spending limits and an
attempt to curb school busing, as
well as a wide range of local issues.
Both the Kentucky and Mississippi
gubernatorial elections are consi
dered important for next year's pres
idential race, no matter who the
nominees are. But for President
limmy Carter, banking pn a southern
support base, having Republicans in
charge of the state political machin
ery could be critical.
Govs. Julian Carroll of Kentucky
and Cliff Finch of Mississippi are
both barred by law from seeking new
terms, enhancing the chances of a
COP challenge.
Heavy stakes
The national Republican Party has
contributed $150,000 to Carmichael's
campaign in Mississippi, and presi
dential contenders Ronald Reagan
and John Connally have visited the
state to campaign for him.
But Winter, his opponent, is one of
Mississippi's better known and most
experienced officeholders. He is a
former lieutenant governor, state
legislator, state tax collector and
state treasurer.
Kentucky candidate Brown,
another sell-made millionaire
businessman, is a newcomer to elec
tive politics, although he has been an
active worker and fund-raiser for the
national party.
Nunn was elected governor of
Kentucky in 1 %7 when Republicans

were at their height in the state. Al
though Kentucky now has a Democ
ratic governor and two Democratic
senators, Nunn says he is stronger
politically now than he was in his first
race.
In Philadelphia, the nation's fourth
largest city and the biggest electing a
mayor today, Mayor Frank Rizzo is
heading for lorced retirement; he
lost a fight to change the city charter
to allow him to run for a third term.
Rep. William Green, the Democra
tic nominee, is promising Philadel
phia "new leadership and new direc
tion'' — a thought which has led
Rizzo to scorn the whole election as
"an awful choice."
The Republicans have a strong
candidate in former U.S. Attorney
David Marston, but two-thirds of the
city's one million voters are Democ
rats, and 40 percent are black or His
panic, who traditionally vote Democ
ratic.
Ohio woes
Cleveland is having another lively
battle in its political wars. Its comba
tive mayor, Dennis Kucinich, is up
for re-election after narrowly surviv
ing a recall last year. Republican It.
Gov. George Voinovich is given an
edge because he led Kucinich by
11,000 votes in the non-partisan
primary Oct. 2.
Kevin White was elected mayor of
Boston in 1967 and is seeking an un
precedented fourth term. Either way
the Democrats win — the only other
survivor of the non-partisan primary
is Democratic state Sen. Joseph
Timilty.
Former congressman Donald
Fraser, who gave up a safe House
seat last year only to lose the Democ
ratic primary for the Senate, is seek
ing a comeback as mayor of Min
neapolis.
