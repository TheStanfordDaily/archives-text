Nuclear plant freeze extended
Washington — The chairman of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) acknowledged
yesterday that certain nuclear plants near popu
lated areas may have to be shut down because of
potential problems in evacuating residents in the
event of an emergency.
Joseph Hendrie, testifying belore a House sub
committee, also announced that an NRC freeze on
new nuclear plants — imposed shortly after the
March 28 accident at Three Mile Island — is being
extended at least until spring.
He said the added time is needed so the recom
mendations of the presidential commission on
Three Mile Island can be fully examined by policy
makers.
The delay directly effects four plants that had
been scheduled to open by the end of this year,
and keeps another 88 plants which are now in
various stages of construction, in a holding pat
tern.
There are 70 nuclear plants now in operation in
the United States.
Rep. Toby Moffett, (D-Conn.), noted that a
number of the plants now in operation are older
and were built before the current policy of con
structing them away from populated areas was
implemented.
Ban on lawyer ads maintained
Washington — Ohio's ban on billboard advertis
ing by lawyers was left intact yesterday by the
Supreme Court.
The justices, without comment, refused to hear
the appeal of two Columbus, Ohio, lawyers who
contended that the ban violates their freedom of
speech. State officials called such advertising "be
neath the dignity of the bar."
Colorado and Tennessee specifically prohibit
billboard advertising by lawyers. In 14 other states,
the ban is implied as it is in Ohio by defining the
"print media" in which law ads can be placed to
exclude billboards.
Those states are Alabama, Connecticut, Dela
ware, Georgia, lowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missis
sippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Vermont.
The Supreme Court in 1977 struck down the
legal profession's longtime absolute ban on adver
tising, ruling that it violated lawyers' free-speech
rights.
Since then, surveys show that people are paying
less for legal help in communities where lawyers
advertise. But the surveys also show that only 3
percent of the nation's nearly 500,000 lawyers ad
vertise their services.
Court probe won't file charges
San Francisco — After nearly a year of investiga
tion, the Commission on Judicial Performance
ruled yesterday that no misconduct charges will be
tiled against any State Supreme Court justices, and
the governor says his faith in the high court re
mains intact.
"I believe the California Supreme Court is the
outstanding supreme court in the country," said
Gov. Jerry Brown in Los Angeles. "Nothing pro
duced by the commission has in any way altered
that view."

The commission undertook the unprecedented
probe after newspapers charged the high court
with holding up several sensitive rulings to give an
assist to Chief Justice Rose Bird in her confirma
tion bid before the voters last year.
The commission said the decision was unanim
ous.
The commission said it was forbidden by court
order from explaining its reasoning or comment
ing on the testimony and evidence it heard.
Carter to review shuttle project
Washington — America's space shuttle, dealt
another setback by an engine failure, faces a criti
cal cross-roads next week when President Jimmy
Carter personally reviews the troubled project.
A few months ago, the president probably
wouldn't have taken such a personal interest. But
the shuttle is becoming more and more vital to
national defense, and the White House is counting
on it as a major tool to verify Russian compliance
with arms limitation agreements.
Carter also wants to know about technical, fi
nancial and management problems that have
plagued the shuttle and about safety questions
raised by a team of White House consultants who
recently investigated the project.
Dr. Robert Frosch, administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, will brief
the president next week. He told a congressional
committee last week he would request a "several
hundred million dollar" addition to NASA's
budget to help put the program back on track.
Carter is expected to endorse the shuttle and
the extra money because of the national security
aspects.
The shuttle originally was to have flown its first
manned orbital flight last March. But problems
with the engine, electronics, thermal protection
and management have contributed to a series of
delays.
Ray attempts fourth escape
Petros, Tenn. — James Earl Ray, imprisoned for the
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., tried to
escape from Brushy Mountain Penitentiary yes
terday but was spotted crawling on his belly out
side the walls and captured, officials said.
Ray, serving 99 years for King's murder plus two
years for an escape in 1977, climbed three floors to
the prison's roof and then back down to the
ground outside the fortress before officials were
aware of the break.
Prison Sgt. Ray Tucker said a guard in a tower at
the southwest corner spotted Ray crawling along
the base of the wall on his stomach under a green
camouflage blanket at 2:05 a.m. Ray was about 60
feet inside a chain-link fence surrounding the
building, Tucker said.
The guard fired one shot as a warning and Ray
stood up, offering no resistance as other guards
darted out of the prison to take him back inside,
Tucker said.
The attempt was the 51-year-old Ray's fourth
effort at escaping from the 85-year-old white stone
prison in this mountainous coal-mining region of
east Tennessee.

A's transfer may be completed
New York — Tlje long anticipated sale and trans
fer of Charles Finley's Oakland A's franchise to
Denver may be completed before the end of the
month, The Associated Press learned yesterday.
The sale would bring major league baseball to
Colorado beginning in 1980. There were indica
tions that oil mnonaire Marvin Davis, the antici
pated buyer, has already begun assembling a
management team.
Al Rosen, who quit his post as president of the
New York Yankees to become an executive wi th an
Atlantic City gambling casino, was reported in line
to head the team's front office operation.
While none of the participants would specifi
cally confirm the transaction, they did not deny it.
Instead, they hedged, perhaps afraid of damaging
the deal which fell through once before, in 1978.
But the AP learned from a knowledgeable
baseball source that obstacles which blocked the
sale before have been eased and the deal is virtu
ally certain to be completed this time.
Comic artist Capp dies at 70
Cambridge, Mass. — Al Capp, creator of the Lil'
Abner, the comic strip that survived seven presi
dents and became an American institution, died
last night, his attorney said.
Alvin Hochberg, the attorney, said Capp died at
Mt. Auburn Hospital here after a lengthy illness.
He was 70.
Hochberg did not disclose the cause of the car
toonist's death.
Capp suffered from emphysema, a condition
which played a part in his decision to discontinue
his satirical comic strip of the adventures of the
hillbilly inhabitants of Dogpatch, U.S.A.
The comic strip disappeared from newspapers,
Nov. 13, 1977, when Capp retired. Going with it
were such durable characters as Lil' Abner, the
painfully shy and impoverished big-footed hill
billy, and Daisy Mae, his ever-pursuing and
latter-day wife.
