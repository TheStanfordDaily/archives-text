# Iranians still holding embassy hostages
## 
### Associated Press 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's fol
lowers, already holding scores of
hostages in the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran, seized two U.S. consulates
and the British Embassy yesterday in
an escalating war of nerves against
"the great Satan, America"and its
"evil" ally.
No injuries were reported in the
new takeovers in Iran, and it was not
known how many new American
hostages were seized, if any. The
British Foreign Office in London an
nounced last night that the takeover
of its embassy in Tehran ended
peacefully after six hours, apparently
following intervention by the Iranian
army guards, and no one was hurt. It
said more than 100 students had in
vaded the embassy, holding about 30
people.
The head of the Iranian Embassy in
Washington made clear the Tehran
government would not intercede to
free U.S. Embassy hostages. Ali Agah
told reporters the government "re
flects the demand of the people" re
garding the shah, and the student
militants who seized the embassy
Sunday could not be asked to leave.
The State Department estimated 60
American hostages were being held
in the embassy, and said it received
indirect assurances from the stu
dents that "all are well." Previous re
ports said seven or eight Iranian
employees also were held.
Iranian leader Khomeini and his
student supporters demanded the
United States and Britain hand over
two "criminals" for trial — the de
posed Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi, hospitalized in New York,
and former Iranian Prime Minister
Shahpour Bakhtiar, living in exile in
Western Europe.
But the Carter administration re
jected the demand that it expel the
shah, and the British said they did not
have Bakhtiar — that he was living in
France.
The shah, long a close U.S. ally,
fled Iran last January as the
Khomeini-led revolution neared vic
tory. He first went to Egypt, then
Morocco, the Bahamas, and finally
Mexico. Last month he flew to New
York, where he underwent gallblad
der surgery and is undergoing treat
ment for lymph cancer. New York
Hospital said yesterday that a tumor
in his neck has enlarged since the
surgery, and that more surgery may
be needed to remove a stone in a bile
duct.
The State Department says he was
admitted to the United States for an
indefinite stay but will not be allowed

to stay permanently.
Broadcasts of the government-run
radio, monitored in London, said
students seized the U.S. consulates
in Tabriz in northwest Iran and in the
southern city of Shiraz. The State
Department said another mob oc
cupied and ransacked the Iran-
American Society building, a cultural
center, in Isfahan, central Iran.
No injuries were reported, but it
was not known whether any staff
members were taken hostage.
The British Foreign Office later re
ported that students invaded the
British Embassy in an apparently
peaceful takeover.
The Carter administration was rely
ing on the Iranian government's ef
forts to secure the hostages' release,
department spokesmen said. But the
real power in Iran lies with Kho
meini's Revolutionary Council of
Moslem clergymen, and not with the
government of Prime Minister Mehdi
Bazargan.
