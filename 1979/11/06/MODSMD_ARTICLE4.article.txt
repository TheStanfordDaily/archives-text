# Status of sororities still undecided
## 
### Julie Kaufman 
The University decision last week
to allow sororities here to meet on
campus was not necessarily an indi
cation that those groups would be
granted official University recogni
tion, a status the sororities have
sought since applications were sub
mitted last spring.
The move was "really unrelated to
the recognition process . . . only re
lated in that we're still in the process
of deciding," said Patricia Brandt,
student activities advisor. "The feel
ing was that until a decision was
made we didn't want to make things
any harder tor the sororities."
According to Norm Robinson, As
sociate Dean of Residential Educa
tion, "There was no decision — this
sounds more active than it was." The
University has "relaxed enforce
ment" of its rule prohibiting on
campus meetings and is currently re
viewing the petitions for recogni
tion, he said.
Robinson said that some groups
have been meeting in dorm lounges
and explained, "All that happened is
that we're letting them continue
what they're doing, pending a deci
sion on recognition.
"This is not at all a step towards
recognition," said Robinson. The
decision is expected by the end of
the quarter.

Although the final decision on
recognition will be made by Dean of
Students lames Lyons, Brandt and
Robinson have been reviewing the
applications. Brandt is now in the
process of reading national sorority
constitutions.
Brandt and Robinson will meet
today to discuss discrepancies bet
ween the constitutions and Univer
sity policy, which was set down when
the Li-year ban on sororities was
lifted in December 1977.
Though the various group's con
stitutions are similar, they stress dif
ferent things, said Brandt.
"The main issue is local autonomy
. . . whether people outside of the
University can determine (who will
be a sorority member," said Brandt.
"The University allows some selec
tive groups, just as long as the selec
tion is done by the students."
Brandt explained that the delay
was intentional.
"I would rather keep meeting, talk
ing and trying to resolve the issues
now (than to say no and wait for re
application). We could just say no —
but I'd rather put the decision off.
"It's going to be a long-term deci
sion. It's better to put it off and be
sure of making the right decision.
We're really feeling the pressure
now," she added.

She explained that the reviewing
process is focused on the students
involved, not the national organiza
tions.
In contrast, "On some campuses,
the administration works with the na
tional sorority to the point of decid
ing which (sororities) will be allowed
to come on campus," Brandt said.
Brandt and Robinson will make re
commendations to Lyons after they
have reviewed the constitutions.
Brandt said they have Lyons' ideas
very much in mind.
"He has a critical eye. He's very
familiar with not only the written
guidelines, but with the spirit and in
tention of them," she said.
Brandt and Robinson agreed that a
decision not to recognize a sorority
would not be final.
"We would work with them to
bring about the necessary changes,"
said Robinson.
According to Brandt, "Any no'
would just be a description of what
needed to be done."
The factors to be considered in the
University's decision on recognition
include demand for each group, evi
dence of house organization and
management skills, the presence of a
qualified advising community, a pol
icy of non-discrimination, a high de
gree of independence from its na-
tional organization, compliance with
University residence policies and fi
nancial solvency.
In addition, educational and social
objectives must be consistent with
University objectives and goals, and
if provisions for a new house are in
cluded, these must be realistic.
The controversy over sororities
dates back to the early 19405. At that
time, large numbers of college-age
men were fighting in World War 11,
leaving more women than ever at the
University.
In 1943, there were five applicants
for every place in a sorority and the
rift between "hall" and sorority
women was deepening. Tension be
tween the two groups peaked, peti
tions were circulated and the Univer
sity took action.
Sororities were banned after a len
gthy study. The groups sold their
houses to the University and the
women moved into dorms.
The issue rested until the late 1960s
and early 19705, when cries of equal
rights were heard and objections
raised over Stanford's fraternities,
which had continued without inter
ruption.
The state enacted Title IX, prohibit
ing discrimination on the basis of
sex; and pro-sorority
cries had legal backing. In December
1977, the trustees voted to lift the
ban, giving sororities the chance to
return.
