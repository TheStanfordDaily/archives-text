# University, workers to enter talks over safety at SLAC
## 
### Steve Levingston 
A new wave of controversy has
erupted over health and safety stan
dards at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC).
The University and the United
Stanford Employees (USE) have ag
reed to settle USEift latest grievance
over health and safety through arbit
ration, but agreement ends there.
The grievance, which USE General
Manager David Novogrodsky filed
early last summer, charges that sev
eral employees at SLAC's Heavy Fab
rication Building were exposed to
toxic doses of hexavalent chromium,
a suspected carcinogen, while work
ing on the newly completed
Positron-Electron Project (PEP).
Novogrodsky expects the upcom
ing arbitration to establish that expo
sure did occur and views the arbitra
tion process as a means of gaining
improvements in health and safety
standards in general.
"What we'd like to see is a com
prehensive health and safety prog
ram set up. We don't have that. We
want to compel that through the ar
bitration process," he said.
The Univeisity's safety program is
satisfactory, according to Safety Of
ficer at SLAC Fred Peregoy, although
"there is always room for improve

ment."
The University has an "ongoing
industrial hygiene program as well as
safety program in which we (SLAC)
are continuously attempting to iden
tify areas of weakness and concern,
and keep up with new develop
ments, especially in the area of
health," he said.
Novogrodsky said he wants the
University to excell in safety. "We
would like to create a situation where
we (Stanford) become the same kind
of leader in safety as we are in a
whole lot of other things," he said.
A 13-point proposal to improve
health and safety conditions at SLAC
was submitted with the union's grie
vance. The recommendations in
clude a request for eating facilities at
the Heavy Fabrication Building that
are away from the work area.
According to Peregoy, a shop din
ing room for SLAC workers already
exists.
Novogrodsky said there are a
number of eating areas at SLAC but
none at the Heavy Fabrication Build
ing.
"The nearest is quite a distance
away, and you have to get there and
back in half an hour, and that's not
easy to do," he said.
Another recommendation calls for

installation of protective shields
around the cutting machines in the
Heavy Fabrication Building. Tom
Ramsey, a welder and worker rep
resentative on the safety committee,
said that "cuttings fly sometimes 15
feet away trom the machines."
Peregoy pointed out that safety
shields are available which he fre-

'Someone chops his hand off, seconds
count. Any place that carries heavy steel and
high voltage, somebody's going to get fried/

quently sees in use when he tours
the premises.
Assessing the 13 points as a whole,
Peregoy said he believes the Univer
sity has already implemented "es
sentially all of them."
The availability of first aid equip
ment in the Heavy Fabrication Build
ing also greatly concerns workers,
according to Ramsey.
"We don't have first aid kits in
these buildings," he said. "All we got
is bandaids." No one on the shop
floor is trained in first aid proce
dures.
"There's no reason the company

can't have a couple of guys out of
each department trained in first aid,"
he said. "Someone chops his hand
off, seconds count. Any place that
carries heavy steel and high voltage,
somebody's going to get fried."
Peregoy explained the University's
position on training workers in first
aid.

"We are not counting on anyone in
any of the areas to be trained in first
aid because we have our own on-site
fire station," he said. "Each member
of the duty crew has an emergency
medical technician rating which goes
beyond normal first aid training. And
that fire department duty crew is
backed up by Palo Alto paramedics."
The medical staff's philosophy at
SLAC has been not to keep fully
equipped first aid kits in the various
departments, according to Peregoy.
The University prefers to rely on the
trained personnel on duty at SLAC,
which includes a full-time nurse and

part-time doctor, to perform first aid.
"This kind of first aid kit that many
people have the notion is important
is not recommended by medical
people," Peregoy said. He added
that an untrained person using first
aid paraphernalia is likely to do more
harm than good.
Novogrodsky said he feels the
wide range of complaints brings into
question the health and safety polic
ing procedures at SLAC.
SLAC is operated under contract to
the Department of Energy (DOE),
which has jurisdiction over safety in
spections. Novogrodsky said he
would prefer the state and federal
Occupational Safety and Health Ad
ministration (OSHA) as the inspect
ing agency.
"One of the far-reaching criticisms
of DOE's own safety inspections is
that it doesn't have the resources and
clearly can't have the independence
of Cal OSHA or Federal OSHA,"
Novogrodsky said.
Ramsey said he believes safety
would be "1(H) times better" if OSHA
were permitted to inspect SLAC.
Peregoy defended the DOE policy.
Although the DOE does not have the
power to fine for safety violations
(OSHA does have such power), it can
threaten to break its contract with

SLAC.
Monetary penalties, according to
Peregoy, are not a great incentive for
the enforcement of safety standards
because the fines are usually of in
significant amounts.
Perogoy claimed that the DOE
makes more frequent safety inspec
tions than OSHA would. Safety in
spections have occ'ured consistently
at least once a month over the past
few years, he said.
"In fact," said Peregoy, "several
times this year we will have visits
from DOE representatives."
Henry Bowden in the External Af
fairs Division of the DOE San Fran
cisco Operations Office said that
from March 1979, when workers first
complained of possible exposure to
chromate poisoning, until this
month, there have been no
documented industrial safety inspec
tions and only one documented con
struction safety inspection of SLAC.
Bowden's figures also showed that
from October 1977 through February
1979 DOE made only three
documented industrial inspections
and three documented construction
inspections. Bowden added, how
ever, that DOE representatives might
have visited SLAC on other occasions |
but failed to write reports. J
