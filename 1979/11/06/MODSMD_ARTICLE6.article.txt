# Combat stress haunts Vietnam war veterans
## 
### 
Huntington, W.Va. (AP) â€” For years,
the men seem calm.
Then something sets off the guns in
their heads, the long-silent guns of Vie
tnam, bringing hack the trauma of
combat and reopening the festering
wounds.
Harold Mann, who was a medic in
Vietnam, held 27 persons hostage at
gunpoint in a tiny church in St. Albans,
W.Va., nine days ago. He surrendered
after making an obscene statement on
the radio in which he complained of
medical problems the military had ig
nored.
Clinical psychologists believe the
Vietnam veterans who explode so vio
lently are reacting to delayed combat
stress, the haunting return of the
memories and fears of combat in Viet
nam.
"These people are not crazy," said
Don Crawford, a Veterans Administra

tion official. "They've been
traumatized by war and need help to
adjust."
Little is known about the delayed
stress reaction. Researchers are just
starting to study the problem, and they
warn that Mann will not be the last vete
ran to explode.
"They have flashbacks ot injury and
death. In one case, a vet kept seeing
decapitated bodies after 10 years of no
problems," said Malcolm Farmer, head
of counseling at a local VA center.
"We've made a national error that
we're going to have to live with," Craw
ford said.
In an eltort to deal with delayed
stress and other chronic problems that
trouble veterans, Congress this sum
mer authorized the VA to set up Opera
tion Outreach. Under Crawford's di
rection, 71 special counseling centers
are being set up around the country.

The program was first proposed eight
years ago.
Larry Lapelle, a VA vocational coun
selor in Huntington, dealt with Mann in
a number of veterans programs. He
also grew up with Ashby Leach, the Vie
tnam vet from Huntington who held 13
persons hostage at the Cleveland
headquarters of the Chessie System
railroad in 1976.
Leach is now in an Ohio prison.
Mann, charged with kidnapping, is at
Weston State Hospital for psychiatric
tests.
Lapelle said Mann's "reactions were
quite normal."
"We just don't know that much about
these explosions. Maybe more contact
with Mann could have prevented it. But
there was just no time," he said.
Charles Figley, professor of psychol
ogy at Purdue University and a pioneer

in the study of delayed stress reaction,
described the phenomenon as the
eruption of long-simmering pressures
and memories.
Combat stress is not new, but Viet
nam veterans faced unique conditions
in combat and at home, Figley said. A
nightmarish guerrilla war in a threaten
ing, alien world and the nation's indif
ference when they returned clouded
their minds with feelings that have
never been confronted, he said.
"Delayed stress basically is putting
off dealing with an extremely difficult
period in life." he said.
"They're acting out of resentment,
the feeling that they gave part of their
lives and deserve some recognition,"
Figley said. "If you scratch any Vietnam
veteran, that hostility will come
through. Unlike veterans of other wars,
they never received any recognition."
