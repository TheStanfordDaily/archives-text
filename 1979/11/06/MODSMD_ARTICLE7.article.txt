# Politics threaten legalized abortion
## 
### Margaret Lane 
"The majority of Americans,
who are pro-choice, must be
alerted that there exists a seri
ous threat to safe, legal abor
tions," Karen Mulhauseur,
executive director of the Na
tional Abortion Rights Action
League (NARL), said yesterday.
Mulhauseur, who works to
protect abortion rights, spoke
on the politics of abortion to a
full Terman auditorium.
She identified the threat to
legalized abortions as "cohe
sive anti-abortion groups who
are allying themselves with
politicians, convincing them
that they must vote against a
woman's right to choose abor
tion in order to remain in of
fice."
Abortion opponents have
organized on the grass-roots
level, Mulhauseur noted.
"While the pro-choice al
liance relaxed after its 1973
Supreme Court victory, the
well-financed 'Right to Life'
minority began fighting to re
strict existing abortion laws
and apply the word 'embryo' to
the status of a person in the
Constitution," she said.
Movement stagnates
Meanwhile the pro-choice
movement has stagnated be
cause most people are una
ware of the problem, she said.
"They have nothing in their
personal experiences to rein
force it; the present genera
tion has forgotten that there
were 1,200,000 illegal abortions
every year in the 19605," she
added.
Mulhauseur called abortion
"a moral issue of concern to all
of us and a personal private de
cision." She maintained that
"it must always be safely avail
able in hospitals."
According to Mulhauseur,
anti-abortionists have suc
ceeded in restricting the av
ailability of safe legal abor
tions. Legislation prohibits the
use of Medicaid to pay for
abortions except in narrowly
defined cases, and similar re
strictions on other bills have
been passed, she said.
Amendments
"The ultimate goal of anti
abortionists is the passage of
constitutional amendments in
1982," Mulhauseur declared.
Such amendments would
make a woman who has an
abortion liable to prosecution

for manslaughter, she said.
Mulhauseur predicted that
natural miscarriages might
have to be proved in court and
constitutional amendments
might make certain methods of
contraception, such as intra
uterine devices, illegal.
Mulhauseur stressed what
she called the frightening
power of fetal politics. "Abor
tion opponents are strong
enough to bear candidates at
the election polls, and politi
cians realize this, she said.
Opponents seek to replace
legislators who do not agree
with their views, she added,
causing politicians to deal with
abortion politically, rather than
rationally.
"Politicians are not hearing
our story," she said. "In order
to keep abortion legal we have
to do it through the legislative
process and become involved
in election politics," she said.
Mulhauseur emphasized the
need for the various pro
choice movements to work to
gether to make their voices
heard in the political arena.
Human life movement
She called for "a true human
life movement that would pro
tect all of us, not just a human
embryo movement." She con
cluded that "we have a right
and an obligation to protect
health rights for ourselves and
our daughters."
Mulhauseur fielded ques
tions from the audience before
receiving a standing ovation.
The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) sponsored
Mulhauseur's speech through
the Dickenson Symposium
Fund, designed to help bring
controversial speakers on cur
rent issues to the campus.
