# Ruby To: life here after Vietnam
## 
### Mary Schmich 
Ruby To has been lucky in
misfortune.
On April 28, 1975, when
Ruby left her job at the end of
a normal working at the
American Embassy in Saigon,
she could hear fighting two
miles away. The next morning
when she turned on the radio
in her family's home in the
neighboring city of Cho Lon
she was greeted by the South
Vietnamese Prime Minister's
decree that all Americans
evacuate the country within 24
hours.
"I knew that if all the Ameri
cans weregoing, itwas time for
me to go too," she said.
If the American newspaper
she read upon her arrival in the
United States was accu
rate, Ruby was on the last
helicopter out of Saigon on
that fateful day.
"I guess I was just lucky/'
she said calmly.
Unlike other refugees who
spent many months in U.S. re
fugee camps awaiting the
generosity of a sponsoring

family, Ruby spent only ten
weeks at Camp Pendleton. In
1976, when she applied for an
assistant accounting position
in the University Alumni office
where she now works, she was
hired immediately.
Far from struggling to adjust,
Ruby said she has adapted en
thusiastically to the American
way of life; although she still
cooks Chinese food at home in
Sunnyvale, she confesses a
weakness for hamburgers and
french fries.
A Vietnamese citizen, Ruby
is actually Chinese by culture
and heritage. Her hometown,
Cho Lon (Big Market), whose
population is 90 percent
Chinese, is Vietnam's
Chinatown.
She said she retains vivid
memories of the war that rav
aged her country during much
of her childhood and adoles
cence and she recounts them
with a historian's precision and
often with a historian's dispas
sion.
Ruby said that as a city girl
she was spared the bloodiest
battles, a countryside spe
cialty. But she remembers a
1968 North Vietnamese inva
sion of the business district of
Cho Lon.
"Those offices and houses
weren't even militarily impor
tant," she said. "And there was
fighting all the time. Every
night when we would go to
sleep we would hear the sound
of fighting. Sometimes I don't
know how to describe it."
Three days after the begin
ning of that raid, a stranger
knocked on her family's door.
He asked if he could survey the
nearby from the.
top of the'To house.
Ruby said she was convinced
he was South Vietnamese. The
Americans stationed two miles
away who spotted him were
convinced he was North Viet
namese. They attacked the
neighborhood, partially de
stroyed the To home and drove
the entire population of the
area into 20 days of hibernation
in a nearby hospital.
"But that was just a misun
derstanding," Ruby said in de
fense of their American allies.
"It happened a lot. Nobody

was hurt. We were,lucky."
When an official at the
American Embassy offered
Ruby the chance to leave Viet
nam, she answered without
hesitation. She and her 18-
year-old niece would go, even
though her parents and her
two brothers preferred to stay
in Vietnam with relatives,
property and hopes for peace.
When a U.S. Navy ship de
posited her in San Diego she
had only a meager knowledge
of English. She has overcome
that deficit impressively in her
four years in the United States,
though she claims to have
shamefully neglected her En
glish classes.
The Stanford Alumni Office
has been a valuable training
ground, according to Ruby.
"In this office everybody
makes me talk. I didn't learn a
lot from school, but I learn a lot
from the office," she said.
If she wanted to, Ruby said
she could immerse herself in a
predominantly Vietnamese
community in her non
working hours. She estimates
that in the Bay area, excluding
San Francisco, there are at least
5000 Vietnamese immigrants.
Ruby married another Viet
namese immigrant in April.
She said she is nonetheless
wary of Vietnamese who seek
to reconstruct their culture
around the San Francisco Bay.
She called it a problem of
character not to be able to be
come integrated into American
society.
Most of the immigrants who
arrived at the same time she
did, she noted, are now pros
perous, employed and have
come to consider the United
States home.
Ruby said she finds Ameri
cans more polite, less emo
tional, more practical and less
altruistic than the Vietnamese
and Chinese she has known.
She said that this sometimes
makes her sad and sometimes
she admires it. In any case, she
said, she is being changed by
it.
"It is strange to me to see old
people living by themselves
even though they have chil
dren and grandchildren," she
said. She recalled one of her

first landlords in the United
States, "an 86 year old gentle
man who had to do all the
housework himself. I always
thought, if that was my grand
father I would go live with him
and take care of him." •-
She conceded that continual
exposure to similar situations
has made the sight less distres
sing. |
"Now I am not as sad a}> be
fore, but it still seems strange,"
she said.
Americans also have a Jiabit
of "oversaying," said Rutfy.
"For example you comeinto
my office wearing a new swea
ter. I don't like it but I Wfc>uld
say I do just to make yoif feel
good. In China or Vietnam I
would say it's OK, but maybe the
color is too dark."
She said she considers
Americans practical in thei/ re
luctance to lend money readily
to anyone who asks for it.
"At home if a friend is poor
and I have money I am sup
posed to lend money to her. If I
don't, people will think I am
bad, a snob."
"I have changed," she $aid.
"Before, I really wanted to help
everybody. If somebody asked
a favor of me I would dq| my
best to do it. But here, if I tfiink
I cannot do something, I wHI let
that person take care of him
self. I agree with the Americans
that everybody has his own
life."
Sexual conventions are cilso
different in the United States,
she said.
"Among the Chinese thefe is
always a distance between the
boyfriend and the girlfriend.
Vou are not allowed to do any
thing over friendship. And if
we do something, it's a big sec
ret."
She said she felt Americans
can be timid and skeptical of
the unknown. Take, for exam
ple, their reaction to the-
Thousand Year egg. Many
Americans cringe at the sight
and smell of this food Ruby
said she considers a delicacy.-
"You wrap it in dirt, and put 1
it in a spicy fluid for two •
months and when it comes out
it is black," she explained. "It
smells very, very strange but if»
you eat it, you will enjoy it!" . •

the entire population of the
area into 20 days of hibernation
in a nearby hospital.
"But that was just a misun
derstanding," Ruby said in de
fense of their American allies.
"It happened a lot. Nobody

was hurt. We were,lucky."
When an official at the
American Embassy offered
Ruby the chance to leave Viet
nam, she answered without
hesitation. She and her 18-
year-old niece would go, even
though her parents and her
two brothers preferred to stay
in Vietnam with relatives,
property and hopes for peace.
When a U.S. Navy ship de
posited her in San Diego she
had only a meager knowledge
of English. She has overcome
that deficit impressively in her
four years in the United States,
though she claims to have
shamefully neglected her En
glish classes.
The Stanford Alumni Office
has been a valuable training
ground, according to Ruby.
"In this office everybody
makes me talk. I didn't learn a
lot from school, but I learn a lot
from the office," she said.
If she wanted to, Ruby said
she could immerse herself in a
predominantly Vietnamese
community in her non
working hours. She estimates
that in the Bay area, excluding
San Francisco, there are at least
5000 Vietnamese immigrants.
Ruby married another Viet
namese immigrant in April.
She said she is nonetheless
wary of Vietnamese who seek
to reconstruct their culture
around the San Francisco Bay.
She called it a problem of
character not to be able to be
come integrated into American
society.
Most of the immigrants who
arrived at the same time she
did, she noted, are now pros
perous, employed and have
come to consider the United
States home.
Ruby said she finds Ameri
cans more polite, less emo
tional, more practical and less
altruistic than the Vietnamese
and Chinese she has known.
She said that this sometimes
makes her sad and sometimes
she admires it. In any case, she
said, she is being changed by
it.
"It is strange to me to see old
people living by themselves
even though they have chil
dren and grandchildren," she
said. She recalled one of her

first landlords in the United
States, "an 86 year old gentle
man who had to do all the
housework himself. I always
thought, if that was my grand
father I would go live with him
and take care of him." •-
She conceded that continual
exposure to similar situations
has made the sight less distres
sing. |
"Now I am not as sad a}> be
fore, but it still seems strange,"
she said.
Americans also have a Jiabit
of "oversaying," said Rutfy.
"For example you comeinto
my office wearing a new swea
ter. I don't like it but I Wfc>uld
say I do just to make yoif feel
good. In China or Vietnam I
would say it's OK, but maybe the
color is too dark."
She said she considers
Americans practical in thei/ re
luctance to lend money readily
to anyone who asks for it.
"At home if a friend is poor
and I have money I am sup
posed to lend money to her. If I
don't, people will think I am
bad, a snob."
"I have changed," she $aid.
"Before, I really wanted to help
everybody. If somebody asked
a favor of me I would dq| my
best to do it. But here, if I tfiink
I cannot do something, I wHI let
that person take care of him
self. I agree with the Americans
that everybody has his own
life."
Sexual conventions are cilso
different in the United States,
she said.
"Among the Chinese thefe is
always a distance between the
boyfriend and the girlfriend.
Vou are not allowed to do any
thing over friendship. And if
we do something, it's a big sec
ret."
She said she felt Americans
can be timid and skeptical of
the unknown. Take, for exam
ple, their reaction to the-
Thousand Year egg. Many
Americans cringe at the sight
and smell of this food Ruby
said she considers a delicacy.-
"You wrap it in dirt, and put 1
it in a spicy fluid for two •
months and when it comes out
it is black," she explained. "It
smells very, very strange but if»
you eat it, you will enjoy it!" . •


Ruby To
Ruby To has been lucky in
misfortune.
On April 28, 1975, when
Ruby left her job at the end of
a normal working at the
American Embassy in Saigon,
she could hear fighting two
miles away. The next morning
when she turned on the radio
in her family's home in the
neighboring city of Cho Lon
she was greeted by the South
Vietnamese Prime Minister's
decree that all Americans
evacuate the country within 24
hours.
"I knew that if all the Ameri
cans weregoing, itwas time for
me to go too," she said.
If the American newspaper
she read upon her arrival in the
United States was accu
rate, Ruby was on the last
helicopter out of Saigon on
that fateful day.
"I guess I was just lucky/'
she said calmly.
Unlike other refugees who
spent many months in U.S. re
fugee camps awaiting the
generosity of a sponsoring

family, Ruby spent only ten
weeks at Camp Pendleton. In
1976, when she applied for an
assistant accounting position
in the University Alumni office
where she now works, she was
hired immediately.
Far from struggling to adjust,
Ruby said she has adapted en
thusiastically to the American
way of life; although she still
cooks Chinese food at home in
Sunnyvale, she confesses a
weakness for hamburgers and
french fries.
A Vietnamese citizen, Ruby
is actually Chinese by culture
and heritage. Her hometown,
Cho Lon (Big Market), whose
population is 90 percent
Chinese, is Vietnam's
Chinatown.
She said she retains vivid
memories of the war that rav
aged her country during much
of her childhood and adoles
cence and she recounts them
with a historian's precision and
often with a historian's dispas
sion.
Ruby said that as a city girl
she was spared the bloodiest
battles, a countryside spe
cialty. But she remembers a
1968 North Vietnamese inva
sion of the business district of
Cho Lon.
"Those offices and houses
weren't even militarily impor
tant," she said. "And there was
fighting all the time. Every
night when we would go to
sleep we would hear the sound
of fighting. Sometimes I don't
know how to describe it."
Three days after the begin
ning of that raid, a stranger
knocked on her family's door.
He asked if he could survey the
nearby from the.
top of the'To house.
Ruby said she was convinced
he was South Vietnamese. The
Americans stationed two miles
away who spotted him were
convinced he was North Viet
namese. They attacked the
neighborhood, partially de
stroyed the To home and drove
the entire population of the
area into 20 days of hibernation
in a nearby hospital.

my office wearing a new swea
ter. I don't like it but I Wfc>uld
say I do just to make yoif feel
good. In China or Vietnam I
would say it's OK, but maybe the
color is too dark."
She said she considers
Americans practical in thei/ re
luctance to lend money readily
to anyone who asks for it.
"At home if a friend is poor
and I have money I am sup
posed to lend money to her. If I
don't, people will think I am
bad, a snob."
"I have changed," she $aid.
"Before, I really wanted to help
everybody. If somebody asked
a favor of me I would dq| my
best to do it. But here, if I tfiink
I cannot do something, I wHI let
that person take care of him
self. I agree with the Americans
that everybody has his own
life."
Sexual conventions are cilso
different in the United States,
she said.
"Among the Chinese thefe is
always a distance between the
boyfriend and the girlfriend.
Vou are not allowed to do any
thing over friendship. And if
we do something, it's a big sec
ret."
She said she felt Americans
can be timid and skeptical of
the unknown. Take, for exam
ple, their reaction to the-
Thousand Year egg. Many
Americans cringe at the sight
and smell of this food Ruby
said she considers a delicacy.-
"You wrap it in dirt, and put 1
it in a spicy fluid for two •
months and when it comes out
it is black," she explained. "It
smells very, very strange but if»
you eat it, you will enjoy it!" . •
