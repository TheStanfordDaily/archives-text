# Kucinich loses bid in mayoral election
## 
### Associated Press 
Dennis the maverick
mayor who withstood a recall elec
tion and two defaults on Cleveland's
city debt, lost his bid for a second
term yesterday while Democrats
turned aside spirited Republican
challenges to retain governorships in
Kentucky and Mississippi.
]ohn Brown, a flamboyant mil
lionaire businessman, defeated
former Republican Gov. Louie Nunn
in Kentucky, while former Lt. Gov.
William Winter won in Mississippi.
Ohio's Republican lieutenant gov
ernor, George Voinovich, led
Kucinich, a tart-tongued anti
establishment Democrat, 87,501 to
68,406 with more than 90 percent of
Cleveland's vote counted.
"We sacrificed the mayor's office
because we refused to bow and serve
to the money power of this commun
ity," Kucinich told his disappointed
supporters.
The nation's voters selected do
zens of big city mayors in yesterday's
"off-year" elections.
In Philadelphia, former U.S. Rep.
William Green easily defeated Re
publican David Marston in the race
to succeed Mayor Frank Rizzo.
Boston Mayor Kevin White was
reelected to an unprecedented
fourth term, defeating a fellow
Democrat, state Sen. Joseph Timilty.
Former Rep. Donald Fraser, a
Democrat, won the Minneapolis
mayoral race against a field including
former Mayor Charles Stenvig, and
Mayor Ted Wilson easily won reelec
tion in Salt Lake Citv.

In Mississippi, Winter thwarted
Republican Gil Carmichael's bid to
end 11 decades of Democratic con
trol of the governorship.
In Kentucky, Brown took a con
vincing victory over Nunn. With 95
percent of the votes counted, Brown
led by 531,624 to 368,137.
Kentucky Gov. Julian Carroll, like
Gov. Cliff Finch of Mississippi and
Rizzo in Philadelphia, was barred by
law from re-election.
Mayors were being elected in 49 of
the 163 cities with populations of
more than 100.000.
In Gary, Ind., Democrat Richard
Hatcher won a third term, as
did Republican Margaret Hance of
Phoenix and Republican Tom Moody
of Columbus, Ohio.
Tuesday's elections fell in the
midst of a spate of presidential an
nouncements. Democrat Edward
Kennedy plans to announce his can
didacy today, followed by Democrat
Jerry Brown, and next week by Re
publican Ronald Reagan.
Municipal elections traditionally
provide an off-year test of voter sen
timent. Democrats control most city
governments, and slippage there is
generally taken as a bellwether of
things to come.
Mississippi and Kentucky also
were considered important because
of 1980 presidential implications.
Both were key to President Jimmy
Carter's election in 1976, and Repub
lican control of their state machinery
in 1980 could cause problems for any
Democratic nominee.
