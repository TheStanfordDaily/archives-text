# Prof pushes closer U.S.-China relations

### Nancy Silbergeld 
To maintain a balance of world power,
the United States should pursue a policy of
closer relations with China, Klaus
Menhart, West German professor and
media personality said here last week.
"I have learned that if you want to have
an equilibrium, tilt toward the weaker and
not the stronger country; always try to
bring out the balance," he said.
Menhart, who has been a professor at
the University of Hawaii, UC-Berkeley and
St. )ohn's University, is a well-known radio
and television commentator.
China is the weakest of the three major
powers — the Soviet Union, the United
States and China — and U.S. power is de
clining relative to Soviet power, he said.
"China is receptive to the U.S. for their
modernization and Westernization," he
noted. If the United States does not seek
to expand ties with China, "I fear that the

Chinese may lean toward the Russians in
stead of the United States," he added.
Tide against USSR
Nevertheless the tide of ideas in the
world is surely running against the Soviet
Union, Menhart said.
"Marx did not predict the managerial
class, a professional intelligentsia which is
growing in numbers," he said.
"In the 19605, the ideology of the new
left marked the rise of a communistically
inclined generation over all the campuses
of the world. The USSR could have chan
neled this to their own interests. Instead
they opposed the movement," he noted.
Ideology is therefore ineffective in
Soviet moves to expand influence,
Menhart said.
"The USSR realizes that they can perse
vere in the world only through the
strength of their arms," he said.
"They have the strongest army that has

ever existed with regard to discipline, big
ness and armament," he said.
China closer
China, on the other hand, may be closer
to the United States ideologically, while
also posing less of a threat militarily.
"At the end of 1978, there was a kind of
euphoria in China. The methods of
capitalism were thought to be the
methods of industrialism," Menhart said.
Vice Premier Deng Xiao-ping's practical
and intellectual direction symbolizes this
exciting euphoria, he said.
Recent Soviet moves supporting Viet
nam and China's war with Vietnam served
as a turning point in Chinese attitudes,
Menhart said.
The United States should not stay
equidistant between the two other major
powers but should cultivate closer ties
with China, so as to preserve a global ba
lance, he said.
