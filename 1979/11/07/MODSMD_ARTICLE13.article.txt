# Infants struggle for life in refugee camps

SaKaew, Thailand (AP) —
There is an unexpected sound
among the sighing and cough
ing at the refugee hospital here
— the squall of newborn
babies struggling for life in a
world of the sick and dying.
At this camp jammed with
30,000 Cambodians the babies
are born too weak, too thin,
wizened like old men, many
destined to die within days
from the starvation and disease
that sapped their mothers'
strength.
Twenty infants were born in
the camp's first week of opera
tion, but many were doomed
before their lives began. Some

are born already suffering from
malaria, transmitted through
their mothers' bloodstreams,
an unusual phenomenon ob
served by doctors here.
The newborns who do not
survive are part of a daily death
toll that fluctuates sharply — 42
on Friday, 25 on Saturday — in
this camp 50 miles west of the
Cambodian border.
Margaret Boothby, an Au
stralian volunteer nurse at the
makeshift hospital, said one
baby died of malnutrition
shortly after his birth this
weekend. "I tried to help, but I
was too late."
But she found another child

— and this, the smallest one in
camp, may live.
"At first I thought it was just a
pile of clothes" — but when
she looked more closely at the
pile of black cloth she tound a
tiny, wrinkled boy, his arms
thinner than a woman's finger.
He weighed little more than
two pounds, but he has begun
to gain a little and may be one
of the survivors.
Boothby tried to pull
the tiny boy away, but his
mother, 26-year-old Vang of
Cambodia's Battambang pro
vince, clutched him to her and
cried out, "Who's taking my
baby?"
"I thought someone was try
ing to steal my baby," Yang
said later from her place on a
straw mat rolled out on the
hospital's dirt floor.
She was half-paralyzed from
a stroke and grotesquely swol
len from disease, lying there

among the terribly emaciated
patients. There are 2000 people
here seriously ill with malaria,
tuberculosis and the ever
present severe malnutrition.
Vang was too ill to feed her
baby and nurse Boothby gave
»he child hourly bottles.
Fighting between troops of
the Vietnam-backed govern
ment of Heng Samrin and
guerrillas of the deposed Pol
Pot has driven hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians into
the hiils, many of them eventu
ally finding sanctuary in Thai
land at camps like this. The dis
ruptions of war have caused a
massive famine.
Yang was already weak and
ill by the time the warning
came, but her husband carried
her and their baby into the
jungle with the rest of the villa
gers, along with their mal
nourished 10-year-old daugh
ter and 8-vear-old son.
