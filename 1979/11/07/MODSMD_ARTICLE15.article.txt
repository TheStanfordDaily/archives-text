# Junipero: Asian American home 'a place to live and learn'
## 
### Rose Chan 
While Junipero House in
Wilbur Hall is "first and
foremost a dorm," according
to many of the residents it is a
dorm that offers a unique edu
cational environment.
The theme house's program
focuses on the Asian experi
ence in America through a
calendar of film showings,
speeches, outings, discussions
and other dorm activities.
Junipero is also the meeting
place of Asian American
groups on campus.
"Junipero's a place to live
and learn," said freshman Ann
Thompson. "What more could
a freshman ask for?"
"It's a new experience for
both camps" — the whites who
are used to being the majority
and the non-whites who are
usually minorities, according
to Lisa Pan, a theme associate in
the house. About 50 percent of
the Junipero residents are of
Asian descent.
The Asian American theme
house was founded in 1971 to

correct "the traditional hous
ing systems' deficiencies viz.
Asian Americans," according
to the proposal.
In addition to alleviating
those problems, the house
would increase the awareness
of all students of the multi
cultural natureof lite in the Un
ited States and would give both
whites and non-whites an op
portunity to examine and re
solve differences in their lite
styles.
But the proposal also pre
sented the need for many
Asian American students to live
together in proximity to coun
teract the "sense of isolation
they feel in a university and re
sidence system which is over
whelmingly white.
"The isolated Asian Ameri
can is placed on the social and
psychological defensive. He or
she has to repress personal
characteristics and culturally
tied values to conform and to
survive in the environment,"
wrote the proposal committee.
The emphasis of fall quarter

activities is on personal roots
and the family. Winter takes a
look at art, culture and the
media; and spring focuses on
community issues.
"Living in a theme house,
you get into sensitive issues,"
said housing associate (RA)
Linda Shaw. The negative feel
ing for ethnic theme house life
which some students have may
stem from a reluctance to deal
with political and racial issues,
suggested Pan. )unipero's
reputation as a last-choice
dorm js also not helped by its
location in Wilbur Hall, when
compared to high-priority
theme houses on the Row.
The proposal for the Asian
American house, however,
specifically suggested either
Wilbur or Stern to encourage
high interaction with other
dorms in the complex and to
prevent house introversion.
"There may be a danger of
living in an enclosed commun
ity," said Pan, "but it really de
pends on the individual."
House activities are open to

the University community and
are publicized to encourage at
tendance.
Most residents feel a strong
sense ot community at )unip
ero. "The theme adds so much
to the dorm," said RA Kiyo
Nlagatami. "As a staff, we were
worried abouj people feeling
alienated. But I feel that the
closeness in lunipero is much
more apparent here than it had
been in other Wilbur dorms at
this time of the year."
"I think the main differences
are the things people talk ab
out,'' said David Hung, a Teach
ing Assistant in lunipero. "In
other dorms you don't often
find people who talk about iden
tity and where you come from."
"Everybody has roots, and
we're not just talking about
Asian Americans," said resi
dent Diana Swift. "Everyone
feels part of it. There isn't really
any alienation."
When the proposal was
made in 1971, "The time was
different and the students
were different," said Kei

Betu, witeot Junipero's first re
sident fellow- Anthropology
Prof. Harumi Betu. "There was
still very much of a radical
movement among Asian stu
dents and some of them were
quite political. Since then
much of that has worn down.
There were even factions
among Asian American stu
dents.
"There were no precedents
to follow, and the dean's office
did not have anything specific
to give us. We had to devise
plans as we went along. We
worked very hard, so there was
some amount of physical dis
comfort — and a great amount
of satisfaction," she con
tinued.
Even with the precedents
set, this year's all-new resi
dence staff is working hard,
especially since none of them
have had any experience with
running an undergraduate
dorm or a theme program.
"We're learning on the job
but we're finding it exiciting,"
said Resident Fellow David

his second year at the Graduate
School of Business. Working
with him is his wife Carol, a
nutritionist who is working for
a law degree at the University
ot San Francisco, and a staff of
four RAs and tour theme as
sociates.
Chin, a post-doctoral fellow in

Foci change, but the Asian
American theme house is still
basically "a way tor Asian Ameri
cans to learn more about them
selves" in the words of the
proposal, "and tor non-Asians to
get an understanding of what
growing up as an Asian Ameri
can is like."

(unipero House was founded in 1971 to increase awareness of all
University students about the "multi-cultural nature of life in the
United States."
While Junipero House in
Wilbur Hall is "first and
foremost a dorm," according
to many of the residents it is a
dorm that offers a unique edu
cational environment.
The theme house's program
focuses on the Asian experi
ence in America through a
calendar of film showings,
speeches, outings, discussions
and other dorm activities.
Junipero is also the meeting
place of Asian American
groups on campus.
"Junipero's a place to live
and learn," said freshman Ann
Thompson. "What more could
a freshman ask for?"
"It's a new experience for
both camps" — the whites who
are used to being the majority
and the non-whites who are
usually minorities, according
to Lisa Pan, a theme associate in
the house. About 50 percent of
the Junipero residents are of
Asian descent.
The Asian American theme
house was founded in 1971 to

correct "the traditional hous
ing systems' deficiencies viz.
Asian Americans," according
to the proposal.
In addition to alleviating
those problems, the house
would increase the awareness
of all students of the multi
cultural natureof lite in the Un
ited States and would give both
whites and non-whites an op
portunity to examine and re
solve differences in their lite
styles.
But the proposal also pre
sented the need for many
Asian American students to live
together in proximity to coun
teract the "sense of isolation
they feel in a university and re
sidence system which is over
whelmingly white.
"The isolated Asian Ameri
can is placed on the social and
psychological defensive. He or
she has to repress personal
characteristics and culturally
tied values to conform and to
survive in the environment,"
wrote the proposal committee.
The emphasis of fall quarter

activities is on personal roots
and the family. Winter takes a
look at art, culture and the
media; and spring focuses on
community issues.
"Living in a theme house,
you get into sensitive issues,"
said housing associate (RA)
Linda Shaw. The negative feel
ing for ethnic theme house life
which some students have may
stem from a reluctance to deal
with political and racial issues,
suggested Pan. )unipero's
reputation as a last-choice
dorm js also not helped by its
location in Wilbur Hall, when
compared to high-priority
theme houses on the Row.
The proposal for the Asian
American house, however,
specifically suggested either
Wilbur or Stern to encourage
high interaction with other
dorms in the complex and to
prevent house introversion.
"There may be a danger of
living in an enclosed commun
ity," said Pan, "but it really de
pends on the individual."
House activities are open to

the University community and
are publicized to encourage at
tendance.
Most residents feel a strong
sense ot community at )unip
ero. "The theme adds so much
to the dorm," said RA Kiyo
Nlagatami. "As a staff, we were
worried abouj people feeling
alienated. But I feel that the
closeness in lunipero is much
more apparent here than it had
been in other Wilbur dorms at
this time of the year."
"I think the main differences
are the things people talk ab
out,'' said David Hung, a Teach
ing Assistant in lunipero. "In
other dorms you don't often
find people who talk about iden
tity and where you come from."
"Everybody has roots, and
we're not just talking about
Asian Americans," said resi
dent Diana Swift. "Everyone
feels part of it. There isn't really
any alienation."
When the proposal was
made in 1971, "The time was
different and the students
were different," said Kei

Betu, witeot Junipero's first re
sident fellow- Anthropology
Prof. Harumi Betu. "There was
still very much of a radical
movement among Asian stu
dents and some of them were
quite political. Since then
much of that has worn down.
There were even factions
among Asian American stu
dents.
"There were no precedents
to follow, and the dean's office
