# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Rachelle Marshall What were lessons of Vietnam? 
### 
Marc Rosaaen's column
(Daily, Nov. 2) condemns U.S.
policy-makers for not pursuing
total victory in Vietnam and for
refraining from more active in
tervention against the Russians
in various parts of the world.
But his arguments are based on
errors of fact as well as in
terpretation.
He implies that South Viet
nam as well as Cambodia suf
fered a bloodbath as a result of
our withdrawal, and adds that
"KyThieu democracy was no
prize but it was preferable to
death by relocation."
Indochina did indeed en
dure a bloodbath, but it took
place during the years when
the United States was dropping
seven million tons of bombs on
the inhabitants and destroy
ing their forests and farmlands
with 19 million gallons of
chemical defoliants.
There was no democracy
under Thieu and Ky (whose
hero was Adolph Hitler), and
relocation was the policy car
ried out by U.S. forces in an
attempt to crush Vietnamese
resistance in the countryside.
First we herded villagers into
"strategic hamlets," and when
that failed we turned to "forced
urbanization," a process in
which villages and towns were
systematically destroyed and
their inhabitants forced to flee
to the cities. An estimated fen
million Indochinese were dri
ven from their homes during
the war.
1 here was no "bloodbath" in
Vietnam after our withdrawal.
On the cfay U.S. forces left,
Vietnamese cities were choked
with people who had de
pended on the American milit
ary establishment for their
livelihoods.
U.S. shipments of rice and
other necessities were sud
denly cut off. Agricultural areas
had been devastated and fish
ing grounds rendered useless
by mines. Consequently the
government took steps to
move people back to the coun
tryside where they could grow
food. But given the necessarily
harsh conditions, made even
worse by severe floods, those
who could afford it fled, many
to become helpless "boat
people."
The wholesale killing that
has taken place in Cambodia
was not carried out by the Viet
namese but by the Pol Pot
government, which took over
after Cambodia's collapse in
1975.
Asian scholars who pro
tested the American invasion
of Cambodia in 1970 virtually
predicted such a tragedy when
they maintained that the over
throw of Prince Sihanouk and
the subsequent war in Cam
bodia would destroy the deli
cate balance of social and polit
ic al forces that had enabled

Sihanouk to hold the country
together. Their protests and
warning were ignored.
Kosaaen faults the United
States lor having a "foreign
policy of retreat," caused by
the "sapping of our national
will." As evidence he points to
our refusal to intervene more
actively against the Soviets in
Angola.
But the United States had in
tervened in Angola long before
the Russians, tirst by supply
ing aid to the Portuguese colo
nial regime and, when that dis
integrated, by giving military
support to the least popular of
three competing factions.
The Angolans asked tor
Cuban troops only after South
Africa, apparently with tacit
U.S. approval, launched an in
vasion and was advancing on
the capital city of Luanda.
Cubans remain in Angola,
and in Ethiopia, at the request
of those countries' govern
ments, just as U.S. forces are
stationed in Korea, the Philip
pines, and West Germany and
as French troops remain in at
least five African countries.
The Angolans still fear inva
sion and, indeed, reported to
the United Nations last week
that South African airborne
troops had raided and oc
cupied areas on Angola's west
coast. Despite the presence of
Cuban troops, Angola has per
sistently dec lared its eagerness
to resume normal* relations
with the United States.
In an important omission,
Kosaaen failed to point out that
the Soviets have been asked to
leave a number of countries,
including Somalia, Egypt, Su
dan, Ghana and Guinea.
In each case the government
came to resent their presence
and found that there was more
to be gained by cooperation
with the West.
Elsewhere, Soviet aid has
been welcomed only after
pleas for help from the United

States have been turned down.
(Even Ho Chi Minh wrote ur
gently to President Truman in
1945 asking for help in getting
rid of French colonial rule in
Vietnam. His letters were
never answered.)
A closer look at the turbulent
events in Asia, Africa and Latin
America since World War II
shows that the people of those
areas have been struggling
with varying success to over
turn systems that have
exploited them.
U.S. policy has too often
viewed these efforts as threats
to American interests, and the
resulting interventions have
led to increased bloodshed â€”
in Indochina, Cuba,
Guatemala, the Dominican
Republic, Angola and Chile.
There are, as Rosaaen points
out, lessons to be learned from
Vietnam. One of them is that in
the long run there are limits to
what military force can achieve
against a popular movement
tor independence or social jus
tice. Another is that only
tragedy can result when such

movements are turned into
skirmishes of the Cold War.
