## Dylan's found true meaning 
### 
I was surprised to read in the Daily (Nov. 1)
that Tom Casciato has decided to conclude his
days of listening to Bob Dylan right when I have
begun to take up the habit.
In a generous and self-effacing tone, Casciato
struggles to admit that he now finds the singer
he once placed so much faith in "boring."
He says that Dylan bores him partly because
he has commercialized his music, making it ac
cessible to any old fan through concerts and
television, and partly because his latest lyrics are
no longer difficult and artistic, but "one
dimensional" with their Christian message.
I don't know enough about Dylan s history to
argue the first point about the increased acces
sibility of his music, but the second point, about
the decreased ambiguiiy of his lyrics which
leads to boredom, is something I would like to
debate.
Casciato believes that "the irony, anger and
intentional ambiguity" that Dylan once wove
into his songs is now gone.
"There is nothing rich about the language he
uses or the images he attempts to create, and for
the first time we know exactly what he means.
For the first time, Bob Dylan is boring."
No less a personage than the editor of Rolling
Stone magazine, |ann Wenner, disagrees with
Casciato in his review of Dylan's latest release,
"Slow Train Coming" (Sept. 20.)
"Dylan's new songs are statements of
strength and simplicity, and the lyrics again
equal his early classics. The words are rich with
the ambiguity of great art . . . "Slow Train Com
ing" 's lyrics are timeless, simple, yet rich in
potential levels of meaning."
Wenner's opinion is certainly true for several
songs on the album. But I agree with Casciato
that the lyrics he referred to in his article do not
seem to hold much ambiguity and thus they
might tend, for the aesthetically conscious, to
be boring.
They seem awfully religious, awfully Biblical:
"Of every earthly plan that be known to man, he
is
unconcerned
He has plans of his own to set up his throne

when he returns."
If Dylan has not in this instance put literary
irony into the language of the song, he nonethe
less may be singing about an irony in real
life. Perhaps it is the Great Irony of Humaii
Existence: God revealing himself in Jesus Christ
while people throughout history do not bother
to pay attention to Him, let alone to worship
Him.
Talk about ironies, the Bible is full of them,
such as the one in John 1: "He was in the world,
and the world was made through him, yet the
world knew him not." That to me is an irony,
that things are not as they seem in this world;
Now I am no psychologist, but in my life I have
seen boredom come from my inability to relate
to other persons on a level that they consider
important, the level where their meaning in life
may lie. When we disagree about what is ulti
mately real, we have trouble not boring each
other.
I wonder if this is Casciato's frustration with
Dylan. The aesthetic "high" of listening to Dy
lan's lyrics may not be so great when those
words point to his experience beyond aesthe
tics, to religious experience, which to many
people is unbelievable.
The particular kind of religious experience
that Dylan sings about is not a sense of feeling at
one with the cosmos and overcoming the law of
identity, but is an acquaintance with the God of
the Bible, who is far beyond him, but not far
away, and to whom personal pronouns are fully
applicable.
The promisethat Jesus Christ will set up his
throne when he returns and the knowledge that
he is watching us and waiting for the most op
portune time to come is not to me a purely
intellectual concept, nor a fairy tale, nor a Freu
dian illusion to overcome when I mature, but my
source of meaning and comfort in the present,
and an undeniable hope for the future.
That is why I can relate to Dylan's feelings, and
why the spinning grooves of my album are
quickly wearing out.
