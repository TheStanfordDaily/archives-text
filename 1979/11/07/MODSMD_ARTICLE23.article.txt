## Cuban revolution viewed realistically 
### 
In her article (Daily, Oct. 30),
Linda Crouse presented a pic
ture of Cuba which should
make us abandon our posses
sions and head for that democ
ratic paradise 90 miles south of
Key West.
Unfortunately, I feel her arti
cle detracts from the serious
ness ot the Cuban revolution,
does not ac knowledge many of
the tragic failures ol the Castro
regime, and unjustly roman
ticizes the island into the
bourgeois radical's living
example of freedom, liberty
and equality in a socialist
world.
Certainly the Cuban revolu
tion has brought about change
and reform — so much so that

Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen has labelled the revolu
tion "the most radical in the
history of the Americas" — but
the changes have not always
resulted in the glorious trans
formations originally hoped
for.
Crouse writes about Cuba as
an educated, progressive and
egalitarian Utopia. Her glorifi
cations must be tempered with
reality.
The Dark Side of Cuba
Any evaluation of the Cuban
revolution must consider the
following:
1) Thougn Cuba is no longer
dependent on the United
States, its economic ties to the
Soviet Union have grown prog

ressively stronger, amounting
today to a precious lite-line of
several million dollars a day.
2) Land seized from U.S.
corporations and plantation
owners has not been freely dis
tributed to the landless poor,
but has been placed under
"collective'' or state owner
ship. Although many Cubans
have been provided small plots
of land, there is no doubt that a
"rural proletariat"continues to
exist.
3) Though the Castro regime
has cut illiteracy to three per
cent across the island, quality
education has suffered propor
tionally. Today's teachers are
teenage graduates of grammar
schools given crash courses in
education.
Though Cuba has effectively
incorporated women into
mainstream economic produ
cation, the reasons are as much
pragmatic as ideological.
Continuing discrimination
against homosexuals persua
sively suggests that
"machismo" still exists, and
that integrating women into
the labor force is just as much
an economic consideration as
a desire for "equal pay for
equal work."
5) Houses taken from weal
thy refugees and given to the
poor are now decrepit and
sometimes beyond repair.
Kent continues at a low per
centage of total earnings be
cause the average Cuban's in
come (which is paid by the
state) remains so low that the
state can justifiably retract only
a small amount.
6) Medical care is now free
and infant mortality has been
dramatically reduced, but the
quality ot medical care has suf
fered from lack of accessibility
to essential drugs and equip

ment.
7) Though most Cuban
women can now safely jog
through the streets of Havana,
most hardly care to, and all
have to bear the price of a heav
ily policed state.
Countryside
Fagen writes that "to under
stand what is happening in
Cuba today, it is necessary to
get out of Havana and into the
countryside."
Long lines, shortages and ra
tioning all characterize Cuba's
once glamorous capital, yet in
the country a true socio
cultural transformation is tak
ing place.
Castro has introduced all
Cubans to agriculture, and in
forcing everyone to share the
same fate he has bred a new
camaraderie which before was
obscured by class differences
and occupational prejudice.
This is the wonder of the
Cuban revolution, not the
country's tremendous eco
nomic progress, for in
economic terms Cuba is only
beginning to reach the produc
tive levels today which it at
tained twenty years ago.
Need for Moderation
Crouse is free to develop her
own opinions of bourgeois
democracy in the United
States. She has obviously lived
here. But her visions of Cuba
are much too lofty and idealis
tic to believe.
Let us grant Cuba the recog
nition it deserves for a massive
revolution which transformed
the island's political culture.
Let us not glorify it as a true
economic democracy.
The revolution has already
been tainted with excessive
rhetoric from both extremes.
