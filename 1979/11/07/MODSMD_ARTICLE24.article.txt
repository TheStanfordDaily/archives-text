Is there equity?
Referring to Assemblyman
Maxine Waters' (D-South
Central Los Angeles) recent
speech at Stanford, I don't
know how opposition to abor
tion funding makes one a ra
cist, but I see Waters' point in
objecting to pro-lifers' opposi
tion to welfare.
The economic concerns
which prompt abortion will not
disappear by carrying a baby to
term.
Pro-lifers face a choice: pro
vide the welfare that enables
mothers to care for their chil
dren or require fathers to fulfill
their responsibilities.
A major factor contributing

to abortion is the public policy
downgrading the role of the
mother in the home. This is re
flected in divorce law which
permits a man, without just
cause, to leave his wife — who
had taken on his equal share,
,as well as her own, of their
jointly and equally incurred
domestic responsibilities —
and then, altera brief period of
alimony for her "rehabilita
tion," permits him to keep en
tirely for himself the equity in
his earning-capacity increase
achieved through their joint ef
forts and sacrifices — while she
must now begin on the job
ladder at a level where he was
years previously.
Women are becoming in
creasingly aware that they
place their economic future in
serious jeopardy by having
children, so they demand
abortion. (Moral considera
tions aside, unless one wished
to be a broodmare for the state

there is little point in having
children the bulk of whose up
bringing is to be turned over to
a child-care center so that
Mother may continue in her
career.)
The hypocrisyand insensitiv
ity of legislators who oppose
abortion whtle either opposing
welfare for mothers or failing
to take decisive action to re
quire fathers to fulfill their re
sponsibilities, hardly puts
them in a better moral position
than that of the abortionists.
A root cause of the whoie
mess is the misuse of sexuality
— a moral problem which can
not be legislated away. But
what can be legislated away is
the economic inequity con
tributing to the choice for
abortion — a choice com
pounding the immorality al
ready rampant.
