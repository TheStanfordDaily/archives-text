# Defending NCAA champs edge tough Stanford
## USF dons conference leader's cap, 4-3 
### Dean Eyre 
San Francisco — In a race for
regional playoff consideration
when every win counts, vic
tories tend to look alike on
paper. In context, however,
they are not all alike and the
same goes for losses, as Stan
ford realized in yesterday's 4-3
defeat at the hands, uh, feet of
defending national champion
USF.
In black and white, the loss
allows USF to replace the Car
dinals in the Pacific Soccer
Conference lead. Stanford's
league mark of 5-2 ends a week
at the top, while the Dons tie
Santa Clara for first place with a
5-1 record and only a match
with UC-Berkeley on Sunday
remaining.
Even though the official re
sults lower Stanford's record to
14-4-2, facing the 20-2-1 Dons
was more than a confrontation
ot statistics. Just as many of
those following the 21-21 tie

with USC in tootball credited
Stantord with a "victory,"
there were spectators at Ulrich
Field who wanted to qualify the
Cardinals' performance.
Spectators present in the
almost-steady rain watched a
game considered by some of
the Dons' camp to be one of
the best matchups for USF this
season. They know the story
that statistics alone don't tell:
Stantord stayed right with the
country's leading offensive col
lege power throughout the
contest.
In tact, Stanford went ahead
twice, at 2-1 and 3-2 before sur
rendering the lead with 29 mi
nutes remaining. Other than
two ties in 1974 and 1976, the
one-goal loss represents the
best Cardinal showing against
the soccer powerhouse in 13
years. The margin also indi
cates significant improvement
over last year's 3-0 regular sea
son loss and 6-i defeat in the

NCAA Western regional
playoffs.
Unlike that playoff match in
which Stanford jumped ahead
2-0 in a matter of minutes, it
was USF that took the early
lead on a goal by Luis
Magalhaes, assisted by Bjorn
Tronstad. The Cards tied it up
about 11 minutes in with a
score by Willie Giucci, assisted
by Greg Delgado.
Stanford surged ahead about
four minutes later when Dan
McNevin's throw-in .set up a
goal for Peter Phillips. The
Cards could not enjoy a
halftime lead though, for the
Dons tallied four minutes be
fore the first period ended
when Magalhaes made an un
assisted goal.
Stanford had its last fling in
the driver's seat as McNevin
punched a penalty kick past
Don goalkeeper Andy Fry after
an hour of play. USF came right
back to even the score at 3-3 on

the strength of Tronstad's
shooting skills. A minute after
the last Stanford score, Dag
Olavsen fed a pass to Tronstad
for the tying point. Tronstad
put the Dons ahead for the
second and last time, this time
with an assist by Roger Al
phonse 15 minutes before the
final gun.
The key element distinguish
ing the performances of the
two teams was the ability to
capitalize on opportunities.
"This was the first year that
we've actually played soccer
with them," said senior Greg
Delgado. "We had just as many
good scoring chances as they
did . . . but their players are
very experienced."
"I think we had a chance at
putting the game away," said
head coach Nelson Lodge.
"You got to feel good about a
few things even though it was a
loss, especially being able to
score against USF."

Lodge pointed out that Stan
ford had at least two strong
scoring opportunities, includ
ing one seconds before the
final gun.
"What separates an out
standing team from a mediocre
one is the ability to capitalize,"
Lodge continued. While the
Cards are well above
"mediocre," they lacked the
maturity of the Dons in turning
potential into points.
Maturity does not come
overnight, but by knocking
heads with USF and other
high-caliber competition,
Stanford has added poise since
last season.
"Our attitude going into last
year's (USF) games was we
didn't deserve to step on the
field (with a national champ
ion)," said sophomore Ted
Rafalovich. "This time, we re
spected them as a good team,
but didn't consider them in
vincible."

they are not all alike and the
same goes for losses, as Stan
ford realized in yesterday's 4-3
defeat at the hands, uh, feet of
defending national champion
USF.
In black and white, the loss
allows USF to replace the Car
dinals in the Pacific Soccer
Conference lead. Stanford's
league mark of 5-2 ends a week
at the top, while the Dons tie
Santa Clara for first place with a
5-1 record and only a match
with UC-Berkeley on Sunday
remaining.
Even though the official re
sults lower Stanford's record to
14-4-2, facing the 20-2-1 Dons
was more than a confrontation
ot statistics. Just as many of
those following the 21-21 tie

with USC in tootball credited
Stantord with a "victory,"
there were spectators at Ulrich
Field who wanted to qualify the
Cardinals' performance.
Spectators present in the
almost-steady rain watched a
game considered by some of
the Dons' camp to be one of
the best matchups for USF this
season. They know the story
that statistics alone don't tell:
Stantord stayed right with the
country's leading offensive col
lege power throughout the
contest.
In tact, Stanford went ahead
twice, at 2-1 and 3-2 before sur
rendering the lead with 29 mi
nutes remaining. Other than
two ties in 1974 and 1976, the
one-goal loss represents the
best Cardinal showing against
the soccer powerhouse in 13
years. The margin also indi
cates significant improvement
over last year's 3-0 regular sea
son loss and 6-i defeat in the

NCAA Western regional
playoffs.
Unlike that playoff match in
which Stanford jumped ahead
2-0 in a matter of minutes, it
was USF that took the early
lead on a goal by Luis
Magalhaes, assisted by Bjorn
Tronstad. The Cards tied it up
about 11 minutes in with a
score by Willie Giucci, assisted
by Greg Delgado.
Stanford surged ahead about
four minutes later when Dan
McNevin's throw-in .set up a
goal for Peter Phillips. The
Cards could not enjoy a
halftime lead though, for the
Dons tallied four minutes be
fore the first period ended
when Magalhaes made an un
assisted goal.
Stanford had its last fling in
the driver's seat as McNevin
punched a penalty kick past
Don goalkeeper Andy Fry after
an hour of play. USF came right
back to even the score at 3-3 on

the strength of Tronstad's
shooting skills. A minute after
the last Stanford score, Dag
Olavsen fed a pass to Tronstad
for the tying point. Tronstad
put the Dons ahead for the
second and last time, this time
with an assist by Roger Al
phonse 15 minutes before the
final gun.
The key element distinguish
ing the performances of the
two teams was the ability to
capitalize on opportunities.
"This was the first year that
we've actually played soccer
with them," said senior Greg
Delgado. "We had just as many
good scoring chances as they
did . . . but their players are
very experienced."
"I think we had a chance at
putting the game away," said
head coach Nelson Lodge.
"You got to feel good about a
few things even though it was a
loss, especially being able to
score against USF."

Lodge pointed out that Stan
ford had at least two strong
scoring opportunities, includ
ing one seconds before the
final gun.
"What separates an out
standing team from a mediocre
one is the ability to capitalize,"
Lodge continued. While the
Cards are well above
"mediocre," they lacked the
maturity of the Dons in turning
potential into points.
Maturity does not come
overnight, but by knocking
heads with USF and other
high-caliber competition,
Stanford has added poise since
last season.
"Our attitude going into last
year's (USF) games was we
didn't deserve to step on the
field (with a national champ
ion)," said sophomore Ted
Rafalovich. "This time, we re
spected them as a good team,
but didn't consider them in
vincible."
