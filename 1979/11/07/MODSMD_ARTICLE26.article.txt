# Rain uses good game plan to upset fans
## 
### Grant Finlayson 
While Stanford fought the
Sun Devils on the field last
Saturday, an equally intense
battle raged in the stands
between the Stanford fans
and the rain.
112 inding the standard red
sweatshirt pitifully in
adequate, the tans tried a
variety of supplements to
their detenses.
Among the better
prepared fans, brightly
colored umbrellas sprouted

like mushrooms photo
graphed in time-lapse. Gar
bage bags were pulled over
the limbs of slightly less
prepared fans.
The least prepared were
simply drenched. One girl
with no coat was seen cran
ing her neck to get her head
under her neighbor's um
brella — oblivious to the
steady stream of water flow
ing down one of its spokes
and being rapidly absorbed
by her sweatshirt.

Another umbrella-less fan
tried to shield himself with
carefully arranged Dailys —
only to have the rain plaster
them to his drenched body.
Had ABC turned its
cameras on the battle raged
in the stands, the commen
tary might have been:
"After a three-week rest,
the Cardinal fans return to
Stanford Stadium today to
wrap up their season with
three Saturdays of hard
rooting. What do you have
to say about their oppo
nents today, Keith?"
"Well, Rain has been a
hard-luck team this year,
Ara. They've been shut out
in each of their first four
games here so far this year,
but you have to expect them
to get tougher and tougher
as the season progresses.
I'd have to say that we can
expect a strong offensive
showing by the Rain out
there today."
"Yes, a lot of teams seem
to tighten up as the weather
gets colder, but Rain seems
to just pour it on more and
more the closer we get to
winter. Let's review some of
the key plays we should see
Rain use out there this af
ternoon."
"Okay, Ara. Rain has bas
ically used the same offense
all year, but up to now all

their planning just hasn't
amounted to much.''
lust 'gone down the
drain,' so to speak, huh
Keith?"
"Right. The Rain's most
effective plays, though,
have worked tor them year
after year. In fact, the Rain
has had one of the most
consistent philosophies of
any team in the country:
'Three yards and a cloud.' "
"Is that where Ohio State
got their perennial game
plan, Keith? 'Three yards
and a cloud of dust?' "
"Right — just a variation.
We should see some good
offensive action out there
today, though, Ara. Let's go
over two of their favorite
plays. One of their plays has
been compared to USC's
'Student Body Sweep', in
which they send all their
force right at you to try to
overpower you."
"What does the Rain call
that play, Keith?"
"Cats and Dogs. These
teams sure use off-the-wall
codes for their plays, don't
they, Ara?"
"Must be for secrecy."
"Anyway, their other
favorite play is a trick play
they use in desperate situa
tions. First they allow a
crack to open up in their of
fensive line to let the sun

shine through for a mo
ment. This gets their oppo
nents to let down their
guard — you know, put
away their umbrellas or
even take their coats off.
Then all of a sudden they
really open up and pour it
on you."
"That sounds like an ef
fective play. I bet it really
baffles their opponents."
"It sure does. You should
hear the contusion in the
stands. Pandemonium
reigns', as they say."
"Pandemonium rains?
That's pretty good, Keith."
"Thanks, Ara."
"The Rain has been
known to use a number of
other tactics to get their op
ponents off guard, haven't
they, Keith.
"Yes sir, Ara. To lure their
opponents into a false sense
of security, they use what is
known as "The Weather
man." He spreads false
rumors about the Rain's
game plan, thus giving the
team the invaluable advan
tage of surprise."
It's hard to say who won
the game last Saturday bet
ween the Rain and the fans
— but it is probably safe to
guess that there will be a
rematch.
And the best game plan is
clearly towield an umbrella.
