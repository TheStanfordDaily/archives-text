## Crew opens year at Oakland race 
### Gray Maxwell 
The first annual Head of the
Estuary was held this past Sun
day under cloudy skies at the
Port of Oakland. Sponsored in
part by the Oakland Tribune,
Kaiser Aluminum, the Berkeley
Yacht Club, and UC-Berkeley,
it attracted boats from 22 diffe
rent clubs.
Stanford was represented by
a men's lightweight eight and
open eight, and two open
fours, and a women's open
eight and four. In addition, two
Stanford alumni, Dick Lyon
and Andy Kerr, competed in
the Master's Single event.
In Head regattas, despite
what the name implies, boats
do not race head to head, but
start one after the other at
(supposedly) 15-second inter
vals. As a result, there is little
sense of "competition"
oarsmen generally have only a
dim sense of where their com
petitors are and are primarily
racing a clock.
The men's lightweight eight
started lirst in the Lightweight
event and maintained a lead
1000 meters into the three-mile
race.
The young, smallish boat
had trouble with the debris
strewn water, though, and
finished fifth behind Cal
Maritime (which posted a win

ning time of 17:47), Santa Cla
ra's "A," St. Mary's, and Santa
Clara's "B."
The men entered two boats
in the Open lour event and
took second and third, finish
ing behind perennial power
Cal The second-place boat,
led by Captain Carl Taussig,
was only 22 seconds off Cal's
pace.
The men's open eight, con
taining two novice oarsmen,
held off two "power ten's" by a
Cal alumni eight that was the
best in the West last year be
fore yielding a length to the
Bears. They stayed close to the
Bears tor the length of the
course and put in a surprising
third-place finish (Lake Merritt
Rowing Club finished second)
in a field of 12.
The women's open four put
in a strong showing, finishing
third in a field of six. The wo
men's time of 22:59 was only
seven seconds behind Cal.
I MRC won the event.
The women's open eight
also put in an excellent effort,
finishing fourth in a field of
eight. I MRC again won, fol
lowed by Cal, Santa Clara, and
Stanford.
Lyon, an Olympic gold
medalist, took lirst in the Mas
ter's Single event.
