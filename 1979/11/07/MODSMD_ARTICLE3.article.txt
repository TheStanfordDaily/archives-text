# Prime Minister Bazargan, Cabinet resign
## No steps to free American hostages seen 
### Associated Press 
Washington officials said yesterday
that the United States will not use
force to free about 60 American hos
tages threatened with death by de
monstrators occupying the American
Embassy in Tehran and It expects Ira
nian authorities to protect them.
U.S. oil company executives in
Washington reported an interrup
tion in Iran's oil shipments to Ameri
ca and said it appeared a threatened
oil boycott ot the United States had
begun.
A U.S. official said the shutdown
may have stemmed from a strike by
port workers. Initial reports came to
administration and congressional
sources from the CIA.
Protection of the embassy cap
tives is now the responsibility of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Re
volutionary Council which the religi
ous leader ordered to run the coun
try after Prime Minister Mehdi Bazar

gan and his Cabinet resigned yester
day.
Bazargan, whose earlier offers to
resign were rejected by Khomeini,
left office because of Khomeini's es
calating anti-American campaign, an
official of the premier's office said in
a telephone interview with The As
sociated Press's bureau in Nicosia,
Cyprus.
Both Khomeini and his council
have been issuing statements back
ing the embassy invaders' demand
that ousteil Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi be returned for trial.
The shah is in a New York hospital
undergoing treatment for cancer and
the United States has said it will not
send him to Iran.
President jimmy Carter convened
an unscheduled meeting of the Na
tional Security Council to discuss the
crisis that flared with Sunday's em
bassy takeover. He called the meet
ing after conferring with his top

foreign policy advisers. No details
were given.
"The U.S. has been given assur
ances by the authorities in Iran that
the safety and well-being of Ameri
cans will be protected," said a state
ment issued by the White House.
"The U.S. expects that these assur
ances will be honored.
Reporters also were advised the
administration had tried to express
its concern directly to Iranian offi
cials now in positions of influence
and that it would be a mistake to as
sume that these officials have been
totally uncooperative.
White House press secretary )ody
Powell announced the administra
tion did not intend to use force to
free the hostages, an operation
which he said would be difficult to
mount in any case.
One U.S. oil company officer in
Washington, who asked not to be
identified, quoted "usually reliable
sources" as saying Iran has begun a
boycott of oil shipments to the Un
ited States, which receives as much
as 5 percent of its total oil imports
from Iran.
A State Department official said in
itial reports indicated that the sus
pension barred all tankers from load
ing, not only those of the United
States. The official, who declined to
be identified, said initial fragmentary
reports suggested that the shutdown
involved a strike.
But U.S. officials feel such an em
bargo might be less effective than the
cutoff last winter.
Khomeini ordered his council to

run the government after accepting
the resignation of Bazargan earlier
yesterday. Later, the council asked
the ministers to continue their duties
tor the time being, Tehran radio re
ported in a broadcast monitored in
London.
The Islamic Revolutionary Coun
cil, which reportedly took over
Bazargan's powers, is a secret body
close to Khomeini, believed to
number about 15 persons.
The elimination of the government
from the Iranian power structure
would leave the Revolutionary
Council, autonomy-minded ethnic
minorities, liberal intellectuals and
leftist groups as the main com
petitors for a say in how Iran is run.
Addressing the hostage issue,
Khomeini, speaking from the holy
city of Qom in a radio broadcast re
ported by the Soviet news agency
Tass, said:
"Some people are now pressing
that students should leave that em
bassy. But we cannot sit idlehanded
when the United States is weaving
conspiracies against us.
"We demand that the United
States should extradite the criminal
shah to us, and the British govern
ment should extradite criminal
Bakhtiar," a reference to Shapour
Bakhtiar, prime minister under the
fallen government of the shah.
The Palestinian Liberation Organi
zation, which has good relations with
Iran's Islamic regime, said it would
send a delegation to Tehran to save
the hostages' lives.
