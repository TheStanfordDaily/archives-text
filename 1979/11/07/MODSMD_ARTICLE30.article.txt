# Freshman heads to top of cross country class
## Stanford's style suits striding Schnurpfeil 
### Will johnson 
When treshman cross coun
try runner Kim Schnurpfeil de
livers each foot to the ground
during a race, she does it with
the authority and conviction of
a karate expert throwing a
chop. Hercoach, Laurel Treon,
calls it a "powerful" and "de
liberate" running style.
Already this style has pro
duced success for Schnurpfeil.
She qualified tor the AIAW Na
tionals by finishing 11th in a
field of 72 in Saturday's Region
Fight Championships.
Schnurpfeil's stride — high
spring, powerful knee thrust,
solid toot placement'— has al
ready pushed her to the
number one position on the
Stanford women's cross coun
try team. Schnurpfeil's stride is
also a pretty clear indicator of
her personality.
"I'm very goal oriented
whatever I go out to dn, I do it.
I'm very strict with myself.
When coaches tell me some
thing I listen to them,"
Schnurpfeil said.
Schnurpfeil accomplished a
major goal last year: she was
Northern California cross
country champion as a senior
at San Mateo High. She also ran
a very respectable 5:05 mile as
a junior at S&n Mateo.
But Schnurpfeil's high

school days are far behind
now, not so much in time but
because of what she's learned
since coming to Stanford.
Schnurpteil has had to adjust
to very different training con
cepts. In high school boys
were her only competition in
practice, and practice was
grueling. Sometimes the road
runs covered more than 15
miles a day.
Stanford's training
philosophy features a
minimum of long-distance
running and lots of short dis
tance repetitions and sprint
drills. The Stanford format
consists of alternating days of
hard and easy workouts. A
psychological difference in
Stanford's approach to dis
tance running is that if an
athlete wants to modify a
workout, the coaches will
allow it.
Stantord's approach has
changed Schnurpfeil's attitude
about training.
"I'm teeling so strong," she
said. "I used to dread work
outs. I'm nervous, but hardly
to the extent I used to be — it's
more positive now."
Training at Stanford has also
made Schnurpfeil more aware
of her own body mechanics
and personal nutrition re
quirements. She started learn

ing these things at the Olympic
Training Center in Squaw Val
ley, where she spent 10 days in
August.
Since then she has read a lot
more about nutrition. "I'm a
little more sane about my
body. I monitor my body
now," Schnurpfeil said.
In four months Schnurpfeil
has shed 20 pounds. At 5-foot
5, she believes her current 105
pounds is the best weight for
running.
Schnurpfeil's diet includes a
minimum of meat, salt, and
sugar, with an emphasis on
fruits and vegetables. "I feel
more efficient," she said about
her new training habits.
Schnurpfeil's new regimen
has meant some sacrifices.
One of them is gourmet din
ners, heavy on the sauces. She
used to prepare complete din
ners for her family, and now
she misses them.
Another sacrifice has been
her social life. "I have my go
als. I have to cut people off a
lot," said Schnurpfeil. "My
only problem at Stanford is
reali/inghowanti-social I am."
Schnurpfeil hasn't even had
time to keep up with her cello
playing, which she has been
doing for nine years.
When she talks about the
fancy dinners she used to pre

pare for her family, the em
phasis is on the sharing and the
closeness rather than the eat
ing. "We always try to have
dinner together; we try to take
time for each other," said
Schnurpfeil.
Staying close hasn't been
easy in Schnurpfeil's busy fam
ily. Her father is a high school
basketball, football and tennis
coach. Her 11-year-old sister, is
a gymnast ranked second in
her age group in Northern
California. Her 13-year-old
brother, plays soccer and ten
nis.
Schnurpteil has found
another kind of family at Stan
ford, one composed of her
coaches and teammates. This
has enabled her to thrive. For
example, Schnurpteil de
scribed Treon as a "real lis
tener," a leader who devotes a
great deal of personal attention
to each athlete and to team
morale in general.
"Each athlete is an individual
and needs to be approached
differently. The biggest coach
ing challenge is to indi
vidualize," said Treon.
Treon is very pleased with
the way Schnurpfeil has re
sponded to her approach to
coaching. "Kim is very willing
to trust the guidance she re

ceives, as long as it's (nought
out," said Treon.
Very different from Treon,
according to Schnurpteil, is
Brooks lohnson, Stanford's
new track coach.
"Brooks is always pushing.
He talks to me after my races,"
Schnurpteil said. "He says 'you
can do better,' always. He
makes me think about my per
formance."
Important to Schnurpteil,
along with coaches who com
plement each other, are her
teammates, most notably
senior Ail-American Ann
Thrupp and junior Ann
Wotherspoon, a junior college
state champion.
For Schnurpteil they serve as
older sisters, with special qual
ities she can strive for.
Wotherspoon has exceptional
speed; Thrupp has long dis
tance endurance — the kind
that has Schnurpteil dragging
after their 10 to 12-mile runs on
Sundays.
Schnurpteil has already ac
complished some of the goals
she started with this season.
She's competitive with Stan
ford's top runners, both male
and female.
"I didn't expect to be first at
Stanford," Schnurpteil said. I
didn't expect to be doing this
well."

Freshman Kim Schnurpfeil, who qualified for Nov. 17's AIAW cross
country nationals, displays her powerful stride in recent action.
When treshman cross coun
try runner Kim Schnurpfeil de
livers each foot to the ground
during a race, she does it with
the authority and conviction of
a karate expert throwing a
chop. Hercoach, Laurel Treon,
calls it a "powerful" and "de
liberate" running style.
Already this style has pro
duced success for Schnurpfeil.
She qualified tor the AIAW Na
tionals by finishing 11th in a
field of 72 in Saturday's Region
Fight Championships.
Schnurpfeil's stride — high
spring, powerful knee thrust,
solid toot placement'— has al
ready pushed her to the
number one position on the
Stanford women's cross coun
try team. Schnurpfeil's stride is
also a pretty clear indicator of
her personality.
"I'm very goal oriented
whatever I go out to dn, I do it.
I'm very strict with myself.
When coaches tell me some
thing I listen to them,"
Schnurpfeil said.
Schnurpfeil accomplished a
major goal last year: she was
Northern California cross
country champion as a senior
at San Mateo High. She also ran
a very respectable 5:05 mile as
a junior at S&n Mateo.
But Schnurpfeil's high

school days are far behind
now, not so much in time but
because of what she's learned
since coming to Stanford.
Schnurpteil has had to adjust
to very different training con
cepts. In high school boys
were her only competition in
practice, and practice was
grueling. Sometimes the road
runs covered more than 15
miles a day.
Stanford's training
philosophy features a
minimum of long-distance
running and lots of short dis
tance repetitions and sprint
drills. The Stanford format
consists of alternating days of
hard and easy workouts. A
psychological difference in
Stanford's approach to dis
tance running is that if an
athlete wants to modify a
workout, the coaches will
allow it.
Stantord's approach has
changed Schnurpfeil's attitude
about training.
"I'm teeling so strong," she
said. "I used to dread work
outs. I'm nervous, but hardly
to the extent I used to be — it's
more positive now."
Training at Stanford has also
made Schnurpfeil more aware
of her own body mechanics
and personal nutrition re
quirements. She started learn

ing these things at the Olympic
Training Center in Squaw Val
ley, where she spent 10 days in
August.
Since then she has read a lot
more about nutrition. "I'm a
little more sane about my
body. I monitor my body
now," Schnurpfeil said.
In four months Schnurpfeil
has shed 20 pounds. At 5-foot
5, she believes her current 105
pounds is the best weight for
running.
Schnurpfeil's diet includes a
minimum of meat, salt, and
sugar, with an emphasis on
fruits and vegetables. "I feel
more efficient," she said about
her new training habits.
Schnurpfeil's new regimen
has meant some sacrifices.
One of them is gourmet din
ners, heavy on the sauces. She
used to prepare complete din
ners for her family, and now
she misses them.
Another sacrifice has been
her social life. "I have my go
als. I have to cut people off a
lot," said Schnurpfeil. "My
only problem at Stanford is
reali/inghowanti-social I am."
Schnurpfeil hasn't even had
time to keep up with her cello
playing, which she has been
doing for nine years.
When she talks about the
fancy dinners she used to pre

pare for her family, the em
phasis is on the sharing and the
closeness rather than the eat
ing. "We always try to have
dinner together; we try to take
time for each other," said
Schnurpfeil.
Staying close hasn't been
easy in Schnurpfeil's busy fam
ily. Her father is a high school
basketball, football and tennis
coach. Her 11-year-old sister, is
a gymnast ranked second in
her age group in Northern
California. Her 13-year-old
brother, plays soccer and ten
nis.
Schnurpteil has found
another kind of family at Stan
ford, one composed of her
coaches and teammates. This
has enabled her to thrive. For
example, Schnurpteil de
scribed Treon as a "real lis
tener," a leader who devotes a
great deal of personal attention
to each athlete and to team
morale in general.
"Each athlete is an individual
and needs to be approached
differently. The biggest coach
ing challenge is to indi
vidualize," said Treon.
Treon is very pleased with
the way Schnurpfeil has re
sponded to her approach to
coaching. "Kim is very willing
to trust the guidance she re

ceives, as long as it's (nought
out," said Treon.
Very different from Treon,
according to Schnurpteil, is
Brooks lohnson, Stanford's
new track coach.
"Brooks is always pushing.
He talks to me after my races,"
Schnurpteil said. "He says 'you
can do better,' always. He
makes me think about my per
formance."
Important to Schnurpteil,
along with coaches who com
plement each other, are her
teammates, most notably
senior Ail-American Ann
Thrupp and junior Ann
Wotherspoon, a junior college
