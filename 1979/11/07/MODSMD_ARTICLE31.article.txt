# AL to discuss sale of A's
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The
American League is
scheduled to meet today in
Kansas City, Mo., to discuss
the sale of the Oakland A's
to oil mogul Marvin Davis of
Denver, but Al President
Lee MacPhail warns not to
expect any immediate ac
tion on the matter.
"It could he weeks, it
could be months or nothing
may happen," MacPhail
said Tuesday. "Nothing is
going to happen at this
meeting. We are |ust going
to update the clubs on what
the situation is at this time."
At present, the A's have
eight years remaining on
their lease at the Oakland
Coliseum and that hurdle
would have to be resolved
before the club could be
moved.
Charles O. Finley, the A's

owner, admitted that "the
club is for sale" and that he
"talked with Marvin Davis
and his representative some
time ago. The entire situa
tion depends on the possi
bility ol working out some
thing with the Coliseum."
Davis, meanwhile, told
the Denver Post, "Rumors
are rampant. There's no
thing I can say."
The Associated Press
learned Monday that the
sale was in the works — a
deal that would bring major
league baseball to Denver.
"We've been working at
this tor three years," Mac-
Phail said. "So I can't tell
you it is going to tall in place
at this time. We are having a
player relations meeting,
and because all of our
people will be together, we
decided to review the Oak

land situation."
"There are two big pieces
that have to come together.
One of them is Charlie Fin
ley. The other is the Oak
land Coliseum Board. We
do not have an agreement
with the Coliseum Board."
This is the second time
Finley is attempting to sell
the struggling franchise to
Davis. He first tried last
year, but several obstacles
blocked the deal.
Reportedly, those obsta
cles have been eased and
the sale virtually is certain to
be completed this time.
Al Rosen, former presi
dent of the New York Yan
kees, and Cedric Tallis,
former general manager ot
the Yankees, would be
come involved in operation
ot the Denver franchise, the
AP has learned.
