KKK denied marching permit
Fresno — A permit to let the Ku klux Klan
march here Sunday was denied yesterdav by
Police Chief Gerald Hansen in the wake of last
weekend's deaths of five people at a North
Carolina anti-Klan rally.
Hansen based the denial on a municipal
code sec tion allowing him to refuse permits if
"a parade or march is reasonably likely to in
jure persons or property or create a distur
bance in the c ity."
Officers had learned of "threats against the
kKK's marc hers and intentions to confront
them wherevey they appear," Hansen said.
Officers had found that some people op
posed to letting the Klan marc h "already had
obtained weapons and plan to be there," he
said.
Fhe Klan planned to march in tour Fresno
( ounty c omnium ties Sunday to protest arrests
of klansmen in the south last summer.
Hansen said .it a press conference that he
told Jeffrey Murray, grand dragon of the
C alifornia kkk, that "this is not intended to be
a denial of your constitutional rights of free
speech and assembly ... I realize that your
.ic tions might not have been intended to pro
voke . . a disturbance, but I am sure it will do
SO. "
Murray, contacted by telephone, said the
KKk will not march in any town unless it has
legal permission.
'It we get permission to march, we will
march, he said. It it is denied, we will take
other action, probably legal."
Since the weekend violence in North
C arolina, at least two groups have demanded
that the previously announced Klan march
here be stopped.
