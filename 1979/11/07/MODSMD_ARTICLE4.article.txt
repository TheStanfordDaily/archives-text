# Coutts housing plan runs into roadblock
## 
### 
The proposed Peter Coutts Hill fa
culty housing development ran intoa
roadblock at Monday night's Palo
Alto City Council meeting.
The council failed to amend the
city's Comprehensive Plan to include
the proposed 140 housing units on a
20-acre parcel.
Needing a five-vote majority to
pass the amendment, the council
voted 4-2 for the amendment. Coun
cilmember Gary Fazzino was absent
and councilmembers Anne Withers
poon and Byron Sher disqualified
themselves from voting on the issue
because they both work for the Uni
versity which owns the site.
Councilmembers Emily Renzel and
Francis Brenner voted against the
amendment. They said they wanted
to see the city's Policy and Proce
dures Committee report on the an
nexation of the hill into Palo Alto be
fore taking action.
The housing project, located just
west of the College Terrace
neighborhood, between Page Mill
Road and Stanford Avenue, is de
signed to house junior staff and fa
culty members. The units are slated
to range in size from 1000 to 2000
square feet, the largest having three
bedrooms and a studio.
The units will be priced between
$100,000 and $200,000 with liberal
financing made available.
Many Palo Alto residents, how
ever, favor keeping the site open so it
can be used as a municipal park. The
project has been redesigned seven
time to try to satisfy local residents'
wishes for as much open space as
possible.
Architects' plans have ranged from
a 140-unit subdivision of con

dominiums, duplexes and single
family houses to the present 10
multi-unit clusters of two- and
three-story apartment buildings.
University officials had expected
the project to be completed in the
mid-1980s if the plan were received
favorably by Santa Clara County and
Palo Alto.
The housing project is a major link
in the University's efforts to attract
prospective taculty members. Shor
tage of dwelling in the mid-peninsula
has deterred some professors from
coming here, many University offi
cials believe.
President Richard Lyman told the
Academic Council last month that
the housing shortage here, com
bined with the high cost of housing
in the area, has been the major factor
in impeding faculty recruitment.
The issue of the Peter Coutts Hill
housing project will likely go before
the county's Planning Commission in
lanuary. The county Board of Super
visors will have final say on the pro
ject, although they will carefully
weigh the sentiments of the City
Council, according to Naphtali Knox,
Palo Alto's director of planning.
Knox said that if the city's Com
prehensive Plan is not amended to
include the housing project the con
struction will not take place.
Palo Alto Mayor Alan Henderson
said he was disappointed with the
council's action on the project. He
favored the proposed amendment to
the Comprehensive Plan and said it
was not fair to the University and Col
lege Terrace residents to "rehash"
the issue without notice prior to the
meeting.
