# Anti-busing, spending limit propositions winning statewide
## 
### Associated Press 
Californians gave landslide ap
proval yesterday to the "Spirit of 13,"
government spending limits initia
tive and to an anti-busing amend
ment to the state constitution.
Proposition 4, the state and local
government spending limits mea
sure, led by nearly 3-1, 880,586 to
318,960, with 37 percent of the
statewide vote tabulated.
The anti-busing constitutional
amendment, Proposition 1, was
ahead in every county, with the
"yes" vote totaling 795,584, or 65
percent, and the "no" vote totaling
425,946, or 35 percent.
In San Francisco, Dianne Feins
tein, who became interim mayor fol
lowing the assassination of George
Moscone last year, narrowly led
Supervisor Quentin Kopp in a 10-way
race for a full four-year term as
mayor. They face a Dec. 11 runoff.
With 513 of 905 precincts report
ing, Feinstein had 45,716 votes to
Kopp's 44,665 in unofficial returns.
David Scott trailed a distant third
with 10,533 votes after about 56 per
cent of the votes counted.
San Francisco District Attorney )oe
Freitas trailed challenger Arlo Smith
in San Francisco, but had enough
votes to foice a runoff. Freitas has
been sharply criticized for his pro
secution of Moscone's assassin Dan
White, who received a relatively light
sentence.
Two controversial San Francisco
ballot propositions, a 20-story limit
on new skyscrapers and a rent con
trol measure, both trailed in early re
turns.
Another statewide ballot proposi
tion that would repeal a 45-year-old J
interest ceiling on some business
loans also was approved by voters.
That measure, Proposition 2, was
depicted in television commercials
as a step toward lower interest rates,
and there was no opposition cam
paign.
Proposition 3, a technical revision
to clarify the homeowner's exemp
tion, won by a 3-1 margin.
Growth control measures were
trailing in early returns in six of eight
California communities where there
were local issues on the ballot, in
cluding the San Francisco skyscraper
limit.

The only growth control proposals
winning in early returns were a River
side limit on lot sizes for hillside
properties and a nonbinding re
ferendum in Santa Barbara County to
limit growth in the Santa Vnez Valley.
Marin voters rejected four options
for development of Hamilton Air
Force Base while supporting con
tinued construction of the Warm
Springs Dam.
The 1271-acre Marin County air
field has been a political football
since it was declared surplus by the
U.S. Air Force three years ago.
With more than 60 percent of the
vote counted, voters were rejecting
all four ballot measures, ranging
from using the field for a civilian air
field to creating a high-technology
"solar village."
Proposition 4, the "Spirit of 13"
spending-limit initiative authored by
Proposition 13 co-author Paul Gann,
was very nearly a carbon copy of the
spending limits initiative which
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan tried un
successfully to enact in California's
last statewide special election six
years ago.
But while Reagan's Proposition 1 of
1973 was defeated after a hard-fought
campaign that divided California's
political leadership into two warring
factions, Gann's Proposition 4 was
endorsed — albeit reluctantly in
some cases — by almost every major
figure in both parties.
The reason for the changed at
mosphere was Proposition 13, the
property tax initiative Gann and
Howard )arvis put on the ballot last
year that sparked a nationwide tax
payer revolt.
Gann said his spending limit prop
osal is intended to make sure the tax
cuts which followed enactment of
Proposition 13 aren't undone.
Proposition 4 would attempt to do
that by restricting the annual growth
in state and local government
budgets to the increase in the Con
sumer Price Index plus a propor
tional adjustment for population
growth.
Neither side in the Proposition 1
campaign expected yesterday's vote
to settle the busing question, since a
court challenge was planned from
the beginning lay Proposition 1 foes.
