# Medical testing done here on several species
## Research bill may cut live-animal testing 
### Helen Casabona 
If a bill recently proposed in the House of Rep
resentatives passes, scientists nationwide may
lose as much as 50 percent of their government
funding for live animal research.
Bill H.R. 4805, cited as the "Research Moderni
zation Act," proposes establishing a National
Center for Alternative Research. Each agency rep
resented in the Center must allocate 30 to 50 per
cent of its funding for live animal research to the
development of alternative methods of research
and testing. Such methods would include use of
mathematical models, cell cultures, isolated or
gans and computer simulations.
The bill was introduced on July 16 by Represen
tatives Robert Roe (D-NJ), Harold Hollenbeck (R-
N)), Lester Wolff (D-NY) and Frederick Richmond
(D-NY).
According to Art Craig, legislative assistant to
Richmond, the bill should be heard by the
House Committee on Science and Technology
early next year.
According to the National Society for Medical
Research (NSMR), the bill was designed by an
tivivisectionists who, having failed to stop live
animal research by accusing scientists of cruelty
and torture, are now trying to achieve this goal by
depeleting government funding.

This would require new systems of budget and
monetary planning in every government agency
presently funding animal research. The NSMR
stated that the bill could only have a "catastrophic
impact on biochemical research" and it violates all
principles of scientific freedom.
The bill is "outlandish" said Dr. fames Dewson,
acting director of the Division of Laboratory Ani
mal Medicine here. He said it would "throw a
monkey wrench" in medical research. "I don't
think it's going to go through â€” it's ludicrous."
There is presently a computer in Santa Barbara,
programmed as a schizophrenic, being analyzed
by psychiatrists. In this case machines rather than
live specimens are being used. But according to
the NSMR, passage of this bill would halt the
growth of "medical knowledge that would in
crease the quality of both animals and mankind."
But, said Craig, the purpose of this bill is to
"reduce unnecessary testing" with live animals. It
does not suggest that all animal testing should be
abolished, he said.
Where such research is needed "the bill would
have no impact at all."
The use of live animals is a major part of
medicine research at the Med Center here. Diffe
rent species are used in certain fields of study

according to their physical similarities to humans.
For example, Dewson has been working with
the same monkeys for nine years in a study at
tempting to show that monkeys have brains with
intellectual capacities similar to man's. This exper
iment involves surgically removing the portion of a
monkey's brain that may correspond to the lan
guage center of a human brain, and monitoring
the monkey's ability to remember sounds which
had previously been familiar to it.
Dogs are used also in a study on narcolepsy
because they have been found to inherit the dis
ease. Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder for
which there is no cure, that currently afflicts ap
proximately 250,000 Americans, according to the
American Narcolepsy association.
In 1976 researchers at the Med Center subjected
mice with incurable tumors to ultra-sound treat
ments. Earlier this year similar treatments were
administered to humans with positive results.
Researchers here have also worked with calves
in cardiological research because their circulatory
system is similar to humans. The calves were im
planted with an electronic device that artificially
pumps the heart. If perfected, this pump would
enable heart attack victims and people with weak
hearts to live longer.
