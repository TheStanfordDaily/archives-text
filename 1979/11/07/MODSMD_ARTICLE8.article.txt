## Israeli M.P. urges Mideast concessions 
### Ken Kurosu 
Israel should take the initia
tivein facilitating an agreement
on Palestinian self-rule on the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
Meir Pa'il, a member of the Is
raeli Knesset (parliament) said
here Thursday at a speech
sponsored by Stanford Hillei.
"The state of Israel now
holds the most important keys
to break the stalemate and
open the door to further ac
complishments," Pa'il said to
150 persons.
Pa'il, a member of Israel's
minority Shelli Party which
holds two seats in the 120 seat
Knesset called his views rep
tesentative of Israel's
"peacenik minority."
"We must combine the car
rot with the stick to bring
others into the peace pro
cess," he said.
"lhe IDL (Israeli Defense
forces) are our powerful
slick," he noted. The West
Bank and Gaza Strip are the key
"carrots," he said.
Yet Prime Minister
Menachem Begin's ruling

Likud coalition as well as the
leading opposition Labor Party
seem determined to prevent a
settlement, he said.
"The Israeli coalition and
Labor opposition reject
ideologically, and especially
politically the idea of establish
ing Palestinian government in
the West Bank and Gaza," he
said.
While Begin's government
accepts limited personal au
tonomy for Palestinians, it re
fuses to accept political or na
tional autonomy, Pa'il said.
"By encouraging new set
tlements, the government is
trying to create a system of es
tablished facts," which cannot
be challenged in negotiation,
he said.
The Likud and Labo'r opposi
tion seem determined to do
"whatever they can to face the
Egyptians and Americans in
1980 and say 'we tried but there
was no one to negotiate
with,' " Pa'il said. The Camp
David accords set 1980 as a
target for beginning discus
sions on the future of Palesti

nian self-rule on the West
Bank.
Palestinian and Arab refusal
to negotiate with Israel is not
surprising, given Israel's re
fusal to offer important con
cessions, Pa'il said.
"Instead of trying to out
maneuver their Camp David
pledges and wait for the next
war, why shouldn't the Israeli
government adopt the oppo
site attitude?" Pa'il asked.
Pa'il proposed a two point
declaration on the part of the
Israeli government to indicate
Israeli readiness to "support
the process of creating a na
tional home for the Palestinian
people."
This declaration would be
based on two principles, he
said, one on mutual political
recognition of self
determination rights by the
Palestinians and Israel. The
other would be a geographic
principle, showing Israel's wil
lingness in principle, to
evacuate the West Bank and
Gaza Strip for the establish
ment of a Palestinian state af

filiated with Israel or Jordan, or
an independent state.
Any Palestinian leader who
desires to negotiate the details
of such an agreement would be
welcome, Pa'il said, including
members of the Palestine Lib
eration Organization (PLO).
"No one should like the
PLO," he said. "But the PLO is
accepted in most places as the
most legitimate representative
of the Palestinian cause."
Pa'il cited PLO softening on
major issues as a sign that PLO
leaders could be enticed to
negotiate. The oft-quoted
Palestinian covenant which
calls for the elimination of Is
rael is in the "process of be
coming important only as a his
torical document," Pa'il said.
If Israel does not take the in
itiative, war is inevitable, he
added.
"We have a good chance to
win such a war. But in the peak
of military achievements, one
can envisage the big powers,
especially the United States in
tervening," he said.
"The United States would
not be happy to see Israel con
fronting Saudi Arabia," he
noted. The result would be
another Israeli military victory
accompanied by a political set
back, as was the case in the
1973 Yom Kippur.war, he said.

maneuver their Camp David
pledges and wait for the next
war, why shouldn't the Israeli
government adopt the oppo
site attitude?" Pa'il asked.
Pa'il proposed a two point
declaration on the part of the
Israeli government to indicate
Israeli readiness to "support
the process of creating a na
tional home for the Palestinian
people."
This declaration would be
based on two principles, he
said, one on mutual political
recognition of self
determination rights by the
Palestinians and Israel. The
other would be a geographic
principle, showing Israel's wil
lingness in principle, to
evacuate the West Bank and
Gaza Strip for the establish
ment of a Palestinian state af

filiated with Israel or Jordan, or
an independent state.
Any Palestinian leader who
desires to negotiate the details
of such an agreement would be
welcome, Pa'il said, including
members of the Palestine Lib
eration Organization (PLO).
"No one should like the
PLO," he said. "But the PLO is
accepted in most places as the
most legitimate representative
of the Palestinian cause."
Pa'il cited PLO softening on
major issues as a sign that PLO
leaders could be enticed to
negotiate. The oft-quoted
Palestinian covenant which
calls for the elimination of Is
rael is in the "process of be
coming important only as a his
torical document," Pa'il said.
If Israel does not take the in
itiative, war is inevitable, he
added.
"We have a good chance to
win such a war. But in the peak
of military achievements, one
can envisage the big powers,
especially the United States in
tervening," he said.
"The United States would
not be happy to see Israel con
fronting Saudi Arabia," he
noted. The result would be
another Israeli military victory
accompanied by a political set
back, as was the case in the
1973 Yom Kippur.war, he said.
Israel should take the initia
tivein facilitating an agreement
on Palestinian self-rule on the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
Meir Pa'il, a member of the Is
raeli Knesset (parliament) said
here Thursday at a speech
sponsored by Stanford Hillei.
"The state of Israel now
holds the most important keys
to break the stalemate and
open the door to further ac
complishments," Pa'il said to
150 persons.
Pa'il, a member of Israel's
minority Shelli Party which
holds two seats in the 120 seat
Knesset called his views rep
tesentative of Israel's
"peacenik minority."
"We must combine the car
rot with the stick to bring
others into the peace pro
cess," he said.
"lhe IDL (Israeli Defense
forces) are our powerful
slick," he noted. The West
Bank and Gaza Strip are the key
"carrots," he said.
Yet Prime Minister
Menachem Begin's ruling

Likud coalition as well as the
leading opposition Labor Party
seem determined to prevent a
settlement, he said.
"The Israeli coalition and
Labor opposition reject
ideologically, and especially
politically the idea of establish
ing Palestinian government in
the West Bank and Gaza," he
said.
While Begin's government
accepts limited personal au
tonomy for Palestinians, it re
fuses to accept political or na
tional autonomy, Pa'il said.
"By encouraging new set
tlements, the government is
trying to create a system of es
tablished facts," which cannot
be challenged in negotiation,
he said.
The Likud and Labo'r opposi
tion seem determined to do
"whatever they can to face the
Egyptians and Americans in
1980 and say 'we tried but there
was no one to negotiate
with,' " Pa'il said. The Camp
David accords set 1980 as a
target for beginning discus
sions on the future of Palesti

nian self-rule on the West
Bank.
Palestinian and Arab refusal
to negotiate with Israel is not
surprising, given Israel's re
fusal to offer important con
cessions, Pa'il said.
"Instead of trying to out
maneuver their Camp David
pledges and wait for the next
war, why shouldn't the Israeli
government adopt the oppo
site attitude?" Pa'il asked.
Pa'il proposed a two point
declaration on the part of the
Israeli government to indicate
Israeli readiness to "support
the process of creating a na
tional home for the Palestinian
people."
This declaration would be
based on two principles, he
said, one on mutual political
