Seoul, South Korea (AP) —
South Korean intelligence
chief Kim |ae-kyu assassinated
President Park Chung-hee in
ari attempted coup because
"he had the illusion he was
best suited tor president," a
11rial investigative report said
yesterday.
I he chief of the Korean
Central Intelligence Agency
(KCIA) intended to turn the
martial law command into a
"revolutionary committee"
dtter the Oct. 26 killing and
lead a military revolution, the
report said. It added that inves
tigators found no involvement
by the military or foreign pow
ers.
I he report said Park's chief
secretary, Kim Ke-won, was
told by the KCIA chief shortly
before the Friday night dinner
that Park's chief bodyguard
was to be killed, but it added
the secretary did not know
Park also would be assassi
nated.
Park's secretary apparently
went along with the attempted
coup afterward, the report
said, but turned on the intelli
gence chief when he disco
vered it was not succeeding,
and told defense and armv

chiefs of staff Kim Jae-Kyu was
he killer.
It said eight persons had
been arrested — the KCIA chief
and five other men accused of
doing the killing, the presiden
tial chief secretary and another
KCIA man who allegedly de
stroyed evidence.
The eight are to have an
open trial before a martial law
military tribunal.
The report said two women
were present that Friday night
"to help with the dinner." They
were given false names in the
report, which did not disclose
whether they had been
wounded in the shooting or
their current whereabouts.
The report said 33 of the 111
persons interrogated were

chosen as witnesses, and the
others were released.
Monday, South Korea's chief
opposition leader called for
free elections to choose Park's
successor, and urged the gov
ernment to free an estimated
1000 political prisoners.
The Korean people are "anx
ious to see a change in the sys
tem," said Kim Young-sam,
head of the opposition New
Democratic Party.
Choi Kyu-hah, prime minis
ter in Park's cabinet, became
acting president under the
constitutional line of succes
sion. Five of Park's bodyguards
also were slain by KCIA mem
bers who opened fire on the
presidential group during a
dinner in a KCIA building.
