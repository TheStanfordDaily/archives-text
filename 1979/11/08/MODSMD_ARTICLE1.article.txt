# SLAC attracts magnet from Chicago lab
## 'Little Wheels' starts out on 21-day cross-country trek

The Great Magnet is coming. A
107-ton, silver doughnut-shaped
magnet — the heaviest load ever car
ried on U.S. highways — left Ar
gonne National Laboratory Monday
to start on a 2248-mile journey to its
new home at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator (SLAC).
Nicknamed "Little Wheels," the
trailer designed to carry the magnet
is 46 yards long. A 450-horsepower
diesel tractor pulls this load at an av
erage speed of 25 mph, and gets
about five miles to the gallon.
An arch in the center of the trailer
distributes the weight of the load so
that each of the rig's 120 wheels
exerts less pressure on the road sur
face than those of an average
tractor-trailer.
The superconducting magnet pro
duces a magnetic field 36,000 times
that of the earth. It will be used in the
High Resolution Spectometer (HRS)
experiment in the Positron-Electron
Project (PEP) at SLAC.
Before the magnet cou'd be
moved, it had to undergo a series of
changes. The direction needed for
the HRS experiment requires that the
magnet be used on what was origi
nally its side.
The inner coils of the magnet were
exposed and given supports to keep
the individual coils from slipping out
of alignment as a result of the mag
net's new orientation. All of the elec
trical lines, instrument leads, liquid
helium lines and other assorted pip
ing had to be rerouted to come out of
the new top.
Finally, the entire insulating and
shielding structure had to be rebuilt
onelayerat a time. The return yoke, a
carbon steel casing that fits around
the magnet to contain the magnetic
field and make it more uniform, was
also modified.
The magnet will arrive before
Thanksgiving, after about a 21-day
trip. Fully assembled, the HRS, will
weigh 2000 pounds. It will be
mounted so that it can be moved in
and out of the PEP beam.
The initial experiment will involve

scientists from Argonne, the Univer
sity of Michigan, Indiana University,
Purdue University, the Lawrence
Berkeley Lab and SLAC.
The magnet is being used in the
experiment to search for new
quarks, elementary particles of mat
ter that scientists believe may be the
basic building blocks of larger parti
cles, such as protons and neutrons.
Five varities of quarks have been dis
covered, but more may exist.
Quarks are found by examining
the results of collisions between par
ticles accelerated to very high ener
gies. The strength of the magnet will
cause the HRS to sharply bend the
paths of the charged particles so the
many particles can be differentiated.
SLAC will use drift chambers and
shower counters in the initial HRS
experiments. Later, other types of
detectors may be used.
A drift chamber is an array of cells
within the magnet made up of nar
row gas-filled tubes. When a charged
particle passes through a tube, it
knocks electrons off the gas. These
free electrons are detected by sense
wires in the tubes. An analysis of a
particle's travel can reveal its curva
tures, charge, momentum and mass.
A shower counter is a series of
parallel lead plates interspersed with
sheets of lucite, used to detect
pinought mesons. The pi-noughts
decay as soon as they appear into two
gamma rays, which in turn strike the
lead plates and are converted into
pairs of electrons off the lead, result
ing in a chain reaction that produces
a shower of electrons through the
plates. The reaction is detected by
the lucite as light. From this data sci
entists can learn about the pi-nought
that started the shower.
The magnet's previous function in
the Argonne Lab's bubble chamber
was also to bend the path of charged
particles. In a bubble chamber, a
subatomic charged particle passing
through liquid hydrogen leaves a
trail of bubbles which can be photo
graphed. The curvature of the path
allows scientists to calculate charge,
mass and velocity of the particle.

This 120 wheel trailer carries the heaviest load ever transported on U.S. highways. The 107 ton magnet is coming to SLAC from Argonne National Laboratory
outside Chicago to be used in the Positron-Electron Project.
