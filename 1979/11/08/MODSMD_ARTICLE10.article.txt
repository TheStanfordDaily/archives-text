# Chancellor eyes election coverage

New York (AP) — When NBC
treed Nightly News anchorman
David Brinkley to devote his
time to commentary and
coverage of the 1980 presiden
tial race, some TV people won
dered how co-anchor |ohn
Chancellor felt about it.
He telt just fine, despite his
own desire for a commen
tator's role.
' "That's my ultimate goal,"
Chancellor acknowledged in a
recent interview, "but not my
immediate goal. My immediate
goal, God willing, is to take this
program — Nightly News —
through the whole electoral
process, including the inaugu
ration, and I just have no idea
what will happen then."
Chancellor, who has an
chored the Nightly News since
Aug. 16,1971, makes no secret
of his longing to leave the desk
tor work as a correspondent
and commentator.
"I plan to involve myself in
covering the election, and I'll
certainly be at the conven
tions," he said. "And with
David's commentary, I'm
happy with the show's mix as it
stands. After the election, we'll
just have to talk about it."
Chancellor, 52, brought two
decades' experience in jour
nalism to the Nightly News. A
Chicago native, he started with
the Chicago Sun-Times in 1947,
working as a copy boy, repor
ter and feature writer, before
joining the local NBC affiliate
in 1950.
He has never lost the urge to
report from the field. In the last
three years, he has filed from
all over the world — Cairo,
Jerusalem, Tehran, New Delhi,
Warsaw, Paris, Brussels.
Chancellor is married and
lias a son and two daughters.
"With the presidential cam
paign already started," he said,
"I kind of said goodbye to Mrs.
Chancellor the other day. We
do that every four years."
lalkof Chancellor's eventual
departure from Nightly News
.comes with the news division
in a somewh • unsettled state,
3 condition brought on by an
almost complete overhaul at
the executive level.
Chancellor, asked about the
shakeup, recalled a speech by
Charles Kuralt of CBS at a re
cent meeting of CBS affiliates.
"Charlie said something of
. tlu j order: 'Who could not be
pleased working for a news or
ghnization that is run by such
distinguished people as Dick
Salant, Bill Small, Gordon
Manning, Sylvia Westerman,
Paul Greenberg . .
"Ihen he stopped," Chan
cellor said. " 'Oh, my God,' he
said, 'this is last year's speech.'
"That, I think, sums up to a
considerable degree what's
happened here," Chancellor

said. People I'm reporting to
now, with a few exceptions,
they're former CBS people."
Salant came to NBC News in
May after 17 years as president
of CBS News. In August he
hired Small, at the time a CBS
corporate executive in
Washington, to replace Lester
Crystal as president of NBC
News.
Greenberg, for three years a
producer of CBS' Evening
News with Walter Crnnkite,
preceded the two executives to
NBC in June 1978. He was
named executive producer of
the Nightly News in March.
Re-organization of the net
work's news division is part of a
general facelilt at NBC, which

in recent years has tumbled to
third in the prime-time ratings.
The new leadership almost
certainly will alter the news
operation. For the first time in
its 30-year history, the program
is in danger of tailing to third
place in the ratings.
"They say Bill Small is Mr.
Hard News," Chancellor said,
"and I think probably the pace
of the show is a little quicker.
We're trying to get more
stories in. But that's just how
we'r.e doing it. ... I don't see
any big changes in the near fu
ture."
Changes in news content are
more likely, Chancellor said.
"People are more concerned

about the economy and how it
affects them than any other
subject, and for us it's meant
learning and translating a
whole new area of knowledge.
"What we need now," he
said, "is a new word for it. It's
not just economics any more.
You get the presidential year
approaching, I'm wondering
how much of the politics of
1980 will be economic politics.
In the tumult of the campaign,
we've got to contribute to the
process of keeping people in
formed on exactly what is hap
pening.
"I see it," Chancellor said,
"as one of the most challeng
ing considerations facing all of
us in this business."
