# VD strain a mounting problem

Atlanta (AP) — A little-known
venereal disease that can cause
sterility and has the same signs
and symptoms as gonorrhea
has become a major public
health problem, the national
Center for Disease Control
said last Sunday.
The disease, called non
gonococcal urethritis, or NGU,
is caused by a bacteria called
chlamydia. Only in recent
years have doctors been able
to grow a c ulture off this bac
teria tor study, the CDC re
ported.
This is one reason why NGU
has become so common, al
though it is still a relative
stranger to the list of venereal
diseases, said Dr. Paul
Wiesiier, director of the CDC's
Venereal Control Division.
"Another reason is that it is
not a reportable disease under
the law and doctors have not
been treating it as a venereal
disease," Wiesner said in an in
terview.
The disease includes all
urethritis infections not caused
by gonococci.
"It is only in the past year
that we have understood the
number of conditions that
chlamydia can cause,"
Wiesner said.
Because NGU is not reporta

ble, no one is certain how
many cases of the disease exist.
Wiesner said the CDC esti
mates there are probably twice
as many men with NGU as
there are with gonorrhea.
"We are estimating that
there are about 2 million cases
of NGU this year," he said.
Public concern was absent as
NGU grew to become a threat
because historically it was not
recognized as VD, Weisner
said.
"People were unaware of its
seriousness," he said. "People
were not sure what it was."
NGU can sterilize both men
and women and it is a menace
to newborn babies, Weisnei
added.
The CDC's research indi
cates that women and children
experience an inordinate share
of NGU's effects: sterility, ec
topic pregnancy and infant
diseases.
"Babies acquire it from their
mothers at delivery, just as
they get gonorrhea. It causes

an eye infection which can be
treated — one which doesn't
cause blindness. But it also is
considered the most common
cause of pneumonia in chil
dren under eight weeks of
age," Weisner said.
Studies show that
c hlamydiae cause an estimated
50,000 eye infections and
25,000 cases of pneumonia per
year in infants.
Wiesner said he believes
NCU eventually will be in
cluded in the list of reportable
communicable diseases. But
he said states will first have to
pass laws placing the disease in
that category.
Tetracycline has been re
commended by the CDC as an
effective antibiotic lor fighting
both gonorrhea and NCU. The
CDC c onsiders intercourse the
only means of transmission for
both diseases.
However other doctors be
lieve it can be contracted by
other means, Wiesner noted.
