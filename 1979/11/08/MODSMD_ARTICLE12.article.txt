# Anti-Semitism stems from nonconformity-Abramsky
## 
### Theresa Simons 
The study of history is a
process of cross-examining
documents — everything
must be questioned, ac
cording to visiting professor
Chimen Abramsky.
"I have no sacred cows,"
he says of his approach to
his study of )ewish Civiliza
tion and Marxism.
Abramsky, professor of
Hebrew and Jewish studies
at University College in
London, is teaching a
course here on the lews in
Europe in the 17th and 18th
Century and one on Mar
xism.
Born in Russia, Abramsky
emigrated with his family to
England in 1932. He began
teaching in 1965, following
the success of Karl Marx and
the English Labor Move
ment, a volume he
coauthored with Henry Col
lins.
"The problem of the Jews
is how they survived in an
atmosphere that was hostile
to them. I am interested in a
minority that rejected com
pletely the religion of the
state. I want to find out why
a group of people living in
the same country would be
hated and despised by
others."
The phenomenon of
anti-Semitism has resulted
in many fallacious beliefs in
Christian history, according
to Abramsky. These include
the belief that Jews killed
God, that Jews used Christ
ian blood in their passover
ceremonies, and, a belief
shared by a secret anti-
Semite society and Hitler,
that Jews want to dominate
the world.

"Anti-Semitism is an irra
tional element. The Jews did
not conform. They were
odd, different," says Ab
ramsky.
In his Jewish history
course, Abramsky focuses
on Jewish survival. He
analyzes the first secular
debates on the Jews bet
ween Voltaire, "the father
of secular anti-Semitism,"
Montesquieu and Da Pinto.

"The questions were,
'what to do with this group
of people?' 'How do we get
rid of them?' How do we
make them lose their iden
tity?' " Abramsky explains.
The Jews did not lose
their identity, though, but
became a great intellectual
influence in Europe, accord
ing to Abramsky. Less than
100 people initiated the
small Zionist movement
that began in 1848.
"But this little movement
made a Jewish state," Ab
ramsky says.
"The future of the Jewish

State now is, of course, a
very acute problem of sec
urity. I think negotiations
should be started with the
Palestinian state, but who
the Palestinians are is not
for me to say," he com
mented.
Though Abramsky admits
Marx's "political analysis of
a high order," he feels that
Marx ignored many things,'
such as the irrational ele-

ment ol nationalism.
"Marx believes that with
the spread of knowledge,
national differences will
disappear. He equated that
if commodities take on an
international character, na
tional differences will dis
appear." Abramsky cited
the patriotism of the
Franco-Prussian War, World
War I and World War II as a
refutation of Marx's belief.
Abramsky finds the en
thusiasm of his students at
the University very refresh
ing.
