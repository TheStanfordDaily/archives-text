It must be pointed out that
our society, so concerned to
defend the rights of the em
bryo, shows no interest in the
children once they are
born. . . . It must be said in ad
dition that the men with the
most scrupulous respect for
embryonic life are also most
eagerly officious when it
comes to condemning adults
to war.
Simone de Beauvoir,
The Second Sex
Upon reading this passage as
part of an assignment for a
class this quarter, I stopped to
think how far we've come in
terms of abortion, yet how lit
tle; or at least how easily the
right we've been given could
be revoked.
I had not given a great
amount of thought to the topic
of abortion this quarter, but as
I wrote a critical paper on
Beauvoir's views and thought
how they are applicable today,
I realized how little I knew
about terms of legislation to
day.
As I listened to the Center for
Research on Women (CROW)
lecture and informal discus
sion given Oct. 31 by Karen
Mulhauser on The Politics of
Abortion, I discovered that it's
a common situation that
people aren't highly know
ledgeable about present legis
lation.
The first fact that Mulhauser
presented was that the Sup
reme Court declared abortion
a constitutionally guaranteed
right in January 1973. Other
legalities she discussed in
clude:
— In 1977, the Supreme
Court deemed that states can
not be required to pay for elec
tive abortions and that public
hospitals are not required to
perform therapeutic abor
tions;
—In 1978, the Hyde
Amendment declared that no

abortions would be funded ex
cept in the cases of rape, incest
or lasting physical damage to
the mother.
Initially, I was disturbed at
the lack of knowledge I had,
and that many people have. I
was especially upset because
abortion is a topic that is quite
universal and important — it
has touched almost everyone's
lives either directly or indi
rectly.
Although I have not formed
definite opinions on all facets
of the abortion issue, I strongly
believe it is a personal deci
sion, and that the woman
should have a right to choose.
Therefore, I wasn't only upset
by my lack of knowledge, but,
by the increasing restrictions
on the woman's right to
choose. Congress' legislation
seems to be getting continually
more strict on issues concern
ing abortion.
Even though polls show that
70-80 percent of Americans
want to keep abortion legal,
the smaller anti-abortion
movement is much more
strongly organized and work
ing harder than those who
want to keep abortion legal.
The trend of legislation shows
the effects of their efforts.
My point is ultimately that
whatever view you hold con
cerning abortion, it is impor
tant to become aware of the
issue, and if possible, to ac
tively support your feelings.
The point Mulhauser made is
that whatever a person thinks
about abortion, or any topic, it
is important to become active,
especially by voting. It is im
portant to try to affect the
world where issues hold sig
nificance to us and where we
have a chance to express our
selves.
It is too easy to get enclosed
within the world of Stanford,
and admittedly, I have myself.

But this is also one of the few
times and places in my life
where there is so much going
on within close proximity —
such as lectures and rallies —
and so many people with
whom to share and discuss
feelings about the world out
side Stanford.
