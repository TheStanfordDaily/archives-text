## Life Skills Ability Test (LSAT) 
### 
Princeton, N.J., Nov. 8,
1989: The Educational Test
ing Service (ETS) announced
today that Life Skills Ability Test
(LSAT) scores are nearly
finished and the computers
will be spewing forth notifica
tions any day now. The LSAT
was instituted back in 1984 as a
means of giving government
genetics committees a stan
dardized tool for measuring
differences in human abilities.
The scores are combined with
General Personality Accepta
bility (CPA) scores and an Ad
missions index score is gener
ated.
Those with the highest index
scores are admitted to the top
breeding camps in the nation
where they mate and produce
tomorrow's leaders. The prog
ram was vociferously opposed
by lame-duck President Ed
ward Kennedy but by 1984
Richard Nixon had made such a
strong popular resurgence that
Kennedy could not mount an
effective opposition campaign.
When Nixon returned to
power in 1984 and utilized his
landslide victory to push

through his Comprehensive
Reorganization of Administra
tive Procedure Program
(CRAPP), some said that to
talitarianism had finally come
to pass in America.
Leader Nixon responded to
these criticisms by establishing
Silent Majority camps where
those who disagreed with his
policies could enroll for
thought rectification.
ETS tests used in these
camps proved so successful
that the firm was the obvious
choice where the need arose
for tests to screen candidates
to the eugenics camps.
The LSAT consists of seven
sections and is designed to
measure a wide spectrum of
human abilities including In
nate Moral Decency, Intrinsic
Human Worth, Right-Thinking
Ability, Malleability to Author
ity and other qualities deemed
important by the camp ad
ministrators.
But, admissions officers say,
the score alone does not de
termine a candidate's admis
sability.
"We also look very closely at

a candidate's CPA before de
ciding to admit," said one
dean. He was referring to the
General Personal Acceptability
score which is gleaned from a
lifetime of experiences.
A tiny sophisticated trans
mitter attached to a person's
head at birth sends signals to a
central computer facility which
compiles a complete microt
ranscript of every word a per
son speaks or writes. This is
processed annually through a
complex formula to yield a
yearly GPA.
At the Highly Anal Retentive
Village for Advanced Research
and Development (HAR
VARD), the dean was particu
larly effusive about these new
psychometric capabilities.
"These tests have made our
admissions process almost
foolproof," she said.
The HARVARD camp created
controversy by using genetic
recombination techniques in
its admits to further insure that
offspring would perform up to
standards. A gene was isolated
from circus dogs that showed

an unusually high propensity
for hoop-jumping. Trainers
were impressed by the dogs'
eagerness to please their mas
ters and an alert geneticist
made the connection. He iso
lated the so-called "eagerness
io please" (ETP) gene from dif
ferentiated brain cells in the
dogs and spliced it into DNA in
the brains of human embryos
at HARVARD.
Results were uneven at first.
The offspring were close to op
timal in their performance
characteristics, but had to be
kept from anything resembling
a hoop since they would at
tempt to leap through it almost
automatically.
Researchers at the Superbly
Trained Admits for Orderly
Research and Development
(STANFORD) institute, have
produced similar results and
admissions officers at the
STANFORD eugenics camp
were almost as enthusiastic as
those at HARVARD.
"We like to think of ourse
lves as being a little different
from the Eastern eugenics
camps," said Dean
Hjertleberger. "We're trying to
create a strain of more ba
lanced performers who are a
little more refined on their
demonstration of ETP.
Accordingly, the STANFORD
geneticists have tried to com
bine an ETP gene with a so
called "California Casual" or
"CC" trait.
"The resulting ETP-CC
phenotypes are more to our
liking than the gung-ho strain
of Eastern origin which lacks
the CC modification enzymes"
said Hjertleberger.
It appears that a specimen
will be created very soon who
will be capable of getting per
fect scores on both the LSAT
and CPA. Once that has been
achieved, cloning techniques
will enable the camp to be
come self-sufficient, and re
cruitment from the masses will
be obsolete.
