Fast Day
The pictures of starving
Cambodian children that flash
across the television screen are
too horrible and incom
prehensible to really make an
impact on our media-hardened
consciences.
We find real hunger a par
ticularly difficult concept to
deal with not so much because
we are gluttons or even over
fed, but because we don't care
enough about food to consider
what it would be like not to
have it.
Isolated from the primary
production of food and living
in an institutionalized situation
where most of our meals are
processed by others, we take
the privilege of being able to
"grab something to eat" for
granted.
While removing ourselves
from direct dependency upon
this year's harvest for our im
mediate survival, we have
moved to the other extreme of
the consumption pattern by
eating whatever nicely proces
sed garbage that is most con
veniently at our disposal.
Perhaps if we were more
concerned about what we our
selves are consuming, we
could be more sympathetic
with those who aren't eating
anything at all.
If you care about food, try

becomingone of the hungry —
if only for a few hours. Partici
pate in the Day of Fasting, Nov.
20.

Thanks Mildred
Thank you, Mildred Nilsson,
tor putting me back on the
track with your compassionate
column (Daily, Nov. 5). You
really brought into focus the
invalidity of my anger at not
being able to support myself
adequately within the context
of my 40-hour work week here
at Stanford.
I'll remember your kind
support as I go home after
work to another job which
helps make ends meet. Your
words about student wives will
ring in my ears the nfext time
my teenage daughter asks to
borrow the car — an 11-year
old bus in for its third valve job.
I'll remember how fortunate
I am when I explain to her I
can't even afford to put her on
my insurance. I'll keep in mind
that I'm responsible for my
choice of working here at Stan
ford. After all, the environment
here is more enlightened than
the corporate meat markets.
And I want to thank you for
reminding me of my mistake in

not hitching up with a
Stanford-bound, upwardly
mobile man who would sup
port me as well as your hus
band.
Thanks again for (1) your
sensitive understanding of
how the other half lives and (2)
for reminding me of my sin of
being single and a secretary.

Once again the Stanford
community has shown its in
decision in choosing a mascot.
But wait — it's not our fault!
With the uninspiring choices
we were presented, the results
could hardly have been other
wise. Now is the proper time to
unveil the obvious and unde
niable choice for mascot.
As we all know, the beautiful
acreage on which this great in
stitution of higher learning is
located is affectionately known
as "The Farm." What then,
could possibly be a more
natural choice for mascot than
the Stanford Farmers?
The farmer embodies many
of the same virtues that can be
found among the members of
the Stanford community. Not
only are they diligent, hard
working and environmentally
conscious, but like many Stan

ford students, they are actively
involved in the cultivation of
crops. But there is more
involved here than simply
choosing a mascot — the fu
ture of our country is at stake.
America cannot survive
without farmers. Farmers need
supporters to champion their
cause. We need a symbol
through which to support our
champions. So it is obvious
that America cannot survive
unless the Farmer becomes
our mascot.
As mascot, the Farmer is in
keeping with Stanford tradi
tion. Like the Band, it would be
a unique and refreshing addi
tion to the Stanford image. The
old guy in "American Gothic"
(the famous painting by Grant
Wood) would make a delight
ful and distinctive symbol.
Also, such a choice would
clearly be acceptable to the
alumni since, as any of them
can attest, both groups are
richly rewarded for the "fruits"
of their labor.
So grab your hoe and jump
on the tractor! The Friends of
the Farmer are out to sow your
support and put the mascot
controversy out to pasture
once and for all. Plow 'em un
der, Farmers!

Bike season
Well, it's that time of year
again; the time when countless
hordes of ravenous bicyclists
descend on small clusters of
helpless bipeds.
I personally have been the
object of numerous such as
saults. It goes something like
this:
Someone is walking to class.
Suddenly a speeding blur ap
proaches with a near-infinite
momentum. The person has
the choice of performing ac
robatics or sustaining the high
cost of medical care.

The Daily will be publishing the second edition of The Stanford
Daily Magazine at the end of November. The subject for this issue
will be "Stanford in the 19705." There will be space in the issue
devoted to columns and letters on the general theme of
"Thoughts About Life on the Farm in the Past Decade." Members
of the Stanford community are encouraged to contribute to this
section and are invited to submit the columns to the Daily office
by Friday, Nov. 16. Contributions should be typed, double
spaced on a 57-space I'ne, and preferably no longer than 80 lines.
Please identify your position in the Stanford Community.

I lived in France for two
years, and rode a bicycle six
days a week, often as much as
ten or fifteen miles a day. I
know that bicycle safety is, as
the expression goes, no acci
dent.
The Europeans, after many
years of practice, have de
veloped the awareness that a
bicycle can be dangerous both
to the bicyclist and to pedest
rians.
Accordingly, most of the
bicyclists are quite careful to
obey traffic signals.
At Stanford, obedience to
traffic laws is almost unheard
of. A minority of students are
quite careful to drive at moder
ate speeds and to stop at the
appropriate intersections. The
vast majority that I have ob
served, however, are oblivious
to the mere existence of traffic
regulations.
Traffic laws were made for
bicyclists just as they were for
motorists.
I have nearly run over several
myself when, after having
stopped at a traffic sign, I have
proceeded — only to have a
bicyclist cruise through the
stop sign and give me a dirty
look for not letting him pass.
It is not to be doubted that
bicycles are fantastic tools;
they save gas, build muscles
and are pleasant to ride. How
ever, those who ride them
should not feel in any way
exempted from practicing
safety and obeying traffic laws.
I do not particularly relish
the thought of being struck by
a bicyclist who is speeding
from one class to the next,
counting on me to look out but
not doing so likewise.
Nordo I relish the thought of
running over a bicyclist who
ignores a stoplight or who has
no light on his bicycle at night.
A little consideration and
common sense, for motorist
and bicyclist alike, would go a
long way toward improving
campus existence.

New Coffee House?
Rejoice, coffee drinkers!
The ASSU is coming to your res
cue, armed with an official
task force to make a student
bid for the Coffee House con
tract in April. Students can now
relax, quit worrying about the
whole issue, and retire to the
seclusion of a Meyer study car
rel.
The Task Force, which meets
tonight at 7 at the American
Studies house, already has all
the student representation it
needs. More than three stu
dents thronged to the last
meeting. It shouldn't bother us
that ex-workers of the Coffee
House, two of whom showed
up at the last Task Force meet
ing, are using the Task Force as
a vehicle for their desires.
After all, it was the old Cof
fee House workers who re
sisted student demand for beer
and wine last Spring. It was the
old Coffee House workers who
staunchly defended the bor
ing, esoteric, stifling atmos
phere against attempted
changes by TDS, changes
made at the request of an ASSU
Consumer Affairs task force

formed last Spring.
Some people say that both
TDS and the ex-workers are
losers, and that the ASSU stu
dent proposal should start
fresh. They say that this is the
student's chance to make the
Coffee House what it should
have been in the first place, a
lively center for campus life
and not another hang-out for
Santa Cruz nomads. These
people are obviously too
simplistic and don't see the
need for the ASSU to get
caught up in the Boycott con
troversy.
From now on, flip past Daily
stories on the Coffee House
and read Dupie instead. Study
hard for finals (Dead Week is
four weeks away), or take a
break and go socialize at Meyer
library or Terman, the two
main student centers on cam
pus. Come April, a new Coffee
House perfectly suited to stu
dents will magically appear.
With the ex-workers on the
task force, you know the stu
dent proposal is in good
hands.
