## Prevent Holocaust II 
### 
Editor's note: The following proclamation was
issued by President Carter on Nov. 2, and was
made available to editors and broadcasters
around the country in order to publicize the
plight of Cambodia's starving millions. A toll
free number (800-221-2870) has been established
for anyone wishing more information.
Thirty-seven years ago, a holocaust began that
was to take the lives of more than six million
human beings. The world stood by silently, in a
moral lapse whose enormity still numbs the
human mind.
We now face, once again, the threat of avoid
able death and suffering for literally millions of
people, and this time we must act swiftly to save
the men, women and children who are our
brothers and sisters in God's family.
The International Committee of the Red Cross
and the United Nations' Children's Fund re
cently appealed jointly for $111 million in aid to
help the millions of Kampucheans, formerly
known as Cambodians, who are facing death
from starvation during the next six months. We
must respond to this appeal, and we must also
respond to the related needs for food, medicine
and shelter for Kampuchean refugees who are
fleeing to Thailand.
A major program has been launched by the

American government to support this relief ef
fort, but it is too important to be left to the
government alone. I am certain that the Ameri
can people, as individuals and families, through
churches, schools, voluntary organizations, and
businesses, will want to be a part of this
emergency humanitarian response to a desper
ate and terrible need.
Now, therefore, I Jimmy Carter, President of
the United States of America, do hereby call
upon all Americans to give generously to the
voluntary relief agency of their choice to al
leviate this terrible suffering, asking specifically
that the donation be earmarked for Kampuc
hean relief.
Further, I hereby designate each Saturday and
Sunday in November until Thanksgiving as days
for Americans in their synagogues, churches,
and other places of worship to donate to this
cause, and I call upon leaders of the religious
community to take whatever measures are
needed to publicize and facilitate these dona
tions.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my
hand this second day of November, in the year
of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and
of the Independence of the United States of
America the two hundred and fourth.
