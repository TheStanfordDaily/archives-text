# Dec. 15 deadline
## Race to use coupons is on 
### Associated Press 
With just $20 in his bank ac
count, 33-year-old Earl Bunker
ran a newspaper ad offering to
buy half-fare airline coupons,
then wheeled and dealed his
way into a business worth
hundreds of thousands.
His good fortune is about to
end.
As the Dec. 15 deadline to
use United Airlines and Ameri
can Airlines discount chits ap
proaches, Bunker and hun
dreds of others are scrambling
to get some use from the
coupons — one way or
another.
Many coupon holders, un
able to take advantage of the
bargain before the deadline,
are selling their coupons for
prices ranging from $25 to $75.
Classified newspaper ads from
buyers and sellers have crop
ped up around the country.
Enticing offer
United and American distrib
uted the free coupons in May
to entice passengers to fly their
routes. The coupons permit
travelers to fly on most domes
tic flights for half price.
United started the promo
tion in an effort to regain pas
sengers lost during a 58-day
strike. American quickly fol
lowed suit, and both airlines
distributed coupons for three

weeks in May. Every passenger
flying during that period was
given a coupon, good tor half
off the price of another flight
anytime between July 1 and
Dec. 15.
United spokesman |oe Hop
kins in Cleveland says 2.2 mil
lion coupons were given out.
United projected that 85 per
cent of the coupons — 1.87
million — would be redeemed
by Dec. 15, but the latest fig
ures, calculated in August,
showed that only 550,000
coupons had been used.
'Holding back'
Hopkins remained optimis
tic the goal can be reached.
"I think there are some
people holding back to use
them during the Thanksgiving
period," he said. "The
coupons stashed in the back of
drawers will be pulled out and
redeemed."
American spokesman Al
Becker in Dallas said 1.8 million
coupons were issued, and
400,000 have been used. "We
expect 50 percent will be
used," he said.
Expected profit
Both spokesmen said their
companies expect the coupon
deal to turn a profit, but de
clined to predict how large it
would be.
When the coupon giveaway

was in operation this sprii g,
some people took short plane
rides just to get the half-fare
coupons that could be used on
longer flights later.
Travelers from Portland,
Ore., drove to Salem, about 40
miles south, and flew home at
full-fare to get coupons for use
on trips to places such as New
York or Chicago.
Merchandise exchange
A gift shop in the Eugene,
Ore., airport hung a sign offer
ing $40 in merchandise in ex
change for a coupon.
Now, with just 5Va weeks left
to expiration, anxious coupon
holders are lowering their
prices to try to unload the half
fare vouchers. Some have
turned to local travel agents for
help.
Dick Millstone, owner of
Clarksburg Travel Service in
Clarksburg, W. Va., said the
number of callers asking him to
buy the coupons at bargain
rates has increased in the past
few days.
Some travel agencies said
they refused to buy coupons;
others bought them and pas
sed the savings to the travel
ers; some kept the coupons for
the personal use of their
employees.
In Charleston, W. Va., Terry
Hauschilt placed a newspaper
ad two weeks ago, offering
three United coupons for $40
each, or all three for $100.
Hauschilt said he sold the
coupons at the $100 price the
first day his ad appeared.
Many coupon sellers have
simply tried to make a little
money. But others have made a
full-time business out of buy
ing and selling coupons.
In Wheeling, W. Va., a man
who asked not to be identified
said he bought 50coupons on a
"speculation deal." He refused
to say where he got the
coupons or how much he paid
for them, but he claimed to
have sold 30 at $70 each within
two weeks. The man said he
was confident he would sell
the rest and make a profit.
When asked what he will do
when the coupons become
worthless pieces of paper,
Bunker replied: "I'll get a job."
