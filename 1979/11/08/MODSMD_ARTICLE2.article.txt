# Rent control, anti-high-rise measures fail
## Feinstein to face Kopp in December runoff 
### Associated Press 
San Francisco's appointed mayor
and its most conservative supervisor
will face each other in a mayoral
runoff Dec. 11 after a lackluster
primary campaign in which a punk
rock singer finished fourth.
Dianne Feinstein, elevated to the
city's top office last November when
then-Mayor George Moscone was
assassinated, finished first Tuesday
in a 10-candidatefield. However, she
ran only 3331 votes ahead of Super
visor Quentin Kopp and her 42 per
cent total was well below the 50 per
cent mark needed to avoid a runoff.
"You keep faith with me the next
four weeks and I'll keep faith with the
city of San Francisco the next four
years," Kopp told his jubilant sup
porters when it became apparent he
had prolonged the campaign.
"Of course we're disappointed we
didn't win outright," Feinstein said.
"It means it will be a two-round fight.
I think the number of people who
voted for other candidates is signific
ant and I want those people to know
this is a mayor who is going to listen
to them."
Other candidates
Among those other candidates
were David Scott, a homosexual real
tor who finished third with nearly 10
percent of the vote, and Jello Biafra, a
punk rock singer who was fourth
with 3.4 percent.
Although Kopp trailed throughout

pre-election polls, final unofficial to
tals showed Mayor Feinstein with
81.115 votes, 0r42 percent, and Kopp
with 77,784, or 40.41 percent.
On other measures, San Francisco
voters soundly defeated proposi
tions which would have imposed
rent control, limited the height of
downtown buildings, abolished the
vice squad and doubled corporate
taxes.
Other cities
Burlingame voters rejected rent
control by a 2-1 margin. Cotati, how
ever, approved a rent control prop
osal by 543 to 445 votes.
The city of Mountain View passed a
ban on converting apartments into
condominiums.
Former state Sen. Arlen Gregorio,
47, made a comeback by winning a
seat on the San Mateo County Board
of Supervisors, defeating Redwood
City Councilman Mario Biagi.
Nancy Strausser was the top vote
getter in the race for seats on the
Santa Clara County Board of Educa
tion. Stan Barkdoll and David Baker
also won seats.
Statewide election
Final results of the special
statewide election showed that both
Proposition 4, putting cost-of-living
lids on state and local government
spending increases, and Proposition
1, banning court busing orders ex
cept in cases of deliberate segrega
tion, carried all 58 counties.

"There's a west wind blowing out
of California and, as best we can tell,
it's heading for Washington, D.C.,"
proclaimed Paul Cann, author of the
Proposition 4.
With all of fhe 15,000 precincts
counted, Proposition 4 polled
2,553,120 yes votes to 881,164 against
the measure.
Reaction to Prop 4
Reaction to Proposition 4's pas
sage underlined the change in cli
mate since 1973, when a similar
spending limit measure, sponsored
by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, was de
feated by a coalition of labor,
educators and liberals in a hard
fought campaign.
Seventeen months ago, California
voters sparked a national tax revolt
when they approved Proposition 13,
which slashed property taxes by $7
billion.
This time, liberals defected to the
spending limit cause in large num
bers. One of them, Assembly
Speaker Leo McCarthy, (D-San Fran
cisco), said yesterday that California
could adapt to the new limits.
"Any liberal, moderate or conser
vative can live with it,"he told repor
ters. "The fight will be on what prog
rams are funded with the money
that's available."
Assembly Minority Leader Carol
Hallett, (R-Atascadero) applauded
the measure's passage.
"It's a healthy sign that our gov

ernment is by the people and not |ust
something that is done to the
people," she said in a statement.
With the fiscal year starting next
July 1, Proposition 4 will limit the an
nual increases in state and local gov
ernment spending to the percentage
rise in cost of living or personal in
come, whichever is lower, plus
population. State surpluses must be
returned to the taxpayers every two
years.
Proposition 1, aimed at ending
court-ordered busing for integration
in Los Angeles, won by almost 2-1,
with 2,406,830 for and 1,101,022
against.
