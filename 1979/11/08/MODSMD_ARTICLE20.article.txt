The Stanford Debate
Team emerged with high
honors from statewide
competition at the Univer
sity of San Francisco last
weekend.
Sophomore Mariann
Byerwalter and freshman
Derrick Lopez won first
place in the novice division
during this first competition
of the year. Two other Stan
ford teams tied for third in
the open (advanced) divi
sion: freshman Dave Dod
son with junior Dave Hed
man, and junior Tom Hard
ing with sophomore Dan
I Taladini.
About 140 students from
23 California colleges and

universities met for the
tournament to debate the
topic: "Resolved: That the
United States significantly
increase the control of the
mass media."
The debate team here
meets as a class during fall 0
and winter quarters.
)ohn Roos, a third-year
law student who teaches the
class and coaches the de- g
baters, complained of lack
of funding for his team.
"Obviously we have ta
lent but no finances to send Q
that talent all over the coun
try," he said. "It is essential
that we get money if we are |
to continue to debate on the â–¡
national level."
