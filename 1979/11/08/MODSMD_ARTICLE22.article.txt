# Labor voice in management is no guarantee of "industrial democracy"
## 
### 
London (AP) — The proposed elevation
of Douglas Fraser, president of the United
Auto Workers, to the Chrysler board of
directors breaks new ground in the United
States, but it's old hat in Europe.
Many European nations have learned
that a labor voice in management does not
guarantee industrial peace, increased
productivity or "industrial democracy."
Worker representation on boards of di
rectors or other decision-making bodies is
firmly established in West Germany, Au
stria, the Netherlands and the Scandina
vian countries. The communist countries
of Eastern Europe also have highly de
veloped machinery for workers to have a
say in management decisions.
In contrast, Britain, France, Italy and
Switzerland have few or no worker
directors. Britain and Italy are among the
five countries most seriously affected by
labor troubles, based on working days lost
to strikes. But Switzerland ranks tops for
industrial peace.
' "Strikes are not decided by the super
visory board," says )oery Barczynski of IG
Metall, the metal workers union in

Frankfurt, West Germany.
"You don't believe anyone works more
or better because there happen to be labor
representatives on the board."
Where workers are included on boards
of directors, labor representatives often
complain that employers still manage to
render them powerless.
"Union members on the board arrive at
a loaded table," says Karl Aif, a metal
worker ombudsman in Sweden.
In some countries workers have ways
that stop short of the board room to influ
ence management decisions — participa
tion in supervisory councils and agree
ments for consultation with management.
In Italy, the Federazione Lavoratori
Metalmeccanici won for its 1.5 million
members the right to be informed about
and examine companies' production,
employment, budget and expansion
plans.
A status report on other European na
tions:
—Austria: Workers must have one-third
of the votes on supervisory councils,
roughly equivalent to the shareholders

meeting of a U.S. corporation. Workers
are not represented on company boards.
—Britain: Unions are strong but have
little or no representation in the board
room except in state-owned enterprises'
such as the Post Office and British Steel.
—Denmark: Corporations with at least
50 workers must have two employee rep
resentatives on their boards. But, says one
worker representative, "Workers will have
no real influence in management until
they control 50 percent of the shares."'
—France: Worker participation is
nonexistent, but worker councils within
industries confer with management on
working conditions.
—Netherlands: No workers are on
company boards, but companies with
more than 100 employees must have
"works councils" which employers must
advise and consult with on major deci
sions and finances.
—Soviet Union: The no-strike unions
govern wages and out-put quotas and can
request firing of higher officials, says
Alexei Shibayev, chairman of the All-
Union Central Council of Trade Unions.
