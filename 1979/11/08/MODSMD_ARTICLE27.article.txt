## Symphony sparked by Toth 
### 
Before Andor Toth joined
the Stanford music department
in 1978, he had already served
as associate conductor of the
Houston Symphony at age 24,
recorded with several major
record labels, toured exten
sively through Europe and the
United States, and founded
two ensembles — the Alma
Trio and Oberlin Conservat
ory's The New Hungarian
Quartet.
The Stanford conductor
brings a refreshingly healthy
attitude towards the perfor
mance of music. He must be
amply commended for the
quality and the intensity of the
program he selected tor the
Stanford Symphony's most re
cent concert in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The orchestra, fib members
strong, opened the perfor
mance with their interpreta
tion of Rossini's Semiramide
Overture, from the opera
based upon the tragedy of
Semiramis by Voltaire.
The symphony achieved a
full sound with fine support
from the lower brass. The
woodwind section had many
strong points as well, in< luding
accurate intonation, rich tone
color by the oboe, clean articil
lations by the clarinet and ex
cellent work by the piccolo in
various passages.
Toth next yielded the baton
to assistant conductor jean
nine Wagar in her debut with
the orchestra and joined his
son, Andor Toth, jr. in an up
lifting Derformance of the

Brahms Double Concerto in A
minor for Violin and Cello,
Opus 102. Music historian Wal
ter Niemann once wrote, "We
are bound to give up Brahms'
Double Concerto almost tor
lost both at present and in the
future, for it is so seldom
heard. This is because it de
mands 2 players of consum
mate technique and sure mas
tery, so thoroughly accus
tomed to playing together as
can hardly happen except with
members of the same family."
This was certainly the case at
hand, and it is no wonder that
the Toth father-son duo are so
frequently solicited to perform
this complex and difficult
work.
The Allegro was both drama
tic and deliberate with the pair
of soloists required to display
their virtuosity as early as the
first few measures of the
movement. Both artists por
trayed serious concentration
and commitment to the score
on all levels. They were playing
from the heart, as well as nearly
playing from memory. Their
physical animation visually
reinforced their intent to pro
duce the fullest possible
sound. They rode on top of the
Allegro's rhythmic drive in a
rugged sense, and interpreted
the contemplative thematic
material with refinement and
elegance.
The lyric al Andante was per
formed in legato, contrasting
the dynamic nature of the Al
legro. The Vivace was of a
lighter mood with glimpses of

folk music coloring me move
ment. Toth Sr. is the fine,
highly trained violinist who is
not ashamed to fiddle. Both
soloists made the folkloric im
plications of the Vivace come
alive with tearing musical runs
in unison and the bold intent to
support their technique.
The concerto grosso pro
vided a cathartic experience,
for the entire work was obvi
ously physically exhausting
particularly for the cello. The
audience came away with the
feeling that the intermission
was desperately needed by
Toth Sr. and the orchestra
members alike. Yet they all
seemed to muster up the
stamina that was required by
the final selection, a centenniel
celebration of the composer
Ottorino Respighi.
The Pines of Rome, a sym
phonic poem in tour parts was
performed in full force; the
Palo Alto High School off stage
brass choir, harpist Ruth
Bonapart, organ and celeste,
glockenspiel and even an ac
tual recording of a nightingale
helped complete the rich and
sonorous tapestry of the prog
rammatic poem.
Toth conceived (he piece on
a grandiose scale, and showed
what he would take in order to
attain what he had envisioned
for this finale. He is a brave and
enterprising conductor mak
ing good use of what he has to
work with. The tact that the
high school musicians, playing
from the back of the au
ditorium, were off tune (al
though they soon corrected
themselves) made little differ
ence to most members of the
audience. What made all the
difference in the world was to
see Andor Toth conducting the
symphony and the distant en
semble simultaneously.
Toth accomplished the ex
citement he sought after and
the sound he envisioned. And
perhaps he even inspired
another generation of musi
cians — from Palo Alto High
and elsewhere to keep practic -
ing. He showed the young
musicians that there is a place
for them, even in this world of
strict professionalism and
competition.
Toth must be acknowledged
lor a bold contribution to the
teaching of music and praised
for his good attitude and crea
tive drive. The orchestra, too,
should be praised for time well
spent, and a job well done.

high school musicians, playing
from the back of the au
ditorium, were off tune (al
though they soon corrected
themselves) made little differ

audience. What made all the
difference in the world was to
see Andor Toth conducting the
symphony and the distant en

Toth accomplished the ex

Luciana (joy Belin) practices her one-legged Shakespeare with the
help of Dromid (Troy Schmit) in the Company's production of Com
edy of Errors. Direc ted hy Marilu Magana, this 1920s rendition of the

Shakespearean classic will be shown November 8, 9 and 10 at H p.m.
with an additional show on Saturday, November 9at 10 p.m The play
is in the Toyon lounge and admission is free.


Sunday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium the Stanford Symphony performed works by Rossini, Brahms and Ottorino Respighi
Before Andor Toth joined
the Stanford music department
in 1978, he had already served
as associate conductor of the
Houston Symphony at age 24,
recorded with several major
record labels, toured exten
sively through Europe and the
United States, and founded
two ensembles — the Alma
Trio and Oberlin Conservat
ory's The New Hungarian
Quartet.
The Stanford conductor
brings a refreshingly healthy
attitude towards the perfor
mance of music. He must be
amply commended for the
quality and the intensity of the
program he selected tor the
Stanford Symphony's most re
cent concert in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The orchestra, fib members
strong, opened the perfor
mance with their interpreta
tion of Rossini's Semiramide
Overture, from the opera
based upon the tragedy of
Semiramis by Voltaire.
The symphony achieved a
full sound with fine support
from the lower brass. The
woodwind section had many
strong points as well, in< luding
accurate intonation, rich tone
color by the oboe, clean articil
lations by the clarinet and ex
cellent work by the piccolo in
various passages.
Toth next yielded the baton
to assistant conductor jean
nine Wagar in her debut with
the orchestra and joined his
son, Andor Toth, jr. in an up
lifting Derformance of the

Brahms Double Concerto in A
minor for Violin and Cello,
Opus 102. Music historian Wal
ter Niemann once wrote, "We
are bound to give up Brahms'
Double Concerto almost tor
lost both at present and in the
future, for it is so seldom
heard. This is because it de
mands 2 players of consum
mate technique and sure mas
tery, so thoroughly accus
tomed to playing together as
can hardly happen except with
members of the same family."
This was certainly the case at
hand, and it is no wonder that
the Toth father-son duo are so
frequently solicited to perform
this complex and difficult
work.
The Allegro was both drama
tic and deliberate with the pair
of soloists required to display
their virtuosity as early as the
first few measures of the
movement. Both artists por
trayed serious concentration
and commitment to the score
on all levels. They were playing
from the heart, as well as nearly
playing from memory. Their
physical animation visually
reinforced their intent to pro
duce the fullest possible
sound. They rode on top of the
Allegro's rhythmic drive in a
rugged sense, and interpreted
the contemplative thematic
material with refinement and
elegance.
The lyric al Andante was per
formed in legato, contrasting
the dynamic nature of the Al
legro. The Vivace was of a
lighter mood with glimpses of

folk music coloring me move
ment. Toth Sr. is the fine,
highly trained violinist who is
not ashamed to fiddle. Both
soloists made the folkloric im
plications of the Vivace come
alive with tearing musical runs
in unison and the bold intent to
support their technique.
The concerto grosso pro
vided a cathartic experience,
for the entire work was obvi
ously physically exhausting
particularly for the cello. The
audience came away with the
feeling that the intermission
was desperately needed by
Toth Sr. and the orchestra
members alike. Yet they all
seemed to muster up the
stamina that was required by
the final selection, a centenniel
celebration of the composer
Ottorino Respighi.
The Pines of Rome, a sym
phonic poem in tour parts was
performed in full force; the
Palo Alto High School off stage
brass choir, harpist Ruth
Bonapart, organ and celeste,
glockenspiel and even an ac
tual recording of a nightingale
helped complete the rich and
sonorous tapestry of the prog
rammatic poem.
