# Children of Darkness no better with age

Edwin justus Myer's play
Children of Darkness tailed to
stir public imagination in 19iO
when it premiered at the Balti
more theatre in New York and
it is hard to understand why
Berkeley Repertory's adapta
tion should fare any better to
day.
The play, written by Meyer in
the 20s, is as little known as
Meyer himself. If is set in Lon
don's notorious Newgate
prison in 1725. The prison
keeper, Mr. Snap, takes in
boarders of distinction, lor a
price.
One of them is Jonathan
Wild the Great, a leader among
highwaymen who is awaiting
execution, another is Count La
Ruse, a compulsive gambler
and thief who is serving time
for his debts. La Ruse dresses
in fashion, wields roses and
quotes poetry; Wild has no
pretensions.
The play is about their con
tinuing dishonesty with each
other. They cheat and pick
each other's pockets. Everyone
is greedy, especially Mr. Snap,
even though it does not make
them any better off.
In the center of it all is
Laetitia, Mr. Snap's daughter,
who grants "favors" to the
prisoners. She takes pleasure
in the knowledge that La Ruse,
her lover, has no better alter
natives.
La Ruse is completely unable
to resist her and when he tries,

Laetitia successfully plays oft a
young poet, Mr. Cartwright,
against him.
Mr. Snap,together with La
Ruse,squeeze money out of
Wild by promising a lull par
don. Wild is reluctant to pay
the money — his life is not
worth that much, he com
ments. But like all mortals, he
gives in only to be hanged the
next morning.
La Ruse gets, through clever
deceit, a good portion of the
money and so can buy his free
dom at last. Laetitia, afraid of
losing her prisoner, [joints
out that the freedom that he
has sought for so long is an illu
sion. La Ruse has no control
over his own lite, once outside
he would only resume the life
of drinking and gambling that
would soon bring him back.

He (La Ruse) admits defeat
but has one course left to tree
himself of Laetitia. He commits
suicide.
Perhaps there is a hint of a
serious examination of power
and sexuality, but it is not de
veloped. None of the charac
ters in the play are believable
except perhaps for Lord Wain
wright, well played by Don
West, who with a stiff upper lip
recognizes everyone for what
they are and exclaims that all
prisoners like himself are of
high rank.
The play tries throughout to
make some deep statements
about the human condition but
the only worthwhile wisdom is
Count La Ruse's quip that "it is
not the meek who shall inherit
the earth but lawyers."
There are some good per
formances. Dale Elliott as Wild

and Paul Laramore do all they
can to save the play but
Jahanna Beecham as Laetitia is
definitely not cruel enough.
The staging and costumes
are good, if is the direction that
is lacking. To create "the bot
tomless pit of misery, despair,
wickedness, violence and
death" that the program c laims
the prison to be, you need to
get at people psychologically.
It is not enough to show some
red dye spilled on a writhing
prisoner together with drama 4
tic music.
The Children of Darkness
can be seen Tuesday through
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday
at 2 and 7 p.m. at Berkeley Re-*
pertory Theatre, 2980 College
Avenue, Berkeley. For infor
mation call 845-4700.
