# Dylan, band play different tunes

bomeday they may be calling
it the Holy Roller Revue. Bob
Dylan's latest road show is as
much a religious revival act as a
rock and roll concert. As the
former, it succeeds well
enough. As the latter, it may
take some getting used to.
Thursday night's show, the
opening performance of a
two-week engagement at the
Warfield Theater, had been
something of a disaster. The
born-again singer received al
most as many boos as cheers
from a crowd who had paid
$12.50 or $15 apiece expect
ing to hearat least a few of their
old favorites. What they re
ceived instead was a program
consisting of all new material:
songs from Dylan's latest al
bum, Slow Train Coming,
along with newer, as yet unre
corded compositions. Many
fans felt cheated.
However, the fact that Dylan
played all new songs is admira
ble. Many popular artists stick
to the same old format year
after year, tour after tour, ad
ding at most two or three new
tunes to a set featuring tried
and true standards. While dis
appointing some of the audi
ence, Dylan showed a certain
courage in showcasing only his
most recent work.
With all this in mind one
could view the second night's
performance somewhat objec
tively. Much of the audience
had no doubt been prepared
for what was to come by re
views in Friday morning's pap
ers, or by reports from friends
who had seen the opening
concert. If Dylan had delivered
a better show Friday perhaps
all else could have been forgi
ven.
But Friday's performance
was uneven at best. Following
a half-hour set by the gospel
singers, who are part of his cur
rent band, Dylan opened with

"Gotta Serve Somebody,"
which featured a lethargic elec
tric piano solo by Spooner
Oldham. On the next tune, "I
Believe in You," guitarist Fred
Tackett stole Mark Knopfler's
guitar solo right off the re
corded version of the song.
"When You Gonna Wake Up"
was delivered in sluggish fash
ion, the band seemingly un
able to find its groove.
However, a few songs later,
somewhere in the middle of
"Slow Train," they caught fire.
Tackett, a respected L.A. ses
sion player, launched into a st
inging (and original) solo, and
drummer Jim Keltner started
driving the band hard.
Throughout fhe rest of the
show, there were three or four
similar highlights, especially
on the rock and roll numbers.
But often the eight members
of the band seemed to be
going in different directions.
Once, they ended a song with a
dramatic flourish, while a sur
prised Dylan kept on singing.
On "Blessed is the Name of the
Lord Forever," the gospel sing
ers began another chorus long
after the rest of the band had
stopped playing.
One would think that musi
cians backing an artist of Dy
lan's stature would all be able
to end a song at the same time.
One would think the band
would have rehearsed enough
in order to present a show
worthy of a $15 price tag.
The audience didn't seem to
mind the band's lack of Cohe
sion however, and they called
for two encores. The finale,
"Pressing On," featured Dylan
first at the piano, then standing
at the microphone, singing
with soulful, born-again fer
vor. It was an inspired ending
to an imperfect evening. Most
people went home happy.
After the show, San Fran
cisco impresario Bill Graham,
co-promoter of the concert

along with Dylan's manager
Jerry Weintraub, spoke aboul
the fans who had been
tressed by the content of D<J
lan's performance. "Last
was anger — it was bitte«r
sweetness. They (Thursday'*,
audience) wanted to taste thg
old flavor. We're all nostalgic,
slobs including me." Grahar*
stressed that people were dis>
appointed because experience;
had led them to expect the ol<jl
songs from Dylan. He re'*,
marked, "Ihe one thing (Dy<
lan's) been doing for fitteejft
years is playing the old song#
fake Oakland last year.

played them." £

Graham denied that the
promoters had misled the pub*
lie by not informing them that
Dylan would play all new mate*
rial. "Last night no one knew
he said. "There's nothing <k
promoter can do when an arS
tist walks on stage. I can't tel£
him (Dylan) what to do." «
Asked if he thought Dylan!
had failed in his responsibility
to his fans, Graham weighed;
his words thoughtfully, saying,£
"It would have been generous"
if the public were.*
forewarned." £
The audience Friday waifj
forewarned, and most enjoyecr*
the show. Yet one couldn't -
help feeling that something
wasn't quite right. It might
have been the lack of familiar
songs, or the weakness of the
band's performance. But it
could have been the way Dylan
looked, bathed in dreamlike,
pale green spotlight singing
"When He Returns." No one
would ever have thought that
this particular prophet would
be singing the praises of |esus
Christ.
Perhaps it will just take the
public a long time to get used
to a born-again Bob Dylan.

band's performance. But it
could have been the way Dylan

pale green spotlight singing
"When He Returns." No one

bomeday they may be calling

Dylan's latest road show is as
much a religious revival act as a
rock and roll concert. As the
former, it succeeds well
enough. As the latter, it may
take some getting used to.
Thursday night's show, the
opening performance of a
two-week engagement at the
Warfield Theater, had been
something of a disaster. The
born-again singer received al
most as many boos as cheers
from a crowd who had paid
$12.50 or $15 apiece expect
ing to hearat least a few of their
old favorites. What they re
ceived instead was a program
consisting of all new material:
songs from Dylan's latest al
bum, Slow Train Coming,
along with newer, as yet unre
corded compositions. Many
fans felt cheated.
However, the fact that Dylan
played all new songs is admira
ble. Many popular artists stick
to the same old format year
after year, tour after tour, ad
ding at most two or three new
tunes to a set featuring tried
and true standards. While dis
appointing some of the audi
ence, Dylan showed a certain
courage in showcasing only his
most recent work.
With all this in mind one
could view the second night's
performance somewhat objec
tively. Much of the audience
had no doubt been prepared
for what was to come by re
views in Friday morning's pap
ers, or by reports from friends
who had seen the opening
concert. If Dylan had delivered
a better show Friday perhaps
all else could have been forgi
ven.
But Friday's performance
was uneven at best. Following
a half-hour set by the gospel
singers, who are part of his cur
rent band, Dylan opened with

"Gotta Serve Somebody,"
which featured a lethargic elec
tric piano solo by Spooner
Oldham. On the next tune, "I
Believe in You," guitarist Fred
Tackett stole Mark Knopfler's
guitar solo right off the re
corded version of the song.
"When You Gonna Wake Up"
was delivered in sluggish fash
ion, the band seemingly un
able to find its groove.
However, a few songs later,
somewhere in the middle of
"Slow Train," they caught fire.
Tackett, a respected L.A. ses
sion player, launched into a st
inging (and original) solo, and
drummer Jim Keltner started
driving the band hard.
Throughout fhe rest of the
show, there were three or four
similar highlights, especially
on the rock and roll numbers.
But often the eight members
of the band seemed to be
going in different directions.
Once, they ended a song with a
dramatic flourish, while a sur
prised Dylan kept on singing.
On "Blessed is the Name of the
Lord Forever," the gospel sing
ers began another chorus long
after the rest of the band had
stopped playing.
One would think that musi
cians backing an artist of Dy
lan's stature would all be able
to end a song at the same time.
One would think the band
would have rehearsed enough
in order to present a show
worthy of a $15 price tag.
The audience didn't seem to
mind the band's lack of Cohe
sion however, and they called
for two encores. The finale,
"Pressing On," featured Dylan
first at the piano, then standing
at the microphone, singing
with soulful, born-again fer
vor. It was an inspired ending
to an imperfect evening. Most
people went home happy.
