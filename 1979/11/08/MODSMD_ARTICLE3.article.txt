# Senate recommends lighting
## 
### Fran Miller 
The ASSU Senate passed a re
solution last night recommending
that lighting for Encina tennis
courts be considered a "top prior
ity measure" by the Athletic De
partment.
In approving this resolution
proposed by the Senate Student
Affairs Committee, senators re
quested that the lighting be instal
led during the current academic
year, barring "unforeseen cir
cumstances." This proposal will
be reviewed by the Committe on
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation, which will then make
a final recommendation for this
project to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
Senators also voted to donate
$275 to the Big Came Committee
for a fireworks display.
"Since the senate is supposed
to be representative of the stu
dent body, it (the donation)
would be a feather in our cap,"
said Sen. Cecilia Mowatt during
discussion of the issue.

Student Affairs Committee
Chairman Val Runge presented a
resolution which urged "estab
lishment of a better program of
maintenance or notification to as
sure quick replacement of broken
or 'burned-out' lighting on cam
pus." The Senate approved this
resolution.
The Student Affairs Committee
proposed that a more vigorous
ticketing program be pursued by
Police Services to "effectively im
plement the ban on motorcycles
from campus bicycle and pedest
rian pathways."
After a lengthy discussion on
whether mopeds should be in
cluded in this request, the prop
osal was approved for motocycles
only, and will be sent to Police
Services.
In the Committee on Commit
tee's report, the guidelines for the
ASSU Coffee House Task Force
were approved.
The guidelines specify that vot
ing membership be limited to 15
persons, and should include at
least one ASSU financial manager

or designee, and Senate, Council
of Presidents and graduate stu
dent representation.
The task force is urged in the
guidelines to conduct surveys in
the Stanford Community as part
of its research, and is encouraged
to make progress reports to the
ASSU at least once a month.
Financial Manager Bruce Ben
dix reported that negotiations
with the University concerning
the ASSU operating budget for
1980-82 are underway.
Although the bill authored by
alternate Chris Greene and
Senator T.J. Heyman on senate at
tendence regulations was discus
sed at great length during the
meeting last night, senators de
cided to return it to the Rules
Committee for revision.
An additional nomination for
the Senate chair was taken, and
one was withdrawn, making a
total of eight nominees.
Short speeches were heard
from several of them last night,
but a final decision won't be made
until a later meeting.
