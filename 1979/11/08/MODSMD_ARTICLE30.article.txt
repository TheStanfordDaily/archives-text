The road to success in the
music business mav well be a
long one, but it certainly is not
an impossible one. Ask
leanette Chase, Lear Stevens,
David Devon and Ronni Han
sen, the members of a debut
group called Storm, who are
well on their way. The band en
tered the Bay Area this
weekend to do shows at the
keystones in Berkeley and Palo
Alto as a sort of "debut pre
tour."
It was only a couple ot years
ago that the group had played a
gig at the trailer parks ot some
unknown West Coast univer
sity in Palo Alto. Lead guitarist
Lear Stevens remembers it
quite well, Some f^irl took a
lamp, we didn't have a lighting
system back them, and we set

up in (he street. 112 veryhody had
to bring an extension < ord; we

up to somebody's In use
Friday night .it the Keystone
in Palo Alto, Storm did not
need a lamp and seven exten
sion cords. The band, based
out of Los Angeles, was up
here riding a wave o! potential
sue cess, with a newly ac quired
contract from MCA, and a
newly released album whit h is
getting airplay all over the
country. Their first single, I
Want You," is due out in a
t ouple ot weeks.
The band consists ot
leanette Chase on lead vocals,
Lear Stevens on lead guitar,
Ronni Hansen on bass, and
David Devon on drums; the
members share the keyboard

work. Storm's music can he
considered a blend between
the space rex k o! the early
seventies and the new wave of
the late seventies. Stevens
states that We're not rapping
up the sc\ enties by am means,
eighties' is what we call our
selves.
Chase and Stevens tirst met
while playing tolk music in L.A.
Bored with the lolk si ene, tlu'\
bought some electric instru
ments and eventuallv met Han
sen and Devon. I he tour began
to ;)lay as a group both down in
Los Angeles and up here on the
peninsula, under such names
as "The I .A. Jets" and
The band slowly moved awa\
trom the club scene as they
discovered that a majority of
the clubs required that they
play other artists' better known
material.
I bus, the band began to do
showcases lor various record
companies, allowing them to
do all original material. It was at
this point that they got signed
to MCA. Their tirst album,
Storm, was made in six weeks,
and released in September; it
is now out in record stores ac
ross the* country, and is getting
radio airplay everywhere.
According to Stevens, the
album has had a wide range of
appeal, and though it is in tact
quite popular with a lot ol earh
adolescent types, there are a
number of middle-aged fans
who follow everything the
band does, I istening to the al
bum, one c an see how it would
appeal to the typical high
school kid who wears a "bos
ton" t-shirt and rides a
skateboard, but it is rather hard
to see how the album could
appeal to the older, more dis
i rete roc k follower. I Inless you
are under sixteen, odds are
you have heard enough of this
kind ol Ilashy rot k belore.
I here is not any one style
whuh characterized Storm s
songs. Iheir selections range
from heavy duty rot kers to soil
ballads. ()n a lew songs, sih h
as "Young, Young, a last
pac ed rock beat is interrupted
by a few slower and softer
lines, and then begun again. In
reference to her diverse vocal
style, ( base states that ' I like
to do a lot ol different things. I
enjoy doing ballads, but I also
like doing roc k It's all right to
do a collection ol tilings."

form live, it can be said that it
might well be time lor Blondie
to move aside. Rather quiet
and subdued in an interview
belore the show, she got on
stage I r ida\ night and tore the
place apart, not only doing
vocals, but playing occasional
guitar and keyboards as well.
Upon tirst hearing Storm's al
bum, one might well think
Chase s vocals are electroni
cally speeded up; it was not
until seeing her live .hat I was
convinc ed she c ould really sing
at sue h a pace.
I hroughout the band's show
on lnda\ night, Stevens was
jumping all o\ei the stage in a
guitar frenzy, while ( hase rip
ped out vocals .is though she
owned them. It was unfortu
nate that the sound s\ stem was
such that C hase's vocals did
not come through that well,
and were often incomprehen
sible. On the otln md, Han
sen s bass and Devon's drums
were dear and solid, toward
the end ot the tirst two sets,
Stevens provided a quite im
pressive guitar solo, into which
he incorporated some ot Arlo
Guthrie s Al it e's Restaurant."
lor those who came for
reasons other than to hear
music , the highlight ol the
night was the band's encore, in
whu h Chase c ante out i lad in
stri(tl\ a ied t-shirt and red
boots, void ol the leather pants
she had been wearing. As she
pic ked up her guitar and began
to pla\ the image ol the next
great selling wall poster could
not help but float through
one's mind.
By the time the show was
over, it was dear that it music
was all that mattered in rock
today, Storm would be rather
far trom success. Ihese days,
howex er, a band's image
seems to be every hit as impor
tant as what they play. It there
is one thing tli.it Storm has, it is
a hard-driving, flashy image,
which could have America's
teenagers getting Storm this
winter in the same way they got
the Knack this summer.
