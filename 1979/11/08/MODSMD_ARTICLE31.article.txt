Ke< ogni/ing the ( hallonges
of opening a completely
original show, I he Gaieties '79
remains "a theatric al presenta
tion celebrating a Stanford
tradition on the o< ( asion ol the
Big Game," in the words ot
Terry Ross, director. In this
years production Ross seeks
to convey a "message of
change, of maturing tli.it stu

lar and spec ial to Stanford."
Stressing the opportunity to
c reate whu h is afforded the
(ast and stall by the show, he
said, "(iaieties, in every aspec I
of production, is brand new; at
this point, it's taken a lot of re
working but recent rehearsals

Student dramati( activity
underwent a major change in
l'H(>, when the Speech and
Drama Department took con
trol ot Ihc three major piodu<
lions away Irom the groups in

unallicd student troupes had
emerged l>\ this time, and they

took this suggestion to merge
with the Department as a c hal
lenge to reorganize. Thus,
Sword and Sandals, Masques,
Barnstormers and Ram's Head
united, giving birth to the
"Stanford Stagers" and re
maining independent of the
University, One year later, the
name Ram's Head" returned
tor good as the Stagers
opted to use it.
During the twenty years that
followed, Ram's Head grew
and flourished as a student
honorary society, promoting
interest and giving training in
all fields of dramatic activity

In the mid-sixties, University

ot the ideas and attitudes pre
