William Eddelman was a
pre-med who turned to the
theater in graduate school.
Now, as an assistant professor
of drama here, he is a self
proclaimed "missionary of the
experimental theater."
His interest lies in contem
porary production theory,
especially in work done by
Eastern European, German and
Soviet companies.
"Compared to them, we're
all so backwards. The univer
sity theaters are the only ones
putting out any originality. It's
just the American tempera
ment. We deal in the surface
orientation and in Europe, they
take the conceptual view
â€¢ point."
He also ,oys designing for
ballet and opera, "anything
seen through a contemporary
sensibility."
"The theater needs to stop
falling back on realism and
naturalism. I walked out on
Paul Scofield at the National
Theatre. The production was
all voice. The spoken word is
considered theater in America
and England, but it needs a
good environment to have any
value."
