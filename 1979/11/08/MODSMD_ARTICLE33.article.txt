Michael Ramsau r has
worked in theaters "forever." I
designed, I built things. You
never know what you'll end up
with, and that's what makes it a
great profession."
He recently closed his San
Francisco lighting business and
is spending most of his time as
a lecturer and technical direc
tor in the Drama Department.
"I sold the business because
I missed working here. The en
thusiasm from students is in
credible. On the job, you work
hard but everybody doesn't
care as much. Here, you work
hard and there's a learning
process going on."
Ramsaur delights in tackling
design problems: learning to
plaster or thatch tor Erasmus
("Nobody knows how to do

that any more. We had to train
ourselves."), to figuring out
light plots, the schematic diag
rams that list what equipment
will be used at what times.
"I read a script, and I don t
see scenery, but moments
onstage. I Irv to figure out how
to light these, then I put them
together. At tirst you have to
say, 'Ah, daylight, pink; ah,
night, that's blue.' Things fall
together. You don't know
whether it works until it all
goes up."
II it works, "You feel great.
It's wonderful to have some
thing go from an idea to a con
cept to something on paper to
something onstage."
II it doesn't work, "Well," he
smiles, "another ( hallenge, I
guess."
