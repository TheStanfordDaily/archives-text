# Behind the Erasmus scenes

"This all works with the
logistics of a campaign. The
curtain goes up and it's ready
or not." Bill Eddelman likes the
"emergency ward" atmos
phere that precedes opening
night, especially for Erasmus
Montanus, in which most of
the headaches belong to
others.
"For me (the set designer),
this is not a complex show. You
create a theatrical space with
flats and lighting. It's a neutral
space in which we'll play
natural and realistic pieces. We
are going to use realistic props,
a small house with plaster walls
and a straw roof, and natural
textures like the rocks, dirt and
wood."
Against that, Eddelman has
placed "frankly theatrical
pieces": "When there's a
storm, water will be poured
over the door. We'll have a sun
with a face on it and pieces of
the sky moving around. We
think this will heighten the
comic treatment."
Also, Eddelman is aiming for
"what the Berliner Ensemble
does . . . they set up a space
and they don't try to delude
you. It's what's called 'critical
realism': the audience must
think, while it sees. That's the
theory, but it never works
completely. Clever actors and
plays will seduce an audience
even in nothing surround
ings."
Director Fritz Brun's insis
tence upon period authenticity
has hampered things. "I keep
telling him this is not for a
museum of folk culture," Ed
delman said.
"Holberg is the Danish
Moliere. This show has lots of
satirical elements. It's sort of a

children's show. But there's
enough child in all adults tosee
these things move and change
onstage and to be intrigued."
Ramsdur
"In a show like this, the light
ing designer works off
everyone else. My job is to
make things logical, to keep
things running."
And so, says Michael Ram
saur, "If Doug (Russell) wants a
red coat for historical reasons,
I don't make it look orange.
"For Bill, I won't get in the
way of his flying apparatus and
the naturalistic, somewhat
exaggerated etfect he wants.
"It's not that we have no
thingof our own to do . . .Frit?
wants a progression trom day
to night shown in the lighting
throughout the play. It's not
that terribly important that
that's known, but he wanted to
create a definite impression.
"Lighting is dangerous
work," Ramsaur said. "Every
thing is perceived according to
light. There's no plain light.
Vou can't just provide 'light.'
Revealing something isn't
enough. You can never see
how things will turn out until
they're done."
Costume and set designers
can watch the progress of their
creations, "but I don't find out
until the t irst rehearsal
whether it's what I thought it
was."
"It's not often that the de
signing jobs are broken up like
this," Ramsaur said. "It's rare
to have three designers, so it
helps a lot if they have worked
together for a long time — as
we have."
"We know how to make the
right compromises. I look at
Bill or Doug's sketches, and I

can see what they try to do
Then, I try to do it."
Russell
"Fhe problem," says Doug
las Russell, "is seeing into hr
mind. It's both very positive
and a little annoying to wort
with someone who knows .
play so well."
Costume designer Russel
has had his hands full with
Erasmus. He and director Brun
have worked closely to re
create the look of 10th-century
Denmark, from soldier's hut
tuns to the embroidery on the
king's coat of arms.
"Fritz, being Danish, has all
kinds ot pictures and ideas
which he brought with him lor
this show. He knew exactly
what he wanted. We had to
make sure everything was just
right. Details were so impor
tant that we always kept asking
him, 'Is this what you want: 1 ' "
Russell said the ac tors have
been given animal attributes,
"an old Stanislavsky trick. W<>
wanted to be slightlv 1 ugges
tive in line and texture." Eras
mus, for instance, resembles a
cock, with wired coattails and ,t
red wig.
"In Denmark, Holberg is a
major playwright," Russell
explained. "So, hit/ knows
every way tins play's been
done. They have a great tradi
tion for putting on these
plays."
Erasmus may be too
sophomoric lor some he said.
"It's funny, but it's too un
sophisticated. Fhe basic ideas
are humorous, but the argu
ment that the world is flat gets
tiresome. (Its sue cess) de
pends on how the ac tors man
age to project. It's got a limited
mentality, but a strong tradi
tion."

"This all works with the
logistics of a campaign. The
curtain goes up and it's ready
or not." Bill Eddelman likes the
"emergency ward" atmos
phere that precedes opening
night, especially for Erasmus
Montanus, in which most of
the headaches belong to
others.
"For me (the set designer),
this is not a complex show. You
create a theatrical space with
flats and lighting. It's a neutral
space in which we'll play
natural and realistic pieces. We
are going to use realistic props,
a small house with plaster walls
and a straw roof, and natural
textures like the rocks, dirt and
wood."
Against that, Eddelman has
placed "frankly theatrical
pieces": "When there's a
storm, water will be poured
over the door. We'll have a sun
with a face on it and pieces of
the sky moving around. We
think this will heighten the
comic treatment."
Also, Eddelman is aiming for
"what the Berliner Ensemble
does . . . they set up a space
and they don't try to delude
you. It's what's called 'critical
realism': the audience must
think, while it sees. That's the
theory, but it never works
completely. Clever actors and
plays will seduce an audience
even in nothing surround
ings."
Director Fritz Brun's insis
tence upon period authenticity
has hampered things. "I keep
telling him this is not for a
museum of folk culture," Ed
delman said.
"Holberg is the Danish
Moliere. This show has lots of
satirical elements. It's sort of a

children's show. But there's
enough child in all adults tosee
these things move and change
onstage and to be intrigued."
Ramsdur
"In a show like this, the light
ing designer works off
everyone else. My job is to
make things logical, to keep
things running."
And so, says Michael Ram
saur, "If Doug (Russell) wants a
red coat for historical reasons,
I don't make it look orange.
"For Bill, I won't get in the
way of his flying apparatus and
the naturalistic, somewhat
exaggerated etfect he wants.
"It's not that we have no
thingof our own to do . . .Frit?
wants a progression trom day
to night shown in the lighting
throughout the play. It's not
that terribly important that
that's known, but he wanted to
create a definite impression.
"Lighting is dangerous
work," Ramsaur said. "Every
thing is perceived according to
light. There's no plain light.
Vou can't just provide 'light.'
Revealing something isn't
enough. You can never see
how things will turn out until
they're done."
Costume and set designers
can watch the progress of their
creations, "but I don't find out
until the t irst rehearsal
whether it's what I thought it
was."
"It's not often that the de
signing jobs are broken up like
this," Ramsaur said. "It's rare
to have three designers, so it
helps a lot if they have worked
together for a long time — as
we have."
"We know how to make the
right compromises. I look at
Bill or Doug's sketches, and I

can see what they try to do
Then, I try to do it."
Russell
"Fhe problem," says Doug
las Russell, "is seeing into hr
mind. It's both very positive
and a little annoying to wort
with someone who knows .
play so well."
Costume designer Russel
has had his hands full with
Erasmus. He and director Brun
have worked closely to re
create the look of 10th-century
Denmark, from soldier's hut
tuns to the embroidery on the
king's coat of arms.
"Fritz, being Danish, has all
kinds ot pictures and ideas
which he brought with him lor
this show. He knew exactly
what he wanted. We had to
make sure everything was just
right. Details were so impor
tant that we always kept asking
him, 'Is this what you want: 1 ' "
Russell said the ac tors have
been given animal attributes,
"an old Stanislavsky trick. W<>
wanted to be slightlv 1 ugges
tive in line and texture." Eras
mus, for instance, resembles a
cock, with wired coattails and ,t
red wig.
"In Denmark, Holberg is a
major playwright," Russell
explained. "So, hit/ knows
every way tins play's been
done. They have a great tradi
tion for putting on these
plays."
Erasmus may be too
sophomoric lor some he said.
"It's funny, but it's too un
sophisticated. Fhe basic ideas
are humorous, but the argu
ment that the world is flat gets
tiresome. (Its sue cess) de
pends on how the ac tors man
