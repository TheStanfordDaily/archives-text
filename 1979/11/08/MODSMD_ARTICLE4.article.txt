# Oil shipment future in doubt
## Iran hostages remain unharmed 
### 
Washington (AP) — American hos
tages held in the U.S. Embassy in Iran
are being "pushed around, abused,
intimidated and mishandled," but
there is no evidence that any have
been seriously injured, a U.S. official
said late yesterday.
Word of the mistreatment was
given to reporters as President jimmy

Carter's special mediators found
themselves stalled in Turkey with
Iranian authorities refusing to
negotiate with them.
The official, who asked that he not
be identified, said there was no evi
dence that any of the estimated 60
American hostages held in the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran have been

"beaten, stabbed or shot."
The U.S. government urged
Americans still in Iran to leave as at
least two more U.S. citizens were re
ported seized yesterday and placed
with the other hostages held by stu
dents demanding the United States
return the exiled shah for trial.
U.S. officials said the Iranians have
brought new weapons into the em
bassy compound, including machine
guns.
But State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter said he had no evi
dence that there had been any shoot
ing.
"We have been unable to confirm
with any of our sources that there has
been firing," the State Department
spokesman said.
The reports of a shutdown at Iran's
main Persian Culf terminal, Kharg Is
land, possibly due to local labor
troubles, were denied by Iran's oil
minister and national oil company.
But wholesale spot market prices
for home heating oil continued to
rise sharply because of worries over
the Iranian situation — although U.S.
supplies were said to be plentiful.
"It is my understanding that at this
point there is no interruption in
those shipments from the port," said
State Department spokesman Hod
ding Carter in Washington.
A U.S. oil industry source said he

had been advised a Norwegian-flag
tanker left Kharg Island for Korea
early Wednesday after receiving its
oil cargo.
"We believe U.S. companies are
being singled out," he said, "but we
also' are led to believe this is a tem
porary situation." The United States
receives about 700,000 barrels of Ira
nian oil daily, some 3.5 to 5 percent
of its daily consumption.
Stalled in Turkey
The two American negotiators sent
to seek the release of the Americans
held hostage were stalled in Turkey
A/hen Iranian leaders refused to let
them into the country.
Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attor
ney general, and William Miller, a
staff member of the Senate Intelli
gence Committee, were reported by
the State Department to be waiting in
Istanbul for further instruction.
State Department spokesman Car
tersaid the twoemissaries, carrying a
personal message from President
Carter to Iranian leaders, would re
main in Turkey indefinitely "pending
clarification" from the Tehran gov
ernment.
"It is our hope that they will be
able to proceed with their mission at
the earliest opportunity," spokes
man Carter said.
President Carter on Tuesday night
sent Clark and Miller to meet with
top religious or civilian officials, in
cluding the Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini, who makes his headquarters
in Qom ( a religious center.
Clark and Miller flew to Athens
but by the time they arrived, were
being told they would not be wel
come in Iran. They then flew to Is
tanbul where the mission stalled.
"Frankly, we're sitting and wait
ing," said a U.S. official, who asked
that he not be identified.
Permission
Although the State Department in
sisted yesterday that U.S. officials
had received permission to go to
Iran, Khomeini, Iran's religious re
volutionary leader, was insisting that
no Iranian official had been au
thorized to negotiate with them.
An Iranian government broad
cast, monitored in Kuwait, de
manded that the deposed Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, now in a
New York hospital for cancer treat
ment, be returned for trial as a war
criminal before any talks could be
held.
Thursday's New York Times re
ported that friends of the shah say he
nas offered to leave the United States
because of the crisis in Tehran, but
that doctors, family and friends have
dissuaded him.
The United States has refused to
turn the shah over to the Iranians.
Asked about the possibility that
the special envoys would succeed in
winning the freedom for the hostage
Americans, the president told repor
ters: "We hope it will. We pray it
will."
In a parallel move welcomed by
the administration, the Palestine Lib
eration Organization said it was
sending a delegation to Tehran to
"secure the lives" of the American
hostages.
"Anybody who can help will be
playing a constructive role," said
Zbigniew Brzezinski, the president's
national security adviser.
