Kennedy announces candidacy
Boston — Sen. Edward Kennedy declared
yesterday he will seek the presidency in 1980
because President )immy Carter has failed to
provide leadership to a country that is "willing,
even anxious, to be on the march again."
The last of the Kennedy brothers and heir to
a modern political dynasty made his an
nouncement in Boston's historic Faneuil Flail,
listing what he called stark failures of Carter
administration domestic policies.
Then the Massachusetts Democrat left on a
sweeping campaign trip taking him from
Maine to Oklahoma, with stops in New Flamp
shire, Illinois, Tennessee, Florida, South
Carolina and Connecticut.
Kennedy said that before the last presiden
tial election, "we were told that Americans
were honest, loving, good, decent and com
passionate. Now, the people are blamed for
every national ill and scolded as greedy, waste
ful and mired in malaise."
"Which is it?" he asked. "Did we change so
much in these three years? Or is it because our
present leadership does not understand that
we are willing, even anxious, to be on the
march again?"
The most dramatic moment of the an
nouncement came when Kennedy was asked
whether his wife, loan, who has lived in Boston
apart from the senator, would campaign tor
him.
Kennedy supporters in the crowded hall
booed the question. But Kennedy motioned
tor silence and then turned to his wife, seated
on the stage behind him, and said, "loan?"

Mrs. Kennedy, who has been fighting al
coholism, stepped forward and said, to
cheers and applause, "I look forward to cam
paigning for him."
After his announcement, Kennedy flew to
Manchester, N.FI., in oil-dependent northern
New England, and the state where the first
presidential primary will be held, next Feb
ruary.
Klan seeks site for public rally
Fresno — The Ku Klux Klan, rebuffed in ef
forts to march through six San Joaquin Valley
cities, is instead trying to find private property
where it can hold a public rally Sunday, a
spokesman said today.
The California Klan chapter had planned to
march through six Fresno County com
munities Sunday to protest arrests of
Klansmen in the south last summer.
But parade permits were denied the Klan
Tuesday by Fresno, Reedley, Sanger, Selma
and Fowler in the wake of last weekend's
deaths of five people at a North Carolina anti-
Klan rally.
Councilmen in Clovia will meet today to
adopt an emergency ordinance allowing the
police chief to deny a permit if there is a
chance of violence, City Manager Al Goodman
said.
That would leave the Klan nowhere to march
legally. The California grand dragon, leffrey
Murray of Madera, said the group would
parade only if it receives permits.
Fresno Police Chief George Hansen said he
denied a permit to parade here because police
had learned of "threats against the KKK's mar
chers and intentions to confront them where
ver they appear."
Officers also found that some people op
posed to letting the Klan march "already had
obtained weapons and plan to be there," he
said.
Rosalynn Carter visits Thais
Washington — President Jimmy Carter yes
terday sent his wife Rosalynn on a four-day
mission to Thailand's refugee camps "to ob
serve at first hand the consequences of the
horrible tragedy that is occuring there."
Mrs. Carter and a delegation of aides, in
cluding the U.S. surgeon general, left Andrews
Air Force Base, Md., with a request from the
president to assess the obstacles to delivery of
food and medical supplies to Cambodia and
its countrymen who have fled into Thailand.
The president said the warring factions in
Cambodia — forces loyal to the deposed Pol
Pot regime and the government in Phnom
Penh backed by Vietnam — were placing "un
warranted obstacles" in the way of food de
liveries.

"We have no political motives. We have one
single commitment, and that is to stop the
suffering and the starvation among these un
fortunate people," Carter said in a ceremony
on the White House South Lawn before his
wife departed for Bangkok just after dawn.
Mrs. Carter was accompanied by Surgeon
General Julius Richmond: )ean Young, wife of
former U.S. ambassador Andrew Young;
Richard Holbrooke, assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and former
Sen. Harold Hughes (D-lowa) who runs a re
ligious center here.
In addition to visiting the refugee camps,
Mrs. Carter is expected to confer with Prime
Minister Kriangsak Chamanand and members
of his cabinet and with King Phumiphol Adul
det and Queen Sirikit.
McCarthy wants court inquiry
Sacramento — Assembly Speaker Leo
McCarthy called yesterday for a legislative in
quiry into the troubled state Supreme Court,
but his office later said he hadn't meant to go
that far.
At a Capitol news conference, McCarthy
(D-San Francisco) said he would like a legisla
tive committee to "go over every aspect of
what has occurred to see what we can do to
strengthen the role of the judiciary in the state
and the confidence of the public in the
judiciary."
In response to questions, he indicated that
the inquiry should consider such issues as the
allegations that the court improperly delayed
release of its decision in the "use a gun, go to
prison" case to help Chief justice Rose Bird's
chances of voter confirmation.
But later in the day, McCarthy's press secret
ary, Howard Gingold, telephoned The As
sociated Press to say that McCarthy was actu
ally calling for a more limited inquiry.
"McCarthy has no intention of investigating
the conduct of the justices of the Supreme
Court," Gingold said, after talking with McCar
thy about early accounts of the news confer
ence.
"His only intention is to review investigative
procedures to find out if any statutory or con
stitutional changes are necessary."
Reporters who attended the news confer
ence, however, agreed that McCarthy was cal
ling for a potentially wide-ranging investiga
tion of conduct by the court.
Kennedys taxed $315,508
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy and his
wife paid 45 percent of their $702,697 income
last year to the federal government in taxes.
Their federal taxes totaled $315,508.
A copy of the Kennedys' 1978 federal tax
return was released in Washington as the

senator announced in Boston that he is seek
ing the Democratic nomination for president.
The couple's income included $608,977 from
trusts left by Kennedy's late father, Joseph
Kennedy, and from rents and royalties; $10,625
in interest, $17,598 in dividends and $9,598
from literary endeavors, speaking fees and oil
operations.
The Kennedys itemized deductions totaling
$203,304. The largest share of that total,
$88,638, was for business expenses; $63,020
went to state and local taxes; $41,740 was
claimed for interest expenses; $6,837 was
listed as charitable contributions.
Senate approves budget cut
Washington — The Senate approved a com
promise 1980 budget last night, accepting a
$700 million cut in its demand for higher de
fense spending.
By a 65-27 vote, the Senate sent the $547.6
billion compromise spending package to the
House, which is scheduled to consider it to
day.
The compromise budget calls for a $29.8 bill
ion deficit, about $2 billion more than was re
corded in fiscal 1979, the budget year that
ended Sept. 30.
The Senate had demanded a 3 percent in
crease above inflation for defense spending in
fiscal 1980. However, the increase was cut to
2.5 percent "real" growth in a House-Senate
conference committee.
Although a reduction, the defense figure
was generally seen as a victory for the Senate
since the House raised its military outlay figure
by $1.3 billion. The House also accepted the
higher Senate figure of $141.2 billion in de
tense budget authority, which obligates the
government to spending beyond the current
fiscal year.
