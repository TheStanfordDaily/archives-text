# Sign-ups for fast end tomorrow
## 
### Nancy Silbergeld 
Tomorrow is the last day students
with a Food Service meal plan may
sign up in their dining room for the
Stanford Committee on Hunger's
community-wide fast on Nov. 20.
The fast, held annually for the past
several years, has three purposes,
said Lani Rice, speaker for the com
mittee. "By fasting we can experi
ence forone day what is the everyday
reality of much of the world." The
event is also an opportunity to get
acquainted with the work of local
and international hunger organiza
tions, she added.
"Fasting is both a symbolic and
pragmatic way to financially support
these projects," she said. Last year,
$4000 was raised when more than
1600 students took part. Food Service
has agreed to pledge money for each
meal a student foregoes: a 60-cent
rebate for breakfast, $1.10 for lunch
and $1.10 for dinner.
"In the past, most of the funds col
lected from the fast have come from
Food Service members," said Rice.
Food Service Manager Maxine An
derson said "We fully support this
project and the activities of the
committee on hunger. This is the
only time during the year we give a
rebate for charity purposes. We have
found Food Service students are
supporters of it (the fast) also."
The hunger committee will have
booths set up in White Plaza at noon
on the fasting day to collect dona
tions from people who do not eat at
Food Service and from anyone in
terested in making a donation.
All money raised will be sent to
four organizations: Oxfam-America,
Ecumenical Hunger Program, Bread
For The World and Church World
Service. Students donating money,
either directly or by foregoing food
service meals, can choose which or
ganization they wish to contribute
to.
Oxfam-America promotes self

help development programs in Asia,
Africa and Latin America and the
Ecumenical Hunger Program is a loc
ally directed effort which tries both
to alleviate short-term hunger and to
help people overcome the root
causes of hunger itself.
In conjunction with the day of fast
ing, Ayida Tengemana, director of
the Ecumenical Hunger Program in
Palo Alto, will speak Monday on
hunger in the Bay Area.

The day of fasting will conclude
Tuesday evening with a break-fast
service and meal.
Bread For The World seeks to in
fluence government policies that di
rectly affect hungry people and the
Church World Service channels
funds for hunger relief.
The Inter Varsity Christian Fellow
ship and the United Campus Christ
ian Ministry have helped organize
the fast, Rice said.
