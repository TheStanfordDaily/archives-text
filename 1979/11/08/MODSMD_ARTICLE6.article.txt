# Wells Fargo Bank hikes fees for check writing
## 
### Jim Sakamoto 
The recent increase in fees for stu
dent checking accounts by Wells
Fargo Bank is a result of the rising
inflation rate and is not an attempt to
increase profits, said Joyce Treme
wan, manager and assistant vice
president of the Stanford Campus
branch.
The price hike on student check
ing accounts became effective Nov.
2. Students are now charged a
monthly fee of $1 for the first 10
checks written, plus an additional 20
cents for each additional check.
Previously, Wells Fargo had pro
vided unlimited checking service for
a flat fee of $1 a month.
Many students feel Wells Fargo is
taking advantage of their depen
dence on its conveniently located
branch at Tresidder Union.
"I think the rate hike is very unfair
since the Wells Farge branch seems
to have a monopoly" on student
banking here, commented one stu
dent.
But the rate increase applies to all
Wells Fargo branches, not just the
campus branch, Tremewan said.
"We value the students' business

very highly and are by no means at
tempting to gouge them by this in
crease," she added.
Tremewan also predicted that in
flation will force rates on similar
checking accounts in other Califor
nia banks to increase in the near fu
ture.
Compared to Wells Fargo, Bank of
America charges a flat rate of $1 a
month for student checking service

ficer at Bank of America's Stanford
Shopping Center branch.
Himes said her branch has re
ceived no notification or indication
that their fees will increase.

She also said there has been no
discussion of a possible rate hike on

near future.
