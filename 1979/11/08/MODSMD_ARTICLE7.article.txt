# Opinions of Cowell surveyed here

### Victor Goetz 
Over half the student body is at least
"generally satisfied" with the services of
Cowell Student Health Center, according
to Cowell's Survey on the Health of Stan
ford Students.
The survey, conducted last spring, re
vealed that about 87 percent of the student
body has visited Cowell, and only 13 per
cent of the respondents were specifically
dissatisfied with their treatment
Some of the reasons students gave for
this dissatisfaction included "wrong diag
nosis or treatment, varied quality of care,
condescending attitudes, slow treatment,
confused doctors, and poor procedures."
Space was also provided for suggestions
from the students surveyed.
Although the great majority of the 748
respondents diet not offer suggestions,
Cowell did receive some recommenda
tions, such as reducing bureaucracy and
increasing clerical and medical staffs. Stu
dents also asked for more publicity on
programs offered, longer hours, a phar
macy, and some general improvement.
The survey was mailed to a random
sample of 1500 graduate and under
graduate students of all classes except
freshmen, who were not believed to be
well enough established on c ampus to re
spond to some of the questions.
"You can consider this data a random
sample. We asked the registrar's office for
a certain number of names, subject to the
preconditions, and they put it in their
computer and printed out some labels for
us to stick on envelopes and mail out. We
have no record of who we mailed the sur
vey to," said Cowell Director Dr. lames
McClenahan.
"We feel th.it the survey was conducted

anonymously and voluntarily, so we think
that makes it more valid. That is, we think
people were more honest in filling out the
form," he said.
Such surveys are conducted every three
or four years, said McClenahan, but this
year's questionnaire was more extensive.
"We wanted to know more about stu
dent opinions of health education, about
student lifestyles — what they knew and
what they wanted to know more about,"
said McClenahan.
What most respondents wanted to
know, according to the results, regarded
exercise, diet, stress management and first
aid.
These comments were discussed at a
staff meeting, and suggestions were made
for improving the areas students had men
tioned, according to McClenahan.
"Half the respondents, for example,
wanted to know more about medical
emergencies and first aid. So we're going
to start a program on first aid as soon as we
can get enough people," said McClena
han.
Some of the responses surprised the
Cowell staff, according to McClenahan.
"One of the most interesting things to
me was the number of people who don't
smoke, a much higher percentage (about
88 percent) than we expected.
"We also found some pot use, about the
average, but almost no cocaine. In great
contrast to the '60s, we found that use of
psychedelics like LSD had almost disap
peared, an indication of the social trends
today," he said.
"We were happy with the number of
people who say they exercise freely. So
nappy that we moved exercise down on
our priority list," said McClenahan.

Another problem that stayed, as antici
pated, high on the priority list is al
coholism.
"Only six percent of respondents indi
cated that they drank excessively. But if
you really take six percent of 12,000 stu
dents, that makes six or seven hundred
who do, and that might be a problem to
deal with," said McClenahan.
In addition to helping Cowell focus the
direction of their efforts, according to
McClenahan, the survey also helped iden
tify how the health center should deal with
specific education needs.
McClenahan said there are many prob
lems in developing these education prog
rams. l or instance, he said, it's difficult to
teach people to drink sensibly without
alienating them by telling them not to
drink at all.
Another program at the head of the
priority list is a combined effort with food
service to inform people on wise food
choices, said McClenahan.
The survey also revealed that 40 percent
of students teel they are overweight. But a
high percentage, almost three-quarters of
respondents, felt satisfied with their
academic performance.
"There are already things going on
around campus," he pointed out. "Some
of the things we hope to do aren't new,
they're already going on, but again we
hope to focus our attention." He said that
other services on campus also distribute
information.
Fhe Academic Information Center, for
instance, provides tips on test-taking, and
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS — a program the supvey reveals is
unknown to 37 percent of students) oper
ates at both Cowell and Houston House.

cated that they drank excessively. But if
you really take six percent of 12,000 stu
dents, that makes six or seven hundred
who do, and that might be a problem to
deal with," said McClenahan.
In addition to helping Cowell focus the
direction of their efforts, according to
McClenahan, the survey also helped iden
tify how the health center should deal with
specific education needs.
McClenahan said there are many prob
lems in developing these education prog
rams. l or instance, he said, it's difficult to
teach people to drink sensibly without
alienating them by telling them not to
drink at all.
Another program at the head of the
priority list is a combined effort with food
service to inform people on wise food
choices, said McClenahan.
The survey also revealed that 40 percent
of students teel they are overweight. But a
high percentage, almost three-quarters of
respondents, felt satisfied with their
academic performance.
"There are already things going on
around campus," he pointed out. "Some
of the things we hope to do aren't new,
they're already going on, but again we
hope to focus our attention." He said that
other services on campus also distribute
information.
Fhe Academic Information Center, for
instance, provides tips on test-taking, and
Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS — a program the supvey reveals is
unknown to 37 percent of students) oper
ates at both Cowell and Houston House.
Over half the student body is at least
"generally satisfied" with the services of
Cowell Student Health Center, according
to Cowell's Survey on the Health of Stan
ford Students.
The survey, conducted last spring, re
vealed that about 87 percent of the student
body has visited Cowell, and only 13 per
cent of the respondents were specifically
dissatisfied with their treatment
Some of the reasons students gave for
this dissatisfaction included "wrong diag
nosis or treatment, varied quality of care,
condescending attitudes, slow treatment,
confused doctors, and poor procedures."
Space was also provided for suggestions
from the students surveyed.
Although the great majority of the 748
respondents diet not offer suggestions,
Cowell did receive some recommenda
tions, such as reducing bureaucracy and
increasing clerical and medical staffs. Stu
dents also asked for more publicity on
programs offered, longer hours, a phar
macy, and some general improvement.
The survey was mailed to a random
sample of 1500 graduate and under
graduate students of all classes except
freshmen, who were not believed to be
well enough established on c ampus to re
spond to some of the questions.
"You can consider this data a random
sample. We asked the registrar's office for
a certain number of names, subject to the
preconditions, and they put it in their
computer and printed out some labels for
us to stick on envelopes and mail out. We
have no record of who we mailed the sur
vey to," said Cowell Director Dr. lames
McClenahan.
"We feel th.it the survey was conducted

anonymously and voluntarily, so we think
that makes it more valid. That is, we think
people were more honest in filling out the
form," he said.
Such surveys are conducted every three
or four years, said McClenahan, but this
year's questionnaire was more extensive.
"We wanted to know more about stu
dent opinions of health education, about
student lifestyles — what they knew and
what they wanted to know more about,"
said McClenahan.
What most respondents wanted to
know, according to the results, regarded
exercise, diet, stress management and first
aid.
These comments were discussed at a
staff meeting, and suggestions were made
for improving the areas students had men
tioned, according to McClenahan.
"Half the respondents, for example,
wanted to know more about medical
emergencies and first aid. So we're going
to start a program on first aid as soon as we
can get enough people," said McClena
han.
Some of the responses surprised the
Cowell staff, according to McClenahan.
"One of the most interesting things to
me was the number of people who don't
smoke, a much higher percentage (about
88 percent) than we expected.
"We also found some pot use, about the
average, but almost no cocaine. In great
contrast to the '60s, we found that use of
psychedelics like LSD had almost disap
peared, an indication of the social trends
today," he said.
"We were happy with the number of
people who say they exercise freely. So
nappy that we moved exercise down on
our priority list," said McClenahan.

Another problem that stayed, as antici
pated, high on the priority list is al
coholism.

cated that they drank excessively. But if
