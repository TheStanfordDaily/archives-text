# The 						Kennedys
## Politics is a family tradition 
### 
Washington (AP) — John
Kennedy, after winning the
1960 Democratic presidential
nomination, gave his brother a
cigarette box with the inscrip
tion:
"Robert Kennedy. When I'm
Through, How About You."
If there is a political dynasty
in the United States, surely the
Kennedys are it.
They have been winning
elections since World War 11,
these Kennedys, first one, then
another, then another. In tact,
they almost never lose.
"Joe Jr. was supposed to be
the politician," John Kennedy
said in an oft-quoted remark.
"When he died, I took his
place. If anything happened to
me, Bobby would take my
place. If something happened
to Bobby, Teddy would take
his place."
All these things have now
come to pass.
Tragedy struck Joseph )r.,
the eldest son, a Navy pilot kil
led in action during World War
11.
The mantle (ell to the second
son, John: congressman from

Massachusetts, then senator,
winner of 10 straight presiden
tial primaries, and the
youngest man ever elected
president. He was assassinated
three years later, in 1963.
The mantle fell to the third
son, Robert: attorney general,
then senator from New York,
then presidential challenger,
winner of a string of primaries
when he, too, was assassi
nated.
And so there is the fouith,
Edward: first elected senator
from Massachusetts 17 years
ago at age 30, spurning presi
dential campaigns in 1968 and
1972and 1976, now running ihe
race his brothers ran before
him.
Beginning with John Ken
nedy's first campaign, a 1946
rate for the House of Rep
resentatives, there has been
only one bona fide election de
feat in 33 years, Robert Ken
nedy's loss of the 1968 Oregon
Democratic presidential prim
ary.
It was said that Joseph Ken
nedy, war-time ambassador to
England from 1937 to 1940,

harbored presidential ambi
tions for himself. That he hald
them for his offspring, there is
no doubt.
Other family members have
also been in politics.
Brother-in-law Stephen Smith
has held important roles in
campaigns at least a half dozen
times for all three brothers
since 1958. Today he is cam
paign manager for Edward
Kennedy.
A second brother-in-law, R.
Sargent Shriver, was the
Democratic vice presidential
nominee in 1972.
And it's not likely that Ed
ward will be the last Kennedy in
politics. With politicians aplen
tyatthe dedication of the John
Kennedy Library in Boston last
month, it was Joseph Kennedy
11, 27, who provided the chie?
political fireworks.
With his uncle and President
Jimmy Carter looking on, the
eldest son of Robert Kennedy
attacked American big busi
ness and complained that
under current federal financial
policies, the poor suffer the
most.
