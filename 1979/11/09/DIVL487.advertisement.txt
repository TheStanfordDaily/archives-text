LOOK: IT'S NATIONAL LAMPOON'S
NOVEMBER LOVE ISSUE
|| |
This issue of National Lampoon contains some pretty
spicy material. Some people unused to such spicy
humor had to drink glass after glass of water while
leading the love issue.
You can learn alot about all kinds of love from
the November issue. If you're really ignorant, you can
team one hell of a lot.*
' But don't take our word for it. Pick up a copy at
Jour bookstore or newsstand today. And if you get
sme kind of a disease, don't blame us. You picked
Op the magazine. It's your fault.
