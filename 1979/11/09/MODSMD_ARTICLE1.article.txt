## Professors denounce embassy takeover

The Iranian kidnapping ol b()
Americans "is symptomatic
of a strong anti-American feeling by
the supporters ol the Ayatollah
Khomeini, and now they have the
opportunity to express that hostil
ity," said Lee /eigler, direc tor ol the
Bee htel International Center here.
/eigler and other faculty mem
bers here expressed concern about
the implications of the crisis in the
United States' embassy in Iran.
Normally, embassies are protected
under international law lor the pur
pose ot carrying on important busi
ness, said )an Triska, professor ol
political science. "This incident viol
ates the whole culture ol interna
tional law."
"It is an extraordinary situation,
because it is the iirsf blatant violation
of the principle of diplomatic im

munity since the late sixteenth cen
tury. This is true because ot the re
fusal ot the so-called government ot
Iran to handle the situation â€” or
perhaps because there really isn't a
government ot Iran anymore," said
Robert Keohane, another prolessor
ot political science.
"This is a classic technique ot
tocusing on previous and external
enemies to avert the internal pres
sure on the Ayatollah. It reflects the
inability ot the Iranian government to
control the Kurdists and the south
ern oil producing areas ot Iran,"
commented David Abernethy, also
professor ot political science.
Iranian students here did not want
to comment on the situation in Iran.
According to Druce Lusignan, a
prolessor ot electrical engineering
who has spent time in Iran, "Many ot
these students want to be able to
home and help their tamilies and
their country. It would do them no
good to be quoted."
In addition to reflecting a loss ol
control by the Ayatollah's govern
ment, the kidnapping reflects a loss
ot American influence in foreign
countries, said Keohane.
"Sixtv-live years ago, the United
States could make or break an Ira
nian government," he said.
The incident was described as
"uncivilized" by Triska. "It does not
fit established, rational, functional
relations among Countries. It is emo
tional and is not to be tolerated."
Most ot the experts agree that the
United States' options are limited. "If
is not possible to return the shah be
cause it would set a precedent for the
safety ol diplomats elsewhere that is

too negative," said Abernethy. "The
international community ol diplo
macy would no longer t unction were
the United States to give in."
The shah is in a New York hospital
reportedly suffering trom cancer.
' The shah probably will not return
on his own, because he knows what
awaits him there," said /eigler. "And
the United States is not in the posi
tion to torce him to return."
Triska said he doubts that the Ira
nians would kill the hostages, be
cause the kidnapping "was a calcu
lated move to be used lor negotia
tion purposes. It they were going to
kill them, it would have already hap
pened."

Comparing the situation to a
hijacking, Keohane said it would be
"foolish'' to allow an embassy occu
pation to be successful.
"But what can the United States
do?" he asked. "The marines are not
a viable option, considering the M 5s
and other weapons that the United
States has given Iran. Perhaps it dip
lomacy and United Nations inter
mediaries fail, we should retaliate
against the Iranian embassy."
"We must cope with the crisis
through negotiation in a cool and de
tached way, without compromising
our position. Il we can bring justice
and tairness in, in the long run, it will
pay ott," Triska concluded.
