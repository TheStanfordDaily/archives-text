# Prof says U.S. should clarify policy toward Soviet Union
## 
### Katy Lawrence 
The United States should clarify its policy ob
jectives and behave accordingly toward the
Soviet Union, Alexander Dallin, professor ol
political science, said Tuesday to 75 persons at
tending a Bechtel International Center lunc
heon.
There is a need lor "consciousness raising in
regard to foreign policy statements in this coun
try," he said. It is in the interests of the United
States to influence the next generation of Soviet
leaders toward the belief that cooperation with
the United States can be advantageous, he said.
The need lor clearer signals arises from the
ambiguous view Soviets have ol the United
States.
"The United Stales is at the same time an
object of envy and scorn. It is tfie enemy to tight,
to expose, to pillory and it is the model to learn
from," Dallin said.
Among the political elite in the Soviet Union,
there exist two images ot the United States, Dal
lin said.
There is the hostile negative picture ol lile in
America and ol American policy whose advo
cates believe that "the imperialist beast can't
change its spots."
At the same time, there are Soviet lenders,
such as Leonid Bre/hnev, who hold a moderate,
more benign view ol the United States. These
leaders have had an impact on Soviet percep
tions.
"They no longer insist that eastern big busi
ness controls the Pentagon and the White
House, and they are willing to recognize that
there are sincere differences in the American
business community that cannot be explained

entirely by monetary interests," Dallin said.
Nevertheless, Soviets "have trouble with the
print iple ot limited government, the rule ot law
and the reparation ol powers," lie noted. I hey
have much less trouble with the executive
branch, with the bureaucracy, vvilli things that
they are lamiliar with Irom their own experi
ences."
Disenchantment
Real disent hantment has set in recently in the
Soviet Union over possibilities tor interaction
and cooperation with the United States, Dallin
said.
"The Soviets had counted on American busi
ness to promote closer ties so as to sell and
produce more lor the Soviet Union," he said.
They cannot understand in Marxist-Leninist
terms why massive credits and development
projects are not forthcoming, he said.
There is also growing concern that the United
States is moving to encircle the Soviet Union
through defining common interests with its
NATO allies, lapan and China, Dallin noted.
Confusion
"After all the optimism and over-optimism ol
the mid-70s, there is a sense ol considerable
contusion about the Carter administration," he
said. The Soviets believe all the contradictory
and contused signals are orchestrated, and
sense a coalition of interests ranging Irom
Zionism to anti-communism behind a strategy.
"There are those in the Soviet Union who out
ol ignorance, prejudice or selective information
and professional knowledge have a very nega
tive view ol the United States," he said.
I his makes a clear delinition ol Americ an pol
icy and interests imperative, Dallin said.
