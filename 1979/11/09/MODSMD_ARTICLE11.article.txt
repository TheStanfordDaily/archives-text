# Saturday frivolities
## Trailing the tailgaters at pre-game feasts 
### Douglas Kessler 
To the average person tail
gaters might connote a menace
to society; however, to Uni
versity students and alumni
tailgatingimplies serious party-

iny at each Cardinal home
football game.
The origin of tailgating is
vague. Even the most elderly
alumni cannot remember the
first tailgate. However, one ex
perienced partaker in tailgat
ing recollected that many years
ago there were few four star
restaurants in Palo Alto and so
tailgating evolved naturally.
Anothei veteian oi this.
Saturday afternoon "profes
sion" simply stated that tailgat
ingoriginated as a means of br
inging the family together tor
good food and good times be
fore the game.
Tailgating is an art requiring

strategy, culinary talents, or
namentation, and a proticiency
in spinning old football yarns.
Due to the law ot supply and
demand, there must be
strategy in planning a tailgate

party. With each game the
number of tailgaters increases
and finally culminates with the
Big Came. Not only do Stan
ford alumni and their family
come, but dorms, organiza
tions, and clubs plan tailgaters.
Unfortunately, there are
only a lew prime locations
which are perfect tor the party
such as the "bigoak tree" (near
Maples Pavilion) or the Chuck
Taylor Grove. Therefore, it is
typical to see cars, vans, and
RVs pulling into the Stanford
Stadium parking lot the night
betore a game in order to >et
up shop.
For some dedicated souls
their spot is a tradition or sac

red leasting ground which tew
dare to infringe upon.
The tood and table decora
tions are the most visible as
pect ot these portable parties.
There is no typical menu or
place-setting. However, there
are some standouts as one am
bles through the maze ol open
trunks and VVinnebagos.
I nere is a certain contrast ol
complexity and simplicity.
Lavish table settings including
checkerboard tablecloths,
wine glasses, napkins, silver
ware, (lower vases, and can
delabras are as common as
newspaper spread on t he hood
of a car, dixie cups, and paper
plates.
The piece de resistance is, ol
course the mouth-watering
tood. Grinder sandwichcs.

cole slaw, potato chips, tried
chicken, cheeses, wine, beer,
homemade brownies . . . ad
nauseum are some typical in
gredients of one ot these
leasts. Along with the exciting
outdoor atmosphere ot pre
game hopes of Cardinal victory
and post-game celebration, it
is no wonder that young and
old flock to tailgaters
And where there are people
there are bound to be stories.
Armchair quarterbacks con
gregate at these parties and
babble incessantly about the
outcome of the game, old
football greats, and upcoming
stars to replace the heroes of
yesterday.
Tailgating at Stanlord seems,
year after year, to continue as a
tradition which would make
even the Romans proud of
their progeny.
