Dear Bug Me,
Is it true that the Stanford Museum has
Leland Ir.'s last breakfast?
-Bunny's Beau
I felt really silly calling the Museum to ask
about this question, but the tirst response I
received was "That's a very common ques
tion." It's been one of those weeks!
"It's a prevalent myth," said Kate Garrett,
the Museum's registrar. "For a long time it
was believed that there was a plaster cast
made ot Leland Stanford, Ir.'s last breaktast."
Garrett said that her uncle, an alumnus ot
the Farm, claims to have seen it. "But no one
here has seen or heard ot any such thing, . . .
and certainly we have no record of it," she
added.
The Museum does have various artifacts
and memorabilia ot Leland's, including
things like pieces of an old French chalet . The
most peculiar item, in Garrett's opinion, is
the bunch ot tlowers that the young man was
holding when he died. The tlowers were
pressed by his mother lane and are accom
panied by a note written in her h.'nd.
Dear Bug Me,
Several times when I have been galavant
ing around campus at 2 or 3 in the morning,
I've noticed that all the lights in Meyer Library
are left on. I guess they're left on all night.
Whyf That seems like such a waste.
-Mr. NRG
This question has been answered on the
question board at Meyer, but for all of you
who don't want to admit that you've been
there every night for the past two weeks,
here is the reason.
From midnight to 6a.m. the library is being
cleaned by custodians. Besides that, there
are lights that are kept on all night, in stair
wells and emergency exits.
Roy Stamplli, manager of building services
for the libraries, explained that while it would
be better to clean the library during the day,
students objected to the noise ot the vac
uuming.
Dear Bug Me,
First, there is a sign on Quarry Road just to
the campus side of Arboretum which is di
vided in half. The top hall displays a No Bicy
cle sign, and the bottom half displays a Bike

Hath sign. What does this sign me?
Second, I am told that a bicycle is consi
dered a vehicle in California. What <legally)
should a bicyclist do at a stop light that
changes only for cars and motorcycles{
- Hill C.
The signs in question are in tact quite
humorous. The letter above describes the
side ot about a half-dozen signs along Quarry
Koad. On the reverse, in the direction ot traf
tic, the top halt ot the signs reads "Bicycles
may use sidewalk" and the bottom halt reads
"Bicycles prohibited this direction."
Whatever the impression given by these
signs, their intention is at last clear. Accord
ing to Detective Carl Gielitz of Police Ser
vices, about hallway up Quarry Road toward
the hospital, bicycles are routed from the
street onto the sidewalk. The signs are at
tempting to explain this to both cars and
bicyclists.
As lor the second part of the question:
most stop lights that are triggered in some
way by motor vehicles will have pedestrian
crosswalks, Gielitz said. These will have
push-button switches which the bicyclists
should use.
Gielit/ added that many magnet-triggered
lights can be activated by the metal in bicy
cles, and almost all pressure switches can
similarly be tripped by the weight of the
rider.
Dear Bug Me,
There is one large curtain (hat serves as a
door for all the stalls in the women s restroom
in Tresidder. So, how does one manage to get
into the middle stall without exposing
everyone in the others, or having to crawl
under the curtain? Does this have something
to do with the attempted suicide last spring?
IK
"It delinitely has nothing to do with the
attempted suicide," according to Jett Nelson,
facilities Manager at Tresidder. The curtains
are a temporary solution to a common prob
lem. There are new doors ordered to com
plete the extensive renovations recently per
lormed on the bathroom. But they haven't
come in yet.
There were two curtains put up in front of
lour stalls in the bathroom, the idea being
that one could enter either ot two stalls Irom
opposite sides ot each curtain, Nelson said.
Unlortunately, someuody tore one ol them
down, with the current situation resulting.
According to the contractor tor this job, the
doors should be in by next week, so hold on.

tion." It's been one of those weeks!
"It's a prevalent myth," said Kate Garrett,
the Museum's registrar. "For a long time it
was believed that there was a plaster cast
made ot Leland Stanford, Ir.'s last breaktast."
Garrett said that her uncle, an alumnus ot
the Farm, claims to have seen it. "But no one
here has seen or heard ot any such thing, . . .
and certainly we have no record of it," she
added.
The Museum does have various artifacts
and memorabilia ot Leland's, including
things like pieces of an old French chalet . The
most peculiar item, in Garrett's opinion, is
the bunch ot tlowers that the young man was
holding when he died. The tlowers were
pressed by his mother lane and are accom
panied by a note written in her h.'nd.
Dear Bug Me,
Several times when I have been galavant
ing around campus at 2 or 3 in the morning,
I've noticed that all the lights in Meyer Library
are left on. I guess they're left on all night.
Whyf That seems like such a waste.
-Mr. NRG
This question has been answered on the
question board at Meyer, but for all of you
who don't want to admit that you've been
there every night for the past two weeks,
here is the reason.
From midnight to 6a.m. the library is being
cleaned by custodians. Besides that, there
are lights that are kept on all night, in stair
wells and emergency exits.
Roy Stamplli, manager of building services
for the libraries, explained that while it would
be better to clean the library during the day,
students objected to the noise ot the vac
uuming.
Dear Bug Me,
First, there is a sign on Quarry Road just to
the campus side of Arboretum which is di
vided in half. The top hall displays a No Bicy
cle sign, and the bottom half displays a Bike

Hath sign. What does this sign me?
Second, I am told that a bicycle is consi
dered a vehicle in California. What <legally)
should a bicyclist do at a stop light that
changes only for cars and motorcycles{
- Hill C.
The signs in question are in tact quite
humorous. The letter above describes the
side ot about a half-dozen signs along Quarry
Koad. On the reverse, in the direction ot traf
tic, the top halt ot the signs reads "Bicycles
may use sidewalk" and the bottom halt reads
"Bicycles prohibited this direction."
Whatever the impression given by these
signs, their intention is at last clear. Accord
ing to Detective Carl Gielitz of Police Ser
vices, about hallway up Quarry Road toward
the hospital, bicycles are routed from the
street onto the sidewalk. The signs are at
tempting to explain this to both cars and
bicyclists.
As lor the second part of the question:
most stop lights that are triggered in some
way by motor vehicles will have pedestrian
crosswalks, Gielitz said. These will have
push-button switches which the bicyclists
should use.
Gielit/ added that many magnet-triggered
lights can be activated by the metal in bicy
cles, and almost all pressure switches can
similarly be tripped by the weight of the
rider.
Dear Bug Me,
There is one large curtain (hat serves as a
door for all the stalls in the women s restroom
in Tresidder. So, how does one manage to get
into the middle stall without exposing
everyone in the others, or having to crawl
under the curtain? Does this have something
to do with the attempted suicide last spring?
IK
"It delinitely has nothing to do with the
attempted suicide," according to Jett Nelson,
facilities Manager at Tresidder. The curtains
are a temporary solution to a common prob
lem. There are new doors ordered to com
plete the extensive renovations recently per
lormed on the bathroom. But they haven't
come in yet.
There were two curtains put up in front of
lour stalls in the bathroom, the idea being
that one could enter either ot two stalls Irom
opposite sides ot each curtain, Nelson said.
Unlortunately, someuody tore one ol them
down, with the current situation resulting.
According to the contractor tor this job, the
doors should be in by next week, so hold on.

Dear Bug Me,
Is it true that the Stanford Museum has
Leland Ir.'s last breakfast?
-Bunny's Beau
I felt really silly calling the Museum to ask
about this question, but the tirst response I
received was "That's a very common ques
tion." It's been one of those weeks!

was believed that there was a plaster cast
made ot Leland Stanford, Ir.'s last breaktast."
