## OPINIONS Doryn Davis Drinking can be a deadly game 
### 
Within the past two years,
live Stanford students have
been hospitalized with lite
threatening alcohol poisoning
atter partiiipating in drinking
games. Last spring three ot
these students were hos
pitalized with alcohol blood
content levels of 0.41-0.42 per
cent atter excessive alcohol
consumption in a short period
ol time.
In general, with an alcohol
blood content ol 0.40 percent
one is unconscious. At 0.50
percent concentration, death
becomes a real threat. (The
fatal dose tor an average adult
is b()0 to 800 nil. or 20 to 2B
ounces ot 100 prool whiskey
consumed in less than one
hour. A tilth ol hard liquor is
25.1 ounces.)
large concentrations ol al
cohol are consumed on cam
pus, especially during drinking
games.
Drinking games are charac
terized by "chugging'' or
"drinking down hard liquor
(e.g , bourbon, gin, vodka.l
The whole point in "c hugging''
is to see who c an down the bot
tle most rapidly. In "drinking
down" the point is to see il
people can keep up with each
other as they take "shots" ol
liquor.
Consequently, the amount
ol alcohol consumed in a short
amount ol time during drink
inggames may be a lethal dose.
The dangerous etlects ol al
cohol poisoning are to the
central nervous system, par
ticularly the brain stem. This
amount ol liquor, consumed
rapidly, allects respiration,
blood pressure and bod\
temperature. Ihe range bet
weerj a dose which produces
stupflr and one impairing vital
tunc honing is small.
Wljat complicates the situa
tion Is thai judgment is im
paired at the same time. As the
alcohol lakes its ellect, the
persdn has no sense lo stop.
Whether or not the dose is
latal varies according lo several
lactojs. The tolerance ol the
individual and how last the al
cohol was consumed is c ritic al.

The weight ol the individual is
also crucial, with smaller indi
viduals at risk earlier. An addi
tional tactoras to the end result
ot alcohol poisoning is
whether the individual ate
prior to the consumption. Hav
ing eaten slows absorption into
the blood stream.
Hut the bottom line is that
once the alcohol blood con
tent reaches a certain level,
coma ensues. At that point
there are the dangers ol per
manent damage or even death.
But medical intervention can
prevent these by maintaining
vital body tunctioning.
Competitive drinking
matches or drinking games
may be a sign ol "macho" to
some. Alter all, downing a tilth
in one slug or a series ol shot
glasses does take some guts.
But it's clear that in this case
"macho" may mean "dead."
What does it take to prevent

an enjoyable alternoon or
evening with triends Irom end
ing disastrously?
—Stopping the group Irom
getting involved in drinking
games at the onset is the best
practice.
—Suggesting that the com
petitive spirit be proven in
another, less dangerous, activ
ity.
—Declining to personally
participate even it it seems
harmless or il triends push lor
everyone's involvement.
—Insuring that alcohol is not
mixed with other drugs to pre
vent combined etlects which
are otten unpredictable and
severe.
It is difficult to say "no"
when the rest ol the group has
made the decision to compete
in this manner. Courage has
multiple definitions though.
Saying "no" to triends takes a
ditferent kind ot guts. Some

one needs to be the lirst to set
the limits. Often everyone is
relieved that the activity was
stopped.
It the group goes ahead and
engages in a drinking match,
get anyone who seems to be
stuporous or passing out and
who has slowed respiration to
immediate medical attention at
Cowell or the hospital
emergency room.
Also, it is deceptive to think
that someone passed out who
has drunk a large quantity in a
short time c an be left to sleep it
ott. They may be unconscious.
Usually the response to an
alcohol-related incident comes
atter-the-tact. The waste of a
lite by acute alcohol poisoning
is purposeless and unneces
sary. Preventing (his may be
enlisting the courage to say
"no."
