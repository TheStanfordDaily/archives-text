## Why must women bear burden alone? 
### 
My,my, how tired I'm getting ol reading
all these abortion debate letters!
The women write their emotronal letters
lor pro-choice; the men respond by
( hampioning the choice ol the fetus, and
then selt-righteously remind the women
that then right to "choice" lies in not hav
ing sex in the lirst place.
I lind the male argument that a woman
should simply not engage in sex il she
wants to sateguard the smooth progres
sion ol her c areer or lile to be at best naive
and at worst die tatorial.
leaving aside the sensitive issue ol
pre-marital sex and tocusing instead on
marital sex. I lind it absurd to suggest to a
married woman that she in etlect choose
between her marriage or her career.
How long do you think her marriage will
last it every night she says: "Not tonight,
honey I have mv career to consider?!"
I have little doubt that male protests
against abortion would subside consider
ably il the women ol this country restaged
Aristohanes "Lysistrata." However, I have
an alternative suggestion which might be
easier lor pro-chokers to implement thai a
national sex strike.

As stated above, a lavorite argument
against abortion on demand is that the
woman's "choice" lies in not having sex.
However, it should be noted thai in an
unwanted pregnancy, the woman is not
the only negligent actor. It takes two to
tango: the man is contributory negligent.
Why, then, should the woman be the
only one to bear the burden of a lost
career, impaired earning capacity, physi
cal debilitation, emotional suttering and
embarrassment and risked death?
Thirty-three states in the Union, includ
ing California, have provisions lor com
parative negligence determination ot
damages in civil suits. Under this system,
each negligent actor in an accident pays
damages in accordance with his percen
tage ol lault in c reating the accident. The
male s portion ol the laull for an unwanted
pregnane y would probably balance out to
50 percent.
Pro-choice agitators should lack
amendments which allow a woman to sue
the c ontributorily negligent male lor dam
ages resulting irom unwanted pregnancy
to every right-to-life piece ol legislation
introduced. That way, men too would be

attorded the chance to think twice before
(hey make the "choice" to have sex.
To those who would complain that such
an addition to the c ivil legal system would
be hard to administrate, I answer that, in
cast- alter case, courts have extended tort
liability where necessary in order to most
equitably apportion damages, specifically
discounting administrative ditliculty as a
defense to such extension.
I think it's a rather neat little plan.
It would probably foil most right-to-lile
legislation: I sincerely doubt that any bill
which restricted a man's "choice" to have
se\ would pass anywhere in this country,
principles notwithstanding.
And even it such hills did pass, at least
the responsibility tor the unpleasant con
sequences o! unwanted pregnancy would
be equitably shared.
finally, right-to-liters should welcome
this equitable sharing, lor it cleanses their
ostensible motive (the protection ot the
unborn letus) ol all traces of misogyny and
sexism which might otherwise quite
rightly be interred.
