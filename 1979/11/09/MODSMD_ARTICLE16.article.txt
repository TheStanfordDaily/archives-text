"Hey boys/' the old cracked
voice cried, "Co home, the
game is over."
Well I couldn't believe it!
Even though me and my buddy
Harold were sitting very high
up in the stands, and although
it was getting pretty dark, I
thought tor sure that we would
have heard the gun go off.
Anyways, I thanked the old
man, then told the couple be
hind me, and they thanked me
because they had to go home
and make dinner for their chil
dren.
Then as Harold and I were
running down the aisle, I got a
closer look at the old man, and
my jaw about dropped! Here
was this, 76-year-old guy (he
was so thin that Harold said the
man probably had to run
around in the shower to get
wet), all dressed up in a white
l/rod/alligator shirt, khaki
shorts and shuttling out the
stadium in a pair of $43 "top
sider" shoes with no socks.
The old man stopped us, in
troduced himself as Spencer,
and asked us it what just hap
pened, happened a lot.
I told him that even though
Harold and I usually had the
worst seats in the house, we
almost always knew when the

game was over.
He then asked, "Do you
have a minute?" Harold said he
had a test on Tuesday, so he
left, but I nodded my head and
told him that I didn't have any
midterms for awhile.
Then the old geezer looked
to both sides, and whispered
to me, "Boy, you should join
the E.F.D.O.S. society."
Atter he saw that I had no
clue about what he was talking
about, he said, "You know, the
End Fraternity Domination Ot
Seats Society.' That's the whole
problem, you know boy, them
fraternities just come early and
grab all the good seats and
force decent kids like you to sit
in peanut heaven.'
He continued, "Boy, I have
always sat in the best seats on
the student side. What hap
pened was that 57 years ago,
me and live triends formed the
E.F.D.O.S. Society, and de
veloped certain styles and
techniques to beat the Irat
boys. Although some ol these
techniques are not feasible lor
today's world, most ol them
got us the best seats
everytime."
For example, he said one
sure-fire method thev used to
use was the "T-bone
Technique,'' in which the
E.F.D.O.S. members would
throw raw T-bone steaks out in
the aisles, the irat boys would
dive for them, and then the
members would steal the
seats. But he said that he knew
this was really impractical to
day, though, because the price
ot meat was so "goll-darn"
high.
He then told me that perhaps
the best two techniques they
used were the "Red Rover
Fake-Out," and the "Catapult
style."
"For the Red Rover Fake-
Out," the old man continued,
"E.F.D.O.S. would go to the
Registrar's office and obtain a
list ot names to rail the guys in a
certain frat, then slowly (this
technique takes over an hour)
would call out each guy indi
vidually, and then beat the tar
out of him.
lor example, the E.F.D.O.S.
Society would yell, Red-Rover,
Red-Rover, send Bronco right
over.' And then when Bronco
galloped over, he'd never see
daylight again."
He said that it used to work
all the lime, but that he
realized Red-Rover wasn't "as
big" as it used to be.

"The Catapult Style,'' he
explained, "was to get over the
wall o! traternity guys who
were guarding the seats. The
E.F.D.O.S. Society would just
throw a member over the wall
and into the Irat section.
However, some of the trat
boys got wise to this and would
put their megaphones up in
the air to stop them."
He said playing this game
"one too many" times was one
ot the major reasons he had
never gotten married, then
winked and smiled at me and
said, "In tact, the only kid' I
ever had was a goat." I didn't
think it was that funny, but he
started busting at the sides.
Then I asked him what he
and the rest ot the E.F.D.O.S.
Society were doing now. The
old man said that he had been
the president ot the group for
the last live years because all
the other members had died.
I told him that I was sorry
they had passed away, but he
said I shouldn't worry about it
because he "really was having
a good time being president."
"You see," he then con
tinued, "What I do now is just
wear this white 'crocodile shirt
and these 'sailor shoes,' and sit
with some gang' called the
D.U.'s. It's like I'm part o! the
family."
He told me that everyone ot
the gang members calls him
"Alumni," but that his real
name was Spencer Farnsworth.
I then asked the old man it I
could join E.F.D.0.5., and he
said, "Okay," only it he still
could he the president. I said
that was line by me (I am al
ready involved a lot this quar
ter), so I signed this card, said
good-bye, and then watched
76-year-old Spencer
iarnsworth, probably the first
and last president ot the
E.F.D.O.S. Society, shuttle out
of the stadium in his $4 5 top
siders.
Please lellow students, don't
let Spencer's cause die. join
the E.F.D.O.S. Society today!
IKill Kemmeries is now the only
member ot the E.F.D.O.S. Soc

have heard the gun go off.
Anyways, I thanked the old
man, then told the couple be
hind me, and they thanked me
because they had to go home
and make dinner for their chil
dren.
Then as Harold and I were
running down the aisle, I got a
closer look at the old man, and
my jaw about dropped! Here
was this, 76-year-old guy (he
was so thin that Harold said the
man probably had to run
around in the shower to get
wet), all dressed up in a white
l/rod/alligator shirt, khaki
shorts and shuttling out the
stadium in a pair of $43 "top
sider" shoes with no socks.
The old man stopped us, in
troduced himself as Spencer,
and asked us it what just hap
pened, happened a lot.
I told him that even though
Harold and I usually had the
worst seats in the house, we
almost always knew when the

game was over.
He then asked, "Do you
have a minute?" Harold said he
had a test on Tuesday, so he
left, but I nodded my head and
told him that I didn't have any
midterms for awhile.
Then the old geezer looked
to both sides, and whispered
to me, "Boy, you should join
the E.F.D.O.S. society."
Atter he saw that I had no
clue about what he was talking
about, he said, "You know, the
End Fraternity Domination Ot
Seats Society.' That's the whole
problem, you know boy, them
fraternities just come early and
grab all the good seats and
force decent kids like you to sit
in peanut heaven.'
He continued, "Boy, I have
always sat in the best seats on
the student side. What hap
pened was that 57 years ago,
me and live triends formed the
E.F.D.O.S. Society, and de
veloped certain styles and
techniques to beat the Irat
boys. Although some ol these
techniques are not feasible lor
today's world, most ol them
got us the best seats
everytime."
For example, he said one
sure-fire method thev used to
use was the "T-bone
Technique,'' in which the
E.F.D.O.S. members would
throw raw T-bone steaks out in
the aisles, the irat boys would
dive for them, and then the
members would steal the
seats. But he said that he knew
this was really impractical to
day, though, because the price
ot meat was so "goll-darn"
high.
He then told me that perhaps
the best two techniques they
used were the "Red Rover
Fake-Out," and the "Catapult
style."
"For the Red Rover Fake-
Out," the old man continued,
"E.F.D.O.S. would go to the
Registrar's office and obtain a
list ot names to rail the guys in a
certain frat, then slowly (this
technique takes over an hour)
would call out each guy indi
vidually, and then beat the tar
out of him.
lor example, the E.F.D.O.S.
Society would yell, Red-Rover,
Red-Rover, send Bronco right
over.' And then when Bronco
galloped over, he'd never see
daylight again."
He said that it used to work
all the lime, but that he
realized Red-Rover wasn't "as
big" as it used to be.

"The Catapult Style,'' he
explained, "was to get over the
wall o! traternity guys who
were guarding the seats. The
E.F.D.O.S. Society would just
throw a member over the wall
and into the Irat section.
However, some of the trat
boys got wise to this and would
put their megaphones up in
the air to stop them."
He said playing this game
"one too many" times was one
ot the major reasons he had
never gotten married, then
winked and smiled at me and
said, "In tact, the only kid' I
ever had was a goat." I didn't
think it was that funny, but he
started busting at the sides.
Then I asked him what he
and the rest ot the E.F.D.O.S.
Society were doing now. The
old man said that he had been
the president ot the group for
the last live years because all
the other members had died.
I told him that I was sorry
they had passed away, but he
said I shouldn't worry about it
because he "really was having
a good time being president."
"You see," he then con
tinued, "What I do now is just
wear this white 'crocodile shirt
and these 'sailor shoes,' and sit
with some gang' called the
D.U.'s. It's like I'm part o! the
family."
He told me that everyone ot
the gang members calls him
"Alumni," but that his real
name was Spencer Farnsworth.
I then asked the old man it I
could join E.F.D.0.5., and he
said, "Okay," only it he still
could he the president. I said
that was line by me (I am al
ready involved a lot this quar
ter), so I signed this card, said
good-bye, and then watched
76-year-old Spencer
iarnsworth, probably the first
and last president ot the
E.F.D.O.S. Society, shuttle out
of the stadium in his $4 5 top
siders.
Please lellow students, don't
let Spencer's cause die. join
the E.F.D.O.S. Society today!
IKill Kemmeries is now the only
member ot the E.F.D.O.S. Soc
iety. His colnmn .jppe.trs every

"Hey boys/' the old cracked
voice cried, "Co home, the
game is over."
Well I couldn't believe it!
Even though me and my buddy
Harold were sitting very high
up in the stands, and although
it was getting pretty dark, I
thought tor sure that we would
have heard the gun go off.
