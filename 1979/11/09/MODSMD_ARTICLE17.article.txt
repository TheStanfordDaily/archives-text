EaXnomic rape
4
«
Wrtmen art' alarmed hy the
danger ot physical rape but
mos{ are unaware ot the
economic position thoy are
being forced into.
W£ are being ground down
into poverty but it's a slow pro
cess Jind more easily ignored
than physical violence which is
sudden and switt.
Thf trend is painlully obvi
ous when we face the tacts.
The U.S. Dept. ot labor re
ports;
In*l97H women earned 51
cents, tor $1 earned by men.
In *1 %8 women earned 58
centsMor $1 earned by men.
In ■•1955 women earned 6}
cents"tor St earned by men.
Among the families headed
by wemen workers in 197}, 20
percent had incomes below
the poverty level, lor minority
races.it was }i percent.
In * 1978, 52 percent ot
families headed by women
workers lived below the pov
erty level. Minority women
made a slight gain but 25 per
cent were still below the pov
erty level.
In comparison, only 5 per
cent ot tamilies headed by men
workers lived in poverty Hi
percent minority men.)
Sweatshops are alive and
well !*
Eighty percent ot adults on
welfare are women.
Women are being used to
control inflation and still we
play the martyr.
lust like the women who be
come paralyzed when physi
cally, threatened we accept
economic injustice without a
tight.'
We are conditioned to be
pleasant and accept what is
given to us.
The approval of our super
visor, means more to us than a
tair wage and we must, at all
cost,, preserve our romantic
selt-ilnage.
Asjnn individual we are help
less but united and organized
we Save clout. Too many
cannot accept their
power.
He/e, at Stanford, we can
join tjbgether in a union of the
clerical statf and the great
majority have not been willing
to accept this great opportun
ity tot creative change.

Why'
Is it too paintul to face the
truth? Are change and power
too threatening?
Why do more tortunate
women with working hus
bands ret use to support the el
torts ot women who support
themselves and families?
Why are we above joining a
union? We would be in good
company.
Former Calitornia Governor
Konald Reagan was a union
leader. Barbra Streisand and
Robert Redford, along with all
perlormers, belong to one or
more unions. Professionals
such as physicians, dentists,
arc hitects, CPA's and attorneys
belong to associations and be
nefit Irom them enormously.
Isn't the American Medical As
sociation a closed shop,' and
what a powerful lobby they
have in Washington, D.C.
We are in a Catch-22 situa
tion.
We have to respect ourse
kes to demand equal wages
and the men have to respect us
to give them to us but they
don't respect us because we
don't respect ourselves and we
don't respect ourselves be
cause our work is always un
derpaid . . .
Yes, I may go raving, scream
ing, mad.

Staff
Not subordinates
I beg to ditter with Mildred
Nilsson's article (Daily, Nov. 5)
(in two points.
First, it's not all that easy to
blow the whistle on some flake
ot a boss who's making passes
at you during otfice hours. I
may have the right to say no as
nicely and as tirmly as possible,
but the guy can also exercise
his right to be as obnoxious
and as obstructionist as he'd
want, even to the point of firing
me.
And sometimes there is not
even the recourse of appealing
to someone higher in the de
partment or warning your sis
ter office workers.
People have been known,
men and women, to shun,
ridicule and turn a winking eye
to the woman who would
complain about such a masher.
Sure, it's no new problem,

but then again neither is the
game, "Blame the hysterical
vie tim."
Witness also the recent res
ignation oi Sunnyvale's city
manager lor grabbing where
he shouldn't have or saying
what he shouldn't have.
Secondly, there is such a
thing as "marrying your pedig
ree."
Many women still, out ot the
economic paucity of being
single, adult women opt tor
marriage, even with someone
they c an t deal with in the long
run.
How many women say, "It
was time to get married, there
was nothing else to do!"
Nilsson, as I have known
her, does not have to work.
Her husband commands a re
spectable salary. Her children
are grown.
I see her statements coming
out of a pinnacle ot privilege
rather than Irom a woman who

really had to struggle to get
where she is now (with a cut in
her pay), who may have had to
raise children alone or to put
her man through college.
I wouldn't like being the
senior member ot a secretarial
stall lor 18 years, be the den
mother and unequal partner
with her boss, and not move
ahead beyond typing, tiling
and boiling water tor coffee.
With all that space and time I
would have like to have been
"retrained" to do something
better than being in a subordi
nate position, having taith in
my own talent and potential.
Something like engineering.
I am glad my job is just a
pitstop to that something bet
ter. It teaches me that there are
more and better things to ac
complish in the long run.
Until that time materializes
when I do have the position I
am seeking higher education
for, I will continue to support

the idea of equal work tor
equal pay and the unionization
ol the clerical stall.

Retirement policy
Your article on the retire
ment policy lor professors
(Daily, Oct. 2.1) was mislead
ing, and that is an understate
ment. The headline said "Uni
versity policy allows profs to
keep working past age 65."
This makes it appear as ii the
warmhearted University has
done something tor its elderly
professors, when exactly the
opposite is true.
Here are the tacts; before
recent changes in California
law, any employer (ould fix a
mandatory retirement law.
(Your article implies the oppo
site.) California then passed an
act removing mandatory re
tirement; the University ad
ministration, without consult
ing the laculty, lobbied very
hard in Sacramento to get out
from under this law.
They succeeded, and now
faculty members are subject to
the federal standards only,
which makes it possible to re
tire them at 70.
What is interesting is that te
nured faculty members are the
only employees in the state
who must retire, thanks to the
efforts ot our administration.
Your article quotes Gerald
Lieberman, vice provost and
dean of research, as saying that
the faculty is pleased with
these changes and accepts the
notion ot mandatory retire
ment. How he knows this is a
mystery to me, since the fa
culty was not consulted in any
way, and, indeed, some mem
bers of the faculty have vigor
ously protested, both to the
administration and to mem
bers of the legislature.
I hope this sets the record
straight.

Editor's note: Because of a
number of factual problems
within the original article on
the retirement policy, the Daily
will be publishing another
story on the sub/ect in the near
future.

Tresidder efforts
This letter is written in re
sponse to Mark Breier's column
"University must revamp Tre
sidder" [Daily, Nov. ()> and
numerous other articles deal
ing with the Coffee House is
sue.
It is time that the outstanding
efforts of Dan Williams, direc
tor of Tresidder Union, and
Ellie Oppenheim, assistant di
rector, be recognized.
Last spring quarter I had the
pleasure of serving on the Tre
sidder Governance Task I orce.
The purpose ol this task force
was to explore ways in which
the campus community could
have greater influence on is
sues and methods of administ
ration of Tresidder Union.
Its membership included
people trom the Tresidder
staff, the Student Ac tivities Of
fice, the Bookstore, Alumni
Association, Student Program
Board, ASSU Consumer Affairs
Task Force and other in
terested people.
In the early meetings, the
group focused on achieving a
better understanding of how
unions are governed at other
colleges and universities and
how the old TMU committee
worked before it was dis
banded in the early '70s.
A proposal for a committee
dealing with Tresidder Union
issues was developed. The
Task Force agreed that it would
be appropriate, although to
varying degrees ol interest de
pending on the item, to be
concerned with all matters in
volving programs, personnel,
finance, building use, space
and services, retail and con
tract operations and public in
formation.
Specific recommendations
for each of these items were
developed by the task force
and compiled by Oppenheim.
The task force also provided
further recommendations re
garding composition and
selection of membership on
the proposed committee.
These guidelines were sent to
lames Lyons, dean of student
affairs.
The task force was chaired by
Williams, who encouraged all
members to express their opin
ions, did extensive outside
work in collec ting information

desired by the task force,
openly informed all of us about
the"day to day" operations
and policies of the Union, and
willingly took criticism on past
procedures and policies.
As a resident fellow in Bran
ner Hall, Williams was able to
combine and conceptualize
both aspects of residential
education and a "community
union" which could provide
"campus-wide interaction."
Oppenheim kept the task
torce organized and moving, a
unique contribution in terms
of most university committees.
COP member Laura Mead,
was a member of this task force
and has constantly expressed
an interest in improving the
"community union."
While it is true that the Uni
versity administration should
evaluate Tresidder's role, it is
also the responsibility of stu
dents to get across their de
sires and needs. We need to
seek channels where our opin
ions can be listened to effec
tively.
Why not use the energy of
Mead at ASSU, Williams and
Oppenheim at Tresidder and
maybe even Lyons ot student
affairs to improve and change
the character ot Tresidder Un
ion.
Student and other commun
ity input is absolutely neces
sary and really needed to ac
complish Breier's concept ot
"campus-wide interaction"
with the focal point being Tre
sidder.
