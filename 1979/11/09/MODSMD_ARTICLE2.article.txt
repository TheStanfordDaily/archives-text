ASSU will tace a major problem try
ing to outbid large, established com
panies tor the contract to the Cottee
House, ASSU Financial Manager
Bruce Bendix told the ASSU Collee
House Task Force last night.
About 25 interested students,
ASSU senators, ex-Coltee House
employees and Council of Presidents
(CC)Pi member Laura Mead attended
the meeting in the American Studies
House lounge.
In its tirst meeting, the task force
discussed the many options it will
consider in trying to make the Cottee
House a student-run organization.

Bendix told the group that com
panies like TDS, the current operator
of the Coffee House, have the exper
tise and the stall required to present
an effective bid. But, "We're going to
have to start trom scratch,'' he said.
He cited several problems that the
committee would have to address
before submitting a proposal to the
University. The amount of capital in
vestment that students would have
to put forward tor the project and the
return on that investment must be
weighed against the current return
on money invested in the merge
pool tund, he said. He urged the
committee to consider how the Col
fee House would be managed and
how many employees would be
needed to run it effectively.
He also said that it would be "un
realistic to expect a linancial break
(from the University) because we are
students."
ASSU Senator Dick Buttertield ex
pressed optimism that the task torce
would be successful and thanked the
many who indicated a desire to work
on the development of a student-run
Coffee House.
The students who attend next
Thursday's meeting will choose the
committee's voting members trom
among themselves. The meeting will
be held at the American Studies
House at 7:30 p.m.
