Houston (APi — A group ol
Peruvian seamen letl their
homes on a (light to Holland,
hired as crewmen on a ship
heading trom Rotterdam
straight home to Peru — a
one-month trip, at most.
More than a year later, Oscar
Delgado and his shipmates
found themselves stuck in the
port of Houston — trapped by
the captain's legal troubles
alter an odvssey that included
most ol the world's major
ports.
"I was engaged to be mar
ried before I left, and I told my
fiancee I would be gone no
more than two months, just to
be sate, Delgado, 29, said
through an interpreter.
Knowing their only alterna
tive would be lo quit their jobs
and try to reach their distant
homes with little or no money,
Delgado and seven lellow c rew
members tiled suit lor their
wages in U.S. District Court
here.
Similar t ases are finding
their way into \merican ( ourts
more Irequently as loreign
sailors look to the courts as the
only place they can gel help
against tyrannical captains, un
scrupulous owners and sub
standard work conditions.
"We had signed agreements to
make this trip, but the captain
said there was no time lo make
out the contracts before we
leit, so he had us sign blank
ones," Delgado said. "Then he
tilled them in to say we ag r eed
to travel all over the world, and
we hadn't.
lor most ol the seven
months the crew was trapped
in Houston, with the ship im
pounded, thev received no
pay. When they did if was a
meager $b(J a month.
When they went lo c ourt lot
their money, they were im
mediately threatened with re
prisals by the captain, includ
ing the possibility ol being
jailed when then returned
home.
"Because they tiled suit, the
Peruvians are tinished as sea

men," said Ric hard Schechter,
the attorney who represented
the sailors.
The Peruvians dropped their
suit alter they were paid in
early October, and the ship
departed soon alter tor parts
unknown.
The seamen had been sup
ported by a group ol ministers
al the Houston International
Seamen's Center. The chur
chmen express indignation
that so little is done to treat the
recurring problem.
"It's unbelievable that on
American soil or on America's
doorstep, things go on that
barken back lo the days ol
slavery and piracy," said Rev.
Rov Strange.
"The captain has total juris
diction over what goes on

aboard the ship,' he said. "He
can say, I am master ol this
ship, and you're not leaving,
no matter how bad things are,
no matter how badly you've
been beaten, no matter how
much money you're not get
ting trom your contract. You
will obey me."
Kev. Rivers Patout, head ol
the seamen's center, said tew
laws protect the rights ol
sailors, and those lew can be
circumvented by unscrupul
ous captains and ship owners.
One law guarantees salary
payment to anv sailor who has
been discharged," Patout said.
"But the ship owners get
around that by including in
c ontrat ts that the sailor can be
discharged without pay il he is
at fault. Then he has to pay his
own expenses and passage
back home.

sailors look to the courts as the
only place they can gel help
against tyrannical captains, un
scrupulous owners and sub
standard work conditions.
"We had signed agreements to
make this trip, but the captain
said there was no time lo make
out the contracts before we
leit, so he had us sign blank
ones," Delgado said. "Then he
tilled them in to say we ag r eed
to travel all over the world, and
we hadn't.
lor most ol the seven
months the crew was trapped
in Houston, with the ship im
pounded, thev received no
pay. When they did if was a
meager $b(J a month.
When they went lo c ourt lot
their money, they were im
mediately threatened with re
prisals by the captain, includ
ing the possibility ol being
jailed when then returned
home.
"Because they tiled suit, the
Peruvians are tinished as sea

men," said Ric hard Schechter,
the attorney who represented
the sailors.
The Peruvians dropped their
suit alter they were paid in
early October, and the ship
departed soon alter tor parts
unknown.
The seamen had been sup
ported by a group ol ministers
al the Houston International
Seamen's Center. The chur
chmen express indignation
that so little is done to treat the
recurring problem.
"It's unbelievable that on
American soil or on America's
doorstep, things go on that
barken back lo the days ol
slavery and piracy," said Rev.
Rov Strange.
"The captain has total juris
diction over what goes on

aboard the ship,' he said. "He
can say, I am master ol this
ship, and you're not leaving,
no matter how bad things are,
no matter how badly you've
been beaten, no matter how
much money you're not get
ting trom your contract. You
will obey me."
Kev. Rivers Patout, head ol
the seamen's center, said tew
laws protect the rights ol
sailors, and those lew can be
circumvented by unscrupul
ous captains and ship owners.
One law guarantees salary
payment to anv sailor who has
been discharged," Patout said.
"But the ship owners get
around that by including in
c ontrat ts that the sailor can be
discharged without pay il he is
at fault. Then he has to pay his
own expenses and passage
back home.
