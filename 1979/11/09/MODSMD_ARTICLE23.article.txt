University secretaries sang
tolksongs in White ('la/a last
week in an attempt lo call at
tention to their eilorts to lorm
a collective bargaining unit.
The Ottice Stall Organizing
Committee (OSOC) spon
sored the noon rails as part ol
its Action Week.
During Ac tion Week, OSOC
collected 50 more signatures
calling lor a union election, ac
cording to kathy Mc Kennan, a
USE organizer. The group now
has 670 signatures and is hop
ing to receive a total ol 400 in
the next lew weeks. The cleri
cals' unit would be part ol Un
ited Stantord Employees iUSEi,
the University labor union.
Cleric al workers "may not be
eligible lor Nobel Prizes, but
everything in this University
would stop without us," Hor
ence Miller, a tormer c hairman
ol OSOC. said. Her comment
elicited vigorous applause
irom the mainly lemale audi
ence.
By unionizing, clericals hope

to win higher salaries, an im
proved grievance procedure
and better retirement benefits.
At the rally, which "made us
more visible than we've been
lor a while," McKennan said,
the small crowd listened to
several speakers and sang
labor union songs irom the
Depression era.
Miller listed grievances ol
University clericals and told
the group, "We have a right to
be angry. We have a right to
protest and lor Cod's sake do
it! Maybe your grandmother
worked her ass oil lor nothing,
but you don't have to."
"The only way to change
anything is to organize," said
Joyce Tipps-Coats, current
OSOC chairwoman.
OSOC holds weekly public
Meering Committee meetings
and publishes a bi-monthly
newsletter with updated in
formation on the number ol
signatures received and statis
tics concerning the status ol ot
lice workers nationally and
locallv.
