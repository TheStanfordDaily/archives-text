It you desire an elegant din
ner of fine French cuisine
think about Che/ lustine. io
icated in the Holiday Inn on 11
Camino, the restaurant best
known tor its Sunday brunch
offers tastetul French dining

during the week.
But how can a hotel have an
elegant dining area? It is possi
ble as Justine's has proven.
Walking into the dining room,
the atmosphere is set by the
large chandelier and the crea
tive use ot cloth hung across
the ceiling to create a tented
look within the room. Though
the dining area is large, the
quiet atmosphere and exquis

ite lood more than compen
sates tor the lack ol intimacy.
The menu, moderately
priced (in relation to many
French restaurants ot compar
able quality), offers a choice
selection of favorite French
dishes.
To begin the meal, Les
Suggestions du Chet ($5.95-
$4.45) include smoked salmon,
prosciutto and various seafood

appetizers. We thoroughly en
joyed the Escargots Bourgig
nonne ($4.25) enveloped in a
very tasty garlic-and-anchovy
sauce.
The Hot Spinach Salad, a
house specialty, was wonder
ful. Prepared at our table in a
bright-copper trying pan, small
pieces of bacon were heated
with mustard, vinegar, lemon,
Worcestershire sauce and a
splash of brandy to produce a
spectacular flambe. This top
ping with egg-yolk crumbs was
sprinkled over warmed
spinach leaves. A Caesar Salad
tor two ($5.50) is also offered.
If soup is more to your liking,
the Onion Soup Grantine
($2.50) is superb. It was served
with croutons and a marvelous
covering ot melted cheese.
Ihe Soup du lour, Cream of
Mushroom the night we were
there, contained bits of chop
ped onion and celery and was
marvelously herby-tasting.
This was excellent.
Sole, scampi, abalone and
salmon are among the main
course dishes offered. The
Trout Piemantaise ($9.25) in a
cognac white wine butter
and-cream sauce was brought
out to us in a copper trying
pan, and was served with sliced
potatoes and tender as
paragus.
The Duck Brigarade ($11.50)
was also h/ought out and
nicely arranged with orange
slices in a coppet pan. Our wai
ter prepared a Grand Marnier
and-orange sauce at the table
with which he topped the
duck. Also served with as
paragus and potatoes, the dish
was one of the highlights ot the
evening.
Another highly recom
mended dish is the Frog Legs
Provencale ($9.25). Served in a
herby cream sauce, this dish is
a must for those who have
never tasted this delicacy.
Also delicious is the Veal

Scallopini Provinci. The chet
sauteed the tender milk veal in a
madera, cognac and cream
sauce. Sauces are important in

I

French cooking, and this is one
of the best I've tasted.
Of course the meal isn't
complete without wine. Jus

line's wine list is extensive, ot
tering both French and
Calitornia wines. We (hose a
bottle o! 1975 Margaax ($28.00).
Highly recommended it you
are willing to go all the way in
terms of expense.
One ot Justine's attractions
is the tlair with which the wait
ers present the meal. All the
food is rolled to the table on a
large serving cart, replete with
a small burner. The salads are
made with painstaking care as
you watch. The real attraction,
though, is when the various
flambe dishes are prepared.
Spectacular tlames shoot high
into the air, to the delight ot all.
The grand tinale was indi
vidual Grand Marnier souffles.
This was indeed the highlight
of the meal. The souffles were

moist and light and were
served in a delicious Grand
Marnier-and-cream sauce.
Very rich, but the perfect end
to the meal.
Also ottered are crepes tor
two, fresh raspberries and, ot
course, the traditional choco
late mousse. The mousse is
served at the Sunday brunch as
well and is a treat at any time.
Though it is a hotel restaur
ant, Justine's offers an elegant
dining experience comparable
to any in the area. It is perhaps
the best French cuisine to be
found.
So, if you want a moderately
expensive meal in a quietly
elegant atmosphere, try Chez
Justine. Bon appetit.

the dining area is large, the
quiet atmosphere and exquis

ite lood more than compen
sates tor the lack ol intimacy.
The menu, moderately
priced (in relation to many
French restaurants ot compar
able quality), offers a choice
selection of favorite French
dishes.
To begin the meal, Les
Suggestions du Chet ($5.95-
$4.45) include smoked salmon,
prosciutto and various seafood

appetizers. We thoroughly en
joyed the Escargots Bourgig
nonne ($4.25) enveloped in a
very tasty garlic-and-anchovy
sauce.
The Hot Spinach Salad, a
house specialty, was wonder
ful. Prepared at our table in a
bright-copper trying pan, small
pieces of bacon were heated
with mustard, vinegar, lemon,
Worcestershire sauce and a
splash of brandy to produce a
spectacular flambe. This top
ping with egg-yolk crumbs was
sprinkled over warmed
spinach leaves. A Caesar Salad
tor two ($5.50) is also offered.
If soup is more to your liking,
the Onion Soup Grantine
($2.50) is superb. It was served
with croutons and a marvelous
covering ot melted cheese.
Ihe Soup du lour, Cream of
Mushroom the night we were
there, contained bits of chop
ped onion and celery and was
marvelously herby-tasting.
This was excellent.
Sole, scampi, abalone and
salmon are among the main
course dishes offered. The
Trout Piemantaise ($9.25) in a
cognac white wine butter
and-cream sauce was brought
out to us in a copper trying
pan, and was served with sliced
potatoes and tender as
paragus.
The Duck Brigarade ($11.50)
was also h/ought out and
nicely arranged with orange
slices in a coppet pan. Our wai
ter prepared a Grand Marnier
and-orange sauce at the table
with which he topped the
duck. Also served with as
paragus and potatoes, the dish
was one of the highlights ot the
evening.
Another highly recom
mended dish is the Frog Legs
Provencale ($9.25). Served in a
herby cream sauce, this dish is
a must for those who have
never tasted this delicacy.
Also delicious is the Veal

Scallopini Provinci. The chet
sauteed the tender milk veal in a
madera, cognac and cream
sauce. Sauces are important in

I

French cooking, and this is one
of the best I've tasted.
Of course the meal isn't
complete without wine. Jus

line's wine list is extensive, ot
tering both French and
Calitornia wines. We (hose a
bottle o! 1975 Margaax ($28.00).
Highly recommended it you
are willing to go all the way in
terms of expense.
One ot Justine's attractions
is the tlair with which the wait
ers present the meal. All the
food is rolled to the table on a
large serving cart, replete with
a small burner. The salads are
made with painstaking care as
you watch. The real attraction,
though, is when the various
flambe dishes are prepared.
Spectacular tlames shoot high
into the air, to the delight ot all.
The grand tinale was indi
vidual Grand Marnier souffles.
This was indeed the highlight
of the meal. The souffles were

moist and light and were
served in a delicious Grand
Marnier-and-cream sauce.
Very rich, but the perfect end
to the meal.
Also ottered are crepes tor
two, fresh raspberries and, ot
course, the traditional choco
late mousse. The mousse is
served at the Sunday brunch as
well and is a treat at any time.
Though it is a hotel restaur
ant, Justine's offers an elegant
dining experience comparable
to any in the area. It is perhaps
the best French cuisine to be
found.
So, if you want a moderately
expensive meal in a quietly
elegant atmosphere, try Chez
Justine. Bon appetit.
