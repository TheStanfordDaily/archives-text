•\d\ising Associate (AA) Program here agree the prog
ram has been a success this year, though some
suggested a tew ways to tine tune the system.
lunior and senior AAs work with (acuity advisers to
advise freshmen.
Arroyo Resident Fellow William Durham called it a
"qualitative leap in advising," but said the system should
not have to sutler for lack ol lunds to send AAs to eat in
the freshman residences.
C.rav Boyce, one of the student coordinators ol the
program, said the AAs "proved a supplement, not a
replacement" tor (acuity advisers. "We just want
treshmen to have another source ol academic intorma
tion," she added.
According to Boyce, this year, 41 AAs work with (acuity
advisers in three (reshman dorms: Branner Hall and
Arroyo and Rinconada Houses ol Wilbur Hall. About 400
treshmen are covered under the program, she said.
Began with 10
The AA Program started last year with 10 AAs assigned
to work with the faculty advisers in Trancos, another
all-treshman house in Wilbur. Boyce said the program
proved so successful that the Academic Information
Center (AIO and Ottice ot Undergraduate Studies de
cided to expand the program.
To improve the program, Durham suggested bringing
the AAs to campus betore treshman orientation so they
i an meet with their faculty adviser partners and prepare
tor the incoming freshmen.
This year. Durham said, "The AIC wouldn't fund the
meals tor the AAs to come a day earlier than the
treshmen to do advance preparations."
This year, the Advising Associate Program has a
budget ol about $4000. Dean ot Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian said the money comes trom "un
earmarked tunds" appropriated to his office.
Funding difficulties
katchadourian, whose office, along with the AIC,
coordinates tunding tor the AA Program, acknowledged
the difficulties ot paying for AAs' meals.
Many AAs and most faculty advisers live oft campus
and do not have University Food Service meal plans.
Consequently, he said, "When they (AAs) and their ad
visers come to visit the freshmen in the dorms at meal
times, money must be provided to pay for the meals."
Katchadourian said there will be 10 additional AAs
next year. Bv then, he said, "I hope a better arrangement
can be worked out with Food Service to handle the

situation (providing meals to the AAs)."
The selection process tor this year's AAs began last
winter. The response was overwhelming," Boyce said.
About 160 students applied.
1 he students who were selected to be AAs had to take
a Learning Assistance Center course taught by this year's
and last year's student coordinators.
According to Boyce, the class taught "various listening
and counseling skills as well as philosophies on educa
tion from lecturers such as Dean Katchadourian and
Dean ot Undergraduate Admissions Fred Hargadon."
Considering the work it took to become an AA, Boyce
praised the group's enthusiasm. "Unlike house as
sociates (RAs), AAs receive no credit or pay for their
work during the year. Many of them say they go through
all the training because they really want to help the
trosh. They remember how it was when they were
treshmen."
Two perspectives
Dan Lessler, the other student program coordinator,
described the AAs as "liaison between students and
their faculty advisers. " Ideally, the two work together to
give a freshman two perspectives on undergraduate
education at Stanford."
Lessler said that (acuity advisers usually answer gen
eral questions about college education and career goals.
But the AAs tend to answer more questions concerning
specific academic details on individual courses, profes
sors or undergraduate research programs such as ARLO
and SCIRE.
"Four years go by fast. The freshmen need to have a
better idea of their options at the outset," Lessler said.
7 lie AA-tacuity adviser teams have varied approaches.
lohn Landis, an AA in Branner, said he frequently
meets with his advisees without their faculty adviser.
Landis said he felt the approach made his freshmen
more comfortable about telling me their problems."
Landis also said he tries to avoid focusing on
academics. "I might ask them how things are going
academically just in case there is any problem, but I
prefer keeping the conversation on a peer level, as if I
were talking to freshmen in my own dorm."
Different opinion
Arroyo resident Wendy Porter said that having both an
AA and a faculty adviser was helpful because "it's nice to
be able to turn to another person for a different opin
ion."
Lydia Lewis, an AA in Arroyo, described her advising
differently. She «aiH hpr conversations with the
freshmen are "mostly academic. The freshmen see us as
academic advisers."
But Lewis agreed with Landis that "academics as the
topic ot conversation is not something I should deliber
ately push."
Branner resident Scott Lynch said his faculty adviser
and AA "helped explain things about c lasses and how to
gauge my course load lor the quarter."
Flexibility
Lynch also praised his AA-fac ulty adviser team's ilexi
bility saying, "They come to visit us at meals, but they
don't make a point of getting us together lo check upon
us."
Mike Browning, an AA in Branner, said that a dose
relationship between the AA-taculty adviser team and
the residence statt provided added variety to the advis
ing program. He noted, for example the picnic the Bran
ner RAs and AAs have planned for an upcoming
weekend.
Resident Fellow Durham said there should be a
"feedback mechanism" to let AAs know how they are

doing.
"Some AAs don't reali/e how much ot a commitment
they're supposed to make when they choose to he an
AA. It involves a lot more than just casual association
with the freshmen," he said.
Boyce said a SCIRt task lorce will distributing ques
tionnaires next quarter to all freshmen, AAs, faculty ad
visers and residence statf involved in the AA program.
Durham also suggested integrating the engineering
department's peer advising program with the AA prog
ram.
The engineering department has run a program for
several years in which declared majors volunteer to aid
engineering faculty members in advising prospective
treshmen engineering majors, according to Madeleine
Hunt, assistant dean ot engineering.
