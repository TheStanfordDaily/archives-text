From the outside, Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in
Menlo Park looks small and
intimate. The intimate part
is right, but it is by no means
small. The building itself
contains three elegantly
furnished dining rooms and
a cocktail lounge. Off to the
side of the main building is a
fresh-fish market, which is
open six days a week.
The interior is quite cozy.
The floors are carpeted, and
most ot the dining tables are
set off in booths by wood
partitions. There are hang
ing plants and paintings
adorning the walls, as well
as some beautiful stained
glass panels mounted on
the walls.
The atmosphere is gener
ally very sedate, being that
the restaurant caters to an
older, more affluent crowd.
The lighting is dimmed to
create a more distinguished
and intimate surrounding.
Monti's specializes in
Eastern seafoods, which are
imported to insure tresh
ness. These include Maine
lobster, cherry stone clams,

and blue point oysters. Ev
erything on the menu is av
ailable in their tish market.
Ihe menu is not limited to
Eastern seafood, however.
It is in fact quite extensive,
offering continental dinners
in addition to their wide var
iety of seafood.
Most of the lish offered
on the menu is breaded,
sauteed or poached, and

served in rich sauces (which
not only hide the true llavor
of the fish, but the bones as
well). The average dinner
plate ranges from $7.95 to
$tt.95, but you can pay as lit
tle as $6.95 or as much as
$13.95 per person. The por
tions are pretty good size
and are served with salad or
vegetables, and potatoes.
Thirty or forty years ago

the restaurant was called
the Red Cottage. Later it be
came Buttertields. The dark,
intimate interior is the same
one as when it was Butter
tield's, but when Monti ac
quired it three years ago, he
transformed one really large
dining area into what is now
the cocktail lounge and a
third dining room.
Although Monti's Sea
food Restaurant is tairly
new, Monti himself is no
stranger to the seafood bus
iness. He is a native San
Franciscan who comes trom
a family of commercial
fishermen. He's been run
ning a fresh-fish market in
San Mateo lor the past 36
years.
Monti's is open seven
days a week. Monday
through Friday they are
open lor lunch and dinner;
Saturday and Sunday they
serve only dinner. For those
interested in entertain
ment, Friday and Saturday
evenings they have what
Monti calls their "sing
along" in the cocktail
lounge.
II you are impressed by
expensive-looking sur
roundings, rich sauces and
a distinguished atmos
phere, then Monti's Sea
food Restaurant is some
thing to look into. It can be
found at 1706 El Camino
Real in Menlo I'ark.
