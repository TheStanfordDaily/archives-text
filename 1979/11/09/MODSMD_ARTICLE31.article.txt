# Few concessions to Americanisms keeps the menu highly 'authentic'

### 
KING CHUAN RESTAURANT
75 Town and Country Village
323-6350
o|H»n for lunch and dinner, Mon
day through Saturday, beer and
wine served
When my Chinese friends
recommend a Chinese re
staurant, I take their advice and
give it a try. Such was recently
the case with King Chaun, a re
staurant tucked between Edy's
Ice Cream Shop and a candle
store in the Town and Country
Village. King Chaun opened in
May and specializes in "au
thentic Szuechwan and Peking
cuisine."
And "authentic," at least by
American standards, it is. The
tables are set with chopsticks
but no forks, and items such as
Egg Foo Yung aren't even on
the menu. Although some
concessions have been made
to accommodate American
tastes (Chicken Chow Mein /s
available), the menu is defi
nitely directed toward true
Szuechwan and Peking cooking.
The atmosphere of King
Chaun is comfortable: the re
staurant is small, decorated

with Chinese lanterns, bamboo
and plants. The linen, carpet
ing and lighting add an inti
macy usually not found in
Chinese restaurants.
The service seemed friendly
and knowledgeable, although
on the busy weekend-night we
visited it, things were a bit hec
tic. We had to remind the wait
ress to bring tea and water sev
eral times, and other bever
ages were rather slow in com
ing. But these shortcomings, if
they are that at all, are excusa
ble in light ot the main event ot
the restaurant — the food.
We started our meal with
spring rolls, which were
piping-hot, crisp and not at all
greasy.
Our next course was sizzling
rice soup, a delicious alterna
tive to the usual wonton soup,
which consisted of chicken,
shrimp, water chestnuts and
rice. (Sizzling rice is toasted
rice which, just before being
served, is tossed into the soup
broth. Thereupon it makes the
sizzling noise, adding a bit ot
diversion to the meal.)
The chet then continued to

surprise us with the main
courses, skillfully alternating
between the hot-and-spicy
Szuechwan dishes and the mil
der Peking specialties.

Among the Szuechwan items
worth mention were the
eggplant in garlic sauce, and
the hot braised whole fish. The
tish, enhanced by the mildly
spicy sauce, was very tresh and
cooked just to the point where
the meat separated lightly from
the bones.

Of interest to vegetarians is
the bean curd "family style," a
Szuechwan dish made with vari
ous vegetables and tofu.
Another item on the menu
deserving attention is the
hacked chicken with hot
sauce, a spicy appetizer which
combines cold julienned chic
ken, shredded lettuce, and a
hot bean-based sauce. I have
tried this dish on several occa
sions and have found the King
Chaun version to be the best I
have ever tasted.
Among the milder dishes we
tried, the special mushroom
course (not listed on the menu)
which the chef prepared for us
was delightful, and the cherry
pork was sweet and tangy with
an interesting crunchy texture.
We also tried the beef and
broccoli, and though tasty, it
seemed a bit ordinary next to
the other dishes.
My general impression was
that the Szuechwan dishes were
prepared with more enthusiasm
than some of the Peking
specialties, and that the re
staurant's strength is in the
lormer style of cooking and
perhaps less in the latter.
However, after the main
courses, the chef treated us to
chilled lychee nuts. The cooled
truit, and then the fortune
cookies (what is ending a
Chinese dinner without for
tune cookies?) brought our
meal to a perfect close.
In view of all factors (includ
ing the price: we left the re
staurant paying exactly $6.10
per person with tax and tips),
the King Chaun was very good,
providing us with an adventur
ous dining experience.
The food at the King Chaun
was delicious, and if you are
tond of spicy Szuechwan cook
ing, this restaurant is a must.

Village. King Chaun opened in
May and specializes in "au
thentic Szuechwan and Peking
cuisine."
And "authentic," at least by
American standards, it is. The
tables are set with chopsticks
but no forks, and items such as
Egg Foo Yung aren't even on
the menu. Although some
concessions have been made
to accommodate American
tastes (Chicken Chow Mein /s
available), the menu is defi
nitely directed toward true
Szuechwan and Peking cooking.
The atmosphere of King
Chaun is comfortable: the re
staurant is small, decorated

with Chinese lanterns, bamboo
and plants. The linen, carpet
ing and lighting add an inti
macy usually not found in
Chinese restaurants.
The service seemed friendly
and knowledgeable, although
on the busy weekend-night we
visited it, things were a bit hec
tic. We had to remind the wait
ress to bring tea and water sev
eral times, and other bever
ages were rather slow in com
ing. But these shortcomings, if
they are that at all, are excusa
ble in light ot the main event ot
the restaurant — the food.
We started our meal with
spring rolls, which were
piping-hot, crisp and not at all
greasy.
Our next course was sizzling
rice soup, a delicious alterna
tive to the usual wonton soup,
which consisted of chicken,
shrimp, water chestnuts and
rice. (Sizzling rice is toasted
rice which, just before being
served, is tossed into the soup
broth. Thereupon it makes the
sizzling noise, adding a bit ot
diversion to the meal.)
The chet then continued to

surprise us with the main
courses, skillfully alternating
between the hot-and-spicy
Szuechwan dishes and the mil
der Peking specialties.

Among the Szuechwan items
worth mention were the
eggplant in garlic sauce, and
the hot braised whole fish. The
tish, enhanced by the mildly
spicy sauce, was very tresh and
cooked just to the point where
the meat separated lightly from
the bones.

Of interest to vegetarians is
the bean curd "family style," a
Szuechwan dish made with vari
ous vegetables and tofu.
Another item on the menu
deserving attention is the
hacked chicken with hot
sauce, a spicy appetizer which
combines cold julienned chic
ken, shredded lettuce, and a
hot bean-based sauce. I have
tried this dish on several occa
sions and have found the King
Chaun version to be the best I
have ever tasted.
Among the milder dishes we
tried, the special mushroom
course (not listed on the menu)
which the chef prepared for us
was delightful, and the cherry
pork was sweet and tangy with
an interesting crunchy texture.
We also tried the beef and
broccoli, and though tasty, it
seemed a bit ordinary next to
the other dishes.
My general impression was
that the Szuechwan dishes were
prepared with more enthusiasm
than some of the Peking
specialties, and that the re
staurant's strength is in the
lormer style of cooking and
perhaps less in the latter.
However, after the main
courses, the chef treated us to
chilled lychee nuts. The cooled
truit, and then the fortune
cookies (what is ending a
Chinese dinner without for
tune cookies?) brought our
meal to a perfect close.
In view of all factors (includ
ing the price: we left the re
staurant paying exactly $6.10
per person with tax and tips),
the King Chaun was very good,
providing us with an adventur
ous dining experience.
The food at the King Chaun
was delicious, and if you are
tond of spicy Szuechwan cook
ing, this restaurant is a must.

KING CHUAN RESTAURANT
75 Town and Country Village
323-6350
o|H»n for lunch and dinner, Mon
day through Saturday, beer and
wine served
When my Chinese friends
recommend a Chinese re
staurant, I take their advice and
give it a try. Such was recently
the case with King Chaun, a re
staurant tucked between Edy's
Ice Cream Shop and a candle
store in the Town and Country
Village. King Chaun opened in
May and specializes in "au
thentic Szuechwan and Peking
cuisine."
And "authentic," at least by
American standards, it is. The
tables are set with chopsticks
but no forks, and items such as
Egg Foo Yung aren't even on
the menu. Although some
concessions have been made
to accommodate American
tastes (Chicken Chow Mein /s
