Peking and Szuechwan?
What ever happened to
Mandarin and Cantonese?
What ever happened to
simple "How about some
Chinese food tonight?"
A more than helpful
O'Mei waitress answered
some of the questions. She
explained that Mandarin
cuisine represented much
of the cooking found in
central and northern China,
while Cantonese reflected
the sweeter foods tradition
ally prepared in the south
ern sections. Among the
Mandarin foods are found
the Peking and Szuechwan
preparations, both of which
O'Mei Restaurant (ten mi
nutes north on El Camino)
serves Tuesday through
Sunday for lunch and din
ner.
Now comfortable with
the menu cover, we de
cided to explore the course
listings. In addition to the
combination dinner
choices, we found a huge
la carte listing. Included
here were upwards of 15 to
25 choices under each of
several categories such as
chicken and duck, beef,
pork, soups, vegetables,

rice and noodles, and sea
food. Alongside many of the
listings we found a Chinese
notation which our waitress
told us signified a spicier
Szuechwan preparation.
Our Peking dish, the
cashew chicken which we
recognized from other
Chinese restaurant menus,
was excellent — well
balanced between chicken
and cashews, and garnished
wiih water chestnuts.
But the Szuechwan prep
aration — twice-cooked

pork — made the meal de
liciously unique. The sharp
spice of the dish com
plemented the taste of the
pork strips and green pep
per without being overbear
ing, yet it left no doubt as to
the distinctly different
tastes of China's Szuechwan
peoples.
We also sampled soups
and vegetables, which were
both of more traditional
American-Chinese style,
and found them quite good.
We especially enjoyed the
sizzling rice soup, which af
forded us the added plea

sure of watching fhe just
fried rice heat the chicken
and-shrimp broth with a siz
zle, as our waiter placed it in
the soup at tableside.
The dining environment
at O'Mei Restaurant in
cluded a simple combina
tion of traditional Chinese
decor with the more Ameri
can decor of folded red
table-napkins set on white
tablecloths. The light amply
filled the room, V*Sch had
several round tables in its
center and which was rim-

med with booths.
The a la carte selections
ranged in price from $2.50
to $3.00 for rice and noodle
dishes, $3.50 to $4.50 for
beef, chicken, pork, and
vegetable dishes, and $6.50
to $9.00 for fish and shellfish
dishes. We found that one a
la carte serving, an order of
rice, and soup would satisfy
most.
Peking or Szuechwan,
O'Mei's offers good
Chinese food reasonably
priced and close to the
Farm.
