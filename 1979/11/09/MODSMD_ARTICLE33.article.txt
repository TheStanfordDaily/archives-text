# Cards can feast from a bowl later if they don't spill Duck soup tomorrow
## SPORTS 
### Chris Haft 
Oregon's football team, which visits
Stanford Stadium tomorrow tor a 1 p.m.
kickotf, is carrying a disease that Stanford
does not want to catch.
The disease is inactivity — Oregon has
not played since Oct. 27.
Vet tor the Ducks, this inactivity is re
generate. The two-week break helps
then wounded players heal and gives the
healthy ones more time to prepare lor the
Cardinals.
Should the Ducks win tomorrow, they
would transfer this inactivity virus to the
Cards. It would not take ettect until late
December, when bowl games are played.
An Oregon win, however, would make the
boul representatives realize immediately
that Stanford must be put on post-season
quarantine.
The Cards, 5-J-1 overall and 3-1 -1 in
Pacilic-10 Conterence play, have to deteat
Oregon tomorrow and California next
week just to be considered eligible tor a
howl.
Stanford head coach Rod Dowhower
tully considers the Ducks' hiatus to be an
advantage lor them. Missing a game, hi'
said, won't ruin Oregon's timing in the
least.
It won't hurt them at all," Dowhower
said ol Oregon, 2-2 in the Pat -10 and 4-4
overall. "II just gives them extra time to
practice against our system and to heal
their injuries."
One Duck who appears relatively tree
Irom injury unless he has blisters irom
excessive running — is quarterback Re
ggie Ogburn.
Ogburn dashed lor 14 112 yards in Ore
gon's last game, a 57-2h conquest ol
Washington State. I he S-10, 19H-pound
junior has already become the top running
quarterback in Oregon history by gaining
48b yards this season.
However, Arizona State quarterback
Mark Malone came to Palo Alto last
weekend as a highly-touted ground gainer

— and the Card delense held him to 44
harmless yards.
Frankly, alter Ogburn's running, the
most interesting subjects to discuss con
cerning Oregon are its nice wilderness
areas.
Vet the Ducks actually have a pair ot
decent runners to complement Ogburn:
tailback Dwight Robertson ii 34 yards) and
tullback jell Wood (229 yards). Robertson
has been particularly effective, scoring
eight touchdowns this season.
None of this, however, lazes Stanford,
the team that sparkles against champions
and sputters against losers. The Cards,
who have lost just one ot their last six
games, have achieved the level ot play ex
pected of them when pre-season pollsters
ranked them highly.
And linally, justice is being done toward
quarterback Turk Schonert, the major lac
tor in Stanford's resurgence.
Schonert's season would make good
material lor a heroic epic. Though Stan
lord received high [ire-season rankings,
many doubters wondered il Schonert
could pertorm adequately.
When the Cards lost to Tulane and Army
and played only slightly above average in
defeating San Jose State, the skepticism
surrounding Schonert was reinforced. In
addition, |ohn Elway's early-season bril
liance was supposed to make Dowhower
think twice about starting Schonert every
week.
Schonert played creditably in the Bos
ton College and UCLA victories, but so did
Elway. Then Schonert accounted for all
three Card touchdowns against USC, and
the howls began to soften. 7he only shouts
heard in following weekswere those proc
laiming Schonert's consecutive 17-tor-20
passing performances as outstanding.
I ast week against Arizona State,
Schonert threw lor his highest single
game total 271 yards and completed a
memorable 4fa-yard pass to Ken Margerum
while barely escaping a salety.

Enumerating Schonert's recent
achievements approaches tedium. He has
completed 47 ot his last 58 attempts (81
percent) tor 703 yards and eight
touchdowns. He has thrown 89 passes
without being intercepted and his overall
completion percentage ot .677 (122-tor
-180) exceeds the Pac-10 and Stanlord re
cord figures ot Paul Larson ( .641) and Steve
Dils (.632), respectively.
"I don't think anybody expects Turk to
do what he's done — except himself,"
Dowhower said. "He's got a great deal ot
confidence."
Dowhower, who was torced to tell re
porters hundreds ot times that all
Schonert lacked was playing time, almost
unconsciously repeated his worn-out
litany.
"He just needs — he just needed — the
experience," Dowhower continued. "The
thing that impresses us all the most is his
poise."
As Dowhower implied, Schonert's at
titude is based on protound selt
contidence. When asked alter the Arizona
State game it he though any detense could
stop him, Schonert flatly replied, "No."
Such certainty is lacking when it comes
to the status ot two ot Stanford's top
linebackers, Vince Williams and Craig
/ellmer.
Williams, fourth on the team in tackles
with 62, has been recovering Irom a
sprained ankle and might be available to
morrow. Zellmer, Stanford's second
leading tackier with 84 stops, suttered a
concussion against Arizona State and is
still questionable, according to
Dowhower.
Regardless of who is in the lineup, the
Cards have to learn to hold their regular
season liquor before they can join the
bowl-game party. A victory tomorrow
would give them a lew good belts heading
into the Big Came — and beyond.

cerning Oregon are its nice wilderness
areas.
Vet the Ducks actually have a pair ot
decent runners to complement Ogburn:
tailback Dwight Robertson ii 34 yards) and
tullback jell Wood (229 yards). Robertson
has been particularly effective, scoring
eight touchdowns this season.
None of this, however, lazes Stanford,
the team that sparkles against champions
and sputters against losers. The Cards,
who have lost just one ot their last six
games, have achieved the level ot play ex
pected of them when pre-season pollsters
ranked them highly.
And linally, justice is being done toward
quarterback Turk Schonert, the major lac
tor in Stanford's resurgence.
Schonert's season would make good
material lor a heroic epic. Though Stan
lord received high [ire-season rankings,
many doubters wondered il Schonert
could pertorm adequately.
When the Cards lost to Tulane and Army
and played only slightly above average in
defeating San Jose State, the skepticism
surrounding Schonert was reinforced. In
addition, |ohn Elway's early-season bril
liance was supposed to make Dowhower
think twice about starting Schonert every
week.
Schonert played creditably in the Bos
ton College and UCLA victories, but so did
Elway. Then Schonert accounted for all
three Card touchdowns against USC, and
the howls began to soften. 7he only shouts
heard in following weekswere those proc
laiming Schonert's consecutive 17-tor-20
passing performances as outstanding.
I ast week against Arizona State,
Schonert threw lor his highest single
game total 271 yards and completed a
memorable 4fa-yard pass to Ken Margerum
while barely escaping a salety.

Enumerating Schonert's recent
achievements approaches tedium. He has
completed 47 ot his last 58 attempts (81
percent) tor 703 yards and eight
touchdowns. He has thrown 89 passes
without being intercepted and his overall
completion percentage ot .677 (122-tor
-180) exceeds the Pac-10 and Stanlord re
cord figures ot Paul Larson ( .641) and Steve
Dils (.632), respectively.
"I don't think anybody expects Turk to
do what he's done — except himself,"
Dowhower said. "He's got a great deal ot
confidence."
Dowhower, who was torced to tell re
porters hundreds ot times that all
Schonert lacked was playing time, almost
unconsciously repeated his worn-out
litany.
"He just needs — he just needed — the
experience," Dowhower continued. "The
thing that impresses us all the most is his
poise."
As Dowhower implied, Schonert's at
titude is based on protound selt
contidence. When asked alter the Arizona
State game it he though any detense could
stop him, Schonert flatly replied, "No."
Such certainty is lacking when it comes
to the status ot two ot Stanford's top
linebackers, Vince Williams and Craig
/ellmer.
Williams, fourth on the team in tackles
with 62, has been recovering Irom a
sprained ankle and might be available to
morrow. Zellmer, Stanford's second
leading tackier with 84 stops, suttered a
concussion against Arizona State and is
still questionable, according to
Dowhower.
Regardless of who is in the lineup, the
Cards have to learn to hold their regular
season liquor before they can join the
bowl-game party. A victory tomorrow
would give them a lew good belts heading
into the Big Came — and beyond.

Oregon's football team, which visits
Stanford Stadium tomorrow tor a 1 p.m.

does not want to catch.
The disease is inactivity — Oregon has
not played since Oct. 27.
Vet tor the Ducks, this inactivity is re

then wounded players heal and gives the
healthy ones more time to prepare lor the
Cardinals.
Should the Ducks win tomorrow, they
would transfer this inactivity virus to the
Cards. It would not take ettect until late
December, when bowl games are played.
An Oregon win, however, would make the
boul representatives realize immediately
that Stanford must be put on post-season
quarantine.

Pacilic-10 Conterence play, have to deteat
Oregon tomorrow and California next

least.
It won't hurt them at all," Dowhower
said ol Oregon, 2-2 in the Pat -10 and 4-4
overall. "II just gives them extra time to
practice against our system and to heal
their injuries."
One Duck who appears relatively tree
Irom injury unless he has blisters irom
excessive running — is quarterback Re
ggie Ogburn.
Ogburn dashed lor 14 112 yards in Ore
gon's last game, a 57-2h conquest ol

junior has already become the top running
quarterback in Oregon history by gaining
