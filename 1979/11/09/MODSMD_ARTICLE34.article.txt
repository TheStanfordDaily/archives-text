proved the athletu facilities
and organization at the I arm,
and has won himselt an eternal
place in the hearts ol Stanlord
students b) lilting the inlam
ous bottle ban. Ividently
Ceiger plans many more
changes. ,is lie told l)ail\ I riday
interviewei Sally lenkins.
lenkins: How does one become
an athletic director? Was it
something you aimed tor?
Geiger: I don't think there's any
standard procedure tor be
coming one. Many times
people start out coaching,
which I did, and then move
into administration. I moved

into administration when I was
25, after three years of coach
ing.
Jenkins: Why did you preter
administration rather than
coaching?
Geiger: I don't remember all
those reasons now, it was just
what I wanted to do. I have cer
tain ideas about intercollegiate
athletics, and the conduct ot
intercollegiate athletics, and I
think that one's influence can
be more broad-based in ad
ministration.
Jenkins; How would you
characterize your job? Would
you say it's more public rela
tions, more business?
Geincr: It's a management pos
ition. We run a small business
operation, it's like a small cor
poration, it you will. The direc
tor of athletic s is the top officer
in that particular corporation,

and so deals with a variety ot
subjec ts.

Jenkins: What was your main
motivation in lifting the liquor
ban?
Geiger: That's been somewhat
misunderstood by some. It cer

tainly was not to encourage
drinking at tootball games.
That wasn't the purpose of it.
The purpose of it was to elimi
nate a fairly unpleasant scene
at the gates, whereby there
were search procedures; there
was a holdup at the gate, not
dissimilar to the kind of thing
you go through getting on an
airplane. I feel very strongly
that that's not the way to
handle a problem.
I'm one that teelsthat regula
tion for the sake ot regulation
is unhealthy. We can handle a
drinking problem in other
ways than by having a line
around the stadium. There's
courtesy, and all kinds ot
things involved in this thing,
and I don't think regulations
solve the problem. And it
didn't, because people were
nnding all kinds of ingenious

ways to get it in the stadium,
lenkins: How about the en
closed practice held tor foot
hall? What were the reasons
behind thati
Geiger: There are a variety ol
reasons for that. The coaches
here have always wanted to
have a secure practice area and


Andy Geiger
they wanted to minimize dis
tractions. Secondly, it is just
plain security. There are prep
arations that go on tor a par
ticular game that a coach
would like to do with some
teeling that it's not going to be
diagrammed and sent ott to the
opponents.
Another point is the parking
ot cars on the held tor a toot
ball game. People leave things
like glass behind, people
dump over their charcoal bur
ners, and it's difficult to clean
up every piece of it, and we've
had cuts and things occur.
There are lots of negative
things about having a fenced
in field, too. There's a sense of
separation and exclusivity, and
we've got to work on overcom
ing that in administering our
use of that field in the future,
lenkins: Wh.it would be your
reaction shour.i the Trees win a
clear majority vote?
Geiger: It wouldn't be strong
either way. My emphasis is al

ways going to be on having the
best possible programs, and I
don't think what we are known
as, unless it were really rather
silly, would make a difference.
(enkins: Do you leel that col
lege athletics is a business?
How does that apply at Stan
lord?
Geiger: I think that there is an
aspect ot business, a business
side in a lot ot things not nor
mally considered as business. I
think that education could be
looked upon as a business.
There is a pretty aggressive busi
ness aspect to Stanford and the
Stanford community.
I think athletics is the same
thing. The challenge to us is to
run the business with the right
kinds of values, remembering
that we are part ot an academic
community. In order to justify
our existence in this commun
ity we have to conduct ourse
lves from a sound business
position, and a sound human
values position.

into administration when I was
25, after three years of coach
ing.
Jenkins: Why did you preter
administration rather than
coaching?
Geiger: I don't remember all
those reasons now, it was just
what I wanted to do. I have cer
tain ideas about intercollegiate
athletics, and the conduct ot
intercollegiate athletics, and I
think that one's influence can
be more broad-based in ad
ministration.
Jenkins; How would you
characterize your job? Would
you say it's more public rela
tions, more business?
Geincr: It's a management pos
ition. We run a small business
operation, it's like a small cor
poration, it you will. The direc
tor of athletic s is the top officer
in that particular corporation,

and so deals with a variety ot
subjec ts.

Jenkins: What was your main
motivation in lifting the liquor
ban?
Geiger: That's been somewhat
misunderstood by some. It cer

tainly was not to encourage
drinking at tootball games.
That wasn't the purpose of it.
The purpose of it was to elimi
nate a fairly unpleasant scene
at the gates, whereby there
were search procedures; there
was a holdup at the gate, not
dissimilar to the kind of thing
you go through getting on an
airplane. I feel very strongly
that that's not the way to
handle a problem.
I'm one that teelsthat regula
tion for the sake ot regulation
is unhealthy. We can handle a
drinking problem in other
ways than by having a line
around the stadium. There's
courtesy, and all kinds ot
things involved in this thing,
and I don't think regulations
solve the problem. And it
didn't, because people were
nnding all kinds of ingenious

ways to get it in the stadium,
lenkins: How about the en
closed practice held tor foot
hall? What were the reasons
behind thati
Geiger: There are a variety ol
reasons for that. The coaches
here have always wanted to
have a secure practice area and


Andy Geiger
they wanted to minimize dis
tractions. Secondly, it is just
plain security. There are prep
arations that go on tor a par
ticular game that a coach
would like to do with some
teeling that it's not going to be
diagrammed and sent ott to the
opponents.
Another point is the parking
ot cars on the held tor a toot
ball game. People leave things
like glass behind, people
dump over their charcoal bur
ners, and it's difficult to clean
up every piece of it, and we've
had cuts and things occur.
There are lots of negative
things about having a fenced
in field, too. There's a sense of
separation and exclusivity, and
we've got to work on overcom
ing that in administering our
use of that field in the future,
lenkins: Wh.it would be your
reaction shour.i the Trees win a
clear majority vote?
Geiger: It wouldn't be strong
either way. My emphasis is al

ways going to be on having the
best possible programs, and I
don't think what we are known
as, unless it were really rather
silly, would make a difference.
(enkins: Do you leel that col
lege athletics is a business?
How does that apply at Stan
lord?
Geiger: I think that there is an
aspect ot business, a business
side in a lot ot things not nor
mally considered as business. I
think that education could be
looked upon as a business.
There is a pretty aggressive busi
ness aspect to Stanford and the
Stanford community.
I think athletics is the same
thing. The challenge to us is to
run the business with the right
kinds of values, remembering
that we are part ot an academic
community. In order to justify
our existence in this commun
ity we have to conduct ourse
lves from a sound business
position, and a sound human
values position.
