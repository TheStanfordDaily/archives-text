interviewei Sally lenkins.
lenkins: How does one become
an athletic director? Was it
something you aimed tor?
Geiger: I don't think there's any
standard procedure tor be
coming one. Many times
people start out coaching,
which I did, and then move
into administration. I moved

into administration when I was
25, after three years of coach
ing.
Jenkins: Why did you preter
administration rather than
coaching?
Geiger: I don't remember all
those reasons now, it was just
what I wanted to do. I have cer
tain ideas about intercollegiate
athletics, and the conduct ot
intercollegiate athletics, and I
think that one's influence can
be more broad-based in ad
ministration.
Jenkins; How would you
characterize your job? Would
you say it's more public rela
tions, more business?
Geincr: It's a management pos
ition. We run a small business
operation, it's like a small cor
poration, it you will. The direc
tor of athletic s is the top officer
in that particular corporation,

and so deals with a variety ot
subjec ts.

Jenkins: What was your main
motivation in lifting the liquor
ban?
Geiger: That's been somewhat
misunderstood by some. It cer

tainly was not to encourage
drinking at tootball games.
That wasn't the purpose of it.
The purpose of it was to elimi
nate a fairly unpleasant scene
at the gates, whereby there
were search procedures; there
was a holdup at the gate, not
dissimilar to the kind of thing
you go through getting on an
airplane. I feel very strongly
that that's not the way to
handle a problem.
I'm one that teelsthat regula
tion for the sake ot regulation
is unhealthy. We can handle a
drinking problem in other
ways than by having a line
around the stadium. There's
courtesy, and all kinds ot
things involved in this thing,
and I don't think regulations
solve the problem. And it
didn't, because people were
nnding all kinds of ingenious

ways to get it in the stadium,
lenkins: How about the en
closed practice held tor foot
hall? What were the reasons
behind thati
Geiger: There are a variety ol
reasons for that. The coaches
here have always wanted to
have a secure practice area and
