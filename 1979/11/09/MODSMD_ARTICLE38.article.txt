# Rose smells out Pac-10 grid winners
## 
### 
The duties ot a major col
lege sports intormation di
rector are both exciting end
varied. The SID must relay
intormation to the local
media concerning the
teams and personalities ot
his university, doing his ut
most to get publicity tor the
charges of the athletic prog
ram lor which he works.
C.etting that publicity may
be done through hustle, ex
tensive planehopping, leg
work and quite often, elbow
work, tor it is widely known
that it you buy a sportswriter
two drinks, he will write
anything you want.
From his scenic ollices
overlooking the beautiful
Hand Shak, Bob Rose directs
the vast sports intormation
network at Stantord Univer
sity. Rose, known to triends
as Bob, has consented to do
what he does best and give

us some sports intormation
as the Daily's Cuest Greek
ot the Week.
The Prince of Purple
Prose peered into his crystal
ball (see picture) and gave
us the answers to this
week's live Pac-10 ques
tions, including the biggie
at Seattle between USC and
Washington.
Arizona at San Diego State
— The Wildcats are a win
hungry team alter the USC
rout and San Diego State

will not be able to stop the
tormidable running game
that Tony Mason has as
sembled. Besides that the
Wildcats have the best
coeds in the Pac-10.
Arizona State at UCLA —
Because of a poor punting
game Arizona State will lose
to UCLA. UCLA head coach
Terry Donahue is in desper
ate need of a win.
California at Washington
State — In Pullman, I hate to
do this but I gotta go with

the Golden Bears. They'll be
looking past to the Big
Came, but they'll probably
win. The Cougars peaked
last week against Oregon
State and Cal has been play
ing very well.
USC at Washington — A
big showdown in Seattle,
where the second-best
quarterback in the conter
ence will lead the Trojans to
win convincingly.
Oregon at Stanford — The
biggie: the Ducks and the

Cards. For the first time
since the Arizona State
game Stantord's defense
will have a consistently
good performance tor both
halves and will beat the
Ducks, with Turk Schonert
adding even more points to
his All-America bid. It will
be a brilliant aerial display.
