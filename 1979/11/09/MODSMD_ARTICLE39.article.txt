# Monstrous Gauchos invade deGuerre
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
When Stanford and UC-
Santa Barbara square ott in
water polo tomorrow at 10 a.m.
in deGuerre pool, the scene
will be something akin to Dr.
Frankenstein confronting the
monster he helped to create.
The doctor, a.k.a. Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti, will
direct the Cards against the
No. 1-ranked Gauchos, an ex
perienced team with six start
ing seniors, most of whom De
ttamanti himself recruited
when he coached at Santa Bar
bara before coming to Stan
ford.
The Gauchos, who are com
fortably atop the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association standings,
justified their No. 1 ranking last
weekend by beating USC and
UCLA — both of whom have
beaten Stanford once this year.
Though Dettamanti con
ceded that Santa Barbara may

deserve their No. 1 ranking, he
added, "they're beatable. I
honestly think Stanford and
California are better, but not
much."
The Cards and the Gauchos
met once before this year — at
the Irvine Tournament in Sep
tember — and played to a 4-4
tie.
According to Dettamanti,
Santa Barbara is strong in all
phases oi the game, and has
the edge on Stanford in both
depth and experience. Greg
Boyer and )ohn Dobrott, both
seniors who played for De
ttamanti at the World Univer
sity Games this summer, are
"the guys that make the team
go," Dettamanti said. In addi
tion, the Gauchos have an ex
cellent goalie in Craig Wilson.
Both teams have an effective
counter-attack, Dettamanti
said. While he gave the edge in
size to the Gauchos, he said he

believes the Cardinals have the
advantage in team speed and
defense.
"We've been able to beat
them with the counter be
fore," the coach said. "I think
we have more speed than they
do. I think we're also going to
have to exploit their 1-on-1 de
tense." Dettamanti said he ex
pected his team to be driving
with more intensity than in the
past, something they have
been practicing all week.
To the Cards, whose best
possible Pacific-10 finish would
be a tie for second, tomorrow's
game takes on extra impor
tance. In the event that they
beat Cal next week to ensure
that second place tie, a victory
over the first-ranked Gauchos
could earn the favor of the
Powers That Choose when the
NCAA Tournament contenders
are selected. In the past, the
top two teams from both the
Pac-10 and the PCAA have been
chosen, along with four out
of-state teams to round out the
field of eight.
But that decision is still over
a week away and as Dettamanti
calls it, "it's a toss-up."
