# Iranians reject PLO bid
## 
### Associated Press 
Iranian students holding the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran rejected a bid by
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) yesterday to negotiate
freedom for their American hos
tages, Tehran radio said. In Lebanon,
a second attempt to seize a U.S. Em
bassy was reported foiled.
Militants in the Iranian capital of
Tehran seized the U.S. Embassy on
Sunday and took about 60 hostages.
Britain's Independent Television
Network showed film from Tehran ol
a woman hostage being treed from
the embassy. She told newsmen she
was set free because she was an Ira
nian working as an interpreter.
They have demanded that the U.S.
government return the exiled Shah
of Iran, who is in a New York hospi
tal, to stand trial.
The deposed shah ot Iran is willing

to leave the United States in hopes of
freeing Americans being held hos
tage in Iran, but his doctors say the
move could kill him, a statement is
sued tor the shah said yesterday.
The statement was released by
Robert Armao, senior adviser to the
shah.
Attempts to interview the shah
were rejected yesterday as they have
been in the past. "The tamily at this
point wants to remain in seclusion,"
said Armao spokeswoman Chris
Godek. She said there would be no
elaboration on the statement.
In a grisly display of the Iranian
students' anti-American zeal, a pro
tester set himself atire outside the
Tehran embassy, Iran's Pars news
agency said. He was later reported
near death in a hospital.
The students, meanwhile, re
leased what they said was embassy
correspondence showing that U.S.
officials had planned last summer to
allow Shah Mohammad Re/a Pahlavi
into the United States permanently.
In Beirut, Lebanese security
sources said the PLO thwarted a plan
by 40 armed Iranians to storm the
U.S. Embassy in the Lebanese capi
tal. The sources told The Associated
Press the alleged plotters were under
house arrest in a Palestinian refugee
camp in southern Lebanon.
Spokesmen tor the PLO and the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut said they had
no information on the reported
takeover plan, and it could not be
confirmed elsewhere.
In Tehran, meanwhile, one ot the
Moslem students occupying the em
bassy said the hostages had not been
injured because "in Islam we don't
believe to hurt someone . . . they are
very well and we know their rights.''
The unidentitied student, in a
telephone interview with a Canadian
radio station, stressed that "we are
not enemies with people, but with
governments."
Iranian demonstrators today
blindfolded one ot the American
hostages, bound his hands behind
his back and paraded him around the
embassy garden while mobs
shouted, "Death to Carter!" and
"Send Bat k the Shah!" a witness re
ported in a call to The Associated

Press in Athens. The witness asked
not to be identified.
It was announced that President
Jimmy Carter, overseeing U.S. ef
forts to tree the hostages, had can
celed his trip to Canada.
The rejection ol the PLC) mission
seemed to kill one of the best hopes
lor ending the explosive situation
quickly and peacefully.
The students said Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini, supreme leader of
Iran s Islamic republic, and his sec re
tive Revolutionary Council backed
them in rebuffing the two-man PLC)
mediation team, Tehran radio re
ported in a broadcast monitored in
Kuwait.
They would not "open talks with
anybody or accept any mediation,"
the students said, until the United
States met their main demand
sending the exiled shah back lo Iran
for trial.
PLO officials at the United Nations
and in Washington denied mediation
efforts had been rejected.
Algerian sources said that hard
line Arab country had joined in the
efforts, presumably through its em
bassy in Tehran. The sour< es retused
to elaborate, saying, "Secrecy is es
sential if the efforts are to succeed."
At U.N. headquarters in New York,
a spokesman said Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim had obtained the
help of Pakistan and was seeking the
intercession of other Islamic and
Arab countries to save lives in
Tehran. U.S. officials at the United
Nations said a Security Counc il meet
ing on the matter was under consid
eration.
Belore the PLO mission was rebut
ted, U.S. officials reported that
former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, Carter's special envoy, was
meeting with a PLC) representative in
Istanbul, Turkey, to try lo speed up
the mediation process.
Khomeini had barred Clark's own
peace mission Wednesday. But U.S.
officials hoped that the delegation
Irom the PIO, which has built sirong
ties lo Iran's revolutionary regime,
might he able to begin talks with
Khomeini and the other religious
leaders who hold the real power in
the country.
