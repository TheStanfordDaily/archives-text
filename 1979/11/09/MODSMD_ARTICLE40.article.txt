Alter winning 3-0 over Australia's lllawarra Association in an
exhibition game Tuesday, Stanford's tield hockey team now
heads to Long Beach for weekend matches with Arizona today
and Long Beach State tomorrow.
Nancy White, Lynn Keyser and Becky Howell gave the scotch
ers their three-goal win over lllawarra. White also provided assist
passes for Keyser's and Howell's goals.
"The game was slower at first, but then it really picked up. I
think the girls just had to get used to a foreign style of playing,"
said head coach Barbara Longstreth about the game.
Having now played 13 games, the scotchers go into this
weekend's confrontations with a near-perfect 10-1-2 record. In
these 13 games, the Stanford women have scored 30 goals over an
opposition total of seven goals. 13 of Stanford's points have been
scored by Nancy White. Kelly Westerwick is the team's next
highest scorer with eight goals to date.
Longstreth emphasized the strength of this weekend's teams,
especially Long Beach State who finished seventh in the nation
last year over the Cards' thirteenth place.
"We're a little worried about our injuries too," said Longstreth.
Last week's battle with Sacramento State left halt Julia johnson
with a fractured ankle and back Jeanine Valadez with a knee
injury. "Their absences will weaken the defense. But we've got a
lot of depth, which we'll really need. We ought to be okay. It's
really too bad for the girls alter working so hard though," said
Longstreth.
This weekend will thus be a time to test untapped powers as
frosh players Caroline Rhodes, Cathy Nicholsen, and Andrea
Welsh move in to fill these defensive gaps. Along with being
NorCal Conference games, the matches with Arizona and long
Beach State will also provide an opportunity to test new player
combinations in preparation towards the Nov. 16-17 Regicn Eight
Tournament.
