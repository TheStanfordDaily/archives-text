One o! Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disoider ot
the relationship between a
mother and a son. tuna is Ber
tolucci's first English-language
film, hut he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he (foes with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Ntoraro (who also did the brilliant
cinematography in Apocalypse
Vow) provides him with startling
images, but Bertolucci seems to
• till be groping with the intellec
tual dimensions ol his subject;
he's not quite suie how to com
municate it In a very different
role, |ill (Tayburgh is sporadically
good; it's her most mannered
performance, and such an ap
proach doesn't quite suit her. As
the son, Matthew Brady is the
best tiling in the movie. Both
overpoweringly violent and sur
prisingly sensual, Brady delivers
a trighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.

Rock 'n' Roll High School* * ★ *
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
American schlock cinema at its
artistic height. Rock n' Roll High
School is a must-see movie about
the energies of high-school re
volution. This slea/v little music al
brims with vitality, vetve and the
heavy backbeat ot the Ramones.
A grade-/ version of Crease but
tar more exciting.

Hair* ★ * Ik-
New Varsity, tonight
A great musical tantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos human (Taking Oil, One
Hew Over the Cuckoos Nest)
works in a reckless, giddy style;
he perfectly captures the rebelli
ous rock n' roll spirit ol the '60s
and gives it Irte again. It's a fan
tasy vision ot America, but even
in those terms. Hair |ust might be
the truest picture ot the 'Wis ever
made. With |ohn Savage, Ireat
Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.

I love this movie, yet it's the
kind ol lilm that makes you ques
tion your emotions (and perhaps

even doubt your sanity).
Strangelove exploits your reac
tions in obviously threatening
ways; just why do we laugh so
hard at the notion ot complete
destruction^
Director Stanley Kubrick's orig
inal conception of Strangelove
was lor it to be serious drama, but
he tound that he couldn't take
the idea ot planned holocaust
seriously. Kubrick realizes that
even though the movie brings us
tace-to-tace with fiery, horrible
death, some ol us, in the end, will
still want to ride that missile witli
Slim Pickens. It's black humor
that's truly ( hilling, and it hits you
hard atterward. Peter Sellers is
ama/ing in multiple roles; his
Kissinger and Werner Von
Braun-inspired scientist-adviser
is trighteningly tunny.

The Buddy Holly Story * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9:15 p.m.
Gary Busey's upper lip and ex
pressive eyebrows are as fine as
any in the business, his showing
as Buddy Holly makes this movie
worthwhile. Busey c an sing, too,
and he is also a marvelously
idiosync rate actor; when the
plot gets saccharine towards the

end, he holds it all together. The
Buddy Holly Slory could have
been better, and that's no hooey,
but it's hard to imagine a tiner
hit k superstar than the one we've
got right now.

Witness lor the Prosecution* -k *
Friday, Kresge 7: JO A 9:10 p.m.
Billy Wilder directed this man
nered, perhaps too serious adap
tation ot Agatha Christie's fam
ous play. More a courtroom
drama than a murder mystery,
but Dame Agatha's twist ending
is still an ellective, it incongru
ous, device here. Marlene Diet
rich and Tyrone Power give
tired yet businesslike perlor
mances. A very tunny Charles
laughton, who overacts
shamelessly as an aging barrister,
steals the show.

Apocalypse Mow * * * *
Old Mill
Century 11, Sari |«se
Northpoint, San Francisco
An ama/ing work of mad
genius that sueteeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanc ed in
telligence in his reworking ol
loseph Conrad s 1902 novella
Heart ol Darkness he c mploys
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point ot view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine Irightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross
horribly fascinate some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Mow is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie ot this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness ot this im
possible.' almost nihilistic, vis
ion ol mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.

The Onion Held * * #
Old Mill
This movie belongs on the
shell next to other loseph Warn

baugh tales; a lough "fact
stranger than fiction'' piece,
which smacks ot sex, savagery
and, nonetheless, a sensitivity of
the agony and the leai which
keep hoih cops and robbers
awake nights. |ohn Savage is
stunning as an I .A. policeman,
who must keep his lite together

tight clean acting, editing and

Palo Alto Square
Rarely rises above tfie level of
uninspired 40s romantic com
edy: couple gets divorced, man

looks lor someone new. lots ot
"comic misadventures along
the way, man linally finds some
one, his wife tries to take him
back, man forced to choose bet
ween his ex-wife and new love.
The ma|or "suspense" concerns
who be will pic k. Not exac tl\ your
most wonderfully novel movie
idea.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much it the movie were carried
off with the kind of winking
lightness that Hurl Reynolds' per
lormance here continually deliv
ers. Ml Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to
be bad and she's successful.
Director Alan Pakula (Klutv, All
Thv President s Men) is more at
home with drama; his comic
touch is, at best, unsure No mai
ler what Hurt Reynolds is in, it
seems, he ends up being the only
reason to see it.

Life of Brian * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Soil ot like (lO(lsf)vll with dirty
jokes Several brilliant sketches

are lost in ihe drivel; it's all
tunny, but it goes on lor mucli
too long. Python takes aim at bi
blical epics, terrorist logistics,
and the PLO; while they don't
always score, even a series of
bullseyes would be boring. A
Python movie needs a better plot
than the Bible can provide.

And Justice for All
Palo Alto Square
About 10 years ago, this tilm
would have made a great TV pilot
movie, and that's probably the
best that can be said for it. Lots of
the "can the honest, crusading
lawyer keep his integrity in the
ugly, dog-eat-dog world ot crim
inals, dirty attorneys and dishon
est judges?" type conflict. Direc
tor Norman lewison, who should
know better, directs the shallow
dramatics and cheap comedy in
the script with an embarrassing
earnestness. Al Pacino has never
seemed so ordinary; by sheer
lore c of will, he's interesting, but
the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be sue c esstul in his bid tor
a weekly series?" Pacino must be
more ambitious than that.

A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
intend to think about it and not
just bask in its glow. Arttul
black-and-white i inematography
combines with new directing
skills and a tresh attitude toward
filmmaking to provide a sensitive
portrayal ot the struggle lor far
mers rights in North Dakota in
1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actor- appear
m this oc<asionally slow-moving
winner ot the Cannes Golden

human characterizations and
poignant plot. A thinking per
