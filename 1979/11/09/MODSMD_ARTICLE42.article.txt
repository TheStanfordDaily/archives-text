U.S. machines 'aid' Russian weapons
Washington — The Soviet Union apparently has used
sophisticated machines purchased Irom the United
States to improve the accuracy of its largest and most
deadly nuclear missile, a Pentagon intelligence expert
said yesterday.
The oflic lal said "it seems like a reasonable presump
tion" that precision miniature ball bearing grinding
machines made in the United States were used in de
veloping the guidance system of the Soviets' <(Wl SS-18
"heavy" missiles.
Those machines and other purchases trom Western
countries "have made or are making a distinct contribu
tion to the Soviet military procurement ettort," said Dr.
lack Vorona, a science and tec hnology spec ialist in the
Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency.
He testified belore a Senate armed services subcom
mittee investigating Soviet weapons development.
"Would it be accurate to say American know-how is
being used lo develop the Soviet war mac asked
Sen. FHarry Bvrd (l-Va.l, chairman ol the procurement
subcommittee.
"Yes sir, very accurate," Vorona replied.
Fte testified thai an automated foundry purchased in
the United States is being used fo make engines lor
trucks used in the Soviet military and that precision
torging equipment purchased in Austria is being used in
the production ol gun tubes lor Russian artillery.
Vorona said the Soviets are seeking Western fee hnol
ogy and equipment "by any and all means," adding that,
"an entire series ol Soviet computers is based on IBM
360 and 370 computers that were illegally diverted into
the Soviet Union in 1971 and 19~2."

Oil Co. came from British Petroleum Co., Iran's largest
customer, and from others including Exxon Corp., Ash
land Oil Inc., Cult Oil Corp., Shell Oil International and
several large trading companies in Japan.

drop in oil production or the diversion of oil from con
tract sales to the more lucrative spot market, where oil
prices are more than 50 percent higher.
"We were encouraged by the news," said Ashland
spokesman Dan Lacey. "It seems to imply that the Ira
nians intend to keep exports moving" after widespread
reports suggested Iran may have halted oil shipments.

have denied that exports ceased this week at the key
Kharg Island oil port on the Persian Cult, and
U.S. government u.id industry spokesmen have said
shipments are continuing.

percent higher than a year ago, and analysts and gov
ernment spokesmen have said heating oil supplies are
ample lor the winter.

First PSA crash damages awarded
San Diego — A 52-year-old fisherman and his family
won $200,000 yesterday in the tirst wrongful death award
in the fiery collision last year between a Pacific South
west Airlines jetliner and private plane.
A Superior Court jury deliberated only two hours in
San Diego before setting the damages in a suit filed by
Frank Lococo and his five children.
The El Cajon family had sought $2.4 million from PSA

in damages over the death of Lococo's wife, Rosalia,
who was one of 144 people killed when the jet hit a small
Cessna and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood
minutes before it was to land at Lindbergh Field.
The Sept. 25,1978 crash was the worst aviation disaster
in American history up to that time.
The family's attorneys expressed disappointment over
the settlement and said a request for a new trial was
under consideration.
Since PSA agreed not tocontest liability, the jury'ssole
task was to determine damages.
In the tinal argument before the jury, attorney Mar
shall Foreman scaled down the requested damages to
"at least $750,000" and termed PSA's otter of $150,000
"an insult to the family."

Washington — The Soviet Union apparently has used
sophisticated machines purchased Irom the United
States to improve the accuracy of its largest and most
deadly nuclear missile, a Pentagon intelligence expert

machines made in the United States were used in de

Those machines and other purchases trom Western
countries "have made or are making a distinct contribu

lack Vorona, a science and tec hnology spec ialist in the
Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency.

Fte testified thai an automated foundry purchased in
the United States is being used fo make engines lor
trucks used in the Soviet military and that precision
torging equipment purchased in Austria is being used in
the production ol gun tubes lor Russian artillery.
Vorona said the Soviets are seeking Western fee hnol

First PSA crash damages awarded
San Diego — A 52-year-old fisherman and his family
won $200,000 yesterday in the tirst wrongful death award
in the fiery collision last year between a Pacific South
west Airlines jetliner and private plane.
A Superior Court jury deliberated only two hours in

in damages over the death of Lococo's wife, Rosalia,
who was one of 144 people killed when the jet hit a small
Cessna and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood
minutes before it was to land at Lindbergh Field.

in American history up to that time.

the settlement and said a request for a new trial was
under consideration.
Since PSA agreed not tocontest liability, the jury'ssole
task was to determine damages.
In the tinal argument before the jury, attorney Mar
shall Foreman scaled down the requested damages to
"at least $750,000" and termed PSA's otter of $150,000
"an insult to the family."

First PSA crash damages awarded
San Diego — A 52-year-old fisherman and his family
won $200,000 yesterday in the tirst wrongful death award
in the fiery collision last year between a Pacific South
west Airlines jetliner and private plane.
A Superior Court jury deliberated only two hours in
San Diego before setting the damages in a suit filed by
Frank Lococo and his five children.
The El Cajon family had sought $2.4 million from PSA

in damages over the death of Lococo's wife, Rosalia,
who was one of 144 people killed when the jet hit a small
Cessna and crashed into a San Diego neighborhood
minutes before it was to land at Lindbergh Field.
The Sept. 25,1978 crash was the worst aviation disaster
in American history up to that time.
The family's attorneys expressed disappointment over
the settlement and said a request for a new trial was
under consideration.
Since PSA agreed not tocontest liability, the jury'ssole
task was to determine damages.
In the tinal argument before the jury, attorney Mar
shall Foreman scaled down the requested damages to
"at least $750,000" and termed PSA's otter of $150,000
"an insult to the family."
