Students may tind it hard to study in Meyer Library
next week as maintenance workers install energy-saving
lighting tixtures in the ceilings of the building.
Lucille Maravilla, maintenance coordinator, said
workers will be replacing lighting tubes in the ceilings
from about 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. friday and next week.
The project involves taking out the present lighting
tixtures and replacing them with energy-conserving
lamps that will-result in a $10,000 savings each year on
the University's electricity bill.
