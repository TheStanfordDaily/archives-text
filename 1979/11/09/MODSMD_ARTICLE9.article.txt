# Cubans advocate Soviet tilt
## Disunity plagues non-aligned bloc 
### Carol Rose 
As Third World nations at
tempt to unite, they will tace
conflict trom within the
movement, David Abernethy,
associate professor of political
science said. "In their attempt
at positive unity, they often
rely on rhetoric to conceal dit
terences," he said.
Rhetoric and conflict domi
nated the Havana summit con
ference ot non-aligned nations
held in late September. The
conference, which included
delegates from 92 nations, was
held tor the first time in the
Western Hemisphere, with
Cuba taking its turn as host and
president ot the movement.
The non-aligned movement
was c reated in 1961 to establish
a unified and neutralist posi
tion lor the Third World in the
midst of cold war rivalry bet

ween the Soviet Union and the
United States.
The movement was tar from
unitied at the Havana confer
ence, however, with three fac
tions advocating contrasting
directions tor the tuture of
non-alignment.
Twenty-tour "radical" na
tions led by Cuba and Vietnam
supported outright alliance ol
the movement with the Soviet
Union. These anti-capitalist
countries are held together by
"Western colonization and the
need to work out their anti-
Western leelings," according
to Abernethy.
Twenty-seven conservative
nations supported an alliance
with the United States and the
major industrialized democ
racies. These nations rely lor
the most part on the United
States lor economic and milit
ary aid.
T he United States has its own
interests in mind when it aids
these countries, remarked
Faustin Vao, a doctoral student
from the Ivory Coast and a
member ol the African Student
Association here.
The United States can only
gain by developing a country
because increased trade and
economic power in a Third
World nation means that il can
buy more irom the United
States.

The remaining 41 nations at
the conference chose to re
main non-aligned, opposing al
liance with either the Soviet
Union or the United States.
Cuban President Fidel Cas
tro presented a declaration of
principles as chairman ot the
conlerence, claiming that
Moscow was a natural ally ot
the movement, and blaming
the United States lor the Third
World's economic and political
problems.
Vet the Soviet Union has not
acted as an ally ol the non
aligned movement, according
to I ranklin Weinstein, director
o! the US-Japan Relations Pro
ject and lecturer in political
science here.
"Economically, the Soviet
Union as a superpower has
begun to side with the indus
trialized nations," he said.
The Soviet Union would
have to take some responsibil
ity tor economic development
in the Third World il it were to
be "a natural ally" ot the
movement, Weinstein said.
Blaming the United States
alone tor the problems ol the
Third World is too simple,
Abernethy said, noting that an
even-handed distribution ol
credit and blame is in order.
"II the Third World countries
think that the International
Monetary fund (IMf) and the

World Bank are bad, then the
United States should pull sup
port out ot those countries. It
we did remove that aid, we
would be severely criticized lor
it,"he said.
"Pragmatically, the Third
World nations require the capi
tal, skilled manpower, and
markets lor their manufac
tured goods," he said.
Some observers disagree.
"Often the United States uses
its power to violate the
sovereign rights of a country,"
remarked Carlos Romeros, j
student specializing in Latin
American studies.
The future of the non
aligned movement appears
bleak.
"As a foreign policy lor each
nation, non-alignment will he
come increasingly attractive to
the Third World," according to
Weinstein. Vet "as a unitied
movement, it is uncertain, be
cause of different tactions," lie
said.
Nevertheless, the ideologi
cal differences may be benefi
cial, Yao said.
"Due to the split, the people
who want a real non-alignment
movement will reorganize fo
give it more strength," he
noted.
"It is best to show the Kurd
World can be united and pow
erful."

The remaining 41 nations at
the conference chose to re
main non-aligned, opposing al
liance with either the Soviet
Union or the United States.
Cuban President Fidel Cas
tro presented a declaration of
principles as chairman ot the
conlerence, claiming that
Moscow was a natural ally ot
the movement, and blaming
the United States lor the Third
World's economic and political
problems.
Vet the Soviet Union has not
acted as an ally ol the non
aligned movement, according
to I ranklin Weinstein, director
o! the US-Japan Relations Pro
ject and lecturer in political
science here.
"Economically, the Soviet
Union as a superpower has
begun to side with the indus
trialized nations," he said.
The Soviet Union would
have to take some responsibil
ity tor economic development
in the Third World il it were to
be "a natural ally" ot the
movement, Weinstein said.
Blaming the United States
alone tor the problems ol the
Third World is too simple,
Abernethy said, noting that an
even-handed distribution ol
credit and blame is in order.
"II the Third World countries
think that the International
Monetary fund (IMf) and the

World Bank are bad, then the
United States should pull sup
port out ot those countries. It
we did remove that aid, we
would be severely criticized lor
it,"he said.
"Pragmatically, the Third
World nations require the capi
tal, skilled manpower, and
markets lor their manufac
tured goods," he said.
Some observers disagree.
"Often the United States uses
its power to violate the
sovereign rights of a country,"
remarked Carlos Romeros, j
student specializing in Latin
American studies.
The future of the non
aligned movement appears
bleak.
"As a foreign policy lor each
nation, non-alignment will he
come increasingly attractive to
the Third World," according to
Weinstein. Vet "as a unitied
movement, it is uncertain, be
cause of different tactions," lie
said.
Nevertheless, the ideologi
cal differences may be benefi
cial, Yao said.
"Due to the split, the people
who want a real non-alignment
movement will reorganize fo
give it more strength," he
noted.
"It is best to show the Kurd
World can be united and pow
erful."
As Third World nations at
tempt to unite, they will tace
conflict trom within the
movement, David Abernethy,
associate professor of political
science said. "In their attempt
at positive unity, they often
rely on rhetoric to conceal dit
terences," he said.
Rhetoric and conflict domi
nated the Havana summit con
ference ot non-aligned nations
held in late September. The
conference, which included
delegates from 92 nations, was
held tor the first time in the
Western Hemisphere, with
Cuba taking its turn as host and
president ot the movement.
The non-aligned movement
was c reated in 1961 to establish
a unified and neutralist posi
tion lor the Third World in the
midst of cold war rivalry bet

ween the Soviet Union and the
United States.
The movement was tar from
unitied at the Havana confer
ence, however, with three fac
tions advocating contrasting
directions tor the tuture of
non-alignment.
Twenty-tour "radical" na
tions led by Cuba and Vietnam
supported outright alliance ol
the movement with the Soviet
Union. These anti-capitalist
countries are held together by
"Western colonization and the
need to work out their anti-
Western leelings," according
to Abernethy.
Twenty-seven conservative
nations supported an alliance
with the United States and the
major industrialized democ
racies. These nations rely lor
the most part on the United
States lor economic and milit
ary aid.
T he United States has its own
interests in mind when it aids
these countries, remarked
Faustin Vao, a doctoral student
from the Ivory Coast and a
member ol the African Student
Association here.
The United States can only
gain by developing a country
because increased trade and
economic power in a Third
World nation means that il can
buy more irom the United
States.
