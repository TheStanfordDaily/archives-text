# Unexpected outcome for Ohira
## Japan's elections result in little change 
### Chris Heftel 
As the dust settles following
Japan's recent general elec
tion, it appears that little has
really changed.
In the week of the Oct. 7
vote, Japanese editors claimed
that the results were a warning
from the public that it was tired
of the "arrogance of the ruling
party." But while the ruling
Liberal-Democratic Parly (LDP)
lost one seat of its slim major
ity, its portion of the popular
vote showed a 2.8 percent in
crease over the previous gen
eral election.
According to custom follow
ing a general election, Prime
Minister Masayoshi Ohira and
his cabinet resigned lor the
party to elect a new Prime
Minister.
A surprisingly strong chal
lenge for the Premiership by
former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda resulted in a political
stalemate lasting nearly a
month, which was resolved in
the party vote confirming
Ohira last Monday.
Prior to the election, expec
tations were tor great changes.
Independent surveys, news
paper polls and politicians all
predicted the LDP to win big
and to gain total dominance ol
the Diet (parliament). When
they instead barely maintained
their slim majority, LDP mem
bers expressed bitter disap
pointment over Ohira's failure
to lead the Party into a great
victory.
Yet the LDP's major opposi
tion party, the Socialist Partv

(JSP), failed to take advantage
of the LDP's surprising weak
nesses. The JSP lost 16 seats,
bringing its total to 107 seats.
The results were comforting to
JSP leaders, however, given
predic lions that the JSP would
lose even more seals,
The lapan Communist Parly
< I CP) showed its strong popu
lar support in the election,
garnering 10 percent of the
vote and winning 59 seats, 20
more than in 1976. However,
this does little to increase the
ICP's legislative power.
Why were the outcomes so
different from the expecta
tions! 1 The answer lies in part in
Japan's electoral system.
Each district elects several
representatives. Each con
stituent, however, gets only
one vote. Thus strategy in run
ning candidates can he a cru
cial factor in winning.
It one candidate wins hv too
large a margin, he takes away
votes from fellow party candi
dates in'the same district. It a
party runs too many candidates
in a single district, its votes will
be spread out, and all of its
candidates may lose.
An analysis conducted by
one ot Japan's leading daily
newspapers, the Asa/)/ S/?//??-
bun, cited tactical errors on the
part ot the LDP lor its losses.
The study concluded that the
LDP ran too many c andidates in
some districts, possibly trom
overconfident e.
Analysts also point to the
stormy weather on election
dav as another reason lor the

LDP's poor showing. Generally
older and more conservative
than the average voter, LDP
supporters were more likely to
be discouraged from venturing
out to vote in the high winds
and heavy rain.
Many believe that the LDP
actually came close to winning
a major victory.
"A slight change, like the
weather, could have resulted
in a big difference," according
to Akio Nomura, Washington
correspondent tor the Asahi
Shim bun.

observed that the number of
seals won is not a good indica

o) the popular vote captured
by a party is more apt to reveal
a party's appeal, they said.

the LDP gain, but the Democra

tion of trends. The percentage
o) the popular vote captured
by a party is more apt to reveal
a party's appeal, they said.
"Ihey noted that not only did
the LDP gain, but the Democra
tic Socialist Party (DSP),
another moderate party, made
popular vote gains. It any
thing, recent elections indicate
a slight conservative trend, the
professors said.
Thus the LDP continues to
maintain a slight majority in the
Diet, and Prime Minister Ohira
remains in power.
As the dust settles following
Japan's recent general elec
tion, it appears that little has
really changed.
In the week of the Oct. 7
vote, Japanese editors claimed
that the results were a warning
from the public that it was tired
of the "arrogance of the ruling
party." But while the ruling
Liberal-Democratic Parly (LDP)
lost one seat of its slim major
ity, its portion of the popular
vote showed a 2.8 percent in
crease over the previous gen
eral election.
According to custom follow
ing a general election, Prime
Minister Masayoshi Ohira and
his cabinet resigned lor the
party to elect a new Prime
Minister.
A surprisingly strong chal
lenge for the Premiership by
former Prime Minister Takeo
Fukuda resulted in a political
stalemate lasting nearly a
month, which was resolved in
the party vote confirming
Ohira last Monday.
Prior to the election, expec
tations were tor great changes.
Independent surveys, news
paper polls and politicians all
predicted the LDP to win big
and to gain total dominance ol
the Diet (parliament). When
they instead barely maintained
their slim majority, LDP mem
bers expressed bitter disap
pointment over Ohira's failure
to lead the Party into a great
victory.
Yet the LDP's major opposi
tion party, the Socialist Partv

(JSP), failed to take advantage
of the LDP's surprising weak
nesses. The JSP lost 16 seats,
bringing its total to 107 seats.
The results were comforting to
JSP leaders, however, given
predic lions that the JSP would
lose even more seals,
The lapan Communist Parly
< I CP) showed its strong popu
lar support in the election,
garnering 10 percent of the
vote and winning 59 seats, 20
more than in 1976. However,
this does little to increase the
ICP's legislative power.
Why were the outcomes so
different from the expecta
tions! 1 The answer lies in part in
Japan's electoral system.
Each district elects several
representatives. Each con
stituent, however, gets only
one vote. Thus strategy in run
ning candidates can he a cru
cial factor in winning.
It one candidate wins hv too
large a margin, he takes away
votes from fellow party candi
dates in'the same district. It a
party runs too many candidates
in a single district, its votes will
be spread out, and all of its
candidates may lose.
An analysis conducted by
one ot Japan's leading daily
newspapers, the Asa/)/ S/?//??-
bun, cited tactical errors on the
part ot the LDP lor its losses.
The study concluded that the
LDP ran too many c andidates in
some districts, possibly trom
overconfident e.
Analysts also point to the
stormy weather on election
dav as another reason lor the

LDP's poor showing. Generally
older and more conservative
than the average voter, LDP
supporters were more likely to
be discouraged from venturing
out to vote in the high winds
and heavy rain.
Many believe that the LDP
actually came close to winning
a major victory.
"A slight change, like the
weather, could have resulted
in a big difference," according
to Akio Nomura, Washington
correspondent tor the Asahi
Shim bun.
