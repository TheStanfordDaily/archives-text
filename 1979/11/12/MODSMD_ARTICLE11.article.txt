# Foreign journalists say U.S. image hurt in Iran
## 
### Associated Press 
Editorial writers around the
world Friday saw the Iran crisis
as both a blow to the prestige
of the United States and a
symptomof Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's political woes.
One appeal seemed
universal — that both sides re
frain from rash actions.
"American influence has
waned to the point where les
ser nations thumb their noses
and defy the U.S. to hit back,"
commented South Africa's
Johannesburg Star.
"Not so long ago, U.S.
Marines would have landed to
protect American lives," said
the Straits Times of Singapore.
Now, it noted, a special U.S.
mission to Iran has been
turned back and"the best
hopes of a solution appear to
lie with the Palestine Liberation
Organization," a group with
which the United States re
tuses to deal officially.
U.S. 'cornered'
The seizure of the U.S. Em
bassy and some 60 American
hostages in Tehran has Presi

dent Carter "cornered," wrote
commentator Sami Kohen in
the respected Turkish news
paper Milliyet. But he said the
position ot Iranian leader
Khomeini may not be much
more comfortable.
With the embassy takeover,
Khomeini has "created a na
tional excitement in view of his
waning support and mounting
serious political and economic
problems," Kohen said.
". . . What is most distres
sing ... is that the ayatollah
has transferred the administra
tion to 'people on the streets'
and he faces a virtual loss ot
control" over the Iranian
people, he wrote.
Since toppling Shah
Mohammad Keza Pahlavi's
government last February after
a popular revolution, Kho
meini and his religiously
oriented regime have gradually
lost much support among the
Iranian middle class, the edu
cated bureaucracy and the lett.
The economy is still reeling
trom the year-long national up
rising.
Siding with students
Khomeini's decision to side
with the students occupying
the embassy may have been
aimed at keeping himsell in
control "for there is no telling
how the students would have
reacted it the ayatollah had op
posed them," wrote
editorialist Apolonio Battala in
Bulletin Today of Manila, the
Philippines.
The resulting near anarchy in
Tehran may threaten Kho
meini, said the daily O Clolio
of Rio de laneiro, Brazil.
F he Soviet news agency Tass
said the angry protests already
taking place in the United
States were inspired by
"right-wing circles" that "are
stirring up a veritable anti-
Iranian hysteria."
