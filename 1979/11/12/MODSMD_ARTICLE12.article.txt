### 
Peking (AP) — In one ol the most sweeping
disavowals yel ol Mao-style communism, a
member ol the Chinese Politburo was quoted
yesterday as saying most of current "patterns
and conventions" ol socialism in China should
be cast aside.
/hao/iyang, in a speech reported by the offi
cial news agency Xinhua, said China must stick
to the "socialist road," but he dismissed the
ec onomic theories ol Marx and Engels, and said
the Chinese have had "muddled ideas" about
socialism.
The speech was particularly significant be
( ause /hao, (>l, a newly elected member of Chi
na's ruling Politburo, is a close ally of Senior
\ ice Premier Deng Xiaoping and is regarded by
some as ,i ( andidate to succeed Deng, 75, in the
top leadership.
Since the death ol Mao Tse-tung in 1976 and
the emergence ol the "pragmatic" leadership ot

Deng and Premier Hua Guofeng, the process of
dismantling the more dogmatic aspects of
Maoism has advanced swiftly. But Zhao's state
ments, presumably made with Deng's blessings,
were some of the hardest-hitting yet.
"All economic patterns and conventions
which hold back the development of productive
forces should be abolished in order to make the
best use of existing potential and get China's
social productive forces to expand rapidly,"
"Of course we must adhere to the socialist
road," he said. "But previously we had many
muddled ideas about what is socialism . . .
"Things which are not an inseparable part of
society were taken as inviolable holy principles,
and this prevented people from emancipating
their minds." This was an apparent reference to
the slavish devotion most people in power paid
to Mao's ideas during his 27 years in power.
