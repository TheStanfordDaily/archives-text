# Postal service is a good bet

### 
Washington (AP) — A New York City banker,
frustrated by sluggish mail delivery, issued a
challenge to Postmaster General William
Bolger:
In a letter mailed to Bolger on a Friday, Robert
Landau wrote, "I'll bet you one of those new
Susan B. Anthony coins that you don't get this
letter for at least five business days."
On Monday, the next business day, Bolger
was on the phone with the letter in his hands. "Bob,
you owe me a buck," he told Landau.
Bolger, whose agency is regularly ridiculed in
jokes and cartoons, now answers critics with
successes. Some successes are as small as the $1
challenge. Some are as big as a budget surplus
of at least $400 million that he expects to an
nounce soon,
The U.S. Postal Service is making money after
33 consecutive years in the red. Accountants are
still trying to determine the final profit figures
for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
Bolger is helping reverse several patterns.
—The Postal Service, which had such heavy
debts during the mid-'7os that it was threatened
with insolvency, has stopped borrowing and is
paying off some of the old debts.
—Instead of asking for a new taxpayer sub
sidy, as his predecessor once did, Bolger de
clinedlo support a House-passed bill to give the
Postal Service $2.98 billion over the next five
years. The bill thus faces rough going in the
Senate. If a new subsidy is voted down, the
payments from tax revenue will automatically
drop under current law.
—Mail volume, an important factor in holding
down rates, continues to grow and in 1980 is
expected to exceed 100 billion pieces for the
first time. Compare that to the prediction made
by former Postmaster General Benjamin Bailar,
that the 1976 volume of 90 billion pieces "will
probably stand forever as our peak, for we pro
ject that over the next five years volume will
slump to 83 or 84 billion and never recover."
Bolger said in an interview, "We took a lot of
costs out of the mail system through job attri
tion. We increased our mechanization and de
cided we weren't going to increase our rates
until we absolutely had to. That's why our vol
ume grew."
The quality of service is harder to demonstrate
with numbers, but Bolger said the growth in

volume indicates reasonably good service.
"One of the reasons why our volume wasn't
growing was that we weren't providing a good
level of service. We would take in the mail and
then we wouldn't deliver it in a timely fashion.
Now I think we are doing better and the num
bers point that out."
Still, he admitted, "We make mistakes, some
horrible mistakes. There is reason for people to
be angry at the horror stories and even to make
jokes about us. You can't handle 100 billion
pieces of mail in a year without making mis
takes."
One big mistake occurred in New York City
the last week of October when a conveyor belt
broke down on the first day of operation at the
new Morgan mail-sorting complex. The 18-hour
breakdown, caused by an overload, delayed
millions of pieces of mail for several days.
Bolger's plans include expanded mechaniza
tion in mail handling, a step that will lead to
lengthening zip codes from five to nine digits.
The transition will come between 1981 and 1984.
Announcement of the expanded code last
year brought some criticism, but Bolger said the
longer zip code will permit quicker sorting,
which will hold down postage rates.
The changes in Postal Service performance
have made some converts. The Washington
Post, where some of the most bitter cartoons
appeared, said recently, "The Postal Service is
doing much better than most people expected a
few years ago."
And Emmet Andrews, president of the Ameri
can Postal Workers Union, who often has
criticized postal management, called publicly
for some "good-mouthing" of the Postal Ser
vice.
Problems still lieahead, including another de
ficit in 1980 as higher costs take their toll. Bolger
predicted next year's deficit at $575 million, a
figure which would pressure the agency to raise
rates.
And Bolger always expects some complaints
about delayed mail similar to that from the New
York banker.
He said the ideal situation for the Postal Ser
vice is to be taken for granted. "When we are
performing, then people accept that as the way
we should operate and we never hear from
them," he said.

letter for at least five business days."
On Monday, the next business day, Bolger
was on the phone with the letter in his hands. "Bob,
you owe me a buck," he told Landau.
Bolger, whose agency is regularly ridiculed in
jokes and cartoons, now answers critics with
successes. Some successes are as small as the $1
challenge. Some are as big as a budget surplus
of at least $400 million that he expects to an
nounce soon,
The U.S. Postal Service is making money after
33 consecutive years in the red. Accountants are
still trying to determine the final profit figures
for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
Bolger is helping reverse several patterns.
—The Postal Service, which had such heavy
debts during the mid-'7os that it was threatened
with insolvency, has stopped borrowing and is
paying off some of the old debts.
—Instead of asking for a new taxpayer sub
sidy, as his predecessor once did, Bolger de
clinedlo support a House-passed bill to give the
Postal Service $2.98 billion over the next five
years. The bill thus faces rough going in the
Senate. If a new subsidy is voted down, the
payments from tax revenue will automatically
drop under current law.
—Mail volume, an important factor in holding
down rates, continues to grow and in 1980 is
expected to exceed 100 billion pieces for the
first time. Compare that to the prediction made
by former Postmaster General Benjamin Bailar,
that the 1976 volume of 90 billion pieces "will
probably stand forever as our peak, for we pro
ject that over the next five years volume will
slump to 83 or 84 billion and never recover."
Bolger said in an interview, "We took a lot of
costs out of the mail system through job attri
tion. We increased our mechanization and de
cided we weren't going to increase our rates
until we absolutely had to. That's why our vol
ume grew."
The quality of service is harder to demonstrate
with numbers, but Bolger said the growth in

volume indicates reasonably good service.
"One of the reasons why our volume wasn't
growing was that we weren't providing a good
level of service. We would take in the mail and
then we wouldn't deliver it in a timely fashion.
Now I think we are doing better and the num
bers point that out."
Still, he admitted, "We make mistakes, some
horrible mistakes. There is reason for people to
be angry at the horror stories and even to make
jokes about us. You can't handle 100 billion
pieces of mail in a year without making mis
takes."
One big mistake occurred in New York City
the last week of October when a conveyor belt
broke down on the first day of operation at the
new Morgan mail-sorting complex. The 18-hour
breakdown, caused by an overload, delayed
millions of pieces of mail for several days.
Bolger's plans include expanded mechaniza
tion in mail handling, a step that will lead to
lengthening zip codes from five to nine digits.
The transition will come between 1981 and 1984.
Announcement of the expanded code last
year brought some criticism, but Bolger said the
longer zip code will permit quicker sorting,
which will hold down postage rates.
The changes in Postal Service performance
have made some converts. The Washington
Post, where some of the most bitter cartoons
appeared, said recently, "The Postal Service is
doing much better than most people expected a
few years ago."
And Emmet Andrews, president of the Ameri
can Postal Workers Union, who often has
criticized postal management, called publicly
for some "good-mouthing" of the Postal Ser
vice.
Problems still lieahead, including another de
ficit in 1980 as higher costs take their toll. Bolger
predicted next year's deficit at $575 million, a
figure which would pressure the agency to raise
rates.
And Bolger always expects some complaints
about delayed mail similar to that from the New
York banker.
He said the ideal situation for the Postal Ser
vice is to be taken for granted. "When we are
performing, then people accept that as the way
we should operate and we never hear from
them," he said.

Washington (AP) — A New York City banker,
frustrated by sluggish mail delivery, issued a
challenge to Postmaster General William
Bolger:
In a letter mailed to Bolger on a Friday, Robert
Landau wrote, "I'll bet you one of those new
Susan B. Anthony coins that you don't get this
letter for at least five business days."
On Monday, the next business day, Bolger
was on the phone with the letter in his hands. "Bob,
you owe me a buck," he told Landau.
