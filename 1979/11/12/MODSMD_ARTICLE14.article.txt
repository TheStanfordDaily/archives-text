# Palm Drive has historical roots

Do you ever wonder why
there are 137 palm trees lining
the entrance to the University?
Entering the campus from
either Highway 101 or El
Camino Real, one has a hard
time missing the exquisite line
of trees on both sides of the
street which designate the one
and only Palm Drive.
Looking down the Drive at
Memorial Church, the great
Quad itself, Hoover Tower,
and the Stanford Hills, many
wonder how the "Drive" and
its surroundings came to be
structured.
The overall design for the
University was first developed
by architect Frederick Law
Olmsted in 1886. The road sys
tem was then created to allow
for a unified University quar
ter, free from the invasion of
traffic, with the land assembled
in parcels that would give
maximum use to University
functions. The drive was de
signated to give access to every
part of the campus without dis
turbance of unnecessary
through traffic.
Next came the idea of plant
ing California trees to provide a
pleasant atmosphere for the
campus. In 1890, the report
that came from the Olmsted
firm suggested planting alter

nating Phoenix and
Washington palms, with low
growing plants such as heather
and ivy to be placed between
the trees.
"It would provide a variety of
foliage and flower, and yet les
sen the amount of cultivation
required," said the report.
The project was whole
heartedly approved by Mr.
Charles Lathrop, Jane Stan
ford's brother, who was an ar
chitect and then treasurer
business manager of the Uni
versity.
The walks through the trees
served as short cuts between
the various junctions of the
drives, and were used by stu

dents and the general public.
In 1905, a year before the San
Francisco earthquake, dupli
cate signs on the entrance
gates read: "The Board of Trus
tees kindly request that no
auto or gasoline bicycles tres
pass on these premises." Palm
Drive was at that time a road
designed for horse-drawn car
riages until the auto ban was
lifted in December 1914.
Also on the left gate was
carved the inscription: "Palo
Alto estate acquired 1876 by Le
land Stanford."
The lofty stone archway
erected at the entrance in 1904,
at a cost of $23,000, was similar
to the design of the familiar big

east and west arches of the
inner Quad. But it was larger
and was flanked by lesser
arches for footpassengers and
cyclists.
The earthquake destroyed
the arches, and new stone
gates were built at a cost of
$25,000 in 1931. They were tin
last replacements of the struc
tures ruined by the quake 25
years before.
The classes of 1912, 1913,
1914 and 1915 recalled the
"dismal piles of bricks and
crumbled stone" which quel
led their freshmen enthusiasm
when the old trolley took them
in the back door of the cam
pus.
