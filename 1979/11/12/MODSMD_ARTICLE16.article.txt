## Enlightenment dead end? 
### 
Dean ot the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly
and Professor ot Religious Studies William
Clehsch have confirmed what many ot us sus
pected: that Stanford taculty, by and large, re
gard religion as "something tor imbeciles, chil
dren and old women."
This is hardly surprising, given the very prag
matic institutional nature of an American uni
versity in our time. It simply doesn't pay proles
stonally to open oneself to substantive or "total "
reality.
There are "ecological" needs here, just as
there are lor any normal healthy growth: normal
people cannot afford to question the "set" ol an
era, even one — indeed especially one — that is
comin°, to a deep crisis.
As Hamerton-Kelly agrees, the 250-year
period ot the Enlightenment has run into a dead
end in our time. The totalitarian orders ol Ger
many and Russia were the main clues — they too
tell religion was only tor the imbeciles, etc.
Germany's typically stubborn "set" was stopped
by lorce majeure. Russia's goes on in a compul
sive drive to prevail with brute strength, as
Raymond Aron notes in Commentaire. Ours
goes on in a limp, muddling way with everyone
wondering.
I am not so naive as not to realize the negative
connotations of the word "religion," which got
cluttered with various dogma, tacky trappings
lor the unsophisticated, unacceptable to bright
young contemporary students. But the word is
innocent: it stems trom Latin ligere, "to bind",
i.e. a sense of totality, without which one builds
on mush.
Camus, who gave a classic analysis ol the bank
ruptcy ot "horizontal religion" in The Rebel,
s.iw that only the infinite transcendental axis ot
the "vertical" could check or balance out the

crazily runaway transcendence ot the "horizon
tal," the Enlightment aim to establish heaven on
this earth lor everybody (Jeremy Bentham's
"greatest need lor the greatest number," tor
example).
Camus coyly ottered the word "sacred" as
substitute (though he was honest enough to say
id an interviewer "The anti-religious attitude is
vulgar").
1 nis never got through to the academic world,
desperately lixed in its dying epistene. With
the ever-handy "ecological" device of blinking,
they tailed to notice that our very finest modern
thinkers professed belief. Here is a partial list:
Proust: "the divine world to which (the artist)
has access (.Swamm's Way);"
Einstein: "Science without religion is lame;"
Malraux: "The 21st century will be religious or
won't exist."
Our tinest novelists, Updike (Lutheran), Bel
low (Jewish), Malamud (likewise) are pious;
Daniel Bell, in The Cultural Contradictions ol
Capitalism, Irving Kristol, sees a profound need
lor moral regeneration in America, based on
belie!. Apparently Bob Dylan has recently seen
this light.
And indeed, it Joseph Kralt is right that in the
lace ot tantastic competitive gains by Japan and
Germany and Taiwan and millions ot disciplined
workers around the globe we are sunk without
we ought to recall that the
very work-ethic which made America great was
grounded in an existentially vivacious torm ol
Protestantism.
Or il it is the humanitarian aspect ot goodness
that impresses young people, one doubts that
dry — and rather selfish — cults such as con
sumerism and/or libertarianism will inspire
many Sister Teresas.
