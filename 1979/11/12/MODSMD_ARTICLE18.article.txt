## Analyze abortion issue rationally 
### 
The issue of abortion is one
of the most sensitive and dif
ticulf-to-resolve issues humans
face. )ennifer Hirsch's column
[Daily, Nov. 4) does very little
to either illuminate or resolve
the problem.
Her first point relates to a
very important issue — public
funding of (what some con
sider) murder. Hirsch asks,
what about tax money paying
for food, lodging and medical
care for Charles Manson? It is
hard to take this bit ot twisted
logic seriously, but I will dis
cuss all three of her points,
however irrational.
There is no justification for
the analogy between publicly

funded murder and publicly
funded Incarceration. The al
ternatives to incarceration are
1) setting Manson tree or 2)
putting him to death. The
former is called anarchy and
the latter is called capital
punishment. The death pen
alty would in fact have served
Hirsch better as an analogy.
Because there is disagree
ment about when a human
being is fully created and en
dowed with its "inalienable
rights," and because this con
sideration touches the very
roots of personal
philosophies, insensitive
treatment of the "murder"
issue like Hirsch's is unfortu
nate. Many people are very

concerned about taking inno
cent human lives in abortion.
Fallacious analogies to Charles
Manson serve only to muddle
the issue.
Hirsch's second point ad
dresses the father's role in
conception and abortion. Her
challenge presumes and im
plies that men are not willing
"to devote fhe next 20 years of
(their) life to raising that child"
which results from an acciden
tal pregnancy. I am quite cer
tain that some men (at least)
teel as responsible for concep
tion as the women partners
and are willing to perform
whatever duties the birth and
raising of a child require. As it
happens, men are very often
denied this opportunity.
The truth is that during the
nine months of pregnancv and
several hours of birth, biologi
cal responsibilities of the two
parents are very unequal. But
biological role division is a
blessing and a curse for both
sexes. Do not judge hastily the
attitudes of fathers. By all
means, do not presume they
are all the same.
Hirsch's third and last point
is that "no woman wants to go
through an abortion!" With
this statement I must deal deli
cately. I do not underestimate
the trauma of abortion, but to
make such a generalization
about all women is unwar
ranted. Hirsch goes on to say
that "any method of con
traception — including celi
bacy — is more desirable to a
woman than abortion."
It is clear that a large number
of women who have abortions
have already willingly rejected
the celibacy alternative. (I am
allowing for cases of unwillful
sexual activity.) I do not believe
that all women would prefer
lifelong celibacy to the abor
tion of an accidental pre
gnancy.
When pregnancy is consi
dered a risk rather than a de
sired outcome, human motiva
tion for behavior is at odds with

biological result. Sex is recrea
tional for many, conception
the calculated risk. For many
people in this situation, abor
tion is the solution-in-waiting.
Furthermore, remorse tor an
action does not justify the ac
tion. The argument that be
cause abortion is traumatic,
any woman who goes through
one must have an unchal
lengeable reason, is fallacious.
The issue, however, of
trauma is important. Unfortu
nately, I am unqualified to deal
with the psychology of abor
tion, so I must deal with
Hirsch's statement primarily
on logical grounds.
The issue ot abortion is dif
ficult to resolve, but an impor
tant step is a reduction in acci
dental or unwanted pregnan
cy. I am aware that contracep
tion short ot sterility only ap
proaches 100 percent, but ac
cidental pregnancies will be
reduced it sex is practiced more
responsibly, this requires bet
ter education now and a con
tinuing ettort to understand
human sexuality.
Generalizations about all
members of the male or female
sex must come to a stop. They
are harmful to individuals and
lead us astray. A subpoint is
that perceptions of Stanford
men'and women must not be
extended to the American or
human populations.
Finally, simplistic statements
concerning the abortion issue
are misleading and often with
out proven basis. Phrases like
"a woman's right to choice"
and "murder of the unborn
child" obscure the com
plexities of the situation.
Let it be clear that my attack
on Hirsch's column is against
her arguments, and not neces
sarily her sentiments. She
raised important issues, but
muddled them with faulty
reasoning. "Abortion" is too
critical a topic to be handled
frivolously.

tal pregnancy. I am quite cer
tain that some men (at least)
teel as responsible for concep
tion as the women partners
and are willing to perform
whatever duties the birth and
raising of a child require. As it
happens, men are very often
denied this opportunity.
The truth is that during the
nine months of pregnancv and
several hours of birth, biologi
cal responsibilities of the two
parents are very unequal. But
biological role division is a
blessing and a curse for both
sexes. Do not judge hastily the
attitudes of fathers. By all
means, do not presume they
are all the same.
Hirsch's third and last point
is that "no woman wants to go
through an abortion!" With
this statement I must deal deli
cately. I do not underestimate
the trauma of abortion, but to
make such a generalization
about all women is unwar
ranted. Hirsch goes on to say
that "any method of con
traception — including celi
bacy — is more desirable to a
woman than abortion."
It is clear that a large number
of women who have abortions
have already willingly rejected
the celibacy alternative. (I am
allowing for cases of unwillful
sexual activity.) I do not believe
that all women would prefer
lifelong celibacy to the abor
tion of an accidental pre
gnancy.
When pregnancy is consi
dered a risk rather than a de
sired outcome, human motiva
tion for behavior is at odds with

biological result. Sex is recrea
tional for many, conception
the calculated risk. For many
people in this situation, abor
tion is the solution-in-waiting.
Furthermore, remorse tor an
action does not justify the ac
tion. The argument that be
cause abortion is traumatic,
any woman who goes through
one must have an unchal
lengeable reason, is fallacious.
The issue, however, of
trauma is important. Unfortu
nately, I am unqualified to deal
with the psychology of abor
tion, so I must deal with
Hirsch's statement primarily
on logical grounds.
The issue ot abortion is dif
ficult to resolve, but an impor
tant step is a reduction in acci
dental or unwanted pregnan
cy. I am aware that contracep
tion short ot sterility only ap
proaches 100 percent, but ac
cidental pregnancies will be
reduced it sex is practiced more
responsibly, this requires bet
ter education now and a con
tinuing ettort to understand
human sexuality.
Generalizations about all
members of the male or female
sex must come to a stop. They
are harmful to individuals and
lead us astray. A subpoint is
that perceptions of Stanford
men'and women must not be
extended to the American or
human populations.
Finally, simplistic statements
concerning the abortion issue
are misleading and often with
out proven basis. Phrases like
"a woman's right to choice"
and "murder of the unborn
child" obscure the com
plexities of the situation.
Let it be clear that my attack
on Hirsch's column is against
her arguments, and not neces
sarily her sentiments. She
raised important issues, but
muddled them with faulty
reasoning. "Abortion" is too
critical a topic to be handled
frivolously.

majoring in human biology and
psychology.)
The issue of abortion is one
of the most sensitive and dif
ticulf-to-resolve issues humans
face. )ennifer Hirsch's column
[Daily, Nov. 4) does very little
to either illuminate or resolve
the problem.
Her first point relates to a
very important issue — public
funding of (what some con
sider) murder. Hirsch asks,
what about tax money paying
for food, lodging and medical
care for Charles Manson? It is
hard to take this bit ot twisted
logic seriously, but I will dis
cuss all three of her points,
however irrational.
There is no justification for
the analogy between publicly

funded murder and publicly
funded Incarceration. The al
ternatives to incarceration are
1) setting Manson tree or 2)
putting him to death. The
former is called anarchy and
the latter is called capital
punishment. The death pen
alty would in fact have served
Hirsch better as an analogy.
Because there is disagree
ment about when a human
being is fully created and en
dowed with its "inalienable
rights," and because this con
sideration touches the very
roots of personal
philosophies, insensitive
treatment of the "murder"
issue like Hirsch's is unfortu
nate. Many people are very

concerned about taking inno
cent human lives in abortion.
Fallacious analogies to Charles
Manson serve only to muddle
the issue.
Hirsch's second point ad
dresses the father's role in
conception and abortion. Her
challenge presumes and im
plies that men are not willing
"to devote fhe next 20 years of
(their) life to raising that child"
which results from an acciden
tal pregnancy. I am quite cer
tain that some men (at least)
teel as responsible for concep
tion as the women partners
and are willing to perform
whatever duties the birth and
raising of a child require. As it
