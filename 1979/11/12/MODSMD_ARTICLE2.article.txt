# Unneeded X-ray requests closely watched

In light ot the increasing aware
ness oi the potential dangers of radi
ation, otticials at the University Hos
pital are attempting to reduce the
number ol nonessential x-ray exami
nations administered here. Efforts
are being made to educate both
physicians and patients on the risks
incurred through exposure to exces
sive doses ol x-rays.
The continued evaluation ol x-ray
procedures here has resulted in the
elimination ol standing orders lor
chest x-rays, according to Dr. Roland
Finston, director ol health physics at
the Hospital. Skin tests have re
placed chest x-rays in Hospital per
sonnel tuberculosis tests, and the

stall is endeavoring to dispense with
unnecessary skull x-rays in the
emergency room, he said.
Studies conducted by the Hospital
and by the U.S. Department ot
Health, Education and Wellare
(HEW) have revealed that about a
third ol the x-ray examinations or
dered here and across the nation are
not medically mandated.
The elimination of such superflu
ous examinations could result in sav
ings ol about $2 billion annually, the
HEW survey estimated.
"But what is of even more impor
tance is the effect of excessive radia
tion, not only to the person who is
gelling the x-ray, but to the popula
tion as a whole," said Dr. Michael

Eliastam, director ot the Hospital
emergency room services.
Shorl-run convenience
"It's much easier to get an x-ray in
the short run, but in the long run
you're laced with greater incidences
o' leukemia and other malignan
cies," he explained.
"I think that people are more
aware ot the risks which accompany
radiation, and we're doing what we
can to educate both the consumer
and the physician on the subject,"
Hnston said.
Both Eliastam and Dr. Henry )ones,
Hospital radiologist, said they have
encouraged doctors at the Hospital
to carelully examine the conditions
under which they order x-rays.
Vet, "We really don't know il
they're cutting down, though,"
)ones admitted. "I'm not sure it
we've been successlul in our at
tempts toget the doctors tocut down
on the number ot x-rays they order.
Our ettorts may have had little etiect
on the situation," he said.
Reasons for excess
Unnecessary x-rays are caused by
three lactors, Eliastam said.
first, the doctors "don't always
think," (ones said. "They have
lormed the habit ol ordering x-rays
without tirst examining alternatives.
Eliastam stressed that this attitude is
becoming less prevalent among
physicians because ol their in
creased awareness ot the cancerous
ettects ot x-rays.
Another cause ol the overuse ol
x-rays is "patient pressure," (ones
said. "People are tascinated with
x-rays and often just expect to net
x-rayed."
The third contributing tactor lies in
the medical/legal aspect ol the pro
cedures. The doctors must consider
the threat ot malpractice suits, Elias
tam said. "It the patient sues, the
courts usually ask to see the x-rays,
and, il the doctors can't produce
them, he gets nailed with a malprac
tice suit," he said.

Hnston's department is also in
charge ol checking the x-ray equip
ment at the Cowell Student Health
Center and at the Hospital to ensure
that the equipment is delivering the
correct amount ot radiation tor each
setting.
Cowell problem unique
Because Cowell administers tree
x-rays to injured students, no
economic disincentive exists to dis
courage x-ray orders.
"We rely on a philosophy rather
than a policy," Dr. lames McClena
han, director ot Cowell said. "We
rely on the individual physician to
exercise a responsible clinical
judgement. We hope that it the pa
tient is reasonably skeptical about
getting an x-ray and the physician is
reasonably aware ot the risks in
volved, we'll avoid administering
unnecessary x-ray examinations,"
McClenahan said.
McClenahan emphasized that
Cowell physicians maintain a
philosophy ot avoiding unnecessary
x-rays. "I suppose we could run
some kind ot a spot-check on the
physicians to see that they're tollow
ing this philosophy, but you can't re
ally have a set policy because every
case is dilterent and requires indi
vidual examination."
Latent illness
HEW studies have revealed that
small exposures to radiation do in
deed increase the likelihood ol de
veloping cancer ol the blood cells or
other tissues.
"In recent years we have become
aware that there is an increased inci
dence ol cancer in the later life ol
individuals who have received radia
tion as children or before birth,"
lones said.
It is jI so clear that exposure ol the
embryo and the tetus to radiation
raises the incidence ot cancer, he
said. Genetic damage can occur
when the ovaries ot women and the
testes ol men are exposed to radia
