# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mike Charlson Wells Fargo stages student ripoff 
### 
Over a beer one afternoon
some time ago, Tresidder Di
rector Dan Williams and I were
discussing why Wells Fargo, ot
all the banks around, was cho
sen to occupy the second floor
of the Union. Basically he told
me it was selected because,
based on the banks' applica
tions for occupancy, it ap
peared Wells Fargo would
offer students the most ser
vices at the best prices.
I kept remembering that
conversation as I read and re
read the note enclosed in my
most recent Wells Fargo Bank
checking account statement.
You all read it, I'm sure. It was
the one which announced that
$1 per month isn't enough to
charge you tor having the
privilege ot using your money.
Instead, the new rate is to be Si
per month tor the tirst 10
checks plus 20 cents per check
lor additional dratts.
I also remembered the vari
ous times that bank had
screwed up accounts tor me
which I had had no trouble

keeping straight. And I began
to get disgusted.
Then I remembered the way
I went to the bank to point out
their error, but because ot
their very convenient lobby
operation hours (10 a.m. to 3
p.m.), they were closed.
Then it occurred to me that
this increase was made eltec
tive Nov. 1 — only weeks alter
hundreds, nay thousands, ol
new college students
statewide opened accounts
with Wells Fargo under the as
sumption they would get unli
mited checking lor $1 per
month. Bait and switch crossed
my mind. And my disgust be
came anger.
So I made some calls.
It seems that Bank of
America, in the Stanford
Shopping Center, has straight
$9 per year student checking
accounts, just like the lormer
Wells Fargo accounts. Addi
tional charges are tor special
check printing (their standard
"blue" checks are tree) and
overdrafts — the normal stuff.
In addition, they have a new
day/night teller machine which
allows people to get money
trom B a.m. to midnight. Quite
a contrast to the "4:30-or-go
broke" policy at Wells Fargo.
Then I called Crocker Bank,

also in the Stantord Shopping
Center. They charge a n. 56
per year, payable in advance,
so itcan'f rise lor at least a year.
They also have the day/night
machine, and theirs stays open
until 1 a.m. That's on top ot
longer hours at the bank every
day.
Then I called the Stantord
Federal Credit Union. There
are some special membership
requirements, but I qualified.
It you quality, they charge only
for printing ol checks. And
they pay 6.5 percent interest on
the checking account. All you
need is $5 (that's right five dol
lars) in your savings account at
all times. And they are open
even more often.
So I tigured, it Wells Fargo is
willing to let me have Master
Charge and let me cash checks
ot up to $50 with a student ID
(any student can), then why am
I letting them charge me six
times what Crocker charges
(based on my normal 20 checks
per months) while they offer
less service?
And why should I let Wells
Fargo take my money, make
money from it, and charge me
to use it when the credit union
will pay me for use of my
money? Well, frankly, there is
no reason in the world.

So, Economics Prof. Pete
Hammond and the theorie;
about consumer demanc
which he is trying to teach mt
are at least partially correct,
took the money and gave it tc
the credit union.
And if I find the 5-minutt
bike ride a pain, I'll remember
the $JO-plus per year I'm not
paying Wells Fargo. And I'll
remember that I can ride there
until 5: JO p.m. and still transact
business. And if that's not
enough, I'll lollow Crocker's
advice, give them some'busi
ness, and get myself a day/
night tellercard to boot so I can
get my bucks when I want
them.
It was so nice. The account
representative at the credit
union was courteous, and she
seemed genuinely interested
in serving me. What a change
trom the all-too-common
"what favor may I grant you to
day?" teeling I have become
unpleasantly accustomed to
with service businesses over
the past tew years.
So save your money. Bank
with someone else. It's simple:
Wells Fargo had a legend to live
up to . . . but it died.
