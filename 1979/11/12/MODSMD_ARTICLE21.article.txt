## The 						Ted who would be king 
### 
There are those who say that the most
dangerous man in America is John Connally,
and there are those who say that it is Ted Ken
nedy. It is a close call. Each is endowed with a
princely demeanor, an impelling, stentorian
voice, leonine good looks and questionable
personal integrity. It there are possible limits to
the exercise of power and authority neither has
uttered a word as to what these might be. Both
seek to gain the Presidency by convincing us we
need their "leadership."
But leadership isn't a virtue sense ot
direction. The most atrocious crimes in history
were all the work of great leaders. IHs not for
their leadership, but rather their enduring le
gacy of political principles that we owe a debt of
gratitude to the Founding Fathers. But what on
earth are the principles of men like Teddy and
John, and where would they be likely to lead us?
In foreign affairs, Connally has made clear his
intention to steer the ship of state rightwards,
full steam ahead, on the stormy seas of jingoism.
This, in my mind, would make him the more
dangerous man in the Presidency. Fortunately,
however, he has failed to find a political consti
tuency for himself, so the danger of his election
seems remote.
The same, however, cannot be said of Teddy.
Not only is he the solid favorite of the polls; he is
also apparently so far the only candidate with an
organization at Stanford.
There is something frightening about listen
ing to otherwise intelligent liberals ballyhoo
Kennedy's "leadership." After all, it was not so
many years ago that they were decrying LB]'s
"arrogance of power" and Richard Nixon's "im
perial Presidency." Yet Nixon at least had the
merit of hiring a staff that was not above turning
state's evidence for the Watergate prosecution.
The frightening thing about Chappaquiddick
was not the accident, but the monolithic
stonewall of silence maintained by the Kennedy

crew.
Likewise, on Capitol Hill the Kennedy staff are
renowned for their loyal and aggressive pursuit
of whatever political necessity dictates to en
hance the power of their boss.
This tendency to gather and concentrate
strings of political power from everv conceiva
ble direction into the hands of a central author
ity is a hallmark of Kennedy legislation.
Whenever it is a question between more gov
ernment power or less, more centralized federal
authority or less, more spending or less, more
bureaucracy or less, Teddy's instincts seem to
reliably dispose him towards "more."
Thus his support tor mandatory national
youth service, mandatory universal health in
surance, broader and stronger law entorcement
authority and economic controls of every de
scription.
Recently, Kennedy has shown signs ot mo
derating his stance by backing such measures as
airline and trucking deregulation. This is a hope
tul sign, and it he is willing to follow up on it with
a thoughtful reassessment ot other liberal
policies, e.g., busing or price controls, he might
just prove to be the man ot the hour.
It not, however, he runs a very real risk ot
political disaster. The nation has changed since
the days ot the New Frontier. There are tar more
diverse and potentially rebellious interest
groups to deal with. It is doubtful that Teddy
appreciates the extent to which government
controls could be dystunctional under these cir
cumstances.
Any serious attempt to impose and enforce
wage and price controls, or to ration gasoline
could lead to a popular resistance that would
spark political dynamite. Given Teddy's record,
this is not an unlikely scenario. If so, he is lead
ing his troops not to Camelot, but to Waterloo.

a thoughtful reassessment ot other liberal
policies, e.g., busing or price controls, he might
just prove to be the man ot the hour.
It not, however, he runs a very real risk ot
political disaster. The nation has changed since
the days ot the New Frontier. There are tar more
diverse and potentially rebellious interest
groups to deal with. It is doubtful that Teddy
appreciates the extent to which government
controls could be dystunctional under these cir
cumstances.
Any serious attempt to impose and enforce
wage and price controls, or to ration gasoline
could lead to a popular resistance that would
spark political dynamite. Given Teddy's record,
this is not an unlikely scenario. If so, he is lead
ing his troops not to Camelot, but to Waterloo.
