Union deserved
Mildred Nilsson's (Daily,
Nov. 5) serene, even uncon
cerned, acceptance of the loss
of her job last summer would
lead one to believe that she
must have other sources of in
come; in any case, I hope that
clerical workers at Stanford are
unimpressed with her anti
union arguments.
Why should they stick their
necks out, why risk job and in
come, why, indeed, earn the
scorn of fellow-workers like
Nilsson, by their attempt to or
ganize an effective bargaining
unit in United Stanford
Employees?
The answer lies in a grim real
ity which no amount of clever
public relations propaganda
can disguise: a university is no
different from any other busi
ness enterprise in trying to
keep costs, especially wages,
to a minimum.
Stanford's administration
will feel no need to consider
the demands of the office staff
until compelled to do so. Col
lective bargaining, the process
which will substantially im
prove salary levels and work
conditions, can result only
from the formation of a strong
union.
Nilsson refers obliquely to
the economic suffering, in a
time of runaway inflation, en
dured by "the lowliest
worker." A considerable frac
tion of Stanford's clerical

workers fall into that unpleas
ant category, and these unfor
tunate and harassed drudges
can hardly share her en
thusiasm for Stanford's
laissez-faire attitude to their
workloads and pay.
The resentment that these
people feel over long hours
and low pay is justified if one
refers to comparable wages
and hours ot workers who are
protected by a union, e.g., the
Service Employees (SEIU.)
I hope that Stanford's office
staff will ignore the deplorable
example of the Mildred
Nilssons here and elsewhere
whose loyalty to institutions
which sweat their unorganized
workforce is difficult to under
stand. Stanford's office work
ers need and deserve union
representation.
Power to the Persons!

Bridge 'nonsense'
Why is the Director ot Stu
dent Activities, Thom Massey,
picking on the Bridge? What
can possibly be gained by wast
ing so much time and energy
pursuing a dead issue? There
are currently no other Stanford
counseling groups wanting
Bridge space. There are no
other groups requesting live
ins at their own offices. So why
this relentless attack on the
Bridge statters?
The general consensus
seems to be that the live-in st.it

lers make the Bridge. They run
it ettectively, efficiently and,
by the way, solidly in the black.
Something even the Sunday
Micks can't do. So why throw
obstacles in tront ot a success
tul, enterprising group? There
is clearly nothing to be gained
by eliminating the live-ins.
There is a great possibility ot
ruinihg the Bridge it they are.
Massey has been threaten
ing the Bridge since last spring.
This is too long to keep a group
ot people in jeopardy. It he had
a solid case, obviqusly, it
would have been resolved by
now. The time has come to
shelve this "issue" and move
on to, hopefully, more impor
tant things.
Let's put pride aside, admit
that the live-in statters are in
lact "The Bridge," and put an
end to this wasteful nonsense.
Then we can move on to the
really important issues con
fronting us, like choosing a
mascot.
