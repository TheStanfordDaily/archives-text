# Office works to influence policy

The broad scope of the Uni
versity may make it seem like
an entity in itself, but its far
reaching interests leave it sub
ject to government officials in
both Sacramento and
Washington. In order to pro
tect those interests, the Office
of Public Affairs, headed by
Vice President Robert
Rosenzweig, works to monitor
and influence new legislation
that might affect the Univer
sity.
The ottice considers several
thousand bills each year con
cerning a wide scope ot topics
besides educational policy.
Most are at the state level.
About half these bills deal
with health and land policy
which are relevant because the
University owns a hospital and
is one of the largest land own
ers in California.
Much of the University's
ability to influence the lawmak
ing process stems from collab
oration with other institutions
with similar interests, said Di
rector of Government Rela
tions Larry Horton. There is
very close cooperation with
University of Southern
Calitornia, California Institute
of Technology and particularly
UC-Berkeley in analyzing and
dealing with bills on the state
level, he added.
The University is also a prom
inent member of special
interest groups such as the
American Council on Educa
tion, the Association of Ameri
can Universities and the
California Association ot Inde
pendent Colleges and Univer
sities.
Rosenzweig explained that
testimony in Congress isn't
necessarily influential. "The
impact of a testimony is deter

mined by the nature of the bill
and the number of legislators
listening to the speaker," he
said.
The University does not
employ professional lobbyists,
but occasionally will send a
representative to speak before
Congress. Last April, President
Richard Lyman argued against
President jimmy Carter's
proposal for a Department of
Education.
It is particularly important to
present cases in the California
Legislature where more than

half of the bills introduced
eventually pass, Horton said.
"Most bills go through both
houses without ever meeting
opposition, so by being there
and explaining our position we
can produce virtually a 100 per
cent success rate in killing a
bill," he said.
"A valid case (presented in
the Legislature) is almost al
ways influential," said Horton.
Simply making the University's
position known is more impor
tant than giving testimony on
the floor or in committee.
