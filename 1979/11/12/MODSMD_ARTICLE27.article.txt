# Ducks goose the Cards out of the bowl picture, 76-7
## Oregon beats favored Stanford but it was no upset 
### Ivan Maisel 
The Oregon Ducks out
played, out-emotioned, out
coached and ultimately out
scored Stanford Saturday, and
as a result knocked the Cardi
nals out of a bowl.
The final tally was only 16-7,
but as is often the case with
scoreboards, that does not
adequately convey the rout
that took place on a sunny,
perfect-for-football November
afternoon at Stanford Stadium.
Only five Oregon turnovers,
all of them inside the Stanford
23-yard line and three inside
the 5, prevented the Ducks
from turning an artificially
close game into a runaway.
While the turnovers were a
sign of the immaturity of head
coach Rich Brooks' program, a
more important sign was the
win itself: the 48-year-old has
turned the program around in
h.s almost three years as the
head coach.
"I don't believe our players
were going to be denied this
win," Brooks said, leaning
back in his chair and looking as if
he had just heard from Dean
Witter. "They threw intercep
tions, fumbled and screwed
up, and they'd come back. I go
back to a year ago to show how
this team has really matured."
Brooks has turned a 2-9 team
a year ago into a 5-4 team this
year, and two of those losses,
to Washington and Purdue,
came late in the game. With
their remaining games against
UCLA and Oregon State both
at home, the Ducks have an ex
cellent chance of posting their
tirst winning season since 1970.
They took a giant step to
wards that winning season with
their performance Saturday.
Opposing coaches have often
said the best way to stop the
Stanford offense is not to let
them have the ball.
Oregon followed those in
struction exactly, swallowing
up over 36 minutes of the clock
with a running offense charac
terized by deft ball-handling, a

forward shovel pitch designed
especially for Stanford and
quarterback Reggie Ogburn.
I he junior college transfer,
whom Brooks has said "can
generate the spark to put the
points on the board," was out
standing Saturday, running the
option effectively all day long
to the bewilderment of the
Stanford defense.
"I feel like I can go against
anybody," Ogburn said after
the game. "We were control
ling the ball very well. They
(the Stanford defense) would
stagger out then I would react
off their movement."
Running quarterbacks have
given Stanford fits all season
and Ogburn is among the best.
But it was not just Ogburn;
running a lot of draws, delays
and option pitches, tailback
Dwight Robertson broke loose
for 138 yards and one
touchdown.
But the Stanford defense did
not have a terrible game. As
against Oregon State, they
played too much. When it
came time to suck up their gut
and make the big play, they
were too tired.
"We missed tackles, but the
defense was just out on the
field too long. Our inside
linebackers were just dead
tired,' said Stanford head
coach Rod Dowhower. "They
had the ball a lot. Oregon had a
heckuva game plan."
And Stanford did not. The
total statistics bore a striking
resemblance to the early
season losses Stanford suf
fered. The Cards ran lor 187
yards — and passed for only 55.
True, the offense did not have
the ball very often (only four
times in the second half), but
when they did, they did not
pass. The Cards ran the ball 40
times and threw it only 13 —
the least amount of passes this
year.
"We could have thrown the
ball every single down," an
angry, frustrated Ken
Margerum said. "They weren't

doing anything we didn't ex
pect."
The biggest blow the offense
suffered was the blow Stanford
quarterback Turk Schonert suf
fered at some point in the first
quarter. No one knows when
— but it gave Schonert a mild
concussion and was responsi
ble tor his inconsistent play in
the first half.
"I was scrambling and I got
hit in the head in the first quar
ter," Schonert, seemingly back
to normal after the game, said.
"I don't remember a lot of
things in the first half."
Schonert knew he was wob
bly but felt he could maintain
the same level of performance
as usual. When it became ob
vious he could not, the doctors
took a close look at him at
halftime. They decided to pull
him for the remainder ot the
game.
"I could call the plays in my
sleep. I could drop back fine,
but you have to read things
(the defense.) It was kind of
blurry and I just didn't feel
right, he said.
"The coaches asked me if I
could play and I told them
'yes', but my body felt weak. I
wasn't putting anything on the
ball and I was throwing oft my
back foot," Schonert added.
Schonert was clearly not
himself in the first half, over
throwing receivers several
times. He finished at halftime
with four completions in nine
attempts for 45 yards and one
touchdown, a bullet over the
middle to Ken Margerum tor2o
yards in the second quarter. •
"If was an audible," the
quarterback said. "We had a
running play on but they had
'man' coverage on Kenny.
Their iree safety came up to
play our halfback and that left
the middle wide open."
That was the only bright spot
in the day's affairs, tying the
score at 7-7 tor a brief time.
Oregon scored on the first
series they had the ball, going
87 yards in six plays and show

ing the Stanford defense more
razzle-dazzle than the Harlem
Globetrotters.
The touchdown came on a
fake reverse that had everyone
in the stadium fooled except
for Rich Brooks. Ogburn
handed off to Robertson as the
tailback ran left. Wide receiver
Don Coleman ran towards
Robertson and the whole
stadium yelled "Reverse."
As Stanford turned its defen
sive pursuit towards Coleman,
Robertson kept the ball at his
left hip and sped 48 yards for
the score. Stanford cornerback
Rick Parker was the only one on
the left side of the field, but he
was swarmed under by three
Oregon blockers.
Four Oregon drives ended in
frustration tor the Ducks in the
tirst half, two on diving inter
ceptions by cornerback Rick
Gervais inside the five on the
same play call.
Another ended with
linebacker Milt McColl recov
ering a Reggie Young tumble at
(he Stanford 23 and the fourth
with Doug Jollymour badly
missing a 42-yard field goal at
tempt.
jollymour got a chance to
redeem himself with ten sec
onds left in the half. After Ger
vais' second interception, this
one at the Stanford 12 with 2:30
left, Stanford gave the ball right
back when halfback Mike Dot
terer completed a slashing 14-
yard run up the middle with a
tumble.
Oregon's Mike Kesler reco
vered and the Ducks drove
from the 23 to the 8, when lol
ly mcj u r connected on a 25-
yarder to put the Ducks ahead
10-7 at intermission.
That was all the points the
visitors' needed. Their ball
control offense limited the
Cardinals' toonly nine minutes
ot posesston in the second
hall. Out of that Stanford mus
tered one serious attempt at
going ahead as the third quar
ter wound down.


Leaping backward for a John Elway pass, Ken Margerum is perfectly
horizontal as he makes his 35th reception of the season. Earlier, the
Ail-American candidate caught his I<)th touchdown pass of his

career, thus breaking the Stanford record held by Tony Hill and
providing Stanford fans a bright spot in an otherwide dreary 16-7 loss
to Oregon.

Oregon quarterback Reggie Ogburn's quick feet and marvelous taking ability were two reasons why
the Oregon offense baffled the Stanford defense. The junior college transfer rushed for 74 yards Saturday
in the Ducks' 16-7 win.
