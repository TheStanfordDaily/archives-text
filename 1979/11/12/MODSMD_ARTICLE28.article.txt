## It's a consensus: Big Game becomes a bowl game 
### Peter finch 
There was a strange quality
about the dressing room
atter Saturday's game. No one
was throwing helmets and no
one was kicking lockers.
There were a lot ot angry
men, but instead of reacting
violently to their loss, they
spokequietly, reflectingon the
season.
"Man, that was a hard to one
to lose," senior Gordon Banks
lamented. "We've had the po
tential to be outstanding all
year. There have only been a
tew points t hat we really played
bad, and we've gotten no
breaks. What are we now,
5-4-1 i That stinks."
According to Banks, the
Cardinals may have underrated
Oregon.
"It's not that we weren't up
lor the game, or we weren't
prepared. We just made some
crucial mistakes," he
explained.
Now that the possibility oi a
trip to a post-season bowl
game has disappeared, one
might wonder how Stanford
will feel going into the Big
Game this week.

"This Big Game will mean as
much to me as any game I've
ever played here," senior de
fensive tackle Chuck Evans
said. "It's my last game, hell, it
means as much to me as the Rose
Bowl, I guess."
"I thought the defense
played pretty well today,"
Evans continued. "You give up
just 1(j points and lose, I don't
know. . . I'm still very optimis
tic and I'm ready for Cal."
Dropping clown on a bench,
linebac ker Milt McColl called
to no one in particular. "Life
goes on," he said.
"Yes, life goes on,"
answered another linebacker,
Terry Rennaker.
"With all the tradition in my
tamily, there's always a lot ex
citement about the Big Game.
And that's a lot of Inn," Mc Coll
said. "There's something
about playing Cal that is very
exciting. We're going out there
to win."
like nearly all of the Stantord
players, McColl was perplexed
by his team's inability to beat
teams like Oregon.
"Why can't we do that? I
don't know, it stumps every

body," he said. "I think we're
very conscious ol it, but it still
happens."
Senior defensive back Kick
I'arker undressed slowly and
spoke quietly about the season
and his career at Stanford.
"I would have loved to be in
a position where it we beat Cal
we would go somewhere," lie
said. "I feel like next week will
be the last game I ever play. I
just want to get out there and
win.
"I don't think I would have
wanted to play anywhere else.
I've really had a great time
here. Oh, it's been a disap
pointing senior year overall,
but I guess that's what college
football is all about."
A tired-looking Turk
Schonert stood surrounded by
reporters, explaining the day's
loss.
"It's so frustrating to play so
well against the good teams,
and then to lose today," he
said. "Oregon was a good
team. They were much better
than OSU and Army. But we're
still better. Next week a great
deal depends on emotion.
