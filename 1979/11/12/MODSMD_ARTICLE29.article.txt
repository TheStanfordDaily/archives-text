Although the meet held at

Saturday was officially billed as
the Pacilic-10 Conterence and
NCAA District Eight Champ
ionships, the lestive atmos
phere provided by the Band

might have made "Celebrity
Cross Country" seem like a
more appropriate title.
Gray skies and a soggy
course set the conditions lor
the 10,000-meter spectacle in
which Stanlord battled to
ai hieve lourth place in the Dis
trict Eight standings and tilth

position in the Pac-10.

while UCLA snatched there

maining qualifying berth for
the finals with a 99-point,
third-place finish.

the race, paced his way
through the human tunnel
formed at the finish line to a
new course record time of
29:07.2, erasing his 1976 mark

of 29:18.6.
The native Kenyan, sur
rounded by autograph seekers
and flashing cameras, re

when questioned about the
race. He was shortly led away
by his coaches to the safety of
an awaiting vehicle.
Defending NCAA champ Al
berto Salazar of Oregon ran
under the old course record
tor second place at 29:14.9,
while Arizona's Thom Hunt
secured third with a 30:10.3
timing. Steve Ortiz ot UCLA
took fourth with a time of
30:29.3.
Veteran Roy Kissin led the
Cardinal harriers with an
11th-place finish at 31:03.6
from the field ol 106 runners.
"I was shocked that I did that
well," commented the senior,
explaining, "I knew I was on a
good one. I felt good about
doing the most that I could."
Kissin will join Hunt, Bill
Stolp ol Washington and Tim
Holmes of Fresno State in the
NCAA finals at Lehigh Univer
sity on November 19th.
Freshman Bill Graham was the

scoring were senior Bill
Haldeman at 30th with a
31:55.4 clocking, sophomore
Rod Berry at 35th with a time of
32:04.9 and senior Craig Corey
following at 36th with a 32:09.4
time. Freshman Mike Melen
dez finished 42nd in 32:20.3
but did not score.
Berry, one of the squad's
stalwarts, suffered a case of
tood poisoning Thursday that
plagued him in the race. "I
wasn't feeling too hot," he
explained, indicating that his
performance was hindered.
Head coach Dean Clark
acknowledged, "To be truth
ful, we're disappointed but we
don't want to make excuses,"
referring to Berry's condition.
"They (Stanford) ran hard
and strong and good as a
pack," he continued, noting
that the team adhered to the
strategy of keeping together in
the race.
"I am extremely pleased with
the way they've run all year,"
Clark said of the Cards, who
ran their last meet. "It was a
group that worked hard all year
— they're together physically
and in spirit."
