### Joan O'Connell 
Last Friday's meeting between
University President Richard Lyman
and fimm Williams (Chiel lighttoot)
was "inconclusive," according to
Williams, and produced no apparent
change in the administration's posi
tion regarding the mascot issue.
Williams personilied the Stanlord
mascot s "Prince Light toot " irom
1951 through 1972. In 1972 the Indian
was abolished as the symbol ol the
University following the protest ol
native American students on cam
pus.
Williams, who now calls himself
"Chiet I ighttoot," initiated the meet
ing with Lyman to discuss the possi
bility ol reinstating the Indian as the
University's symbol.
Lyman told listeners ol last Thurs
day's Campus Conference on K/SU
that any attempt to restore the Indian
as the University symbol is a "non
negotiable issue as lar as I'm con
cerned."
Robert Rosen/weig, vice

president ol public ailairs, also at
tended the halt-hour meeting and
told reporters atterward that Wil
liams "would not be entitled to be on
the held" during luture tootball
games, nor would he be welcome in
Indian regalia at Saturday's Big
Game.
Reportedly, several alumni groups
have requested Williams to appear as
"Chiet iighttoot'' at pre-Big Game
tunctions this week and are urging
him to return in lull costume to
Saturday's game.
Williams asserted that, it the Uni
versity really takes the mascot issue
seriously, it should ban future athle
tic contests with other schools which
also use the Indian as a symbol,
"Or do the dollars which pass bet
ween the big schools mean more
than the Indian symbol?" he asked.
Kosenzweig replied, "We're not
out to retorm the world. We're trying
to responsibly run that small part ol
the world lor which we are responsi
ble."
