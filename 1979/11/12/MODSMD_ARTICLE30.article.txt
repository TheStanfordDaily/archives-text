### Brad Brockbank 
Rebounding irom last week's loss to Califor
nia, the Stamord water polo team upset No. 1
ranked UC-Santa Barbara Saturday, 12-8, at de
(uierre pool.
The game was quite a turnaround lor the
Cards, whose lackluster play in the third qijarter
ot lasi week's game lost them the opportunity to
a tilth stiaight Pacitic-10 title.
stanlord must still beat the Bears this coming
Saturday to earn a berth in the NCAA champion
ships in two weeks.
' Against the Gauchos Saturday, the Cards
played up to their national championship form,
leading the game irom the start.
Sophomore Chris Kelsey scored two of his
leam-high three goals in the first quarter to pace
stanlord to a 2-1 first quarter lead.
By halltime, the Cards extended their advan
lage to 6-i. Two quick third-quarter goals by
santa Barbara's Greg Boyer — who finished
with live brought the Gauchos back to within
one, but a strong front-court offense staked
stanlord toantt-6edge at the end ot the period.
I hen Hie Cardinal last-break began to take a
toll on the slow-responding Gauchos, and
within the first two minutes ot the final period,
Stanlord had jumped out to an 11-6 lead. Alter
that, tl>e Cards just had to use up the time to
eatn the victory.
Senior Randy Kalbus, who was poked in the
eye in the first quarter and came back in later to
help spark Stantord's lourth quarter assault,
said the difference between Saturday's game
and games in past weeks stemmed trom a team
altitude.
"The team played really well as a group," he
said. "Before, people were sitting around wait
ing lor someone else to do something. (Satur

day), everybody was really contributing, both
offensively and defensively."
Kalbus said the team played the best defen
sive game they've played this year. "The team
defense really shut things down," he said. "We
were pressing well and we did a good job cutting
down their drives."
The Cardinals recorded 14 steals in the game,
including four each by sophomore Alan
Mouchawar and jamie Bergeson.
"We played intensely for tour quarters,"
Mouchawar said ot the team. "We all really
wanted to win. There was a lot more
communication — that's what we've been hurt
ing on (in the past). Sometimes we get ahead
and relax a little bit, but that didn't happen"
against the Cauchos, he said.
The key to the game, according to Card coach
Dante Dettamanti, was getting the counter
attack going in the fourth quarter. "We had two
consecutive goals off our counter-attack, which
gave us a four-goal lead," he said.
Dettamanti also pointed to the intensity with
which the Cards worked the front-court of
fense, forcing Santa Barbara to do things which
resulted in ejections.
Six Cauchos were caught with their hands "in
the cookie jar" during the game and were
ejected. Four of these man-up situations re
sulted in Cardinal goals.
The victory boosts Stanford's overall record to
20-4-1. Cal's triumph over USC this weekend
moves the Cards into a tie with the Trojans tor
second place in the Pac-10.
Should the Cards triumph over the Bears next
Saturday, this weekend's result should give
Stanford the edge over USC tor a berth in the
nationals, since the Cauchos have beaten the
Trojans three times this year.

ot lasi week's game lost them the opportunity to
a tilth stiaight Pacitic-10 title.
stanlord must still beat the Bears this coming
Saturday to earn a berth in the NCAA champion
ships in two weeks.
' Against the Gauchos Saturday, the Cards
played up to their national championship form,
leading the game irom the start.
Sophomore Chris Kelsey scored two of his
leam-high three goals in the first quarter to pace
stanlord to a 2-1 first quarter lead.
By halltime, the Cards extended their advan
lage to 6-i. Two quick third-quarter goals by
santa Barbara's Greg Boyer — who finished
with live brought the Gauchos back to within
one, but a strong front-court offense staked
stanlord toantt-6edge at the end ot the period.
I hen Hie Cardinal last-break began to take a
toll on the slow-responding Gauchos, and
within the first two minutes ot the final period,
Stanlord had jumped out to an 11-6 lead. Alter
that, tl>e Cards just had to use up the time to
eatn the victory.
Senior Randy Kalbus, who was poked in the
eye in the first quarter and came back in later to
help spark Stantord's lourth quarter assault,
said the difference between Saturday's game
and games in past weeks stemmed trom a team
altitude.
"The team played really well as a group," he
said. "Before, people were sitting around wait
ing lor someone else to do something. (Satur

day), everybody was really contributing, both
offensively and defensively."
Kalbus said the team played the best defen
sive game they've played this year. "The team
defense really shut things down," he said. "We
were pressing well and we did a good job cutting
down their drives."
The Cardinals recorded 14 steals in the game,
including four each by sophomore Alan
Mouchawar and jamie Bergeson.
"We played intensely for tour quarters,"
Mouchawar said ot the team. "We all really
wanted to win. There was a lot more
communication — that's what we've been hurt
ing on (in the past). Sometimes we get ahead
and relax a little bit, but that didn't happen"
against the Cauchos, he said.
The key to the game, according to Card coach
Dante Dettamanti, was getting the counter
attack going in the fourth quarter. "We had two
consecutive goals off our counter-attack, which
gave us a four-goal lead," he said.
Dettamanti also pointed to the intensity with
which the Cards worked the front-court of
fense, forcing Santa Barbara to do things which
resulted in ejections.
Six Cauchos were caught with their hands "in
the cookie jar" during the game and were
ejected. Four of these man-up situations re
sulted in Cardinal goals.
The victory boosts Stanford's overall record to
20-4-1. Cal's triumph over USC this weekend
moves the Cards into a tie with the Trojans tor
second place in the Pac-10.
Should the Cards triumph over the Bears next
Saturday, this weekend's result should give
Stanford the edge over USC tor a berth in the
nationals, since the Cauchos have beaten the
Trojans three times this year.
