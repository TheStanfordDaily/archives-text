# Cards lose personality and game
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Maybe the case doesn't
merit tiling a missing persons
report with the Stanford
police, but just the same, those
men in the red and white un
ilorms facing UCLA Saturday
should be investigated.
The imposters, who ended
up losing to the Bruins 2-1,
didn't have most of the 2000
spectators, largest crowd to
watch Cardinal soccer, or head
coach Nelson Lodge fooled.
"That wasn't the Stanford
soccer team," Lodge said, "not
even a close resemblance."
The match was billed as Stan
ford, currently ranked eighth
in the West, versus UCLA,
rated 11th, with the winner get
ting a shot at one ol the berths
o! the regional playoff.
While the Cardinals may
have savored such a tempting
morsel before Saturday's
brunch, they apparently lost
most of their appetite/then
proceeded to choke on the last
courses of the meal.
Stanford took a 1-0 lead on
Dan McNevin's penalty shot
with a little over 19 minutes
elapsed. The Bruins tied with
less than tive minutes remain
ing before halttimeon a goal by
Rod Thalman, assisted by Ole
Mikkelsen.

Early in the final period, the
Cards dominated play, making
several serious threats on the
UCLA goal area while concur
rently shutting down most ol
the Bruin offense.
When a Bruin was given a red
card 25 minutes into the sec
ond half, thereby ejecting him
trom the game, it looked like
the match had Stanford written
all over it. Unlike most sports,
soccer doesn't allow a team to
replace an ejected player, forc
ing the team to continue one
man short.
However, instead of giving
up, UCLA capitalized on this
turn ot events, scoring the
winning goal about four mi
nutes later on an unassisted
tally by Gustavo Corona.
What it boiled down to is that
UCLA wanted that game more
than Stanford did, and it
showed in the Bruins' deter
mined play.
"It was purely mental,"
Lodge said. "UCLA knew it had
to work its butt off. I think basi
cally it had to do with the first
score — if we score early we
tend to relax.
"We didn't take it as an im
portant game," Lodge added.
He pointed out that Stanford
played much better soccer
against California a week ago

Sunday in a game that meant
much less.
UCLA head coach Steve Cay
said, "I feel that we played a
very gutsy game. With one man
down we played better than
Stanford with 11 men. Stanford
didn't take advantage of the
man down situation — it made
us fight harder, while it made
Stanford relax, thinking they
had everything wrapped up."
Senior Laird Cagan, upon
hearing Lodge comment that
"Wedidn't try, really," replied,
"That says it all —we were flat.
It's the story of our season —
playing well against good
teams, and flat against the
others.
"It looked like we had a man

thrown out," Cagan added.
Sophomore back Neil Ten
nyson concurred, saying
was "really a hard loss. I really
hate losing to UCLA. We
played really flat, we gave it to
them."
"(Willie) Ciucci and (Tedi
Kafalovich played well," Lodge
said. "They never let up. You
have to play 100 percent all the
time, you can't let up. We let
them come at us. It's a mental
thing to make yoursel! go to
the ball. It's sale to drop back
and defend."
At press time, the selection
ot teams lor regional playoffs
had not been made. USF and
Santa Clara are favored.
