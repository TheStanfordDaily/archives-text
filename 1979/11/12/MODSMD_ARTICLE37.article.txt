Ousting of Iranians delayed
Washington — Deportation of Iranian stu
dents who are in the United States illegally will
not begin until December at the earliest, a
justice Department official said yesterday.
"We are certainly not going to see any actual
deportations within fhe month," said the offi
cial, who requested anonymity. "It will take a
little longer than that."
Apparently hoping to dampen Iranian stu
dent demonstrations out of tear for the safety
of 60 American hostages in Iran, President
Jimmy Carter ordered the lustice Department
on Saturday to deport Iranian students who
have violated the terms ot their entry visas.
While the justice Department was grappling
yesterday with how to implement Carter's or
der, White House Press secretary )ody Powell
stressed that not all Iranian students sym
pathize with their counterparts in Iran who are
holding the hostages on demand that the shah,
a cancer patient in New York City, be returned
to face criminal charges.
"We have had Iranian students and other
Iranians contact the White House to express
their concern for the lives over there," Powell
said, "just being an Iranian in this country is
not a sign of sympathy with the holding of the
hostages."
The justice Department official said the
50,000 Iranian students in the United States will
be asked to register either in immigration of
fices or on college campuses.
"We will be putting out more complete in
formation on how this process is supposed to
be handled," the official said. "Until the notice
comes out, people are not expected to just
come forward."
The official said there were several ways a
student could violate terms ot his or her entry
visa and thus be here illegally: it a person is no
longer in school; it a visa lias expired; il a
student is working without permission; it a
student is not taking a lull course load or is not
in good academic standing; or il a student has
been convicted ol a crime ol violence and has
been sentenced to a prison term ol at least a
year.

Foreign Relations Committee recommended
approval of a treaty with the Soviet Union limit
ing strategic weapons and sent the pact to an
uncertain fate on the Senate floor.
The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, the
product ot seven years of negotiations under
three administrations, was brought to a com
mittee vote Friday after four months ot intense
examination and debate. Approval was on a 9-6
vote.
In final argument, Sen. Frank Church ID-
Idaho), the committee's chairman, said defeat
ing SALT II would "move us closer to the edge
ot the nuclear abyss."
He said Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd plans to bring the treaty to the Senate
lloor "when prospects for ratification are
bright."
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker, a
GOP presidential contender, voted against the
treaty. He said later the margin by which it was
passed indicates the Senate "probably will in
sist on amendments" and in their absence
"will defeat it."
In a statement issued by the White House,
President jimmy Carter said he was "deeply
gratified" by the vote.
To win ratification, the treaty needs 67 votes
on the Senate lloor, two-thirds ol the 100

Saudis may raise oil price
Nicosia, Cyprus — It would "not be surpris
ing" if Saudi Arabia raises the price ot its oil to
the level ot other producers betore next
month's price-setting conterence ol the Or
ganization ol Petroleum Exporting Countries,
the Middle East Economic Survey said in to
day's edition.
The journal, which is well iniormed on Saudi
oil developments, said Saudi Arabia has be
come disillusioned with the results ot its policy
ol maintaining substantially lower crude oil
prices than those ol other OPEC countries.
"It is now clear the Saudis feel, particularly
in view ol the colossal third-quarter prolifs re
gistered by the Aramco parent companies (Ex
xon, Texaco, Socal and Mobil) that the benefits
ol the lower Saudi prices have gone to the oil
companies, rattier than the consumers," the
magazine said.
"In such circumstances it would not be sur
prising it Saudi Arabia took action to raise its
prices somewhat even betore the next OPFC
conterence," it said. The conterence is
scheduled tor Dec. 17 in Caracas, Venezuela.
Aramco is the company that operates Saudi
Arabia s oil lields. it is mostly Saudi-owned,
with the tour American oil companies as
partners.

The Saudis have maintained theotticial price
ot their light crude at $18 a barrel, while other
OPEC nations added surcharges to theirs up to
a ceiling ot $23.50 alter the last OPEC price
meeting, and recently several countries have
boosted it above that ceiling.
U.S. could resist Iran embargo
Washington — Treasury Secretary William
Miller said Friday that Americans could rapidly
otfset an oil cutoff by Iran it they reduced their
use ot gasoline and petroleum.
"It we had a shorttall by not purchasing the
equivalent ot 700,000 barrels ot Iranian oil, if it
came to that, I believe the American public
would react very quickly to cut their own usage
by that amount and, therefore, offset that ac
tion," Miller said.'
He continued: "I believe that would be a
very powerful thing to do. It would be a good
message to send."
The Treasury secretary added that he
thought Americans could, lor example, use 15
percent less gasoline "without changing their
standard ol living, by just adjusting the way
they live."
Miller's comments followed by less than 24
hours reports from the National Iranian Oil
Co. and its clients that Iran will cut back ship
ments ol oil by 5 percent in the fourth quarter
this year.
There had been worry that Iran might elimi
nate its 700,000 barrels-per-day sales to the Un
ited States in an ellort to secure return ol the
deposed shah, who is being treated tor
gallstones and cancer in New York City.
Miller said the Carter administration was not
considering trade sanctions or the withdrawal
ot visas trom Iranians currently in the United
States as ways ol retaliating against an Iranian
oil cutoll.

tion and enforcement office in Washington.
|an Strasma of the NRC's Chicago office said
the lackson-based utility allowed a vent to stay
open lor 1H months at its Palisades nuclear

Ousting of Iranians delayed
Washington — Deportation of Iranian stu
dents who are in the United States illegally will
not begin until December at the earliest, a
justice Department official said yesterday.
"We are certainly not going to see any actual
deportations within fhe month," said the offi
cial, who requested anonymity. "It will take a
little longer than that."
Apparently hoping to dampen Iranian stu
dent demonstrations out of tear for the safety
of 60 American hostages in Iran, President
Jimmy Carter ordered the lustice Department
on Saturday to deport Iranian students who
have violated the terms ot their entry visas.
While the justice Department was grappling
yesterday with how to implement Carter's or
der, White House Press secretary )ody Powell
stressed that not all Iranian students sym
pathize with their counterparts in Iran who are
holding the hostages on demand that the shah,
a cancer patient in New York City, be returned
to face criminal charges.
"We have had Iranian students and other
Iranians contact the White House to express
their concern for the lives over there," Powell
said, "just being an Iranian in this country is
not a sign of sympathy with the holding of the
hostages."
The justice Department official said the
50,000 Iranian students in the United States will
be asked to register either in immigration of
fices or on college campuses.
"We will be putting out more complete in
formation on how this process is supposed to
be handled," the official said. "Until the notice
comes out, people are not expected to just
come forward."
The official said there were several ways a
student could violate terms ot his or her entry
visa and thus be here illegally: it a person is no
longer in school; it a visa lias expired; il a
student is working without permission; it a
student is not taking a lull course load or is not
in good academic standing; or il a student has
been convicted ol a crime ol violence and has
been sentenced to a prison term ol at least a
year.

Foreign Relations Committee recommended
approval of a treaty with the Soviet Union limit
ing strategic weapons and sent the pact to an
uncertain fate on the Senate floor.
The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, the
product ot seven years of negotiations under
three administrations, was brought to a com
mittee vote Friday after four months ot intense
examination and debate. Approval was on a 9-6
vote.
In final argument, Sen. Frank Church ID-
Idaho), the committee's chairman, said defeat
ing SALT II would "move us closer to the edge
ot the nuclear abyss."
He said Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd plans to bring the treaty to the Senate
lloor "when prospects for ratification are
bright."
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker, a
GOP presidential contender, voted against the
treaty. He said later the margin by which it was
passed indicates the Senate "probably will in
sist on amendments" and in their absence
"will defeat it."
In a statement issued by the White House,

gratified" by the vote.
To win ratification, the treaty needs 67 votes
on the Senate lloor, two-thirds ol the 100

Saudis may raise oil price
Nicosia, Cyprus — It would "not be surpris
ing" if Saudi Arabia raises the price ot its oil to
the level ot other producers betore next
month's price-setting conterence ol the Or
ganization ol Petroleum Exporting Countries,
the Middle East Economic Survey said in to
day's edition.
The journal, which is well iniormed on Saudi
oil developments, said Saudi Arabia has be
come disillusioned with the results ot its policy
ol maintaining substantially lower crude oil
prices than those ol other OPEC countries.
"It is now clear the Saudis feel, particularly
in view ol the colossal third-quarter prolifs re
gistered by the Aramco parent companies (Ex
xon, Texaco, Socal and Mobil) that the benefits
ol the lower Saudi prices have gone to the oil
companies, rattier than the consumers," the
magazine said.
"In such circumstances it would not be sur
prising it Saudi Arabia took action to raise its
prices somewhat even betore the next OPFC
conterence," it said. The conterence is
scheduled tor Dec. 17 in Caracas, Venezuela.
Aramco is the company that operates Saudi
Arabia s oil lields. it is mostly Saudi-owned,
with the tour American oil companies as
partners.

The Saudis have maintained theotticial price
ot their light crude at $18 a barrel, while other
OPEC nations added surcharges to theirs up to
a ceiling ot $23.50 alter the last OPEC price
meeting, and recently several countries have
boosted it above that ceiling.
U.S. could resist Iran embargo
Washington — Treasury Secretary William
Miller said Friday that Americans could rapidly
otfset an oil cutoff by Iran it they reduced their
use ot gasoline and petroleum.
"It we had a shorttall by not purchasing the
equivalent ot 700,000 barrels ot Iranian oil, if it
came to that, I believe the American public
would react very quickly to cut their own usage
by that amount and, therefore, offset that ac
tion," Miller said.'
He continued: "I believe that would be a
very powerful thing to do. It would be a good
message to send."
The Treasury secretary added that he
thought Americans could, lor example, use 15
percent less gasoline "without changing their
standard ol living, by just adjusting the way
they live."
Miller's comments followed by less than 24
hours reports from the National Iranian Oil
Co. and its clients that Iran will cut back ship
ments ol oil by 5 percent in the fourth quarter
this year.
There had been worry that Iran might elimi

U.S. could resist Iran embargo
Washington — Treasury Secretary William
Miller said Friday that Americans could rapidly
otfset an oil cutoff by Iran it they reduced their
use ot gasoline and petroleum.
"It we had a shorttall by not purchasing the
equivalent ot 700,000 barrels ot Iranian oil, if it
came to that, I believe the American public
would react very quickly to cut their own usage
by that amount and, therefore, offset that ac
tion," Miller said.'
He continued: "I believe that would be a
very powerful thing to do. It would be a good
message to send."
The Treasury secretary added that he
thought Americans could, lor example, use 15
percent less gasoline "without changing their
standard ol living, by just adjusting the way
they live."
Miller's comments followed by less than 24
hours reports from the National Iranian Oil
Co. and its clients that Iran will cut back ship
ments ol oil by 5 percent in the fourth quarter
this year.
There had been worry that Iran might elimi
nate its 700,000 barrels-per-day sales to the Un
ited States in an ellort to secure return ol the
deposed shah, who is being treated tor
gallstones and cancer in New York City.
Miller said the Carter administration was not
considering trade sanctions or the withdrawal
ot visas trom Iranians currently in the United
States as ways ol retaliating against an Iranian
oil cutoll.

Ousting of Iranians delayed
Washington — Deportation of Iranian stu
dents who are in the United States illegally will
not begin until December at the earliest, a
justice Department official said yesterday.
"We are certainly not going to see any actual
deportations within fhe month," said the offi
cial, who requested anonymity. "It will take a
little longer than that."
Apparently hoping to dampen Iranian stu
dent demonstrations out of tear for the safety
of 60 American hostages in Iran, President
Jimmy Carter ordered the lustice Department
on Saturday to deport Iranian students who
have violated the terms ot their entry visas.
While the justice Department was grappling
yesterday with how to implement Carter's or
der, White House Press secretary )ody Powell
stressed that not all Iranian students sym
pathize with their counterparts in Iran who are
holding the hostages on demand that the shah,
a cancer patient in New York City, be returned
to face criminal charges.
"We have had Iranian students and other
Iranians contact the White House to express
their concern for the lives over there," Powell
said, "just being an Iranian in this country is
not a sign of sympathy with the holding of the
hostages."
The justice Department official said the
50,000 Iranian students in the United States will
be asked to register either in immigration of
fices or on college campuses.
"We will be putting out more complete in
formation on how this process is supposed to
be handled," the official said. "Until the notice
comes out, people are not expected to just
come forward."
The official said there were several ways a
student could violate terms ot his or her entry
visa and thus be here illegally: it a person is no
longer in school; it a visa lias expired; il a
student is working without permission; it a
student is not taking a lull course load or is not
in good academic standing; or il a student has
been convicted ol a crime ol violence and has
been sentenced to a prison term ol at least a
year.

approval of a treaty with the Soviet Union limit
ing strategic weapons and sent the pact to an
uncertain fate on the Senate floor.
The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, the
product ot seven years of negotiations under
three administrations, was brought to a com
mittee vote Friday after four months ot intense

ing SALT II would "move us closer to the edge
ot the nuclear abyss."
He said Senate Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd plans to bring the treaty to the Senate
lloor "when prospects for ratification are

xon, Texaco, Socal and Mobil) that the benefits
ol the lower Saudi prices have gone to the oil
companies, rattier than the consumers," the

"In such circumstances it would not be sur

Saudis may raise oil price
Nicosia, Cyprus — It would "not be surpris
ing" if Saudi Arabia raises the price ot its oil to
the level ot other producers betore next
month's price-setting conterence ol the Or
ganization ol Petroleum Exporting Countries,
the Middle East Economic Survey said in to
day's edition.
The journal, which is well iniormed on Saudi
oil developments, said Saudi Arabia has be
come disillusioned with the results ot its policy
ol maintaining substantially lower crude oil
prices than those ol other OPEC countries.
"It is now clear the Saudis feel, particularly
in view ol the colossal third-quarter prolifs re
gistered by the Aramco parent companies (Ex
xon, Texaco, Socal and Mobil) that the benefits
ol the lower Saudi prices have gone to the oil
companies, rattier than the consumers," the
magazine said.
"In such circumstances it would not be sur
prising it Saudi Arabia took action to raise its
prices somewhat even betore the next OPFC
conterence," it said. The conterence is
scheduled tor Dec. 17 in Caracas, Venezuela.
Aramco is the company that operates Saudi
Arabia s oil lields. it is mostly Saudi-owned,
with the tour American oil companies as
partners.

The Saudis have maintained theotticial price
ot their light crude at $18 a barrel, while other
OPEC nations added surcharges to theirs up to
a ceiling ot $23.50 alter the last OPEC price
meeting, and recently several countries have
boosted it above that ceiling.
U.S. could resist Iran embargo
Washington — Treasury Secretary William
Miller said Friday that Americans could rapidly
otfset an oil cutoff by Iran it they reduced their
use ot gasoline and petroleum.
"It we had a shorttall by not purchasing the
equivalent ot 700,000 barrels ot Iranian oil, if it
came to that, I believe the American public
would react very quickly to cut their own usage
by that amount and, therefore, offset that ac
tion," Miller said.'
He continued: "I believe that would be a
very powerful thing to do. It would be a good
message to send."
The Treasury secretary added that he
thought Americans could, lor example, use 15
percent less gasoline "without changing their
standard ol living, by just adjusting the way
they live."
Miller's comments followed by less than 24
hours reports from the National Iranian Oil
Co. and its clients that Iran will cut back ship
ments ol oil by 5 percent in the fourth quarter
this year.
There had been worry that Iran might elimi
nate its 700,000 barrels-per-day sales to the Un
ited States in an ellort to secure return ol the
deposed shah, who is being treated tor
gallstones and cancer in New York City.
Miller said the Carter administration was not
considering trade sanctions or the withdrawal
ot visas trom Iranians currently in the United
States as ways ol retaliating against an Iranian
oil cutoll.
