### Associated Press 
Iranian student;, chanting "Death
to the Americans" scaled a tence and
poured into the U.S. Embassy garden
in Beirut, Lebanon, yesterday in sup
port ot the 8-day-old embassy
takeover in Tehran. Meanwhile,
'ran's new toreign attairs chiet de
clared there would be "no com-,
promise, no negotiation" to tree the
Tehran hostages.
It was believed that behind-the
scenes talks continued in the Iranian
capital, however, with the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and
Moslem diplomats as mediators.
One Arab report said hostages might
be treed by today, although an Ira
nian otticial said he saw no "omen"
that this would happen.
The anti-American tervor in Tehran
was unabated.
Yesterday some 200 unitormed air
torce men joined the thousands ot
Iranian protesters who have flocked
to the U.S. Embassy each day since a

mob ot student militants seized it
and about 100 Americans and other
hostages Nov. 4. The airmen de
manded that all ties with the United
States be cut and all toreign capital
be expropriated.
About 40 Iranians invaded the
Beirut embassy garden, burning an
American tlag and chanting protest
slogans tor about two hours until Sy
rian peacekeeping troops, swinging
clubs, routed them in a bloody
melee.
When the unarmed students
jumped over the embassy lence, the
U.S. Marine guards did not try to re
pulse them and instead took to the
embassy root with their light
weapons and radios.
Armed Lebanese police rein
lorcements arrived at the scene but
took no action, apparently waiting
lor the Syrians, the strongest armed
torce in laction-ridden Lebanon.
Lebanese security sources re
ported last week that the PLO had
thwarted an Iranian student plot to
take over the American Embassy in
Beirut.
Despite pleas tor calm trom Presi
dent |immy Carter and other otticials
and prohibitions against parades, the
seizure ot the embassy in Iran
sparked more demonstrations yes
terday in the United States.
In Washington, a crowd ol bet
ween 150 and 200 people gathered in
a steady, chilly rain outside the Is
lamic Center and marched near the
Iranian Embassy.
One group ot protesters across the
street trom the center set lire to an
Iranian llag. That brought cheers and

chants ol "Down with Khomeini" as
passing motorists honked horns in
support.
In Tehran, Abolhassen Banisadr,
recently named to head Iran's
loreign Ministry by Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini, told French radio in
terviewers that "no compromise, no
negotiation, is possible," over Iran's
demand that the United States extra
dite the ousted Shah Mohammed
Re/a Pahlavi to Iran to stand trial lor
his lite.
Banisadr said he would not be
satisiied it the deposed monarch,
hospitalized in New York tor cancer
treatment, were merely expelled to
another country.
Even il the shah dies in the United
States or is expelled, Iran would still
hold a trial, "because it is the Ameri
cans we want to judge lor their mis
deeds," he said.
The Iranian revolutionaries blame
the shah's U.S. allies in part lor the
crimes they say he committed against
the Iranian people during his }7-year
reign. They also contend that the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran was nothing
more than a "spy center,"
The Tehran embassy hostages
"were arrested by the students, not
by the government," Banisadr said,
although they have Khomeini's sup
port lor their demands.
The students holding the embassy
said they would begin a live-day
hunger strike today to prove their
willingness to endure sacrifice,
Tehran Radio reported.
Foreign diplomats who saw the
hostages Saturday said they ap
peared in good health.
