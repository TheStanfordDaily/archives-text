## 
### Mike Vaska 
The Rules Committee ol the ASSU
Senate will consider raising spending
ceilings lor ASSU elections some
time this quarter, according to
Council ol Presidents (COP) member
Tom Gart.
"Candidates tor this year s senate
were frustrated by the limited buying
power" that the spending regula
tions lorced upon them, said Gart.
The present price lids are set at $50
per individual or slate tor ASSU Se
nate elections, $75 per slate lor
senior class presidents' races and
$200 lor a slate running lor the COP,
he said.
These amounts haven't changed
since 1970 or '71, Gart said. Because
ol inflation, in 1970 terms, "$5O is
worth $20 now/ he said.
Gart, who said he would bring the
issue before the Rules Committee,
said that there may be a need lor an
inllation index to be built into the
spending regulations.
Mike O'Reilly, Elections Commis
sioner tor the past election and
chairman ol the ASSU Elections
Committee, said "the amount
should be raised" or guidelines es
tabilshed to limit the amount ol
materials distributed in the election

campaign.
"Our goal is to make elections
equal and keep costs down," he said.
Possible changes will be suggested in
a report to be presented by the Elec -
tion Committee to the senate alter
Thanksgiving, he said.
These modifications will include
the designation ot a single area in
each dorm as the only spot where
campaign literature can be posted
and the establishment ot a common
supply source lor campaign mate
rials, he said.
The $50 restriction on slates run
ning tor the senate was imposed last
year. Formerly, each slate candidate
could spend his or her allotted $50.
Leslie Torvik, a former slate candi
date and now ASSU Senator and
member ot the Rules Committee, cal
led the restriction an "untair advan
tage" lor those not on slates.
According to O'Reilly, the restric
tion was imposed because the senate
last year "felt that the senate should
be made up of individuals."
It was "almost a game to come in
under the limit" in the last election,
Torvik said. It would be a "very tair
consideration to raise the limit," she
said.
