As in the past, Big Game promises
to be no small event. This year's
testivities — which include singing,
parading, bowling, football and the
hopes of a record-breaking bunny
hop — will be some ot the best ever,
according to Patricia Brandt ot the
Otlice ot Student Activities.
"The people involved with the
planning have done a super job,"
said Brandt, who is coordinator of
the various groups involved with this
week's events. "The senior class
presidents, the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC), Student Arts at Stan
lord (STARTS) — allot them have put
in a lot ot work. I'm really pleased,"
said Brandt.
Although the game is not until
Saturday afternoon, the momentum
will begin to build live tu!l days be
fore kickott time. STARTS is present
ing tour noon hours ot music at Tre
sidder Union, beginning with tomor
rows performance by Counterpoint,
the University's lemale vocal grdup.
The Glee Club will sing Wednes
day, the Mendicants will perform
Thursday and Calliope, a band from
ott campus, will play 112 riday.
One ot Big Game's biggest tradi
tions has been Ram's Flead's Big
Game Gaieties, part ot the weekend

since 1911, except tor a dry spell trom
1968 until 1977.
This year's show, the third since
that intermission, "should be one ot
the best ever,'' according to Director
Terry Ross. "We're doing an original
musical comedy written and directed
by Stanford students . . . It's a total
show and one of the best I've seen on
any college campus," he said.
Events galore
Times tor Gaieties are Thursday at
H p.m. and two shows Friday at 2 and
6 p.m. Tickets tor all shows are al
ready sold out, according to Ross.
The other big event Thursday night
is the All-Campus Rally at Lake
Lagunita. The Band, sponsor ot the
event, will start the musicatB:3o, and
Pepsi Cola will provide a tireworks
display at 10.
Friday the festivities begin early
and end late. At noon the IFC will
hold its "Mega Dinner," and, if
you're up tor liquid diets, stop by the
Flo Mo tield to enjoy the music and
lorty kegs of beer. The fun lasts as
long as the retreshments do.
Matchless rally
Friday night will be a busy one for
those who plan to participate in
every event. At 7:15 the LSJUMB will
hold a "non-fire" rally on the stepsof
UGLY. The formerly traditional Big

Came bontire has been discontinued
since 1976.
Meanwhile, back at the Recreation
Center, the men's and women's
bowling teams from Stantord and Cal
will battle tor the possession ot the
Axe Handles trophy.
And at 9 p.m. "Leland's Latter Day
Railroad" — 20 buses loaded with
screaming Stantordites —will depart
tor Nob Hill in San Francisco and the
beginning of the pre-game rally.
Get-rich capitalism
Bus transportation is available
through Mike Moradzedah, an en
terprising student who has chartered
the buses for Stanford use. No indi
vidual seats are available, but whole
or half buses can be chartered from
$164 to $196.
The rally, which usually attracts
crowds from the campus as well as
the City, will proceed from Nob Hill
to Victorian Square, ending up with
an Incomparables' concert.
At last, one confronts the Big
Came. As expected, seats are sold
out, but those willing to pay may find
one of the few unwanted tickets. The
Athletic Department ticket office es
timated that 85,000 tickets have been

But the tun does not end Uiere.
Alter the game, the II C is planning an
incredible record-breaking, lund
raising rhumba line. To contribute to
the Muscular Dystrophy loundation,
the fraternity group hopes to gel as
many people as possible on the
stadium track to form one giant
"bunny hop".
II C President John Kinney said the
money will be raised by charging $1
per person to join the dance. All the
money will go toward the charity.
Tickets can either be bought at the
game or in advance.
Shake your booties
As the Band winds down its post
game show, the representatives irom
the l rats and l reshman dorms will lead
the crowds down onto the held. The
dance will last about live minutes,
and a member ot the (miness Hook
ol World Records stall will be on
hand to officiate. The current record
stands at 5600 rhumba-ers.
The crowds that leave the rhumba
line through the tunnel will not want
to dally there, and most likely the
revelry will not stop until the wee
hours the following day.
