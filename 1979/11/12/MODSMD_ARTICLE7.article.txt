## Bolivians question new leader's ability to govern 
### 
La Paz, Bolivia (AP) — Col.
Albert Natusch needed only six
armored cars to take over the
government Nov. 1 in a quiet,
bloodless coup. Despite civi
lian opposition, he has re
mained in power 11 days —
thanks mainly to the clannish
ness ot Bolivia's army.
Most officers in the 25,000-
man army did not even know
the coup was coming, well
informed sources say. The of
ficers grumbled, but by sunset
that day all garrison comman
ders had pledged Natusch
"their support.
Bolivians who know him
question Natusch's leadership
qualifications. They say he is
erratic, poor at planning and
has a meager understanding of
Bolivia's extensive economic
problems.
Almost everyone in Bolivia
predicts he will not remain in
power much longer. He has
failed to secure the support of
the country's congressmen
and labor leaders. The man he
deposed, President Walter
Guevara, has emerged twice
from hiding to publicly urge
Natusch's overthrow.
2200 coups
The coup was one of about
200 in Bolivia's 154-year history
as a republic. That Natusch has
lasted for almost two weeks,
observers say, is the result of
the military's reluctance to act
against one of its own, a reluc
tance rooted in a civilian upris
ing in 1952.
Bolivia's 1951 presidential
election was won by the candi
date of the Nationalist Re
volutionary Movement, a
populist group. Then President
Mamerto Urriligagoidia re

fused to recognize the elec
tion, however, and turned
power over to a military junta.
Riots broke out in April 1952,
and Bolivia's weak military was
defeated by groups of armed
civilians. Humiliated army
leaders were forced to close
the military college, accept
Nationalist Revolutionary
Movement officials as officers,
merge the army with the
militia, and join the party. The
army gained revenge on Nov.
4, 1954, when it overthrew
President Victor Paz Es
tenssoro.
Army fears civilians
Army officers have stuck to
gether ever since, fearful of a
new attempt by civilians to de
stroy the military.
The unwritten rule is that
whoever comes to power in a
coup is supported by his com
rades, at least until the top of
ficers gather later and decide at
a single meeting whether the
coup-maker should stay or go.
The system makes it inviting
for just about any colonel with
a half-dozen armored cars to
make a dash tor the palace and
hope for prolonged support
from his colleagues.
In 1970, there were three
coups within 24 hours.
Natusch, however, probably
has less support than any pres
ident in the past 27 years, and
appears to be hanging on by
sheer force and repression,
military sources say.
Thin support
His problems are mounting,
the sources say, and they pre
dict he will not last much
longer. The sources note:
— Natusch broke the un
written rule by arresting offic

ers before they could organize
a meeting, and army support is
wearing thin. Armored units
guarding the presidential
palace and patroling the streets
of the capital pulled back to
their bases Wednesday despite
Natusch's plea for them to stay
in La Paz.
— Congress voted Saturday
not to recognize Natusch as
president and called on the
armed forces to unite with
lawmakers to restore constitu
tional rule. Most politicians
and top union leaders have re
fused to take part in a prop
osed three-man junta with
Natusch.
— Civilian opposition has
brought slaughter in the
streets. Officials say at least 80
people have been killed and
250 wounded by police and
soldiers Natusch sent to clear
barricades and suppress de
monstrations. The Bolivian
Human Rights Council says at
least 200 civilians have been kil
led and another 200 wounded.
