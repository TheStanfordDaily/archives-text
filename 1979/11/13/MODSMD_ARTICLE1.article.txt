# Doctors fight for Hospital access
## 
### Cici Oremland 
A liaison committee composed of
physicians from the community and
the University hospital will attempt
to resolve the longstanding con
troversy over community doctors'
access to hospital facilities.
Many local doctors were excluded
from selected facilities in the anes
thesiology, neurology, radiology and
otherdepartments when the hospital
formally announced its "closed
staff" policy in August 1978. The pol
icy barred community doctors not al
readyon the hospital staff trom using
facilities at specified departments.
The committee, formed when
Community Physicians for Patient
Care and other doctors protested
their exclusion trom the facilities,
will announce its conclusions this
month. The Hospital Board of Direc
tors will review those findings, and
the Palo Alto Civic League will spon
sor a public torum on the report Nov.
29.
The University and Palo Alto oper
ated the hospital jointly trom 1956
until 1968 when the city sold its share
of the institution to the University.
The agreement of sale stipulated
that only those community physi
cians then on the hospital staff would
be guaranteed access to all
hosnital-based services.
Suit filed
In March 1977, Dr. William
Hayden, a local radiologist, brought
suit against the Hospital after he was
denied permission to use facilities in
the diagnostic radiology division.
"I met or exceeded all of the qual
ifications to bea memberof the med
ical staff," he said. He settled out of
court in February 1978 and was
granted the privileges he had sought,
but the Hospital issued its formal
statement ot policy excluding many
community physicians six months la
ter.
As the memorandum now stands,
when the present "privileged" doc
tors either retire or leave the area,
their places on the Hospital
privileged list will not be replaced.
Not entirely barred
Physicians are not excluded com
pletely from the Hospital. Their pa
tients are admitted, and the doctors
are given access to facilities in other
than the select departments.
The closed staff rule is not stated in
the Hospital by-laws but is part of the
current Hospital's philosophy.
Hospital patients thus have a li
mited choice of physicians for cer
tain services. Patients' private doc
tors who do not have privileges are
denied the use of the special
facilities. The patients must select a
doctor trom among those who do
have access to the departments.
"It's a matter of choice. Patient and
doctor have a right to the dottor of
their choice whether it be a member
of the hospital staff or a doctor in
private practice," said Dr. Harry Mit
telman, a liaison committee member
and person in charge of press rela

tions for Community Physicians for
Patient Care.
Quality
Mittelman said quality ot patient
care would not be sacrificed but its
maintenance would make the Hospi
tal more costly to its patients and less
efficient.
Hospital administrative aides
argue that current facilities are not
big enough to meet even the pre
sent needs of the medical faculty.
Some 488 community doctors have
full use of the Hospital facilities,
compared with 343 full-time faculty
members.
"Doctors in private practice are
concerned with patient care. There
must be a compromise (between pri
vate practitioners' needs and those
of the medical faculty)," said Conrad
Gullixson, head of the Hospital
Board of Directors.
Won't stick
Dr. Walter Arons, a clinical faculty
doctor, said, "I don't think the Aug. 1
memorandum (the official date of
the closed staff policy) will stick. I
think there will be a solution."
Palo Alto doctors fear new doctors
will be discouraged from settling in
this area since they will not be per
mitted to use these certain hospital
based services.
Mittelman said he felt progress
was being made that would be ac
ceptable to both sides.

cians then on the hospital staff would
be guaranteed access to all
hosnital-based services.
Suit filed
In March 1977, Dr. William
Hayden, a local radiologist, brought
suit against the Hospital after he was
denied permission to use facilities in
the diagnostic radiology division.
"I met or exceeded all of the qual
ifications to bea memberof the med
ical staff," he said. He settled out of
court in February 1978 and was
granted the privileges he had sought,
but the Hospital issued its formal
statement ot policy excluding many
community physicians six months la
ter.
As the memorandum now stands,
when the present "privileged" doc
tors either retire or leave the area,
their places on the Hospital
privileged list will not be replaced.
Not entirely barred
Physicians are not excluded com
pletely from the Hospital. Their pa
tients are admitted, and the doctors
are given access to facilities in other
than the select departments.
The closed staff rule is not stated in
the Hospital by-laws but is part of the
current Hospital's philosophy.
Hospital patients thus have a li
mited choice of physicians for cer
tain services. Patients' private doc
tors who do not have privileges are
denied the use of the special
facilities. The patients must select a
doctor trom among those who do
have access to the departments.
"It's a matter of choice. Patient and
doctor have a right to the dottor of
their choice whether it be a member
of the hospital staff or a doctor in
private practice," said Dr. Harry Mit
telman, a liaison committee member
and person in charge of press rela

tions for Community Physicians for
Patient Care.
Quality
Mittelman said quality ot patient
care would not be sacrificed but its
maintenance would make the Hospi
tal more costly to its patients and less
efficient.
Hospital administrative aides
argue that current facilities are not
big enough to meet even the pre
sent needs of the medical faculty.
Some 488 community doctors have
full use of the Hospital facilities,
compared with 343 full-time faculty
members.
"Doctors in private practice are
concerned with patient care. There
must be a compromise (between pri
vate practitioners' needs and those
of the medical faculty)," said Conrad
Gullixson, head of the Hospital
Board of Directors.
Won't stick
Dr. Walter Arons, a clinical faculty
doctor, said, "I don't think the Aug. 1
memorandum (the official date of
the closed staff policy) will stick. I
think there will be a solution."
Palo Alto doctors fear new doctors
will be discouraged from settling in
this area since they will not be per
mitted to use these certain hospital
based services.
Mittelman said he felt progress
was being made that would be ac
ceptable to both sides.
