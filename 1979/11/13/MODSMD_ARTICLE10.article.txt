# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mark Albertson Turkey mania strikes again 
### 
The winds of autumn have swept in and, as
usual, they have brought rain, football, elec
tions and . . . birds. Yes, birds. They are
everywhere. Cobblers of all shapes and sizes
grace store windows and meat counters.
Flocks of feathered creatures can be seen fly
ing across the sky in search of warmer climates.
Hordes of housewives have begun making plans
for whatever variety of poultry they will serve on
Thanksgiving or Christmas.
It's that time of year again, friends.
Thus, in a fowl mood, I ventured one day to
the Placement Center for another rite of autumn
â€” the job interview. The experience itself is
rather painless and I sat before two interview
ers, patiently answering the usual questions.
I carefully told them how I could contribute to
their company and what I hoped to be doing 10
years from now.
Ihe session was going quite smoothly and I
half-expected them to hire me on the spot.
And then they sprang the "Trick Question."
If humans were birds, one ot the panel mem
bers said, how would you relate to them;'
I was somewhat surprised at the bi/arre twist
my interview had suddenly taken. But I quickly
recovered and concentrated on a suitable reply.
0.K., let's see. Rod Stewart is a rooster,
Laverneand Shirley are pigeons, Truman Capote
is a capon, and slow bank tellers are turkeys.
My two questioners stared at me, slack-jawed
in amazement. Would you mind repeating that,
they asked.
Certainly not, I replied and began to elaborate

further.
Ah, Barry Goldwater is a hawk, )ohn Chancel
lor is an owl, Howard Baker is a cornish hen, and
tennis opponents who hit lobs on a sunny day
are turkeys.
The interview had now begun to deteriorate at
an alarming rate. One of the gentlemen had bro
ken out in a cold sweat, and the other was furi
ously cleaning his hearing aid. I was clearly in
serious trouble, but decided to continue any
way.
How about this? Walter Mondale is an eagle,
(ill Clayburgh is a swan, Mick Jagger is a peacock
and the designers of the Susan B. Anthony dollar
are turkeys.
Both of the men were now gazing at me with
dazed expressions that bordered on terminal
shock. It was as if I had begun sprouting feath
ers,
One ot them opened his mouth and started to
stammer, but I cut him off quickly. I was hot
now.
George Meany is a penguin, Woody Allen is
an ostrich, Dr. Spock is a stork, and companies
who fire their empk vees for union activities are
turkeys.
My two interviewers were now gobbling in
coherently at each other. I saw no reason to
proceed any further and made a hasty exit out of
the office and into the crisp autumn air.
Two days later, they hired me.
