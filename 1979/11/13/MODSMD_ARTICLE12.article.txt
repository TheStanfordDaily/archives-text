Ticket limit?
I would like to know why
Ram's Head, with only a very
limited number of tickets avail
able for the Friday evening per
formance of Gaieties, has not
limited the number of tickets
any one individual may purch
ase.
This has been the policy of
other organizations on cam
pus: when there is a great de
mand for tickets, rresidder
Ticket Office limits ticket sales
to two per customer, and the
Athletic Department maintains
the same limit on Big Game tic
ket sales.
Wednesday morning I ar
rived at the Gaieties table at
10:10, to be informed that only
30 tickets were still available for
Friday night, and that these tic
kets would go on sale at 10 the
following morning. Thursday
morning I arrived at 9:15, and
found myself sixth in a line
which had formed at 9.
By the time tickets went on
sale, there were roughly 50
people in line, hoping for Fri
day night seats, of which we
were then informed only 21
(not 30) remained.
Since each person was al
lowed to purchase 2 tic kets per
student ID, these 21 seats
were sold before I made my
way to the front of the line.
I know that block ticket sales
are available tor student living
groups, and I took advantage
of this opportunity during the
last two years. I have since
graduated, and I am now a full
time staff member, who has en
joyed very much the Gaieties
shows of the past two years.
It seems to me quite unfair
tnat one person could have
bought those 21 seats, had he
or she 11 student ID s. And no
identification is necessary for
adult tickets, two of which I
would have purchased; I as
sume I could have bought all 21
seats, had I been first in line.
Doesn't it seem much more
equitable to place a limit on the

number of tickets each indi
vidual may purchase?
I did not appreciate waiting 1
hour in line, spending time I
should have spent at work, wait
ing for something I thought
was worthwhile. Being sixth in
line, I had good reason to be
lieve it would be worth the
wait, because I would get tic
kets for a show which I think
has been very well done.
I am not against block ticket
sales for student living groups,
but the limited tickets remain
ing should be distributed a lit
tle more fairly.
It is grossly unfair to exclude
from such activities members
of the Stanford community
who are not students. It's a
shame, since Ram's Head's
productions have been excel
lent in the past, but I've seen
my last Ram's Head show.

Cuban question
Carlos Pascual (D,i//y, Nov. 7)
teels my article on Cuba (Daf/y,
Oct. 30) "should make us
abandon our possessions and
head tor that democratic
paradise."
If facts on infant mortality,
illiteracy, agrarian and urban
reform make him feel that way,
that is his problem. In my arti
cle I said Cuba was not a
paradise; it in fact has many
problems.
There is no doubt that Cuba
is a poor country and that some
of its housing is shabby, espe
cially in the rural areas. The
embargo of Cuba has caused a
shortage ot medical supplies,
and consumer items that are
scarce are rationed. That is the
only way to distribute them
fairly. However, most of the
"realistic" problems Pascual
refers to are not the problems
of Cuba.
On agrarian reform he says a
"rural proletariat continues to
exist.' True. Peasants were and

still are one-third ot the rural
population. Those with little or
no land — sharecroppers and
tenant farmers, for example —
were given 66 acre plots. At
the same time the large farms
were collectivised.
What's wrong with that? The
goal of socialism isn't to pro
duce a petite-bourgeoisie.
On education Pascual says
that "quality education" suf
fered as mass illiteracy was
wiped out. Yes, initially literacy
for many people was given
priority over quality education
for fewer people.
What's wrong with that? To
day, students who want to be
teachers are "tracked" early
and combine learning to teach
with actual teaching. To call
this "teenage graduates" given
"crash" courses is misleading.
On women, Pascual says
they were brought into the
labor torce for practical as well
as ideological reasons.
What's wrong with that?
On Havana — true, "once
glamorous" Havana is gone.
Many Americans feel it is drab.
Cone are the glittering casinos,
the hundreds of clubs, swank
hotels with ingratiating maids,
strip-joints, the Syndicate and
drug traffickers.
Why, U.S. businessmen
can't even get the 10 year-old
daughters of poor families fora
price anymore, much less have
them line up for his inspection
as in colorful, old Havana's
brothels.
Yankees who want that kind
of "glamor" have two choices.
Either go to new U.S. play
grounds such as Puerto Rico
where socialism and women's
liberation doesn't stifle "free
enterprise," or wait for a
counter-revolution in Cuba. At
that time women there will re
sume their proper profit
making roles under capitalism
as 1) commodities and 2) cheap
labor.

Action needed
At this point I believe that
more drastic methods must be
used to stop the College Ter
race rapes than simply advising
people to put locks on their
windows and switch boxes.
Why don't the authorities
themselves spend the money
to put on the locks for these
"solitary women" who are the
potential victims?
Police or a committee of
residents could canvass the
neighborhood and install the
locks for those women who
wish them. The women could
pay the cost of the locks, or
part of it should they be very
expensive, and the labor could
be donated by those who best
know how to install the locks.
I also wonder why, after all
that's happened, there doesn't
exist an all-night patrol to keep
watch on at least those houses
where it is known that women
live alone. Handing out leaflets
and having meetings doesn't
seem to be having much affect.
Since the police do have a
composite drawing of this
man, why don't they can vassal I
residences in the area to at
tempt to find him, since they
are almost certain he is a resi
dent.
It might also be helpful to
find out who moves out of Col
lege Terrace within the next
few weeks!
One could gain the impres
sion that, in spite of all the talk
and publicity, the police and
residents are not yet taking the
situation seriously enough to
devote money and people
power to do something con
crete.
This man is very elusive and
may perhaps never get caught;
but at least he can be rendered
impotent by real action.

Marching band
Although loyal Stanford
supporters, we elected to
spend our graduate years at UC
Berkeley, and during the past
few months we have had our
first exposure to a real march
ing band. We feel we must
admit that four years of the
Stanford Band left us totally
unprepared for the dignity and
grandeur of the California
Golden Bear Marching Band.
Certainly we never saw the
dope-addled punks in the
Stanford Band execute the
"Theme from Goldfinger" or
the "1812 Overture" with Cal's
thrilling precision.
The Cal Band exhudes such
style that the soberest of foot
ball fans cannot help but feel
themselves moved to stand up
and get happy right on the
spot.
We sincerely hope that the
Stanford Band can put on a
similar performance on Nov.
17.

Marching band
Although loyal Stanford
supporters, we elected to
spend our graduate years at UC
Berkeley, and during the past
few months we have had our
first exposure to a real march
ing band. We feel we must
admit that four years of the
Stanford Band left us totally
unprepared for the dignity and
grandeur of the California
Golden Bear Marching Band.
Certainly we never saw the
dope-addled punks in the
Stanford Band execute the
"Theme from Goldfinger" or
the "1812 Overture" with Cal's
thrilling precision.
The Cal Band exhudes such
style that the soberest of foot
ball fans cannot help but feel
themselves moved to stand up
and get happy right on the
spot.
We sincerely hope that the
Stanford Band can put on a
similar performance on Nov.

Ticket limit?
I would like to know why
Ram's Head, with only a very
limited number of tickets avail
able for the Friday evening per
formance of Gaieties, has not
limited the number of tickets
any one individual may purch
ase.
This has been the policy of
other organizations on cam
pus: when there is a great de
mand for tickets, rresidder
Ticket Office limits ticket sales
to two per customer, and the
Athletic Department maintains
the same limit on Big Game tic
ket sales.
Wednesday morning I ar
rived at the Gaieties table at
10:10, to be informed that only
30 tickets were still available for
Friday night, and that these tic
kets would go on sale at 10 the
following morning. Thursday
morning I arrived at 9:15, and
found myself sixth in a line
which had formed at 9.
By the time tickets went on
sale, there were roughly 50
people in line, hoping for Fri
day night seats, of which we
were then informed only 21
(not 30) remained.
Since each person was al
lowed to purchase 2 tic kets per
student ID, these 21 seats
were sold before I made my
way to the front of the line.
I know that block ticket sales
are available tor student living
groups, and I took advantage
of this opportunity during the
last two years. I have since
graduated, and I am now a full
time staff member, who has en
joyed very much the Gaieties
shows of the past two years.
It seems to me quite unfair
tnat one person could have
bought those 21 seats, had he
or she 11 student ID s. And no
identification is necessary for
adult tickets, two of which I
would have purchased; I as
sume I could have bought all 21
seats, had I been first in line.
Doesn't it seem much more
equitable to place a limit on the

number of tickets each indi
vidual may purchase?
I did not appreciate waiting 1
hour in line, spending time I
should have spent at work, wait
ing for something I thought
was worthwhile. Being sixth in
line, I had good reason to be
lieve it would be worth the
wait, because I would get tic
kets for a show which I think
has been very well done.
I am not against block ticket
sales for student living groups,
but the limited tickets remain
ing should be distributed a lit
tle more fairly.
It is grossly unfair to exclude
from such activities members
of the Stanford community
who are not students. It's a
shame, since Ram's Head's
productions have been excel
lent in the past, but I've seen
my last Ram's Head show.

Cuban question
Carlos Pascual (D,i//y, Nov. 7)
teels my article on Cuba (Daf/y,
Oct. 30) "should make us
abandon our possessions and
head tor that democratic
paradise."
If facts on infant mortality,
illiteracy, agrarian and urban
reform make him feel that way,
that is his problem. In my arti
cle I said Cuba was not a
paradise; it in fact has many
problems.
There is no doubt that Cuba
is a poor country and that some
of its housing is shabby, espe
cially in the rural areas. The
embargo of Cuba has caused a
shortage ot medical supplies,
and consumer items that are
scarce are rationed. That is the
only way to distribute them
fairly. However, most of the
"realistic" problems Pascual
refers to are not the problems
of Cuba.
On agrarian reform he says a
"rural proletariat continues to
exist.' True. Peasants were and

still are one-third ot the rural
population. Those with little or
no land — sharecroppers and
tenant farmers, for example —
were given 66 acre plots. At
the same time the large farms
were collectivised.
What's wrong with that? The
goal of socialism isn't to pro
duce a petite-bourgeoisie.
On education Pascual says
that "quality education" suf
fered as mass illiteracy was
wiped out. Yes, initially literacy
for many people was given
priority over quality education
for fewer people.
What's wrong with that? To
day, students who want to be
teachers are "tracked" early
and combine learning to teach
with actual teaching. To call
this "teenage graduates" given
"crash" courses is misleading.
On women, Pascual says
they were brought into the
labor torce for practical as well
as ideological reasons.
What's wrong with that?
On Havana — true, "once
glamorous" Havana is gone.
Many Americans feel it is drab.
Cone are the glittering casinos,
the hundreds of clubs, swank
hotels with ingratiating maids,
strip-joints, the Syndicate and
drug traffickers.
Why, U.S. businessmen
can't even get the 10 year-old
daughters of poor families fora
price anymore, much less have
them line up for his inspection
as in colorful, old Havana's
brothels.
Yankees who want that kind
of "glamor" have two choices.
Either go to new U.S. play
grounds such as Puerto Rico
where socialism and women's
liberation doesn't stifle "free
enterprise," or wait for a
counter-revolution in Cuba. At
that time women there will re
sume their proper profit
making roles under capitalism
as 1) commodities and 2) cheap
labor.

Action needed
At this point I believe that
more drastic methods must be
used to stop the College Ter
race rapes than simply advising
people to put locks on their
windows and switch boxes.
Why don't the authorities
themselves spend the money
to put on the locks for these
"solitary women" who are the
potential victims?
Police or a committee of
residents could canvass the
neighborhood and install the
locks for those women who
wish them. The women could
pay the cost of the locks, or
part of it should they be very
expensive, and the labor could
be donated by those who best
know how to install the locks.
I also wonder why, after all
that's happened, there doesn't
exist an all-night patrol to keep
watch on at least those houses
where it is known that women
live alone. Handing out leaflets
and having meetings doesn't
seem to be having much affect.
Since the police do have a
composite drawing of this
man, why don't they can vassal I
residences in the area to at
tempt to find him, since they
are almost certain he is a resi
dent.
It might also be helpful to
find out who moves out of Col
lege Terrace within the next
few weeks!
One could gain the impres
sion that, in spite of all the talk
and publicity, the police and
residents are not yet taking the
situation seriously enough to
devote money and people
power to do something con
crete.
This man is very elusive and

Action needed
At this point I believe that
more drastic methods must be
used to stop the College Ter
race rapes than simply advising
people to put locks on their
windows and switch boxes.
Why don't the authorities
themselves spend the money
to put on the locks for these
"solitary women" who are the
potential victims?
Police or a committee of
residents could canvass the
neighborhood and install the
locks for those women who
wish them. The women could
pay the cost of the locks, or
part of it should they be very
expensive, and the labor could
be donated by those who best
know how to install the locks.
I also wonder why, after all
that's happened, there doesn't
exist an all-night patrol to keep
watch on at least those houses
where it is known that women
live alone. Handing out leaflets
and having meetings doesn't
seem to be having much affect.
Since the police do have a
composite drawing of this
man, why don't they can vassal I
residences in the area to at
tempt to find him, since they
are almost certain he is a resi
dent.
It might also be helpful to
find out who moves out of Col
lege Terrace within the next
few weeks!
One could gain the impres
sion that, in spite of all the talk
and publicity, the police and
residents are not yet taking the
situation seriously enough to
devote money and people
power to do something con
crete.
This man is very elusive and
may perhaps never get caught;
but at least he can be rendered
impotent by real action.

Marching band
Although loyal Stanford
supporters, we elected to
spend our graduate years at UC
Berkeley, and during the past
few months we have had our
first exposure to a real march
ing band. We feel we must
admit that four years of the
Stanford Band left us totally
unprepared for the dignity and
grandeur of the California
Golden Bear Marching Band.
Certainly we never saw the
dope-addled punks in the
Stanford Band execute the
"Theme from Goldfinger" or
the "1812 Overture" with Cal's
thrilling precision.
The Cal Band exhudes such
style that the soberest of foot
ball fans cannot help but feel
themselves moved to stand up
and get happy right on the
spot.
We sincerely hope that the
Stanford Band can put on a
similar performance on Nov.
17.

Ticket limit?
I would like to know why
Ram's Head, with only a very
limited number of tickets avail
able for the Friday evening per
formance of Gaieties, has not
limited the number of tickets
any one individual may purch
ase.
This has been the policy of
other organizations on cam
pus: when there is a great de
mand for tickets, rresidder
Ticket Office limits ticket sales
to two per customer, and the
Athletic Department maintains
the same limit on Big Game tic
ket sales.
Wednesday morning I ar
rived at the Gaieties table at
10:10, to be informed that only
30 tickets were still available for
Friday night, and that these tic
kets would go on sale at 10 the
following morning. Thursday
morning I arrived at 9:15, and
found myself sixth in a line
which had formed at 9.
By the time tickets went on
sale, there were roughly 50
people in line, hoping for Fri
day night seats, of which we
were then informed only 21
(not 30) remained.
Since each person was al
lowed to purchase 2 tic kets per
student ID, these 21 seats
were sold before I made my
way to the front of the line.
I know that block ticket sales
are available tor student living
groups, and I took advantage
of this opportunity during the
last two years. I have since
graduated, and I am now a full
time staff member, who has en
joyed very much the Gaieties
shows of the past two years.
It seems to me quite unfair
tnat one person could have
bought those 21 seats, had he
or she 11 student ID s. And no
identification is necessary for
adult tickets, two of which I
would have purchased; I as
sume I could have bought all 21
seats, had I been first in line.
Doesn't it seem much more
equitable to place a limit on the

number of tickets each indi
vidual may purchase?
I did not appreciate waiting 1
hour in line, spending time I
should have spent at work, wait
ing for something I thought
was worthwhile. Being sixth in
line, I had good reason to be
lieve it would be worth the
wait, because I would get tic
kets for a show which I think
has been very well done.
I am not against block ticket
sales for student living groups,
but the limited tickets remain
ing should be distributed a lit
tle more fairly.
It is grossly unfair to exclude
from such activities members
of the Stanford community
who are not students. It's a
shame, since Ram's Head's
productions have been excel
lent in the past, but I've seen
my last Ram's Head show.

Cuban question
Carlos Pascual (D,i//y, Nov. 7)
teels my article on Cuba (Daf/y,
Oct. 30) "should make us
abandon our possessions and
head tor that democratic
paradise."
If facts on infant mortality,
illiteracy, agrarian and urban
reform make him feel that way,
that is his problem. In my arti
cle I said Cuba was not a
paradise; it in fact has many
problems.
There is no doubt that Cuba
is a poor country and that some
of its housing is shabby, espe
cially in the rural areas. The
embargo of Cuba has caused a
shortage ot medical supplies,
and consumer items that are
scarce are rationed. That is the
only way to distribute them
fairly. However, most of the
"realistic" problems Pascual
refers to are not the problems
of Cuba.
On agrarian reform he says a
"rural proletariat continues to
exist.' True. Peasants were and

still are one-third ot the rural
population. Those with little or
no land — sharecroppers and
tenant farmers, for example —
were given 66 acre plots. At
the same time the large farms
were collectivised.
What's wrong with that? The
goal of socialism isn't to pro
duce a petite-bourgeoisie.
On education Pascual says
that "quality education" suf
fered as mass illiteracy was
wiped out. Yes, initially literacy
for many people was given
priority over quality education
for fewer people.
What's wrong with that? To
day, students who want to be
teachers are "tracked" early
and combine learning to teach
with actual teaching. To call
this "teenage graduates" given
"crash" courses is misleading.
On women, Pascual says
they were brought into the
labor torce for practical as well
as ideological reasons.
What's wrong with that?
On Havana — true, "once
glamorous" Havana is gone.
Many Americans feel it is drab.
Cone are the glittering casinos,
the hundreds of clubs, swank
hotels with ingratiating maids,
strip-joints, the Syndicate and
drug traffickers.
Why, U.S. businessmen
can't even get the 10 year-old
daughters of poor families fora
price anymore, much less have
them line up for his inspection
as in colorful, old Havana's
brothels.
Yankees who want that kind
of "glamor" have two choices.
Either go to new U.S. play
grounds such as Puerto Rico
where socialism and women's
liberation doesn't stifle "free
enterprise," or wait for a
counter-revolution in Cuba. At
that time women there will re
sume their proper profit
making roles under capitalism
as 1) commodities and 2) cheap
labor.
