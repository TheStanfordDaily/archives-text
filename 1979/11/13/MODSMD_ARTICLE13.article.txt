## Rationality only hope in Iran 
### 
The holding of 60 American hostages in
the U.S. Embassy in Iran, upsetting and
emotionally draining to most people in
this country, also tests our ability to come
to terms rationally with an irrational act.
Introductory courses in political scienct
teach that as long as nations act rationally
and can expect others to do likewise, in
ternational incidents such as the one in
Iran will be kept to a minimum. It seemed
like good advice at the time, and it seems
like better advice now, especially tor the
United States and its citizens.
As long as we make no rash moves here
or in Iran, the unfortunate situation in
Tehran will not snowball. Clearly, this is
not the situation in which we can muddle
our stance. And most importantly, irra
tional actions on our part will not breed
rationality in Iran.
The same holds true at this campus.
There are 101 Iranian students here,
mostly graduates in engineering and the
sciences. And, just as not all Americans
approved ot the Vietnam War, many Ira
nians here, and possibly in Iran, deplore
the holding of Americans in Iran.
It is important, both locally and interna

tionally, for people not to allow emotions
to run rampant. Granted, it is frustratingto
stand by impotently while 60 lives are in
danger. But the harrassment of Iranians
here will not ease the situation, nor ease
the minds of many worried Americans.
One of the most distressing problems
the embassy occupation has pointed to is
Congress' unwillingness to bring the Un
ited States out of its current over
dependence on imported oil. Energy legis
lation has been bantered about by Con
gress for more than a year with no substan
tive results.
We praise President jimmy Carter for
acting decisively yesterday by halting all
U.S. imports of Iranian oil. It takes away
one crucial bargaining chip Iran held in its
relationships with the United States.
It is hoped that political candidates and
other interested persons will refrain trom
making political points out of the present
situation in Iran. Charges are being made
that the Iranians are now able to hold the
hostages because ot American military
weakness; the United States' insufficient
support of the Shah of Iran when he was in
power; our willingness to accept the shah

into the country tor medical treatment; a
poorly defended embassy compound;
and weak presidential leadership.
These arguments are absurd. Nothing
short of a full-scale military invasion could
take our military forces to the Tehran Em
bassy, and the 60 hostages would be long
dead by that time. The shah was a poor
national leader. No embassy can be made
into a military stronghold in the center of a
foreign city, and no president could have
prevented the current occupation.
The end result of this incident is in the
hands of diplomats, the students at the
embassy and the Iranian government. To
turn the shah over to the Iranians is un
thinkable. There is no reason to assume
they would stop their demands atter
executing him. Similarly, forcing or even
allowing the shah to go elsewhere to re
ceive his treatment would serve no pur
pose. The Iranians could continue to oc
cupy our embassy or move across town to
the embassy of whatever country would
take him in.
We can only hope that the Iranians in
Tehran will act as a 20th century nation
should. Rationally.
