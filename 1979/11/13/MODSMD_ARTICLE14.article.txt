## Stop the 'railroad' of Bob Avakian 
### 
Nothing — not school, not
the Big Came, not anything —
is as important today as win
ning the battle to stop the rail
road of Bob Avakian.
It has become clear in the
struggle to stop the railroad ot
Avakian that this battle concen
trates the struggle ot the mill

ions ot people in this country
who are tacing daily hell as this
system enters the 1980s.
It has become clear that the
historic West Coast rally on
Nov. 17 will represent much
more than simply a gathering
ot people in protest but a sign
ot the growing discontent ot
millions and their willingness
to stand against the growing
outrages that are heaped upon
them.
We are out to make history
on Nov. 17!
Like a vampire after the man
with the wooden stake, the
U.S. government is moving on
Avakian. They want to put this
man, the chairman of the Re
volutionary Communist Party
(RCP) and the leader of the re
volutionary movement in this
country, in jail tor 100 years.
And they're trying to do this
before most people even know
who he is.
By railroading Avakian, the
government is trying to behead
the revolutionary movement
they see rising in the 1980s.
They will never get away with
it.
Already hundreds and hun
dreds have volunteered to
answer the call ot the RCP
Central Committee to be
amongthe 200 "picked troops"
whose aim is to turn
Washington, D.C., upside
down!
A disciplined battalion ot re
volutionary agitators will fan
out on every street corner and
in every project,making the
struggle to tree Avakian known
to millions and bringing for
ward thousands more to stand
with this fight. As Nov. 19 ap
proaches, this battle will be
discussed more than any other
political question in the capital
city ot American imperialism.
Bob Avakian — he's the man
staring out from the black and
red posters plastered from one
end of the United States to the
other. He and the 16other Mao
Tse-tung defendants, all ot

whom face possible 100 year
sentences, were arrested at a
demonstration in front of the
White House back on )an. 29.
They were protesting the U.S.
visit of Chinese Vice Premier
Deng Xiao-ping (that traitor to
the Chinese people who is
turning China back into a
capitalist Coca-Cola land).
The U.S. government wants
Avakian behind bars. There's
no other way to explain why
what the Washington Post cal
led a "simple five-minute
clash with the police" gave rise
to almost as many charges as
the vicious murders commit
ted by Son of Sam.
It is becoming clear that the
target of the government's at
tack is Avakian. The latest
moves by the prosecution
show they're trying to "prove"
that Chairman Avakian led a
"conspiracy" against the rulers
ot this country by calling for
the demonstration.
Avakian's understanding
was forged in the intense
struggles, in the victories and
defeats, of the 1960s and 19705.
The oppressed people have
brought torth a powerful re
volutionary leader.
Today, as we stare point
blank into the deepening
decay and the growing threat
ot world war, the oppressed
people need such leadership.
The coming decade is going
to force millions to fight.
People will hit the streets burn
ing with rage because millions
can't find work, because mill
ions will face the brutal choice
between eating and heating,
because the youth will be
shoved into green uniforms to
be shot like bullets out of the
imperialists' war machine.
People will fight all this —
but will they do what wasn't
done in the 19605? Will they go
all the way and wipe this sys
tem out?
In the 1980s, for the first time
in many years, people may well
have the chance to rise up

against our ruling class,
weakened and reeling from
crisis and world war, and deal it
the knock-out blow.
The rulingclassot the United
States senses all this, better
than many ot us, and they are
moving now to wipe out the
kind ot tar-sighted revolutio
nary leadership that can guide
the masses of people to vic
tory. That's why they're atter
Avakian.
That's why they've even
trampled on their own so
called "sacred laws" in this
court case. Some ot the counts
include such ridiculous
charges as assault on an "un
identified" police officer. They
held line-ups where four out ot
five of the people were defen
dants, making an identification
like shooting fish in a barrel.
And through all this not a
single cop has yet been able to
identity Avakian as having even
been at the demonstration!
The government is saying
straight out that it they have
their way, none ot their petty
laws is going to stand in the
way of them getting Chairman
Avakian.
On Nov. 19, the defense be
gins a hearing to get this rail
road thrown out. The prosecu
tion will be there too, bending
even their own "sacred laws"
over backwards, trying to in
tensity the attack on Avakian
and all the Mao defendants.
But the main hearing is going
to be in the streets of
Washington, D.C., and cities
around this country.
By the time ot the rally on
Nov. 17, the "picked troops"
on the front lines and people
working in the rear will have
made this a political battle
which will rock the guts of this
country.
Where will you be on that
weekend?
