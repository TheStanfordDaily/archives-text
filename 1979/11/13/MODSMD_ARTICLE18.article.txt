# Cranberry scare: 20 years later
## 
### 
Madison, Wis. (AP) — When people talk turkey
this time of year, they usually talk trimmings,
too. And the trimmings tor most traditional
Thanksgiving dinners will include cranberries.
But 20 years ago, hardly a cranberry graced
any Turkey Day feast in the land. The great cran
berry scare was on — the tirst carcinogen panic
by a public not accustomed to government
warnings ot cancer risks in their food and drink.
The cranberry industry has made more than a
tull recovery in the last two decades, but the
turmoil surrounding the scare all but wrecked
one ot the most unusual and obscure corners of
American agriculture.
The nation's 1000 or so cranberry growers still
regard Nov. 9, 1959, as a (lay ot infamy.
That was the day Health, Education and Wel
fare Secretary Arthur Flemming called a news
conference to warn that aminotriazole, a now
banned herbicide then used lor weed control in
some cranberry bogs, caused cancer in laborat
ory rats.
A reporter asked Flemming it he would eat
cranberries on Thanksgiving.
"He blithely said no," recalls University ot
Wisconsin-Madison horticulture Professor Mal
colm Dana. "As a result ol that adverse publicity,
the cranberry market went kaput. No cranber
ries were sold ior the rest ot the growing sea
son."

The scare was on.
A Cedar Rapids, lowa, woman who had heard
the news on her kitchen radio carried a pan of
cranberries in still-hot water to her neighbor
hood grocery and demanded a retund. She got
it.
Across the nation cranberries were swept
Irom grocery shelves. Many stores refused to
restock even after the government lifted its ban.
Almost lost in the shuffle was the fact
that the herbii ide had been used on only a few
bogs in Oregon and Washington state. Federal
inspectors tested cranberries in six states and
found only a handful of contaminated batches.
Losses averaged several thousand dollars per
grower, no pittance JO years ago in the barren
scrub land and marshes. In Wisconsin, where a
wet year had produced record crops, just 60,000
ol 440,000 barrels of cranberries were sold by
Nov. 9. The rest were buried.
With cranberries and cancer linked in the
public mind, the scare's hangover endured tor
years. The price per barrel was off by 25 percent
through 1%0. Growers were still dumping cran
berries they couldn't sell as late as 1470.
Nine years later, however, cranberry sales had
swelled to $225 million up from about $25
million in 1959, according to |oel Pomerantz, a
spokesman tor Ocean Spray, a cooperative
whose MOO grower-members produce 85 percent
o! U.S. cranberries.
