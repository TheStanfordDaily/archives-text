## Chappie stands against authority 
### 
All manner of miracles seem
to have been bestowed upon
Stanford University this year:
I he ASSU Senate may actually
be taken seriously, the football
team tied USC, and, strange as
it may sound, the Chaparral is
funny.
Whereas most past issues of
this campus' humor (sic)
magazine have featured only
one or two items that elicited a
laugh, the Old hoy has really
brought up the consistency
with the "Authority" issue
being sold today. Don't let the
25-cent price increase bother
you: this effort is finally worth
more than the paper it's
printed on.
The issue's success starts
with the cover, w*here Art
Editor Perry Vasquez offers a
beautifully drawn image of the
lighter side of Moses' moun
tainside meeting.
Inside, the influence of the
new Old Boy, editor Jay Martel,
stands as a major factor in the
success of this issue. His
light-hearted, yet subtly sin
cere, "Reflections" column
sets the tone tor the issue, as
he laments the ebbing of au
thority in "our great land" and
laments even more the pros
pects the future holds.
A delightful parody of "Dear
Abby" follows the "Reflec
tions" column. Anyone who
has followed Abby's advice
through the years as I have
will surely enjoy this one,
which excellentlv satirizes the
perplexing problems which
face some of the inept tools
who turn to America's greatest
social worker for help.
But this magazine really

shines when it turns its cynical
eye to local heroes. Martel and
Vasquez team up on page (i to
create the gem of the issue:
"Swiss Norm Robinson." Vas
quez' brilliant sketches illus
trate the clever story of a ship
wrecked housing magnate (any
resemblance to Stanford's
Housing Czar is not pure coin
cidence).
Before you can catch your
breath, the Chappie gang
throws another winner at you
with "Dead Men Don't Get
Admitted," a tongue-in-cheek,
lack Webb-style mystery, star
ring a certain Admissions Dean
we've all come to know and
love. The picture alone is suit

able for framing and sending
home to mom and dad, and
Sam Kraut's narrative is cap
tivatingly funny.
Martel's Midas Touch re
turns in "Stanford Police
Story," an insightful photo
comic that pokes a little tun at
our true friends in the Police
Services Dept.
The rest of the issue is de
voted to non Stanford
oriented features tnat, if not as
tunny, are creatively and pro
fessionally done. Ex-editor
Bruce Handy, whose obscure,
Steadmanesque cartoon
panels have been a mainstay of
the magazine in the past,
scores with a more expert en

deavor: a parody of a 1984
issue of Time magazine, com
plete with Big Brother and
Newspeak. Orwell would love
it.
Overall, the Chaparral's "Au
thority" issue is a good balance
of slapstick and subtlety. In the
past, issues have depended
too heavily on humor that bor
dered on racism or gross shock
value. These things are taste
fully kept to a minimum this
time, and the result is a clean,
professional product with little
ot the pretentious twaddle that
has been the norm in previous
issues.
