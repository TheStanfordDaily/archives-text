# ACT's Hay Fever is a thimble of laughs
## 
### 
A typical A.C.T. production,
currently playing at the Geary
Theater in ban Francisco, is Hay
Fever. Nice clothes, nice scen
ery, nice touches . . . well, it's
a nice show. It has all the nicety
and conservatism of an A.C.T.
play.
Director Nagle jackson has
used every trick in the book to
make this Noel Coward com
edy a success. The best r.ea
sure of success, besides box
office sales, is the continuation
and addition of A.C.T. sub
scribers. If you are a typical
upper or upper-middle class
lady or gent, then this play's for
you.
And what could ' ><» better for
tin upper (lass than an upper
class play? //di Fever is about a
nobbish, eccentric family —
yes, upper c lass and British as
well who are splendidly ill
mannered, charmingly hostile
and exquisitely arrogant. It has
everything!
At least Coward thought it
did. There is hardly any plot.

Arid from a craftsman's
standpoint, it wouldn't even
qualify as a play. Indeed, the
elements of slapstick and ver
bal sparring make Hay Fever
more of a farce than a comedy.
But still a typical A.C.T. com
edy must provoke laughter.
And Flay Fever does provide a
number of laughs though few
and far between.
Coward, when he wrote Hay
Fever in 1925, intentionally did
lot concern himself with plot.
He was more interested in
people's speech and behavior
towards others. In every line,
there is a superb and comic
understanding of what people
say on the surface and what
they actually believe below
that surface.
For this, Coward was a
genius. And despite the rather
unadventurous treatment,
much of this genius is fortu
nately preserved. Otherwise,
Hay Fever would fall into the
category of the ultra-typical

A.C.T. production: a flat-out
bore.
In this play, especially, how
ever, Coward's mastery ot
dialogue and overtones is only
halt the play. The other half lies
in the non-verbal communica
tion of the characters. The
family/guest tea scene is a
marvelous example, and direc
tor Jackson should be credited.
It is in what's not being said
where Hay Fever excels most.
What plot there is is that
each member of the Bliss fam
ily has invited a guest to stay
with them at their country es
tate in Cookham, which is near
London. What makes this
funny is that none of the Blisses

knew this until the hour before
the guests are scheduled to ar
rive. And, apparently, there is
only one bedroom tor all of
them.
Coward, however, never
solved this problem of over
crowding. All we ever learn is
that each slept separately
though, as anticipated, un
comfortably. However, he has
introduced the disorderly and
very independent nature of the
Bliss household to prepare us
lor their rudeness to the guests
in the second act.
In this act, the guests often
tind themselves alone with
each other and offended by
this absence of hospitality.

Eventually, each guest winds
up with a different Bliss than
the one by whom he or she was
invited. And the histrionic
mother of the family pretends
to marry the newly-formed
couples. When the rest of the
family dramatically fall into
their "marriage" roles, the
guests are shocked and think
them all mad.
The play might have done
better to end there, as the third
ac t is anticlimactic by compari
son The guests <ill sneak out
ol the house as the family is
engaged i. a heated argument
that had lost its meaning five
minutes before. We're re
minded once again that while
H,\y lever is a highly amusing
play, it is still an VC.T produc
tion.
