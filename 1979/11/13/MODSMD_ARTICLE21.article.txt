# Fabulous fiddling foursome

### 
Last Friday night I was
treated to one of the best
string quartet concerts I
have ever heard. Playing be
fore a sold-out Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, the Guarneri
Quartet re-affirmed their
reputation as one of the
foremost quartets in the
world.
Chamber music is
perhaps the most demand
ing type of music to perform
convincingly because it
demands so much from
each individual musician.
Purify of intonation, dazzl
ing virtuosity and the widest
extremes of dynamic and
tonal colors must be as
familiar to the artist as
speaking, and the Guarneri
proved to be more than up
to the challenge, individu
ally and collectively.
Throughout the evening I
was aware of four consum
mate artists blending their
voices into one. Vet despite
this blending, each of the
artists never lost his iden
tity. Again and again I was
amazed as each member of
the quartet found a way to
add his own insights to the
music without subtracting
trom his colleagues' ettorts.
The program opened
with Schubert's Quartet in
G minor, Op. Posth., No. 9.
Written when Schubert was
only 18, the piece clearly re
sembles the quartets of
Haydn and Mozart, while at
the same time it points
strongly to the Schubert
with which listeners are
more familiar.
All things being relative,
this was the least enjoyable
of the evening's offerings.
The problem was not that
the piece was performed
poorly. On the contrary, the
Guarneri played the work
beautifully, lending refined
charm to Schubert's endear
ing melodies.
The problem lay in the
power of the Guarneri
Quartet. The Guarneri has
long been renowned for the
warmth and strength of -its

sound,and throughout the
Schubert I got the feeling
that they had to hold them
selves back from crushing
the delicate music before
them.
However, in the next
piece the Guarneri was able
to cut loose, and the results
were stirring to behold. The
second work on the prog
ram was the Quarter in
D-flat Major, Op. No. 2
by Erno Dohnanyi. Written
in a style typical ot the late
romantic period in which
Dohnanyi lived, the work
gave the Guarneri a magni
ficent opportunity to dis
play its lush, warm sound
and its romantic soul.
The performance show
cased first violinist Arnold
Steinhardt. A concert artist
who made his debut at the
age of 14, Steinhardt
made Dohnanyi's quartet
glow with his wonderful
tone. Particularly memora
ble was Steinhardt's treat
ment of Dohnanyi's
melodies. Playing entirely
on the G-string of his violin,
Steinhardt's tone and his
sense of pacing combined

to haunt the listener with
the beauty of the piece. Also
outstanding was violinist
Michael Tree, whose wonder
fully dark sound proved to
be a marvelous comple
ment to Steinhardt's play
ing.
Alter intermission, the
concert was concluded with
Dvorak's Quartet in C
Major, Opus 61.Here the
Ciuarneri displayed it's vir
tuosity. Each player man
aged to display his consid
erable technical skills,
especially in the finale, yet
throughout, the musicians
paid attention to the won
derful musical ideas Dvorak
provided.
Those who missed the
Cuarneri and wish to have
an opportunity to hear them
will be given another
chance later this season in
February when the Lively
Arts will hold a special tund
raising program. The con
cert will teature both the
Ciuarneri Quartet and the
Vermeer Quartet playing
the works of Beethoven and
Mendelssohn.
