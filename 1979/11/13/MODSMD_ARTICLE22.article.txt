# Other realities of modern art
## 
### 
Do Hurry. One of the most
important sculpture exhibi
tions to be held in this country
is closing on Sunday at the
Museum ot Modern Art in San
Francisco.
"Unknown Beings and
Other Realities" consists of
approximately 60 works by 36
artists, and explores modern
European sculpture between
the two world wars (1918-
1945), probably the only exhib
ition ever to do so.
Dr. Albert Elsen, acting
chairman of the art history de
partment and one of the
foremost scholars of modern
art, organized the exhibit in
conjunction with the
Albright-Knox Gallery in Buf
falo, New York, as a sequel to
his 1973. London exhibition,
which explored the origins ot
modern sculpture in the
period between 1890 and 1918.
The exhibit derives its title
from a paraphrase of
Duchamp-Villon's dictum:
"1 he sole purposoot the arts is
neither the description nor im
itation, but the creation of un
known beings and realities
from elements which are al
ways present but not appa
rent."
As Elsen points out in his
superb catalogue, sculpture

prior to the 20th century im
itated nature, celebrated man
as the center of the universe,
and had as its purpose social,
moral or historical edification.
During the early 20th century,
however, sculptors reacted
against the established
academic traditions of the 19th
century, spurred by scientitic
discoveries which disrupted
older theories ot man's place in
the universe. Representational
accuracy was sacrificed for ex
pression and puritication ot
form.
The period between 1918
and 1945 — regarded as "the
golden age of sculpture" —
was a particularly fruitful one.
Artists participated in explora
tions ot the self, the world, and
art to an unprecedented de
gree, which resulted in a
change in their concepts ot the
world and in their representa
tion of it: the creation ot un
known beings and other
realities. Moreover, artists
such as Laurens, Tatlin, Arp,
Gabo, Giacometti, Ernst,
Moore, Hepworth, Gonzales
and Calder either began, or
turned to, sculpture during
this time.
The exhibition is organized
into four rooms which contain
works going from the figural to

the abstract. The first, domi
nated by Constantin Brancusi's
sleek polished "Golden
Bird," contains an extraction of
what the other three have to
otter. The second room con
tains figural works: Giacomet
ti's "Portrait of the Artist's
Father," Ernst Barlach's "The
Singing Man," Henri Matisse's
"Large Seated Nude," Aristide
Mailk.i s "Torso ot the Isle de
France."
The next has figures which
are more abstract: Henri
Lauren's "Large Seated Wo
man," which resembles a
three-dimensional Matisse
cut-out; Giacometti's large,
black "Spoon Woman," influ
enced by tribal art, Julio Gon
zales' iron "Head," resembling
a globe on an axis, Jacques Jip
chitz' "The Couple" (two fi
gures copulating), resembling
a large turtle, Rudot Belting's
"Organic Form," a mechanistic
figure.
The last room is comprised
ot the very, to the completely,
abstract: Barbara Hepworth's
wooden, egg-shaped "Elegy,"
Alexander Calder's mobile,
"Four Leaves and Three Pet
als," and his wire "Black Spot
on Gimbal's," Ben Nicholson's
"White Relief," and a nice
sampling of Russian Construc
tivist work — Naum Gabo's
"Linear Construction" and his
sweeping "Construction
(Stone With Collar)," Oscar
Schlemmer's "Abstract Fi
gure," a futuristic man ot nic
keled bronze, Georgi
Sternberg's bridge-like "Con
struction in Space," and An
tione Pevsner's "Developable
Column."
Elsen has done a tine job
ot selecting works which are
representative of the varied,
complex — and not necessarily
mutually exclusive — mean
ings, motives and modes ot
representation chosen by the
artists.
The psychological and the
human are represented in Eps
tein's "Portrait of George Ber
nard Shaw" and Kathe
Kollwitz's visage ot a suttering
peasant woman. The spiritual
is depicted by Arp, Hepworth,
Moore and Brancusi, all ot
whom endeavored to repre
sent essences. Cubism is pre
sent in the works by Lipchitz

and Laurens. The fantastic is
represented in Max Ernst's
"Oedipus II" and "An Anxious
Friend," as well as in
Giacometti'swork. Abstraction
is seen in the suprematist art of
Malevich, who believed in the
suprematism of feeling, and in
the Constructivist work of
Gabo, Pevsner and Rodchen
koo, who believed that art
must be constructed on the
elements ol time and space.
Movement, which was new
to sculpture, is reflected in
Calder's mobile and Rodchen
ko's "Suspended Composi
tion." The role of space is seen
to evolve from being that ot
merely surrounding a work to
becoming an integral, formal
element of the work.
Artists' reactions to the war
and tascism are seen in Henri
Lauren's "The Farewell,"
which depicts a figure doubled
over in grief, Gonzales'
"Montserrat Crying II," and in
Picasso's "L'homme au

Mouton" (Man with a Sheep),
which stood in Picasso's studio
to confront the Nazi inter
rogators who paid him weekly
visits. "Mouton" is French
slang tor "informer."
It is altogether an awesome
display.
It would be difficult to single
out certain works for in-depth
descriptions, tor there are too
many worthy, and too much to
be said about them.
Suffice it to say that "Un
known Beings and Other
Realities" presents important
works by important artists,
some ol which have rarely, if
ever, been exhibited in this
country before. It is not to be
missed.

tivist work — Naum Gabo's
"Linear Construction" and his
sweeping "Construction
(Stone With Collar)," Oscar
Schlemmer's "Abstract Fi
gure," a futuristic man ot nic
keled bronze, Georgi
Sternberg's bridge-like "Con

Elsen has done a tine job
ot selecting works which are
representative of the varied,
complex — and not necessarily
mutually exclusive — mean
ings, motives and modes ot
representation chosen by the
artists.
The psychological and the
human are represented in Eps
tein's "Portrait of George Ber
nard Shaw" and Kathe
Kollwitz's visage ot a suttering
peasant woman. The spiritual
is depicted by Arp, Hepworth,
Moore and Brancusi, all ot
whom endeavored to repre
sent essences. Cubism is pre
sent in the works by Lipchitz

and Laurens. The fantastic is
represented in Max Ernst's
"Oedipus II" and "An Anxious
Friend," as well as in
Giacometti'swork. Abstraction
is seen in the suprematist art of
Malevich, who believed in the
suprematism of feeling, and in
the Constructivist work of
Gabo, Pevsner and Rodchen
koo, who believed that art
must be constructed on the
elements ol time and space.
Movement, which was new
to sculpture, is reflected in
Calder's mobile and Rodchen
ko's "Suspended Composi
tion." The role of space is seen
to evolve from being that ot
merely surrounding a work to
becoming an integral, formal
element of the work.
Artists' reactions to the war
and tascism are seen in Henri
Lauren's "The Farewell,"
which depicts a figure doubled
over in grief, Gonzales'
"Montserrat Crying II," and in
Picasso's "L'homme au

Mouton" (Man with a Sheep),
which stood in Picasso's studio
to confront the Nazi inter
rogators who paid him weekly
visits. "Mouton" is French
slang tor "informer."
It is altogether an awesome
display.
It would be difficult to single
out certain works for in-depth
descriptions, tor there are too
many worthy, and too much to
be said about them.
Suffice it to say that "Un
known Beings and Other
Realities" presents important
works by important artists,
some ol which have rarely, if
ever, been exhibited in this
country before. It is not to be
missed.

Do Hurry. One of the most
important sculpture exhibi
tions to be held in this country
is closing on Sunday at the
Museum ot Modern Art in San
Francisco.
"Unknown Beings and
Other Realities" consists of
approximately 60 works by 36
artists, and explores modern
European sculpture between
the two world wars (1918-
1945), probably the only exhib
ition ever to do so.
Dr. Albert Elsen, acting
chairman of the art history de
partment and one of the
foremost scholars of modern
art, organized the exhibit in
conjunction with the
Albright-Knox Gallery in Buf
falo, New York, as a sequel to
his 1973. London exhibition,
which explored the origins ot
modern sculpture in the
period between 1890 and 1918.
The exhibit derives its title
from a paraphrase of
Duchamp-Villon's dictum:
"1 he sole purposoot the arts is
neither the description nor im
itation, but the creation of un
known beings and realities
from elements which are al
ways present but not appa
rent."
As Elsen points out in his
superb catalogue, sculpture

prior to the 20th century im
itated nature, celebrated man
as the center of the universe,
and had as its purpose social,
moral or historical edification.
During the early 20th century,
however, sculptors reacted
against the established
academic traditions of the 19th
century, spurred by scientitic
discoveries which disrupted
older theories ot man's place in
the universe. Representational
accuracy was sacrificed for ex
pression and puritication ot
form.
The period between 1918
and 1945 — regarded as "the
golden age of sculpture" —
was a particularly fruitful one.
Artists participated in explora
tions ot the self, the world, and
art to an unprecedented de
gree, which resulted in a
change in their concepts ot the
world and in their representa
tion of it: the creation ot un
known beings and other
realities. Moreover, artists
such as Laurens, Tatlin, Arp,
Gabo, Giacometti, Ernst,
Moore, Hepworth, Gonzales
and Calder either began, or
turned to, sculpture during
this time.
The exhibition is organized
into four rooms which contain
works going from the figural to

the abstract. The first, domi
nated by Constantin Brancusi's
sleek polished "Golden
Bird," contains an extraction of
what the other three have to
otter. The second room con
tains figural works: Giacomet
ti's "Portrait of the Artist's
Father," Ernst Barlach's "The
Singing Man," Henri Matisse's
"Large Seated Nude," Aristide
Mailk.i s "Torso ot the Isle de
France."
The next has figures which
are more abstract: Henri
Lauren's "Large Seated Wo
man," which resembles a
three-dimensional Matisse
cut-out; Giacometti's large,
black "Spoon Woman," influ
enced by tribal art, Julio Gon
zales' iron "Head," resembling
a globe on an axis, Jacques Jip
chitz' "The Couple" (two fi
gures copulating), resembling
a large turtle, Rudot Belting's
"Organic Form," a mechanistic
figure.
The last room is comprised
ot the very, to the completely,
abstract: Barbara Hepworth's
wooden, egg-shaped "Elegy,"
Alexander Calder's mobile,
"Four Leaves and Three Pet
als," and his wire "Black Spot
on Gimbal's," Ben Nicholson's
"White Relief," and a nice
sampling of Russian Construc
tivist work — Naum Gabo's
"Linear Construction" and his
