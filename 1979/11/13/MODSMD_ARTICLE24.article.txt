Brown announces odd-even
Los Angeles — Gov. Jerry Brown an
nounced yesterday that California will go
back to an odd-even gasoline rationing
program which will be extended statewide.
Brown also said he supports President
jimmy Carter's announcement earlier in the
day that the United States will import no
more oil from Iran.
Brown, who announced his presidential
candidacy last week, said he stands behind
Carter's action and won't try to second
guess the president while 60 Americans are
still being held hostage at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran.
Last spring, 14 ol the largest of California's
58 counties began odd-even rationing after
gas shortages caused lengthy lines at service
stations.
But one by one, all those counties have
discarded the plan. The plan provides that
cars with license plates ending in odd num
bers can buy gas on odd-numbered dates
and vice versa.
"The best and only short-term defense
against capricious actions by oil exporting
nations is conservation," Brown said shortly
betore speaking at a fund-raising luncheon
lor the Equal Rights Amendment.
Oil supplies may decline
Washington — Energy policymakers are
uncertain how President Jimmy Carter's de
cision to halt purchases of Iranian oil will
a I'let t American consumers, but they say it is
possible oil supplies will decline by about 4
percent to 8 percent.
That could be enough to trigger long
gasoline lines again. However, it would be
tar short of the 20 percent shortage that
would trigger gasoline rationing under re
cently passed legislation.
Administration officials, who asked not to
be named, said Americans can compensate
lor the t utolf in Iranian oil by reducing their
average automobile travel by three miles
daily.
Whether prices rise or gasoline lines
reappear on the American scene, they said,
depends on the success ol conservation ef
forts. With proper conservation, "there
should be no cause lor concern, there
should be no cause lor panic," the otficials
cairt

The American Automobile Association re
commended that motorists reduce gasoline
consumption by one or two gallons a week
to make up the ditterence. The AAA also
urged greater use ol mass transit, car pools
and observance of the 55 mph speed limit.
Chlorine still threatens fire
Mississauga, Ontario — Eiremen controlled
a tire in the wreckage ot a chemical-loaded
train yesterday, but police said the con
tinued threat ot an explosion of deadly
chlorine gas meant about 223,000 people
who lied their homes here will have to stay
away at least one more day.
Authorities also warned the 25,000 resi
dents ot adjacent Streetsville to be ready to
leave their homes it the winds continued to
blow northward toward them from the
wreckage.
Ontario Attorney General Roy McMurtry
said yesterday alter touring the site that the
220,000 evacuees trom Mississauga and <000
trom Oakville to the southwest will have to
spend at least another night away trom
home.
"We don't think they will be able to go
back today or tonight — possibly tomor
row,'' added Douglas Burrows, police chief
of the surrounding Peel Region. "... We
still have a propane lire. We don't know
when it's going to be extinguished. We'll
have to let it burn itseli out."
A derailed tanker car carrying the poison
ous chlorine lay perilously close to burning
tankers ol propane gas that exploded alter
the Canadian Pacific freight train derailed
late Saturday in this western Toronto suburb
and sent people tleeing.
Reagan declares candidacy
Ronald Reagan prepared yesterday to
launch his third campaign lor the Republi
can presidential nomination as other candi
dates ol both parties tanned out to court
voters in the East, the South and the Mid
west.
Reagan plans to announce his candidacy
in a speech taped yesterday and televised
tonight on a makeshift network of local tele
vision stations. He'll also deliver the speech
live at a $500-per-plate tund-raising dinner in
New York.
Alter the formal announcement — which

will make him the 10th and presumably the
last candidate lor the Republican
nomination — the 68-year-old tormer
California governor will embark on a five
day, 12-city campaign intended to solidity
his position as the early favorite.
Reagan's three major opponents for the
Republican nomination — former Texas
Gov. John Connally; tormer U.S. Ambas
sador to the United Nations George Bush;
and Senate Minority Leader Howard
Baker — were on the road yesterday.
Baker was meeting reporters in Philadel
phia. Connally was in New Orleans, where

Prop. 1 challenge declined
Sacramento — Attorney General George
Deukmejian has refused the NAACP's de
mand to challenge anti-busing Proposition 1
in court and instead will defend the mea
sure, the civil rights group said yesterday.
Attorney Nancy Reardan, representingthe
NAACP, said Assistant Attorney General
Stephen Porter told the group in a letter that
Deukmejian was representing Secretary of
State March Fong Eu, defendant in a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of Proposi
tion 1.
The attorney general would challenge a
state constitutional amendment approved
by the voters "only it a provision was, as a
matter ol law, unquestionably in violation of
the tederal Constitution," Porter wrote.
Proposition 1, approved by more than a
2-1 vote last Tuesday, limits court-ordered
busing to cases of deliberate segregation, in
line with tederal court rulings. State courts
had ordered segregation ended regardless
ot cause.
Pipeline caused oil drop
New York — While many Americans
waited in gas lines last June, production of
oil from domestic wells was ott significantly,
new government tigures show.
Oil industry officials attribute much ol the
drop to problems with the Alaskan pipeline,
but they are unable to explain the decline

elsewhere.
The production decline in June appears in
just-released Department of Energy (DOE)
statistics. June is the most recent month for
which the DOE has accurate production fi
gures. The figures are based on reports from
,tate energy agencies and data from gov
ernment surveys, rather than oil company
estimates.
According to the figures, crude oil pro
duction from domestic wells in May was
8.585 million barrels a day. It fell in June to
8.409 million barrels daily, a 2 percent de
cline. A barrel contains 42 gallons.
Some industry officials said yesterday that
the drop in production — the second
largest one in a few months — seemed un
usual at a time when the industry was faced
with shortages ol petroleum products.
Teller raps NRC members
San Francisco — Hoover Fellow and nuc
lear power proponent Edward Teller called
yesterday lor the resignations ot members ot
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, saying
they based decisions on political rather than
safety considerations.
"The FAA is not a political football, why
should the NRC be a political football?" Tel
ler said.
"All members ot the NRC should tender
their resignations and be investigated for
knowledge before being allowed to con
tinue," he added.
He said "freedom in the world is doomed''
if "anti-technologists" slow down economic
progress.
Teller also told nuclear industry officials at
the annual conference ot the Atomic Indust
rial Forum that the crippled reactor at Three
Mile Island operated "with near perfection"
despite the "nearly perfect imperfection" ot
the operators.
Teller said that operators should be
trained better and paid more if another
Three Mile Island accident is to be avoided,
noting that they earn about a third less than
airline pilots.
GM recalls 1.3 million cars
Detroit — General Motors Corp. yesterday
recalled 1.5 million full-sized cars to replace
two Iront seat-belt anchor bolts it said could

break under stress.
Spokesman Edward Lechtzin said the No.
1 automaker had received "a few" reports of
bolt failure. He said one driver whose bolt
head broke during a sharp turn sustained
minor injuries.
He said the installation of new bolts by CM
dealers would takeabout2ominutes per car.
The bolts will be replaced at no charge to
owners, GM said.

Prop. 1 challenge declined
Sacramento — Attorney General George
Deukmejian has refused the NAACP's de
mand to challenge anti-busing Proposition 1
in court and instead will defend the mea
sure, the civil rights group said yesterday.
Attorney Nancy Reardan, representingthe
NAACP, said Assistant Attorney General
Stephen Porter told the group in a letter that
Deukmejian was representing Secretary of
State March Fong Eu, defendant in a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of Proposi

The attorney general would challenge a
state constitutional amendment approved
by the voters "only it a provision was, as a
matter ol law, unquestionably in violation of
the tederal Constitution," Porter wrote.
Proposition 1, approved by more than a
2-1 vote last Tuesday, limits court-ordered
busing to cases of deliberate segregation, in
line with tederal court rulings. State courts
had ordered segregation ended regardless
ot cause.
Pipeline caused oil drop
New York — While many Americans
waited in gas lines last June, production of
oil from domestic wells was ott significantly,
new government tigures show.
Oil industry officials attribute much ol the
drop to problems with the Alaskan pipeline,
but they are unable to explain the decline

elsewhere.
The production decline in June appears in
just-released Department of Energy (DOE)
statistics. June is the most recent month for
which the DOE has accurate production fi
gures. The figures are based on reports from
,tate energy agencies and data from gov
ernment surveys, rather than oil company
estimates.
According to the figures, crude oil pro
duction from domestic wells in May was
8.585 million barrels a day. It fell in June to
8.409 million barrels daily, a 2 percent de
cline. A barrel contains 42 gallons.
Some industry officials said yesterday that
the drop in production — the second
largest one in a few months — seemed un
usual at a time when the industry was faced
with shortages ol petroleum products.
Teller raps NRC members
San Francisco — Hoover Fellow and nuc

they based decisions on political rather than
safety considerations.
"The FAA is not a political football, why
should the NRC be a political football?" Tel
ler said.
"All members ot the NRC should tender
their resignations and be investigated for
knowledge before being allowed to con
tinue," he added.
He said "freedom in the world is doomed''
if "anti-technologists" slow down economic
progress.
Teller also told nuclear industry officials at
the annual conference ot the Atomic Indust
rial Forum that the crippled reactor at Three
Mile Island operated "with near perfection"
despite the "nearly perfect imperfection" ot
the operators.
Teller said that operators should be
trained better and paid more if another
Three Mile Island accident is to be avoided,
noting that they earn about a third less than
airline pilots.

Brown announces odd-even
Los Angeles — Gov. Jerry Brown an
nounced yesterday that California will go
back to an odd-even gasoline rationing
program which will be extended statewide.
Brown also said he supports President
jimmy Carter's announcement earlier in the
day that the United States will import no
more oil from Iran.
Brown, who announced his presidential
candidacy last week, said he stands behind
Carter's action and won't try to second
guess the president while 60 Americans are
still being held hostage at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran.
Last spring, 14 ol the largest of California's
58 counties began odd-even rationing after
gas shortages caused lengthy lines at service
stations.
But one by one, all those counties have
discarded the plan. The plan provides that
cars with license plates ending in odd num
bers can buy gas on odd-numbered dates
and vice versa.
"The best and only short-term defense
against capricious actions by oil exporting
nations is conservation," Brown said shortly
betore speaking at a fund-raising luncheon
lor the Equal Rights Amendment.
Oil supplies may decline
Washington — Energy policymakers are
uncertain how President Jimmy Carter's de
cision to halt purchases of Iranian oil will
a I'let t American consumers, but they say it is
possible oil supplies will decline by about 4
percent to 8 percent.
That could be enough to trigger long
gasoline lines again. However, it would be
tar short of the 20 percent shortage that
would trigger gasoline rationing under re
cently passed legislation.
Administration officials, who asked not to
be named, said Americans can compensate
lor the t utolf in Iranian oil by reducing their
average automobile travel by three miles
daily.
Whether prices rise or gasoline lines
reappear on the American scene, they said,
depends on the success ol conservation ef
forts. With proper conservation, "there
should be no cause lor concern, there
should be no cause lor panic," the otficials
cairt

The American Automobile Association re
commended that motorists reduce gasoline
consumption by one or two gallons a week
to make up the ditterence. The AAA also
urged greater use ol mass transit, car pools
and observance of the 55 mph speed limit.
Chlorine still threatens fire
Mississauga, Ontario — Eiremen controlled
a tire in the wreckage ot a chemical-loaded
train yesterday, but police said the con
tinued threat ot an explosion of deadly
chlorine gas meant about 223,000 people
who lied their homes here will have to stay
away at least one more day.
Authorities also warned the 25,000 resi
dents ot adjacent Streetsville to be ready to
leave their homes it the winds continued to
blow northward toward them from the
wreckage.
Ontario Attorney General Roy McMurtry
said yesterday alter touring the site that the
220,000 evacuees trom Mississauga and <000
trom Oakville to the southwest will have to
spend at least another night away trom
home.
"We don't think they will be able to go
back today or tonight — possibly tomor
row,'' added Douglas Burrows, police chief
of the surrounding Peel Region. "... We
still have a propane lire. We don't know
when it's going to be extinguished. We'll
have to let it burn itseli out."
A derailed tanker car carrying the poison
ous chlorine lay perilously close to burning
tankers ol propane gas that exploded alter
the Canadian Pacific freight train derailed
late Saturday in this western Toronto suburb
and sent people tleeing.

Reagan's three major opponents for the

Brown announces odd-even
Los Angeles — Gov. Jerry Brown an
nounced yesterday that California will go
back to an odd-even gasoline rationing
program which will be extended statewide.
Brown also said he supports President
jimmy Carter's announcement earlier in the
day that the United States will import no
more oil from Iran.
Brown, who announced his presidential
candidacy last week, said he stands behind
Carter's action and won't try to second
guess the president while 60 Americans are
still being held hostage at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran.
Last spring, 14 ol the largest of California's
58 counties began odd-even rationing after
gas shortages caused lengthy lines at service
stations.
But one by one, all those counties have
discarded the plan. The plan provides that
cars with license plates ending in odd num
bers can buy gas on odd-numbered dates
and vice versa.
"The best and only short-term defense
against capricious actions by oil exporting
nations is conservation," Brown said shortly
betore speaking at a fund-raising luncheon
lor the Equal Rights Amendment.
Oil supplies may decline
Washington — Energy policymakers are
uncertain how President Jimmy Carter's de
cision to halt purchases of Iranian oil will
a I'let t American consumers, but they say it is
possible oil supplies will decline by about 4
percent to 8 percent.
That could be enough to trigger long
gasoline lines again. However, it would be
tar short of the 20 percent shortage that
would trigger gasoline rationing under re
cently passed legislation.
Administration officials, who asked not to
be named, said Americans can compensate
lor the t utolf in Iranian oil by reducing their
average automobile travel by three miles
daily.
Whether prices rise or gasoline lines
reappear on the American scene, they said,
depends on the success ol conservation ef
forts. With proper conservation, "there
should be no cause lor concern, there
should be no cause lor panic," the otficials
cairt

The American Automobile Association re
commended that motorists reduce gasoline
consumption by one or two gallons a week
to make up the ditterence. The AAA also
urged greater use ol mass transit, car pools
and observance of the 55 mph speed limit.
Chlorine still threatens fire
Mississauga, Ontario — Eiremen controlled
a tire in the wreckage ot a chemical-loaded
train yesterday, but police said the con
tinued threat ot an explosion of deadly
chlorine gas meant about 223,000 people
who lied their homes here will have to stay
away at least one more day.
Authorities also warned the 25,000 resi
dents ot adjacent Streetsville to be ready to
leave their homes it the winds continued to
blow northward toward them from the
wreckage.
Ontario Attorney General Roy McMurtry
said yesterday alter touring the site that the
220,000 evacuees trom Mississauga and <000
trom Oakville to the southwest will have to
spend at least another night away trom
home.
"We don't think they will be able to go
back today or tonight — possibly tomor
row,'' added Douglas Burrows, police chief
of the surrounding Peel Region. "... We
still have a propane lire. We don't know
when it's going to be extinguished. We'll
have to let it burn itseli out."
A derailed tanker car carrying the poison
ous chlorine lay perilously close to burning
tankers ol propane gas that exploded alter
the Canadian Pacific freight train derailed
late Saturday in this western Toronto suburb
and sent people tleeing.
Reagan declares candidacy
Ronald Reagan prepared yesterday to
launch his third campaign lor the Republi
can presidential nomination as other candi
dates ol both parties tanned out to court
voters in the East, the South and the Mid
west.
Reagan plans to announce his candidacy
in a speech taped yesterday and televised
tonight on a makeshift network of local tele
vision stations. He'll also deliver the speech
live at a $500-per-plate tund-raising dinner in
New York.
Alter the formal announcement — which

will make him the 10th and presumably the
last candidate lor the Republican
nomination — the 68-year-old tormer
California governor will embark on a five
day, 12-city campaign intended to solidity
his position as the early favorite.
Reagan's three major opponents for the
Republican nomination — former Texas
Gov. John Connally; tormer U.S. Ambas
sador to the United Nations George Bush;
and Senate Minority Leader Howard
Baker — were on the road yesterday.
Baker was meeting reporters in Philadel
phia. Connally was in New Orleans, where

Prop. 1 challenge declined
Sacramento — Attorney General George
Deukmejian has refused the NAACP's de
mand to challenge anti-busing Proposition 1
in court and instead will defend the mea
sure, the civil rights group said yesterday.
Attorney Nancy Reardan, representingthe
NAACP, said Assistant Attorney General
Stephen Porter told the group in a letter that
Deukmejian was representing Secretary of
State March Fong Eu, defendant in a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of Proposi
tion 1.
The attorney general would challenge a
state constitutional amendment approved
by the voters "only it a provision was, as a
matter ol law, unquestionably in violation of
the tederal Constitution," Porter wrote.
Proposition 1, approved by more than a
2-1 vote last Tuesday, limits court-ordered
busing to cases of deliberate segregation, in
line with tederal court rulings. State courts
had ordered segregation ended regardless
ot cause.
Pipeline caused oil drop
New York — While many Americans
waited in gas lines last June, production of
oil from domestic wells was ott significantly,
new government tigures show.
Oil industry officials attribute much ol the
drop to problems with the Alaskan pipeline,
but they are unable to explain the decline

elsewhere.
The production decline in June appears in
just-released Department of Energy (DOE)
statistics. June is the most recent month for
which the DOE has accurate production fi
gures. The figures are based on reports from
,tate energy agencies and data from gov
ernment surveys, rather than oil company
estimates.
According to the figures, crude oil pro
duction from domestic wells in May was
8.585 million barrels a day. It fell in June to
8.409 million barrels daily, a 2 percent de
cline. A barrel contains 42 gallons.
Some industry officials said yesterday that
the drop in production — the second
largest one in a few months — seemed un
usual at a time when the industry was faced
with shortages ol petroleum products.
Teller raps NRC members
San Francisco — Hoover Fellow and nuc
lear power proponent Edward Teller called
yesterday lor the resignations ot members ot
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, saying
they based decisions on political rather than
safety considerations.
"The FAA is not a political football, why
should the NRC be a political football?" Tel
ler said.
"All members ot the NRC should tender
their resignations and be investigated for
knowledge before being allowed to con
tinue," he added.
He said "freedom in the world is doomed''
if "anti-technologists" slow down economic
progress.
Teller also told nuclear industry officials at
the annual conference ot the Atomic Indust
rial Forum that the crippled reactor at Three
Mile Island operated "with near perfection"
despite the "nearly perfect imperfection" ot
the operators.
Teller said that operators should be
trained better and paid more if another
Three Mile Island accident is to be avoided,
noting that they earn about a third less than
airline pilots.
GM recalls 1.3 million cars
Detroit — General Motors Corp. yesterday
recalled 1.5 million full-sized cars to replace
two Iront seat-belt anchor bolts it said could

dealers would takeabout2ominutes per car.
The bolts will be replaced at no charge to
owners, GM said.
