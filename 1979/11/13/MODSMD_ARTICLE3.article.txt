# Prof sees boom in DNA research

Recombinant DNA research — gene splicing —
is alive and well on the Stanford campus.
Ip fact, according to one of the local scientists
who suggested the potential risks of the research
to the public, recombinant DNA research is
"booming."
Dr. Paul Berg, professor of biochemistry at the
Medical Center, heads one of two special P-3
laboratories on campus where recombinant DNA
research is done. Dr. Stanley Cohen, chairman of
the Department o. Genetics, oversees the other
lab, which, like Berg's, is located deep in the inner
recesses of the Medical Center.
Both men were among 11 scientists who, in
1974, wrote a letter that discussed the possible
hazards of recombinant DNA research. The letter,
which was sent to three scholarly publications,
sparked an international furor.
"At the time we spoke out, it was clear that
genes (components of DNA that encode heredit
ary characteristics) from a toad could be intro
duced into a bacterium and propagated as a re
combinant DNA molecule," Berg said.
Foreign gene concern
The scientists were concerned about the con
sequences of possible spreading ot certain bac
teria carrying foreign genes. Berg stressed that
most of the life forms created by genetic engineer
ing cannot live outside the laboratory environ
ment. Scientists could, however, sometimes work
with genetic material from toxic organisms. Today
this research must be performed in a unique P-4
lab run by the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md. The P-4 lab has more rigorous
safety standards than P-3 labs.
The most common bacterium used in recom

binant DNA research today is Escherichia coli K-12,
a laboratory-bred organism akin to bacteria in the
human digestive tract, but which cannot live in
humans. In 1974, though, scientists were not sure
which bacteria could be used as hosts tor foreign
genes.
"We were worried about something happening
through ignorance, and we wanted to heighten
the consciousness of scientists who might become
; .ivolved in recombinant DNA research," Berg
said. "That has been accomplished. Now, the con
struction ol a truly dangerous recombinant would
have to be done deliberately and with malice in
mind."
Media craze
A "media event" followed the scientists' expres
sion of concern. National news magazines ran
cover illustrations of mad scientists and DNA
molecules sprouting vipers with dripping fangs.
"I would have to fault some of the press for all
the hysteria, Berg said. "I don't regret doing what
we did (writing the letter), but I do regret the way it
turned out."
What turned out was a considerable delay in the
progress of recombinant DNA research, as well as
several hundred pages of federal regulations gov
erning the research.
Bureaucratic web
Berg said the extensive guidelines are an unfor
tunate outcome of the "horrible bureaucracy"
which arose in response to the controversy. The
guidelines, mandatory only for institutions con
ducting federally subsidized research, specify re
straints for the laboratories where recombinant
DNA research is performed and prescribe the
specific molecules that can be used in the work.
The P-3 labs built here in the mid-1970s are

among some two dozen of their kind on university
campuses in the United States. A P-3 lab looks
much like any other biochemistry laboratory but is
equipped with a special air filtration system to
keep the air pressure in the lab slightly lower than
normal — so when a door is opened air flows in,
not out.
Because the guidelines have undergone almost
continuous amendment, much recombinant DNA
work previously performed in a lab P-3 lab can now
be executed in a P-2 level lab. This is a "careful" lab
without the added equipment of a P-3, according
to Dr. Henry Erlich, who teaches a course entitled
"Recombinant DNA: Biological Principles,
Sociological Consequences, and Philosophical
Implications" as part of the University's program
in human biology.
Going home
Current work in Berg's lab searches for a
technique to return recombinants to animal cells.
Monkey cells are now being considered for this
process.
Scientists in both Stanford labs said they regard
recombinant DNA techniques as a crucial research
tool in gaining an understanding of the com
plexities of life, disease mechanisms and healing.
Berg said that private industry in the 1980s will
play an increasing role in recombinant DNA re
search. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed
to hear a case involving the commercial patenting
of newly created life forms. The case was brought
by the justice Department after patents were
granted to Upjohn Co. for an organism used in
preparing the antibiotic lincomycin and toGeneral
Electric Co. for a bacterium which "eats" oil spills
by breaking down petroleum components as they
float on the ocean.
