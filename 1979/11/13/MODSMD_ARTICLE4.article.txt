# Carter halts Iranian oil imports; no help for Tehran hostages
## 
### Associated Press 
President Jimmy Carter halted oil
imports from Iran yesterday, declar
ing that America will not bow to
economic pressure or terrorism in its
efforts to protect "the lives ot our
people" held hostage at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran.
Carter said he was cutting off Ira
nian oil imports, which account tor at
least 4 percent of daily American
consumption, "to eliminate any
suggestion that economic pressures
can weaken our stand on basic issues
of principle."
He said the Iranians who have held
the embassy and 60 Americans hos
tage since Nov. 4 are trying "to force
unacceptable demands on our coun
try."
Tehran radio later said Khomeini's
Revolutionary Council already had
decided to cut off exports to the Un
ited States before Carter's an
nouncement.
The dramatic moves came as con
tlicting signals emerged in Tehran
about whether progress was being
made in negotiations for the release
of a reported 98 hostages held by
students at the U.S. Embassy in the
Iranian capital.
A three-man Palestinian negotiat
ing team gave up its efforts and left

Tehran, the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization said. But Abolhassan
Banisadr, Khomeini's toreign affairs
chief, announced that Iran's Re
volutionary Council would discuss
"a proposal concerning the Ameri
can Embassy."
Radio Tehran did not describe the
proposal, saying it would be di
vulged once the council approves it.
Banisadr and other Iranian leaders
reaffirmed their country's central
demand — that the United States
hand over the exiled Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi to stand trial in Iran
for his life.
Khomeini's regime had new trou
ble on the home front. The Iranian
news media reported unemployed
Iranians took over two government
-ninistries in Tehran to demand jobs.
"American does face a difficult
task and a test," Carter said as he
announced the oil cutoff in his na
tionally broadcast statement. "Our
response will measure our character
and our courage. I know that we
Americans will not fail."
He said it was vital to all the nations
ot the world "that the lives of dip
lomatic personnel and other citizens
abroad be protected and that we re
fuse to permit the use of terrorism
and the seizure and-the holding of
hostages to impose political de
mands."
His decision apparently covers
both oil bought trom Iran and re
fined products trom third countries.
It so, it amounts to 700,000 barrels a
day — 3.5 to 4 percent ot total U.S. oiJ
consumption. The actual impact was
unclear.
U.S. officials said they believe a
pooling arrangement set up by
Western nations after the 1973-74
Arab oil boycott will go into effect.
But some oil experts pointed out the
crisis plan was established to counter
export reductions of 7 or more per
cent, and does not address itself to
the case of a member nation unilat
erally halting imports.
Specialists also pointed out that
the complicated structure ot the
world oil market may mean Carter's
actions have little real effect on
supplies. Iranian oil could simply
flow into the wide-open "spot" mar
ket and eventually be tunneled
anonymously into the U.S. pipeline.
Whether or not it has a major
economic impact on the United
States or Iran, the U.S. move did one
thing — strip Khomeini of one o! his
major weapons, the threat of an oil
embargo.
The three envoys trom the PLO,
which has good relations with the re
volutionary regime of Moslem cler
gyman Khomeini, had been viewed
by many as the best hope for freeing
the 62 American and 36 non-
American hostages seized when the
student militants took over the em
bassy Nov. 4.

Tehran, the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization said. But Abolhassan
Banisadr, Khomeini's toreign affairs
chief, announced that Iran's Re
volutionary Council would discuss
"a proposal concerning the Ameri
can Embassy."
Radio Tehran did not describe the
proposal, saying it would be di
vulged once the council approves it.
Banisadr and other Iranian leaders
reaffirmed their country's central
demand — that the United States
hand over the exiled Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi to stand trial in Iran
for his life.
Khomeini's regime had new trou
ble on the home front. The Iranian
news media reported unemployed
Iranians took over two government
-ninistries in Tehran to demand jobs.
"American does face a difficult
task and a test," Carter said as he
announced the oil cutoff in his na
tionally broadcast statement. "Our
response will measure our character
and our courage. I know that we
Americans will not fail."
He said it was vital to all the nations
ot the world "that the lives of dip
lomatic personnel and other citizens
abroad be protected and that we re
fuse to permit the use of terrorism
and the seizure and-the holding of
hostages to impose political de
mands."
His decision apparently covers
both oil bought trom Iran and re
fined products trom third countries.
It so, it amounts to 700,000 barrels a
day — 3.5 to 4 percent ot total U.S. oiJ
consumption. The actual impact was
unclear.
U.S. officials said they believe a
pooling arrangement set up by
Western nations after the 1973-74
Arab oil boycott will go into effect.
But some oil experts pointed out the
crisis plan was established to counter
export reductions of 7 or more per
cent, and does not address itself to
the case of a member nation unilat
erally halting imports.
Specialists also pointed out that
the complicated structure ot the
world oil market may mean Carter's
actions have little real effect on
supplies. Iranian oil could simply
flow into the wide-open "spot" mar
ket and eventually be tunneled
anonymously into the U.S. pipeline.
Whether or not it has a major
economic impact on the United
States or Iran, the U.S. move did one
thing — strip Khomeini of one o! his
major weapons, the threat of an oil
embargo.
The three envoys trom the PLO,
which has good relations with the re
volutionary regime of Moslem cler
gyman Khomeini, had been viewed
by many as the best hope for freeing
the 62 American and 36 non-
American hostages seized when the
student militants took over the em
bassy Nov. 4.
