# Moving the campus toward a barrier free environment
## 
### Grant Finlayson 
John Poshauer is a six foot, two inch 200-pound
former all-league high-school lineman. Now he uses
his powerful shoulder and arm muscles to propel his
wheelchair around the Stanford campus.
When he was a freshman at UC-Berkeley five years
ago, a car accident on Highway 101 left him parap
legic.
Posthauer's physical limitations, however, give him
needs that an ambulatory student doesn't have.
Ramps are needed to get over curbs and ascend short
flights of stairs; elevators are needed for longer
flights and supporting railings are necessary in bat
hrooms.
Some $500,000 was budgeted last year for a campus
remodelling project aimed at making all Stanford
programs accessible to physically limited students.
The project is about 20 percent completed, Project
Manager Vojke Ivanek said.
Ramps to Quad buildings and curb cuts to ac
comodate wheelchairs at key points all over campus
have been finished, she said. The remodelling of
selected bathrooms in the buildings has just begun,
she said. According to Associate Provost Wayne
Price, the bulk of the work is scheduled for comple
tion by next summer.
Expanding numbers
Due in part to medicine's increased ability to ex
tend life, the number of physically limited Americans
is growing. An estimated 500,000 are in wheelchairs,
with thousands more disabled by blindness, deafness
and other limitations.
At the University, "only 11 or 12" students have
identified themselves to the administration as physi
cally limited, said Price. He declined to estimate how
many others there are, but one physically limited
student said there might be as many as 50. UC-
Berkeley, with an established, well-known commun
ity of physically limited people nearby, has more than
200 such students enrolled.
Paralleling public awareness of the civil rights of
racial minorities and women, consciousness of the
needs of the physically limited has been growing
gradually. In 1973, Congress passed the Rehabilita
tion Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a

physical handicap "under any program or activity re
ceiving Federal financial assistance" in the same way
that Title IX prohibits educational discrimination on
the basis of sex.
Committee formed
According to Price, the University's efforts to meet
the needs of physically limited students began four or
five years ago when President Richard Lyman ap
pointed Price to establish the Advisory Committee on
the Physically Limited, including faculty, staff and
students.
Price said the committee attempted at first to re
spond to needs as they arose — and since then has
developed a more organized approach to campus
remodelling with the "intention of making all prog
rams accessible" to limited students.
Characterizing the committee's approach as one of
"practical common sense," Price stressed that the
aim of remodelling has not been the complete acces
sibility of all buildings but of all University programs.
An adequate number of buildings will be made acces
sible and classes with limited students will be shifted
to those buildings when necessary to accomodate the
needs of the students in the class.
Judgment needed
"Every building doesn't have to be accessible, but
every program must be," Price said. He added that
decisions as to what constitutes adequate facilities
"require judgment," and will vary depending upon
the size of the physically limited community at Stan
ford.
He expects the size of that community to grow, he
said, "as we do a better job of letting people know we
welcome physically limited students."
Another committee, the Dean of Student Affairs'
Committee on Physically Limited Students, has
worked on services to the physically limited. It
printed a guide map for the physically limited for the
first time this year along with a pamphlet describing
University policy and detailing available services.
Those services include locating physically limited
students in accessible housing and arranging readers
for the taping of class readings for blind students.
Incoming students desiring should con
tact Associate Dean of Student Affairs Harold Boyd,

who coordinates them. Committee-member Betty
Miller of the Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) arranges taping for the blind at Meyer Library.
The CPPC also offers specialized career planning
services for physically limited students.
Boyd said that temporarily disabled students are also
eligible for services — including the use of golf carts
administered by the Cowell Health Center.
'Creative solutions'
Physically limited students interviewed said they
are mostly pleased with the increasing accessibility of
the campus to wheelchairs, and some expressed ad
miration for the "creative and thoughtful solutions"
worked out by Ivanek and the remodelling project.
Boyd said the committees' solutions to problems
"were not always ahead of the game, but I think that
whenever a matter was brought to the University's
attention, there was immediate and — I hope —
adequate response."
Price admitted, however, that there remain unre
solved problems, some that need greater student
awareness for solution. One problem students can
help to alleviate is that of bicycles left in walkways and
obstructing doorways. Blind students have expressed
great frustration at trying to maneuver around
thoughtlessly placed bikes.
In academics, in addition to the taping services, a
Braille computer terminal was installed at the LOTS
computer center. Optacon instruments —
developed by University Electrical Engineering Prof.
John Linvill to convert visual print to a tactile print that
can be felt with the fingers — are available through
Cowell.
The SAE fraternity on campus is mounting a fund
raising drive as this year's annual pledge service pro
ject to help finance reading facilities in the new annex
of Green Library.
Boyd said he would like to create "greater aware
ness . . . better respect, better appreciation for li
mited students." Increased numbers of limited
students will be "a good thing — good for Stanford,''
said Price, adding that the University can only benefit
from the increased diversity and talent brought by
"remarkable people who happen to be physically
limited."

tact Associate Dean of Student Affairs Harold Boyd,

who coordinates them. Committee-member Betty
Miller of the Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC) arranges taping for the blind at Meyer Library.
The CPPC also offers specialized career planning
services for physically limited students.
Boyd said that temporarily disabled students are also
eligible for services — including the use of golf carts
administered by the Cowell Health Center.
'Creative solutions'
Physically limited students interviewed said they
are mostly pleased with the increasing accessibility of
the campus to wheelchairs, and some expressed ad
miration for the "creative and thoughtful solutions"
worked out by Ivanek and the remodelling project.
Boyd said the committees' solutions to problems
"were not always ahead of the game, but I think that
whenever a matter was brought to the University's
attention, there was immediate and — I hope —
adequate response."
Price admitted, however, that there remain unre
solved problems, some that need greater student
awareness for solution. One problem students can
help to alleviate is that of bicycles left in walkways and
obstructing doorways. Blind students have expressed
great frustration at trying to maneuver around
thoughtlessly placed bikes.
In academics, in addition to the taping services, a
Braille computer terminal was installed at the LOTS
computer center. Optacon instruments —
developed by University Electrical Engineering Prof.
John Linvill to convert visual print to a tactile print that
can be felt with the fingers — are available through
Cowell.
The SAE fraternity on campus is mounting a fund
raising drive as this year's annual pledge service pro
ject to help finance reading facilities in the new annex
of Green Library.
Boyd said he would like to create "greater aware
ness . . . better respect, better appreciation for li
mited students." Increased numbers of limited
students will be "a good thing — good for Stanford,''
said Price, adding that the University can only benefit
from the increased diversity and talent brought by
"remarkable people who happen to be physically
limited."
John Poshauer is a six foot, two inch 200-pound
former all-league high-school lineman. Now he uses
his powerful shoulder and arm muscles to propel his
wheelchair around the Stanford campus.
When he was a freshman at UC-Berkeley five years
ago, a car accident on Highway 101 left him parap
legic.
Posthauer's physical limitations, however, give him
needs that an ambulatory student doesn't have.
Ramps are needed to get over curbs and ascend short
flights of stairs; elevators are needed for longer
flights and supporting railings are necessary in bat
hrooms.
Some $500,000 was budgeted last year for a campus
remodelling project aimed at making all Stanford
programs accessible to physically limited students.
The project is about 20 percent completed, Project
Manager Vojke Ivanek said.
Ramps to Quad buildings and curb cuts to ac
comodate wheelchairs at key points all over campus
have been finished, she said. The remodelling of
selected bathrooms in the buildings has just begun,
she said. According to Associate Provost Wayne
Price, the bulk of the work is scheduled for comple
tion by next summer.
Expanding numbers
Due in part to medicine's increased ability to ex
tend life, the number of physically limited Americans
is growing. An estimated 500,000 are in wheelchairs,
with thousands more disabled by blindness, deafness
and other limitations.
At the University, "only 11 or 12" students have
identified themselves to the administration as physi
cally limited, said Price. He declined to estimate how
many others there are, but one physically limited
student said there might be as many as 50. UC-
Berkeley, with an established, well-known commun
ity of physically limited people nearby, has more than
200 such students enrolled.
Paralleling public awareness of the civil rights of
racial minorities and women, consciousness of the
needs of the physically limited has been growing
gradually. In 1973, Congress passed the Rehabilita
tion Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a

physical handicap "under any program or activity re
ceiving Federal financial assistance" in the same way
that Title IX prohibits educational discrimination on
the basis of sex.
Committee formed
According to Price, the University's efforts to meet
the needs of physically limited students began four or
five years ago when President Richard Lyman ap
pointed Price to establish the Advisory Committee on
the Physically Limited, including faculty, staff and
students.
Price said the committee attempted at first to re
spond to needs as they arose — and since then has
developed a more organized approach to campus
remodelling with the "intention of making all prog
rams accessible" to limited students.
Characterizing the committee's approach as one of
"practical common sense," Price stressed that the
aim of remodelling has not been the complete acces
sibility of all buildings but of all University programs.
An adequate number of buildings will be made acces
sible and classes with limited students will be shifted
to those buildings when necessary to accomodate the
needs of the students in the class.
Judgment needed
"Every building doesn't have to be accessible, but
every program must be," Price said. He added that
decisions as to what constitutes adequate facilities
"require judgment," and will vary depending upon
the size of the physically limited community at Stan
ford.
He expects the size of that community to grow, he
said, "as we do a better job of letting people know we
welcome physically limited students."
Another committee, the Dean of Student Affairs'
Committee on Physically Limited Students, has
worked on services to the physically limited. It
printed a guide map for the physically limited for the
first time this year along with a pamphlet describing
University policy and detailing available services.
Those services include locating physically limited
students in accessible housing and arranging readers
for the taping of class readings for blind students.
