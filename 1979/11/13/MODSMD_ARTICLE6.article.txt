# Earthquake fault analyzed

St. Louis (AP) — Mention of
the notorious San Andreas
fault sparks images of cracked
earth, trembling skyscrapers
and the dread that half ot
California may one day crum
ble into the Pacific Ocean.
-Mention ot the New Madrid
tault is likely to raise only eye
brows and prompt puzzled
looks.
Yet many scientists now con
sider the New Madrid tault
zone — a five-state region in
the mid-Mississippi Valley — as
the nation's most threatening
earthquake belt.
A major quake today in that
area would inflict up to 10
times the damage ot a similar
quake along the San Andreas
fault, according to recent
studies by seismologists at St.
Louis University.
The tault zone touches
southeastern Missouri, south
ern Illinois, western Kentucky
and Tennessee and northeast
ern Arkansas. Within a 160-
mile radius of New Madrid,
Mo., lie the cities ot St. Louis,
Memphis and Nashville,
Tenn., and Evansville, Ind.,

with a combined metropolitan
population of more than 4 mill
ion.
It's here that American ear
thquake legend was born.
Only a few pioneers and In
dians inhabited the southeast
ern Missouri Bootheel area in
mid-December 1811 when the
most severe earthquake in U.S.
history virtually swallowed the
village of New Madrid, Mo.,
and leveled every building
within a 50,000-square-mile
area.
The Mississippi River, tossed
from its bed and onto the hill
sides, swept away entire
torests.
The quake — actually a series
of about 2000 tremors lasting
more than three months —
rumbled throughout the lower
half ot the continent.
Although it struck before
measuring devices were in
vented, scientists calculate the
1811 quake would have regis
tered about 7.6 on the Richter
scale.
Today, scientists say evi
dence is mounting that
another major quake could

strike the region at any time. If
so, the potential loss ot life and
property has grown more than
a million times.
Scientists say cities would
suffer devastating losses, if not
total destruction, in a quake as
severe as the great quake ot
1811.
Despite the hazards it pre
sents, surprisingly little is
known about the New Madrid
zone, thought to be a system of
deeply buried faults which
trigger frequent earthquake
activity within a 250-mile radius
of New Madrid.
The 7.6 Richter measure
ment ot the 1811 quake is less
than theB.s reading in the 1%4
Alaska quake or the 8.3 calcu
lated for the 1906 San Francisco
quake. But scientists say the
New Madrid quake actually
was more severe than those
because ot differences in the
tault zones.
Sean-Thomas Morrissey,
who heads seismology re
search at the university,
explained the difference in po
tential destructiveness.
Unlike the San Andreas fault,
parts of which are exposed at
the earth's surface, faults
within the New Madrid zone
are buried under 2000 to H)00
feet of river sediment, he said.
This allows a quake's shock
waves to travel much farther
and with far greater force than
in California.

measuring devices were in
vented, scientists calculate the
1811 quake would have regis
tered about 7.6 on the Richter
scale.
Today, scientists say evi
dence is mounting that
another major quake could

strike the region at any time. If
so, the potential loss ot life and
property has grown more than
a million times.
Scientists say cities would
suffer devastating losses, if not
total destruction, in a quake as
severe as the great quake ot
1811.
Despite the hazards it pre
sents, surprisingly little is
known about the New Madrid
zone, thought to be a system of
deeply buried faults which
trigger frequent earthquake
activity within a 250-mile radius
of New Madrid.
The 7.6 Richter measure
ment ot the 1811 quake is less
than theB.s reading in the 1%4
Alaska quake or the 8.3 calcu
lated for the 1906 San Francisco
quake. But scientists say the
New Madrid quake actually
was more severe than those
because ot differences in the
tault zones.
Sean-Thomas Morrissey,
who heads seismology re
search at the university,
explained the difference in po
tential destructiveness.
Unlike the San Andreas fault,
parts of which are exposed at
the earth's surface, faults
within the New Madrid zone
are buried under 2000 to H)00
feet of river sediment, he said.
This allows a quake's shock
waves to travel much farther
and with far greater force than
in California.


New wave band
Members of Mr. Clean, a new wave rock band from San Francisco,

the band's music as "incredible" while a senior labeled Mr. Clean's
performance as "unpleasant noise."
