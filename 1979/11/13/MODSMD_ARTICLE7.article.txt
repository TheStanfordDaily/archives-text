# Banks offer loan by mail

### 
New York (AP) — Money is ti^ht. You've heard
about the tight money policy ot the Federal* Re
serve Board, and then you read that installment
credit surged $4.45 billion in September, a re
cord tor any month.
And you receive this unsolicited letter from
one of the world's largest financial institutions:
"I have enclosed a Request Certificate made
out to you in the amount ot $2500. Simply till out
the back of the Certificate and mail it to me . . .
"Feel tree to use the $2500 as you see tit . . .
perhaps now you can take that special vacation
trip you've been thinking about tor so long."
You might even reinvest the money and make
an after-tax return on your money sufficient to
repay the loan and leave you a profit, says the
letter writer, and he offers suggestions on how
to do it.
"The tact of the matter is that we have done
our utmost to make it extremely attractive for
vou to get cash from Chase right now, even
though you are not a customer ot ours at (ire
sent," the letter states.
Most banks, says the writer, Thomas Harmon,
vice president, Chase Manhattan Bank, "would

soy they want to do business with a person like
you. In this instance we are 'putting our money
where our mouth is.'
"Personally, I think it's one of the best moves
we've made."
Tight money? Hardly, at least for consumer
loans in some areas. Not when lenders can earn
relatively high interest on small, short-term
loans. Not when banks are seeking more of the
retail business.
Besides, retail customers, or consumers,
often bring with them other business, such as
savings and checking accounts, and they're
candidates also for the bank's credit card and
various other services.
Letters such as Chase's aren't uncommon. A
Chase spokesman explains that the recipient's
name comes from a mailing list company that
offers a "specific list of pre-approved custom
ers."
He explained: "Thingsare tight right now, but
the way we look at it, the situation is fairly short
term." Rates and other factors will ease soon, he
said, "and we want these tolks as our custom
ers."
