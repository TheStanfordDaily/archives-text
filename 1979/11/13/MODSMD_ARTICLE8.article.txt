# KZSU: More than animals at 'The Zoo'
## 
### Ellen Ablow 
The Zoo,' located in the
basement of Memorial Au
ditorium, otters the south bay
and the University much more
than the usual menagerie of
exotic animals.
Operated by students here,
"The /oo" programs a large
variety ot music, news, sports
and public affairs.
"The Zoo" is K/SU, the Uni
versity's student radio station.
At 90.1 on the I M dial and 88 on
AM, K/SU operates 24 hours a
day, seven days a week during
the school year.
K/SU-AM, a training station,
is heard in most University
dorms, and the FM station is
heard trom South San Fran
cisco to San )ose.
"It you are interested in tele
vision or radio you learn more
down here than in any clas
sroom on campus," according
to Dayna (ioldtine, the sta
tion's program director.
Communication majors,
however, are not a majority at

"The /oo." Students from al
most all majors are involved
with K/SU, according to
Goldfine.
Since May 1978, K/SU has
been operating on 500 watts.
This increase, from 10 watts be

fore that time, established
KZSU as a class A, non
commerical FM station. This
status requires K/SU to oper
ate under the same restrictions
as non-student stations.
According to Mike Dimar

tino, station manager, the Uni
versity student body here gives
KZSU "very little recognition."
Most listener input comes
from outside the Stantord
community, he said.
"College radio is thought of
as a bunch of squeaky kids
playing with equipment," he
said. "This is not true with
KZSU. By the middle of the
quarter, a listener cannot tell
the difference in quality bet
ween KZSU and other com
mercial FM."
Due to expense, Dimartino
said it is not feasible to run a
listener's survey to calculate
the size of KZSU's audience.
But the dramatic increase in
song and program requests
demonstrates the enlarged au
dience since the watt increase
a year and a half ago, he said.
A large audience is not the
main goal of KZSU, said
Goldfine. "Being the number
one station forages 18-22 in the
Bay Area is not important to us.
Creativity and quality are. We
want to provide the listener
with an alternative to the
commercial FM stations."
Along with quality, KZSU st
rives tor enthusiasm, accord
ing to Dimartino. "D|s and an
nouncers do not come to us
with experience, just interest.
Alter learning the basics, they
are put on the air.
Public services
Programming at KZSU is a
"balance of principles," ac
cording to Goldtine/'There is a
high percentage ot public ser
vices and minority shows that
only cater to a tew. But they are
very important to those who
listen."
To encourage involvement
trom inexperienced students,
KZSU has a class each Monday
night. Students learn aspects
ot broadcasting and are given
time on the AM station.

News at K/SU is broadcast
seven times a day, and is re
ported and written by stu
dents. A UPI tic ker is used tor
national stories. Though the
news show is the department's
major emphasis, two weekly
news specials, "Campus Con
ference" (an interview show)
and "Thirty Minutes" (an in
vestigative news program) are
also heard over K/SU.
The sports department pre
sents live broadcasts of toot
ball, basketball and baseball
games. The department also
broadcasts a sports clip after
the news, and has two specials,
"Sports Hotline" and "Cardi
nal Corner."
Public Affairs, the most var
ied department, produces at
least 14 programs. Among
them are French, Italian and

other foreign language prog
rams; shows on Asian and
black concerns a women's
show; and two i omedy shows.
