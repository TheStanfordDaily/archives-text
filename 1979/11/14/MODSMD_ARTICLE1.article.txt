# Morland raps nuclear secrecy at noon rally
## 
### Brad Crystal 
The U.S. government exploits nuc
lear secrecy to promote dubious
weapons projects without popular
consent, anti-nuclear activist How
arc! Morland told a group of about
150 at a noon rally yesterday in White
Plaza.
Morland, author of this month's
Progressive magazine article, "The
H-Bomb Secret: How we got it, why
we're telling it," warned that "unless
you can lift up that curtain of secrecy
and look at the nuts and bolts of what
the people in the nuclear weapons
and nuclear power systems are do
ing, we are forever going to be sitting
around waiting for (the government)
to spring one surprise after another
on us."
Morland's speech was the featured
event of the hour-long rally marking
the fifth anniversary of Karen
Silkwood's death on Nov. 13, 1974.

Silkwood, a worker at a Kerr-McGee
Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Plant in
Oklahoma, died in a car accident just
before she was to deliver to a New
York Times reporter evidence of
safety violations in the Oklahoma
City plant.
After spending a year traveling ac
ross the country in search of the hyd
rogen bomb "secret," Morland said
he concluded that technical aware
ness is essential in ensuring public
participation in the nuclear
decision-making process.
Morland stressed the inextricable
connections between nuclear power
and nuclear weapons, claiming the
latter gave birth to the former.
"To understand these connections
you have to understand the basic de
sign principles of these weapons out
of which power) grew,"
Morland said.
As examples ol the government's

inappropriate and concealed use ol
nuclear energy, Morland cited the
construction of three large gaseous
diffusion enrichment plants in
Paducah, Ky., Oakridge, Tenn. and
Piketon, Ohio.
According to Morland, these
plants were built in the early 1950s tor
weapons purposes without the
knowledge or permission ot the
American people. The plants al
together consumed 7000 megawatts
of electricity 24 hours a day for 10
years, he said.
He said these facilities were useo
lor energy purposes only after they
were no longer needed to produce
solely weapons materials.
The rally began with a 15-minute
speech by Lyuba Zarsky representing
the Coalition to Stop Uranium Min
ing.
Zarskv called attention to the no

tential genocide ot Indians living on
reservations where uranium mining
takes place. Many Indians are dying
of cancer as a result of their exposure
to the uranium mines and the6o mill
ion tons of radioactive waste piles
the mines have generated, according
to Zarsky.
The rally was part of a two-day
program called "Nuclear Power and
Nuclear Weapons: Why No Nukes?"
sponsored by Roses Against a Nuc
lear Environment, the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau, the Abalone Alliance and
the University of California Weapons
Labs Conversion Project.
