## American claims Tehran embassy escape 
### 
Longview, Wash. (AP) — A
man who says he escaped from
the U.S. Embassy in Iran as it
was being seized by Moslem
militants has told a newspaper
that at least eight other Ameri
cans escaped and probably are
hiding in Tehran.
Kim King, 26, who said he
lived in Iran for about six
months, told the Longview,
Wash., Daily News that U.S.
State Department officials
seemed surprised that anyone
escaped from the embassy dur
ing the takeover Nov. 4 in
which 98 persons, including

about 60 Americans, were
taken hostage.
The 98 were still being held
yesterday, and details of the
takeover are sketchy. It has not
been reported previously that
any Americans escaped.
State Department sources
reached last night by The As
sociated Press refused to
comment on King's account ot
the takeover or his alleged es
cape.
"I think the whole episode
has been blown out ot propor
tion — most Iranians are good

people," King told the news
paper in an interview pub
lished yesterday.
King arrived at the
Clatskanie, Ore., home of his
parents Sunday, tired but in
good condition, the news
paper said. He was interviewed
Monday.
He told the newspaper he
was at the embassy the day of
the takeover because he had
lost his visa and exit papers.
When the unarmed militant
students arrived, he told the
newspaper, they surged onto
the embassy grounds.
He told the newspaper he
and 30 other persons — includ
ing nine Americans — were on
the second floor of one of the
embassy buildings.
"A Marine pushed out one
student who tried to crawl in a
window and then two or three
rounds of tear gas were fired,"
King was quoted as saying.
Then the Iranian guard un
locked the gates, he said.
"No one tried to break into
our building, but the power
was cut off. We waited about
two hours, and then it started
pouring rain. When we still
didn't see anyone, we went
outside in small groups and
started walking. Not running,
just walking," King told the
newspaper.
Two Marines were in his
group of about six people who
escaped, King said, adding he
assumed the other Americans
are hiding in Tehran.
King told the newspaper he
later went to Iranian customs
and said he wanted to return to
the United States but had lost
his papers. The officials gave
him 14 days to leave Iran,
charging him $800 for a visa and

other exit papers, King told the
newspaper.
King told the newspaper he
caught a British Airways flight
out of Iran last Friday, adding
that he was interviewed by U.S.
officials in London. He was
asked to return to Washington,
D.C., and the government paid
his fare, King told the news
paper.
He said he had been touring
Europe and entered Iran about
six months ago. "I ran out of
money and took a job teaching
English to businessmen there.
English is very popular, just as
most of the people are pro-
American," he was quoted as
saying.
