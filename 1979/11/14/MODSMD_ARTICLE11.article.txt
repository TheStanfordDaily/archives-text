Washington (AP) — Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, acting at his
wife's behest, ordered an im
mediate U.S. airlift of special
food for children and other
supplies yesterday to In
dochinese refugee camps in
Thailand.
Rosalynn Carter, who visited
the camps last week, an
nounced the presidential ac
tion when she detailed her re
commendations for helping
thousands of sick and starving
refugees.
"We cannot losetime," she
told a White House gathering
of executives from interna
tional relief agencies. "The
situation is urgent."
Mrs. Carter announced that
the president also approved
these other recommenda
tions:
—An immediate $2 million

grant to UNICEF to buy rice for
the refugees, whose food sup
ply was said to be less than 30
days.
—An increase in the number
of refugees from Thailand to be
resettled in the United States.
Hereafter, most of the monthly
quota of 14,000 refugees al
lowed into America will be fil
led from Thai refugee camps
rather than among the boat
people in Malaysia and Hong
Kong.
—$4 million for the care and
maintenance of refugee
camps.
—A review of the refugee re
settlement process, which is
said to take too long.
The airlift will contain veget
able oils and other food to
meet the nutritional needs of
the refugees, many of whom
suffer from malnutrition.
It also will include mobile
equipment to provide water
for refugee camps and equip
ment to improve communica
tion between camps and relief
agencies in Bangkok, Mrs. Car
ter said.
"There will be at least one
shipment immediately and if
we need more we will do it,"
said Richard Holbrooke, assis
tant secretary of state for Far
East and Asian affairs. He ac
companied Mrs. Carter on her
journey and helped prepare
her report to the president.
An emergency task lorce at
the State Department was
working Tuesday to locate the
necessary lood and arrange for
the flight to Bangkok. It has not
been determined exactly when
it will occur.
Holbrooke said all of the
money to implement the re
commendations comes out of
Carter's $69 million pledge to
help the refugees and other
emergency funds.
