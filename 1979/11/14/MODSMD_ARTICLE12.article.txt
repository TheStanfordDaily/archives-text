# Israel threatens to deport Arab mayor

Tel Aviv, Israel (AP) â€” Nablus
Mayor Bassam Shakaa lost an
appeal Monday to be freed
from jail pending hearing on a
government attempt to expel
him trom the occupied West
Bank. Other Arab mayors
threatened to quit if he is ex
pelled.
Shakaa, a fiery Palestinian
nationalist, was arrested Sun
day by the Israeli military gov
ernment pending a still un
scheduled deportation hearing
for making what the Israelis
said were pro-terrorist com
ments, a contention he de
nied.
An injunction had delayed
his expulsion and he appealed
to the Supreme Court, arguing
the injunction should have
prevented authorities from jail

ing him, but the high court dis
agreed. No reason was given
for the arrest.
The expulsion order,
coupled with the cabinet's de
cision on Sunday to build an
undetermined number of new
Jewish settlements in occupied
Arab territory, sparked re
newed anti-Israeli feeling
throughout the West Bank of
the Jordan River.
Arab businesses in Nablus
were closed Monday to protest
Shakaa's jailing and an Israeli
carwas stoned in Ramallah. No
injuries were reported.
But the most immediate
threat to calm among the West
Bank's 700,000 Arabs was the
resolve by mayors to resign en
masse unless Shakaa's depor
tation is canceled.
