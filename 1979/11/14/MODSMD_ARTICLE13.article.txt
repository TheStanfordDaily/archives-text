# State education officials report decline in student writing skills
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) — California's 12th
graders continue to falter in statewide
academic tests, and one reason apparently
is that they aren't doing much writing,
state school officials reported Thursday.
Results of standardized tests in reading,
spelling, language use and mathematics in
the last school year were announced to the
state Board of Education, and as in previ
ous years, high school seniors sounded
the only sour note.
Third and sixth-graders kept up their
small but steady gains, while 12th-graders
showed a slight decline in reading, no
change in spelling, and small improve
ments in mathematics and language use,
the Department of Education said.
In comparison to national average
scores, established by test publishing
companies several years ago, California
third-and sixth-graders were slightly

higher and 12th-graders were substantially
lower.
But actually, when publishers bring
those averages up to date in the near fu
ture, California students probably will be
around the middle, simply because there
are so many of them, the department said.
One finding in the report is likely to
strengthen the beliefs among many
educators that one reason most students
don't write well is that they don't write
enough.
Twelfth-graders, who were given the
tests last December, were asked how
many reports or essays they'd been asked
to write in the previous six weeks.
More than 20 percent said they'd had no
writing assignments — and that group
scored 10 points less in the language use
test, on a scale of 100, than the 12 percent
who said they had written six to 10 reports
or essays.

The same connection appeared be
tween scores in language use and the
number of years of English taken. New
local requirements to take more English in
high school should improve the scores,
the department said.
The tests, prepared specially for
California schools, were given to 905,000
students in the last school year. Compar
ing the scores to the performance of other
students on identical tests in 1977-78, the
department found:
—Third-graders averaged 0.2 percent
higher on reading, the only test they took.
—Sixth-graders were up 0.5 percent in
reading, language use and mathematics
and up 0.4 percent in spelling.
—Twelfth-graders were down 0.1 per
cent in reading, unchanged in spelling,
and up 0.2 percent in language use and 0.3
percent in math.
