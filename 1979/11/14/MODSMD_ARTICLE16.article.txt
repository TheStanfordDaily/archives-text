# The 						life of the Tree: hot under her collar
## 
### Suzi Alexander 
Alumni moan for "the
good old days," minority
groups balk at racism, and a
majority of University stu
dents are tired of the same
old debate.
But Meredith Fondahl is
doing something about it â€”
she has been for nearly two
years.
She is the infamous tree.
Many people have won
dered who lurks beneath
the 6Vi feet of greenery, but
probably more wonder why
that person is there.
Meredith has two simple
answers: "I was frustrated
and I love to dance."
Frustration
A local from Los Altos
Hills, Meredith grew up
supporting the Stanford In
dians, but says she eventu
ally became aware that such
a controversial mascot was
not viable. According to
Meredith, her frustration
has come from watching the
University flounderover the
issue for so long.
"I think it's funny that it's
taken so much energy to
decide on a mascot, after
the Thunder Chickens and
the Robber Barons . .
When it comes to a seri
ous mascot, Meredith is
more hesitant. "Sure, the
tree is cute, but it's not
grand enough," she says."I
mean the football players
have lots of pride and every
thing." She says she sees
the Sequoia as perhaps a
"grander" extension of this
"cute" idea, but beyond
that, she's "as lost as the
rest of us."
Band keeps her 'watered'
One thing she is sure of is
that it gets hot under her
foliage contraption. "Some
times I think it must be over

a hundred degrees in there.
It gets pretty tough, espe
cially when we have pre
game and postgame rallies.
"But the hand takes good
care of me," she says. "1 hey
keep me watered. We've fi
gured out a way to get
drinks up under the cos
tume."
The only problem is what
to do when graduation ends
the era of Meredith's reign.
When she took over from
the two who had shared the
position before her, it was a
simple matter. She had
been indicating interest for

nearly a year, was able to go
home in three weeks and
whip up a costume, and, as
she puts it"it was summer
and nobody was around."
Forest of potential trees
But now . . . "Almost 100
people have come to talk to
me, wanting to be trees,"
Meredith says.
The selection process
remains unclear, but
Meredith thinks the tree will
continue to grace the field
tor "about two or three
years, or until this whole
(mascot) thing is cleared up
once and for all."
