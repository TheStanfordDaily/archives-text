## Energy monopolies threaten America 
### 
Teddy Roosevelt must be turning over in
his grave. Despite the noble efforts of this
former president, well known for "speak
ing softly but carrying a big stick" earlier in
this century, we remain plagued by an
enemy which he fought valiantly to over
come. Roosevelt, among others of his
time, recognized the hazards which large
corporations and monopoly control in in
dustry posed to the welfare of the nation,
and strongly encouraged anti-trust legisla
tion.
Years have passed, and an increasingly
technological society has rendered virtu
ally every American citizen dependent
upon a new commodity for his or her daily
existence: energy.
Without it, we could not heat or light
our homes, travel to and from work, or
enjoy many of our present luxuries; the
American lifestyle as we know it would
perish, and complete economic collapse
would be inevitable.
As these facts have been brought to at
tention in recent years by temporary
energy shortages, it has also become ap
parent that our supply comes from a
monopoly.
While competition once existed at the
gasoline pump, the initial petroleum shor
tage of 1974 forced nearly all independent
owners out of business.
Simultaneously, by temporarily forcing
the "addicted" American driver to do
without his "fix" we were more willing to

accept gasoline prices of 60 to 70 cents per
gallon when availability returned to nor
mal.
More recently, as the price of foreign oil
has continued to climb, American oil
companies have followed suit, and pump
prices have climbed to over $1 per gal
lon. The American consumer has no
choice but to pay such prices, as for most,
gasoline is a virtual necessity.
In the face of a known fuel shortage,
high prices are perhaps the best means to
discourage wasteful consumption, and
the oil companies' control over prices and
allocation are less objectionable.
However, several news stories have ap
peared in recent weeks which de
monstrate clearly detrimental effects of
the American energy monopoly. It is a fact
that home heating oil and the fuel used to
power jet aircraft come from a common
petroleum precursor.
The oil companies have discovered that
the latter commands a higher profit, and
that the current shortage precludes meet
ing demands in both areas. Thus, Texaco
recently announced that it may not sell
home heating oil in 14 northern states this
winter. Similarly, Shell threatened identi
cal action to affect New Hampshire, where
a large number of homes presently utilize
heating oil.
Clearly, this "fly now freeze later"
strategy on the part of our petroleum
suppliers is not in the best interest of the

American people; for many, the winter of
1980 may be the coldest yet, simply be
cause there is more money to be made
elsewhere.
Other examples of the growing energy
monopoly are not difficult to find. It is a
fact that the majority of American uranium
mines are owned and operated by major
oil companies; this natural resource is vital
to nuclear power plants.
That the petroleum giants are not the
only guilty parties is evident; consider the
absence of competition and consumer al
ternative in purchase of natural gas and
electricity.
The threat currently posed by the
energy trust in America is more serious
than those experiences during Roosevelt's
time, simply because energy cannot be
done without.
If a few profit-hungry individuals are al
lowed to control the use ot this precious
resource, then by definition they will con
trol American itself. Thus, a clear indica
tion exists for legislative intervention by
the federal government, to insure that
energy usage in the future is in the best
interest of the American people.
The issue of federal control over energy
supply and demand should be a major
point of discussion in the 19H0 presidential
election process.
