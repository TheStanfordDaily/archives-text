## Grievance review needed 
### 
In April 1978, the University
instituted a new grievance pro
cedure. One year ago this
month, I wrote in the Daily that
the procedure had not been
reviewed by the Committee on
Faculty and Staff Affairs (C
-FSA.)
In March 1978, I asked the
Committee if it would review
the new procedure, and I was
advised that the committee
. . had a full program for the
foreseeable future."
On August 1 of this year, I
wrote a memo to the chairman
of the C-FSA, asking if the
committee would review the
procedure this academic year;
I also met with the chairman of
the committee at that time. He
advised me that the C-FSA
would be meeting the follow
ing week, and he would raise
my request at that time.
On August 27, after not hav
ing heard from the chairman, I

again wrote a memo to him,
asking about the C-FSA's re
sponse to my request. I have
yet to hear from the chairman
or the C-FSA to this date, three
months later.
There are twoconcerns.One
concern is that the procedure
was authored solely and clan
destinely by the Personnel Of
fice without ever being re
viewed by the C-FSA.
A procedure of such impor
tance should not be enacted
without being reviewed by the
proper committee, and the
C-FSA is that committee in this
instance. And the "Report of
the Ombudsman for 1978-79"
has warned that "the general
dissatisfaction in the secreta
rial staff has been further ag
gravated by a change in the
grievance procedure available
to them." This same procedure
applies to the exempt staff,
who should also begin think

ing about forming a union.
The second concern is that
the C-FSA, from all indications,
refuses to accept its respon
sibilities in this matter.
The refusal of the C-FSA to
address this issue can be inter
preted as negligence, abdica
tion of responsibility, arro
gance or all of the above. Such
actions, or the lack thereof,
often result in the formation of
unions, which the University
seems to be inviting.
As responsible employees,
perhaps the first step might be
tor concerned readers — stu
dents, faculty as well as staff —
to write the president of the
University, urging that there be
a public review of the grie
vance procedure by the C-FSA
this academic year, and that an
advisory opinion be submitted
to him and to the general pub
lic.
