The title of Howard Morland's
November Progressive magazine ar
ticle "The H-Bomb Secret: How we
got it, why we're telling it" raises the
question foremost in many people's
minds — how did Morland obtain in
formation from public sources that
would lead the Dept. of Justice to
block the story's publication?
The lustice Department filed suit
March 26 but dropped the case in
September after another letter trom
Charles Hansen describing the
H-bomb was published in the Madi
son, Wise. Press Connection. Han
sen, a computer programmer from
Mountain View, obtained his inlor
mation solely from public sources, as
did Morland.
According to Morland, ascertain
ing the identity of the H-bomb secret

was easier than one might expect.
Scientists nationwide unwittingly
shared intormation with him, as long
as he was able to cultivate their intel
lectual egos, he explained.
"Scientists can't resist telling you
you're tull of shit if you're way off
base — they don't conceal their con
tempt when you're wrong. So you
very quickly eliminate what the in
correct ideas are."
Morland said he could tell when he
was getting close to the truth when
the scientists stopped showing their
contempt for his ideas and began to
display worry.
In addition to conversations with
scientists, Morland said he was
greatly aided by several declassified
documents, including Hoover Fel
low Edward Teller's 1969 Encyc
lopedia Americana article on the

workings ot the H-bomb and its ac
companying diagram.
Before Morland could begin his
research, he said he had to convince
himselt that H-bomb information
"wasn't none of my business."
He justified his inquiry by "my
basic objection to the small concent
ration of power controlling the nuc
lear industry. The decision-making
process must be made by the group
whom the decision affects," he said.
Morland criticized the United
States for engaging in nuclear
blackmail. He claimed the United
States has used its pervasive nuclear
threat to wield power over other
countries.
"The United States has been doing
for 30 years what Iran is doing right
now," Morland said.
