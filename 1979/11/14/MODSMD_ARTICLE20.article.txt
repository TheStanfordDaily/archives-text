# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Richard Stromme Rescue Governor Stanford 
### 
The Stanford University Ad
ministration has made a seri
ous mistake in agreeing to run
over the historic Central Pacific
steam engine, "Governor Stan
ford," to the California De
partment of Parks and Recrea
tion for "display" in a railroad
"museum" in "Old" Sac
ramento.
The bad design and hazard
ous location of the museum
will result in certain damage to
or eventual destruction of the
Governor Stanford. Mean
while, the public will be pre
vented from seeing or photo
graphing the locomotive be
cause it will be mislocated in
side a dark, cramped and inac
cessible building.
The incompetent depart
ment of bureaucrats failed to
apply the first principle of
museum operation — protec
tion and preservation of the ar
tifacts — in the "design" of

their project. As a conse
quence of their irresponsible
action the following hazards
constitute grave danger to the
long-term preservation of the
Governor Stanford:
1) A freeway bridge is located
about 50 feet north of the
building.
2)A Southern Pacific (SP)
branchline passes about 100
feet west of the building.
3)The SP double track main
line is located about 200 feet
north of the building.
Thousands of train carloads
and truckloads of toxic, caustic
and explosive products pass
through the area daily on these
heavily-used traffic arteries.
There are thousands of acci
dents occurring yearly around
the nation involving these
hazardous cargos, many caus
ing widespread devastation of
property and large loss of life.
All it will take in the future is

one truck carrying gasoline fal
ling off the freeway bridge ancj
exploding, or a train wreck or
derailment causing the exploi
sion of several carloads of
liquified petroleum gas or
other products, and the Gov-,
ernor Stanford will be trans
formed into scrap metal.
4)Old Sacramento is located
downstream from three major
dams and several more are
planned.
Within the next 100 years a
dam collapse caused by inter
nal weaknesses or earthquake
can be expected, resulting in
damage to, the destruction and
disappearance of the Governor
Stanford as it is washed
downstream to points west.
It is essential that the Gover
nor Stanford be rescued from
certain destruction at Old Sac
ramento.
