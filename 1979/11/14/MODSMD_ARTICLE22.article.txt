# Letters to the editor: Clerical organizing

### 
Blunt message
This is a blunt message to my
co-workers out there: sec
retaries, office assistants,
clerks of all kinds, accoun
tants, data aides, library assis
tants and others whose clas
sifications I don't have know
ledge of. Time is running out.
You need to come to a deci
sion.
Do you want a collective
bargaining unit of office staff?
Do you want to negotiate a
legal contract with the Univer
sity which will cover your
needs?
Do you want to change the
situation of clericals at this uni
versity; do you want to have
some control over your wages
and advancement oppor
tunities?
Or do you want to let this
unique opportunity go by and

just passsively accept your pre
sent situation for the rest of
your working life?
We need 300 more (blue) au
thorization cards in order to
petition the National Labor Re
lations Board for recognition as
a clerical bargaining unit.
There is a deadline. This
campaign cannot dragon inde
finitely. The longer we wait to
petition, the longer it will be
before we can have an election
and the longer to have a con
tract.
The longer we wait, the more
of us who have already signed
cards will have/eft the Univer
sity!
The longer we wait, the more
we give the advantage to the
University and to those who
would not like us to have the
power of a collective bargain
ing unit!
For all our sakes, send those

cards to U.S.E. now, and ask
your co-workers to do the
same! A handtul ot organizers
can't do the job for you; you
must all pitch in.
And write to us, via the
U.S.E. office or directly to me,
or to the Daily and Campus Re
port; let us know what you
would like to see covered in
the contract we will have.
Start now to give us your
ideas, to tell us of your prob
lems, of your needs. Come to
our Tuesday evening meetings
(7 p.m., Room 82 of Graduate
School of Business) and help
us get our contract proposals
together, bring up the issues
which concern you, and find
our more about the organizing
committee.
Time is a-wasting!

Lest readers infer from Kris
tine Dean's letter {Daily, Nov.
8) that my husband is an up
ward bound Stanford man and
that I wrote my letter feeling
very smug and completely in
sensitive to how the other half
lives, such is not the case.
I went through a very bad
decade here when I had not
one but three young children
to feed, clothe and house. We
had no savings because we had
lived in Europe until we came
to California.
My husband was free
lancing at the time which
necessitated international
travel so it took all his fees to
pay his living expenses and
some fares. It wasn't until Sept.
1970 that he decided to accept
a position with a regular salary
but by that time our eldest was
ready for college and in a few
years our second child was also
college-bound.
I didn't even have a car when
I started to work at Stanford
and had to rely on the
Greyhound bus which brought
me to the Palo Alto station.
From there I walked to my of
fice. There were peanut butter
sandwiches for dinner many
times and there were other
things we did without but the
family survived.
Perhaps I was better con

ditioned for adversity since I
was a child during the Great
Depression. My college educa
tion went down the drain then
because money that was put
aside for that was lost. Dean
has had college training. We
rise above adversity or we wal
low in it.
I did not say that working
conditions here were perfect
— are they anywhere in any
field? But a union is not the
answer.
Secretaries and clerical

workers: Do you want to walk a
picket line? If so, who is going
to pay your rent, buy your
food, clothes and gasoline —
not the union!
Union bosses are the only
ones who benefit from unions
at the workers' expense. Statis
tics prove that workers never
make up the money they lose
during a strike and I've had ac
tual proof from relatives who
had to go on strike.
Let's see if there isn't
another way to rectify some of

the inequities. Why not send
some comments to me or the
Daily.

Real question
In response to Larry
Diamond's column ("Ap
preciate plight of clerical
staff," Daily, Nov. 6), may I
point out that the first part of

his article argues tor a living
wage based on expenses of the
wage-earner, which should be
of noconcern totheemployer.
What should be the only
concern is that the employee is
paid appropriately for the type
of work done; the injustice is
that the woman is not paid
what a man would be paid for
that secretarial or clerical job.

This is a blunt message to my
co-workers out there: sec
retaries, office assistants,
clerks of all kinds, accoun
tants, data aides, library assis
tants and others whose clas
sifications I don't have know
ledge of. Time is running out.
You need to come to a deci
sion.
Do you want a collective
bargaining unit of office staff?
Do you want to negotiate a
legal contract with the Univer
sity which will cover your
needs?
Do you want to change the
situation of clericals at this uni
versity; do you want to have
some control over your wages
and advancement oppor
tunities?
Or do you want to let this
unique opportunity go by and

just passsively accept your pre
sent situation for the rest of
your working life?
We need 300 more (blue) au
thorization cards in order to
petition the National Labor Re
lations Board for recognition as
a clerical bargaining unit.
There is a deadline. This
campaign cannot dragon inde
finitely. The longer we wait to
petition, the longer it will be
before we can have an election
and the longer to have a con
tract.
The longer we wait, the more
of us who have already signed
cards will have/eft the Univer
sity!
The longer we wait, the more
we give the advantage to the
University and to those who
would not like us to have the
power of a collective bargain
ing unit!
For all our sakes, send those

cards to U.S.E. now, and ask
your co-workers to do the
same! A handtul ot organizers
can't do the job for you; you
must all pitch in.
And write to us, via the
U.S.E. office or directly to me,
or to the Daily and Campus Re
port; let us know what you
would like to see covered in
the contract we will have.
Start now to give us your
ideas, to tell us of your prob
lems, of your needs. Come to
our Tuesday evening meetings
(7 p.m., Room 82 of Graduate
School of Business) and help
us get our contract proposals
together, bring up the issues
which concern you, and find
our more about the organizing
committee.
Time is a-wasting!

Lest readers infer from Kris
tine Dean's letter {Daily, Nov.
8) that my husband is an up
ward bound Stanford man and
that I wrote my letter feeling
very smug and completely in
sensitive to how the other half
lives, such is not the case.
I went through a very bad
decade here when I had not
one but three young children
to feed, clothe and house. We
had no savings because we had
lived in Europe until we came
to California.
My husband was free
lancing at the time which
necessitated international
travel so it took all his fees to
pay his living expenses and
some fares. It wasn't until Sept.
1970 that he decided to accept
a position with a regular salary
but by that time our eldest was
ready for college and in a few
years our second child was also
college-bound.
I didn't even have a car when
I started to work at Stanford
and had to rely on the
Greyhound bus which brought
me to the Palo Alto station.
From there I walked to my of
fice. There were peanut butter
sandwiches for dinner many
times and there were other
things we did without but the
family survived.
Perhaps I was better con

ditioned for adversity since I
was a child during the Great
Depression. My college educa
tion went down the drain then
because money that was put
aside for that was lost. Dean
has had college training. We
rise above adversity or we wal
low in it.
I did not say that working
conditions here were perfect
— are they anywhere in any
field? But a union is not the
answer.
Secretaries and clerical

workers: Do you want to walk a
picket line? If so, who is going
to pay your rent, buy your
food, clothes and gasoline —
not the union!
Union bosses are the only
ones who benefit from unions
at the workers' expense. Statis
tics prove that workers never
make up the money they lose
during a strike and I've had ac
tual proof from relatives who
had to go on strike.
Let's see if there isn't
another way to rectify some of

the inequities. Why not send
some comments to me or the
Daily.

Real question
In response to Larry
Diamond's column ("Ap
preciate plight of clerical
staff," Daily, Nov. 6), may I
point out that the first part of

his article argues tor a living
wage based on expenses of the
wage-earner, which should be
of noconcern totheemployer.
What should be the only
concern is that the employee is
paid appropriately for the type
of work done; the injustice is
that the woman is not paid
what a man would be paid for
that secretarial or clerical job.
