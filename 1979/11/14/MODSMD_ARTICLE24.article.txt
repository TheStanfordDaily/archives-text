## U.S. victimized by 'reverse results' 
### 
A large percentage of the
population is now at least vag
uely aware that the libertarian
political philosophy is based
on an uncompromising devo
tion to human rights. The fun
damental axiom is one of non
aggression: no person or
group has the right to interfere
with the activities of any other
person or group, so long as
those activities are peaceful,
voluntary and non-fraudulent.
This treatment of the ethics
of coercion is, however, but
one side of the libertarian coin.
The other side concerns the
question of the efficacy of a
society without violence in
achieving the goals of human
action.
The most common worry is
that without centralized (coer
cive) authority to guide re
sources and actions, chaos will
result. The libertarian answer is
that, in the absence of central
authority, a spontaneous order
arises, an order which is not
the product of any single mind,
and yet efficiently ac
complishes social goals, often
without that being the intent of
the participants.
The manufacturers of shoes
provide an example While en
gaging in voluntary exchange
to provide people with shoes
(which is their purpose) they
provide employment and raise
the incomes of their
employees (which was not
their original purpose).
This observation about the
nature of voluntary interaction

leads naturally to a corollary
concerning its disruption,
which I call the "law of reverse
results."
The law of reverse results
states that when coercion or
force is used in an attempt to
produce social benefits, the
results are the opposite of what
is intended, or side effects
worse than the original prob
lem are created.
An important point is that
the principle applies only to
social goals affecting the be
havior or well-being of many
people.
Examples confirming the law
of reverse results are so
numerous, it almost seems silly
to point some out. Ones that
spring readily to mind include:
—The War on Poverty, which
produced a lot of rich poverty
fighters and increased the
number of people on welfare
at the same time.
—The Vietnam War, which
produced a communist South
east Asia in the attempt to pro
tect it from communism,
—The subsidizing of nuclear
power, which has given us a
hazardous and incredibly ex
pensive energy white
elephant,
—Compulsory public educa
tion, which imprisons children
for 12 years, and then turns out
1 out of 6 as functional illiter
ates,
—The minimum wage,
which dooms millions of
teenagers to unemployment,
while cutting off the bottom

rungs of the economic ladder,
—Prohibition of pleasure
drugs, which squanders police
time on relatively harmless ac
tivities and drives prices up,
leading to crime and a prolifer
ation of pushers,
—The regulations of the De
partment of Energy, which
have done more to hindercon
servation and production than
any other cause.
For any particular coercive
policy, the chain of events
leading to the opposite of the
intended outcome may be ex
tremely complex and occupy
the lives of many scholars in
identifying and explaining
causes and effects. But it is re
latively simple to show the
general reasons for the princi
ple.
All persons must learn about
themselves and the world and
use their minds to select val
ues, learn about cause and ef
fect and act purposely to main
tain themselves and advance
their lives.
Cooperation and interaction
are, of course, required for our
very existence. Peaceful coop
eration and voluntary ex
change between freely acting
individuals promotes their
lives and prosperity.
Violent interference by force
with a person's learning,
choices and actions cripples
such voluntary cooperation
and leads to frustration. Efforts
to evade coercive measures
often produce problems
where none existed before.

In short, a person who is told
what to do and thus is not act
ing according to his own
choices is necessarily made
worse off, no matter how be
nevolent the coercer's intent.
It is time that the law of re
verse results undergo critical,
scholarly scrutiny.
Certain areas are likely to
yield a bonanza of evidence.
Economics can provide literally
hundreds of examples of
policies yielding results con
trary to intent. Education is
another area where dozens of
theses and publishable articles
await researchers armed with
an understanding of this prin
ciple. Sociology, history,
psychology, medicine and all
other fields which study
humankind will be trans
formed by consistent examina
tion of this simple idea.
I expect any real change to
come about slowly. We live in
an age where taxis, centralized
arrangements to accomplish
certain human objectives, en
joys high repute. But only in a
cosmos, a spontaneous order,
can people be truly free.
Researchers at Stanford and
other institutions must begin
the study of cosmos as well as
taxis. And, if after adequate re
search and thought, someone
thinks they have a coun
terexample to the law of re
verse results, give me a call. I
want to know about it.

that, in the absence of central
authority, a spontaneous order
arises, an order which is not
the product of any single mind,
and yet efficiently ac
complishes social goals, often
without that being the intent of
the participants.
The manufacturers of shoes
provide an example While en
gaging in voluntary exchange
to provide people with shoes
(which is their purpose) they
provide employment and raise
the incomes of their
employees (which was not
their original purpose).
This observation about the
nature of voluntary interaction

leads naturally to a corollary
concerning its disruption,
which I call the "law of reverse
results."
The law of reverse results
states that when coercion or
force is used in an attempt to
produce social benefits, the
results are the opposite of what
is intended, or side effects
worse than the original prob
lem are created.
An important point is that
the principle applies only to
social goals affecting the be
havior or well-being of many
people.
Examples confirming the law
of reverse results are so
numerous, it almost seems silly
to point some out. Ones that
spring readily to mind include:
—The War on Poverty, which
produced a lot of rich poverty
fighters and increased the
number of people on welfare
at the same time.
—The Vietnam War, which
produced a communist South
east Asia in the attempt to pro
tect it from communism,
—The subsidizing of nuclear
power, which has given us a
hazardous and incredibly ex
pensive energy white
elephant,
—Compulsory public educa
tion, which imprisons children
for 12 years, and then turns out
1 out of 6 as functional illiter
ates,
—The minimum wage,
which dooms millions of
teenagers to unemployment,
while cutting off the bottom

rungs of the economic ladder,
—Prohibition of pleasure
drugs, which squanders police
time on relatively harmless ac
tivities and drives prices up,
leading to crime and a prolifer
ation of pushers,
—The regulations of the De
partment of Energy, which
have done more to hindercon
servation and production than
any other cause.
For any particular coercive
policy, the chain of events
leading to the opposite of the
intended outcome may be ex
tremely complex and occupy
the lives of many scholars in
identifying and explaining
causes and effects. But it is re
latively simple to show the
general reasons for the princi
ple.
All persons must learn about
themselves and the world and
use their minds to select val
ues, learn about cause and ef
fect and act purposely to main
tain themselves and advance
their lives.
Cooperation and interaction
are, of course, required for our
very existence. Peaceful coop
eration and voluntary ex
change between freely acting
individuals promotes their
lives and prosperity.
Violent interference by force
with a person's learning,
choices and actions cripples
such voluntary cooperation
and leads to frustration. Efforts
to evade coercive measures
often produce problems
where none existed before.

In short, a person who is told
what to do and thus is not act
ing according to his own
choices is necessarily made
worse off, no matter how be
nevolent the coercer's intent.
It is time that the law of re
verse results undergo critical,
scholarly scrutiny.
Certain areas are likely to
yield a bonanza of evidence.
Economics can provide literally
hundreds of examples of
policies yielding results con
trary to intent. Education is
another area where dozens of
theses and publishable articles
await researchers armed with
an understanding of this prin
ciple. Sociology, history,
psychology, medicine and all
other fields which study
humankind will be trans
formed by consistent examina
tion of this simple idea.
I expect any real change to
come about slowly. We live in
an age where taxis, centralized
arrangements to accomplish
certain human objectives, en
joys high repute. But only in a
cosmos, a spontaneous order,
can people be truly free.
Researchers at Stanford and
other institutions must begin
the study of cosmos as well as
taxis. And, if after adequate re
search and thought, someone
thinks they have a coun
terexample to the law of re
verse results, give me a call. I
want to know about it.

A large percentage of the
population is now at least vag
uely aware that the libertarian
political philosophy is based
on an uncompromising devo
tion to human rights. The fun
damental axiom is one of non
aggression: no person or
group has the right to interfere
with the activities of any other
person or group, so long as
those activities are peaceful,
voluntary and non-fraudulent.
This treatment of the ethics
of coercion is, however, but
one side of the libertarian coin.
The other side concerns the
question of the efficacy of a
society without violence in
achieving the goals of human
action.
The most common worry is
that without centralized (coer
cive) authority to guide re
sources and actions, chaos will
result. The libertarian answer is
that, in the absence of central
authority, a spontaneous order
arises, an order which is not
the product of any single mind,
and yet efficiently ac
complishes social goals, often
