## Card, Cal wheels of fortune stop at Big Game 
### 
Ivan Maisel

One week ago, Stanford
was fresh off a win over
Rose Bowl contender
Arizona State, preparing
for two run-of-the-mill
Pac-10 games against Ore
gon and California and
blowing kisses at their
suitors from Arizona, who
were waiting on the
sidelines to whisk the Car
dinals off to sunny Tempe
for a Christmas Day Fiesta
Bowl.
One week later, the
Cards are licking their
wounds after absorbing a
beating from former 96-
pound weakling Oregon,
trying to regain the emo
tional highs that were mis
sing Saturday and waxing
their skis in preparation for
a Christmas Day on the
slopes. They will not be in
Tempe.
One week ago, the
California Bears were
mumbling to themselves,
wondering what it took to
win a game atter losing
three games in a row in
which they either led or
were tied for the lead late in
the fourth quarter. Not only
were the bowl suitors not
courting the Bears, they
were treating them like the
bowlegged girl at the high
school dam e.
One week later the Bears

are basking in the subarctic
glow of their 45-13 shellack
ing of Washington State in
freezing Pullman Saturday.
Though the bowls still have
not noticed them, the big
win vindicated the Bears'
ability and instilled them
with momentum as they
drop in on Stanford for
Saturday's Big Game.
Such is the looniness of
tootball that the fortunes of
two teams can turn so ab
ruptly in just one week. Last
week the Cards were talking
bowl and the Bears were
talking to themselves. This
week both teams are talking
about salvaging their sea
sonswith a Big Game win on
Saturday.
Stanford has more to sal
vage than do the Bears, if
only because the Cards
came a lot closer to having a
great season than did Cal.
Who would have believed
that Stanford, who just four
days ago was the Fiesta
Bowl's number one con
tender, would be fighting
for a winning season in the
Big Game? Not Rod
Dowhower.
"Obviously, I didn't think
it would be as hard as this to
win five or six games," the
Stanford head coach said.
"Something will have to
change for us to get the

sixth (victory). We've had
both highs and frustrations
this season. We came close
to a very good season.
"I don't think there is any
doubt that the teams will be
emotional. But cooler heads
always prevail," said the
coolest head coach this side
of Irving, Texas. "You have
to have a clear mind and
execute."
Head coach Roger
Theder's Bears have been
lacking in emotion the past
two Big Games, especially
last year, when Stanford
came onto the field higher
than the Campanilel The
Cards ran up a 30-3 lead the
first three quarters and then
took the rest of the day off,
leaving Berkeley with a
30-10 victory.
"Cal hasn't taken the Big
Game as seriously as Stan
ford in the past," Theder
said. "Stanford had people
that got them ready last
year. Someone as emo
tional as Gordy Ceresino
got them much higher. But
our kids realize the impor
tance this year."
The Big Game is, if no
thing else, emotion. It floats
onto both campuses early in
the week and then mag
nifies as the week rolls to
ward Saturday until the
whole campus is en

veloped.
Like a pod from the "Inva
sion of the Body Snatch
ers," no one is able to es
cape. The alumni are par
ticularly susceptible. As Cal
fullback Paul ]ones said,
"When you see the alumni
after the Big Game and
you've lost, then you know
why it's a Big Game."
lones knows that feeling
well, since the Bears have
not beaten their archrivals
since the 1975 Big Game. As
a fifth-year senior, he is also
one of the few Cal footbal
lers around who experi
enced that, too.
This year could change all
that, since Cal has the best
chance of beating Stanford
they have had in three
years. The Bears have only
scored one touchdown in
the past two Big Games, but
this year will be different.
Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans is well aware of
the talent on the Cal team
and insists that despite the
Cardinals' checkerboard
emotional history, his
teammates will be up for
Saturday.
"I've enjoyed five years at
Stanford. This Big Game
means the most to me. It's
important to play well this
week."
As in so many years be

fore, Stanford and Califor
nia are both hinging the
success of this season on
the Big Came. Beyond the
obvious rivalry, they have
to, because the previous 10
games did not result in the
greatest of records.
California has had a pen
chant this year for losing by
small margins to the good
teams (by four to Michigan,
one to UCLA, 10 to USC and
four to Washington), but
losing nonetheless. The
Cards have had a penchant
for thumbing their noses at
the football braintrusts:
when thev are supposed to
lose they do, when they are
supposed to win, they find a
way to lose.
The gods of the point
spread have yet to make a
clear-cut decision on the Big
Came but are leaning to
wards the Bears, going from
even to Cal minus two. Last
year will be remembered as
the year Stanford burned
the bookies, the spread
going from Stanford minus
five to minus 14 then off the
board.
If the Cards could arrange
the opposite to happen this
year, maybe they would
win. After all, they are a sure
thing when they are not
supposed to win.

"I didn't think it would be as hard as this to win five or six
games," Stanford head foothall coach Rod Dowhower said, but
because the Cardinals have had their problems in 1979, their
season will end at home with the Big Game rather than at a
postseason bowl.

One week ago, Stanford
was fresh off a win over
Rose Bowl contender
Arizona State, preparing
for two run-of-the-mill
Pac-10 games against Ore
gon and California and
blowing kisses at their
suitors from Arizona, who
were waiting on the
sidelines to whisk the Car
dinals off to sunny Tempe
for a Christmas Day Fiesta
Bowl.
One week later, the
Cards are licking their
wounds after absorbing a
beating from former 96-
pound weakling Oregon,
trying to regain the emo
tional highs that were mis
sing Saturday and waxing
their skis in preparation for
a Christmas Day on the
slopes. They will not be in
Tempe.
One week ago, the
California Bears were
mumbling to themselves,
wondering what it took to
win a game atter losing
three games in a row in
which they either led or
were tied for the lead late in
the fourth quarter. Not only
were the bowl suitors not
courting the Bears, they
were treating them like the
bowlegged girl at the high
school dam e.
One week later the Bears

are basking in the subarctic
glow of their 45-13 shellack
ing of Washington State in
freezing Pullman Saturday.
Though the bowls still have
not noticed them, the big
win vindicated the Bears'
ability and instilled them
with momentum as they
drop in on Stanford for
Saturday's Big Game.
Such is the looniness of
tootball that the fortunes of
two teams can turn so ab
ruptly in just one week. Last
week the Cards were talking
bowl and the Bears were
talking to themselves. This
week both teams are talking
about salvaging their sea
sonswith a Big Game win on
Saturday.
Stanford has more to sal
vage than do the Bears, if
only because the Cards
came a lot closer to having a
great season than did Cal.
Who would have believed
that Stanford, who just four
days ago was the Fiesta
Bowl's number one con
tender, would be fighting
for a winning season in the
Big Game? Not Rod
Dowhower.
"Obviously, I didn't think
it would be as hard as this to
win five or six games," the
Stanford head coach said.
"Something will have to
change for us to get the

sixth (victory). We've had
both highs and frustrations
this season. We came close
to a very good season.
"I don't think there is any
doubt that the teams will be
emotional. But cooler heads
always prevail," said the
coolest head coach this side
of Irving, Texas. "You have
to have a clear mind and
execute."
Head coach Roger
Theder's Bears have been
lacking in emotion the past
two Big Games, especially
last year, when Stanford
came onto the field higher
than the Campanilel The
Cards ran up a 30-3 lead the
first three quarters and then
took the rest of the day off,
leaving Berkeley with a
30-10 victory.
"Cal hasn't taken the Big
Game as seriously as Stan
ford in the past," Theder
said. "Stanford had people
that got them ready last
year. Someone as emo
tional as Gordy Ceresino
got them much higher. But
our kids realize the impor
tance this year."
The Big Game is, if no
thing else, emotion. It floats
onto both campuses early in
the week and then mag
nifies as the week rolls to
ward Saturday until the
whole campus is en

veloped.
Like a pod from the "Inva
sion of the Body Snatch
ers," no one is able to es
cape. The alumni are par
ticularly susceptible. As Cal
fullback Paul ]ones said,
"When you see the alumni
after the Big Game and
you've lost, then you know
why it's a Big Game."
lones knows that feeling
well, since the Bears have
not beaten their archrivals
since the 1975 Big Game. As
a fifth-year senior, he is also
one of the few Cal footbal
lers around who experi
enced that, too.
This year could change all
that, since Cal has the best
chance of beating Stanford
they have had in three
years. The Bears have only
scored one touchdown in
the past two Big Games, but
this year will be different.
Stanford defensive end
Chuck Evans is well aware of
the talent on the Cal team
and insists that despite the
Cardinals' checkerboard
emotional history, his
teammates will be up for
Saturday.
"I've enjoyed five years at
Stanford. This Big Game
means the most to me. It's
important to play well this
week."
As in so many years be

fore, Stanford and Califor
nia are both hinging the
success of this season on
the Big Came. Beyond the
obvious rivalry, they have
to, because the previous 10
games did not result in the
greatest of records.
California has had a pen
chant this year for losing by
small margins to the good
teams (by four to Michigan,
one to UCLA, 10 to USC and
four to Washington), but
losing nonetheless. The
Cards have had a penchant
for thumbing their noses at
the football braintrusts:
when thev are supposed to
lose they do, when they are
supposed to win, they find a
way to lose.
The gods of the point
spread have yet to make a
clear-cut decision on the Big
Came but are leaning to
wards the Bears, going from
even to Cal minus two. Last
year will be remembered as
the year Stanford burned
the bookies, the spread
going from Stanford minus
five to minus 14 then off the
board.
If the Cards could arrange
the opposite to happen this
year, maybe they would
win. After all, they are a sure
thing when they are not
supposed to win.
