## 
### 
New York (AP) — Keith Her
nandez ot the St. Louis Cardi
nals and Willie Stargell of the
Pittsburgh Pirates finished in a
tie for the National League
Most Valuable Player Award
yesterday — the first time in
the 49-year history of the pres
tigious award that it was shared
by two players.
The results were announced
by the Baseball Writers Associ
ation ol America, which con
ducts the annual balloting.
Both players tinished with
216 points. Outfielder Dave
Wintield ol San Diego was
third with 155 points on the
basis of 14 points lor a tirst
place vote, nine for second,
eight for third, etc.
Stargell received 10 tirst
place votes to lour for Hernan
dez, but four voters on the

BBWAA panel of 24 writers
tailed to list the Pirates' star on
their ballots.
Had the Pittsburgh slugger,
named the most valuable
player in the playoffs and
World Series, received even a
lOth-place mention from any of
those voters, he would have
won the award.
Much of Hernandez' sup
port came in second- and
third-place votes. He received
eight second-place votes and
seven for third, and was the
only player named on all 24 bal
lots.
It was an ironic result for
Stargell, the 38-year-old cap
tain of the Pirates, who twice
has finished second in close
MVP balloting, losing to |oe
Torre in 1971 and Pete Rose in
1973.

Hernandez, who recovered
trom a disastrous 1978 season
to win the National League bat
ting championship this year,
hit .344 with 11 home runs and
105 runs batted in.
Stargell, who led the Pirates
to the World Championship
with heroic playoff and World
Series performances, batted
.281 and led Pittsburgh with 32
home runs while driving in 82
runs. Wintield led the league in
RBI with 118, batting .308 with

34 home runs.
Besides his 10 first place
votes, Stargell had three sec
onds, tour thirds, one fourth
and two sixths.
Hernandez received four
firsts, eight seconds, seven
thirds, two fourths and three
fifths.
Behind Stargell, Hernandez
and Winfield came Montreal
third baseman Larry Parrish
with 128 points and Knight with
82.
