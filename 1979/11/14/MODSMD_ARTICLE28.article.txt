## Card spikers topple USC, seek second-place finish 
### Edie Bogart 
Not only can Stanford's
football team stymie USC, but
the women's volleyball team
can beat it. For the first time in
Stanford's history, the Stan
ford spikers beat USC Sunday
night in a close five-game
match, 15-11,17-19, 15-8, 15-17
and 15-11.
This culminated the Cards'
third-place finish at the UOP
tournament in Stockton. Stan
ford played two teams not in its
league, defeating USC while
losing to UCLA 9-15, 5-15 and
10-15.
Sunday night's win over USC
was the "culmination of a lot of
things," said sophomore )an
Linden. The Cards, after they
watched USC beaten badly by
UOP, felt very confident.
Confidence is "a really im
portant factor in volleyball,"
Linden added, "and we had it
that night. We weren't ex
pected to win,so we had noth
ing to lose."
Stanford's best execution
came in blocking and ball con
trol Blocking was especially
important because of the Tro
jans' adept power hitters.
"All the players were per
forming at the same level,"
head coach Fred Sturm said.
"The team played as a single
unit and all the mental weak
nesses were eliminated. They
converted their scoring oppor
tunities at a higher rate."
The defense improved —
"passing was the best all sea

son," said Sturm.
Freshman Deanna Boyette
said that "the consistent pas
sing made the team feel confi
dent,. . . our team is quicker,
mentally and physically — we
adjust better defensively. We
made fewer mistakes."
Unlike Sunday night's
match, the Cards played
sporadically against UCLA and
lost in three straight games.
In Linden's words, "we just
don't match well against UCLA
— they're a lot bigger than us."

The Cards played well, but let
their concentration go when
they were ahead. "Itwasafrus
trating match," said Boyette.
The spikers hope for second
place in the NorCal confer;
ence. There is a four-way tie for
the position right now. Stan
ford, 6-4 in league, is favored to
win the next two matches
against California Thursday
night and league-leading UOP
Friday night. The Cards may
qualify for the regionals if they
win both matches.
