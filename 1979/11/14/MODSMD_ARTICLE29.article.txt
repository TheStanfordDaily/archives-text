# Swimmers take plunge tomorrow vs. top AAUers
## 
### Kelley Clough 
It's full speed ahead for the
Stanford men's and women's
swim teams as they open up
their season tomorrow at 2
p.m. at deCuerre pool against
the Pleasant Hill Swim Club,
one of the best AAU teams in
the nation.
' Since the first day of classes
jhe Cardinals have been train
ing about four hours a day to
prepare themselves for a tough
but promising season.
< Yet the big championship
meets are so far away — the
twimmers must endure for six
months before they will see the
jull results of their efforts. One
(night wonder what keeps
Ihem going . . .
There are several main driv
ing forces behind the Stanford
teams. For the women,
they've set their sights on an
undefeated dual meet season
Snd, ultimately, the AIAW
Championship title.
'( As for the men, as their only
Uvo NCAA point-scorers from
fast year have graduated, it's a
jfear of rebuilding with a new
soach and lots of fresh, young
ijalent.
| But for both teams, in the
{jack of their minds lurks
Another motivation: 1980 —

The Olympic Year. And one of
Stanford's goals is to have
more Olympic swimmers from
this school than any other uni
versity.
And the Olympic potential is
there. The women's team,
under head coach Claudia
Thomas (a former world
record-holder and two-time
Olympic gold medalist), boasts
of more talent than ever this
year.
After placing third in the
AIAW championships last year
(being only 18 points behind
the victors), the women's
chances for the title seem bet
ter than ever this year.
Returning to the field this
year is Linda Jezek, a world
record-holder in backstroke,
who had originally intended to
take this year off from school to
concentrate on her training for
the Olympics.
Last year as a freshman,
Jezek won three individual
AIAW titles. Accompanying
her in the backstroke will be
co-captain Zena Herrmann and
freshman Kim Carlisle, who is
one of the best backstrokers
and treestylers in the country.
Stanford is blessed with sev
eral all-around swimmers who
excel in many different strokes

and events. Sophomore Libbie
Beaudet, whose specialties in
clude the butterfly,
breaststroke and individual
medly, was a majorcontributor
to the Cardinals' success last
year. Joining her will be Janet
Buchan, a freshman who
finished third in the AAU na
tional championships this
summer in the 400 meter I.M.
Also in the breaststroke events
will be national champion Patty
Spees.
Although in the past the
strength of the women's team
has been in the distance
events, the addition of several
new sprinters to the team will
round out the team's depth.
Co-captain Laura Raymond will
be doubling in both the sprint
and distance freestyles.
Other sprinters include vet
eran Sheri Burlingham and
freshman Carol Proctor, Barb
Major and Kelly Asplund, who
is the nation's fourth-best
sprint freestyler. Along with
Raymond in the distance
events will be two-time AIAW
champion Valerie Lee and
Maria Pease, another AIAW
point-scorer.
Diving coach Rick Shavone
looks for very promising re
sults from his national-caliber

diving squad of Carol Noonan,
Lisa Mariani, Ann Southworth
and Alicia Bush. The girls have
been diving extremely well in
pre-season training, and
Shavone feels that they are the
top divers in the West.
According to the men's
coach, Skip Kenney, who is
new to the collegiate scene this
year but hails from one of the
best AAU clubs in the country,
the main goal for tiie men's
team is to place in the top ten at
the NCAA championships.
Leading the way for the
Cards will be co-captain Monte
Brown, who is one of the best
distance freestylers in the na
tion and stands an excellent
chance of qualifying for the
Olympics.
Coach Kenney also holds
great expectations for
freshman Bari Weick, who will
be competing with Brown in
the freestyle events.
The men's team seems to be
very strong in the breaststroke
events this year. Joining vete
rans Ken Shilling and |oe
Jimenez in this competition
will be AAU national champion
John Simons, who is also one
of the best individual medley
swimmers in the country.
Accompanying Simons in

the medleys will be co-captain
Tom O'Brien and Jeff Stiling.
Both of these men also excel in
the butterfly events.
Bob Hagberg will also be a
big contributor to the team in
the sprint freestyle and but
terfly competitions. Two years
ago, Hagberg placed sixth in
the NCAA's in the 100-yard but
terfly, and Kennery thinks he
stands a good chance to win
that event this year.
Also competing with Hag
berg will be Harry Freeman, a
relatively unknown swimmer
who Kenney calls "his secret
weapon." )unior Ted Knapp
will join Hagberg in the sprint
freestyle.
Wade Flemons, one of the
best Canadian swimmers and
another Olympic hopeful, will
head the pack in the
backstroke events. He should
also be a big point-scorer at the
NCAAs.
Coach Kenney also cites
breaststroker Andy Nichols
and freestylers Brian Cochran,
Craig Spada and Kevin Porter
as looking very good in pre
season training.
Competing in the diving
competition will be the men's
team's lone diver, Brian
McCleve, who has shown tre
mendous improvement, ac
cording to Shavone.
"The whole season will be
based on how hungry they
are," says Kenney. "We've de
finitely got the talent to be in
the top ten at the NCAA's — it
all depends on their attitude
and how bad they want it. And,
as they say, a hungry dog hunts
best."
The Cardinals' meet against
Pleasant Hill will be held
Thursday at 2 at deGuerre
Pools.
