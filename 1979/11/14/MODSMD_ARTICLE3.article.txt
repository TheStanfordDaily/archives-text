# Iran leaders lessen demands; militants won't compromise
## 
### Associated Press 
Iranian leaders yesterday dropped
their demand that the shah be
handed over to them immediately
and set new conditions for freeing
the U.S. Embassy hostages in Tehran.
But the Moslem militants holding the
98 hostages rejected any com
promise.
Iran accused the United States of
stirring a "climate of war" in the
world, asked for a meeting of the
U.N. Security Council, and hinted it
might seek an OPEC oil embargo
against America.
The request for a council meeting,
handed to U.N. Secretary-General
Kurt Waldheim late yesterday said
world peace was threatened by
American "war psychosis." Security
Council President Sergio Palacios de
Vizzio said he would meet with indi
vidual members of the 15-nation
council today.
The apparent split in Tehran came
after 11 days of public solidarity bet

ween the hundreds of students who
seized the embassy Nov. 4 and the
regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini.
Iranian foreign affairs chief
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, in a letter to
Waldheim, proposed that the United
States agree to an international in
vestigation of Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi's alleged crimes and turn his
U.S. money and property over to
Iran.
He implied the results of the in
quiry would force Washington to re
turn the deposed monarch, now
hospitalized for cancel treatment in
New York.
Another Iranian official, radio and
television director Sadeq
Gotbzadeh, said the regime was
ready toend the embassy occupation
"before the extradition of the shah
tor humanitarian reasons and the in
terests of the hostages," the Kuwait
news agency reported.
Tehran Radio, in a report moni
tored in London, said Khomeini had
guaranteed that the Shah would get a
fair trial and be able to hire as many
defense lawyers as he wanted. The
radio also said the ayatollah stated
that if the shah were absolved he
would not object to restoring the
monarch to power.
But the government-run radio later
quoted spokesmen for the militants
at the embassy as rejecting "any con
ciliatory proposal." They said they
could not compromise â€” the shah
must be returned to Iran for trial.
The severity of the split between
Iranian authorities and the militants
could not be determined. Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO)
sources said PLO envoys in Tehran
last weekend found hard-line and
more conciliatory students bickering
with each other about strategy.

Khomeini himself has not been
heard from since a speech Saturday
in which he rejected any negotia
tions and declared the shah must be
returned. He is in seclusion in his
headquarters city of Qum, 100 miles
south of Tehran.
As for the hostages, one of their
student captors, reached by tele
phone b? a Toronto Star reporter,
said they were "OK and there is no
thing to worry about. They are getting
much food. They could not be treated
better." The militants and many other
Iranians began a five-day hunger strike
Monday in support of their demand
for the shah.
The State Department disclosed
yesterday it had established tele
phone contact with the embassy sev
eral days ago and was relaying mes
sages to the hostages. It refused to
say whether any significant negotia
tions had been conducted on the
special line.
As U.S. officials pondered their
next move, President Jimmy Car
ter canceled a trip to Pennsylvania so
that he could monitor the Iran situa
tion, the U.S. aircraft carrier
Midway was steaming toward the
Arabian Sea, near Iran, for what Pen
tagon officials said were long
planned maneuvers.
The Carter administration has re
peatedly played down the possibility
of military action to free the embassy
hostages.
Later yesterday, Iran's Pars news
agency reported that Iranian Oil
Minister Ali Akbar Moinfar had in
tormed his fellow OPEC oil ministers
that "due to the spirit of cooperation
that exists between the OPEC coun
tries, Iran expects that member
countries should back up its stance
against the U.S."
