Opium seized at S.F. airport
San Francisco — Smuggled opium with a street
value of $18,000, was seized and an Iranian gov
ernment engineer was arrested at San Francisco
International Airport, the Drug Enforcement Ad
ministration <DEA) reported yesterday.
DEA special agent Daniel Addario said IVi
pounds of opium was concealed inside cigarette
packages in luggage intercepted at the airport
Sunday.
Addario said Fereydoun Pirnazar, 36, identified
as a civil engineer from Tehran and employed by
the Iranian Education Ministry, tried to pick up the
cache Sunday night and was arrested on dope
importation charges.
Pirnazar is visiting here at an Oakland address,
the DEA said. Addario said the opium-filled lug
gage bore Iran Air baggage tags and arrived in San
Francisco from London aboard a Pan American
pfane.
Pat Nixon treated for pneumonia
San Clemente, Calif. — Former first lady Pat
Nixon was hospitalized yesterday with bronchial
pneumonia, but a hospital spokesman said she
was in good condition.
"Mrs. Nixon has been admitted to the San
Clemente General Hospital for treatment of
pneumonia," the Nixon office said in a brief
statement.
"She is resting comfortably and making satisfac
tory progress."
Nixon was taken to the hospital about noon
yesterday, a spokeswoman said.
Nixon, 66, suffered a stroke in 1976 and was
hospitalized for several weeks.
The Nixons have sold their seaside estate here
and are planning to move to New York City.
Radioactive school well closed
Lathrop — An elementary school well here that
was found to have a radioactive particle level five
times the federal standard has been disconnected
by school officials.
Alpha particle readings in the school well mea
sured 86.2 pico-curies per liter in a Nov. 2 test, said
john Gaston of the state Department of Health.
The federal maximum is 15 pico-curies per liter.
The radioactivity was discovered in the school
well and in several other private and public wells
nearby as part ot a series of tests to determine how
much waste disposal practices at a nearby chemi
cal plant have polluted the groundwater, Gaston
said yesterday.
Officials at the Occidental Chemical plant a half
mile from the school say they are conducting their
own water tests. No evidence has yet been turned
up that their operation is the source of the prob
lem, they said.

Workers at the chemical plant who were in
volved in producing the controversial pesticide
DBCP complained of sterility in 1977.
There is some suspicion that the radioactivity
could emanate from Occidental's phosphate rock
and gypsum processing operation, Gaston said.
NAACP fights Prop. 1 in court
Sacramento — The NAACP went to court against
Proposition 1 yesterday, calling the voter
approved anti-busing measure an unconstitu
tional act of deliberate segregation.
In another development, a hearing on a lawsuit
against Proposition 1, scheduled next Monday,
has been delayed because the lawyer who brought
the suit objected to the judge's record on racial
matters and had him removed from the case.
Attorney Jeffrey Berger told reporters Superior
Court judge joseph Babich has a record "lacking
in sensitivity on minority rights."
The court clerk's office said a new hearing date,
probably two or three weeks away, will be decided
today.
By then, the NAACP hopes it will have won per
mission to intervene in Berger's suit, which was
tiled last Wednesday, the day after Proposition 1
was approved more than 2-1 by state voters.
Berger sued on behalf of a white man whose son
attends a Sacramento high school, saying Proposi
tion 1 threatened his future right to attend an in
tegrated school, even though Sacramento is not
under a court busing order.
The NAACP wants to sue on behalf of several
black parents and children in the Los Angeles and
San Bernadino school districts, both under court
busing orders which could be threatened by
Proposition 1.
"The interests ot the black or minority students
. . . will not be represented unless this interven
tion is permitted," the NAACP said in a complaint
tiled yesterday with Superior Court judge Frances
Newell Carr.
It described the intent ot Proposition 1 as "an
invidious discrimination against minority children
using buses to attain an education equal to that of
California's majority children."
Farmers evicted at Tellico Dam
Loudon, Tenn. — The Tellico Dam, which de
teated challenges from the snail darter and the
Cherokee Indians, overcame what may be its linal
obstacle yesterday as federal marshals evicted the
last two of 341 farmers whose land was taken tor
the 38,000-acre federal project.
"It looks like this is about the end of it," mail
man Beryl Moser said as three carloads ot marshals
escorted him out of the white frame home where
he was born 46 years ago.
Two hours earlier, the Tennessee Valley Author
ity (TVA) had filed writs asking the marshals to

enforce court orders that had turned Moser's tive
acres over to the government in 1971.
"I could have gone to jail but I would have lost
my job and everything else," Moser said. "I still
feel the same way about it as I did 10 yeais ago: To
hell with the TVA."
Nellie McCall, another holdout said, "It's awful
that this thing has happened, but it has. I'm res
igned to it now."
The W.B. Ritcheys, the other holdout, began
packing Monday after their attorney told them all
appeals were exhausted and they agreed to leave.
All three families had refused the government
checks totaling $216,000 mailed to them when
their land was condemned.
Yesterday, Supreme Court justice William
Brennan rejected Cherokee Indians' plea for an
injunction to prevent TVA from closing the gates,
justice Potter Stewart and the U.S.'Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati rejected the same
request last Friday.
Stock drop blamed on DC-10 ban
Los Angeles — Continental Airlines yesterday re
posted a third quarter lossot $9.5 millionorB3cents
a share and blamed the grounding of the nation's
DC-10s for the results.
"Our entire fleet of 15 DC-10s was grounded tor
the last 25 days of june and the first 13 days of
luly," Continental President Robert Six said. "This
destroyed what would have been an excellent
third quarter and makes comparisons with our
1978 figures virtually meaningless."

steady decline yesterday, giving up some of the
