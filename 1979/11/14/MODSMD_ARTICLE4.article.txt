## Brown returns odd-even system 
### Associated Press Staff Writers 
Palo Alto gas station owners had mixed reactions to
yesterday's emergency proclamation by Gov. Jerry
Brown to reinstate the odd-even gas rationing program
next week throughout California.
"Personally I feel that he's adding to the anxiety of the
people," Campus Shell owner Gary Andrews said of
Brown's announcement, which came in the wake of
President )immy Carter's cut-off of Iranian oil. "My first
thought is that it's going to create lines."
Brown told a news conference yesterday that the
odd-even plan will apply to all 58 counties in the state
instead of only the 14 largest counties which were told to
adopt the plan last spring.
San Mateo and Santa Clara counties were given per
mission by the governor to drop the odd-even program
just last month.
But those counties and the other 12 which were on the
program will return to the odd-even system Monday.
The remaining 44 counties will not begin enforcing the
rule until Dec. 3, under Brown's plan.
Several local gas station owners surveyed yesterday by
the Daily objected to reinstating the odd-even system.
"I don't think it will help anything," said Elmer Rathe,
owner of Elmer's Arco in Menlo Park. "It's going to cause
more of a problem."
Most objections were based on the fear that the plan

will create more lines and cause public panic.
"Just the resurrection of the program is going to make
people think that this is a pretty severe situation," An
drews said. As a result, people will panic and start buying
more gas, increasing the length of gas lines.
But Paul Anderson, an employee at Ken's Arco Service
in Palo Alto, disagreed.
"As far as I'm concerned, the odd-even program is
better for us," he said. "Since odd-even went off, we've
had quite a bit of a problem with our sales. It was better
for us back then when it was an even flow all day long.
Now we've been kind of hectic in our gasoline sales."
But Anderson and others questioned the plan's effec
tiveness in conserving gas.
"If the people want to conserve energy, then odd
even shouldn't make any difference," Anderson said.
"People at large are not going to cut down," added
Kevin Mocata, assistant manager at Charleston Shell in
Palo Alto. "They're going to consume just as much gas.
They're still filling up their cars and putting just as much
gas in as before."
People get around the rule by bringing in extra gas
cans to the station for fill-ups, he added.
At yesterday's news conference, Brown said his new
action was "for those who don't believe there is an
emergency. I would say they are asleep. I would say this
program is rather modest."
