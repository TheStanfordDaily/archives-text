# Iranian students in U.S. paranoid; protests continue
## Students under pressure, campuses hostile, negative 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Iranian stu
dents, under pressure and faced with
hostility on campus, are "becoming
paranoid"' and withdrawing into
their own dormitory rooms or
apartments, one state university offi
cial said yesterday.
"Some of our students from Iran
are becoming paranoid, because of
the negative comments they have
been hearing," said Russell
Lindquist, director of the Interna
tional Education Center at Cal State
University-Long Beach.
"Some of them are storing up food
and staying in their rooms to study
and going out only to attend classes
where they feel they can be safe."
At Stanford University, Iranian
students are "keeping a low profile,"
said Lee Ziegler, director of Bechtel
International Center.
He said that most of Stanford's 101
registered Iranian students are
"serious" in their studies.
The western regional office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice (INS) in San Francisco began
checking Iranian student records
yesterday.

The action could result in the ar
rest and deportation of some Iranian
students, said INS Western Regional
Commissioner Edward O'Connor.
O'Connor said in a telephone in
terview that all Iranians registered as
students will be photographed, and
those in the country illegally will be
arrested and steps taken to deport
them. There are some 50,000 Iranian
students in the United States.
O'Connor said that in order for an
Iranian student to fulfill the terms of
his visa, he must be "actively mat
riculated, have the proper amount of
study in an accredited university,
have paid all fees and be properly
attending school."
The INS action, fomally ordered by
Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti,
is seen as an effort to mollify Ameri
cans angry at the holding of some 60
Americans hostage since Nov. 4 in
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Lindquist said there was a mount
ing anti-Iranian mood which caused
some problems at the Long Beach
State campus since the hostages
were taken.

Ogden, Utah — Weber State College students hang an eftigy of the Ayatollah Khomeini at a demonstration protest
ing the takeover of the American embassy in Iran.
"We have had only a few students
harassed on campus," he said.
"Most say the problems they have
experienced have been at their
apartments." There are about 240
students from Iran at Long Beach
State, including 139 on visa status,
Lindquist said.
Only 10 of Stanford's 101 Iranians
are permanent U.S. residents.
International student offices at
Long Beach, the University of South
ern California and 'JCLA, which also
have large numbers of students
from Iran, report they expect few if
any deportations as a result ot Presi
dent jimmy Carter's order to deport

Iranians who are in the United States
illegally.
Vance Peterson, dean of academic
relations at USC, said yesterday that
most of the 900 Iranian students on
campus "were sympathetic to the
shah and they consider themselves
now to be in exile. They couldn't go
back or they wouldn't want to go
back."
Peterson said "the students here
have been taking a low profile" since
an angry clash in Beverly Hills Friday
which resulted in the arrest of more
than 140 Pro-Khomeini Iranians who
also were beaten and spat upon by
hundreds of pro-American de
monstrators.
"Naturally there is some ap
prehension among them about the
way they are being portrayed," Eps
tein said. "There has been a broad
brush used to paint every Iranian
here under the age of 40 as an 'Ira
nian student.' "
At Long Beach State, Lindquist
said, "There are as many Pro-shah
Iranian students here as there are
Pro-Khomeini, but I think both are
moving toward one central group
with an overriding concern for what
is happening in their country.
"The students who come in here
with problems about how they are
being treated are groping for a way in
which they can ask to be regarded by
the American people only as stu
dents at this point. They want to be
left alone."
