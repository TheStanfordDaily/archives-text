# Iranian students in U.S. paranoid; protests continue
## Students under pressure, campuses hostile, negative

Los Angeles (AP) — Iranian stu
dents, under pressure and faced with
hostility on campus, are "becoming
paranoid"' and withdrawing into
their own dormitory rooms or
apartments, one state university offi
cial said yesterday.
"Some of our students from Iran
are becoming paranoid, because of
the negative comments they have
been hearing," said Russell
Lindquist, director of the Interna
tional Education Center at Cal State
University-Long Beach.
"Some of them are storing up food
and staying in their rooms to study
and going out only to attend classes
where they feel they can be safe."
At Stanford University, Iranian
students are "keeping a low profile,"
said Lee Ziegler, director of Bechtel
International Center.
He said that most of Stanford's 101
registered Iranian students are
"serious" in their studies.
The western regional office of the
Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice (INS) in San Francisco began
checking Iranian student records
yesterday.

The action could result in the ar
rest and deportation of some Iranian
students, said INS Western Regional
Commissioner Edward O'Connor.
O'Connor said in a telephone in
terview that all Iranians registered as
students will be photographed, and
those in the country illegally will be
arrested and steps taken to deport
them. There are some 50,000 Iranian
students in the United States.
O'Connor said that in order for an
Iranian student to fulfill the terms of
his visa, he must be "actively mat
riculated, have the proper amount of
study in an accredited university,
have paid all fees and be properly
attending school."
The INS action, fomally ordered by
Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti,
is seen as an effort to mollify Ameri
cans angry at the holding of some 60
Americans hostage since Nov. 4 in
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Lindquist said there was a mount
ing anti-Iranian mood which caused
some problems at the Long Beach
State campus since the hostages
were taken.
