### Associated Press 
The 50,000 Iranian students in the
United States, told to report to im
migration officials or face deportat
ion, were the targets of more de
monstrations yesterday across the
country.
Iranian flags intended to be
burned were selling like hotcakes for
$13 each at a store across the street
from the Betsy Ross house in
Philadelphia.
"We Reserve the Right to Refuse
Service to Iranian Citizens," read a
sign posted in front of the First Edi
tion restaurant and disco in Ocean
side, Calif.
Residents of Cleveland, Tenn.,
lined up to sign an anti-Iranian peti
tion circulated by District Attorney
General Richard Fischer. City offi
cials were the first to sign.
Small anti-Iranian demonstrations
were staged in New York, Grand
Junction, Colo., Baltimore and
elsewhere as Attorney General Ben
jamin Civiletti ordered all Iranian
students to report to immigration of
ficials within 30 days to show that
they are full-time students as re
quired by their visas.
A government official, who asked
not to be identified, said the action
was an attempt to forestall any vio
lence by Americans that could
threaten the lives of 60 hostages who
have been held at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran for the past 10 days.
In Chicago, federal authorities
have taken three Iranians into cus
tody to await exclusion or deporta
tion hearings, authorities said. Wil
liam Skidmore, an assistant deputy
director for deportation, refused to
say whether the incident was related
to President (immy Carter's orders to
begin deportation hearings for Ira
nian students who are in the country
illegally.
Meanwhile, four Iranian students
jailed since Friday for allegedly plot
ting to kidnap Minnesota Gov. Al
Quiewere released. Ramsey County
Attorney Tom Foley said that while
there had been good cause to arrest
the four Iranians from Mankato State
University, there was not sufficient
evidence to charge them.
At the University of Missouri in
Columbia, Mo., about 500 students
staged a demonstration that ended in
jeers, cat-calls, shouting and chants
aimed at Iranian students on cam
pus. Two Iranians in the crowd were
surrounded and heckled, but not
harmed.
Stan Schiermeir, an organizer of
the demonstration, called for release
of the hostages in exchange for the
former shah of Iran, if necessary.
