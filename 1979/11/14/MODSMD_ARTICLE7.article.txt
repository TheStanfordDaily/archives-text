## Visitor sees 'jubilant' Nicaragua Somoza ouster welcomed 
### Dave Rugh 
The Nicaraguan civil war
which culminated in the over
throw of President General
Anastasio Somoza left the
Nicaraguan people with a feel
ing of jubilation despite a de
vastated economy, Philippe
Bourgois, a graduate student in
the Food Research Institute,
who recently returned from a
research trip to Nicaragua said
in a Daily interview.
The protracted civil war af
fected an estimated 80 percent
of all industry and left an un
employment rate of over 70
percent compared with 50 per
cent before the revolution, he
said. Only 18 percent of the
cotton crop was planted this
year causing a drastic decline
in export revenues.
"There is a tremendous feel
ing of optimism among the
people," Bourgois said.
"Workers donated their time
to repair the streets (after the
war), and they were still work
ing six weeks later without
pay."
The dictatorship of Somoza
was overthrown in June by a
coalition known as the San
dinista Liberation Front(FSLN).
Following Somoza's ouMei,
the FSLN has split into three
parties, the Terceristas ("Third
World"), the TP ("Tendency of
the Proletariat") and the GPP
("Popular Prolonged War").
The FSLN reportedly declared
before Somoza's downtall that
the Sandanista* "advocate a
national government made up
of all representative forces o!
the country which are fighting
against Somoza's forces."
Instability
The Terceristas, described as
conservative social democrats,
the GPP and the TP, the two
Marxist oriented parties, are
trying to project a unified front
during this time of instability,
Bourgois said.
"The new government is
worried about the possibility of
a splintering of the progressive
forces as occurred in Chile,
and consequently have come
down hard on the ultra
leftists," he said.
Bourgois said that Tomas
Borges, a GPP party member
and former Sandanista leader
recently declared "The best
way to deal with the ultra-lettist
criticism is to tollow a more let -
tist path," and that Borges'
subsequent call tor dialogue
with the ultra-leftists was a
positive sign. Bourgois noted
that although the distributors
lor the Maoist "El Pueblo" had
been arrested, the newspaper
was not censored and was cir
culated treely throughout the
capital city of Managua.
Dramatic changes
Bourgois said he saw "a
dramatic change on the

private-owned farms." Expro
priated Somoza land was or
ganized into large scale state
farms for the production of
income-generating cotton,
coffee and livestock exports.
Basic grains and rice are grown
on autonomous communes
with technical and financial aid
from the government. The
government also expropriated
land which did not belong to
Somoza or his supporters, but
was "skewed in distribution or
controlled by large land own
ers."
However, government was
making no moves toward in
corporating private industry
into the state system, Bourgois
said. Most foreign investments
were left untouched after the
revolution, and the govern
ment is strongly encouraging
further foreign investment.
The government has taken
steps toward controlling infla
tion by demonetizing 500 and
1000 Cordoba notes to de
crease the money supply, he
said. These moves struck a
blow to Somoza's supporters
who lied the country with suit
cases stutfed with the large de
nomination bills, he added.
Progressive laws
The government has passed
some "extraordinarily prog
ressive laws" including a ban
on advertising that exploits
women, measures to encour
age the establishment of labor
unions and a raise in the
minimum wage level, Bourgois
said.
Despite a line in the Nicara
guan national anthem saying
"we will fight against the Yan
kee enemy of all humanity

. . the present government
is working toward better rela
tions with the United States.
Reconstruction aid appears to
be a key factor, he said.
"Consensus among analysts
is that if American aid to
Nicaragua is not substantial,
the new Nicaragua will be
pushed into the arms of the
Soviet Union," Bourgois said.
Nevertheless, Cuba is "tem
pering its aid" to Nicaragua tor
tear that the United States
would seize on it as an excuse
tor intervention, he said.
In any case, the Sandaista
victory has given impetus to
rebel groups threatening the
military governments of
Guatemala and El Salvador. U
nited States officials are worried
that the "revolutionary fire will
spread from Nicaragua,"
Bourgois said.
