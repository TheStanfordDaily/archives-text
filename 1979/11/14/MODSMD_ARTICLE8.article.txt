Phnom Penh, Cambodia (AP) — Six American
and two Australian yachtsmen were captured,
tortured and executed in 197H by the former Pol
Pot regime, reporters accompanying U.S. con
gresswomen on a tour of Phnom Penh were told
Monday.
Cambodian officials did not identify the
yachtsmen and their report could not be verified
independently. They said all eight victims were
captured sailing off the Cambodian coast, but it
was not clear if they were captured together.
The Americans, at least, were accused of being
spies, they said.
The officials took the reporters to Phnom
Penh's Tuol Slaeng prison, where the execu
tions allegedly took place. They said the Pol Pot
regime executed more than 20,000 persons at
the prison.
The regime now in power in Cambodia was
installed by the Vietnamese troops who ousted
Pol Pot last lanuary. The current regime still is
engaged in bloody fighting with loyalist forces.
Torture instruments
At Tuol Slaeng, once a school and now a
museum, the reporters were shown grisly tor
ture instruments and photographs of some ot
the victims. One official pointed to a picture on

the wall and said it was one of the executed
Americans. The face appeared Caucasian, but
the heavy beard and agonized expression made
an exact determination difficult.
The Cambodians also claimed the museum
had documentation on the eight foreigners but
the tight schedule ot the reporters did not afford
them time to examine it. They were accompany
ing the congresswomen, who did not tour the
prison.
Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, (D-N.Y.), told Cam
bodian Foreign Minister Hun Sen at a luncheon
that they had come to Phom Penh on a
humanitarian mission. "The people of the Un
ited States are deeply moved and troubled by
the plight ot your country," she said.
'Topsy—turvy'
"Phnom Penh looks like a child who had a
temper tantrum with its toys. Everything is
topsy-turvy. There's nothing logical, rational,"
said Rep. Olympia Snowe, (R-Maine).
The delegation also includes Reps. Patricia
Schroeder, (D-Colo.), Margaret Heckler, (R-
Mass.), Norinne Boggs, (D-La.), and Barbara
Mikulski, (D-Md.). Rep. Millicent Fenwick, (R-
N.).) ( did not make the side trip to Cambodia
because of a minor illness. The delegation is
scheduled to re'urn to Washington on Tuesday.
