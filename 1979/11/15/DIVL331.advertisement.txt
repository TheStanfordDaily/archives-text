The DEBARRED JOURNAL is a
channel for the unencumbered com
munication of ideas and is dedicated
to providing the means for publica
tion of professional papers, from all
disciplines, that have been or would
be, denied publication elsewhere
because of the Status Quo Stone
Wall erected by the Keepers of the
Faith".
If you find yourself outside the wall
with an unpublished paper, we invite
you to submit it for consideration.
If you have been discouraged from
starting or completing a paper be
cause it might disturb the "Status
Quo", we'd like to hear about it. All
disciplines are welcome.
(We will publish papers under a
pseudonym or on a name withheld
basis if the author requests. Listing
of credentials will be treated in a
like manner if requested.)
