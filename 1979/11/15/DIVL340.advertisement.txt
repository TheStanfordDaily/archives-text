An open letter to the
Stanford community
The NEW ZOO fa
The Stanford Daily and
INVITE VOU TO A PUBLICITY WORKSHOP
Dear Friends:
The Stanford Daily and KZSU cordially invite you or a representative of
your organization, department or living group to a publicity workshop
on Tuesday, November 20 from 4 to 6 p.m. in the Meyer Forum Room.
Both the Daily and KZSU are often asked why we failed to cover or
promote a particular event. Too frequently, the answer is due to a lack of
communication between us and the sponsoring group.
We d like to help overcome this gap by exchanging ideas on how your
organization can best communicate with us. A publicity workshop is a
logical forum for this exchange.
The Daily and KZSU have complimentary publicity services that can be
ottered to your organization. At the workshop, we will each offer a
half-hour presentation on our respective needs and services, including
mention of deadlines and news policies. Then we will open the work
shop for questions and suggestions.
We hope this workshop will give you a clearer picture of our organiza
tions.
We look forward to seeing you on November 20.
Sincerely,
J>3ra Lessley Mike DiMartino
