# Peter Coutts project gets Palo Alto OK
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council decided
Tuesday night not to delay the prop
osed Peter Coutts Hill faculty hous
ing development.
The council killed a proposed
study on annexing the hill, after
much controversy arose last week
when the council failed to amend its
Comprehensive Plan to include a
140-unit housing project on the 20-
acre site.
The city's involvement in the de
velopment is purely advisory since
the land is not an incorporated part
of Santa Clara County. But before
giving the project the go-ahead, the
county will consider closely
Palo Alto's actions concerning the
site. An annexation study might have
delayed the county's approval of the
development.
Councilmember Frances Brenner,
who called for the study last week,
withdrew her request Tuesday and
read a letter explaining her reasons.
Brenner said she had no intention
of delaying the project. It was doubt
ful, she said, that a full annexation
study could be completed in the near
future without delaying the project.
She added that she had supported
the council's unanimous "concep
tual approval" of the project at its
Oct. 15 meeting.
Several councilmembers, the city
planning staff and the University
rapped Brenner's and Council
member Emily Ken/el's refusal to
allow the city to amend its housing
plan without a full annexation study.
The council, needing five votes to
amend the Comprehensive Plan,
voted 4 to 2 to do so. Council
member Gary Fazzino was absent
from the Nov. 5 meeting and Coun
cilmembers Byron Sher and Anne
Witherspoon disqualified them
selves from voting on the issue be
cause they both work for the Univer
sity which owns the site.
Brenner stated repeatedly Tuesday
that her intention was not to delay
the project but to proceed deliber
ately in studying the proposed
amendment to the Comprehensive
Plan.
"Discussion of the annexation as
pect of the Comprehensive Plan
amendment would not and has not
slowed the project down. The central
focus of the council must be to move
the project ahead but never to elimi
natefull discussion," Brennerstated.
The housing project, located just
west of the College Terrace
neighborhood, between Page Mill
Road and Stanford Avenue, is de
signed to house junior staff and fa
culty members.
