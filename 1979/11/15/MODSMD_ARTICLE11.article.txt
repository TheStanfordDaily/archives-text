# Heart disease linked to stress
## 
### 
Anaheim (AP) — The way you
respond to stress may be a
powerful clue to your risk of
suffering a heart attack, ac
cording to scientists who
propose a new way to measure
emotional strain on the heart.
A two-year study suggests
tests which accurately gauge
the body's physical response
to mental stresses may identify
heart attack victims who are
most likely to have a second
attack, said Wesley Sime of the
University of Nebraska at Lin
coln.
He said that if the tentative
findings are confirmed, "you
would certainly want to use the
psycho-physiological tests on
other individuals who have less
risk and for whom you can
predict farther down the

road."
He said the mental stress
tests might one day be as use
ful to doctors as common exer
cise tests that for years have
been used to measure coro
nary risk to the stresses of exer
tion.
Sime said he is "confident of
our findings but a great deal of
caution should be used in in
terpreting them because of the
small number of patients in
volved in the study. Our data
are suggestive but they are cer
tainly not conclusive."
Sime outlined the study,
which involved 28 heart attack
victims and an equal number
without heart problems, dur
ing an American Heart Associa
tion conference here.

He said new means of de
termining heart disease risks
are needed because only about
half the 1.5 million heart at
tacks that occur in the United
States each year can be
explained by three main fac
tors — high blood pressure,
smoking and high blood
cholesterol levels.
Among other factors being
investigated, Sime said, the
importance of emotional and
mental stress is rapidly gaining
stature.
To judge how a person reacts
to a stressful situation, Sime
said, "we attempt to simulate
as much as possible the same
kinds of cognitive pressures
that one might expect in occu
pational, domestic or disaster

situations.
The Nebraska test involves
three mental tasks, or "stres
sors." One uses word-color
conflicts in which the subject
quickly identifies the color of
ink when, tor example, the
word "red" is flashed in green
ink.
Another stressor is a 12-
minute quiz similar to an IQ
test. Finally, the subject is
asked in another test to recall
emotion-charged events such
as traffic accidents, arrests or
income tax cheating.
While performing the tests,
the patient is monitored by
machines that measure such
things as blood pressure, heart
rate, respiration and muscle
tension.
