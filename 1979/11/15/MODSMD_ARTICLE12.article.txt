# After-tax income declines
## 
### Associated Press 
Americans are earning more and making less
than they were 10 years ago.
That's the conclusion of a new study which
shows that the after-tax, after-inflation median
income for a typical family is smaller than it was
in 1969.
The study was conducted by the Tax Founda
tion Inc., a non-profit research group with
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
The foundation said that from 1969 to 1979,
the median income for all families with a single,
full-time wage earner almost doubled, going
from $9277 to $18,467.
Ihe group figured out how much federal in
come tax and Social Security would be due on
the median income for a married couple with
two children filing a joint return. It calculated
that the after-tax income for the family went

from $7947 to $15,546.
Next, the foundation adjusted the 1979 figure
for inflation, as measured by the Consumer
Price Index, and it found that the "real" income
— in terms of 1969 dollars — was only $7800,
almost $150 less that it was a decade earlier.
These statistics don't even take state and local
taxes into account, which have been rising even
taster than the federal levies in most places.
The foundation said that in 1969, states and
cities took about 10.5 percent as much from
people's earnings as the federal government; by
1979, tney took 16.3 percent.
Tax bracket creep is one reason that earnings
don't keep pace with inflation — even when
paychecks go up. As your income increases, so
does the bite taken by the federal government
as you are pushed into a higher tax bracket.
