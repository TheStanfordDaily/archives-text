## Resist Iranian blackmail 
### 
Today is the eleventh day since a group of
Iranian student-terrorists transformed the U.S.
embassy in Tehran from a center of international
discourse into a hideout where the bandits are
holding kidnapped Americans as prisoners.
Showing a total lack of regard for any sort of
international diplomacy order, the dissidents
state that their protest is not only a trial of the
former Shah; they are also judging the United
States for our actions in allowing the Shah to
undergo cancer treatment in New York.
President Carter and the U.S. diplomatic
corps have done well to stand firm against the
demands of this small group of terrorists. Mon
day's boycott of oil purchases from Iran should
give the renegades a taste of what a total U.S.
trade embargo or blockade could do.
The United States should never allow itself to
be blackmailed into forfeiting the basic free
doms our people have cherished for so long. At
stake in the Iranian situation is the American
freedom to help whomever we wish to in times
ot need. I doubt the Ayatollah would like any
one to turn their backs on him if it were he who
had cancer.
We have to wonder why the Iranians want the
Shah so badly now that he is in a New York
hospital when they had months to extort him
from Mexico while he stayed in a villa there. Is
their action as much of a publicity stunt as it is an
attempt at revenge against the Shah?
Do thev think the U.S. is a pushover, while

Mexico isn't, or are they just trying to smear the
international regard of the United States? Why
does Iran even want the return of the deposed
Shah when it appears he could never again be
any threat there?
Is is so the student-terrorists can have the
grisly satisfaction of killing the Shah before he
dies naturally? Such sick demands must never
be met.
After the Ayatollah Khomeini's statement in
support of the rebel actions, we must wonder
who, if anyone, is in control of Iran. Are we
finding, as Captain Willard did at Do Lung
Bridge in "Apocalypse Now" that "there is no
one in command here"? The Ayatollah is using
the kidnapping a.k.a. "protest" as a smoke sc
reen to blur his feeble leadership and lack of
i unified support in Iran.
The lack of logic in the demands of the rebel
students is appalling. By their logic, if they have
the right to judge the Shah and the United
States, we also then have the right to judge the
Ayatollah, the students and Iran. Would they
like that if they realized many countries impose
the death penalty for kidnapping charges?
President Carter must stand firm for U.S. and
international freedom of choice, lest such ter
rorist actions as the kidnapping in Tehran rule
over logical discourse in the field of interna
tional diplomacy.
