## Foreign tongues need exercise 
### 
The American neglect of
foreign language study has
again become headline news.
It is even proposed to bribe
students to take foreign lan
guages. The departments
which would benefit from such
an injection will rejoice, but
the benefaction should not be
bestowed uncritically, and the
same caveats apply to propos
als to revive the language re
quirement.
Having been involved in the
teaching of a number of lan
guages for many decades, I
have concluded that the
American departmental system
makes an effective solution
impossible. The language de
partments, which used to re
gard the whole of a civilization
as their field, are now confined
primarily to literature and liter
ary language.
Few language teachers have
the technical competency to
understand the contemporary
language, with its political, so
cial, economic and technical
vocabulary. In the case of

Spanish, for example, this re
quires an intimate knowledge
of the machinery of all the
Spanish-speaking nations.
The first requirement then is
a stress on the difficult subject
of lexicography, in which lan
guage and the phenomena re
ferred to above are combined
in one academic subject.
Secondly, standards must be
raised in the more popular lan
guages. In Spanish there has
been a steady decline, with
stress on bilingualism (there are
even courses on Spanglish in
New York!). To give a Ph.D. in
a Romance language without a
knowledge of Latin is like en
gineering without mathema
tics, but now incredibly this is
common.
The standards in the more
difficult languages — Russian,
Chinese, Japanese and German
are high, but this very fact
means that there is untair com
petition and enrollments in
these critical languages are
low.
The other side of the coin is

that non-language majors,
even teachers,usually have an
inadequate knowledge of the
language of the country they
study. Learning a foreign lan
guage requires years, and a few
courses are insufficient prep
aration. As editor of the World
Affairs Report I spend much of
my time reading Russian,
especially the Soviet press.
Much of the writing on the
Soviet Union reveals either an
inadequate knowledge of Rus
sian or an unwillingness to
submit oneself to the discip
line of reading the necessary
sources regularly, or both.
One way of solving this
academic dichotomy would be
to adopt the system popular in
England, namely a combined
social science — language
major.
One aim of language teach
ing must be to prepare stu
dents for the culture shock of
going abroad, specifically of
being confronted with
worldviews totally different
from those of an American.
This is especially true of a to
talitarian system like that of the
Soviet Union, where an
enormous apparatus incul
cates everyone with an anti-

Americanism which we would
describe as lying propaganda.
We listen preferably to dissi
dents, and do not realize that
theirs is not, alas, the voice of
the Soviet people. We have to
live with this, just as we have to
live with the Khomeinis and
Castros of this dangerous
world.
