Rail stoppage?
The Southern Pacific Rail
road categorically denies any
responsibility for the column
{Daily, Nov. 13), "Stop the Rail
road of Bob Avakian." We have
received numerous letters and
phone calls accusing us of at
tempting to stifle competition.
Careful research will show
that our company has always
striven for fair competition;
and that in the last 15 years we
have taken a series of steps to
assure that all competing rail
roads have a fair chance.
Among these steps are the
creation of a Federal Inter
railroad Competition Commis
sion. The FIRCC oversees the
price-distance-time structure
of all railroad corporations.
The National Railroad Com
mittee is the intra-industry
group dedicated to self regula
tion. This group works actively
to encourage the formation of
new railroads. Bob Avakian
applied on Jan. 29 to begin his
railroad; the NRC has been ac

tively assisting him in the plan
ning of his railroad from
Washington, D.C. to Florida.
We are surprised by the at
tempt by Robert Pelta to stop
Bob Avakian's railroad; surely
it has great potential.

Daily Duped
We, the Women of Stanford
Law, wish to express our out
rage at the "Dupie" cartoon
which appeared in the Mon
day, Nov. 12,1979, issue of the
Daily. To publish such a "car
toon" represents the total ab
dication of an editor's duty to
maintain the moral and intel
lectual quality of a publication.
Abortion is not a joke. Many
of us believe that the option to
obtain an abortion is a funda
mental right belonging to
every woman by virtue of her
constitutionally-protected
freedom to control her own

body. In that view, the por
trayal of a fetus as a thinking,
feeling being is both absurd
and disgusting.
Others of us feel that the
fetus is already endowed with a
soul, or the potential therefore,
and that abortion represents
an invasion of life which
should not be endorsed by the
laws of the land. To those as
well, the portrayal of a fetus as
an obnoxious, conniving little
creature is equally offensive.
Gil Morales' "humor" con
stitutes an unjustifiable affront
upon the fundamental rigf *s
and beauty of all women. It
makes a mockery of the sac
rosanct process of human
birth, and evidences a total in
sensitivity to the feelings of
those of our sisters who have
dealt with the traumatic deci
sion of whether or not to un
dergo an abortion. We believe
that a formal retraction and
apology from the Daily is in or
der.
