Perhaps the horrors in Cam
bodia are no different from
those of other watershed
global tragedies; after all, who
can really say whether Vietnam
was more numbing than Au
schwitz, or Biafra more shock
ing than Hiroshima? Perhaps
events like these are basically
undefinable, more important
for their spiritual rather than
for their economic or political
impact. They set the tone of the
age that encompasses them.
Yet to me Cambodia does
seem different. I think this is
less because of the particulars
of the Cambodian situation —
using mass starvation as a polit
ical weapon is hardly new —
than it is a result of the timing

of this famine and war; it
comes at a time when my pati
ence with the idea of social
progress is on the wane.
For four years I've listened to
professors and students tell me
in one way or another that if
people could just manipulate
their environments and each
other successfully, life on earth
would be blissful. This is the
argument underlying a
kaleidoscope of views and
ideologies, from humanism to
communism. Fven Joseph
Branowski, a man for whom I
have a great deal of respect,
once suggested that a society
of scientists could transform
culture into a veritable
paradise.
After hearing arguments like
these I used to laugh to myself,
but even as I did I thought my
self too cynical, too skeptical.
No one really wants to admit
deep down that his/her faith in
man's ability to solve even the
basic problems of existence —
food, shelter and some mea
sure of social stability — is
gone.

But Cambodia has somehow
catalyzed afresh my doubts
about what Professor Robert
Cohn {Daily, Nov. 12) calls
"horizontal religion" — the be
lief that heaven on earth can be
established through man's in
tellectual abilities, whether
scientifically, politically or
economically.
The 20th century — the
grand showcase of modern
secular man and progress —
has been a catastrophe, a
period of time that has seen
less freedom for man and more
death and destruction than any
other era in history. Men be
lieve that they can manipulate
the world and other men with
out respect for the complexity
and sacredness of life, without
respect for the Creator and his
creation.
With finite minds and
methods they act as though
they understand the universal
significance of their actions.
The results are clearly recog
nizable, from Auschwitz to
Cambodia, from Hitler to Mao.
Friends sometimes question
my Christian faith by remind

ing me of the inhumanities of
the past like the Inquisition
which occurred at a time when
people presumably respected
the wholeness and sacredness
of the world.
It is always hard for me to
take them very seriously;
comparing the Inquisition and
the horrors of our century is
like comparing an eight year
old playing "Chopsticks" to a
concert pianist.
In our century man is no
longer valued as a being
created in Cod's image; he is a
variable to be manipulated in
experiments for the "social
good." He is a specimen, not
unlike a butterfly impaled on a
card. When men regard some
thing as a factor in an experi
ment, they like to stick pins
through it, whether it be an in
sect or a person.
In Cambodia the pins and
the specimens are on display,
and the great experiment of
our time is once again being
repeated.
