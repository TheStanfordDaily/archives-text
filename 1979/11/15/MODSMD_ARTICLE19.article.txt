## Clerical unionization 'vital' 
### 
I would like to respond to
Mildred Nilsson's column
(Daily, Nov. 5) and perhaps
shed a little more light on why
the proposed unionization of
the clerical staff is vitally impor
tant to all.
First, the proposed unioniza
tion is an attempt to finally hold
our jobs up in the light of day
and be paid forthe value of the
work we do, recognizing the
skills we possess.
Second, I would like to state
that when so many women are
working to solely support or
add to the support of their
families, we are in jobs that pay
us an inadequate amount
compared to the amount of re
sponsibility, job skills and
pressure/stress of our jobs.
(The workers at the Kaiser
Hospital and BART are both un
ionized and making more than
I do at comparable jobs).
It isn't always easy to just
pack up and leave our present
jobs to find another position in
a company, school or business
elsewhere. For whatever indi
vidual reasons we chose to
work at the University, they are
• our reasons.
The point I'm making is that
along with Kristine Dean
(Daily, Nov. 8) and many others
like her, I too have to work two
and sometimes three jobs to

pay for the things I consider
necessaries: my ever-raising
rent, dental work (orthodontia
is not going to be covered in
our upcoming benefit with the
Dental Plan) counselor costs,
clothes and special shoes for
my growing 11 year-old daugh
ter and just plain general cost
of living that my salary is
forever straining to meet.
Because of these and other
reasons, I find it difficult to be
lieve that Nilsson can justify her
statement that "all the ones
(single parents) I come in con
tact with are doing a reason
ably good job without moon
lighting." I, forone, would like
very much not to moonlight,
but the fact that I must goes to
show that my salary is in
adequate for the times we live
in.
Third, I want to stress the
point that the deadline for col
lecting more blue cards (about
300 more are needed) is near
ing. Without a sufficient
number of cards turned in, ali
benefits and future improve
ments will be left to the whims
of management, which I do not
necessarily trust.
The security of our jobs, im
proved pay, improved benefits
and improved grievance pro
cedures are our "right" and
not a "privilege." Our unity as

a group, or team, will
strengthen our bargaining
power.
Are you clerical staff workers
(male and female) so secure in
your present jobs that you
couldn't benefit from a better
job situation? Even Nilsson
proved that after 18 years of
employment at Stanford, the
system she was loyal to proved
to be not as loyal to her.
Nilsson was phased out of a
position and, unable to find
one of equal pay, had no
choice but to take a cut in pay
in order to stay on at Stanford.
Is this a glance of what we
can expect for all of us as we
approach retirement without
the Union to stand beside us?
Fair it is not, but then fair is
not the name of the game. I
don't intend to allow my job to
be put in jeopardy. With the
help of the Union, I can try to
improve my situation.
I urge all of you to follow
suit, send in the blue cards to
day, urge your fellow co
workers to do the same. I am
convinced that it is not an im
possible or far off solution to
make a positive move for all
our futures.

lieve that Nilsson can justify her
statement that "all the ones
(single parents) I come in con
tact with are doing a reason
ably good job without moon
lighting." I, forone, would like
very much not to moonlight,
but the fact that I must goes to
show that my salary is in
adequate for the times we live
in.
Third, I want to stress the
point that the deadline for col
lecting more blue cards (about
300 more are needed) is near
ing. Without a sufficient
number of cards turned in, ali
benefits and future improve
ments will be left to the whims
of management, which I do not
necessarily trust.
The security of our jobs, im
proved pay, improved benefits
and improved grievance pro
cedures are our "right" and
not a "privilege." Our unity as

a group, or team, will
strengthen our bargaining
power.
Are you clerical staff workers
(male and female) so secure in
your present jobs that you
couldn't benefit from a better
job situation? Even Nilsson
proved that after 18 years of
employment at Stanford, the
system she was loyal to proved
to be not as loyal to her.
Nilsson was phased out of a
position and, unable to find
one of equal pay, had no
choice but to take a cut in pay
in order to stay on at Stanford.
Is this a glance of what we
can expect for all of us as we
approach retirement without
the Union to stand beside us?
Fair it is not, but then fair is
not the name of the game. I
don't intend to allow my job to
be put in jeopardy. With the
help of the Union, I can try to
improve my situation.
I urge all of you to follow
suit, send in the blue cards to
day, urge your fellow co
workers to do the same. I am
convinced that it is not an im
possible or far off solution to
make a positive move for all
our futures.
