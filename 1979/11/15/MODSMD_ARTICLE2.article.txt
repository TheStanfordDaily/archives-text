# ASSU Senate selects Mark Breier as chair
## 
### Fran Miller 
After more than two hours of
closed deliberation, the ASSU Se
nate last night chose Mark Breier,
a junior majoring in economics, as
its chair.
The three-hour election pro
cess included questioning of the
four candidates, discussion and
separate 10-minute interviews of
the top two candidates before a
final vote was taken. The discus
sion and subsequent interviews
were closed to the public and the
press.
Acting Chair George Drysdale
said that all non-senate members
were asked to leave "to preserve
confidentiality."
In what Drysdale called a "very
close" run-off, Breier competed
against Mike Healy, a coterminal
AB candidate student in
economics and industrial en
gineering.
Ron Johnson, a senior majoring
in economics, and recently
elected alternate Sen. Albie Ro
gers, a junior majoring in political
science, also competed for the
position.
Of the four candidates, Breier
was the only one who stated that
he would definitely take fewer
than the required number of
academic units winter and spring
quarters if elected chair.
Breier, a housing associate (RA)
in Larkin House, said he gave the
idea of candidacy a "thorough
thinking-through" after he was

approached by several senators
who wanted to nominate him.
After meeting with the staff at
Larkin and gaining its full support,
Breier said he believed if he won
the election "it would be good for
the dorm and good for me." He
said he likes the position of dip
lomacy that being senate chair
would provide.
Breier said he sees public rela
tions as a major facet of the job
and wants to issue a senate news
letter. Breier called the large
number of aspiring senators and
the large voter turnout this year
signs of student support.
Breier edited Approaching
Stanford during his freshman
year. He is a member of the Public
Interest Research Group (PIRG),
the Tresidder Food Committee
and founded the Committee to
Research Available Eateries
(CRAVE). Breier is also a Daily col
umnist.
After the election of senate
chair, nominations were taken for
deputy chair. After short
speeches and questioning by the
senate, Alternate Sen. Yvonne
Hiltz, a junior, was elected to the
position. Among Hiltz' University
activities are the initiation and
coordination of the November
Career Month for Women.
It was decided to elect a par
liamentarian at the next meeting.
Other senate business discussed
late last night will appear in a I
follow-up article in tomorrow's
Daily.
