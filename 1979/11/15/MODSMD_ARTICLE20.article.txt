## Reign of terror follows Bhutto's death 
### 
A year ago this University
was embroiled in a mini tur
moil, following the ASSU Se
nate's offer of a Guest Profes
sorship to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Opposed by many, the senate
eventually voted to rescind the
offer.
The attack on the senate's ac
tion was spearheaded by a
number of Pakistani students
and emigres. Their opposition

fueled the contention that the
student senate had neither the
knowledge nor the charter to
meddle in the internal affairs of
a foreign country.
Of course none of us that
were the "instigators" of the
professorship offer had the il
lusion that we could force
Pakistan's dictator to succumb
to our demand. Instead the in
tent was to free a significant

political figure of our era.
Bhutto was unquestionably
the most popular man in Pakis
tan. He was dangerous alive
and we felt we could give Gen
eral Ziaul-Hag an "honorable"
way out.
A year later Pakistan is still a
country with staggering human
problems such as illiteracy,
hunger and population
growth. The military govern
ment, that usurped power fol
lowing a July 1977 coup d'etat,
has sustained itself through a
reign by terror.
It has among other things in
troduced flogging and amputa
tions. It claims divine guidance
in establishing an exceedingly
repressive and ruthless re
gime.
And it has killed Bhutto.
Arrested in September of
1977 he was charged with con
spiracy to murder a minor
political figure in 1974. After he
was tried, he was found guilty
in a charade of a trial that
would make Judge Julius
Hoffman a model of decorum.
Following a long-winded pro
cess the Pakistan Supreme
Court upheld the conviction 4
to 3. Bhutto was subsequently
hung.
The military government had
a ready made excuse of "post
poning" elections while Bhut
to's case was pending.
Immediately after his execu
tion, Bhutto's wife and daugh
ter became the most formida
ble junta opponents. They
have been under constant
house arrest and personal har
assment. As the leadership of
the Pakistan Peopfe's Party,

they would sweep to power if
elections were held today.
The regime is in a state of
panic and subsequently it is ex
tremely belligerent. Last week,
the government ordered the
massive administration of "Is
lamic justice." Strapped to
tripods, several Pakistanis ac
cused of deadly crimes such as
drinking or patronizing a
brothel, were flogged publicly.
Throughout the country,
many schools and universities
have been closed and the army
is permanently camped around
major cities to suppress any
opposition. Heavy censorship
blankets the press while free
dom of speech of the indi
vidual is non-existent.
Zia is using much of the
Islamic rhetoric of his power
ful neighbor, the Ayatollah
Khomeini. Hitting a popular
tune in Iran, he may postpone
the re-emergence of border
disputes that existed for years.
Islamic rhetoric can be also
employed as an affront to
western criticism of the re
gime. Westerners, simply "dp
not understand Islamic Justice
or way of life."
The same Associated Press
story that covered the massive
floggings brought the news
that elections have been post
poned indefinitely. "Western
Democracy and elections have
no application in Pakistan," Zia
said. This statement alone
should be a tribute to the
memory of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
