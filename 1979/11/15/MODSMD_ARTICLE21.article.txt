## Pinero's 'Short Eyes' The 						world's a prison, but players and playwright think it's a stage 
### 
Meet Miguel Pinero, a Horatio Alger for
the '70s. Discovered while serving an
armed-robbery sentence at Sing Sing, he
became, upon his release, director of
"Third World Projects" at the Theater ot
the Riverside Church in New York; and a
year later Short Eyes, his first play, won the
New York Drama Critic's Circle Award as
Best Play of 1974.
Short Eyes is now being given its San
Francisco premiere at the Victoria Theater,
16th and Mission — an appropriate set
ting. The play sets before us the brutaliza
tion of inmates by the prison system and
by the society that allows such a system to
exist. Driving down Mission Street in the
early evening prepares you for the shocks
to come.
"Short eyes" is prison slang for a child
molester. Clark Davis, very dapper in his
green nylon jacket and white shoes, is
suddenly thrust into a dayroom in the
Tombs, a New York detention center. The
first section of the play has shown us the
fairly orderly lives led by the inmates. Each
group (black, white and Puerto Rican) has
its own rigidly defined territory within the
room; hostilities are released through
fights sanctioned by the authorities and
broken up before anyone is really hurt.
Davis' appearance shatters the surface
calm of this latter-day lion's den.
Pinero works hard to demonstrate the

debasement of the inmates by the system.
Aberration abounds in the dayroom; be
neath the camaraderie and ribald humor,
beatings, murder and homosexual rape
are taken tor granted.But the mere suspi
cion of child molestation is enough to
mark Davis as a pariah and to make his
murder by the other inmates inevitable.
We are never told why Davis' alleged
crime is so much more horrible than any
one else's. Perhaps the fact that he has
been labeled a "deviant'' before ever en
tering the prison forces the inmates to see
how they all have become deviants during
their own incarceration. Pinero concen
trates on this central irony; Davis, married
and with a child of his own, would in any
other case be the most respectable in
habitant of the dayroom.
The main interest ot this play, and Pin
ero's greatest strength as a playwright, lies
in the dialogue. While it can become
pompous when the prisoners begin
rationalizing their behavior, at all other
times it is superb. Pinero did a lot of listen
ing at Sing Sing.
Perhaps the greatest weakness of this
producation is that most of the dialogue
floats up into the cavernous Victoria Thea
ter's ceiling. During the crucial scenes at
the end of Act 11, when the collective rage
of the inmates turns into mob vengeance,
none of their cries can be made out.

But the acoustics aren't the only prob
lem. When Short Eyes was first produced
in New York, the cast was almost entirely
former prison inmates and reformed drug
addicts. The current cast includes acting
students, a publicist and a Phi Beta Kappa,
but no one who admits to having seen the
inside of a prison. Lacking the necessary
feel lor prison postures and idioms, they
look like what they are — a group of actors
trying to act tough.
And the central role ot Davis, the "short
eyes," is even further miscast. The play's
irony is seen largely in the contrasting ap
pearances of Davis and the other inmates;
he's been written as the "boy next door."
John Marsh, who plays Davis here, looks
and acts like someone who really would
proposition 8-year-old girls.
The biggest problem, though, is the play
itselt. Short Eyes possessed primarily topi
cal appeal. When it lirst ran, three short
years after Attica and at the height of the
outrage over prison conditions, it was
powerful; now it is passe . . . Rarely will a
play date so badly in five years.
When Short Eyes is done well, the power
of Pinero's drama, the animal brutality de
picted on stage, can be overwhelming; it is
not a play for everyone. The deficiencies
of t he current production make it a play for
no one.
