# Comedy is two too much
## 
### 
Those of you Toyon with the
idea of seeing The Company's
weekend production of A
Comedy of Errors experienced
madcap moments of mistaken
identities and severe cases of
double vision.
The only mistake you could
have made in going to this
Gatsbyesque rendition of
Shakespeare's tirst play, di
rected by Marilu Magana, was
trying to distinguish between

the white-tuxedoed An
tipholus twins and the Danny
Kaye-like Dromio twins.
It's the old "shipwreck sepa
rates twins" story, which is to
appear again in the farce,
Twelfth Night. Only in A Com
edy of Errors, the dizygous plot
is made more dizzying by the
presence of another set of
twins, the Dromios, servants to
Antipholus of Ephesus and An
tipholus of Syracuse. Got all
that?
The endearing cast does a
great job of bewildering its au
dience. The physical re
semblance between the two
Antipholuses, finely played by
Scott Leland and Nicholas Van
K. Halsey, heightens our con
fusion, as does the comedic ta
lent of the Dromio twins,
Thomas Wood and Troy

Schmit.
Other outstanding actors are
Susan Champlin as Adriana,
the high-spirited sharp
tongued suffragette wite of An
tipholus, and )oy Belin, her
traditional, placating sibling.
The farce-loving cast gets an
extra pinch of slapstick trom
Doctor Pinch, a black-caped
David Sahlin. Looking like a
well-coitted Wolfman Jack,
Pinch, possessed witli powers
of exorcism, twirls round the
stage, hurling "I charge thee
Satans" at Antipholus and
Dromio.
lust as the audience is ready
to leave and have its eyes
examined, the twins confront
each other onstage. Ageon,
the condemned father of the
Antipholus twins, arrives on
the scene, as does the Abbess

of Ephesus, who tuns out to be
Mrs. Ageon.
Cupid does his stutf, the
Keystone cop puts down his
club and the notes ot Scott Jop
lin, courtesy ot Chuck Olson,
till the city ot Ephesus.
A tew scenes lag in compari
son to the tast-paced, clever
dialogue ot the majority of the
play. The two merchants do
not seem well integrated with
an otherwise close cast, nor
was the roaring '20s theme in
corporated into the bulk of the
play.
The Company's-4 Comedy of
Errors tickles and tortures all at
once. In fact, so convincing is
this cast's version of this classic
larce that Ephesus and Syra
cuse ought to be renamed the
"Twin Cities."
