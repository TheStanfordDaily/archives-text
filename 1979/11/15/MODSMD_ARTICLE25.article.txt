ion in an ASSU Special Events concert, H p.m., Jan. 31. Tickets

When Stephen Stills last per
formed here, after the 1975 Big
Came, the crowd was so wild
he had to tell them "to pipe
down . . . This isn't a basket
ball game." They were excited
as much by the Stills' music as
by the surprise appearance ot
Neil Young, who also 'had
shown up at an earlier Stills gig
at Stanford.
No one knows whether
Young will be back this
weekend, but Stills and his
live-piece band definitely will
be, in two all-electric sets Sun
day night at Memorial Au
ditorium.
He and Dave Mason, who
plays Saturday night, have
been brought in by ASSU Spe
cial Events to celebrate Big
Came weekend.
Mason will play at 7:30 p.m.
Saturday in Memorial Au
ditorium. Opening his show
will be John Kay, who is on his
own alter his work with Step
penwolf.

headlines with his platinum al
bum, Let It Flow, is between
records. His latest, Mariposa
de Oro, is more than a year
old, and his next release will
come out this spring.
