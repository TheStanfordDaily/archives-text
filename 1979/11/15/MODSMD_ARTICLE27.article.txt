# Jumpin' Joe Jackson: 'The Man,' his band rule Britannia, Berkeley
## 
### 
British rock and roll bands
have been at the forefront of
the major trends of American
music in the last two decades.
Rock took popular form in the
early '60s with the Beatles and
the Stones. The so-called
"British Invasion" of the mid
and late-'6os directed music
into areas dominated by the
acid and heroin rock of
Cream.
That movement nearly
burned itself out, but the
music of the early 70s was still
dominated and shaped by a
Briton: Elton lohn. Even dis
co's popularity can be partially
traced to the English-born Bee
Gees. And, certainly, punk
rock owes its current stature to
the likes of the Sex Pistols and
the Clash.
But, disco is on the way out
as the '80s approach, and punk
— in its rawest form — proba
bly will never gain a majority
following.
So where will music be in the
next decade? What groups will
a Daily reviewer of 1989 point
to as influential in the early
'80s?
Beats The Knack
For the possible answer, I
think, there is no choice but to
look to England. And there we
find Joe Jackson.
Jackson has received only
nominal publicity in the United
States, yet his first album, Look
Sharp, received as much atten
tion — particularly from FM
deejays — as did The Knack.
The latter's million-dollar pub
licity blitz helped the group sell
more albums, but Look Sharp
is far superior to Get the Knack.

With the release of Jackson's
second album, I'm the Man, his
band went on tour — which is
what this review is really about.
I saw Jackson last week in Ber
keley: "The Man" and his band
were amazing. The show con
vinced me that the group has
all the necessary qualifications
to be the trend-setter of the
'80s.
It's a cliche, but music is a
reflection of the times. And
where punk rock gained popu
larity on that basis, so will
Jackson. This group's best
numbers are frenzied
rock and roll assaults, reflect
ing today's fast-paced society.
"Cot the Time," "I'm the
Man," "One More Time" and
"Don't Wanna Be Like That"
had people shaking in the
aisles at the concert.
Bill Graham's staff was totally
unsuccessful in keeping
stage-rushers from standing in
the aisles during the perfor
mance. And, when Jackson
himself told the audience that
it was "in my contract" to let
anyone who wanted to stand
up to do so, and that anyone
who asked them to sit down
should be told to "fuck off," it
brought the rest of the crowd
to its feet for the remainder of
the performance.
Personality plus
Which leads me to another
qualification of stardom: stage
presence. Bands without a dis
tinctive stage personality tend
to sink into anonymity very
quickly. But distinctiveness is
something this band, and
Jackson especially, has in
abundance. Uniike Elvis Cos

tello, who plays 45 minutes of
music without a word to the
audience, Jackson broke up his
show well with several sincere
interactions with the audience.
The band played for one
hour and 20 minutes, and co
vered nearly all of the songs
from both albums. Musically, it
was a flawless performance.
Jackson's singing was as good
as his voice is original, and his
occasional keyboard playing
was competent, if not flashy.
The band behind him was
equally outstanding. Graham
Maby's bass lines were nearly

as much of a highlight as
Jackson himself, as he daringly
plucked out lead solo after lead
solo. Guitarist Gary Sanford,
whose solos were mostly of the
rhythm variety, worked well
with drummer Dave Houghton
in keepingthequick, bouncing
pace that is the band's
trademark.
Jackson's two encores — the
final one a tribute to the
Ramones — were well earned
and gratefully given. I just
hope the band continues to
look as sharp as it did.

rock and roll assaults, reflect
ing today's fast-paced society.
"Cot the Time," "I'm the
Man," "One More Time" and
"Don't Wanna Be Like That"
had people shaking in the
aisles at the concert.
Bill Graham's staff was totally
unsuccessful in keeping
stage-rushers from standing in
the aisles during the perfor
mance. And, when Jackson
himself told the audience that
it was "in my contract" to let
anyone who wanted to stand
up to do so, and that anyone
who asked them to sit down
should be told to "fuck off," it
brought the rest of the crowd
to its feet for the remainder of
the performance.
Personality plus
Which leads me to another
qualification of stardom: stage
presence. Bands without a dis
tinctive stage personality tend
to sink into anonymity very
quickly. But distinctiveness is
something this band, and
Jackson especially, has in
abundance. Uniike Elvis Cos

tello, who plays 45 minutes of
music without a word to the
audience, Jackson broke up his
show well with several sincere
interactions with the audience.
The band played for one
hour and 20 minutes, and co
vered nearly all of the songs
from both albums. Musically, it
was a flawless performance.
Jackson's singing was as good
as his voice is original, and his
occasional keyboard playing
was competent, if not flashy.
The band behind him was
equally outstanding. Graham
Maby's bass lines were nearly

as much of a highlight as
Jackson himself, as he daringly
plucked out lead solo after lead
solo. Guitarist Gary Sanford,
whose solos were mostly of the
rhythm variety, worked well
with drummer Dave Houghton
in keepingthequick, bouncing
pace that is the band's
trademark.
Jackson's two encores — the
final one a tribute to the
Ramones — were well earned
and gratefully given. I just
hope the band continues to
look as sharp as it did.

British rock and roll bands
have been at the forefront of
the major trends of American
music in the last two decades.
Rock took popular form in the
early '60s with the Beatles and
the Stones. The so-called
"British Invasion" of the mid
and late-'6os directed music
into areas dominated by the
acid and heroin rock of
Cream.
That movement nearly
burned itself out, but the
music of the early 70s was still
dominated and shaped by a
Briton: Elton lohn. Even dis
co's popularity can be partially
traced to the English-born Bee
Gees. And, certainly, punk
rock owes its current stature to
the likes of the Sex Pistols and
the Clash.
But, disco is on the way out
as the '80s approach, and punk
— in its rawest form — proba
bly will never gain a majority
following.
So where will music be in the
next decade? What groups will
a Daily reviewer of 1989 point
to as influential in the early
'80s?
Beats The Knack
For the possible answer, I
think, there is no choice but to
look to England. And there we
find Joe Jackson.
Jackson has received only
nominal publicity in the United
States, yet his first album, Look
Sharp, received as much atten
tion — particularly from FM
deejays — as did The Knack.
The latter's million-dollar pub
licity blitz helped the group sell
more albums, but Look Sharp
is far superior to Get the Knack.

With the release of Jackson's
second album, I'm the Man, his
band went on tour — which is
what this review is really about.
I saw Jackson last week in Ber
keley: "The Man" and his band
were amazing. The show con
vinced me that the group has
all the necessary qualifications
to be the trend-setter of the
'80s.
It's a cliche, but music is a
reflection of the times. And
where punk rock gained popu
larity on that basis, so will
Jackson. This group's best
numbers are frenzied
rock and roll assaults, reflect
ing today's fast-paced society.
"Cot the Time," "I'm the
Man," "One More Time" and
"Don't Wanna Be Like That"
