Iran earthquake kills hundreds
A strong earthquake flattened at least 18 vil
lages in northeast Iran early yesterday, killing
at least 500 persons, rescue workers said.
Scores were reported injured in the quake.
Sources in the holy city of Mashhad said
bodies were still being dug out by troops
rushed to the wide area of destruction. Hun
dreds of poor peasants were said to be home
less.
"It is possible the death-toll will exceed
1000," said Mohammed Ali Shirazi, reached by
telephone from Nicosia, Cyprus.
The tremor was felt in Mashhad, 500 miles
east of Tehran, but none of the famous domed
mosques, tall minarets or other buildings in
the holy city suffered any damage, Shirazi said.
The quake measured 6.7 on the Richter
scale, the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver
reported, but Tehran Radio, monitored in
London, placed the quake's magnitude at 5.6.
The official Iranian Pars news agency said the
epicenter of the quake was 150 miles south of
Mashhad in mountain country near Qaen,
about 60 miles west of the border with Af
ghanistan.
A White House official said yesterday the
administration has not considered whether to
offer any relief aid to Iran as a result of the
earthquake.
Israel to expel Arab mayor
Tel Aviv, Israel — The Israeli government yes
terday reaffirmed its decision to expel the Arab
mayor of Nablus, who authorities claim is
sympathetic to Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion terrorism. The Cabinet decision brought a
rash of resignations from Arab officials in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
By the end of the day, a spokesman for the
West Bank military government said, all the
elected officials of the West Bank's 25 towns
had resigned, and the mayors and town coun
cil men of Gaza City and Khan Yunis in the Gaza
Strip had followed suit to express solidarity
with the jailed Bassam Shakaa.
Although the occupied territories remained
generally calm, police in Nablus discovered a
time bomb and Israeli troops exploded it with
out problem, officials said.
In Cairo, Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil ex
pressed concern that the Shakka case would
increase tension in the occupied territories
during negotiations on Palestinian autonomy.
Egyptian negotiators met with Israeli and
American officials in Tel Aviv for a working
session on the autonomy plan for the West
Bank and Gaza. Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat was quoted as saying Tuesday that he
expected the autonomy question to be solved
within three months.
In Beirut, a statement issued by the Palestine

Liberation Organization exhorted West Bank
Palestinians to "escalate struggle against the
Israeli enemy," and called on the mayors to act
collectively.
Carter's Soviet policy criticized
Republicans Ronald Reagan and John Con
nally assailed President Jimmy Carter's handl
ing of U.S.-Soviet relations yesterday, but
stopped short of extending that criticism to
Carter's performance in the Iranian crisis.
In campaigning overshadowed by the siege
of the U.S. Embassy in Iran, the two GOP pres
idential contenders asserted that the Carter
administration's foreign policy is one of ap
peasement toward the Russians.
At a Washington news conference, Reagan
accused the president of making too many
concessions to Moscow, but did not elaborate.
The 68-year-old former California governor
said he supports Carter's efforts to free Ameri
can hostages held in Tehran. But Reagan also
said the administration didn't do enough to
keep the Shah of Iran in power.
Former CIA Director George Bush, a Repub
lican presidential aspirant, issued a statement
in Washington applauding Carter's decision to
freeze Iranian government assets.
Grain may be leverage in Iran
Washington — U.S. farmers sell more than
$450 million in food and animal feed to Iran
each year — a bargaining tool that the Carter
administration has not used in efforts to obtain
freedom for Americans held hostage in
Tehran.
"A trade embargo would hurt us as much as
them," a high-ranking U.S. official said yester
day."And it could jeopardize world feeling,
which so tar has been on our side in the 'ran
confrontation."
The official, who asked not to be identified,
declined to say whether President Jimmy Car
ter was considering banning U.S. agricultural
exports to Iran, and Treasury Secretary G. Wil
liam Miller said trade was not a target of Car
ter's decision to freeze Iranian government as
sets in the United States.
"The purpose of the action is not to block
trade," Miller told a news conference. "We are
putting no export limits as such."
The Agriculture Department's general sales
manager, Kelly Harrison, said Iran probably
would be able to handle its trade purchases
with letters of credit, possibly drawn on Euro
pean banks.
Any decision by the United States to block
trade with Iran would cut U.S. income, but not
by great quantities.
Food exports to Iran represented about 1.5
percent of the United States' total agricultural
exports last year.

One-third of the 1979 sales to Iran involved
rice, a quarter was wheat and a fifth was soy
bean oil, used by the Iranians in cooking.
. U.S. cannot expect OPEC oil
Beirut, Lebanon — Oil-thirsty America can
not expect other OPEC nations to make up the
difference in the loss resulting from the cutoff
of Iranian oil, Middle East experts said yester
day.
"There's no way for them (Arab oil expor
ters) to support Iran in this," one expert told
The Associated Press. "But, on the other hand,
there's not much leeway for them to increase
production."
President Jimmy Carter announced Tuesday
the United States would buy no more oil from
Iran because of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran and the holding of some 98 hostages
there. Iran responded by saying it already had
decided to halt oil sales to the United States.
Iranian foreign affairs chief Abolhassan Bam
Sadr strongly hinted that Iran would ask other
Moslem Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to join in an oil embargo against the
United States. Later Tuesday, Iranian Oil
Minister Ali Akbar Mointar messaged other
OPEC oil ministers, calling on them to "back
up" Iran.
But Mointar said yesterday that Iran sought
only moral support trom other oil-producing
nations, the Kuwait news agency reported
from Tehran.
Diggs case conviction upheld
Washington — A federal appeals court yes
terday upheld the conviction ot Rep. Charles
Diggs on charges he inflated the salaries of
employees to pay his personal and congres
sional expenses.
The 2-1 ruling by a U.S. Court of Appeals
panel affirmed the decision of a U.S. District
Court jury that found Diggs (D-Mich.) guilty of
11 counts of mail traud and 19 counts of mak
ing false statements to a government agency.
Diggs was sentenced to concurrent prison
terms of three years on each count, but he has
continued to serve in the House while he ap
peals his conviction.
In his appeal, Diggs contended that he did
not intend to defraud the government and he
acted properly in setting the salaries of his
congressional employees.
Diggs' press secretary, Joan Willoughby,
said it has not been decided whether he will
appeal to the Supreme Court.
Oil profits higher than reported
Washington — Three consumer groups said
yesterday that the way they figure it, oil com
pany profits are at least 33 percent higher than

officially reported.
The groups said accounting methods used
by the oil companies, although legitimate, end
up understating profits in the companies' pub
lic reports. Other accounting practices pro
vide more realistic, and much larger, profit
figures, they said.
The criticism of published profit reports was
outlined in a study issued jointly by the
Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition, the Energy Ac
tion Educational Foundation, and the Tax Re
form Research Croup.
The groups also said oil company acquisi
tions of other companies, both in and out of
energy production, shows they are not using
all of their available cash to develop additional
oil and gas.
Oil industry spokesmen, explaining huge
third-quarter profit increases, say most of the
profit was earned overseas, not in the United
States.
18 dead in Italian explosion
Parma, Italy — Digging desperately despite
rain and snow, rescue workers yesterday saved
three women buried for hours under the de
bris ol a hospital wing wrecked by an explo
sion.
The death toll in Italy's worst disaster of the
year stood at 18 with the discovery of more
bodies. A hospital spokesman said three
nurses and two patients were still missing and
there was little hope of finding them alive.
"We are digging cautiously because some
one could still be alive down there," a rescue
worker said. "But it is cold and much too much
time has passed since the collapse."
Stocks gain 2.47 points
New York — The stock market managed a
modest gain in volatile activity yesterday as
traders reacted to the financial confrontation
between the United States and Iran.

afternoon peak, finished with a 2.47 gain at
816.55.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled
.10.77 million shares, up from 29.24 million
Tuesday.
