# Rhumba line canceled
## 
### 
The IFC post-Big Game rhumba
line was canceled yesterday by Athle
tic Director Andy Geiger and Direc
tor of Police Services Marvin Her
rington because of potential security
problems. The IFC had hoped to
break the world record ot 5825 per
sons in a single rhumba line, or bunny
hop. The proceeds from each par
ticipant's $1 donation were to go to
Muscular Dystrophy.
According to IFC President John
Kinney, the Athletic Dept. agreed to
help in the planning of a similar func
tion after a less crowded football
game next fall.
