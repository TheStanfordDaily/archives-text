# Low key campus reaction to Iran turmoil
## 
### Staff Writers 
While loud, frequently patriotic
outbursts are being voiced by both
Iranian and American students ac
ross the country, the Stanford cam
pus has remained fairly quiet about
the holding of 98 American hostages
in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Last week a flyer was distributed
on campus by a second-year
graduate student urging Americans
to send a telegram to state and fed

eral representatives asking that Ira
nian students be deported from
American universities if harm comes
to the hostages.
"If the Americans' right to life is
violated, then the Iranians' privilege
of education in this country should
be taken away," explained electrical
engineering graduate student Roger
Strauch, who distributed the flyers.
He also urged Iranians here who
disapprove of the action being taken

by Iranian students in Tehran to
speak out against the move.
"They have a moral responsibility
to speak out," he said. "If every Ira
nian in the United States were to
speak out against the students who
took the hostages, it just may cause a
softening in the position of the Ira
nian government."
One Iranian student, who de
clined to be identified, said he
thought there was nothing Iranian
students here could do, except wait
for diplomatic resolution of the prob
lem.
Some Iranian graduate students
here have expressed sympathy with
the actions taken by the students in
Tehran.
One student said the embassy
takeover was "a logical reaction to
the action" by the students in Iran;
"they cannot just sit there and watch
the government be toppled."
Two graduate students said
they approved of the Iranian stu
dents' action, but both said they be
lieve Iran has more important
priorities than the return of the shah,
including organization ot the gov
ernment and alleviating a possible
food shortage.
Strauch called the students here
"representatives of the Iranian gov
ernment" and said they should put
aside their tears ot reprisal by the
Iranian government.
"They're taking the same risk by
speaking out now as they did when

they spoke out against the shah. The
risk of reprisal is outweighed by the
positive effect such a collective dis
approval of the action may have on
the Iranian government," he said.
Iranian students here who ask
at Bechtel International Center
about procedures for checking in
with the immigration offices in San
Francisco are told to wait until more
information is obtained from the Jus
tice Department on what steps the
students must take to assure the val
idity of their student visas.
"If everyone descends on them
(the Justice Department) tomorrow
— the 170 students at Berkeley, the
101 students here and the others at
San Jose State and San Francisco —
they're going to be flooded
explained Bechtel Assistant Director
Mary Clark. "We're asking our stu
dents to wait until we receive more
word from the San Francisco of
fices."
Clark said she does not foresee
deportation of Iranians who have
been involved with the University,
but added that they may have finan
cial problems in the very nearfuture.
"Students who have to get money
out of their country will probably be
in bad shape," she said. "I'm not cer
tain that the Iranian government will
allow funds to leave the country for
America."
She added, however, that many
students may have prepared for this
situation.
