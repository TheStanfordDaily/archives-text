# Stanford kicks Axe; banks on vault safety
## 
### 
The Axe is gone from its display
case in Tresidder Union, but Stan
ford students need not worry. It's re
ported to be tucked away in the vault
of Wells Fargo Bank at Tresidder.
For about a week and a half after
Saturday's Big Game, the Axe, sym
bol of supremacy in the Stanford-Cal
football game, will remain in the
vault, said Patricia Brandt, activities
adviser.
"The problem is that if people try
to steal the Axe, they break the rein
forced glass case," she explained.
"It's expensive to replace."
She said it cost the University sev
eral hundred dollars two years ago to
replace the smashed pane when an

attempt was made to heist the Axe.
Following an 88-year tradition, the
Axe belongs to the school that wins
the Big Came. But frustrated stu
dents sometimes can't wait until the
outcome of the game to find out who
will take possession of the precious
symbol.
This year, students who wander up
to the display case will find only a
small card saying "Beat Cal â€” cour
tesy Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity."
Any attempts to misrepresent Uni
versity officials to gain access to the
tederally-insured Wells Fargo vault
will result in a federal investigation,
