# Carter puts freeze on Iranian funds in U.S.
## 
### Associated Press 
In two swift moves of a grim global
chess game, Iran tried to pull its bill
ions of dollars out of American banks
yesterday but was checked by an
emergency freeze on Iranian funds
ordered by President Jimmy Carter.
Efforts to free the U.S. Embassy hos
tages in Tehran shifted to the United
Nations.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
flew to New York to confer with U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim,
who has offered to mediate the 11-
day-old Iran crisis.
Moslem students holding the em
bassy and 98 hostages showed no
sign of easing their stand — they will
not free their captives until Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi is returned
to Iran to stand trial.
State Department officials said last
night they were recalling special en
voys Ramsey Clark, former attorney
general,and Senateaide William Mil
ler, who were stalled in Istanbul for a
week because Iranian leaders would
not see them.

They declared that any attempt to
compromise on their "great divine
move" directed by Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini "is strongly de
nounced by us and would be
deemed treason," Tehran Radio re
ported.

This may have been aimed at offi
cial Iranian statements Tuesday indi
cating the hostages might be freed
before the return ot the shah, if cer
tain conditions were met. The United
States rebutted the offer, saying
there would be no negotiations
while the hostages were held.
I ran's foreign affairs chief,
Abolhassan Ban'i Sadr, was one of
those who had sounded somewhat
conciliatory Tuesday, as he sought
U.N. intervention in thecrisis. But he
took a firmer stand yesterday, telling
reporters in the Iranian capital, "Our
position remains unchanged,"
Tehran radio reported.
The Iranian decision to withdraw
funds from American banks was an
nounced at a Tehran news confer
ence by Bani Sadr.
He said the Khomeini regime had
decided to pull what he said was $12
billion in Iranian government funds
out of U.S. banks and re-deposit
them in banks of nations "friendly"
to Iran. U.S. officials later said the
amount involved was less than $6 bill
ion.
The Carter administration coun
tered it quickly.
After an urgent meeting of U.S.
Treasury officials and a 5:45 a.m. call
by Treasury Secretary G. William Mil
ler to Carter, the president signed an
order blocking Iranian government
assets.
The official reason for the
emergency-powers order was to en
sure that American financial claims
against Iran would be paid. Miller
said the freeze took effect before the
Iranians could make any substantial
transfers of funds.
State and federal banking officia
moved yesterday to insure that n
funds are moved out of two Irania
banking agencies in California.
"We sent a crew of examiners ti
the Bank Melli Iran in San Franciscc
and Bank Saderat Iran in Los Angeles
to make sure they comply with th«
presidential order," said )ohr
Paulus, deputy state superintenden
of banks.
In another development, Bani Sad
accused the United States of airlifting
paratroopers to Bahrain, in the Per
sian Gulf, for a military operation tc
free the hostages, the Yugoslav new;
agency Tanjug reported frorr
Tehran. Bahrain denied it, and U.S
officials denied a similar report that
they were prepared to stage a milit
ary operation from the Gulf area.
