Clad in red, white and blue hats
and vests, the Stanford Students for
Kennedy held a noon rally in White
Plaza yesterday to solicit volunteers,
raise money and draw students' at
tention, said Chairman Peter Stamos.
According to Stamos, the primary
objective of the rally was to educate
students about Kennedy's views on
various issues. Tables were set up at
the rally with about 15 position
statements. Although most of the
statements came from Kennedy's of
fice, a couple were composed by
Stanford students, Stamos said.
The rally was also planned to "gain
some exposure for the group and sol
icit volunteers," said Stamos. Bal
loons and fliers were used to help
draw attention to the event, and
there was a sign-up list for interested
student volunteers, he added.
According to Alllan Rivlin, national
liaison for the group, about 80 stu
dents signed the list yesterday, and
about 50 others had volunteered
prior to the rally.
In addition, the group raised about
$80 yesterday through donations,
said Rivlin.
Stamos said he was pleased with
the "very positive response" to the
rally.
Stanford Students for Kennedy,
which became an organized group at
the beginning of the quarter, is regis
tered here with both the ASSU and
Office of Student Activities. It is also
registered with the national Kennedy
campaign, according to DougGreen
felt, chairman of the publicity com
mittee.
Most recently, the group is being
"strongly considered" as the coor
dinator for all college campuses in
northern California, and possibly for
all of California, said Rivlin.
The decision is up to Brian
McDevitt, national college campus

coordinator for Kennedy's cam
paign, and he "won't commit himself
until he sees how we perform," Riv
lin explained.
Greenfelt said Stanford Students
for Kennedy would "be delighted to
accept" the offer, but "right now
we're testing our own validity" be
cause "we don't know if we'd be ef
fective politicians."
According to Stamos, the group
has already started setting up a net
work ot college campus organiza

tions for Kennedy by contacting the
newspaper editors of 60 major uni
versities and colleges in California to
publicize the Stanford group's ac
tions.
Greenfelt said the group here is
also "in the process of speaking to
every college in California and find
ing out if there are other students for
Kennedy groups."
Another current project, said
Stamos, is encouraging people from
Stanford to meet Kennedy at the air

port when he arrives in San Francisco
on Dec. 2 to speak on behalf of Sen.
Alan Cranston.
The Stanford Students for Ken
nedy have invited Kennedy to come
speak here on Dec. 3 and the
"chances are 50-50 at best" that he
will accept the invitation, Stamos
said.
"I think the chances of him coming
here sometime during his campaign
are fairly certain," Stamos added,
"but it's just a question of when it will
be."
