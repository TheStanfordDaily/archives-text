In America, 3% of the people
1 give 100% of all the blood
that s freely donated
Which means that if only 1 %
more people—maybe you—
became donors, it would add
over thirty percent more blood
to America's voluntary blood
stream. Think of it!
But forget arithmetic. Just
concentrate on one word.
The word is Easy.
Giving blood is easy. You
j hardly feel it (in fact, some peo
-1 pie say they feel better physi
cally after a blood donation).
And, of course, everybody
1 feels better emotionally.
Because it's a great feeling
knowing your one easy blood
donation has helped up to live
other people to live
So how about it, 1 % of
America? Are you going to lie
down and be counted?
Call your local Red Cross
Chapter, or your community's
volunteer blood bank We need
you now.
