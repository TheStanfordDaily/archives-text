M.A. IN PUBLIC POLICY STUDIES
at the
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO
LiiU nnmmnmmmn 11111
The Committee on Public Pohcy Studies is a formal academic unit of The University of
Chicago offering a two year master's degree program* which focuses on preparation of
students for a wide variety of professional careers. Major components of the program
include Analytic Courses in Economics, Political Science, and Statistics; a range of Appli
cations Courses offered by the Committee and the other departments or professional
schools of the University; and a series of Policy Seminars devoted to the scholarly, inter
disciplinary investigation of specific public policy issues.
The Committee does not automatically assume that government solutions are the preferred
solutions to all public policy problems. Its program presupposes a role for the private sector
as well as the public sector in solving public policy problems. The Committee further
assumes that public policy leadership requires an understanding of both arenas and of the
complex economic and social framework within which pubUc policy operates.
The Committee welcomes applications from students in the social sciences, the humanities,
and the natural sciences.
â€¢The Committee offers a One Year Master's Degree Program to selected, advanced graduate
students from various institutions. Such students are eligible for a flexible, elective-oriented
program of study.
