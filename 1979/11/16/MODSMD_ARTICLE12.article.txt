## Phnom Penh stirring to life under Heng

Phnom Penh, Cambodia (AP)
— The water runs from the taps
but not above the ground
iloors, Some children go to
classes but the university is de
serted. Twenty doctors staff
the hospitals but must treat
thousands ol malnourished,
disease-stricken patients.
Phnom Penh, once so ravish
ing, then so tragic, is slowly
stirring to life again.
Along its broad, French-built

boulevards, among the debris
and destruction, families are
beginning to move back into
long-deserted homes. There
are no shops or restaurants and
the central market is empty of
produce. But small streetside
stalls are offering sugar cane,
coarse bread and dried fish.
Because there is no money in
circulation, rice is the main
medium of exchange: two
pounds ol fish lor nine ounces

ol rice; two pounds ol pork for
three pounds of rice.
Ghost town
Phnom Penh suffered shel
ling and near-starvation during
the last days of the U.S.-backed
government of President Lon
Nol. It was emptied at gun
point ol its more than 2 million
inhabitants when Lon Nol fell
in April 1975 and the brutal re
gime of Premier Pol Pot took
over, transforming if into a vir
tual ghost town.
The city fell victim to Pol
Pot's vengeance and a scor
ched earth policy shortly be
fore Vietnamese troops cap
tured it on Jan. 7 this year.
Now, ten months later, au
thorities say about 270,000
people live in a nine-mile
radius ol Phnom Penh some
70,000 ol these in the core of
the city. Reporters accompany
ing an American congressional
delegation here Monday found
the estimate believable.
Place of survivors
Phnom Penh today is a city ol
government tunctiona ries,
workers and Vietnamese ad
visers. Il is a place ol survivors
— those who escaped Pol Pot's

bloody attempt to rid Cam
bodia ol its educated classes.
Chun Bun Kong, press chief
in the Foreign Ministry, said
the government of President
Heng Samrin has appealed to
these survivors — teachers,
doctors, skilled workers, man
agers — to return to t'hnom
Penh trom the countryside and
trom abroad to help rebuild a
shattered society.
Reportedly, very lew exiles
have responded to this call.
After the Pol Pot experience,
they may tear any communist
regime.
Eager students
But on the streets of Phnom
Penh one finds those back
from Pol Pot's rice lields:
former students eager to brush
up on their rusty English;
businessmen who worked for
to reign companies when
Cambodia was a capitalist soci
ety, and American-educated
intellectuals.
In sharp contrast to Pol Pot,
the new government has wel
comed — .it least temporarily
— all who can perform skill
fully, even those with a "reac
tionary, bourgeois" past.
