Dear Bug Me:

Right Now, of course)'l've been ,it Stantord for
tour years now jnd I still dor 11. >w. Can you

hives? Thanks.
-A concerned se
I received this two weeks ago, but thought it
more appropriate to save until today. The Uni
versity Archives has a plethora of traditional
songs and yells, many ot which make fascinating
reading on this, the day before Big Came.
The most widely recognized traditional song
in our history is Come loin the Band. This song
was written by Aurania Ellerback, class of 1909,
and put to the music ot the New Colonial March,
by R.B. Hall. This song, if any, is the Stanford
tight song (other th an All Right Now, of course!)
Come loin the Band
Come join the band
And give a cheer for Stanford Red;
Throughout the land
Our banners waving overhead;
Stanford (or you
Each loyal comrade brave and true
With might and mam sings this refrain
"Forever and Forever, Stanford Red. "
After the game,
When Stanford Red has won the day;
Praising her name,
Down on the field we'll torce our way;
And on the green,
Each man who joins the serpentine
With might and main sings this refrain
"Forever and forever, Stanford Red!"
The Stanford-Cal rivalry, 87 years old tomor
row, has inspired many budding poets to put
their spirit into song. The earliest musical refer
ence to Big Came is in an untitled, uncredited
song which was composed in 1893. Here is a
brief excerpt:
We are coming onward, Berkeley,
Our ranks are full and strong;
lust see our waving cardinal

As we gladly march along!
In 1913 P. Eliel and W.S. Wilson combined
their talents to write W'hen Stanford Whips the
Goldt'll Bears Again. Here is one ot their verses:
When Stanford whips the Golden Bears again
And the Card'nal waves on high,
We'll give a shout for Stanford men,
And the spirit that will not die.
The same two men also wrote another anti-Cal
song, The Cardinal Fighting Song, part ot which
goes:
Fight, men ot Stanford, Victory's in sight;
Trail Berkeley's banner, and for the Card'nal
fight, fight, fight, fight;
Win, men of Stanford, win the game today;
Drive the Golden Bear back to his lair across
the bay.
One song which every Stanford rooter quickly
learns at Big Came is the adulterated rendition
of Cal's rendition of Cal's fight song. The Stan
ford version is entitled The Dirty Golden Bear.
The dirty Golden Bear
Is losing all his hair,
His teeth are out
He's got the gout
He don't know what it's all about;
His eyes are made of glass;
He's losing all his class,
So take your dirty Golden Bear
And shove him up your ass.
There is an even more adulterated version of
this song, which the members of the Stanford
Band, happy-go-lucky fellows that they are, take
pride in singing at the game. Their words (or at
least those that are printable) follow:
The dirty Golden Bear
Has dirty ***** hair
His **** is dead
It's got no '***
He can not get it up in bed:
He goes to use his ****,
But can not find his ♦***,
So you can see him ****** ***
The U.C. Berkeley Band!
So clip this column, bring it to the game, and
get ready to sing!

learns at Big Came is the adulterated rendition
of Cal's rendition of Cal's fight song. The Stan
ford version is entitled The Dirty Golden Bear.
The dirty Golden Bear
Is losing all his hair,
His teeth are out
He's got the gout
He don't know what it's all about;
His eyes are made of glass;
He's losing all his class,
So take your dirty Golden Bear
And shove him up your ass.
There is an even more adulterated version of
this song, which the members of the Stanford
Band, happy-go-lucky fellows that they are, take
pride in singing at the game. Their words (or at
least those that are printable) follow:
The dirty Golden Bear
Has dirty ***** hair
His **** is dead
It's got no '***
He can not get it up in bed:
He goes to use his ****,
But can not find his ♦***,
So you can see him ****** ***
The U.C. Berkeley Band!
So clip this column, bring it to the game, and
get ready to sing!
