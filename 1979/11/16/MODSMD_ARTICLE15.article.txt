# Process said to detect breast cancers
## 
### 
Chicago (AP) — Seventy
live percent ot all breast can
cers can lie detected by a com
bination ot physical examina
tion by a doctor and mammog
raphy, a radiation screening
technique, researchers report.
The tindings by lour resear
chers at the University ol
Arizona at Tuscon were re
ported in the Nov. 9 issue ol
the lournal ot the American
Medical Association.
A separate article in the same
magazine said mammography
poses only an "extremely
small" risk ol ilsell causing
cancer in the women who are
screened.

The tindings ol both articles
contradict some conclusions
reported recently in another
respected medical publication,
the New England lournal ol
Medicine.
Reporting in the AMA publi
cation, the Arizona researchers
said that overall, mammog
raphy is more eltective in tind
ing breast tumors ol all types
than a physical exam by a doc
tor.
The Arizona researchers said
out ol 11i conhrmed breast
cancers trom a local screening
ol 10,117 women, mammog
raphy detected abnormalities
in 62 percent ol the cases and

physical exams detected ab
normalities in 24 percent.
'kit while il was easier to de
tect tumors — both benign and
malignant — with mammog
raphy, a physical exam was bet
ter at finding cancerous
tumors, they said.
Based on the total number ol
screenings, mammography
successfully detected cancer in
20 percent ol the cancer cases,
while physical exams spotted
cancer in 49 percent, they said.
They said a study showed
that a combination ol physical
exams and mammography de
tected 75 percent ol the breast
cancer cases.
