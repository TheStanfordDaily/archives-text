# SIG helps locate intern positions
## 
### Stephanie Weber 
It's autumn quarter, and
most students are thinking
about tomorrow's Big Game,
Thanksgiving break and
(maybe) final exams.
However, it's also a good
time to begin job hunting for
next summer, and Stanford
in-Government (SIG) is one of
the University's student-run
organizations that can help
find employment.
Located in the Old
Firehouse, SIG assists students
interested in government in
ternships, and provides infor
mation, lobbying and financial
aid.
During the fall, the SIG
Board works to compile a list of
potential government-related
internships tor the coming year.
The board tries to eliminate
contusion in selecting possible
internships and also attempts
to ensure that students are
made aware of those positions
most worthwhile and most
suited to individual needs.
Students are then encouraged
to write specific congressmen,
government agencies or spe
cial organizations.
In addition to this collection
of information, SIG sends a
small group of its board mem
bers to Washington D.C. and
Sacramento each fall to lobby
tor students on an individual
basis. For those working in the
nation's capital, this aspect of
SIG is especially signiticant be
cause University students, un

like those from eastern univer
sities, are generally unable to
have personal interviews for
potential positions.
A third service provided by
SIG is the donation of money.
Every year the organization,
through alumni contributions,
allocates financial aid to stu
dents accepted for internships,
helping to cover summer living
expenses.
Last year alone, according to
SlC's chairman, Carlos Pas
cual, interns from Stanford re
ceived $14,000 in aid.
As a general guide, SIG can
facilitate the acquisition of a
government-related intern
ship. But it is only through in
dividual initiative that a sum
mer internship can become a
reality.
Contrary to popular belief,
tor example, Washington con
sists of more than Capitol Hill.
As Scott Raphael, a graduate
student in economics here,
learned during his internship
in the Dept. of Agriculture, an
agency job allows one to view
government from an interest
ing perspective. In addition to
a generous salary, Scott ac
quired insight into the im
plementation of policy rather
than the formation of policy,
which is witnessed on the Hill.
According to Raphael, work
on the Hill means meeting
people and making contacts.
Such internships provide
background for those in
terested in politics rather than
government in general.
Still another internship op
tion is to work for special or
j ganizations such as lobby
| groups. They, like the federal
I agencies, approach govern-
I ment differently than con

gressmen. But as individuals
warn, lobby groups demand
interns who agree and support
the goals of their organiza
tions. Any dissenting attitudes
may seriously disturb one's in
ternship, according to Cliff Col
vin, a former intern to the
Committee for the Survival of
the Free Congress.
Vet internships are not all
political in focus, and oppor
tunities for government ex
periences abound outside the
offices of senators and con

gressmen. One must merely
distinguish among particular
interests.
SIC also helps University
students to find positions in
the state capital in Sacramento.
In past years students have
worked in the state depart
ments of Commerce, Finance
and Social Welfare, as well as in
the offices of the governor and
the secretary of state.
Last year, nearly 100 students
here found internship experi
ences.
