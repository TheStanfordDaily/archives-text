# Penny Patterson and Koko leave Stanford
## Gorillas move to new Woodside home 
### Bob Deyling 
Francine "Penny" Patterson and
her two gorillas, Koko and Michael,
have won approval lor their new
home off campus. The San Mateo
Planning Commission gave its
unanimous consent Wednesday to
relocate the gorillas in the hills in un
incorporated Woodside on Skyline
Boulevard.
But, apparently to ease the con
cerns of local residents, the commis
sion voted to grant Patterson the use
permit for only one year, with a re
view of the project scheduled in six
months. Patterson may reapply tor a
permit alter one year.
A representative in the San Mateo
County District Attorney's office said
there is no question that the use Pat
terson proposes is within the area's
zoning laws. The gorilla research
center will be in an area zoned tor
"resource management," which in
cludes research. Also, he said, the
project is exempt from the exotic
animal ordinance because of the in
clusive scientific research.
Patterson has spent several years at
the University teaching the gorillas to
communicate in sign language. Last
spring she earned a doctorate in
psychology here tor her research
Later the University administration
instructed her to move the animals
because she no longer had any for
mal affiliation here and because no

professor was willing to assume di
rection of the project.
After months of discussion with
the University, Patterson's Gorilla
Foundation purchased the new site
with money obtained from grants
and donations.
Local Woodside residents have
voiced concern about the safety ot
having the large animals close to
their homes. Patterson assured her
neighbors, however, that there is no
danger of the two gorillas escaping
since they are kept behind four sets
of locks and are monitored by an
electronic surveillance system which
will warn of their escape and of the
presence of intruders. She said the
two gorillas are "exceptionally tract
able'' and "friendly and gentle" due
to their prolonged interaction with
humans.
A nearby resident, Steve Yaeger,
said his concern was eased some
what by a visit to the project. How
ever, he said he (eels that, although
the security system is good, the po
tential for hazards still exists. He said
he was concerned that, as the gorillas
mature, the male would become
more aggressive, increasing the pos
sibility of his escape.
Another neighbor, Jonathan
Kitchen, said that, while he was not
too worried about the safety factor,
nearby residents should have been

consulted before the project was ap
proved since they have an interest in
keeping the area residential. He said
he was not objecting to the project
itself, but that it should be located in
a more remote area.
Others expressed dismay over the
use of a mobile home in the scenic
Skyline area. The gorillas will be
housed in the same trailer they were

in while at Stanford. But most resi
dents said they see no problem in
having the trailer on the site as long
as it is temporary.
Donald Newmark, a member of
the county planning staft, said the6'/.i
acre site is not visible from Skyline
Boulevard anyway, because it is 85
feet from the road and in dense
woods.
