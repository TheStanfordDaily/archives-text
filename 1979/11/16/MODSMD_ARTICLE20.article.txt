## Mark Conroe Honor code more than just formality

■Oh ..."
Is Stanford's honor code just
a formality?
I wondered this when I trans
ferred here last year trom West
Point. After attending a school
which stressed one's honor
.ihove all else, I was curious to
see how one ot the nation's top
universities viewed its honor
< ode.
While at the Academy, I ex
perienc ed the national censure
and the attendant congres
sional investigations that re
sulted when a group of stu-
Jlents violated an almost two
tentury old standard of con
duct. Subsequently, probing
questions surfaced regarding
Jlio relevancy of a noncompris
jng standard ofJionor in a soci
ety which condoned dishon
esty. With this perspective I
it,ime to Stanford, eager to see
pow Stanford students per
ceived their honor code.
\ After several quarters here
Jny questions began to be
Answered: The honor code
seemed to be invisible. The
Vnly time I heard or saw any
thing < oik erning it was during
fln examinations. F.ven then, I

was always too nervous about
the exam or too pressed for
time to worry about what I was
signing. I gave more thought to
the tuition check I signed each
quarter than to the meaning of
my signature on the bluebook.
I then attempted to find out
more about the honor code,
what it meant and what my role
was as a student. When I asked
for intormation, I was referred
to the back cover of the ASSU
Course Guide, where I found a
list of commonly asked ques
tions and a copy of the honor
code and its interpretations.
I his is it?" I thought.
Nonetheless, I still wonder
what the honor code means to
the Stanford student. Does it
intluence our lives by en
couraging an atmosphere of
trust among our peers, or is it
just a ritual that we must go
through before the professor
will grade our exams?
It ought not to be just a
ritual: it is our responsibility as
students to see that our honor
code is effective. We have cho
sen to work under less
academic control, and with this
freedom comes the responsi
bility for us to support the
honor code by our actions.
Living under Stanford's
honor system necessitates that
we know what the honor code
means, and that we think about
its implications. To merely

acknovyledge the existence of
the honor code is not enough.
We must ask ourselves the
probing questions that must be
answered it the honor code is
to be more than just words on a
page. We must ask ourselves:
What should constitute an
honor code violation, and what
should our responsibilities be
it we believe that a violation
has occurred?
Should the faculty have any
obligation under the honor
code, and should a failure to
uphold that obligation, for
example by proctoring during
exams, constitute a violation of
the honor code?
Only by ensuring that these
and similar questions are well
thought through can we make
the honor code the part of
Stanford life that it is intended
to be. It is easy for us to fail to
think about the honor code, to
let it remain in its currently
dormant state.
However, in sodoing, we are
denying ourselves the oppor
tunity to experience the effect
of a working honor code, an
experience which can be a val
uable aspect of our education;
and we are shirking the re
sponsibility that we promise to
take on every time we sign the
honor code on our bluebooks.
Have you ever carefully read
(he honor code that you have
so often signed? If you have,

have you thought about what
you read and what your re
sponsibilities are under the
code?
Only after we have
thoroughly thought through
what the honor code should
and does mean will it actually
become the integral part of the
Stanford experience that we in
timate it holds every time we
sign our names to it.

was as a student. When I asked
for intormation, I was referred
to the back cover of the ASSU
Course Guide, where I found a
list of commonly asked ques
tions and a copy of the honor
code and its interpretations.
I his is it?" I thought.
Nonetheless, I still wonder
what the honor code means to
the Stanford student. Does it
intluence our lives by en
couraging an atmosphere of
trust among our peers, or is it
just a ritual that we must go
through before the professor
will grade our exams?
It ought not to be just a
ritual: it is our responsibility as
students to see that our honor
code is effective. We have cho
sen to work under less
academic control, and with this
freedom comes the responsi
bility for us to support the
honor code by our actions.
Living under Stanford's
honor system necessitates that
we know what the honor code
means, and that we think about
its implications. To merely

acknovyledge the existence of
the honor code is not enough.
We must ask ourselves the
probing questions that must be
answered it the honor code is
to be more than just words on a
page. We must ask ourselves:
What should constitute an
honor code violation, and what
should our responsibilities be
it we believe that a violation
has occurred?
Should the faculty have any
obligation under the honor
code, and should a failure to
uphold that obligation, for
example by proctoring during
exams, constitute a violation of
the honor code?
Only by ensuring that these
and similar questions are well
thought through can we make
the honor code the part of
Stanford life that it is intended
to be. It is easy for us to fail to
think about the honor code, to
let it remain in its currently
dormant state.
However, in sodoing, we are
denying ourselves the oppor
tunity to experience the effect
of a working honor code, an
experience which can be a val
uable aspect of our education;
and we are shirking the re
sponsibility that we promise to
take on every time we sign the
honor code on our bluebooks.
Have you ever carefully read
(he honor code that you have
so often signed? If you have,

have you thought about what
you read and what your re
sponsibilities are under the
code?
Only after we have
thoroughly thought through
what the honor code should
and does mean will it actually
become the integral part of the
Stanford experience that we in
timate it holds every time we
sign our names to it.

"Hey, Inn, you 'll have to sign
your bluebook before I can
grade it."
'Oh, yeah. Why do we sign
these things anywayf"
"lust a formality, I guess
■Oh ..."
Is Stanford's honor code just
a formality?
I wondered this when I trans
ferred here last year trom West
Point. After attending a school
which stressed one's honor
.ihove all else, I was curious to
see how one ot the nation's top
universities viewed its honor
< ode.
While at the Academy, I ex
perienc ed the national censure
and the attendant congres
sional investigations that re
sulted when a group of stu-
Jlents violated an almost two
tentury old standard of con
duct. Subsequently, probing
questions surfaced regarding
Jlio relevancy of a noncompris
jng standard ofJionor in a soci
ety which condoned dishon
esty. With this perspective I
it,ime to Stanford, eager to see
pow Stanford students per
ceived their honor code.
\ After several quarters here
Jny questions began to be
Answered: The honor code
seemed to be invisible. The
Vnly time I heard or saw any
thing < oik erning it was during
fln examinations. F.ven then, I

was always too nervous about
the exam or too pressed for
time to worry about what I was
signing. I gave more thought to
the tuition check I signed each
quarter than to the meaning of
my signature on the bluebook.
I then attempted to find out
more about the honor code,
what it meant and what my role
was as a student. When I asked
for intormation, I was referred
to the back cover of the ASSU
Course Guide, where I found a
list of commonly asked ques
tions and a copy of the honor
code and its interpretations.
