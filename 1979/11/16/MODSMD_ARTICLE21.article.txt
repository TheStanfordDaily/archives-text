Return the shah
\s a general rule, it is unwise
to accede to the demands of
terrorists and extortionists;
however, Iranian demands tor
the return ot the shah consti
tute an exception to that gen
eral rule.
Because the shah's atrocities
wric acts ot government
committed by a head of state,
the rulers of the United States
evidently believe that the shah
should be immune from ex
tradition.
I his natural sympathy of
American leaders for a fellow
atitocrat should be resisted.
I he shah tnay not win the
title ot the twentieth century's
greatest murderer: the com
petition — Hitler, Stalin, Mao,
Pol Pot, etc. — is rather stiff.
However, the shah has taken
the lives ot thousands and the
liberties ot millions of Iranians.
He is a despotic tyrant and a
mass murderer and deserves to
be severely punished for his
c rimes.
Hie Daily (Nov. 13)
editorialized, "To turn the
shah over to the Iranians is un
thinkable On the contrary, it
is unthinkable tor the United
St'ates, a nation founded on in
dividual rights, to continue to
protect a person who has
trampled on individual rights
and extinguished innocent
lives.
In the interests of justice,
and regardless ot the actions ot
the Khomeini regime and its
adherents, the United States
should forcibly return the shah
to Iran.

'Weather' report?
The Daily is very much re
spected tor its accurate re
porting, and on most occa

sions I must commend you for
its correctness. However, your
weather summary ot Nov. 12
left, in at least my and my skis'
eyes, much to be desired.
I had my new Head skis all
waxed, bought a lift ticket from
some weird senior who
couldn't stop laughing, and
borrowed three wool sweaters
trom neighbors on my hall.
Besides the constant drip,
drip, drip ot sweat dropping
trom my red nose, there we
ren't any signs of precipitation
in the northern portion of
campus except tor a pea soup
like fog at 8 a.m.
It wasn't until I had dehvo
rated to a prune and gotten
back to my dorm that I heard
that the snow was at the south
shore of Lake Lag.
Being from blizzard-ridden
Indiana, we Hoosiers know
how to recognize coming
snow. I suggest you check your
alfalfa sprout tips and see if the
cows at the Dish are lying on
their left side (with hooves
pointing south) before you
make another absurd predic
tion tor mother nature's fluffy
frosting!

(Editor's note: Sorry about that,
chiet. Hut before you begin
pelting us with snowballs, let
us explain the dilemma we
faced the evening preceding
Monday's edition. The As
sociated Press (that omnipo
tent organization which sends
us the weather forecast) failed
to do so Sunday night. So, in a
moment of sheer desperation,
we sent one of our editors out
side to match wits with the
elements. Well, he hails from
Illinois where the wind is brisk
and the snow plentiful, so he
figured that by the second
week in November, it was
about time for some of the
white stuff to hit the ground.
We earthquake-shaken

Californians were in no posi
tion to dispute the prediction,
so we printed it and hoped for
the best. We'll pick someone
else next time.
