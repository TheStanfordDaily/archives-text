"Generosity is giving more than you can,
Pride is taking less than you need"
—Kahil Cibran
It is not often that Stanford students are bles
sed with the opportunity to display the same
boundless generosity referred to in these words
of wisdom. However, when Lady Fortune turns
her magical wheel our way and presents us with
just such a chance, we must be quick to seize
upon the opportunity and give of ourselves in an
unselfish, yet noble manner.
Fortunate as we are, this very weekend, al
ready upon us, gives us the chance to play host
to some very important neighbors of ours and
we must rise to the occasion and prove ourse
lves worthy hosts and providers. For it is Big
Game Weekend, and this year Berkeley jour
neys to Stanford for the "great showdown."
No doubt, many of us will be hosting relatives
or friends from Berkeley who will have opted to
spend the weekend on the Farm. These will not
be ordinary guests so we should not treat them
as such.
The Berkeley student who arrives at Stanford
on Friday for a "weekend of fun and games"
must be handled with special care. Here are a
few suggestions on what to do with your Ber
keley guest.
Initially, certain matters of protocol must be
set forth to avoid embarrassing your guest upon
arrival. The issue of how to address your guest
has always been a plaguing problem because
Berkeley students generally don't like to be cal
led by their given names, for names are a "label
of the establishment" and as such have been
outdated at Berkeley since 1963.
On the other hand, it would not do well to
refer to your guest as a "weenie," "geek," or
other affectionate pet name either.
I propose a simple solution: just call him/her
"Berk." "Berk" is a nice, neutral name without
sexist connotations, and calling all Berkeley stu
dents by that name makes meeting large groups
much easier.
So your "Berk" arrives at Stanford Friday af
ternoon and you don't know what to do with
your guest. A nice tour of the campus is always a
fresh idea, but this tour must be tailored so as to
hit only the sights that will challenge and excite
your "Berk." I suggest Bing Nursery School as a
first stop so your "Berk" can compare educa
tional facilities there with his own back home
across the Bay.
As soon as any of the lectures there become
too complicated for your guest, proceed on to
Columbae House for a snack, and then on to a
late afternoon demonstration of the Gorilla lin
guistics program at the Medical Center.

It would be advisable warn your "Berk" that
he will not be allowed to challenge the gorillas
to a one-on-one match in the "fit-the-round
peg-in-the-square-hole" competition.
Friday night is the great march through San
Franciscoand, of course, bring your' Berk" with
you for the festivities. Do not be dismayed if he
runs up to the most bizarre-outfitted LSJUMB
member and exclaims, "Dad! It's so greatto see
you here!"
Throughout the march, always keep an eye on
your "Berk," because years past have proven
that it's very easy for him to simply "blend in
with the background" and be lost for the better
part of six months.
As always, the march will begin at the Mark
Hopkins Hotel, so it will be crucially important
to explain to your "Berk" that, no, it would not
be all right for him to run into the lobby and
push all the elevator buttons.
Equally important is to stay close to your guest
at the end of the march down at the wharf be
cause you can't rent innertubes at night, and no
"Berk" should get near the water without one.
Upon returning from the City later that night,
all should be very tired and ready for bed. If,
however, your "Berk" demands a bedtime
story, remember to be a good host and tell him
the one about the three (golden) bears who are
outsmarted by a five-year-old child. (Hee-Hee!)
Don't forget to turn on the nightlight before
closing his door.
Saturday is of course the Big Game, and you
should be sure and escort your "Berk" to the
stadium, buy him a hot dog, and remind him
that he will be sitting with the people "in blue"
and that he should cheer forthe band at halftime
that looks like two boxes of Mattel toy-soldiers
that need a fresh winding.
After the Stanford victory, be sure to be a
good sport and drive your guest back to the bus
station in time to catch the 1:15 to Berkeley.
Don't forget the I.D. tag around his neck and be
sure to remind him not to ask the bus driver for
some wings, "just like on the airplane." Soon,
he will be off, and the greatest weekend of the
year will have ended.
These have been but a few of the many possi
ble suggestions of things to do when your Ber
keley guests arrive this weekend. The rest is up
to you, so don't forget to enjoy this weekend to
the max.
Remember, we only get this one chance to
show 'em who the rightful owners of the axe are.

her magical wheel our way and presents us with
just such a chance, we must be quick to seize
upon the opportunity and give of ourselves in an
unselfish, yet noble manner.
Fortunate as we are, this very weekend, al
ready upon us, gives us the chance to play host
to some very important neighbors of ours and
we must rise to the occasion and prove ourse
lves worthy hosts and providers. For it is Big
Game Weekend, and this year Berkeley jour
neys to Stanford for the "great showdown."
No doubt, many of us will be hosting relatives
or friends from Berkeley who will have opted to
spend the weekend on the Farm. These will not
be ordinary guests so we should not treat them
as such.
The Berkeley student who arrives at Stanford
on Friday for a "weekend of fun and games"
must be handled with special care. Here are a
few suggestions on what to do with your Ber
keley guest.
Initially, certain matters of protocol must be
set forth to avoid embarrassing your guest upon
arrival. The issue of how to address your guest
has always been a plaguing problem because
Berkeley students generally don't like to be cal
led by their given names, for names are a "label
of the establishment" and as such have been
outdated at Berkeley since 1963.
On the other hand, it would not do well to
refer to your guest as a "weenie," "geek," or
other affectionate pet name either.
I propose a simple solution: just call him/her
"Berk." "Berk" is a nice, neutral name without
sexist connotations, and calling all Berkeley stu
dents by that name makes meeting large groups
much easier.
So your "Berk" arrives at Stanford Friday af
ternoon and you don't know what to do with
your guest. A nice tour of the campus is always a
fresh idea, but this tour must be tailored so as to
hit only the sights that will challenge and excite
your "Berk." I suggest Bing Nursery School as a
first stop so your "Berk" can compare educa
tional facilities there with his own back home
across the Bay.
As soon as any of the lectures there become
too complicated for your guest, proceed on to
Columbae House for a snack, and then on to a
late afternoon demonstration of the Gorilla lin
guistics program at the Medical Center.

It would be advisable warn your "Berk" that
he will not be allowed to challenge the gorillas
to a one-on-one match in the "fit-the-round
peg-in-the-square-hole" competition.
Friday night is the great march through San
Franciscoand, of course, bring your' Berk" with
you for the festivities. Do not be dismayed if he
runs up to the most bizarre-outfitted LSJUMB
member and exclaims, "Dad! It's so greatto see
you here!"
Throughout the march, always keep an eye on
your "Berk," because years past have proven
that it's very easy for him to simply "blend in
with the background" and be lost for the better
part of six months.
As always, the march will begin at the Mark
Hopkins Hotel, so it will be crucially important
to explain to your "Berk" that, no, it would not
be all right for him to run into the lobby and
push all the elevator buttons.
Equally important is to stay close to your guest
at the end of the march down at the wharf be
cause you can't rent innertubes at night, and no
"Berk" should get near the water without one.
Upon returning from the City later that night,
all should be very tired and ready for bed. If,
however, your "Berk" demands a bedtime
story, remember to be a good host and tell him
the one about the three (golden) bears who are
outsmarted by a five-year-old child. (Hee-Hee!)
Don't forget to turn on the nightlight before
closing his door.
Saturday is of course the Big Game, and you
should be sure and escort your "Berk" to the
stadium, buy him a hot dog, and remind him
that he will be sitting with the people "in blue"
and that he should cheer forthe band at halftime
that looks like two boxes of Mattel toy-soldiers
that need a fresh winding.
After the Stanford victory, be sure to be a
good sport and drive your guest back to the bus
station in time to catch the 1:15 to Berkeley.
Don't forget the I.D. tag around his neck and be
sure to remind him not to ask the bus driver for
some wings, "just like on the airplane." Soon,
he will be off, and the greatest weekend of the
year will have ended.
These have been but a few of the many possi
ble suggestions of things to do when your Ber
keley guests arrive this weekend. The rest is up
to you, so don't forget to enjoy this weekend to
the max.
Remember, we only get this one chance to
show 'em who the rightful owners of the axe are.
