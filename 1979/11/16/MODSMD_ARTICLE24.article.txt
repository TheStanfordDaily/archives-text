## Kennedy's power not necessarily bad 
### 
I disagree with Dale Cieringer's analysis
of Ted Kennedy's candidacy, "The Ted
who would be king," (Daily, Nov. 12) be
cause it seems to me he confuses two
things: big government and presidential
power. The two are not the same thing.
Kichard Nixon wanted to decentralize
government, and return power from the
federal government to local authority. Yet
he did not let that goal conflict with his
own desire for great personal presidential
power.
Conversely, it is possible to believe
strongly in big government, high taxes and
much economic regulation, without a de
sire for great personal power, but simply
because one feels that should be the role
of government.
The two factors seem to me fairly inde
pendent, instead of identical as Gieringer
views them. Thus Kennedy's stand on Na
tional Health Insurance doesn't strike me
as good evidence that he wants to be
"king." (Nor does his or his friends' be
havior in the Chappaquiddick incident.)
Gieringer must feel that Kennedy's ideas
and positions are dangerous. Fine â€” if so,

he should take the trouble to explain why
he doesn't like them, rather than assuming
that we already agree with him.
I suppose he feels that since "the nation
has changed since the New Frontier," his
remarks are self-evident in 1979. But to me
it seems the question of how much author
ity government should have is still argu
able on its own merits, without assuming
that anyone believing in strong central
government must be power-hungry.
I gather that Gieringer is distressed at
the call for leadership in the wake of re
cent abuse of presidential power. Leader
ship is a standard campaign word, but I
wonder if he isn't overlooking the differ
ence between the concepts of leadership
and power.
The way I think most use the term, lead
ership is independent of the extent of
one's use of institutional power, and is
much more in the realm of personal qual
ities. Thus I assume Kennedy's suppor
ters, in talking of leadership, are referring
to personal qualities they think he has,
rather than to his wealth or power, or to
any particular views he has of the office of

President or of national issues.
Whether Kennedy possesses these qual
ities is a separate issue worthy of discus
sion and study, but I hope we are not to
the point of fearing leadership itself.
I guess I might even question whether
Hitler, for example, should be thought of
as one of the great leaders of history, al
though I realize I would have to introduce
an ethical dimension to leadership that not
everybody would include.
I appreciate Cieringer's concern about
Kennedy, because of the latter's great
wealth and power, which of course have
nothing to do with his fitness to be presi
dent. But I vv ish he would restrict his atten
tion to Kennedy's qualifications and his
positions on issues.
I don t believe wealth or power neces
sariK disqualify one for high office. And I
guess I would submit that anyone running
tor president with a reasonable chance of
winning is potentially much more
"dangerous than the average citizen.
