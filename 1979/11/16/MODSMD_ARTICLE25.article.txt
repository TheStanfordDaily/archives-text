## Quest for peace goes on 
### 
To some people, the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty was a significant step forward in the Mid
dle East peace process.
Others are reserved in their assessment of
whether or not the treaty, solitary as it stands,
really can achieve the necessary amount of un
derstanding and change needed for a com
prehensive settlement of the Middle East con
flict.
A third school of thought discards the treaty as
being impotent with respect to what overall
peace it can achieve, the main reason being its
failure to come to grips with the central issue,
the question of the Palestinians.
It is worth noting that Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat, during his famous speech to the
Israeli Knesset, emphasized that he was not
looking for
1) a unilateral peace treaty between Egypt and
Israel,
2) any treaty that excluded the realization of
Palestinian rights to a homeland and self
determination.
At Camp David, Sadat conceded both issues.
Hence the Arab furor over, and rejection of, the
accord.
Many Western observers have voiced their
belief that all would come well if other Arab
countries, Jordan and Syria receiving prime
mention, came into the negotiations.
Vet surely it is now plain to see, for anyone
remotely concerned with the problem, that
peace, a real and lasting peace, ultimately de
pends on the Palestinians and the Israelis com
ing to terms with each other.
There lies fhe most serious stalemate. The
only form of exchange between the two sides
has so far been, to say the absolute least,
bloody.
Here are two people, who love, desire, need
and feel a belonging to the same land. Who has
what right over where is, for the purpose of this
argument, irrelevant.
The pure conviction in, and devotion to their

causes, drives both people to destroy lives.
Their own as well as some on the other side.
And, as is true of all states of war, too many
innocent victims suffer. How, and when, will
this catastrophe end?
Who will argue, that with presently prevailing
attitudes and circumstances, the end, if it
comes, could well be another holocaust? And
probably a nuclear one at that. If not in the next
war, perhaps in the one succeeding it.
One could not begin to visualize the propor
tions of the terrible destruction in life and prop
erty that such a catastrophe would entail â€” for
all parties in the area.
If there is to be true peace in the holy land,
radical adjustments in the attitudes and beliefs
that exist on both sides, are inevitable. Changes
that would be impractical, indeed impossible
with the current predominance of mutual hate
and distrust. Changes to the tune that the two
people can, must, live together, respecting each
others' right.
The sheer magnitude of the difficulties to be
encountered whenever discussing such issues
would alone be enough to cause many to de
spair, and resign the issue as hopeless. Hence
the need to accept that real peace will probably
not ensure in our generation. Hence the need to
start preaching coexistence, rather than blind
hatred, to our children. And hence the urgent
need for Israelis and Palestinians to restrain
emotion, and discuss together, rationally, what
they could strive to make the future hold.
It does not matter how difficult the process
would be. What does matter is the certainty that
the only alternative for both people would be to
fight on. And on. And on.
As the great Jewish physicist, Albert Einstein
once said, "Peace can never be achieved by
force. Only through understanding."
