# Rhinos struggle to survive

Nairobi, Kenya — "Rhinos —
None Seen for 3 Months.
Please Notify the Manage
ment," said a Kenya safari
lodge bulletin board listing big
game spotted at Tsavo West
National Park.
Although most of the well
known animals appear abun
dant to the visitor in Kenya to
day, the score for the
rhinoceros often is zero, dis
appointing photographic
safari- goers and distressing
conservationists.
Populations of the black
rhino, Kenya's only native
rhinoceros, have dropped
drastically in the last decade —
from 15,000 in 1969 to an esti
mated 1500 today, even though
hunting has been illegal for
two years.
The drop in black rhino
populations has caused the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
to consider proposing it as an
endangered species. Such pro
tection would mean a black
rhino product could not be
imported into this country ex
cept for a special purpose and
would allow the United States
to aid other countries in pro
tecting the animal. All other
rhino species already are consi
dered endangered by the Un
ited States.
In Meru National Park, once
the northern stronghold ol
Kenya's rhino, the animal is fast
vanishing. In Tsavo, where 10
years ago nearly 9000 rhinos
roamed, only 150 are be
lieved holding out. And there
are probably fewer than 10
rhinos left in Masai Amboseli
Came Reserve.
Whefe have all the rhinos
gone? Most have died at the
hands of poachers, who covet
the animal's horns. In the last
few years thousands of rhinos
in Kenya have been killed so
their horns could be exported,
although it is illegal.
Rhinos are in danger be
cause of their Iwo horns,
which actually are masses of a
hair-like substance. They are
the principal weapon of an
animal that has the reputation
of being aggressive, although
much of its behavior can be at
tributed to near-sightedness.
"Because of its bad eyesight,
the rhino will run quickly to
something it glimpses to get a
closer look," explained Dr. Kes
Hillman, director of the African
Rhino Group, a Nairobi-based
task force working to save the
rhinoceros. Rhinos have been
known to charge buses, tents
and even their own shadows.
A charging rhino is no small
threat. The average black rhino
is 4Vz tos'/i feet tall and weighs
I to 2 tons.
Black rhinos, which actually
aren't black but gray, have
been traced back 12 million

years, and most of their prehis
toric contemporaries are mere
fossils today.
"The rhino is ,1 sort of prehis
toric relic unable to cope with
the modern world, Hill
man said.
Ranging from Cameroon
east to Somalia and down to
South Africa, the black rhino is
in (rouble in many areas. Tan
zania's Tarangi re National
Park, once thick with rhinos,
now has few if any left. The
Lake Manyara and Ngorongoro
Crater area of Tanzania — a
former rhino stronghold —
also has been heavily poached.
Until recently the black
rhino was better off than its
cousins, the four other rhino
species in the world. Popula
tions of the larger African kind,
the white or square-lipped
rhino, had been threatened for
decades, but conservation ef
forts seem to have stabilized it.
The three Asian species —
the Creat Indian, lavan and
Sumatran — exist in such small
numbers that theirsurvival is in

doubt. For instance, there are
estimated to be only 50 )avan
rhinos left in the world.
"There is no question that all
rhinos are now in grave
danger," said Dr. Lee Talbot ol
the World Wildlife Fund, one
of the tew scientists ever to
study all five species in their
habitats.
A worldwide "save the
rhino" campaign coordinated
by the World Wildlife Fund now
aims to help African and Asian
governments tight poaching
and protect the species.
In Kenya, where game war
dens sometimes are risking
their lives to light well armed
poachers, President Daniel
Arap Moi has authorized com
plete protection for the black
rhino. He has ordered a con
servation plan to be drawn up
and has given authority tor
stricter sentences lor poach
ing. Rhino horn, likeall Kenyan
wildlife products is now pro
hibited from exportation.
Some conservationists be
lieve cracking down on
poachers will not be enough.

Kenya's rhinoceros population has decreased significantly in the last
decade because of poaching. This adult black rhino is one of perhaps
10 left at the Masai Amboseli Came Reserve.
