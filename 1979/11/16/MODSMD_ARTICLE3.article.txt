# Feasibility proposal under review
## City council considers Stanford annexation 
### Bob Deyling 
The City ol Palo Alto is reviewing a proposal on
the leasibility ot annexing all University lands into
its city limits.
The Palo Alto City Council reterred the proposal
last month to its policy and procedures commit
tee, which will review and make recommenda
tions on a five-year-old study ot the issue.
Councilman Frances Brenner, a member ot the
committee which will meet in lanuary to discuss
annexation, said the major considerations are the
financial impact ot annexation and the interest of
the community.
"A definite common interest exists between the
University and the residents of Palo Alto," she
said. "Each decision to expand at Stanford raises
questions concerning increased traffic, use ot un
developed land, shortage of housing, municipal
services and so on.
"Both communities depend on each other in
many indirect ways — Stanford is served bv the
Palo Alto police and tire departments, tor sam
ple, and Stanford sewers empty into a Pa! Alto
treatment plant. Increased growth at Si lford
means increased business for local mei ants.
Thus, it seems logical that Stanford shou have
and would desire a voice in local governrr it, as
annexation would allow Stanford residents >vote
in Palo Alto elections," Brenner said.
University agreeable
"The University has always been 01 -n to
suggestions concerning annexation," s.'i I |im
Nelson, director ot facilities and propertie here.
"The benefits or detriments ot annexing th Uni

verity into Palo Alto are really unknown, since the
last time it was studied was live years ago.
"If the c ity s current evaluation of the issue con
cludes that there is interest in the University being
annexed, and the proposal is financially sound, we
are more than willing to work with the city," Nel
son said.
Councilman Gary Fazzino, chairman of the pol
icy and procedures committee, proposed the in
quiry.
' The question ot annexation surtaced in con
nection with the approval ot the Peter Coutts Hill
taculty/statt housing project, and I suggested the
larger issue (annexing all Stanford land) should he
reviewed," Fazzino said.
The committee will review and update the old
study which tocused on the costs and benefits ot
annexing the lands," Fazzino said.
Common issue
The question ot annexation seems to arise every
time the University attempts to develop more ot its
land, all ot which is technically unincorporated
and part ot Santa Clara County. The county makes
the final decisions on new developments.
Out ofcourtesy toPalo Alto residents, Stanford
has always worked closely with the Palo Alto City
Council to make all new building compatible with
the concerns of residents ot both communities,"
said Phil Williams, the University's director of
planning and land use.
Palo Alto usually does not alter proposals for
academically-related projects, such as renovation
of the Quad.
The city takes a more active interest in projects
which involve building on undeveloped land and
projects which are potential sources of revenue to

the city it they are annexed," Williams said.
City services
Santa Clara County provides no municipal ser
vices (water, sewage disposal, roads, etc.) to Stan
ford and usually requests that all urban develop
ments be annexed to nearby cities which provide
such services. However, Stanford has always been
an exception to this rule, since the University pro
vides services for its residents.
But tor practical purposes, Stantord has allowed
the city to annex areas like the shopping center
and the industrial park.
"The University would find it difficult to main
tain adequate municipal services to these areas, so
the city agreed to take that responsibility. In re
turn, the city receives substantial tax revenue trom
these sources — about one-third of total property
tax revenue tor the city. In these cases, annexation
is mutually beneficial," Williams said.
Residential vote required
The most recent area to be considered lor anne
xation is the proposed Peter Coutts Hill housing
project. Bob Summers, manager ot faculty and
staff housing here, said the University takes a
neutral view toward faculty housing being in or
out ot the city limits.
Residents must vote to approve annexation,
though, and the interest in being part ot the city
has never been that strong.
"If the residents vote for annexation, the Uni
versity has no objection," Summers said. How
ever, the University feels all or none of the hous
ing should be part of the city, since gerrymander
ing the housing areas would cause contusion for
residents and confusion over who is to provide
municipal services.
