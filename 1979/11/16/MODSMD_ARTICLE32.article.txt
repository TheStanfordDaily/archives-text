# Students help to provide undergraduate scholarships
## 
### Dean Eyre Senior staff writer 
Scholarships may not be the foremost
thought on the minds of students during
midterms, but for about 46 percent of the
University s undergraduates, such financial
assistance makes their Stanford education
possible.
This year one of the behind-the-scenes
groups responsible for helping to provide
scholarship funds is celebrating its 25th an
niversary. At a reception Tuesday evening,
student volunteers, scholarship recipients
and local business donors met tor the first
time to honor the Heritage Fund.
lili Bliss, a senior from Kansas City, Mo.
and 1980 chairman addressed the gathering
and recounted the organization's history.
The Heritage Fund was organized in 1955
by the senior c lass presidents who decided to
"make a gift in the torm ot student scholar
ship funds."
Local merchants donate
Bliss explained that the class presidents
solicited local merchants to build up the fund
and then donated the grants to members of
the incoming freshman class, "the idea being
that each graduating class would leave a le
gacy to assist deserving 112 reshmen who would
replace them in the student body the follow
ing year."
During its quarter century of service, the
fund has grown from 20 seniors to 60 volun

teers among all four classes and receives
funding from 45 donors in the Bay Area and
Los Angeles. Over the years more than
$400,000 has been raised, providing support
for 300 scholarships to freshmen and sopho
mores demonstrating financial need and
leadership potential.
Joel Smith, vice-president for develop
ment, described the group's work as "an in
spired tradition of Stanford students caring
enough to be involved in fund raising. It's a
commitment of caring — that's the essence
of a successful development program. The
Heritage Fund is symbolic of that success."
Students 'carry on'
Involved with the fund since 1965, Smith
explained that one of the reasons for this
"inspired tradition is that no matter what the
(University) climate is, Stanford students
have carried on — whether it was troubled
times, as in the late '60s, or the economic
troubles of today. I teel good about that."
"The Heritage Fund testifies to a shared
conviction that Stanford must be, and must
remain, open to quality students regardless
of their financial situation," said President
Richard Lyman. 'The challenge becomes
even more urgent — and more difficult —
with the inevitable yearly increases in tui
tion," Lyman added, "but I am delighted to
note that it is being met with as much vigor
and enthusiasm as I have seen in the years I
have been at Stanford."


President Richard Lyman talks with )oel Smith, vice president
of development for the Heritage Fund. The 25th anniversary
reception for the scholarship-raising organization was held
Tuesday at the Faculty Cluh.
