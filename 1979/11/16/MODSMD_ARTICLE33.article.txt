# Alum returns to autograph book
## 
### Karen Springen 
Gladys Heldman, who ma
jored in history as an under
graduate here returned to
campus last week to autograph
her most recent book.
In the years since gradua
tion, she has founded the Vir
ginia Slims Tennis circuit,
started a successful tennis
magazine and taught herself to
read Japanese.
Although Heldman, still a
tournament tennis player, has
written other books on tennis,
The Harmonetics Investigation
is her first novel.
The book concerns a make
believe sect that sweeps the
country in 1982. It illustrates
the power "an attractive leader
with a sureness of speaking"
can exercise, Heldman said. In
the book, "if cult members
drop out, leaders beat up on or
even murder them," she said.
Answers sought
A number of her friends
interested in cultism prompted
her to write the book, she said.
"Many pay $35 for a lecture by a
cult leader" hoping to receive
"all the answers," she said.
"It's surprising how many
people are into some sort of
belief, whether metaphysics or

some pseudo-science. Three
quarters of my friends believe
in something," she said.
Heldman took about a year
to complete the book, with
most of her time spent "rewrit
ing and rewriting." It came out
in mid-October and received a
good review from Publisher's
Weekly, according to
Heldman.
Autographed copies
Heldman, who now serves
on the Executive Hoard of the
Stanford Alumni Association,
is on a nation-wide promotion
tour. Autographed copies of
The Harmonetics Investigation
are available at the bookstore
lor $10.95.
After receiving a master's
degree in history at Cal,
Heldman played tennis on the
circuit for four years. She has
continued to play and qualified
for the Senior Indoor Nationals
last year.
In |une 1953 she started the
magazine World Tennis.
Twenty years later she sold it to
CBS for more than $2 million.
She still writes for the publica
tion.
Tournaments founded
In addition to founding the
Virginia Slims Tennis Circuit in
September 1970, she created
the Avon Futures Circuit for
women who do not qualify for
the Virginia Slims games.
Other projects include start
ing a company to place ac
complished women in top
board positions. Before her
program only eight percent of
the major companies had a
female on their boards. The
company increased this per
centage to 65.
For relaxation, Heldman
reads Japanese. She taught
herself to read Japanese
characters four years ago using
character dictionaries and
elementary readers. She com
pares her study of the language
to an "endless insoluble
crossword puzzle."
