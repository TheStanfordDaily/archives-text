# Stanford vs. California — the Big Game
## SPORTS Tomorrow's weaponry: pride, emotion and passing 
### Ivan Maisel 
As has been the norm most
ot the past decade, tomorrow's
Big Game between Stanford
and California comes down to
pride, emotion and bragging
rights for the next year.
There are no Pacitic-10 Con
terence titles, no Rose Bowl
trips, no bowl trips at all on the
line, only an 80-year-old axe
that has been swapped, stolen
and coveted ever since the
rivalry began.
But don't worry, that incen
tive is quite enough.
At 1 p.m. tomorrow, a capac
ity crowd ot 84,000 people, all
ol whom will be wearing either
red and white or blue and gold,
will be watching as the battle
over the axe commences.
The tabled blade has called
Stanford home tor so long that
the administration is consider
ing charging it rent. Fourteen

ol the last 18, tive ot the last six
and the last three Big Games
have been won by Stanford.
The last two have been par
ticularly embarrassing to the
Berkeleyites. Stantord trapped
the Bears 21-3 here two years
ago and then thoroughly
dominated them across the bay
last year, 30-10.
Those are the exceptions,
not the rule. Though everyone
harps constantly on how
"emotional" the Big Came is, it
is one cliche that has proven
itself trueyearatteryear: when
the teams are evenly matched,
the most emotional team wins.
Three years ago, a fired-up
Stantord team gave lame-duck
head coach lack Christiansen a
going-away present he would
never forget with a last-minute
27-24 victory.
The teams are just as evenly
matched in 1979: both have a

high-powered passoftense, an
average defense, a rollercoas
ter record and both need a win
to pull otf a winning season.
The similarities are most evi
dent on otfense. Stanford and
California possess two of the
most potent passing attacks in
the nation. Both teams have
lived with the pass and died
with the run, and each is
dangerous in their own fash
ion.
Behind rangy junior Rich
Campbell, California has
thrown for more yards than
anyone else in the conterence.
Their long-ball philosophy had
to be switched early in the sea
son, when fleet-footed receiv
ers Holden Smith and Floyd
Eddtngs were struck trom the
lineup by injuries.
Head coach Roger Theder
and the Cal coaching staff ad

justed their passing game ac
cordingly, utilizing shorter
passes and more ball-control.
The Bears have tour ot the top
10 receivers in the conference,
led by split end Matt Bou/a
with 51 catches. They also have
Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower worried.
"As a proponent ot the tor
ward pass, I never teel com
tortable going against it,"
Dowhower said. "San lose
State presented quite a chal
lenge to us (passing lor almost
400 yards) but now we're a little
more aware ot delending a
pass attack."
The Cards sit atop the Pac-IO
passing detense heap, with Cal
two notches below, but the
teams have not gone agjinst
one another, thus the stats are
artiticially low.
Dowhower added that the

tirst-team ottense scrimmaged
against the delense this week
to get them ready tor a passing
game ot the caliber ot C alitor
nia's.
The delense could hardly get
any better preparation. The
backbone ol the Stantord ot
tense, as always, is the pass. As
Dowhower said in the gloomy
attermath ot last week's loss to
Oregon, "We have to operate
lull-speed on ottense. When
we don't we have ditticulty."
At the throttle ol that lull
speed ottense will be Turk
Schonert, the gutsy senior
quarterback. Schonert's per
lormance has been a barome
ter ol the offense's perfor
mance all season, and no one is
more aware ol that than
Theder.
"Schonert has done an un
believable job lot what Stan
lord does," Theder said. "He's

a winner and linds a way (to
win) just like Campbell does."
Theder is more worried
about Schonert's favorite
target, junior llanker Ken
Margerum. The Fountain Val
ley native, billed as "Stanford's
llaky llanker" by The Sporting
News this week, has Cal's
coaching stall going insane.
' We'll put about three guys
on him," Theder said halt
seriously. "We'll have to dou
ble up on him. He and Matt
Bou/a are the class receivers
on the coast. You can't play
one coverage on him. He'll
move over and adjust his pat
tern."
It Margerum is tied up by hall
the Bears' defense, then that
leaves the rest ol the Stanford
attack lonesome tor attention.
Split end Andre Tyler has be
nefitted the most from
Margerum's double coverage,

snagging 41 passes lor tour
touchdowns and new-lound
respect, from defenses who
lind out that Stanlord has two
excellent receivers, not just
one.
Staniord's stellar defensive
backtield will also lind out that
the Bears have quite a lew
good receivers, 100. In addi
tion to Bouza, tight end Joe
Rose, Hanker Michael Buggx
and fullback Paul (ones repre
sent the Bears' in the Pac-10's
top receivers.
lones also represents
Calilornia's rushing game —
without him, Staniord's defen
sive line could think "pass 1 ' all
day long.
With two teams so evenly
matched, the result ol the Big
Game will come down to what
it usually comes down to —
emotion. Both squads' seniors
have been pulling aside the
ireshmen to let them know ol
the importance ol this year s
epic. In addition, they are try
ing other little stunts.
For the second year in a row,
the Cards will have the day be
lore the Big Came oil — no
practice. As lor the Bears,
Theder is trying a ditterent tac
tic.
"I promised our alumni a
good spectacle this game," the
Cal coach said. When asked
what type ol game is a good
spectators' game, Theder said,
"II depends on Rod and mine's
approach. In the Big Came,
both are usually afraid to take a
chance."
Theder then changed the
subject just a little.
"A good coaches' game is
2-0," he said with a sly smile,
"but thai isn't always a good
spectator's game."

more aware ol that than
Theder.
"Schonert has done an un
believable job lot what Stan
lord does," Theder said. "He's

a winner and linds a way (to
win) just like Campbell does."
Theder is more worried
about Schonert's favorite
target, junior llanker Ken
Margerum. The Fountain Val
ley native, billed as "Stanford's
llaky llanker" by The Sporting
News this week, has Cal's
coaching stall going insane.
' We'll put about three guys
on him," Theder said halt
seriously. "We'll have to dou
ble up on him. He and Matt
Bou/a are the class receivers
on the coast. You can't play
one coverage on him. He'll
move over and adjust his pat
tern."
It Margerum is tied up by hall
the Bears' defense, then that
leaves the rest ol the Stanford
attack lonesome tor attention.
Split end Andre Tyler has be
nefitted the most from
Margerum's double coverage,

snagging 41 passes lor tour
touchdowns and new-lound
respect, from defenses who
lind out that Stanlord has two
excellent receivers, not just
one.
Staniord's stellar defensive
backtield will also lind out that
the Bears have quite a lew
good receivers, 100. In addi
tion to Bouza, tight end Joe
Rose, Hanker Michael Buggx
and fullback Paul (ones repre
sent the Bears' in the Pac-10's
top receivers.
lones also represents
Calilornia's rushing game —
without him, Staniord's defen
sive line could think "pass 1 ' all
day long.
With two teams so evenly
matched, the result ol the Big
Game will come down to what
it usually comes down to —
emotion. Both squads' seniors
have been pulling aside the
ireshmen to let them know ol
the importance ol this year s
epic. In addition, they are try
ing other little stunts.
For the second year in a row,
the Cards will have the day be
lore the Big Came oil — no
practice. As lor the Bears,
Theder is trying a ditterent tac
tic.
"I promised our alumni a
good spectacle this game," the
Cal coach said. When asked
what type ol game is a good
spectators' game, Theder said,
"II depends on Rod and mine's
approach. In the Big Came,
both are usually afraid to take a
chance."
Theder then changed the
subject just a little.
"A good coaches' game is
2-0," he said with a sly smile,
"but thai isn't always a good
spectator's game."
As has been the norm most
ot the past decade, tomorrow's
Big Game between Stanford
and California comes down to
pride, emotion and bragging
rights for the next year.
There are no Pacitic-10 Con
terence titles, no Rose Bowl
trips, no bowl trips at all on the
line, only an 80-year-old axe
that has been swapped, stolen
and coveted ever since the
rivalry began.
But don't worry, that incen
tive is quite enough.
At 1 p.m. tomorrow, a capac
ity crowd ot 84,000 people, all
ol whom will be wearing either
red and white or blue and gold,
will be watching as the battle
over the axe commences.
The tabled blade has called
Stanford home tor so long that
the administration is consider
ing charging it rent. Fourteen

ol the last 18, tive ot the last six
and the last three Big Games
have been won by Stanford.
The last two have been par
ticularly embarrassing to the
Berkeleyites. Stantord trapped
the Bears 21-3 here two years
ago and then thoroughly
dominated them across the bay
last year, 30-10.
Those are the exceptions,
not the rule. Though everyone
harps constantly on how
"emotional" the Big Came is, it
is one cliche that has proven
itself trueyearatteryear: when
the teams are evenly matched,
the most emotional team wins.
Three years ago, a fired-up
Stantord team gave lame-duck
head coach lack Christiansen a
going-away present he would
never forget with a last-minute
27-24 victory.
The teams are just as evenly
matched in 1979: both have a

high-powered passoftense, an
average defense, a rollercoas
ter record and both need a win
to pull otf a winning season.
The similarities are most evi
dent on otfense. Stanford and
California possess two of the
most potent passing attacks in
the nation. Both teams have
lived with the pass and died
with the run, and each is
dangerous in their own fash
ion.
Behind rangy junior Rich
Campbell, California has
thrown for more yards than
anyone else in the conterence.
Their long-ball philosophy had
to be switched early in the sea
son, when fleet-footed receiv
ers Holden Smith and Floyd
Eddtngs were struck trom the
lineup by injuries.
Head coach Roger Theder
and the Cal coaching staff ad

justed their passing game ac
cordingly, utilizing shorter
passes and more ball-control.
The Bears have tour ot the top
10 receivers in the conference,
led by split end Matt Bou/a
with 51 catches. They also have
Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower worried.
"As a proponent ot the tor
ward pass, I never teel com
tortable going against it,"
Dowhower said. "San lose
State presented quite a chal
lenge to us (passing lor almost
400 yards) but now we're a little
more aware ot delending a
pass attack."
The Cards sit atop the Pac-IO
passing detense heap, with Cal
two notches below, but the
teams have not gone agjinst
one another, thus the stats are
artiticially low.
Dowhower added that the

tirst-team ottense scrimmaged
against the delense this week
to get them ready tor a passing
game ot the caliber ot C alitor
nia's.
The delense could hardly get
any better preparation. The
backbone ol the Stantord ot
tense, as always, is the pass. As
Dowhower said in the gloomy
attermath ot last week's loss to
Oregon, "We have to operate
lull-speed on ottense. When
we don't we have ditticulty."
At the throttle ol that lull
speed ottense will be Turk
Schonert, the gutsy senior
quarterback. Schonert's per
lormance has been a barome
ter ol the offense's perfor
mance all season, and no one is
more aware ol that than
Theder.
"Schonert has done an un
believable job lot what Stan
