# Stanford vs. California â€” the Big Game
## SPORTS Tomorrow's weaponry: pride, emotion and passing 
### Ivan Maisel 
As has been the norm most
ot the past decade, tomorrow's
Big Game between Stanford
and California comes down to
pride, emotion and bragging
rights for the next year.
There are no Pacitic-10 Con
terence titles, no Rose Bowl
trips, no bowl trips at all on the
line, only an 80-year-old axe
that has been swapped, stolen
and coveted ever since the
rivalry began.
But don't worry, that incen
tive is quite enough.
At 1 p.m. tomorrow, a capac
ity crowd ot 84,000 people, all
ol whom will be wearing either
red and white or blue and gold,
will be watching as the battle
over the axe commences.
The tabled blade has called
Stanford home tor so long that
the administration is consider
ing charging it rent. Fourteen

ol the last 18, tive ot the last six
and the last three Big Games
have been won by Stanford.
The last two have been par
ticularly embarrassing to the
Berkeleyites. Stantord trapped
the Bears 21-3 here two years
ago and then thoroughly
dominated them across the bay
last year, 30-10.
Those are the exceptions,
not the rule. Though everyone
harps constantly on how
"emotional" the Big Came is, it
is one cliche that has proven
itself trueyearatteryear: when
the teams are evenly matched,
the most emotional team wins.
Three years ago, a fired-up
Stantord team gave lame-duck
head coach lack Christiansen a
going-away present he would
never forget with a last-minute
27-24 victory.
The teams are just as evenly
matched in 1979: both have a

high-powered passoftense, an
average defense, a rollercoas
ter record and both need a win
to pull otf a winning season.
The similarities are most evi
dent on otfense. Stanford and
California possess two of the
most potent passing attacks in
the nation. Both teams have
lived with the pass and died
with the run, and each is
dangerous in their own fash
ion.
Behind rangy junior Rich
Campbell, California has
thrown for more yards than
anyone else in the conterence.
Their long-ball philosophy had
to be switched early in the sea
son, when fleet-footed receiv
ers Holden Smith and Floyd
Eddtngs were struck trom the
lineup by injuries.
