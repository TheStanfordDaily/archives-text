## Yearly memories and miracles 
### 
Chris Haft

Miracles usually don't re
peat themselves. After all,
last-second 56-yard field
goals, Second Comings and
cancelled final exams rarely
occur.
Yet since 1893, a miracle
has occurred and re
occurred 81 times. That
miracle is the Big Came, the
annual autumnal football
epic between Stanford and
California.
And no matter who wins,
what the score is or what
any jaded sportswriter tells
you, it's always an epic,
baby. Believe me.
November, 7977: My
black Columbia three
speed bicycle rattled as I
steered it down Calvez St.
toward Stanford Stadium. I
parked my bike, feeling sure
it would be stolen by one of
the thousands of people
milling about me. I walked
countless times around the
stadium, looking for Arthur,
my seventh-grade classmate
who promised me a Big
Came ticket. Forty-five mi
nutes before kickoff I found
Arthur. Smiling enigmati
cally, he informed me that
his mother, who allegedly
worked in the ticket office,
had not given him any extra
tickets. It was at that point
that I realized how much Ar
thur resembled an ugly fish.
I dejectedly unlocked my
bike and rode back down
Calvez through a stream of
fans and vendors.
for the remainder of the
afternoon I accompanied
my mother in her journeys
to various furniture stores.
Clutching my transistor
radio like Linus clutches his
security blanket, I listened
to Stanford win 14-9. We
were walking around the
corner of El Camino and
Santa Cruz in Menlo Park
when Stanford scored a
touchdown. I thought I

could hear the cheering if I
listened hard enough, but I
was too far away.
The sound didn't carry far
enough that day, which is
surprising. Big Games in
volve a lot of carrying,
whether it is the physical act
of carrying or being carried
away by emotion. The Big
Came tradition itself has
been carried throughout
the years — carried past
both World Wars, past the
Vietnam War, past dismal
years like 1960 when Stan
ford finished 0-10-0 and Cal
finished just 2-7-1.
Former Stanford head
coach Jack Christiansen,
after being notified of his fir
ing, was carried onto the
field by his players at the
1976 Big Came, one of the
most exciting ever. And
when you hear the Band
play "All Right Now" at
Gaieties, after being primed
by amusing entertainment,
don't you feel like the spirit,
the emotion, could carry
you through the roof?
November, 1977: Some of
my more intrepid freshman
dorm-mates had slept over
night outside the student
gate the night before the
Big Came. Lesser zealots
like myself promised to
bring them breakfast and
join them in line at Ba.m. So
there we were, sharing
bagels, bananas and the
sports page as we stared at
the circles - of fraternities,
dorms and those around
each others' eyes.
For three hours we shot
the bull, trying to shoot
down boredom. The bore
dom vanished when the
gates opened, partly be
cause it meant that there re
ally would be a game but
mainly because all the
boredom was squeezed out
of us by the crush of stu
dents fighting to get

through the gates. Brea
thing became difficult, as
did keeping one's temper.
The bolus of humanity sur
rounding the student entr
ance engulfed itself in
grunts and curses. "Jesus," I
asked, "why should we
have to suffer?"
Suffering is part of the Big
Game, though. Think of
Turk Schonert, Stanford's
quarterback. Not only did
he suffer on the bench for
tour years, but when he fi
nally got his chance to play,
everybody wanted him to sit
back down again. Now
Schonert has brought
people out of their seats
with his fine performances
during the Pacific-10 Con
ference season — now Stan
ford's Big Game euphoria
will liveor die with himas he
leads the Cardinals onto the
turf tomorrow.
Cal has suffered, too. All
those close losses! All those
goddamn pregame orations
by head coach Roger
Theder! "This is, without
question, the biggest game
of the year," Theder said
Monday, stating the obvi
ous. "I know they get tired
of my saying that because I
say it every week, but this
is."
Vet suffering takes a back
seat to psyching up for the
game. There's so much to
psych up for! What a battle!
Stanford vs. Cal, Hoover
Tower vs. the Campanile,
Zot's vs. the Come Back Inn,
the sons of the Cardinal and
White (or the offspring of
the Griffon, or the branches
of the Tree, however you
may be inclined) vs. the
Sturdy Golden Bear.
How do we at Stanford
psych up? Let me count the
ways: Band rallies, Gaieties,
drugs, sex, violence ... At
Cal, said star Bear fullback
Paul jones, "The student

body just drinks the whole
week."
November, 1978: Cal stu
dents may drink the whole
week, but for me, drinking
for an entire game is
enough. By the end of the
first quarter, I've downed
four glasses of lemonade
laced with vodka. Midway
through the second quarter,
when both the lemonade
and the orange juice ran
out, I call for straight rum.
Suddenly my head begins to
feel as big as the hot air bal
loons outside Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium. I yell
exuberantly each time
Stanford gains a first down,
but each scream sends a
shot of pain through my
cranium. Still I persist in
screaming, even though
Stanford's procession of
points and first downs ap
pears destined to bring me
permanent brain damage.
Why do I have to be such a
fanf I ask myself. But some
how the game ends. Some
how I catch BART back to
San Francisco. Somehow I
drive my car lawfully.
Somehow I swallow a
spaghetti dinner with three
friends, make it back to
campus and crash hard on
my bed.
Somehow the Big Game
lives on, though one may be
surprised at how such a
phenomenon could exist.
What brings thousands of
students to a city 35 miles
away one Friday night each
year to march riotiously
through its streets? Howcan
the middle of a football field
hold two entire teams for a
coin flip without the field
caving in? What causes
85,000 people to simultane
ously cry out in joy or
agony, but always in ex
citement?
I don't know. But what
ever it is, it's wonderful.
