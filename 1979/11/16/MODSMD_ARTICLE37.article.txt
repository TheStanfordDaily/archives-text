# Win or stay home for Cards
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
Emotional intensity is a very
important attribute for a team
in a desperate situation. And
when Stantord and California
sprint off in water polo tomor
row in deGuerre pool at 10:30
a.m., the Cardinals will be
stressing intensity.
Though desperate might be
a slightly extreme definition of
the Cards' situation, Stantord
coach Dante Dettamanti said
his team has "the greatest
motivation in the world" for
winning tomorrow's contest:
"It they don't win, they don't
go to the nationals."
It's that simple. The Cards
are currently in a three-way tie
lor second place in the
Pacitic-10 Conference, right
behind the Golden Bears.
When the NCAA champion
ships commence in Long
Beach over Thanksgiving, the
Bears and one other Pac-10
team will definitely be there.
Stanford's mission tomorrow
will be to beat Cal and be that
"other Pac-10 team."

Though the Cardinals are
ranked first in the nation ahead
of Cal, Dettamanti said the
Bears deserve the top ranking
on the basis of their record this
year. However, Dettamanti is
confident of a Cardinal vic
tory tomorrow.
"If this team plays up to its
capabilities, they can beat any
one," he said. "But, you need
the intensity."
Every team has a certain
amount ot talent, Dettamanti
explained, and in that category
Stanford and Cal match up very
closely. "But if you don't play
with (a lot of intensity), you can
get beat," he said. "Talent
alone is not going to do it."
Cardinal goalie |ohn Gansel
concurred that a major .factor
in tomorrow's game will be
"the psych." Gansel said the
home-crowd atmosphere has a
real effect on the team. "The
Santa Barbara game was unbe
lievable. (The support ot the
crowd) really helps you stay in
the game."
Gansel admitted that it is
possible to Ket too psyched,

"like USC does. You have to
maintain a balance between
psych and control," he said.
The Bears that Stantord will
have to control tomorrow will
be Carlos Steffens and Kevin
Robertson, the man who beat
the Cards almost single
handedly two weeks ago in
Berkeley.
"We know what Robertson
and Stettens are going to do,"
Dettamanti said. "We just have
to play accordingly. I think the
bigger pool (30 meters vs. Cal's
25 yards) will take away someo!
Robertson's effectiveness . . .
and Carlos won't be able to set
the hole every time. We've got
to try and keep him out of the
hole."
To combat the Bears' two
man attack, the Cards will
change their positioning on
Robertson in order to cut down
on the amount of time he uses
on his drives, according to
senior Randy Kalbus. "We've
got to torce more ot the (Cal)
team to come on offense," he
said.
