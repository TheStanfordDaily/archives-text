The Stanford field hockey
team plays ifs final three
matches ot the season today
and Saturday in the WAIAW
Region Eight Tournament at
I ong Beach State.
The tourney's contestants —
tirst-seed San )ose State,

second-seed Long Beach State,
third-seed Stanford University,
and tourth-seed UC-Berkeley
— are the same tour teams that
convened at Long Beach for
the Region Light's last year;
they ended up in a three-way
tie for second with San lose
finishing first.

These facts support Coach
longstreth's predictions for
Friday and Saturday's engage
ments: "It will be highly com
petitive, exciting hockey — the
extremely high level ot play will
be really challenging for the
kids. The teams are all very
close in ability."
The scotchers meet Long
Beach State in their first match,
9:30 Friday morning; 2: it) this
afternoon is the start for the
second game, against San lose
State. Saturday morning the
scotchers play their own Big

Bears in their last tournament
match.
Stantord enters this round
robin tournament with a strong
10-2-3 record but a slightly
weakened team: they suffer
the absence ot back Julia
Johnson, whose ankle was
fractured in the October 51
game with Sacramento State.
