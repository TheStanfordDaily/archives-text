# Iranians split on embassy crisis
## Captors reject compromise bid 
### Associated Press 
Islamic student militants, declar
ing they take orders only from the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the
Iranian people, rejected a suggestion
by Iranian officials yesterday that
they free the women and blacK hos
tages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
It was the latest sign of a major split
between Iranian authorities and
hundreds of students who have been
holding about 60 American and more
than 30 non-American hostages since
seizing the embassy Nov. 4.
President Jimmy Carter, who has
banned Iranian oil imports and fro
zen Iranian government assets in the
United States, said in a speech yes
terday to an AFL-CIO convention in
Washington that he was holding Ira
nian authorities "fully responsible"
for the safety of the hostages.
"They will be held accountable,"
he declared in a speech interrupted
repeatedly by loud applause and
whistles.
Carter, in his harshest statement
about the actions of Iranian leaders
in the 12-day-old crisis, said he found
it "unthinkable that any responsible
government" would try to pressure
another nation by using diplomats as
barter.
The president said the seizure of
the embassy and the Americans
stationed there*violated basic princi
ples of international law. He vowed
that the students occupying the em
bassy will not sway American policy.
Terrorism
"This is an act of terrorism totally

outside the bounds of international
law and diplomatic tradition," Carter
said. "This crisis calls for firmness
and restraint."
But Carter also said the United
States "will not compromise our
fundamental principle of justice, no
matter how grave the provocation."
He added: "The United States of
America will not yield to interna
tional terrorism or blackmail."
The president said taking the hos
tages has resulted in "anger and out
rage" from Americans. However, he
added, the United States will do no
thing that endangers the safety ol the
hostages.
Patience
He said the situation calls for pati
ence, perseverence and "measured,
deliberate action."
Carter said the U.S. government
will continue to use its influence

around the world to obtain the safe
release of the hostages and will take
no action "that could be used to jus
tify violence or imprudent action by
anyone."
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ib
rahim Mokkala later told The As
sociated Press women and blacks
"possibly" would be freed "due to
the fact that Islam has got a lot ot
respect for women and due to the
fact we consider blacks to be oppres
sed people."
No compromise
The embassy militants responded
negatively and angrily:
"Something like this will not be
considered," Tehran radio quoted
them as saying in a statement. "Our
conditions are known . . . We de
nounce any negotiations concerning
the hostages' release betore the Un
ited States extradites the deposed
shah."
