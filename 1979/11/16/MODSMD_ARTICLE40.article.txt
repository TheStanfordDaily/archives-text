# Friday interviews: Dowhower and Theder
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
Jenkins: Stanford has beaten or tied some of the better teams in
the nation, and lost to the teams they should have beaten. What
does that indicate to you about the team?
Dowhower: I ponder that a great deal; it's the source of a lot of
trustration. I think that it you take a close look at the teams
considered "no name," you will tind they have good records;
Tulane and Oregon are greatly improved over last year. Army and
Oregon State are not the powers of college football, but there are
going to be weeks when you're just not up. To believe that you are
going to be high tor every game is talse; hopetully you can
overcome that and win however you can.
Explanation-? I don't really have any. We haven't had time to
really think about it after a loss we have immediately started
preparing for the next game. We have a young team, and we have
had some injuries that hurt us. There have also been situations
where what teams have done is matched up perfectly with our
weaknesses.
11 we can beat Cal, then those games where we were successtul
will stand out.
Jenkins: How would you compare Turk Schonert and the Cal
quarterback, Rich Campbellt
Dowhower: lurk is a tremendous competitor. He doesn't have
the physical endowments that Campbell has, but he finds a way to
get the ball down field. He has had outstanding games against
some o! the top competitors in the country. He rolls out more;
lie's an option quarterback.
Rich is more apt to get set in the pocket. He's a big, strong
quarterback. He puts more velocity on the ball; he stays in there
and powers the ball down there. He's carried their offense.
There is no one player than can make a difference. Football is a
team game, and no one person can win it. So the pressure is not
on Turk and Rich to win the game. They are both fine performers.
Jenkins: Is there any chance at all that il Stanford beats Cal, the
team will get a bowl bidi
Dowhower: I don't see us being invited because ot our win-loss
record. We had our opportunities and we lost them. If we can
beat Cal, our cross-town rivals, that would erase some of the
frustration. I don't know if we should beat them; they have a
great defense and they can move the ball. We will have to take
advantage ot their mistakes.
Jenkins: What do you think your biggest problem will be against
Cali
Dowhower: We have to move the ball against their defense. The
front seven is very strong. We also have to pressure the passer, so
our defenders can cover their receivers; the more time he has to
get the ball off, the harder it will be, and he has a better chance ot
completing the pass.
Jenkins: Do you leel that you have improved as a coach this
season? Have yr*u learned a lotf
Dowhower: I have an opinion about how coaches are evaluated. I

don't think anyone evaluates himselt more critically than a coach
or a player. I think, I hope, that I have learned from each game.
When you are able to sit back alter an 11-game season, then you
can put it into perspective. But in the middle of competition it's
hard.
Jenkins: Can you pinpoint two moments this season that were the
most satisfying, and the most disappointing?
Dowhower: I thought after the Boston College game, that was
satisfying, because we had just gone through a very frustrating
three weeks, even though we beat San lose State. The team
became cohesive that game.
One of the most satisfying things is to see the young and older
players working so well together, and giving an outstanding ef
fort even though we had some frustrating games. We had a lot of
times where we rose to the occasion; we performed better than
anyone expected us to, than we were supposed to.

Jenkins: How would you compare Rich Campbell and Turk
Schonert?
Theder: Well, Rich is a superb athlete. He's one of those that has a
tremendous amount of God-given ability. He's got all the tools to
be a great quarterback: a great arm, brilliant mind. Turk doesn't
have all the talent that Rich does, but he's getting everything he
can out of it. Both of them are having the best season they could
have.
lenkins: Cal has done a complete turnaround from last season.
What do you attribute that to?
Theder: We have some real quality kids in the program, for one
thing. We have the finest coaching staff I have ever worked with.
Everyone is working together; the kids believe in the coaching
staff. That's what is most important. Vou can have (he best
athletes in the world, but it there is no feeling there, it won't
work.
lenkins: What do you see as Stanford's most dangerous aspect?
Theder: Probably their ability to move the ball â€” like us. That's the
key; our defense is going to have to hold fhem. We have, I think,
one ot the best defenses 6n the Coast. People underestimate us
in that respect. Our defense can control their offense, I think,
lenkins: Can you pinpoint the most satisfying moment, and the
most disappointing one of this season?
Theder: I can't pinpoint a moment; I think the whole season has
been extremely satistying, probably the best one that I have had
in my career. The kids have been great. I'm very proud of them
and the way they have handled the season. There were some
disappointing games, of course, that were really close. We could
have been a 10-1 team it we had won the close ones.
lenkins: What do you think the point spread will be?
Theder: I think you're talking two or three points. It will go right
down the wire. These games are alwavsclose. with the exception
o' last year (Stanford, 30-10), and 1975 (Cal 48-15).

When you are able to sit back alter an 11-game season, then you
can put it into perspective. But in the middle of competition it's
hard.
Jenkins: Can you pinpoint two moments this season that were the
most satisfying, and the most disappointing?
Dowhower: I thought after the Boston College game, that was
satisfying, because we had just gone through a very frustrating
three weeks, even though we beat San lose State. The team
became cohesive that game.
One of the most satisfying things is to see the young and older
players working so well together, and giving an outstanding ef
fort even though we had some frustrating games. We had a lot of
times where we rose to the occasion; we performed better than
anyone expected us to, than we were supposed to.

Jenkins: How would you compare Rich Campbell and Turk
Schonert?
Theder: Well, Rich is a superb athlete. He's one of those that has a
tremendous amount of God-given ability. He's got all the tools to
be a great quarterback: a great arm, brilliant mind. Turk doesn't
have all the talent that Rich does, but he's getting everything he
can out of it. Both of them are having the best season they could
have.
lenkins: Cal has done a complete turnaround from last season.
What do you attribute that to?
Theder: We have some real quality kids in the program, for one
thing. We have the finest coaching staff I have ever worked with.
Everyone is working together; the kids believe in the coaching
staff. That's what is most important. Vou can have (he best
athletes in the world, but it there is no feeling there, it won't
work.
lenkins: What do you see as Stanford's most dangerous aspect?
Theder: Probably their ability to move the ball â€” like us. That's the
key; our defense is going to have to hold fhem. We have, I think,
one ot the best defenses 6n the Coast. People underestimate us
in that respect. Our defense can control their offense, I think,
lenkins: Can you pinpoint the most satisfying moment, and the
most disappointing one of this season?
Theder: I can't pinpoint a moment; I think the whole season has
been extremely satistying, probably the best one that I have had
in my career. The kids have been great. I'm very proud of them
and the way they have handled the season. There were some
disappointing games, of course, that were really close. We could
have been a 10-1 team it we had won the close ones.
lenkins: What do you think the point spread will be?
Theder: I think you're talking two or three points. It will go right
down the wire. These games are alwavsclose. with the exception
o' last year (Stanford, 30-10), and 1975 (Cal 48-15).

Jenkins: Stanford has beaten or tied some of the better teams in
the nation, and lost to the teams they should have beaten. What
does that indicate to you about the team?
Dowhower: I ponder that a great deal; it's the source of a lot of
trustration. I think that it you take a close look at the teams
considered "no name," you will tind they have good records;
Tulane and Oregon are greatly improved over last year. Army and
Oregon State are not the powers of college football, but there are
going to be weeks when you're just not up. To believe that you are
going to be high tor every game is talse; hopetully you can
overcome that and win however you can.
Explanation-? I don't really have any. We haven't had time to
really think about it after a loss we have immediately started
preparing for the next game. We have a young team, and we have
had some injuries that hurt us. There have also been situations
where what teams have done is matched up perfectly with our
weaknesses.
11 we can beat Cal, then those games where we were successtul
will stand out.
Jenkins: How would you compare Turk Schonert and the Cal
quarterback, Rich Campbellt
Dowhower: lurk is a tremendous competitor. He doesn't have
the physical endowments that Campbell has, but he finds a way to
get the ball down field. He has had outstanding games against
some o! the top competitors in the country. He rolls out more;
lie's an option quarterback.
Rich is more apt to get set in the pocket. He's a big, strong
quarterback. He puts more velocity on the ball; he stays in there
and powers the ball down there. He's carried their offense.
There is no one player than can make a difference. Football is a
team game, and no one person can win it. So the pressure is not
on Turk and Rich to win the game. They are both fine performers.
Jenkins: Is there any chance at all that il Stanford beats Cal, the
team will get a bowl bidi
Dowhower: I don't see us being invited because ot our win-loss
record. We had our opportunities and we lost them. If we can
beat Cal, our cross-town rivals, that would erase some of the
frustration. I don't know if we should beat them; they have a
great defense and they can move the ball. We will have to take
advantage ot their mistakes.
Jenkins: What do you think your biggest problem will be against
Cali
Dowhower: We have to move the ball against their defense. The
front seven is very strong. We also have to pressure the passer, so
our defenders can cover their receivers; the more time he has to
get the ball off, the harder it will be, and he has a better chance ot
completing the pass.
Jenkins: Do you leel that you have improved as a coach this
season? Have yr*u learned a lotf
Dowhower: I have an opinion about how coaches are evaluated. I

don't think anyone evaluates himselt more critically than a coach
or a player. I think, I hope, that I have learned from each game.
