# President tosses hat into ring – as our Guest Greek
## 
### 
The grandeur of the Big
Came requires that the Daily
seek out a very special sahib
tor its Cuest Creek of the
Week. After traveling far and
wide - to such exotic valhal
las as Burhngame and
Mountain View - our search
took us to Building 10 of the
quad. There we found our
ideal Greek, University Pres
ident Richard Lyman. Before
departing for a meeting of
all-time great Guest Greeks
(with such notables as
Euripides attendingi in
Sparta, Lyman bestowed
some ol his Grecian gridiron
formulas upon our thanklul
heads:
It is well-known that
bureaucrats never move
without massive consulta
tion. Lacking time to make
widespread inquiries, or to
have the necessary forms til
led out in quintuplicate, I've
made up in quality for the
lack of quantity, by getting

free advice from the Pro
vost, Don "Statue ol Liberty
Play" Kennedy. Whatever
differences we had ovei
exact scores are skilltully
concealed by masterly
compromise.
Oregon State at Arizona —
Arizona will revive suffi
ciently to pull this one out
under its home sun.
West Virginia at Arizona
State — Mountaineers to be
deserted. ASU will win, with
all its persons playing.
UCLA at Oregon — The
webs will appear to be on
the mired feet ol the Bruins
this time.
Washington State at
Washington — It should be a
rout for the vengeance
hungry Huskies.
California at Stanford —
Campbell will attempt to
put us in the soup, but this
close to Turk(ey) Day how
can we lose?
