january 1, 1969, two profes
sors ot English Literature hurtle
past one another somewhere
above the North Pole at a com
bined speed ot 1200 mph. They
are the two halves ot an
Anglo-American university ex
change program. Philip Swal
low, an unassuming British lec
turer, is about to be thrust into
the sunny, liberated and politi
cally turbulent world of
Euphoric State University
somewhere on America s West
coast.
His opposite number, Mor
ris /app, Euphoric State's
number one authority on Jane
Austen, is about to take his
place on the English faculty of
the traditional but undistin
guished University ot Rum
midge somewhere in England's
industrial midlands.
Swallow is trying to recap
ture a bit ot his lost youth, his
honeymoon spent in the west
coast city ot Esseph (S.E.?) ac
ross the bay from Euphoric
State, /app is going to England
at the request ol his w.te, in
hopes that his absence will
make her change her mind
about their impending di
vorce. In the six months of
their exchange these two men
will change places in ways
which they never intended.

David Lodge's Changing
Places is a humorous novel ol
University lite, in the same vein
as Kingsley Amis' brilliant
Lucky Jim or Malcolm Brad
bury's The History Man, but
with a new twist: Lodge takes
on two universities and two
radically ditterent cultures.
This seems to be where he
goes wrong. He is torced to
spend so much ot his energy
describing and comparing the
two ditterent worlds, Rum
midge and Euphoric State, that
he has very little left over tor
characters or plot, lodge sub
ordinates everything which
might make the novel interest
ing to the settings in which it

takes place. Events and charac
ters become devices to high
light various aspects of the cul
tural contrast.
While the observations
about university life are olten
lunny, they are simply observa
tions. They do not add to the
story. Instead, it seems, the
story is drawn around them
like a paper bag in order to
keep them all in one place.
This subordination ot
characters and plot to

backdrop causes structural
problems. Changing Places is
not simply a novel. It is a
multi-media event. It begins as
a novel, becomes an epistolary
novel, a series ot news clip
pings, a novel again, and, fi
nally, a screen play. There is
nothing wrong with this sort ol
razzle-dazzle in itselt. Better
writers have done more out
rageous things. However,
these translormations are not
artistically inspired. They are
dictated by necessity.
In the tirst section ol the
book the two prolessors arrive
at their respective destinations
and are exposed to their new
environments. Swallow gets a

second-tloor apartment in a
landslide zone. The lirst floor is
inhabited by three women
drop-outs. He goes to a boozy
departmental cocktail party
and encounters a beautiful
black pantheress. He goes
home and gets involved in a
salad oil orgy.
Meanwhile, /app gels a
room in the house ol a c omical
Irish doctor with a toothless
country niece. He is intro
duced to the lunatic chairman

ot the Rummidge English de
partment, a veteran ol Dun
kirk, and complains about the
English lack ot central heating.
By the time these and a number
ol other extraneous scenes
have been played out we have
covered more than one
hundred ol the book's two
hundred and titty pages and
none ol the 'changing places
promised in the title has taken
place.
Suddenly, the book shilts
gears. In the pages ol letters
and news items which follow
the world is turned upside
down. Months pass quickly,
iro/en urine tails trom the sky,
riots break out on both cam
puses, Swallow is jailed as a
radical, and /app becomes act
ing chairman ol the Rummidge
English department.
By the time we reemerge
into narrative prose some liity
pages later, the promised
translormations have taken
place. Swallow is sleeping with
/app s wite and /app is well on
the way to sleeping with Swal
low s. Forced to change pace
alter the tirsl hundred pages ol
more or less static desi ription,
the author has solved his prob
lems.
In one swoop he has gotten
through the bulk ol his story,
and the plot has been con
densed out ol existence. The
author resorts to another unor
thodox tactic, screenplay lor

mat, in order to briny his story
to a close. Again the innovation
does nothing lor the novel.
This is not to say Changing
I'foces isn't a tunny book. The
parodies ol British and Calitor
nian domestic lite are cruel and
wondertul. The gatherings ol
ti e various university laculties
are done with special care.
The centerpiece ot David
Lodge's Changing Places is the
contrast between British and
Cahtornian university lite. This
descriptive element becomes
so important that it over
shadows more conventional
elements, characters and plot,
which, it given their proper
place, might make the novel
more interesting, more reada
ble, and, perhaps, a great deal
tunnier.
