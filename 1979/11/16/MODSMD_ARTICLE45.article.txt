What has the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle to do with ja// improvisation! 1
What is bio-grammar? What does the lor
midable woid "paralinguistics" meanf
The answers to these questions and more
will not be lound in David Sudnow's new
book, 7«»/Ac's Rody.
Horn-again sociologist Sudnow c alls his
work a "Meditation Between Two
Keyboards." The key word in this clever
title would have to be "Between" in that
the author makes no definitive judg
ments about the creative process and even
avoids proposing answers to the abstruse
questions he has so deliberately con
ceived.
The book is a stream ol Sudnow's cogita
tions about the act ol cogitating. His pre
mise is valid and interesting, yet it
materializes in a manner as romantic as it is
unjustitied. The author juxtaposes his
typewriter with his piano in a Quixotic

quest lor the basis ol "improvisational
choices" which are by nature at least partly
unconscious.
He probes lor the anatomic al center, lor
musical "chops," ignoring that all impor
tant element ol genius in musical art. Sud
now tries to measure and It) quantity
something which is difficult even to de
iine.
The loftiness ol Sudnow s meditations
lend them an undeserved air ol t redibility.
The complex terms coined by the author
are seldom defined and have I• 'tie c ontex
tual meaning. His use ol various scripts,
deletions ol punctuation, and drawings ol
stick ligures visually indicate to the
reader in an economical and intimidating
sort ot way, that a point is being made. The
author'sgimmic ksdo not, however, speak
tor themselves.
The interesting possibilities which arise
in T,\lk s liody are lor the most par t poorly
exploited: the comparison between ja//
and competitive sports, ja// artists and
stand-up comedians, and the idea ol lip
listening," which I suppose must be the
analog to lip reading.

I ortunately tlie author realizes his many
practical and conceptual problems. In the
prelace he advises the reader that his ideas
"are teally thoughts about tlie same things
over ape) over. There are only so many
places to go. This is not altogether true.
Nudnow limits the virtually intinite territ
ory ot improvisation to "so many places,"
and then ironically does not go anywhere
at all in his thoughts.
I his is partly beeause he has chosen the
wrong vehicle tor expression. There is the
component ot meditation in ja// to he
sure, but in addition there isdetinite torm,
thematic statements and connections
known as "bridges" in the music. Sud
now's directionless, amorphous discus
sion ot this c omplex art torm tocuses upon
only one ot its components — that ot
meditation.
This locus (or lack ot locus) results in a
contusing and repetitive jumble ol ideas.
The author sees this weakness and ends
his book on a note ot deteat: ... and
now I know I'm being repetitive and so I'll
stop." And not a moment too soon.
