# A
						singular man speaks of his craft
## 
### 
I. P. Donleavy has written
eight novels, five plays, one
collection of short stories and a
non-fiction "manual of survival
and manners." His publishing
house, Delacorte/Seymour
Lawrence, has declared Oc
tober to be "Donleavy Month."
On October 22, Donleavy was
in San Francisco, where I talked
with him over lunch at the Press
Club. The interview was taped
and transcribed, amended only
for clarity of expression, espe
cially with regard to my ques
tions, which were occasionally
scrambled by the demands of
speaking, listening, eating and
managing my cutlery.

Daily: Have you ever written
any kinds of fiction different
from those published?
Donleavy: I don't think I
have. I have a volume of short
stories and The Unexpurgated
Code, an irreverent etiquette
manual, which is about as
much as I've departed. And my
plays and things.
Daily: How do you know
when an idea, a character de
serves to be handled as a novel,
or as a short story?
Donleavy: Yes, that's a fas
cinating question. Perhaps if
the incident is strong enough,
then that's enough to domi
nate the character. It it's about
a particular incident.
Daily: 7hen that would pre
dicate a short story?

Donleavy: Yeah, I think that
would decide it.
Daily: But throughout your
novels, you have particular in
cidents.
Donleavy: Yes, but in each
chapter, as it were.
Daily: Do you think chapters
can stand alone?
Donleavy: To some degree.
Because people do accept
them, and serial rights are
bought and they go into a
magazine.
Daily: Do you have any favo
rite living writers! 1
Donleavy: I'm not a great
reader of fiction. In fact, I ha
ven't read a book of fiction for
years and years. My life as a
novelist is taken up with my
own work or the business of
promoting it.
Daily: I've read that you
said you may spend three
months on the first three pages
of a novel. How do your novels
untold? Do you write sequen
tially from beginning to end? Is
the novel extensively plotted
before it's begun?
Donleavy: It tends to untold.
I have a general idea and I do
work in terms of actually finish
ing a page, then going on to the
next page and regarding that
tirst page as being finished,
and then the second page as
being finished, and so on. Any
single page could go through
seven, even 12 dratts. Fi
nally I will decide that this page

is finished.
I have an unusual way of
working with manuscripts — I
don t know of any other author
using it — the whole, entire
manuscript is in one piece,
every single word that I put
into the manuscript ends up in
one single piece. As I paste
pages to one another, the
comprehensive page becomes
ten, twelve feet long. That's a
method that evolved after my
second and third book.
Daily: So when you get to the
end ot the book, there's very
little rewriting to be done.
Donleavy: It's finished then,
yeah. The rewriting has been
done in the course of the book.
Daily: Do you have the end
in mind before you begin a
novel?

. . I haven't read a book of fiction for years
and years. My life as a novelist is taken up
with my own work . . /

Donleavy: Not exactly. You
sometimes come across the
end when you get about half
way, three-quarters-way
through. Often you'll pick an
end out ot somewhere in the
course of the book. That's
happened once or twice.
Daily: Are you now in contact
with Schult/? Once you write a
character to the end ol his

novel, is he finished for you?
Donleavy: I hate to see the
end of Schultz because I
adored writing the book so
much. But I think one has to
forge on in the literary trade.
Daily: Do you think that be
cause your work has tended
toward the obscene, your repu
tation as a serious writer has
been diminished? And do you
care?
Donleavy: I may have. Yes, in
terms of being a serious, seri
ous writer, I'm sure it has. And
certainly I don't care. If I did,
probably I'd do otherwise. I
think it's true to say, obscenity
prevents you from becoming a
sacred cow in literary circles.
Daily: Do you take notes,
keep a notebook?
Donleavy: Voluminous

notes. Constantly.
Daily: So, in real lile, you do
say, "Ah, that may be useful
some day"?
Donleavy: I always have a
notebook with me and each
entry has reterence marks to
things I might be working on.
For instance, I will probably
add to The Unexpurgated
Code. I have a thing I wrote this

morning on automatic doors:
"You must remember that
these do not normally react to
your personal muscle power."
Daily: Do you have a ritual
that helps squeeze the creative
juices?
Donleavy: I think that's ex
tremely important. The period
of time between actually awa
kening in the morning and the
time you actually sit at your
desk to work should be the
most protected time of your
day. No one should come near
you or have anything to do with
you. Otherwise all kinds of
precious reveries get shat
tered. Good authorship is day
dreaming, basically daydream
ing.
Daily: If you had to choose
one novel to survive you,
which would it be?
Donleavy: I suppose A Singu
lar Man is the one book that
interests me a lot. Probably be
cause it's the most autobiog
raphical. My litigation with The
Ginger Man totally colors A
Singular Man. That's one of the
reasons I feel a lot of sympathy
tor Howard Hughes.
Daily: You've said, "I dislike
writers,' especially American
writers. They're constantly on
the outlook for grants, so they
can avoid working for a living.
Grants and fellowships are es
tablished to destroy writers and
they succeed. My business is to
put out some work and make a
living at it."
Do you still feel that way
about grants and fellowships?
Certainly it's no longer possi
ble to live on $11 a week as you
did when you wrote The
Ginger Man.

Donleavy: In a rich country
like this, if someone is pre
pared to accept a certain
amount of self-deprivation, he
can be an author. You can go
out, get a job, live in the worst
part ot town in a sleazy room,
isolate yourself from your
Iriends, walk wherever you
want to go, live off the fruit that
you buy somewhere, you can
save money, enough money to
support yourself to sit down
for a year and write a novel.
A grant presupposes that
somebody is sitting over you.
There's no question that
money is the root ot it all. I did
have advantages to some de
gree: I had parents who never
questioned what I wanted to
do, for instance. That was a big
help. I also had an allowance
Irom home for a long time.
Another way ot looking at it:
you have a child who wants to
be a writer; the parent says
don't go to college, I'll support
you tor tour years, see if you
can write a novel. I've treated
my son in a similar fashion. I
said there's tour years that you

have it you want towaste it and
go to a university and hang
around.
Years and years ago, this wri
ter, Saul Bellow, had read The
Ginger Man, wrote me a letter
and said, hey look, let me
propose you for a grant, a fel
lowship. He said, if I recom
mend this, you're pretty sure
to get it and I wrote back and
said, no I wasn't interested in
that kind of thing.
Daily: Do you feel that
academia poses the same
threat?
Donleavy: When they say the
novel is finished, this is really
what is finished. The
academics have gone about
destroying tiction. Now if there
is any reason why the public
distrusts the literary world, it's
because of the academics who
produce their books and
novels and try to get readers to
buy them. This has done un
told damage, but we have
overcome this. There are
enough good, professional
writers in America to be an an
tidote to that.
