One ot Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though tins
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie

contrasts an arena ot relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder ol
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's tirst tnglish language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
storaro (who also did the photo
graphy in Apocalypse Slow) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions ot his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it. In a very different role, |ill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered pertor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best thing
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi

Sort of like C.odspell with dirty

are lost in the drivel; it's all
tunny, but it goes on for much

I he greatest gangster movie
ever made, hut it's a lot more
than that in the end. Writer
director Irancis Ford Coppola
takes Mario Puzo's epic, pulpy
book and dares to take chances
with it. Ifi.it is, he accepts the
novel's dimensions and its tone
and comes up with something
greater than anyone (except
Coppola?) expected: a big, juic \
lustful and violent look al the
criminal subculture in America.
Marlon Brando tills Ins cheeks
with orange peels and talks in a
tired, beaten, world wise voice;

the movie revolves around his
compelling presence as the God
father.
Al Pacino, lames Caan, Diane
Keaton, Talia Shire and the late
|ohn Cazale became famous via
their supporting roles; you're at
tracted and repelled by all ot
them. Three hours ol flashy, lurid
excitement made by a man
whose sense ol tlashmess and
luridness (as well as just about
every other important movie
sense) is just about the best
around.

Mel Brooks really needs Gene

screenplay, and Ins pertormance
as Doc toi I rankenstein begins to
remind you ot Buster Keaton.
Brooks comes close to what can
be termed "good direction,' and
his use ol black-and-white

Apocalypse How k ★ * *

Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb < inematogiapher Vit
torio Storaro, ( oppola c reates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross
horribly fascinate some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse

Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.

//if Godfather, Part II * ★ * *
New Varsity, Wednesday-Thursday
A little messy around the edges,
but still a very great American
movie. More subdued, more intro
spective than its predecessor; this
sequel sometimes lacks the vulgar
energy that drove the earlier movie,
but Part II is more textured, more
complex, more troubling.
The movie explores the period

One ot Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though tins
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie

contrasts an arena ot relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder ol
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's tirst tnglish language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
storaro (who also did the photo
graphy in Apocalypse Slow) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions ot his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it. In a very different role, |ill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered pertor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best thing
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi

An amazing work of mad

Producer-director Francis Cop

Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by

stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality

structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross
horribly fascinate some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse

Now is, I think, the best Ameri

the profound questions that it

Mel Brooks really needs Gene

Brooks comes close to what can

Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb < inematogiapher Vit
torio Storaro, ( oppola c reates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross
horribly fascinate some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse

Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.

A little messy around the edges,

The movie explores the period

One ot Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though tins
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie

contrasts an arena ot relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder ol
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's tirst tnglish language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
storaro (who also did the photo
graphy in Apocalypse Slow) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions ot his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it. In a very different role, |ill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered pertor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best thing
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi
ment ot sell-destructive eroti
c ism.

Sort of like C.odspell with dirty

are lost in the drivel; it's all
tunny, but it goes on for much
too long. Python takes aim at bi
blical epics, terrorist logistics,
and the PLO; while they don't
always score, even a series of
bullseyes would be boring. A
Python movie needs a better plot
than the Bible can provide.
