# Iranians here remain quiet on hostage issue
## Iranians keep low profile 
### Andrea James 
Both American and Iranian stu
dents on campus are remaining quiet
about the current situation of hos
tages in Tehran, contrary to a report
published on the tront page of yes
terday's Peninsula Times Tribune.
Meanwhile, University officials are
expected to decide early next week if
they will comply with requests from
the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) in San Francisco to fur
nish names, addresses and phone
numbers of all Iranian students here
on student visas.
The Times Tribune reported that a
Middle Eastern restaurant owner
tired four Iranian waiters because
Stanford students threatened to
boycott his restaurant if he didn't.
The newspaper also alleged that
Iranian students here are reacting
more strongly to the Iranian crisis
than are students at UC-Berkeley.

Dr. Manocher Ahmadi of Los Al
tos, a senior staft psychiatrist at Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center in San
Jose, was cited as the source for this
information.
Ahmadi told the Daily last night,
however, that he was misquoted in
the Times Tribune and that he had no
idea who had threatened the re
staurant owner.
And Ahmadi's brother, also con
tacted by the Daily last night, said
that his information on reaction at
Stanford was obtained second-hand
from rumors at Cal, and he could not
confirm the statements in the Times
Tribune.
One observer here called the
claims "absurd."
"I know nothing of this, and I don't
condone such outrageous be
havior," said Roger Strauch, a
graduate student here who passed
out llyers List week urging students
to send telegrams to their senators
and representatives calling lor the
deportation ot Iranian students
should harm betali the American
hostages in Tehran.
Strauch's actions last week have
been the only reac tion observed
here.
At the same time, s< hool adminis
trators are deciding what intorma
tion to supply to INS on Iranian stu
dents currently enrolled here.
"It is possible that there are some
things they (INS otiicialsi might ask
our students that we would sinmlv

not want to lit* a party to," explained
Robert Kosen/weig, vice-president
tor public all,nrs here. "We want to
know what kind ot inquiries they in
tend to make."
lie said that, while the University
wants to be as cooperative as possi
ble, we want to be sure we are not
being asked to compromise our
principles under pressure."
I he I University has also been asked
by INS lo provide a room on campus
where oltic i.ils c an interview Iranian
students.
University President Richard
Iv man will make the tinal decision on
these issues.
