## 
### Julie Kaufmann 
Any ASSU Senator or alternate
who misses more than two consecu
tive meetings of a total oi tour meet
ings in any one quarter will be rele
gated to the last alternate's position
according to stiffened attendance
requirements adopted by the senate
Wednesday night.
The member, it a senator, would
be replaced by the highest ranking
alternate.
The regulation includes both
committee and senate meetings and
stipulates that absences may be ex
cused at the discretion of the senate
chair. The chair can also determine
"partial attendance ol a meeting . . .
to constitute an absence."
leshe Torvik, rules committee
chairperson, explained that a
member arriving at a meeting just he
fore adjournment might be < ounted
absent, but a member leaving a meet
ing early would probably be ex
cused.
Under the former senate rules, a
senator could miss any tour meetings
per quarter; but the rules did not
include committee meetings and did
not apply to alternates.
