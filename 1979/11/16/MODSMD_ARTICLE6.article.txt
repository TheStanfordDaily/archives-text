# Unfair labor practices charged
## SLAC workers file union suit with labor board 
### Kathleen McClung 
A charge of unfair labor practices
has been filed with the National
labor Relations Board (NIRB) by
employees at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), according
to loyce Tipps-Coats, president ot
the SLAC Women's Association.
The ongoing controversy between
management and SLAC emloyees
centers around unionizing activity
which grew out of the SI AC Wo
men's Association.
SLAC Director ot Personnel Doug
Dupen said he prohibited 18
employees from attending women's
association meetings early in the
summer. These employees, he said,
are "supervisors" and thus ineligible
to participate in union organizing.
"The National Labor Relations

(NLR) Act of 1937 makes it illegal lor
management to interfere with, par
ticipate in, or monitor union ac
tivities," he said. He classified his ac
tion as an effort to avoid possible
lawsuits against the University.
"It shook us up that supervisors
were involved" in the beginnings of
union activity within the Women's
Association," Dupen said. "It got
scarier and scarier, so I phoned the
supervisors and asked thpm to
please stop going to the meetings."
Tipps-Coats claimed, however,
that the 18 involved "are not super
visors. If they are, they should be
formally re-classified and compen
sated."
The employees were told last
summer that they taced termination
of their jobs if they continued attend

ing the meetings, she said, adding,
"this is a First Amendment viola
tion."
The SLAC Women's Association,
according to Tipps-Coats, was origi
nally created in 1976 as "a support
group,'' which invited speakers on
topics such as child-care, rape,
breast cancer and other women's is
sues.
During the summer, association
members learned that their group
had received a lower wage increase
than union members, Tipps-Coats
said. The group responded by invit
ing two labor unions to speak at its
meetings.
"We had considered a class-action
suit," said Tipps-Coats, but a steer
ing committeewas created instead to

investigate the possibility of aligning
with United Stantord Employees
(USE), the University employees' un
ion.
Whereupon, Dupen informed
members of the women's association
that they could no longer attend
meetings because they were clas
sified as "supervisors."
"I told them that President
(Richard) Lyman might be concerned
if we got sued, but some of them
don't give a damn about the law (the
NLR Act)," Dupen said. "They just
support the union anyway."
The romplaint now under investi
gation is the second tiled since Au
gust. The first case was dismissed by
the NIRB.
