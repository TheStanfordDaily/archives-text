# Disillusion dissipates Big Game enthusiasm
## 
### 
The competitive spirit of Big
Came weekend hit the campus
last night as Ram's Head put on its
first performance of Big Came
Gaieties and the incomparable
Band rallied students at Lake
Lagunita.
But until last night, things were
dead on campus, many students
agreed.
"There seems to be a general
apathy about the game this year,"
one student commented. "It's
hard to follow a football team
that's so inconsistent and makes
so many stupid mistakes."
The fact that Stanford is out ot
the picture for a bowl game has
diminished student enthusiasm
for tomorrow's Stanford-Cal
game, others agreed.
"If the team wins or loses, it
doesn't matter," one student
said. "The game isn't the deter
mining factor for whether or not
we go to a bowl."
But another student, senior
David Hoagland, had different
feelings about the apathy that
pervaded the campus until last
night.
"Stanford always beats Cal.
That's why we're not hyped up for

it anymore," he explained.'
The Bookstore has done its part
to rally students behind the game.
Red buttons hosting "Beat Cal" in
white letters are selling for 50
cents each, and mugs adorned
with the scores of every Big Game
since 1898 are going tor $9.
"We had about 1500 mugs
printed up, and there are about
600 to 700 left," said one
Bookstore worker. "We'll be sel
ling them after the game as well."
Activities heighten today when
the Interfrafernity Council spon
sors its annual
meaganooner on Mayfield
Ave., complete with a live
band and 40 kegs ot beer.
An all-campus rally is slated tor
7:15 tonight on the stepsof Meyer
Library, a warm-up for the Band's
San Francisco "tour" at 10 p.m.
The march through the citv starts
at the corner of Sacramento and
Taylor and winds through San
Francisco to Victorian Park at
Fisherman's wharl where the
Band will perform an hour-long
concert.
Oh, yes. And then there's the
Big Came tomorrow, at 1 p.m. in
the Stadium. t
