Richard Cassilas, district

had been held because he was
thought to be a "security risk."
In El Paso, Texas, border
agents slopped three Iranian
students trying to return to El

will decide it the students are
still attending schools where
they originally registered and if

they are complying with all
rules in their entry permits.
Meanwhile, an American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
official said Wednesday that
the move to deport some Ira
nians has "the makings ol a
witch hunt."
Leonard Rubinstein, a di
rector of the ACLU's Worces
ter, Mass., branch, called de
portation "a way to pressure
people and stifle dissent."
While the government can
legally deport students with
visa violations, Rubinstein said
the action is discriminatory if
only certain foreign students
are singled out.
In Oklahoma City, some Ira
nians who don't want to return
home are reportedly going un
derground. One 24-year-old
Iranian, identified only as
Shoreh, said: "We are political
prisoners because your gov

It is like the Japanese in World
War 11. They were rounded up
and we are being rounded up
too. We are afraid to go out in
Oklahoma City, and we are af
raid to eo back to our country."
