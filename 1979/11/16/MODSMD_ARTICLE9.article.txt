# U.N. vote censures Vietnam
## 
### 
United Nations (AP) â€” In a
vote seen as a censure ol Viet
nam, the (ieneral Assembly
gave overwhelming approval
Wednesday to a resolution cal
ling lor the "immediate with
drawal ol all foreign forces,"
Irom Cambodia.
The vote was 91-21 with 11
nations abstaining.
Vietnam sen! thousands ol
soldiers into neighboring
Cambodia last December in
support ol Cambodian rebels
led by Heng Samrin, and their

combined forces defeated the
government ol Premier Pol Pot
in January.
Heng Samrin then estab
lished his government in the
capital of Phnom Penh, but Pol
Pot's torces reverted fo guer
rilla warfare and the continued
lighting has ravaged Cam
bodia.
ASEAN victory
The assembly vote was seen
as a strong victory for the As
soc lation of South-East Asian
Nations (ASEANi over Vietnam

and its main backer, the Soviet
Union.
It exceeded the ASEAN
triumph of last September
when the assembly voted 71-35
to keep the Pol Pot delegation
in the United Nations. The
Soviet bloc had sought to have
the Pol Pot group replaced by a
delegation Irom HengSamrin's
government
The thrust of that successful
resolution was that the assem
bly would not recognize the
overthrow ol a government
when it involved foreign inter
vention.
Famine threat
Ihe light over Cambodia,
which has raised the threat of
famine there and sent tens ol
thousands ol Cambodians fle
eing to relugee camps in Thai
land, is within the Communist
camp. I he Soviet Union backs
Vietnam and Heng Samrin,
while China supports Pol Pot.
ASEAN members Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore, In
donesia and the Philippines,
had placed the latest resolu
tion on the agenda and gained
50 countries from various reg
ions as sponsors.
