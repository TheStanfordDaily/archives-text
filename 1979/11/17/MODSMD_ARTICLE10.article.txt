# LSJUMB goes to Hal
## 
### 
Hal Michelson, besides being
the announcer for the Stanford
Hand, is devoted to good times
and riotous living. A graduate
of Harvard Law School, Michel
son served as the "voice of the
LSjUMH" during his under
graduate years on the Farm.
Now that he has returned to the
Hay Area, he can once again be
a "band groupie." He carefully
explained how, why and where
in this exclusive interview with
Pete Finch of Cards Today.
Cards Today: How did you
get your start as the band an
nouncer in the tirst place?
Hal: I was a band groupie in
my freshman and sophomore
years. I was and am completely
non-musical, but I enjoyed the
band's performances, and

when they did all-campus ral
lies I would follow them
around because I enjoyed lis
tening to them. I also had a
number of friends in my dorm
and in my fraternity who were
active in the band, and they
came back and told me stories
about the great times they
were having. Well, I wanted to
do something like that myselt it
I had the chance.
The regular announcer, Don
Piatt, who made the "Incom
parable" linejamous, was cal
led off for military training; he
was drafted on rather short
notice. About a week before
school started in 1969, I got a
telephone call from Charlie
Carrera, who was the manager
of the band at that time, and he
said, "Hey, we need somebody

to till in tor a week or two until
we get a regular announcer.
And I don't know you Charlie
said, "but you have a couple of
friends in the band who say
you're loquacious, verbose,
obnoxious, devoted to Stan
ford, dedicated to good times
and have a perverse sense of
humor. At least one or two of
those things would be useful in
being a band announcer, so
why don't you show up and see
how it goes?"
It more or less began that
way and has gone on for ten
years oil and on since then.
I'm somewhat embarrassed
to say that I was on the ASSU
Council of Presidents when I
was a senior. Ten years later,
nobody remembers that I was
on the Council of Presidents,
and everybody remembers
that I was band announcer.
And I think that kind ot reflects
a healthy sense of proportion
about the ASSU if nothing else.
I went to law school in Bos
