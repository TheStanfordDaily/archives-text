# LSJUMB goes to Hal
## 
### 
Hal Michelson, besides being
the announcer for the Stanford
Hand, is devoted to good times
and riotous living. A graduate
of Harvard Law School, Michel
son served as the "voice of the
LSjUMH" during his under
graduate years on the Farm.
Now that he has returned to the
Hay Area, he can once again be
a "band groupie." He carefully
explained how, why and where
in this exclusive interview with
Pete Finch of Cards Today.
Cards Today: How did you
get your start as the band an
nouncer in the tirst place?
Hal: I was a band groupie in
my freshman and sophomore
years. I was and am completely
non-musical, but I enjoyed the
band's performances, and

when they did all-campus ral
lies I would follow them
around because I enjoyed lis
tening to them. I also had a
number of friends in my dorm
and in my fraternity who were
active in the band, and they
came back and told me stories
about the great times they
were having. Well, I wanted to
do something like that myselt it
I had the chance.
The regular announcer, Don
Piatt, who made the "Incom
parable" linejamous, was cal
led off for military training; he
was drafted on rather short
notice. About a week before
school started in 1969, I got a
telephone call from Charlie
Carrera, who was the manager
of the band at that time, and he
said, "Hey, we need somebody

to till in tor a week or two until
we get a regular announcer.
And I don't know you Charlie
said, "but you have a couple of
friends in the band who say
you're loquacious, verbose,
obnoxious, devoted to Stan
ford, dedicated to good times
and have a perverse sense of
humor. At least one or two of
those things would be useful in
being a band announcer, so
why don't you show up and see
how it goes?"
It more or less began that
way and has gone on for ten
years oil and on since then.
I'm somewhat embarrassed
to say that I was on the ASSU
Council of Presidents when I
was a senior. Ten years later,
nobody remembers that I was
on the Council of Presidents,
and everybody remembers
that I was band announcer.
And I think that kind ot reflects
a healthy sense of proportion
about the ASSU if nothing else.
I went to law school in Bos
ton for three years and discon
tinued my work as band an
nouncer then. When I came
back to San Francisco in the
first couple of years that I was
practicing law in the city, I did a
couple of last-minute, fill-in
guest shots, and now I've been
doing it for two or three years
on a full-time basis.
Cards Today: Do you have a
"most-memorable moment"
with the band?
Hal: I got a great deal of
favorable comments two or
three years ago when we had a
high-school band day and I
read off a list of 15 or 20 various
phony names of high schools
after the real ones. I didn't
think much about it at the time,
and it was done without much
planning or creative thought,
but perhaps because of the
dullness of the high-school
band performances, it stuck in
people's minds.
Cards Today: Do you re
member some of the names
you read?
Hal: No, and I destroy my
scripts as rapidly after the
Saturday show as I can; just as
soon as I feel certain there
won't be any major libel and
slander litigation, I destroy the
evidence.
Cards Today: Do you have
any favorite shows the band
has done?
Hal: The death of Mao Tse-
Tung, which was initially per
formed back at Penn State, was
put together about 24 hours
before the game because the
lead time on the news was
short. It was a conceptually
fantastic show. It started out
with the warped idea that the
band would say and do every
thing funny that could possibly
be said or done about the
death of Mao Tse-Tung. Of
course, we got a lot of hate mail
because half of our audience
perceived it as some sort of tri
bute to Mao Tse-Tung, and
didn't like that. The other half
came a little closer to the mark
and said you're really making

fun of someone's death, and
that isn't particularly tunny.
But since Mao Tse-Tung wasn't
likely to have any relatives in
the audience, we weren't too
concerned about that angle.
Down in Los Angeles last
year we did a tribute to office
supplies. I thought that was a
terrifically funny idea. About
two-thirds of the band thought
it was the worst show we had
ever done. I guess it defines
the depths of obscurity to
which the band can sink. It ap
peals to me for that reason.
Cards Today: Have you ever
received any hate mail?
Hal: Well, none has been di
rected specifically to me be
cause most people haven't fi
gured out who I am or what my
address is.
A great deal of the hate mail
is based on misinterpretation
of whatthe band is tryingtodo.
And I suppose as long as the
band is trying to be funny,
sometimes its sense of humor
won't coincide with that of at
least some members of its au
dience. So inevitably, people
will write in and say, "I was of
fended and I wouldn't have
been offended if you had been
wearing high hats and gold
braids and playing Sousa
marches." Well, if the alterna
tive is to wear high hats and
play Sousa marches, the band
is going to take the risk of
being zany, irreverent and oc
casionally controversial.
Cards Today: What do you
see in the future for the band?
Hal: It's impossible to pre
dict. We've got a real problem
in that we've been doing
largely the same thing for the
last 15 years. The format of the
half-time shows certainly has
not changed over 15 years. I
think that at a place as creative
and dynamic as Stanford is,
some student is going to come
along with an entirely new idea
and transform the band. If I
knew what that idea was I
would suggest it, but I guess
I've been around it for so long
that although ! perceive the
need for a change, I'm not

creative enough to be the per
son to suggest it.
There are some terrifically
creative people in the band this
year, and I think this year's
pre-game and half-time shows
have reflected a higher level of
creativity than we've had
perhaps in the year or two be
fore.
Cards Today: Have you ever
felt any direct alumni pressure
to change the band to suit their
liking?
The band has been under a
lot of pressure from all sides on
the Indian mascot issue, and
I've felt a lot of that pressure as
well. It's a sad situation be
cause the movement rep
resented by the T-shirt people
is going nowhere. It's only
creating a lot of division bet
ween people that ought to be
working together, and mistrust
between people that need to
get along better. It was inevita
blethat whatever the band did,
as neutral as the band tried to
be about the issue, there are
people on both sides who felt
that the band was selling out to
the wrong side. That really has
been the thing in all of my ex
perience which caused the
most controversy.
The last thing that was really
that controversial was when
the band went coed. I thinkthe
controversy took place in the

fall of '71 and the first women
were in the band in the fall of
'72. It was a matter of external
pressure that made the band
go coed. At the time that was
quite a revolution.
You know, the active alumni,
who have been visible in sup
port for Stanford in ways like
raising money, continue to be
fans of the band. The people
who write the hate mail, in
common incidentally with the
T-shirt folks, are not, by and
large, the same alumni who
have been visible and active
and doing positive things for
Stanford. If somebody whose
opinion I really respect be
cause of the amount of work
he's put in has a comment or
suggestion, that means a lot
more to me than somebody
who isn't really part of the team
anyway.
Cards Today: How important
do you think the mascot issue
really is?
Hal: Well, I'm sure we need a
solution to the mascot con
troversy, and I hope the stu
dents can come up with one.
The band put forward the trees
by sponsoring a tree festival at
half-time three or four years
ago, and there are many
people in the band who think
that the tree is the best of both
worlds. On the one hand, it'sa
refreshingly bizarre and origi
nal choice — what other school
has a vegetable as a mascot? —
and it therefore satisfies the

segment of the student popu
lation that looks for something
that is off-the-wall, distinctive,
individualistic. On the other
hand, the tree relates to a lot of
traditional things about Stan
ford, which I would think
would be appealing to alumni.
We have that Palo Alto tree,
that sequoia redwood right on
the seal, and I think it would be
something that alumni could
get behind.
The griffin is a fine choice as
a warlike, macho, dignified
symbol, and if Stanford were
the University of California at
Orange County, some new
school starting out without
tradition, it could use the grif
fin. The griffin would be fine if
we were starting from scratch,
but since it has nothing to do
with Stanford, I, for one, find it
hard to see as appropriate.
Important idea: Most of the
band member alumni from my
vintage wish in their heart of
hearts that Stanford could be
the Indians again. Most of
them are mature enough to
realize that this simply isn't
going to happen, so that the
present "Bring Back the In
dian" movement is simply a
very sad, divisive, futile exer
cise, which unfortunately is
not doing justice to Timm Wil
liams, who is a good person.
And it is not a positive thing for
Stanford because it's driving
people apart rather than pul
ling them together.
