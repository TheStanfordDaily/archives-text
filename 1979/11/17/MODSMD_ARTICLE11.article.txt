### 
The dirty Golden Bear
Is losing all his hair,
His teeth are out
He's got the gout
He don't know what it's all about
His eyes are made of glass;
He's losing all his class,
So take your dirty Golden Bear
And shove him up your ass.
The dirty Golden Bear
Has dirty p—- hair.
His d— is dead,
It's got no head,
He cannot get it up in bed:
He goes to use his hand
But cannot find his gland
So you can see him e off
The U.C. Berkeley Band.
The dirty Golden Bear

And shove him up your ass.
