# Anderson's last game
## Cal QB ends it all 
### Steve Mitchel 
Hollywood has used this
script over and over again. It's
final game of the season, the
big game against the arch
rivals. It's also the star quarter
hack s last game tor his school.
You know the rest — The quar
terback has his best day ever
and ends his career in a blaze
of glory.
Unfortunately, the odds are
that Fric Anderson will not get a
chance to end his career with
such grandeur. Anderson is
not the star quarterback, he is
Cal's second-stringer.
"It's a lot harder and a lot
more frustrating being the
second-stringer," admitted
Anderson. "You have to stay
intense, and really pay atten
tion, because you never know

when you II he asked to go in."
Anderson has not always
heen "just" a number two
quarterback. Back in his senior
year at San Marino High
School, he won All-CIF and
All-San Gabriel Valley honors,
as well as being named the Rio
Hondo League "Player of the
Year." He also earned letters in
basketball, volleyball, and
swimming. Besides Cal, An
derson was recruited by BYU,
Army, Navy and Stanford.
"I thought that Stanford was
basically a one-year school for
quarterbacks," explains An
derson, "and I really liked the
coaching staff at Cal."
So it was oft to Berkeley for
Anderson, where he enjoyed
an outstanding freshman sea
