# Anderson's last game
## Cal QB ends it all 
### Steve Mitchel 
Hollywood has used this
script over and over again. It's
final game of the season, the
big game against the arch
rivals. It's also the star quarter
hack s last game tor his school.
You know the rest — The quar
terback has his best day ever
and ends his career in a blaze
of glory.
Unfortunately, the odds are
that Fric Anderson will not get a
chance to end his career with
such grandeur. Anderson is
not the star quarterback, he is
Cal's second-stringer.
"It's a lot harder and a lot
more frustrating being the
second-stringer," admitted
Anderson. "You have to stay
intense, and really pay atten
tion, because you never know

when you II he asked to go in."
Anderson has not always
heen "just" a number two
quarterback. Back in his senior
year at San Marino High
School, he won All-CIF and
All-San Gabriel Valley honors,
as well as being named the Rio
Hondo League "Player of the
Year." He also earned letters in
basketball, volleyball, and
swimming. Besides Cal, An
derson was recruited by BYU,
Army, Navy and Stanford.
"I thought that Stanford was
basically a one-year school for
quarterbacks," explains An
derson, "and I really liked the
coaching staff at Cal."
So it was oft to Berkeley for
Anderson, where he enjoyed
an outstanding freshman sea

son. In four of the five JV
games in 1975, Anderson pas
sed for more than 300 yards,
breaking all of Steve
Bartkowski's freshman passing
records. His best day came in
the "Little Big Game" when he
passed lor 458 yards, complet
ing 30 out of 59 passes, six for
touchdowns.
But that's where the glory
ended for Eric Anderson. He
was redshirted in 1976, and he
has been used sparingly in the
past two years. "After I was
redshirted, I thought I'd get
three years as the starting quar
terback. It just didn't work out
that way."
It is working out that way for
Rich Campbell, though. Last
year, as a sophomore, Campbell
enjoyed the second best pas
sing season ever in Cal history.
He racked up 2287 yards and
tied the school record to for ID
passes with 14. He also threw
for over 200 yards in each of t he
last four games of the season.
So it appears that Campbell will
be the one to get the three

years as the starting quarter
back, not Anderson. But there
is no animosity between the
two quarterbacks.
"Last year," admits An
derson, "it was a little tough.
There was a lot of instability,
especially with the change in
quarterback coaches. But this
year we've become really good
friends. Rich is having a super
season, and he's improved
tremendously over last year.
He has really come into his
own, and this is a great oppor
tunity for him."
So Anderson has had to ad
just to being the number-two
man. But while he sees only li
mited action, he has taught
himself to stay prepared at all
times. He may be thrown into
the action at any moment.
Obviously Anderson would
rather be out playing n the field
than watching from the
sidelines. But he has learned to
use his unique vantage point to
his advantage.
"In one respect, I have an
advantage over Rich. I'm able
to stand with the coaching staff

and listen to them call certain
plays in certain situations.
Alter a while, I get to know
what plays that they want used,
according to the flow of the
game. So there are some posi
tive aspects to it,"he said.
Besides listening to the
coaches, Anderson must also
pay close attention to the way
that the game is developing.
"You have to pay attention to
the coverages and any tenden
cies that the other team might
have, or you won't be able to
ract to the tempo. I really play
every play right along with
Rich, but I'm still a spectator."
He has adjusted very well to
his role as the number-two

quarterback, and he has no re
grets about coming to Cal. "I
came to the right school,
there's no question about
that," Anderson said. "This is
the place for me. There are
other things besides football. I
teel comfortable here. I've
been here tor five years, and
I'm going to graduate school
here.
"I did think about leaving a
couple of years ago. But in the
end, it was Cal or no place. I'm
really glad that I stayed. I didn't
come up here as a Golden Bear
fan, but I am one now."
)ust the same, Anderson cer
tainly wouldn't mind some
playing time in his final game

for Cal.
"It's my last game, and the
coach told me that he's really
going to try to get me in. Rut
you never know. I was origi
nally supposed to go in against
USC and against Washington.
But both of those turned out to
be really tight games. So the
coach decided not to disrupt
the tempo, so I didn't get in. So
against Stanford, if it's tight, I
just might get overlooked. If I
do get in though, I know that
Rich will be rooting for me."
And who knows? He
might just play a role in a diffe
rent Hollywood script, where
the hero comes in off the
bench to win the "Big Game."
Hollywood has used this
script over and over again. It's
final game of the season, the
big game against the arch

son. In four of the five JV
games in 1975, Anderson pas
sed for more than 300 yards,
breaking all of Steve
Bartkowski's freshman passing
records. His best day came in
the "Little Big Game" when he
passed lor 458 yards, complet
ing 30 out of 59 passes, six for
touchdowns.
But that's where the glory
ended for Eric Anderson. He
was redshirted in 1976, and he
has been used sparingly in the
past two years. "After I was
redshirted, I thought I'd get
three years as the starting quar
terback. It just didn't work out
that way."
It is working out that way for
Rich Campbell, though. Last
year, as a sophomore, Campbell
enjoyed the second best pas
sing season ever in Cal history.
He racked up 2287 yards and
tied the school record to for ID
passes with 14. He also threw
for over 200 yards in each of t he
last four games of the season.
So it appears that Campbell will
be the one to get the three

years as the starting quarter
back, not Anderson. But there
is no animosity between the
two quarterbacks.
"Last year," admits An
derson, "it was a little tough.
There was a lot of instability,
especially with the change in
quarterback coaches. But this
year we've become really good
friends. Rich is having a super
season, and he's improved
tremendously over last year.
He has really come into his
own, and this is a great oppor
tunity for him."
So Anderson has had to ad
just to being the number-two
man. But while he sees only li
mited action, he has taught
himself to stay prepared at all
times. He may be thrown into
the action at any moment.
Obviously Anderson would
rather be out playing n the field
than watching from the
sidelines. But he has learned to
use his unique vantage point to
his advantage.
"In one respect, I have an
advantage over Rich. I'm able
to stand with the coaching staff

and listen to them call certain
plays in certain situations.
Alter a while, I get to know
what plays that they want used,
according to the flow of the
game. So there are some posi
tive aspects to it,"he said.
Besides listening to the
coaches, Anderson must also
pay close attention to the way
that the game is developing.
"You have to pay attention to
the coverages and any tenden
cies that the other team might
have, or you won't be able to
ract to the tempo. I really play
every play right along with
Rich, but I'm still a spectator."
He has adjusted very well to
his role as the number-two

quarterback, and he has no re
grets about coming to Cal. "I
came to the right school,
there's no question about
that," Anderson said. "This is
the place for me. There are
other things besides football. I
teel comfortable here. I've
been here tor five years, and
I'm going to graduate school
here.
"I did think about leaving a
couple of years ago. But in the
end, it was Cal or no place. I'm
really glad that I stayed. I didn't
come up here as a Golden Bear
fan, but I am one now."
)ust the same, Anderson cer
tainly wouldn't mind some
playing time in his final game

for Cal.
"It's my last game, and the
coach told me that he's really
going to try to get me in. Rut
you never know. I was origi
nally supposed to go in against
USC and against Washington.
But both of those turned out to
be really tight games. So the
coach decided not to disrupt
the tempo, so I didn't get in. So
against Stanford, if it's tight, I
just might get overlooked. If I
do get in though, I know that
Rich will be rooting for me."
And who knows? He
might just play a role in a diffe
rent Hollywood script, where
the hero comes in off the
bench to win the "Big Game."
Hollywood has used this
script over and over again. It's
final game of the season, the
big game against the arch
rivals. It's also the star quarter
hack s last game tor his school.
You know the rest — The quar
terback has his best day ever
and ends his career in a blaze
of glory.
Unfortunately, the odds are
that Fric Anderson will not get a
chance to end his career with
such grandeur. Anderson is
not the star quarterback, he is
Cal's second-stringer.
"It's a lot harder and a lot
more frustrating being the
second-stringer," admitted
Anderson. "You have to stay
intense, and really pay atten
tion, because you never know

when you II he asked to go in."
Anderson has not always
heen "just" a number two
quarterback. Back in his senior
year at San Marino High
School, he won All-CIF and
All-San Gabriel Valley honors,
as well as being named the Rio
Hondo League "Player of the
Year." He also earned letters in
basketball, volleyball, and
swimming. Besides Cal, An
derson was recruited by BYU,
Army, Navy and Stanford.
"I thought that Stanford was
basically a one-year school for
quarterbacks," explains An
derson, "and I really liked the
coaching staff at Cal."
So it was oft to Berkeley for
Anderson, where he enjoyed
an outstanding freshman sea
