# Cards must credit Banks

A ma|or college football
coach once said of his special
teams, It they bleu k one kit k,
they're lucky; if they block
two, they're doing the job; and
it they block three, they're
damn good."
This line may not necessarily
be true, but one thing is tor
certain • — with three key
blocked kicks this season,
Stantord flanker and special
teams standout Gordon Banks
is not lucky.
In tact, if one were to look
back at his four-year career at
Stanford, one might think that
the opposite were true. Heav
ily recruited for football and
track, Banks was forced to play
second fiddle to Darrin Nelson
early m his career and to Ken
Margerum this year.
"In my sophomore season,"
Banks explained, "we (Banks
and Nelson) were both work
mg really hard for the starting

spot. In about the third week ot
the season I got hurt and he
stepped in and just started
doing phenomenal things. I
wasn't dejected that I wasn't
starting. I could see maybe
what I would have been it he
was just playing so-so, but lie
was doing some great things."
Atter his sophomore season,
Banks was moved to flanker, a
change that initially did not last
long.
"My junior year I started at
flanker, but then a lot of the
running backs got hurt, so it
was in the best interest of the
team that I move back into the
bac ktield. It was really a disap
pointing season playing both
positions. It was a bad situation
for me."
Now Banks has found a per
manent home at flanker but
again must watch an ultra
talented player, Ken

Margerum, get most ot the ac
tion.
"It's really a contrast ot two
different things," Banks noted.
"In my sophomore and junior
years I played a lot more than I
do now, even though I am
much more talented now and
really have the talent to be in
the ball game. Before the Ore
gon game, I was looking at the
press guide and comparing it
to one from the same time my
sophomore year. I had seven
catches at that time even though
I was maybe one-fifth the caliber
player that I am now. This year I
had only six. It's been kind of a
disappointment not getting the
opportunity to play regularly."
Even though he has not seen
much offensive action, Banks
continues to be the mainstay of
the special teams, and Coach
Rod Dowhower's trump card in
crucial situations. His three
blocked kicks this season have
