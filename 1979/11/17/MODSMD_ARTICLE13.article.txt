# Cards must credit Banks

A ma|or college football
coach once said of his special
teams, It they bleu k one kit k,
they're lucky; if they block
two, they're doing the job; and
it they block three, they're
damn good."
This line may not necessarily
be true, but one thing is tor
certain • — with three key
blocked kicks this season,
Stantord flanker and special
teams standout Gordon Banks
is not lucky.
In tact, if one were to look
back at his four-year career at
Stanford, one might think that
the opposite were true. Heav
ily recruited for football and
track, Banks was forced to play
second fiddle to Darrin Nelson
early m his career and to Ken
Margerum this year.
"In my sophomore season,"
Banks explained, "we (Banks
and Nelson) were both work
mg really hard for the starting

spot. In about the third week ot
the season I got hurt and he
stepped in and just started
doing phenomenal things. I
wasn't dejected that I wasn't
starting. I could see maybe
what I would have been it he
was just playing so-so, but lie
was doing some great things."
Atter his sophomore season,
Banks was moved to flanker, a
change that initially did not last
long.
"My junior year I started at
flanker, but then a lot of the
running backs got hurt, so it
was in the best interest of the
team that I move back into the
bac ktield. It was really a disap
pointing season playing both
positions. It was a bad situation
for me."
Now Banks has found a per
manent home at flanker but
again must watch an ultra
talented player, Ken

Margerum, get most ot the ac
tion.
"It's really a contrast ot two
different things," Banks noted.
"In my sophomore and junior
years I played a lot more than I
do now, even though I am
much more talented now and
really have the talent to be in
the ball game. Before the Ore
gon game, I was looking at the
press guide and comparing it
to one from the same time my
sophomore year. I had seven
catches at that time even though
I was maybe one-fifth the caliber
player that I am now. This year I
had only six. It's been kind of a
disappointment not getting the
opportunity to play regularly."
Even though he has not seen
much offensive action, Banks
continues to be the mainstay of
the special teams, and Coach
Rod Dowhower's trump card in
crucial situations. His three
blocked kicks this season have

Senior Gordon Banks blocks a crucial kick against UCLA earlier this
year. Banks has seen the field from many different positions in his career
at Stanford, switching from receiver to halfback to flanker to special
teams. r
all had critical impact: he has
produced game-saving field
goal blocks against UCLA and
IJSC, and a momentary
shutout-preserving block of a
short-range field goal attempt
against Boston College.
"We put a lot of work into
our special teams. We work on
them a lot to iron out
techniques. We consider it the
other one-third of the game
and approach it as being as im
portant as the offense or the
defense. Most of all, though,

vou have to have guys who are
really jacked up — guys with a
lot of pride.
"It's always tun to play on the
special teams, especially when
you're not getting an oppor
tunity to play offensively very
much. Special teams are an av
enue for good players to show
what they can do. We've really
put a lot of emphasis on it this
year. The attitude on the spe
cial teams is a bit more relaxed,
but you scout their special
teams to find out what their
tendencies are, just as you
would scout their offense. Like
against Oregon, they had a
super punt returner and we re
ally wanted to stop him. We

have a lot of pride, and we just
wanted to show we could stop
him. I think it you wanted to
sum up the attitude of our spe
cial teams you would have to
say pride and prestige."
Banks realizes that pride
must carry them through be
cause even after his game
saving block against UCLA, his
efforts were overshadowed by
Ken Naber's whalloping 56-
yard field goal to win the game.
"Publicity is not something
that is important in itself, but
the fact that you did it, the fact
that you helped the team, the
fact that your teammates
noticed it, and the fact that you
utilized your talent are all im

portant. It's really a personal
thing. I ike it you make a tackle
on a punt that keeps the guy
from scoring — that's the kind
of thing that goes unnoticed,
but not by your teammates;
that's really what counts."
Banks looks back at his suc
cess on the special teams and
throughout his career and
shrugs, "It's a strange thing —
more than just my success at
blocking kicks, but my ability
to perform the big play. The art
of trying to perform in the
clutch — whether it be catch
ing a crucial third-down pass or
blocking a kick. I just do what
ever it takes to win — that's the
name of the game."
