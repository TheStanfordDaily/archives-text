# Band rams the polls
## 
### E.M. Bo 
The following opening sen
tences were deemed inap
propriate for this article: "The
Cal Band can eat us raw." "But
it really is "Hoover Tower!"
"The United States' ambiguous
foreign policy led to the diver
gent multilateral foreign policy
of Berlin in the early 19405.")
Is it indecisiveness? Or is it
lack ot decisiveness? We're not
sure. Something seems to be
characteristic of this character
less collection of Presidential
candidates.
Are they excessively evasive?
Are they ignoring the needs of
the electorate? Are they per
verting the power ot their posi
tions? Or are they just plain
stupid?
I ibel is a horrible thing, so
we won't answer these ques
tions outright. Instead, the
Stanford Band would like to
otter you at least tour good
reasons tor laughing at your
sample ballot.
Our incumbent, Jimmy Car
ter, is setting the self-sacrifice
example for America: "Waste
not, want not!" We would like
to ask, "Is Jimmy getting any
'Satisfaction' out of playing the
martyr, or is he just 'Uptight'?"
Let's see: Howard Baker.
What can we say about Howard
Baker? What can we say that's
nice about Howard Baker?
Well . . . He's better than
Ronald Reagan. The question

is, can he raise the dough to get
his campaign really cooking!"
Symbolizing youthful
energy, jerry Brown zealously
attacks the campaign trail, flail
ing arms, desperately trying to
spawn like a salmon in the
"Yellow River" of life. What
ever happens in the next year,
at least the campaign will help

keep BROWN OUT of Sac
ramento.
In any event, it doesn't really
matter who wins the election.
II he'sgood, he won't last long.
And it he's bad, he may be the
TARGET of much abuse, but we
still won't be able to get rid of
him. Remember, "Only the
Good Die Young."
