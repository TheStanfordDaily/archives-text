# Nelson sits one out

Picture this: A diminutive 5
toot 9, 175 pound sophomore
halfback wearing the red and
white Stanford colors, takes
the opening handoff from the
quarterback. He's hit from be
hind the line, breaks the tackle
and races 46 yards down the
field on a sweep left. Four plays
later, the same man bursts ac
ross the goal line from one yard
out. The Big Game 1978. Stan

ford 7, Cal Weenies 0.
Sounds pretty good, huh?
Remember it? That was a year
ago. Only a year ago. To some
of us, that year went by pretty
slowly. To Darrin Nelson,
though, that year seemed like
eternity.
Last November 1H th at
Memorial Stadium across the
bay, Darrin Nelson had one
hell of a game. Nelson,
perhaps the most sensational

back ever to wear a Stanford
jersey, carried the ball 17 times
for 177 yards and a TD. He also
caught four passes for 36 yards
and another score.
That was last year. Today,
he's going to be on the
sidelines, in street clothes, a
spectator. Imagine that, Darrin
Nelson watching a Stanford
football game like you and me.
Well, he's been doing it all
year long. He's been watching

This is the way it's been all year for Darrin Nelson, the greatest runner in
Stanford history. After injuring his left leg long-jumping last spring,
Nelson was forced to red-shirt in 1979. A junior, Nelson has two more
years of eligibility, and he says he'll be ready to use them.
