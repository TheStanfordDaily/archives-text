# Nelson sits one out

Picture this: A diminutive 5
toot 9, 175 pound sophomore
halfback wearing the red and
white Stanford colors, takes
the opening handoff from the
quarterback. He's hit from be
hind the line, breaks the tackle
and races 46 yards down the
field on a sweep left. Four plays
later, the same man bursts ac
ross the goal line from one yard
out. The Big Game 1978. Stan

ford 7, Cal Weenies 0.
Sounds pretty good, huh?
Remember it? That was a year
ago. Only a year ago. To some
of us, that year went by pretty
slowly. To Darrin Nelson,
though, that year seemed like
eternity.
Last November 1H th at
Memorial Stadium across the
bay, Darrin Nelson had one
hell of a game. Nelson,
perhaps the most sensational

back ever to wear a Stanford
jersey, carried the ball 17 times
for 177 yards and a TD. He also
caught four passes for 36 yards
and another score.
That was last year. Today,
he's going to be on the
sidelines, in street clothes, a
spectator. Imagine that, Darrin
Nelson watching a Stanford
football game like you and me.
Well, he's been doing it all
year long. He's been watching

This is the way it's been all year for Darrin Nelson, the greatest runner in
Stanford history. After injuring his left leg long-jumping last spring,
Nelson was forced to red-shirt in 1979. A junior, Nelson has two more
years of eligibility, and he says he'll be ready to use them.
instead of playing since that
fateful March afternoon down
in Westwood. That day, after
winning the long jump com
petition at 25-4, Nelson de
cided to top that mark. He
didn't.
Darrin Nelson, track star,
ruptured his hamstring ten
don, casting dark shadows
upon the future of Darrin Nel
son, football star.
"Darrin ripped the ligament
right off the bone as he ex
tended off the board. I've
never seen this injury happen

in the long jump. He just pul
led the tendon apart. He's got
that much strength," said Dr.
Fred Behling, Stanford Univer
sity team physician.
Now maybe you might re
member this. Second period.
Same game. The same Nelson
takes another handotf from
quarterback Dils for another
sweep around end. He goes for
16 yards. It was this 16 yard
jaunt that gave the rabbit-quick
scatback his second 1000 yard
season in a row.
Nelson finished the season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50

pass receptions, only the sec
ond time in the history of col
legiate football that a player
has rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Two
years ago. By who? Who else
but Darrin Nelson.
"At first all I could think was
why me? But I got over that in
the hospital. The cast was what
bothered me the most because
I couldn't do the things I nor
mally do. People always had to
help me move around.
Another thing that got me
down about the whole process
was that it was really boring
don't ever hurt your leg,'' ad
vised Nelson.

Nelson, a resident of L.A.,
went on an extensive rehabili
tation program over the sum
mer to build up that leg; the leg
which once made, to coin a
phrase, stops and starts, cuts
and darts, on a dime. The same
leg which had atrophied quite
a bit after six weeks in a cast.
Nothing but running and lilt
ing. Running and litting.
I hough most doctors gave
Nelson little chance of return
ing this year, Darrin himself
didn't buy it. And he worked
hard, very hard, to prove them
wrong. Which he almost did.
"There was a very good
chance that I was going to
play," said Nelson. "The deci

si on to sit out this year,
though, came from
Dowhower, my family and my
self. But, especially from my
self. I made the decision not to
play. I could have played, I just
didn't want to at less than 100
percent. If I had wanted to
play, I would have played."
And 100 percent is what Dar
rin Nelson is all about.
This fall, Nelson, though not
playing, is getting ready to. Of
tentimes, he'll spend three to
five hours in the training room.
As for the injury, he says he
hasn't seen the doctor in a
month. In fact, said Nelson,
"I've been at 100 percent tor
about four or five weeks now."
Four or five weeks.
"I don't have any doubts
about my knee; I don't have
any doubts about my playing
again. I can do anything I want
and I am going to play," added
Nelson.
In fact, like getting back on a
horse after being thrown, Nel
son is out for track again. Kind
of. Nelson is still doing most of
the same events that he did be
fore with one major exception.
That's right, Nelson, though
running the 100 and 200 yard
dash as well as the 400 yard re
lay, has foregone long jump
ing.
"When people tirst told me
that I had a serious injury, I
thought they were crazy. I
mean, I ran track in order to
avoid injuries. And I still will.
But I don't think I'm going to
take the odds on the long
jumping again," chuckled Nel
son.
Third quarter, 4th and 5 at
the Cal five-and-a-half for the
Cards. With the Stanford root
ing section chanting"Go,Co,"
Dils flips a pass to Nelson on
the left flat. Nelson spins out of
linebacker David Shaw's hold
at the 12, dodges another
tackle, hurdles Stanford line
man Andre Hines at the 6 and
his second touchdown of the
game. The game is over.
After the game in the Cal
dressing room. "He's an unbe
lievable player," said teary
eved Bear coach Roger Theder
in a strained voice. "He's the
finest little back I've ever seen
in my years of coaching. He
broke our back time after time.
I think he made the difference
in today's game."
Today, Darrin Nelson won't
make much of a difference.
How does that make him feel?
"Not too good. The Big
Came is a special game to our
school, you can feel that the
minute you walk onto the field.
And I always like to play against
Cal, it's a big rivalry. And you
know, Cal started to recruit me
but then they told me that I was
too small," noted Nelson.
"But sitting out the game
won't be as hard as it was ear
lier in the season. I've sat
through most of the season.
One more game won't make a
big difference. At the begin
ning of the year, I just had to
accept the fact that I wasn't
going to be in there. But just

bay, Darrin Nelson had one
hell of a game. Nelson,
perhaps the most sensational

back ever to wear a Stanford
jersey, carried the ball 17 times
for 177 yards and a TD. He also
caught four passes for 36 yards
and another score.
That was last year. Today,
he's going to be on the
sidelines, in street clothes, a
spectator. Imagine that, Darrin
Nelson watching a Stanford
football game like you and me.
Well, he's been doing it all
year long. He's been watching

This is the way it's been all year for Darrin Nelson, the greatest runner in
Stanford history. After injuring his left leg long-jumping last spring,
Nelson was forced to red-shirt in 1979. A junior, Nelson has two more
years of eligibility, and he says he'll be ready to use them.
instead of playing since that
fateful March afternoon down
in Westwood. That day, after
winning the long jump com
petition at 25-4, Nelson de
cided to top that mark. He
didn't.
Darrin Nelson, track star,
ruptured his hamstring ten
don, casting dark shadows
upon the future of Darrin Nel
son, football star.
"Darrin ripped the ligament
right off the bone as he ex
tended off the board. I've
never seen this injury happen

in the long jump. He just pul
led the tendon apart. He's got
that much strength," said Dr.
Fred Behling, Stanford Univer
sity team physician.
Now maybe you might re
member this. Second period.
Same game. The same Nelson
takes another handotf from
quarterback Dils for another
sweep around end. He goes for
16 yards. It was this 16 yard
jaunt that gave the rabbit-quick
scatback his second 1000 yard
season in a row.
Nelson finished the season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50

pass receptions, only the sec
ond time in the history of col
legiate football that a player
has rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Two
years ago. By who? Who else
but Darrin Nelson.
"At first all I could think was
why me? But I got over that in
the hospital. The cast was what
bothered me the most because
I couldn't do the things I nor
mally do. People always had to
help me move around.
Another thing that got me
down about the whole process
was that it was really boring
don't ever hurt your leg,'' ad
vised Nelson.

Nelson, a resident of L.A.,
went on an extensive rehabili
tation program over the sum
mer to build up that leg; the leg
which once made, to coin a
phrase, stops and starts, cuts
and darts, on a dime. The same
leg which had atrophied quite
a bit after six weeks in a cast.
Nothing but running and lilt
ing. Running and litting.
I hough most doctors gave
Nelson little chance of return
ing this year, Darrin himself
didn't buy it. And he worked
hard, very hard, to prove them
wrong. Which he almost did.
"There was a very good
chance that I was going to
play," said Nelson. "The deci

si on to sit out this year,
though, came from
Dowhower, my family and my
self. But, especially from my
self. I made the decision not to
play. I could have played, I just
didn't want to at less than 100
percent. If I had wanted to
play, I would have played."
And 100 percent is what Dar
rin Nelson is all about.
This fall, Nelson, though not
playing, is getting ready to. Of
tentimes, he'll spend three to
five hours in the training room.
As for the injury, he says he
hasn't seen the doctor in a
month. In fact, said Nelson,
"I've been at 100 percent tor
about four or five weeks now."
Four or five weeks.
"I don't have any doubts
about my knee; I don't have
any doubts about my playing
again. I can do anything I want
and I am going to play," added
Nelson.
In fact, like getting back on a
horse after being thrown, Nel
son is out for track again. Kind
of. Nelson is still doing most of
the same events that he did be
fore with one major exception.
That's right, Nelson, though
running the 100 and 200 yard
dash as well as the 400 yard re
lay, has foregone long jump
ing.
"When people tirst told me
that I had a serious injury, I
thought they were crazy. I
mean, I ran track in order to
avoid injuries. And I still will.
But I don't think I'm going to
take the odds on the long
jumping again," chuckled Nel
son.
Third quarter, 4th and 5 at
the Cal five-and-a-half for the
Cards. With the Stanford root
ing section chanting"Go,Co,"
Dils flips a pass to Nelson on
the left flat. Nelson spins out of
linebacker David Shaw's hold
at the 12, dodges another
tackle, hurdles Stanford line
man Andre Hines at the 6 and
his second touchdown of the
game. The game is over.
After the game in the Cal
dressing room. "He's an unbe
lievable player," said teary
eved Bear coach Roger Theder
in a strained voice. "He's the
finest little back I've ever seen
in my years of coaching. He
broke our back time after time.
I think he made the difference
in today's game."
Today, Darrin Nelson won't
make much of a difference.
How does that make him feel?
"Not too good. The Big
Came is a special game to our
school, you can feel that the
minute you walk onto the field.
And I always like to play against
Cal, it's a big rivalry. And you
know, Cal started to recruit me
but then they told me that I was
too small," noted Nelson.
"But sitting out the game
won't be as hard as it was ear
lier in the season. I've sat
through most of the season.
One more game won't make a
big difference. At the begin
ning of the year, I just had to
accept the fact that I wasn't
going to be in there. But just
the same. . .
lust the same, he's running
track now and the next thing
you know he'll be wearing the
red and white football jersey
again. After all, it's only a year
awav.
Picture this: A diminutive 5
toot 9, 175 pound sophomore
halfback wearing the red and
white Stanford colors, takes
the opening handoff from the
quarterback. He's hit from be
hind the line, breaks the tackle
and races 46 yards down the
field on a sweep left. Four plays
later, the same man bursts ac
ross the goal line from one yard
out. The Big Game 1978. Stan

ford 7, Cal Weenies 0.
Sounds pretty good, huh?
Remember it? That was a year

Nelson was forced to red-shirt in 1979. A junior, Nelson has two more
years of eligibility, and he says he'll be ready to use them.
instead of playing since that
fateful March afternoon down
in Westwood. That day, after
winning the long jump com
petition at 25-4, Nelson de
cided to top that mark. He
didn't.
Darrin Nelson, track star,
ruptured his hamstring ten
don, casting dark shadows
upon the future of Darrin Nel
son, football star.
"Darrin ripped the ligament
right off the bone as he ex
tended off the board. I've
never seen this injury happen

in the long jump. He just pul
led the tendon apart. He's got
that much strength," said Dr.
Fred Behling, Stanford Univer
sity team physician.
Now maybe you might re
member this. Second period.
Same game. The same Nelson
takes another handotf from
quarterback Dils for another
sweep around end. He goes for
16 yards. It was this 16 yard
jaunt that gave the rabbit-quick
scatback his second 1000 yard
season in a row.
Nelson finished the season
with 1061 yards rushing and 50

pass receptions, only the sec
ond time in the history of col
legiate football that a player
has rushed for 1000 yards and
caught 50 passes in the same
season. The first time? Two
years ago. By who? Who else
but Darrin Nelson.
"At first all I could think was
why me? But I got over that in
the hospital. The cast was what
bothered me the most because
I couldn't do the things I nor
mally do. People always had to
help me move around.
Another thing that got me
down about the whole process
was that it was really boring
don't ever hurt your leg,'' ad
vised Nelson.

Nelson, a resident of L.A.,
went on an extensive rehabili
tation program over the sum
mer to build up that leg; the leg
which once made, to coin a
phrase, stops and starts, cuts
and darts, on a dime. The same
leg which had atrophied quite
a bit after six weeks in a cast.
Nothing but running and lilt
ing. Running and litting.
I hough most doctors gave
Nelson little chance of return
ing this year, Darrin himself
didn't buy it. And he worked
hard, very hard, to prove them
wrong. Which he almost did.
"There was a very good
chance that I was going to
play," said Nelson. "The deci

si on to sit out this year,
though, came from
Dowhower, my family and my
self. But, especially from my
self. I made the decision not to
play. I could have played, I just
didn't want to at less than 100
percent. If I had wanted to
play, I would have played."
And 100 percent is what Dar
rin Nelson is all about.
This fall, Nelson, though not
playing, is getting ready to. Of
tentimes, he'll spend three to
five hours in the training room.
As for the injury, he says he
hasn't seen the doctor in a
month. In fact, said Nelson,
"I've been at 100 percent tor
about four or five weeks now."
Four or five weeks.
"I don't have any doubts
about my knee; I don't have
any doubts about my playing
again. I can do anything I want
and I am going to play," added
Nelson.
In fact, like getting back on a
horse after being thrown, Nel
son is out for track again. Kind
of. Nelson is still doing most of
the same events that he did be
fore with one major exception.
That's right, Nelson, though
running the 100 and 200 yard
dash as well as the 400 yard re
lay, has foregone long jump
ing.
"When people tirst told me
that I had a serious injury, I
thought they were crazy. I
mean, I ran track in order to
avoid injuries. And I still will.
But I don't think I'm going to
take the odds on the long
jumping again," chuckled Nel
son.
Third quarter, 4th and 5 at
the Cal five-and-a-half for the
Cards. With the Stanford root
ing section chanting"Go,Co,"
Dils flips a pass to Nelson on
the left flat. Nelson spins out of
linebacker David Shaw's hold
at the 12, dodges another
tackle, hurdles Stanford line
man Andre Hines at the 6 and
his second touchdown of the
game. The game is over.
After the game in the Cal
dressing room. "He's an unbe
lievable player," said teary
eved Bear coach Roger Theder
in a strained voice. "He's the
finest little back I've ever seen
in my years of coaching. He
broke our back time after time.
I think he made the difference
in today's game."
Today, Darrin Nelson won't
make much of a difference.
How does that make him feel?
"Not too good. The Big
Came is a special game to our
school, you can feel that the
minute you walk onto the field.
And I always like to play against
Cal, it's a big rivalry. And you
know, Cal started to recruit me
but then they told me that I was
too small," noted Nelson.
"But sitting out the game
won't be as hard as it was ear
lier in the season. I've sat
through most of the season.
One more game won't make a
big difference. At the begin
ning of the year, I just had to
accept the fact that I wasn't
going to be in there. But just
the same. . .
lust the same, he's running
track now and the next thing
you know he'll be wearing the
red and white football jersey
again. After all, it's only a year
awav.
