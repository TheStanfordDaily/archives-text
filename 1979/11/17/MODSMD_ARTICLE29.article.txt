# 82 years of the Big Game
## 
### 
For nearly a century now, the
Big Game rivalry between Stan
ford and California has
exemplified the tradition, ex
citement, spirit and competi
tion of college football at its
best.
Of the79 games in the series,
36 have been decided by seven
points or less. There have been
no less than 10 ties. The series
started 85 years ago, on March
19,1892. Stanford won that first
game 14-10, despite the fact
that a student manager named
Herbert Hoover forgot to bring
the football.
The Stanford Axe is symbolic
ottheStantord-Cal rivalry. First
displayed at an 1899 baseball
game between the two

schools, it has been stolen
eight times. The first theft oc
curred at that 1899 game, after
Stanford yell leader Billy F.rb
had employed the Axe
throughout the game to be
head a dummy bear and chop
up blue and gold ribbons. After
the game a group of Cal men
jumped the guardians of the
Axe (including former U.S.
Senator Carl Hayden ot
Arizona) and took it away. To
help sneak it across the Bay on
a ferryboat, the Cal group
sawed off the handle.
In 1930, Stanford got even,

when the "Immortal 21" pulled
off a well-planned robbery.
Posing as newspaper photo
graphers, they arranged to take
a picture of the Axe as it was
returned to the American Trust
Company in Berkeley after a
pep rally. In front of the bank,
they exploded tear gas and
smoke bombs as the camera
clicked, and succeeded in
wrestling the Axe from the Cal
custodian in the ensuing melee.
Three years later, the Stan
ford administration agreed
with Cal's to make the Axe a

trophy for the winner of the
annual Big Came.
The thievery didn't end
there, however. The most re
cent heist was in 1973, pulled
off by Stanford's "Infamous
Three," representing the Theta
Delta Chi frternity. One ol the
threesome, imitating Cal coach
Mike White, called the Cal stu
dent union and arranged to
have the Axe brought to the
weekly football writer's meet
ing for some publicity pictures.
Two members ot the Stanford
group posed as Cal tootball
players and led four represen

tatives of the Cal Rally Commit
tee to the meeting (Tuesday,
Nov. 20at Ming's Restaurant in
Palo Alto). After arriving at
Ming's, one of the rally com
mittee went inside to fetch
White. Meanwhile, one of the
two "football players"
suggested he be allowed to
carry the Axe inside. Permis
sion was granted, and he im
mediately took off with the
Axe, as the rally committee
gave chase. A flying tackle pin
ned him to the hood of a Cadil
lac, with the Axe bouncing off
the car's roof. Suddenly, rein
forcements from Theta Delta
Chi appeared, and they
promptly spirited the Axe back
to Stanford.
