# The 						Big Game: Tradition lives on

### Peter Finch 
People who aren't familiar
with the Stanford-Cal rivalry
might say that nothing is at
stake in today's contest.
Quietly tell them they're
wrong.
It's the Rir.f'.AMP
WVio cares that neither Stan
ford nor Cal is going to a bowl
game? This /s a bowl game! It's
a classic, a spectacle, an event!
Stanford's Cardinals, com
ing off a staggering defeat at
the hands of the Oregon
Ducks, will need a victory to
secure their 12th-straight win
ning season. The Bears, turned
around by a healthy 45-13
whipping of Washington last
week, can also salvage a win
ning season with a victory to
day.
"You're dealing with two
frustrated teams who had the
chance to distinguish them
selves with good win-loss re
cords, but both came up
short," Stanford coach Rod
Dowhower said. "Obviously,
we're disappointed that we
were eliminated from the bowl
picture last week, but I expect
us to rise to the occasion and
give an outstanding effort in
the Big Game."
"Records don't mean a
whole lot," Stanford quarter
back Turk Schonert said. "Our
team's forgotten last week's
loss already. That makes no dif
ference to us now."
What does make a difference
is Schonert's passing skills. A
fifth-year senior, Schonert has
completed 76.1 percent of his
passes for 748 yards and nine
TDs during the last four games.

Despite a somewhat shakey
performance last week,
Schonert still leads the
Pacitic-10 Conference in pas
sing.
Not far behind Schonert is
the Bears' quarterback. Rich
.Vic u-j, ,:i:>-pouna
junior has completed 66.8 per
cent of his passes f0r2294 yards
and 10 touchdowns on the sea
son.
On the receiving end of
Campbell's passes are split end
Matt Bouza (51 receptions for
710 yards and 4 TDs) and
flanker Michael Bug g s (32
catches for 528 yards and 3
touchdowns).
Besides the Bears' impres
sive aerial abilities, they have a
powerful running threat
headed by fullback Paul Jones.
Having run with the ball 190
times, (ones has pounded out
796 yards for a 4.2 yard average.
Countering the Bears' re
ceiving attack will be three out
standing Stanford players in
Andre Tyler (41 catches for 594
yards and 4 touchdowns,
flanker Ken Margerum (35
catches for 672 yards and 10
TDs), and halfback Mike Dot
terer (31 grabs for 299 yards and
4 touchdowns). Margerum's
touchdown reception last
week against Oregon gives him
a career total of 19. That mark,
attained after only three sea
sons, betters the Stanford
career record of 18, which was
previously held by Tony Hill,
now of the NFL's Dallas Cow
boys.
Atypically, Stanford kept the
ball on the ground tor much of

statistic lead.
last Saturday's contest. This
may have been due to the con
dition of Schonert, who was hit
hard early in the game and suf
fered a concussion. It's more
likely, however, that the Cards'
inability to pass was the result
of heavy coverage by the Ore
gon secondary.
In any case, Stanford does
have the potential to move the
ball on the ground, whether or
not they showed it last week.
Freshman halfbacks Vincent
White and Mike Dotterer have
each carried the ball 94 times
foratotal ofßl2yards (Dotterer
lias 365, White has 447).
Fullback Greg Hooper,
another freshman, has also
shown great promise by run
ning the ball 47 times for 221
yards.
On defense, the Cards put in
a reasonably respectable per
formance against the Ducks.
Holding Oregon to just 16
points, the Stanford defense
was led by the play of
linebacker Dave Morze (20
tackles), end Chuck Evans (17
tackles, one sack), safety Steve
Foley (1b tackles) and corner
back Rick Gervais (five tackles,
two interceptions). While the
Cardinal offense was being
held to just 55 passing yards,
the defense was forcing the
Ducks to drop four fumbles
and throw two interceptions.
Coincidentally, the most im
pessive aspect of the Bears' last
outing was the performance of
their defense.
After .some early adjust
ments, the Bears settled down
to hole) the Cougars to just 13
points. It was only the second
time in 1979 that WSU was un
able to score more than 17
points, a figure to which Ohio
State and USC could not even

hold them.
"We (Cal and Stanford) do a
lot of the same things," Cal
head coach Roger Theder
noted. "The pressure will be
on our defense, but that's
okay. They have proven they
can handle both pressure and
adversity."
With all the emotion in
volved in a Big Game, there
should be plenty of mental
pressure for the players today.
"The Big Came means as
much to me as any game I've
ever played here," Stanford's
Evans said. "It's my last game,

hell, it means as much as the
Rose Bowl, I guess."
"It's tough to explain what
the Big Game is like," Cal's
)ones said. "But you see some
alumni after you lose one, and
you'll know how important it is
"With all the tradition in my
family," Stanford senior
linebacker Milt McColl
explained, "the Big Game gen
erates a lot of excitement. It's
always a lot of fun. There's just
something about playing Cal
that is very exciting. We're
going out there to win."
