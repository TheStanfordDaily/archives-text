# The
						Big Game: Tradition lives on

People who aren't familiar
with the Stanford-Cal rivalry
might say that nothing is at
stake in today's contest.
Quietly tell them they're
wrong.
It's the Rir.f'.AMP
WVio cares that neither Stan
ford nor Cal is going to a bowl
game? This /s a bowl game! It's
a classic, a spectacle, an event!
Stanford's Cardinals, com
ing off a staggering defeat at
the hands of the Oregon
Ducks, will need a victory to
secure their 12th-straight win
ning season. The Bears, turned
around by a healthy 45-13
whipping of Washington last
week, can also salvage a win
ning season with a victory to
day.
"You're dealing with two
frustrated teams who had the
chance to distinguish them
selves with good win-loss re
cords, but both came up
short," Stanford coach Rod
Dowhower said. "Obviously,
we're disappointed that we
were eliminated from the bowl
picture last week, but I expect
us to rise to the occasion and
give an outstanding effort in
the Big Game."
"Records don't mean a
whole lot," Stanford quarter
back Turk Schonert said. "Our
team's forgotten last week's
loss already. That makes no dif
ference to us now."
What does make a difference
is Schonert's passing skills. A
fifth-year senior, Schonert has
completed 76.1 percent of his
passes for 748 yards and nine
TDs during the last four games.

Despite a somewhat shakey
performance last week,
Schonert still leads the
Pacitic-10 Conference in pas
sing.
Not far behind Schonert is
the Bears' quarterback. Rich
.Vic u-j, ,:i:>-pouna
junior has completed 66.8 per
cent of his passes f0r2294 yards
and 10 touchdowns on the sea
son.
On the receiving end of
Campbell's passes are split end
Matt Bouza (51 receptions for
710 yards and 4 TDs) and
flanker Michael Bug g s (32
catches for 528 yards and 3
touchdowns).
Besides the Bears' impres
sive aerial abilities, they have a
powerful running threat
headed by fullback Paul Jones.
Having run with the ball 190
times, (ones has pounded out
796 yards for a 4.2 yard average.
Countering the Bears' re
ceiving attack will be three out
standing Stanford players in
Andre Tyler (41 catches for 594
yards and 4 touchdowns,
flanker Ken Margerum (35
catches for 672 yards and 10
TDs), and halfback Mike Dot
terer (31 grabs for 299 yards and
4 touchdowns). Margerum's
touchdown reception last
week against Oregon gives him
a career total of 19. That mark,
attained after only three sea
sons, betters the Stanford
career record of 18, which was
previously held by Tony Hill,
now of the NFL's Dallas Cow
boys.

disappointing loss. Overall, the Card defense put in a respectable performance last Saturday, but were
unfortunately required to spend an inordinate amount of time on the field.

Here Stanford quarterback Turk Schonert does what he does best: drops
Imik to throw. Last week Schonert was only able to throw a slim nine
passes in the loss to Oregon, but he still maintains a hold on the Pac-tO
statistic lead.
