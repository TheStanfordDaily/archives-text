# 'College players should never be booed'
## Schonert has his say 
### 
(Editor's Note: He's ,mother
great Stanford quarterback.
Wh.it else is there to say? Well,
there's a lot to say, and we at
Cards Today thought we d let
Turk Schonert speak for him
self. Schonert, a fifth-year
senior, got his first start in more
than four years against Tulane
this season. He has since dis
tinguished himself as one ot
the premier passers in the na
tion. A native of Southern
California, he sat on the bench
for four years, and yet it he
keeps hitting his receivers
today with the ac< i/racv he's
had all season, he < <>uld break
both the Stanford and Pai -10
single season passing records.
Turk Schoncit /> a surprise, but
he s no tluke. Alter a bit
tersweet season, today is his
last game. This is what he had
to say in an exclusive Cardinal*
Today interview with \like
Oneal.)
Cards Today: Are you disap
pointed at this point, knowing
that the team can t go to a howl
game now?
Schonert: Veah, I was disap
pointed, since it is my last year
and everything. I know all the
seniors wanted to go real bad
and last week's game kinda put
a damper on things. But sine e it
is the "Big Week," I think
we've recovered trom it a little
quicker than most losses. A
loss like that, knocking you out
of a bowl game, is very disap
pointing, and it's hard to come

hack and play an emotional
game. But since this is the Big
Game, I don't think we'll have
any problem.
Cards Today: This is your last
year. What is your gut feeling
about the season in general?
Schonert: Well, you look
upon it and we've had some
good times and some frustrat
ing times. You look at the SC
game, the UCLA game, the
ASU game — we've beat some
good teams. Then you look at
the losses and it's just frustrat
ing to think what might have
been made out of the year. I
believe we're a much better
team than our r >-4-1 record in
dicates right now. But we had
to overcome a lot ot adversity
at the beginning of the season
— we had a lot of injuries and a
new coaching staff, a lot of
young players, and things
didn t go right at first — but we
got through that, so I think it
was a pretty successful season.
Cards Today: What about
your performance? How do
you feel about that for this sea
son?
Schonert: I'm pleased with
my performance and how I've
progressed as a quarterback.
Of course I would have liked to
have played a little more than I
did all vear, but those things
happen and there's not too
much I can do about it.
I learned quite a bit about my
selt this season from that experi
ence, though (the quar

terback problem earlier in the
year), and I think that's going
to help me down the line with
football and with life in gen
eral. Maybe it was a good
thing, because I think it helped
me to grow up a lot faster than
some people will, just because
they haven't been in that kind
of a situation. Some people
could have let it ruin them, but
you have to learn from that
kind of experience because it
will probably come up again
somewhere down the road,
and now I'll he more readv for
it.
(ards Today: Do you think
vou've been able to lead the
team effectively this year?
Schonert: Yeah I do. I think
I'm one of the guys on the team
the other guys look up to and
respect. When I'm not in there
sometimes it kind of reflects on
the team. To have a leader or a
team captain not in there hurts
the morale of the team.
Cards Toddy: What brought
about the change in the team
after the Army game? It
seemed like a whole change in
feeling.
Schonert: It was. We became
a lot closer to the coaching staff
and vice versa. We were able to
communicate a lot better. Be
fore, the coaches were way up
at the top and we were way
down at the bottom with no
communication in between.
We just kind of closed the gap.
