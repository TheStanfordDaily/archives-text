# 'College players should never be booed'
## Schonert has his say 
### 
(Editor's Note: He's ,mother
great Stanford quarterback.
Wh.it else is there to say? Well,
there's a lot to say, and we at
Cards Today thought we d let
Turk Schonert speak for him
self. Schonert, a fifth-year
senior, got his first start in more
than four years against Tulane
this season. He has since dis
tinguished himself as one ot
the premier passers in the na
tion. A native of Southern
California, he sat on the bench
for four years, and yet it he
keeps hitting his receivers
today with the ac< i/racv he's
had all season, he < <>uld break
both the Stanford and Pai -10
single season passing records.
Turk Schoncit /> a surprise, but
he s no tluke. Alter a bit
tersweet season, today is his
last game. This is what he had
to say in an exclusive Cardinal*
Today interview with \like
Oneal.)
Cards Today: Are you disap
pointed at this point, knowing
that the team can t go to a howl
game now?
Schonert: Veah, I was disap
pointed, since it is my last year
and everything. I know all the
seniors wanted to go real bad
and last week's game kinda put
a damper on things. But sine e it
is the "Big Week," I think
we've recovered trom it a little
quicker than most losses. A
loss like that, knocking you out
of a bowl game, is very disap
pointing, and it's hard to come

hack and play an emotional
game. But since this is the Big
Game, I don't think we'll have
any problem.
Cards Today: This is your last
year. What is your gut feeling
about the season in general?
Schonert: Well, you look
upon it and we've had some
good times and some frustrat
ing times. You look at the SC
game, the UCLA game, the
ASU game — we've beat some
good teams. Then you look at
the losses and it's just frustrat
ing to think what might have
been made out of the year. I
believe we're a much better
team than our r >-4-1 record in
dicates right now. But we had
to overcome a lot ot adversity
at the beginning of the season
— we had a lot of injuries and a
new coaching staff, a lot of
young players, and things
didn t go right at first — but we
got through that, so I think it
was a pretty successful season.
Cards Today: What about
your performance? How do
you feel about that for this sea
son?
Schonert: I'm pleased with
my performance and how I've
progressed as a quarterback.
Of course I would have liked to
have played a little more than I
did all vear, but those things
happen and there's not too
much I can do about it.
I learned quite a bit about my
selt this season from that experi
ence, though (the quar

terback problem earlier in the
year), and I think that's going
to help me down the line with
football and with life in gen
eral. Maybe it was a good
thing, because I think it helped
me to grow up a lot faster than
some people will, just because
they haven't been in that kind
of a situation. Some people
could have let it ruin them, but
you have to learn from that
kind of experience because it
will probably come up again
somewhere down the road,
and now I'll he more readv for
it.
(ards Today: Do you think
vou've been able to lead the
team effectively this year?
Schonert: Yeah I do. I think
I'm one of the guys on the team
the other guys look up to and
respect. When I'm not in there
sometimes it kind of reflects on
the team. To have a leader or a
team captain not in there hurts
the morale of the team.
Cards Toddy: What brought
about the change in the team
after the Army game? It
seemed like a whole change in
feeling.
Schonert: It was. We became
a lot closer to the coaching staff
and vice versa. We were able to
communicate a lot better. Be
fore, the coaches were way up
at the top and we were way
down at the bottom with no
communication in between.
We just kind of closed the gap.
Cards Today: What do vou
think makes Stanford play the
kind of game it did against USC
and then come out and play
like it did against Oregon
State? What makes for the fluc
tuations between good and
bad? It seems that this has al
ways been a trait of Stanford
foodball.
Schonert: That's one of those
things that you can't really exp
lain. I'm getting sick and tired
of hearing that — that Stanford
gets up for big games but they

don't really care about the
games they're supposed to
win. I think it's bullshit. We
never go into a game when
we're not ready to play,
but every team can't be emo
tional for every game. For the
so-called easy games you just
have to be mentally ready to
play. But I just can't figure it
out. I don't know why that
happens.
Cards Today: Do you think
Stanford players are just like
other players, or do you think

that the Pac-10 myth that the
Cards are somehow different is
true?
Schonert: We're just the
same. It's funny, I was at an
Arizona function after the
game and people thought that
Stanford was back East — that's
just the idea they have. They
were so surprised that we were
there instead of studying in the
hotel that night. We're just like
anybody else; we like to have a
good time.
Girc/s Today: At the begin
ning of the year you were get
ting a lot of dubious press,
even though a lot of the time it
wasn't your fault. Are you
proud of the tact that you could
overcome all of that and have
an excellent season?
Schonert: Veah, I am. Vou
know, at the beginning of the
season the offensive unit
didn't know one another, and
when you have that kind of
disorder you're going to have
mistakes. When you have mis
takes, it naturally points to the
quarterback. People just didn't
realize how young we were.
Cards Today: Now that
you've come through it all and
become the kind of quarter
back you are, does that make
you *i little cynical ot the press
and the fans?
Schonert: Veah, it does
sometimes. It's really easy to
say, "Screw you guys" or
something like that, but I'm
not really that kind of person.
I know what I can do and I
knew it all along, so I don't
have to go and tell the other
people what I think of them.
Cards Today: But what do you
think of them?
Schonert: I just think they're
all assholes. Even if someone is
doing bad out there, a college
football player should not be
booed. He's coming out and
trying his hardest, he's not get
ting paid and some assholes
come in here to watch the
game and they boo some guy.
That's just ridiculous. I think
those guys ought to be carted
out of the stadium. They have
no sense of reality about what's
going on.
Cards Today: What were your
first four years like at Stanford?
You didn't play, and that must
have been tough. Did you ever
think about what it would be
like to play for another school?
Schonert: I've always thought
about that, but then^a^amJ'^e
When you're not playing it gets
kind of frustrating, but you just
turn your mind to other things.
I didn't let football interfere

with my life so much that my
social lite was unpleasant too.
My first two years I was just
like a regular student here. I
played ).V. football my
freshman year and really liked
that. That was tun. But then I
was red-shirted and then I was
third team one year and you
never play. Last year was a little
different because there was
that possibility that I could play
inanwoamo- Simm — 1
go down on any play.
Cards Today: Do you think
going to Stanford has made
you a better quarterback than
vou would have been if vou

had gone somewhere else?
Schonert: As far as knowing
and running a pro-style of
fense, I don't think there's a
more complicated one than
Stanford's in the country. If I
do go into the pros, I think this
will help it a lot.
Cards Today: What about the
pros?
Schonert: I've been con
tacted and heard some pretty
sit back and see what happens.
I'm not real sure. I'm not gonna
take anything for granted.
When you do that there tends
to be a letdown when some

thing goes wrong, like with
Cerescino when he didn't get
dratted. You can't expect any
thing. But from what I've
heard, I have an excellent op
portunity.
Cards Today: It the pros don't
come through for you, where
do you think we'll be able to
find Turk Schonert in ten
years?
~J /y t hf [!l n
California because I like it up
here. I have a couple of busi
ness opportunities and I'd
probably do that. But I'd like to
stay up here.

been made out of the year. I
believe we're a much better
team than our r >-4-1 record in
dicates right now. But we had
to overcome a lot ot adversity
at the beginning of the season
— we had a lot of injuries and a
new coaching staff, a lot of
young players, and things
didn t go right at first — but we
got through that, so I think it
was a pretty successful season.
Cards Today: What about
your performance? How do
you feel about that for this sea
son?
Schonert: I'm pleased with
my performance and how I've
progressed as a quarterback.
Of course I would have liked to
have played a little more than I
did all vear, but those things
happen and there's not too
much I can do about it.
I learned quite a bit about my
selt this season from that experi
ence, though (the quar

terback problem earlier in the
year), and I think that's going
to help me down the line with
football and with life in gen
eral. Maybe it was a good
thing, because I think it helped
me to grow up a lot faster than
some people will, just because
they haven't been in that kind
of a situation. Some people
could have let it ruin them, but
you have to learn from that
kind of experience because it
will probably come up again
somewhere down the road,
and now I'll he more readv for
it.
(ards Today: Do you think
vou've been able to lead the
team effectively this year?
Schonert: Yeah I do. I think
I'm one of the guys on the team
the other guys look up to and
respect. When I'm not in there
sometimes it kind of reflects on
the team. To have a leader or a
team captain not in there hurts
the morale of the team.
Cards Toddy: What brought
about the change in the team
after the Army game? It
seemed like a whole change in
feeling.
Schonert: It was. We became
a lot closer to the coaching staff
and vice versa. We were able to
communicate a lot better. Be
fore, the coaches were way up
at the top and we were way
down at the bottom with no
communication in between.
We just kind of closed the gap.
Cards Today: What do vou
think makes Stanford play the
kind of game it did against USC
and then come out and play
like it did against Oregon
State? What makes for the fluc
tuations between good and
bad? It seems that this has al
ways been a trait of Stanford
foodball.
Schonert: That's one of those
things that you can't really exp
lain. I'm getting sick and tired
of hearing that — that Stanford
gets up for big games but they

don't really care about the
games they're supposed to
win. I think it's bullshit. We
never go into a game when
we're not ready to play,
but every team can't be emo
tional for every game. For the
so-called easy games you just
have to be mentally ready to
play. But I just can't figure it
out. I don't know why that
happens.
Cards Today: Do you think
Stanford players are just like
other players, or do you think

that the Pac-10 myth that the
Cards are somehow different is
true?
Schonert: We're just the
same. It's funny, I was at an
Arizona function after the
game and people thought that
Stanford was back East — that's
just the idea they have. They
were so surprised that we were
there instead of studying in the
hotel that night. We're just like
anybody else; we like to have a
good time.
Girc/s Today: At the begin
ning of the year you were get
ting a lot of dubious press,
even though a lot of the time it
wasn't your fault. Are you
proud of the tact that you could
overcome all of that and have
an excellent season?
Schonert: Veah, I am. Vou
know, at the beginning of the
season the offensive unit
didn't know one another, and
when you have that kind of
disorder you're going to have
mistakes. When you have mis
takes, it naturally points to the
quarterback. People just didn't
realize how young we were.
Cards Today: Now that
you've come through it all and
become the kind of quarter
back you are, does that make
you *i little cynical ot the press
and the fans?
Schonert: Veah, it does
sometimes. It's really easy to
say, "Screw you guys" or
something like that, but I'm
not really that kind of person.
I know what I can do and I
knew it all along, so I don't
have to go and tell the other
people what I think of them.
Cards Today: But what do you
think of them?
Schonert: I just think they're
all assholes. Even if someone is
doing bad out there, a college
football player should not be
booed. He's coming out and
trying his hardest, he's not get
ting paid and some assholes
come in here to watch the
game and they boo some guy.
That's just ridiculous. I think
those guys ought to be carted
out of the stadium. They have
no sense of reality about what's
going on.
Cards Today: What were your
first four years like at Stanford?
You didn't play, and that must
have been tough. Did you ever
think about what it would be
like to play for another school?
Schonert: I've always thought
about that, but then^a^amJ'^e
When you're not playing it gets
kind of frustrating, but you just
turn your mind to other things.
I didn't let football interfere

with my life so much that my
social lite was unpleasant too.
My first two years I was just
like a regular student here. I
played ).V. football my
freshman year and really liked
that. That was tun. But then I
was red-shirted and then I was
third team one year and you
never play. Last year was a little
different because there was
that possibility that I could play
inanwoamo- Simm — 1
go down on any play.
Cards Today: Do you think
going to Stanford has made
you a better quarterback than
vou would have been if vou

had gone somewhere else?
Schonert: As far as knowing
and running a pro-style of
fense, I don't think there's a
more complicated one than
Stanford's in the country. If I
do go into the pros, I think this
will help it a lot.
Cards Today: What about the
pros?
Schonert: I've been con
tacted and heard some pretty
sit back and see what happens.
I'm not real sure. I'm not gonna
take anything for granted.
When you do that there tends
to be a letdown when some

thing goes wrong, like with
Cerescino when he didn't get
dratted. You can't expect any
thing. But from what I've
heard, I have an excellent op
portunity.
Cards Today: It the pros don't
come through for you, where
do you think we'll be able to
find Turk Schonert in ten
years?
~J /y t hf [!l n
California because I like it up
here. I have a couple of busi
ness opportunities and I'd
probably do that. But I'd like to
stay up here.
(Editor's Note: He's ,mother
great Stanford quarterback.
Wh.it else is there to say? Well,
there's a lot to say, and we at
Cards Today thought we d let
Turk Schonert speak for him
self. Schonert, a fifth-year
senior, got his first start in more
than four years against Tulane
this season. He has since dis
tinguished himself as one ot
the premier passers in the na
tion. A native of Southern
California, he sat on the bench
for four years, and yet it he
keeps hitting his receivers
today with the ac< i/racv he's
had all season, he < <>uld break
both the Stanford and Pai -10
single season passing records.
Turk Schoncit /> a surprise, but
he s no tluke. Alter a bit
tersweet season, today is his
last game. This is what he had
to say in an exclusive Cardinal*
Today interview with \like
Oneal.)
Cards Today: Are you disap
pointed at this point, knowing
that the team can t go to a howl
game now?
Schonert: Veah, I was disap
pointed, since it is my last year
and everything. I know all the
seniors wanted to go real bad
and last week's game kinda put
a damper on things. But sine e it
is the "Big Week," I think
we've recovered trom it a little
quicker than most losses. A
loss like that, knocking you out
of a bowl game, is very disap
pointing, and it's hard to come

hack and play an emotional
game. But since this is the Big
Game, I don't think we'll have
any problem.
Cards Today: This is your last
year. What is your gut feeling
about the season in general?
Schonert: Well, you look
upon it and we've had some
good times and some frustrat
ing times. You look at the SC
game, the UCLA game, the
ASU game — we've beat some
good teams. Then you look at
the losses and it's just frustrat
ing to think what might have
been made out of the year. I
believe we're a much better
team than our r >-4-1 record in
dicates right now. But we had

communicate a lot better. Be
fore, the coaches were way up
at the top and we were way
down at the bottom with no
communication in between.
We just kind of closed the gap.
Cards Today: What do vou
think makes Stanford play the
kind of game it did against USC
and then come out and play
like it did against Oregon
State? What makes for the fluc
tuations between good and
bad? It seems that this has al
ways been a trait of Stanford
foodball.
Schonert: That's one of those
things that you can't really exp
lain. I'm getting sick and tired
of hearing that — that Stanford
gets up for big games but they

don't really care about the
games they're supposed to
win. I think it's bullshit. We
never go into a game when
we're not ready to play,
but every team can't be emo
tional for every game. For the
so-called easy games you just
have to be mentally ready to
play. But I just can't figure it
out. I don't know why that
happens.
Cards Today: Do you think
Stanford players are just like
other players, or do you think

that the Pac-10 myth that the
Cards are somehow different is
true?
Schonert: We're just the
same. It's funny, I was at an
Arizona function after the
game and people thought that
Stanford was back East — that's
just the idea they have. They
were so surprised that we were
there instead of studying in the
hotel that night. We're just like
anybody else; we like to have a
good time.
Girc/s Today: At the begin
ning of the year you were get
ting a lot of dubious press,
even though a lot of the time it
wasn't your fault. Are you
proud of the tact that you could
overcome all of that and have
an excellent season?
Schonert: Veah, I am. Vou
know, at the beginning of the
season the offensive unit
didn't know one another, and
when you have that kind of
disorder you're going to have
mistakes. When you have mis
takes, it naturally points to the
quarterback. People just didn't
realize how young we were.
Cards Today: Now that
you've come through it all and
become the kind of quarter
back you are, does that make
you *i little cynical ot the press
and the fans?
Schonert: Veah, it does
sometimes. It's really easy to
say, "Screw you guys" or
something like that, but I'm
not really that kind of person.
I know what I can do and I
knew it all along, so I don't
have to go and tell the other
people what I think of them.
Cards Today: But what do you
think of them?
Schonert: I just think they're
all assholes. Even if someone is
doing bad out there, a college
football player should not be
booed. He's coming out and
trying his hardest, he's not get
ting paid and some assholes
come in here to watch the
game and they boo some guy.
That's just ridiculous. I think
those guys ought to be carted
out of the stadium. They have
no sense of reality about what's
going on.
Cards Today: What were your
first four years like at Stanford?
You didn't play, and that must
have been tough. Did you ever
think about what it would be
like to play for another school?
Schonert: I've always thought
about that, but then^a^amJ'^e
When you're not playing it gets
kind of frustrating, but you just
turn your mind to other things.
I didn't let football interfere

with my life so much that my
social lite was unpleasant too.
My first two years I was just
like a regular student here. I
played ).V. football my
freshman year and really liked
that. That was tun. But then I
was red-shirted and then I was
third team one year and you
never play. Last year was a little
different because there was
that possibility that I could play
inanwoamo- Simm — 1
go down on any play.
Cards Today: Do you think
going to Stanford has made
you a better quarterback than
vou would have been if vou

had gone somewhere else?
Schonert: As far as knowing
and running a pro-style of
fense, I don't think there's a
more complicated one than
Stanford's in the country. If I
do go into the pros, I think this
will help it a lot.
Cards Today: What about the
pros?
Schonert: I've been con
tacted and heard some pretty
sit back and see what happens.
I'm not real sure. I'm not gonna
take anything for granted.
When you do that there tends
to be a letdown when some

thing goes wrong, like with
Cerescino when he didn't get
dratted. You can't expect any
thing. But from what I've
heard, I have an excellent op
portunity.
Cards Today: It the pros don't
come through for you, where
do you think we'll be able to
find Turk Schonert in ten
years?
~J /y t hf [!l n
California because I like it up
here. I have a couple of busi
ness opportunities and I'd
probably do that. But I'd like to
stay up here.
(Editor's Note: He's ,mother
great Stanford quarterback.
Wh.it else is there to say? Well,
there's a lot to say, and we at
Cards Today thought we d let
Turk Schonert speak for him
self. Schonert, a fifth-year
senior, got his first start in more
than four years against Tulane
this season. He has since dis
tinguished himself as one ot
the premier passers in the na
tion. A native of Southern
California, he sat on the bench
for four years, and yet it he
keeps hitting his receivers
today with the ac< i/racv he's
had all season, he < <>uld break
both the Stanford and Pai -10
single season passing records.
Turk Schoncit /> a surprise, but
he s no tluke. Alter a bit
tersweet season, today is his
last game. This is what he had
to say in an exclusive Cardinal*
Today interview with \like
Oneal.)
Cards Today: Are you disap
pointed at this point, knowing
that the team can t go to a howl
game now?
Schonert: Veah, I was disap
pointed, since it is my last year
and everything. I know all the
seniors wanted to go real bad
and last week's game kinda put
a damper on things. But sine e it
is the "Big Week," I think
we've recovered trom it a little
quicker than most losses. A
loss like that, knocking you out
of a bowl game, is very disap
pointing, and it's hard to come

hack and play an emotional
game. But since this is the Big
Game, I don't think we'll have
any problem.
Cards Today: This is your last
year. What is your gut feeling
about the season in general?
Schonert: Well, you look
upon it and we've had some
good times and some frustrat
ing times. You look at the SC
game, the UCLA game, the
ASU game — we've beat some
good teams. Then you look at
the losses and it's just frustrat
ing to think what might have
been made out of the year. I
believe we're a much better
team than our r >-4-1 record in
dicates right now. But we had
to overcome a lot ot adversity
at the beginning of the season
— we had a lot of injuries and a
new coaching staff, a lot of
young players, and things
didn t go right at first — but we
got through that, so I think it
was a pretty successful season.
Cards Today: What about
your performance? How do
you feel about that for this sea
son?
Schonert: I'm pleased with
my performance and how I've
progressed as a quarterback.
Of course I would have liked to
have played a little more than I
did all vear, but those things
happen and there's not too
much I can do about it.
I learned quite a bit about my
selt this season from that experi
ence, though (the quar

terback problem earlier in the
year), and I think that's going
to help me down the line with
football and with life in gen
eral. Maybe it was a good
thing, because I think it helped
me to grow up a lot faster than
some people will, just because
they haven't been in that kind
of a situation. Some people
could have let it ruin them, but
you have to learn from that
kind of experience because it
will probably come up again
somewhere down the road,
and now I'll he more readv for
it.
(ards Today: Do you think
vou've been able to lead the
team effectively this year?
Schonert: Yeah I do. I think
I'm one of the guys on the team
the other guys look up to and
respect. When I'm not in there
sometimes it kind of reflects on
the team. To have a leader or a
team captain not in there hurts
the morale of the team.
Cards Toddy: What brought
about the change in the team
after the Army game? It
seemed like a whole change in
feeling.
Schonert: It was. We became
a lot closer to the coaching staff
and vice versa. We were able to
communicate a lot better. Be
fore, the coaches were way up
at the top and we were way
down at the bottom with no
communication in between.
We just kind of closed the gap.
