## Walsh assesses new job

Walshtalgia?
Everyone has felt il at some
point this season, including
ex-Stanford coach Bill Walsh
himself. As the 49ers and the
Cards neai the end of two trus
o - - • ' i ■
member happier days.
When people remember
Walsh at Stanford, it's hard to
escape the words "respect"
and "business-like."
Yes, but what was he really
like?
Well, that's what he was re
ally like, at least to his players.
"It was more of a business
relationship. He tried to keep it
that way, I think. Not many
people could get close to
him," Turk Schonert remem
bers. "I guess it was just his
philosophy, the way he
thought."
Defensive tackle and co
captain Chuck Evans has seen
three head coaches and five
position coaches in his four

and a half years at Stanford. He
spent more time under Walsh
than any other coach. He ag
rees that Walsh was business
like, to say the least.
"He was a different sort. It
was kind ot like a pro tamp, the
guy that everyone got real per
sonal with," he continued.
"He didn't get real involved.
Vou got personal with the as
sistant coaches."
Though neither Schonert
nor Evans was very close to
Walsh, they respected him
tremendously and still do.
"I really respect him as a
coach and as a person," said
Schonert. "He was willing to
help you off the field. You
could talk to him, you know,
like 'how's everything go
ing?'," Schonert added. "As a
coach, I have all the respect in
the world for him. As far as his
offensive ingenuity, not many
people are as good as he is."

Between all the respect and
dignity, it's hard to tell if Walsh
has a sense of humor. "He had
some tunny jokes at practice,"
Evans laughed. "I liked the way
he handled them. They flowed
really well. It was very profes
sional, and I think it was good
that," he said.
Game situations seem to be
an area where Walsh com
manded the most respect, as
frustrating as his two years at
Stanford may have been."He
treated you like a man,"
Schonert said. "When things
were going wrong, he
wouldn't embarrass you or
humiliate you by yelling. He
simply explained to you what
was wrong. No one likes to
havethecoachyellingat himor
jumping in his face. He treated
you like a man, and I think
players really respected him
for that," he finished.
"He was always very calm,"
Evans agreed. "He had a lot of
experience, so he handled
himself very well. He knows
the business."
Bill Walsh, "This is Your
Life":
With five weeks to go in at
best a frustrating season with
the 49ers, Walsh-seems a little
more cynical, slightly bitter,
and a lot older. And he can't
help but look back at Stanford
with a little nostalgia of his
own. "I have many personal
ties with Stanford, still. Sure

If Bill Walsh appears somewhat puzzled, it may indeed be so. After
directing the Stanford Cards to two straight bowl games, Walsh decided
to accept a head coaching job with the San Francisco 49ers last year.
Now, nearly finished with his first season with the hapless 49ers, Walsh
may long for his days on the Farm.
there are things I miss: players
I had become close with, close
associations that I had in the
administration," he paused.
"And the thrill of running out
on the field every Saturday,
with the band playing.
Walsh linds tew differences
in his relationships with
players in the pros, or in col
lege. He does, however, find
himself dealing with a larger
cross-section of people.
"The pro players come from
all social backgrounds; they
have different levels of educa
tion and all ages," he re
marked.
And he does remember re
lating on a personal level with
some players, more so than
with the pros in fact.
"I became acquainted with
the parents of the players," he
said. "I was often involved in
getting them to come to Stan
ford in the first place, so I knew
them right from the start."
Walsh's voice is a touch wist
ful when he talks about Stan
ford. And just a little cynical
when he talks about his ex
periences since then. When
asked if he had improved since
he became a pro head coach, he
laughed tiredly. "I guess so,
but it's hardly measurable be
cause it's such a frustrating,
difficult and challenging thing.
I just hope I have," he replied.

He sounds even more tired
when he talks about the future
ot the 49ers. When asked how
long it would take to make
them a winning team, he
laughed again. "Oh boy. I re
ally don't know, three or tour
years maybe. I don't know if I
can last that long," he said.
"I just want to complete the
next five weeks and then see
where we stand, and evaluate
my career."
Walsh saw his share of frust
ration at Stanford as well. It was
no bed of roses. "Of course
there were some terrible mo
ments, like against
Washington. We just out
played them in every way and
should have won, but got every
bad break in the world. It was
terribly frustrating."
And he saw his share of great
moments. In fact, he's hard put
to pinpoint fhe single most
satisfying one. "Our victory
over UCLA was exciting, be
cause we hadn't beat them in
such a long time. The victories
in the bowl games were excit
ing, particularly fhe Bluebon
net, because we came from so
far behind The Oklahoma
game was very satisfying too.
In order, I would say coming
from behind in the Bluebonnet
Bowl, the victory in the Sun
Bowl, and then the UCLA vic
tory."
At any rate, Bill Walsh re
members: A win is still a win.
Play it again, Bill.
