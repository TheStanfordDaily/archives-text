Walshtalgia?
Everyone has felt il at some
point this season, including
ex-Stanford coach Bill Walsh
himself. As the 49ers and the
Cards neai the end of two trus
o - - • ' i ■
member happier days.
When people remember
Walsh at Stanford, it's hard to
escape the words "respect"
and "business-like."
Yes, but what was he really
like?
Well, that's what he was re
ally like, at least to his players.
"It was more of a business
relationship. He tried to keep it
that way, I think. Not many
people could get close to
him," Turk Schonert remem
bers. "I guess it was just his
philosophy, the way he
thought."
Defensive tackle and co
captain Chuck Evans has seen
three head coaches and five
position coaches in his four

and a half years at Stanford. He
spent more time under Walsh
than any other coach. He ag
rees that Walsh was business
like, to say the least.
"He was a different sort. It
was kind ot like a pro tamp, the
guy that everyone got real per
sonal with," he continued.
"He didn't get real involved.
Vou got personal with the as
sistant coaches."
Though neither Schonert
nor Evans was very close to
Walsh, they respected him
tremendously and still do.
"I really respect him as a
coach and as a person," said
Schonert. "He was willing to
help you off the field. You
could talk to him, you know,
like 'how's everything go
ing?'," Schonert added. "As a
coach, I have all the respect in
the world for him. As far as his
offensive ingenuity, not many
people are as good as he is."

Between all the respect and
dignity, it's hard to tell if Walsh
has a sense of humor. "He had
some tunny jokes at practice,"
Evans laughed. "I liked the way
he handled them. They flowed
really well. It was very profes
sional, and I think it was good
that," he said.
Game situations seem to be
an area where Walsh com
manded the most respect, as
frustrating as his two years at
Stanford may have been."He
treated you like a man,"
Schonert said. "When things
were going wrong, he
wouldn't embarrass you or
humiliate you by yelling. He
simply explained to you what
was wrong. No one likes to
havethecoachyellingat himor
jumping in his face. He treated
you like a man, and I think
players really respected him
for that," he finished.
"He was always very calm,"
Evans agreed. "He had a lot of
experience, so he handled
himself very well. He knows
the business."
Bill Walsh, "This is Your
Life":
With five weeks to go in at
best a frustrating season with
the 49ers, Walsh-seems a little
more cynical, slightly bitter,
and a lot older. And he can't
help but look back at Stanford
with a little nostalgia of his
own. "I have many personal
ties with Stanford, still. Sure

If Bill Walsh appears somewhat puzzled, it may indeed be so. After
directing the Stanford Cards to two straight bowl games, Walsh decided
to accept a head coaching job with the San Francisco 49ers last year.
Now, nearly finished with his first season with the hapless 49ers, Walsh
may long for his days on the Farm.
