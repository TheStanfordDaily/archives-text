## The 						Big Game to an outsider 
### Mike lupica 
When I was asked to write a
column about what you people
unblushingly refer to as Big
Game, I was a little contused. I
had no idea why people at Le
land Stanford's place would
possibly be interested in my
thoughts about Boston College
versus Holy Cross, which was
the only Big Game I ever knew.
You know, Boston College and
Holy Cross. From Mas
sachusetts. Two schools that
somehow manage to beat
Army every year.
At Boston College, which
was my school, the BC-Holy
Cross game was the social
event of the autumn, kind of a
Jesuit Super Bowl; it was an oc
casion for the priests to get as
drunk as the students, which
was a substantial amount ot
drunkenness, even tor the
priests at Boston College. It
was also an annual excuse for
Holy Cross students to paint
the big gold eagle on the BC
campus a truly horrid shade ot
purple (the Holy Cross school
color), and tor BC guys to be
even more insulting than usual
about Worcester, Mass.,
where Holy Cross is located.
We always used to sav that
Worcester was a great place to
live, it you were a smokestack
or a gas station.
Now I find that all those
Saturdays in my younger and
more impressionable years
were wasted. I didn't have to

drink all the brandy at Worces
ter's Fitton Field (another place
where the Army football team
has lost). I wasn't watching Big
Game. Big Game was being
played in northern California,
between the Stanford Trees
and the hated California Bears.
Understandably, this came
as somewhat of a shock to me,
not to mention a lot of col
legiate hangovers I still have
mounted and stuffed.
But given my choice this
year, my Big Game would he
Stantord-Cal. I'd love to see it.
There are a couple of sound
reasons for this. One is that
Boston College, which stunk
out The Farm this year (do you
people in California capitalize
everything?), hasn't won a
game since Herbert (Turk)
Hoover, my favorite Stanford
grad, was president. The other
reason is that Palo Alto, I've
discovered, is a terrific place to
have a cocktail, as long as it's
not being served by the snotty
waitresses at The Winery.
By now, I'm sure that
everyone around old Leland's
campus has recovered from
The Oregon Syndrome. Shame
about that. Just think: if there
were no state of Oregon, Stan
ford would be going to the
Rose Bowl. But no matter. In a
curious but quite real way,
those failures against Oregon
and Oregon State don't di
minish a most interesting sea
son at Stanford. It is still one of

the special places in all of col
lege football, a place where the
game is a little more sophisti
cated, and a lot more fun.
I'm told that on the night be
fore Big Game, the Stanford
band takes a little stroll
through the streets of San
Francisco. After having
watched a few Stanford games
this season, and listened to
that wonderfully crazy band,
I'd like to have taken that same
stroll. I have a feeling that you
could get into some real
Friday-night trouble hanging
out with the Stanford band.
And today, inspired by the
band, and the Stanford cheer
ing section — I call it the Studio
54 of Palo Alto — the football
team will probably take care of
the hated Calitornians. Cal
probably has great expecta
tions about this game, since
Stanford not only had all that
ditticulty with the state of Ore
gon, but lost to Army too,
which is something that didn't
even happen to Boston Col
lege, or Vietnam.
That is the true value of a Big
Came: you can use it any way
you want. In this case, if you're
Irom Stanford, you use it a little
nastily. Vou tell the hated
Californias that even in a funny
old up-and-down year like this
one, they still can't beat the
Trees. That's if the Trees are
really worthy of something,
and don't roll over and die.
So there's no Rose Bowl this
year. So Bill Walsh is gone, re
placed by Rod Dour-hower. So
this wasn't The Year (now I'm
using Calilornia capital letters).
You people must know that
1980 ought to be Stanford's
year. John Elway will become
one of Saturday's heroes in '80.
Ken Margerum will still be the
white Lynn Swann, and the
best receiver in all of college
tootball. Darrin Nelson will be
back to work all manner of
magic, running and receiving.
And all those Dotterers and
Tylers and Whites will be a year
older.
Ihe 1%0 edition of the Trees
might be one to make even
Dowhower smile, instead of
looking like Smokey the Bear
watching a torest burn down.
Ihe beauty of Stanford foot
! ball is that it is usually kept in
perspective by the people who
truly care about it, and under

stand it. Saturdays at The Farm
are college tootball treasures,
colorful and distinctive gems.
Aren't they so much more val
uable than the ones at South
ern Cal and Ohio State and
Alabama and Notre Dame?
Would anyone want to be
punching a clock and watching
games at those factories? There
is something almost whimsical
about watching football at
Stanford, rooting for this par
ticular team. It is always a rol
lercoaster ride, from Sep
tember until November.
Each Saturday is new; some
thing unexpected is liable to
happen, be it a wonder or a
disaster. In the same season,
you can beat up on Southern
Cal, then lose to Oregon State
when Rick (Wrong Way) Ger
vais goes south instead of
north with a kick-off. That is
part of the charm of Stanford
football, and no one should
ever lose sight of that. Anyone

who does should be sentenced
to a life term at The Winery.
There is one Saturday left
now, against those tacky folk
from Berkeley. It should not be
wasted. It should be used to
toast the rollercoaster '79 sea
son, and all the great dreams
you once had about Pasadena.
And at the same time, it should
be used to toast all the bright
promise of 1980.
So maybe this Big Game, this
year, isn't quite as big as it
could have been. It's still better
than most. And it's the only
one you've got.

and don't roll over and die.
So there's no Rose Bowl this
year. So Bill Walsh is gone, re
placed by Rod Dour-hower. So
this wasn't The Year (now I'm
using Calilornia capital letters).
You people must know that
1980 ought to be Stanford's
year. John Elway will become
one of Saturday's heroes in '80.
Ken Margerum will still be the
white Lynn Swann, and the
best receiver in all of college
tootball. Darrin Nelson will be
back to work all manner of
magic, running and receiving.
And all those Dotterers and
Tylers and Whites will be a year
older.
Ihe 1%0 edition of the Trees
might be one to make even
Dowhower smile, instead of
looking like Smokey the Bear
watching a torest burn down.
Ihe beauty of Stanford foot
! ball is that it is usually kept in
perspective by the people who
truly care about it, and under

stand it. Saturdays at The Farm
are college tootball treasures,
colorful and distinctive gems.
Aren't they so much more val
uable than the ones at South
ern Cal and Ohio State and
Alabama and Notre Dame?
Would anyone want to be
punching a clock and watching
games at those factories? There
is something almost whimsical
about watching football at
Stanford, rooting for this par
ticular team. It is always a rol
lercoaster ride, from Sep
tember until November.
Each Saturday is new; some
thing unexpected is liable to
happen, be it a wonder or a
disaster. In the same season,
you can beat up on Southern
Cal, then lose to Oregon State
when Rick (Wrong Way) Ger
vais goes south instead of
north with a kick-off. That is
part of the charm of Stanford
football, and no one should
ever lose sight of that. Anyone

who does should be sentenced
to a life term at The Winery.
There is one Saturday left
now, against those tacky folk
from Berkeley. It should not be
wasted. It should be used to
toast the rollercoaster '79 sea
son, and all the great dreams
you once had about Pasadena.
And at the same time, it should
be used to toast all the bright
promise of 1980.
So maybe this Big Game, this
year, isn't quite as big as it
could have been. It's still better
than most. And it's the only
one you've got.

Daily News. He has also been

lived to tell about it.)
When I was asked to write a
column about what you people
unblushingly refer to as Big
Game, I was a little contused. I
had no idea why people at Le
land Stanford's place would
possibly be interested in my
thoughts about Boston College
versus Holy Cross, which was
the only Big Game I ever knew.
You know, Boston College and
Holy Cross. From Mas
sachusetts. Two schools that
somehow manage to beat
Army every year.
At Boston College, which
was my school, the BC-Holy
Cross game was the social
event of the autumn, kind of a
Jesuit Super Bowl; it was an oc
casion for the priests to get as
drunk as the students, which
was a substantial amount ot
drunkenness, even tor the
priests at Boston College. It
was also an annual excuse for
Holy Cross students to paint
the big gold eagle on the BC
campus a truly horrid shade ot
purple (the Holy Cross school
color), and tor BC guys to be
even more insulting than usual
about Worcester, Mass.,
where Holy Cross is located.
We always used to sav that
Worcester was a great place to
live, it you were a smokestack
or a gas station.
Now I find that all those
Saturdays in my younger and
more impressionable years
were wasted. I didn't have to

drink all the brandy at Worces
ter's Fitton Field (another place
where the Army football team
has lost). I wasn't watching Big
Game. Big Game was being
played in northern California,
between the Stanford Trees
and the hated California Bears.
Understandably, this came
as somewhat of a shock to me,
not to mention a lot of col
legiate hangovers I still have
mounted and stuffed.
But given my choice this
year, my Big Game would he
Stantord-Cal. I'd love to see it.
There are a couple of sound
reasons for this. One is that
Boston College, which stunk
out The Farm this year (do you
people in California capitalize
everything?), hasn't won a
game since Herbert (Turk)
Hoover, my favorite Stanford
grad, was president. The other
reason is that Palo Alto, I've
discovered, is a terrific place to
have a cocktail, as long as it's
not being served by the snotty
waitresses at The Winery.
By now, I'm sure that
everyone around old Leland's
campus has recovered from
The Oregon Syndrome. Shame
about that. Just think: if there
were no state of Oregon, Stan
ford would be going to the
Rose Bowl. But no matter. In a
curious but quite real way,
those failures against Oregon
and Oregon State don't di
minish a most interesting sea
son at Stanford. It is still one of

the special places in all of col
lege football, a place where the
game is a little more sophisti
cated, and a lot more fun.
I'm told that on the night be
fore Big Game, the Stanford
band takes a little stroll
through the streets of San
Francisco. After having
watched a few Stanford games
this season, and listened to
that wonderfully crazy band,
I'd like to have taken that same
stroll. I have a feeling that you
could get into some real
Friday-night trouble hanging
out with the Stanford band.
And today, inspired by the
band, and the Stanford cheer
ing section — I call it the Studio
54 of Palo Alto — the football
team will probably take care of
the hated Calitornians. Cal
probably has great expecta
tions about this game, since
Stanford not only had all that
ditticulty with the state of Ore
gon, but lost to Army too,
which is something that didn't
even happen to Boston Col
lege, or Vietnam.
That is the true value of a Big
Came: you can use it any way
you want. In this case, if you're
Irom Stanford, you use it a little
nastily. Vou tell the hated
Californias that even in a funny
old up-and-down year like this
one, they still can't beat the
Trees. That's if the Trees are
really worthy of something,
and don't roll over and die.
