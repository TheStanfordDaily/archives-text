### Peter Hoberg 
Many fond memories of past
Big Games still linger in the
hearts of those who have been
involved with Stanford foot
ball. People have widespread
opinions on which game has
been the most exciting and
their personal favorite.
According to Stanford foot
ball radio announcer Don
Klein, who has been announc
ing Stanford football tor 24
years, the most exciting Big
Game was the 1974 contest in
Berkeley. This was the game in
which Stanford went from
"gloom to glory" in the last 21
seconds. After Gal quarterback
Steve Bartkowski had com
pleted a touchdown pass to his
favorite receiver Steve Kivera
to give the Bears a 20-19 lead,
there was gloom for the Gards.
Klein recalls, "I can still see
the Gal fans pouring out onto
the field. They all thought
they'd won it."
Then Stanford QB Guy Ben
jamin, starting from his 24-yard
line, completed two passes,
the first an 18-yarder to Ted
Pappas on the sidelines, the
second, a 42-yard connection
to Brad Williams, who barely
slithered out of bounds to stop
the clock with two seconds
remaining. That's when Mike
Langford came on to boot a
50-yard tield goal to give Stan
lord the victory — and the
glory.
"I'll always remember the
way the Gal fans turned back
toward their seats as the Stan
ford fans came running out
onto the field.
"1 he reason the game was so
exciting was because no matter
how good a kicker Langford
was, no matter how far he

kicked them in practice, no
matter what, the chances were
against it, and he did it."
Klein loves to see a good
contest, and the real cliffhan
gers have been his favorites,
"as long as Stanford comes out
ahead."
Associate Athletic Director
Gary Cavalli agrees that the
1974 Big Game was the most
exciting. He recalls vividly the
tinal few seconds. "40 percent
of the 80,000 fans in the
stadium were yelling tor
Langford to make it, and the
other 60 percent were yelling
for him to miss. But he put it
right through. Up in the press
box, the Berkeley athletic staff
nearly fell out of their chairs!"
But lor Cavalli "most excit
ing" does not necessarily imply
"favorite." "My favorite games
have been the ones when we
really kicked them all over the
tield like in the last two years."
He was referring to the 1977
and 1978 Big Games, in which
Stanford defeated Gal 21 - i and
30-10.
for former Stanford head
coach lack Christiansen, the
most thrilling and most
memorable Big Game was in
1976, Christiansen's last game
as a Stanford coach.
"I had been fired on the Fri
day before the game, and this
made the game very important
to me." A fumble recovery by
Duncan McColl on the Gal
two-yard line with two and
one-half minutes left in the
game set up the touchdown
that put Stanford in the front to
stay, 27-24.
Christiansen, now an assis
tant coach tor the Seattle Sea
hawks, was involved in nine
Big Games, first as an assistant
and later as head coach. The
1976 Big Came was the most
important to him.
"I was very happy for the
players. There had been a lot of
controversy and criticism
which had detracted from their

performance during the rest of
the year. That win was great for
all of us."
Former Stanford quarter
back |im Plunkett remembers
the Big Came of 1969 as his
favorite. Stanford won that one
29-28, thanks to Plunkett, who
engineered an 80-yard scoring
drive in the final quarter to give

the Indians (that's right, In
dians) the win.
"I remember that drive in
particular, because instead of
our usual passing, we ran the
ball very well and were able to
march the length of the field
mostly on the ground."
Plunkett's passing was also
impressive during that game,
as he hit on 22 of 42 attempts
for 381 yards, including two
scoring bombs of 47 and 72
yards to Howie Williams and

Jack Lalaster.
Stanford's head coach that
year was John Ralston, who has
enjoyed all of his Big Games.
"I spent time at 1b Big Games
. . . , and they were all out
standing. There is no way to
single out any one of them as
the best. There were no routs;
some games were-won by a
considerable margin, but they
were always exciting right to
the last minute."
Ralston was head coach at

Stanford from 1964 to 1972,
after both playing and coach
ing at Cal. He led Stanford to
Rose Bowl victories in 1971 and
1972.
There have been many other
thrilling Big Games in Stanford
history. Former Stanford Athle
tic Director John Liebendorfer
still remembers very clearly the
20-20 tie with Cal in 1924.
What's so exciting about a
20-20 tie?
"Well, it was only a ball game
for five minutes. Cal was up
20-6 with just five minutes left
when Murray Cuddeback and
his teammates got going."
Cuddeback led Stanford to
two touchdowns in those clos
ing minutes to eek out the
20-20 standoff and give Stan
ford the conference title.
Liebendorfer, who has wit
nessed between 50 and 55 Big
Games so far, also pointed out
the 1947 Big Game, which Stan
ford lost 21-1B in the closing
minutes to a Cal team who was
favored by 40 points.
Different games bring back
great memories and yield diffe
rent opinions, but all share in
common the thrill and excite
ment of the Big Game.

favorite receiver Steve Kivera
to give the Bears a 20-19 lead,
there was gloom for the Gards.
Klein recalls, "I can still see
the Gal fans pouring out onto
the field. They all thought
they'd won it."
Then Stanford QB Guy Ben
jamin, starting from his 24-yard
line, completed two passes,
the first an 18-yarder to Ted
Pappas on the sidelines, the
second, a 42-yard connection
to Brad Williams, who barely
slithered out of bounds to stop
the clock with two seconds
remaining. That's when Mike
Langford came on to boot a
50-yard tield goal to give Stan
lord the victory — and the
glory.
"I'll always remember the
way the Gal fans turned back
toward their seats as the Stan
ford fans came running out
onto the field.
"1 he reason the game was so
exciting was because no matter
how good a kicker Langford
was, no matter how far he

kicked them in practice, no
matter what, the chances were
against it, and he did it."
Klein loves to see a good
contest, and the real cliffhan
gers have been his favorites,
"as long as Stanford comes out
ahead."
Associate Athletic Director
Gary Cavalli agrees that the
1974 Big Game was the most
exciting. He recalls vividly the
tinal few seconds. "40 percent
of the 80,000 fans in the
stadium were yelling tor
Langford to make it, and the
other 60 percent were yelling
for him to miss. But he put it
right through. Up in the press
box, the Berkeley athletic staff
nearly fell out of their chairs!"
But lor Cavalli "most excit
ing" does not necessarily imply
"favorite." "My favorite games
have been the ones when we
really kicked them all over the
tield like in the last two years."
He was referring to the 1977
and 1978 Big Games, in which
Stanford defeated Gal 21 - i and
30-10.
for former Stanford head
coach lack Christiansen, the
most thrilling and most
memorable Big Game was in
1976, Christiansen's last game
as a Stanford coach.
"I had been fired on the Fri
day before the game, and this
made the game very important
to me." A fumble recovery by
Duncan McColl on the Gal
two-yard line with two and
one-half minutes left in the
game set up the touchdown
that put Stanford in the front to
stay, 27-24.
Christiansen, now an assis
tant coach tor the Seattle Sea
hawks, was involved in nine
Big Games, first as an assistant
and later as head coach. The
1976 Big Came was the most
important to him.
"I was very happy for the
players. There had been a lot of
controversy and criticism
which had detracted from their

performance during the rest of
the year. That win was great for
all of us."
Former Stanford quarter
back |im Plunkett remembers
the Big Came of 1969 as his
favorite. Stanford won that one
29-28, thanks to Plunkett, who
engineered an 80-yard scoring
drive in the final quarter to give

the Indians (that's right, In
dians) the win.
"I remember that drive in
particular, because instead of
our usual passing, we ran the
ball very well and were able to
march the length of the field
mostly on the ground."
Plunkett's passing was also
impressive during that game,
as he hit on 22 of 42 attempts
for 381 yards, including two
scoring bombs of 47 and 72
yards to Howie Williams and

Jack Lalaster.
Stanford's head coach that
year was John Ralston, who has
enjoyed all of his Big Games.
"I spent time at 1b Big Games
. . . , and they were all out
standing. There is no way to
single out any one of them as
the best. There were no routs;
some games were-won by a
considerable margin, but they
were always exciting right to
the last minute."
Ralston was head coach at

Stanford from 1964 to 1972,
after both playing and coach
ing at Cal. He led Stanford to
Rose Bowl victories in 1971 and
1972.
There have been many other
thrilling Big Games in Stanford
history. Former Stanford Athle
tic Director John Liebendorfer
still remembers very clearly the
20-20 tie with Cal in 1924.
What's so exciting about a
20-20 tie?
"Well, it was only a ball game
for five minutes. Cal was up
20-6 with just five minutes left
when Murray Cuddeback and
his teammates got going."
Cuddeback led Stanford to
two touchdowns in those clos
ing minutes to eek out the
20-20 standoff and give Stan
ford the conference title.
Liebendorfer, who has wit
nessed between 50 and 55 Big
Games so far, also pointed out
the 1947 Big Game, which Stan
ford lost 21-1B in the closing
minutes to a Cal team who was
favored by 40 points.
Different games bring back
great memories and yield diffe
rent opinions, but all share in
common the thrill and excite
ment of the Big Game.
