# The
						Big one got away: Cal nips Stanford, 21-14

### Chris Haft 
For Stanford, the football
field was a yard too long. To
California, however, it looked
— and was — just right.
Surviving an officials' tem
porarily blown call and a near
inexorable, last-chance Cardi
nal drive, the Golden Bears
outlasted Stanford, 21-14, in
the 82nd Big Came Saturday at
Stanford Stadium.
The outcome prevented the
Cards, 5-5-1, from achieving a
winning record, tne first time
in 12 years they have failed to
do so. In the Pacific-10 Confer
ence, Stanford ended at 3-3-1.
Cal finished the 1979 season
with a similarly unimpressive
6-5 overall mark, but gained
the extreme satisfaction that
comes with winning the annual
November classic.
"It's the greatest win I've
ever been involved with," Cal
head coach Roger Theder said.
It was the quintessential Big
Game, featuring constant ex
citement and a procession of
outstanding plays.
It also defined the word
"climax" accurately. The most
intense moments, those which
enabled the Bears to snap the
chains of dominance Stanford

had bound them in lor three
years, came in the final quar
ter.
Less than eight minutes re
mained when Cal quarterback
Rich Campbell dropped back
to pass on second-and-11 from
Stanford's 17-yard line with the
score tied 14-14.
Earlier, Campbell had led the
Bears within scoring range on
three occasions, only to be
thwarted each time by a missed
field goal, Rick Parker's goal
line interception and running
back Tyran Wright's fumble.
This time the strong-armed
Campbell hurled one of his
characteristic lightning bolts
toward tight end )oe Rose, who
was cutting across the base of
the end zone.
With 7:49 lett, Rose made a
fine leaping catch, his feet
striking the two-foot wide area
between the end line and the
large white-colored section of
the end zone as he came down.
A touchdown, obviously —
but not so in back judge John
Barger's eyes.
Initially believing that the
white area defined the end
zone, Barger ruled that Rose
caught the ball past the end
line.

"I was shattered," Rose said.
"I couldn't believe it. After I
caught the ball I watched my
feet to make sure they dragged
in."
During Cal's subsequent
time out, Barger realized the
error of his ways and made the
correct decision, signaling
"touchdown."
"I was straddling the back
line of the end zone, I thought,
and when I saw his (Rose's)
foot hit out of the white of the
end zone, I thought it was past
the end line," Barger said.
"But once I turned around
and noticed that there was
another back line of the end
zone, I realized I couldn't let it
(the call) go," Barger con
tinued. "I reversed my deci
sion. That's it."
After Barger changed his
mind, Stanford head coach
Rod Dowhower asked him tor a
piece of it.
"He (Barger) said he got con
fused, he didn't know where
the line was and that his mind
suddenly seemed to clear,"
Dowhower said with a slight
sarcastic tone.
Beneath all the contusion lay
irony — Campbell wasn't even
