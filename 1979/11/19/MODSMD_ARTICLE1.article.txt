# The 						Big one got away: Cal nips Stanford, 21-14
## 
### Chris Haft 
For Stanford, the football
field was a yard too long. To
California, however, it looked
— and was — just right.
Surviving an officials' tem
porarily blown call and a near
inexorable, last-chance Cardi
nal drive, the Golden Bears
outlasted Stanford, 21-14, in
the 82nd Big Came Saturday at
Stanford Stadium.
The outcome prevented the
Cards, 5-5-1, from achieving a
winning record, tne first time
in 12 years they have failed to
do so. In the Pacific-10 Confer
ence, Stanford ended at 3-3-1.
Cal finished the 1979 season
with a similarly unimpressive
6-5 overall mark, but gained
the extreme satisfaction that
comes with winning the annual
November classic.
"It's the greatest win I've
ever been involved with," Cal
head coach Roger Theder said.
It was the quintessential Big
Game, featuring constant ex
citement and a procession of
outstanding plays.
It also defined the word
"climax" accurately. The most
intense moments, those which
enabled the Bears to snap the
chains of dominance Stanford

had bound them in lor three
years, came in the final quar
ter.
Less than eight minutes re
mained when Cal quarterback
Rich Campbell dropped back
to pass on second-and-11 from
Stanford's 17-yard line with the
score tied 14-14.
Earlier, Campbell had led the
Bears within scoring range on
three occasions, only to be
thwarted each time by a missed
field goal, Rick Parker's goal
line interception and running
back Tyran Wright's fumble.
This time the strong-armed
Campbell hurled one of his
characteristic lightning bolts
toward tight end )oe Rose, who
was cutting across the base of
the end zone.
With 7:49 lett, Rose made a
fine leaping catch, his feet
striking the two-foot wide area
between the end line and the
large white-colored section of
the end zone as he came down.
A touchdown, obviously —
but not so in back judge John
Barger's eyes.
Initially believing that the
white area defined the end
zone, Barger ruled that Rose
caught the ball past the end
line.

"I was shattered," Rose said.
"I couldn't believe it. After I
caught the ball I watched my
feet to make sure they dragged
in."
During Cal's subsequent
time out, Barger realized the
error of his ways and made the
correct decision, signaling
"touchdown."
"I was straddling the back
line of the end zone, I thought,
and when I saw his (Rose's)
foot hit out of the white of the
end zone, I thought it was past
the end line," Barger said.
"But once I turned around
and noticed that there was
another back line of the end
zone, I realized I couldn't let it
(the call) go," Barger con
tinued. "I reversed my deci
sion. That's it."
After Barger changed his
mind, Stanford head coach
Rod Dowhower asked him tor a
piece of it.
"He (Barger) said he got con
fused, he didn't know where
the line was and that his mind
suddenly seemed to clear,"
Dowhower said with a slight
sarcastic tone.
Beneath all the contusion lay
irony — Campbell wasn't even

trying to complete the pass to
Rose.
"I was intending to throw it
away," Campbell said.
Final drive
Not intending to throw their
tinal chance at victory away,
the Cards began their tinal of
fensive series of the season
trom their own 20 after Cal's
kickoff.
A 15-yard defensive holding
penalty gave the Cards a first
down on their own 35 and
enough impetus to convert
three consecutive fourth
down plays.
The hub of this force was
quarterback Turk Schonert.
Schonert, brilliant in his
tarewell Stanford perfor
mance, plunged tor two yards
on tourth-and-inches from
Stantord's 44, completed a 14-
yard pass to Andre Tyler over
the middle on tourth-and-four
at Cal's 36 and dumped a six
yarder to Mike Dotterer on
tourth-and-two at the Bear 14.
With tirst-and-goal at the 8,
Schonert threw incomplete to
Ken Margerum and Tyler.
On third down Schonert was
attacked by a heavy Bear blitz
that appeared destined to
bring him down for a loss.
Vet through shrewd taking
and just plain guts, Schonert
escaped Cal's maulers and
scrambled to the 1.
"I thought I was going to get

into the end zone," Schonert
said later. He tumbled on the
play, but guard Paul Hibler
alertly recovered tor the Cards.
None ot the85,577 watching,
however, could recover trom
the delirium ot the moment.
They stood and screamed as
Schonert and the Cards lined
up tor their tinal play with 40
seconds to go.
Schonert retreated, scram
bled foran instant and fired the
ball on a low line to Dotterer.
But Bear safety Ron Coccimig
lio batted the pass and Stan
tord's last hopes away.
Analysis
Schonert was actually look
ing tor tight end Pat Bowe, the
primary receiver, in the right
corner of the end zone.
Dotterer, however, erred by
running his pattern into the
right side instead ot the left.
This mistake caused a
linebacker to pick up Bowe,
lorcing Schonert to try to hit
Dotterer.
"Mike went the wrong way,
but I don't think that affected
the play at all," Schonert said,
answering questions while
drinking a Coors and leaning
against a white Camaro in the
stadium parking lot.
"My lirst responsibility was
(to watch for) the pass," Coc
cimiglio said. "The guy (Bowe)
just shuffled away, the
halfback (Dotterer) came
through him to the end zone —

where I was — and I saw
Schonert scrambling.
"The pass was right to him,"
Coccimiglio went on. "I'm
grateful I was where I was."
Card stars
Despite the loss, Stanford
also had to be grateful for
fifth-year seniors Schonert and
defensive tackle Chuck Evans.
Schonert, who said last week
that he wanted to "go out in
style," did just that, complet
ing 22 of 32 passes tor 222 yards
and two touchdowns.
Barring phenomenal feats by
the nation's other quarter
backs in the tew remaining
regular-season games,
Schonert will win the NCAA
passing championship, the
third year in a row that a Stan
tord quarterback has captured
the national crown (Guy Ben
jamin in 1977 and Steve Dils in
1978 were the previous lead
ers).
"I thought there were some
outstanding efforts today,
especially Turk Schonert's,"
Dowhower said. "Time just ran
out on us, but I thought Turk
had a remarkable game. He's
one heck of a battler."
"He was the hardest quar
terback to tackle that we've
faced all year," Cal defensive
tackle Kirk Karacozoff said of
Schonert. "He has great de
sire."
The same could be said of
Evans, who finished with 10

tackles, eight unassisted. His
efforts were mainly responsi
ble for the paltry 33 yards rush
ing the Bears gained in the sec
ond half.
"I'd say 'awesome,' " Bear
running back Paul )ones re
plied when asked how he
would describe Evans. "I
thought he knew our plays for
a while."
Two quick TDs
Before Evans gained his
power of intuition, however,
Cal struck for two quick first
quarter touchdowns.
Campbell wasted little time
in displaying his arm's magic
powers, connecting with wide
receiver Greg Woodard for 53
yards on Cal's second play
from scrimmage for a first
down on Stantord's 31.
Then |ones, who runs slowly
but steadily like mercury rising
in a thermometer, churned up
the middle for 19 of his game
high 92 yards.
Three plays later Campbell
barely eluded a pursuing Evans
and hit Rose tor 23 yards and
Cal's first score.
On Cal's next possession
Campbell, who nosed out
Schonert tor the Pacific-10
Conference single-season
completion percentage record
(.671 on 216-of-322 to
Schonert's .670 on 148-of 221),
launched a 28-yard ground
to-air missile to Woodard that

lengthened the Bear lead to
14-0 with five minutes left in
the opening period.
Cards tie it
Needing a score, the Cards
halved Cal's lead on the follow
ing series, driving 79 yards on
13 plays.
Margerum's 11-yard run
down the sideline on a
double-reverse, Dotterer's
fine 10-yard catch and Bowe's
17-yard reception were the big
plays on the drive that culmi
nated in Schonert's 17-yard
pass to Vincent White down
the middle.
Safety Steve Foley's inter
ception of a strangely-thrown
Campbell pass early in the
third quarter gave the Cards
mouth-watering field position
on the Bear 32.
From there Stanford quickly
and painlessly tied the score.
Schonert's nine-yard pass to
Margerum and five-yard run
made it first down on Cal's 18.
Two plays later Schonert
played ring-around-the-rosy
with the Bear defenders, sides
tepping the blitzing Bears be
fore throwing across his body
to Tyler for 16 yards and the
Cards' last touchdown of 1979.
Vet the Cards couldn't stop
here. They still had to begin
their aborted fourth-quarter
drive that summed up their
season all too well: grand and
exciting, but in the end, trus
tratine.
