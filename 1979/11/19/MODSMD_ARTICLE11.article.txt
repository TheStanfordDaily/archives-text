Qualified women should not
be disturbed at being selected
for a position on the basis of
their sex, according to former
Assistant Attorney General
Barbara Babcock.
At a recent speech in Terman
Auditorium, Babcock told a
mostly female audience "not

to be bothered if you are cho
sen for a position because you
are a woman as well as qual
ified. It never bothered me.
"It's not how you get the job,
it's how you do it that counts,"
she maintained.
Babcock, currently a profes
sor at the law school here,
praised the efforts of the wo

men's movement and credited
her 1977 Justice Department
appointment to the move
ment.
"It was entirely because of
the women's movement that I
got this job (as assistant attor
ney general)," she said.
According to Babcock, sev
eral women's organizations
compiled a list of women as
possibilities for presidential
appointments. Babcock's
name was on this list and she
was selected for the judicial
position.
"If someone asks me 'how
do you feel about getting the
job because you are a woman,'
I answer it's a hell of a lot better
than not getting the job be
cause you are a woman," said
Babcock.
The 1963 graduate of Vale law
school said she believes
women in powerful positions
should take responsibility for
women coming after them.
"When actions on policies
are being formulated I will ask
'how will this affect women?'
Women will never get any
where unless we, as women,
will take responsibility for each
other," she said.
She added that successful
women should continue to
work with women's groups.

"I am very distressed when
women who have made it seek
to disassociate themselves
with the women's movement."
The one-time clerk with the
U.S. Court of Appeals noted
the differences between in
fluential women's actions
among working partners and
these women's actions in the
world outside the office.
"In the office I observe a sort
of maternal instinct in women
in power, an impulse to
smooth things over, a sensitiv
ity to feelings," said Babcock.
On the other hand, in deal
ing with the world outside her
own work group, she said,
"There is a fundamental fear of
meeting stereotypical versions
of women in power. To be
judged well, a woman must be
or pretend to be cool, calm and
in total possession of the facts,
not the feelings."
Babcock concluded her
speech by saying that men and
women "should press forward
to the time when leaders are
chosen on the basis of their
capabilities, regardless of their
sex."

Babcock's speech is one of a
