# Students used in experiments here

While many students worry
about finding jobs in this time
of shortages, the market for
psychology research subjects
is wide open.
According to Psychology
Teaching Assistant David
Johnson, the 67 experiments,
being carried out this quarter
require from 30-200 subjects
each, and the demand is being
met by students in search of
excitement, units and money.
"I love the drama of it," said
Mary Fitch, a Psychology I
proctor. "I keep thinking of
Zimbardo's prison experiment
and I keep waiting for them to
take me down to the base
ment."
Psychology experiments
vary widely, covering topics
from shyness and learned
helplessness to capital
punishment. Methods of ex
perimentation also vary
widely, from simple question
naires to games and simula
tions to hooking subjects up to
machines.
"Sometimes people aren't
really concerned much about
whether what we're doing is
ethical or not," said Johnson
"They're more concerned
about whether or not it's going
to be fun."
Bob de Costa recalls being
asked "to take an oath not to
tell anyone on campus what
the experiment was about."
"You tend to think of psych
experiments as something re
ally neat â€” that you'll get to eat
food or sleep," said Sopho
more Colleen Dunn. "But it's
not like that."
"The written ones were basi
cally very boring," said Psych 1
student Michelle Tan. "For one
of the experiments they just
told you what to do and you got
a one-sentence explanation. It
would be interesting if they let
you know the results. I mean,
you have a right to know.
"In Psych 1, you learn about
all these weird concepts, so
you're always thinking, 'Why
did I do that and what do they
want to know?' " she said.
"It's fun to guess," she ad

ded.
"Sometimes they certainly
do give us the answers they
think we want and that's the
worst problem,'' said Johnson.
"From what I notice, that hap
penswhen people have read in
the textbooks about a similar
experiment."
The experimenters try to
counteract this by asking ques
tions once negatively and once
positively, by including ir
relevant questions to throw
people off track, and by com
paring their results with those
from a control sample, he said.
Dunn and Fitch said they
would never deliberately ruin
an experiment, although they
said it's hard not to try to psych
out an experiment.
"You think to yourself, they
want to see if I'm a wishy
washy person, so I'm going to
stick to my guns," said Fitch.
"There's just a certain
amount of the 'we-they' sort of
thing," said Dunn. "The waiver
tells you what the experiment
will be about, but you don't
know if it's true."
"They don't tell you the truth
at the beginning," said Tan.
"But it's supposed to have
some psychological effects, so
at the end of it you have to be
debriefed."
Experiments must be ap
proved by the Human Subjects
Committee to ensure that
"people won't be turned to
vegetables," said Johnson.
"They want to know exactly
what will be done and why," he
said.
Subjects also sign forms that
inform them of their right to
drop out of any experiment if

they are unwilling to do any
thing.
Guidelines of the Depart
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare must also be met in
order to get funding for exper
iments. The revised draft of the
guidelines, which is now under
study, extends protection of
rights to all human subjects,
living or dead, said Johnson,
and makes it more difficult to
do research with human sub
jects.
"Experiments can change
the course of people's lives,"
said Johnson. "You run the risk
of telling people something it
would have been better for
them not to have found out."
For example, some experi
ments show how little control a
person has over himself."
Subjects from the Psychol
ogy I class presently ac
count for 5000 hours of re
search, said Johnson. Each
student has the option of par
ticipating in five experiments
or doing a term paper.
Students sign lists posted in
the Psychology department to
volunteer for the experiments.
If a special sample is needed,
researchers use question
naires completed by the stu
dents to pick out subjects. For
example, some experiments
require subjects who are de
pressed or who are susceptible
to hypnotism.

Not all students enjoyed
volunteering.
"They're boring. I did it for
the money," said Mary Ann
Baumgaertner.
According to Johnson,
Psychology I students are
strongly encouraged to volun
teer because funding is li
mited. Often, graduate stu
dents in psychology do re
search for faculty members
with grants, or, they come with
funding from outside sources
such as the Ford Foundation.
Subjects are usually paid
minimum hourly wages.
"Its a good way to make
money and it's interesting,"
said Dunn. "You can see the
kinds of things people are re
searching."
"Being in an experiment
brings you closer to the
psychology experience," said
Chestgon McFarland. "You're
not just reading about them;
you're in them."
"You're a statistic," Baum
gaertner concluded.
