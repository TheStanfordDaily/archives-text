# Daily stains Bears in Ink Bowl
## 
### 
Although the Cards surrendered a tear
jerking Big Came to our foes from the across
the Bay, all was not lost Saturday. Preceding
the stadium debacle, stalwart' Daily staffers
upheld a trace ot Stanford dignity by trounc
ing Daily Californian copy boys, 7-0, in the
time-honored Ink Bowl.
Somewhat debilitated by the Wilbur Field
quagmire and jarred by the "below-the-belt"
tactics of their opponents, Dailyites nonethe
less dominated the competition. "The
Weenies were as bankrupt on the gridiron as
they are in their financial affairs," com
mented one knowledgeable observer.
Encouraged by the supreme efforts of a
stellar Card defensive unit, quarterback
Chris Haft rolled out left and slyly streaked
for a 20-yard touchdown run in the contest's
lone score midway through the first half. "It
worked because even we didn't know what
was happening," admitted back-up quarter
back and halfback Bill Burger later in a rare
show of humility.
A well-maneuvered, over-the-middle pass
from Haft to Burger for the successful con
version propelled the Daily contingent to an
overwhelming lead.
The explosive driving force behind the
Stanford display of exploitation was in the
hands of James Higa, the leading receiver
,both offensively and defensively. FHiga snag

ged three floating interceptions from the
outstretched hands of uncoordinated Oskie
supporters, as well as countless Haft bullets.
Mikey Charlson, instigator of the fear
some Daily rush, revealed an amazing lust for
pure violence and a perverse sense of justice.
Charlson, offensive by nature but defensive
by position, sparked the game's only con
troversy in a vain quest for individual glory at
his team's expense. After "Magnet-man"
Higa snatched yet another wayward Cal pass,
the traitorous Charlson falsely claimed to
have downed the Weenie quarterback be
fore his release. The Bears were then wrongly
awarded repossession but were narrowly
thwarted by an invigorated Cardinal defense.
Distracted by noises emerging from
the Bear bench, the Daily failed to score
throughout the second half. The outcome
was, however, already determined.
Other Daily offensive outcasts were Uncle
Spiro, nimble Sam Howe with one dazzling
reception, master tactician Rob Ericson,
hobbling pass receiver Dianne Cahoon and
winged-footed Fred Yen. Defensive beefs in
cluded cornerback Rob Lempert, star Robert
Reed, logging one steal, steadfast Robert
Stone, Vic "the might of the Irish" Coetz and
intimidating Joan O'Connell.
In an act of magnanimity, the Cal short
enders traded "Do it daily" clickers for liquid
refreshments following the action.
