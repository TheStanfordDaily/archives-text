## Editorial No more closed meetings 
### 
The closing of the ASSU
Senate meeting to the press
and public Wednesday
night was an inappropriate
response to a non-existent
problem.
Fearing that the senate
chair candidates' good
names would be dragged
through the mud during
debate, Acting Chair
George Drysdale, with the
full support of the senate
and COP member Tom
Gart, ejected Daily and
KZSU reporters and the few
members of the audience.
The action was in clear
violation of the ASSU
bylaws which state that "All
Senate meetings shall be
open to the public unless it
is decided by a two-thirds
vote of the Senate at the
previous meeting that a par
ticular meeting be closed."
The senate took no such
action previous to Wed
nesday's meeting and it dis
tresses us that none of the
20 senators, the acting chair
or the lone COP member
knew the bylaws of their
own organization well
enough to stop the gross
violation.
The closure of the an
nounced open meeting is
also contrary to the Univer
sity's policy on open meet
ings which states that no
meeting advertised as open
to the public shall be
closed.
This incident is over. But
the attitude of some
senators concerning the
general issue of closed
meetings to the public is, in

our opinion, wrong and po
tentially dangerous.
The chair is elected by the
senate. Such a procedure is
inherently political and the
closed discussion and vote
on Wednesday smells of
smoke-filled back-room
politics. We don't mean to
insinuate that Mark Breier's
election is in any way
tainted; he is a qualified
person to hold the position.
But nothing could have
prevented the selection of a
chair from being based on
any criteria — from a bribe
to the length of a candi
date's hair. And because
the meeting was closed to
the press, the public now
has no means of learning
how the selection was made
or how each senator voted.
Each candidate running
for the senate chair was
knowingly running for a
political position. To expect
to have the political debate
surrounding such an elec
tion held in private is naive.
To run for an elected posi
tion carries the implicit un
derstanding that the debate
shall be free and public.
And with the fear of hav
ing one's name mentioned
in a negative context comes
also the assurance that the
debate will be open and fair
with a guaranteed chance to
respond in public to any
charges made by another
candidate or senate inter
viewer. Such is politics.
If the senate wants to
continue to use its current
chair selection process, we
strongly urge it to realize

the implications of barring
the public from the selec
tion process of such an inf
luential position. If, as
some senators believe, the
chair should be a non
political post, the selection
process should be made
non-political, possibly by
COP appointment with se
nate confirmation or what
ever other means the se
nate chooses.
But clearly, the campus
should not have to allow its
elected representatives to
decide important issues in
closed meetings. The cam
pus has the right to know
how each senator votes. We
did not elect a closed cau
cusing group last month.
We elected a representative
body that is obligated to put
its individual and group ac
tions and opinions on the
table for its constituency to
see, hear and debate.
We suggest that if the se
nate ever needs to discuss a
particular, non-political
issue — such as a personnel
matter — that it write a pro
vision into its bylaws for an
executive session which
would take place before,
during, or after a regularly
scheduled meeting. City
councils and school boards
nationwide regularly call
legitimate executive ses
sions.
But political functions
should be carried out in
public and on the record.
That is the responsibility
which comes with being
elected to the senate or any
political body.

see, hear and debate.
We suggest that if the se
nate ever needs to discuss a
particular, non-political
issue — such as a personnel
matter — that it write a pro
vision into its bylaws for an
executive session which
would take place before,
during, or after a regularly
scheduled meeting. City
councils and school boards
nationwide regularly call
legitimate executive ses
sions.
But political functions
should be carried out in
public and on the record.
That is the responsibility
which comes with being
elected to the senate or any
political body.
The closing of the ASSU
Senate meeting to the press
and public Wednesday
night was an inappropriate
response to a non-existent
problem.
Fearing that the senate
chair candidates' good
names would be dragged
through the mud during
debate, Acting Chair
George Drysdale, with the
full support of the senate
and COP member Tom
Gart, ejected Daily and
KZSU reporters and the few
members of the audience.
The action was in clear
violation of the ASSU
bylaws which state that "All
Senate meetings shall be
open to the public unless it
is decided by a two-thirds
vote of the Senate at the
previous meeting that a par
ticular meeting be closed."
The senate took no such
action previous to Wed
nesday's meeting and it dis
tresses us that none of the
20 senators, the acting chair
or the lone COP member
knew the bylaws of their
own organization well
enough to stop the gross
violation.
The closure of the an
nounced open meeting is
also contrary to the Univer
sity's policy on open meet
ings which states that no
meeting advertised as open
to the public shall be
closed.
This incident is over. But
the attitude of some
senators concerning the
general issue of closed
meetings to the public is, in

our opinion, wrong and po
tentially dangerous.
The chair is elected by the
senate. Such a procedure is
inherently political and the
closed discussion and vote
on Wednesday smells of
smoke-filled back-room
politics. We don't mean to
insinuate that Mark Breier's
election is in any way
tainted; he is a qualified
person to hold the position.
But nothing could have
prevented the selection of a
chair from being based on
any criteria — from a bribe
to the length of a candi
date's hair. And because
the meeting was closed to
the press, the public now
has no means of learning
how the selection was made
or how each senator voted.
Each candidate running
for the senate chair was
knowingly running for a
political position. To expect
to have the political debate
surrounding such an elec
tion held in private is naive.
To run for an elected posi
tion carries the implicit un
derstanding that the debate
shall be free and public.
And with the fear of hav
ing one's name mentioned
in a negative context comes
also the assurance that the
debate will be open and fair
with a guaranteed chance to
respond in public to any
charges made by another
candidate or senate inter
viewer. Such is politics.
If the senate wants to
continue to use its current
chair selection process, we
strongly urge it to realize

the implications of barring
the public from the selec
tion process of such an inf
luential position. If, as
some senators believe, the
chair should be a non
political post, the selection
process should be made
non-political, possibly by
COP appointment with se
nate confirmation or what
ever other means the se
nate chooses.
But clearly, the campus
should not have to allow its
elected representatives to
decide important issues in
closed meetings. The cam
pus has the right to know
how each senator votes. We
did not elect a closed cau
cusing group last month.
We elected a representative
body that is obligated to put
its individual and group ac
tions and opinions on the
table for its constituency to
see, hear and debate.
We suggest that if the se
nate ever needs to discuss a
particular, non-political
issue — such as a personnel
matter — that it write a pro
vision into its bylaws for an
executive session which
would take place before,
during, or after a regularly
scheduled meeting. City
councils and school boards
nationwide regularly call
legitimate executive ses
sions.
But political functions
should be carried out in
public and on the record.
That is the responsibility
which comes with being
elected to the senate or any
political body.
