## Society depends on law, order 
### 
Scott Olmstead's column of
Nov. 14 contained two major
flaws. First, he would have us
believe that "in the absence of
centralized authority, a spon
taneous order arises, an order
which is not the product of any
single mind, and yet efficiently
accomplishes social goals,
often without that being the in
tent of the participants." That
sounds simple enough, but is it
really true?
Olmstead offered no histori
cal examples Perhaps because
there are none; or perhaps be
cause history substantiates the
antithesis of this theory — that
is, a lack of central authority
does result in chaos, and that
unfettered individualism does
not necessarily result in social
benefits. A look at the late
1700 sand early 1800s will, I
think, dramatically show this.
The reigning economic doc
trineof that time — laissez faire
— bears a direct resemblance
to Olmstead's "spontaneous
order" theory. It was believed
that, without the intrusion of
government regulation
(Olmstead would call it cen

tralized coercion), an "invisi
ble hand" arises to guide the
capitalist system. This unseen
force makes sure that individu
als, in their efforts to increase
just their own lot, will unwit
tingly yet inevitably also in
crease the lot of society as well.
The crucial point is that this
beautiful order will occur only
if individuals are completely
free to do as they please. Coer
cion of any kind simply dis
rupts the economic processes,
to the detriment of the indi
vidual and society.
So what were the results of
laissez faire policy? Did society
as a whole really benefit from
unrestricted individualism? I
think not.
By the 1830s, after only 50
years of laissez faire, inequity
and hardship flourished as it
had never flourished before.
While factory and mine owners
lived in opulent luxury, the
workers lived in abject pov
erty. Their living quarters were
overcrowded, run-down and
filthy. The working conditions
were virtually unbearable and
the wages virtually nonexis

tent. Men, women and chil
dren alike toiled for up to 16
hours a day just to make
enough to subsist.
So, as the above example il
lustrates, harmony and in
creased social welfare do not
naturally result from a lack of
centralized coercion. Rather, if
individuals are left to their own
devices, a minority will indeed
reap huge benefits, but only at
the expense of the majority.
Olmstead's second flaw lay
in his so-called "law of reverse
results" which states that
"when coercion or force is
used in an attempt to produce
social benefits, the results are
the opposite of what is in
tended, or side effects worse
than the original problem are
created."
In other words, all forms of
centralized coercion must
necessarily fail. To back up this
sweeping claim, he cites as
examples the failures of the
War on Poverty, the Vietnam
War, and compulsory educa
tion, among others.
Olmstead falls into the
tempting trap here of trying to

explain too much with too lit
tle. His "law" sounds very
clean and compact, but does it
really do justice to the com
plexity of the subjects that it
attempts to analyze?
Again, I think not. Certainly
the fact that coercion had to be
used has something to do with
a given policy's failure; but it
does not, by definition, doom
that policy to failure.
The underlying assumption
of Olmstead's whole argument
is that human beings are basi
cally good; so good, in fact,
that regulations are not
needed for us to lead peaceful,
happy lives. Well, maybe we
are good. But even so, we still
need laws i.e. centralized
coercions, to guide us. A sim
ple analogy will, I hope, de
monstrate my point.
Take as given that all the
drivers in the world are highly
skilled, alert, sober and be
nevolent — always ready to
yield the right of way.
Wouldn't we still need traffic
lights?

hours a day just to make
enough to subsist.
So, as the above example il
lustrates, harmony and in
creased social welfare do not
naturally result from a lack of
centralized coercion. Rather, if
individuals are left to their own
devices, a minority will indeed
reap huge benefits, but only at
the expense of the majority.
Olmstead's second flaw lay
in his so-called "law of reverse
results" which states that
"when coercion or force is
used in an attempt to produce
social benefits, the results are
the opposite of what is in
tended, or side effects worse
than the original problem are
created."
In other words, all forms of
centralized coercion must
necessarily fail. To back up this
sweeping claim, he cites as
examples the failures of the
War on Poverty, the Vietnam
War, and compulsory educa
tion, among others.
Olmstead falls into the
tempting trap here of trying to

explain too much with too lit
tle. His "law" sounds very
clean and compact, but does it
really do justice to the com
plexity of the subjects that it
attempts to analyze?
Again, I think not. Certainly
the fact that coercion had to be
used has something to do with
a given policy's failure; but it
does not, by definition, doom
that policy to failure.
The underlying assumption
of Olmstead's whole argument
is that human beings are basi
cally good; so good, in fact,
that regulations are not
needed for us to lead peaceful,
happy lives. Well, maybe we
are good. But even so, we still
need laws i.e. centralized
coercions, to guide us. A sim
ple analogy will, I hope, de
monstrate my point.
Take as given that all the
drivers in the world are highly
skilled, alert, sober and be
nevolent — always ready to
yield the right of way.
Wouldn't we still need traffic
lights?

Scott Olmstead's column of
Nov. 14 contained two major
flaws. First, he would have us
believe that "in the absence of
centralized authority, a spon
taneous order arises, an order
which is not the product of any
single mind, and yet efficiently
accomplishes social goals,
often without that being the in
tent of the participants." That
sounds simple enough, but is it
really true?
Olmstead offered no histori
cal examples Perhaps because
there are none; or perhaps be
cause history substantiates the
antithesis of this theory — that
is, a lack of central authority
does result in chaos, and that
unfettered individualism does
not necessarily result in social
benefits. A look at the late
1700 sand early 1800s will, I
think, dramatically show this.
The reigning economic doc
trineof that time — laissez faire
— bears a direct resemblance
to Olmstead's "spontaneous
order" theory. It was believed
that, without the intrusion of
government regulation
(Olmstead would call it cen

tralized coercion), an "invisi
ble hand" arises to guide the
capitalist system. This unseen
force makes sure that individu
als, in their efforts to increase
just their own lot, will unwit
tingly yet inevitably also in
crease the lot of society as well.
The crucial point is that this
beautiful order will occur only
if individuals are completely
free to do as they please. Coer
cion of any kind simply dis
rupts the economic processes,
to the detriment of the indi
vidual and society.
So what were the results of
laissez faire policy? Did society
as a whole really benefit from
unrestricted individualism? I
think not.
By the 1830s, after only 50
years of laissez faire, inequity
and hardship flourished as it
had never flourished before.
While factory and mine owners
lived in opulent luxury, the
workers lived in abject pov
erty. Their living quarters were
overcrowded, run-down and
filthy. The working conditions
were virtually unbearable and
the wages virtually nonexis

tent. Men, women and chil
dren alike toiled for up to 16
hours a day just to make
enough to subsist.
So, as the above example il
lustrates, harmony and in
creased social welfare do not
naturally result from a lack of
centralized coercion. Rather, if
individuals are left to their own
devices, a minority will indeed
reap huge benefits, but only at
the expense of the majority.
