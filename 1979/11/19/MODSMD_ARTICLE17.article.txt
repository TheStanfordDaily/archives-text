## Conquering the 'syndrome'

Editor's note: The following
was originally written as a direct
reply to Bill Kemmeries Oct. 19
column "Cure Early-date syn
drome."
Dear Mr. Kemmeries,
My apologies for the belated
response to your column on
the cures for the Early-Date
Syndrome. Since I am no
longer "studenting" I feel
guilty when I take the time to
sit down at a typewriter as op
posed to feeling guilty because
I do not.
I realize that you were moti
vated in part to write the col
umn out of a keen desire to
educate people against this
dreaded disease. However, as
an old hand at the one-night
stand from the female vantage
point, I must say that in theory
your ideas make more sense
than they may in practice.
I would never presume to
speak with any authority to
your suggestions to the guys. If
your male peers wish to go
berserk behind the wheel of a
car or pursue dramatics in their
dorm lounge, so be it.
I, however, can speak from

experience about your so cal
led cure tactics from the girls.
The Blunt Honesty Ap
roach: I have used this ap
proach several times with poor
results. The worst account was
a dinner date I had with a guy to
whom I felt unattracted. All
evening I tossed around in my
head the best way to handle
our inevitable departure. I fi
nally decided to give him my
tactful, but true, feelings.
"You're a nice guy, but I'm
not physically attracted to
you." I didn't even get a
chance to pull out my Aug. '72
issue of Sports Illustrated be
fore he got a pained look on his
face as if I had just kicked him
in the groin. Maybe I had. He
then turned on his heels and
stomped off.
The worst part of this came
the next day when he sent me a
bill for my half of the previous
evening. I figured out that I was
charged for half of the meal,
the tip and the gas (at $.15 a
mile). Is honesty always the
best policy?
Octopus Rumor: It should
have been added in your article

that the octopus rumor should
only be spread with the con
sent of the male involved.
There was, for example, the
tragic night I announced to the
girls in my dorm that Wilbur
Spinster was not the jellyfish
that he appeared to be, but was
actually an octopus with the
heart of a piranha. Wilbur
barely had a chance to come up
for air as a flood of some 20 or
so girls descended upon him.
Out every night, his grades
began to drop. He walked
around dazed, on the brink of
exhaustion. I had created a
monster. The ordeal finally
ended when Spinster was ar
rested for flashing in
downtown Spokane, Wash. I
carry the burden of that broken
man still!
I hope I have made my point.
There are no easy answers. I
admire your endeavor to com
bat this unfortunate situation
and I would meet you in the
bushes sometime, but the last
time I tried that I got poison
oak.
