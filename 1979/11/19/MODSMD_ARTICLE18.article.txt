## ASSU Senate blinded by the lights 
### 
It may be nice to see that our
new ASSU Senators are work
ing so busily, but I fear that
they are suffering from the
blindness of ambition. In the
rush to accomplish as much as
possible as soon as possible,
the senate passed a resolution
on Nov. 7 recommending that
the Athletic Department install
lighting for the Encina tennis
courts. In expressing this dim
viewpoint, the senate tailed to
recognize some important
considerations that are linked
to the lighting proposal. In so
doing, the senate failed to
grasp the larger context in
which the matter must be
examined; if you consider a
local situation — the inadequ
acy of campus pathway lighting
— and then a world-wide situa
tion — the soaring cost of
energy — just these two issues
cast a long shadow over the fu
ture of the tennis court lighting
project.
Locally, the tennis courts are
not the only battle-grounds
that remain unlit. Many people
must battle their fear — and
hopefully that is all — each
time they step out into the
blackened campus streets at
night. If this sounds exagger
ated or overly dramatic to you,
I suggest that you take a stroll

down Alvarado Row alone one
dark night — if you dare — and
then decide where you think
the University needs lighting
most.
My point is this: when the
senate recommends that the
tennis court lighting project be
considered a "top priority
measure" by the Athletic De
partment without having
raised the issue of safe street
lighting, consider how this re
flects upon the senate's sense
of priorities. I do not see a very
pleasant reflection.
In all fairness to the senate, I
should recognize that lighting
tennis courts and lighting
pathways are financially and
administratively independent
issues, and that the senate
should offer its recommenda
tion whenever any such matter
is brought to a decision, as is
now the case with the tennis
court lighting proposal.
However, the sena.te passed
up a golden opportunity to
push the street lighting issue to
the forefront of discussion,
and thus betrayed the more
general interests of Stanford
pedestrians for the sake of the
special interests of Stanford
tennis buffs.
More importantly, though,
the senate has simply made a

poor judgment by not fully
considering the implications of
its resolution.
First of all, tennis court lights
are not only expensive to in
stall, they are also very expen
sive to operate, both in terms
of anemic dollars and precious
watts.
Secondly, the Middle East
once more becoming a powder
keg that threatens to blow
away our primary source of
imported oil, each meager ef
fort to conserve energy gains
significance and each watt be
comes even more precious in
our daily lives.
We simply cannot afford to
squander our electricity on re
creational luxuries such as
lighting for nighttime tennis —
especially since the game is
easily and efficiently played in
the light of day!
The senate's resolution flies
in the tace of all our prudent
efforts to conserve energy. I
have hopes that Stanford will
emerge as a leader in our na
tion's struggle to exorcise the
demon of wasteful energy con
sumption. The senate certainly
has not raised my hopes by
playing the devil's advocate.
Sure, it would be nice to be
able to pick up a racquet at any

time of night and head for the
courts. However, we are enter
ing an era in which conserva
tion must rank above conveni
ence. We must examine our
everyday behavior and look
there for more efficient ways to
use our energy resources.
Ironically, we need not alter
our behavior in this regard if
we want to continue playing
tennis here; Stanford has
achieved top tennis ranking
without lighted courts. I'm
sure that the people in the
community will continue to
enjoy playing tennis, as they
have for so long, in the health
ful sunlight.
It would be terribly easy for
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
to approve the Encina tennis
court lighting and have it instal
led before political and
economic pressure vyould for
bid such extravagance. But
being a leader often means tak
ing an unpopular stand and
sacrificing short-term benefits
for long-term ones. Perhaps
Geiger will look beyond the
myopic perspective that limits
the ASSU Senate's outlook.
The vision of effective lead
ership is not tunnel vision.
