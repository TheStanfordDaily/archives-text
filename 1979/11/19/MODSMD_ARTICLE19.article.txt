## Feed the hungry in our own backyard 
### 
Hunger. The word hangs as
an issue, as a suddenly popular
concern in most of our minds.
We are extolled and cajoled to
give: of our money and of our
time to help alleviate it.
It takes an informed con
sciousness to hold both world
and domestic hunger in mind
(but it can be done). Hunger as
a world issue appears as a
popular cause because it has
definable, immediately gratifi
able, short-term goals. "The
people of Cambodia are starv

ing. You can help," we are told,
so we help because how could
we not help?
Hunger as a local domestic
issue often gets shunted aside
by the world hunger appeals
because issues of local hunger
are not so clear-cut and are
often jumbled up with feelings
of guilt, anger, racism and
helplessness. It is oftentimes
hard to believe that people
could seriously be hungry a
mile or two from where we
stand.
It's even more difficult to
know exactly what to do about
local hunger because placing
blame is such an integral part
of the way we traditionally
combat such a tragedy, and, in
our case, the blame would fall
right back on us: the govern
ment and the citizens of
America.
The Ecumenical Hunger
Program, a community based
organization that receives its
major funding from local
churches and synagogues and
private donors,- assists people
who are in need in this im
mediate East Palo Alto, East
Menlo Park, Palo Alto area.
We provide emergency food
for those who have a need be
cause of unforeseen cir
cumstances. We provide
supplementary food for those

who are repeatedly unable to
find enough money to spend
on food (i.e. those who are un
employed, underemployed or
who are on a fixed income).
We also provide donated clo
thing, furniture and appliances
for these individuals and
families.
These are hard times. On the
worldwide level these are
times of intense economic and
political upheaval. Everywhere
national priorities are shifting,
and America no longer enjoys
the status of being "most fa
vored nation." Unemployment
and inflation rise, and we ask
when will it end?
We are led to believe by the
media that this is a "crisis," a
temporary economic dilemma
that will somehow end and
we'll all get back to "normal."
But the economic realists are
saying that it won't end and
that we'll have to find new ways
of living: new peaceful order
ing of government spending
priorities.
The economy must shift to
accommodate human needs
and desires and to accept de
tente as the only workable in
ternational model for the
world of tomorrow.
Locally, this means that the
economy must permanently
accommodate these changes.

Old policies and systems no
longer work nor will they ever
work again. The economic
changes polarized our com
munity (i.e. the rich get richer
while the poor get poorer).
Food costs have risen 16 per
cent. Here on the Peninsula,
rents have risen 50-100 percent
or more in the last five years.
Food is often the only expend
able commodity. Malnutrition
becomes a way of life.
We see the creation of self
help projects as an inevitable
refinement of our program. It
is a statement that regardless of
who is to blame it is mandatory
that all citizens be provided
with a dignified opportunity to
rise out of despair. Initially we
are creating a community mar
ket project.
These projects will not only
provide badly needed services
but will also train youth and the
chronically underemployed in
skills that will enable everyone
to enjoy a more dignified and
productive environment.

Hunger. The word hangs as
an issue, as a suddenly popular
concern in most of our minds.
We are extolled and cajoled to
give: of our money and of our
time to help alleviate it.
It takes an informed con
sciousness to hold both world
and domestic hunger in mind
(but it can be done). Hunger as
a world issue appears as a
popular cause because it has
definable, immediately gratifi
able, short-term goals. "The
people of Cambodia are starv

ing. You can help," we are told,
so we help because how could
we not help?
Hunger as a local domestic
issue often gets shunted aside
by the world hunger appeals
because issues of local hunger
are not so clear-cut and are
often jumbled up with feelings
of guilt, anger, racism and
helplessness. It is oftentimes
hard to believe that people
could seriously be hungry a
mile or two from where we
stand.
It's even more difficult to
know exactly what to do about
local hunger because placing
blame is such an integral part
of the way we traditionally
combat such a tragedy, and, in
our case, the blame would fall
right back on us: the govern
ment and the citizens of
America.
The Ecumenical Hunger
Program, a community based
organization that receives its
major funding from local
churches and synagogues and
private donors,- assists people
who are in need in this im
mediate East Palo Alto, East
Menlo Park, Palo Alto area.
We provide emergency food
for those who have a need be
cause of unforeseen cir
cumstances. We provide
supplementary food for those

who are repeatedly unable to
find enough money to spend
on food (i.e. those who are un
employed, underemployed or
who are on a fixed income).
We also provide donated clo
thing, furniture and appliances
for these individuals and
families.
These are hard times. On the
worldwide level these are
times of intense economic and
political upheaval. Everywhere
national priorities are shifting,
and America no longer enjoys
the status of being "most fa
vored nation." Unemployment
and inflation rise, and we ask
when will it end?
We are led to believe by the
media that this is a "crisis," a
temporary economic dilemma
that will somehow end and
we'll all get back to "normal."
But the economic realists are
saying that it won't end and
that we'll have to find new ways
of living: new peaceful order
ing of government spending
priorities.
The economy must shift to
accommodate human needs
and desires and to accept de
tente as the only workable in
ternational model for the
world of tomorrow.
Locally, this means that the
economy must permanently
accommodate these changes.

Old policies and systems no
longer work nor will they ever
work again. The economic
changes polarized our com
munity (i.e. the rich get richer
while the poor get poorer).
Food costs have risen 16 per
cent. Here on the Peninsula,
rents have risen 50-100 percent
or more in the last five years.
Food is often the only expend
able commodity. Malnutrition
becomes a way of life.
We see the creation of self
help projects as an inevitable
refinement of our program. It
is a statement that regardless of
who is to blame it is mandatory
that all citizens be provided
with a dignified opportunity to
rise out of despair. Initially we
are creating a community mar
ket project.
These projects will not only
provide badly needed services
but will also train youth and the
chronically underemployed in
skills that will enable everyone
to enjoy a more dignified and
productive environment.
