### Associated Press 
Militants occupying Hie U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran relea&cff yXmeficaft
hostages early this morning, CBS
News reported. The militants said
yesterday they would release eight
black men and live women for de
portation by the Iranian Foreign
Ministry, Tehran radio said.
State Department spokesman Wal
ter Ramsey said in Washington U.S.
officials had not been informed of
the release ol any hostages but said,
"II it's true, it would of course be
very welcome information."
The CBS broadcast said the 13 were
taken to Tehran's Mehrabad Airport
and placed on a flight to an un
specified European destination. CBS
quoted an unconlirmed report they
were to be taken on a Swissair flight
to Zurich, Switzerland.
ABC-TV identified three ol the re
leased hostages as Marine Sgt. Wil
liam Quarles, of Washington D.C.,
Marine Sgt. Ladell Maples, 23, of
Farle, Ark., and Katherine Gross, 22,
of Cambridge Springs, Pa., a secret
ary in the economics division of the
embassy. They had appeared at an
embassy news conference Sunday
night.
The released hostages were the
first Americans treed from the em
bassy since Nov. 4 when the militants
seized the compound and b0 to 62
Americans, demanding the United
States return deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to stand
trial for his life.
The militants said unless the shah
is returned to Iran they would try the
others on charges they were spies. In
a late broadcast, Tehran radio re
ported the militants said they were
following the orders of revolutionary

leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
to investigate alleged espionage ac
tivities at'the embassy and to release
blacks and women who were ab
solved.
The militants said yesterday that
unless the shah is returned to Iran,
they would try the others on charges
that they had spied on Iran in the
course of their diplomatic duties.
The 13 hostages will be handed
over to the Foreign Ministry today
"so that immediate action for their
expulsion" might be taken, the
broadcast said, but gave no time
the handover.
Gross said the conditions under
which the hostages were being held
were "very good.
"We haven't had any problems,"
she said. "We've been fed more than
fairly. We've slept nights. There ha
ven't been any problems physically.
Maybe people have been mentally
upset, but other than that we haven't
had any problems."
At a morning news conference
conducted on the embassy grounds,
students told American and Iranian
reporters the chosen group of hos
tages would be released later in the
day. But ot the remainder, "those
who are spies" will tace trial, news
reports said, unless America sends
them Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
now in a New York hospital being
treated tor cancer.
NBC-TV interviewed Khomeini in
Qom, 100 miles south of Tehran, and
quoted him as saying the remaining
hostages would be sate as long as
there was a possibility the deposed
shah would be returned to Iran, but if
the United States would not send the
shah back to Iran, most ot the hos
tages would be tried and punished

under Islamic law.
"The diplomats ip any country are
supposed to do diplomatic work, not
the crimes of espionage," Khomeini
said, adding that those who commit
espionage "are no longer diplomats.
And this is what people have done
. . . a certain number of spies, and
should be, according to our laws,
tried and punished."
"As long as Mr. Carter does not
respect international laws, these
spies cannot be returned," but if the
shah is returned, the hostages would
be released as "a kind gesture on our
part," Khomeini said in the ABC in
terview.
Iran has no extradition treaty with
the United States. The White House
has said it will not send the shah to
Iran, and President |immy Carter
stopped American oil purchases
trom Iran and ordered a freeze on
