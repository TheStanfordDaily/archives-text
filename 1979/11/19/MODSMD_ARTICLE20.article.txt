## Send the Shah home 
### 
"The Shah was a poor
leader." So writes the Daily in
what must be the understate
ment of the decade. Let's face
it folks. The Shah isn't just a
nice guy who happened to be
in the wrong place at the wrong
time.
The Shah was installed in
Iran through our tax dollars,
armed with weapons you and I

paid for, and provided with a
secret police we financed. By
the most conservative esti
mates I have read, the Shah kil
led 60,000 Iranians. Other es
timates range from 100,000 to
200,000.
Why did the CIA engineer a
coup and install a young Shah
back in 1953? Because his
elected predecessor,
Mohammed Mossadegh began
to nationalize the oil in 1952. In
contrast the Shah allowed the
oil corporations to continue
production in return for a
piece of the action and U.S.
military support.
During his rule, the Shah's
assets grew to an
estimated $27 billion and in
cluded 25 steel mills, 15 banks,
eight mining and 43 construc
tion companies, 25 percent of
the Iranian farmland and much
more. On top of that an esti
mated one to two billion in oil
revenues went into his Swiss
accounts each year. Ninety
percent of the Iranian people,
however, got very little — 20
percent of the private wealth to
be exact. The Shah alienated
even privileged middle class
parents because he killed too
many of their sons and
daughters who wanted to
change that.
Meanwhile, back in the Un
ited States the media showed
us lovely pictures of the Shah
and his emperess, and extolled
the donations she gave to Ira
nian charity.
Why should we send the
Shah home? Not because hos
tages are being held — I disag
ree with military tactics that
make bystanders their target.
No, we should send him back
because he is a criminal. He is

no less a criminal than
Eichmann whom the Jewish
people had every right to bring
to trial. The Iranian people also
have that right.
Supporting Khomeini isn't
the issue here (I don't). Sup
portingthe rights of the Iranian
people is.
It is sad that victims have to
use tactics like kidnap to bring
criminals to trial, but the blame
for that lies with the govern
ment that harbors the crimU
nals, not their victims. Doesn't
the U.S. policy of harboring
Nazi war criminals and Samoza
and the Shah in fact reward
their crimes? And doesn't re
warding their crimes encour
age them? And doesn't this
make violent actions by their
victims inevitable?
What worries me most about
the Iranian situation isn't
what's happening in Iran, but
what's happening here.
What scares me is how the
media have whipped the coun
try into a war frenzy once
again.
What scares me is how work
ing people who are tired of tak
ing it — the gaslines, the rents,
the food prices, the utility bills,
layoffs and crime — can so eas
ily be made to vent their anger
on the wrong target. On the TV
news I saw a picket sign that
said; "I am tired of being
pushed around." It was clear to
the sign-bearer that it's not the
oil corporations, the utility
monopolies, the banks and
housing speculators who are
pushing him around. It's that
lousy Iranian student down the
street.
Shades of 1930 Germany.
