# Conservative pastor recruits 'patriots' at 'Mt. Vernon'

### 
Louisville, 111. (AP) — Once it took
an armored car and 100 police and
FBI agents to crash through the main
gate of Johnny Bob Harrell's Mount
Vernon-like estate on the bank of
the Little Wabash River. Times have
changed for Johnny Bob, but he's
still recruiting "patriots" willing to
enter his fenced compound and
train for the Armageddon he fears is
coming.
Harrell is founder of the
Christian-Patriots Defense League,
pastor of the Christian Conservative
Church and guru to those who be
lieve in a coming collapse of the U.S.
government.
Harrell the preacher is readying
his followers for "an old-fashioned
Old Testament chastisement."
Harrell the patriot is readying his
volunteers for war, a communist in
vasion by land, sea and air.

"They'll come from Cuba, from
Mexico, from the Caribbean.
Everywhere the cancer of com
munism has taken hold," he pre
dicted.
The estate is both church and
headquarters. Its 55 acres tucked
away in Illinois corn country serve as
a training ground for his patriots,
who come to learn about living
without the luxuries of a free world.
"We had 2000 here in September
for a two-day session," said Harrell,
57, who looks the part of a revival
preacher with flowing white hair.
Classes at the annual Freedom
Festival include meat preservation,
first aid, weapons loading and
emergency sewing. He gives lessons
on "how to establish a constitutional
money system, preservation of the
American tamily and the Bible's
answer to racial questions."

Harrell — once a millionaire with
money from theater promotion,
gold speculation and an inheritance
— built his Mount Vernon in 1958. It
is identical to George Washington's
Virginia mansion but 20 percent
larger. Harrell never used it as a
home, donating it instead to the
church and living nearby with his
wife and seven children.
The atmosphere on the estate has
changed considerably since the
early morning of Aug. 4, 1961, when
the FBI and police drove an armored
car through his front gate to arrest an
18-year-old Marine deserter, Dion
Davis of Greenville, N.C. Also ar
rested were Harrell and 16 students
in an anti-communist school that no
longer exists.
Harrell, convicted of conspiring to
harbor a deserter, spent four years
in prison. He said the Lord told him

to protect Davis after Davis spoke of
"immorality, debauchery and
atheism in the Corps."
He said he knew he was defying
federal autnority but he had to pre
pare for the eventual collapse of
government and the coming military
invasion.
"Hitler told us what he was going
to do, years ago, in his book Mein
Kampf,' but we refused to believe
him," Harrell said. "The Russians
have told us for years how they'll
spread communism to all the coun
tries around us, then pluck us like a
ripe apple.
"America is ripe now. We have
steered away from the basics in edu
cation, in Christianity, in our daily
lives. We have insulted the creator
of this universe and the time has
come for us to be punished," he
said.
