## highlights of Big Game Week '79 
### Rob Lempert 
Big (iame weekends usuallv begin
about [hursday. fhat's when c lasses
and studying and all those oilier
types ol woi k we do around here be
( orne set ondtiry to the issue at hand.
Rightly or wrongly, students here
tend to believe that it they concern
themselves with the world's prob
lems, tlicv will be more likely to go
away.
Big (iame weekend is different.
I he world's problems are ( ondensed
into a single, all-encompassing goal.
But it is not winning the game that is
most important that would be
Michigan lootball nor even want
ing to win the game. Wh.il is impor
tant is to have tun
Big Came weekends are made to
be enjoyed.
Mine started in Berkelev. On
I luirsday, seven triends and I arrived
at ( al on what we called a redecora
tion campaign with two iO-toot-long
b.inners painted bright red and bear
ing the comments lil\l ( AI and
something worse, all stufted in a c ar
with .1 Stanford University sticker
embla/oned across the back.
\pparently we didn't look as sus
picious as we tell, bee a use we had no
problem causing oui signs, dis
guised .is posters in C eil bookstore
bags, to our target buildings. My
group's target was Berkeley's Hoover
tower, the ( ampanile
When we arrived .it the top, we
lound we were alone, e\c epl lor two
students engrossed in a c onversation
in .1 corner But we waited lor our
i aretully arranged diversion anvwav.
When .i large red banner fluttered
lown liom the eighth storv window
ii the nearby c hem building, we yel
ed Oh look' and threw our Bl Al
' Al sign oil the other side ol the
c >wer.
I 'ntortunalelv there was only one
,\ay back down, I lie elevator, and it
wis a while in c oming. When it tinally
licl arrive, it was lull ol angry Cal
.Indents. Worse still, one ol them
ec ogni/ed our group leader Scott as
in old high school li lend
I le stared at us lor a long moment,
ind then, putting one and one to

aether and getting zero, he said "Hi
Scott" and ran up the stairs with all
his triends.
Friday afternoon was tilled with
naps and errands to prepare tor the
evening ahead. Rallies and games
require much in the way o! liquid
refreshments. Mter dinner we went
to (/ t i/e//es and then rushed bat k to
catch our (bartered yellow school
bus tor the ride up to the city
I he tins was ot course late, so to
pass the time we det idetl to hold our
own mini-bontire rally right there in
the Stern parking lot. My roommate
and I have had this little blue teddy
bear tor about tour years. I tound it in
the (band shak back when I was a
treshman and in the ISJUMB. It's
been through a lot snu e then. It lost
all its stutting being dragged around
.it games, and onte a drummer got a
hold of it and bit off its ear.
Well, there we were 111 the pai king
lot and we wanted a bonfire, and this
little bear (with the help ot some
kerosene) was the only thing around
we had to burn.
So we did, while we sang a lew
choruses ot "The Dirtv Ciolden
Ktvn " Rv th<» timi» ya'«> Imivhfwi fh<»

bus had arrived.
San Francisco is the only city with
moguls, an obnoxious New Yorker
said when we tinally got to the City.
He may have had a point. When our
bus driver took a short-cut up a not
so-llat street, all our "I think I can, I
think I c ail's" went lor naught and we
all had to pile out ol the bus so it
c ould get up the hill.
I lie Band was supposed to start its
march from the corner ol Sac
ramento and Taylor, near the summit
ol tli.it lull that now supports some ol
San franc isc o's linest hotels and
one e was the private property ol I e
land Stanlord and his fellow rail road
barons.
Though there were several
hundred people at the top ol the hill

when we gol there, there was no sign
ot the Band. Shortly, someone
realized that while the I SJUMB was
to have started its marc h at 10, it was
now c loser to 11.
Our dorm dec ided that it the Band

wouldn't c ome to lis, we d go lincl it.
So we started running down the hill
towards the waterfront, yelling and
chanting, "Beat Cal, step, step, Beat
Cal, step, step,'' to keep pace with
our gait. The idea was to run last
enough to avoid slipping on the wet
cable car tracks. Ii yon run last
enough, you can't slip because you
c an't fall any taster. Right <
Well at least we thought so.
To our surprise a large portion ol
the crowd on top of the lull got the

impression we had a good idea
where we were going and det ided to
lollow us. Looking hack, I saw se\
era I blocks lull of people all running
down the sleep lullv street in search
of the I SIUMH.
At eat h corner, though, part of the
crowd would turn left shouting out,
"Ihis way, this way." Sometimes
people followed and sometimes not,
but by the time we got to C olumbus,
the crowd was small enough to til
onto the sidewalk.






The Band was at the waterfront,
playing at the base of that awful
gooey hill between C.hirardelli and
the Cannery that it always seems to
rain on just before several thousand
students corne to trample it into
primeval 00/e. In places, if was loot
deep. Our bunny-hop lines were like
large drunken snakes slipping and
sliding through the crowd never
quite sure whether it was more im
portant to keep our balance or keep
time with the Band.
We !in. illy made our way down to
the pavement "land" — and con
tinued our dancing behind the band.
If wasn't any harder to hear them.
Ihe I S|UMB is probably the only
music al group in the world where the
winds accompany the drums. Drum
beats c arry in any ciirec lion. So what
il we couldn't tell what song they
were playing.
We were back on Ihe farm at an
early i a.m. and up again before fi for
the big wail by the stadium gates,
questing for that most valuable ot all
Big Ciame commodities, the r>o-yard
line seat. At 11 a.m. the lirsf gate was
opened, but barely a KM) people got
through before they closed il again.
Something about people getting in
without tic kets.
So we waited some more, and then
wait bed as they started opening the
gates one by one, letting some ot the
people who had been waiting lor
hours id ahead of others ot the
people who had been waiting for
hours. The gates would crack open
and then shut again, and every time
they did, Ihe people behind us
would push us in towards the hole in
the wall, which would quickly close, i
leaving us pinned between a mass ot
people and a chain link fence. When
we got close to the entr ince, we
were nearly crushed against the
metal poles leading to the gate.
We did get our 50-yard-line seats,
and there we tried to drink lunch 1
without moving our elbows and
breaking Ihe ribs ot our neighbors. It 1
was a short hour before our black- i
coaled triends irom Cal marched I
into the stadium under a hail ot
waterballoons, rattling keys and cries <
of "weenie band." A friend from <
Harvard commented that with the <
opinion Stanford fans usually hole) of i
everybody else's bands, our j
scoreboard should read: Home I
ream. Facists. <

The Cal band started its show, bu
no one watched, lor right behinc
them came the Incomparables
bouncing and dancing, and dressec
like a 1000 different strange things
Ihe game started soon alter and a>
Cal forged ahead, our beer supph
quickly sank in consolation.
Halltime. Scott, the leader of on
earlier raid, suddenly produced one
ot those surgical tubing slingshots a i
soon as the Cal band marched ontc
the field. He was only two rows up
and about 10 yards over, but in thai
crowded stadium, it was a five
minute undertaking to gel in posi
lion for the assault.
Our tirst shot was a little short; i
hit our band standing on the
sidelines. Boos rose from the sur
rounding crowd. Our next was ,
similar miss. As we adjusted our aim
lor a third-times-a-charm attempt, ,i
slightly greying, beer-bellied Cal
rooter pawed his way into our line ol
tire and defiantly sal down.
"Weenie, weenie" the crowd
chanted. Someone stole his yellow
cap and someone burst a balloon
over his head, t ie stayed undaunted
until we put away the slingshot. As he
got up to leave we all called out "give
him the hat, the hat, the hat," in rei
oiinition ol Ins hraverv hut unlortn

nately, its possesser didn't give it up.
That List pass oi that last game of
this last season was hatted away, and
as the clock ticket) away and as the
blue and dirty yellow crowd across
the v\ay thundered out the last lew
numbers, the realization slowly
c a me at ross that we had lost, that we
had run out ot mirat les. There would
be no Kenny Margerum snaring an
impossible pass in the entl /one, or a
50-yard held goal (or was ii (>()) bounc
ing oil a cross bar to win the game tor
us Stanford ( an alwayscome back so

quickly, it's hard to believe we lost.
All we had left was th.e Band. As
they played our tears slowly dried
up, the Cal people lett, and only we
students and our music remained in
the mostly empty stadium. Our dani -
ing grew faster and, I don't know
how much later, when the LSJUMB
linally played "All Right Now" and
we wandered otl to a tailgate party in
the dying light, the score and that
reversed call were almost forgotten.
Big Game weekends are made to
be enjoyed.
