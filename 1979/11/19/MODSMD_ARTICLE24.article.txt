## highlights of Big Game Week '79 
### Rob Lempert 
Big (iame weekends usuallv begin
about [hursday. fhat's when c lasses
and studying and all those oilier
types ol woi k we do around here be
( orne set ondtiry to the issue at hand.
Rightly or wrongly, students here
tend to believe that it they concern
themselves with the world's prob
lems, tlicv will be more likely to go
away.
Big (iame weekend is different.
I he world's problems are ( ondensed
into a single, all-encompassing goal.
But it is not winning the game that is
most important that would be
Michigan lootball nor even want
ing to win the game. Wh.il is impor
tant is to have tun
Big Came weekends are made to
be enjoyed.
Mine started in Berkelev. On
I luirsday, seven triends and I arrived
at ( al on what we called a redecora
tion campaign with two iO-toot-long
b.inners painted bright red and bear
ing the comments lil\l ( AI and
something worse, all stufted in a c ar
with .1 Stanford University sticker
embla/oned across the back.
\pparently we didn't look as sus
picious as we tell, bee a use we had no
problem causing oui signs, dis
guised .is posters in C eil bookstore
bags, to our target buildings. My
group's target was Berkeley's Hoover
tower, the ( ampanile
When we arrived .it the top, we
lound we were alone, e\c epl lor two
students engrossed in a c onversation
in .1 corner But we waited lor our
i aretully arranged diversion anvwav.
When .i large red banner fluttered
lown liom the eighth storv window
ii the nearby c hem building, we yel
ed Oh look' and threw our Bl Al
' Al sign oil the other side ol the
c >wer.
I 'ntortunalelv there was only one
,\ay back down, I lie elevator, and it
wis a while in c oming. When it tinally
licl arrive, it was lull ol angry Cal
.Indents. Worse still, one ol them
ec ogni/ed our group leader Scott as
in old high school li lend
I le stared at us lor a long moment,
ind then, putting one and one to

aether and getting zero, he said "Hi
Scott" and ran up the stairs with all
his triends.
Friday afternoon was tilled with
naps and errands to prepare tor the
evening ahead. Rallies and games
require much in the way o! liquid
refreshments. Mter dinner we went
to (/ t i/e//es and then rushed bat k to
catch our (bartered yellow school
bus tor the ride up to the city
I he tins was ot course late, so to
pass the time we det idetl to hold our
own mini-bontire rally right there in
the Stern parking lot. My roommate
and I have had this little blue teddy
bear tor about tour years. I tound it in
the (band shak back when I was a
treshman and in the ISJUMB. It's
been through a lot snu e then. It lost
all its stutting being dragged around
.it games, and onte a drummer got a
hold of it and bit off its ear.
Well, there we were 111 the pai king
lot and we wanted a bonfire, and this
little bear (with the help ot some
kerosene) was the only thing around
we had to burn.
So we did, while we sang a lew
choruses ot "The Dirtv Ciolden
Ktvn " Rv th<» timi» ya'«> Imivhfwi fh<»

bus had arrived.
San Francisco is the only city with
moguls, an obnoxious New Yorker
said when we tinally got to the City.
He may have had a point. When our
bus driver took a short-cut up a not
so-llat street, all our "I think I can, I
think I c ail's" went lor naught and we
all had to pile out ol the bus so it
c ould get up the hill.
I lie Band was supposed to start its
march from the corner ol Sac
ramento and Taylor, near the summit
ol tli.it lull that now supports some ol
San franc isc o's linest hotels and
one e was the private property ol I e
land Stanlord and his fellow rail road
barons.
Though there were several
hundred people at the top ol the hill

when we gol there, there was no sign
ot the Band. Shortly, someone
realized that while the I SJUMB was
to have started its marc h at 10, it was
now c loser to 11.
Our dorm dec ided that it the Band

wouldn't c ome to lis, we d go lincl it.
So we started running down the hill
towards the waterfront, yelling and
chanting, "Beat Cal, step, step, Beat
Cal, step, step,'' to keep pace with
our gait. The idea was to run last
enough to avoid slipping on the wet
cable car tracks. Ii yon run last
enough, you can't slip because you
c an't fall any taster. Right <
Well at least we thought so.
To our surprise a large portion ol
the crowd on top of the lull got the

impression we had a good idea
where we were going and det ided to
lollow us. Looking hack, I saw se\
era I blocks lull of people all running
down the sleep lullv street in search
of the I SIUMH.
At eat h corner, though, part of the
crowd would turn left shouting out,
"Ihis way, this way." Sometimes
people followed and sometimes not,
but by the time we got to C olumbus,
the crowd was small enough to til
onto the sidewalk.
