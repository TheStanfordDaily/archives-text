## Big Came loss makes Cards feel (Cal) blue 
### Peter Finch 
It's about a 500-yard walk
from Stanford Stadium to the
Entina showers. To the mem
bers of the Stantord football
team, it probably seemed a lot
longer than that Saturday.
Slowly working their way
through the crowd ol mixed
emotions, the Stantord Cardi
nals had plenty of lime to think
about their loss. The red-clad,
red-eyed alumni re-opened
their bars in the Chuck Taylor
Memorial Grove across from
Angell Field. "Nice try boys,
we'll get 'em next year."
Next year seems a long way
off right now. The present is
important. The present hurts.
Stanford's seniors, on their
way out, just said good-bye to
the Axe for their first time.
Palo Alto schoolchildren,
showing a youthful lack ot tact,
continued to pester the players
for their equipment.
"C'mon it was your last
game. Can't I have an elbow
pad?"
"Sorry, I gotta hang onto it."
A procession of cars rested
on Campus Drive as the Stan
ford players and their friends
crossed the street.
Close behind them were the
Cal players. Wielding mic
rophones, a group of reporters
surrounded Bear quarterback
Rich Campbell.
"What were you thinking
about as Stanford was on their
last drive?" they asked.
"How do you feel about the
season now?" another
queried.
"Was the team really emo
tionally high this year?"
They were the same old
questions. Campbell could
answer them in his sleep. But
Saturday, he gradually smiled
and told reporters what they
wanted to hear.
"Sure I was nervous," he
said. "But I knew our defense
called could hold them." He
flashed his teeth again, fueling
the reporters.
Standing near a griffin, Cal
fullback Paul lones worked
hard at being eloquent.
"On that last drive," he
explained, "I wanted to puke
tor awhile."
"Are you all right?" a smal

lish man asked.
"Oh yeah, I'm fine. It's just
that stomach acid that builds
up when you get excited. I'll be
okay."
The Stanford players filed
into their locker room quietly,
hanging their heads. A few re
porters tagged along behind
them.

"Beat California" was
printed neatly on a chalk
board. Next to it a small draw
ing of an animal and a caption
reading "Dead Bear."
A two-year-old bumper
sticker proclaiming "We're

going to the Sun Bowl" was
pasted over the door jam.
Someone had crossed out the
word "Sun" and replaced it
with "Rose." It was strikingly
unfitting.
Most of the players sho
wered and dressed quickly.
Senior safety Rick Parker took
his time, knowing that he was

removing his uniform for the
last time.
"How're you doing?" he
casually asked a reporter.
"All right. You?"
"Not so well. We had them
scared shitless, you know. I

never had any doubt about the
game. I thought we could win.
I guessed it was just one of
those things."
On the Cal side of the gym,
smoke circled in and out of the
locker room and showers.
Someone had brought long
cigars for the team and they re
joiced in the bath of their vic-

Tory smoke.
Like chain smokers, the
Bears lit each other's cigars.
There was a lot of laughing.
Clothed in towels or less, the
players slapped each other on
the back and asked "Hey, did

you get interviewed? All
right!"
The strains of disco music
pumped out of a small radio in
a room marked "defense."
There were no flashing lights
or fancy drinks, but a tew Cal
players danced briefly while
their coaches laughed.
"All right offense!" they
shouted across the hall.
"All right defense!" a cry
came back.
In the offense's room,
freshman Greg Woodard, who
was on the receiving end of the
Bear's first touchdown, was
grinning from ear to ear.
"I can hardly wait for next
year," he said. "We watched
the highlight film of last year's
game last night and that really
fired everybody up. We just
wanted to go out and kill
someone."
Right outside the room,
Jones was cornered again.
"This game was more like
they have been in the past," he
explained. "It really could have
gone either way. And that's the
way it should be, not 30-10 (last
year's score)."
)oe Rose, the Bears' tight end
that scored the game-winning
touchdown, sat quietly on a
bench by his locker.
"I feel fantastic," he
explained. "This is the closest
team we've had in the five
years I've been here. The
blacks are relating to the
whites, the freshmen and
seniors are getting along great.
It's been incredible."
Outside, the Cal groupies
waited for their heroes to finish
showering. The Stanford
groupies were gone.
Parker still lingered in the
dressing room. Kevin MacMil
lan, a freshman defensive
back, walked up and shook
Parker's hand.
"Thanks for all your help this
year,"
"Sure thing," Parker
answered. "Have a great
career."
Sophomore Rodney Gilmore
packed his bag and slowly
walked out the door. His
baseball cap said "Don't
panic-no problem."
Not until next year, at least.

i ne time-honored tradition of carrying the winning coach off the field is reversed here after California
beat Stanford 21-14 in the Big Came. Cal head coach Roger Theder bet offensive guard Brian Bailey (71)
a ride off the field if the Bears could break Stanford's three-year winning streak. Other players pictured

Defensive end Chuck Evans (89) closed out his Stanford career in
incredible fashion with 10 tackles Saturday, despite the 21-14 loss.
Shown here, Evans is rushing California quarterback Rich Campbell,
who had a great day in his own right, throwing three touchdown
passes and setting the single season Pac-tO mark for completion
percentage at .671.
