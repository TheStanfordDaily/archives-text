# Student effectiveness on committees debated
## 
### Richard Hefter 
Ten years ago, students asked for
representation on University
policy-making committees in order
to voice their opinions and influence
decisions.
Today, about 140 students sit on
more than 50 committees, but
whether or not they are effectively
voicing their opinions and influenc
ing decisions is questionable.
"A lot of the faculty (on the Univer
sity committees) seem to be set on
what they want to do, and student
members have little influence on
decision-making. Sometimes you
feel like a token on the committees,"
said one student committee
member.
But another student member ar
gued, "The impact students can have
on committees in general is very
large if they come in well-prepared
and can communicate their ideas
well. The administrative and faculty
representatives are genuinely con
cerned about student interests."
While there are many conflicting
opinions on the degree of student

effectiveness on University commit
tees, most students agree that their
impact is not as great as it should be.
Hammer policy
The committees here consist of
students, faculty and administrators
who work together "to hammer out
University policy," according to
Sibby Freeman, member of the
Council of Presidents (COP).
How effective a student is on the
committees "depends entirely on
the student," Freeman said.
The student members tend to ag
ree. They contend that student inef
fectiveness on committees is a result
of a lack of preparation and inhibi
tion.
, Potential not realized
Regina Petty, a law student,
member of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aids and member of last year's
COP, said, "students potentially
have a great deal of impact (in the
committees), but that potential is not
fully utilized at the present time."
Petty explained that "some stu
dents are too inhibited, not because

the faculty members are overly in
hibiting — which is sometimes the
case — but generally because of the
students' lack of confidence."
"Students defer too often to the
opinions of the faculty members and
don't articulate as much as they
could," because of a lack of prepara
tion, according to junior Ron
lohnson, member of the Committee
on Finance and Administration.
Lacking knowledge
"Students aren't naturally as know
ledgeable on the issues as the faculty
and administrative members, and,
therefore, they have to put more
time into preparation to be equally
effective," he said.
"If a student talks with other stu
dents, knows their opinions and ex
presses his ideas well, he will be lis
tened to.
"But if students are not well
prepared," Johnson added, "they
can have a negative influence, giving
naive reactions to the issues . . . and
the faculty will brush them off."
lohnson described what can hap
pen when student members fail to

prepare for meetings. Last year, he
said, the Land and Building Commit
tee approved the construction ot the
Lomita Road extension without ob
jection from the student committee
members.
The student members "were not
prepared on the issue, didn't consult
the students and offered no opinion
on the subject," he said. But the stu
dent body did not want the road ex
tension and "reacted very angrily" to
the decision, Johnson said.
Previous info vital
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
lames Lyons, said that while there is
"no difference in the relative effec
tiveness" of students and staff in
most circumstances, students are
less effective in the areas that require
previous knowledge on issues.
"Any given student is not likely to
have the history of the University
(that a staff member has), and the
absence of perspective that comes
with time can be a hindrance.
"But the most effective student is
