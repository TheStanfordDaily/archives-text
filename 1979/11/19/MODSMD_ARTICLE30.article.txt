# The
						rollercoaster ride comes up short
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
That old warrior of football
fame, Sir Isaac Newton, put it
succinctly in the apple orchard
about four centuries ago: what
goes up must come down.
Three months ago, the Stan
ford Cardinals had a clean,
even record. Full ov high ex
pectations for the coming year,
they were ready to get on the
merry-go-round of college
tootball and get off 11 games
later like the Lone Ranger off of
Silver, the valiant winners.
But the Cards were at the

wrong ticket booth. What they
thought was the merry-go
round was the rollercoaster,
the Monster of the Midway,
Alien disguised in Pac-10 clo
thing. And after a journey of
towering highs (USC, UCLA,
Arizona State) and hellish lows
(Tulane, Army and Oregon),
the passengers finished with a
not-so-clean but even record:
5-5-1.
Like all rollercoasters, they
got off the ride at the departure
point. They started out even
and they ended even. But in

the last seven minutes of that
11-week, 60-minutes-at-a-shot
ride, the Cards made one last
fleeting attempt at defying Sir
Isaac's timeworn wisdom.
For 19 plays, 79 yards and
7:09, the Cards defied every
rule of football nature. On
three fourth down plays, they
stared death down. On the
fourth, however, it was the
Cards who blinked. Or rather,
California safety Ron Coc
cimiglio blinked for them, bat
ting Turk Schonert's pass out
of Mike Dotterer's hands and
preserving the Bears' 21-14
margin.
Coccimiglio finished with
eight tackles Saturday, but
none of them was as important
as the tackle he did not have to
make.
"Everybody went to my left,"
the slender safety said, "and
the halfback (Dotterer) re
leased to the right. Schonert
started scrambling and I locked
onto the halfback. I was on his
back when the ball came.
"You only get one time to
make a play like that," he ad
ded. "When you can do it,
you're really happy."
The irony of it all is that Dot
terer was not only not the
primary receiver but he was in
the wrong place.
The play called was a pass to
tight end Pat Bowe in the right
corner of the end zone. Dot
terer was to go into the left side
of the end zone, forcing the
linebacker to cover him and
freeing Bowe from the de
fense.
But Dotterer went through
the right side ot the line instead
of the left, the linebacker
picked up Bowe and the play
was blown.
"It wab a dive left play
action," Dotterer said after the
game, "I was supposed to do a
hook, but I dove right. I blew
the assignment. Turk was pres
sured and threw it right to me
but there were guys all over
me. Coccimiglio made a good
play. That was it."
Stanford head coach Rod
Dowhower was equivocal in
his analysis of the final play. "I
thought it was the appropriate

play. The back came in right
instead of left. But he made
some good plays during the
game."
Of course, Dowhower is
right. One play does not a
game make. However, in
another sense, it can make a
whole season.
"When I saw the ball flop on
the ground, I knew the whole
season was worthwhile," Cal
linebacker Stan Holloway said.
"It was all Coccimiglio.
Schonert started scrambling
towards the end zone and he
stopped short. The back
drifted into the left tlat and he
was gone. Coccimiglio jumped
over and put his hand between
the ball and the back's hands."
Schonert, in his words "sore
as hell" after the game, had to
wait for the player reactions to
find out whether his season
was over.
"I tried to throw it low, I got
hit when I threw it and I didn't
see what happened," the quar
terback said.
When he got up and disco
vered his college career was
over, Schonert was stunned.
As the Cal defense jumped and
screamed their delight,
Schonert stood motionless,
hands by his side at the 10-
vard-line.
"Everything was building,
building up. There was no
doubt we would get in the end
zone. When we didn't, all the
air was let out of the balloon.
"We knew we had to do it,"
he continued. "It was the last
play the 11 of us would be to
gether. We just looked as each
otherand said this is it. We just
came up a little short."
"I guess that's what makes
the game exciting," tlanker
Ken Margerum said. "It was
our last play together ever.
Maybe we should have run a
play with a yard to go, but we
got down there with the pass."
Margerum praised the
California team for their clean
play, a 180-degree turn from
the fights and scuttles that have
marred the past two Big
Games.
"There were no cheap
shots," the Ail-American re

ceiver said. "They showed a lot
of class. It's a tribute to coach
(Roger) Theder and his staff."
As for Theder, the winning
head coach had quit thinking
about Stanford scoring as that
final drive droned on. He was
thinking about what would
happen afterward.
"I thought about what was
our two-point defense and
how we would go down and
get three points quickly," the
champagne-drenched coach
said. "And I hoped our defense
would hold them."
They did hold them. If you
can rattle off another 20-play,
79-yard, 7:14 drive that ended
in no points, go ahead. But
until then, the Stanford drive
that ended in l utility stands as a
reminder that the Big Came is
rarely over until the final mi
nute.

Split end Andre Tyler caught the tying touchdown Saturday by badly
beating California cornerback Ahmad Anderson (33). Tyler's fifth
touchdown reception of the year was the highlight of his four-catch
day. The junior finished the season with 45 catches for 652 yards.
