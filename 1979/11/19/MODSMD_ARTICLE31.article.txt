# Cards rout Cal; earn NCAA berth
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
When senior Randy Kalbus
goes home to Long Beach this
week for Thanksgiving, he
might find himself with a few
house guests: the entire Stan
lord water polo team.
Kalbus, whose home town is
the site of the 1979 NCAA water
polo championships, scored
three goals in the Cardinals'
10-7 victory over California
Saturday at deCuerre. The win
secured Stanford a berth in the
nationals this weekend.
Though Kalbus' goals equal
led the winning margin, the
Stanford captain's most valu
able contribution in Saturday's
game was maintaining the
team's emotional intensity
which allowed the Cardinals to
hold tight to a 3-0 first quarter
lead.
The real star of that critical
lirst quarter was the Stanford
man-down defense. Three
times in the period, the Bears
were unable to score with a
man-up advantage, and scored
only three times in nine 6-on-5
opportunities during the
game.
The Cards, meanwhile, were
given only three man-up op
portunities, but converted all
ot them into goals.
After the first quarter, the
game was a tie, as each team
scored three times in the sec
ond period and twice in each of
the third and fourth quarters.
"Usually, we go out in the
tirst and second quarters and
do well," Kalbus said. "Then
we do badly in the third.
(Against Cal), I just wanted to
keep that same intensity."
Kalbus said he has tried to

take responsibility for relaying
messages and instructions
from assistant coach Doug
Burke to the players during the
game. "When there's a lot of
communication out there," he
said, "it makes a big differ
ence." Kalbus said he also feels
"a lot more comfortable trying
to build some emotion bet
ween quarters."
"Kalbus is really starting to
come around," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti of his
captain. "He's starting to exert
himself as a team leader. You
need a guy in the pool that's
kind of a leader right now, but
you can't go and tell him to be
one. It's something that has to
be in him and the team has to
come to accept him in that
role."
Another crucial perfor
mance was turned in by
treshman Greg Lambert, who
came off the bench to replace
sophomore Chris Kelsey when
the Cards' leading scorer
fouled out in the second quar
ter.
Lambert, the son of former
Stanford and U.S. Olympic
water polo coach Art Lambert,
did a "real steady job," accord
ing to Dettamanti.
"Every single guy did
an excellent job," he ad
ded. "Each of them did what
he had to do on offense and
defense. |ody (Campbell)
played a super game in the
hole; he controlled the ball
well. ()ohn) Cansel did a super
job, too. He was really
psyched."
The junior goalie finished
the game with two steals and 10
saves, one of which was a

blocked penalty shot. On a few
of the saves, Cansel was the
only thing between the goal
and the shooter.
Another key to the game, ac
cording to Dettamanti, was the
success of the Cardinal game
plan. Besides shutting down
the Bears' 6-on-5, Stanford was
also successful in controlling
All America Kevin Robertson
and Carlos Steffens.
Robertson, who almost
single-handedly beat the Cards
with four goals when the teams
met two weeks ago, was two
for 10 Saturday. Both of his
goals came on quick, little flip
shots that Cansel got a hand
on, but could not stop.
"RobeFtson was a real gar
bage man," Dettamanti said.
"He just threw shit up and it
went in."
The object with Steffens, he
added, was to keep him from
setting hole as much as possi
ble, something the Cards were
fairly successful at. "I thought
we did a good job on him,"
said Dettamanti.
Steffens was finally ejected

from the game in the fourth
quarter after, committing his
third major foul. "He's gross,"
the Card coach said. "He's re
ally a head-hunter in there. On
the last foul, he hit a guy in the
face. He gets away with murder
. . . but all you can do is alert
the referee."
Dettamanti praised the team
defense of the Cards, saying
"Defense is the hardest thing
to get motivated for. But when
you're motivated to win, your
defense picks up. Also, you
can afford to cheat a little on
defense with Gansel in the
goal."
"We played really relaxed
and confident with ourselves,"
Kalbus said. "We were nof
worrying that someone was
going to mess up. There were
no surprising situations." Kal
bus attributed the team's con
fidence to good workouts dur
ing the week, which he said
were a "good base" coming
into the game.
"We're just playing with so
much more confidence in what
we know we can do. There's no
hesitancy," he said.

bage man," Dettamanti said.
"He just threw shit up and it
went in."
The object with Steffens, he
added, was to keep him from
setting hole as much as possi
ble, something the Cards were
fairly successful at. "I thought
we did a good job on him,"
said Dettamanti.
Steffens was finally ejected

from the game in the fourth
quarter after, committing his
third major foul. "He's gross,"
the Card coach said. "He's re
ally a head-hunter in there. On
the last foul, he hit a guy in the
face. He gets away with murder
. . . but all you can do is alert
the referee."
Dettamanti praised the team
defense of the Cards, saying
"Defense is the hardest thing
to get motivated for. But when
you're motivated to win, your
defense picks up. Also, you
can afford to cheat a little on
defense with Gansel in the
goal."
"We played really relaxed
and confident with ourselves,"
Kalbus said. "We were nof
worrying that someone was
going to mess up. There were
no surprising situations." Kal
bus attributed the team's con
fidence to good workouts dur
ing the week, which he said
were a "good base" coming
into the game.
"We're just playing with so
much more confidence in what
we know we can do. There's no
hesitancy," he said.

Stanford senior Randy Kalbusscored three goals in leading the Cards to a berth in the NCAAs with a 10-7
win over Pac-10 champion California Saturday at deGuerre. The tournament will be held this weekend,
with Stanford, Cal and IJC-Santa Barbara as the favorites.
When senior Randy Kalbus
goes home to Long Beach this
week for Thanksgiving, he
might find himself with a few
house guests: the entire Stan
lord water polo team.
Kalbus, whose home town is
the site of the 1979 NCAA water
polo championships, scored
three goals in the Cardinals'
10-7 victory over California
Saturday at deCuerre. The win
secured Stanford a berth in the
nationals this weekend.
Though Kalbus' goals equal
led the winning margin, the
Stanford captain's most valu
able contribution in Saturday's
game was maintaining the
team's emotional intensity
which allowed the Cardinals to
hold tight to a 3-0 first quarter
lead.
The real star of that critical
lirst quarter was the Stanford
man-down defense. Three
times in the period, the Bears
were unable to score with a
man-up advantage, and scored
only three times in nine 6-on-5
opportunities during the
game.
The Cards, meanwhile, were
given only three man-up op
portunities, but converted all
ot them into goals.
After the first quarter, the
game was a tie, as each team
scored three times in the sec
ond period and twice in each of
the third and fourth quarters.
"Usually, we go out in the
tirst and second quarters and
do well," Kalbus said. "Then
we do badly in the third.
(Against Cal), I just wanted to
keep that same intensity."
Kalbus said he has tried to

take responsibility for relaying
messages and instructions
from assistant coach Doug
Burke to the players during the
game. "When there's a lot of
communication out there," he
said, "it makes a big differ
ence." Kalbus said he also feels
"a lot more comfortable trying
to build some emotion bet
ween quarters."
"Kalbus is really starting to
come around," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti of his
captain. "He's starting to exert
himself as a team leader. You
need a guy in the pool that's
kind of a leader right now, but
you can't go and tell him to be
one. It's something that has to
be in him and the team has to
come to accept him in that
role."
Another crucial perfor
mance was turned in by
treshman Greg Lambert, who
came off the bench to replace
sophomore Chris Kelsey when
the Cards' leading scorer
fouled out in the second quar
ter.
Lambert, the son of former
Stanford and U.S. Olympic
water polo coach Art Lambert,
did a "real steady job," accord
ing to Dettamanti.
"Every single guy did
an excellent job," he ad
ded. "Each of them did what
he had to do on offense and
defense. |ody (Campbell)
played a super game in the
hole; he controlled the ball
well. ()ohn) Cansel did a super
job, too. He was really
psyched."
The junior goalie finished
the game with two steals and 10
saves, one of which was a

blocked penalty shot. On a few
of the saves, Cansel was the
only thing between the goal
and the shooter.
Another key to the game, ac
cording to Dettamanti, was the
success of the Cardinal game
plan. Besides shutting down
the Bears' 6-on-5, Stanford was
also successful in controlling
All America Kevin Robertson
and Carlos Steffens.
Robertson, who almost
single-handedly beat the Cards
with four goals when the teams
met two weeks ago, was two
for 10 Saturday. Both of his
goals came on quick, little flip
shots that Cansel got a hand
on, but could not stop.
"RobeFtson was a real gar
bage man," Dettamanti said.
"He just threw shit up and it
went in."
The object with Steffens, he
added, was to keep him from
setting hole as much as possi
ble, something the Cards were
