The Stanford men's and
women's swim teams collec
tively opened up their seasons
Thursday in a dual meet against
the Pleasant Hill Swim Club.
The Stanford women lost to the
powerful Pleasant Hill girls by a
score ot 80-33 while the men
fared better by defeating their
opponents 77-36.
The men's team, under
coach Skip Kenney, turned in
many good performances as
they swept the top three places
in lour events (although only
allowed to score tor the top
two places).
Sprinter Bob Hagberg was
Stanford's only triple winner ot
the day as he captured the 50
tree (21:56) and the 100 fly
(52:03). He also teamed up
with Mike Anderson, Ted
Knapp and Bari Weick to win
the 400 tree relay.
Anderson also took another
first place in the 200 treestyle
(1:45.94) with Weick finishing
second in that race. Weick also
looked very strong in winning
the 1650 free.
Co-captain Monte Brown
also copped two wins in the 200
fly (1:55.84) and the 500 tree
(4:45.43). In the 40() individual
medley, Brown swam one ol
the most exciting races ol the
day as he came from behind to

outtouch his opponent to
finish second. Co-captain Tom
O'Brien won that event and
also finished second to Brown
in the 200 fly.
Freshman John Simons, a na
tional champion in the
breaststroke and an outstand
ing I.M. swimmer, proved his

versatility by winning the 200
backstroke (1:59.9) with
teammate Kevin O'Beirne
finishing third in that event.
Despite the women's loss,
coach Claudia Thomas felt that
the team's times were very
good tor this time of the season
