New York (AP) — Quick,
can anybody come up with a
new bowl? You might be
able to match Alabama and
Southern California.
The bowl picture has be
come so preposterous that
two of the nation's top four
college football teams may
not represent their confer
ences in major bowls — or
even in any bowls, tor that
matter — while the Cotton
Bowl could wind up with a
rematch of the October
Texas-Oklahoma war.
Unless the National Col
legiate Athletic Association
has its head in the sand, it
will see that the 15 so-called
major bowls are proving to
be about live too many for
decent matchups. Fourteen
berths are still undecided,
although many of them are
just awaiting the outcome of
conference races.
The Georgia-Auburn
game — 15th-ranked Au
burn won 33-13 and pre
vented Georgia from nailing
down a Sugar Bowl spot —
was supposed to clear
things up. You call this
clear?
— The Sugar Bowl w.ll
match Alabama or Georgia
against Texas or Arkansas.
But top-rated Alabama
could go to no bowl at all. It
all depends on the Crimson
Tide's Dec. 1 game with Au
burn.
— The Rose Bowl will
match second-ranked Ohio
State against Southern Cal,
idle Saturday, or

Washington. If Southern
Cal beats UCLA, USC goes
to the Rose Bowl and
Washington heads for the
Sun Bowl against Houston,
Texas or Arkansas.
A UCLA win would put
Washington in the Rose
Bowl but where would that
leave USC? Perhaps the
Liesta Bowl against Pitt, one
ot five bowls which is going
to have to do some deep
searching to come up with a
deserving opponent.
I he Orange Bowl will
send next week's
Nebraska-Oklahoma win
ner against fifth-ranked
Florida State, 10-0 after
hammering Memphis State
66-17. Ffad Georgia won, the
Orange would have grab
bed Alabama to face the Big
Eight champ.
The Cotton Bowl will
have Arkansas, Houston,
Texas or Baylor against the
Nebraska-Oklahoma loser.
Until, and unless, Arkansas
beats Southern Methodist
next week, a Texas-
Oklahoma rerun is possible
and it was less than a week
ago that the Cotton Bowl
said it would never agree to
that.
"We certainly don't want
it to happen," selection
committee chairman Field
Scovell said over the
weekend. "Neither school
wants it, either, but it's just
one little gamble we're tak
ing."
