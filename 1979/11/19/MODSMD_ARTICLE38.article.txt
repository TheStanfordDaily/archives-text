Three killed in Utah plane crash
Salt Lake City — A cargo plane carrying 15
pounds ot explosives and "a mini..e quantity" of
low-level radioactive material blew up in flight yes
terday, then crashed in a thinly populated area,
officials said. All three crewmen were killed.
One witness said he thought he was watching a
meteor tall when he saw a red flash in the sky.
The tour-engine Transamerica Airlines turbop
rop crashed in a sagebrush area ot the Salt Lake
Valley about 10 minutes after its 5 a.m. takeoff
Irom Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, officials
said.
Deah Curry, an Air Force spokeswoman, said
the cargo included "a minute quantity of
thorium," which gives otl so little radiation that no
label is required on containers.
Thorium is otten used to coat watch faces, and
Curry said the cargo was thought to pose "no
more danger than a watch dial."
Ceiger counter checks ot the area showed no
radiation leakage, although the container carrying
the thorium could not be tound immediately, said
Larry Anderson, director of radiation and occupa
tional health for Utah.
About 50 deputies, firefighters and Air Force
personnel who worked close to the smoldering
wreckage were asked to undergo tests to check for
possible contamination, said sheriff's Lt. |ohn
Llewellyn, but the tests were abandoned after 37
people were sately screened.
Union rejects BART contract
Oakland — Members of United Public
Employees Local <90, in the midst of an 11-week
old labor dispute with the Bay Area Rapid Transit
iBAKT) district, voted 322-317yesterday to reject a
proposed contract and said they would meet early
today to decide whether to go out on strike.
The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555
voted to accept the pact 267-169, but the unions
agreed betore the vote that they both had to ac
cept the settlement in order for a proposed con
tract to be rati lied.
The contract called for a 3 percent pay hike be
ginning July 1, 1981. The unions, however, have
demanded wage increases pegged to cost-of
living hikes, or at least 10 percent per year.
Union leaders said they were unsure if the 322-
517 vote represented a mandate to strike.
The unions were voting on a tentative accord
reached late Friday following lengthy bargaining
sessions between the workers and BART manage
ment.
The $1.38 billion system was shut down Aug. 31
in what management called a strike and unions
have described as a lockout. It began with a sick
out ot tram operators.
Belore the voting, every speaker at the Local 390
meeting yesterday advised the membership to re
ject the pact.

Senate debates western land use
Washington — The "sagebrush rebellion" ar
rives at the Capitol for a skirmish this week, pitting
western senators against conservationists and the
Carter administration.
The battle over development of federal lands in
the West will be fought late tomorrow in a Senate
that may be diminished by members taking off
early for their Thanksgiving recess. House mem
bers have already gone home.
Debate on the proposed "windfall-profits" oil
tax will continue in the Senate today and early
tomorrow, but no significant action is expected.
Carter wants a so-called "windfall profits" tax to
accompany his program for gradually ending price
controls on domestically produced oil. Techni
cally, the tax would be on the extra revenue, not
profits, from decontrol. Without the tax, oil com
panies would keep more of the revenue as profits.
The Senate bill on western land would designate
2.2 million Idaho acres as wilderness. But an ex
pected amendment is part of a much larger fight
about who owns the West and decides (low its vast
areas may be used.
A movement dubbed the "sagebrush rebellion"
includes court suits by several Western states to
reclaim millions of acres of federal land. And sev
eral congressional bills have the same general aim
of opening federal land to development.
Iran may suffer from embargo
Washington — Despite "blustering and threats"
about holding back oil, Iranian leaders must step
up sales if they hope to keep stability at home, two
senators say a new study concludes.
"While we feel that the United States, by making
sacrifices, can live without the 4 percent of our oil
imports that we get from Iran, a healthy Iranian
economy depends on a minimum level of crude oil
production," said Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.).
And Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) said the new
study "concludes emphatically that any regime in
Iran which hopes to maintain domestic stability
and popular support must increase, not cut back,
on oil production, regardless of blustering and
threats."
President )immy Carter, reacting to the holding
of about 60 American hostages at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran, declared last week that the United
States would import no more oil from Iran. And
that nation's leaders quickly replied they were
about to cut off exports to America anyway.
Even if the present crisis ends peacefully,
Bentsen said, "unless some government can suc
cessfully impose its will on Iran, oil production
from that country will remain a tenuous proposi
tion."
And that could be at least as bad for Iran as for
nations that import her oil, the study concludes.

Odd-even gas sales start today
As California returns to limited odd-even
gasoline sales to show "solidarity" with President
Jimmy Carter's handling of the Iranian crisis, gov
ernors of other states are reacting more cautiously
to the White House call for fuel conservation.
Gov. |erry Brown ordered odd-even sales to
meet expected oil shortages stemming from the
U.S.-Iranian confrontation.
The new plan, virtually identical to that imposed
this past summer, takes effect in San Francisco,
Los Angeles and 13 urban counties at 12:01 a.m.
today. It becomes effective statewide Dec. 3.
California's previous odd-even plan, which
lasted tour months, was abandoned primarily be
cause it was widely ignored by both motorists and
police, who were supposed to enforce it.
On Friday, Carter and Energy Secretary Charles
Duncan met at the White House with 39 gover
nors, asking them to take immediate action to curb
oil demand, suggesting such tactics as odd-even
gasoline sales and minimum purchase rules.
During last summer's luel shortage, 11 states
and the District of Columbia had ordered odd
even sales of gasoline.
Today's weather
Fair today through tomorrow. Lows in the mid
30s to mid 40s tonight. Risk of scattered local frost
tomorrow morning. Highs mostly in the 50s.
Wednesday through Friday: mostly fair
weather but some cloudiness by Friday.

As California returns to limited odd-even
gasoline sales to show "solidarity" with President
Jimmy Carter's handling of the Iranian crisis, gov
ernors of other states are reacting more cautiously
to the White House call for fuel conservation.
Gov. |erry Brown ordered odd-even sales to
meet expected oil shortages stemming from the
U.S.-Iranian confrontation.
The new plan, virtually identical to that imposed
this past summer, takes effect in San Francisco,
Los Angeles and 13 urban counties at 12:01 a.m.
today. It becomes effective statewide Dec. 3.
California's previous odd-even plan, which
lasted tour months, was abandoned primarily be
cause it was widely ignored by both motorists and
police, who were supposed to enforce it.
On Friday, Carter and Energy Secretary Charles
Duncan met at the White House with 39 gover
nors, asking them to take immediate action to curb
oil demand, suggesting such tactics as odd-even
gasoline sales and minimum purchase rules.
During last summer's luel shortage, 11 states
and the District of Columbia had ordered odd
even sales of gasoline.
Today's weather
Fair today through tomorrow. Lows in the mid
30s to mid 40s tonight. Risk of scattered local frost
tomorrow morning. Highs mostly in the 50s.
Wednesday through Friday: mostly fair
weather but some cloudiness by Friday.
Three killed in Utah plane crash
Salt Lake City — A cargo plane carrying 15
pounds ot explosives and "a mini..e quantity" of
low-level radioactive material blew up in flight yes
terday, then crashed in a thinly populated area,
officials said. All three crewmen were killed.
One witness said he thought he was watching a
meteor tall when he saw a red flash in the sky.
The tour-engine Transamerica Airlines turbop
rop crashed in a sagebrush area ot the Salt Lake
Valley about 10 minutes after its 5 a.m. takeoff
Irom Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, officials
said.
Deah Curry, an Air Force spokeswoman, said
the cargo included "a minute quantity of
thorium," which gives otl so little radiation that no
label is required on containers.
Thorium is otten used to coat watch faces, and
Curry said the cargo was thought to pose "no
more danger than a watch dial."
Ceiger counter checks ot the area showed no
radiation leakage, although the container carrying
the thorium could not be tound immediately, said
Larry Anderson, director of radiation and occupa
tional health for Utah.
About 50 deputies, firefighters and Air Force
personnel who worked close to the smoldering
wreckage were asked to undergo tests to check for
possible contamination, said sheriff's Lt. |ohn
Llewellyn, but the tests were abandoned after 37
people were sately screened.
Union rejects BART contract
Oakland — Members of United Public
Employees Local <90, in the midst of an 11-week
old labor dispute with the Bay Area Rapid Transit
iBAKT) district, voted 322-317yesterday to reject a
proposed contract and said they would meet early
today to decide whether to go out on strike.
The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555
voted to accept the pact 267-169, but the unions
agreed betore the vote that they both had to ac
cept the settlement in order for a proposed con
tract to be rati lied.
The contract called for a 3 percent pay hike be
ginning July 1, 1981. The unions, however, have
demanded wage increases pegged to cost-of
living hikes, or at least 10 percent per year.
Union leaders said they were unsure if the 322-
517 vote represented a mandate to strike.
The unions were voting on a tentative accord
reached late Friday following lengthy bargaining
sessions between the workers and BART manage
ment.
The $1.38 billion system was shut down Aug. 31
in what management called a strike and unions
have described as a lockout. It began with a sick
out ot tram operators.
Belore the voting, every speaker at the Local 390
meeting yesterday advised the membership to re
ject the pact.

Senate debates western land use
Washington — The "sagebrush rebellion" ar
rives at the Capitol for a skirmish this week, pitting
western senators against conservationists and the
Carter administration.
The battle over development of federal lands in
the West will be fought late tomorrow in a Senate
that may be diminished by members taking off
early for their Thanksgiving recess. House mem
bers have already gone home.
Debate on the proposed "windfall-profits" oil
tax will continue in the Senate today and early
tomorrow, but no significant action is expected.
Carter wants a so-called "windfall profits" tax to
accompany his program for gradually ending price
controls on domestically produced oil. Techni
cally, the tax would be on the extra revenue, not
profits, from decontrol. Without the tax, oil com
panies would keep more of the revenue as profits.
The Senate bill on western land would designate
2.2 million Idaho acres as wilderness. But an ex
pected amendment is part of a much larger fight
about who owns the West and decides (low its vast
areas may be used.
A movement dubbed the "sagebrush rebellion"
includes court suits by several Western states to
reclaim millions of acres of federal land. And sev
eral congressional bills have the same general aim
of opening federal land to development.
Iran may suffer from embargo
Washington — Despite "blustering and threats"
about holding back oil, Iranian leaders must step
up sales if they hope to keep stability at home, two
senators say a new study concludes.
"While we feel that the United States, by making
sacrifices, can live without the 4 percent of our oil
imports that we get from Iran, a healthy Iranian
economy depends on a minimum level of crude oil
production," said Sen. Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.).
And Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) said the new
study "concludes emphatically that any regime in
Iran which hopes to maintain domestic stability
and popular support must increase, not cut back,
on oil production, regardless of blustering and
threats."
President )immy Carter, reacting to the holding
of about 60 American hostages at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran, declared last week that the United
States would import no more oil from Iran. And
that nation's leaders quickly replied they were
about to cut off exports to America anyway.
Even if the present crisis ends peacefully,
Bentsen said, "unless some government can suc
cessfully impose its will on Iran, oil production
from that country will remain a tenuous proposi
tion."
And that could be at least as bad for Iran as for
nations that import her oil, the study concludes.
