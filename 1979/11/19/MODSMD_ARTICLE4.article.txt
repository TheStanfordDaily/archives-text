# Medical Center will continue shipments to site
## Hanford, Wash, nuclear waste dump reopens 
### Mike Vaska 
The planned reopening of the
commercial low-level nuclear waste
dump in Hanford, Wash., alleviates
immediate concerns over the dis
posal ot Stanford's radioactive
wastes, according to |ohn Holmes,
the University's senior health physi
cist.
"But," he added, "new methods
must still be developed to treat and
dispose of these wastes."
Stanford makes three or four
shipments of radioactive waste to the
Hanford nuclear reservation every

year, with each shipment totaling
about 170, 55-gallon drums.
The site, one of three low-level
waste dumps in the nation, was
closed by Washington Gov. Dixie Lee
Ray Oct. 4 after improperly packaged
materials and defective trucks were
discovered there.
Ray cited humanitarian concerns
when she announced the reopening
of this site last Thursday.
"The nation's medical institutions
and medical research communities
must have a storage site for the low
level radioactive residue resulting

from the latest and most effective
methods used in saving the lives of
cancer, leukemia and other pa
tients," she said.
Slim pickings
On Oct. 25, Nevada Gov. Robert
List ordered that a similar site at
Beatty, Nev., be closed for what he
called sloppy operation.
The decisions in Washington and
Nevada left only a site near Barnwell,
S.C., receiving low-level wastes, and

Gov. Dick Riley said his state would
not accept wastes normally dumped
in Washington and Nevada.
As a result of the closures, users ot
radioactive materials here were
asked to minimize the volume of
wastes wherever possible. Holmes
said at the time of the closures that
the University could store the wastes
in its own storage facility behind
Police Services for onlv about two
