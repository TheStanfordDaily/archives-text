## Writer says American imperialism at root U.S. blamed in Iran crisis 
### Ken Kurosu 
The current Iranian crisis is a
reflection of continuing
American political intervention
in Iran, Bob Saibel, an Ameri
can writer who spent 2Vi
months in Iran this summer,
said Wednesday.
"The U.S. was slapping them
(Iranians) in the face by bring
ing the shah here," Saibel said
to 100 persons at a speech
sponsored by the Revolutio
nary Communist Youth
Brigade. The Iranian demand
for the extradition of the shah
is a "just demand," he said.
"They had to take some action,
and they did."
The Iranian people have
reason to be concerned about
the presence of the shah in the
United States, Saibel said.
"Look at the shah himself.
He has billions of dollars ready
to finance a coup," he said.
"The shah was a key cog in the
state of Iran, and, in any coup
or reimpositinn of American
rule, the shah would play an
extremely central part.
"U.S. policy is to try and
weaken the current govern
ment and to create a basis for
the United States to get their
hands in Iran again," he said.
Bringing the shah to the United
States is part of this policy, he
added.
'Ruling class'
American involvement in
Iran stems from the "ruling
class in this nation which has
important interests in Iran," he
said.
"The United States has an
economic stranglehold on
Iran," he claimed. "It's a gold
mine for the imperialists."
"Since the overthrow of the
shah, there has been constant
tension between the centers of
power in Iran," Saibel said. The
U.S. has brought these con
tradictions "to a head," forcing
the resignation of Prime

Minister Mehdi Bazargan, he
said.
Disagreement over relations
with the United States, the re
ligious zeal of the ayatollah and
the future of socialism in Iran
were not eradicated with the
revolution last spring, he said.
All oppose shah
Nevertheless, "the United
States has no right to be inter
vening regardless of Kho
meini," Saibel said. All Iranian
people oppose the return of
the shah's rule despite differ
ing stands on Khomeini's gov
ernment, he said.
Vet the United States ap
pears intent on undermining
the ayatollah's government,
Saibel said.
"There's been a conscious
media campaign to slander
Khomeini, to make him look
worse than the shah," he said.
"Let's take the question of
executions. Between 500 and
700 people have been exe
cuted since Khomeini took
power," he said. "I myself
would prefer that the trials had
been more open." But "the
shah was killing more people
in three hours than Khomeini
has in nine months," he said.
Grisly cartoons
The U.S. media is constantly
running pictures and cartoons
ol Khomeini's hand "dripping
with blood with bodies lying all
over the ground," he said.
"Where were those pictures
when the shah was in power?"
he asked.
Current calls for the mass
deportation of Iranian students
are unjustified, Saibel said.
"We owe the Iranian stu
dents a debt. If it wasn't for the
Iranian people, the American
people would not know that
the shah was such a criminal,"
he said.
'Yellow journalism'
The hysteria surrounding the
calls for deportation have been

created by the media "in the
fine tradition of William Ran
dolph Hearst and yellow jour
nalism," he said.
The Iranian people are not
hostile toward the American
people, Saibel said. "Basically
the people see the enemy as
U.S. imperialism," he said.
"I'm not saying there wasn't
hostility. There are always ex
ceptions. But the people have
been through a revolution, and
their thinking has changed,"
he said.
"The question for the left is
whether they can go to the
peasants and workers and the
broad masses whom they have
been cut off from for so long
under the shah's regime," he
said.
Class struggle will continue
in Iran, he said, as the leftist
forces struggle amongst them
selves as well as with the con
servative elements in Iran.

Bob Saibel (top row second from right) pictured here with Kurdish
rebels in Iran, says the embassy takeover is a reflection of American
intervention in Iran.
The current Iranian crisis is a
reflection of continuing
American political intervention
in Iran, Bob Saibel, an Ameri
can writer who spent 2Vi
months in Iran this summer,
said Wednesday.
"The U.S. was slapping them
(Iranians) in the face by bring
ing the shah here," Saibel said
to 100 persons at a speech
sponsored by the Revolutio
nary Communist Youth
Brigade. The Iranian demand
for the extradition of the shah
is a "just demand," he said.
"They had to take some action,
and they did."
The Iranian people have
reason to be concerned about
the presence of the shah in the
United States, Saibel said.
"Look at the shah himself.
He has billions of dollars ready
to finance a coup," he said.
"The shah was a key cog in the
state of Iran, and, in any coup
or reimpositinn of American
rule, the shah would play an
extremely central part.
"U.S. policy is to try and
weaken the current govern
ment and to create a basis for
the United States to get their
hands in Iran again," he said.
Bringing the shah to the United
States is part of this policy, he
added.
'Ruling class'
American involvement in
Iran stems from the "ruling
class in this nation which has
important interests in Iran," he
said.
"The United States has an
economic stranglehold on
Iran," he claimed. "It's a gold
mine for the imperialists."
"Since the overthrow of the
shah, there has been constant
tension between the centers of
power in Iran," Saibel said. The
U.S. has brought these con
tradictions "to a head," forcing
the resignation of Prime

Minister Mehdi Bazargan, he
said.
Disagreement over relations
with the United States, the re
ligious zeal of the ayatollah and
the future of socialism in Iran
were not eradicated with the
revolution last spring, he said.
All oppose shah
Nevertheless, "the United
States has no right to be inter
vening regardless of Kho
meini," Saibel said. All Iranian
people oppose the return of
the shah's rule despite differ
ing stands on Khomeini's gov
ernment, he said.
Vet the United States ap
pears intent on undermining
the ayatollah's government,
Saibel said.
"There's been a conscious
media campaign to slander
Khomeini, to make him look
worse than the shah," he said.
"Let's take the question of
executions. Between 500 and
700 people have been exe
cuted since Khomeini took
power," he said. "I myself
would prefer that the trials had
been more open." But "the
shah was killing more people
in three hours than Khomeini
has in nine months," he said.
Grisly cartoons
The U.S. media is constantly
running pictures and cartoons
ol Khomeini's hand "dripping
with blood with bodies lying all
over the ground," he said.
"Where were those pictures
when the shah was in power?"
he asked.
Current calls for the mass
deportation of Iranian students
are unjustified, Saibel said.
"We owe the Iranian stu
dents a debt. If it wasn't for the
Iranian people, the American
people would not know that
the shah was such a criminal,"
he said.
'Yellow journalism'
The hysteria surrounding the
calls for deportation have been

created by the media "in the
fine tradition of William Ran
dolph Hearst and yellow jour
nalism," he said.
The Iranian people are not
hostile toward the American
people, Saibel said. "Basically
the people see the enemy as
U.S. imperialism," he said.
"I'm not saying there wasn't
hostility. There are always ex
ceptions. But the people have
been through a revolution, and
their thinking has changed,"
he said.
"The question for the left is
whether they can go to the
peasants and workers and the
broad masses whom they have
been cut off from for so long
under the shah's regime," he
said.
Class struggle will continue
in Iran, he said, as the leftist
forces struggle amongst them
selves as well as with the con
servative elements in Iran.
