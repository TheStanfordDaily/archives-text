# Status symbols denote power in China

Peking (AP) — It they are not already,
Sinologists and sociologists will soon be
turning out learned tomes on the impor
tance of the wheel, the pocket and the
spittoon as status symbols in Chinese lite.
In the People's Republic of China, as
yoitr guides keep reminding you,
everyone is equal. There is no class dis
tinction, except that the bureaucrat or the
army officer with four pockets in his Mao
jacket, a chauffeur-driven Red Flag
(Hung-ch'i) limousine and a flower or
dragon-decaled spittoon beside his desk is
more equal than the pocketless peasant
on loot hawking by the side of the road or
the two-pocketed People's Liberation
Army private expectorating trom the back
of a truck.
The wheel in China marks one's prog
ress. A commune or a production brigade
that trades in its water buffalo tor a one
lung combustion plow, which looks like a
stripped-down snowmobile, is letting the
neighbors and party bigwigs know it has
exceeded all its production quotas.

Outside the toreign colony of dip
lomats, business representatives and the
press, there are no privately-owned vehi
cles in China. Only visitors and high
ranking communist officials in tailored
Mao suits ride in automobiles and taxis.
Having wheels denotes importance.
Ordinary tourists, like school groups
and youth delegations, travel about in
rattling antiquated buses. Those on the
more deluxe tours popular with the
affluent overseas Chinese do their sight
seeing and commute to the mandatory
acupuncture viewings in the comfort of a
minibus or even an air-conditioned van.
VIPs, like our press group, go about the
cities and out to the airports in rigidly
ritualized motorcades, as stylized as the
old Peking opera but playing to a much
larger audience.
The head ot the delegation or leader of
the group rides at the head ot the proces
sion alongside the highest-ranking
Chinese official in one of those massive
Red Flag limousines with the tassled cur

tains and polished mahogany woodwork.
The rest follow behind in gray or green
Shanghai model tour-door sedans that in
some cities also serve as taxicabs. Each
vehicle, beginning with the leader's
limousine, had a large cardboard number
at the right hand of the windshield I never
did learn why one morning I was demoted
trom car 7 to car 9.
Distinguished visitors wait for planes in
airport VIP lounges invariably furnished
with slipcovered divan chairs, blue electric
tans, portraits of Mao, Marx, Lenin, Engels
and Stalin, and steaming cups of green tea.
Former British Prime Minister Edward
Heath, waiting with us for the plane to
Tibet, lounged in a separate but equal VIP
lounge, except being more distinguished,
he rated cut flowers.
Both lounges, however, boasted eleg
ant enameled spittoons done in a tongue
flicking dragon motif. Spit and polish are a
key part of the protocol in the People's
Republic of China.
This, after all, is cuspidor's last stand.
