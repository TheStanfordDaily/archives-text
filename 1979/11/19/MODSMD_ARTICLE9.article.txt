# Queen implicated in Britain's spy scandal

### 
London (AP) — Queen
Elizabeth II was drawn into the
Anthony Blunt spy scandal Fri
day as the result of conflicting
statements by her palace press
office. At the same time, op
position members of Parlia
ment demanded a no-holds
barred investigation of the
security coverup that kept
Blunt in a royal post for four
years after he confessed to
being a Soviet spy.
Blunt was named as the
"fourth man" in the spy chain
of Guy Burgess, Donald Mac-
Lean and Kim Philby, whose
defections to Moscow in the
1950s and 1960s have haunted
every British government. All
three worked in the British
Embassy in Washington.
The controversy involving
the queen concerned whether
she was informed of the con
fession in 1964, and thus knew
Blunt, an art historian, was a
spy while serving in the unpaid

post of Surveyor of the
Queen's Pictures.
The office first said the
queen was told about Blunt,
then later it retracted the
statement.
The upset began when a
spokesman earlier in the day
confirmed Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's statement
to the House of Commons on
Thursday that the queen's pri
vate secretary in 1964, Sir
Michael Adeane, was told
about Blunt.
The spokesman added: "It
can be taken trom that that
the queen did know."
That was carried by the
domestic news agency, Press
Association, and was aired by
the British Broadcasting Corp.
(BBC) and a commercial radio
station.
Then the Press Association
advised its clients that its re
port was to be held back for
urgent clarification.
Michael Shea, chief press
secretary to the queen, put out
another statement saying the
comment about the queen
knowing was a "personal in
terpretation made by a
member of the press office."
What Adeane told the
queen, if anything, will never
be revealed because, Snea
said, "exchanges between the
private secretary to the queen
and that sovereign are confi
dential."
