An open letter to the
Stanford community
The Stanford Daily and
INVITE YOU TO A PUBLICITY WORKSHOP
TODAY FROM 4 TO 6 P.M. IN THE
MEYER FORUM ROOM.
Dear hriends:
The Stanford Daily and KZSU cordially invite you or a representative of
your organization, department or living group to our publicity work
shop.
Both the Daily and KZSU are often asked why we failed to cover or
promote a particular event. Too frequently, the answer is due to a lack of
communication between us and the sponsoring group.
We'd like to help overcome this gap by exchanging ideas on how your
organization can best communicate with us. A publicity workshop is a
logical forum for this exchange.
The Daily and KZSU have complimentary publicity services that can be
offered to your organization. At the workshop, we will each offer a
half-hour presentation on our respective needs and services, including
mention of deadlines and news policies. Then we will open the work
shop for questions and suggestions.
We hope this workshop will give you a clearer picture of our organiza
tions.
We look forward to seeing you today.
Sincerely,
Sara Lessley Mike DiMartino
Editor Station Manager
