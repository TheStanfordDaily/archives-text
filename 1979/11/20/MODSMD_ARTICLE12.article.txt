## Fast not just symbolic 
### 
Thousands of students including
many here at Stanford will participate in
today's annual National Day of Fasting. It
is more than a symbolic gesture of sup
port to the world's starving millions. It
demonstrates a growing nationwide
commitment to helping nourish the
needy.
We have heard the ghastly stories of
malnutrition and starvation and have
seen the specter of hunger in Cambodia
displayed in the press. Many have seen
the emotional advertisement picturing a
forlorn Indian youngster headlined,
"You can help feed Mukerji, or you can
turn the page."

The Day of Fasting offers us yet one
more chance not to "turn the page." If
past years are any indication, the day will
not only help to raise the consciousness
of students, but it will also generate
thousands of dollars to be distributed
through various hunger relief organiza
tions.
Whether one participates in the fast or
donates money to the hunger organiza
tions that will be collecting on campus
today is not as important, however, as
whether one recognizes the importance
of making hunger an issue of national
concern.
