## Remember the hungry 
### 
The faces on the magazine
cover Razed at me. Time
magazine tends to run photo
graphs that capture the es
sence of tragic situations, and
this cover was no exception. A
grieving Cambodian mother
and her starving child: the pic
ture, in its brutal honesty,
caused me acute discomfort; I
wanted to turn away.
The truth, painful in many
circumstances, is almost un
bearable when the truth is that
millions of people are starving,
and a whole race of humans is
on the brink of extinction in
Cambodia.
Today, Nov. 20, is the annual
campus-wide day of fasting at
Stanford. Every year a fair
number of students join in this
gesture by abstaining from eat
ing meals in their residence di
ning halls for a day. Most resi
dences give rebates for each
student who pledges to fast for
the day; last year more than
$4000 was raised through these
rebates and distributed to vari
ous hunger relief organiza
tions.
This year the response in
pledges to fast has been exten
sive, and the total amount of
money that Stanford will be
able to donate should exceed
by a significant amount last
year's figure.
Undoubtedly the current
climax of the Cambodian
famine, documented exten
sively in the media and result
ing in a world-wide emergency
relief effort, will stimulate
many people to fast who might
otherwise have found a reason
not to do so.
The timing of the Cambo
dian crisis and the fast day may
mean more money sent out
from Stanford. However, I am
deeply concerned lest we de
velop a crisis-oriented concep
tion of world hunger. Cam
bodia in this approach be
comes similar to a forest fire:
an emergency arises, measures
are taken to deal with it and
eventually all is well again.
Thus, a day of fasting be
comes an emergency action to
be undertaken in extreme situ
ations. After the fast, one
might assume that he has
"done his part;" eventually
Cambodia passes out of the
mind and heart like a traumatic
final exam.
Unfortunately the Cambo
dian famine is only the worst
such tragedy in our world. The
end of the Cambodian crisis —
whenever that may come and
whatever it may be — will not
signal the end of our need for
concern and involvement.
The truth is that millions of
people, from Cambodia to

Uganda to Nicaragua to Oak
land (that's right: Oakland,
East Bay, California) simply do
not have enough to eat. By
"not enough to eat," I do not
mean they do not have all that
we have. I mean that millions
of people are barely surviving
and slowly starving to death.
I believe that many people
honestly feel concerned about
this fact, and see the fast day as
a concrete way to express that
concern and try to better un
derstand the situation. How
ever, after the day of fasting,
the uncomfortable facts of
world hunger will tend to fade
into the background of our all
important Stanford existences.
The reality of world hunger
will remain, however, and the
only way in which we can pre
vent this fast day from becom
ing merely an exercise in col
lective guilt-eradication is to
commit ourselves to accept the
uncomfortable reality of starv
ing humans, and to force our
concern about the problem to
extend beyond the Cambodian
crisis and the campus-wide day
of fasting.
My freshman year I had a
poster on the wall of my dorm
room which had printed on it,
"See no hunger, hear no
hunger, feel no pain." A friend
criticized the poster, challeng
ing me to account for any good
it accomplished. I must not
have been able to find an ans
wer, because the poster disap
peared long ago.
Now I think I have under
gone some changes and can
see what concrete acts might
result from constantly forcing
myself to deal with the reality
of world hunger. There are a
variety of actions which we can
take. We can decide to commit
a certain amount of money
each month to a world-hunger
relief organization. There are
several organizations that keep
administrative costs very low in
order that money be used as
effectively as possible, and that
furthermore are sensitive to
the root causes of world
hunger and seek to alleviate
problems at those roots.
We can read to become in
formed of the congressional
decisions that affect U.S. pol
icy toward under-developed
countries: then we can write to
our representatives urging
them to vote in favor of
humane policy decisions. We
can pray for Cod's help and
mercy towards unjustly op
pressed people.
And maybe we all will begin
to be aware of our wasteful,
perhaps gluttonous patterns of
consump'.ion. We may thus

begin to forego the excessive,
simply as a demonstration that
our concern for hungry people
extends beyond words, to ac
tions.
Our Stanford environment is
dangerous. It is too mesmeriz
ing; it becomes too easy to
hide from facts that upset our
comfortable, ordered lives.
The truth, however, must be
faced and accepted.
And one of the most positive
things about such an accep
tance of the facts of world
hunger is that we do not have
to merely accept the truth; we
all have the resources to
change the situation in some
small way.
This Thanksgiving do not
stuff yourself into oblivion. Eat
thoughtfully and thankfully —
surely we all have much more
than we deserve — and commit
yourself to honest, active con
cern about our fellow humans
worldwide who lack the basic
staples for complete and pro
ductive lives.
