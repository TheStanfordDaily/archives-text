## John Willis Chrysler bailout a waste of money 
### 
Economic affiliations aside,
it is an acknowledged fact that
any society should strive to
maximize the utility of goods
produced with the scarce re
sources available to that soci
ety. Only the means of attain
ing that end differ between
capitalist and socialist
ideologies: the former advo
cates the use of competition
within the society, and the lat
ter favors government co

ordination of resource alloca
tion.
American society ordinarily
attempts to pursue such utility
maximization, yet between the
mixing of economic theories
and the short-run political ap
peal of pleasing special interest
groups we are occasionally led
astray. The federal-backed
loans proposed for Chrysler
Corporation represent one
such example, applicable

largely to the second category
('political desirability').
Obviously, many Americans
would be highly displeased if
Congress failed to support
federal financing. They include
the following groups: the
half-million workers who stand
to lose their jobs, the banks
which now have Chrysler loans
outstanding, Chrysler stoc
kholders and much of the city
of Detroit.
Very few Americans, on the
other hand, stand to lose a
great deal if the loans are
guaranteed. Therefore, de
spite the fact that our society
will suffer as a whole if the
loans are approved, the oppos
ition cannot possibly be as fer
vent or as well-organized as are
the proponents of the loans.
That is why passage is a politi
cally pleasing prospect to many
of our leaders.
The loss to society which I
have alluded to results, clearly,
from the fact that Chrysler's
present status promotes an in
efficient distribution of Ameri
ca's scarce resources. Pre
sently, the supply of cars far
exceeds the demand for cars in
our country. If this gap per
sists, Chrysler will never re
cover, and the government in
fusion of cash will be useless.
Yet, if the gap narrows from
an increase in demand,
Chrysler will survive, but
Americans will again lose, sim
ply because of a lack of
gasoline to drive those newly
ordered automobiles.
The above argument de
pends upon two facts:
1) There will be more than
enough competition in the
auto industry after the demise
of Chrysler, ably provided both
by the elastic nature of the de
mand curve and by foreign
manufacturers eager to under
sell CM and Ford.
2) Americans face a severe
energy crisis, and a reduction

in the production of excess
cars could only help to alleviate
the vital problem.
Furthermore, the resources
now used by Chrysler will not
be wasted. The raw materials
will either be used elsewhere,
or, better still, conserved. The
plants can be converted. Best
of all, however, is the prospect
for former Chrysler
employees. '
Rather than working in the
monotony and drudgery of a
production line, some
employees could start their
own small businesses with
guaranteed loans, given to the
workers, rather than a mega
corporation.
Others, led perhaps by
Chrysler's present manage
ment, could aid society im
mensely by converting plants
to the production of safe and
fuel-efficient mass transit sys
tems. Design engineers, fi
nally, could be of great use in
the development of solar
powef designs.
These are only a few of many
possible reallocation plans.
Their institution would be de
manding, only because the
problem is demanding. If our
politicians are incapable of ful
filling those demands, then I
suggest we need more creative
politicians.
The essence of Congress'
decision should involve
economic theory, or the real
location of the resources once
used by a now ailing, misman
aged and ultimately superflu
ous corporation. If, however,
politicians decide to approve
the proposed loan guarantee,
it would be a sad testimony to
the power held by tunnel
visioned special-interest
groups during election years.
