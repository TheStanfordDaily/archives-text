## The
						union is a solution 
### 
This column is in response to Mildred
Nilsson's statements to the campus community
and myself (Daily, Nov. 5).
Workers have been betrayed by their union
leaders. I can talk about strong-arm tactics by
waterfront longshoremen, can talk about jimmy
Hoffa and Frank Fitzsimmons delivering the
Teamsters Union to the Mafia, can talk about the
head of the United Auto Workers accepting a
board chair from General Motors.
I can also talk about my uncle, who with other
black truckers, was denied acceptance into the
Teamsters rank and file.
But I can also talk about the loom workers at
J.P. Stevens, whose sheets may cover the bed
Nilsson sleeps on, and their continuing and
sometimes heart-breaking efforts to unionize.
Unions are not the end-all, be-all. But unions
can be as forceful as the people in them.
If all the secretaries in this country struck, the
government and the private sector, I believe,
would be on their knees.
If there is a union of clerical workers at Stan
ford, and we have our elected officials, I would
expect them to deliver a fair-to-all-parties set
tlement. And if they do not, if they bankrupt our
efforts, or obscure the facts that pertain to us,
we can get rid of them.
We can demand a change in leadership. We
can refuse to be led by the hand. Getting a union
does not mean abdicating our responsibility. It
would be our collective decision.
Nilsson in a letter to me would suggest that all
who sympathize with the union organizing are,
(her quotation) "... a bunch of screaming
meemies and young secretaries with practically
no experience and very little training who want
to start at the top."
There are secretaries with more years than

mineand hers who have signed theirblue cards.
I don't see Nilsson offering us any
other solutions.
I hope that the possibility of striking will not
arise. But nothing worthy can be achieved with
out some struggle.
As the daughter who ate those peanut butter
sandwiches for dinner, I think that any
semblance of martyrdom, in the home or the
office, is no badge of honor, courage, growth or
achievement. My mother kept us together, but
at the price, sometimes, of her own self worth.
As I look back on that similar episode in my
family, I feel pain for her.
As a parting word in her letter to me, Nilsson
questioned my motives for staying at Stanford.
I have a BA degree in Radio-TV Journalism.
High-sounding perhaps, but the industry is glut
ted.
Most of the young women in my graduating
class of 1976 are married, working at jobs like
mine, or going for their Master's degree in not
Journalism, but Business Administration.
Granted, some of my classmates have made it,
but their toe-hold is usually $600-700 to start.
Minus taxes, where would I be? With my bills
and my responsibilities to myself?
I would take Stanford gladly for the time be
ing. It is a lot better than the overly qualified jobs
I applied for just to survive after college (after
all, I didn't have the downy cushion of my pa
rents footing the bills). Mv first job after college
was a 7-11 clerk/cashier.
The lie is that we single women have it good.
We don't. Whether divorced or "spinster," we
have problems making ends meet and balancing
our checkbooks.
A union is a solution.
