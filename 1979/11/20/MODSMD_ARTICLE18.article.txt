Band 'out of tune'
At the Big Game on Saturday
I was among a party of people
who came from various parts of
the country, and from various
academic backgrounds. None
of them had ever been to a
Stanford game before.
They all agreed on one thing.
The Stanford Band may have
had its place as a symbol of the
'60s, but it is pathetically out of
tune with today. A typical
comment was "It looks rather
like an inept high school band
when the leader is out of the
practice hall." The band is silly,
shoddy and ineffective.
I know from talking to many
of my fellow seniors in en
gineering that a majority of
Stanford students are ashamed
of the Band, and wish it would
at least try to perform its func
tion, which is to focus fans' en
thusiasm musically.
In contrast, the Cal band was
alert all the time, with a burst of
musical support in tight spots.
The pathetic attempt at
humor in the broadcast com
mentary during half-time was
ludicrously bad. The Band
must realize that offensiveness
is not wit, sloppiness is not

smartness, and gaucheness
does not make up for lack of
talent and imagination.

Nicaragua
I enjoyed reading Dave
Rugh's article (Daily, Nov. 14)
on Nicaragua. It was well writ
ten and was on the whole
favorable to Nicaragua. Unfor
tunately there were a few
major factual errors and since
he was quoting me, I should
correct them:
First, the split between the
three tendencies (not parties)
of the Sandinista National Lib
eration Front (FSLN) arose in
1975 â€” not after their victory!
The FSLN reunited ranks in an
'organic fusion' in March 1979
and have maintained a tight
cohesion to the oresent day.
Second, I did not refer to
the Terceristas as "conserva
tive Social Democrats . . . "
There is a separate Social
Democratic Party in Nicaragua
that has no association with the
Sandinistas.
There were a few other
minor mistakes in emphasis
concerning the land reform,
the ultra-leftist organizations

etc. . . but I will not bother
correcting all of them.
I should add that I am glad
the Daily printed an article
favorable to the new Sandinista
government. They are more
than worthy of our full support
and respect.

'Student' union?
I've been reading Mark
Breier's articles on Tresidder
Union with interest, and can
lend support to his belief that
the "student" union is not re
ally.for the students.
I coordinate the Freshman
Seminar program and was de
lighted when an instructor cal
led and asked if I could arrange
a room for her class that would
be appropriate for a "potluck"
get-together. This is just the
type of interaction between fa
culty and students that resi
dential education programs
are designed to encourage,
and which do not take place on
this campus nearly often
enough.
So I called Tresidder to try to

arrange a pleasant meeting
room where it could happen. I
was informed that Tresidder is
not a "student" union. It's a
"Community" union, and stu
dents or any other member of
the "community" are not wel
come to meet there unless they
purchase their food from the
Tresidder catering service! Not
only not welcome, but not al
lowed to meet there.
A rather musty room in the
clubhouse (with 30 footlock
ers along one wall) in the
"old" student union is availa
ble, and the get-together will
take place but not in the
"community" union, because
a group of students and a fa
culty member gathering to
gether don't meet Tresidder's
criteria of "community."

Blue cards
We the undersigned are rep
resentatives of concerned par
ties in the Old Union who are
interested in clerical workers
being recognized by Stanford
University as a formal bargain
ing unit.
We are tired of waiting. We
need action now!

What each of us as clerical
workers can do:
1. Sign the blue card and send
it to the USE office.
2. Take responsibility for
yourself and for your interests.
No one can do it for you.
Signing the blue card at this
point means that you are ask
ing a body of people to repre
sent you in a bargaining unit to
representatives of Stanford
University.
Are there changes you
would like to see made?
Change begins with the indi
vidual.
Act now!
Remember, the blue card is
confidential. Management will
not see it.
We suspect that other cleri
cal workers are as disap
pointed as we are. Cet off the
dime and send in your blue
cards.
