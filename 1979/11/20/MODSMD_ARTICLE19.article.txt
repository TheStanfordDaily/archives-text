## Crisp 'living with style' 
### 
It is hard to imagine what ad
vice on life-style you can get
from a man who has spent
most of his life in a one-room
apartment in London, who
worked as an unsuccessful
free-lance writer and artist's
model and who on his tax
torms describes himself as "a
retired waif."
Quentin Crisp thinks he has
useful advice and San Fran
cisco audiences are willing to
pay $6 to hear it.
An Evening with Quentin Crisp
at American Conservatory
Theatre's Marines Memorial
Theatre was, to use Crisp's
own words, "a consultation
with a doctor who is sicker than

you are.
Who is Crisp? It was his au
tobiographical book and play,
The Naked Civil Servant, which
thrust him into the limelight.
The play, produced by British
television, is about Crisp's life
on the fringes of London soci
ety in the 1930s as an open
homosexual at a time when it
was not acceptable. His book
details the constant harass
ment that beset the author,
who appeared in public with
flaming red henna hair, rouged
cheeks, glossed lips and long,
tapered, painted fingernails.
Now, Crisp tours the United
States speaking to audiences
and preaching his gospel, to
put style in your life and to cure
you of excessive freedom.
Dressed in a black velvet suit
with matching scarf adorned
with a brooch, he looked much
younger than his 71 years as he
talked about his philosophy of
life.
"There is too much free
dom in the world today," he
said as he recalled his past
when the contrary was true.
Too much freedom for Crisp
"means that you never put
yourself to the test, you never
have to make a decision."
To enjoy life you have to re
strict yourself so that your
energies are not dissipated.
For that you need a personal
ity, not simply keeping up with
the Joneses. You have to de
velop what Crisp calls "style."
"Style" is not a way of de
corating yourselt but "discard
ing everything that does not
represent you." To find style
you have to look inside.
Here is some of Crisp's ad

vice.
Rather than washing your
dishes or cleaning your room,
the two things that Crisp never
does, you should spend some
time thinking about yourself
each day. "After three years,"
claims Crisp, "the dirt does not
get any worse."
The best to approach life
is to become an exhibitionist
said Crisp. He is an
exhibitionist par excellence.
If you have to work, you
should work with people and
not things. It is you that has to
be in the limelight and not your
work. So, never become a
sculptor since everyone rec
ognizes "a Henry Moore" but
not Henry Moore.
Most importantly, you
should keep a diary to keep a
perspective on your past life.

To make sure you remember
your thoughts and feelings.
Listening to Crisp one gets
the feeling that he should not
shout his philosophy too loud
or nobody will listen, his voice
will be drowned in the voices
of others. It is a philosophy he
ought not, for his own sake,
share with others. How many
exhibitionists can the world
support? If there were not the
masses that are satisfied with

the work ethic where would
Crisp be? Many questions
seem unanswered in the
philosophy ot keeping yourself
above the madding crowd.
Does Crisp's "style" really
have substance, as he claims?
What price should one pay
for personal glory especially
for glory that does not appear
to go any deeper than the
makeup on Crisp's face?
