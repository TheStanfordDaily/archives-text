# Students call for change in policy on Iran
## 
### Andrea James 
Students at a rally here yesterday
criticized the U.S. government lor al
lowing the shah of Iran to remain in
America, for planning to deport
many Iranian students and tor previ
ously supporting the shah.
The non-violent gathering, spon
sored by the newly formed Students
Against Military Intervention in Iran,
attracted, about 200 students.
Calling Carter's order tor deporta
tion of Iranian students who have
violated the terms of their visas "un
justified harassment" and "an act of
pure vengeance," one speaker
urged the president to rescind his
order because "it makes innocent
Iranians in the United States into
scapegoats."
"The only Iranian who does not
deserve to be in our country is the
ex-shah himself," said Robert

Blecker, graduate student in
economics, speaking on behalf of
the group.
"The shah must leave the United
States, and he must somehow be
brought to justice tor his crimes,"
Blecker said, to loud applause from
the audience.
Iranian history
Blecker and another speaker,
graduate student in political science
Gary Chapman, talked tor nearly halt
an hour on the history o! the Iranian
government since World War II
when the shah began strengthening
his power.
Chapman cited such incidents as
the mass purge in the early 1950s
when the foreign minister was exe
cuted for advocating the establish
ment of a republic, 5000 members ot
the Iranian communist party were ar
rested, 40 were executed and more

than 200 were given life sentences in
prison.
He also recalled the years 1971 to
1976 when Iranian society changed
rapidly with the growing oil market
and dissent began to increase among
previous shah supporters.
Torture
"The shah's prisons were filled to
capacity and thousands died of the
most horrible kinds of torture,"
Chapman said. "Torture went on
around the clock."
He said the shah did nothing to
stop the torture, executions and
murders being carried out by fanati
cal royalists who took over the inter
nal intelligence organization in Iran.
During this period, he said, the
United States supported the shah
with money, weapons and political
power.
Between 1972 and 1977, the shah

spent more than $14 billion on U.S.
military hardware, collecting some ol
the most advanced military weapons
systems in the world, Chapman said.
"Americans must realize that the
shah's history ot terror, repression
and murder — and the United
States' support of the shah's
regime — lies behind the current
crisis in Iran," Chapman said.
While he and other speakers did
not condone the taking of hostages
by Iranian students who seized the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran two weeks
ago, Blecker called the move "per
lectly understandable in view ot the
last 30 years' history.
"We cannot expect people in
other countries to respect our laws
and embassies when we do not re
spect their culture, institutions,
economic needs and right to sell
government," Blecker said. His
comment received immediate
applause.
The speakers also urged the Un
ited States not to intervene in the
Khomeini regime.
"Whether Khomeini is to stay or go
is something the Iranian people must
decide for themselves," Blecker told
the audience. "We cannot decide for
them."
Petitions addressed to Carter were
distributed suggesting that the Un
ited States pledge not to intervene in
Iran's internal affairs in exchange for
the release of the hostages. The peti
tion also urged that the shah not be
allowed to remain in the United
States, and that the United States not
make a military response to the em
bassy takeover.
Other speakers at the rally were
Bob Saibel, a Stanford alumnus who
recently returned to the United
States after months in Iran; Isabel
Cerney, a member of the Women's
International League of Peace and
Freedom, and Assistant Dean ot
Memorial Church Don Caughey.
