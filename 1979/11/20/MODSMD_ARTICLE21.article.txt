# Mason adds new life to old favorites
## 
### 
"I always set out to write
songs that were timeless," said
Dave Mason after his perfor
mance at Memorial Au
ditorium. He performed an en
tire set of "timeless" composi
tions Saturday, focusing on
hits from the many phases of
his career. Though it would
have been nice to hear some
new material, this wasn't just
another evening of greatest
hits. Mason brought new
energy to old material in a way
many artists fail to do.
After a warmly received set
by ex-Steppenwolf vocalist
John Kay, Mason opened with
"Feelin' All Right," a classic
from his days with Traffic, then
had the audience singing along
on "Share Your Love." The rest
of the set featured more famil
iar tunes, including "Only You
Know and I Know," "You Are
Every Woman in the World,"
and a searing rendition of Dy
lan's "All Along the Wat
chtower." Mason is a blues
guitarist of impeccable taste
and his solos were invigorat
ing.

He is working on an album,
Old Crest on a New Wave.
Asked why he didn't showcase
any of these new songs, he
explained that his band had
just added a new bass player,
and "there's only a certain
amount of songs that everyone
knows right now." But, be
sides that, he likes playing the
old songs. "I think they still
stand up. Every solo I play is

new," he said.
The show's encore was a
soulful rendition of a seem
ingly soulless song, the Eagles'
"Take It to The Limit."
"That's the way the song
should be sung," Mason said.
"They (the Eagles) buried it.
"It pissed me off ... I like
the song, but I hated the way
they cut it. When you say 'take

it to the limit,' it's got to sound
like you're taking it to the
limit."
Mason didn't exactly go out
on any limbs Saturday night,
but he took the old songs to
the limit and the result was a
lively, refreshing performance
that managed to capture the
spirit of every song.
