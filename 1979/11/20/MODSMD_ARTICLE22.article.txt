# Seen by scene, 'Gaieties' is a gem
## 
### 
If you were expecting Ram's
Head's Gaieties to be an hour
or so of mindless let's-waste
weenies rah-rahism, then you
probably were disappointed.
It you were expecting Caieties
tobea full-fledged musical that
would flow from song to song
and make you forget there was
any world beyond the stage be
fore you, then you probably
also felt a little let down.
Scene by scene Gaieties did a
marvelously funny job of pok
ing gentle and endearing fun at
this school and its idiosyn

crasies. But, if you tried to fol
low the plot, it got a bit boring.
Moments stick out from the
show. The translator turns
Chris Hutchinson's flowing Ita
lian phrases into a simple "I
want your body," and Jill's
(Cwen Eagleton) words into an
Italian 1 monologue. The
members of the D.1.5.K.0.
sorority throw a party and
complain that the young stud
lies that come are impossible
to get at because they all travel
in packs. Jill and Howie (Scott
Sanford) sit at opposite ends of

the stage cradling belching
friends and singing about
meeting someone who is simi
larly disgusted with such an
uncaring social life.
The characters too were
memorable, (ill and Howie
were blond visions of All-
American sweetness, (ill's sob
song, "Catch Me as I Fall," was as
well sung as it was written,
(lyrics by Katherine Kleespies
and music by Andrew Shields).
Stu (Brian Prestwich) was
convincing at the difficult task
of being so much of a jerk he
doesn't realize what a jerk he
really is. Libby (Lauren Tuerk)
was hilarious, even as the doer
of Prol. Catatoniac's (Robert
Coleman) evil deeds.
The problem with the show
was the cohesiveness of the
script. The Ram's Head writers
are talented with scenes, songs
and lyrics, and awesome with
one-liners. But next year,
writers should think of a better
story line or be much more lib
eral in cutting their script,
however dear it may be to their
hearts.
The end of the show, how

ever, cured any attack of the
drowsies the preceding 2Vt
hours may have brought on. A
cyclone of problems hits, and
Roger (Peyton Daniel), our
poor ex-Cal student, cries out
for help. Down from the ceil
ing in a golden chair floats not
Glinda, but Fred, the good

witch of Old Union, toachorus
of cheers louder than a
thousand munchkins.
He leaves Roger clicking his
heels together and mouthing
the words "There's no place
like Stanford. There's no place
like Stanford," and suddenly
Roger is outside the stadium
on Big Came day, where every
thing is certainly "All Right
Now."
