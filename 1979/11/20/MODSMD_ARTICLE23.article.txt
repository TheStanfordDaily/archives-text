# Oliveros' sonic meditations
## 
### 
Composer Pauline
Oliveros will present an
Evening of Sonic Meditations
at 8 tonight, beginning in
Dinkelspiel. The free prog
ram will include Alea 11,
Stanford's ensemble for
new music, directed by
Robert Harvey.
"The audience should
bring pads and pillows, and
dress warmly for outdoor
meditation," Oliveros said.
Her first meditation will
greet the audience at Din

kelspiel. The performance
will move to the Quad for
"Rock Piece;" Oliveros has
chosen this space because
of the reverberation pro
duced by the surrounding
buildings. Next will be "The
Flaming Indian," which
"has no reference to the
Stanford Indian. It's dedi
cated to the memory of
Dugan Sandoval, a Navajo
singer," Oliveros said.
In "The Flaming Indian,"
musicians, including

harpsichordist Margaret
Fabrizio, will perform with a
tape recorded in an out
door setting. Oliveros asked
the performers, who were
present at a first outdoor
taping, to "reinforce men
tally" the noises they heard.
A second recording session
combined the original tape
with the musicians' "rein
forcement."
"Theoretically, the pro
cess could continue indefi
nitely," said Oliveros.
