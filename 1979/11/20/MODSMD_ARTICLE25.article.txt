# A
						merry 'Mikado'
## 
### 
Presenting a thoroughly
enjoyable evening of musi
cal comedy, the Stanford
Savoyards performed the
Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta The Mikado or the
the Town of Titipu in Din
kelspiel last weekend.
As the story of The
Mikado unfolds, we learn
that Nanki-poo, who is dis
guised as a wandering sec
ond trombone, is the son of
the mikado (the emperor of
)apan). He has fled his
father's court to avoid mar
rying Katisha, an elderly
woman of the court who has
claimed Nanki-poo as her
own, and to search for the
girl he loves, Yum-yum.
Nanki-poo finds Yum-yum
only to discover that she is
to be married to her guar
dian Koko, the Lord High
Executioner. In typical Gil
bert and Sullivan fashion, a
happy ending soon is ar
ranged.
Stephen Gill as Nanki
poo and Lorraine Myers as
Yum-yum enthralled the
audience with their superb

singing. The short, energe
tic body and lively voice of
Curtis Loer as the Lord High
Executioner brought smiles
and chuckles. John Break
well was perfect for the part
of Pooh-bah, the Lord High
Everything Else, a character
who was "born sneering,"
yet whom one cannot help
but wish to hug. Perfectly
cast as Katisha was Iris
Boudart, who in her fiery
red and purple kimono,
flashing headdress and to
wering height inspired awe.
The supporting cast, a
Chorus of Little Maids, and
a Chorus of Nobles, lent
able assistance and in them
selves provided a beautiful
display of brightly colored
kimonos and oriental vis
ages. The "Symphonius Or
chestra" under the direc
tion of Peter )affe and Anne
Heider, maintained the
pace of the performance
without overpowering the
performers. Sets, designed
by Tom Henderson, cap
tured the simplicity of a
Japanese village.
