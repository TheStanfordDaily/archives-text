# Tuckwell wows, but doesn't satisfy
## 
### 
In Dinkelspiel Auditorium
last week, Barry Tuckwell
showed why he is considered
by many critics to be at the top
of his profession. He played
with an extraordinary range of
sound effects and coaxed a
gorgeous tone quality from his
French horn in all registers.
Every note he played was
thoughtfully conceived, and
executed with total technical
command of the horn. How
ever, many pieces lacked artis
tic expression and at times the
effect was ot little more than a
well-oiled machine.
The first work, Beethoven's
Sonata, opus 17, was given a
solid performance by
Tuckwell. However, he could
barely be heard through the
piano part as he played the
rapid passages that lend flash
and style to the piece, and
further tended to be abrupt at
the end of phrases. Thus, the
overall performance unfortu
nately lacked the verve inhe
rent in Beethoven's music.
In Paul Dukas' Villanelle,
Tuckwell achieved good ba
lance between the contrasting
sections of the piece. But,
again, though he probably

played every tricky passage
flawlessly, the excitement and
the bravura were lost in the
piano accompaniment.
The best performance of the
evening was of the Robert
Schu mann Adagio and Allegro,
a very demanding piecc for the
hornist, for !.c air. - . ' never
stops playing. main
tained the movement of the
phrases in the lyrical Adagio
well, and imparted a sense of
excitement. The swift Allegro
called for great strength and
bravura, and Tuckwell did
open up and project his sound
here. The last page could have
been even stronger, but this
was clearly Tuckwell's most ef
fective piece.
The horn is a difficult in
strument to master, and
Tuckwell had clearly ac
complished as much as anyone
else to this effect. However, his
playing was generally too re
served and too smoothed-out
tobecompletelyenjoyable. He
sounded in places as though
he were just playing the music
once again. The concert was
good, but not great, because of
Tuckwell's too-cool approach.
