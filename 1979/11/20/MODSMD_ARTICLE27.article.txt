# A.P. SUMMARY
## 
### 
Ten more Americans released
Ten more American hostages were freed from
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran early this morning and
left by an Iranian airliner for Paris, the State De
partment announced. It said a U.S. Air Eorce plane
would take them from the French capital to West
Germany to join three others released yesterday.
An ABC reporter in Tehran said the hostages —
four women and six blacks — were driven from the
embassy to the airport in three cars. The students
who had been holding them in the embassy since
Nov. 4 put them on display at a news conference
last night.
A Swissair plane had been standing by at the
airport to take them to Zurich, but apparently the
Iranians decided they would travel by Iranair, the
Iranian national airline.
The list of 10 hostages released did not include
the names of Elizabeth Ann Swift, identified in
Washington as a political officer, or Katherine
Koob, who apparently still were being held de
spite the release of the other women.
Earlier yesterday, Katherine Gross, 22, of Cam
bridge Springs, Pa., a secretary in the economics
section of the embassy, and Sgts. William Quarles
of Washington, D.C., 2i, and Ladell Maples, 23, of
Earle, Ark., both black, were flown to Wiesbaden,
West Germany, where they immediately called
their families, U.S. officials said.
Iranian foreign affairs supervisor Abolhassan
Bani Sadr said yesterday in a CBS interviewthat the
remaining American hostages could not be re
leased for two months, until the seating of a new
government, unless the United States returns
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Iran. The shah is
undergoing cancer treatment in New York, and
the United States has said it will not force him to
leave.
Bani Sadr said the shah, if returned, would be
tried under Iranian law and would not be sen
tenced to death unless convicted of murder or of
causing someone's death by such means as tor
ture.
Arab summit to commence today
Tunis, Tunisia — Kings and presidents of the Arab
world are likely to reject demands Irotn a radical
minority to wage economic war against the United
States, an official said yesterday on the eve of a
three-day summit.
Delegation sources said moderates in the Arab
League formed an overwhelming majority deter
mined to resist militant demands to punish the
United States for supporting Israel and chastise
Egypt for signing a peace treaty with the Israelis.
Arab League Secretary General Chedli Khibi said
he did not expect the summit to support the de
mands of Arab militants, led by Libya, for an inten
sified boycott of Egypt and to withhold oil from the
United States.
Libyan Foreign Minister Ali Triki failed to win
approval in a ministerial meeting last week for a
special Arab summit to plan deployment of the
"'oil weapon" against the United States, but Triki
sud he would raise the matter again at the summit.
"We are not against the United States," Klibi
said. "We are against Zionism. We know the Un
ited States is Israel's ally, but what we want in the
first place is to make the American people under

stand the Arab problem."
Sadat prays for peace at Sinai
Mount Sinai, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat led a
prayer for peace at this biblical landmark where
500 dignitaries gathered yesterday to celebrate the
second anniversary of the Egyptian leader's trip to
Jerusalem.
Moslems, Christians, and Jews, as well as Zen
Buddhists and Shintoists from japan welcomed
the Egyptian leader in the mountain-ringed plain
of Raha, revered in tradition as the place where
ancient Israelites waited for Moses to carry the Ten
Commandments down from the mountain.
Sadat personally raised the Egyptian flag over
territory vacated by Israeli troops last week and
asked the "peoples of the world" to "observe the
teachings of God and the tradition of his messen
gers for the promotion of fraternity and friendship
and the elimination of bloodshed, violence and
hatred."
U.S. Ambassador Robert Strauss, who is resign
ing as Mideast envoy to run President Carter's
re-election campaign, led an official delegation of
22 Americans to the ceremony.
Sadat refrained from commenting on the Pales
tine Liberation Organization or other Arabs who
have attacked Egypt for signing the Camp David
peace pact with the United States and Israel.
Palestinian bombings wound 12
Tel Aviv, Israel — Palestinian guerrillas, in grim
reminders of their opposition to Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat's Nov. 19, 1977 peace initiative,
planted two bombs in Jerusalem yesterday and
were rebuffed in a seaborne attack on the Israeli
coast.
Police said 12 persons were wounded, most of
them slightly, when the bombs exploded 15 mi
nutes apart on two Israeli buses during the morn
ing rush hour. By late afternoon, hospital officials
said all but one of the victims had been released.
In Beirut, the Palestine Liberation Organization
claimed its terrorists planted the bombs, but made
no mention of the battle in the Mediterranean.
In one bus, a passenger discovered the bomb
and the bus driver ordered the passengers to dis
embark. He then drove to ward an empty lot but
the bomb went off at Zion Square, one of the city's
busiest crossroads.
The explosion ripped through the vehicle's rear
section, sending glass and metal splinters flying
through shop windows and the windshields of
cars parked nearby. The driver, two policemen
and one other person were injured.
In the second bombing, the device detonated
on a nearly empty bus in the Kiryat Hayovel resi
dential quarter. Police reported eight injuries.
Late Sunday, an Israeli patrol boat fought a sea
battle with Palestinian guerrillas off Israel's north
ern coast. The Israeli military command said two
guerrillas were killed and two captured.
Lane Kirkland succeeds Meany
Washington — Lane Kirkland, George Meany's
bright and faithful student for three decades, suc
ceeded his mentor as chief spokesman for or
ganized labor yesterday with a call for united

union ranks under the AFL-CIO.
Kirkland, 57, the labor federation's second-in
command for the past 10 years, was elected
unanimously as the second president in AFL-CIO
history. The position pays $110,000 a year.
His ascension to what many consider the most
influential post outside of government had been
expected because he long was known to be the
personal favorite of the retiring Meany, 85, who
stepped down after 24 years because of failing
health.
Succeeding Kirkland as AFL-CIO secretary
treasurer was Thomas Donahue, 51, a former assis
tant labor secretary and Meany's executive assis
tant for the past six years. Donahue was also
elected without opposition to the $90,000-a-year
post.
S.F. papers face antitrust suit
San Francisco — )ury selection began yesterday
in the trial of an antitrust suit against the San Fran
cisco Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle by
the Pacific Sun and other newspapers.
The Examiner is owned by the Hearst Corp. and
the Chronicle is owned by the Chronicle Publish
ing Co., and together they own the San Francisco
Newspaper Agency, which handles the non
editorial functions of both papers, including print
ing and advertising.
The Pacific Sun, a weekly in Marin County just
north of San Francisco, alleges that its San Fran
cisco edition failed five years ago because advertis
ing rates in the defendant newspapers were so
high that potential customers had no money left to
spend for ads in competing publications.
The plaintiffs contend that the agreement bet
ween thefxam/nerand Chronicle to share produc
tion facilities is not covered by the U.S. News
paper Preservation Act, which allows newspapers
serving the same cities to share production
facilities.
In addition to the Pacific Sun, other plaintiffs in
the case are International News Keyus, publisher
of the Berkeley Barb, and tour San Francisco
employment agencies who claim classified ad
rates were unfairly increased under the joint pro
duction agreement.
Stocks struggle to move higher
New York — The stock market struggled to move
higher yesterday despite worries about Iran, but
turned mixed in the final hour on reports that
Iranian authorities were asking a move from the
dollar to a "basket" of currencies for oil transac
tions.
The Dow Jones industrial average, ahead by a
couple of points for much of the day, weakened in
the late going and finished with a .43-point loss at
815.27.
But there were five advances on the New York
Stock Exchange for every four issues showing a
loss, and the NYSE's composite common-stock
index rose .25 to 59.36.

Ten more Americans released
Ten more American hostages were freed from
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran early this morning and
left by an Iranian airliner for Paris, the State De
partment announced. It said a U.S. Air Eorce plane
would take them from the French capital to West
Germany to join three others released yesterday.
An ABC reporter in Tehran said the hostages —
four women and six blacks — were driven from the
embassy to the airport in three cars. The students
who had been holding them in the embassy since
Nov. 4 put them on display at a news conference
last night.
A Swissair plane had been standing by at the
airport to take them to Zurich, but apparently the
Iranians decided they would travel by Iranair, the
Iranian national airline.
The list of 10 hostages released did not include
the names of Elizabeth Ann Swift, identified in
Washington as a political officer, or Katherine
Koob, who apparently still were being held de
spite the release of the other women.

section of the embassy, and Sgts. William Quarles
of Washington, D.C., 2i, and Ladell Maples, 23, of

United States.

approval in a ministerial meeting last week for a
special Arab summit to plan deployment of the

territory vacated by Israeli troops last week and
asked the "peoples of the world" to "observe the
teachings of God and the tradition of his messen
gers for the promotion of fraternity and friendship
and the elimination of bloodshed, violence and
hatred."
U.S. Ambassador Robert Strauss, who is resign
ing as Mideast envoy to run President Carter's
re-election campaign, led an official delegation of
22 Americans to the ceremony.
Sadat refrained from commenting on the Pales

have attacked Egypt for signing the Camp David
peace pact with the United States and Israel.
Palestinian bombings wound 12
Tel Aviv, Israel — Palestinian guerrillas, in grim
reminders of their opposition to Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat's Nov. 19, 1977 peace initiative,
planted two bombs in Jerusalem yesterday and
were rebuffed in a seaborne attack on the Israeli
coast.
Police said 12 persons were wounded, most of
them slightly, when the bombs exploded 15 mi
nutes apart on two Israeli buses during the morn
ing rush hour. By late afternoon, hospital officials
said all but one of the victims had been released.
In Beirut, the Palestine Liberation Organization
claimed its terrorists planted the bombs, but made
no mention of the battle in the Mediterranean.
In one bus, a passenger discovered the bomb
and the bus driver ordered the passengers to dis
embark. He then drove to ward an empty lot but
the bomb went off at Zion Square, one of the city's
busiest crossroads.
The explosion ripped through the vehicle's rear
section, sending glass and metal splinters flying
through shop windows and the windshields of
cars parked nearby. The driver, two policemen
and one other person were injured.
In the second bombing, the device detonated
on a nearly empty bus in the Kiryat Hayovel resi
dential quarter. Police reported eight injuries.
Late Sunday, an Israeli patrol boat fought a sea
battle with Palestinian guerrillas off Israel's north
ern coast. The Israeli military command said two
guerrillas were killed and two captured.

the Egyptian leader in the mountain-ringed plain
of Raha, revered in tradition as the place where
ancient Israelites waited for Moses to carry the Ten
Commandments down from the mountain.
Sadat personally raised the Egyptian flag over
territory vacated by Israeli troops last week and
asked the "peoples of the world" to "observe the
teachings of God and the tradition of his messen
gers for the promotion of fraternity and friendship
and the elimination of bloodshed, violence and
hatred."
U.S. Ambassador Robert Strauss, who is resign
ing as Mideast envoy to run President Carter's

Palestinian bombings wound 12
Tel Aviv, Israel — Palestinian guerrillas, in grim
reminders of their opposition to Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat's Nov. 19, 1977 peace initiative,
planted two bombs in Jerusalem yesterday and
were rebuffed in a seaborne attack on the Israeli
coast.
Police said 12 persons were wounded, most of
them slightly, when the bombs exploded 15 mi
nutes apart on two Israeli buses during the morn
ing rush hour. By late afternoon, hospital officials
said all but one of the victims had been released.
In Beirut, the Palestine Liberation Organization
claimed its terrorists planted the bombs, but made
no mention of the battle in the Mediterranean.
In one bus, a passenger discovered the bomb
and the bus driver ordered the passengers to dis
embark. He then drove to ward an empty lot but
the bomb went off at Zion Square, one of the city's
busiest crossroads.
The explosion ripped through the vehicle's rear
section, sending glass and metal splinters flying
through shop windows and the windshields of
cars parked nearby. The driver, two policemen
and one other person were injured.
In the second bombing, the device detonated
on a nearly empty bus in the Kiryat Hayovel resi
dential quarter. Police reported eight injuries.
Late Sunday, an Israeli patrol boat fought a sea
battle with Palestinian guerrillas off Israel's north
ern coast. The Israeli military command said two
guerrillas were killed and two captured.
Lane Kirkland succeeds Meany
Washington — Lane Kirkland, George Meany's
bright and faithful student for three decades, suc
ceeded his mentor as chief spokesman for or
ganized labor yesterday with a call for united

union ranks under the AFL-CIO.
Kirkland, 57, the labor federation's second-in
command for the past 10 years, was elected
unanimously as the second president in AFL-CIO
history. The position pays $110,000 a year.
His ascension to what many consider the most
influential post outside of government had been
expected because he long was known to be the
personal favorite of the retiring Meany, 85, who
stepped down after 24 years because of failing
health.
Succeeding Kirkland as AFL-CIO secretary
treasurer was Thomas Donahue, 51, a former assis
tant labor secretary and Meany's executive assis
tant for the past six years. Donahue was also
elected without opposition to the $90,000-a-year
post.
S.F. papers face antitrust suit
San Francisco — )ury selection began yesterday
in the trial of an antitrust suit against the San Fran
cisco Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle by
the Pacific Sun and other newspapers.
The Examiner is owned by the Hearst Corp. and
the Chronicle is owned by the Chronicle Publish
ing Co., and together they own the San Francisco
Newspaper Agency, which handles the non
editorial functions of both papers, including print
ing and advertising.
The Pacific Sun, a weekly in Marin County just
north of San Francisco, alleges that its San Fran
cisco edition failed five years ago because advertis
ing rates in the defendant newspapers were so
high that potential customers had no money left to
spend for ads in competing publications.
The plaintiffs contend that the agreement bet
ween thefxam/nerand Chronicle to share produc
tion facilities is not covered by the U.S. News
paper Preservation Act, which allows newspapers
serving the same cities to share production
facilities.
In addition to the Pacific Sun, other plaintiffs in
the case are International News Keyus, publisher
of the Berkeley Barb, and tour San Francisco
employment agencies who claim classified ad
rates were unfairly increased under the joint pro
duction agreement.
Stocks struggle to move higher
New York — The stock market struggled to move
higher yesterday despite worries about Iran, but
turned mixed in the final hour on reports that
Iranian authorities were asking a move from the
dollar to a "basket" of currencies for oil transac
tions.
The Dow Jones industrial average, ahead by a
couple of points for much of the day, weakened in
the late going and finished with a .43-point loss at
815.27.

Stock Exchange for every four issues showing a
loss, and the NYSE's composite common-stock
index rose .25 to 59.36.

Ten more Americans released
Ten more American hostages were freed from
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran early this morning and
left by an Iranian airliner for Paris, the State De
partment announced. It said a U.S. Air Eorce plane
would take them from the French capital to West
Germany to join three others released yesterday.
An ABC reporter in Tehran said the hostages —
four women and six blacks — were driven from the
embassy to the airport in three cars. The students
who had been holding them in the embassy since
Nov. 4 put them on display at a news conference
last night.
A Swissair plane had been standing by at the
airport to take them to Zurich, but apparently the
Iranians decided they would travel by Iranair, the
Iranian national airline.
The list of 10 hostages released did not include
the names of Elizabeth Ann Swift, identified in
Washington as a political officer, or Katherine
Koob, who apparently still were being held de
spite the release of the other women.
Earlier yesterday, Katherine Gross, 22, of Cam
bridge Springs, Pa., a secretary in the economics
section of the embassy, and Sgts. William Quarles
of Washington, D.C., 2i, and Ladell Maples, 23, of
Earle, Ark., both black, were flown to Wiesbaden,
West Germany, where they immediately called
their families, U.S. officials said.
Iranian foreign affairs supervisor Abolhassan
Bani Sadr said yesterday in a CBS interviewthat the
remaining American hostages could not be re
leased for two months, until the seating of a new
government, unless the United States returns
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to Iran. The shah is
undergoing cancer treatment in New York, and
the United States has said it will not force him to
leave.
Bani Sadr said the shah, if returned, would be
tried under Iranian law and would not be sen
tenced to death unless convicted of murder or of
causing someone's death by such means as tor
ture.
Arab summit to commence today
Tunis, Tunisia — Kings and presidents of the Arab
world are likely to reject demands Irotn a radical
minority to wage economic war against the United
States, an official said yesterday on the eve of a
three-day summit.
Delegation sources said moderates in the Arab
League formed an overwhelming majority deter
mined to resist militant demands to punish the
United States for supporting Israel and chastise
Egypt for signing a peace treaty with the Israelis.
Arab League Secretary General Chedli Khibi said
he did not expect the summit to support the de
mands of Arab militants, led by Libya, for an inten
sified boycott of Egypt and to withhold oil from the
United States.
Libyan Foreign Minister Ali Triki failed to win
approval in a ministerial meeting last week for a
special Arab summit to plan deployment of the
"'oil weapon" against the United States, but Triki
sud he would raise the matter again at the summit.
"We are not against the United States," Klibi
said. "We are against Zionism. We know the Un
ited States is Israel's ally, but what we want in the
first place is to make the American people under

stand the Arab problem."
Sadat prays for peace at Sinai
Mount Sinai, Egypt — President Anwar Sadat led a
prayer for peace at this biblical landmark where
500 dignitaries gathered yesterday to celebrate the
second anniversary of the Egyptian leader's trip to
Jerusalem.
Moslems, Christians, and Jews, as well as Zen
Buddhists and Shintoists from japan welcomed
the Egyptian leader in the mountain-ringed plain
of Raha, revered in tradition as the place where
