## 
### Nancy Silbergeld 
About 1100 students here have
signed up to participate in a fast to
day, sponsored by the Stanford
Committee on Hunger, which hopes
to raise a total of $4500 for hunger
relief organizations.
Students participating in the fast
turned in their meal cards yesterday
to University Food Service. The
hunger committee will receive food
service rebates for those students to
taling about $3000.
Several independent Row houses
and fraternities are making dona
tions ranging from $25 to $100, in
cluding Dekes, Phi Delts, Haus Mit
teleuropa, Columbae, Ham
merskjold, Synergy, Kappa Sigma,
Theta Chi, Cowell Cluster houses
and American Studies.
Two eating clubs, Los Arcos and
Breakers, have agreed to close down
completely.
"We've gotten a good response in
the other three eating clubs as well,"
said Lani Rice, member of the hunger
committee.
The committee will have booths
set up from noon to 1 p.m. today to
collect donations and distribute in
formation on hunger relief organiza
tions.
"This year's response to the fast
will probably be about the same or
better than it has been in previous
years," Rice said.

"I would guess that there is more
hunger awareness now because of
the Cambodia issue. The ironic
thing about the whole Cambodia
crisis is that on one hand, people are
shocked and disturbed by Cam
bodia, yet at the same time, people
accept the fact that all over the world
poverty and hunger are an everyday
reality for millions ot people," Rice
continued.
The money raised will go to four
organizations: Oxfam-America,
Ecumenical Hunger Program, Barrio
Assistance and Church World Ser
vice. Persons donating money can
choose which organization they wish
to contribute to. Rice estimated that
about half the money raised will goto
Oxfam-America.
The fast began at sunset yesterday
and will end at sunset tonight with a
break-fast meal at 6 p.m. in Barrister
Lounge.
"There's something wrong with a
system that accepts hunger as part of
the status quo and permits half of the
people in the world not to meet their
basic human needs," Rice com
mented.
"Ten to 20 years from now Stan
ford students will be in a position
where they can either perpetuate the
current system or make changes.
What the Committee on Hunger
wants to do is to educate people to
think more about food and hunger,"
