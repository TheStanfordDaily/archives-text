# INS to question Iranian students
## 
### Andrea James 
University officials say it is "un
likely" that the federal Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS) will
use campus facilities for interviewing
Stanford's Iranian students.
Last week, officials gave the INS
the names, phone numbers and ad
dresses of the 91 Iranian students
here on student visas. All Iranian
students must report to the INS by
Dec. 14 or face possible deportation,
according to INS officials.
"We have gotten an offer from the
INS to interview students here where
it is more convenient," explained
Robert Rosenzweig, vice-president
tor public affairs. "We would just as
soon not accept their offer."
He said the University might re
consider this decision should there
be a "major inconvenience" in stu
dents having to go to San Francisco.

INS District Director in San Fran
cisco David llchert said the offer was
extended to the University "in order
to assist the Iranian students."
"If the interviews could be effec
tively accomplished by going on
campus without disrupting campus
life, the students wouldn't have to
come through our service office in
San Francisco," he said.
During the interviews, students
will be photographed, fingerprinted
and asked detailed questions about
their academic and personal life in
the United States.
"They will be asked if they have
been arrested, what they are study
ing and what their grades are, and
they will be asked to demonstrate
that they have sufficient finances to
pursue their studies," he said.
"What further documentation will
be necessary depends on each indi

vidual case and the responses the
students give," he added.
Rosenzweig said the University is
concerned about the "fair treat
ment" and "well-being" of the stu
dents being interviewed and officials
here will ask interviewed students to
report on their meetings with the INS.
"We want to know what's going
on," Rosenzweig said.
The Stanford Libertarians met with
University administrators yesterday
morning urging them not to allow
the interviews to be held on campus.
"The University administration will
bear moral complicity in the persecu
tion of these individuals because of
their national origin it it allows these
activities in LJniversity facilities," said
Scott Olmsted, a graduate student in
engineering-enonomic systems and
a member of the Stanford Liberta
rians.
