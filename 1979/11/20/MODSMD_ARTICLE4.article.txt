# Number of staffers to be reviewed annually
## Live-ins at Bridge approved 
### Mike Vaska 
The Bridge should have live-in staf
ters because it provides 24-hour
emergency counseling to the Stan
ford community, Thomas Massey,
Director ot Student Activities, said at
a meeting yesterday morning.
The Bridge is a student-run peer
counseling and information center at
450 Campus Drive. It currently
houses four volunteer student staf
fers .
Because ot the shortage ot office
space and housing on campus, the
University recently re-examined
whether the Bridge should be given
space for live-ins.
Massey told the three live-in staf
ters who attended the meeting that
"the Bridge must maximize its use ot
the space provided by establishing a
peer counseling network" through
out the campus. Massey also called
tor the establishment ot a "better in
formation system" to record the ser
vices which the Bridge provides.
"Each spring the number ot live
ins and the amount of space alloted

to the Bridge will be reviewed," said
Massey.
He cited the shortage ot housing
and space tor student activities as the
reason tor the annual review.
Other groups on campus will un
dergo a similar review, he said. "The
way we (the University) treat one or
ganization should be the same as the
way we treat others," said Massey.
Massey stressed that student
groups on campus must justify their
need tor space.
"The real key to the issue," he
said, "is the tact that the Bridge has
the amount of space it does directly
as a result ot programs ongoing at the
Bridge."
Advisory board
Massey called lor the development
o! a peer-counseling advisory board
composed oi members trom the var
ious peer counseling groups on
campus. This group would work
through the Bridge to further
strengthen the peer counseling
programs on campus, he said.
Pete Salovey, a live-in who at
tended the meeting, said he was
"happy with the decision." A peer
counseling round table composed ot
the 10 or 12 peer counseling groups
on campus will be tormed soon, he
said.
The Bridge is also developing a
computer program to keep track of
pertinent data relating to the services
it provides, he said.
David Dorosin, head of Counsel
ing and Psychological Services at
Cowell, said the decision was tair
"because the particular nature of the
service requires live-ins."

The whole controversy has "pro
vided an opportunity to locus on
what we (the peer counseling
groups) are all about," he said.
Beth Stern, another Bridge live-in
who attended the meeting, expres
sed concern over the need to justify
the existence ot live-in statters annu
ally. Based on the difficulties the
Bridge encountered with this deci
sion, she said the review process
might take too much ot the Bridge's
time each year.
Salovey said he sees nothing
wrong with an annual review ol the
Bridge "as long as it is constructive."
"Everyone seems willing to listen to
the arguments ol the staffers at all
levels ot the University," he said.
This decision indicates that the
University tries to deal tairly with
student groups, Salovey said.
Counseling network
Massey told the group that it it es
tablished an effective peer counsel
ing network, there would be no
question that live-in staffers were
justified at the Bridge.
According to resident stafl
member Craig Goldman, the Bridge
contacted 21 other University peer
organizations to otter them Bridge
office space. None except the Gay
Counseling Group, which presently
maintains an office at the Bridge, ex
pressed need or desire for Bridge
space.
"We are 100 percent behind estab
lishing a network ol peer organiza
tions using the Bridge house as a
coordinating center," Goldman said.
