# New nuclear recycling technique developed
## 
### Mike Vaska 
A nuclear waste recycling process
that promises to be environmentally
safe and proliferation resistant is
being commercially developed by
the Sierra Nuclear Corporation of
Redwood City.
The process, which results in a 30-
fold reduction of nuclear waste vol
ume when compared to current
waste disposal methods, was in
vented in 1969 by two Stanford pro
tessors, Robert Anderson and Nor
man Parlee.
Anderson, working under Parlee,
discovered the process, which was
the subject ot his Ph.D. thesis at Stan
tord. Parlee and Anderson, who now
teaches at San Jose State, have as
signed one third of any future patent
royalties to the University.
The high temperature tin-nitride
process uses a bath ot molten tin to
dissolve spent luel elements from a
nuclear reactor, completely seperat
ing highly radioactive wastes from
useable fuel.
Spent nuclear fuel now stored in
the United States contains energy
equivalent to $30 billion worth of oil
at current prices. It the tin-nitride
process were widely applied, most of
this energy could be recovered.

The tin-nitride process is done in
batches. This permits very precise
monitoring of both input and output
and produces mainly solid waste.
This solid waste residue can be eas
ily encapsulated and stored, with a
tar shorter radioactive half-life than
present nuclear garbage.
In the past decade, more than 200
experiments here have supported
this basic approach of applying high
temperature metallurgy to solving
nuclear waste problems.
Sierra Nuclear, which is now ob
taining $30 million from private
sources for commercial develop
ment ot the process, hopes to have
positive test results by December
from experiments being conducted
at Battelle Laboratories in Columbus,
Ohio, according to Richard Dorst, di
rector of the program.
"Within three years, we hope to
prove the process on a large scale,"
Dorst said. A pilot plant will be con
structed at Battalle to tacilitate (his,
he added.
The cost of a full-scale processing
plant using the tin-nitride method
would cost $50 million, a small trac
tion of the $1 billion that a Purex
plant would cost, Dorst said.
