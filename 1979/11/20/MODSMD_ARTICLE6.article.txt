# Robert Truax turns government surplus into spaceship
## 
### Helen Casabona 
While most people are satisfied
with building treehouses, patios
or barbecues in their back yards,
Robert Truax is building a rocket.
The 25-foot high contraption
looms over the rooftop of the
Stanford graduate's home in
Saratoga.
Truax, with more than 40 years
of rocket engineering experience,
built the space cycle used by Evel
Knievel to jump the Snake River
Canyon. Knievel never made it to
the other side, but when he
climbed out of his wreck on the
canyon floor he said to Truax,
"Bob, that's got to be an awful
hard act to follow. What else do
you have up your sleeve?"
Backyard project
That's when Truax pulled out
his backyard-based Project Private
Enterprise, a private space project
designed to put one man 50 miles
up into space and bring him back
down. According to Truax, it's a
"minimal mission," buf the rocket
is recoverable and reuseable.
This project is privately fi
nanced and carried out.
"It's so private it's done in my
own garage!" he said.
Financing this project has been
the biggest problem encountered
so far by Truax. He is hoping to

launch the rocket in the summer
of 1981 but he needs $1 million to
complete it. Fie has paid for over
halt of the project on his own.
"I'll do anything to get this pro
ject financed, including painting
the rocket like a Coke bottle," he
said.
Old government parts
Truax buys the parts for his
spaceship through government
catalogs. Its nosecone used to be
the tail end of a plane and several
of its other parts are from the Nike
missile and B-52 Bomber. These
parts are in excellent condition,
but, because they are left over
from the technology of the 19605,
Truax can buy them at incredible
bargains.
For example, four engines that
cost the government $25 million
cost him $36 each.
Said Truax, "It cost me more to
buy the handbooks to learn to run
the darn things than it did to buy
them."
According to Truax, "The cost
of a rocket is independent of its
size." Since nearly 99 percent of
the cost is in the engineering and
processing, a large rocket does
not cost much more than a small
one.
For example, the first three
stages of the Saturn rocket com

prised 96 percent of its entire size,
but they cost the same as the
other 4 percent of the ship.
No government support
The government is not support
ing his project in any way and, ac
cording to Truax, has "taken no
official notice of us."
The rocket is appropriately
named, "Arriba" — a Spanish
word meaning "up." It is 25 feet
long, 25 inches in diameter and
carries only one astronaut. Origi
nally, Knievel was to fly in the roc
ket but, said Truax, "Evel lost in
terest in the project while he was
in the pokey."
Also, "Knievel would demand
millions of dollars to do a stunt
like this, but there are 150 as
tronauts who will do it for free,"
he added.
The astronaut will be enclosed
in a capsule pressurized to one
atmosphere, the pressure at sea
level. Since the rocket is run en
tirely by remote control, he has
only to "sit there and shake in his
boots" said Truax.
"It's the closest thing to a
one-man space program you're
ever gonna find," he said.
But when asked if he has consi
dered going up in the rocket him
self, Truax responded, "What do
you think I am, some kind of nut?"

in a capsule pressurized to one
atmosphere, the pressure at sea
level. Since the rocket is run en
tirely by remote control, he has
only to "sit there and shake in his
boots" said Truax.
"It's the closest thing to a
one-man space program you're
ever gonna find," he said.
But when asked if he has consi
dered going up in the rocket him
self, Truax responded, "What do
you think I am, some kind of nut?"

Robert Truax is the story of Salvage One come to life —he is building his own rocket. He says he has 150 volunteers
who all want to try out his rocket, free of charge.
While most people are satisfied
with building treehouses, patios
or barbecues in their back yards,
Robert Truax is building a rocket.
The 25-foot high contraption
looms over the rooftop of the
Stanford graduate's home in
Saratoga.
Truax, with more than 40 years
of rocket engineering experience,
built the space cycle used by Evel
Knievel to jump the Snake River
Canyon. Knievel never made it to
the other side, but when he
climbed out of his wreck on the
canyon floor he said to Truax,
"Bob, that's got to be an awful
hard act to follow. What else do
you have up your sleeve?"
Backyard project
That's when Truax pulled out
his backyard-based Project Private
Enterprise, a private space project
designed to put one man 50 miles
up into space and bring him back
down. According to Truax, it's a
"minimal mission," buf the rocket
is recoverable and reuseable.
This project is privately fi
nanced and carried out.
"It's so private it's done in my
own garage!" he said.
Financing this project has been
the biggest problem encountered
so far by Truax. He is hoping to

launch the rocket in the summer
of 1981 but he needs $1 million to
complete it. Fie has paid for over
halt of the project on his own.
"I'll do anything to get this pro
ject financed, including painting
the rocket like a Coke bottle," he
said.
Old government parts
Truax buys the parts for his
spaceship through government
catalogs. Its nosecone used to be
the tail end of a plane and several
of its other parts are from the Nike
missile and B-52 Bomber. These
parts are in excellent condition,
but, because they are left over
from the technology of the 19605,
Truax can buy them at incredible
bargains.
For example, four engines that
cost the government $25 million
cost him $36 each.
Said Truax, "It cost me more to
buy the handbooks to learn to run
the darn things than it did to buy
them."
According to Truax, "The cost
of a rocket is independent of its
size." Since nearly 99 percent of
the cost is in the engineering and
processing, a large rocket does
not cost much more than a small
one.
For example, the first three
stages of the Saturn rocket com

prised 96 percent of its entire size,
but they cost the same as the
other 4 percent of the ship.
No government support
The government is not support
ing his project in any way and, ac
cording to Truax, has "taken no
official notice of us."
The rocket is appropriately
named, "Arriba" — a Spanish
word meaning "up." It is 25 feet
long, 25 inches in diameter and
carries only one astronaut. Origi
nally, Knievel was to fly in the roc
ket but, said Truax, "Evel lost in
terest in the project while he was
in the pokey."
Also, "Knievel would demand
millions of dollars to do a stunt
like this, but there are 150 as
tronauts who will do it for free,"
he added.
The astronaut will be enclosed
in a capsule pressurized to one
atmosphere, the pressure at sea
level. Since the rocket is run en
tirely by remote control, he has
only to "sit there and shake in his
boots" said Truax.
"It's the closest thing to a
one-man space program you're
ever gonna find," he said.
But when asked if he has consi
dered going up in the rocket him
self, Truax responded, "What do
you think I am, some kind of nut?"
