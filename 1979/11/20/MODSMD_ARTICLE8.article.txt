# Ehrlich: continuous growth is 'cancer' in technological society
## 
### Jiri Weiss First of two parts 
"The diversity of non-human
organisms and the genetic, cul
tural and technological diver
sity of our own species are cru
cial to the future health, hap
piness and perhaps survival of
humanity," writes Paul Erlich in
an essay that has won him the
$10,000 Mitchell Prize for 1979.
Ehrlich, a professor of popu
lation biology here, is well
known for his bestseller, The
Population Bomb, a book that
brought him international at
tention. He has had that atten
tion ever since and has become
one of the most visible
spokesmen for ecology, zero
population growth and aid to
the Third World.
The Mitchell Prize is
awarded annually to those
"demonstrating the highest
degree of creativity in design
ing workable strategies to
achieve sustainable
societies."

The bearded Ehrlich seems
quite relaxed, but his work
schedule points to that of a
workaholic. He says that dur
ing the week he is a population
biologist studying how plant
populations protect them
selves from insects, while his
weekends are spent on social
problems.
Talking with Ehrlich, one is
likely to be overwhelmed not
only by the gloomy picture of
the future that he paints, but
also by the good humor with
which he can do it.
It was Ehrlich who back in
1968 pointed out that at what
was then the rate of population
growth, world population
would double every 35 years.
On that point he is much more
optimistic today, conceding
that in the case of the United
States at least, he and many
demographers have been
proven wrong.
In the mid-1970s the repro
ductive rate in the U.S. has fal
len below replacement level. If
the level continues and there is
no immigration, there will be
an eventual decrease in the
population.

Ehrlich and ecologists like
him have had a great impact on
environmental issues. "We
have many people pounding
into the government the im
portance of environmental
concerns. The environment
may still be going faster than 10
years ago when environmental
issues were not a concern, but
at least politicians are paying
lip service to it," Ehrlich says.
Ehrlich has been labeled as a
pessimist, but he disagrees
with this label. "I think it is
possible for us to solve our
problems; in that sense I am an
optimist. I am a pessimist in the
sense that I think it is very un
likely that we are going to," he
said.
The primary constraints on
growth will be the ecosystem,
which performs essential
"public service" functions that
maintain the quality of the at
mosphere, recycle nutrients
and dispose of wastes. Ehrlich
sees the current energy crisis
as a crisis of too much energy
rather than a shortage.
Ehrlich's strategy for survival
is drastic reform of Western
growth-oriented society to
turn it into what he calls a "sus
tainable society."
"Nothing could be more im
practical than the gross manic
society we have today. Con
tinuous growth is the creed of
the cancer cell and the creed of
most of the idiots that run our
society and may lead to the de
struction of everything."
"Trying fully to understand a
natural ecosystem is like trying
to unravel the complexities ofa
giant computer that someone
else has built, "writes Ehrlich in
his essay. The problem is that
this computer cannot be disas
sembled for study and is con
stantly evolving. Our know
ledge does not allow us to pre
dict what can be safely dis
turbed.
)ust as genetic diversity ena
bles species to survive drastic
changes in the environment,
the richness of cultures ena
bles us to solve human prob
lems.
There are cultures like the
stone-age culture of the Tassa
day in the Philippines that do
not know aggression of indi
viduals against one another.
"Dare we wipe out the cul
ture of the Tassaday when we
have not solved our basic prob

lems?" Ehrlich said in the inter
view. He says he does not have
much faith in Western
technological society and that
he believes Western society,
on the whole, has had a detri
mental effect on other cul
tures.
Ehrlich says that most people
assume that Western culture
and progress are good for
everybody. "They believe it
would be criminal to restrain

'/ think that fundamental solutions of human
problems today fall more and more out of
the range of what is considered practical
and into the range of what most people
would consider idealistic/

the spread of technology and
progress which plows under
ecosystems and offers short
term solutions that will kill us
in the long term," he said.
"Is it the task of Western cul
ture, as the missionaries
started to do, to see to it that
naked bodies are clothed?
"If we do not find the ar
rangement between the sexes
in another culture to our liking,
is it our role to go in and
change it?" Ehrlich asks.
Ehrlich says he is distressed
by what he sees as the "caving
in to the West" in developing
countries like China who want
Western technology and
know-how.
What Ehrlich would like to
see is a world federation where
cultural and ethnic differences
would be tolerated if they

would not violate "ground
rules" of human behavior that
would ensure that "nobody is
stomped on."
"This is incredibly idealis
tic," admits Ehrlich, "but I
think that fundamental solu
tions of human problems today
fall more and more out of the
range of what is considered
practical and into the range of
what most people would con
sider idealistic."

Ehrlich sees the situation be
tween the U.S. and Mexico — a
large, rich nation and a poor
nation — as a microcosm of the
problems facing the rest of the
world. Ehrlich has devoted a
whole book, The Golden Door,
which was published recently,
to the relation between the two
countries.
Mexico is a country where
almost half the population is
under the age of 15. There is
hideous unemployment, and
the gap between the rich and
the poor is growing. More
people from Mexico want to
immigrate to the U.S. at a time
when the U.S. wants them less
and less.

tion problems.)

Paul Ehrlich
"The diversity of non-human
organisms and the genetic, cul
tural and technological diver
sity of our own species are cru
cial to the future health, hap
piness and perhaps survival of
humanity," writes Paul Erlich in
an essay that has won him the
$10,000 Mitchell Prize for 1979.
Ehrlich, a professor of popu
lation biology here, is well
known for his bestseller, The
Population Bomb, a book that
brought him international at
tention. He has had that atten
tion ever since and has become
one of the most visible
spokesmen for ecology, zero
population growth and aid to
the Third World.
The Mitchell Prize is
awarded annually to those
"demonstrating the highest
degree of creativity in design
ing workable strategies to
achieve sustainable
societies."

The bearded Ehrlich seems
quite relaxed, but his work
schedule points to that of a
workaholic. He says that dur
ing the week he is a population
biologist studying how plant
populations protect them
selves from insects, while his
weekends are spent on social
problems.
Talking with Ehrlich, one is
likely to be overwhelmed not
only by the gloomy picture of
the future that he paints, but
also by the good humor with
which he can do it.
It was Ehrlich who back in
1968 pointed out that at what
was then the rate of population
growth, world population
would double every 35 years.
On that point he is much more
optimistic today, conceding
that in the case of the United
States at least, he and many
demographers have been
proven wrong.
In the mid-1970s the repro
ductive rate in the U.S. has fal
len below replacement level. If
the level continues and there is
no immigration, there will be
an eventual decrease in the
population.

Ehrlich and ecologists like
him have had a great impact on
environmental issues. "We
have many people pounding
into the government the im
portance of environmental
concerns. The environment
may still be going faster than 10
years ago when environmental
issues were not a concern, but
at least politicians are paying
lip service to it," Ehrlich says.
Ehrlich has been labeled as a
pessimist, but he disagrees
with this label. "I think it is
possible for us to solve our
problems; in that sense I am an
optimist. I am a pessimist in the
sense that I think it is very un
likely that we are going to," he
said.
The primary constraints on
growth will be the ecosystem,
which performs essential
"public service" functions that
maintain the quality of the at
mosphere, recycle nutrients
and dispose of wastes. Ehrlich
sees the current energy crisis
as a crisis of too much energy
rather than a shortage.
Ehrlich's strategy for survival
is drastic reform of Western
growth-oriented society to
turn it into what he calls a "sus
tainable society."
"Nothing could be more im
practical than the gross manic
society we have today. Con
tinuous growth is the creed of
the cancer cell and the creed of
most of the idiots that run our
society and may lead to the de
struction of everything."
"Trying fully to understand a
natural ecosystem is like trying
to unravel the complexities ofa
giant computer that someone
else has built, "writes Ehrlich in
his essay. The problem is that
this computer cannot be disas
sembled for study and is con
stantly evolving. Our know
ledge does not allow us to pre
dict what can be safely dis
turbed.
)ust as genetic diversity ena
bles species to survive drastic
changes in the environment,
the richness of cultures ena
bles us to solve human prob
lems.
There are cultures like the
stone-age culture of the Tassa
day in the Philippines that do
not know aggression of indi
viduals against one another.
"Dare we wipe out the cul
ture of the Tassaday when we
have not solved our basic prob

lems?" Ehrlich said in the inter
view. He says he does not have
much faith in Western
technological society and that
he believes Western society,
on the whole, has had a detri
mental effect on other cul
tures.
Ehrlich says that most people
assume that Western culture
and progress are good for
everybody. "They believe it
would be criminal to restrain

'/ think that fundamental solutions of human
problems today fall more and more out of
the range of what is considered practical
and into the range of what most people
would consider idealistic/

the spread of technology and
progress which plows under
ecosystems and offers short
term solutions that will kill us
in the long term," he said.
"Is it the task of Western cul
ture, as the missionaries
started to do, to see to it that
naked bodies are clothed?
"If we do not find the ar
rangement between the sexes
in another culture to our liking,
is it our role to go in and
change it?" Ehrlich asks.
Ehrlich says he is distressed
by what he sees as the "caving
in to the West" in developing
countries like China who want
Western technology and
know-how.
What Ehrlich would like to
see is a world federation where
cultural and ethnic differences
would be tolerated if they

would not violate "ground
rules" of human behavior that
would ensure that "nobody is
stomped on."
"This is incredibly idealis
tic," admits Ehrlich, "but I
think that fundamental solu
tions of human problems today
fall more and more out of the
range of what is considered
practical and into the range of
what most people would con
sider idealistic."

Ehrlich sees the situation be
tween the U.S. and Mexico — a
large, rich nation and a poor
nation — as a microcosm of the
problems facing the rest of the
world. Ehrlich has devoted a
whole book, The Golden Door,
which was published recently,
