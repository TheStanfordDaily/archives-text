# Women's Studies major proposed
## 
### Kati Andreasson 
Ten years after the first Women's Studies
program was instituted in this country, the Uni
versity will get its first proposal for a major in
Women's Studies. This issue was discussed at a
women's studies forum last Wednesday,
headed by graduate student Gary Goodman.
At the present time, there is no set "program"
enabling a student to concentrate in this area;
there are only individual courses offered by
SWOPSI and by certain professors.
The purpose of introducing such a major is
essentially to ameliorate a somewhat deficient
curriculum, Goodman said. She pointed out
that the original syllabus for the three-quarter
Western Studies series did not contain one
woman writer; the same was true of the Ameri
can Literature courses.
"The woman's perspective is being neglected

and should be integrated into the present cur
riculum. We should not have to rely on
supplementary courses to fill the gap," said
Goodman.
A women's studies major may be created
using the Individually Designed Major (IDM)
program. Only one student has succeeded so
far in getting approval from the IDM board.
Most students were discouraged by the "lack
of continuity" and "semi-permanency" of the
courses they were interested in, as well as the
absence of specific guidelines and advisers in
the field.
Finally, a coterminal major involving Wo
men's Studies in conjunction with a second
major was heavily favored over a sole major in
Women's Studies. Concern was expressed over
the worth of such a major outside the Univer
sity, due to its "untraditional" nature.
