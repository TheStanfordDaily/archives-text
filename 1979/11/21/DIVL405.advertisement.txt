THERE'S NOTHING
YOIJ CAN'T WEAR
WITH FKYE BOOTS.
Frye boots arc just as comfort
a^'e fashion as they
are with a pair of jeans. And it
shows. That's because all Frye
i I JlfcJ boots have been carefully bench
crafted of the finest leathers. It's
the way we've been making boots
for more than 100 years. Kven
though our styles may change
over the years, our quality and
craftsmanship remain the same.
