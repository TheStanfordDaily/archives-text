# Red Cross may sue Med Center for breach of contract
## 
### Gary Vineberg 
A tight tor blood is being waged at
the University, a quiet light between
the Medical Center and the Ameri
can Red Cross that may end in a
million-dollar lawsuit.
Red Cross will tile a suit tor breach
ot contract unless a new agreement
to supply the University with blood
and recruit donors in the area is
reached today, said Dr. Donald
Avoy, medical director ot San Jose
Red Cross.
Avoy said the University has not
lived up to the letter and spirit ot a

contract requiring the Medical
Center to order a minimum quantity
ot blood products irom Red Cross.
Acting Medical School Dean Lawr
ence Crowley and attorney Carl
Mitchner are negotiating the Univer
sity's "luture relationship" with Red
Cross before the current contract
expires. San Jose Chapter Manager
Joe Arrington and attorney William
Kay, ol Whitmore and Kay Ltd., the
Palo Alto law tirm representing Red
Cross in the talks, were unavailable
to comment on the details ot their
demands.

On July 1, 1979, the University
acted unilaterally tn end the contract
which established the Red Cross
location, several miles irom the
Stanford University Blood Center at
J3JO Hillview Ave. in 1972. Termina
tion becomes ettective Dec. 31, and
at that point, the University will no
longer be under obligation to use
Red Cross supplies.
Avoy confirmed that Red Cross
might sue lor more than a million
dollars it a new contract is not
signed.
Current negotiations are the latest

development in the University's
worsening relationship with Red
Cross since the Department ot
Pathology decided two years ago to
reactivate donor services at the Stan
lord University Blood Bank. The
donor services had not been ottered
since 1972. Relations with Red Cross
remained civil until January 1979,
when "the climate changed ab
ruptly," said Pathology Chairman Dr.
David Korn. "I'm still not sure I un
derstand why."
The criteria tor reactivating the
donor se-vices were the special pa

tient care needs ot the Medical
Center, according to Dr. F. Carl
Crumet, director ot the transfusion
service. The bureaucratic inflexibility
of a national blood banking organiza
tion like Red Cross had made it dif
ficult to introduce new monitoring
techniques developed at the Univer
sity.
In addition, the Hillview Avenue
location, several miles from the
Medical Center "was a mistake," said
Dr. Ed Engleman, director ot the
Stanford Blood Bank. It had been
chosen tor its low cost, but because

ol its distance from the Med Center,
was less useful lor teaching pur
poses.
In contrast, blood testing through
the Staniord Blood Bank could be
done at the hospital's transfusion
service, while blood drawing could
be done at the same location as the
Hospital's Red Cross mobile unit.
But problems arose in the new ar
rangement. Until the blood bank was
expanded, the Medical Center had
purchased up to 85 percent ol its
blood trom Red Cross. This followed
the terms ot the Red Cross agree
ment, which stipulated that Red
Cross would pay statf salaries and
provideequipment tor blood collect
ing and research as long as the Uni
versity ordered a portion ot its blood
requirements trom Red Cross.
When the University appointed a
blood drive coordinator for the Stan
tord Blood Bank, more problems
arose.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
lor public affairs here, said after the
move that the policy "reflects the tact
that, for a variety of reasons, the
Stanford Medical Center is relying
more heavily than in the past on its
ability to draw blood trom members
ot the community.
However, Mike Hecht, a graduatt
student coordinator tor Red Cross
"bloodmobiles" at Escondido Vil
lage, said the move effectively barred
Red Cross trom campus.
He said that Stanford Blood Bank
recruiter Rhoda Burns asked him to
work tor the University's bank, but "I
refused to stop a successful program
in Escondido toslowly build upa new
one lor Stanford."
Hecht also charged that Stanford
Blood Bank either rejects Red Cross
requests to conduct blood drives on
campus, or gives permission but
then sets up its own unit a day or two
before the Red Cross unit is
scheduled.
Hecht said he thinks the University
is intentionally trying to drive Red
Cross trom the area by disrupting its
operations. University officials de
nied these charges.
Whatever the reasons, the Red
Cross has supplied less blood during
the last tew months to the transfu
sion service, where blood for the
Medical Center is ordered and dis
tributed.
Crumet confirmed that Red Cross
has been unable to fill many ot the
services's requests and said he must
get more blood from Peninsula
Memorial Blood Bank in Burlingame,
a member ot the American Associa
tion ot Blood Banks AABB).
Avoy retorted that the transfusion
service uses an erratic ordering pat

tern so that Red Cross cannot fill the
Stanford orders.
"This never happened when there
was a good working relationship,"
he said.
Grumet emphatically denied this
and said he has requested, but never
received, at least the minimum ratio
of blood required to successfully
carry out the terms of the Red Cross
agreement.
The transfusion service's in
creased usage ot Peninsula Memorial
has raised objection from Dr. J. Gar
rott Allen, a retired surgery professor
here, and from Red Cross. Allen's ob
jections stem trom the fact that
Peninsula Memorial charges a non
replacement tee of $20 for users of

some of its blood products. This fee
can be waived only if the patient, a
triend or a relative has given blood to
a bank that is an AABB member.
Allen also objects to the Stanford
Blood Bank because its blood, he
said, is strictly tor the use of Stanford
Hospital.
Crumet argued that Stanford
blood is available to anyone who
needs it, but admitted that it is nor
mally kept for use at the Hospital, the
second largest blood user in Califor
nia.
Red Cross, on the other hand,
sends much of the blood it collects in
northern and central California to
the Los Angeles area, where there is a
chronic shortage.
A tight tor blood is being waged at
the University, a quiet light between
the Medical Center and the Ameri
can Red Cross that may end in a
million-dollar lawsuit.

demands.

On July 1, 1979, the University
acted unilaterally tn end the contract
which established the Red Cross
location, several miles irom the
Stanford University Blood Center at
J3JO Hillview Ave. in 1972. Termina
tion becomes ettective Dec. 31, and
at that point, the University will no
longer be under obligation to use
Red Cross supplies.
Avoy confirmed that Red Cross
might sue lor more than a million
dollars it a new contract is not
signed.
Current negotiations are the latest

development in the University's
worsening relationship with Red
Cross since the Department ot
Pathology decided two years ago to
reactivate donor services at the Stan
lord University Blood Bank. The
donor services had not been ottered
since 1972. Relations with Red Cross
remained civil until January 1979,
when "the climate changed ab
ruptly," said Pathology Chairman Dr.
David Korn. "I'm still not sure I un
derstand why."
The criteria tor reactivating the
donor se-vices were the special pa

tient care needs ot the Medical
Center, according to Dr. F. Carl
Crumet, director ot the transfusion
service. The bureaucratic inflexibility
of a national blood banking organiza
tion like Red Cross had made it dif
ficult to introduce new monitoring
techniques developed at the Univer
sity.
In addition, the Hillview Avenue
location, several miles from the
Medical Center "was a mistake," said
Dr. Ed Engleman, director ot the
Stanford Blood Bank. It had been
chosen tor its low cost, but because

ol its distance from the Med Center,
was less useful lor teaching pur
poses.
In contrast, blood testing through
the Staniord Blood Bank could be
done at the hospital's transfusion
service, while blood drawing could
be done at the same location as the
Hospital's Red Cross mobile unit.
But problems arose in the new ar
rangement. Until the blood bank was
expanded, the Medical Center had
purchased up to 85 percent ol its
blood trom Red Cross. This followed
the terms ot the Red Cross agree
ment, which stipulated that Red
Cross would pay statf salaries and
provideequipment tor blood collect
ing and research as long as the Uni
versity ordered a portion ot its blood
requirements trom Red Cross.
When the University appointed a
blood drive coordinator for the Stan
tord Blood Bank, more problems
arose.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
lor public affairs here, said after the
move that the policy "reflects the tact
that, for a variety of reasons, the
Stanford Medical Center is relying
more heavily than in the past on its
ability to draw blood trom members
ot the community.
However, Mike Hecht, a graduatt
student coordinator tor Red Cross
"bloodmobiles" at Escondido Vil
lage, said the move effectively barred
Red Cross trom campus.
He said that Stanford Blood Bank
recruiter Rhoda Burns asked him to
work tor the University's bank, but "I
refused to stop a successful program
in Escondido toslowly build upa new
one lor Stanford."
Hecht also charged that Stanford
Blood Bank either rejects Red Cross
requests to conduct blood drives on
campus, or gives permission but
then sets up its own unit a day or two
before the Red Cross unit is
scheduled.
Hecht said he thinks the University
is intentionally trying to drive Red
Cross trom the area by disrupting its
operations. University officials de
nied these charges.
Whatever the reasons, the Red
Cross has supplied less blood during
the last tew months to the transfu
sion service, where blood for the
Medical Center is ordered and dis
tributed.
Crumet confirmed that Red Cross
has been unable to fill many ot the
services's requests and said he must
get more blood from Peninsula
Memorial Blood Bank in Burlingame,
a member ot the American Associa
tion ot Blood Banks AABB).
Avoy retorted that the transfusion
service uses an erratic ordering pat

tern so that Red Cross cannot fill the
Stanford orders.
"This never happened when there
was a good working relationship,"
he said.
Grumet emphatically denied this
and said he has requested, but never
received, at least the minimum ratio
of blood required to successfully
carry out the terms of the Red Cross
agreement.
The transfusion service's in
creased usage ot Peninsula Memorial
has raised objection from Dr. J. Gar
rott Allen, a retired surgery professor
here, and from Red Cross. Allen's ob
jections stem trom the fact that
Peninsula Memorial charges a non
replacement tee of $20 for users of

some of its blood products. This fee
can be waived only if the patient, a
triend or a relative has given blood to
a bank that is an AABB member.
Allen also objects to the Stanford
Blood Bank because its blood, he
said, is strictly tor the use of Stanford
Hospital.
Crumet argued that Stanford
blood is available to anyone who
needs it, but admitted that it is nor
mally kept for use at the Hospital, the
second largest blood user in Califor
nia.
Red Cross, on the other hand,
sends much of the blood it collects in
northern and central California to
the Los Angeles area, where there is a
chronic shortage.
A tight tor blood is being waged at
the University, a quiet light between
the Medical Center and the Ameri
can Red Cross that may end in a
million-dollar lawsuit.
Red Cross will tile a suit tor breach
ot contract unless a new agreement
to supply the University with blood
and recruit donors in the area is
reached today, said Dr. Donald
Avoy, medical director ot San Jose
Red Cross.
Avoy said the University has not
lived up to the letter and spirit ot a

contract requiring the Medical
Center to order a minimum quantity
ot blood products irom Red Cross.
Acting Medical School Dean Lawr
ence Crowley and attorney Carl
Mitchner are negotiating the Univer
sity's "luture relationship" with Red
Cross before the current contract
expires. San Jose Chapter Manager
Joe Arrington and attorney William
Kay, ol Whitmore and Kay Ltd., the
Palo Alto law tirm representing Red
