# Red Cross may sue Med Center for breach of contract
## 
### Gary Vineberg 
A tight tor blood is being waged at
the University, a quiet light between
the Medical Center and the Ameri
can Red Cross that may end in a
million-dollar lawsuit.
Red Cross will tile a suit tor breach
ot contract unless a new agreement
to supply the University with blood
and recruit donors in the area is
reached today, said Dr. Donald
Avoy, medical director ot San Jose
Red Cross.
Avoy said the University has not
lived up to the letter and spirit ot a

contract requiring the Medical
Center to order a minimum quantity
ot blood products irom Red Cross.
Acting Medical School Dean Lawr
ence Crowley and attorney Carl
Mitchner are negotiating the Univer
sity's "luture relationship" with Red
Cross before the current contract
expires. San Jose Chapter Manager
Joe Arrington and attorney William
Kay, ol Whitmore and Kay Ltd., the
Palo Alto law tirm representing Red
Cross in the talks, were unavailable
to comment on the details ot their
demands.

On July 1, 1979, the University
acted unilaterally tn end the contract
which established the Red Cross
location, several miles irom the
Stanford University Blood Center at
J3JO Hillview Ave. in 1972. Termina
tion becomes ettective Dec. 31, and
at that point, the University will no
longer be under obligation to use
Red Cross supplies.
Avoy confirmed that Red Cross
might sue lor more than a million
dollars it a new contract is not
signed.
Current negotiations are the latest

development in the University's
worsening relationship with Red
Cross since the Department ot
Pathology decided two years ago to
reactivate donor services at the Stan
lord University Blood Bank. The
donor services had not been ottered
since 1972. Relations with Red Cross
remained civil until January 1979,
when "the climate changed ab
ruptly," said Pathology Chairman Dr.
David Korn. "I'm still not sure I un
derstand why."
The criteria tor reactivating the
donor se-vices were the special pa

tient care needs ot the Medical
Center, according to Dr. F. Carl
Crumet, director ot the transfusion
service. The bureaucratic inflexibility
of a national blood banking organiza
tion like Red Cross had made it dif
ficult to introduce new monitoring
techniques developed at the Univer
sity.
In addition, the Hillview Avenue
location, several miles from the
Medical Center "was a mistake," said
Dr. Ed Engleman, director ot the
Stanford Blood Bank. It had been
chosen tor its low cost, but because

ol its distance from the Med Center,
was less useful lor teaching pur
poses.
In contrast, blood testing through
the Staniord Blood Bank could be
done at the hospital's transfusion
service, while blood drawing could
be done at the same location as the
Hospital's Red Cross mobile unit.
But problems arose in the new ar
rangement. Until the blood bank was
expanded, the Medical Center had
purchased up to 85 percent ol its
blood trom Red Cross. This followed
