New York (AP) — Multina
tional corporations, which
have paid out $150 million to
terrorists in the past ten years,
have become increasingly at
tractive targets because they
tend to "cave in" to demands,
says a report by a business
oriented research group.
Attacks against corporations
and their employees are on the
rise and "are now almost as
certain as rainfall," said the
Conterence Board report re
leased last week.

When executives are kid
napped, multinational corpo
rations face multi-million
dollar ransom payments. Ran
som demands in excess ot $1
million were asked tor each ol
the 12 business executives kid
napped last year, and the norm
is now $5 million to $10 million,
said the report by the non
profit group.
"Corporations can and do
cave in to demands by ter
rorists," said E. Patrick
McGuire, who headed the

year-long research project, in
explaining why business has
become a prime terrorist
target.
Government and military
personnel were popular
targets earlier in the decade
but "could not, and did not,
Cave into demands," while
corporations have paid out
$150 million to terrorists in the
past ten years, McCiuire said.
And the Conference Board
report says one result ol the
trend is a boom in sales ol ran
som insurance.
McGuire said corporations
now make hotel, airline and re
staurant reservations lot their
employees under pseudonyms
and remove identilication irom
cars, trucks and airplanes.
There were 2bt>2 reported
acts ol terrorism worldwide in
the lirst nine months ol this
year, according to the report,
with 1511 lor all ol 1978.
The live countries account
ing lor the most terrorist ac
tivities, according to the 22-
page report, were the United
States, Argentina, Italy, Col
ombia and Puerto Rico.
There were 120 reported ter
rorist attacks in the United
States last ye.u . McGuire said,
but most ol these were bomb
ings because Americans
don't take kindly lo kidnap
ping" and there is a "94 or 95
percent arrest rate." In Italy,
however, kidnapping is the
"major terrorist tactic," he
said.
