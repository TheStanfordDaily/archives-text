## Israeli expansion denounced 
### Victor Goetz 
Americans must think twice
about what they are supporting
when they send their tax dol
lars to Israel, Cal. State Fuller
ton Protessor Kamal Nafta said
last Tuesday night. Naffa, born
in lordan, spoke to 65 persons
to open Toyon's series of dis
cussions on the Middle East,
"Israel's obsession tor sec
ure borders is only an excuse
tor its expansionist ways,"
Naffa said. 'Yionism has been
a systematic means to displace
the Palestinians."
The original format lor the
program was changed when
the second speaker, political
science professor Seymour
Martin I ipset, was unable to at
tend due to a conflicting com
mitment.
A visiting protessor trom Is
rael, Gidon Czapski, did otter
his reaction as a commentator,
but the absence ot a second
prepared speech led the way
lor some emotional outbursts
irom the audience.
"Each program may not be
balanced, but the entire series
will be," said Toyon resident
lellow Daniel Okimoto. "II
there is an available commen
tator, like tonight, we want him
to present his views and reac
tions."
Emotions calmed
Emotions calmed when a
student rose and commented,
"We at Stanlord should have a
ditlerent attitude toward such
an academic issue. I am disap
pointed that the discussion has
gone to such an emotional
level."
Nat la devoted much ol his
presentation to the Palestinian
issue.
"A Palestinian state, besides
being a tultillment ol the Pales
tinian right ot sell
determination, is good lor Is
rael because it would resolve,
once and lor all, the Palestinian

question which is the crux of
'he problem," he said.
"The fundamental question
is not security, but justice,"
Natfa said. Terrorism is a reac
tion to the frustrations and
shame the Palestinians feel for
being displaced at the hands of
Israel's "unchecked expan
sion," he added.
Commentator Czapski ag
reed that a Palestinian state is
necessary, but raised the ques
tions of how and where.
"I am willing to have guaran
tees, military and otherwise,
and to give back some ter
ritories, although a divided
Jerusalem is out of the ques
tion, but PI C) and Arab leaders
are not willing to stop there,"
C/apski said.
'Biased media'
Nalta blames the "pro-Israeli
biased media" lor contributing
to world ignorance of the basic
issue, saying "those who de
plore terrorism secretly sup
port Israeli preemptive strikes
against Palestinian villages."
"It is the responsibility ot
Western journalists to help
Palestinians gain their elemen
tary rights or present an alter
native," Natfa said.
Likewise, the Camp David
accord tailed to recognize two
fundamental Palestinian
human rights — the right ot
sell-determination and the
right to live in their own land,
he said.
Nalia also said the way Camp
David divides Palestinians into
dilierent categories will bring
an end to the unity ot the Pales
tinian people.
"Camp David legitimized
continued Israeli occupation
lor many years to come, il not
indefinitely," he said.
"Why don't you say that |or
dan occupied the West Bank
lor 20 yeafs and denied the
Palest inians self
determination ?" retorted

Czapski. "In 30 years Arab
countries did nothing to help
refugees settle down."
Yet, "it these territories con
tinue under Israeli rule, the
government will have to in
crease its repressive policies,"
Natfa responded.
"The only way to gain sec
urity is to compromise and
reach an agreement, rather
than to keep military installa
tions which will be removed
anyway," he said. "The best
security tor Israel is peace."
Opportunity for peace
"Il they tail to take some
risks and seize the opportunity
there may never again be an
opportunity for peace," he
said.
According to Natta, the Arab
nations are now willing to con
cede to Israel all territories
gained betore 1967. "Arabs
have never held anti-Semitism;
this is a purely Western
phenomenon," he noted.
But Czapski questioned the
Arabs' readiness to seek peace,
"I think at the moment the
Arab leadership is less willing
to reach peace than the most
extreme ot Jewish leadershio."
"Even il the United States is
willing to accept the con
tinuance ol this situation in the
Middle East, other nations of
the world are not," said Naffa.
"No other issue has threatened
the peace ot the world as the
Middle East conilict."
Nalta suggested two plans
lor negotiation, one of which
he said should begin as soon as
possible.
hrst, a new Camp David, this
time not "excluding the Pales
tinians." Czapski was quick to
point out that they had been
invited to Camp David but re
tused.
Second, and preferable,
would be a reopening of the
suspended Geneva talks
opened in 1974.

"Each program may not be
balanced, but the entire series
will be," said Toyon resident
lellow Daniel Okimoto. "II
there is an available commen
tator, like tonight, we want him
to present his views and reac
tions."
Emotions calmed
Emotions calmed when a
student rose and commented,
"We at Stanlord should have a
ditlerent attitude toward such
an academic issue. I am disap
pointed that the discussion has
gone to such an emotional
level."
Nat la devoted much ol his
presentation to the Palestinian
issue.
"A Palestinian state, besides
being a tultillment ol the Pales
tinian right ot sell
determination, is good lor Is
rael because it would resolve,
once and lor all, the Palestinian

question which is the crux of
'he problem," he said.
"The fundamental question
is not security, but justice,"
Natfa said. Terrorism is a reac
tion to the frustrations and
shame the Palestinians feel for
being displaced at the hands of
Israel's "unchecked expan
sion," he added.
Commentator Czapski ag
reed that a Palestinian state is
necessary, but raised the ques
tions of how and where.
"I am willing to have guaran
tees, military and otherwise,
and to give back some ter
ritories, although a divided
Jerusalem is out of the ques
tion, but PI C) and Arab leaders
are not willing to stop there,"
C/apski said.
'Biased media'
Nalta blames the "pro-Israeli
biased media" lor contributing
to world ignorance of the basic
issue, saying "those who de
plore terrorism secretly sup
port Israeli preemptive strikes
against Palestinian villages."
"It is the responsibility ot
Western journalists to help
Palestinians gain their elemen
tary rights or present an alter
native," Natfa said.
Likewise, the Camp David
accord tailed to recognize two
fundamental Palestinian
human rights — the right ot
sell-determination and the
right to live in their own land,
he said.
Nalia also said the way Camp
David divides Palestinians into
dilierent categories will bring
an end to the unity ot the Pales
tinian people.
"Camp David legitimized
continued Israeli occupation
lor many years to come, il not
indefinitely," he said.
"Why don't you say that |or
dan occupied the West Bank
lor 20 yeafs and denied the
Palest inians self
determination ?" retorted

Czapski. "In 30 years Arab
countries did nothing to help
refugees settle down."
Yet, "it these territories con
tinue under Israeli rule, the
government will have to in
crease its repressive policies,"
Natfa responded.
"The only way to gain sec
urity is to compromise and
reach an agreement, rather
than to keep military installa
tions which will be removed
anyway," he said. "The best
security tor Israel is peace."
Opportunity for peace
"Il they tail to take some
risks and seize the opportunity
there may never again be an
opportunity for peace," he
said.
According to Natta, the Arab
nations are now willing to con
cede to Israel all territories
gained betore 1967. "Arabs
have never held anti-Semitism;
this is a purely Western
phenomenon," he noted.
But Czapski questioned the
Arabs' readiness to seek peace,
"I think at the moment the
Arab leadership is less willing
to reach peace than the most
extreme ot Jewish leadershio."
"Even il the United States is
willing to accept the con
tinuance ol this situation in the
Middle East, other nations of
the world are not," said Naffa.
"No other issue has threatened
the peace ot the world as the
Middle East conilict."
Nalta suggested two plans
lor negotiation, one of which
he said should begin as soon as
possible.
hrst, a new Camp David, this
time not "excluding the Pales
tinians." Czapski was quick to
point out that they had been
invited to Camp David but re
tused.
Second, and preferable,
would be a reopening of the
suspended Geneva talks
opened in 1974.
Americans must think twice
about what they are supporting
when they send their tax dol
lars to Israel, Cal. State Fuller
ton Protessor Kamal Nafta said
last Tuesday night. Naffa, born
in lordan, spoke to 65 persons
to open Toyon's series of dis
cussions on the Middle East,
"Israel's obsession tor sec
ure borders is only an excuse
tor its expansionist ways,"
Naffa said. 'Yionism has been
a systematic means to displace
the Palestinians."
The original format lor the
program was changed when
the second speaker, political
science professor Seymour
Martin I ipset, was unable to at
tend due to a conflicting com
mitment.
A visiting protessor trom Is
rael, Gidon Czapski, did otter
his reaction as a commentator,
but the absence ot a second
prepared speech led the way
lor some emotional outbursts
irom the audience.
