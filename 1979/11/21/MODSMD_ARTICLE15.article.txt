As many renowned jurists in the pasl have*
been wont lo do. allow me to irnplic itlv describe
the role of On Call by empliasi/ing what il is not.
On Call is not a mere supplement to Ihe illustri
ous Bug Ale or its nebulous sister, /'/ease \le.
Rather than concentrate on the puzzling
paradoxes ol the campus environment, I would
prefer lo delve into the more* personal realm ol
individual experience, physical and psychologi
cal intrigue and concerns.
So here's Ihe lormat. You pose me your ques
lions honestly in a way lhal may In* spicy, juicy,
humorous, entertaining or anyway that suits you
except abusive, (Monographic or offensive.
I will tlien search prohinglv lor thorough solu

omniscient Ann Landers, or ol possessing the

I'm pretty good about legulai diet and exercise.
I'm on the Ml, so I in not concerned about pre

Ihis question seemed like* a logical and en
