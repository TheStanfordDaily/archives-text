# Prof downplays immigration problem
## 
### Jiri Weiss Second of two parts 
The problem of illegal immigration Irom
Mexico "is being blown out ol propor
tion," according to Paul Ehdich.. proles so*
ol population biology here.
Ehrlich.. his wile Anne, and Fresno State
University hislonan Toy Bilderback are Ihe
authors ol a new book, J he Gtilden Dow,
an investigation ol Ihe current immigra
tion problem in the context ot the history
ol human migration and Mexican
rVmencan relations.
It was under Ihe Nixon administration
that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) Chairman Leonard Chapman
reported Ihe lindings ol a stud*' which
concluded that Ihe cost ol illegal immig
rants to U.S. taxpayers was as high as $16
billion and increasing by $500 million per
year. The number of illegal aliens was in
creasing by 250,000 or more every year.
Wlial Chapman lorgol to mention was
that the report also staled that "the availa
ble statistics do not permit reliable deter
mination ol Ihe number ol aliens in Ihe
country, or Ihe percent ol these in the
labor market or on weltare," according to
Ehdich.
Chapman saw a rapid increase in Ihe
number ol illegal immigrants along the
border and perceived a growing problem
lor Ihe undermanned border patrol, says
Ehdich.
""The way lo call attention lo this prob
lem is to make up some numbers, go lo the
press and say that we are being invaded."

"It is not clear »lut these increased ap
prehensions meant,," he continued., "it
vou apprehend more does that mean that
leww or more are getting through
Ehrlich argues that the information that
we do have about Mexican "immigrants '
shows that the* are largely a transient
worker population.
"The argument vou hear is that the Mex
icans are coming, taking over our jobs and
are weltare bums besides. Which are
thevr
Ihe data indicates that these workers
pay taxes and virtually never get any be
nefits, EhHich says.
He says he is bothered that there is too
little known about the nature ot the mig
rant worker. ""The millions ot dollars we
are spending on lence along the border
should have been spent linding out what is
going on."
""What became frightening," Ehrlich
says as he talks about his impressions
when he started to study the subject, ""was
that it became more and more clear to us
that what is an overblown cnsis today., five
to 15 years down the line could lie a trulv
horrendous situation."
Currently 46 percent ot the population
in Mexico are children under 15 years ol
age who will soon be looking tor |obs. The
annual growth rateot the population is still
increasing by 2.9 percent.
What should Ihe United Slates do?
"Outside ol liguring out what Ihe immig
ration numbers should be we have lo re
move the""push"" laclors by Helping lo

create (obs in Me\KO, Columbia,, Domini
can Republic. Il we don 't do this it is clear
that the demographic pressure will build
and build and we will be in deep trouble.
""I wiilß give you a shocking suggestion,""
Ehrlich said, smiling, ""toi
once I agree with Senator S.I Havakawa
iID-Gal). He has given bv tar the best short
term solution. i
Ehrlich said that the United States
should make an arrangement with the
Mexican government. The United States
should |>ermit those that want to work
here to purchase a $250 interest paying
bond trom the Mexican government. The
hond will be retrievable il they are back
within six months. This would guarantee
that they would leave and give them some
interest on money that they would pay a
""coyote," a smuggler, to get them out ot
the country now.
Ehrlich sees the relationship between
the United States and Mexico as a micro
cosm ot relationships between nch and
poor nations in general. Even though
Mexico was never a colony ot the United
States, the United Slates "has a long his
tory ot mucking around in Mexican at
tains."
What can be done about it? Part ot the
answei, according to Ehrlich, is economic
integration ot INlorth America.
"The basic problem is to spread wealth
lo the rest ot the world without turning it
industrial and without pauperizing the
overdeveloped. I don't view this as altruis
tic but as purely seltish," Ehrlich said.

Ehrlich sees the relationship between
the United States and Mexico as a micro

poor nations in general. Even though
Mexico was never a colony ot the United

The problem of illegal immigration Irom
Mexico "is being blown out ol propor
tion," according to Paul Ehdich.. proles so*
ol population biology here.
Ehrlich.. his wile Anne, and Fresno State
University hislonan Toy Bilderback are Ihe
authors ol a new book, J he Gtilden Dow,
an investigation ol Ihe current immigra
tion problem in the context ot the history
ol human migration and Mexican
rVmencan relations.
It was under Ihe Nixon administration
that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) Chairman Leonard Chapman
reported Ihe lindings ol a stud*' which
concluded that Ihe cost ol illegal immig
rants to U.S. taxpayers was as high as $16
billion and increasing by $500 million per
year. The number of illegal aliens was in
creasing by 250,000 or more every year.
Wlial Chapman lorgol to mention was
that the report also staled that "the availa
ble statistics do not permit reliable deter
mination ol Ihe number ol aliens in Ihe
country, or Ihe percent ol these in the
labor market or on weltare," according to
Ehdich.
Chapman saw a rapid increase in Ihe
number ol illegal immigrants along the
border and perceived a growing problem
lor Ihe undermanned border patrol, says
Ehdich.
