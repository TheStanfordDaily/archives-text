## Welcome to Realpolitik 
### 
We gave much thought to titling our column
"The Politics of Principle." At first glance, the
heading seems self-contradictory: politics con
cerns bargaining and compromise; principle
describes fundamental values that cannot be
bartered or bargained. If you think there can be
no overlap between the two then it's time you
entered the world ot Realpolitik.
Welcome to Realpolitik (RP for short). Our
first tour stop is the John Connally School of
Sales. Republican presidential candidate Con
nally doesn't really sell anything; he just sells
out everything.
Today's "presidential campaign special" is Is
rael; Connally's selling it out for oil. We should
look closely at some of his sales techniques —
we'll see them elsewhere in RP.
Connally knows that it pays to advertise —
especially with catchy headlines like "lasting
peace," "stableoil prices"and "guaranteedfuel
supply." Don't worry that the promises are un
deliverable; in RP, truth and accountability are
not where the action is.
Connally's well-financed sellout message
goes something like this: The Camp David ac
cords should be scrapped for a comprehensive
package deal. The United States would force
Israel to return to pre-1967 borders, Palestinian
"selt-determination" would take place on the
West Bank and moderate Arab oil producers
wouldthen assure the United States of uninter
rupted oil supplies at stable prices.
Connally makes no attempt to deal with the
complexities that a politically viable settlement
would involve. Connally's plan would not pre
vent the establishment ot a PLO-run state. He
assumes terrorists would renounce violence
and accept the pre-1967 borders.
So tar PLO head Yasser Arafat has failed to
declare even a temporary pause in violence (de
spite the recent publicized requests to do so by
several American blacks) and is disinclined to
even recognize an Israeli right to exist, much
less respect 1948 or 1967 borders.
The Connally plan also ignores the fact that
moderate Arab oil suppliers to the United
States, who are the key to a workable peace,
have privately indicated that they don't really
want a Palestinian West Bank state (President
Carter has undiplomatically revealed this pub
licly).
Connally's promise of "stable real oil prices"
is hollow. The price of oil is set by OPEC, a cartel
composed not only of moderate Arabs with
whom a deal conceivably might be struck but
also of radical Arab countries and non-Arab na
tions, who gain nothing from a settlement and
nonescalating prices.
The proposal which Connally calls "forceful
American diplomacy" is a sellout of both Israel

and Egypt to the logic of terrorism and the pres
sure of oil blackmail. Such a deal is quite under
standable in the world of Realpolitik where
democratic values and moderate behavior pale
in comparison to promises of abundant oil.
Israel, like the United States, is no Utopia;
nonetheless, it stands out as an embodiment of
fundamental democratic values that are becom
ing increasingly rare in a world filled with
Khomeinis, Arafats, Bokassas and Vorsters.
The recent Israeli Supreme Court ruling that
certain West Bank Israeli settlements are illegal
illustrates the point that Israel is grappling with
tough questions through mechanisms of checks
and balances. Such a judicial intervention would
not happen in most of the world.
Connally's proposed loosening of traditional
U.S. ties with Israel is a shabby attempt to come
off as the Macho Man of HO — the straight talk
ing candidate who lets the chips fall where they
may.
In the world ot Realpolitik we see that Con
nally expects the chips to tall right into his poc
ket: he has nothing to lose portraying himself as
the underdog, and in any event his proposals
won't hurt his Houston law firm's already brisk
dealings with Arab oil interests.
Unfortunately, Realpolitik extends beyond
the campaign tactics of a shaky Presidential can
didate. The lure of petroleum supplies and Arab
megabucks is powerful worldwide.
France, which sold out Israel in 1967, presents
an especially sorry example of the triumph of
pragmatism over principle. Withdrawing long
standing support of Israel, France embraced all
the Arab nations, even the most radical.
The French have since done a fine business
peddling weapons and have reportedly supplied
Iraq, a nation irresponsible by just about any
one's standards, with nuclear power plants and
enriched uranium. In return for these supplies
and a more PLO-oriented foreign policy, France
receives Mideast oil payola.
Don't think France's shifting of alliance was
based upon a kindled sensitivity to legitimate
Palestinian concerns; remember, Realpolitik
means ideologv follows power, not the other
way around.
We live in a complicated world where hard
choices must be made. France has made its
choices; so has Connally. A European editor has
noted that "America has been so rich and so
powerful for so long, it's had the luxury to be
moral." It's comforting to know that if we ever
decide to declare moral bankruptcy, )ohn Con
nally will be around.

cords should be scrapped for a comprehensive
package deal. The United States would force
Israel to return to pre-1967 borders, Palestinian
"selt-determination" would take place on the
West Bank and moderate Arab oil producers
wouldthen assure the United States of uninter
rupted oil supplies at stable prices.
Connally makes no attempt to deal with the
complexities that a politically viable settlement
would involve. Connally's plan would not pre
vent the establishment ot a PLO-run state. He
assumes terrorists would renounce violence
and accept the pre-1967 borders.
So tar PLO head Yasser Arafat has failed to
declare even a temporary pause in violence (de
spite the recent publicized requests to do so by
several American blacks) and is disinclined to
even recognize an Israeli right to exist, much
less respect 1948 or 1967 borders.
The Connally plan also ignores the fact that
moderate Arab oil suppliers to the United
States, who are the key to a workable peace,
have privately indicated that they don't really
want a Palestinian West Bank state (President
Carter has undiplomatically revealed this pub
licly).
Connally's promise of "stable real oil prices"
is hollow. The price of oil is set by OPEC, a cartel
composed not only of moderate Arabs with
whom a deal conceivably might be struck but
also of radical Arab countries and non-Arab na
tions, who gain nothing from a settlement and
nonescalating prices.
The proposal which Connally calls "forceful
American diplomacy" is a sellout of both Israel

and Egypt to the logic of terrorism and the pres
sure of oil blackmail. Such a deal is quite under
standable in the world of Realpolitik where
democratic values and moderate behavior pale
in comparison to promises of abundant oil.
Israel, like the United States, is no Utopia;
nonetheless, it stands out as an embodiment of
fundamental democratic values that are becom
ing increasingly rare in a world filled with
Khomeinis, Arafats, Bokassas and Vorsters.
The recent Israeli Supreme Court ruling that
certain West Bank Israeli settlements are illegal
illustrates the point that Israel is grappling with
tough questions through mechanisms of checks
and balances. Such a judicial intervention would
not happen in most of the world.
Connally's proposed loosening of traditional
U.S. ties with Israel is a shabby attempt to come
off as the Macho Man of HO — the straight talk
ing candidate who lets the chips fall where they
may.
In the world ot Realpolitik we see that Con
nally expects the chips to tall right into his poc
ket: he has nothing to lose portraying himself as
the underdog, and in any event his proposals
won't hurt his Houston law firm's already brisk
dealings with Arab oil interests.
Unfortunately, Realpolitik extends beyond
the campaign tactics of a shaky Presidential can
didate. The lure of petroleum supplies and Arab
megabucks is powerful worldwide.
France, which sold out Israel in 1967, presents
an especially sorry example of the triumph of
pragmatism over principle. Withdrawing long
standing support of Israel, France embraced all
the Arab nations, even the most radical.
The French have since done a fine business
peddling weapons and have reportedly supplied
Iraq, a nation irresponsible by just about any
one's standards, with nuclear power plants and
enriched uranium. In return for these supplies
and a more PLO-oriented foreign policy, France
receives Mideast oil payola.
Don't think France's shifting of alliance was
based upon a kindled sensitivity to legitimate
Palestinian concerns; remember, Realpolitik
means ideologv follows power, not the other
way around.
We live in a complicated world where hard
choices must be made. France has made its
choices; so has Connally. A European editor has
noted that "America has been so rich and so
powerful for so long, it's had the luxury to be
moral." It's comforting to know that if we ever
decide to declare moral bankruptcy, )ohn Con
nally will be around.

We gave much thought to titling our column
"The Politics of Principle." At first glance, the
heading seems self-contradictory: politics con
cerns bargaining and compromise; principle
describes fundamental values that cannot be
bartered or bargained. If you think there can be
no overlap between the two then it's time you
entered the world ot Realpolitik.
Welcome to Realpolitik (RP for short). Our
first tour stop is the John Connally School of
Sales. Republican presidential candidate Con
nally doesn't really sell anything; he just sells
out everything.
Today's "presidential campaign special" is Is
rael; Connally's selling it out for oil. We should
look closely at some of his sales techniques —
we'll see them elsewhere in RP.
Connally knows that it pays to advertise —
especially with catchy headlines like "lasting
peace," "stableoil prices"and "guaranteedfuel
supply." Don't worry that the promises are un
deliverable; in RP, truth and accountability are
not where the action is.
