Who says alcohol and driv
ing don't mix? Alcohol and
driving can mix when the al
cohol is in the gas tank.
Alcohol fuels made from
plants are excellent motor
tuels, and could help reduce
our dependence on foreign
oil, reduce pollution, improve
gas mileage, create jobs, keep
dollars at home and help boost
the farm economy.
Alcohol can be combined to
make 'gasohol,' a mixture of 10
percent agriculturally derived
ethyl alcohol with 90 percent
unleaded gasoline.
Unlike gasoline, alcohol is a
renewable energy source.
A serious program to get
gasohol into mass production
could provide about 10 percent
of our fuel needs, according to
Department of Energy and De
partment ol Agriculture esii
mates.
Alcohol tuels offer Ameri
cans an important opportunity
to reduce their dependence on
foreign oil in just a few years.
Although no one energy
source can solve our national
energy problem, alcohol fuel is
one source that has been vastly
underestimated.
Extensive laboratory and "on
the road" tests clearly show
that the gasohol blend outper
forms regular and unleaded
premiumgasolineand is better

lor your car. Gasohol boosts
octane, so lead and other
dangerous additives are not
needed. Thus it can help re
duce the serious shortages of
unleaded gas.
Gasohol-powered cars re
quire no additional mainte
nanceorengine modifications.
Gasohol will also help reduce
engine deposits and "knock
ing" (race cars run on pure al
cohol).
Gasohol costs about the
same as premium unleaded
gasoline.
Alcohol production will not
use up crops that should be
going tor food and will not sig
nificantly raise farm prices.
Only the plant starches are
used in making alcohol, leav
ing the proteins for use in ani
mal or human tood. None of
the protein is lost.
Several studies have shown
that livestock fed the high
protein by-product ot alcohol
fuel production gained weight
just as fast or faster. Thus we
can get tood and tuel from the
same crop, according to the
Energy Department.
Equally important, alcohol
tuels do not depend exclu
sively on crops for raw mate
rials. Garbage, spoiled crops,
corn stalks, wood and many
other products that have no
nutritional value are excellent
resources for the production

ot alcohol for fuel.
Some people have claimed
that it will take more energy to
convert material into alcohol
than the energy value of the
alcohol that will be produced.
But a recent Department of
Energy report and Department
of Agriculture statement prove
that with modern, energy
efficient facilities, the energy
balance can be positive.
New technologies for con
version of food and wastes to
alcohol operate with positive
net energy balances of up to
tour-to-one. The energy that it
takes to grow crops is more
than made up tor it both tood
and alcohol can be produced
Irom that crop, or it waste pro
ducts are used that otherwise
would be thrown away.
We could get much more
than 10 percent of our gas
needs from alcohol if we used
more sugar beets and sweet
sorghum which have a much
better net energy balance.
Henry Ford ran the nation's
first automobiles on alcohol
and was a strong advocate of
alcohol fuels, as was Alexander
Graham Bell.
Many countries are already
planning or actively involved in
large scale alcohol production.
In Canada, government minis
tries are seriously discussing
making virtually all the coun
try's motor fuel by converting a
portion ot their huge timber
liarvest into wood alcohol.
New Zealand now thinks it can
harvest enough sugar beets to
run all its cars and trucks on
alcohol. Brazil already meets 15
percent of its tuel needs with
alcohol fuels.
A greatly expanded effort
will be needed for alcohol fuels
to realize their enormous po
tential in the United States. Al
cohol tuels will be tar less ex
pensive than the synthetic
fuels from coal that have re
ceived so much attention
lately.

Il you think gasohol makes
sense then write to your rep
resentatives in government
and urge them to support the
lull and immediate develop
ment of alcohol tuels.
Who knows, it gasohol pro
duction is stepped up and
given its righttul place in the
American energy system, we
may soon have a nation ot al
coholic automobiles.
