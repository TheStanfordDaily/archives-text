## Racism still alive 
### 
I am usually not given to writ
ing letters to the editor. But
today has been a particularly
sad day for me.
In less than ten hours I have
had to scrub from the elevator
wall in my Stanford apartment
building the tollowing: "Only
niggers live in Blackwelder,"
and "Iran pigs go home."
The jingoistic and bellicose
grumblings of the average
American are perhaps under
standable if not forgivable,
given their lack ot opportunity
to acquire a more sophisti
cated understanding of inter
national political problems.
For ostensibly educated col
lege students at "America's
elite ot learned institutions" it
is truly a sad mockery of what it
means to be educated.
Though these two outrage
ous statements were obviously
written by separate hands, ra
cism and nationalism have
been closely linked histori
cally, particularly during times
of economic insecurity. Fascist
Germany provides us with a
graphic example.
Yet our economic insec
urities and childlike scrawlings
on elevator walls are poor dis
tractions from the mass starva
tion of children in Cambodia
and the unrelenting racism of
our society.

Why are we filled with so
much fear and hatred when the
disinherited cry only tor com
passion?
Klux Klan is murder
ing white and black alike,and
our citizens attack students
who "look like Iranians." My
wite is Creek but looks Iranian.
Must I fear for her life when
she walks down a street?
To try to communicate with
my fellow students at Stanford
via this letter I know is woefully
inadequate, but there is little
else I can do.
And actually, as you may
have guessed, what worries me
is not so much the scrawling on
elevator walls as what it seems
to reflect in the mood of the
people.
I urge you to resist this
clouding of your hearts and
minds, to defend all peoples'
rights to freedom and equality,
and to protect a fragile world
peace. The refugees ot Cam
bodia are dying a torturous
death by starvation and desp
erately need our assistance.
If we can turn our energy
away from destructive frustra
tions and toward helping the
helpless, we may indeed yet
justify our as yet unrealized
American vision.
