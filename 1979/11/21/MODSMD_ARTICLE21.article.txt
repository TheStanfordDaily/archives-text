## United States must not appease Iran 
### 
Calls in the Doily to send the
shah home have come trom
David Miller (Nov. 16) and
Linda Crouse (Nov. 19), and al
though the authors are wrong,
their opinions lend perspec
tive to the issue.
Suppose the truth is most
favorable to the Khomeini re
gime. Assume the shah did
murder 200,000 people and un
justly enrich his family. (The
reasons we installed the shah
are irrelevant to our returning
him.) We must not return the
shah in spite of this.
Crouse is concerned with
anti-Iranian sentiment in the
United States and laments the
"shades of 1930 Germany."
The unintended irony in this
reference is startling. Has
Crouse forgotten Munich in
1938, and that appeasement of
international outlaws is stupid,
cowardly and only delays the
inevitable confrontation?
Only lately have we been
told that the remaining hos
tages may be subject to spying
charges in kangaroo courts.
But before Miller's and
Crouse's columns were writ
ten, the Iranians were no
longer saying return of the
shah would guarantee release

of the hostages.
There were dark hints that
negotiations would only then
be possible. And there have
been rumors that the goons in
Tehran wouldn't release the
hostages it the shah goes back
to Mexico. They might insist
that the U.S. persuade Mexico
to give him up.
For anyone to suggest
capitulation in such a situation
is unbelievable.
So it is obvious that Iran's
demands are only beginning.
Alter the shah, his money and
tamily will probably be de
manded.
Does his aged mother de
serve to be murdered by the
mob, as she surely would be?
And then what?
Termination of ties with Is
rael could be the next demand.
Khomeini doesn't like South
Africa much either, and so rela
tions with that country might
become negotiable.
Iran's demands may not be

endless, but it's clear that the
return of the shah won't be the
only one.
What other lawless govern
ments, could learn from any
U.S. capitulation to demands
by criminals abroad, sup
ported by appeasers at home,
is chilling. Kadaffi could decide
to grab any unfortunate Ameri
cans in Libya and demand the
United States stop its aid to Is
rael.
American weakness would
not be lost on Russia, which
has encouraged Iran's ter
rorism since before the hos
tages were seized.
If we give in to a country we
could level in hours, Russia has
at least two options: To goad
t other countries to try some
thing similar, and to challenge
the United States directly. The
latter may be particularly at
tractive in light of our caving in
on the troops in Cuba after our
pronouncements that the
status quo was unacceptable.

Carter has handled the situa
tion well, but any other person
as President could hardly have
done anything differently.
Agonizing decisions lie ahead.
We should begin to ponder
what to do if any hostage is
murdered for spying.
It is unfortunate to have to
stand up for the shah in this
matter of principle, assuming
(which I do not) that he is as
bad as the appeasers say he is.
It he is a mass murderer,
then Egypt, or Morocco, or
Mexico or the United States
should have extradited him be
fore the hostages were taken.
That they didn't suggests he
may not be the monster Tehran
says he is.
In any event, it's too late to
return him. Capitulation to
these criminals would set an
unendurable precedent.
