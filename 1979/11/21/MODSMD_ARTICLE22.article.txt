## Clark in political 'Catch-22' 
### 
The whole situation evokes visions of Catch
-22. Although Libertarian candidate Ed Clark
piled up more votes than any other third-party
gubernatorial candidate in recent California his
tory, California Secretary of State March Fong Eu
has refused to grant the Libertarian Party ballot
status.
Clark received 377,960 votes in last
November's election, or 5.5 percent of the vote.
Since state law says that a candidate for state
wide office who receives more than two percent
of the vote qualifies his party for ballot status,
Clark and other observers believe the Liberta
rian Party met the test.
But March Fong Eu points to the designation
'Independent' next to Clark's name on the baiiot
and claims that he wasn't the Libertarian party
candidate for governor.
Well, of course it said 'Independent'. Clark's
name was put there by petition, a route which
does not allow a party name to appear on the
ballot next to a candidate's name. But there was
never any doubt about which party Clark rep
resented: every news release, radio or televi
sion ad, and every piece of campaign literature
called Clark the Libertarian candidate.
It is obvious that the secretary of state's posi
tion is politically motivated. The Democrats and
Republicans understand that the Libertarian
Party means real competition to the monopoly
held by the two major parties.
In California the only other route to perma
nent ballot status is registering at least one per
cent of the voters with the Libertarian Party. That
means 72,000 Californians must be registered
Libertarian by December 31. If that happens, the
Libertarian candidate for president, our own Ed
Clark, will have a guaranteed spot on the 1980

ballot — and millions of Californians will have a
real alternative to the tired old politics of the
Democrats and Republicans.
If you support the policies of the Libertarian
Party — economic freedom, civil liberties and a
non-interventionist foreign policy —you should
register Libertarian so that you'll be able to vote
for Libertarian candidates in future elections.
If you voted for Ed Clark for governor, you
should register Libertarian.
If you didn't vote for Ed Clark, but would like
to have more candidates like Clark on the ballot
in future elections, you should register Liberta
rian.
If you think the two-party monopoly isn't
good for the country, you should register Liber
tarian.
Liberal and conservative politicians both ac
cept the basic premise that government can
solve our problems; they just disagree about
which particular regulations, controls, taxes or
prohibitions shall be imposed on individuals.
Libertarians reject both of these inconsistent
positions and believe that people, not politi
cians or bureaucrats, know how to solve their
problems in a voluntary manner. This is why the
Libertarian Party, founded in 1971, is already
America's third-largest and fastestrgrowing
political party.
The consistency and devotion to principle of
the Libertarian Party has been the major factor in
its smooth and steady growth. As the failures of
big government become all too clear, more and
more Americans are responding to the message
of Libertarian Party.
