## Last year's seniors rated teaching ability lower 
### Karen Springen 
Seniors surveyed here unanimously en
dorsed laculty research quality hut more th*in
a tilth consider laculty teaching ability in
adequate, according to Dean ot Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadourian.
In a survey conducted last year, 99 percent
ol seniors described the laculty as "good"
to "excellent" scholars and resear
chers, while only 78 percent gave them the
same high ratings as teachers, Katchadourian
said.
Ketlecting the need to improve the level
ol (acuity teaching, the University now has a
Teaching and Learning Center lor laculty
who want to improve their teaching skills, he
said.
As dean, Katc hadourian monitors the qual
ity ol education through several regular
evaluations. These include a series ol surveys
on the general advising system, a senior sur
vey, course evaluations and curriculum
studies.
He said he expected a special tour-year
study ol 20 percent ol the class ol 1981 to
indicate in greater depth student experi
ences.
Academic departments here control the
quality ol teaching more than other parts ol
the University, according to Katchadourian.
They exercise this control in the process ol
hiring teachers, lor example.
He added that a tendency to spoonfeed
intormation can damage large courses. He
advised that such feeding be done "in a fash
lon useful to the student," in those courses

where enrollment restriction is minimal.
Large courses often depend on the student's
own initiative, he said.
Katchadourian cited several areas of con
cern in educational quality. Courses with
large enrollments and those courses in the
sciences for non-science majors in particular
are being questioned, he said. He added that
under the present advising system some stu
dents have difficulty obtaining "the right in
tormation and advice."
Stanlord's policy ol providing a general
liberal education, beyond the utilitarian one,
"presupposes that the educated person
should know at least something about the
major areas of learning," he said.
Still, practical concerns dominate student
academic programs here, he said. Two out oi
three members ol the class ol 1981 listed
medicine, law, business and engineering as
career choices in their Ireshman year, indi
cating that vocational orientation is strong.
The trend evokes memories ol lounder Le
land Stanford's statement that "life is, above
all, practical."
"You are here to lit yourself for a usetul
career,' lie told students in 1891.
Katchadourian said students here appear
well-prepared lor enrollment in graduate
schools. Presently three out ol lour seniors
are accepted to at least one graduate school
in their held before graduation. More than 80
percent c onsidered their training lor profes
sional schools "good," "very good" or "ex
cellent," he said.
