World energy shortages will force
Americans to deal with the problems
of nuclear energy and decrease their
dependence on oil-producing na
tions.
This was the opinion expressed by
Washington Governor Dixy Lee Ray
in a speech last night at the Palo Alto
Holiday Inn.
The current conflict in the Middle
East, compounded by the takeover
yesterday of the holy city of Mecca by
Shiite gunmen "may result in loss
of production from Middle East oil
fields," said Ray.
Ray told the audience of 67 that she
"believes we are facing $50 a barrel
oil in the near future" as a result of
Mid-East turmoil.
"The administration and Congress
are not prepared to do anything de
cisive about the energy situation
until the lights go out," she said.
Ray was the keynote speaker at a
three-day symposium co-sponsored
by the Scientists and Engineers for
Secure Energy SE2) and the Hoover
Institution.
The symposium, attended by dis
tinguished scientists and engineers,
including several Nobel Prize win
ners, was designed to bridge the gap
between knowledgeable profes
sionals and government decision
makers.
The symposium aims to develop a
consensus recommendation which
will be presented to congressional
committees, the U.S. Department ot
Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission NRC) and others who
deal with the problems of nuclear
waste and reactor safety.

Kay, a marine biologist and former
head of the Atomic Energy Commis
sion AEC), spoke to reporters in a
private briefing before her speech.
Ray explained that changes will be
made in the handling of low level
waste at the Hantord, Wash., dis
posal site, used by the University to
dispose of waste.
After the controversial re-opening
of the site last week, Kay outlined
various steps to improve methods at
Hantord, including increased state
inspection ot incoming waste and
requirement of a permit for each
group using the site.
The Hanford disposal site is cur
rently one of three such sites in the
country. Ray said that "it would be
appropriate" if California built its
own disposal center
Ray added that if Washington can't
get compliance to the new regula
tions at Hanford, "we will close
down again."
In her speech, Ray said "we are
living in a time of hysteria" concern
ing the use ot nuclear materials.
"There is an irrational tear of de
struction by the atomic bomb," Ray
said. "Two cities have been de
stroyed by atomic bombs and yet
they are now thriving."
The public is wary of developing
nuclear power as an energy source
because of the growing attitude in
America that we must develop a soc
iety free from risk, she added.
Despite this tear, alternate sources
of energy have to be made available
to preserve the American standard of
living, Ray said. Nuclear power is the
only viable alternate source of
energy, she concluded.
