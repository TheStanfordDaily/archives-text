### Associated Press 
The Indiana Hoosiers,
among the rich kids ol the rug
ged Big Ten Conlerence, are
the nation's No. 1 team in The
Associated Press preseason
college basketball poll lor
1979-80.
The Hoosiers, last year's
winners ol the National Invita
tion Tournament, were ac
corded the honor by a'slim 12
points over Kentucky of the
Southeastern Conference, 974
to 962, in one of the closest and
most balanced voting in recent
years.
No team in the voting went
over 1000 points, usually a pre
requisite lor the leading
schools in the poll. And only
one team — third-place Duke
— was named on all 59 ballots.
Indiana received 14 ballots
lor the No. 1 spot in the
nation-wide voting by sports
writers and broadcasters, Ken
tucky collected 11 and Duke
had seven and a total ot 956
points.
Ohio State, Indiana's
power-laden colleague in the
Big Ten, received as many
lirst-place ballots as the
Hoosiers, but only 9*6 points.
Ironically, neither defending
NCAA champion Michigan
State nor Indiana State, which
lost to the Spartans in last
year's finals, was picked for a
Top Twenty berth. Voters ob
viously demurred to the talent
drain at both schools — Earvin

"Magic" Johnson and Greg
Kelser at Michigan State and
Player ol the Year Larry Bird at
Indiana State.
