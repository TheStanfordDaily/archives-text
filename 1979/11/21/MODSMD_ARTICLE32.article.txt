An All-American cross coun
try career ended and one
showed signs ot beginning
Saturday as senior Ann Thrupp
placed 67th and teammate Kim
Schnurpfeil captured 16th at
the AIAW National Champion
ships held in Talahassee at the
Florida State campus.
Thrupp's 17:56.5 linish on
the 5000-meter course, her
second lastest this year, com
pleted a collegiate career that
includes three all-American ti
tles and numerous course re
cords. Her name has become
synonymous with women's
cross country at Stanford.
At the other end ol the trail,

ireshman Schnurpteil is be
ginning what seems to he a
very promising career. Her
time ol 17:14.0 is her fastest to
date, and she was edged out ot
an all-American ranking at the
linish line (the lirst 15 runners
are named All-American).
Head coach Laurel Treon
pointed out that the pair ran
good races at the meet.
"Kim had a good plan in
mind and stuck to it â€” she ran a
controlled race," Treon said.
Concerning Ihiupp, Treon
noted, "Ann gave it her best.
She's been perhaps the most
consistent runner all year and
an example to the team."
