## 
### Edie Bogart 
Another big one got away
Thursday night when Stan
lord's women volleyballers lost
to California 15-H, 11-15, 10-15
and 11-15 at Maples Pavilion. A
Cardinal win would have
meant an opportunity to com
pete in the WAIAW Regionals.
The four-game match
showed the Spikers were
"simply outplayed" by Cal, in
the words of head coach I red
Sturm.
The Californians are a "big,
young team that took us out ot
our normal offense," said
Sturm. They blocked, spiked
and served aggressively. The
Cards were not passing well,
and the Bears "forced the spik
ers to set high outside balls."
In the first game, the spikers
played well and won.
The complexion of the match
changed near the end of the
second game, when tfie Cards
didn't take the opportunity to
score. This encouraged the
Bears, who played consistently
through the end ol the match.
The spikers stayed on the de
fensive in the last three games

the team didn't have enough
momentum to get out of the
hole they were in.
"It really was an off night,"
freshman Deanna Boyette said.
"I didn't feel like I was playing
my best, and I don't think the
rest ol the team was either. . .
we lost morale really quickly."
The loss to Cal was "in the
back ol everyone's mind" dur
ing I riday night's 9-15, 5-15,
J-15 loss to University rti Cac itk',
said Boyette. The spikers were
not ready I riday night "We
were nowhere near to playing up
to our, capabilities," said Sturm.
I riday night, there was a
charged crowd at UOP's last
home match-ol the season. The
Card.s.' season had virtually
ended with the loss to Cal, and
their depression showed.
"Our team spirit wasn't
there,",said Boyette. UOP was
"performing well and the
Cards just weren't ready to
play," said Sturm.
Sturm regards the spikers'
season as "very unpredictable
I could never tell how they
were going to play."
