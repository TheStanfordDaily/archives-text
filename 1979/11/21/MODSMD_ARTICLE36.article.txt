# Poloists pursue another crown

### Brad Brockbank 
Atter a rollercoaster season in which it was nearly eliminated
trom championship competition, the Stanford water polo
team is now just three games away from its second-straight
national title.
The Cardinals are the third-seeded team in the NCAA
championships beginning Saturday in Long Beach. Seeded
ahead of the defending champions are California and UC-
Santa Barbara, two of the teams Stanford will probably have to
face — and defeat — in order to retain its title.
The Cards' first-round opponent. Brown, has been to the
nationals before but should provide little competition tcr
Stanford.
Last year, Stanford defeated Cal in sudden-death overtime
to wrest the national title from the Bears, who have held the
honor tour out of the last six years, yielding it only to the Cards
in 1976 and 1978.
Should all the California teams get past the first round
Saturday morning and afternoon, Stanford will face the
second-ranked Cauchos, and Cal will take on UCLA in the
second round Saturday night. The winners of those games will
compete in the finals Su.iday night.
