# A
						look back at the '79 campaign
## Big wins highlight Card soccer season 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's soccer team
wasn't able to pull off an en
core of last year's showing in
the NCAA Far West Regionals,
due in part to the 2-1
loss to UCLA 11 days ago.
However, even though the
1979 season ended a few weeks
too soon for the Cardinals,
they put together many per
formances to be proud of in
two months of competition.
Pacitic Soccer Conference
stars USF and Santa Clara took
the final curtain call, but un
derstudy Stanford will take its
cue tor a leading role in next
season's conterence and reg
ional productions with a strong
returning cast.
By recording a 5-2 league
mark, the Cards finished sec
ond in the PSC, the best Stan

tord finish yet, and the team's
overall 14-5-2 total was the sec
ond best in modern school an
nals.
"I'm pleased with the ac
complishments," head coach
Nelson Lodge said. "Last sea
son's 16-5 was the best record,
but this season was better
overall â€” this vear's tough
schedule was planned because
we had more tenacity in our
lineup."
just completing his fourth
year at the head of the soccer
program, Lodge has compiled
a 49-27-6 composite record.
After inheriting a 5-5-12 squad
in 1976, he has brought
greener pastures to Harry
Maloney Field.
A couple of the biggest wins

in Lodge's tenure here came
this season against conference
rivals San Jose State and Santa
Clara.
"Beating San lose and Santa
Clara highlighted the season,
as well as staying close with
LJSF," Lodge said. "The most
gratifying point was beating
San jose. We haven't done that
(at Stanford) in five years.
"It was the way we beat San
jose (2-1 in overtime)," Lodge
emphasized. "We defended
and scored on two set plays
which worked perfectly. Santa
Clara (victim of a 1-0 Card shut
out) was the same story."
Besides the team's finish be
hind defending national
champion and current regional

champion USI and first-time
league titleholder Santa Clara
Stanford also boasted some
top individual accomplish
ments.
Rookie Willie Giucc i finished
the season with 19 goals and
live assists for 43 points and
third place in league scoring
standings, junior midfielder
Dan McNevin logged 13 goals
and 12 assists to tie for fourth
place and sophomore Ted
Rafalovich placed sixth on 10
goals and 14 assists.
Senior captain Greg De-
Igado, a defensive Player of the
Week earlier, was selected foi
the All-League first team at
back.
In addition to garnering the

first-team honor, Delgado also
became 'he first Stanford yk
cer playei drafted by a profes
sional team, selected in the
tourth round by the Houston
Hurricanes ot the Major Indoor
Soccer league.
