# SF prepares big bill for rally damage
## 
### 
The Aquatic Park in San Francisco suffered more than
$500 in damages because of rain and 8000 trampling feet
of Stanford students at Friday's Big Came rally, the De
partment of Parks reported yesterday.
Bill Thomas, public information officer for the federal
agency, said an exact figure of damage costs had not yet
been determined, but added that it will definitely run
over the $500 deposit put down by the Stanford Band.
"There is a possibility that the University will be billed
for damages exceeding the $500 deposit," Thomas said.
Because of the rain and trampling feet, the entire
slope of Victoria Park at Fisherman's Wharf will have to
be reseeded, Thomas said.
"I don't know the cost of that, but it will be a lot more
than $500,'' he said.
In addition, the Parks Department had to pay workers
to clean up the beer bottles and trash left behind by the
students and clean out the public bathrooms, whose
floors were coated with mud.
Last year, severe damage was done to the lawns during

the rally but the area did not require reseeding. The
University was never billed for the damages.
Two years ago, the rally was held on the concrete steps
adjacent to the grassy area of Victorian Park.
"Nextyear I'd prefer to have it there again," said Bruce
Heiman, the Band's new manager. "The problem we had
two years ago was that Band members were pushed back
into the water and the waves were hitting them. Even the
tubas got wet."
This year, Heiman said, the Band is "eating shit on the
whole deal."
"We're going to lose most of the deposit and there's
no monetary source that I know of that is potential
reimbursement," he said.
Next year Heiman hopes to begin soliciting funds for
the rally from outside organizations sooner than the
beginning of fall quarter.
"We heard some organizations say that they would
have given more for the rally if they d known about the
event earlier," Heiman said.
