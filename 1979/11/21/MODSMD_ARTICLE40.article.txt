Days of Heaven ★ ★ * *
Sunday, Mem Aud
Terence Malick (badlands) di
rected this almost hypnotically
beautiful examination ot the way
four main characters react to
their environment and to one
another. The setting is the Texas
Panhandle; the time is 1916, and
the tone, paradoxically, is both
ironic and melancholy. The
world seems to be made up of
wheat fields and sky; Malick
makes his characters seem both
mythic and insignificant in their
magnificent surroundings.
Brooke Adams, heroine of Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers, gives
a fine performance as the refugee
from the slums of Chicago who
finds herself in a radically diffe
rent world. Also starring Richard
Gere and Sam Shepard.
Cinematography by Nestor
Alemandros.

Loves of a Blonde * * *■
Monday, Cubberley
One of Milos Forman's early
movies, made while he was still
working in Czechoslovakia. For
man has since come to America
and made Taking Off, One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Hair.
This 1965 effort, a series of looks
at youthful love, finds Forman's
sympathetic, gentle humor in
fine form. A key work by a
talented director.
—Ron Lillejord
The China Syndrome * ★ *
Menlo, Menlo Park
This superb thriller, which uses
a near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, was per
versely vindicated by what hap
pened at Three Mile Island.
Those who called the movie "un
realistic" are hard to find now
(maybe they're out buying Col
umbia Pictures stock), lane
Fonda and lack Lemmon are ex
cellent in this flashy mix of politi
cal commentary and straight
genre thriller. The performances
keep the movie in high gear even

when the director, James
Bridges, loses his nerve and re
fuses to take charge. In the end,
an emotionally moving film, no
matter how you take its politics.
— R.L.
Midnight Express
Menlo, Menlo Park
One of the ugliest pieces of
audience manipulation ever
filmed. Director Alan Parker and
his screenwriter, Peter Stone, get
audiences to cheer a man biting
another man's tongue off and
spitting it out. The movie is an
implicitly sexual glorification of
the most primal violence — it's a
pornography of violence.
In this tale of an American im
prisoned in Turkey for drug
smuggling, Parker and Stone
pervert movie technique to the
point where they've reduced
most people's emotional re
sponses to the lowest, most
brutal level. In this extremely If
mited way, they're "effective,"
but then I guess rapists are too.
— R.L.
Yanks ★ ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Like a short hit of nitrous oxide
— gives you a briet high, but it
quickly wears off. A nostalgia trip
that withers in its sentimentality,
providing a sometimes pleasura
ble sweetness but little heat.
Plots about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often pro
vided fertile movie ground, but
director |ohn Schlesinger, armed
with a skilled crew and healthy
budget, manages only to exhibit
the genre's limitations. Lisa Eic
hhorn and Richard Gere, the
young lovers, have the best ot it
here; they both at least deliver
emotions that strike you. Despite
the likeability of the performers,
the Vanessa Redgrave-William
Devane sequences probably
should have been scrapped; the
only point of contrast made is
that they are older and less naive
than Eichhorn and Gere. Limp
lyricism; no magic.
—R.L.

The Codfather -k ★ ★ ★
New Varsity, tonight and
tomorrow
The greatest gangster movie
ever made, but it's a lot more
than that in the end. Writer
director Francis Ford Coppola
takes Mario Puzo's epic, pulpy
book and dares to take chances
with it. That is, he accepts the
novel's dimensions and its tone
and comes up with something
greater than anyone (except
Coppola?) expected; a big, juicy,
lustful and violent look at the
criminal subculture in America.
Marlon Brando fills his cheeks
with orange peels and talks in a
tired, beaten, world wise voice;
the movie revolves around his
compelling presence as the God
father.
Al Pacino, lames Caan, Diane
Keaton, Talia Shire and the late
John Cazale became famous via

their supporting roles; you're at
tracted and repelled by all of
them. Three hours ot llashy, lurid
excitement made by a man
whose sense ot flashiness and
luridness (as well as just about
every other important movie
sense) is just about the best
around.
-R.L.
The Godfather, Part //****
New Varsity, tonight and tomor
row
A little messy around the
edges, but still a very great
American movie. More subdued,
more introspective than its pre
decessor; this sequel sometimes
lacks the vulgar energy that drove
the earlier movie, but Part II is
more textured, more complex,
more troubling.
The movie explores the period
beforeand after the time frameof

the original. Robert De Niro bril
liantly portrays a tough, unsen
timental Vito Corleone, who
finds that crime is a successful
way to feed your family. Director
Francis Coppola and cinematog
rapher Cordon Willis' recreation
of the Little Italy of 1920s New
York makes an adjective like
evocative seem inadequate. And
30 years later, Vito's son Michael
(Al Pacino) continues to run the
family business; what may have
looked glorious and admirable in
the first Godfather appears very
tarnished here. Remarkable per
formances abound; those by
Pacino, De Niro, Lee Strasberg,
lohn Cazale and Michael Gazzo
are especially noteworthy.
—R.L.
Starting Over 2
Palo Alto Square
Extremely unambitious; rarely
rises above the level of unin
spired '40s romantic comedy. Di
rector Alan Pakula (Klute, All the
President's Men) is more at home
with suspense and crisp drama
tics; here he comes off as an old
time studio hack with a comic
sense that is, at best, unsure.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much if the movie were carried
off with the kind of winking
lightness that Burt Reynolds' per
formance here continually deliv
ers. (ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to
be bad — and she's successful.
No matter what Burt Reynolds is
in.it seems, he ends up being the
only reason to see it.
— R.L.
And /ustice For All ★
Palo Alto Square-
About 10 years ago, this film
would have made a great TV pilot
movie, and that's probably the
best that can be said for it. Lots of
the "can the honest, crusading
lawyer keep his integrity in the
ugly, dog-eat-dog world of crim
inals, dirty attorneys and dishon
est judges?" type conflict. Direc

tor Norman Jewison, who should
know better, directs the shallow
dramatics and cheap comedy in
the script with an embarrassing
earnestness. Al Pacino has never
seemed so ordinary; by sheer
force of will, he's interesting, but
the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be successful in his bid for
a weekly series?" Pacino must be
more ambitious than that.
—R.L.
Apocalypse Now * * ★ *
Old Mill
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion ot mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando and Martin Sheen.
—R.L.
Luna ★ ★
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (oprra) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's first English language

film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo
graphy in Apocalypse Now) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it.
— R.L.
The Onion Field ★ ★
Old Mill
This movie belongs on the
shelf next to other )oseph Warn
baugh tales: a tough "fact
stranger than fiction" piece,
which smacks of sex, savagery
and, nonetheless, a sensitivity of
the agony and the fear which
keep both cops and robbers
awake nights. |ohn Savage is
stunning as an L.A. policeman
who must keep his lite together
after watching his partner's mur
der. James Woods plays the killer
with elegant cruelty. Despite
tight, clean acting, editing and
cinematography, The Onion
Field is too self-conscious. Vou
almost see Wambaugh and direc
tor Harold Becker plotting ways
to milk each scene for gore/
sentiment (especially the bag
pipes) /visual effect. Alas, set in
the '60s with standards intact, the
movie's men are men, the
women dishrags or whores. The
Onion Field is a paperback thril
ler.
—Karen Wada
Life of Brian * ft
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Sort of like Codspell with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all
funny, but it goes on for much
too long. Python takes aim at bi
blical epics, terrorist logistics,
and the PLO; while they don't
always score, even a series of
bullseyes would be boring. A
Python movie needs a better plot
than the Bible can provide.
—Mike Hale
