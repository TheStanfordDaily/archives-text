Security increased for shah
New York — Police armed with automatic weapons
have been added to the private security force guarding
the deposed Shah of Iran on the 17th floor of New York
Hospital.
A police spokesman said Monday the assignment ot
members of the Emergency Service Unit by Commis
sioner Robert McCuire "was not prompted by any
specific incident."
Although officials would not elaborate on the deci
sion, sources in the department said the hostage crisis in
Iran and the continuing escalation of threats against the
shah's life led to the move.
"If something were to happen to the shah, it could be
just as serious an international incident as our not re
turning him," one police source said.
Although city police have kept close watch on the
hospital grounds and have handled the various nearby
anti-shah demonstrations, the last level of security has
been handled by the shah's own well-armed security
staff.
The police intelligence division, which had been con
tinually monitoring security conditions at the hospital,
recommended "the placement ot emergency service
unit personnel inside the hospital to forestall the possi
bility of an attack on the shah," a department statement
said.
Plane collision over stadium averted
San Diego — An airliner with 133 people aboard nar
rowly missed a small plane over San Diego Stadium
during Sunday's football game between the Chargers
and Pittsburgh Steelers, a spokesman for the pilots' as
sociation said yesterday.
A spokesman tor the airline denied that the jet was
directly over the stadium, but said it was within sight of
the airplane.
Brian Conn, the association's president and a PSA
pilot, talked later with Tony Andrews, the PSA pilot who
was in control, and said "he gave the location as being
right over the stadium" at an altitude of 6200 teet.
"It there had been a collision, the inertia and momen
tum probably would have carried major fragments
farther east," Conn said in an interview.
"But that depends on the speed of the aircratt. Proba
bly nothing would have fallen directly on the stadium
except what might separate immediately."
NY banks fight to enter Cal market
Sacramento — The legislative fight over whether Npw
York banks should be let into the lucrative California
market is under way, even though the Legislature is out
of session.
The appearance Monday of high-ranking bankers,

lawyers and professors before the Assembly Finance,
Insurance and Commerce Committee indicated that
large sums of monev are at stake.
Federal law prohibits banks from having branches in
more than one state, unless two states agree to open
their doors to each other. New York banks may now
make loans in Calitornia, but cannot accept deposits.
The bill, AB 1926 by Assemblyman Howard Berman
D-Los Angeles), would let the 50 New York bank holding
companies open two branches each in California, and
let Calitornia banks enter New York City as soon as the
New York Legislature agrees. A New York bill died this
year but is to be reintroduced next year.
Representatives ot large New York banks said Ber
man's bill would stimulate competition, help the con
sumer and strengthen the economy.
But the Calitornia banking industry said it would hurt
California banks and not help the consumers.
Marine abuse trial delayed
San Diego — Thegeneral court-martial of three Marine
Corps drill instructors charged with abusing recruits was

San Diego County jail for investigation of beating up a
man in a park.

paying a $250 bond, Lopez was released in the after
noon.
Meanwhile, a military judge agreed to separate the
Uiarges against Lopez and the other defendants, Cun
nery Sgt. Charles Bryant ot Nashville, Tenn., and Staff
Sgt. Rockie Cross ot Anadarko, Okla.
A total ot 11 counts tace them. There was no im
mediate indication ot how many each man faces.
The judge, Col. J.A. Mallery, also modified other alle
gations related to drunkenness and threats to kill re
cruits it they told of the incident. An entire platoon
testilied in pretrial proceedings that the sergeants woke
them early last June 26 and mistreated them in their
barracks at nearby Camp Pendleton.

Security increased for shah
New York — Police armed with automatic weapons
have been added to the private security force guarding
the deposed Shah of Iran on the 17th floor of New York
Hospital.
A police spokesman said Monday the assignment ot
members of the Emergency Service Unit by Commis
sioner Robert McCuire "was not prompted by any
specific incident."
Although officials would not elaborate on the deci
sion, sources in the department said the hostage crisis in
Iran and the continuing escalation of threats against the
shah's life led to the move.
"If something were to happen to the shah, it could be
just as serious an international incident as our not re
turning him," one police source said.
Although city police have kept close watch on the
hospital grounds and have handled the various nearby
anti-shah demonstrations, the last level of security has
been handled by the shah's own well-armed security
staff.
The police intelligence division, which had been con
tinually monitoring security conditions at the hospital,
recommended "the placement ot emergency service
unit personnel inside the hospital to forestall the possi
bility of an attack on the shah," a department statement
said.
Plane collision over stadium averted
San Diego — An airliner with 133 people aboard nar
rowly missed a small plane over San Diego Stadium
during Sunday's football game between the Chargers
and Pittsburgh Steelers, a spokesman for the pilots' as
sociation said yesterday.
A spokesman tor the airline denied that the jet was
directly over the stadium, but said it was within sight of
the airplane.
Brian Conn, the association's president and a PSA
pilot, talked later with Tony Andrews, the PSA pilot who
was in control, and said "he gave the location as being
right over the stadium" at an altitude of 6200 teet.
"It there had been a collision, the inertia and momen
tum probably would have carried major fragments
farther east," Conn said in an interview.
"But that depends on the speed of the aircratt. Proba
bly nothing would have fallen directly on the stadium
except what might separate immediately."
NY banks fight to enter Cal market
Sacramento — The legislative fight over whether Npw
York banks should be let into the lucrative California
market is under way, even though the Legislature is out
of session.
The appearance Monday of high-ranking bankers,

lawyers and professors before the Assembly Finance,
Insurance and Commerce Committee indicated that
large sums of monev are at stake.
Federal law prohibits banks from having branches in
more than one state, unless two states agree to open
their doors to each other. New York banks may now
make loans in Calitornia, but cannot accept deposits.
The bill, AB 1926 by Assemblyman Howard Berman
D-Los Angeles), would let the 50 New York bank holding
companies open two branches each in California, and
let Calitornia banks enter New York City as soon as the
New York Legislature agrees. A New York bill died this
year but is to be reintroduced next year.
Representatives ot large New York banks said Ber
man's bill would stimulate competition, help the con
sumer and strengthen the economy.
But the Calitornia banking industry said it would hurt
California banks and not help the consumers.
