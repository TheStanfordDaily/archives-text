# Carter hints at military action
## Khomeini threatens trial of hostages 
### 
By the Assoc idled Press
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said
Tuesday the 49 American hostages at
the U.S. Embassy will be tried as
spies unless the United States re
turns the ousted shah. The White
House replied with a veiled threat ot
military action.
Detense Department sources in
Washington said the Pentagon has
ordered the aircraft carrier Kitty
Hawk and its escort ot five warships

to sail from the Philippines to the In
dian Ocean. They emphasized there
had been no orders from the White
House for military action.
America has a task group led by the
aircraft carrier Midway in the Arabian
Sea about 600 miles from the mouth
ot the Persian Gulf. The closest U.S.
Marine force to the Persian Gulf is in
the Mediterranean Sea several days
steaming time from the gulf.
Detense Department spokesman
Thomas Ross declined to comment
on the reported orders to the Kitty
Hawk.
Presidential spokesman Jody Pow
ell told reporters after Khomeini's

speech, "The United States is seek
ing a peaceful solution to this prob
lem through the United Nations and
every available channel. This is far
preferable to the other remedies av
ailable to the United States."
"Such remedies are explicitly rec
ognized in the charter ol the United
Nations," Powell said. The charter
sanctions military, economic and
diplomatic action by an aggrieved na
tion.
President Carter previously had
been careful to rule out the possibil
ity ot military action to induce Iran to
tree the hostages held by militants
who invaded the embassy Nov. 4.
Khomeini, addressing his nation
on radio and television, called upon
millions of Iranians to demonstrate
Wednesday against American "im
perialism."
Before Khomeini's speech, the
militants released six more black
men and four more women from the
embassy. State Department officials
said all 13 hostages treed so far might
be home tor Thanksgiving.
In a broadcast over Tehran Radio,
Khomeini said that it the United
States continues to refuse to send
the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi to Iran, "the hostages will be
put on trial."
Before Khomeini's speech,
Abolhassan Sadegh, Iran's foreign
press director, said in a Tehran inter
view that no decision had been made
on whether to try the Americans.
But he suggested that such trials
could be held before the same spe
cial tribunals that have sentenced
more than 600 persons to death since
last winter's revolution in which
Khomeini took power in Iran.
Khomeini's remarks last night
appeared to take a tougher stand
than his statement Sunday that the
militants had found evidence U.S.
diplomats were spying on Iran from
the embassy "and a certain number
of spies . . . should be, according to
our laws, tried and punished."
Iranian national television stoked
the religious frenzy by broadcasting

lilm taken last year of a series or
bloody riots against Shah Moha
mad Reza Pahlavi that led to his exile
in January and the downfall the next
month ot the government he left
U.S. diplomats attempted unsuc
cessfully in New York to convince
other U.N. Security Council mem
bers to condemn a possible spy trial
tor the hostages. Council President

Sergio Palacios de Vizzio ot Bolivia
said only one unidentified member
ot the 15-member council supported
the U.S. request.
Former U.N. Ambassador Andrew
Young told State Department offi
cials in Washington he planned to go
to Tehran to try to win freedom tor
the hostages. U.S. officials said he
would be acting on his own.
