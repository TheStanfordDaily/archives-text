Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (AP) â€” Gun
men stormed the Grand Mosque in
Mecca, which shelters Islam's holiest
shrine, on Tuesday and seized a
number of hostages, the official
Saudi news agency reported.
Other reports said there were
about 100 invaders and they seized 90
pilgrims as hostages.
The agency reported Saudi au
thorities took "all necessary mea
sures" to bring the situation under
control and protect the lives of the
hostages, but gave no casualty fi
gures. A report from the Japanese
Embassy here said about 10 persons
were killed.
The Saudi agency, quoting a
statement from the Interior Ministry,
said armed "religious deviators"
joined the crowd of pilgrims for
dawn prayers.
"Then, they presented one of their
ranks to be the 'awaited mahdi,' and
demanded at gunpoint that those
present recognize him as such," it
said.
That indicated the invaders were
membersof theShia Moslem sect. As
Shiites, they believe that the mahdi,
one of the sect's earliest leaders, will
someday return to guide Moslems
on the path to paradise.
One of theShiite's spiritual leaders
is Iran's revolutionary chief, Ayatol

lah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Sources at an Arab League summit
conference in Tunis, Tunisia, said
earlier that 100 armed men were in
volved in the raid, and a Kuwait
newspaper said 90 hostages were ta
ken.
In Egypt, Cairo's Al Akhbar news
paper said a "large number of Kho
meini's bands" in Saudi Arabia
staged several anti-government de
monstrations during the pilgrimage
season in the city of Muna last
month, and speculated the attackers
might be Iranian.
The Egyptian newspaper said the
Saudi army circled the mosque sur
rounding the shrine with tanks and
troops and began helicopter surveil
lance of the area shortly after the
gunmen seized it early yesterday.
Telephone and telegraph com
munications with Saudi Arabia were
severed at midday yesterday.
The day was the last of the Islamic
year 1399, a religious period. At this
time of year, Moslems from around
the world traditionally travel to
Mecca to visit the Great Mosque.
Various Islamic sects have coveted
the stone, which is guarded by the
conservative Wahabi Moslem sect of
the Saudi royal family. In the last re
ported incident, an Afghan Moslem
tried to steal the stone in 1932.
