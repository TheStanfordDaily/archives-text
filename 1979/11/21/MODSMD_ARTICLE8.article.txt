## 'All the factors' exist for another Jonestown 
### Victor Goetz 
It was a year ago this week that the
first sketchy accounts of the mass
suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, began
seeping out to the rest of the world.
But "all the facts, all the elements
that went into the Jonestown tragedy
still exist today," said Dr. Steven Kat
saris, the father of Jim Jones' mis
tress. Jones was the leader of the
Jonestown cult.
Katsaris, leader of the concerned
relatives group that tried unsuccess
fully to urge U.S. government inter
vention before the tragedy, was one
of six speakers Monday night in
Memorial Auditorium for a three
and-a-half hour-long symposium on

"What can we learn from the Cult
Phenomenon?"
Other speakers were a survivor of
the mass suicides, a "deprogram
mer" from Burlingame, two students
who attended Moonie indoctrina
tion camps and a representative of
the Unification Church of Reverend
Sun Myung Moon.
Cults offer members an easy ex
change, said Dr. Lowell Strieker, di
rector of the Freedom Counseling
center in Burlingame. The deal
states, "I will give you simple easy
answers and you will give me your
freedom."
Strieker's center has handled hun
dreds of people and their families
whose lives have been disrupted by
non-traditional religions.
Recruit 'sketch'
His thumbnail sketch of a recruit
pictures a 21-year-old with three and
a half years of college, upper middle
class, white and mostly male. "Three
to four times as many men as women
join cults, showing that the male ego
in this society is in very serious trou
ble," he said.
What led Stanford student
Jonathan Lindgren to go through the
first stages of so-called "Moonie" in
doctrination, he said, was their "very
deep caring for the human race. They
weren't just preaching, they were
putting it into practice."
Richard Clark, a survivor who led a
small group out of Jonestown the day
of the suicide, had a similar experi
ence. What impressed him about
Jones was how kind he seemed, and
how much Jones loved children. He
added, however, that after reaching
Jonestown he immediately saw the

change in ]ones and forced himself
to begin "deprogramming himself."
Not told
Six days of Lindgren's week at
Booneville, north of San Francisco,
had passed before he was told that
he was in a Mooniecamp, he said. He
was not informed earlier, he con
tinued, becuase of the stereotype
that persists of Moonies as brain
washers and streetcorner flower sel
lers.
After making the difficult decision
to leave, he said, he realized he had
been manipulated to some extent.
"After all the love and caring and
genuine concern for everything I had
been doing at Stanford that everyone
had shown, Carolina His hostess)
made a last-ditch effort to make me
stay, saying 'Frankly, Jonathan, I'm
disappointed in you.'"
According to Strieker, peer ap
proval pressure is just one of the
techniques cults use to gain and
keep control of their members.
Cannibalism
Another method is spreading fear.
Clark shocked the audience when he
told of the incidence of cannibalism
at Jonestown. Clark said that Jones
warned, among other horrible
punishments, that those who tried to
escape would "wind up in the pot."
Clark said the Jonestown cook, now
in San Francisco, had confirmed that
such an incident occurred, although
there is no documented evidence of
it.
There was no room to question
anything in the camp, said Alex Ar
mour, another student who partici
pated in Moonie indoctrination.
"When I questioned something in

group meetings the love was sud
denly turned off, and everyone sud
denly seemed concerned about my
soul," he said.
"I have never met a convert who
was brainwashed in the classic sense
of the word. These cults do not use
physically coercive brainwashing like
the Chinese, who would hold a gun
to your head and tell you to do some
thing," he said.
Forms of pressure
However, Strieker said, the cults
do exercise constant pressure, using
methods that include deception, sec
lusion, creation of a deceptive at
mosphere, peer approval or rejec
tion, sleep deprivation, poor diet,
and an instilled fear of the outside
world.
It is people who give these cult
leaders their power, said Clark. "If
you would check out all these lead
ers, they're cowards. They don't
have any power; we give them their
power," he said.
The main lesson of Jonestown is
that while we have to be careful in
dealing with these cults, they do
have their merits, said Dan Feffer
man, of the Collegiate Association
for the Research of Principles GARP),
the college branch of Moon's Unifi
cation Church.
Citing America's history of religi
ous tolerance, Fefterman• claimed
that the cults can make a contribu
tion.
"Remember that all religions
evolved from cults — Jesus of
Nazareth began with his small group
of followers," he said.
He said the Unification Church
wants to evolve into the mainstream
of American life rather than taking its
members into a Jonestown type ot
isolation.
And speaking on the beliefs of the
church about restoring the strength
ot the nuclear tamily, he said he did
not mind Moon matching him up
with his wife.
Katsaris concentrated most of his
remarks on the government's reac
tion to the Jonestown tragedy. He
said the government has still not in
vestigated the incident properly. But
assassinated congressman Leo

Ryan's successor, Rep. Bill Moyer
R-San Mateo) hopes to launch a full
congressional investigation on the
tirst anniversary of the mass suicide.
Over the course ot the year since
the incident, Katsaris' feelings have
moved "from depression to cynicism
and concern," he said.
The cynicism comes mostly in the
form ot bitterness at the State De
partment for being willing to risk de
tente lor a detecting Soviet dancer
but refusing to investigate "all the
documented evidence we gave
them."

Strieker's center has handled hun
dreds of people and their families
whose lives have been disrupted by
non-traditional religions.
Recruit 'sketch'
His thumbnail sketch of a recruit
pictures a 21-year-old with three and
a half years of college, upper middle
class, white and mostly male. "Three
to four times as many men as women
join cults, showing that the male ego
in this society is in very serious trou
ble," he said.
What led Stanford student
Jonathan Lindgren to go through the
first stages of so-called "Moonie" in
doctrination, he said, was their "very
deep caring for the human race. They
weren't just preaching, they were
putting it into practice."
Richard Clark, a survivor who led a
small group out of Jonestown the day
of the suicide, had a similar experi
ence. What impressed him about
Jones was how kind he seemed, and
how much Jones loved children. He
added, however, that after reaching
Jonestown he immediately saw the

change in ]ones and forced himself
to begin "deprogramming himself."
Not told
Six days of Lindgren's week at
Booneville, north of San Francisco,
had passed before he was told that
he was in a Mooniecamp, he said. He
was not informed earlier, he con
tinued, becuase of the stereotype
that persists of Moonies as brain
washers and streetcorner flower sel
lers.
After making the difficult decision
to leave, he said, he realized he had
been manipulated to some extent.
"After all the love and caring and
genuine concern for everything I had
been doing at Stanford that everyone
had shown, Carolina His hostess)
made a last-ditch effort to make me
stay, saying 'Frankly, Jonathan, I'm
disappointed in you.'"
According to Strieker, peer ap
proval pressure is just one of the
techniques cults use to gain and
keep control of their members.
Cannibalism
Another method is spreading fear.
Clark shocked the audience when he
told of the incidence of cannibalism
at Jonestown. Clark said that Jones
warned, among other horrible
punishments, that those who tried to
escape would "wind up in the pot."
Clark said the Jonestown cook, now
in San Francisco, had confirmed that
such an incident occurred, although
there is no documented evidence of
it.
There was no room to question
anything in the camp, said Alex Ar
mour, another student who partici
pated in Moonie indoctrination.
"When I questioned something in

group meetings the love was sud
denly turned off, and everyone sud
denly seemed concerned about my
soul," he said.
"I have never met a convert who
was brainwashed in the classic sense
of the word. These cults do not use
physically coercive brainwashing like
the Chinese, who would hold a gun
to your head and tell you to do some
thing," he said.
Forms of pressure
However, Strieker said, the cults
do exercise constant pressure, using
methods that include deception, sec
lusion, creation of a deceptive at
mosphere, peer approval or rejec
tion, sleep deprivation, poor diet,
and an instilled fear of the outside
world.
It is people who give these cult
leaders their power, said Clark. "If
you would check out all these lead
ers, they're cowards. They don't
have any power; we give them their
power," he said.
The main lesson of Jonestown is
that while we have to be careful in
dealing with these cults, they do
have their merits, said Dan Feffer
man, of the Collegiate Association
for the Research of Principles GARP),
the college branch of Moon's Unifi
cation Church.
Citing America's history of religi
ous tolerance, Fefterman• claimed
that the cults can make a contribu
tion.
"Remember that all religions
evolved from cults — Jesus of
Nazareth began with his small group
of followers," he said.
He said the Unification Church
wants to evolve into the mainstream
of American life rather than taking its
members into a Jonestown type ot
isolation.
And speaking on the beliefs of the
church about restoring the strength
ot the nuclear tamily, he said he did
not mind Moon matching him up
with his wife.
Katsaris concentrated most of his
remarks on the government's reac
tion to the Jonestown tragedy. He
said the government has still not in
vestigated the incident properly. But
assassinated congressman Leo

Ryan's successor, Rep. Bill Moyer
R-San Mateo) hopes to launch a full
congressional investigation on the
tirst anniversary of the mass suicide.
Over the course ot the year since
the incident, Katsaris' feelings have
moved "from depression to cynicism
and concern," he said.
The cynicism comes mostly in the
form ot bitterness at the State De
partment for being willing to risk de
tente lor a detecting Soviet dancer
but refusing to investigate "all the
documented evidence we gave
them."
It was a year ago this week that the
first sketchy accounts of the mass
suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, began
seeping out to the rest of the world.
But "all the facts, all the elements
that went into the Jonestown tragedy
still exist today," said Dr. Steven Kat
saris, the father of Jim Jones' mis
tress. Jones was the leader of the
Jonestown cult.
Katsaris, leader of the concerned
relatives group that tried unsuccess
fully to urge U.S. government inter
vention before the tragedy, was one
of six speakers Monday night in
Memorial Auditorium for a three
and-a-half hour-long symposium on

"What can we learn from the Cult
Phenomenon?"
Other speakers were a survivor of
the mass suicides, a "deprogram
mer" from Burlingame, two students
who attended Moonie indoctrina
tion camps and a representative of
the Unification Church of Reverend
Sun Myung Moon.
Cults offer members an easy ex
change, said Dr. Lowell Strieker, di
rector of the Freedom Counseling
center in Burlingame. The deal
states, "I will give you simple easy
answers and you will give me your
freedom."
Strieker's center has handled hun
dreds of people and their families
whose lives have been disrupted by
non-traditional religions.
