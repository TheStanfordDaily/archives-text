## Iran could stop oil flow from Mideast 
### 
Nicosia, Cyprus (AP) — Iran,
once regarded as the United
States' policeman in the Per
sian Gulf but now as America's
foe, is in a position to cut off
the tlow ot 60 percent of the
world's oil — by blockading
the nairow Strait of Hormuz,
the outlet Irom gult oil nations
to the world's sea lanes.
But, despite the crisis pro
voked by the seizure of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran, West
ern diplomatic sources in the
Iranian capital rule out such
drastic Iranian action.
"Arab gult states, particu
larly Iraq, would consider that
a very aggressive act. So I don't
think the Iranians would dare
do it," commented one dip
lomatic source reached by
telephone from Nicosia. He
added that the United States
probably would deploy its
Middle East and carrier-led In
dian Ocean naval forces to
break any blockade.
Iran's heavy dependence on
toreign lood and other imports
irom the West also militates
against a sea blockade.
At its narrowest, the Strait ot
Hormuz lorms a 24-mile water
gap between southwestern
Iran and the pro-Western sul
tanate ot Oman.
But the strait's shipping lane
actually is only about two miles
wide and snakes through
dangerous shoals. Tankers
pass through the strait at the
rate of one every 12 minutes.
An AP correspondent who
recently visited Oman re
ported that leaders there say
they regard mining ol the

channel as the biggest poten
tial threat. The strait is about
200 feet deep most of the way
across and this should enable
vessels to pass around any ship
purposely sunk in an effort to
block the channel.
Some Arab states would like
to see some American military
presence in the area, but not
necessarily in'the gull itself.
Conservative Arab oil states
much prefer to have U.S. naval
torces "over the horizon" in
the Indian Ocean as a deter
rent to Soviet penetration.
They fear a U.S. presence in
the gult would invite a U.S.-
Soviet confrontation in the
area.
The closest thing to an
American base in the Persjan
Gulf is a "supply facility" on
the gull island emirate of Bah
rain tor the U.S. Navy's five
ship Mideast force.

American oil tankers in the Mideast could be prevented from carry
ing oil to the United States, if Iran blocked the Strait of Hormuz.
