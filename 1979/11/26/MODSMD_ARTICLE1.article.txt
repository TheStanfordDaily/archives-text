# PEP magnet arrives at SLAC after record-setting journey
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Thursday marked more than just
another Thanksgiving holiday for
physicists at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC). It signalled
the arrival of the mammoth "Little
Wheels" tractor-trailer rig and its dis
tinguished cargo â€” an
wide, 107-ton superconducting
magnet.
Driver Stan Jones, owner of Stan
Jones Transportation, Inc., in Alviso,
pulled his ponderous, doughnut
shaped load into its temporary park
ing slot at SLAC at 9:58 p.m., just in
time for his own turkey celebration.
The sluggish trek from Argonne Na
tional Laboratories outside of
Chicago spanned 2203 miles in 20
days, setting a combined distance
payload record in highway transpor
tation.
The 10-year-old magnet will be as
sembled into the 2000-ton High Re
solution Spectrometer (HRS) over
the next six months at the newly
opened Positron-Electron Project
(PEP) ring at SLAC. When Depart
ment of Energy (DOE)-sponsored
experimentation with HRS begins
next autumn, scientists will use the
magnet to search for different types
of quarks, the basic particle compo
nents of matter, and to probe into
the existence of gluons, the particles
believed to bind quarks together in
the protons and neutrons of the
atom.
Five varieties of quarks have been
discovered so far, but scientists be
lieve that as many as 16 may be wait
ing to be found.
When cooled to a temperature
near absolute zero (minus 452 de
grees Fahrenheit) and energized, the
magnet will yield a magnetic field
36,000 times that of the earth. Such a
terrific force, capable of tearing a
wrench from a human hand at a dis
tance ot 40 feet, will further bend the
paths of charged particles to enable
scientists to more precisely differen
tiate between different kinds of par

tides.
Local inhabitants need not, how
ever, tear strange magnetic side ef
fects. Dr. Klaus Jaeger, the Argonne
project manager who accompanied
the magnet on its westward journey,
assured laymen that the magnet will
be shielded by a yoke ot 2000 tons of
iron. "From two feet away, there will
be nothing."
Moreover, the superconducting
magnet will permit high energy re
search at huge electrical savings. Ar
gonne physicist Dr. Malcolm Derrick
estimated that "operating more or
less all the time, it will save about $1
million a year to PG&E."
Whatever becomes of the touted
magnet in the future, and Dr. Sidney
Drell, deputy director ot SLAC, ad
mitted that "we don't know what will
happen," congratulations were re
served last Friday tor (ones' feat.
"I haven't done anything different
than any other transporter would
have done if he had had the job,"
emphasized the self-effacing Jones,
but other sources seemed to indicate
otherwise.
"I don't think anyone else could
have made it" through an icy Kit Car
son Pass in California on U.S. 395,
said Jaeger. "I hope the physics will
match that level of performance,"
lauded Drell.
When SLAC opened the doors to
its normally placid grounds Friday
morning, more than 5000 bug-eyed
adventurers flocked to the site.
Clamboring over the 140-foot
Disneyland-like attraction with click
ing cameras, the visitors had ears for
Jones alone.
"I had no problems at all. All I had
to do was drive the truck, and I've
done that all my life," Jones main
tained.
Yet, the rig in itselt was a moment
ous creation. Jones ended the DOE's
18-month trucking search when he
outbid several other major com
panies for the contract in September.
Within 90 days, he was in Illinois with

all extraordinary equipment intact.
Jones subcontracted the 18 axle,
110 wheel trailer to a Stockton firm.
"This thing is wired like you wouldn't
believe it," Jones said of the elabo
rate suspension system, which held
the staggering weight from five to
seven inches above the ground
throughout the trip, even at grades
up to 7 degrees.
Axle adjustments were necessary
to comply with interstate regula
tions. Midwest states mandated 18
axles while the 11 western states re
quired 13 to diminish highway wear.
In fact, the massive structure
touched the ground only twice over
the 6000 mile round-trip, according
to the driver.
The tractor Jones obtained to haul
the load was a specially-built 450-
horsepower, 24 manually-shitted
gear Kenworth.


This 107 ton donu! isn't of the breakfast variety. Rather, it
produces across its central hole a magnetic field 36,000
times that of the earth. At right it is shown in 1968 being
