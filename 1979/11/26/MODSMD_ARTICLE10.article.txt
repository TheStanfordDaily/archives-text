# SIB: concerned with the real world
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
In the shadow of Stanford's
protected ivory tower bustles
an organization concerned not
with academic life, but with the
outside world, the real world,
, . . the business world.
Apty named, Stanford in Bus
iness (SIB) helps transport stu
dents trom the dull carrels of
UGLY to the advent urous
realm of corporate existence.
* SIB describes itself as "an
undergraduate organization
designed to enable Stanford
students, regardless of their
ac ademic pursuits, to gain new
msights into the business
realm." By strengthening the
fcjpport between students and
>he business community, its
members strive to undermine
rlie stigma that students and
academia may associate with
Commercial affairs.
; The organization attempts to
realize these goals through
•Jeveral vehicles, including
such on-campus programs as
career panels, the Business
School Forum and the Corpo
rate Recruitment Program.
SIB sponsors about three
career panels each quarter to
spotlight business executives
and their specific careers. The
purpose of this activity is "to
bring the world of business
closer to Stanford students,

enabling them to evaluate
more knowledgeably the diffe
rent career options," accord
ing to SIB material.
The Business School Forum,
contrary to the formal tone of
its name, is simply a series of
casual sherry hours with direc
tors of admissions from out
standing business schools
around the country. Represen
tatives from Harvard and UCLA
visited here earlier this quar
ter, and a Northwestern direc
tor will make an appearance
Wednesday.
SIB arranges presentations
by various companies in its
Corporate Recruitment Prog
ram, which has "the dual be
nefit of exposing students to
the inner workings of a corpo
ration while at the same time
giving the company the chance
to demonstrate its unique per
sonality."
Public Relations and Mate
rials director, Dan Vih em
phasized that these functions
are open to everyone, in con
trast to the Career Planning
and Placement Center's
(CPPC) offerings which are li
mited to six persons. These
meetings also serve to combat
an "image problem" faced by
some firms, Yih said.
In its most dramatic role —
the Stanford Management In

tern Program (SMIP) —SIB acts
as a liaison between a potential
intern and a particular com
pany.
Aided by advisor Robert Si
mon, associate dean at the
Graduate School ol Business,
and also relying on alumni and
school contacts, SMIP has built
a record ol strong pertormance
in high-echelon business cir
cles.
Last year, SMIP tilled four in
ternship positions at Pan
American World Airlines in
New York City as well as spots
for the Ford Motor Company in
Detroit, Emerson Electric in St.
Louis, Standard Oil Co. ol
Calilornia, Litton Industries in
Sunnyvale and numerous
others. In the past, students
have received internships trom
prestigious corporations
throughout the world.
"My experience with SIB
provided me with the insights
and contacts in the business
community to arrange my
summer job in specitic con
junction with my academic in
terests and career objectives,"
commented an intern tor
Crocker International Bank in
Brazil.
Untortunately, ot ib jobs ot
tered to SMIP last year, only 19
were actually tilled because ol
a lack ot qualitied resumes, ac

cording to SMIP director Kick
Brown.
"We were really surprised
we couldn't till all the posi
tions," admitted Yih, en
couraging more interested
students to submit resumes
this year.
SMIP members will soon
begin to approach businesses
with introductory letters and
information concerning in
terns lor next summer. Re
sumes ot hopeful candidates
are due Dec. 1 at the SIB office,
No. 1 in the Old Firehouse.
"It's to students' benefit to
be involved because people
who work lor the club have a
better chance ol having their
resumes sent. It's only
natural," Brown said.
Membership lees are nomi
nal to cover the cost ol proces
sing resumes and the program
expenses. Interested persons
should contact Yih.
