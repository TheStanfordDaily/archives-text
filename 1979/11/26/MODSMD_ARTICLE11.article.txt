Moscow (AP) — The Soviet Union, whose
atheistic rulers officially frown on religious
holidays, is exporting Christmas cards for
Western consumers in a controversial deal
with a British company.
Although religious greeting cards are not
normally sold here, for the second season
the Soviet Union is printing Christmas cards
with Christian and traditional British designs
for export to the United Kingdom.
British critics have attacked the deal on
commercial and religious grounds, but im
porter Michael Henderson, owner of the
European Greeting Card Ltd., defends his
plan to buy 44 million Soviet-made Christmas
cards this year.
"We are being accused of immorality and
Cod knows what," Henderson said in an in
terview here. "All the Soviets are doing for us
is acting as a subcontractor."
The cards, designed by British artists, in
clude "traditional coach-and-horse scenes,"
a Madonna and Child and "Jesus in the man
ger with a donkey in the background and the

Three Wise Men," Henderson said.
Much of the criticism has come Irom Bri
tain's Greeting Cards and Calendar Associa
tion, which claims the cards are being
dumped on the British market at untair prices
from a country "that has historically denied
Christ, denied the church and ruthlessly
persecuted those who have accepted the
existence of either."
Henderson, here on business, denies the
charges. He said packages of the Soviet
printed cards cost Irom 52 cents to $1.27 in
British stores and that "by no means are we
the cheapest cards in the U.K."
He said Soviet-made Christmas cards
would net his firm about $639,000 in sales to
British retailers this year. An official of
mezhdunarodnaya Kniga, the Soviet firm ex
porting the cards, said they might be offered
elsewhere in the future but are now available
only in the United Kingdom.
Members of the ruling Soviet Communist
Party are theoretically atheists, but the Soviet
constitution permits treedom of religious
worship lor citizens.
