## Faith requires doubt 
### 
I was pleased to see Maria
Higuera's article on religion at
Stanlord, and with the overall
quality with which she de
scribed a vtry complex
phenomenon and combined
sources with many different
points ot view. It I were not
afraid that some will read a
quote which was accurate, but
which needed its context, to
the ettect that I do not think
doctrine or the existence of
Cod is important, I would not
bother writing.
What I was referring to in
that comment was the in
adequacy ot the category of
"existence" to define the im
portance ot theistic language
and the (utility of pinning life
and-death choices on an
abstract* and unanswerable
question.
"Proofs" tor the existence of
Cod are notorious for failing
the test o! rational proof, and it
seems to me that many people
waste a lot ot time either con
cludingfrom that tact that relig
ion is nonsense, or trying to
equate faith with an "over
beliet" which obscures the
value ot honest questioning.
As Higuera's article made
clear, religious institutions
have tound doubt more dif
ticult to affirm than belief. But
doubt is a critically important
part ot taith, just as adoles
cence is critical to the de
velopment of a mature adult.
University students tend to
be involved in rethinking and
reformulating politics, lifes
tyle, vocation, cosmologies
and a number of other things,
including religion. A large
number ot people find religi
ous doubt particularly difficult
to resolve and either drop out
or avoid it.

Since the existence of Cod
cannot be proved or dis
proved, and since an unprova
ble hypothesis requires addi
tional corroboration to be ac
cepted as valuable, I was
suggesting that the question of
the existence of Cod is not a
very useful place to stop.
To make this point more
clearly, the enemy of faith is
not the atheist. Many atheists
are protesting the intellectual
dishonesty which they believe
theism requires. Many others
are reacting to what I believe is
an idolatrous reduction of
Jewish and Christian concepts
ofCod, or to the Church'sown
tendency to forget the inhe
rent tension between faith and
religion.
Christian teaching relies on
the paradox of a "Cod made
flesh" and of a being who is
eternal and living at the same
time. When Bonhoeffer posed
the ideal of "religionless Chris
tianity," he was embracing the
tact that Christianity cannot
live with or without religion.
Far from de-emphasizing
theology, dogma and doctrine,
I hope Stanford students will
take it very seriously and push
beyond superficial choices be
tween talse dichotomies.
The real enemy of faith is the
cynic: the person who values
nothing and makes alienation
into policy and practice. Such
people have no qualms about
using other people, take rather
than give and care not at all
about truth. They are content
to manipulate others, to en
slave, dehumanize and even
kill them, and to use the power
which accrues to knowledge to
these ends. There is all the dif
ference in the world between
the skeptic's commitment to

truth and the cynic's scorn for
value.
Since scholarship properly
gives high value to objectivity
and the pursuit of truth, it is
understandable that religious
dogma will receive critical as
sessment in the classroom and
that the dogmatic assertion of
religious belief will be chal
lenged. I believe that there is a
llaw in the limitations which
the value ot objectivity tends to
place on the role of conviction
within academic disciplines.
Even it pure objectivity were
possible, the ease with which
perception and truth can be
contused argues for more
humble admissions about our
conclusions than is common.
Truth occurs in dialogue and
relationship, not in the isolated
perceptions of particular be
ings.
Our commitment to truth
fulness is to honestly
self-critical offerings of our
best conscientious observa
tion and analysis with others.
Truthtulness occurs where we
retuse to allow others to en
gage in sleight-ot-mind and
where we guard against our
own temptations to do so.
It is when we care to listen
and take seriously perceptions
of the truth different from our
own that we discover the real
value ot clear, precise and
honestly self-critical thinking.
It is tor this reason that I be
lieve Stanlord is fortunate to
have Memorial Church and the
ministries of the religious or
ganizations which comprise
Stantord United Ministries
here to affirm and support the
value ot human beings, to raise
questions ot meaning and
morality in human life, and to
participate in speaking the
truth in love.
While it is true that the per
centage ot University students
who seek involvement in re
ligious organizations is rela
tively small, I have found the
vast majority to be vitally in
terested in these larger issues
ot spiritual lite and death.

and a number of other things,
including religion. A large
number ot people find religi

to resolve and either drop out
or avoid it.

Since the existence of Cod
cannot be proved or dis
proved, and since an unprova
ble hypothesis requires addi
tional corroboration to be ac
cepted as valuable, I was
suggesting that the question of
the existence of Cod is not a
very useful place to stop.
To make this point more
clearly, the enemy of faith is
not the atheist. Many atheists
are protesting the intellectual
dishonesty which they believe
theism requires. Many others
are reacting to what I believe is
an idolatrous reduction of
Jewish and Christian concepts
ofCod, or to the Church'sown
tendency to forget the inhe
rent tension between faith and
religion.
Christian teaching relies on
the paradox of a "Cod made
flesh" and of a being who is
eternal and living at the same
time. When Bonhoeffer posed
the ideal of "religionless Chris
tianity," he was embracing the
tact that Christianity cannot
live with or without religion.
Far from de-emphasizing
theology, dogma and doctrine,
I hope Stanford students will
take it very seriously and push
beyond superficial choices be
tween talse dichotomies.
The real enemy of faith is the
cynic: the person who values
nothing and makes alienation
into policy and practice. Such
people have no qualms about
using other people, take rather
than give and care not at all
about truth. They are content
to manipulate others, to en
slave, dehumanize and even
kill them, and to use the power
which accrues to knowledge to
these ends. There is all the dif
ference in the world between
the skeptic's commitment to

truth and the cynic's scorn for
value.
Since scholarship properly
gives high value to objectivity
and the pursuit of truth, it is
understandable that religious
dogma will receive critical as
sessment in the classroom and
that the dogmatic assertion of
religious belief will be chal
lenged. I believe that there is a
llaw in the limitations which
the value ot objectivity tends to
place on the role of conviction
within academic disciplines.
Even it pure objectivity were
possible, the ease with which
perception and truth can be
contused argues for more
humble admissions about our
conclusions than is common.
Truth occurs in dialogue and
relationship, not in the isolated
perceptions of particular be
ings.
Our commitment to truth
fulness is to honestly
self-critical offerings of our
best conscientious observa
tion and analysis with others.
Truthtulness occurs where we
retuse to allow others to en
gage in sleight-ot-mind and
where we guard against our
own temptations to do so.
It is when we care to listen
and take seriously perceptions
of the truth different from our
own that we discover the real
value ot clear, precise and
honestly self-critical thinking.
It is tor this reason that I be
lieve Stanlord is fortunate to
have Memorial Church and the
ministries of the religious or
ganizations which comprise
Stantord United Ministries
here to affirm and support the
value ot human beings, to raise
questions ot meaning and
morality in human life, and to
participate in speaking the
truth in love.
While it is true that the per
centage ot University students
who seek involvement in re
ligious organizations is rela
tively small, I have found the
vast majority to be vitally in
terested in these larger issues
ot spiritual lite and death.

dean ot Memorial Church.)
I was pleased to see Maria
Higuera's article on religion at
Stanlord, and with the overall
quality with which she de
scribed a vtry complex
phenomenon and combined
sources with many different
points ot view. It I were not
afraid that some will read a
quote which was accurate, but
which needed its context, to
the ettect that I do not think
doctrine or the existence of
Cod is important, I would not
bother writing.
What I was referring to in
that comment was the in
adequacy ot the category of
"existence" to define the im
portance ot theistic language
and the (utility of pinning life
and-death choices on an
abstract* and unanswerable
question.
"Proofs" tor the existence of
Cod are notorious for failing
the test o! rational proof, and it
seems to me that many people
waste a lot ot time either con
cludingfrom that tact that relig
ion is nonsense, or trying to
equate faith with an "over
beliet" which obscures the
value ot honest questioning.
As Higuera's article made
clear, religious institutions
have tound doubt more dif
ticult to affirm than belief. But
doubt is a critically important
part ot taith, just as adoles
cence is critical to the de
velopment of a mature adult.
