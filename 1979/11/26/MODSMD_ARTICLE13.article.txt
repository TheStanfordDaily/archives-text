In a recent letter to the
editor, the board ot directors
of the Women ot Stantord Law
called lor a retraction ot a Gil
Morales cartoon and also
suggested that an apology was
in order. I teel that an apology
and a retraction are not in or
der. In tact, I would like to see
the Women ot Stantord Law
apologize tor both their mis
leading rhetoric and their of
fensive, repugnant language.
This group maintained that
the Dupie cartoon — in which
one character described his
(apparently successful) pre
natal efforts to avoid an abor
tion — "represented the total
abdication ot an editor's duty
to maintain the moral and intel
lectual quality ot a publica
tion." "Abortion," they stated,
"is not a joke."
While I teel that the latter
point is valid, it is clear that
what these women really
meant to say was that they did
not lind the cartoon tunny.
And all this verbiage about "in
tellectual quality" is a guise tor
a completely different mes
sage: "You can't print what we
don't like."
As I said, I do not think that
abortion is tunny. But I am not
nearly so humorless and
narrow-minded as to loist my
views upon all the Daily's read
ership. As tar as I know — and,
admittedly, I am not a "Man ot
Stantord Law'' — the Daily and
Gil Morales are under no obli
gation to publish views which
coincide with those ot every

group on campus.
In addition, the Women ot
Stantord Law explained that,
since many ot their members
believe in the constitutional
right ot a woman to "control"
her body, it was "absurd and
disgusting" to portray a fetus
as having teelings. In my view,
to say that ascribing teelings to
a letus is "disgusting" is itselt
an insult and a transgression
against humanity.
On the other hand, the
Women ot Stantord Law
explained that to those ot their
members who telt that unborn
children did have souls, the
portrayal of a tetus as an "ob
noxious, conniving little crea
ture is equally offensive." Can
they seriously mean that tor a
tictional letus to hide trom an
abortion is to be conniving and
obnoxious? Perhaps they
would have found it more
humane and sensitive it
Dupie's creator had had the
letus offer itselt up tor exter
mination.
And finally, the tact that
these women go on to accuse
Morales' humor ot making a
"mockery of the sancrosanct
process ot human birth" is ut
terly ludicrous.
So, as far as anger goes, it is
every person at Stantord who
does believe in the sanctity ot
human life that deserves to be
outraged. And it is we who de
serve an apology from the
Women of Stantord Law.
