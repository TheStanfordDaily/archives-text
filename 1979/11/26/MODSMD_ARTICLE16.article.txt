## Iran rally covers up injustice 
### 
I was greatly disturbed and
disappointed with the one
sidedness ot the rhetoric es
poused at the Nov. 19 noon
rally at White Plaza. I heard
much talk ot the "United States
capitalist imperialist oppres
sion" in Iran under the shah's
regime, but little discussion of
the thousands ot murders and
the summary trials before "re
volutionary firing squads"
under the Ayatollah Kho
meini's regime. The speakers
showed much concern tor the
right ot autonomy of the Ira
nian people but showed little
concern for the lives of Ameri
can citizens now being held
hostage.
We were told that the only
solution is to return the shah,
hence justice will be done to
the Iranian people and the lives
ot the Americans will be
spared. I must strongly ques

tion this belief because first, I
do not think that Khomeini's
regime is representative ot the
Iranian people. It is just a radi
cal faction, like the faction that
currently holds our citizens
hostage. Secondly, returning
the shah under the current cir
cumstances would be giving in
to the demands of terrorists
who have blatantly violated in
ternational law.
It seems that the current pol
icy ot the Khomeini regime is to
speak solely on past conflicts in
an attempt to cover up current
injustice. For any group to
think that the Khomeini regime
is the supreme result of the
struggle for the autonomy of
the Iranian people would be
greatly mistaken, and the cur
rent plight ot women's rights
and the Kurdish people greatly
signity that tact.
By Khomeini spurring on his

supporters to overrun the U.S.
Embassy and take all Ameri
cans as hostages, he compel
led his so-called government
to violate international law and
the covenants ot diplomacy. To
return the shah under such cir
cumstances would set a dip
lomatic precedent tor future
terrorist attacks that will en
danger the lives of tens of
thousands of Americans over
seas.
I do, however, agree with
the rally spokesmen that we
should not make any military
intervention in Iran because, in
addition to the threat it poses
to our citizens now captive, it
would be seen as a direct attack
on the Iranian people and their
sovereignty, not just an attack
on the Khomeini regime.
Deportation ol Iranian stu
dents would also be unjust, for
it would only serve to foster a
nationalist and racist hatred by
isolating our peoples. Our
country should use strong dip
lomatic and economic sanc
tions to protest this action.
I would sincerely like to be
lieve the views expressed by
Bob Saibel, who in his speech
at the rally maintained that the
Iranian captors' hatred and ag

gression is directed toward the
illegal actions ot the American
government and its military
industrial supporters, not the
American people.
But I find it hard to believe
the true virtues of the captors
when they hold our people's
lives at bay. Most of these
Americans are not soldiers but
diplomats and office assistants.
Last week, we were told by the
great Ayatollah that it their de
mands are not met, the hos
tages will not be murdered,
rather they will be "tried as
spies and punished under Is
lamic law" (shot or beheaded).
It the captors and the Kho
meini regime were really sin
cere in extraditing the shah to
Iran, why did they not engage
in public outcry and diplomatic
proceedings during the shah's
stay in Mexico instead ot stag
ing this international outrage?
Equally disturbing to me was
the literature handed out by
the Revolutionary Communist
Youth Brigade at the rally.
Their literature greatly assailed
the evils ol the American cor
porate capitalist democracy
but stated nothing about the
oppressiveness ot Khomeini's
rule or the threat to the lives ot
American hostages in Iran.
It does not seem so surpris
ing to me that many students
become so disillusioned over
the controversy when they
constantly hear the protests
and voice of dissent. It seems
that most ot the public protests
on our campus are by groups
who decry the evils ot Ameri
can society in an attempt to es
pouse their philosophy by ap
pealing to the American stu
dents' guilt or sympathy.
It is true that our govern
ment has misled our people
into international disasters,
and we should stand ready to
ridicule these actions and pre
vent their recurrence. Yet, to
see our country as a sole sinner
in international relations is a
very naive view.
Lei us not be at such a loss ot
self-respect as to tolerate such
threats on American lives.
Let us remember that
perhaps why we can hear such
public outcry against the
"American system" as heard at
White Plaza last Monday, is
that our government allows
public dissent and treedom ot
speech, while most other gov
ernments, especially the cur
rent regime in Iran, do not.
