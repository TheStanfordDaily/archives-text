# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Stephen Requa 'Tell an Iranian you are sorry' 
### 
To those who experienced Stanford in
the 60s and went through the episode of
our government's Vietnam episode, the
current Iranian situation gives occasion to
test our political savvy. It also places a re
sponsibility on us toexpand the awareness
ot the global role which American leaders
have tashioned tor us and why it is that we
have in consequence provoked anger and
contempt toward us.
The history oi our country's deprada
tions in Iran are ot clear historical record.
In direct violation ot that country's integ
rity we, through the CIA, brought down
the Mossadegh government and installed
under the shah a regime, the benefit of
which went exclusively to American oil
companies, American arms manufacturers
and the egomaniacal aspirations and delu
sions ot the Pahlavi tyrant.
In the process we destroyed the tradi
tional culture and economy ot Iran, plun
dered its wealth, and condoned and as
sisted the repression and brutalization of
the Iranian people.
The experience ot Iran and her people
with America has been characterized by
our greed, treachery, theft ot Iranian re
sources and implicit involvement in a
tyranny without restraint.

We may recoil from the harsh, tradi
tional, seemingly medieval character ot
the Ayatollah Khomeini. Yet this is exactly
what we have created tor ourselves.
By aborting the process of democratic
evolution in Iran, and by daunting tor de
cades our power and rapaciousness in the
tace ot Iranian national pride, we have
made it possible tor anything else to
emerge in Iran but that which is most tradi
tional, harsh, unyielding and stridently
nationalistic.
The Ayatollah is the last resort ot Iranian
dignity because we have stripped it ot all
other alternatives. Khomeini is our just
reward, as well as the vengeance ot the
spirit of Iran.
America's response to Khomeini must
be tashioned trom a clear consciousness
ot the two factors involved: On the one
hand, the integrity and sentiments of a
people we have plundered and
humiliated, and on the other our own de
sire to save face before the world. So far as
our conduct in Iran has demonstrated, we
have no face to lose.
In creating the rule of the shah, we have
expended already our integrity, our own
founding principles and any pretense of
humane conduct in international aftairs.
The conduct of the Iranian students at the

American Embassy pales in comparison
and isas nothingtoour history ofdeprada
tions in that land.
Should we wish to be conscious ot our
tace before the world, we must tirst recon
struct one insolar as Iran is concerned,
and from scratch. We must demonstrate a
respect lor Iranian national sentiment
(which we have never done) and a willing
ness to own up to our conduct and begin
amends. We have damaged the evolution
ot a whole people.
And, above all, we must resist the temp
tation to use the embassy incident to fan
the tlames oi belligerence. The embassy
events in Tehran have all the possibilities
ot the Tonkin Ciult incident of the Vietnam
debadle.
Will we rush as we did then, to vest
authority and power in the warmongers
and petty jingoists? If so, we will benefit
only those who have thus far protited most
trom the policy in Iran which has brought
about the present circumstance, and we
will expend ourselves in foolish, costly
and criminal involvement overseas.
Begin amends here at Stanford. Tell an
Iranian you're sorry for what your country
has done to his people.
