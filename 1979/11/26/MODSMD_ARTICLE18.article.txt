Dos Equis reply
Last month we ran a series of
ads in your campus newspaper
to introduce our new Dos
Equis light-colored beer. We
have obviously offended some
people, and we wish to
apologize for any harm that we
might have caused.
When we received the first
negative comment, we im
mediately reacted by canceling
all other scheduled ads that
were in question.
In some cases, we were al
ready past deadlines, but in
some circumstances we were
able to even stop our poster
from running.
Since that time, we have cal
led back all the posters and are
going to contribute the paper
to charity for recycling.
The campaign in question
was pre-tested among Anglos
and Mexican-Americans, male
and female, but like so much
research that is done, it obvi

ously failed to identify this par
ticular problem.
All future campaigns for our
products will be more closely
scrutinized to ensure that no
group is prejudiced or embar
rassed.
We are just a small importer,
but we will continue to support
all causes that are discrimi
nated against because of race,
religion or sex.
We have always enjoyed our
close relationship with your
students and their support of
our products. We intend on
working toward continuing
that relationship.

We're not sure what seniors
in engineering Wayne Forster's
been talking to [Daily, Nov.

20), but he's as far off the mark
in gauging student opinion re
garding the Band as he is in
judging the Band itself.
The Band isn't perfect, but its
creativity, spontaneity and en
thusiasm certainly make up for
its shortcomings. Especially
considering the alternative ol a
band like Cal's. The Weenie
Band may be talented and
"smart," but it's also boring as
hell. Who wants to listen to
John Phillip Sousa's Greatest
Hits all the time? ,
Big Game is much more than
just football, though if Wayne's
only been to one game in four
years, he may not realize that.
If the purpose of a band is "to
focus fans' enthusiasm musi
cally," how does Wayne judge
the post-game rallies?
While the victorious Cal
rooters dwindled so in number
that by 4:30 they were out
numbered by their band
(which then left), the LSJUMB
played on past 5 to a singing,

dancing, enthusiastic crowd of
about 2000. The contrast was
even more marked alter last
year's Big Came.
Far from being "ashamed" of
our Band, we're proud ot it and
love its uniqueness. Please
don't tr i lei I us what we
think.

The horror
It seems from Tom Pratt's
piece in the Nov. 15 Daily that it
is the numbers of those
brutalized which forms his
criterion for horror. Or is it that

the Inquisition, the Crusades,
weren t so bad because they
were for his team?
What he has written is that
it's not so bad to kill and maim
in certain situations. What
worries me about his attitude is
that it's not different from
those he, correctly, abhors (Hi
tler to Mao). I'm sure they had
the same kinds of discriminat
ory powers to minimize their
own brutality.
Pratt's attitude frightens me.
I'm no Christian, and one ot
the reasons is because ot the
kind ot attitude he portrayed.
Maybe because I belong to
no team I can focus on the sac
redness of life and feel hor
rified no matter the banner
under which man expresses his
inhumanity to man, no matter
how many are brutalized, kil
led and maimed.

The horror
It seems from Tom Pratt's
piece in the Nov. 15 Daily that it
is the numbers of those
brutalized which forms his
criterion for horror. Or is it that

the Inquisition, the Crusades,
weren t so bad because they
were for his team?
What he has written is that
it's not so bad to kill and maim
in certain situations. What
worries me about his attitude is
that it's not different from
those he, correctly, abhors (Hi
tler to Mao). I'm sure they had
the same kinds of discriminat
ory powers to minimize their
own brutality.
Pratt's attitude frightens me.
I'm no Christian, and one ot
the reasons is because ot the
kind ot attitude he portrayed.
Maybe because I belong to
no team I can focus on the sac
redness of life and feel hor
rified no matter the banner
under which man expresses his
inhumanity to man, no matter
how many are brutalized, kil
led and maimed.

Dos Equis reply
Last month we ran a series of
ads in your campus newspaper
to introduce our new Dos
Equis light-colored beer. We
have obviously offended some
people, and we wish to
apologize for any harm that we
might have caused.
When we received the first
negative comment, we im
mediately reacted by canceling
all other scheduled ads that
were in question.
In some cases, we were al
ready past deadlines, but in
some circumstances we were
able to even stop our poster
from running.
Since that time, we have cal
led back all the posters and are
going to contribute the paper
to charity for recycling.
The campaign in question
was pre-tested among Anglos
and Mexican-Americans, male
and female, but like so much
research that is done, it obvi

ously failed to identify this par
ticular problem.
All future campaigns for our
products will be more closely
scrutinized to ensure that no
group is prejudiced or embar
rassed.
We are just a small importer,
but we will continue to support
all causes that are discrimi
nated against because of race,
religion or sex.
We have always enjoyed our
close relationship with your
students and their support of
our products. We intend on
working toward continuing
that relationship.

All right now
We're not sure what seniors
in engineering Wayne Forster's
been talking to [Daily, Nov.

20), but he's as far off the mark
in gauging student opinion re
garding the Band as he is in
judging the Band itself.
The Band isn't perfect, but its
creativity, spontaneity and en
thusiasm certainly make up for
its shortcomings. Especially
considering the alternative ol a
band like Cal's. The Weenie
Band may be talented and
"smart," but it's also boring as
hell. Who wants to listen to
John Phillip Sousa's Greatest
Hits all the time? ,
Big Game is much more than
just football, though if Wayne's
only been to one game in four
years, he may not realize that.
If the purpose of a band is "to
focus fans' enthusiasm musi
cally," how does Wayne judge
the post-game rallies?
While the victorious Cal
rooters dwindled so in number
that by 4:30 they were out
numbered by their band
(which then left), the LSJUMB
played on past 5 to a singing,

dancing, enthusiastic crowd of
about 2000. The contrast was
even more marked alter last
year's Big Came.
Far from being "ashamed" of
our Band, we're proud ot it and
love its uniqueness. Please
don't tr i lei I us what we
think.
