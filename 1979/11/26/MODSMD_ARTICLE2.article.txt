# University officials investigate degree of sorority autonomy
## 
### Jane West 
One of the major roadblocks to
University recognition of
sororities is the University's con
cern about the independence
local sororities have within their
national organizations.
"Local autonomy is our major
concern," said Jim Lyons, dean of
student affairs, who will make the
final decision. "It must be deter
mined that each sorority can run
its own affairs such as manage
ment, finances and membership.
"We don't want the national or
ganization to be vetoing the
membership ot the locals," said
Lyons. "We must make sure there
is no difference between the prac
tices and the policies. Even
though a sorority might not be
doing something that conflicts
with our regulations, it might still
be in its constitution."

News analysis

If a resolution cannot be found
between national and University
policies, the sororities might not
be recognized, according to sev
eral administrators.
Several sorority presidents said
thev think the University is stal
ling.
"Although we understand that
many other matters are handled in
the residential education office,
we don't really know what is going
on," said )ane Irwin, president of
Pi Beta Phi.
Student Activities Adviser Pat
ricia Brandt said that last spring
the University "felt close to a re
sponse, but then we started
another review which is causing

the additional delay. There's a lot
of work to be done but letters will
go out soon."
Brandt understands that the
process has been frustrating. But,
she said, "If we are careless now,
a couple of years later we would
be looked at as irresponsible."
No reason to stall
Lyons said, "We have no reason
to stall. It's just taking much
longer than I had hoped."
"The decision-making process
is taking so much time," said
Norm Robinson, associate dean
of student affairs, "because we
want to do a very thorough job."
He said he hoped a decision
would be made in a couple of
weeks.
According to Brandt, "the
sororities could have recognition
right away if they had their own
rules.
"The guidelines set by the Uni
versity are important and have
been carefully thought out,"
Brandt said. "Because of the pos
sible conflicts, the sororities
could choose to remain on cam
pus or they could decide to go
local, which could mean being
excepted from certain national
policies or entirely breaking with
the national organization."
Two requirements
She explained that a University
group must fulfill two require
ments. It must have at least five
members and it must be open to
any student. Because sororities
have selective membership, they
must follow guidelines set by the
Office of Residential Education.
One ot these policies says that
selective groups "are expected to

have comparable freedom from
extra-University control."
"The University has a very
strong feeling about allowing stu
dents to develop their organiza
tions according to their own in
terests and values," said Brandt.
Question autonomy
But, because sororities here are
tied to national organizations and
sorority representatives say that
they will follow their national con
stitutions, there is some question
whether they can maintain local
autonomy, according to Brandt.
"Right now," Lyons said, "we
are trying to determine the differ
ences in the constitution of the
national organizations and the
policies of the University groups
by sorting out the real and non
real issues.
"A non-real issue would be a
problem with colloquial wording.
It's taking time to account for the
real meaning of a word in the con
stitutions. Some things that ap
pear troublesome may not be."
Not constraining
Pam Hutchcraft, president of
Kappa Alpha Theta, said, "Our
decision to join the national or
ganization was a good thing. First,
we scrutinized it to see if its rules
dictated or bound us. But they
aren't constraining. They keep
orderand maintain organizations.
"By joining the organization,"
she said, "we're broadening our
experience. Ideas can be ex
changed on a nationwide basis."
If the sororities are recognized,
they will have full access to all
University resources. Until a
couple of weeks ago, the
sororities have been meeting off
campus at apartments or rented
meeting rooms and using Univer
sity facilities only with special
permission.
Would solve problems
The sorority presidents indi
cated that recognition would
help ensure an effective rush,
solve the danger problem con
nected with off-campus meetings
and enable sororities to have
(unctions on campus.
Kathy Kohrman, president of
Alpha Phi, said her sorority "is in
somewhat of a Catch-22. We re
nted a room off campus which has
a contract through December.
We're hoping to find out (about
recognition) before then so we
know whether to renew our

apartment."
"When the decision is made,"
Brandt said, "there will be a clear
statement why some sororities
may not have been recognized.
Then, the groups can meet with
me to go over the exceptions and
understand why such things are
important. A sorority could then
state how they would deal with
such an exception and be moving
towards recognition."
"We're all waiting in anticipa
tion," said Liz Wohlford, Kappa
Kappa Gamma president. In the
meantime, the sororities are al
lowed to meet on campus under a
relaxed enforcement of the "no
meeting on campus" policy, ac
cording to a letter trom Robinson
to Nancy Hoffman, Inter-sorority
Council president.

'Although the University has to
investigate each sorority sepa
rately, the sorority presidents said
they will act together whatever
the decision is, in accordance
with a national sorority agreement
made last year.
Goals
"Our goals are to meet on a
tight-knit basis instead ot a social
one. We want to act as a support
system to each other," Hutchcratt
said.
"The University is worried
about sororities in the long range,
but only people who want to help
reach these goals will be in
terested in joining; thus, these
same values will be continuous
from year to year. There will be an
overlap," she said.
One of the major roadblocks to
University recognition of
sororities is the University's con
cern about the independence

national organizations.
"Local autonomy is our major

mined that each sorority can run
its own affairs such as manage
ment, finances and membership.
"We don't want the national or
ganization to be vetoing the
membership ot the locals," said
Lyons. "We must make sure there
is no difference between the prac
tices and the policies. Even
though a sorority might not be
doing something that conflicts
with our regulations, it might still
be in its constitution."

News analysis

If a resolution cannot be found
between national and University
policies, the sororities might not
be recognized, according to sev
eral administrators.
Several sorority presidents said
thev think the University is stal
ling.
"Although we understand that
many other matters are handled in
the residential education office,
we don't really know what is going
on," said )ane Irwin, president of
Pi Beta Phi.
Student Activities Adviser Pat
ricia Brandt said that last spring
the University "felt close to a re
sponse, but then we started
another review which is causing

the additional delay. There's a lot
of work to be done but letters will
go out soon."
Brandt understands that the
process has been frustrating. But,
she said, "If we are careless now,
a couple of years later we would
be looked at as irresponsible."
No reason to stall
Lyons said, "We have no reason
to stall. It's just taking much
longer than I had hoped."
"The decision-making process
is taking so much time," said
Norm Robinson, associate dean
of student affairs, "because we
want to do a very thorough job."
He said he hoped a decision
would be made in a couple of
weeks.
According to Brandt, "the
sororities could have recognition
right away if they had their own
rules.
"The guidelines set by the Uni
versity are important and have
been carefully thought out,"
Brandt said. "Because of the pos
sible conflicts, the sororities
could choose to remain on cam
pus or they could decide to go
local, which could mean being
excepted from certain national
policies or entirely breaking with
the national organization."
Two requirements
She explained that a University
group must fulfill two require
ments. It must have at least five
members and it must be open to
any student. Because sororities
have selective membership, they
must follow guidelines set by the
Office of Residential Education.
One ot these policies says that
selective groups "are expected to

have comparable freedom from
extra-University control."
"The University has a very
strong feeling about allowing stu
dents to develop their organiza
tions according to their own in
terests and values," said Brandt.
Question autonomy
But, because sororities here are
tied to national organizations and
sorority representatives say that
they will follow their national con
stitutions, there is some question
whether they can maintain local
autonomy, according to Brandt.
"Right now," Lyons said, "we
are trying to determine the differ
ences in the constitution of the
national organizations and the
policies of the University groups
by sorting out the real and non
real issues.
"A non-real issue would be a
problem with colloquial wording.
It's taking time to account for the
real meaning of a word in the con
stitutions. Some things that ap
pear troublesome may not be."
Not constraining
Pam Hutchcraft, president of
Kappa Alpha Theta, said, "Our
decision to join the national or
ganization was a good thing. First,
we scrutinized it to see if its rules
dictated or bound us. But they
aren't constraining. They keep
orderand maintain organizations.
"By joining the organization,"
she said, "we're broadening our
experience. Ideas can be ex
changed on a nationwide basis."
If the sororities are recognized,
they will have full access to all
University resources. Until a
couple of weeks ago, the
sororities have been meeting off
campus at apartments or rented
meeting rooms and using Univer
sity facilities only with special
permission.
Would solve problems
The sorority presidents indi
cated that recognition would
help ensure an effective rush,
solve the danger problem con
nected with off-campus meetings
and enable sororities to have
(unctions on campus.
Kathy Kohrman, president of
Alpha Phi, said her sorority "is in
somewhat of a Catch-22. We re
nted a room off campus which has
a contract through December.
We're hoping to find out (about
recognition) before then so we
know whether to renew our

apartment."
"When the decision is made,"
Brandt said, "there will be a clear
statement why some sororities
may not have been recognized.
Then, the groups can meet with
me to go over the exceptions and
understand why such things are
important. A sorority could then
state how they would deal with
such an exception and be moving
towards recognition."
"We're all waiting in anticipa
tion," said Liz Wohlford, Kappa
Kappa Gamma president. In the
meantime, the sororities are al
lowed to meet on campus under a
relaxed enforcement of the "no
meeting on campus" policy, ac
cording to a letter trom Robinson
to Nancy Hoffman, Inter-sorority
Council president.

'Although the University has to
investigate each sorority sepa
rately, the sorority presidents said
they will act together whatever
the decision is, in accordance
with a national sorority agreement
made last year.
Goals
"Our goals are to meet on a
tight-knit basis instead ot a social
one. We want to act as a support
system to each other," Hutchcratt
said.
"The University is worried
about sororities in the long range,
but only people who want to help
reach these goals will be in
terested in joining; thus, these
same values will be continuous
from year to year. There will be an
overlap," she said.
One of the major roadblocks to
University recognition of
sororities is the University's con
cern about the independence
local sororities have within their
national organizations.
"Local autonomy is our major
concern," said Jim Lyons, dean of
student affairs, who will make the
final decision. "It must be deter
mined that each sorority can run
its own affairs such as manage
ment, finances and membership.
