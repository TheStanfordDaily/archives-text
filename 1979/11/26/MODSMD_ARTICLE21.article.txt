# Stanford edges Cal for third place; Kalbus makes all-tourney
## Gauchos dash poloists' title hopes SPORTS 
### Brad Brockbank 
Long Beach â€” It wasn't en
tirely surprising that Stanford
and California concluded their
1979 water polo seasons as op
ponents last night at the NCAA
Championship Tournament
here.
What was surprising, how
ever, was that the Cards' 11-10
victory was for third place, not
the national title.
Stanford was beaten in the
semifinals Saturday night by
UC-Santa Barbara, which went
on to win the championship
yesterday with an 11-3 thrash
ing ot UCLA. The Bruins had
reached the finals by virtue ot
an emotionally-sparked upset
over Cal just before the
Gauchos surprised the Cardi
nals.
The most satisfying victory
yesterday, however, was the
selection of Card captain
Randy Kalbus to the NCAA
All-Tournament first team.
Kalbus, a senior, was playing in
his final NCAA tournament for

Stanford.
Sophomore Jody Campbell
and freshman )amie Bergeson
were chosen to the second
team.
The Cards started the tour
ney on a positive note Saturday
afternoon, coasting to an easy
13-5 victory over Brown Uni
versity. Stanford jumped out to
a 5-0 lead before three minutes
had elapsed in the game, and
after the Cards had amassed a
9-3 halftime advantage, head
coach Dante Dettamanti pulled
his starters and let the second
team finish the operation.
Stanford's hopes of success
fully defending its national title
were given an extra boost that
night when UCLA out-psyched
the Bears, beating them 10-9
primarily through the
superhuman efforts of goalie
David Rosen.
But Card hopes were sunk
slightly more than an hour la
ter, when Chris Kelsey's
mildly-disputed offensive foul
gave Santa Barbara the ball

with three seconds left and a
10-9 lead.
It was ironic that the Cards
and the Bears lost by identical
10-9 scores. Cal and Stanford
had hoarded the national title
for the previous six years, with
the Bears taking it in 1973,1974,
1975 and 1977, and the Cards
stealing it from them in 1976
and 1978.
)ust as ironically, the pat
terns of the two games Satur
day were of a similar mold. Like
Cal, Stanford held a one-goal
halftime lead over its oppo
nents, only to lose it after the
tenacious Southerners fought
back to an 8-8 tie in both
games.
Campbell, whose two goals
helped stake the Cards to a 7-6
halftime edge, had meanwhile
collected two ejections, and
his last came midway through
the third period.
With three major fouls of his
own, sophomore Alan
Mouchawar joined his

classmate on the bench early in
the fourth quarter, after the
Cauchos had scrambled back
to an 8-8 tie.
The loss of the two offensive
stalwarts marked the turning
point of the game. The
usually-potent Cardinal of
fense showed definite signs of
panic, as the inexperience of
the defense-oriented substi
tutes resulted in several missed
scoring chances.
Santa Barbara, sensing vic
tory, scored two goals early in
the fourth period, and Stan
ford's fate was effectively sea
led.
Bergeson's goal with 41 sec
onds left and an ensuing
Caucho ejection gave the Card
faithful a slight glimmer of
hope. But Kelsey, in attempt
ing to recover a blocked Stan
ford shot during the extra-man
effort, was called fora foul, and
the Cauchos were a step closer
to their first national title.
The consolation match for
Cal and Stanford yesterday was

a somewhat lackadaisical effort
on the part of both teams, with
the two Pacific-10 Conference
rivals playing almost obligator
ily to an exciting finish.
Though Cal led by one or
two goals for three quarters,
outstanding efforts by Steve
Smith and Greg Lambert kept
the Cards close. In the fourth
quarter, goals by Smith,
Campbell and Mouchawar
forged a Stanford victory.
"I feel likethechampionship
game was played against Santa
Barbara Saturday," Dettamanti
said. "I thought we played re
ally well in the first half (of that
game) until we lost )ody. You
could tell everybody let down
after that."
Caucho head coach Pete
Snyder also recognized the in
fluence of Campbell and other
Card veterans.
"They have some very ex
perienced players," Snyder
said, "but when those players
are out, it's a very different
ballclub."
