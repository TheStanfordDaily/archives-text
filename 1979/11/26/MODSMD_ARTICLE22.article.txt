# lowa blasts Cards, 77-36
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Not only does the University
of lowa sport a dynamite
wrestling team, but its swim
team packs a powerful clout as
well. The Stanford men's
swimming team can attest only
too well to the swimming abil
ity of Midwest farm boys, as
they were crushed 77-36 by the
improving Hawkeyes in a dual
meet at deCuerre Pools Friday.
Emerging from the previous
week's mauling by an identical
score over the waning dynasty
of Indiana University, the
Hawks were in top form for
their weekend competition
against the Cards and the
equally humiliated Cal Bears.
Saturday, the lowa forces, who
managed a mere 24th in last
year's NCAA championships,
deposed Cal's reigning
monarchs, 79-34.
The Cards were plunged to
the bottom ranks from the out
start by a team which was obvi
ously physically stronger if
somewhat unorthodox. Main
taining rigorous practice
schedules, the Cardinals man
aged to eke out only three vic
tories in 13 total events.
Canadian import Wade Fle
mons windmilled to an easy
looking win in the 200 yard
backstroke in a solid 1:53.10, a
full three seconds over his
closest pursuit from lowa.
Freshman (ohn Simons swept
to a 4.5 second victory with an
excellent 2:06.0 in the 200
breaststroke over lowa co
captain Mike Hurley. Simons
and Flemons also tinished a
close two-three respectively in
the 200 individual medley.
Sophomore Bryan McCleve,
the Cards' lone member ot the
diving corps, nabbed the first
spot in the three-meter diving

with two successful tinal dives.
Concentrating on harder di
ves, McCleve placed second
against his two lowa oppo
nents in the one-meter
springboard event.
Distance man Barry Weick
performed admirably garner
ing the runner-up position
against chugging competition
in both the marathon 1000
freestyle and the 500 tree
(4:38.01). Senior Tom O'Brien
and Monte Brown closed in
upon lowa's johnny Roberts in
the 200 butterfly with narrow
second- and third-place
finishes in 1:5*.21 and 1:53.55
respectively.
Tight from training, the
Cards were completely over
whelmed by the Hawkeyes in

the sprints. Senior Bob Hag
berg clocked a 21.66 third in
the 50 free, but Stanford was
left out in the cold in the 100
and 200 treestylt's by the relent
less lowa onslaught. Card re
lays were also lett high and dry.
The Stanford men's and
women's teams will host the
highly regarded Stanford Invi
tational Friday, Saturday and
Sunday. The meet features na
tionally heralded teams and
individuals.
