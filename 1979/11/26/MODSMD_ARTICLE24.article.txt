Riyadh, Saudia Arabia — Saudi troops routed armed
invaders tram the upper floor of Mecca's Grand Mosque
in a bloody battle that lett part of the huge shrine in
llames, a diplomat said yesterday.
A Saudi official said some ot the invaders still held
hostages in the basement.
"The whole mosque is under our control," Sheik
Ahmad /aki Vamani, the Saudi oil minister, told repor
ters. "Some gangs are still in the basement, but there is
no danger from them."
Diplomatic sources said the Saudis reopened a por
tion of the mosque tor public worship yesterday lor the
lirst time since dissident Moslems following a selt
proclaimed prophet seized the Moslem world's most
sacred shrine Tuesday.
King Khaled ordered his U.S.-trained national guard
troops into a decisive battle lor the mosque Saturday
night after losing patience with an earlier plan to try to
starve the invaders into surrendering, the diplomat said.
Casualties were said to be heavy and the diplomat said
the end was "dramatic and violent."
The Saudi government issued no statement on the
lighting and provided no estimates ol the number of
persons involved. Unofficial estimates put the minimum
number of raiders at 200, hostages at 20 and total casual
ties at 50.
The late ol the self-proclaimed Mahdi, or prophet,
was not known, but informed sources said last night that
he apparently had been captured. One report identified
him only as Johaiman, and said he was a member of the
tribe ol Moslems known as Oteiba who are concen
trated in southern Saudi Arabia near the border with
North Yemen.
Israel returns Suez Gulf to Egypt
Tel Aviv, Israel Israel turned back another section of
the Sinai Peninsula the oil-rich Gulf of Suez —to Egypt
yesterday and entered a new era of buying oil from its
former enemy.
The cost to Israel of the deal — at least $350 million a
year in petroleum — was noted by Israeli newspapers
that mourned the end ot the "black gold."
One newspaper, Maariv, called the loss of Israel's only
substantial petroleum source the "most far-reaching
and most dangerous" sacrifice in the peace agreement.
Israel captured tfie Sinai in the 1967 war and is now
making phased withdrawals under the Egyptian-Israeli
peace pact.
The offshore Alma oil lield, developed by the Israelis
near the southern tip of the peninsula, was the most
important part of the package.
In taking over the Alma field ol 12 wells, Egypt receives
its biggest financial benefit from the pact. In January,
Israeli forces will withdraw from the militarily strategic
central Sinai mountain passes ot Gidi and Mitla.
