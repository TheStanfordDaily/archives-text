# 'ran crisis 'grave threat to world peace'
## Waldheim convenes Security Council 
### 
United Nations (AP) — U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim
called for an urgent meeting of the
Security Council on the U.S.-Iranian
crisis yesterday, saying the crisis
poses a grave threat to world peace.
In Washington, the Carter ad
ministration said it "strongly sup
ported" Waldheim's request.

It was 3 a.m. in Tehran when the
Secretary-General issued his appeal
and Iranian officials were not im
mediately available for comment.
State Department officials in
Washington denied that the ad
ministration's support of Wal
dheim's appeal represented a con
cession to Iran, since that country
previously had sought a Security
Council meeting.
The State Department earlier had
opposed Iran's request, insisting that
49 Americans being held hostage at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran be treed
first.
Hostages healthy
In Iran, the hostages are healthy
but "anxious" and are still being kept
with their hands loosely bound, ac
cording to Rep. George Hansen (R-
Idaho), the first American allowed to
visit the captives. He saw some ot the
hostages yesterday.
Tens of thousands of Iranians sh
outing anti-American slogans
marched to the occupied embassy
yesterday. No violent incidents were
reported.
A State Department official told
reporters the United States agreed to
the meeting because it was consi
dered certain that the council would
adopt a strong resolution supporting
the American contention that the
hostages be released immediately
and without precondition. The offi
cial asked not to be identified.
The embassy in Tehran was seized
Nov. 4 by Iranian militants who said
the Americans would not be released

until deposed Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, who is undergoing
medical treatment in a New York
hospital, was returned to Iran to
stand trial.
Meeting soon
Announcing his decision at a news
conference at U.N. headquarters,
Waldheim said he expected the
meeting to be "very soon" but gave
no date.
He said he wanted the 15-nation
council to "deal with the crisis situa
tion in the relations between the Un
ited States and Iran."
"In my opinion," he said, "tension
has now escalated to such an extent
that a threat has been created not
only to the peace and stability to the
region but to the entire world."
Article 99
Waldheim requested the meeting
under Article 99 of the U.N. Charter
which empowers the Secretary-
General to bring to the Security
Council's attention "any matter
which in his opinion may threaten
the maintenance of international
peace and security."
Iran'sofficial Pars newsagency had
announced earlier yesterday in
Tehran that the Revolutionary Coun
cil's acting Foreign Minister,
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, would fly to
New York today to address the coun
cil and demand that the United States
send the shah back to Iran.
But hours later, a government
spokesman said Bani Sadr's trip
would be postponed for a week be
cause of a religious holiday and a

constitutional referendum.
Request letter sent
Waldheim's request for the meet
ing was contained in a letter he sent
to the council president for
November, Bolivian Ambassador
Sergio Palacios de Vizzio. The sec
retary general called the crisis
threatening and concluded:
"I ask lhat the Security Council be
convened urgently in an effort to
seek a peaceful solution to the prob
lem in conformity with the principles
of justice and international law."
Waldheim told reporters his action
was his own decision.
Navy helicopters
Meanwhile, it was learned last
week that the Navy has sent some
mine warfare helicopters to the
Pacitii fleet from the U.S. east coast
aboard giant Air Force C-5 transport
planes.
Sources said the helicopters can
either lay mines orsweep minefields.
Officials refused to say where the
helicopters will be positioned.
There are several potential options
available to senior U.S. officials for
punishing actions against Iran, if cir
cumstances warrant them.
The carriers could be moved into
the Gulf of Oman, from which they
could launch bomber strikes against
oilfields in southern Iran. Aerial
tanker planes could be used to ex
tend the range of the carrier-based
bombers.
Such strikes, experts believe,
could seriously damage Iran's oil
production.

until deposed Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, who is undergoing
medical treatment in a New York
hospital, was returned to Iran to
stand trial.
Meeting soon
Announcing his decision at a news
conference at U.N. headquarters,
Waldheim said he expected the
meeting to be "very soon" but gave
no date.
He said he wanted the 15-nation
council to "deal with the crisis situa
tion in the relations between the Un
ited States and Iran."
"In my opinion," he said, "tension
has now escalated to such an extent
that a threat has been created not
only to the peace and stability to the
region but to the entire world."
Article 99
Waldheim requested the meeting
under Article 99 of the U.N. Charter
which empowers the Secretary-
General to bring to the Security
Council's attention "any matter
which in his opinion may threaten
the maintenance of international
peace and security."
Iran'sofficial Pars newsagency had
announced earlier yesterday in
Tehran that the Revolutionary Coun
cil's acting Foreign Minister,
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, would fly to
New York today to address the coun
cil and demand that the United States
send the shah back to Iran.
But hours later, a government
spokesman said Bani Sadr's trip
would be postponed for a week be
cause of a religious holiday and a

constitutional referendum.
Request letter sent
Waldheim's request for the meet
ing was contained in a letter he sent
to the council president for
November, Bolivian Ambassador
Sergio Palacios de Vizzio. The sec
retary general called the crisis
threatening and concluded:
"I ask lhat the Security Council be
convened urgently in an effort to
seek a peaceful solution to the prob
lem in conformity with the principles
of justice and international law."
Waldheim told reporters his action
was his own decision.
Navy helicopters
Meanwhile, it was learned last
week that the Navy has sent some
mine warfare helicopters to the
Pacitii fleet from the U.S. east coast
aboard giant Air Force C-5 transport
planes.
Sources said the helicopters can
either lay mines orsweep minefields.
Officials refused to say where the
helicopters will be positioned.
There are several potential options
available to senior U.S. officials for
punishing actions against Iran, if cir
cumstances warrant them.
The carriers could be moved into
the Gulf of Oman, from which they
could launch bomber strikes against
oilfields in southern Iran. Aerial
tanker planes could be used to ex
tend the range of the carrier-based
bombers.
Such strikes, experts believe,
could seriously damage Iran's oil
production.
United Nations (AP) — U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim
called for an urgent meeting of the
Security Council on the U.S.-Iranian
crisis yesterday, saying the crisis
poses a grave threat to world peace.
In Washington, the Carter ad
ministration said it "strongly sup
ported" Waldheim's request.

It was 3 a.m. in Tehran when the
Secretary-General issued his appeal
and Iranian officials were not im
mediately available for comment.
State Department officials in
Washington denied that the ad
ministration's support of Wal
dheim's appeal represented a con
cession to Iran, since that country
previously had sought a Security
Council meeting.
The State Department earlier had
opposed Iran's request, insisting that
49 Americans being held hostage at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran be treed
first.
Hostages healthy
In Iran, the hostages are healthy
but "anxious" and are still being kept
with their hands loosely bound, ac
cording to Rep. George Hansen (R-
Idaho), the first American allowed to
visit the captives. He saw some ot the
hostages yesterday.
Tens of thousands of Iranians sh
outing anti-American slogans
marched to the occupied embassy
yesterday. No violent incidents were
reported.
A State Department official told
reporters the United States agreed to
the meeting because it was consi
dered certain that the council would
adopt a strong resolution supporting
the American contention that the
hostages be released immediately
and without precondition. The offi
cial asked not to be identified.
The embassy in Tehran was seized
Nov. 4 by Iranian militants who said
the Americans would not be released

until deposed Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, who is undergoing
medical treatment in a New York
hospital, was returned to Iran to
stand trial.
