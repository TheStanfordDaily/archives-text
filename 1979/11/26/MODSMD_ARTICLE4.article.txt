# Medicare to aid transplant work

In a long-awaited decision Medi
care has agreed to fund part of the
cost of heart transplant operations at
the Medical Center, according to a
telegram sent to Blue Cross (the in
termediary for Medicare in Califor
nia) by the Public Health Service.
Pat Schoeni, director of Public Af
fairs in the Health Care Financing
Administration (NCFA), said the
temporary decision was based on
Public Health Services "best know
ledge and review of what Stanford
has done." Final word will not be av
ailable until after )an. 1.
Although Medicare has never offi
cially covered heart transplant opera
tions, some patients who qualified

for Medicare because they were
"permanently and totally disabled by
disease" received some funds until
May 1979.
At that time the Dept. of Health
Education and Welfare (HEW) began
to assess the validity of these opera
tions to determine whether they
were "reasonable and necessary for
the diagnosis and treatment of ill
ness" or still experimental.
All funds were then withdrawn,
forcing the Med Center to use much
of the government grant it receives
for research to cover the cost of op
erations, some which cost as much as
$100,000.
Thus, Massachusetts fireman Ered
Kelley, rejected last month as a

transplant candidate here, could not
receive any Medicare aid for his
examination or the operation, had
it been authorized.
According to Med Center News
Director Bill Snyder, the 12-year-old
heart transplant program here is the
most active in the world. Seventy of
the 177 people who have received
transplants here since 1968 are still
living. Of 103 of those patients trom
December 1973 to May 1979, 37 re
ceived aid from Medicare, granted
on a patient-by-patient basis.
