## Thailand builds refugee camp 
### 
Khao I Dang, Thailand (AP) —
Reliet workers raced to pre
pare a vast new refugee camp
last week but leaders of the es
timated 400,000 Cambodians
camped inside Cambodia at
the Thai border said most
would refuse to be resettled.
Planners estimated about
200,000 ot the organized re
fugees would enter the camp,
but on a last-minute visit to the
site, Cambodian refugee lead
ers said no more than 30,000 of
the sick and aged would come.
The Cambodians — includ

ing anti-communist "free
Khmer" fighters and their sup
porters — are now camped in a
huge city of huts along the
border, endangered by troops
from Vietnam who invaded
Dec. 25, 1978 and ran out the
Chinese-supported regime of
Cambodian Premier Pol Pot.
Thailand decided last week
to move the camp here, to a
safer place, four miles inside
Thailand, and 130 miles east of
Bangkok.
But tree Khmer leader Van
Saren said "I will not surren

der," as he stood amid
bulldozers raising clouds of
dust on the new camp site. "If
our people move here it will be
like a retreat. We will stay and
fight."
Work on the camp, or
ganized by the U.N. High
Commissioner for refugees,
has been going on around the
clock since last Sunday. When
completed, it will be the largest
in Thailand, almost equal to all
the other refugee camps to
gether.
The evacuation will include

20 buses and a number of am
bulance trucks, with the goal ot
transporting 8000 people a day.
Relief workers are hurrying
to prepare shelters, a working
hospital and water tanks to
avoid the disorganization jnd
loss of life that came last month
with the hurried move to the
crowded Sa Kaew camp, 100
miles east ot Bangkok.
Khao I Dang's camp coor
dinator Mark Brown said the
evacuation is being made as a
"humanitarian gesture" by the
Thais who "realized a Viet
namese offensive is building
up and that these people will
be pushed into Thailand."
But Van Saren said il the Vie
tnamese attack, "our men will
fight back. We will not come
into Thailand."
He Said he had 6000 soldiers,
while another leader, Moon
Sary, claimed to have 5000 sol
diers in his separate settle
ments. Vietnam has tens of
thousands of troops inside
Cambodia, and is still fighting
battles with remnants of the
Pol Pot forces.
Food and medical supplies
from international agencies
continue to reach both tree
Khmer camps, but Van Saren
said while he had enough am
munition, he could use more
food.
Standing on the site of the
Khao I Dang camp, he said
"Now we won't have to worry
about the sick and the weak.
We will be able to tiuht."
