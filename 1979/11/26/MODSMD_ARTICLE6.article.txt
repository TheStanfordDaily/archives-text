London (AP) — Anthony
Blunt, the British art historian
who spied for Moscow, carried
out a secret mission in Ger
many for King George VI soon
after World War II to retrieve
sensitive documents on the
Duke of Windsor's relation
ship with Nazi leaders, the
Sunday Times reported.
Buckingham Palace declined
comment. The paper said
Blunt's mission was confirmed
by historian Hugh Trevor-
Roper, then an official of Bri
tain's Secret Intelligence Ser
vice who later wa<- named Lord
Dacre.
The Sunday Times said the
mission also was confirmed by

the family of Prince Philip of
Hesse, related to the British
royal family, who kept the
documents hidden in theircas
tle near Frankfurt, Germany,
throughout the war.
The newspaper said most of
the papers were family letters
written by Queen Victoria to
her German relatives. But they
apparently also included
documents concerning con
tacts between the Duke of
Windsor and Adolf Hitler
which, it publicized, would
seriously embarrass the British
royal family.
Nazi sympathies
The late Duke of Windsor
was King George's brother,

who abdicated the British
throne in 1936 to marry Ameri
can divorcee Wallis Simpson.
He held pre-war sympathies
for the Nazi regime and met
with Hitler and other top Nazis
before war broke out in 1939.
Blunt, now 72, was identified
by Prime Minister Margaret
T hatcher 10 days ago as a Soviet
agent who was recruited at
Cambridge University in the
1930s and who confessed in
1964 in exchange for immunity
from prosecution.
Blunt was linked with a
high-echelon Soviet spy ring
that included British defectors
Kim Philby, Guy Burgess and
Donald Mclean.
Britain shocked
The unmasking of Blunt
shocked Britain. Queen
Elizabeth II stripped him of the
knighthood she had conferred
in 1956 for services to the royal
family's art collection.
Blunt has said he became a
Soviet agent in the 1930s be
cause he "believed it was the
right thing to do in the cause of
anti-fascism."
"Now I realize bitterly that
this was totally wrong," said
Blunt, interviewed at his
lawyer's office in his first public
appearance since his spy role
was exposed publicly.
He claimed information he
passed to the Soviet Union
while working for British
counter-intelligence during
World War II was of minor
value and he became progres
sively so disillusioned with the
Russians that by 1951, when
pressed to flee to Moscow, he
refused.
