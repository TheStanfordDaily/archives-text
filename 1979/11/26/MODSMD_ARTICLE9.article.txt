Tunis, Tunisia (AP) — Iraq
asked Arab countries to use
their "very effective weapon"
— oil — to punish Israel and its
allies, but moderates moved to
block any oil embargo at the
Arab League summit confer
ence last week.
League Secretary-General
Chedli Klibi of Tunisia rejected
a proposal to admit the non-
Arabic but militant Moslem
Iranian regime to attend the
meeting as an observer.
Iran's revolutionary leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
sent a delgation anyway to
Tunis to seek support in its
confrontation with the United
States over the seizure of the

U.S. Lmbassy and American
hostages in Tehran.
There was disarray at the
summit, which was convened
primarily to map strategy
against Israel and re-establish
the Lebanese government's
control over southern Leba
non.
Sadat criticized
Egypt, the largest Arab na
tion, was expelled from the
Arab League at a summit meet
ing last year in Baghdad, Iraq,
for signing a peace pact with
Israel, and Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat was the target of
renewed criticism at the Tunis
summit.
But Algeria and Morocco, in

a dispute over the former
Spanish Sahara, along with
Libya, Mauritania and Oman
sent lower-level officials.
Delegation sources said the
hard-line governments of Libya
and Syria and the Palestine
Liberation Organization fa
vored granting Iran observer
status, but they were opposed
by Saudi Arabia, a moderate,
and Iraq, which has been hav
ing border disputes with Iran.
'Controversy'
Khomeini named a delega
tion headed by Ghazi Mod
aressi and league officials said
the move led to "considerable
controversy," even before the
!• nians arrived.

Klibi told a news conference
he would not admit Khomeini's
group unless the summit over
ruled his decision that the
league's statutes exclude ob
servers from non-Arab gov
ernments.
Libya and Syria are the only
two league nations that have
expressed support of the Nov.
4 takeover of the U.S. Embassy
by Iranian militants.
League sources said Libyan
Foreign Minister Ali Triki not
only demanded admission of
the Iranian delegation but also
renewed his call for joint Arab
reprisals against America for
treezing Iranian government
assets in the United States.
