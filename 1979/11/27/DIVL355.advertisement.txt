To Members of the Stanford Community
Interested in Commencement:
Although Commencement 1980 may seem a long way off to most of
you, the staff and students responsible for planning Commencement have
already given it an unusual amount of attention. Since early September, the
Public Events staff has been meeting with the senior class presidents and
members of the administration and faculty to solve two major problems
facing Commencement: lack of space and lack of chairs.
Since the early seventies, there has been a steady growth in the number of
students attending Commencement. For several years, tickets have been
limited to four per participant. In 1979, it became apparent that we had
reached capacity in Frost. Since interest in Commencement shows no sign
of decreasing, we must either limit tickets to three per participant or move to a
larger facility — Stanford Stadium. While it is desirable to have
Commencement in a beautiful setting like Frost, it is also desirable that each
graduate have as many relatives and friends present as wish to come.
The problem was complicated this year when we received notice that the
chairs we rent for Commencement weekend activities are no longer
available from our traditional source or any other sources. We have
investigated purchasing the 18,000 chairs required for Commencement
weekend. Although the financial analysis of this purchase is rather complex,
the financial impact over the next ten years can be expressed rather simply
by comparing the additional cost of purchase to the savings related to the
move to the stadium. To purchase chairs will add $7000 to the existing
Commencement budget each year for ten years. The move to the stadium
will save $22,000 a year. Looking a few years ahead, it is not clear that
interest in Commencement will peak; if it continues to increase, we will be
forced to move from Frost regardless of chairs.
The problem is a difficult one for it requires that a decision be made
between the aesthetics and tradition of Frost and the efficiency and
practicality of the stadium. Before a decision is made, we would like to hear
from the members of the Stanford community about this issue. Although the
senior class is most effected by this change, there are also a large number of
graduate and professional students involved in Commencement. We would
also like to hear from those of you who will graduate in the next few years. It
will be helpful to us if you state your affiliation in your letter, i.e. class of 1980,
graduate student, faculty, etc. Please send your comments to Susie Farr,
Office of Public Events, or stop by the Public Events office in the Press
Courtyard across Santa Teresa Street from Bowman Alumni House. You
may also drop off your letter at the senior class presidents office in the ASSU
loft. Because we would like to make a decision by the beginning of winter
quarter, we would like to hear from you by December 5.
