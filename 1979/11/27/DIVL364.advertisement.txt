4 DECEMBER 1979
ENGINEERS!! Are you ready?? — If so, then look at the glory of
the great Northwest — clean air, skiing, sailing, backpacking, and golf the
year around for the hardy. All this and a chance to assume an independent
role as an engineer using the latest state of the art equipment with
challenging "hands on" assignments in ship testing, weapons systems
analysis, failure analysis, and equipment repair and testing.
The Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station will be interviewing
engineering majors on campus December 4, 1979.
