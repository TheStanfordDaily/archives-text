# Gorillas adapt to new home
## 
### Bob Deyling 
Former campus residents Koko
and Michael, the language-using
gorillas, are having some difficulty
adapting to their new Woodside
home.
Both Koko, age 8, and Michael,
age 6, initially suffered a loss of
appetite, became quiet and sub
dued, and were much less con
versational. The gorillas' trainer,
Dr. Francine "Penny" Patterson
said, "Michael seems to enjoy his
new surroundings and he
bounced back to normal within
about a week, but Koko continued
to show signs of distress for two
weeks and still requests that her
front window be covered with a
shade used at night and that the
lignts be kept off. 'Love have dark
there good,' is what Koko tells us
in sign language.
Atter several years on campus
with her gorilla experiment, Pat
terson received a doctorate in
psychology for her work last
spring. With no formal ties to the
University remaining, she was re
quested to vacate University pre
mises and moved to the approved
Woodside location last month.
"The hilltop site provides a
more natural, peaceful environ
ment for the gorillas — redwoods
and Iruit trees, open space and a
seasonal c reek — but any change

is stressful for the gorillas, who
are creatures of habit to an even
greater extent than are humans,"
Patterson said.
The move was also hard on
some of the human participants in
the project, and several of them
found that they could no longer
continue their involvement.
Those losses also contributed to
Koko's depression. "We tried to
prepare both gorillas for the move
by telling them about the new
home, but Koko thinks she is
somehow responsible that some
people could not continue in the
project," Patterson said.
Koko takes blame
"She thinks she was bad or
mean to them and that is the
reason they quit. In general, I feel
humans adapt more easily to a
change like this which involved
separation from friends. There
was a lot more happening outside
their (the gorillas') trailer at Stan
ford for them to observe than
there is here in Woodside," she
added.
Additionally, the move has
placed a heavy financial burden
on Patterson's Gorilla Founda
tion, which used most of its ac
cumulated funds for the down
payment on the new site. The
foundation must also make

monthly mortgage payments of
$2000 on the $200,000 debt it in
curred to secure the site for the
establishment of an independent
Primate Language Institute.
A $30,000 grant from the Na
tional Geographic Society for the
one-year continuation of Patter
son's work with Kokoand Michael
covers costs involved with the
maintenance of the research but
does not extend to mortgage
payments.
Unexpected outcome
"One reason this financial
commitment is a problem is that it
was unexpected," Patterson said.
"We had hoped to be allowed to
continue our work at Stanford for
another year or more so that the
Gorilla Foundation could make
arrangements for use of other
facilities or raise enough money
through contributions to buy
land."
University officials informed
Patterson late last year that the
research would be allowed to
continue for two more years. But
the University earlier this year
moved the deadline to Aug. 1,
1979. Administrators cited the risk
factor of having the gorillas on
campus and the lack of a definite
faculty sponsor for the project as
the reasons for cutting the dead
