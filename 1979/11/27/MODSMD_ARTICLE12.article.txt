# Aqua-thon benefits handicapped
## 
### Lisa Adler 
People have different talents and
abilities. For some, writing a cohereht
paragraph is as difficult as solving a com
plex math problem, while for others taking
a step or swimming one lap is a remarkable
achievement.
Take Robin, for example. A client at the
C.A.R. (Community Association for the
Retarded) Swim Center, Robin can only
swim with assistance: someone must kick
his feet tor him and guide him while he
moves his arms about eight or nine inches
into the water.
Yet Robin, along withapproximately 300
other people in the Bay Area (including
University students), is participating in
the C.A.R. Wedde Handiswimmers'
Aqua-thon Nov. 26 — Dec. 1.
According to Corby Kessler, a junior
here and staff member at the C.A.R. Swim
Center, each participant tries to swim as
many laps as possible in the allotted 30
minutes; participants solicit sponsors to
pay a set fee per lap.
"We realize that we are working with
people with different abilities so it is our
hope that each participant will attempt to
do as much as he or she can physically
accomplish," Kessler said.
Though Kessler conceded that some of
the participants in the Aqua-thon may not
fully understand what they are doing be
cause of their handicaps, it is the achieve
ment of actually swimming that matters —
even it it takes help to swim across the
specially designed pool at the swim
center.
This is the first time that anything like
this has been done at the C.A.R. Swim

Center according to Bruce Moore, assis
tant director. He said that the goals of the
project included raising money to ease the
center's deficit, increasing awareness
within the community about the center,
and alerting people as to what the center
actually does.
Neither Kessler nor Moore has any
idea of how many people are involved or
how much money the project will yield. "I
hope the Aqua-thon is successful because
the potential for raising money is defi
nitely there," Moore stated.
As far as participation goes, Kessler
wanted to see 80 percent of the center's
500 clients participate in the Aqua-thon
Some have already made provisions for
the upcoming event. )im C., a 27 year-old
client at the C.A.R. Swim Center, said he is
really excited about the Aqua-thon be
cause "it will be a real challenge."
He presently has 20 sponsors which in
clude parents and friends. ]im said he
plans to swim 30 laps at the center.
Abe Bailey, a local resident who is also a
client at the swim center, has vowed to
"do everything I can to help out in the
Aqua-thon." Due to a stroke, Bailey can
operate only one side of his body, but he
intends to swim 12 laps in the 30 minutes.
Many university students are also par
ticipating. Word of the Aqua-thon spread
via posters, SWOPSI classes and swim
team members.
Kessler was assisted in publicizing the
event by the Stanford Volunteers for the
Handicapped. Together they put up 500
posters and passed sponsor sheets out
through residences.

The swim center is geared tor the exclu
sive use ot persons of all ages with physi
cal, mental or emotional disabilities. The
pool is equipped with a wheelchair ramp,
shallow steps with railings and other spe
cial teatures. According to Moore, the
facility is ten years old and has always been
used by people in a "special population.''
The center has basically two programs:
teaching and therapy. Volunteers, includ
ing some 50 University students, teach
children and chronological adults neces
sary swimming skills. One-to-one teach
ing is available and is otten needed,,based
on the problems ot the pupil.
Most of the University volunteers and
staff, said Moore, are former SWOPSI stu
dents who have taken a class on the -
"Meaning ol Being Handicapped" taught
by Moore and Betty Wright, Director ol
the Swimming Program at the C.A.R.
Center.
Another program is a therapeutic and/or
rehabilitative swimming session. The
clients swim on their own, though
lifeguards are on duty. Doctors send pa
tients to the pool frequently on prescrip
tion usually for traumatic injuries, post
amputation, neurologic disabilities and
other illnesses either short term or long
term.
There are quite a lot of people desiring
and needing to use a facility such as the
swim center. We currently have 500
clients. These clients include people with
developmental disabilities, varying de
grees of retardation, autism, emotional
disturbances and physical handicaps
among other problems," said Moore.
