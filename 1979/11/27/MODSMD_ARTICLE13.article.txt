# Group urges salmon protection

Los Angeles (AP) â€” Claiming
Stanislaus River salmon are
being sacrificed to whitewater
rafters, the California Wildlife
Federation (CWF) urged last
week that the governor fire his
top environmental adviser.
The 150,000-member
sportsmen's organization, an
nouncing its support for the
quick completion of the New
Melones Dam and reservoir,
told a news conference that
state Resources Secretary
Huey Johnson has ignored sci
entific studies to "line up with
whitewater ratting groups
seeking to prevent filling of the
New Melones Reservoir."
CWF Board Chairman Loren
lutz admitted, however, that
his group never sought an exp
lanation from Johnson, the
state Department of Fish and
Came or Gov. Jerry Brown for
the state's position on the dam.
Contacted in Sacramento,
Johnson denied he wants to
prevent filling the reservoir,

and he painted a sharply diffe
rent picture of the interests
and controversies behind the
dam.
He said the drive to fill the
reservoir was hacked by about
400 landowners who would
amass $1.5 million in subsidies
over the next several years by
"payingabout $10peracre foot
of water that's costing the tax
payers $70 per acre loot."
Lutz, chairman of the state
Parks and Recreation Commis
sion during the Reagan ad
ministration, countered that
Johnson should be fired for "a
cold-blooded decision to sac
rifice the salmon resource for
the benefit of whitewater re
creation and for jeopardizing
the professional reputation of
the Department of Fish and
Game (DFG)."
Replied Johnson: "I've al
ways thought we should just
rename that reservoir New
Lemones. It's been a lemon
from the start."

Johnson said a federal audit
completed earlier this month
"agreed that there has been
mismanagement" by the Water
and Power Resources Service
for undercharging the land
owners for the water.
"That mismanagement has
cost the federal government
more than $8 billion so far,"
Johnson said, "and this is now
a tragic example of the kind of
mismanagement that we just
can't afford post-Proposition
13."
Johnson concluded that the
landowners are "using the fish
dishonestly to get the dam fil
led for their own purposes"
and have recruited support
from organizations such as the
CWF to recoup their potential
losses.
Lutz claimed the decision
two weeks ago to fill the reser
voir with 300,000 acre-feet will
bring the water level down to
about half of what the salmon

would need to survive. An
acre-foot, about 325,000 gal
lons, is the amount it takes to
cover an acre with a foot of wa
ter.
Lutz accused johnson of
"browbeating" DFG Director
Charles Fullerton to go along
with the reduced flow.
Reached in Johnson's office,
Fullerton also denied the alle
gations and explained that the
iOO,OOO-acre-toot-level is a
two-year experiment to deter
mine the best environment for
the dwindling salmon re
source.
"We don't knowyet what the
right amount of water will be at
the right temperature and the
right time," Fullerton said.
"That's what we're trying to
find out."
It takes three years tor an en
tire salmon cycle to be lost, he
added, "so it this level doesn't
work out, we still have time to
save them."
