# Students work on Lively Arts
## 
### Diane Greening 
If you have ever attended a Lively Arts concert
here, you may have wondered who the students
are who turn pages for pianists, sell Lively Arts
T-shirts at intermission, or who assist at the
after-concert receptions.
They are all members of the Lively Arts at
Stanford Student Committee, and their work at
concerts is only part of what they do.
The Lively Arts student committee, not to be
confused with STARTS, (Student Arts at Stan
ford) works with the full-time staff of the Lively
Arts. Together they bring a wide range of pro
fessional performers here every year.
The student committee was started last year to
provide a link between the Lively Arts, the stu
dents and the performers. Members are
selec ted in the spring, after completing applica
tions and being interviewed by Lively Arts staff
and current committee members. Applicants
are chosen for their interest and enthusiasm for
the performing arts. The committee consists of
tifteen members taken from all classes, from
undeclared freshmen to Ph.D. candidates in
French.
Every other Monday at noon, the committee
meets to set up artist hosting assignments and
discuss ways of reaching students, through both
dorm activities and campus-wide publicity.
Artist hosting means, for example, that there
is a student member backstage at every concert
to give the artist student contact, to bring him
refreshments, to turn pages for an accompanist
and just be available forwhatever may come up.
Some artists need transportation to or from
the airport; student committee members will
drive them. A committee member will usually
accompany artists to dorms for mini-concerts or
demonstrations, which are part of the Lively Arts
program to bring the artist closer to the public.
This year, the committee plans to place more
emphasis on its role as a link to the student
body. This quarter, Donner was offered com
plimentary tickets to the Tarr and Kent trumpet
and organ concert, and more dorm talks are

planned tor Winter Quarter.
Tables will be set up at the Christmas and
Spring Fairs with information about the Lively
Arts and the student committee, as well as to
give away flowers and balloons. Starting next
quarter, committee members will interview ar
tists on KZSU about their upcoming events.
Ron Garwood, a graduate student on the com
mittee, says that he feels that the committee is an
excellent idea, and a good step toward bringing
the arts closer to the students.
He said he sees the committee's role as show
ing students that art need not be stuffy, but
something for all.
"The Lively Arts' emphasis is on quality, and
not necessarily classical performances,"
Garwood. He said he values the rare opportun
ity to be involved and to open the Lively Arts
staff'to new ideas.
"The artists really appreciate just having
someone to be there and help out," he added.
1 here are tangible gains for the students, such
as performance passes and complimentary tic
kets, but members emphasize the experience
gained.
Wendy York, chairperson of the committee,
said, "It provides a unique opportunity to rrjget
artists personally, and to see them before, dar
ing and after a performance."
Garwood said that he realized that although
the artist may be the best in his field, he is a real
person, "just like you and me, only talenfetJl"
Although it is a thrill to meet a long-admrivd
artist, occasionally an artist hosting assignment
will turn into something really special. Last
York and Garwood went out to dinner after the
concert with a Swiss woodwind group. Afteiia
long meal, with much wine and
both French arid English), they closed the .Re
staurant and reluctantly concluded the evening.
The Lively Arts student committee, although a
lot of work, is also a lot of fun for those involved,
and members hope that more students will Be
aware of both the committee and the Lively Ahs
at Stanford.
