## Viewing the other side 
### 
Like most Americans, I find little that is attractive
in the worldview ot the Ayatollah Khomeini,
with its glorilication of martyrdom and death.
He is using the Iranian people's antagonism
against the shah to blind them to the deficien
cies oi Ins governance.
Nevertheless, I am distressed by the reaction
oi so many apparently intelligent Americans to
recent events in Iran. The Vietnam War seems to
have taught many Americans nothing about the
dangers oi kneejerk emotionalism, and about
the inevitable consequences ot their exploiting
other nations' economies lor their own gain.
The voice ol the Constitution, calling for
equality, |ustic e and rationality has drowned in a
llood tide ol hysteria, violence and fear for
America's international prestige.
One Iranian student has been killed, many
have been physically and verbally attacked.
C ertainly it was uncivil lor Iranian students to
I t ikt' the embassy and hold the stall hostage. But
it is hypoc ritic >il ol Amerir ans now to speak of "a
violation ol international law."
The American government continually viol
ales "international law," installs and shores up
puppet regimes, and funds military counter re
volutions.
Where were the reporters and the TV cameras
when the U.S. government overthrew the Al
lende government in Chile?
Perhaps, in international relations, morality
must take second place: it that is what is be
lieved, then those who value morality should
light to break down national barriers.
()ur government knew the risk it was running
when il admitted the Shah to a hospital here.
According to (tie New York limes, President

Carter foresaw the seizure of the embassy. But
the voices of Kissinger and Rockefeller, plus
whatever of his ill-gotten gains the shah offered
those who wield political power in this country,
plus the president's desire to please these
people in a pre-ection year led him to set aside
the feelings of the Iranian government and
people and the known risk to the embassy staff.
He calculated, and he lost.
Hopefully the president now realizes this, and
has arranged tor the shah to leave this country as
soon as possible.
It is difficult to see how the victimization of
Iranian students will help secure the release of
the hostages. The selective application of laws
to only citizens of one nationality is unconstitu
tional, and should be challenged in the courts. It
panders to racism.
I appreciate thatthe president has his political
problems: and perhaps he can justify to his con
science this treatment of Iranians on the ground
that it will take steam out of the public reaction
to them. But it works both ways.
When people see their government acting in a
racist fashion, that legitimates racism for them.
It's never far below the surface.
For the sake of all our human dignity, and the
values we say we hold dear, we should de
nounce the small minded victimization which is
being done in our name, and should speak out
loudly for the civil rights of the thousands of
innocent Iranians who live, study and work
peaceably in our midst.
We may not agree with what they say, but we
must defend their right to say it.
