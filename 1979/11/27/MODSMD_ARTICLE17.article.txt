## When a new president comes... 
### 
As the United States moves
low.ird the next presidential
ele< lion, proclamations about
a lac k ot leadership increase in
frequency irom the hopeful.
I his continuous cry makes it
quite ditticull not to think
about a similar situation here at
Stanlord.
As I read rumors and specu
lations about the current pres
ident ot Stanlord going
elsewhere, I cannot help but
think about the qualities I
would like to see in his succes
sor.
I hope the next president will
ask all ot the vice presidents to
resign, and accept the resigna
tions oi at least three ot them.
I hope it will be someone
who will assume a torcetul role
in the University's atlirmative
action program, internal and
external, .is it applies to racial
minorities.

I hope it will be someone
who will look to the Personnel
Oltice as the University's agent
in developing the best possible
stall, with the best possible en
vironment in which to work,
rather than as the executioner
ol the unliked, I hope it will be
someone who will direct a
complete investigation of per
sonnel policies, to include the
lack of staff development, sal
ary discrimination, decentrali
zation and grievance proce
dures.
I hope it will be someone
who will appoint more racial
minorities on the stall to the
University's committees,
commissions and administra
tive panels.
I hope he or she will provide
positive leadership, stressing
more ot what the University is
doing or will do, rather than
what it won't or can't; some
one who will not hide behind a

facade of how powerless the
president's office is, rather
than utilizing the influence of
that office.
I hope the next president will
direct the University counsel's
staff to cease and desist its
pro-Bakke mentality and un
obstructionism when asses
sing affirmative action prog
rams pertaining to racial
minorities.
I hope he or she is someone
who is not volative, someone
who can listen to constructive
criticism about the president,
the president's office, or the
University, without thinking
about retaliation.
I hope he or she will be crea
tive, not fear precedence, and

not think about what Harvard
has or has not done; someone
who is not obsessed with gov
ernment regulations.
I hope the next president will
look imaginatively at the fu
ture, rather than thinking how
the University can be returned
to the false tranquility of the
early '60s.
I hope the next president will
have a spouse as charming as
the present.
Lastly, I hope the Universi
ty's trustees will be as dis
criminating, brilliant and brave
in choosing its next president
as were the trustees of the Ford
Foundation in selecting its cur
rent one.
