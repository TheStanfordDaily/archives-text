Union helps all
Why is it that people who
oppose unionization otten tell
of their past economic strug-
The\ tell how hard it was
and that still they managed on
their own. Unions are tormed
to make those economic
struggles much lighter.
The Bureau ot Labor Statis
tics says that non-union
women workers earn in per
cent less than unionized wo
men. The gap continues to
widen.
The SLAC Women's Associa
tion made a study ot SLAC
salaries irom 1976 to 1979. Un
ionized United Stantord
Employees salaries rose 21.3
percent, hut salaries ot non
union oil ice workers rose only
5.3 percent while the cost ot
living rose 19 percent.
During these three years
there were no strikes against
Stantord by USE members. The
only strike USF members have
ever called against stantord
was more than tive-and-onp

halt years ago and was won in
only three weeks.
USE just negotiated major
benefit improvements: dental
insurance, improved pensions
and increased sick leave. True,
Stantord will now give these
benetits to all staff. Fourteen
hundred unionized Stantord
workers have won benetits for
a stall ot over 8000.
It we were all unionized
none of us would ever need to
eat trugal suppers such as
peanut butter sandwiches.
Clearly, it is workers who be
netit most from unionization,
not "union bosses." The "un
ion bosses" in USE are the un
paid constitutional officers and
active members.
Those who choose to rise
above adversity rather than
wallow in it will organize and
unionize.
