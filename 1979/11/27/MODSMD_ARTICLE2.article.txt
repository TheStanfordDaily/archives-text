"We are clowns!" said Olga
Serova with pride. But what is a
i lown in a country which has no
knowledge of Steve Martin, a coun
try where 80/o does not exists
In the Soviet Union, to be a clown
means to have earned the distinction
of being one of the country's
toremost actors. It is in this sense
that Serova and her husband
Yevgeny Kozhevnikov, who perform
tonight in 41 lordan Hall, are clowns.
Tonight's show will be the last
performance in the Bay Area of their
play, The Refuseniks>.
Recent immigrants from the Soviet
Union, Olga and Yevgeny lived for
three years as refuseniks, Jews
whose applications to leave the
Soviet Union had been refused.
Now they are living in Berkeley
with their seven-year-old son, An
ton. They are preparing tor an up
coming tour through Boston, Lon
don and New York, where their play
opens ott-Broadway in lanuary.
Hardships
"The life ot a refusenik is very dif
ficult,' said Kozhevnikov. "They
have no work, no security . . . they
are cut off from society."

Nevertheless, according to
Kozhevnikov, the refuseniks remain
hopeful.
"Most of our friends in Moscow
don't know why their visas were re
fused. They don't have any idea how
long they will have to wait. They are
watched all the time; they can be ar
rested any time. But they have cour
age. They mix laughter with the tears.
This is their tradition)" Serova
explained.
Serova and Kozhevnikov blend
this tradition into their play.
Black humor
"We show a very serious subject,"
said Kozhevnikov. "But we show it in
a humorous way. The effect is
stronger because the seriousness is
between the lines."
Reviewers from the London Daily
Telegraph to the Wall Street Journal
have agreed on the power of the
play s message. The Washington Post
applauded the play's "poignant
black comedy" after its first perfor
mance in the United States last
spring.
Serova and Kozhevnikov said they
hope their play will concern Ameri
can lews about the situation of the
refuseniks.

They are well aware of the effect
American pressure can have on the
refuseniks' plight. Last year, Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) relayed a
request Â»o Moscow for the release of
18 refuseniks, including Serova and
Kozhevnikov. Soon afterwards, the
couple was allowed to emigrate.
They said they pray that their
friends, such as Benjamin
Bogomolny, who has been a re
fusenik for 13 years, will be allowed
to leave.
Moscow success
Serova said that she and Yevgeny
received attention as refuseniks as a
result of the underground theater
they held in their tiny Moscow
apartment. By the time the two were
allowed to emigrate, many foreign
journalists and tourists had already
seen and publicized the Russian per
formance of The Refuseniks.
"But our performance was more
for the refusenik community than for
foreigners," Kozhevnikov alleged.
"Our play was an inspiration for
the refuseniks," Serova agreed. "Im
agine someone portraving different
aspects of your life on the stage. You
will realize that even the uncomfort
able parts of your life have mean
ing."


Russian Ac tors Olga Serova and Yevgeny Kozhevnikov dis
cuss their play lhe Refuseniks, which deals with the prob-

lems of Russian Jews who have been refused visas. The play
will have its final performance tonight in 41 lordan Hall.
