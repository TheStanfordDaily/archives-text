# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Matt Leipzig I intruded into someone's fear 
### 
I got lost the last time I went
to San Francisco.
Friends had given me a ride
up but getting back was my
own responsibility. Samtrans
runs from the Transbay Termi
nal, I knew, but I didn't know
where that was and taking
either wrong directions or a
wrong turn I found myself, the
sky darkening, roaming a
neighborhood I heard later is
called the Mission District.
Streets were empty, with the
only light and noise issuing
from a few brightly lit bars. Oc
casionally the lights of a pas
sing car would show me the
neighborhood but for the most
part I strained to see street
signs.
The more I walked the worse
the neighborhood grew, but it
declined in a uniquely San
Francisco way. The architec
ture of the apartments and
storefronts was similar, in the
dark and at a distance, to that

of finer downtown structures.
Only up close did the area
show its decay, only in subtle
ways: flaked paint, broken
shutters and windows, shabby
interiors.
I walked and talked myself
into a bad mood over being
lost. So when I rounded the
corner of a small unmarked
street I was consumed with my
own thoughts.
There was a scream. I stop
ped.
There was another scream,
louder and higher than the
first, and more terrible. I
couldn't find the source. A
third scream, and I looked
around desperately.
On the bench across the
street, near the corner, a
woman sat, her back to me.
The scream had been hers.
Filtering around the corner
was a dim light, probably from
a stopped car's headlamps.
The woman shrieked again
with the type of sound that
seems to scrape the throat raw.
I started to cross the street,
becoming aware of low voices.
I stopped about three feet from
the curb, and looked at the
woman, and she shook vio
lently.
A car swerved to avoid hit
ting me and I remember turn
ing to see the driver's face
curse me.
My first instinct, hearing the
scream, had been that some
kids were fooling around; my
second instinct was that there
was a fight. Obviously I had
underestimated.

I edged towards her, afraid
of whatever must have hap
pened, and of talking to her. I
could not picture myself saying
the words to comfort anyone
who had screamed as this
woman had screamed.
I could not imagine myself
communicating with anybody.
I thought automatically of the
many people I'd asked for di
rections earlier in the day.
A man my age knelt at the
corner with a very young boy,
their illuminated faces staring
at me. They were both thin and
their worn clothes hung
loosely from their frames.
I cleared my throat and
began to move toward the
women but the youth, child in
arms, intervened. "It's okay,"
he said in a barely audible
voice.
Around the corner I saw an
ambulance stopped, facing
me, at the main door of an
apartment building.
Paramedics were carrying a co
vered stretcher to the back
doors of the vehicle.
A small crowd regarded
them. A few people spoke
quietly, without excitement. It
was not as if something violent
had happened, but as if some
one had finished dying gradu
ally.
From the tired looks in the
faces I could see that these
people were familiar with such
events, and as a few of them
returned my gaze I felt
ashamed.
I tried to move on but could

not, the echo of that extreme
scream freezing me.
There did not seem to be any
emotion or thought in the
scream. There was pain, and
the scream had to be
screamed, as if to dissipate the
pain into the air.
Someone close to her had
died and she had screamed.
She had stopped screaming, I
thought, because no more of
the pain would go away. Or
maybe she had just stopped.
My worries of a moment ago
had quite disappeared. I have
never been in a situation the
likes of this woman's and I felt
an echo — but the slightest
echo — of her pain.
I knew that though my petty
concerns were dwarfed for an
instant, I'd probably resume
too soon my habit of getting
upset over the smallest of
problems.
I might be a bit wiser for it,
but not wise enough to do any
thing else, if faced with such
conditions myself, besides
scream as the woman had
screamed.
I turned to leave and looked
back at the people on the
bench. They looked up at meat
that moment, and we stared at
each other with clear eyes.
Their faces were stiff.
I felt embarrassed, like a
stranger, like an intruder on
someone else's thoughts.
And I felt scared.

I started to cross the street,
becoming aware of low voices.
I stopped about three feet from
the curb, and looked at the
woman, and she shook vio
lently.
A car swerved to avoid hit
ting me and I remember turn
ing to see the driver's face
curse me.
My first instinct, hearing the
scream, had been that some
kids were fooling around; my
second instinct was that there
was a fight. Obviously I had
underestimated.

I edged towards her, afraid
of whatever must have hap
pened, and of talking to her. I
could not picture myself saying
the words to comfort anyone
who had screamed as this
woman had screamed.
I could not imagine myself
communicating with anybody.
I thought automatically of the
many people I'd asked for di
rections earlier in the day.
A man my age knelt at the
corner with a very young boy,
their illuminated faces staring
at me. They were both thin and
their worn clothes hung
loosely from their frames.
I cleared my throat and
began to move toward the
women but the youth, child in
arms, intervened. "It's okay,"
he said in a barely audible
voice.
Around the corner I saw an
ambulance stopped, facing
me, at the main door of an
apartment building.
Paramedics were carrying a co
vered stretcher to the back
doors of the vehicle.
A small crowd regarded
them. A few people spoke
quietly, without excitement. It
was not as if something violent
had happened, but as if some
one had finished dying gradu
ally.
From the tired looks in the
faces I could see that these
people were familiar with such
events, and as a few of them
returned my gaze I felt
ashamed.
I tried to move on but could

not, the echo of that extreme
scream freezing me.
There did not seem to be any
emotion or thought in the
scream. There was pain, and
the scream had to be
screamed, as if to dissipate the
pain into the air.
Someone close to her had
died and she had screamed.
She had stopped screaming, I
thought, because no more of
the pain would go away. Or
maybe she had just stopped.
My worries of a moment ago
had quite disappeared. I have
never been in a situation the
likes of this woman's and I felt
an echo — but the slightest
echo — of her pain.
I knew that though my petty
concerns were dwarfed for an
instant, I'd probably resume
too soon my habit of getting
upset over the smallest of
problems.
I might be a bit wiser for it,
but not wise enough to do any
thing else, if faced with such
conditions myself, besides
scream as the woman had
screamed.
I turned to leave and looked
back at the people on the
bench. They looked up at meat
that moment, and we stared at
each other with clear eyes.
Their faces were stiff.
I felt embarrassed, like a
stranger, like an intruder on
someone else's thoughts.
And I felt scared.

I got lost the last time I went
to San Francisco.
Friends had given me a ride
up but getting back was my
own responsibility. Samtrans
runs from the Transbay Termi
nal, I knew, but I didn't know
where that was and taking
either wrong directions or a
wrong turn I found myself, the
sky darkening, roaming a
neighborhood I heard later is
called the Mission District.
Streets were empty, with the
only light and noise issuing
from a few brightly lit bars. Oc
casionally the lights of a pas
sing car would show me the
neighborhood but for the most
part I strained to see street
signs.
The more I walked the worse
the neighborhood grew, but it
declined in a uniquely San
Francisco way. The architec
ture of the apartments and
storefronts was similar, in the
dark and at a distance, to that

of finer downtown structures.
Only up close did the area
show its decay, only in subtle
ways: flaked paint, broken
shutters and windows, shabby
interiors.
I walked and talked myself
into a bad mood over being
lost. So when I rounded the
corner of a small unmarked
street I was consumed with my
own thoughts.
There was a scream. I stop
ped.
There was another scream,
louder and higher than the
first, and more terrible. I
couldn't find the source. A
third scream, and I looked
around desperately.
On the bench across the
street, near the corner, a
woman sat, her back to me.
The scream had been hers.
Filtering around the corner
was a dim light, probably from
a stopped car's headlamps.
The woman shrieked again
with the type of sound that
seems to scrape the throat raw.
