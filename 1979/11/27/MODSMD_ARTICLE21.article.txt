## Gov't 'interference' vital 
### 
Scott Olmsted, in his article "U.S. victimized
by 'reverse results' " makes some good points,
but overlooks some other possible conclusions.
I like his point that coercion is often ineffec
tive in bringing about desired social goals. The
example of Prohibition is probably easier to see
than some of his examples.
I would not say most of his examples show
"reverse results," however, but rather "diffe
rent results" thanihose intended. For example,
the result that some extra people besides poor
people had higher incomes because of the War
on Poverty doesn't seem to me a reverse result.
Nor does the failure of compulsory public edu
cation to achieve 100 percent literacy.
One has to know what the literacy rate would
have been without compulsory education. It
might well be less than five out of six. And I don't
believe making drugs illegal actually increases
their use, unless perhaps people's anxiety at
getting caught would make them use more.
Nevertheless, I am willing to admit that coer
cion is not generally the most effective or pleas
ant way to achieve results. On the other hand, it
is sometimes the best, if not the most pleasant,
way.
It is simpler to stop a robbery through the use
of force than by most other means, like the use
of guilt or offering an honest job. Two-year-olds
sometimes respond only to coercion. But much
of the time, coercion is counterproductive, as
Olmsted suggests.
What does not follow from this is that we must
do away with centralized government. Liberta
rians, or Olmsted, regard centralized authority
as inherently coercive, and if that were true, I
suppose I would be closer to agreeing with
them. But think of all the noncoercive ways the
federal government gets things done.
For example, by paying salaries to people, it
encourages them to work on agricultural, medi
cal and other scientific research, perhaps even
Olmsted's, and, I must confess, mine. They are
not coerced into doing this research.
By printing currency and maintaining a single
monetary system, it greatly fosters the operation
of our economy, out of which the "spontaneous

order" of the libertarians emerges. I don't think
most people feel coerced by the necessity of
using money to obtain goods, and certainly not
anyone who can afford to be at Stanford.
What the libertarians could be doing instead
is suggesting noncoercive ways of accomplish
ing desired social goals. For example, mandat
ory public schooling is coerciveif'schools are so
lousy that kids do not want to go. However, it
becomes noncoercive if school is fun and in
teresting to them. (Unless it grates on one's
individualism to be required to do something
that just happens to be enjoyable.)
In the area of economic "regulation, there is
undoubtedly a lot that could be done with
graduated taxation or incentives rather than
strict requirements. For example, we could tax
companies according to the amount of pollution
they produce, rather than shutting down their
factories.
Perhaps some or most of my disagreement
with the libertarians is that we differ on the so
cial goals themselves. I suspect I believe in less
personal freedom (e.g. to own guns) than the
libertarians do, and in more social control, and
also that these are matters open to question.
Or it could be that they would prefer more
local influence in setting social goals. I find it
hard to disagree with such a position.
Atthe same time, I question whetherall of our
social goals are the type that can be left to local
discretion.
For example, racial integration, energy con
servation, environmental protection and
humanitarian goals seem to me sufficiently
widespread and uniform concerns that they
should be attacked on the national level.
On the other hand, things like housing, labor
laws, public transit, criminal laws or drug laws
could be considered more local concerns.
In short, I agree with Olmsted's position that
coercion, particularly violent coercion, is unde
sirable, but disagree with his conclusions that,
therefore, governmental "interference" must
be dispensed with.

be dispensed with.

Scott Olmsted, in his article "U.S. victimized
by 'reverse results' " makes some good points,
but overlooks some other possible conclusions.
I like his point that coercion is often ineffec
tive in bringing about desired social goals. The
example of Prohibition is probably easier to see
than some of his examples.
I would not say most of his examples show
"reverse results," however, but rather "diffe
rent results" thanihose intended. For example,
the result that some extra people besides poor
people had higher incomes because of the War
on Poverty doesn't seem to me a reverse result.
Nor does the failure of compulsory public edu
cation to achieve 100 percent literacy.
One has to know what the literacy rate would
have been without compulsory education. It
might well be less than five out of six. And I don't
believe making drugs illegal actually increases
their use, unless perhaps people's anxiety at
getting caught would make them use more.
Nevertheless, I am willing to admit that coer
cion is not generally the most effective or pleas
ant way to achieve results. On the other hand, it
is sometimes the best, if not the most pleasant,
way.
It is simpler to stop a robbery through the use
of force than by most other means, like the use
of guilt or offering an honest job. Two-year-olds
sometimes respond only to coercion. But much
of the time, coercion is counterproductive, as
Olmsted suggests.
What does not follow from this is that we must
do away with centralized government. Liberta
rians, or Olmsted, regard centralized authority
as inherently coercive, and if that were true, I
suppose I would be closer to agreeing with
them. But think of all the noncoercive ways the
federal government gets things done.
For example, by paying salaries to people, it
encourages them to work on agricultural, medi
cal and other scientific research, perhaps even
Olmsted's, and, I must confess, mine. They are
not coerced into doing this research.
By printing currency and maintaining a single
monetary system, it greatly fosters the operation
of our economy, out of which the "spontaneous

order" of the libertarians emerges. I don't think
most people feel coerced by the necessity of
using money to obtain goods, and certainly not
anyone who can afford to be at Stanford.
What the libertarians could be doing instead
is suggesting noncoercive ways of accomplish
ing desired social goals. For example, mandat
ory public schooling is coerciveif'schools are so
lousy that kids do not want to go. However, it
becomes noncoercive if school is fun and in
teresting to them. (Unless it grates on one's
individualism to be required to do something
that just happens to be enjoyable.)
In the area of economic "regulation, there is
undoubtedly a lot that could be done with
graduated taxation or incentives rather than
strict requirements. For example, we could tax
companies according to the amount of pollution
they produce, rather than shutting down their
factories.
Perhaps some or most of my disagreement
with the libertarians is that we differ on the so
cial goals themselves. I suspect I believe in less
personal freedom (e.g. to own guns) than the
libertarians do, and in more social control, and
also that these are matters open to question.
Or it could be that they would prefer more
local influence in setting social goals. I find it
hard to disagree with such a position.
Atthe same time, I question whetherall of our
social goals are the type that can be left to local
discretion.
For example, racial integration, energy con
servation, environmental protection and
humanitarian goals seem to me sufficiently
widespread and uniform concerns that they
should be attacked on the national level.
On the other hand, things like housing, labor
laws, public transit, criminal laws or drug laws
could be considered more local concerns.
In short, I agree with Olmsted's position that
coercion, particularly violent coercion, is unde
sirable, but disagree with his conclusions that,
therefore, governmental "interference" must
be dispensed with.
