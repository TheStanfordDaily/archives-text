## Motorized cycles a problem 
### 
(The following is an open letter
to the Stanford community.)
The Committee on Parking
and Transportation wants to
bring to your attention a prob
lem which is becoming increas
ingly serious and threatens the
safety of each of you: the pro
liferation not only of motorcy
cles and mopeds, but espe
cially of people who use them
inconsiderately and in viola
tion of the law.
The number of motorized
cycles now being ridden, in

some cases with virtual and re
ckless abandon, through areas
of the campus closed to veh
icular traffic combines with
hazards already created by traf
fic of bicycles to be a substan
tial threat to life.
For those who may tend to
smirk at that thought, we re
mind you that one student was
killed when two bicycles col
lided a couple of years ago, and
there is no question that
motorized vehicles are even
more dangerous than bicycles.
It's likely that many students,
faculty and staff are unaware of
some state laws which apply
on campus as well as
elsewhere:
1) It is illegal to operate
mopeds with their motors on
in areas closed to vehicular
traffic; they may be pedalled
like bicycles, however.
2) It is illegal to operate
motorcycles in areas closed to

vehicular traffic, period.
3) It is illegal to park motor
cycles or mopeds either within
100 feet of any building or in
spaces marked or allocated for
bicycles.
Enforcement of these laws
and regulations consumes
much time and money. We ask
each member of the commun
ity who operates a motorized
cycle to avoid using it on paths,
malls, and other areas desig
nated for pedestrians and bicy
cles.
If each of you were to do
that, the hazard would disap
pear, visual and aural pollution
would be lessened, and we
would have one example that
people can be considerate of
others and not endanger lives.
