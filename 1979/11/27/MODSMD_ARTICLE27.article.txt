# An exercise in stages, staging
## 
### 
The curtain falls. Applause
follows, wild or polite or
apathetic. Now you've done
your penance, you've sat
through the play, endured
cramps and fatigue and heat
prostration and finally your
moment comes, your
apotheosis, the reason you're a
humanities major. You TALK
about it! Trade insights, de
cipher puns, ask "What did
you thinki" as you sip coffee
and massage your legs.
It doesn't have to be that
way. To prove it, a group of
graduate students from the

dance and drama departments
will present An Evening in De
cember this weekend in the Lit
tle Theater, giving the Stanford
audience a taste ot an alterna
tive approach to theater.
Working
The show largely will be an
exercise in what is known as
"performance art." Rather
than working from a script to
ward a formal result, the focus
will be on the process of work
ing itself. The audience will
constantly be reminded that ii
is seeing a theatrical perfor
mance, staged for its pleasure

by a company of plavers,
not a work of literature being
brought to life to facilitate its
interpretation.
The program will feature
three or four dances choreog
raphed by graduate dance stu
dents, and four short plays di
rected by graduate drama stu
dents. The dances will be done
to music ranging from pop/
rock to heavy synthesizers; the
drama will range from Harold
Pinter to Ring Lardner.
To heighten the sense of
theatricality, the down-time
between acts will be filled with
small reminders — a change in
lighting or an actor crossing
the stage. These fillers also will
help to maintain the facade of
"company," as actors and dan
cers from previous scenes
reappear in different guises.
The realization of perfor
mance art often calls for the
synthesis of different stage
forms; for the creators of An
Evening in December, a large

part ot the show's appeal is the
opportunity to work with one
another. "The interpenetra
tion is what is exciting," says
)ohn Rathman, one of the four
directors. "The creators enter
into one another's imagina
tions."
Cooperation
According to Rathman, there
is little cooperation in the stag
ing of shows among the drama,
dance, music and art depart
ments here. An Evening,
staged entirely by students
(under the supervision of Juan
Valenzuela, who teaches in
both the drama and dance de
partments), will be subject to
fewer formal restrictions than
would be imposed by a de
partment.
An Evening in December will
run Friday and Saturday at 8
p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
There will be no admission
charge.
