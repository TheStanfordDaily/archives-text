## Opera workshop a high note 
### 
To see an opera, you once
had to defer a year's tuition to
afford a ticket, pour yourself
into your most uncomfortable
clothes, and take an afternoon
away from studying to drive to
the City.
Not anymore. This February,
the Stanford Opera Theatre
will present Puccini's Gianni
Schichi and Giancarlo Menot
ti's The Medium in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Supported by the Music De
partment, this group of stu
dents, professors and profes
sionals was formed to com
plement the vocal program.
Nothing of its kind has existed
here since the Opera Work
shop of the late '40s.
Andor Toth, founder and di
rector of the Opera Theatre,
explains that building an "op
era area" on campus is impor
tant pedagogically, for stu
dents' background.
"The kind of thing we're
going to do, San Francisco
Opera and community operas
wouldn't be likely to do, for fi
nancial reasons," he said. "The
Opera Theatre plans to include
premieres of new operas, folk
operas and contemporary
works in their repertoire.
Rubs off
"Also, a contact with a pro

fessional at work rußs off in a
way that it can't in a class," said
Toth, who was a professional
violinist and conductor before
becoming a professor of
music and the director of the
Stanford orchestras last year.
The associate director of the
San Francisco Opera, Daniel
Helfgott, will direct the
Puccini-Menotti production,
which will run Feb. 6, 7, 9 and
10. Helfgott, who assisted de
signer Jean-Pierre Ponnelle,
also will collaborate with set
designer Tom Richardson.
Helfgott also is qualified to
train students to act as singers,
according to Toth.
Although professionals are
involved both as singers and
staff members, the program is
student-oriented, Toth said.
"If there's a student who can
handle a role, a student will
sing the role."
In February's production,
students will sing 10 of the 19
roles. The cast, headed by fa

culty members William Ramsey
and Greg Wait, includes stu
dents Suzanne Loube, Mark
Floyd, Eric Hoit, Katherine
Prothro, Charles Fidlar,
Katherine Saltzman, Derek
Evan, Tom Moore, Curtis Laer,
Nancy Wait and staff member
Marianne Bahmann.
In training
To receive credit for the un
dertaking, singers must enroll
in the 1-4 unit Opera Work
shop course, which will meet
twice a week in addition to the
rehearsals. During these class
sessions, vocalists will be
coached by Toth and his
graduate assistants, Jeannine
Wagar and Peter Jaffe.
In addition, approximately
130 student musicians will play
for the production. The work
shop operas will include both
the University chamber and
symphony orchestras.
Toth also hopes to include
students in technical aspects of
the production, such as stage

management, makeup and
wardrobe.
The Medium, Toth said, in
volves some challenging
seance scenes and special ef
fects. Gianni Schichi, a
farce, leaves room for many
personal touches."
Freedom
Despite Dinkelspiel's lack of
storage and building space,
"I'm willing to put up with set
and lighting problems in order
to have the freedom of work
ing as much as the students
need," he explained.
"Mainly I'm concerned with
keeping the standards awfully,
awfully high," said Toth, who
began forming the company
last November.
"It's a long task," he said.
"Effort has to be spent in for
mulating your ideas and in
making people understand
you."

sionals was formed to com
plement the vocal program.
Nothing of its kind has existed
here since the Opera Work
shop of the late '40s.
Andor Toth, founder and di
rector of the Opera Theatre,
explains that building an "op
era area" on campus is impor
tant pedagogically, for stu
dents' background.
"The kind of thing we're
going to do, San Francisco
Opera and community operas
wouldn't be likely to do, for fi
nancial reasons," he said. "The
Opera Theatre plans to include
premieres of new operas, folk
operas and contemporary
works in their repertoire.
Rubs off
"Also, a contact with a pro

fessional at work rußs off in a
way that it can't in a class," said
Toth, who was a professional
violinist and conductor before
becoming a professor of
music and the director of the
Stanford orchestras last year.
The associate director of the
San Francisco Opera, Daniel
Helfgott, will direct the
Puccini-Menotti production,
which will run Feb. 6, 7, 9 and
10. Helfgott, who assisted de
signer Jean-Pierre Ponnelle,
also will collaborate with set
designer Tom Richardson.
Helfgott also is qualified to
train students to act as singers,
according to Toth.
Although professionals are
involved both as singers and
staff members, the program is
student-oriented, Toth said.
"If there's a student who can
handle a role, a student will
sing the role."
In February's production,
students will sing 10 of the 19
roles. The cast, headed by fa

culty members William Ramsey
and Greg Wait, includes stu
dents Suzanne Loube, Mark
Floyd, Eric Hoit, Katherine
Prothro, Charles Fidlar,
Katherine Saltzman, Derek
Evan, Tom Moore, Curtis Laer,
Nancy Wait and staff member
Marianne Bahmann.
In training
To receive credit for the un
dertaking, singers must enroll
in the 1-4 unit Opera Work
shop course, which will meet
twice a week in addition to the
rehearsals. During these class
sessions, vocalists will be
coached by Toth and his
graduate assistants, Jeannine
Wagar and Peter Jaffe.
In addition, approximately
130 student musicians will play
for the production. The work
shop operas will include both
the University chamber and
symphony orchestras.
Toth also hopes to include
students in technical aspects of
the production, such as stage

management, makeup and
wardrobe.
The Medium, Toth said, in
volves some challenging
seance scenes and special ef
fects. Gianni Schichi, a
farce, leaves room for many
personal touches."
Freedom
Despite Dinkelspiel's lack of
storage and building space,
"I'm willing to put up with set
and lighting problems in order
to have the freedom of work
ing as much as the students
need," he explained.
"Mainly I'm concerned with
keeping the standards awfully,
awfully high," said Toth, who
began forming the company
last November.
"It's a long task," he said.
"Effort has to be spent in for
mulating your ideas and in
making people understand
you."
Those of us waiting to pay
our tuition, understand.
