# Tin gods, matinee idols:' Life in the Theater'
## 
### 
"All the world's a stage,"
Shakespeare tells us, and as
this world turns, so does the
generational cycle — and also
fortune — which inevitably
mandates the demise of the
old, while heralding the
emerging eminence and even
tual predominance of the
young. Thus the thesis that
David Mamet rather fetchingly
and poignantly illustrates, but
never develops to any satisfy
ing degree, in A Life in the
Theatre, which opens the
California Actors Theatre's
1979-1980 season.
This play follows the
interconnected lives of two ac
tors: Robert, an older and es
tablished "star," and John, a
tyro whose energy and vibr
ance displeases and then helps
to displace Robert.
The text of the play seems to
suggest a more equal battle be
tween the cagey older actor
and the up-and-coming
neophyte than CAT presents.
Robert, as played by Dakin
Mathews, totally controls the
action of the play, from his

glorious reign over life in this
theater to his inevitable
downfall. Mathews gives to his
role a fullness, vindictive
humor (especially his mugging
in the "lawyer" scene) and
poignancy entirely appropriate
to the character. We see in his
performance a man undergo
ing torment from his infir
mities, but more importantly,
from within himself.
John, as played by Nathan
Haas, exudes energy and ea
gerness, but too often, virtu
ally at every critical moment,
he merely reacts to and takes
advantage of Robert's gradual
and accelerating realization
that his time in the theater is
running out. Here, Robert's in
securities about his place in the
theater cause a series of con
frontations: arguments over
imagined slights and discour
tesies, instigated by an out
raged and increasingly
frightened Robert. Haas seems
to be most convincing in the
more tender scenes: as
Robert's student, when he's
taken the stage away from
Robert and implores the older

actor to stop crying. But we do
not detect in Haas' rather pas
sive interpretation of his role
the single-minded focus and
commitment to toppling and
succeeding Robert that
Mamet's play indicates.
Mamet rides his narrative
vehicle overbearingly; over
and over again, he has Robert
teach John and tells us that life
in the theater is a part of — is
indeed — life.
As the curtain rises, we see
that Robert fully controls life in
this theater. He graciously and
gregariously compliments
John for the younger actor's
performance and John,
neophyte and student ot
Robert, fawns over those
words of encouragement.
Robert accepts with relish the
responsibility of the older gen
eration to teach the younger
one about life. He tells John
that "we must not be afraid of
process" and "we must not be
afraid to grow." But one of the
undeniable processes of
growth is the painful realiza
tion that one eventually grows
too old to retain control of the
life of this theater.
As John learns from Robert
the ways in which to get along
in the theater, he inevitably
begins to chart the course of
his own life in it. Predictably,
the younger actor's assertive

ness brings about the conflict
in the play; John begins walk
ing on Robert's scenes and
Robert suggests that John "do
less" so that the status quo of
the hierarchy of this theater
remains intact.
With this conflict and com
petition comes loss of com
munication, and the results are
humorously depicted in the
"onstage" scenes: lines are
blown, cues missed, one actor
steps in front of, almost liter
ally on, the other. But Robert
cannot win the battle. As John
becomes the better actor,
Robert becomes embarras
singly inept. Soon it's obvious
that Robert will never get
another leading role.
A Life in the Theatre, then, is
about how to get along in life as
the time one has in life passes.
Mamet tells us that people
need people and that com
munication and cooperation is
the means by which this
"closed society" (the theater)
can function, the only way that
the scenes "onstage" will
work. In the end, Robert ac
cepts his new role. John has
driven Robert from the theater.
The younger actor not only has
centerstage as he rehearses in
the empty theater, he has the
entire stage; we never see
Robert when he capitulates.
Had the play ended here, it

would have approached
tragedy. Mamet refuses to look
at life (ostensibly, in the thea
ter) from a tragic perspective.
In the final scene we see
Robert fishing for a kind word
from John. We see the hierar
chy reestablished; someone
again is firmly in control of life
in this theater, conflict has
been resolved, Robert and
John reconcile, no one has
been permanently injured,
everyone accepts the ways of
this world. But Robert has pre
cious little time left; he
"spent" (does not "spend") his
life in the theater. He sees that
"it all goes so fast. It all goes so
quickly." Nevertheless, Robert
retains a bit of the "old
trouper" in him; as his career
dims with the backstage lights,
he does a quick jog and sings to
us and to himself: "an actor's
life for me."
A Life in the Theatre offers an
entertaining and somewhat
thought-provoking evening.
CAT has, in general, brought
the play to its fullest potential
and thus deserves commenda
tion. As an important and sub
stantial theatrical-literary
statement, however, A Life in
the Theatre does little more
than present a view of the ways
of the world, of which we are
all too aware.
