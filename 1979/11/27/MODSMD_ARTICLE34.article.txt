# Julian's 'Macbeth' and Shakespeare onstage
## Sound, fury signifying nothing? 
### 
The production of Macbeth,
which runs through Dec. 22 at
the Julian Theatre, brings to
mind a question one hears oc
casionally from a few brave
souls who probably should
know better: should Shakes
peare be performed anymore?
The question is guaranteed
to provoke apoplexy in the
educated listener. What, he
sputters, remove all that
beauty from the stage? The fact
remains, however, that fewer
and fewer people can ap
preciate that beauty on its own
merits. For Shakespeare to
succeed theatrically, the plays
must be placed exactly in their
period, and all of the gimmicks
he wrote in must be fully
exploited.
Otherwise, the language be
comes an insurmountable bar
rier for the audience. Produc

tions which place the works
out of context, and take them
selves seriously usually are
disasters. Shakespeare exists
in a no-man's land of literature
— too new to translate, too old
to fully understand.
This means that only the
large, established companies
and the festivals can afford to
do Shakespeare well. The Ju
lian Theatre is not large by any
definition. The stage itself is in
the Potrero Hill Neighborhood
House atop Potrero Hill,
tucked in with the soup
kitchen and the ping-pong ta
bles.
Director Richard Reineccius
has his own plan for making
Shakespeare intelligible
onstage. Done at the )ulian, his
Macbeth couldn't help but be
intimate, and Donald Cate's
bare, descending-disc set

leaves you with nothing but the
actors and the words. The
bubbling cauldron is reduced
to smoke and a red spot
through a trapdoor.
Ana, while it's all done very
professionally — the perfor
mances are uniformly excel
lent, especially Leo Downey's
as Macbeth (Brenda Reineccius
is a bit too matronly as Lady
Macbeth), and She fight
scenes are outstanding I
found myself bored as hell and
wishing they'd speed up the
petty pace. While I have great
respect for what the people at
the )ulian accomplished with
poor facilities and little money,
I would still much rather read
the play than see their produc
tion. I just wish they had put
the same energy and talent into
something written in the last
200 years.
