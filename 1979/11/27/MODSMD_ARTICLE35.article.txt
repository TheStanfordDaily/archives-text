Kissinger denies role aiding shah
Washington — Former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger yesterday denied allegations that he
pressured the Carter administration into allowing
the deposed shah of Iran to enter the country for
cancer treatment.
In fact, Kissinger told reporters, he had not dis
cussed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's status with ad
ministration officials since July. The shah was
granted a visa last month.
"I think the administration took the correct de
cision," Kissinger said after a call on Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance. "It was a courageous decision.
I support the decision, but it was not at my urg
ing."
Charges that Kissinger and New York banker
David Rockefeller cleared the way for the shah
have been aired since Iranian revolutionaries
seizi d the U.S. Embassy in Tehran Nov. 4.
On Sunday, lormer U.S. diplomat George Ball,
long a rival of Kissinger, said he doubted the Car
teradministration would have let the shah into the
country without pressure from Kissinger and
others.
U.S. has not met with Khomeini
Washington — More than three weeks since the
seizure of American hostages, the U.S. govern
ment still has had no direct access to the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary
leader.
Neither the State Department nor the White
House has been in contact with the revolutionary
leader. And since the fall of the civilian Bazargan
government soon after the Tehran embassy
takeover, access to the Iranian foreign ministry
also has been very limited.
W. Bruce Laingen, who headed the U.S. mis
sion, was at the American embassy when re
vulutionary students took control on Nov. 4.
Laingen met regularly with Ibrahim Ya/di, the
foreign minister, in the first few days. But when
Yazdi quit office with the fall ot the Bazargan gov
ernment, Laingen was left in touch only with low
level officials,
Presidential emissaries Ramses Dark and Wil
liam Miller were turned back on their way to Iran
three days after the embassy tell. Lhere have been
po official U.S. representatives sent to Iran sine e.
Rep. George Hansen, (R-ldaho) flew to Tehran
on his own and visited the hostages on Sunday.
But he is there on a personal basis, and not as a
government representative.
Shah to be operated on soon
New York — A prominent radiologist is traveling
(rom Canada to remove a gallstone trom the de
posed Shah of Iran in the next few days, medical
sources said last night.
Dr. Joachim Burhenne was to arrive here last
night after a flight from Vancouver, 8.C., where he
heads the department of radiology at Vancouver
General Hospital.
Burhenne was a pioneer of the special non
surgical technique which will be used to try to
remove the gallstone from Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, who is being treated at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.

Iranian students to be deported
San Francisco — One by one, 26 Iranian stu
dents, dressed in blue jeans and parkas or three
piece suits, stood silently before a U.S. Immigra
tion judge yesterday to receive data tor deporta
tion hearings next week.
Attorneys tor the students denied charges that
the Iranians were "deportable," saying they in
tended to argue that the actions of the Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service (INS) were uncon
stitutional.
The INS, acting on orders from President Jimmy
Carter, is reviewing the status of all Iranians in the
country on student visas with the intention of de
porting those who have violated immigration reg
ulations.
"They probably are in technical violation, but in
the past, the INS condoned it and winked at it and
they still do for students not from Iran," said attor
ney Eric Haffer.
Haffer said 700 Iranian students in the Bay Area
whose visas had expired had been notified by INS
they had until |une 1980 to voluntarily leave the
country. But since the presidential order, they
have received new notices ordering them to leave
the country in iO days.
Court to hear abortion debates
Washington — The Supreme Court said yester
day it may decide whether Congress can refuse to
pay tor most abortions wanted by women on wel
fare.
Once again taking up one of the nation's most
divisive legal and social topics, the court agreed to
hear arguments over the constitutionality of the
abortion-spending restriction.
But the justices left themselves an escape route.
First they will have to decide they have the proper
jurisdiction before ruling on the constitutional
question.
Arguments will probably be heard this winter
and a decision announced sometime before the
end of the court term in )une.
In other business, the Supreme Court yesterday
turned down an attempt by the Western Shoshone
Indians to reclaim 12 million acres ot public land in
Nevada.
The justices, without comment, refused to
postpone a settlement in which the government
will pay the Western Shoshone $26.1 million for
more than 24 million acres in Nevada and Califor
nia — including the 12 million acres the Indians say
they never relinquished.
Israelis debate Shakaa expulsion
lerusalem — Israeli spokesmen, signaling a shift
in attitude, said yesterday the government would
reconsider the expulsion of Nablus Mayor Bassam
Shakaa in exchange for a statement by him against
terrorism and his voluntary resignation from of
fice.
Shakaa was arrested Nov. 11 pending deporta
tion following a discussion he held with a top
army officer in which he allegedly condoned Arab
terrorism. Shakaa said he was misquoted and that
he opposes violence, although he blames Israel's
li-year occupation for the on-going strife.
Two previous attempts failed to persuade the

government to drop the deportation proceedings.
Begin also received appeals for Shakaa's release
from the U.S. State Department and the United
Nations General Assembly.
Jarvis submits new tax petition
Los Angeles — A new assault on California taxa
tion by crusader Howard Jarvis reached a miles
tone yesterday as petitions for his income tax in
itiative were submitted statewide and predicted it
would easily qualify for the state ballot.
"This cut-the-income-tax initiative completes
the iob we began with Proposition 13," )arvis said
in an interview after submitting 300,000 signatures
to Los Angeles County registrar himself. Smaller
packets of petitions were submitted in the state's
57 other counties.
The measure to cut state personal income taxes
in half, slicing state tax collections about $5 billion
in its first year, could come before voters in the
June 1980 primary as a constitutional amendment.
He predicted this initiative, like his property
tax-slashing Proposition 13, would bring cries of
protest that state government has no more fat left
tocut. Critics of the proposal have already dubbed
it "Jaws II" because of its drastic approach to tax
cutting.
No sooner had he spoken than former
Gov. Pat Brown criticized him as a "demagogue"
and his initiative as "dangerous."
Manson may face parole board
Vacaville — Mass murderer Charles Manson has
a date with his parole board today, but officials
said yesterday he hasn't decided whether he will
appear.
Manson, like other long-term prisoners, has the
right to a yearly review of his case by the parole
board.
Last year, Manson gave the board a nearly four
hour speech about his notorious case and was
denied parole after he said he believed he be
longed in prison.
Manson, 45, stands convicted of eight 1969
murders.
