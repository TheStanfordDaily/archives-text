# Candidates for sale
## 
### Mike Vaska 
Do you like President Jimmy Car
ter's chances in the 1980 election? Is
he worth a 28 cent investment?
Maybe, maybe not. So how about
Gerald Ford or Jerry Brown for just
four cents? Do we hear 32 cents for
Ted Kennedy?
Well, if you think you know who
the winner will be, get to the
economics department.
Some economics whizzes there
have developed a new contingent
commodity market. Ten different
securities can be bought in 10 share
lots. Each share corresponds to the
name of a presidential hopeful.
Ronald Reagan, John Connally,
Howard Baker, George Bush, are
also up tor sale as are chances on
anyone else whose chances you like.
Each security has a face value ot $1
redeemable after the presidential
election in November 1980. The
catch is that only the securities ot the
winner in that election will pay off.
All the rest will be as worthless as a
ticket to this year's Big Game.
The market is the brain child of
Economics Prof. John Shoven.
"There is a certain educational
value to this market," Shoven said.
He is "hoping that in a secondary
market short selling (of the sec
urities) and options markets will
open up." These will help to de
monstrate the simple properties of a
market operation, he added.
The market has "knit together the
faculty and students" of the
economics department, Shoven
said.
A similar operation at Yale Univer
sity when Shoven was an under
graduate there gave him the idea for
the Stanford market, he said. Prince
ton University also has a presidential
securities market, he said.
Paul David, chairman of the
economics department, called the
securities a "splendid idea.
"People who study economics and
how markets work are intrigued by
how a market works on a small
scale," he said. There have been
many experiments run on small scale
markets and "seeing how markets
react to various news has direct edu
cational value," he added.
The financial burden of establish
ing the market was shared by Sho
ven, Michael Boskin and David Star
rett, all professors in the depart
ment. They will divide all gains or
losses on the primary market, Sho
ven said.
He said he is not expecting to make
a profit because of the cost of starting
the market. These included printing
the securities, which have the face of
the candidate on them and throw
ing parties for the market.
Some 750 shares have been sold
already, according to Shoven. The

primary market will probably close
when 1000 shares have been sold, he
said.
"I am not particularly concerned
with the illegality ot the market,"
Shoven said. The operation was
"meant to be essentially in the
economics community," he said.
A transaction on the tourth
floor economics lounge in Encina
Hall records all transactions that have
occurred in the secondary UTC (un
der the counter) market. Otters to
buy or sell securities are listed on a
separate sheet kept in the lounge.
The market opened on Tuesday,
Nov. 6 at a party in the lounge thrown
tor the occasion. Originally, inves
tors could buy securities in the prim
ary market either in individual 10
share lots, or they could buy a ba
lanced portfolio ot securities tor
$9.50. This portfolio contains 10
shares ot all possible candidates.
According to Shoven, the only way
to enter the market now is through
the purchase ol a balanced porttolio
or of shares on the secondary mar
ket.
Original security prices lor each
candidate ranged trom lour to 52
cents. Subsequent prices on the sec
ondary market will depend on the
relative strength ot each candidate.

Paul David, chairman of the
economics department, called the
securities a "splendid idea.
"People who study economics and
how markets work are intrigued by
how a market works on a small
scale," he said. There have been
many experiments run on small scale
markets and "seeing how markets
react to various news has direct edu
cational value," he added.
The financial burden of establish
ing the market was shared by Sho
ven, Michael Boskin and David Star
rett, all professors in the depart
ment. They will divide all gains or
losses on the primary market, Sho
ven said.
He said he is not expecting to make
a profit because of the cost of starting
the market. These included printing
the securities, which have the face of
the candidate on them and throw
ing parties for the market.
Some 750 shares have been sold
already, according to Shoven. The

primary market will probably close
when 1000 shares have been sold, he
said.
"I am not particularly concerned
with the illegality ot the market,"
Shoven said. The operation was
"meant to be essentially in the
economics community," he said.
A transaction on the tourth
floor economics lounge in Encina
Hall records all transactions that have
occurred in the secondary UTC (un
der the counter) market. Otters to
buy or sell securities are listed on a
separate sheet kept in the lounge.
The market opened on Tuesday,
Nov. 6 at a party in the lounge thrown
tor the occasion. Originally, inves
tors could buy securities in the prim
ary market either in individual 10
share lots, or they could buy a ba
lanced portfolio ot securities tor
$9.50. This portfolio contains 10
shares ot all possible candidates.
According to Shoven, the only way
to enter the market now is through
the purchase ol a balanced porttolio
or of shares on the secondary mar
ket.
Original security prices lor each
candidate ranged trom lour to 52
cents. Subsequent prices on the sec
ondary market will depend on the
relative strength ot each candidate.
