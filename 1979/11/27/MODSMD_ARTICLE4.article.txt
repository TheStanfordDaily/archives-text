One or more burglars broke into
the Stanford Bookstore during the
weekend and walked out with more
than $5000 worth of televisions,
jewelry, watches, radios and tape re
corders, according to Stanford Police
Services Detective Don Lillie.
Lillie said the break-in was re
ported yesterday morning after the
Bookstore's manager arrived to open
the store.
The burglar, or burglars, had sorrfe
prior knowledge of the layout of the
Bookstore, Lillie said. No alarm was
sounded during or after the forced
entry to the building.
Lillie said the break-in occured be-

tween Saturday night when the store
closed and early yesterday morning.
He said the burglary was "some
what professional.
"They could have hauled $50,000
out of there in the time they hauled
off the $5000," Lillie said. "They got
in and out of there in a hurry."
He said many valuable items in the
storage rooms were untouched.
The case is currently under inves
tigation by the Santa Clara County
Sheriff Department's main office in
San Jose, under an agreement bet
ween the department and Stanford
which gives the county jurisdiction
over all major crimes.
