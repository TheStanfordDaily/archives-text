# Khomeini calls youth to arms
## 
### Associated Press 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini raged
against the United States yesterday
and told his followers all Iranians
must learn to handle weapons, drop
their divisive arguments and unite
with all their might against America
or "we will disappear for good. "
As attempts to solve the U.S.-
Iranian crisis got underway at the
United Nations in New York, Kho
meini broadcast a speech from his
headquarters at the holy city of Qom
to revolutionary guards, asking that
they mobilize against the "Satanic"
power of America.
And 100 miles away, in Tehran, the
49 American hostages that are his
price for return of the deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi spent their
23rd day as captives in Tehran's U.S.
Embassy.
"An Islamic country ought to be a
military one. . . Everyone must learn
shooting and military skills ... In
addition to the religious equipment
and faith that the youth of our nation
possess, they must also be equipped
with materials and arms ... A coun
try that will have 20 million youths in
a few years time, should have 20 mill
ion armed men," the Moslem pat
riarch said on Tehran radio, moni
tored in London.
Shortly afterward, the radio
broadcast a statement from the
guards' central headquarters saying
it had formulated a nationwide prog
ram of military training for all which
would be explained in further an
nouncements.
In New York, Security Council
members agreed to meet on the
U.S.-Iran crisis and the council pres
ident said the session probably
would begin no later than today de
spite an Iranian plea for a week's de
lay.
Council President Sergio Palacios
de Vizzio of Bolovia told reporters he
expected a meeting last night or
todav in response to Secretary-
General Kurt Waldheim's urgent re
quest that the 15-member council
convene on the issue.
Waldheim took the unusual step of
calling the meeting Sunday, saying
the conflict over Iranian militants
holding 49 American hostages in the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran threatened
world peace.
Iranian special envoy Saeed San
jabi told a news conference the next
few days are "of high political and
religious significance" in Iran and
"we have requested postponement

to the next week of this meeting."
"At that time our foreign minister
will be coming here to New York to
participate in the meeting of the
council and to explain the demands
of our people," Sanjabi said.
Albohassan Bani Sadr, Iran's acting
foreign minister, had said Sunday he
would fly to New York yesterday. But
the country's revolutionary govern
ment announced hours later he had
postponed his trip for a week be
cause of Ashura, the most important
holiday for the Shiite Moslem sect,
and the Dec. 2 referendum on Iran's
new Islamic constitution.
Although Palacios de Vizzio met
before Sanjabi held his news confer
ence, he said he was aware Iran "re
quested a postponement" but the
council would go ahead with its plans
to hold a formal meeting.
Sanjabi, reading from a prepared
statement, noted Iran had asked on
Nov. 13 that the Security Council
meet and was "glad" that request
had come to Waldheim's attention.
The United States had blocked Iran's
plea for a meeting, but then an
nounced Sunday it would support
Waldheim's request, on grounds the
session would focus on a call for an
immediate release of the hostages.
Sanjabi said "threats made by the
U.S. and its propaganda campaign
have created a dangerous atmos
phere for the region and entire

world."
Diplomats following the private
U.N. consultations said earlier that
the United States and Iran were
working at cross purposes.
The informants, preferring not to
be identified, said U.S. Ambassador
Donald McHenry sought to have the
council meet soon and call for the
hostages' release.
They said Iranian Charge D'Af
faires )amal Shemirani asked that the
meeting be put off until after Satur
day.
When Waldheim made his request
Sunday, he told reporters he consi
dered the current confrontation the
worst threat to international peace
since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis
involving the United States and the
Soviet Union.
In Washington, the State Depart
ment announced yesterday that de
pendents and "non-essential per
sonnel" at 10 embassies in the Is
lamic world will be given a chance to
come home.
Department officials said the "vol
untary drawdown" was caused by
the recent unrest in the area and the
threat it posed to American person
nel.
They said the program was not an
evacuation and that all American
embassies would remain open and
functioning.
