# Advisory board for Tresidder approved
## 
### Bill Jue 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons has approved the formation of
a Tresidder Union Board to help
shape the student union's future role
in the campus community.
Early next year, the board will start
to study the policies governing the
operations, activities, services and
programs of Tresidder and to serve
Lyons and Director of Tresidder Dan
Williams in an advisory capacity.
A University task force, formed in
April to investigate the ways in which
the community can have a greater
influence on Tresidder functions, re
commended the board's establish
ment.
The board will consist of nine vot
ing members — five students, two
faculty members and two University
staffers.
Five ex-officio, non-voting mem
bers — Lyons, Williams, a member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP), a representative of Vice Pres
ident for Business and Finance Wil
liam Massey and the Student Prog
ram Board chairperson —will also be
associated with the Tresidder com
mittee.
Two of the more specific tasks that
await the assistance of the Union
board will be a review of the new
Food Service contract and the selec
tion of a successor for Williams, who
will become the director of housing
at the University of Oregon in April.
The task force that proposed the
board's establishment researched
the governing of other college un

ions and reviewed the old Tresidder
Union Committee that was dis
banded in 1972 before deciding that
some form of the defunct union
board should be resurrected.
The key difference between the
new and old Union boards, accord
ing to Williams, is the administrative
hierarchy. Originally, the director of
Tresidder served under the Union
board, not the University administra
tion. Thus, no direct administrative
contact existed between the au
tonomous board and the University.
Such a lack of an administrative
base resulted in the inability of the
old Union board to overcome the fi
nancial difficulties that plagued Tres
sider during the late 1960s and early
70s, Williams said.
So, the old Union committee was
dissolved in 1972, and Tresidder was
placed under the administration of
Lyons, who named Williams direc
tor. .
The director will continue to work
under Lyons, while the new board
will maintain direct contact with both
Lyons and Williams.
"In the last couple of years, we we
ren't in a position to make any
choices about Tresidder," said Wil
liams, but the improved financial
balance will enable Tresidder to
take steps to improve itself in other
areas.
The question facing Tresidder now
is what these improvements should
be.
