# Candidates fail as oddsmakers

Washington (AP) â€” Given the
lessons ot campaigns past,
presidential candidates and
their managers should have
learned by now that forecast
ing the outcome of a political
contest can magnify a defeat
and take the edge off a victory.
They haven't.
For some reason, inside
every campaigner is a would
be oddsmaker. The wise ores
try to convince the world that
their candidates will be de
lighted to limp home second or
third in this or that presidential
primary election.
But enthusiasm often over
comes wisdom. It's happening
in the 1980 campaign.
Some will magnify defeats,
as Sen. Howard Baker did by
counting too heavily on victory
in an otherwise meaningless
straw poll in Maine. He lost, to
former CIA Director George
Bush.

Some will help take the edge
off smaller-than-expected vic
tories, and make them look
like defeats. That happened
dramatically two campaigns
ago, when Sen. Edmund Mus
kie's manager in New Hamp
shire said anything less than 50
percent of the vote in that
opening primary would be
grounds for suicide. Muskie
won with 44 percent. His cam
paign went downhill from that
point.
Last campaign, Ronald
Reagan had problems with
forecasts that exceeded per
formance. His people in New
Hampshire began by forecast
ing a landslide. When Reagan
lost by a handful of votes to
then-President Gerald Ford,
his claim of satisfaction at hav
ing come that close to an in
cumbent was undermined by
the early claim that he was
going to win.
