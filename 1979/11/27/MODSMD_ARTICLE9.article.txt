The Communication De
partment will present Thursday
a videotape entitled "Working
Against Rape"; the showing
will take place at the CERAS in
structional room.
Despite the universality of
the problem of rape the film is
very specific in its concentra
tion with rape victims here at
Stanford. Alice Supton, assis
tant dean of residential educa
tion explains: "It is a societal
problem, a product of sexism
in our society; rapes occur be
cause of society's attitude to-

wards women."
The film will attempt to dis
prove certain myths and dissi
pate the guilt most women feel
about the issue of rape. "It is a
myth, for example, that rape
happens only to attractive
young women: victims range
from infants to elderly wo
men," says Supton.
The film was produced by
three University students, Lori
Foster, Sally Edwards and Alli
son Brown. After the showing,
the tape will be available for
sale or rental.
