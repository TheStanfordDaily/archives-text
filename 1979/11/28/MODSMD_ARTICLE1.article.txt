# Sororities refused recognition-for now
## 
### Randy David 
All seven sororities here have been
denied University recognition but
the University has not closed the
door on the subject, Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson said
yesterday.
In detailed letters to each of the
sorority presidents, Robinson out
lined some of the areas in which he
saw a conflict between University
policy and the policy of the sororities
and their national organizations.
Robinson said he wants to work
with the sororities here in reapplying
for recognition "if something
changes in the relationship of the
sororities with the nationals."
Many sorority presidents said they
were not surprised by the Universi
ty's action.
"We knew we had conflicts," Pi
Beta Phi President lane Irwin said. "It
seems to me Robinson's letter could
easily have been written last spring."
In his letter, Robinson said denial
of recognition "means that you can
not claim to be a University organiza
tion nor can you use any University
owned or controlled facilities for
meetings or other functions."
However, some sorority represen
tatives said they did not feel that de
nial of recognition was a setback.
"I'm disappointed, but it's defi
nitely not a defeat," said Pam Hutch
craft, Kappa Alpha Theta president.
"We're just in the same position
we've been in for the last two years.
"It doesn't mean the end of
sororities. We'll just have to keep
suffering the inconveniences and
dangers of meeting off campus," she
said.
Delta Gamma President Terri
Dobbels agreed with Hutchcraft. She
said the sororities will continue
operating the same way they have
since the ban was lifted.
The decision to deny recognition
was based on the general issue of
local autonomy, Robinson said. The
sorority constitutions contained
"clauses and provisions that infringe
on the ability of the local group to
govern their own affairs," he said.
The sororities were evaluated indi
vidually and none conformed to Uni
versity guidelines.
University policy for selective
groups states that "the selection
process may not in any way involve
persons from outside the University
for the purpose of influencing either
the decisions made by selective
groups or the decisions of students
as to whether or not to join the
group."
The guidelines also require that
management functions be handled

by students and that "advisers may
advise only and not control man
agement themselves."
This policy was established in De
cember 1977, at the same time the
Board of Trustees removed the 33-
year-old ban on sororities.
"The guidelines were developed
as a result of looking at how the
fraternities are organized," Robin
son said. He said he also talked to
people at other universities.
"The national fraternities and
sororities interact quite differently,"
he said. "Fraternities are given much
more freedom." Robinson said that
all fraternities here follow University
guidelines, although he has not
examined their constitutions.
Hutchcratt said she thinks some
fraternities here do not fit these
guidelines. She said she suspects
there are other student groups here
besides sororities which are tied to
national organizations outside the
University.
"I feel we're being discriminated
against because we're forced to fol
low policies other groups don't have
to follow," she said.
Irwin said, "It's hard to see us not
recognized while fraternities are."
Robinson said a fraternity is cur
