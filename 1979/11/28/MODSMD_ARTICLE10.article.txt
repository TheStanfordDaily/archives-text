# Californians note progress for China's women

Peking (AP) — A Chinese
proverb states that women
hold up half the sky, and an
American visitor said that while
Chinese women indeed hold

their own, they still have a long
way to go 30 years after the
communist victory.
That was the impression of
Mayor fane Baker of San

Mateo, Calif., and 19 other
Calitornia women who Sunday
finished a two-week tour that
took them to Shanghai, Wusih,
Nanjing, Xian and Peking.
"I think women in China
have come a fantastically long
way in 30 years — much farther
than we have in the United
States — because they had so
far to come," said the mayor
who also is a member of the
California Elected Women's
Association for Education and
Research.
"But Chinese women still
have quite a way to go," she
added.
Before the communist re
volution, rural China was a
feudal society, and in many
areas the bound foot sym
bolized the restricted role of
women.
Now, Mrs. Baker said,
women do the same work as
men, even holding jobs that
women in the United States
have filed suit to get.

"But women still are ex
pected to take care of the
house and do the cooking,"
she noted after conducting in
terviews with women in com
munes and factories in the five
cities.
"Older women still feel ob
liged to perform domestic
chores."
Among younger couples,
she said, household chores are
divided more evenly.
The American women were
told by the official in charge of
science and technology: "By
the year 2000, women still will
hold up half the sky." "It is to
tally wrong to look down on
women," and women are a crit
ical part of China's moderniza
tion drive, he said.
The group visited nurseries,
elementary and middle
schools, colleges, hospitals,
communes and factories and
met with local provincial offi
cials.
