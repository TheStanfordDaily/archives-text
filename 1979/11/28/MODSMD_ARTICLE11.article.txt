# College ranking: does it matter?

There is considerable rivalry among uni
versities, in part bred by sports rivalries, in
part by the "old school ties," and by other
factors. It all helps to confound the pros
pective student trying to choose one
school over another.
Objectivity is often not an element in
arguments over academic superiority.
However, should one seek an empirical
basis for one's claims, surveys which rank
universities may provide a partial answer.
It is widely known that Stanford, for in
stance, is ranked first among American
universities in business, education and
psychology, and is very strong in engineer
ing and medicine. This knowledge stems
in part from a survey conducted in 1977 by
Everett Ladd and Seymour Martin Lipset,
from which the Peninsula Times Tribune
concluded: "The Stanford undergraduate
school now ranks second only to Harvard
in its ability to draw students."
Malcolm Scully, in the "Chronicle of
Higher Education," said that the Stanford
faculty received the highest marks in Ladd
and Lipset's survey, which included more
than 4000 faculty members at four-year in
stitutions. He also said that at least 10 per
cent of the respondents ranked Stanford
in the top five in 17 out of 19 academic
fields.
"If anything, Stanford's overall ranking
nationally has remained stable over the
last ten years," said Luis Lujan, assistant
director of admissions. "We still attract
more competitive students than the na
tional average.
"The rankings can give the general
population an idea where the best deal can
be had for the money," he said. "In the
caseot private institutions, this can add up
to a considerable sum."
Lujan warned of certain limitations:
"The rankings may not reflect all the qual
ities a student might want in choosing a
university. They seldom reveal things like
how diversified the student body is, or
appealing peculiarities of departments."
William Clebsch, professor of religious

studies and humanities, took an even
dimmer view: "I don't consider national
rankings of schools as anything like re
vealed truth. The graduate rankings are
strictly reputational.
"There is a tremendous time lag —
academicians when polled remember how
their old alma mater used to be," he con
tinued. "Also, there is a halo effect — one
department's reputation will affect
another's."
Bob Beyers of the University News and
Publications Service said that he takes a
rather relaxed view of the value of rank
ings.
"They are based on anything from the
social register to how many alumni end up
in 'Who's Who,' " he said.

Beginning students may
mention Stanford's reputa
tion as a reason for coming
here, but seldom mention its
ranking . . . which is based
on anything from the social
register to how many alumni
end up in "Who's Who."

Beginning students may mention Stan
ford's reputation as a reason for coming
here, but seldom mention its ranking, ac
cording to Byers.
"Rankings tend to be very specific," he
said. "At the undergraduate level, many of
the rankings are phoney. Undergraduate
surveys must deal with thousands of prog
rams rather than with hundreds of
graduate programs."
Stanford Psychology Department
Chairman Cordon Bower had mixed feel
ings about rankings: "The psychology de
partment has rated number one in the na
tion for the last 10-15 years. How can I
complain about that?
"Professors are familiar with research
done in other universities, but seldom
with the undergraduate programs in those

universities," he said. "What you hear
about them, I think, is mostly hype and
advertising."
Rankings ot universities are done in dif
ferent ways, principally varying in which
criteria they use to determine academic
status. In the popular book, Where the
Colleges Rank, which the authors claim is
"no attempt to evaluate the academic ex
cellence ot a university," the following
criteria are used: admission standards,
proportion of recent graduates entering
graduate or professional programs, prop
ortion of faculty with doctorates, student
faculty ratio, faculty salaries and library
collection.
Of these criteria, faculty statistics are the
most commonly used in national rankings.
|ohn Bunzel, senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution, said in the Los Angeles
Times, "The most important feature of a
first-tier university is the quality of the fa
culty — specifically, how its members are
recruited and promoted."
Bower said that an objective measure of
the quality of faculty could be made
through analyzing the impact of faculty re
search.
"In a recent issue of American
Psychologist I saw a survey that measured
this impact by counting how many refer
ences were made in various journals to the
faculty members of a given institution," he
said.
Fred Hargadon, dean of undergraduate
admissions, agreed that the quality of fa
culty is paramount in judging an academic
institution. "Yet, it's hard to get a consen
sus for the criteria that you should use,"
he said. "There are so many factors in
volved, at a certain level it becomes almost
impossible to determine whether one uni
versity is superior to another."
Clebsch stressed the importance of stu
dents in rankings. "A school is only as
good as the students it attracts," he said. "I
recall the words of David Jordan, Stan
ford's first president, that you can't put a
$2000 education in a 50-cent boy or girl."

he said. "There are so many factors in
volved, at a certain level it becomes almost
impossible to determine whether one uni

Clebsch stressed the importance of stu
dents in rankings. "A school is only as
good as the students it attracts," he said. "I
recall the words of David Jordan, Stan
ford's first president, that you can't put a
$2000 education in a 50-cent boy or girl."

There is considerable rivalry among uni
versities, in part bred by sports rivalries, in
part by the "old school ties," and by other
factors. It all helps to confound the pros
pective student trying to choose one
school over another.
Objectivity is often not an element in
arguments over academic superiority.
However, should one seek an empirical
basis for one's claims, surveys which rank
universities may provide a partial answer.
It is widely known that Stanford, for in
stance, is ranked first among American
universities in business, education and
psychology, and is very strong in engineer
ing and medicine. This knowledge stems
in part from a survey conducted in 1977 by
Everett Ladd and Seymour Martin Lipset,
from which the Peninsula Times Tribune
concluded: "The Stanford undergraduate
school now ranks second only to Harvard
in its ability to draw students."
Malcolm Scully, in the "Chronicle of
Higher Education," said that the Stanford
faculty received the highest marks in Ladd
and Lipset's survey, which included more
than 4000 faculty members at four-year in
stitutions. He also said that at least 10 per
cent of the respondents ranked Stanford
in the top five in 17 out of 19 academic
fields.
"If anything, Stanford's overall ranking
nationally has remained stable over the
last ten years," said Luis Lujan, assistant
director of admissions. "We still attract
more competitive students than the na
tional average.
"The rankings can give the general
population an idea where the best deal can
be had for the money," he said. "In the
caseot private institutions, this can add up
to a considerable sum."
Lujan warned of certain limitations:
"The rankings may not reflect all the qual
ities a student might want in choosing a
university. They seldom reveal things like
how diversified the student body is, or
appealing peculiarities of departments."
William Clebsch, professor of religious

studies and humanities, took an even
dimmer view: "I don't consider national
rankings of schools as anything like re
vealed truth. The graduate rankings are
strictly reputational.
"There is a tremendous time lag —
academicians when polled remember how
their old alma mater used to be," he con
tinued. "Also, there is a halo effect — one
department's reputation will affect
another's."
Bob Beyers of the University News and
Publications Service said that he takes a
rather relaxed view of the value of rank
ings.
"They are based on anything from the
social register to how many alumni end up
in 'Who's Who,' " he said.

Beginning students may
mention Stanford's reputa
tion as a reason for coming
here, but seldom mention its
ranking . . . which is based

Beginning students may mention Stan

"Rankings tend to be very specific," he
said. "At the undergraduate level, many of
the rankings are phoney. Undergraduate
surveys must deal with thousands of prog
rams rather than with hundreds of
graduate programs."
Stanford Psychology Department
Chairman Cordon Bower had mixed feel
ings about rankings: "The psychology de
partment has rated number one in the na
tion for the last 10-15 years. How can I
complain about that?
"Professors are familiar with research
done in other universities, but seldom
with the undergraduate programs in those

universities," he said. "What you hear
about them, I think, is mostly hype and
advertising."
Rankings ot universities are done in dif
ferent ways, principally varying in which
criteria they use to determine academic
status. In the popular book, Where the
Colleges Rank, which the authors claim is
"no attempt to evaluate the academic ex
cellence ot a university," the following
criteria are used: admission standards,
proportion of recent graduates entering
graduate or professional programs, prop
ortion of faculty with doctorates, student
faculty ratio, faculty salaries and library
collection.
Of these criteria, faculty statistics are the
most commonly used in national rankings.
|ohn Bunzel, senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution, said in the Los Angeles
Times, "The most important feature of a
first-tier university is the quality of the fa
culty — specifically, how its members are
recruited and promoted."
Bower said that an objective measure of
the quality of faculty could be made
through analyzing the impact of faculty re
search.
"In a recent issue of American
Psychologist I saw a survey that measured
this impact by counting how many refer
ences were made in various journals to the
faculty members of a given institution," he
said.
Fred Hargadon, dean of undergraduate
admissions, agreed that the quality of fa
culty is paramount in judging an academic
institution. "Yet, it's hard to get a consen
sus for the criteria that you should use,"
he said. "There are so many factors in
