# One year after the city hall slayings
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Dianne
Feinstein won't sit in the chair
where George Moscone was
shot. Anne Kornenberg gets
depressed the 27th of every
month. And everyone remem
bers.
They remember the day this
lovely city turned ugly. The day
gunfire rang beneath the
rotunda. The day a mayor and a
supervisor died.
It was a year ago that Dan
White, freckle-faced former
fireman and police officer,
walked into Mayor Moscone's
City Hall office and shot him
because he wouldn't give
White his supervisor's job
back.
It's been a year since White
reloaded his gun, ran down the
hall and shot Supervisor Har
vey Milk because he smirked.
For this city, still reeling then
from the horror of the deaths
of its own in faraway Jones
town, Guyana, the assassina
tions of its mayor and its first
avowed homosexual official
last Nov. 27 were almost more
than could be borne. Now the
pain has eased.
State Assemblyman Willie
Brown, perhaps George Mos
cone's closest friend, says it is
impossible to scar the city. San
Francisco is too resilient, he
says, too full of life to be obses
sed, even with the death ot
loved ones.
Perhaps he's right. As one
sits in the mayor's office, the
place Moscone loved so well,
talking to his successor, music
wafts through the window —
gaiety from the same plaza
where thousands gathered to
mourn Moscone and Milk and
six months later came to rage
against White and the justice
he received.
"Only time eases the blow,"
says Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
whom tate made mayor and
who now campaigns to win the
office in her own right.
"There are constant remin
ders — every time I walk in the
back office, for example. I
don t sit in the chair Mayor
Moscone was in.
"The memories are all
around, as well they should be.
They were men of such
enormous personal humorand
good will," she said.
The politics of George Mos
cone and Harvey Milk have re

ceded from the mind's eye, but
the memory of the men lin
gers.
"The movement has felt
Harvey's loss this year," says
Anne Kronenberg, Milk's ad
ministrative assistant. "And it's
felt George's. They were two
liberal forces lost at once and
no one has really replaced
them.
"But the thing that really gets
me is not being able to share
things with Harvey, to have
him here to talk to. I see flashes
ot Harvey all the time. The 27th
of every month is very difficult
for me."
For Frank Falzon, a homicide
detective who considered Dan
White a friend, the hard part is
second-guessing — by others
and by himself.
It was his seemingly sym
pathetic interrogation of White
that became the turning point
of White's trial, helping per
suade a jury that White was not
a cold-blooded killer, but a
good guy gone wrong.
"I remember everything that
day vividly, every second is
quite clear," Falzon says. "I've
gone over it in my mind many
times, wondering if I could
have done anything diffe
rently.
"There was absolutely no
thing I could change. I didn't
have all the answers when I
spoke to Dan White to do a
complete, 100 percent job. I
wish I had, but that's Monday
morning quarterbacking."
There's been a lot of that
since the May 21 verdict, which
found White guilty of voluntary
manslaughter, and the gay riot
it provoked.
But the man whose cour
troom skill kept White from a
murder conviction has no
doubts.
"I feel to this day that I just
did a job for him like I'd do if

Ftarvey Milk had shot and kil
led the other two fellows. I'd
have done the same thing for
him and been just as satisfied
with the outcome . . says
Doug Schmidt, White's attor
ney.
"There was substance to our
defense and I don't feel re
sponsible for what happened
afterwards."
Schmidt's client was sen
tenced to seven years and eight
months in prison. He is now at
Soledad, living in a six-by
nine-foot cell away from the
prison population and waiting
for freedom — perhaps as early
as 1984 and no later than 1986.
Hiswife, who wept when her
husband's life was spared,
does herwaitingamonga small
circle of friends and family. She
lives with her toddler son, An
drew, in the same Ingleside
house the couple shared be
fore the killings. She teaches
kindergarten part-time and vis
its her husband regularly.
"Mary Ann'sadjusted so well
it's scary," says a friend, who
asked not to be identified.

"The family is treating his
being away like a hitch in the
Army. They seem to deny the
magnitude of the crime — it's
almost like he hit a dog."
There is no waiting for those
who love the men White shot.
Instead they think about what
was, what might have been —
and what is.
"A lot of people want the
world to go back the way it was
before Harvey's death," says
Harry Britt, Milk's successor on
the Board of Supervisors. "The
world never goes back the way
it was. We can't recreate the
world before the assassina
tions but we can create a San
Francisco that reflects the real
ity of now.
"Harvey had a desire for im
mortality, a )ewish immortality,
that the ideas he shared with
his close friends would not die
out," says Britt, recalling Milk's
efforts for homosexual rights
and to organize the national
gay march on Washington on
Oct. 14.
"And that worked. The ideas
that were in Harvey Milk's head
will not die out."

cone's closest friend, says it is
impossible to scar the city. San
Francisco is too resilient, he
says, too full of life to be obses
sed, even with the death ot
loved ones.
Perhaps he's right. As one
sits in the mayor's office, the
place Moscone loved so well,
talking to his successor, music
wafts through the window —
gaiety from the same plaza
where thousands gathered to
mourn Moscone and Milk and
six months later came to rage
against White and the justice
he received.
"Only time eases the blow,"
says Mayor Dianne Feinstein,
whom tate made mayor and
who now campaigns to win the
office in her own right.
"There are constant remin
ders — every time I walk in the
back office, for example. I
don t sit in the chair Mayor
Moscone was in.
"The memories are all
around, as well they should be.
They were men of such
enormous personal humorand
good will," she said.
The politics of George Mos
cone and Harvey Milk have re

ceded from the mind's eye, but
the memory of the men lin
gers.
"The movement has felt
Harvey's loss this year," says
Anne Kronenberg, Milk's ad
ministrative assistant. "And it's
felt George's. They were two
liberal forces lost at once and
no one has really replaced
them.
"But the thing that really gets
me is not being able to share
things with Harvey, to have
him here to talk to. I see flashes
ot Harvey all the time. The 27th
of every month is very difficult
for me."
For Frank Falzon, a homicide
detective who considered Dan
White a friend, the hard part is
second-guessing — by others
and by himself.
It was his seemingly sym
pathetic interrogation of White
that became the turning point
of White's trial, helping per
suade a jury that White was not
a cold-blooded killer, but a
good guy gone wrong.
"I remember everything that
day vividly, every second is
quite clear," Falzon says. "I've
gone over it in my mind many
times, wondering if I could
have done anything diffe
rently.
"There was absolutely no
thing I could change. I didn't
have all the answers when I
spoke to Dan White to do a
complete, 100 percent job. I
wish I had, but that's Monday
morning quarterbacking."
There's been a lot of that
since the May 21 verdict, which
found White guilty of voluntary
manslaughter, and the gay riot
it provoked.
But the man whose cour
troom skill kept White from a
murder conviction has no
doubts.
"I feel to this day that I just
did a job for him like I'd do if

Ftarvey Milk had shot and kil
led the other two fellows. I'd
have done the same thing for
him and been just as satisfied
with the outcome . . says
Doug Schmidt, White's attor
ney.
"There was substance to our
defense and I don't feel re
sponsible for what happened
afterwards."
Schmidt's client was sen
tenced to seven years and eight
months in prison. He is now at
Soledad, living in a six-by
nine-foot cell away from the
prison population and waiting
for freedom — perhaps as early
as 1984 and no later than 1986.
Hiswife, who wept when her
husband's life was spared,
does herwaitingamonga small
circle of friends and family. She
lives with her toddler son, An
drew, in the same Ingleside
house the couple shared be
fore the killings. She teaches
kindergarten part-time and vis
its her husband regularly.
"Mary Ann'sadjusted so well
it's scary," says a friend, who
asked not to be identified.

"The family is treating his
being away like a hitch in the
Army. They seem to deny the
magnitude of the crime — it's
almost like he hit a dog."
There is no waiting for those
who love the men White shot.
Instead they think about what
was, what might have been —
and what is.
"A lot of people want the
world to go back the way it was
before Harvey's death," says
Harry Britt, Milk's successor on
the Board of Supervisors. "The
world never goes back the way
it was. We can't recreate the
world before the assassina
tions but we can create a San
Francisco that reflects the real
ity of now.
"Harvey had a desire for im
mortality, a )ewish immortality,
that the ideas he shared with
his close friends would not die
out," says Britt, recalling Milk's
efforts for homosexual rights
and to organize the national
gay march on Washington on
Oct. 14.
"And that worked. The ideas
that were in Harvey Milk's head
will not die out."
San Francisco (AP) — Dianne
Feinstein won't sit in the chair
where George Moscone was
shot. Anne Kornenberg gets
depressed the 27th of every
month. And everyone remem
bers.
They remember the day this
lovely city turned ugly. The day
gunfire rang beneath the
rotunda. The day a mayor and a
supervisor died.
It was a year ago that Dan
White, freckle-faced former
fireman and police officer,
walked into Mayor Moscone's
City Hall office and shot him
because he wouldn't give
White his supervisor's job
back.
It's been a year since White
reloaded his gun, ran down the
hall and shot Supervisor Har
vey Milk because he smirked.
For this city, still reeling then
from the horror of the deaths
of its own in faraway Jones
town, Guyana, the assassina
tions of its mayor and its first
avowed homosexual official
last Nov. 27 were almost more
than could be borne. Now the
pain has eased.
