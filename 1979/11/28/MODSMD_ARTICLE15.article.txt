Peace Corps and VISTA re
cruiters were on campus last
week helping persons in
terested in working in under
developed areas both here and
abroad to learn more about the
national programs.
The Peace Corps is an or
ganization designed to aid Less
Developed Countries (LDC's)
through appropriate
technological means. VISTA is
concerned with the social
needs of disadvantaged areas
within the United States. Both
the Peace Corps and VISTA
function under the auspices of
ACTION, a Congressionally
funded committee.
According to spokesman
Bob White, the goals of VISTA
and the Peace Corps are fun
damentally the same. Each
group strives to promote peace
through cultural and personal
interchange. The Peace Corps
achieves this goal by sending
technically skilled workers to
aid people on the village level.
VISTA helps communities in
the United States to develop
"Impowerment," or the ability

to get their needs met. Volun
teers are required to live on the
same financial level as other vil
lagers or community mem
bers.
The idea of a Peace Corps
organization was first men
tioned by Vice President
Hubert Humphrey as an alter
native to military aid in Third
World countries. It was not
until the Kennedy Administra
tion, however, that the Peace
Corps was formally founded.
Today, with a working budget
of nearly $100,000,000, the
Peace Corps and VISTA prog
rams support over 6000 volun
teers in 60 countries.
White stated that the Peace
Corps is constantly recruiting
volunteers.
"We're pretty aggressive re
cruiters, given our funding,"
he said.
Desirable traits for potential
volunteers, according to
White, include good health, a
desire to teach and learn in a
different culture, adaptability
to new situations and a willing
ness to work hard.
Peace Corps volunteers
work for two-year terms, re
ceiving a monthly living alio

wance and free personal medi
cal care. Volunteers alsoje
ceive a $3000 readjustment al
lowance on completion of
their term.
Plane fare to the various
countries is also paid for by tlie
Peace Corps.
Vista workers volunteer for
one-year terms with similar pay
conditions. All volunteers un
dergo rigorous training
entails two or three months of
developed language and trade
skills, as well as health orienta
tion, cross-cultural experience
in the field and actual farpj\y
living.
White emphasized that
Peace Corps workers are not
working for the U.S. govern
ment. All volunteers are under
the employ of the local gov
ernment in their assigned
country. Latin America, South
America, Africa, the Phillipines
and some Asian countries are
areas where most volunteers
are now placed.
The only criteria for Peace
Corps or VISTA workers is a
minimum age of eighteen.
There are no upper age limits,
and no degree requirements:
