## Khomeini is the Iranian crisis 
### 
the <risi\ with the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini h.is transcended the issue of the
shah. Thr latter's extradition is no longer
the major point ol controversy. In fact the
conflict has escaped the narrow confines
ol the collision between Iran's revolution
and the United States.
Bizarre .is it may be, the Ayatollah of
(jom is pushing towards a Holy War bet
ween Islam and "blasphemy" (read all
What emerge now are in
feriority complexes, oppression and con
fin is th.it span several hundred years. It is
.) (lightening prospect and it is bound to
benefit neither the Islamic world nor the
Western world.
I lie ayatollah has proven himself an in
Â«,inei .malic, sell-righteous and dogma
tic man. It is .1 sad prospect that the seem
ingly monumental struggle of the Iranian
people against the haled shah has ciegen
eialed into I he twisted theoc racy of Kho
meini.
following Ins, in retrospect, lesser es
c.apades against women, broadcasted
music and free pi ess, Khomeini is embark
ing into a holy war.
' I heie are hints that not only the Iranian
masses ol Shi'ites believe he is the
\l.ihdi" (Messiah) but he himself be
lieves it. I eadership of the Moslem World
is .it stake, mixed willi religious fundamen
talist overtones and .111 open animosity to
w.iids the infidels.
I lie Islamic level that originated with
thehhio i lages in lehran (tragic as it is, the
li\ i oi I 1 ) pei>ple suddenly appear out of
< 1 mil \l> r .ni cadinn throughout the area.

Khomeini is not only responsible for the
attack on the embassy in Islamabad, Pakis
tan, but he further exults the attack. He
blames the "Zionist stooges" and America
for the attack on the mosque in Mecca
although he must know that he is lying.
Many of his pronouncements show
utter ignorance of world conditions. The
man is primitive, motivated only by his
narrow vision of the world. His followers,
fueled by his edicts and their long brewing
hostilities have often turned their wrath on
the wrong culprits.
A case in point is the attack against the
British embassy in Tehran based on the
misconception that former Iranian Prime
Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar was in Eng
land.
Similarly, the leaders of the Pakistani
students that burned the U.S. embassy
there, "apologized" for their action when
they discovered that there was no connec
tion between the United States or Israel on
the seizure of the mosque in Mecca. Yet,
the ayatollah is praising them for the "ris
ing against the West."
Khomeini's message is frighteningly
dangerous. The ground of his seeds of
hate and religious animosity is fertile.
The Moslem world has a number of jus
tified grudges against the West. Con
stantly exploited and ridiculed, it was de
legated to second rate status forcenturies.
The only leaders that the West felt com
fortable with were dictators or absolute
monarchs that were either installed by or
nurtured in the West. The shah, the Saudi
kings and )ordan's King Hussein are few of

the examples of leaders close to the West.
Often living in decadent style, marrying
and "playboying" in the West, they lost
touch with their subjects. They often of
fended the most revered traditions and
institutions of their culture.
Now with the new reality of Khomeini
and the formidable weapon of oil, long
suppressed nationalism and, inadver
tently, religious chauvinism are resurfac
ing.
Yet, the ayatollah is a poor bearer of the
Islamic banner. His blanket anti
westernism will not aid in the develop
ment of the Moslem countries. Their
economic and social problems are critical
and pressing.
Attractive to Moslems as he may be,
Khomeini is a step backwards to the age
just before the crusades. Progressive
forces in the Moslem world must be
grieved now at the bizarre turn of events in
their long struggle for liberation.
The Soviet Union should understand
that it has nothing to gain from Khomeini's
rage against the West. If he were success
ful in inciting the Moslems, the Islamic
population in the Soviet southern frontier
will become hotbeds of trouble. The
Soviets and the West are all in this to
gether.
A tough stand against the ayatollah is
paramount in importance. At stake is not
only the survival of the West but also that
of the Moslem world. He is not the Mes
siah.
