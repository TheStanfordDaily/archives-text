which i a used the unfair labor

In Mav ol I<)7'l members of

by |<>!> i lassilit ation and by sex.
I hf study was < oinparerl with a
sillill.h one done in P)76. It was
tound thai women's salaries
liiitl nol improved relative to
men's salaiies even though in
19, ( ) there were more women
in Ihe higher-paid technical
and professional job
categories.
Part ol the problem was that
about (ill pert enl ol the women
were in oltice and clerical job
classifications and the salaries
lot those |iibs had increased
less than tor cither job classifi
t ations. Mmosl all clerical and
oltice employees were wo
men.
I he median oltice and < leri
tal employees' salary in
i leased only live percent bet
ween September l ( )7b and
\pril I')"'). Meanwhile the me
dian salary lor technicians had
iik teased by it percent and
that lor labor, service and
opeialive employees had in
creased by 21.b percent. The
latter two groups are covered
lis the US! bargaining unit.
\l the lime this report was
presented to Ihe membership
til the s| \( Women's Associa
tion several of us talked with
SI \< management about what
t ould be done to improve the
salaries ol office and clerical
employees at SI AC. We were
told that basically nothing
could be done because these
salaries were lied tt) those at
the I 'diversity.
The membership of the

Women's Association then
discussed what could be done
to remedy the situation and,
among other things, requested
that representatives of various
unions be invited to give in
formational not organizing)
talks.
After checking with SLAC Di
rector of Personnel Doug Du
pen, we invited representa
tives from the Office and Pro
fessional Employees Interna
tional Union and from LJSE to
give presentations.
After the USE presentation
Dupen informed several active
members of the Women's As
sociation (about 18 people in
all, including two men, not all
of whom were even members
of the Women's Association)
that they could no longer be
at tive in the Women's Associa
tion or attend its meetings on
penalty of termination because
they were "supervisors" and
the Women's Association was a
"labor organization."
The Women's Association
never tried to organize
employees or form a union — it
merely tried to give them in
formation as to the options av
ailable. Those people who
were interested in organizing
clerical employees formed a
separate and independent
committee for that purpose.
Fortunately, the situation re
garding the SLAC Women's As
sociation was settled by a letter
from SLAC Director Wolfgang
Panofsky, stating that atten
dance at Women's Association
meetings was permissible if the
individual supervisor was per
suaded that organizing or
union matters would not Oe
discussed.
However, some individuals
who had been called "super
visors" during the Women's
Association episode and after
wards were interested in form
ing a union and felt that they
were not truly supervisors.
Management, probably feeling
that calling people supervisors
when in fact they were not was
an effective way to keep
people from joining the or
ganizing effort and signing
union authorization cards, told
other clerical employees that

Ihey were "supervisors" and
could not be involved in union
organizing.
There have been rumors that
this has been tried at the Uni
versity and at the Medical
Center. The National Labor Re
lations Act, which makes it il
legal tor management to inter
fere with union activities, is
being used as an excuse to do
just that by management's ef
forts to convince clerical
employees that they are part of
management!
One problem seems to be
that in the typical SLAC or Uni
versity or Medical Center of
fice with more than one clerical
employee there is a hierarchy.
One secretary has more ex
perience or seniority than
another, and, in the interest of
efficiency, gives typing or
xeroxing to another secretary
to do.
Sometimes the more experi
enced secretary is asked by her
boss about the work of another
secretary. But the senior sec
retary is still doing clerical or
administrative work. Is she part
of management?
In order to clarify this situa
tion, USE, on behalf of several
SLAC employees, filed an un
fair labor practices charge with
the NLRB. Clearly those in
volved in organizing at SLAC
do care about the law, contrary
to Dupen's statement.
By law, it is the NLRB which
decides, once petition for col
lective bargaining is made,
which categories of workers
may be in a bargaining unit.
Prior to that timeany employee
has the right to sign a (blue)
union authorization card.
The employer is prohibited
by law from even asking an
employee if she has signed
such a card! Only the Labor
Board will ever see these cards,
never the employer. And any
employee may also organize
with others havings/mr/ar jobs.
(Even managers could form
their own labor group, al
though managers are not pro
tected by the NLRB.)
What the NLRB decides
is which categories of workers
can be in the same unit. By
prior restraint of labor organiz

ing, the University could de
cide before the issue even
reaches the Board who may
and who may not be in the bar
gaining unit by preventing
some people from participat
ing in labor activities and by ac
tions which havc j the effect of
intimidating employees from
exercising suth rights as sign
ing the cards which constitute
a petition to the Nl RB.
So, if you have a job in a cler
ical classification — Secretary
111, Administrative Assistant I,
Office Assistant IV — and have
been told that you are a
"supervisor," ask yourself

whether you are truly part of
management or really a work
ing supervisor. Are you being
paid a management-level sal
ary?
And if you wish to help the
clerical employees, remember
that community support is im
portant to office staff efforts to
organize at Stanford as they
have already done at Boston
University, Santa Clara
County, BART, Kaiser and
elsewhere.

t ould be done to improve the
salaries ol office and clerical
employees at SI AC. We were
told that basically nothing
could be done because these
salaries were lied tt) those at
the I 'diversity.
The membership of the

Women's Association then
discussed what could be done
to remedy the situation and,
among other things, requested
that representatives of various
unions be invited to give in
formational not organizing)
talks.
After checking with SLAC Di
rector of Personnel Doug Du
pen, we invited representa
tives from the Office and Pro
fessional Employees Interna
tional Union and from LJSE to
give presentations.
After the USE presentation
Dupen informed several active
members of the Women's As
sociation (about 18 people in
all, including two men, not all
of whom were even members
of the Women's Association)
that they could no longer be
at tive in the Women's Associa
tion or attend its meetings on
penalty of termination because
they were "supervisors" and
the Women's Association was a
"labor organization."
The Women's Association
never tried to organize
employees or form a union — it
merely tried to give them in
formation as to the options av
ailable. Those people who
were interested in organizing
clerical employees formed a
separate and independent
committee for that purpose.
Fortunately, the situation re
garding the SLAC Women's As
sociation was settled by a letter
from SLAC Director Wolfgang
Panofsky, stating that atten
dance at Women's Association
meetings was permissible if the
individual supervisor was per
suaded that organizing or
union matters would not Oe
discussed.
However, some individuals
who had been called "super
visors" during the Women's
Association episode and after
wards were interested in form
ing a union and felt that they
were not truly supervisors.
Management, probably feeling
that calling people supervisors
when in fact they were not was
an effective way to keep
people from joining the or
ganizing effort and signing
union authorization cards, told
other clerical employees that

Ihey were "supervisors" and
could not be involved in union
organizing.
There have been rumors that
this has been tried at the Uni
versity and at the Medical
Center. The National Labor Re
lations Act, which makes it il
legal tor management to inter
fere with union activities, is
being used as an excuse to do
just that by management's ef
forts to convince clerical
employees that they are part of
management!
One problem seems to be
that in the typical SLAC or Uni
versity or Medical Center of
fice with more than one clerical
employee there is a hierarchy.
One secretary has more ex
perience or seniority than
another, and, in the interest of
efficiency, gives typing or
xeroxing to another secretary
to do.
Sometimes the more experi
enced secretary is asked by her
boss about the work of another
secretary. But the senior sec
retary is still doing clerical or
administrative work. Is she part
of management?
In order to clarify this situa
tion, USE, on behalf of several
SLAC employees, filed an un
fair labor practices charge with
the NLRB. Clearly those in
volved in organizing at SLAC
do care about the law, contrary
to Dupen's statement.
By law, it is the NLRB which
decides, once petition for col
lective bargaining is made,
which categories of workers
may be in a bargaining unit.
Prior to that timeany employee
has the right to sign a (blue)
union authorization card.
The employer is prohibited
by law from even asking an
employee if she has signed
such a card! Only the Labor
Board will ever see these cards,
never the employer. And any
employee may also organize
with others havings/mr/ar jobs.
(Even managers could form
their own labor group, al
though managers are not pro
tected by the NLRB.)
What the NLRB decides
is which categories of workers
can be in the same unit. By
prior restraint of labor organiz

ing, the University could de
cide before the issue even
reaches the Board who may
and who may not be in the bar
gaining unit by preventing
some people from participat
ing in labor activities and by ac
tions which havc j the effect of
intimidating employees from
exercising suth rights as sign
ing the cards which constitute
a petition to the Nl RB.
So, if you have a job in a cler
ical classification — Secretary
111, Administrative Assistant I,
Office Assistant IV — and have
been told that you are a
"supervisor," ask yourself

whether you are truly part of
management or really a work
ing supervisor. Are you being
paid a management-level sal
ary?
And if you wish to help the
clerical employees, remember
that community support is im
portant to office staff efforts to
organize at Stanford as they
have already done at Boston
University, Santa Clara
County, BART, Kaiser and
elsewhere.

versity and at the Medical
Center. The National Labor Re
lations Act, which makes it il
legal tor management to inter
fere with union activities, is
being used as an excuse to do
just that by management's ef
forts to convince clerical
employees that they are part of
management!
One problem seems to be
that in the typical SLAC or Uni
versity or Medical Center of
fice with more than one clerical
employee there is a hierarchy.
One secretary has more ex
perience or seniority than
another, and, in the interest of
efficiency, gives typing or
xeroxing to another secretary
to do.
Sometimes the more experi
enced secretary is asked by her
boss about the work of another
secretary. But the senior sec
retary is still doing clerical or
administrative work. Is she part
of management?
In order to clarify this situa
tion, USE, on behalf of several
SLAC employees, filed an un
fair labor practices charge with
the NLRB. Clearly those in
volved in organizing at SLAC
do care about the law, contrary
to Dupen's statement.
By law, it is the NLRB which
decides, once petition for col
lective bargaining is made,
which categories of workers
may be in a bargaining unit.
Prior to that timeany employee
has the right to sign a (blue)
union authorization card.
The employer is prohibited
by law from even asking an
employee if she has signed
such a card! Only the Labor
Board will ever see these cards,
never the employer. And any
employee may also organize
with others havings/mr/ar jobs.
(Even managers could form
their own labor group, al
though managers are not pro
tected by the NLRB.)
What the NLRB decides
is which categories of workers
can be in the same unit. By
prior restraint of labor organiz

ing, the University could de
cide before the issue even
reaches the Board who may
and who may not be in the bar
gaining unit by preventing
some people from participat
ing in labor activities and by ac
tions which havc j the effect of
intimidating employees from
exercising suth rights as sign
ing the cards which constitute
a petition to the Nl RB.
So, if you have a job in a cler
ical classification — Secretary
111, Administrative Assistant I,
Office Assistant IV — and have
been told that you are a
"supervisor," ask yourself

whether you are truly part of
management or really a work
ing supervisor. Are you being
paid a management-level sal
ary?
And if you wish to help the
clerical employees, remember
that community support is im
portant to office staff efforts to
organize at Stanford as they
have already done at Boston
University, Santa Clara
County, BART, Kaiser and
elsewhere.
