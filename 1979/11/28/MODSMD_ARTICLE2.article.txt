# Lomita expansion plans jammed

### Richard Kim 
Although the University an
nounced plans last spring to close
ott part of Mayfield Avenue while
extending lomita Drive, nothing
is being done on the project, said
Max Mazenko, campus planner of
facilities and properties.
He emphasized however, "The
project is on the shell, but not
cancelled." The University de
cided to wait until Campus Drive
is extended west, Mazenko said.
If Lomita were extended, cars
would no longer be able to turn
off onto the road in front of the
Robert Moore Houses. Instead, a
new road would be built connect
ing Lomita Drive with Campus
Drive. Several fraternities, espe
cially Alpha Delta Phi and Kappa
Alpha, protested the action stat
ing that the plan would cut into

the recreation spaces ot their
houses.
According to Director of Com
munity Relations Andrew Doty,
the University had two major
reasons for proposing the plan.
"One concern the University
has is the protection ot the Row,"
Doty said, referring to the increas
ing traffic along Mayfield which
hinders access to the houses.
The other concern is safety,
which President Richard Lyman
later explained is associated with
the 90 degree curve on Maytield
Avenue.
In a memo to William Massey,
vice president for business and fi
nance, Lyman announced post
ponement of the Lomita Drive ex
tension on May 21 "pending
clarification of several ques
tions."

Massey said nothing will hap
pen until after Campus Drive is
extended west, which could be "a
year or two or more."
Mazenko said that the Campus
Drive extension was delayed by
other (actors.
"If the extension of Campus
Drive is not successful, the Lomita
Drive extension will be reconsi
dered," he said.
Robert Gustafson, Alpha Delta
Phi president, said, "When we
were fighting Lomita Drive, we fi
gured if we got it delayed, they
would blow it oft when they saw
that the extension of Campus
Drive west would solve their prob
lems.
"We recognize the fact that the
idea is preposterous enough that
it would never be built," he ad
ded.

At a "non-road partv" held last spring, residents of Alpha Delta Phi circulated petitions protesting the University's
plan to extend Lomita Drive. Construction of the road has since been delayed by uncertainty over the future of Cam
pus Drive.
