"Educate women like men,"
says Rousseau, "and the more
they resemble our sex, the less
power they will have over us."
This is the very point I aim at. I
do not wish them to have
power over men; but over
themselves.
Mary Wollstonecraft, 1792
As the feminist movement
gains potency, and the onus of
equal opportunity keeps male
managers awake at night, we
witness the increasing foray of
women into the business
world. The numbers are still
small — fewer than five per
cent of all working women
earn more than $10,000 a year.
The questions that arise from
these calculated promotions
are manifold. The topic of
women and power is an in
triguing one; partly because
the power women have histor
ically wielded in this country
has been the backdoor variety,
acquired through exhaustive
domestic manipulations and
emotional inveighing.But the
price of possession has been
high, and for it, women have
been accorded labels like:
shrew, domestic tyrant, cas
trator . . .
It's only natural, I suppose,
that the influx of women into
the corporate sphere would
generate waves of uneasiness
in this formerly all-male do
main. Perhaps what men fear is
that this time women will not
stop at equality, but will de
mand dominance as well.
Is this fear the impetus be
hind the so-called "managerial
woman" movement? Women
are being instructed by these
proponents of corporate
"gameswomanship" on howto
wield their new-found power
discreetly.
Part of the "game" lies in
learning how to tread a narrow
line: carefully avoiding emas
culating male co-workers or
subordinates or antagonizing
other women or in any way
threatening the stereotype that
the home and family are still
foremost in your affections.
The guideposts along the
way are slick books with hard
titles likeGeff/ng Yours or Boss

Lady — The foundations of the
current media exploitation of
the new corporate women. At
tention is paid to the packag
ing, or rather commoditizing,
of this new corporate clone,
right down to the woman's
Dress for Success book, writ
ten by a man . . .
In these books, all the loom
ing myths of the female condi
tion are dredged up and de
filed : our excessive emotional
ity, irrationality and inability to
handle stress, or success. The
conclusion commonly reached
is honey, if "you can't take the
fire, get back to the kitchen."
Wonderful.
In answer to Freud's infam
ous sigh of "What do women
want?," Jo Foxworth, editor ot
Boss Lady, replies "Power."
Her next line, and you can im
agine her delivering it with a
coy grimace, "And that's not
nice." No, Jo, that's not nice.
But then neither are the man
ipulations, repressive
techniques, or artifices that
you advise women to assume.
And as my eyes slide further
down your pages and en
counter the sentence, "It's
sexy to be competent," I really
begin to fume. Do aggressive,
independent women really
need to have their bid to ac
quire equal status immersed in
sexual reassurances??
Other dubious rationaliza
tions are made by Letty Cottin
Pogrebin in this reference to
her book: "The very title of the
book telegraphs its message.
How to Make it in a Man's
World is a playful irreverent
way of saying: this is games
manship, this is a matter ot ex

ternal acquired values; this is
just for fun . .
The key word in the above
quote is "gamesmanship."
And I believe that something
vital does get lost in this pro
cess: the essential character is
altered and distorted.
Progress according to such
processes is not progress at all,
but regression with a new
twist. Instead of merely rein
forcing the status quo, we're
going to do it one better. We're
going to repress our emotions,
feelings and values and actu
ally become this corporated
god — all the better to com
pete in a man's world, accord
ing to man's rules.
Personally, I liked an an
thropologist's answer to the
Freudian query better: "One
of the best results of the sexual
role-playing which both Freud
and society as a whole encour
ages is that most women, even
if asked, would no longer
know what they really
wanted."
Until we are able to success
fully reverse the tide of custom
and the negative effects of our
socialization, and stand back
and objectively consider our
goals, without the taint of cul
tural expectations coloring our
vision, we will continue to be
duped by these masculine
roles so cleverly superimposed
upon our modes of behavior.
So let's strive for real change,
and get out from under the
shadow of the "managerial
woman!"
