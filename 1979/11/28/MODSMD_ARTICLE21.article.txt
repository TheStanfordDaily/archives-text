Campus lighting
Malcolm Bertoni's Nov. 19
column on campus lighting is
appreciated by the Senate tor
its attention to a community
concern. Yet, the article does
not accurately describe Senate
action on this matter. It is un
fortunate that the article con
fused two community issues:
1) general campus lighting and
2) lighted tennis courts; and
chose to focus on the latter.
Lighting and safety on cam
pus is a major concern of stu
dents and is one of several cru
cial issues before this year's
ASSU Senate. By Nov. 19, the
Senate had already acted to es
tablish a subcommittee to in
vestigate safety at night on
campus, with the object in
mind to present a concrete
proposal for action to the Uni
versity.
Areas outlined for study
were: 1) installation of new
lighting; 2) extension of Mar
guerite hours; 3) removal of
underbrush and trimming of
hedges; 4) establishment of
"safe corridors" along highly
traveled areas (with security
patrol guards); and 5) im
provement of fire alarm box
visibility. All interested stu
dents are invited and encour
aged to attend the organiza
tional meeting for the Sub
committee on Night Lighting
and Safety On Campus, which
will be held at noon at noon
tomorrow in the COP
office, Tresidder Union.
The Senate acted to support
installation of lighting on the
Encina tennis courts in re
sponse to the findings of last
year's Senate and this year's
student referendum. The in
terest in lighted tennis courts is
not as transient as it may seem
but dates back to well before
1973 (when the issue was once
before seriously considered).
I hope that students will not
judge this year's Senate prema
turely without looking into the
actual state of affairs. Our
meetings and records are open
to the public, and we sincerely
hope that every student will
participate in some capacity.
The ASSU Senate cannot suc
ceed in doing its job without
community input and concern.

In response to Linda
Crouse's letter on the Iranian
situation in this country, I ag
ree. Rather than being
"scared," however, I am very
angry about the persecution
being perpetuated against the
Iranian students in this coun
try. What angers me most is the
government's and President
Carter's leadership in this

harassment.
The immigration service's
singling out of Iranian students
for visa checks and deportation
is a blatant act of discrimina
tion and petty vindictiveness.
Is this to constitute a new
wrinkle in American foreign
policy: Whenever Americans
are held hostage in a foreign
country, that country's nation
als residing here will be
punished?
The illogic and inhumanism,
of taking out on Iranian stu
dents here what some of their
fellows are doing in their own
country, should be discour
aged and denounced by the
government, not encouraged
with official actions.
Carter is not setting a moral
tone for this country in this in
stance, but an immoral and ir
rational one. He is sanctioning
vigilantism.
The government should not
only withdraw its edict to the
immigration service to crack
down on Iranian students in
this country, but start trying to
calm down the American
people.
Of course to do that really
honestly, by explaining why
the Iranians are "picking on"
Americans, might expose our
government's role and respon
sibility in the shah's rule in
Iran.
Perhaps to sidetrack the
American public from the
shameful facts, the govern
ment is using the Iranian stu
dents as a scapegoat.
One can only speculate on
the government's motives and
they are not the issue here. The
issue is that the government, if
it is to provide leadership one
can respect as humane and ra
tional, must do all rt can to de
fuse the current American
frenzy against the Iranians pre
sent in our country, not in
flame it.
And I earnestly urge that the
University will do all it can to
resist government pressure to
participate in the "visa ven
detta" and will protect its own
Iranian students. What the
University does here will be
noted by all its foreign stu
dents. A tough position for the
University; it knows that it
must be careful what prece
dent is set here.

Campus lighting
Malcolm Bertoni's Nov. 19
column on campus lighting is
appreciated by the Senate tor
its attention to a community
concern. Yet, the article does
not accurately describe Senate
action on this matter. It is un
fortunate that the article con
fused two community issues:
1) general campus lighting and
2) lighted tennis courts; and
chose to focus on the latter.
Lighting and safety on cam
pus is a major concern of stu
dents and is one of several cru
cial issues before this year's
ASSU Senate. By Nov. 19, the
Senate had already acted to es
tablish a subcommittee to in
vestigate safety at night on
campus, with the object in
mind to present a concrete
proposal for action to the Uni
versity.
Areas outlined for study
were: 1) installation of new
lighting; 2) extension of Mar
guerite hours; 3) removal of
underbrush and trimming of
hedges; 4) establishment of
"safe corridors" along highly
traveled areas (with security
patrol guards); and 5) im
provement of fire alarm box
visibility. All interested stu
dents are invited and encour
aged to attend the organiza
tional meeting for the Sub
committee on Night Lighting
and Safety On Campus, which
will be held at noon at noon
tomorrow in the COP
office, Tresidder Union.
The Senate acted to support
installation of lighting on the
Encina tennis courts in re
sponse to the findings of last
year's Senate and this year's
student referendum. The in
terest in lighted tennis courts is
not as transient as it may seem
but dates back to well before
1973 (when the issue was once
before seriously considered).
I hope that students will not
judge this year's Senate prema
turely without looking into the
actual state of affairs. Our
meetings and records are open
to the public, and we sincerely
hope that every student will
participate in some capacity.
The ASSU Senate cannot suc
ceed in doing its job without
community input and concern.

Persecution
In response to Linda
Crouse's letter on the Iranian
situation in this country, I ag
ree. Rather than being
"scared," however, I am very
angry about the persecution
being perpetuated against the
Iranian students in this coun
try. What angers me most is the
government's and President
Carter's leadership in this

harassment.
The immigration service's
singling out of Iranian students
for visa checks and deportation
is a blatant act of discrimina
tion and petty vindictiveness.
Is this to constitute a new
wrinkle in American foreign
policy: Whenever Americans
are held hostage in a foreign
country, that country's nation
als residing here will be
punished?
The illogic and inhumanism,
of taking out on Iranian stu
dents here what some of their
fellows are doing in their own
country, should be discour
aged and denounced by the
government, not encouraged
with official actions.
Carter is not setting a moral
tone for this country in this in
stance, but an immoral and ir
rational one. He is sanctioning
vigilantism.
The government should not
only withdraw its edict to the
immigration service to crack
down on Iranian students in
this country, but start trying to
calm down the American
people.
Of course to do that really
honestly, by explaining why
the Iranians are "picking on"
Americans, might expose our
government's role and respon
sibility in the shah's rule in
Iran.
Perhaps to sidetrack the
American public from the
shameful facts, the govern
ment is using the Iranian stu
dents as a scapegoat.
One can only speculate on
the government's motives and
they are not the issue here. The
issue is that the government, if
it is to provide leadership one
can respect as humane and ra
tional, must do all rt can to de
fuse the current American
frenzy against the Iranians pre
sent in our country, not in
flame it.
And I earnestly urge that the
University will do all it can to
resist government pressure to
participate in the "visa ven
detta" and will protect its own
Iranian students. What the
University does here will be
noted by all its foreign stu
dents. A tough position for the
