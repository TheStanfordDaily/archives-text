## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — Robyn
Sue Steiner says she was al
ready into drugs and rebellion
when she met Russell Little.
Together they organized the
Symbionese Liberation Army.
Steiner, daughter of a
middle-class Miami couple,
fled to England in 1974 under
an SLA death sentence for de
serting her terrorist comrades.
Now she has emerged from
hiding to provide details of life
inside the group that made
headlines around the world
with the kidnapping of news
paper heiress Patricia Hearst.
Authorities say Steiner's
reappearance may be con
nected with little's retrial in
March lor the murder ot Oak
land school superintendent
Marcus Foster. Little and
Joseph Remiro were convicted
of tirst-degree murder in 1975
lor the 1973 slaying ol Foster,
wlio was gunned down with
cyahide-tipped bullets.
The convictions were over
turned by a state appeals court
on the grounds that the trial
judge erred by asking jurors,
who were originally split in
their decisions, to reconsider
their verdict.
Steiner, who still live:, in Eng

land and taces no criminal
charges herself, told her story
in a copyright article that ap
peared in the San Francisco
Chronicle on Monday.
She said she decided to flee
when she got a call from a
friend.
"Get out of your apartment
now, Robyn Sue," the caller
said. "The Symbionese Libera
tions Army has put a death war
rant out on you."
She went to England where
she watched a television
broadcast of the Los Angeles
shootout in which six SLA
members died.
"If it hadn't been for a mis
placed sense of honor, I would
have fingered the gang to the
American pigs, but I swore I
never would and I've kept my
word," she said.
Steiner says after she met Lit
tle in 1971, they became in
volved with Venceremos, a
radical group, when they ar
rived in the San Francisco Bay
area.
Steiner said the SLA moved
toward terrorism largely under
the guidance of ex-convict
Donald DeFreeze, or "Field
Marshall Cinque."
She said she kept the fledgl
ingSLAafloat, bringingin up to

$2000 a week by stealing, forg
ing and shoplifting. She also
contends she stole the cyanide
applied to the bullets which fel
led Foster.
She said DeFreeze was con
sumed with the idea of killing
"pigs." He kept a list of assas
sination victims which in
cluded former President
Richard Nixon, Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) and as
sorted bankers, politicians and
prominent people.
Despite her role in the birth
of the SLA, she fled to Florida a
short time after the Foster kil
lings. But DeFreeze contacted
and told her four days before
the Hearst kidnappings that
the SLA was about to pull "the
biggest action since Foster."
Hearst, now married to a San
Francisco police officer, was
kidnapped Feb. 4, 1974. Later
she joined her terrorist abduc
tors and went underground
until hercapture Sept. 18,1975.
She was convicted of taking
part in an SLA bank robbery
and served a short prison term.
Authorities believe the
urban terrorist organization is
now inactive, with its four
known surviving members in
prison.
