# Ornstein discusses mental skills

Different modes of thinking may enable
us to utilize our brains more effectively,
according to Dr. Robert Ornstein, author
of The Psychology of Consciousness and a
guest professor here next quarter.
In a series of experiments studying the
highly-specialized left and right hemis
pheres of the brain, Ornstein, who re
ceived his Ph.D. in psychology at the Uni
versity, has discovered that people may
have more control over their mental pro
cesses than was previously believed.
"We've been able to show that it is more
the style of thinking you adopt than what
you're working on that determines which
half of the brain is active," he says.
While the analytical left hemisphere of
the brain tends to understand elements of
reality in isolation, the intuitive right
hemisphere is concerned with relation
ships among individual elements.
EEG readings from the electrode
covered caps worn by the subjects of
Ornstein's experiments indicated that the
level of mental activity in the left and right
hemispheres of the brain varies according
to the way of thinking an individual is most
comfortable with, as well as the type of
task that is being performed.
According to Ornstein, it would not re
quire a big change for an individual to en
hance his thinking.
"We have a lot of possibilities within
ourselves that we don't always use, but
some of it is much closer to realization
than we realize."
In an article in Human Nature, a
magazine directed by Ornstein, he ob

serves that society traditionally has
valued left-hemisphere or analytical men
tal skills more than right-hemisphere or
intuitive skills.
This priority is evidenced in school cur
riculum's emphasis on analytical thinking
and society's preoccupation with "The
Facts," according to Ornstein. He notes
that while a writer is admired for his or her
great mind, an artist is admired for his or
her great eye.
"Now that's a sort of lower level com
pliment," Ornstein comments. "What I
would like us to understand is that we have
a whole range of abilities. First, we should
understand that each person can think in a
variety of ways. Secondly, we should un
derstand that certain people might prefer
to make contributions in one mode of
thought rather than the other."
In the course he will teach here winter
quarter, Ornstein plans to show that
human mental capabilities and human
consciousness are more diverse and flexi
ble than people realize.
"I plan to go into self-regulation,
biofeedback, the role of the two halves of
the brain, a new understanding of how
human beings evolved and developed and
every phase we see from infancy to old age
to show that people are much more capa
ble than we give them credit for," he said.
Ornstein's approach to psychology
utilizes the esoteric or folk psychologies of
the Mideast and Far East as well as the
contemporary, scientific approach. In his
book, The Psychology of Consciousness,
Ornstein says that the practical, empirical
approach to knowledge of traditional

psychologies should be synthesized with
the scientific approach.
He said he would like to provide his
students with a balance between the per
sonal and the objective understandings of
human knowledge and consciousness.
Ornstein is currently working on a
Psychology One textbook in which he
plans to present psychology as a more in
tegrated discipline than other authors
have presented it.

"I'm trying to relate it (psychology) to
what it tells us about a person's expeii
ences and a person's possibilities. I hope
to make it possible lor more students to
see how lascinating much of the research
that psychologists are doing really is," he
said.
