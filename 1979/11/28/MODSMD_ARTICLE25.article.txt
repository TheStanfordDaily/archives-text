I Sacramento (AP) — Fewer than one-third of
California adults in a new survey rated them
selves in top physical and emotional health,
and more than one-sixth reported emotional
problems, state officials reported last Mon
day.
The Department of Mental Health released
a blizzard of statistics to support its conten
tion that more needs to be done to prevent
mental illness, and that one of the simplest
ways is for people with problems to talk to
other people.
A goal of the department's planned educa
tion program is to encourage people to "have
a person or persons with whom they can
communicate in times of trouble," Director
Dale Farabee told reporters.
He said 75 percent of those surveyed
thought that such communications was a
good idea, but only 9 percent said they had
done it themselves.
The survey by Field Research Corp. co
vered interviews with a cross section of 1006

Californians aged 18 and over in their homes
between March 23 and April 5.
Findings included:
— Forty-two percent said they suffered
from one or more specific medical condi
tions, including back troubles — the most
prevalent — arthritis, asthma, heart, lung or
kidney problems, ulcers and diabetes.
— Another 21 percent reported "non
specific" medical problems, such as high
blood pressure, frequent headaches or dizzy
spells.
— Seventeen percent reported emotional
conditions such as frequent insomnia, de
pression, anxiety and irritability. But 89 per
cent described their mental health as "excel
lent" or "pretty good," only 2 percent said
they often thought they would have a nerv
ous breakdown, and fewer than 1 percent
said they had seriously considered suicide.
— Forty percent reported "dependency"
problems, such as excessive drinking or
smoking.
