Days of old
April 21, 1972. More than 200 persons, including 116 students, were
arrested when a campus anti-Vietnam War demonstration ended in a
violent melee on El Camino Real. Here, police nab three demonstrators for
blocking the entrance to Encina Hall during the early hours of the riot. A
story on this and other events marking the 1970s will be published tomor
row in the second edition of the Stanford Daily Magazine.
