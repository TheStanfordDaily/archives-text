# Visiting scholar helps to explain Japan's economy
## 
### Chris Heftel 
Economist Kotaro
Suzumura, a visiting profes
sor from the University of
Kyoto in Japan, specializes
in theoretical economics.
But he said the University
invited him here for a year
because they needed
someone to teach courses
on the Japanese economy.
Suzumura said he is
happy to be teaching
Japanese economics here.
"I am mainly a theorist,
but surely I have my
background research and
study on the Japanese
economy, and my interest
in the Japanese economy is
of course very strong," he
said.
Although only 35,
Suzumura is well-known in
his specialized field, a
branch of welfare
economics called "Social
Choice Theory." Economic
models are used in this field
to measure the desirability
of one social system over
another.
Stanford has several
prominent scholars in fields
closely related to his, mak
ing the University especially
appealing to Suzumura. Ac
cording to one of those
scholars, Economics Prof.
Peter Hammond, Suzumura
is the "most prominent
Japanese in the field . . . it's
a delight that he'£ here for a
year."
Suzumura explained that
to him "teaching is not a un
ilateral flow of knowledge,
it's a bilateral exchange of

views." He said he values
the chance to see how
American students view the
Japanese economy.
He will offer an under
graduate course next quar
ter called "Japanese
Economic Development,"
and one the following quar
ter on "Contemporary
Japanese Problems." Open
to all majors, these courses
will have no prerequisites.
Economics Dept. Chair
man Bert Hickman is en
thusiastic about his
Japanese colleague: "We're
lucky to have attained his
services. . . I hope students
will take advantage of it."
„ Some already are. Nearly
a dozen math-minded
graduate students are tak
ing an intricately planned
tour through Suzumura's
latest set of theories in a
course this quarter —
Economics 288, "Rational
Choice, Collective Decision
and Social Welfare."
He teaches his specialty
with precision, though En
glish is not his fiijst lan
guage. His accent some
times distorts words, but
students seem to under
stand him. One of them
explained, "After a while
you get used to the way he
speaks and become very
comfortable. Language is
definitely no handicap."
There is a sincere tone in
the professor's steady,
high-pitched voice. Calm
but alert in class, he
methodically introduces an
idea, pauses, walks to the

blackboard and writes the
appropriate equation while
restating its components,
steps away quickly and
again pauses, his point
reemphasized by the si
lence. Carefully studying
students' faces to be sure
the information has soaked
in, he moves on to his next
point and the process is re
peated.
"He's got a good feeling
for the overall ability and
level of understanding that
students have,"
engineering - economics
student Neal Stoughton
commented admiringly.
"He's very patient to bring
across his point of view and
have everyone understand.
Suzumura gives the credit
to his students.
"They raise a lot of intelli
gent questionsduring class.
Using these questions as
clues, I can prepare
supplementary materials.
So, teaching is rather easy to
organize in this country."
In contrast, Suzumura
feels that "students in Japan
tend to be mute, they just sit
and take notes."
There are other aspects of
American university life that
Suzumura also prefers. He
feels that lapanese univer
sities burden their profes
sors with too many adminis
trative duties, leaving less
time for teaching and re
search.
In addition, a scholar in
)apan must normally remain
with one school and restrict
his research to a narrow

area. American scholars,
Suzumura thinks, are more
mobile and have much grea
ter diversity in their fields of
research.
Although this is his first
job in America, being over
seas is not new for Suzum
ura and his family. They
spent three years in Eng
land, where he did research
at Cambridge and taught at
the London School of
Economics.
These years helped him
gain the international
perspective necessary for
ins present research. His
command of the English
language also blossomed
during this period.
Economics Prof. David Star
red said he feels that
Suzumura is "one of the
best teachers in English I
know at that is not a native
speaker."
Suzumura's wife and
three daughters enjoy living

in America, according to
Suzumura. The girls attend
elementary school in Moun
tain View, near the family's
residence. According to
their father, they are "get
ting by" in school with the
help of a teaching assistant
for foreign students.
Suzumura said he is not
homesick. In addition to the
advantages of working at
Stanford, and the know
ledge that his family is hap
py in America, Suzumura
finds pleasure in such
things as going to garage
sales and having greater ac
cess to English novels. He
particularly enjoys reading
"Agatha Christie" stories.
Suzumura will return to
lapan in September after
spending some time alone
to work on his research, and
touring America with his
family. Smiling brightly in
anticipation, he com
mented, "This is a very big
country."
