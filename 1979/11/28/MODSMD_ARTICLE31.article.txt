# Women urged to join political game
## 
### Julie Kaufmann Nancy Silbergeld 
A leading feminist urged
women here to get involved in
the political process last week,
saying that "at every economic
level, women are at the bottom
rung."
Iris Mitgang, chairman of the
National Women's Political
Caucus (NWPC), spoke before
85 people in Terman. Her
speech was sponsored by the
Center for Research on Wo
men.
"Many men with only a high
school education are way
beyond women with a college
education in their ability to
earn," she said.
The 1976 UC-Davis graduate
reproved women for not using
their potential political clout.
Mitgang emphasized the
importance of voting. "The bal
lot box is how we get power,"
she maintained.
* The NWPC now claims
45,000 members and has 300
state and local caucuses across
the country.
Mitgang also advised women
to take on political roles. "If we
are going to change the system
we have to learn to play the
game," she said. According to
Mitgang, women should as
sume political positions be
cause male politicians are un
sympathetic to women's is
sues.
"Women aren't going to get
any gifts from male politicians
. . . (This country needs) a
women's perspective because
the consciousness and life ex

perience of women are diffe
rent from those of men."
Judiciary slights women *
Mitgang criticized the tradi
tional appointment of men to
federal judiciary positions. She
noted that in the history of the
Federal )udiciary only 25
women have served on a pos
sible 1003 seats.
"I know I have my pre
judices, but I can't believe that
there have only been 25 qual
ified women," she said.
"I'm sick of hearing about
qualifications. I've seen too
many qualified women (passed
over in favor of) too many
mediocre men," she said.
Mitgang said she considers
government the last male bas
tion, adding that there are nqw
onlyl7women in Congress out
of a total of 435 seats. No
women serve as federal judges
in Northern California, she ad
ded.
Election plans
The NWPC plans to spend
about $250,000 to train women
in candidate selection for the
coming presidential election.
The organization will work in
every state that has at least 60
delegates to the party conven
tions to teach women how to
question and choose a candi
date.
"Education is the most im
portant tool," she said, "al
though assertiveness helps,
too."
"We are the only majority
constituency, with 51.4 per
cent of the vote. Women are
the only group in the electo
rate who have a majority just by
breathing," she said.
