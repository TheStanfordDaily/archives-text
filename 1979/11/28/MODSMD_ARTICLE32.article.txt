# But where's Schonert?
## Margerum, Naber named to All Pac-10 
### 
Wide receiver Ken Margerum
and kicker Ken Naber were the
two Stanford tootball players
named yesterday to the All-
Pacific-10 Conference first
team by the league's coaches.
It was the second consecu
tive such honor for Margerum,
who was also selected by the
nation's coaches to UPl's first
team All-America squad. The
6-foot-1, 175-lb. junior from
Fountain Valley caught 41 pas
ses for 733 yards and 10
touchdowns this season.
Naber, in essence, earned
double recognition from the
Pac-10. His 42.4 punting aver

age and his 55 points on 31 of 33
conversion kicks and eight of
14 field goal attempts earned
him both top punter and
placekicker honors.
Quarterback Turk Schonert,
who led the Pac-10 and leads
the nation in passing, was
somehow left off both the first
and second teams and had to
settle for honorable mention
notice.
Defensive tackle Chuck
Evans and offensive tackle
Brian Holloway were both
named to the Pac-10 second
team, and offensive tackle

Andre Hines earned honorable
mention honors.
Ail-American tailback
Charles White made the first
team, as did eight of his USC
teammates. One of them, Paul
McDonald, edged California's
Rich Campbell for the first
team quarterback slot.
Six Huskies from
Washington were also selected
to the 25-member first team.
Cal, despite its 6-5 season, was
the only school without a first
team player, though eight
Bears were named to the sec
ond team.
