## Field hockey squad opens tough battle for nat'l title 
### Jennifer Seymour 
Tradition has it that the
country's leading field hockey
teams come from the East. But
this year as Stanford and sev
eral other West Coast hockey
teams head to Princeton for the
AIAW Hockey Championships,
that convention may be proved
archaic.
The fifth annual AIAW Field
Hockey Championships run
from Wednesday Nov. 28-Dec.
2. It is a double-elimination
tournament, so each team is
guaranteed only two matches.
Stanford will meet Ursinus of
Pennsylvania for Wednesday's
2:30 commencement rounds,
and play either Maryland or
Washington State in their sec
ond match.
This year's vote put Stanford
at 12th place nationally, after
the team earned a 12-3-3 sea
son record and finished sec
ond in the Region B's. Stan
ford's opposition, Ursinus,
finished their season with a
12-6-1 standing and is currently
ranked fifth in the country.
This team took second place in
the '75, '76 and '77 Nationals.
Despite tough competition,

coach Barbara Longstreth is
optimistic. "This is definitely a
hard draw, but we can beat
them. We're really looking
forward to playing, especially a
team like Ursinus. Our game
has progressed in these parts
— we're now on par with the
best teams in the country. This
will give us an opportunity to
demonstrate this point."
The scotchers were guaran
teed this trip to Princeton after
finishing second in the Norcal
conference behind San lose
State, and then placing second
behind Long Beach State in the
Region 8 tournament. League
victories include Chico State,
3-1, U.O.P. 4-0, Sacramento
State 4-1, and UC-Davis 5-1.
The Stanford hockey team's
strength is reflected in indi
vidual statistics. The team has
35 goals to its credit with only
13 scored against. Goalie
Cecca Freccero boasts 101
saves for this season, and lead
ing scorer Nancy White has put
in 15 goals against other teams.
Becky Howell and Claudia
Cold lead in team assists —12
each. The totaf points for of
fensive team members is led by

White with 22. Next is Howell,
15, then Gold, 14, Kelly Wes
terwick, 12, and Lynn Keyser, 5.
The scotchers must
nonetheless be in top form to
deal with this week's competi
tion. Notoriously superior
teams such as first-ranked St.
Louis and Penn St.and
third-ranked Maryland are just
three of the 16 teams invited to
compete. Stanford also faces
potentially freezing tempera
tures. Finally the double
elimination policy means you
must win one of two matches
to keep playing — there is no
room for lapses here.
Despite rigorous conditions
the team sounds positive about
the tournament. Says forward
Kelly Westerwick about the
championships: "We're really
excited to go. What it comes
down to is that all the teams are
physically prepared so the
mental preparation is what'll
make the difference. We ought
to do well. We've never played
against these teams before, so
it's hard to tell, but judging
from how we played in the Reg
ional, I think we can beat
them. It'll be really fun."
