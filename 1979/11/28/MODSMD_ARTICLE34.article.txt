### Robert Stone 
The kingpin of men's cross
country at Stanford for the last
four years closed his collegiate
career in high fashion by run
ning one of his fastest times
ever for 10,000 meters. Roy Kis
sin, the lone Cardinal harrier
who qualified for the NCAA
Championships run at Lehigh
University last Monday, paced
to a 61st place finish in 30:33.6,
one of his better clockings for
the race.
Coach Dean Clark, who ac
companied Kissin to the
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania
course, noted that his runner
notched his best time ever in
the first mile of the race, and
eferred to the overall finishers
.n the race provided "unbe
lievable competition," al

though the rough running sur
face may have slowed times a
bit.
The individual standings in
the finals were very similar to
those in the Pac-10 Champion
ships run here November 10th
as Washington State's world
record holder Henry Rono and
Alberto Salazar of Oregon
again ran one-two for the top
honors. Rono's time for the
race was a very quick 28:19.4,
with Salazar at his heels in
28:27.6. Kipsubai Kotkei of
New Mexico took third in
28:47.0.
The team championship was
captured by the University of
Texas-El Paso who had the low
score of 86 points. Oregon
placed second with 93.

About the former All-
American's final race Clark
said, "I think Roy has had a very
brilliant career during which
he has had to overcome some
physical problems. It was a fit
ting way to end his career,
qualifying for the finals and
doing the best he could." The
coach also mentioned that Kis
sin has a good future ahead of
him and could become a prom
inent name on the track circuit.
Concerning the men's cross
country team Clark pointed
out, "The team finished the
season with a great degree of
excitement. There was lots of
enthusiasm that should make
for a good spring track season.
The momentum of cross coun
try will lead into track."
