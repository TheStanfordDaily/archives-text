# Hell in High Water
## You lead the horses to water but you can't make them win

While "youth and inex
perience" have been the
most commonly-offered
explanations for the
shortcomings of the Stan
ford water polo team this
year, the issue of why a team
with the most talented start
ing seven in the nation
comes up third in the NCAA
championships remains
slightly unclear.
Before going any further,
it would be misleading not
to point out that any other
team comprised of one
senior, two juniors, three
sophomores and one
freshman would rightly be
proud of a third-place finish
in the nationals. But the
Cardinals are not just any
other team. The Stanford
starting seven is perhaps
one of the greatest accumu
lations of water polo talent
assembled on the college
level.
Senior Randy Kalbus, who
was selected to the NCAA
all-tourney first team and is
a strong All-America candi
date, contributed more to
the team than is reflected in
statistics. Usually (he first
player down the pool on the
counter-attack, Kalbus gave
his best effort every time he
put on his suit. The respect
he earned as the team

leader, however, may have
come a bit too late. If the
rest of the team had been
more accustomed to follow
ing his lead, his "play our
game" attitude might have
gone a long way in reducing
the confused panic which
reigned during the Cards'
second-half collapse against
UC-Santa Barbara in last
weekend's semifinals.
But the team speed of the
Cauchos had effectively
nullified the Stanford fast
break, forcing the Cards to
rely on their front-court of
fense. Unfortunately, (he
key to Stanford's front
court play is the dominating
influence of sophomore
hole man Jody Campbell,
who fouled out of the game
early in the third quarter.
With Campbell directing
traffic from four meters, the
Cards can be a nightmare
for opposing defenses. But
without the services of
Campbell or the penetrat
ing Alan Mouchawar, who
also fouled out, Stanford's
front-court attack in the
fourth quarter of the semi
final match was as effective
as a sterile wet dream.
Junior Steve Smith, who
sets the hole when
Campbell is out of the game

or slow getting down the
pool, has had a lot of pres
sure on him all season —
and certainly he carried his
largest burden in the Santa
Barbara game. The only
Cardinal starter without in
ternational experience,
Smith found himself placed
in a talented crowd. Though
he is less adept at ball
handling than Campbell,
and is less of a scoring
threat, Smith's abilities
would be greatly ap
preciated on a less talent
laden team. Playing in such
proficient company,
Smith's greatest obstacle
this year was lack of confi
dence — as more than one
of his teammates has at
tested. He recognized his
very real abilities himself
after an outstanding per
formance against the Cal
fornia Bears Sunday.
"The way I played to
night," he said, "made me
think I could have played
that way the rest of the
year." Most of his team
mates and his coach would
probably agree with him.
Goalie John Gansel, an
All-America since his
freshman year two years
ago, had his least effective
season in a Cardinal cap.

Only late in the season did
he show signs of the
dominating, game
commanding, breath-taker
that was the norm in the
past two seasons. During
this season, he was still
probably the best goalie in
the country, and his ability
to direct the Cardinal de
fense noticeably improved.
But it wasn't until the last
two weeks of the season
that spectators began to see
the type of play which set
Cansel above his goaltend
ing peers — Cansel's finest
handiwork has resulted in
bewildered hole men who
find approaching passes
stolen before their eyes,
and wide-open shooters,
whose well-placed shots
suddenly find obstruction
from Cansel's arm.
Part of the reason for
Gansel's seemingly lac
kadaisical play during the
early part of the year may
stem from coach Dante De
ttamanti's too-confident
treatment of his goalie. De
ttamanti seemed to treat
Gansel's superior play as an
almost unfaltering variable
— something you can al
ways count on. Several
times he referred to his
players being able to "cheat
a little on defense with Gan

sel in the goal."
But Dettamanti's biggest
mistake was relying too
much upon his starters.
Depth was a serious prob
lem for Stanford this year,
which the coach astutely
recognized. However, De
ttamanti chose to compen
sate for this by making sure
his starters could play the
whole game, rather than
developing his bench. For
most of the games, his
strategy worked. Using first
substitute Greg Lambert
only sparingly — and even
then only in absolutely
necessary situations — pro
duced a problem which cost
the Cards a championship.
Santa Barbara coach Pete
Snyder intelligently realized
that Stanford "is a different
team" without their experi
enced players in the lineup,
and he made good use of
that. Using tactics that no
amount of conditioning
could prevent, Snyder put
Campbell and Mouchawar
where they couldn't hurt
him: on the bench. When
Lambert and Brian Felix
were sent in to replace the
two Cardinal stars, their lack
of playing experience with
their own teammates
showed through — particu

larly in such a pressure
game, as the NCAA semifi
nal certainly was.
As Dettamanti told his de
jected team after the loss to
Santa Barbara, Stanford's
chances for a title next year
have to be respected by
other teams. Losing only

Kalbus to graduation, the
starting seven for the 1980
squad should be even more
dominating than this year's
was at their peak.
And hopefully, De
ttamanti now realizes that
seven players does not a
championship make.

First to be called on but too seldom used, Brian Felix and Greg
Lambert look on from their all-too-familiar spot: the Stanford
bench. Felix's early-season injury notwithstanding, the two
substitutes' relative inactivity may have been an important
factor in the Cards' short-falling at the NCAA championships
this year.
