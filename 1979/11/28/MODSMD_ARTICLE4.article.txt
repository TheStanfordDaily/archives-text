# Two new magazines may threaten Sequoia
## 
### Michael London 
The birth of two new student
magazines, Inquisitor and Inside
Stanford, has produced a whirl of ac
tivity and controversy this quarter.
Sequoia, the University's 88-year-old
literary magazine which is undergo
ing substantial changes, will further
stiffen competition when all three
magazines begin publishing in
January.
The Inquisitor was organized this
quarter by junior Mindy Mayer, a
Sequoia staffer who plans to com
bine fiction, poetry, feature stories
and reviews in a student-written,
student-aimed publication. Sequoia
is a purely literary magazine which
has traditionally relied heavily on
non-student works.
But Mayer's plans came under fire
from sophomore Darren Barnett,
who received $500 from the ASSU
Publications Board Oct. 24 to publish
Inside Stanford, a "general interest
and literary magazine."
Barnett charges that Mayer "dis
honestly" gathered information for
the Inquisitor at an Inside Stanford
organizational meeting.

On Oct. 23, Barnett met with
Mayer and Alison Ball, now a co
editor of the Inquisitor.
"They never mentioned they were
thinking of starting their own
magazine," Barnett said. "They led
me to believe they were going to be
my fiction editors."
At the meeting, Barnett shared his
ideas for Inside Stanford, along with
his research on printing costs, stu
dent interest and advertising poten
tial. The following day, Mayer pre
sented a preliminary proposal for the
Inquisitor to the Publications Board.
"What they learned from me con
vinced them to go ahead with the
Inquisitor," Barnett charged. "I don't
know just how much they copied
from us, but I'm sure hearing our
ideas didn't hurt them at all."
Mayer said she told Barnett that
she was considering working for
him, but she called his charges
ridiculous.
"I decided to go ahead with the
Inquisitor because I didn't like a lot
of Darren's ideas," she said.
lack Trumpbour, chairman of the
Publications Board, said Mayer was

the first to approach him about a
magazine at the beginning of the
quarter.
"Mayer developed her plans inde
pendently of her contact with Bar
nett," said Trumpbour, who is re
commending that the Publications
Board give the Inquisitor $500 to
match its grant to Inside Stanford.
Mayer said she designed the In
quisitor to fill the "gaping hole" bet
ween Sequoia and the Stanford
Daily.
"There are a lot of closet writers on
campus who find the thought of
submitting to Sequoia very impos
ing," Mayer said.
Varied coverage
Mayer and co-editors Ball and ]ay
Dufrechou are planning a diversified
magazine. "A typical issue will in
clude a couple of stories, some
poetry and artwork, several feature
articles and serious theater and rilm
reviews," Mayer said.
Feature stories will be in-depth
and oriented toward off-campus
events. Current plans include an
examination of local communes and
a piece on comedy nightclubs in San

Francisco.
"The whole idea is a loose format,"
Mayer said. "Something that people
will feel comfortable picking up."
The Inquisitor will be published
using high quality newsprint and run
about 30 pages, including advertis
ing. The editors plan to publish at
least once a quarter, and sell the
issue for 50 cents each.
On the other hand
Like the Inquisitor, Inside Stanford
will print fiction and poetry,
graphics, feature articles and re
views. Features will focus on campus
concerns; an in-depth piece on the
University Food Service is currently
being planned. Also under consider
ation are regular columns on science
and campus sports.
"The Inquisitor people worship
the New York Review of Books and
the Village Voice," said Barnett, ad
ding that he plans to avoid such
"literary snobbery.
"What we want is a fine literary
magazine that a lot of people will
read."
