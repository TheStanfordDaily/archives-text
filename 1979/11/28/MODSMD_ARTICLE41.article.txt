# Three weeks to go
## NFL playoff picture still muddled 
### Associated Press 
With three weeks remaining
in the regular season and 10
playoff berths up for grabs, 13
teams still are solid contenders
for the National Football
League's postseason road to
the Super Bowl.
And, in its infinite wisdom
(not to mention a bit of luck)
the NFL has managed to
schedule each division con
tender against each other â€”
games which will go a long way
toward determining who suits
up after Dec. 17 ana who goes
home to start trimming the
Christmas tree.
Based on strength-of
schedule comparisons, it
would seem Miami,
Pittsburgh, San Diego, Los
Angeles and Tampa Bay have
the inside tracks to five of the
six divisional titles with
Washington and Philadelphia
given tne nod over Dallas for
tne favorites' role in the sixth.
But, then again, teams with
winning records don't always

beat teams with losing records,
do they?
In the American Confer
ence, New England and Miami
are tied for tne East Division
lead at 8-5, Pittsburgh and
Houston are deadlocked atop
the Central Division at 10-3 and
San Diego, at 10-3, leads De
nver by one game in the West.
Buffalo and Oakland, each at
7-6, and Cleveland, 8-5, are
rated outsiders at best for AFC
playoff berths.
In the National Conference,
Philadelphia is 9-4 and one
game ahead of both Dallas and
Washington in the East, Tampa
Bay is 9-4 and two games up on
Chicago in the Central Division
and Los Angeles and New Or
leans are tied at 7-6 atop the
West. No other NFC teams are
rated serious playoff conten
ders.
The dates for the head-to
head competition which could
decide who's in and who's out
when the playoffs begin with
the Dec. 23 wild-card round.

it's New England at Miami on
Nov. 29, Chicago at Tampa Bay
on Dec. 2, Dallas at Philadel
phia on Dec. 8, Pittsburgh at
Houston on Dec. 10,
Washington at Dallas and New
Orleans at Los Angeles on Dec.
16 and Denver at San Diego on
Dec. 17.
Taking it one step beyond
the likelihood that heaa-to
head games will determine
winners and also-rans, and ig
noring for at least one more
week the NFL's tie-breaking
procedures, here's how the
strength-of-schedule factor fi
gures into the final three
games:
Note: the won-lost records
of the contenders' opposition
does not include the New York
Jets-Seattle Seahawks Monday
night game, where applicable.
Miami's opponents have a
combined 15-23 record to the
19-19 confronting the Patriots.
They play each other and the
Jets, the difference being that
the Dolphins also play 2-11 De

troit while the Patriots face 6-7
Minnesota. Miami plays one
road game while the Pats play
two.
Pittsburgh and Houston
each play one road game, but
the Steelers' opponents (Cin
cinnati the Oilers and Buffalo)
have a 20-19 record while the
Oilers' foes (Cleveland, the
Steelers and Philadelphia) are a
strong 27-12.
San Diego, which hosts At
lanta and visits New Orleans
before taking on the visiting
Broncos, has a 29-19 strength
of-schedule slate coming up
while Denver, with three road
games and none at home, faces
Buffalo, Seattle and then the
Charges with a combined 23-15
mark.
In the NFC West, the Rams
host Minnesota and visit At
lanta before hosting the Saints
for a 17-22 opposition record
while New Orleans, facing
Oakland and San Diego before
visiting Los Angeles, has a
tough 24-15 opposition mark.
