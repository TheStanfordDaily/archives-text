Kuwait to cut back oil production
Kuwait — An official ol the Kuwaiti government
said yesterday that Treasury Secretary C. William
Miller may have a difficult time persuading his
government to keep up its oil production.
The ottic lal, who did not want to be identitied,
said oil production is "decided by market consid
erations.''
"The market has a logic ol its own," he said. "It
we tail to appreciate it, we will he |List giving away
handouts."
Kuwaiti ottic lals have announced their intention
to cut back on the country's oil production, now
about 2.2 million barrels a day. However, they
have not said when the cutback would occur, or
how much is planned.
Estimates ol the amount ol a possible c utback
range trom 200,000 barrels a dav to 500,000, al
though diplomatic sources say the lesser ligure is
the most likely.
The oil minister ol Abu Dhabi, which produces
about 1.4 million barrels day, told Miller on
Monday his country will maintain maximum pro
duction, although a slight cutback is necessary lor
technical reasons.
Saude Arabian otncials eailier had declined to
commit themselves to continuing to produce at
their current level ol 9.5 million barrels a day. But
officials traveling with Miller were hopetul they
would decide to do this.
In each country he has visited, Miller has used
the same argument thai high production levels are
necessary to ottset the slowdown in Iranian oil
production. II other nations ( ul back signnicantly.
he argued, oil prices would soar again and could
push the world into a major recession.
Consumer prices up 1 percent
Washington — The sharpest rise in housing costs
in three decades pushed consumer prices up
another I percent in October, all but guaranteeing
the worst inflation rate lor a single year since 1945,
the government said yesterday.
Rapidly rising prices tor energy slowed signnic
antly during the month and lood price increases
showed a modest slowdown. But moderation in
those areas was onset by a 1.5 percent jump in
housing prices — the steepest monthly increase
since 1947, the Labor Department said.
So lar in 1979, consumer prices have risen 11
percent, and government economists predicted
inflation was certain to top 15 percent lor the yeai,
the highest rate since war-time wage and price
controls were lilted in 1945.
"You can say with certainty . . that the inflation
rate will be about I <.5 percent or higher lor the
year," said Theodore lorda, a senior economist a'
the Commerce Depaitment.
Torda and R. Robert Russel, director of the
Council on Wage and Price Stability, said they sec
no Tigris that inflation will slow in the coming

months. In fact, the rate could accelerate when
new consumer price figures are reported next
month, they said.
The high inflation rate has eaten into workers'
wages, and the Labor Department said the pur
chasing power of the average paycheck tell
another 1.1 percent in October. During the prior
12 months an average worker's purchasing power
tell an average 5.1 percent as wages tailed by a long
shot to keep pace with rising prices.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said
the average price across the country tor gasoline
topped $1 a gallon lor the tirst time in October, as
prices rose eight-tenths of a cent on the average
since September.
The seasonally adjusted increase in consumer
prices during October marked the 10th straight
month that the government 's index has recorded a
rise ol about 1 percent, to the frustration of Carter
administration inflation lighters.
The last time intlation in the United States has
been in double digits tor a lull year was 1974, when
a quadrupling of imported oil prices pushed the
rate to 12.2 percent. In 1946, prices jumped 18.2
percent, reflecting the lilting ol controls following
the end ol World War 11.
Shah's operation successful
New York — The last remaining gallstone has
been removed trom the ousted Shah ol Iran, but
his doctors said yesterday that he will be kept in

Chris Godek, a spokesman tor the shah, said the
former monarch hopes to return to Mexico as
soon as dottors permit him, but added, "It's totally
dependent on the doctors' decision.
The shah's doctors have said they would not
oppose his leaving once the gallstone problem
was cleared up.
Shah Mohammad Re/a Pahlavi entered New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Oct. 22 suf
fering from gallstones and lymph cancer. A week
later, Iranian students sei/ed the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran and 49 hostages, and demanded his extrad
ition.
Although the operation was an apparent suc
cess, doctors issued a statement saying they would
keep him tor "the next tew days" to make sure the
bile duct doesn't get intected and no more stones
remain. "The prognosis remains guarded," they
said.
BART train burns; no injuries

system of a Bay Area Rapid Transit district train

injuries and the train was turned over to BART
maintenance personnel, authorities said.

Kuwait to cut back oil production
Kuwait — An official ol the Kuwaiti government
said yesterday that Treasury Secretary C. William
Miller may have a difficult time persuading his
government to keep up its oil production.
The ottic lal, who did not want to be identitied,
said oil production is "decided by market consid
erations.''
"The market has a logic ol its own," he said. "It
we tail to appreciate it, we will he |List giving away
handouts."
Kuwaiti ottic lals have announced their intention
to cut back on the country's oil production, now
about 2.2 million barrels a day. However, they
have not said when the cutback would occur, or
how much is planned.
Estimates ol the amount ol a possible c utback
range trom 200,000 barrels a dav to 500,000, al
though diplomatic sources say the lesser ligure is
the most likely.
The oil minister ol Abu Dhabi, which produces
about 1.4 million barrels day, told Miller on
Monday his country will maintain maximum pro
duction, although a slight cutback is necessary lor
technical reasons.
Saude Arabian otncials eailier had declined to
commit themselves to continuing to produce at
their current level ol 9.5 million barrels a day. But
officials traveling with Miller were hopetul they
would decide to do this.
In each country he has visited, Miller has used
the same argument thai high production levels are
necessary to ottset the slowdown in Iranian oil
production. II other nations ( ul back signnicantly.
he argued, oil prices would soar again and could
push the world into a major recession.
Consumer prices up 1 percent
Washington — The sharpest rise in housing costs
in three decades pushed consumer prices up
another I percent in October, all but guaranteeing
the worst inflation rate lor a single year since 1945,
the government said yesterday.
Rapidly rising prices tor energy slowed signnic
antly during the month and lood price increases
showed a modest slowdown. But moderation in
those areas was onset by a 1.5 percent jump in
housing prices — the steepest monthly increase
since 1947, the Labor Department said.
So lar in 1979, consumer prices have risen 11
percent, and government economists predicted
inflation was certain to top 15 percent lor the yeai,
the highest rate since war-time wage and price
controls were lilted in 1945.
"You can say with certainty . . that the inflation
rate will be about I <.5 percent or higher lor the
year," said Theodore lorda, a senior economist a'
the Commerce Depaitment.
Torda and R. Robert Russel, director of the
Council on Wage and Price Stability, said they sec
no Tigris that inflation will slow in the coming

months. In fact, the rate could accelerate when
new consumer price figures are reported next
month, they said.
The high inflation rate has eaten into workers'
wages, and the Labor Department said the pur
chasing power of the average paycheck tell
another 1.1 percent in October. During the prior
12 months an average worker's purchasing power
tell an average 5.1 percent as wages tailed by a long
shot to keep pace with rising prices.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said
the average price across the country tor gasoline
topped $1 a gallon lor the tirst time in October, as
prices rose eight-tenths of a cent on the average
since September.
The seasonally adjusted increase in consumer
prices during October marked the 10th straight
month that the government 's index has recorded a
rise ol about 1 percent, to the frustration of Carter
administration inflation lighters.
The last time intlation in the United States has
been in double digits tor a lull year was 1974, when
a quadrupling of imported oil prices pushed the
rate to 12.2 percent. In 1946, prices jumped 18.2
percent, reflecting the lilting ol controls following
the end ol World War 11.

Kuwait to cut back oil production
Kuwait — An official ol the Kuwaiti government
said yesterday that Treasury Secretary C. William
Miller may have a difficult time persuading his
government to keep up its oil production.
The ottic lal, who did not want to be identitied,
said oil production is "decided by market consid
erations.''
"The market has a logic ol its own," he said. "It
we tail to appreciate it, we will he |List giving away
handouts."
Kuwaiti ottic lals have announced their intention
to cut back on the country's oil production, now
about 2.2 million barrels a day. However, they
have not said when the cutback would occur, or
how much is planned.
Estimates ol the amount ol a possible c utback
range trom 200,000 barrels a dav to 500,000, al
though diplomatic sources say the lesser ligure is
the most likely.
The oil minister ol Abu Dhabi, which produces
about 1.4 million barrels day, told Miller on
Monday his country will maintain maximum pro
duction, although a slight cutback is necessary lor
technical reasons.
Saude Arabian otncials eailier had declined to
commit themselves to continuing to produce at
their current level ol 9.5 million barrels a day. But
officials traveling with Miller were hopetul they
would decide to do this.
In each country he has visited, Miller has used
the same argument thai high production levels are
necessary to ottset the slowdown in Iranian oil
production. II other nations ( ul back signnicantly.
he argued, oil prices would soar again and could
push the world into a major recession.
Consumer prices up 1 percent
Washington — The sharpest rise in housing costs
in three decades pushed consumer prices up
another I percent in October, all but guaranteeing
the worst inflation rate lor a single year since 1945,
the government said yesterday.
Rapidly rising prices tor energy slowed signnic
antly during the month and lood price increases
showed a modest slowdown. But moderation in
those areas was onset by a 1.5 percent jump in
housing prices — the steepest monthly increase
since 1947, the Labor Department said.
So lar in 1979, consumer prices have risen 11
percent, and government economists predicted
inflation was certain to top 15 percent lor the yeai,
the highest rate since war-time wage and price
controls were lilted in 1945.
"You can say with certainty . . that the inflation
rate will be about I <.5 percent or higher lor the
year," said Theodore lorda, a senior economist a'
the Commerce Depaitment.
Torda and R. Robert Russel, director of the
Council on Wage and Price Stability, said they sec
no Tigris that inflation will slow in the coming

months. In fact, the rate could accelerate when
new consumer price figures are reported next
month, they said.
The high inflation rate has eaten into workers'
wages, and the Labor Department said the pur
chasing power of the average paycheck tell
another 1.1 percent in October. During the prior
12 months an average worker's purchasing power
tell an average 5.1 percent as wages tailed by a long
shot to keep pace with rising prices.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said
the average price across the country tor gasoline
topped $1 a gallon lor the tirst time in October, as
prices rose eight-tenths of a cent on the average
since September.
The seasonally adjusted increase in consumer
prices during October marked the 10th straight
month that the government 's index has recorded a
rise ol about 1 percent, to the frustration of Carter
administration inflation lighters.
The last time intlation in the United States has
been in double digits tor a lull year was 1974, when
a quadrupling of imported oil prices pushed the
rate to 12.2 percent. In 1946, prices jumped 18.2
percent, reflecting the lilting ol controls following
the end ol World War 11.

soon as dottors permit him, but added, "It's totally
