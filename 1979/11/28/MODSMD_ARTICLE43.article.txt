Yesterday's Daily article on
the videotape Working Against
Rape contained several inac
curacies. The tape was pro
duced at Instructional Media.
Not all ot the producers are
students. The tape, which dis
cusses rape in its socio
political context, was pro
duced by Laurie Foster, Allison
Brown, Sally Edwards and
Shiela Kiernan. The premiere
showing will be tomorrow at
7:30 p.m. in the large instruc
tional room at CERAb. The
Daily regrets the errors.
