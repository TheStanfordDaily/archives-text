# Captors fear attack, rig bomb in embassy
## 
### Associated Press 
Islamic militants said yesterday
they have rigged the U.S. Embassy to
blow up on command, and the Ira
nian armed forces went on alert as
Tehran seethed with rumors of an
impending U.S. attack and warnings
that American agents were plotting
to infiltrate the embassy.
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security
Council met for only 15 minutes yes
terday on the U.S.-Iranian crisis,
hearing pleas from Secretary-
General Kurt Waldheim and the
council president, and then ad
journed until Saturday.
President limmy Carter has
scheduled a news conference for to
night at 6 p.m. He is expected to in
sist anew that the United States will
not yield to "blackmail" by militants
still holding 49 Americans hostage at
the embassy.
In one of the shortest formal coun
cil meetings on record, Waldheim
called on the United States and Iran
"to avoid any action which could in
flame" the situation.
The Security Council president,
Ambassador Sergio Palacios de Viz
zio of Bolivia, repeated an appeal to
Iran he had made in the council's
behalf Nov. 9, asking for the release

of the hostages.
Iran's acting Foreign Minister
Abolhassan Bani Sadr is expected to
be in New York on Saturday to join in
the resumed debate.
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, in a Tehran radio broad
cast yesterday denounced U.S. pres
sure to have the council deal only
with the issue of the embassy hos
tages, seized by Islamic student
militants Nov. 4, and not with the
alleged crimes of the ousted Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
"There is talk these days that the
Security Council will meet to investi
gate the issue of the hostages, whose
spying activites have been proved by
our people," Khomeini said. "After
political and military maneuvers,
Carter has contended that the Coun
cil should only convene to deal with
this matter."
Khomeini, convinced the United
States has the council on its side,
rejected in advance any Council de
cision "dictated" by Washington.
The Iranian leader also raised anew
the prospect that the 49 American
hostages who have been held for 25
days will be put on trial as "spies."
The militants issued a statement
yesterday saying they had planted
mines throughout the embassy
compound and their supporters
should not try to enter the area.
The militants said they were espe
cially concerned about provocations
tomorrow and Friday, the emotional
Moslem holy days of Tasua and
Ashura, when devout Moslems here
whip or cut themselves to signify
their willingness to become martyrs.
Paratroopers were seen at
Tehran's Mehrabad Airport flying off
in U.S.-made transports to an un
known destination. Local newspap
ers said the Iranian navy "started de
fensive operations" in the Persian
Gulf, and the airspace over Qom,
Khomeini's headquarters city 120
miles south of Tehran, had been
closed.
The Carter administration indi
cated last week it might respond
militarily if any of the hostages are
harmed. A carrier task force headed
by the USS Midway has been in the
Arabian Sea south of Iran for almost
two weeks. Another, six-ship force,
led by the carrier Kitty Hawk, has
sailed into the Indian Ocean.
Carter said Tuesday that the honor
of America is at stake in the embassy
seizure and said the hostages have
been threatened at pistol point and
forced to make statements in which
they did not believe.
