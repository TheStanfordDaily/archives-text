# Battered wives endure anguish rather than leave violent mates
## 
### Martha Eickhof 
Bruce had beaten Mary in the past. She recalled sev
eral times when black eyes stared and swollen lips spoke
to her from the bathroom mirror: "Why? Why did he do
it? What did I do wrong?"
Mary had not asked herself those questions foralmost
a month. She had been separated from Bruce that long
and was in the process of getting a divorce — a civil
solution to Bruce's violent nature.
But it backfired. Bruce returned to their apartment
one afternoon. He crashed through the door waving a
.357 magnum pistol, fired five shots into Mary's head
and one into his own.
The above is an account of a murder-suicide that oc
curred in Palo Alto less than four months ago. The black
eyes, separation, weapon, shots and outcome have all
been verified. What follows is an examination of domes
tic violence in Palo Alto.
Not all domestic violence has death as its final out
come. But, many women are hurt badly enough by their
mates to end up in hospital emergency rooms.
Between 300 and 350 battered women are treated in
Santa Clara County emergency rooms each month, ac
cording to a recent study by the Women's Alliance in San
lose. Twelve to 16 of those are handled by the Medical
Center here.
"We might see three or four a week that we strongly
suspect or absolutely know have been battered," Dr.
George Sternbach, of the Med Center, said.
Some women will admit they have been beaten.
Others, hospital employees suspect, have injuries that
they often explain by saying they have fallen down stairs
or slipped while working in the garden.
"It takes a rather astute nurse to gently probe," said
Melinda Alves, assistant clinical nursing coordinator of
the emergency department here. "They are generally
more tearful and upset than they would be if they had
fallen down the stairs or slipped in the garden."
With the constraints of the emergency room it is "hard
to sit down and talk to them," Alves said.
"We give them options and resources when they are
here to aid them in the decision-making process," she
explained. "But we do not counsel them. I have put this
card in a number of pockets."
The card is a reference to the Midpeninsula Support
Network which is located in Mountain View. The net
work provides battered women with telephone crisis
intervention, peer support, temporary housing and in
formation and referral for medical care, legal assistance,
counseling and opportunities.

Seventeen percent of the network's clients, about two
each week, are from Palo Alto.
"They have different needs," said Alice Ito, a research
assistant at the network. "For some it is their second or
third time of being beaten and they are hoping that there
is going to be some change. For the majority it is not the
first time."
Battered women are not confined to a social class.
"They come from all areas of society," Alves said. "We
get women in here from Atherton as easy as from East
Palo Alto."
Regardless of social status, many of these women are
financially dependent on their mates.
"One thing we have found is if they leave the batterer
they go right down to the poverty level," Ito explained.
"Few have good paying jobs right at the time."
For this reason many women remain with mates who
have beaten them.
"There really may be no choice for herat the time," Ito
said. "Besides financial and economic constraints, there
are also social pressures to stay in the situation. Those
include maintaining the family unit, staying for the chil
dren's sake or the belief that being a woman means
being a wife and mother.
"There are also personal and emotional constraints.
Often the woman feels that she did something to de
serve it. Also, battering is only one aspect of the bat
terer. In other aspects he may be warm, loving and
caring. The woman may still love the guy. Most try to
make it work out and hope."
As a result the police often enter the situation.
"We respond to three or four family beefs a week,"
Palo Alto Police Officer Oscar Dewerk said.
The Palo Alto police have a policy of arriving at a family
disturbance no more than five minutes after they receive
a call. Not all, but many, involve husbands and wives.
"Usually both are very hostile," Dewerk said. "A lot of
times they do not even recognize their injuries. We do
everything we can to relax the tension in the air.
"We do not dissuade them from making assault and
battery charges. Although we do tell them what they can
expect. We assess each situation by itself.
"Palo Alto has been fairly responsive compared to
other law enforcement agencies," Ito said.
However, the police department only deals with one
aspect of domestic violence: that which admittedly calls
for outside help.
More than likely some battered women in Palo Alto do
not call the police, seek help at the Midpeninsula Sup
port Network or end up at Stanford's emergency room.

Often the woman feels that she did something to de
serve it. Also, battering is only one aspect of the bat
terer. In other aspects he may be warm, loving and
caring. The woman may still love the guy. Most try to
make it work out and hope."
As a result the police often enter the situation.
"We respond to three or four family beefs a week,"
Palo Alto Police Officer Oscar Dewerk said.
The Palo Alto police have a policy of arriving at a family
disturbance no more than five minutes after they receive
a call. Not all, but many, involve husbands and wives.
"Usually both are very hostile," Dewerk said. "A lot of
times they do not even recognize their injuries. We do
everything we can to relax the tension in the air.
"We do not dissuade them from making assault and
battery charges. Although we do tell them what they can
expect. We assess each situation by itself.
"Palo Alto has been fairly responsive compared to
other law enforcement agencies," Ito said.
However, the police department only deals with one
aspect of domestic violence: that which admittedly calls
for outside help.
More than likely some battered women in Palo Alto do
not call the police, seek help at the Midpeninsula Sup
port Network or end up at Stanford's emergency room.
Bruce had beaten Mary in the past. She recalled sev
eral times when black eyes stared and swollen lips spoke
to her from the bathroom mirror: "Why? Why did he do
it? What did I do wrong?"
Mary had not asked herself those questions foralmost
a month. She had been separated from Bruce that long
and was in the process of getting a divorce — a civil
solution to Bruce's violent nature.
But it backfired. Bruce returned to their apartment
one afternoon. He crashed through the door waving a
.357 magnum pistol, fired five shots into Mary's head
and one into his own.
The above is an account of a murder-suicide that oc
curred in Palo Alto less than four months ago. The black
eyes, separation, weapon, shots and outcome have all
been verified. What follows is an examination of domes
tic violence in Palo Alto.
Not all domestic violence has death as its final out
come. But, many women are hurt badly enough by their
mates to end up in hospital emergency rooms.
Between 300 and 350 battered women are treated in
Santa Clara County emergency rooms each month, ac
cording to a recent study by the Women's Alliance in San
lose. Twelve to 16 of those are handled by the Medical
Center here.
"We might see three or four a week that we strongly
suspect or absolutely know have been battered," Dr.
George Sternbach, of the Med Center, said.
Some women will admit they have been beaten.
Others, hospital employees suspect, have injuries that
they often explain by saying they have fallen down stairs
or slipped while working in the garden.
"It takes a rather astute nurse to gently probe," said
Melinda Alves, assistant clinical nursing coordinator of
the emergency department here. "They are generally
more tearful and upset than they would be if they had
fallen down the stairs or slipped in the garden."
With the constraints of the emergency room it is "hard
to sit down and talk to them," Alves said.
"We give them options and resources when they are
here to aid them in the decision-making process," she
explained. "But we do not counsel them. I have put this
card in a number of pockets."
The card is a reference to the Midpeninsula Support
Network which is located in Mountain View. The net
work provides battered women with telephone crisis
intervention, peer support, temporary housing and in
formation and referral for medical care, legal assistance,
counseling and opportunities.

Seventeen percent of the network's clients, about two
each week, are from Palo Alto.
"They have different needs," said Alice Ito, a research
assistant at the network. "For some it is their second or
third time of being beaten and they are hoping that there
is going to be some change. For the majority it is not the
first time."
Battered women are not confined to a social class.
"They come from all areas of society," Alves said. "We
get women in here from Atherton as easy as from East
Palo Alto."
Regardless of social status, many of these women are
financially dependent on their mates.
"One thing we have found is if they leave the batterer
they go right down to the poverty level," Ito explained.
"Few have good paying jobs right at the time."
For this reason many women remain with mates who
have beaten them.
"There really may be no choice for herat the time," Ito
said. "Besides financial and economic constraints, there
are also social pressures to stay in the situation. Those
include maintaining the family unit, staying for the chil
dren's sake or the belief that being a woman means
being a wife and mother.
