The new South African Labor
Kelorm is "strewn with de
ficiencies and ambiguities
which toreshadow problems to
come," Law Prolessor William
'Gould said to 70 persons at a
Bechtel International Center
luncheon last week.
But the legislation gives new
status to black labor unions
and is "bound to raise con
sciousness ot black workers in
the long run," strengthening
the black middleclass, he said.

The reform grants recogni
tion to black labor unions
which previously had no gov
ernment sanction and there
lore no right of collective bar
gaining. Membership on work
committees is also made open
to non-union laborers. The
committees function as plant
level monitors ot day-to-day
working conditions.
However, under the new
policy, newly registered un
ions must be approved by the
existing labor lederation, con

trolled by white unions, in
order to participate in collec
tive bargaining. Mixed unions
are ineligible tor registration.
Gould emphasized that the
new measures are the product
ot government insecurity in
the face of threats from
neighboring black nations and
tragile economic relations with
the West. There is no change
in the "political policies ot
apartheid and the relegation of
blacks to tribal homelands," he
said.
