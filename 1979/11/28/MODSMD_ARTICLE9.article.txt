should certainly welcome a

Angeles, and Margaret Hunter
of Atlanta, all in their 20s, said
they represented a newly or
ganized committee of "about a
dozen" American women mar
ried to Iranians.
Ms. Hunter, who has been
staying with an Iranian family
lor two months and plans to
return to the United States,
said, "I think (hat, in fact, many
Americans do support the ac

tivities ol the Iranian students
here.
"There are a lot ol people
that want the shah sent back to
Iran. They see him as the crim
inal that he is."
Last month ousted Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi left
his exile home in Mexico and
entered a New York hospital
where he is receiving medical
treatment. Iranian militants
seized the embassy Nov. 4,
demanding the United States
send the deposed ruler back to
Iran to stand trial.
None of the three women at

embassy was occupied. But
they said that they were con
vinced the U.S. government
and news media had misled the
American public about events
in Iran.
Mrs. Kazemi said the em
bassy was deeply involved in
the alleged crimes of the shah's
regime.
"The CIA was extremely

strong here," she said. "The
previous ambassadors, Wil
liam Sullivan and Richard
Helms, wtre both from the
CIA," she said.
Helms was director of the
Central Intelligence Agency
belore he was appointed am
bassador to Tehran. Sullivan,
his successor, was a career dip
lomat who served as ambas
sador to the Philippines and
Laos.
"The seizure itself is some
thing that expresses the de
termination of the,people . . .
and seems to me a very correct
and appropriate action," Mrs.
Kazemi said.
She was asked whether she
thought the hostages were
spies.
"I think certainly some ot
them are." She said if they are
tried and found to be spies, "it
should be brought out fully,
publicly, all of the tacts and
then I think that the Iranian
people should decide how to
deal with it."
