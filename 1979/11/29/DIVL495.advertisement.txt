Open Meeting on !
VA-21" REQUIREMENTS
The Committee on Research will hold an Open |
| Meeting on Friday, November 30th from noon j
? until 2:00 p.m. in the Forum Room of Meyer
Library to hear the views of any interested mem-
Ibers of the University community regarding the |
recommendations issued by the Stanford Study
Groups to implement federal government "A- 5
21" requirements governing cost principles ยง
applicable to all universities with federally-
sponsored grants and contracts. The revised |
requirements necessitate changes at Stanford |
in the methods used to charge, allocate, and |
recover both direct and indirect costs associated
with government-sponsored programs.
Significant changes will be required in the ways
we handle effort reporting, tuition remission for |
graduate student RA's and TA's, definitions of |
various kinds of sponsored projects, and |
facilities and space-related items.
Contact Assistant Provost, Patricia Devaney |
at 497-3763
for further information.
