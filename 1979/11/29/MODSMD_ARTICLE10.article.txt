# Lyman looms large as '70s president

Stanford University "is
not the length and shadow
of one man," President
Richard Lyman said, refer
ring to himself and his role
here, in an interview last
March.
But while that may be
true, Lyman has certainly
loomed large as the central
figure in the drama of the
'70s at Stanford.
It was only hours before
the freshman class of 1970
first set foot on campus that
the Board of Trustees ap
pointed Lyman as presi
dent. To say the succeeding
9'/4 years has brought
change to this institution is a
great understatement.
Lyman is the only top ad
ministrator who has stayed
in the same position to wit
ness and implement those
changes throughout the de
cade.
Lyman was no stranger to
the University when he was
appointed. Indeed he has
been here serving in one
capacity or another longer
than most of today's under-*
graduates have been alive.
Educated at Swarthmore
and Harvard, Lyman ac
cepted a tenured appoint
ment to the History Dept.
here in 1958 after several
teaching and research posi
tions around the world.
As a specialist in British
Labor history, he published
several books and papers
and developed his profes
sional reputation with these
as well as several profes
sional honors including
Guggenheim and Fulbright
fellowships and member
ship on the board of editors
of the journal of Modern
History.
After becoming a full pro
fessor here, Lyman began
his move into the administ
ration in 1964 when he
served as associate dean of
the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
In 1967 he assumed the
duties of vice president and
provost, the number-two
position here and chief of
the academic aspects of the

University.
Following the departure
of j.E. Wallace Sterling as
president, Kenneth Pitzer
began an embattled 19
months as president in 1969
and 1970 during which
Lyman was considered the
de facto leader of the Uni
versity.
Many considered his ap
pointment as president to
be a foregone conclusion,
despite the fact that the
search committee
examined hundreds of can
didates.
During his years as presi
dent, Lyman has been able
to de-emphasize the local
public relations role of the
president in favor of show
ing the University colors
around the country.
Lyman has said he spent
40 percent of his time on
local public relations early
in his administration, a fi
gure which is nowhere near
his public relations com
mitment now.
In fact, he points out that
he could not spend that
much time these days be
cause he is "a lot more in
volved off campus."
Another understatement.
Lyman presently holds at
least half a dozen positions
on the boards of national
educational organizations
or foundations, not to men
tion membership on a host
of other professional or
ganizations. Included in the
list: trustee of the Rockefel
ler Foundation, chairman of
the Commission on the
Humanities, and trustee of
the Carnegie Foundation
for the Advancement of
Teaching. Lyman also serves
as a director of the IBM
Corporation.
Indeed, Lyman's tenth
yearas president looksto be
another busy one. But de
spite his 1970 statement that
he would remain president
for only 10 years and despite
periodic speculation that he
is thinking of moving on,
Lyman insists he is having
fun here and has no such
plans, and that he intends to
continue to guide the Uni
versity through the chal
lenges of the 1980s.
