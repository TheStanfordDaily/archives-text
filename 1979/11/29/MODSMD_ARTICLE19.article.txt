# Interest in politics wanes despite bicentennial

Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto.
Meanwhile, newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst under
went physical and neurological
examinations at the Stanford
Medical Center. The tests were
later cited as evidence that
Hearst was emotionally fit to
stand trial.
In characteristic style, the
Band used the beleaguered
Hearst as the subject of what
some considered a particularly
distasteful halftime show on
Oct. 4. Football season also
witnessed a resurfacing of the
mascot controversy, an issue
which had been virtually dead
for three years. While some
students supported the return
of Chief Lightfoot, a campus
wide poll indicated the irreve
rent desire to install a mascot
reminiscent of the University's
founding father: the Robber
Barons.
The Big Game bonfire,
another source of burning de
bate, blazed in traditional fer
vor, but not sufficiently to in
spire the Cards to victory and a
possible Rose Bowl berth. The
very same team that subdued
USC and tied the Wolverines of
Michigan succumbed to Cal
48-15.
While involvement in off
campus issues may not have
been at an all-time high as evi
denced by a Daily headline,

"Careerism on the rise," stu
dents were by no means iso
lated from or unaware of the
world outside Stanford.
More than 700 students took
part in the National Day of Fast
ing in November. Nearly 1300
students and faculty members
helped raise $55,000 in hunger
relief aid through a 17-mile
walk-a-thon.
In May, 100 students
marched from White Plaza to
President Lyman's office to
present a petition urging the
University to adopt a Human
Rights Policy.
The militant radicalism of the
'60s and early 70s had abated.
Students sought more moder
ate avenues to implement
change, a fact which led anti
war activist and Chicago 7 de
fendant David Dellinger to call
out for a renewal of the reform
movements of the last decade,
when he spoke here Winter
Quarter.
There appeared to be a grow
ing number of students preoc
cupied with receiving a quality
education solely to acquire a
high-paying job or position of
stability. This inward-looking
trend, which some perceived

as self-centered callousness,
becomes more understanda
ble in the context of ever-rising
college expenses and the sharp
economic recession from
which the United States was
still licking its wounds.
The question of research vs.
teaching quality in determin
ing tenure continued to be a
much-discussed campus issue.
The battle reached a head
when, in late January, Asst.
Sociology Prof. Anne McMa
hon, winner of the 1974 Gores
Award for Excellence in Teach
ing, was denied tenure after
her department concluded she
had not published enough re
search material.
McMahon became the sec
ond Gores Award winner in a
year to be denied tenure. Early
in 1975, Asst. Religious Studies
Prof. Jerry Irish, winner of the
1972 award, was denied te
nure. A February 1976 Daily
column broached the question
"Gores Award: kiss of death?"
Although academic re
quirements had loosened at
most major American univer
sities toward the end of the
'60s, by the middle of the '70s
calls were heard from every

Halfway through the decade
apathy had replaced activism
as the buzzword of American
youth, but the Stanford 1975-76
school year provided solid evi
dence that generalizations
about student indifference
were riddled with exceptions.
Entering freshmen were
ushered into University life
with all the gentleness of an
Oklahoma tornado. Even be
fore their arrival, about 300
protesters calling themselves
"The People Not Profits Coali
tion" yelled jeers and cat-calls
as an estimated 10,000 onlook
ers heard President Gerald
Ford deliver a dedication
speech for the new Law School
facilities. Ford addressed the
responsibility of protecting
each private citizen's right to
privacy.
Two weeks later, on Oct. 10,
an ex-Georgia governor with a
lust for the presidency un
furled his proposal for a com
prehensive energy program,
jimmy Carter, at that time just
one of eight possible Democ
ratic contenders, made his re
marks before a small gathering
at Bowman Alumni House.
Between the visits by Carter
and Ford, the Stanford campus
was treated to speeches by
Walter Cronkite, Sen. Frank
Church (D-ldaho), William F.

Careerism gains steam and tenure question boils, but snow cools off campus

corner of academia demanding
a return to the basics, includ
ing a firm grounding in West
ern Civilization. In )anuary
1976, the Faculty Senate Com
mittee on the Reform and Re
newal of Undergraduate Edu
cation at Stanford adopted a
proposal that all future Stan
ford undergraduates be re
quired to take a three-quarter
Western Culture sequence.
On the morning of Feb. 6,
students awoke to a seldom
seen blanket of snow. For the
first time in 14 years and only

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1975-76

the third time since 1887, a halt
inch of snow covered the
ground here. By noon almost
all of the snow had melted, but
a two-hour mid-afternoon fall
briefly re-covered the area.
The burgeoning women's
movement began to display its
force on campus. The number
of courses in women's studies
jumped from 35 in 1972-73 to 65
in 1974-75. Activist Angela
Davis accepted an ASSU guest
professorship in spring quarter
to teach a class on feminism. In
her opening lecture, she told
students that true equality of
the sexes can only take place in
a socialist society.
The abuse and harassment to
which some women are sub
jected took on a frightening
immediacy after Psychiatry and
Psychology Prof. Karl Pribram
was placed on two years' prob
ation for his alleged October
beating of his former personal
secretary, Barbara Honegger.
Honegger later was awarded
$2250 in back pay.
A tragedy occurred on Oct.
26 when a third-year graduate
student in applied physics was
electrocuted while working on
a laser experiment in the High
Temperature Gasdynamics
Laboratory.
While tuition rose seven
percent to top the $4000 mark,
Sunday Flicks jumped 50 per
cent to 75 cents. The name of
the Black Student Cultural
Center changed from Olivo-
Magnolia to Ujamaa House.
Three new row houses were
completed, adding 558
Mayfield, American Studies
and La Casa Italiana to the draw
system. Herant Katchadourian,
creator of the human sexuality
course here, was appointed
vice-provost and dean of un
dergraduate studies.
The school year 1975-76 was
also the year of the bicenten
nial, the year of Karen Ann
Quinlan, who was ultimately
freed from her life-supporting
respirator only to continue
"living," as well as the year that
an earthquake in Guatemala
killed more than 3000 people.
For many at Stanford it will
long be remembered as the
year that foreshadowed Animal
House. The rowdy Delta Tau
Delta fraternity was suspended
for three years from using its
campus house. The suspen
sions stemmed from a May 19
incident when 15 Delts and 12
friends allegedly trashed four
other fraternity houses after a
bachelor party.
By the end of the school
year, national politics and the
upcoming presidential elec
tions dominated the news. As
Ford and Carter emerged as
the likely captors of their par
ties' nominations at the sum
mer conventions, students
looked forward to the cam
paign hub-bub that was to
reach an apex the following
November.

On the morning of Feb. b, 1976, the Stanford campus awoke as usual.
But for only the third time since 1887, there was something in the air.
And on the ground, too â€” a blanket of fresh snow.


Jimmy Who? traveled to Stanford in early October 1975. The ex
governor of Georgia campaigned in front of a small gathering at the
Bowman Alumni House.
