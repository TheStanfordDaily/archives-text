# 'Time is a jet plane ... moves too fast' — Bob Dylan

### 
This is the second issue of
The Stanford Daily Magazine —
a feature the Daily plans to
publish once a month in place
of the regular Daily. The
magazine format allows us to
spend more time on the theme
of the issue, and to delve a bit
more deeply into the stories
we present. In this issue, we
take a look at Stanford in the
1970s largely on information
gleaned from past Dailys and
some interviews with news
makers of the times. The
stories attempt to show a bit of
the flavor of the times by in
cluding information about the
lighter occurences here. In the
articles we have tried to pre
sent a balanced spread of
events to illustrate the year,
but space and the news re
corded then by the Daily
necessarily limit our articles.
In addition, the Magazine
features a sports and an enter
tainment essay looking at the
decade. There is also a look at
one of the most influential
people on the campus, and
one who has remained at Stan
ford the entire 10 years — Pres
ident Richard Lyman.
We hope this creative at
tempt will be successful.

The Roaring Twenties. The Depressing Thirties. The War Years.
Elvis and the days of the bobby socks. The Angry Sixties.
Americans have a passion for characterizing their decades into
neat little packages. But as popular as this pastime is, it is certainly
never very definitive. The experience of a decade, in truth, rests on
the experiences of millions of human beings, and the state of an
environment is only the product of all their actions, great and
small. Perhaps all that can be said conclusively at the end of a
decade is that, in those immortal words, "things are more like they
are now than they ever used to be."
In this edition of The Stanford Daily Magazine, we have tried
above all to give some sense, year by year, of what was going on at
Stanford in the 19705. We have reported the events and described
the personalities, but we have shied away from conclusions, in
terpretations and predictions about decades as a whole. These
tasks rest with you, the reader.
Thanks go to each of the writers, to the photographers whose
works were dug up out of old Daily files, to copy editors Sara
Lessley and Seth Zuckerman, to BH along with others in the
backshop, and to Monika Cuttman, my co-features editor.
Special thanks go to Jimmy Clanzer for assistance with the lay
out, to Gary Reyna for some beautiful graphics, and to Ron Lillejord
for constant encouragement.
The 70s are drawing to a close or, in Stanford terms, the '80s are
just one Dead Week away. As America struggles at this particular
time to discover its place in the world, students are trying equally
hard to discover theirs as economic realities and global uncertain
ties clash with charges of careerism and apathy.
Maybe it's not too idealistic to say that the '80s will provide a
clean slate for us to come to terms with the problems, to deal with
the questions, and to lead. When it comes time to look back at
Stanford in the 1980s, we can hope that the worst to be said will be
only that we tried to do this, and the best that we succeeded.
No one can tell what the future knows
You make the choice of how it goes.
This is it.
