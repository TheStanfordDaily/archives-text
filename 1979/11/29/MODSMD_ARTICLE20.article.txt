# South Africa, election flurry, rampant construction
## Grade change, apartheid debate with 294 Old Union sit-in arrests shake campus 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Academic year 1976-77 was a
year of surprises.
Students were smack in the
middle of the "Me Genera
tion," preoccupied with
books, learning, myriad ac
tivities and always themselves.
They were "able, ac
complished, attractive,
| energetic and diverse" in the
eyes of Dean of Admissions
i Fred Hargadon. In the view of

; many, they were using Stan-
I lord as a convenient vehicle
toward the fulfillment of lofty
aspirations. They were oppor
tunists, and they would be suc
cessful.
However, conventional in
tentions were to be foiled that
year. Despite efforts to climb a
smooth, rising trail, the cam
pus erupted in a turmoil of ac
tivism.
That winter and spring
jarred students awake and
made them face the belligerent
nature of reality. Five major
demonstrations were staged
which many participated in,
though many also ignored.
A harbinger of future unrest,
seven members of the Alliance
I for Radical Change picketed
outside a room containing a
Marine Corps recruiter on
campus |an. 12. Exactly three
months later, four Stanford
police forged a scuffled path

through 25 resisting students
foranother Marine recruiterat
tempting to make his appoint
ment at the Career Placement
and Planning Center. Both the
police and students decided
later not to file charges in the
incident.
Over 300 outraged students
assembled outside President
Richard Lyman's office on Val
entine's Day to voice their dis
content with the decision re
ndered in Bakke. Over a bul-

Ihorn, Lyman assauged them,
"The Bakke case, if simply sus
tained on the same basis that
the California Supreme Court
used, will put us all in deep
trouble."
But that was not the only
trouble to afflict Lyman that
month. This was the year of
student awareness of Univer
sity investment policy
throughout the country.
Stanford possessed 3000
shares of stock in the ).P. Ste
vens Corporation, the nation's
second-largest manufacturer
and a multinational textile firm.
Stevens had been found guilty
of 15 National Labor Relations
Act violations and had lost 11
appeals. None of its 44,000
employees was covered by
union contract.
Vice President for Business
and Finance Robert Au
gsburger ordered a University
abstention by proxy on a

shareholder resolution requir
ing Stevens to reveal its
employment policy. On Feb.
12, following a noon rally at
White Plaza, 60 students held a
sit-in in Augsburger's office in
Encina Hall to denounce his ac
tion. The group adjourned
after more than an hour and a
half when Provost William Mil
ler made the decision to evict
them, and Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington
threatened arrest.
The Board of Trustees voted
unanimously to abstain from
proxy votes concerning the
South African investments of
five major corporations in
which the University held
stock. Students greeted that
consensus movement with a
week of protest starting May 2.
Ironically, on the afternoon
of May 3, before Ronald
Reagan was to speak in Bishop
Auditorium, 450 de
monstrators gathered outside
Lyman's Quad office to de
mand a reversal of the Board's
decision.
Then, Stanford came into na
tional prominence when a re
cord 294 students were ar
rested May 9 for participating
in a 16-hour sit-in at Old Union.
Over 450 supporters outside
chanted "Apartheid means
profit, Stanford won't stop it,"
as police led the offending pro
testers away. All 294 were later
arraigned in Palo Alto Munici
pal Court.
The autumn of '76 was in
fused with that invigorating
phenomenon — elections.
Former student body president
and draft evader David Harris
debated incumbent Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
frequently in their Congres
sional race. Carter and Ford
bumper stickers appeared on
notebooks and cars. Cesar
Chavez of the United Farm
Workers spoke in Memorial
Auditorium, urging the pas
sage of Proposition 14, the
Farmworkers' Free Election
Law (the measure failed).
On the home front, ASSU
Senate elections were

mocked. The Chaparral's
Hammer and Coffin slate
swept to victory and pro
ceeded to laugh at student
government throughout the
rest of the year. When Palo Alto
levied harsh measures on mas
sage parlors, ASSU Sen. |on
Barth sponsored a bill to open
a massage parlor on campus.
Later, Financial Manager Chris
Mathe barely survived a Senate
attempt to impeach him.
The Flonor Code was for-

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1976-77

mally reviewed and revised,
and Western Civilization and
foreign language requirements
were considered. Provost Mil
ler changed a student's grade
for the first time in University
history when he overruled
Chemistry Prof. William Bon
ner after a 13-month battle.
Over 170 pre-meds petitioned
for improvements in the
chemistry series.
In a nati.onal survey, the
Graduate School of Business
and the School of Education
received No. 1 rankings. Stan
ford had a Rhodes scholar,
senior Dan Barker, and a Nobel
Prizewinner, Physics Prof. Bur
ton Richter. Physics Prof. Wil
liam Fairbanks reported signs
of the existence of the sub
atomic particle, the quark.

The erection of Albers Wall
in front of the Physics Tank was
approved, much to the delight
of Art Prof. Albert Elsen and
much to the dismay of many
physics majors and other skep
tics of modern art.
Students were entertained
by swine flu shots and their
fainting recipients, the Harlem
Globetrotters, Herbie Han
cock, Doonesbury author Gary
Trudeau, Buddy Hackett, blues
singer Bonnie Raitt and gonzo
writer Hunter Thompson.
While Richard Nixon told
David Frost that "Presidents
should be above the law,"
Stanford was shackled. United
Stanford Employees (USE),
tenuously agreeing to a new
contract after numerous strike
threats, took the University to
task and to court several times.
In sports, football coach Jack
Christiansen couldn't choose
between Mike Cordova and
Guy Benjamin at quarterback
and subsequently lost his job
though the team nipped Cal,
27-24 in the Big Game across
the Bay.
The tennis team and sopho
more Matt Mitchell won NCAA
titles.
Students came back after
that rollercoaster year and still
do. In autumn 1976, Hargadon
had asserted, "If I were able to
do it all over again, I'd like to
start college again with the
class of 1980 at Stanford."


Some 294 students were arrested on May 9, 1977 for participating in

throughout the country.
Stanford possessed 3000
shares of stock in the ).P. Ste
vens Corporation, the nation's
second-largest manufacturer
and a multinational textile firm.
Stevens had been found guilty
of 15 National Labor Relations
Act violations and had lost 11
appeals. None of its 44,000
employees was covered by
union contract.
Vice President for Business
and Finance Robert Au
gsburger ordered a University
abstention by proxy on a

shareholder resolution requir
ing Stevens to reveal its
employment policy. On Feb.
12, following a noon rally at
White Plaza, 60 students held a
sit-in in Augsburger's office in
Encina Hall to denounce his ac
tion. The group adjourned
after more than an hour and a
half when Provost William Mil
ler made the decision to evict
them, and Director of Public
Safety Marvin Herrington
threatened arrest.
The Board of Trustees voted
unanimously to abstain from
proxy votes concerning the
South African investments of
five major corporations in
which the University held
stock. Students greeted that
consensus movement with a
week of protest starting May 2.
Ironically, on the afternoon
of May 3, before Ronald
Reagan was to speak in Bishop
Auditorium, 450 de
monstrators gathered outside
Lyman's Quad office to de
mand a reversal of the Board's
decision.
Then, Stanford came into na
tional prominence when a re
cord 294 students were ar
rested May 9 for participating
in a 16-hour sit-in at Old Union.
Over 450 supporters outside
chanted "Apartheid means
profit, Stanford won't stop it,"
as police led the offending pro
testers away. All 294 were later
arraigned in Palo Alto Munici
pal Court.
The autumn of '76 was in
fused with that invigorating
phenomenon — elections.
Former student body president
and draft evader David Harris
debated incumbent Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
frequently in their Congres
sional race. Carter and Ford
bumper stickers appeared on
notebooks and cars. Cesar
Chavez of the United Farm
Workers spoke in Memorial
Auditorium, urging the pas
sage of Proposition 14, the
Farmworkers' Free Election
Law (the measure failed).
On the home front, ASSU
Senate elections were

mocked. The Chaparral's
Hammer and Coffin slate
swept to victory and pro
ceeded to laugh at student
government throughout the
rest of the year. When Palo Alto
levied harsh measures on mas
sage parlors, ASSU Sen. |on
Barth sponsored a bill to open
a massage parlor on campus.
Later, Financial Manager Chris
Mathe barely survived a Senate
attempt to impeach him.
The Flonor Code was for-

foreign language requirements
were considered. Provost Mil

for the first time in University
history when he overruled
Chemistry Prof. William Bon

Over 170 pre-meds petitioned
for improvements in the
chemistry series.
In a nati.onal survey, the
Graduate School of Business
and the School of Education
received No. 1 rankings. Stan
ford had a Rhodes scholar,
senior Dan Barker, and a Nobel
Prizewinner, Physics Prof. Bur

of the existence of the sub
atomic particle, the quark.

The erection of Albers Wall
in front of the Physics Tank was
approved, much to the delight
of Art Prof. Albert Elsen and
much to the dismay of many
physics majors and other skep
tics of modern art.
Students were entertained
by swine flu shots and their
fainting recipients, the Harlem
Globetrotters, Herbie Han
cock, Doonesbury author Gary
Trudeau, Buddy Hackett, blues
singer Bonnie Raitt and gonzo
writer Hunter Thompson.
While Richard Nixon told
David Frost that "Presidents
should be above the law,"
Stanford was shackled. United
Stanford Employees (USE),
tenuously agreeing to a new
contract after numerous strike
threats, took the University to
task and to court several times.
In sports, football coach Jack
Christiansen couldn't choose
between Mike Cordova and
Guy Benjamin at quarterback
and subsequently lost his job
though the team nipped Cal,
27-24 in the Big Game across
the Bay.
The tennis team and sopho

titles.
Students came back after
that rollercoaster year and still
do. In autumn 1976, Hargadon
had asserted, "If I were able to
do it all over again, I'd like to
start college again with the
class of 1980 at Stanford."


Some 294 students were arrested on May 9, 1977 for participating in
an apartheid protest at Old Union. All 294 were later arraigned in Palo
Alto Municipal Court.


Admissions Dean Fred Hargadon, here for all of the '70s, told the
incoming freshman class in 1976, "If I were able to do it all over again,
I'd like to start college with the class,of 1980 at Stanford." If the class
could have done it to begin with, they probably would have admitted
him.
Academic year 1976-77 was a
year of surprises.
Students were smack in the
middle of the "Me Genera
tion," preoccupied with
books, learning, myriad ac
tivities and always themselves.
They were "able, ac
complished, attractive,
| energetic and diverse" in the
eyes of Dean of Admissions
i Fred Hargadon. In the view of

; many, they were using Stan-
I lord as a convenient vehicle
toward the fulfillment of lofty
aspirations. They were oppor
tunists, and they would be suc
cessful.
However, conventional in
tentions were to be foiled that
year. Despite efforts to climb a
smooth, rising trail, the cam
pus erupted in a turmoil of ac
tivism.
That winter and spring
jarred students awake and
made them face the belligerent
nature of reality. Five major
demonstrations were staged
which many participated in,
though many also ignored.
A harbinger of future unrest,
seven members of the Alliance
I for Radical Change picketed
outside a room containing a
Marine Corps recruiter on
campus |an. 12. Exactly three
months later, four Stanford
police forged a scuffled path

through 25 resisting students
foranother Marine recruiterat
tempting to make his appoint
ment at the Career Placement
and Planning Center. Both the
police and students decided
later not to file charges in the
incident.
Over 300 outraged students
assembled outside President
Richard Lyman's office on Val
entine's Day to voice their dis
content with the decision re
ndered in Bakke. Over a bul-

Ihorn, Lyman assauged them,
"The Bakke case, if simply sus
tained on the same basis that
the California Supreme Court
used, will put us all in deep
trouble."
But that was not the only

Law (the measure failed).
On the home front, ASSU

Students came back after
that rollercoaster year and still
do. In autumn 1976, Hargadon

do it all over again, I'd like to
start college again with the
class of 1980 at Stanford."


Some 294 students were arrested on May 9, 1977 for participating in
an apartheid protest at Old Union. All 294 were later arraigned in Palo
Alto Municipal Court.


Admissions Dean Fred Hargadon, here for all of the '70s, told the
incoming freshman class in 1976, "If I were able to do it all over again,
I'd like to start college with the class,of 1980 at Stanford." If the class
could have done it to begin with, they probably would have admitted
him.
