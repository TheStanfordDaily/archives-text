# Sorority rush replaces the faltering rush to protest
## Anti-apartheid violence declines, but issue still hot 
### jill Liscom 
Compared to the student
protests over apartheid in
South Africa which took place
the previous year, 1977-78 was
a calm year in which the pen
dulum continued to swing
back in a conservative direc
tion.
Although University invest
ment in companies supporting
apartheid practices was still a
controversial issue, much of
the fervor had subsided, and
there was no new major issue
calling for unified student pro
test to take its place.
While the last of the Old
Union sit-in defendants were
making their final pleas and
continuing to fight for Univer
sity divestiture, events starting
a more conservative trend
were also taking place.
Among these were the first
sorority rush here since 1944,
the decision to replace the
coed Androgyny House after
only one year with a Germart
Studies theme house, ASSU
Senate scandals, and the deci
sion to reinstate a Western
Civilization requirement.
It was also the year of two
important Supreme Court de
cisions — the Daily lost its case
against police search proce

dures and Allan Bakke won the
right of admission to medical
school, although the legiti
macy of minority admissions
policies was confirmed.
On the lighter side, 1977-78
was the year when the drought
ended, and Lake Lagunita was
filled for the first time in three

years. It was also the year when
La Casa Italiana opened its
"Pizzeria" on campus, and
Toyon Hall produced the
Rocky Horror Show.
In sports, Stanford com
pleted a successful football

season ending with a 21-14 vic
tory over Louisiana State at the
Sun Bowl, the men's tennis
team won the NCAA title with
freshman John McEnroe win
ning the NCAA men's singles
title before turning pro.
When the year began, ques
tions that had been raised by

the Old Union sit-in particip
ants and the Stanford Commit
tee on Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) about University
investment in South Africa
were still unanswered.
Throughout the year, SCRIP
members demanded action
and answers from the Univer
sity. But although rallies and
demonstrations continued,
both University administrators
and SCRIP members recog
nized that campus-wide in
volvement was declining.
Although many of the indi
vidual SCRIP actions seemed
unsuccessful, overall they had
some influence in University
investment decisions and stu
dent opinion on the issue.
Robert Rosenzweig, Vice
President of Public Affairs, said
he felt the trustees' voting
change could be indirectly at
tributed to the student move
ment. ,
According to SCRIP spokes
person Maggie Goud, al
though the number of protes
ters decreased, "the issue this
year is much more concerted
and thoughtful, but much less
emotional. But in no way is it a
dying issue."

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1977-78

Throughout the year, SCRIP
was aided and supported by
the ASSU Senate, which was
dominated by a 14-member
Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) slate. SOC de
scribed itself as a coalition of
progressive, feminist, labor
and Third World groups.
A major issue at the begin
ning of the year was the ad hoc
Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR), which the
trustees had formed the previ
ous spring in response to stu
dent demands made at the sit
in.
In the fall, SCRIP recom
mended that the CIR be ex
panded to include two
employees, one trustee and
one administrator.
At the December meeting,
trustees agreed to expand
Clß's membership, but also
adopted new CIR guidelines


Although not marked by the tensions and arrests of the year before,
student demonstrations continued in 1977-78 against apartheid and
against University investment in companies doing business with South
Africa.
