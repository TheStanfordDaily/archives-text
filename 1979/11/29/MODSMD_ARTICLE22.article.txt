# Sorority rush replaces the faltering rush to protest
## Anti-apartheid violence declines, but issue still hot 
### jill Liscom 
Compared to the student
protests over apartheid in
South Africa which took place
the previous year, 1977-78 was
a calm year in which the pen
dulum continued to swing
back in a conservative direc
tion.
Although University invest
ment in companies supporting
apartheid practices was still a
controversial issue, much of
the fervor had subsided, and
there was no new major issue
calling for unified student pro
test to take its place.
While the last of the Old
Union sit-in defendants were
making their final pleas and
continuing to fight for Univer
sity divestiture, events starting
a more conservative trend
were also taking place.
Among these were the first
sorority rush here since 1944,
the decision to replace the
coed Androgyny House after
only one year with a Germart
Studies theme house, ASSU
Senate scandals, and the deci
sion to reinstate a Western
Civilization requirement.
It was also the year of two
important Supreme Court de
cisions — the Daily lost its case
against police search proce

dures and Allan Bakke won the
right of admission to medical
school, although the legiti
macy of minority admissions
policies was confirmed.
On the lighter side, 1977-78
was the year when the drought
ended, and Lake Lagunita was
filled for the first time in three

years. It was also the year when
La Casa Italiana opened its
"Pizzeria" on campus, and
Toyon Hall produced the
Rocky Horror Show.
In sports, Stanford com
pleted a successful football

season ending with a 21-14 vic
tory over Louisiana State at the
Sun Bowl, the men's tennis
team won the NCAA title with
freshman John McEnroe win
ning the NCAA men's singles
title before turning pro.
When the year began, ques
tions that had been raised by

the Old Union sit-in particip
ants and the Stanford Commit
tee on Responsible Investment
Policy (SCRIP) about University
investment in South Africa
were still unanswered.
Throughout the year, SCRIP
members demanded action
and answers from the Univer
sity. But although rallies and
demonstrations continued,
both University administrators
and SCRIP members recog
nized that campus-wide in
volvement was declining.
Although many of the indi
vidual SCRIP actions seemed
unsuccessful, overall they had
some influence in University
investment decisions and stu
dent opinion on the issue.
Robert Rosenzweig, Vice
President of Public Affairs, said
he felt the trustees' voting
change could be indirectly at
tributed to the student move
ment. ,
According to SCRIP spokes
person Maggie Goud, al
though the number of protes
ters decreased, "the issue this
year is much more concerted
and thoughtful, but much less
emotional. But in no way is it a
dying issue."

Throughout the year, SCRIP
was aided and supported by
the ASSU Senate, which was
dominated by a 14-member
Stanford Organizing Commit
tee (SOC) slate. SOC de
scribed itself as a coalition of
progressive, feminist, labor
and Third World groups.
A major issue at the begin
ning of the year was the ad hoc
Commission on Investment
Responsibility (CIR), which the
trustees had formed the previ
ous spring in response to stu
dent demands made at the sit
in.
In the fall, SCRIP recom
mended that the CIR be ex
panded to include two
employees, one trustee and
one administrator.
At the December meeting,
trustees agreed to expand
Clß's membership, but also
adopted new CIR guidelines


Although not marked by the tensions and arrests of the year before,
student demonstrations continued in 1977-78 against apartheid and
against University investment in companies doing business with South
Africa.
which Council of Presidents
(COP) member Anne Henkels
claimed would "totally subor
dinate social responsibility to
the maximization of profit"
and would be "most definitely
a method for pigeon-holing
criticism' on University in
vestment policy.
Objecting strongly, the
ASSU Nominations Committee
refused to nominate students
to serve on the commission.
I he University, however, over
rode the ASSU and randomly
chose 12 students, who then
used a self-selection process to
select the three student CIR
members.
the ASSU Senate was in
volved in a controversy of its
own over campaign proce
dures. During the campaign, a
conservative slate of candi
dates had distributed fliers at
tacking the SOC *tste. In re
sponse, the SOC candidates
inserted a flier counter
attacking its critics into the
Daily. The ASSU elections
commissioner began an inves
tigation of the incidents and
charges that some candidates
had exceeded the $50 spend
ing limit.
After the election, 23
senators were cited for cam
paign irregularities; however,

it was still undetermined what
action would be taken. A re
solution was proposed to es
tablish an independent Elec
tions Review Board (ERB) to in
vestigate the charges. The se
nate first refused to set up an
ERB, then the next day re
versed itself when petitions
were circulated to recall those
senators who voted against
ERB.
On Nov. 10, the five
member ERB announced its
decisions — it disqualified two
senators, suspended another

for one quarter, censured
three senators and re
primanded 12 others.
The senate also aroused con
troversy when it voted to triple
the senate discretionary fund
from $1500 to $4500 and then
allocated $1700 of that fund to
the SOC Disorientation Week.
Although all non-SOC senators
present voted against giving so
much money to one event,
they were outnumbered.
However, after petitions to
override the senate decision
began circulating, the SOC
slate compromised by reduc
ing the amount to $1000.
While the ASSU Senate,
SCRIP and the CI R opposed the
trustees on investment issues,
the board faced increasing
pressure from more conserva
tive factions to lift its 33-year
old ban on sororities. After
tabling the issue at two earlier
meetings, the board voted in
December to rescind the ban.
Soon afterward, Alpha Phi
pledged 13 women, becoming
the first sorority to reappear.
Other national sororities also
began holding informational
meetings and cultivating in
terest. By April, there were six
national sororities participat
ing in the first rush here since
1944. By the end of rush, the
number of women in sororities
had increased to about 250.
Sororities were not the only
tradition renewed that year.
The Faculty Senate voted to
reinstate the Western Civiliza
tion requirement, setting up a
two-year experimental period
in which a pilot Western Cul
ture course would be offered
to students voluntarily.
The 1977-78 school year was

both the beginning and the
end tor the Androgyny House,
which had been approved as a
theme house to explore sex
roles and socially-manifested
sex characteristics. During the
year, the residents renamed
the house after Simone de
Beauvoir, a 20th-century
feminist author, and the theme
became more feminist than
androgynous.
In March, the University
notified the residents that the
house would be replaced by a
German studies theme house,
saying there had been "a lack
of coherence and specificity"
in planning for the academic
program that year.
In mid-August, Mathematics
Prof. Karl deLeeuw was found
murdered in his office. Theo
dore Streleski, 42, a graduate

student whom deLeeuw had
advised, turned himself in and
was later convicted of the mur
der. Streleski is now serving an
eight-year sentence for the kil
ling.
At the end of the school year,
the Supreme Court handed
down two major decisions
within the same month.
The first of these came as a
major blow to the Daily as well
as newspapers nationwide. In
the case, titled The Stanford
Daily vs. Zurcher, the court
ruled 5-3 that a newspaper's of
fices may be searched by
police wielding a search war
rant, even if none of its
employees is suspected of a
crime.
Two lower federal courts had
declared the search in violation
of First Amendment free press

| protections and Fourth!
Amendment prohibitions
I against unreasonable searches '
| and seizures.
Later in June, the Supreme
Court ruled 5-4 in favor of Allan ,
Bakke, and ordered the UC-
Davis medical school to admit
Bakke, claiming he had suf- ■
fered illegal discrimination be
cause he is white. The court
also said, however, that race
can be taken into account in
future admissions programs.
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon commented, "While
ruling out quotas, which Stan
ford has not used, it apparently i
allows us to continue to take
the background of students
into account in our attempts to
bring together a diverse, but
.able, student body.

"Grease" in the spring.
