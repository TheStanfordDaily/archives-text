# World crises threaten to drown out campus issues
## Bottle ban, CRAP, floods, changes in command 
### Sara Lessley David Frank 
The campus wasn't silent in
1978 and 1979, but the news
here was all too frequently
obscured by the sometimes
| numbing events of the outside
! world.
In the early fall, a PSA jet col
lided with a small plane in the
; skies over San Diego, resulting
in more than 150 deaths in the
then-worst plane disaster in
U.S. history. (Later in the
spring, a DC-10crashed shortly
after takeoff from O'Hare air
port in Chicago, killing more
than274persons.) Then, just 34
days after his election to the
chair of St. Peter, Pope john
Paul I died, and elected to fill
the pontiff's seat was 58-year
old Polish Cardinal Karol Woj
tyla, the first non-Italian in 455
years to lead the 700 million
member church.
On campus, the bottle ban,
clamped on an unwitting stu
dent body during the summer,
went into effect at the first

football games. Ingenious stu
dents devised ways to circum
vent the prohibition against br
inging alcohol, cans or bottles
into the stadium — liquor
found its way into the stands in
plastic bags and even false
wheelchair bottoms.

In an ironic twist, candidates
for the ASSU Senate ran for
positions that were in danger
of elimination — as the result
of a proposal colorfully
entitled CRAP —the Commit
tee to Retire Aspiring Politicos.
CRAP failed, and the senate
lived to make headlines by of
fering the late Zulfiker Ali
Bhutto, past president and
prime minister of Pakistan, a

guest professorship here in an
attempt to save the con
demned man's life. But pro
tests from Pakistani students
here and others caused these
-1 nate to retract its offer. Bhutto
was later hanged by the Pakis
tani government.
Other headlines were made
when the senate voted to send
an ASSU task force to Golden,
Colo, to investigate the al
legedly unfair labor practices
of the Adolph Coors Co., paid
for by Coors. The ASSU had a
number of substantial dealings
with Coors.
The libraries were plagued
by water problems. In early
November a water main break
caused more than $1 million
damage to books in Meyer Lib
rary basement. About 40,000
books, including rare copies
dating back to the 17th cen
tury, were soaked. Less than
seven months later, a sprinkler
pipe in the new $12 million
Green Library addition spilled


Andrew Young was the 1979 commencement speaker, and he urged
graduates to break down barriers to world communication. By the
summer's end he would resign his post as U.N. ambassador.
thousands of gallons of water
on the carpet, causing more
than $250,000 in damage to the
new carpeting and fixtures.
More than a year after the
first mishap, the waterlogged
books were still being restored
! — a long process that involved
j initially freeze-drying the
! tomes to avoid mold and mil
dew, then drying them out in a
sophisticated vacuum origi
nally used to test Apollo moon
rovers.
In mid-November, the out
side world intruded rudely on
the campus. University issues
| were suddenly dwarfed by ap
jpalling news from a little
jknown country in South
| America. Some 900 bodies of
I members of a California sect
called the People's Temple
were found, victims of an ap
parent mass suicide-murder.
Also killed were five members
of an American fact-finding
team, including Rep. Leo

Ryan of San Mateo and three
newsmen.
Little more than one week la
ter, before the shock of Jones
town had time to wear off, San
Francisco Mayor George Mos
cone and Harvey Milk, the first
openly-homosexual super
visor, were assassinated at city

hall by disturbed former
supervisor Dan White.
The country followed the
news from San Francisco, and
commented on the bizarre, er
ratic events that emanated
from this area.
Outspoken local Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
caused another stir with his
proposal to reinstate a prog
ram resembling the draft. His
national service plan for 18-
year-olds was designed to raise
the caliber of recruits for the

all-volunteer army." McClos
key's proposal sparked the ire
of a number of people, espe
cially minority students irri
tated by the congressman's
remarks on the "dangers" of
the all-black army many
hypothesized would form if
voluntary enlistment con
tinued. During an on-campus
debate, a group of black and
Chicano students interrupted
the congressman to stage a
brief skit as their bitter reply to
McCloskey's plan.
The draft debate continued
to burn into the warm spring.
Students Against Conscription
(SAC) distributed anti-draft
petitions and organized anti
draft rallies in White Plaza
featuring speakers such as
Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg, on
campus for the quarter as a
guest professor, railed against
the draft, declaring in a drama
tic reference to the cyanide
laced punch used at Jones
town, that "signing up for that
draft is like signing up for the
Kool-Aid in Guyana."
Ellsberg was also active in the
anti-nuclear movement; he
was arrested in Colorado dur
ing a protest march at a nuclear
weapons plant following the
Three Mile Island accident.
The March accident helped
galvanize the campus into a
number of anti-nuclear ac
tivities.
Other campus speakers in
cluded Dennis Banks, a leader
in the Native American move
ment, who taught a course
here on the Native Americans'
future. Angela Davis spoke
about civil and women's
rights; lane Fonda spoke in
support of political and
economic change; and at
commencement, U.N. Ambas
sador Andrew Young asked
graduates to break down bar
riers to world communication.
Other voices were raised in
anguish over the 8.9 percent
tuition hike which raised the

c st of one year here to a hefty
$7950.
Cost may have played some
role in the trend that revealed a
slow decline of minority
graduate student enrollment,
but the figures also showed an
encouraging, steadily increas
ing, minority undergraduate
enrollment.
In the spring, the board of
trustees reversed its past posi
tion and voted to support a
shareholder resolution to
force a major U.S. bank, Wells
Fargo, to halt new loans and
renewal of old loans to the
apartheid regime in South Af
rica.
Also in the spring, Mountain
View computer researcher
Charles Hansen announced
locally his plan for an H-bomb
design contest to protest the
action taken by government
lawyers to block publication of
an article on the H-bomb
which was to appear in The
Progressive magazine. Hansen
played a significant role in the
government's abandonment of
the case.
Last year also saw a brisk tur
nover in administrative and
coaching jobs. Arjay Miller, for
10 years the dean of the top
ranked graduate school of bus
iness, announced his resigna
tion. William Miller stepped
down as provost and vice
president to take a graduate
school of business professor
ship. And Arthur Coladarci res
igned as dean of the top-rated
graduate school of education.
The flurry of changing com
mands did restore a familiar
face — Donald Kennedy. A
former biology professor here,
Kennedy had departed for
Washington at the start of
)immy Carter's administration
to become Commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administra
tion. After Miller's resignation,
Kennedy accepted the oppor
tunity to return as the new Uni
versity provost.

Rumors that President
Richard Lyman was one of
seven leading candidates for
the presidency of the Ford
Foundation floated through
the campus, causing Lyman to
issue a carefully-worded
statement to the effect that he
couldn't say whether he would
take a job he had not been of
fered. In fact it wasn't, and
Lyman stayed in Building 10.
A big newcomer was former
University of Pennsylvania ath
letic director Andy Geiger,
who replaced outgoing )oe
Ruetz as athletic director here.
Later in the year, Geiger's
popularity rose dramatically
when he lifted the unwieldly
stadium bottle ban.
The football team ended a
strong season in the Houston
Astrodome, beating Georgia
25-22 on a fourth-quarter Steve
Dils to Ken Margerum
touchdown pass for the
Bluebonnet Bowl title.
The men's water polo team
also had an outstanding finish;
it edged arch-rival Cal 7-6 to
win the NCAA championship.
Other headlines were made
when the Incomparable Leland
Stanford junior University
Marching Band elected Megan
Evans, the first female drum
major ever, and History Prof.
Donald Fehrenbacher won a
Pulitzer Prize for his book on
the Dred Scott case. The Elec
tion Review Board report was
finally issued, still advocating
senate reform, but making few
waves on campus.
During the summer of 1979,
the campus witnessed a bitter
labor-management dispute.
The conflict began in early Au
gust, following the firing of the
entire staff of the Tresidder
Union Coffee House.
The Coffee House workers
issue rubbed off on other cam
pus employees. Late in August,
the clerical workers met to
consider unionizing.
