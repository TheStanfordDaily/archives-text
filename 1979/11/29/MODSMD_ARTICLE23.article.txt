# World crises threaten to drown out campus issues
## Bottle ban, CRAP, floods, changes in command

The campus wasn't silent in
1978 and 1979, but the news
here was all too frequently
obscured by the sometimes
| numbing events of the outside
! world.
In the early fall, a PSA jet col
lided with a small plane in the
; skies over San Diego, resulting
in more than 150 deaths in the
then-worst plane disaster in
U.S. history. (Later in the
spring, a DC-10crashed shortly
after takeoff from O'Hare air
port in Chicago, killing more
than274persons.) Then, just 34
days after his election to the
chair of St. Peter, Pope john
Paul I died, and elected to fill
the pontiff's seat was 58-year
old Polish Cardinal Karol Woj
tyla, the first non-Italian in 455
years to lead the 700 million
member church.
On campus, the bottle ban,
clamped on an unwitting stu
dent body during the summer,
went into effect at the first

football games. Ingenious stu
dents devised ways to circum
vent the prohibition against br
inging alcohol, cans or bottles
into the stadium — liquor
found its way into the stands in
plastic bags and even false
wheelchair bottoms.

In an ironic twist, candidates
for the ASSU Senate ran for
positions that were in danger
of elimination — as the result
of a proposal colorfully
entitled CRAP —the Commit
tee to Retire Aspiring Politicos.
CRAP failed, and the senate
lived to make headlines by of
fering the late Zulfiker Ali
Bhutto, past president and
prime minister of Pakistan, a

guest professorship here in an
attempt to save the con
demned man's life. But pro
tests from Pakistani students
here and others caused these
-1 nate to retract its offer. Bhutto
was later hanged by the Pakis
tani government.
Other headlines were made
when the senate voted to send
an ASSU task force to Golden,
Colo, to investigate the al
legedly unfair labor practices
of the Adolph Coors Co., paid
for by Coors. The ASSU had a
number of substantial dealings
with Coors.
The libraries were plagued
by water problems. In early
November a water main break
caused more than $1 million
damage to books in Meyer Lib
rary basement. About 40,000
books, including rare copies
dating back to the 17th cen
tury, were soaked. Less than
seven months later, a sprinkler
pipe in the new $12 million
Green Library addition spilled


Andrew Young was the 1979 commencement speaker, and he urged
graduates to break down barriers to world communication. By the
summer's end he would resign his post as U.N. ambassador.
