# A 						decade of art in the market
## Cynical kids, boring old bankers and miracles Entertainment 
### Ron Lillejord 
If you grew up on music and
movies, the '70s were often a
frustrating experience. Not an
emotionally desperate frustra
tion, but an almost more in
sidious unfulfillment.
You always felt that you were
missing something, that every
thing happened before the
early part of the decade. The
Beatles broke up, Dylan and
the Stones seemed to be past
it, fewer movies were made
and those that were popular
were the '30s and '40s action
pictures, especially the ones
starring Bogart. Woodstock
was available only in movie
form, and that just wasn't the
same.
For a time, nothing seemed
to be filling the void; music
and movies just weren't doing
anything for you anymore.
Movie attendance, despite the
occasional big hit, was still in a
pronounced recession and
album sales were dropping
slightly. For the pessimist, a
dangerous nostalgia — the
kind that cripples — often took
hold. What follows is one re
formed pessimist's all-too
sketchy observations.
Pessimism was to some de
gree understandable. Taken as
a whole, it's easy to view this
rapidly ending decade as a
period dominated by glitter,
soul-less pomp and completely
talentless, media-created stars
and as a time when the empti
ness of weary excess, long the
province of Hollywood, was
socialized throughout Ameri
can popular arts.
The biggest feature in this
march toward mediocrity has
been the increasing impor
tance of the businessman in
popular art. There's no appa
rent conspiracy here, and the
shift has been gradual, not
sudden, but in the '70s the
consumer has become further
and further removed from the
artist, and both groups have a
diminished impact on the sys
tem as a whole.
The tyrant kings, the War
ners and the Goldwyns, who,
despite their shortcomings,
gave American entertainment
its uniquely vulgar life and
energy, have been replaced by
efficient, profit-minded corpo
rate executives and bankers.
There is a degree of inevita

bility to this process. In
movies, the advent of televi
sion led to a desperate movie
industry push to pull people
from the box to the box office.
Costs spiraled, and by the end
of the '60s, the famous backlots
were either sold, used for TV
series or guided tours. The
crochety old moguls were
largely dead and most of the
movie companies were owned
by conglomerates whose
primary interests lay outside
the entertainment field. And in
music, the market developed
too rapidly for the small com
panies that sprang up in the
'50s and '60s. They couldn't
support themselves with three
or four artists and consolida
tion became unavoidable. At
present, five or six companies,
all subsidiaries of larger com
panies, dominate the music
industry.
As costs and the pressures to
produce commercial succes
ses have increased, the trend
has been toward taking fewer
chances with a smaller number
of projects. Ideas often get ig-

nored, and the mutations take
the form of greatest hits pac
kages, sequels and groups
made to order, like the Village
People or Kiss.
Entertainment has primarily
become a business calculation
based upon demographic sur
veys and other statistics. Even
before a creative product hits
the market, artists must con
vince executives and/or ban
kers that their ideas are profit
able. In a simplistic but illustra
tive sense, artists must sell
themselves to those who con
trol the purse strings.
It is a situation fraught with
the dangers of self-destructive
compromise. Groups are sup
posed to work in a particular
formula and write songs with

"hooks." Movie scripts are
supposed to have "broad ap
peal" and have "bankable"
stars.
In such a system, creative
success — going all the way —
on terms that are even close to
the artist's original aims is
miraculous.
In early '70s rock, miracles
were hard to come by; rock's
innocence and anger had
largely dissipated — both in
the performers and in the lis
teners. Revolution and peace
and love on earth weren't hap
pening despite the music —
the beguiling hope that drove
much of '60s rock wasn't com
ing true. Rock, always a way
not to escape, but to dance all
over your problems, didn't
even manage to do that as the
music became more tired,
more formulaic, more cynical.
Jet-setting occupied much of
the older, more established
bands' time, and elitism tram
pled over dreams. "Glitter
rock" took hold, "soft rock''
became increasingly popular
and later "new wave" attemp
ted to fill the vacuum left by the
sagging older bands.
All three phases roll off the
tongue nicely, but all are mis
nomers. Regardless of its qual
ity, the music of James Taylor
and other "soft rockers" owes
more to the pop sounds of 1950
than it does to Elvis or Buddy
Holly.
"Glitter rock" is all style and
very little substance. Elton
John, Kiss and a host of others
with lesser impact gave us
flashiness but no heart, no

guts. The platinum phenome
non Kiss almost defies descrip
tion — try perversely sexy
wind-up dolls with metallic
parts for insides.
But "new wave" is the most
misleading phrase. The music
isn't new; it's largely a throw
back to driving, mid-'6os (and
earlier) rock.
An extremely diverse
number of artists, from The
Clash to Nick Lowe and (as
tonishingly) The Knack are
lumped under the term
"wave," which gives the
often-vibrant music of the late
'70s a false and extremely mis
leading coherence.

But certainly the music of
The Clash, the Sex Pistols,
Graham Parker, Elvis Costello
and other supposed "punks"
and/or "new wavers" has be
come a force to which a
heretofore sleeping industry
has had to respond. The chal
lenge they've presented ap
pears to have revitalized older
artists like Neil Young and The
Who. Disco too attempted to

inject some life into the then
tepid scene, but like most orig
inally black music forms, disco
was subjected to the formula
exploitation of the predomin
antly white music industry and
gradually lost both its energy
and momentum.
Another strong force in to
day's far more active music
scene is unquestionably Bruce
Springsteen. Springsteen's
music feels likean aural history
of the '50s and '60s, encompas
sing the raw '50s sound of
Eddie Cochran, Presley and
Holly, English heavy metal,
rhythm and blues, even folk.
Having survived a near
career-ending bout with coun
terproductive publicity and a
sweeping lawsuit, Springsteen
has now taken control of his
career and manages every as
pect of it.
Springsteen has paid the
price for his uncompromising
stand, but he's always been
able to sustain himself through
his incredible live perfor
mances. Springsteen and the
superb E Street Band give per
formances that are truly
miraculous; rock may have lost
its innocence, but artists like
Springsteen, Bob Seger and
Tom Petty and others prove
that as long as you believe,
perhaps naively, in your
dreams, rock certainly isn't
dead.
Even the most gloomy ob
server would have to acknow
ledge that American movies
made at least relative gains in
the '70s. The emergence of

energetic, almost frighteningly
talented young directors such
as Francis Ford Coppola, Ste
ven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese
and George Lucas more than
anything else fueled American
film's resurgence.
With 1972's The Godfather,
Coppola almost singlehan
dedly revived a flagging indus
try. Variety, the movie trade
paper, literally spent months
discussing the movie's impact
on the business as a whole.
Today Coppola wields a pos
ition of considerable power
and can undertake projects of a
massive scale.
The anti-hero, "system is
bankrupt" movies, like the
Godfather pictures, clearly
were influenced by the Ameri
can experience in Vietnam and
later with Watergate. But
American movies didn't di
rectly deal with either (except
for the occasional anac
hronism like The Green Berets)
until the latter part of the de
cade with such movies as Com
ing Home, All the President's
Men and The Deer Hunter. But
by then the mood was different
— America wanted to put its
troubles behind it — and all

three movies, in varying de
grees (and with varying de
grees of success) emphasized
characters who, if they were
not heroic, were at least in
tended to be admirable. Only
Coppola, in his magnificent
Apocalypse Now, forced
America's post-Vietnam
and-Watergate disillusionment
to its logical extremes and con
fronted the audience with an
almost nihilistic vision,of man
kind.
In their movies, Spielberg
and Lucas share none of Cop
pola's cynicism. Both seem
ingly grew up on a toxic mix
ture of comic books, sci-fi thril
lers, old westerns and, in a
large dose, television. Like lit
tle boys with cameras, it's often
hard to discern a mind behind
the enthusiasm, but that isn't
the point.
Although theirquality varies,
there's definitely an infectious
genius infused in movies like
Jaws, American Graffiti, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,
and Star Wars. There's a vital,
pure enjoyment in seeing a
movie's visual "limits" pushed
this far out.

Certainly Woody Allen, and
Scorsese have to be included
in the list of artists who con
tinually attempt to wrench the
best out of themselves. With
each successive film, Allen par
ticularly has effectively given
more and more intensely per
sonal concerns mass appeal.
As the end of the decade ap
proaches, perhaps the now
"grown-up" kid can be cauti
ously optimistic. The system
hasn't changed, and it de
mands more from both ourse
lves and the artist. But despite
the constant battles this neces
sitates, such a situation is not
necessarily a harmful one.
The streets of fire that crea
tive people are compelled to
run through have forged
tougher, more resilient artists,
like Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas,
Springsteen and a wonderfully
sizeable number of others who
tenaciously refuse to go away.
If the enthusiasm of the fan is
still a viable emotion, it's up to
the kids who grew in this de
cade not to let the promise
presented by such '70s artists
fade away in the next decade.

Although theirquality varies,
there's definitely an infectious
genius infused in movies like
Jaws, American Graffiti, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,
and Star Wars. There's a vital,
pure enjoyment in seeing a
movie's visual "limits" pushed
this far out.

Certainly Woody Allen, and
Scorsese have to be included
in the list of artists who con
tinually attempt to wrench the
best out of themselves. With
each successive film, Allen par
ticularly has effectively given
more and more intensely per
sonal concerns mass appeal.
As the end of the decade ap
proaches, perhaps the now
"grown-up" kid can be cauti
ously optimistic. The system
hasn't changed, and it de
mands more from both ourse
lves and the artist. But despite
the constant battles this neces
sitates, such a situation is not
necessarily a harmful one.
The streets of fire that crea
tive people are compelled to
run through have forged
tougher, more resilient artists,
like Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas,
Springsteen and a wonderfully
sizeable number of others who
tenaciously refuse to go away.
If the enthusiasm of the fan is
still a viable emotion, it's up to
the kids who grew in this de
cade not to let the promise
presented by such '70s artists
fade away in the next decade.
If you grew up on music and
movies, the '70s were often a
frustrating experience. Not an
emotionally desperate frustra
tion, but an almost more in
sidious unfulfillment.
You always felt that you were
missing something, that every
thing happened before the
early part of the decade. The
Beatles broke up, Dylan and
the Stones seemed to be past
it, fewer movies were made
and those that were popular
were the '30s and '40s action
pictures, especially the ones
starring Bogart. Woodstock
was available only in movie
form, and that just wasn't the
same.
For a time, nothing seemed
to be filling the void; music
and movies just weren't doing
anything for you anymore.
Movie attendance, despite the
occasional big hit, was still in a
pronounced recession and
album sales were dropping
slightly. For the pessimist, a
dangerous nostalgia — the
kind that cripples — often took
hold. What follows is one re
formed pessimist's all-too
sketchy observations.
Pessimism was to some de
gree understandable. Taken as
a whole, it's easy to view this
rapidly ending decade as a
period dominated by glitter,
soul-less pomp and completely
talentless, media-created stars
and as a time when the empti
ness of weary excess, long the
province of Hollywood, was
socialized throughout Ameri
can popular arts.
The biggest feature in this
march toward mediocrity has
been the increasing impor
tance of the businessman in
popular art. There's no appa
rent conspiracy here, and the
shift has been gradual, not
sudden, but in the '70s the
consumer has become further
and further removed from the
artist, and both groups have a
diminished impact on the sys
tem as a whole.
The tyrant kings, the War
ners and the Goldwyns, who,
despite their shortcomings,
gave American entertainment
its uniquely vulgar life and
energy, have been replaced by
efficient, profit-minded corpo
rate executives and bankers.
There is a degree of inevita

bility to this process. In
movies, the advent of televi
sion led to a desperate movie
industry push to pull people
from the box to the box office.
Costs spiraled, and by the end
of the '60s, the famous backlots
were either sold, used for TV
series or guided tours. The
crochety old moguls were
largely dead and most of the
movie companies were owned
by conglomerates whose
primary interests lay outside
the entertainment field. And in
music, the market developed
too rapidly for the small com
panies that sprang up in the
'50s and '60s. They couldn't
support themselves with three
or four artists and consolida
tion became unavoidable. At
present, five or six companies,
all subsidiaries of larger com
panies, dominate the music
industry.
As costs and the pressures to
produce commercial succes
ses have increased, the trend
has been toward taking fewer
chances with a smaller number
of projects. Ideas often get ig-

nored, and the mutations take
the form of greatest hits pac
kages, sequels and groups
made to order, like the Village
People or Kiss.
Entertainment has primarily
become a business calculation
based upon demographic sur
veys and other statistics. Even
before a creative product hits
the market, artists must con
vince executives and/or ban
kers that their ideas are profit
able. In a simplistic but illustra
tive sense, artists must sell
themselves to those who con
trol the purse strings.
It is a situation fraught with
the dangers of self-destructive
compromise. Groups are sup
posed to work in a particular
formula and write songs with

"hooks." Movie scripts are
supposed to have "broad ap
peal" and have "bankable"
stars.
In such a system, creative
success — going all the way —
on terms that are even close to
the artist's original aims is
miraculous.
In early '70s rock, miracles
were hard to come by; rock's
innocence and anger had
largely dissipated — both in
the performers and in the lis
teners. Revolution and peace
and love on earth weren't hap
pening despite the music —
the beguiling hope that drove
much of '60s rock wasn't com
ing true. Rock, always a way
not to escape, but to dance all
over your problems, didn't
even manage to do that as the
music became more tired,
more formulaic, more cynical.
Jet-setting occupied much of
the older, more established
bands' time, and elitism tram
pled over dreams. "Glitter
rock" took hold, "soft rock''
became increasingly popular
and later "new wave" attemp
ted to fill the vacuum left by the
sagging older bands.
All three phases roll off the
tongue nicely, but all are mis
nomers. Regardless of its qual
ity, the music of James Taylor
and other "soft rockers" owes
more to the pop sounds of 1950
than it does to Elvis or Buddy
Holly.
"Glitter rock" is all style and
very little substance. Elton
John, Kiss and a host of others
with lesser impact gave us
flashiness but no heart, no

guts. The platinum phenome
non Kiss almost defies descrip
tion — try perversely sexy
wind-up dolls with metallic
parts for insides.
But "new wave" is the most
misleading phrase. The music
isn't new; it's largely a throw
back to driving, mid-'6os (and
earlier) rock.
An extremely diverse
number of artists, from The
Clash to Nick Lowe and (as
tonishingly) The Knack are
lumped under the term
"wave," which gives the
often-vibrant music of the late
'70s a false and extremely mis
leading coherence.

But certainly the music of
The Clash, the Sex Pistols,
Graham Parker, Elvis Costello
and other supposed "punks"
and/or "new wavers" has be
come a force to which a
heretofore sleeping industry
has had to respond. The chal
lenge they've presented ap
pears to have revitalized older
artists like Neil Young and The
Who. Disco too attempted to

inject some life into the then
tepid scene, but like most orig
inally black music forms, disco
was subjected to the formula
exploitation of the predomin
antly white music industry and
gradually lost both its energy
and momentum.
Another strong force in to
day's far more active music
scene is unquestionably Bruce
Springsteen. Springsteen's
music feels likean aural history
of the '50s and '60s, encompas
sing the raw '50s sound of
Eddie Cochran, Presley and
Holly, English heavy metal,
rhythm and blues, even folk.
Having survived a near
career-ending bout with coun
terproductive publicity and a
sweeping lawsuit, Springsteen
has now taken control of his
career and manages every as
pect of it.
Springsteen has paid the
price for his uncompromising
stand, but he's always been
able to sustain himself through
his incredible live perfor
mances. Springsteen and the
superb E Street Band give per
formances that are truly
miraculous; rock may have lost
its innocence, but artists like
Springsteen, Bob Seger and
Tom Petty and others prove
that as long as you believe,
perhaps naively, in your
dreams, rock certainly isn't
dead.
Even the most gloomy ob
server would have to acknow
ledge that American movies
made at least relative gains in
the '70s. The emergence of

energetic, almost frighteningly
talented young directors such
as Francis Ford Coppola, Ste
ven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese
and George Lucas more than
anything else fueled American
film's resurgence.
With 1972's The Godfather,
Coppola almost singlehan
dedly revived a flagging indus
try. Variety, the movie trade
paper, literally spent months
discussing the movie's impact
on the business as a whole.
Today Coppola wields a pos
ition of considerable power
and can undertake projects of a
massive scale.
The anti-hero, "system is
bankrupt" movies, like the
Godfather pictures, clearly
were influenced by the Ameri
can experience in Vietnam and
later with Watergate. But
American movies didn't di
rectly deal with either (except
for the occasional anac
hronism like The Green Berets)
until the latter part of the de
cade with such movies as Com
ing Home, All the President's
Men and The Deer Hunter. But
by then the mood was different
— America wanted to put its
troubles behind it — and all

three movies, in varying de
grees (and with varying de
grees of success) emphasized
characters who, if they were
not heroic, were at least in
tended to be admirable. Only
Coppola, in his magnificent
Apocalypse Now, forced
America's post-Vietnam
and-Watergate disillusionment
to its logical extremes and con
fronted the audience with an
almost nihilistic vision,of man
kind.
In their movies, Spielberg
and Lucas share none of Cop
pola's cynicism. Both seem
ingly grew up on a toxic mix
ture of comic books, sci-fi thril
lers, old westerns and, in a
large dose, television. Like lit
tle boys with cameras, it's often
hard to discern a mind behind
the enthusiasm, but that isn't

Godfather pictures, clearly
were influenced by the Ameri
can experience in Vietnam and
later with Watergate. But
American movies didn't di
rectly deal with either (except
for the occasional anac
hronism like The Green Berets)
until the latter part of the de
cade with such movies as Com
ing Home, All the President's
Men and The Deer Hunter. But
by then the mood was different
— America wanted to put its
troubles behind it — and all

three movies, in varying de
grees (and with varying de
grees of success) emphasized
characters who, if they were
not heroic, were at least in
tended to be admirable. Only
Coppola, in his magnificent
Apocalypse Now, forced
America's post-Vietnam
and-Watergate disillusionment
to its logical extremes and con
fronted the audience with an
almost nihilistic vision,of man
kind.
In their movies, Spielberg
and Lucas share none of Cop
pola's cynicism. Both seem
ingly grew up on a toxic mix
ture of comic books, sci-fi thril
lers, old westerns and, in a
large dose, television. Like lit
tle boys with cameras, it's often
hard to discern a mind behind
the enthusiasm, but that isn't
the point.
Although theirquality varies,
there's definitely an infectious
genius infused in movies like
Jaws, American Graffiti, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,
and Star Wars. There's a vital,
pure enjoyment in seeing a
movie's visual "limits" pushed
this far out.

Certainly Woody Allen, and
Scorsese have to be included
in the list of artists who con
tinually attempt to wrench the
best out of themselves. With
each successive film, Allen par
ticularly has effectively given
more and more intensely per
sonal concerns mass appeal.
As the end of the decade ap
proaches, perhaps the now
"grown-up" kid can be cauti
ously optimistic. The system
hasn't changed, and it de
mands more from both ourse
lves and the artist. But despite
the constant battles this neces
sitates, such a situation is not
necessarily a harmful one.
The streets of fire that crea
tive people are compelled to
run through have forged
tougher, more resilient artists,
like Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas,
Springsteen and a wonderfully
sizeable number of others who
tenaciously refuse to go away.
If the enthusiasm of the fan is
still a viable emotion, it's up to
the kids who grew in this de
cade not to let the promise
presented by such '70s artists
fade away in the next decade.
If you grew up on music and
movies, the '70s were often a
frustrating experience. Not an
emotionally desperate frustra
tion, but an almost more in
sidious unfulfillment.
You always felt that you were
missing something, that every
thing happened before the
early part of the decade. The
Beatles broke up, Dylan and
the Stones seemed to be past
it, fewer movies were made
and those that were popular
were the '30s and '40s action
pictures, especially the ones
starring Bogart. Woodstock
was available only in movie
form, and that just wasn't the
same.
For a time, nothing seemed
to be filling the void; music
and movies just weren't doing
anything for you anymore.
Movie attendance, despite the
occasional big hit, was still in a
pronounced recession and
album sales were dropping
slightly. For the pessimist, a
dangerous nostalgia — the
kind that cripples — often took
hold. What follows is one re
formed pessimist's all-too
sketchy observations.
Pessimism was to some de
gree understandable. Taken as
a whole, it's easy to view this
rapidly ending decade as a
period dominated by glitter,
soul-less pomp and completely
talentless, media-created stars
and as a time when the empti
ness of weary excess, long the
province of Hollywood, was
socialized throughout Ameri
can popular arts.
The biggest feature in this
march toward mediocrity has
been the increasing impor
tance of the businessman in
popular art. There's no appa
rent conspiracy here, and the
shift has been gradual, not
sudden, but in the '70s the
consumer has become further
and further removed from the
artist, and both groups have a
diminished impact on the sys
tem as a whole.
The tyrant kings, the War
ners and the Goldwyns, who,
despite their shortcomings,
gave American entertainment
its uniquely vulgar life and
energy, have been replaced by
efficient, profit-minded corpo
rate executives and bankers.
There is a degree of inevita

bility to this process. In
movies, the advent of televi
sion led to a desperate movie
industry push to pull people
from the box to the box office.
Costs spiraled, and by the end
of the '60s, the famous backlots
were either sold, used for TV
series or guided tours. The
crochety old moguls were
largely dead and most of the
movie companies were owned
by conglomerates whose
primary interests lay outside
the entertainment field. And in
music, the market developed
too rapidly for the small com
panies that sprang up in the
'50s and '60s. They couldn't
support themselves with three
or four artists and consolida
tion became unavoidable. At
present, five or six companies,
all subsidiaries of larger com
panies, dominate the music
industry.
As costs and the pressures to
produce commercial succes
ses have increased, the trend
has been toward taking fewer
chances with a smaller number
of projects. Ideas often get ig-

nored, and the mutations take
the form of greatest hits pac
kages, sequels and groups
made to order, like the Village
People or Kiss.
Entertainment has primarily
become a business calculation
based upon demographic sur
veys and other statistics. Even
before a creative product hits
the market, artists must con
vince executives and/or ban
kers that their ideas are profit
able. In a simplistic but illustra
tive sense, artists must sell
themselves to those who con
trol the purse strings.
It is a situation fraught with
the dangers of self-destructive
compromise. Groups are sup
posed to work in a particular
formula and write songs with

"hooks." Movie scripts are
supposed to have "broad ap
peal" and have "bankable"
stars.
In such a system, creative
success — going all the way —
on terms that are even close to
the artist's original aims is
miraculous.
In early '70s rock, miracles
were hard to come by; rock's
innocence and anger had
largely dissipated — both in
the performers and in the lis
teners. Revolution and peace
and love on earth weren't hap
pening despite the music —
the beguiling hope that drove
much of '60s rock wasn't com
ing true. Rock, always a way
not to escape, but to dance all
over your problems, didn't
even manage to do that as the
music became more tired,
more formulaic, more cynical.
Jet-setting occupied much of
the older, more established
bands' time, and elitism tram
pled over dreams. "Glitter
rock" took hold, "soft rock''
became increasingly popular
and later "new wave" attemp
ted to fill the vacuum left by the
sagging older bands.
All three phases roll off the
tongue nicely, but all are mis
nomers. Regardless of its qual
ity, the music of James Taylor
and other "soft rockers" owes
more to the pop sounds of 1950
than it does to Elvis or Buddy
Holly.
"Glitter rock" is all style and
very little substance. Elton
John, Kiss and a host of others
with lesser impact gave us
flashiness but no heart, no

guts. The platinum phenome
non Kiss almost defies descrip
tion — try perversely sexy
wind-up dolls with metallic
parts for insides.
But "new wave" is the most
misleading phrase. The music
isn't new; it's largely a throw
back to driving, mid-'6os (and
earlier) rock.
An extremely diverse
number of artists, from The
Clash to Nick Lowe and (as
tonishingly) The Knack are
lumped under the term
"wave," which gives the
often-vibrant music of the late
'70s a false and extremely mis
leading coherence.

But certainly the music of
The Clash, the Sex Pistols,
Graham Parker, Elvis Costello
and other supposed "punks"
and/or "new wavers" has be
come a force to which a
heretofore sleeping industry
has had to respond. The chal
lenge they've presented ap
pears to have revitalized older
artists like Neil Young and The
Who. Disco too attempted to

inject some life into the then
tepid scene, but like most orig
inally black music forms, disco
was subjected to the formula
exploitation of the predomin
antly white music industry and
gradually lost both its energy
and momentum.
Another strong force in to
day's far more active music
scene is unquestionably Bruce
Springsteen. Springsteen's
music feels likean aural history
of the '50s and '60s, encompas
sing the raw '50s sound of
Eddie Cochran, Presley and
Holly, English heavy metal,
rhythm and blues, even folk.
Having survived a near
career-ending bout with coun
terproductive publicity and a
sweeping lawsuit, Springsteen
has now taken control of his
career and manages every as
pect of it.
Springsteen has paid the
price for his uncompromising
stand, but he's always been
able to sustain himself through
his incredible live perfor
mances. Springsteen and the
superb E Street Band give per
formances that are truly
miraculous; rock may have lost
its innocence, but artists like
Springsteen, Bob Seger and
Tom Petty and others prove
that as long as you believe,
perhaps naively, in your
dreams, rock certainly isn't
dead.
Even the most gloomy ob
server would have to acknow
ledge that American movies
made at least relative gains in
the '70s. The emergence of

as Francis Ford Coppola, Ste

and George Lucas more than

film's resurgence.
With 1972's The Godfather,
Coppola almost singlehan

on the business as a whole.

Springsteen has paid the
price for his uncompromising
stand, but he's always been
able to sustain himself through
his incredible live perfor
mances. Springsteen and the
superb E Street Band give per
formances that are truly
miraculous; rock may have lost
its innocence, but artists like
Springsteen, Bob Seger and
Tom Petty and others prove
that as long as you believe,
perhaps naively, in your
dreams, rock certainly isn't
dead.
Even the most gloomy ob

the '70s. The emergence of

energetic, almost frighteningly
talented young directors such
as Francis Ford Coppola, Ste
ven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese
and George Lucas more than
anything else fueled American
film's resurgence.
With 1972's The Godfather,
Coppola almost singlehan
dedly revived a flagging indus
try. Variety, the movie trade
paper, literally spent months
discussing the movie's impact
on the business as a whole.
Today Coppola wields a pos
ition of considerable power
and can undertake projects of a
massive scale.
The anti-hero, "system is
bankrupt" movies, like the
Godfather pictures, clearly
were influenced by the Ameri
can experience in Vietnam and
later with Watergate. But
American movies didn't di
rectly deal with either (except
for the occasional anac
hronism like The Green Berets)
until the latter part of the de
cade with such movies as Com
ing Home, All the President's
Men and The Deer Hunter. But
by then the mood was different
— America wanted to put its
troubles behind it — and all

three movies, in varying de
grees (and with varying de
grees of success) emphasized
characters who, if they were
not heroic, were at least in
tended to be admirable. Only
Coppola, in his magnificent
Apocalypse Now, forced
America's post-Vietnam
and-Watergate disillusionment
to its logical extremes and con
fronted the audience with an
almost nihilistic vision,of man
kind.
In their movies, Spielberg
and Lucas share none of Cop
pola's cynicism. Both seem
ingly grew up on a toxic mix
ture of comic books, sci-fi thril
lers, old westerns and, in a
large dose, television. Like lit
tle boys with cameras, it's often
hard to discern a mind behind
the enthusiasm, but that isn't
the point.
Although theirquality varies,
there's definitely an infectious
genius infused in movies like
Jaws, American Graffiti, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,
and Star Wars. There's a vital,
pure enjoyment in seeing a
movie's visual "limits" pushed
this far out.

Certainly Woody Allen, and
Scorsese have to be included
in the list of artists who con
tinually attempt to wrench the
best out of themselves. With
each successive film, Allen par
ticularly has effectively given
more and more intensely per
sonal concerns mass appeal.
As the end of the decade ap
proaches, perhaps the now
"grown-up" kid can be cauti
ously optimistic. The system
hasn't changed, and it de
mands more from both ourse
lves and the artist. But despite
the constant battles this neces
sitates, such a situation is not
necessarily a harmful one.
The streets of fire that crea
tive people are compelled to
run through have forged
tougher, more resilient artists,
like Coppola, Spielberg, Lucas,
Springsteen and a wonderfully
sizeable number of others who
tenaciously refuse to go away.
If the enthusiasm of the fan is
still a viable emotion, it's up to
the kids who grew in this de
cade not to let the promise
presented by such '70s artists
fade away in the next decade.
