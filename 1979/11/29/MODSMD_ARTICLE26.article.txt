# Men, women, champion a decade of S.U. sports

| As the 1970s opened, Stan
ford's athletic department re
sembled a precocious young
boy about to enter adoles
cence. Like this boy, it had
given brief but not substantial
displays of its talents, and it
also had not paid much atten
tion to females.
Throughout this past de
cade, however, athletics here
has passed through its adoles
cent period smoothly and suc
cessfully.
With team and individual
championships, Stanford grew
to maturity in the world of col
legiate athletics. And with the
prodding of an insistent parent
(Title IX), the athletic depart
i rnent began to consider
I women as an integral rather
I than an incidental part of life.
An accurate measure of the
athletic maturity Stanford
reached in the 1970s is the total
| of seven national champion
i ships the Cardinals won.
I The lion's share of these ti
| ties were captured by the
j men's tennis team. Coach Die k
j Gould's netters topped the na
• lion four times during the de
j cade — in 1973, '74, '77and '78.
That last year was a special
one lor the Card tennis prog
ram, as coach Anne Gould's
women's team joined the men
as national champs, defeating
USC 5-4 tor the AIAW crown.
Besides tennis, the other
sport that flexed its collective
muscles considerably was
water polo. After amassing a
decent but uninspiring 55-44-2
overall record from 1970 to
1974, the poloists surged to a
20-6 finish in 1975.
The next year, under coach
Art Lambert, the Cards finished
19-1 and captured the NCAA
title with a 13-12 victory over
UCLA.
i Two years later Stanford
reached the pinnacle of water
I polo success: a 26-1-1 overall
' record, including a 7-6 triple-
I overtime triumph over defend
ing champ California in the
NCAA finals.
Side-by-side with these na
tional titles stands the bowl
game victories of Stanford's
football teams in the 70s.
The Cards compiled a
forgettable 46-51-3 record in
the 19605, but in 1970 ]im Plun
, kett and )ohn Ralston ushered
J in the excitement and excel
lence that has become charac
teristic of Stanford football.
Completing 191 passes for
j 2715 yards in Ralston's ingeni
ous offensive formations,
Plunkett won the Heisman
Trophy and led Stanford to a
9-3 record and a 27-17 Rose
Bowl victory over Ohio State.
In '71 the Cards repeated
, their successes of the previous
j year, again finishing 9-3, again
showcasing an outstanding
quarterback (Don Bunce) and
again winning the Rose Bowl,
this time 13-12 over Michigan
j on Rod Garcia's 31-yard field
goal with 12 seconds left in the
game.
Probably the most remarka
ble aspect ot the '71 Rose Bowl
; champs was not their usual
j high-powered offense, but
j their unyielding defense,
headed by the "Thunderchic
kens 1 — defensive linemen
Greg Sampson, Larry Butler,
J Pete Lazetich and Roger
Cowan. With the Thunder
chickens reducing the opposi
! tion to turkey leathers, Stan
ford allowed just 135 points in
12 games that vear.
The Cards were cropped out
ot the bowl picture until 1977

when quarterback Guy Benja
min, wide receivers Bill Kellar
and James Lofton, freshman
running back Darrin Nelson
and linebacker Cordy Cere
sino performed first-year head
coach Bill Walsh's biddings
impeccably.
Accepting a bid to the Sun
Bowl after burying Cal 21-3 in
the Big Game, 9-3 Stanford
triumphed over Louisiana State
24-14 on Dec. 31 in El Paso,
Texas.
Stanford had a rougher time
ot it in 1978, losing heartbreak
ing Pac-10 Conference deci
sions to UCLA, 27-26, and

Washington, 34-31, in con
secutive weeks.
However, the Cards were
impressive enough through
out the rest of the season to
earn a trip to the Bluebonnet
Bowl on New Year's Eve, where
fifth-year senior quarterback
Steve Dils and Ceresino paced
a come-from-behind 25-22 vic
tory. Stanford trailed 22-0 early
in the third quarter before
scoring all its points in a 6'j
minute span.
Other bright moments il
luminate the memories ol the
~(K: the 1974 Big Game, which
Stanford won 22-20 on Mike
Langford s last-second 50-vard
field goal; the 1976 Big Game,

which began with just-fired
head coach Jack Christiansen
being carried onto the field
and ended With Stanford win
ning 27-24 with under two mi
nutes left; the surge of the soc
cer team under coach Nelson
Lodge, from 9-9-2 in 1976 to
10-8-2 in 1977 to 16-6 in 1978 to
14-5-2 this year; and the

"Maples Miracle" of 1975,
when the Card men's basket
ballers knocked oft nationally
ranked UCLA, 64-60 and USC
67-66, in the same weekend.
In the middle of all the on
the-field activity, the Athletic
Department itself was steadily
changing. With the establish
ment of Title IX, the federal law
requiring colleges to provide
equal opportunities for wo
men's sports, Stanford merged
its men's and women's sports j
j programs under one depart
| ment in March of 1975.
Stanford, one of the first col
leges to make this change, wis
! able to add three new women -
1 varsity sports in following •

years: volleyball, cross country
and track and field.
The Cardinal Club was or
ganized to help raise scholar
ships for women athletes, just
as the immensely successful
Buck Club does for the men.
With the arrival of Andy
Geiger as athletic director in
lanuary 1979, Stanford athletics

has acquired a new look. In
creasing scholarships to im
prove the quality of the varsity
teams and improving facilities
for the student body are just
two of Ceiger's projects that
have begun this past year.
Whether male or female,
Stanford boasted a wealth of
standout performers in nearly
every varsity sport in the '70s.
First and toremost is Plun
kett, the 1970 Heisman Trophy
winner. The holder of Stanford
career records in total offense,
passing vardage, touchdown
passes, completions and at
tempts. Plunkett was named to
six national Mi-America team-,
that year.

Ed Schweitzer (14.1 lifetime
points-per-game average),
Mike Bratz (first-team all-Pac-8
in 1977), Wolte Perry (18.3 scor
ing average in 1978-79) and
Kimberly Belton (see for your
self what he can do this season)
have also reigned supreme on
the courts.
Maples Pavilion has been the
scene of the fine leaps and
bounds taken by basketball
players such as Claude Terry,
whose 1566 points from 1970-
'72 remain the Stanford career
scoring mark, and Rich Kelley,
the 7-0 center who collected a
Card-record 944 rebounds and
1412 points between 1973 and
1975.
Linebacker Jeff Siemon dup
licated Plunkett's feat by mak
ing six All-America teams the
following year. Besides
Siemon, other Card football
defensive greats include guard
Lazetich, ends Roger
St ill we 11, Pat Donovan and
Duncan McColl and linebacker
Ceresino, whose 174 tackles in
1977 set a single-season re
cord.
On offense, of course, Stan
lord has had more stars than
the Milky Way. Quarterbacks
Bunce, Mike Boryla, Guy Ben
jamin and Steve Dils all rose to
national prominence.
In women's cross country,
Anne Thrupp became the first
three-time All-America selec
tion, earning the honor from
1976 through 1978.
Steve Hug and Ted Marcy
provided Stanford with its
men's gymnastics highlights
for the '70s. Hug won the
NCAA individual all-around
championships from 1972-74
and the parallel bars crown in
1973 and '74, while Marcy mas
tered the pommel horse from
1974-76.
Swimmer Brian |ob, with five
NCAA breaststroke titles,
started a Stanford tradition in
that event that was continued
from 1973-76 by John
Hencken, winner of five more
NCAA breaststroke medals.
Valerie Lee and Linda Jezek,
winners of three individual
AIAW championships in 1977
and 1979 respectively,
achieved high honors for Stan
ford's women's swimmers.
Jezek was particularly impres
sive in the AIAW finals last
March, winning three
backstroke events in the 50,
100 and 200 meters, and setting
new American and AIAW
marks in the 50 and 200.
Tennis, maybe Stanford's
strongest sport, obviously had
more than its share of blue
chippers in the '70s.
Sandy Mayer (1972), John
Whitlinger (1974), Matt Mitch
ell (1977) and John McEnroe
(1978) all won NCAA singles ti
tles. Mayer also teamed with
Roscoe Tanner and Jim De
laney in 1972 and 1973, respec
tively, to win the doubles
championship, while Delaney
and Whitlinger combined for
the same title in 1974.
The Cards have a virtual lock
on the AIAW doubles crown.
Diane Morrison and Susie
Hagey won it in 1976 and 1977,
sisters Kathy and Barb Jordan
took it from teammates Morri
son and Hagey in 1978, and
Kathy Jordan and Alycia Moul
ton captured it this past sea
son. Kathy Jordan also climbed
to the top of the AIAW singles
ladder in 1979.
Ciolt, the other »"country
< lub sport, includes among its
70s alumni Tom Watson, a
three-time second-team All
'\merica here and now the Pro
fessional Golfers Association's
perennial leading money
winner.
