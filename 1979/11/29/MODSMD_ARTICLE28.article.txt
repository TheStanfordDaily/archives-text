1980 goals dismay Soviets
Moscow — Soviet leaders disclosed
yesterday they have toned down
economic goals for 1980. Their new
plan calls on citizens to tighten their
belts under a 4.5 percent growth rate
based in part on slack oil and grain
yields this year.
The overall growth rate for 1979 re
mains secret, but was originally
targeted for 5.7 percent. Soviet
economists say privately it will be about
4.2 percent.
Chief Soviet planner Nikolai
Baibakovsaid 1979 production fell short
of planned output for coal, mineral fer
tilizers, synthetic chemicals, paper,
non-ferrous metals and certain food
and consumer products.
Shah may return to Mexico
Mexico City — The Shah of Iran will
leave a New York hospital bed and fly
back to his luxurious retreat in Cuer
navaca within 10 days, his public rela
tions office said yesterday.
The question has arisen whether the
shah has a new visa after expiration this
month of his temporary tourist visa. A
Foreign Ministry source here said "no
decision has been made to give the
shah a visa and there has been no appli
cation.'' He added the government is
not opposed to granting Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi a new visa.
The source, who asked not to be
identified, said there was no indication
when the shah might return, but he ex
pected more information in the next
few days after the shah recovers from

an operation to remove a gallstone in
his bile duct. The shah is also suffering
from cancer of the lymph system.
Court deems search unjust
Washington — Police officers au
thorized to search a public place may
not search all persons who happen to
be there, the Supreme Court said yes
terday.
The justices, voting 6-3, struck down
an Illinois man's conviction for heroin
possession. They ruled that the drug
should not have been used as trial evi
dence because it was seized uncon
stitutionally.
When police officers investigating al
leged drug trafficking staged a raid on a
tavern in Aurora, 111., they decided to
search all patrons for concealed
weapons. Some heroin was found in
Ventura Vbarra's pants pocket, and he
was arrested.
Yesterday's ruling means Illinois au
thorities must free Ybarra or give him a
new trial in which the heroin will be
excluded as evidence.
"The search warrant. . . gave the of
ficers no authority whatever to invade
the constitutional protections posses
sed individually by the tavern's cus
tomers," Justice Potter Stewart wrote
for the court's majority.
INS reviews Iranian visas
Immigration officials said yesterday
at least 513 Iranian students in Califor
nia have irregularities in their visas
which could lead to deportation, but
some Iranians are seeking political

asylum here.
In Los Angeles and San Diego, fed
eral Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) officials said, some depor
tation hearings were underway, but no
actual deportations could be con
firmed.
Los Angeles INS acting district direc
tor Orville Charles said the proceed
ings were in accord with President
Jimmy Carter's order to expedite the
hearings on Iranian students after they
held demonstrations in the United
States supporting the takeover of the
U.S. Embassy in Iran.
Guerillas kidnap Gardner
San Salvador, El Salvador A group of
about 10 guerrillas, some armed with
submachine guns and pistols, kidnap
ped South African Ambassador Ar
chibald Gardner yesterday, police said.
Witnesses said the band grabbed
Gardner, 60, as he left his embassy and
forced him into a waiting car, which
sped away.
The ambassador lost one of his shoes
in front of the embassy, a witness said.
Police said no group had claimed re
sponsibility for the kidnapping and
they had no further details.
Gardner has spent five years in this
Central American country.
U.S. offers return passage
Beirut, Lebanon — Americans work
ing in Moslem nations appear to be in
no big rush to avail themselves of a free
ticket home, despite fervent anti-

American sentiment in several areas of
the Islamic world.
The State Department has offered
passage to the states for "non
essential" employees and their families
based in 11 Islamic countries. Some
U.S. companies followed suit because
of the U.S. Embassy seizure in Tehran
and the attack on the U.S. Embassy in
Islamabad, Pakistan, where two Ameri
cans were killed.
Almost 400 diplomatic personnel or
their families were evacuated from
Pakistan after the embassy attack, but
elsewhere in Moslem nations, while
Americans may be staying low-key,
they are not flocking to the airport.
"Everyone is going to sit tight, but if
they want to go we will pay the fare
home," said an official of an American
company in Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates.

1980 goals dismay Soviets
Moscow — Soviet leaders disclosed
yesterday they have toned down
economic goals for 1980. Their new
plan calls on citizens to tighten their
belts under a 4.5 percent growth rate
based in part on slack oil and grain
yields this year.
The overall growth rate for 1979 re
mains secret, but was originally
targeted for 5.7 percent. Soviet
economists say privately it will be about
4.2 percent.
Chief Soviet planner Nikolai
Baibakovsaid 1979 production fell short
of planned output for coal, mineral fer
tilizers, synthetic chemicals, paper,
non-ferrous metals and certain food
and consumer products.
Shah may return to Mexico
Mexico City — The Shah of Iran will
leave a New York hospital bed and fly
back to his luxurious retreat in Cuer
navaca within 10 days, his public rela
tions office said yesterday.
The question has arisen whether the
shah has a new visa after expiration this
month of his temporary tourist visa. A
Foreign Ministry source here said "no
decision has been made to give the
shah a visa and there has been no appli
cation.'' He added the government is
not opposed to granting Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi a new visa.
The source, who asked not to be
identified, said there was no indication
when the shah might return, but he ex
pected more information in the next
few days after the shah recovers from

an operation to remove a gallstone in
his bile duct. The shah is also suffering
from cancer of the lymph system.
Court deems search unjust
Washington — Police officers au
thorized to search a public place may
not search all persons who happen to
be there, the Supreme Court said yes
terday.
The justices, voting 6-3, struck down
an Illinois man's conviction for heroin
possession. They ruled that the drug
should not have been used as trial evi
dence because it was seized uncon
stitutionally.
When police officers investigating al
leged drug trafficking staged a raid on a
tavern in Aurora, 111., they decided to
search all patrons for concealed
weapons. Some heroin was found in
Ventura Vbarra's pants pocket, and he
was arrested.
Yesterday's ruling means Illinois au
thorities must free Ybarra or give him a
new trial in which the heroin will be
excluded as evidence.
"The search warrant. . . gave the of
ficers no authority whatever to invade
the constitutional protections posses
sed individually by the tavern's cus
tomers," Justice Potter Stewart wrote
for the court's majority.
INS reviews Iranian visas
Immigration officials said yesterday
at least 513 Iranian students in Califor
nia have irregularities in their visas
which could lead to deportation, but
some Iranians are seeking political

asylum here.
In Los Angeles and San Diego, fed
eral Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) officials said, some depor
tation hearings were underway, but no
actual deportations could be con
firmed.
Los Angeles INS acting district direc
tor Orville Charles said the proceed
ings were in accord with President
Jimmy Carter's order to expedite the
hearings on Iranian students after they
held demonstrations in the United
States supporting the takeover of the
U.S. Embassy in Iran.
Guerillas kidnap Gardner
San Salvador, El Salvador A group of
about 10 guerrillas, some armed with

forced him into a waiting car, which
sped away.
The ambassador lost one of his shoes

Police said no group had claimed re
sponsibility for the kidnapping and
they had no further details.

U.S. offers return passage
Beirut, Lebanon — Americans work
ing in Moslem nations appear to be in
no big rush to avail themselves of a free
ticket home, despite fervent anti-

American sentiment in several areas of
the Islamic world.
The State Department has offered
passage to the states for "non
essential" employees and their families
based in 11 Islamic countries. Some
U.S. companies followed suit because
of the U.S. Embassy seizure in Tehran
and the attack on the U.S. Embassy in
Islamabad, Pakistan, where two Ameri
cans were killed.
Almost 400 diplomatic personnel or
their families were evacuated from
Pakistan after the embassy attack, but
elsewhere in Moslem nations, while
Americans may be staying low-key,
they are not flocking to the airport.
"Everyone is going to sit tight, but if
they want to go we will pay the fare
home," said an official of an American
company in Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates.
