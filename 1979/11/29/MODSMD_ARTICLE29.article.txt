## Tuition rate to rise 12.5% 
### Mike Charlson 
Tuition, room and board
charges will rise to between
$8925 and $8965 next year, ac
cording to recommendations
the administration will make to
the Board of Trustees next
month.
Administrators will recom
mend a tuition increase of be
tween 12.5 and 13 percent and
a room and board increase of
between 11.8 and 12.3 percent,
the Daily has learned.
The recommendations will
be formally announced at a
briefing for the media and stu
dent leaders next week.
The Board of Trustees is
scheduled to consider the
issue at its meeting Dec. 10 and
11. Though approval is not as
sured, the trustees have not
turned down a recommenda

tion for a general tuition in
crease in recent years.
Tuition, now $5595 for a reg
ular three-quarter academic
year, is expected to rise to bet
ween $6294 and $6322. Over
this decade, then, tuition will
have risen 162 percent from the
1970-71 rate of $2400 per year.
Room and board charges,
now $2354, will probably rise to
about $2635.
Assuming the ranges, the
total cost of tuition, room and
board will rise between $976
and $1016. The overall cost in
creases will likely be between
12.3 and 12.8 percent.
Inflation is blamed for much
of the increases. It hits the Uni
versity from two sides, said
Raymond Bacchetti, vice pro
vost for budget and planning.
Inflation means that salaries,
which comprise 70 percent of
the University's operating
budget, must rise. Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance
William Massy said recently
that increased competition
from private industry for top
faculty and administration per
sonnel makes it more impor
tant than ever that University
salary levels be kept competi
tive.
All non-union employees of
the University received a 9 per
cent salary increase last Sept. 1.
In addition, inflation raises
other University costs. For
example,an 18 percent hike in
energy prices is forecast.
According to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the
Consumer Price Index rose
12.2 percent nationally over
the past year. In the Bay Area
prices rose 9 percent.
Edward Scoles, director of
Housing and Food Services
Management, said the increase
in room and board fees is
necessitated by three factors:
inflation, a concentrated major
repair program and a redefini
tion of how the housing system
must pay for University over
head costs.
Overhead costs, which in
clude items such as central
administration, grounds and
roads, will be reapportioned
under a new plan. The redefini
tion will cost the housing sys
tem between $550,000 and

$750,000, Scoles said.
This increase alone repre
sents one-third of the prop
osed room and board increase,
he added.
Inflation is taking its toll in
food and energy costs, he said.
Moreover, the University is in
volved in an intensive resi
dence repair program and is
trying to complete the project
before the opening of the
proposed new student hous
ing.
Meanwhile, admissions and
financial aids officials said they
have had no indications yet
that increasing costs are effect
ing the number of applicants,
or the rate of acceptance of of
fers of admission.
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon said he expects no
p-oblems as long as the finan
cial aids program rises propor
tionately with costs.
There is "no question" that
the financial aids program will
"continue to meet the de
monstrated need of all under
graduates," said Robert Huff,
director of financial aids.
Hargadon said the only way
there might be a problem is if
costs here rose a good deal
more than elsewhere.
Bacchetti said it is unclear
how much other major private
institutions will be charging
next year.
In the past, however, the
University has ended up com
parably priced with other
major private institutions.
Bacchetti added that even
with the increase, the latest
University long-range financial
forecast indicates that fiscal
1980-81 will be a "very con
strained year."
Beyond 1980-81, the forecast
is not particularly optimistic
either, he said. "Stanford is a
vital, active institution with ex
citing new ideas sitting in the
middle of an economy th<y is
not supporting higher educa
tion."
Indicating that this will mean
either less money for new
programs, or a reallocation of
funds already in the system, he
added, not as if we're try
ing to ride out a rainy day. The
climate has changed."
