# Carter denounces Iran
## Vows blackmail will not work 
### Associated Press 
President Jimmy Carter said
yesterday he is grimly resolved
to win the freedom of Ameri
can hostages in Iran, but he
warned the American people
that "our determination may
be even more sorely tried" in
days to come.
Carter also declared he is de
termined to win the release of
the hostages through peaceful
means, and said mob violence
and "international terrorism"
must not be allowed to spread.
"The harming of innocent
people is condemned by every
law of mankind and God," the
president told six foreign am
bassadors who presented their
diplomatic credentials at the
White House.
In a nationally televised
news conference, Carter
pledged that the United States
would never yield to blackmail.
And he said the takeover of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Is
lamic militants, "shocked the
civilized world."
"There is not a recognized
religious faith on Earth which
condones kidnapping," Carter
said. "There is no recognized
religious faith which condones
blackmail.
"There certainly is no religi
ous faith on Earth which con
dones the sustained abuse of
innocent people."
Carter told the nation the 49
hostages held at the U.S. Em
bassy are being kept "in inhu
man and degrading condi
tions."
The president said his ad
ministration "will persist in our
effor|s until every American
has been freed," and again
warned the Iranian govern
ment of "grave consequences"
if the American captives are
harmed.
At the same time, he made it
clear he was reserving strong
measures against Iran if the
hostages are harmed.
"The United States has other
options available to it. . . but I
think it would not be well ad
vised to discuss them."
He said he could not lay

down a deadline because to
threaten military action at this
point "might result in the harm
or death of the hostages."
In the meantime, both the
United States and Russia have
strenghtened their naval
forces in the Indian Ocean area
amid the continuing crises in
Iran.
Defense Department
spokesman Thomas Ross told
reporters Tuesday that the
81,000-ton U.S. aircraft carrier
Kitty Hawk and five other Navy
ships sailed into the Indian
Ocean from the South China
Sea over the weekend, increas
ing the U.S. fleet to 19 ships in
that area.
The Navy also sent some
mine-clearing helicopters from
the Atlantic fleet to the western
Pacific last week, presumably
to be in position to act if the
Iranians should try to block the
entrance to the Persian Gulf.
Meanwhile, Ross said the
Russian fleet in the Indian
Ocean has been increased
over the past week or so from
12 to 15 ships, about half of
them combat vessels.
Ross said 15 Soviet warships
"is not an abnormal number"
for the Indian Ocean area,
where the Russians often have
had up to 20 naval vessels
operating in the past.
In Iran yesterday, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini replaced
his acting foreign minister in
what appeared to be a
toughening of Iran's line in the
confrontation with the United
States. The Moslem militants
holding the U.S. Embassy said
Iran must not take part in a Un
ited Nations debate on the
crisis.
Abolhassan Bani Sadr was re
lieved of his foreign affairs post
and replaced by Revolutionary
Council member Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh after the embassy
militants denounced Bani
Sadr's plans to participate in a
meeting this weekend of the
U.N. Security Council on the
Iran situation.
In other developments yes
terday, Carter took full respon

sibility for admitting the de
posed shah of Iran for cancer
treatment. And he said the ex
ruler would decide when to
leave the United States.
Carter said the decision to
admit the shah was made
"without pressure from any
one," including former Secret
ary of State Henry Kissinger,
and that the medical treatment
the shah is receiving in a New
York hospital was necessary to
save his life.
"I have no regrets about it,
no apologies to make," Carter
said, "because it did help to
save a man's life and was com
patible with the principles of
our country."
Asked about Kissinger's
criticism of the administra
tion's policy toward Iran, Car
ter declared he would not get
involved in a debate with the
former secretary of state.
It was disclosed earlier that
Kissinger has agreed to curb
his statements about the way
the Carter administration is
handling the Iran crisis.
