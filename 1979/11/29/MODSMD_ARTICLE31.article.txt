Auckland, New Zealand (AP) â€” An Air New
Zealand DC-10 carrying 257 persons on an
adventurous flight to the bottom of the world
slammed into a volcano yesterday on the
ice-bound coast of Antarctica, apparently kil
ling all aboard. It was one of history's worst
air disasters.
The 237 passengers on the sightseeing
flight included 12 Americans, the airline said.
A Navy C-130 search plane from the U.S.
Antarctica base at McMurdo Sound spotted
the wreckage in the sunlit polar midnight
about 1500 feet up the slope of Mount
Erebus, a smoldering, 12,400-foot peak that is
one of the world's tallest active volcanos.
A swing around Erebus, on Ross Island off
the Antarctica coast 2000 miles south of New
Zealand, is part of the spectacular 11-hour air
tour.
"It looks as though it burned. No survivors
have been sighted. They are expecting a
complete fatality," said Navy spokesman

Petty Officer Mike Hatcher.
The harsh conditions of terrain, blowing
snow and tricky winds around the volcano
kept Navy helicopters from McMurdo, 30
miles away on Ross Island, from landing at
the crash site immediately. Hatcher said ef
forts were continuing to recover the bodies.
The cause of the crash was not known.
"The crew did not report any trouble in
their last radio contact," at 2:30 p.m., Air
New Zealand spokesman Chris Smith said.
The airline said 191 of the 237 passengers
were New Zealanders. Besides the Ameri
cans, the other foreigners were 24 Japanese,
7 Australians, 2 Britons and a Canadian.
I he identities of the victims, who included
20 crew members, were being withheld until
notification of next-of-kin, airline officials
said.
There were no immediate indications that
any structural problem was involved in the
crash.
