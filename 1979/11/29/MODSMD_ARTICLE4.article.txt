# The 						New Left can swing right back in force
## 'Business as usual is quite different,' the grip of morality relaxes, ROTC is offed 
### Seth Zuckerman 
There is no question, times
were different then. It's hard to
know where to start, chronicl
ing the changes, measuring
1969 and 1970 by the yardstick
of today. This year's freshmen
were eight or nine years old
then. How many remember
Biafra, Kent State, Angela Davis
or the showcase trial of the
Chicago 7?
Stanford was a different
place, too. Many of the build
ings had been trashed; win
dows broken so often the Uni
versity replaced the glass
panes with plywood.
Coed dorms, in their third
full year here, were becoming
the dominant mode, but the
both-sex living arrangements
were still a novelty beyond
Campus Drive, as shown by an
"expose" of coed living pub
lished in Look magazine a
week before school opened in
the fall of 1969. The article fo-

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1969-70

cused on sex at Lambda Nu, a
fraternity that had just gone
| coed.
The 40-member ASSU Senate
came into existence, replacing
the unwieldy 140-member
Legislature. Some 129 candi
dates ran for positions on the
i newly created governing body.
The Manzanita Trailer Park
was created to help alleviate
the housing shortage on a
"temporary" basis. The Center
I for Educational Research at
| Stanford (CERAS) was in the
planning stage and the human
biology program had just been
announced. Dean of Admis
sions Fred Hargadon was start
ing his first year, and there
were still more than twice as
many men as women in the
freshman class.
There may have been rumbl
i ings against the Indian being
used as the University mascot,
1 but ads in the Daily still por-
J trayed the typical student here
as a native American with
j feather in headband.
Stanford beat Cal by just one
| point in what was called "not
one of the greatest Big Games
of all time," a 29-28 win. The
Daily reported that even en
thusiasm for the Big Came
bonfire was low, although the
j crowd was large.
| But 1969 and 1970 were high
lighted by issues more signific

ant than football weekends.
As two seniors wrote in a
Daily opinions article at the
beginning of the year, "Now
forthefirsttime, apprehension
over campus unrest seems to
rival speculation over the col
lege football season."
The apprehension was not
entirely unjustified. The year
before, many students were
teargassed and arrested while
protesting war-related re
search by the Stanford Re
search Institute. The sit-ins at
the Applied Electronics
Laboratories and the student
takeover of Encina Hall the
previous spring were vividly
remembered.
The war was "very present"
for people even if they were
not directly involved in protest
ing it, said one former member
of the anti-war movement. The
first draft lottery since 1942 was
held, deciding the military fate
of 8000 students.
Stop the War moratoriums
were held in the fall and early
winter. On Oct. 15, 1969, the
first moratorium sent more
than half a million people
peaceably into the streets ac
ross the United States in out
rage and anger against the war.
A march through Palo Alto
drew 8000 people, both from
the campus and not. Many stu
dents went from door to door
in Palo Alto and Menlo Park
explaining to residents why
they too should oppose the
U.S. conduct in the war in In
dochina. Some professors
cancelled class in sympathy
with the cause; others did so
when few students showed up.
Students leafletted and spoke
to commuters on the Southern
Pacific trains to the city, to
travelers at the airport, to other
students in dorms.
The issue that began to
gather momentum at Stanford
however, was ROTC (Reserve
Officers' Training Corps). The
Academic Council had voted
the year before to stop giving
academic credit for ROTC clas
ses, but the Faculty Senate de
cided to grant it limited credit
in January 1970. Members of
the newly formed New Stan
ford Moratorium began pro
testing what they saw as the
evils of ROTC. A University poll
of the entire faculty shortly be
fore the start of spring quarter
approving the limited credit
plan triggered trashings,
peaceful marches, rallies and
sit ins. The Faculty Senate
voted later that spring not to
give credit for ROTC classes.
Meanwhile, President
Richard Nixon announced the

invasion of Cambodia and set
off demonstrations all across
the nation's campuses — Har
vard, University of Wisconsin,
UC-Berkeley and more than
300 others. A board in White
Plaza kept track of which cam
puses were closed. Classes
here were boycotted and the
campus essentially closed for a
week. The National Guard shot
and killed several protesters at
Kent State University in Ohio.

As a former member of the
movement said, as
usual was quite different."
Confrontations between
police and students continued.
Less militant students joined
the several hundred seasoned
protesters, many of whom
were members of the radical
leftist Students for a Democra
tic Society (SDS). Whereas a
few months previously, the
majority of students here were
not organizing militant de
monstrations or "actively pro
testing, more police brutality
drew more students into the
fray, according to the then-SDS
member Lenny Siegel. Often
students became involved
when friends were hurt or
harassed by police or when
they felt their territory was
being violated, like people
who wage guerilla wars teel,
Siegel said.
Confrontations between the
Stanford protesters and the
police continued into the
summer with attempts to un
dermine thell p.m. curfewthe
city council slapped on the
town in the hope of quelling
late night unrest.
It was a scant 10 years ago
that fans went to the funky

Fillmore in San Francisco to Jef- I
ferson Airplane, Grateful Dead
and Santana performances. It I
was then that the Rolling 1
Stones played at Altamont J
Speedways in Central Califor
nia in a free concert patterned
after Woodstock, which had
been held only four months
before. But the music festival
turned into a nightmare when
the Hell's Angels who were
supposedly responsible for
security there became violent.
Beatings, kickings and a knif
ing were the dominant chords,
instead of love, peace and
music.
The Beatles' album Abbey
Road had just been released.
Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaur
ant was prominently featured
in record store advertise
ments, as was the soundtrack
from Tommy, by the Who. Easy
Rider was playing, as well as Z,
Midnight Cowboy, and that
American classic, The Russians
are Coming, the Russians are
Coming.
.There were other forms of
entertainment, too. One staff
member recalls that many
used to go to Tresidder Union
to watch the protesters rally
and march.
People tended to have longer
hair, some wore beads, many
wore Levi's or army fatigue jac
kets. Many more men sported
beards than now and few
women wore make-up.
The "New Morality" was j
making itself felt. Studies con- !
ducted in coed and non-coed '
dorms showed that students in
single-sex housing did not do j
as well as those in coed dorms. !
Cowell Student Health Center .
began to dispense contracep
tives to unwed minors at the
special decree of then-
President Kenneth Pitzer. Free
clinics were being organized in
the community.
The Sunday Flicks were 40
cents, a new VW bug was only
$1962, records were marked
down to $2.99 each and a mid-

night flight to Los Angeles
could be had for only $10.
In 1970 a mere 2i cents
would buy Maggie's Farm, a
radical version of the Universi
ty's publication designed to
acquaint entering students
with the campus.
The other side of the coin
was salaries — a great topic of
controversy that year because
protesters released informa
tion about faculty income they

had seized at the Encina Hall
sit-in the year before. Accord
ing to figures published in an
anonymous leaflet and re
printed in the Daily, Pitzer had
a salary of $60,000, an expense
account of $26,500 and a "con
tingency fund" of $100,000.
Not to mention a free house.
But the days of those shock
ing revelations are gone. White
Plaza no longer echoes 'with
the crunch of brick on helmet
and police billy club on skull.
'Kool-aid' calls Jonestown to
mind, not electric kool-aid acid
tests'(with LSD). "Up against
the wall" is an expression di- 1
rected at red-neck mothers,!
not the administration. Is it a<
shame that it's all over? "Yes
and no," said the former
movement member. "My
nerves were shot, my head was
shot. It's nice to wake up and
Vietnam isn't sprawled all over
the papers. I miss the rele
vance, a certain camaraderie, a
certain concern."
As Bob Dylan said, "It's all
over now, baby blue."


Up against the wall: police officers hold several protesters in the lobby of Old Union after a night of mayhem
and clashes during the week-long student strike of May 1970. Students struck against the invasion of
Cambodia and the on-campus ROTC program.
