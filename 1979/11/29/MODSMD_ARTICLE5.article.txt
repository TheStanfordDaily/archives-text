# Campus property, press freedom, Ohio State –
## — Just about everything, administration to Big-10 football, under attack in turbulent war year 
### Bill Burger 
The 1970-71 academic year
contrasts sharply with many
that will be examined hereafter
in this issue. The generally pre
valent calm of the post-
Vietnam War years is as alien to
many of the decade's early

graduates as a stream of bricks
thrown through the large win
dows of the Lou Henry Hoover
Building would be to today's
students. But the '70s, like
every decade, no doubt, defies
attempts to break down multi
year trends, attitudes and ap
pearances into neat, clean an
nual divisions.
Assoc. English Prof. Bruce
Franklin's emergence as a
major campus figure cannot be
claimed by the '70-71 year
alone. Nor can the installation
of floodlights on major ad
ministrative and academic
buildings, which gave the
campus brightly lit nights by
which to watch the windows
shatter. Those occurrences, al
though witnessed that year,
belong to the times.
They were the times that
administrators are happy to see
long gone and the times that
students today find difficult
to imagine.
But while much has changed
since then, many things are
surprisingly similar. In
terspersed with news of
Richard Lyman's appointment
just four days before autumn
quarter registration as the
seventh president of the Uni
versity was that of a campus
housing shortage and a tight
rental market in Palo Alto. Stu
dents found the time to discuss
these issues while waiting for
up to four hours in the registra
tion lines at Maples Pavilion.
The wait may have been
somewhat less painful than the
one this fall, however. The tui
tion for one quarter was $800.
That's $2400 for an entire year.
The football team had played
a few games by the time stu
dents arrived in the fall, and
had won them all, including an
upset win over highly regarded
Arkansas. But USC was consi
dered to be the Pac-8 pow
erhouse and all that most fans

expected was a respectable
season under coach John
Ralston and with senior )im
Plunkett at quarterback.
Through it all, the war con
tinued. It didn't always make
headlines; the endless statis
tics of killed and wounded Cls
returning home in body bags
and wheelchairs wore heavily
on readers. But still, the war
was there, an inescapable real
ity that grated on the minds of
many and quickly catalyzed
campus reactions to major
local and national events.
For weeks on end, events on
campus would occur much as
they do now, but when a major
Indochinese invasion or bomb
ing was announced by the De
partment of Defense, the rocks
would fly and the police, com
plete with riot gear, would
flood the campus. The Hoover
Institution, the department of
aeronautics and astronautics,
the department of physics and
the then-Stanford Research In
stitute were favorite targets for
anti-war protesters.

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1970-71

The temper of the campus
could change dramatically. In
probably the most frightful
night this campus has ever
seen, two students, one from
Palo Alto's Cunn High School
and the other an under
graduate here, were each shot
in the leg by an unknown as
sailant during the widespread
campus protests which fol
lowed the Laotian invasion in
February 1971. As a Daily edito
rial said the day following the
shooting, "The shit has come
home." And it had.
Campus protesters were not

the only ones to have their
problems with the police,
however. In early April, a Stan
ford Hospital employee named
Sam Bridges was fired. Charges
of racial discrimination
abounded after the firing of
Bridges, a black, and on April 8,
about 60 demonstrators staged
a sit-in in a corridor of the hos
pital. Thirty hours later, 175
Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies and Palo Alto police
arrived to clear out the de
monstrators. A violent con
frontation followed, leaving 13
police officers and more than
two dozen demonstrators in
jured.
Amid the confusion, many of
the demonstrators escaped
undetected from the building.
On April 12, in an effort to
gather information about
those who escaped and evi
dence against those arrested,
four Palo Alto police officers
entered the offices of the Daily
with a search warrant and
rummaged through files, desks
and garbage cans for nearly an
hour before leaving empty
handed.
It was the first such raid in

the nation's history ever car
ried out against a newspaper
and within a month, the
Daily sued Palo Alto and its
police chief James Zurcher.
The case outlived the era of
its birth, finally being decided
by the U.S. Supreme Court
after seven years of hearings
and appeals, in favor of Palo
Alto. The Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher is claimed by the press
to be one of the Supreme
Court's most flagrant intrus
ions upon the First and Fourth
amendments of the constitu
tion.
But not every noteworthy
event of the year ended with a
visit by the police. The football
team, then called the "In
dians," filled the stadium with
rooters and those rooters with
dreams of roses.
That perennially powerful
USC team visited the Farm and
was shocked 24-14 by a team
sporting a new name: the
"Thunderchickens."
More victories would follow,
as well as some defeats. But in
the end, the team would have
its Rose Bowl berth guaranteed
with two games left in the sea
son. Even a disheartening Big
Came loss to Cal couldn't spoil
Stanford's first trip to Pasadena
in 19 years.
Leading Stanford against a
heavily favored Ohio State
team was Jim Plunkett, who
was awarded the Heisman
Trophy after rewriting the re
cord books in his three years as
a starter.
Plunkett and Stanford sur
prised the nation on New
Year's Day by beating Woody
Hayes' Buckeyes 27-17. Ranked
eighth in the final AP Top 20
poll, Stanford wouldn't have to
wait another 30 years between
Rose Bowl wins.
But it was still difficult to
bask in the glow of the pleasant
times. The unpleasant world
situation just wouldn't go
away.
Lyman's office in Building 10
was bombed on April 23 and
the Junipero Lounge was de
stroyed in an arson fire just
three days later. The fact that
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy
"Mayer were pacing a success
ful tennis team and Tom Watson
was spending his time on the
golf course here mattered little
to many persons.
As the year ended, two famil- j
iar tales of woe were heard, i
Tresidder Union was having j
labor problems and a boycott I
was in progress. And 576 stu- j
dents were unassigned to on- >
campus housing for the follow
ing year.
In time, the bombings would
end. But the registration lines t
and housing shortage would
return as regularly as the rising
sun — although eventually to a
campus minus harsh flood- j
lights.


Assoc. English Prof. Bruce
Franklin emerged as a major
campus figure in 1970-71. An
avowed Maoist and revolutio
nary, Franklin was suspended
and later dismissed from the
University on charges that he
had incited students to violence
during a speech.


Things were not "not all Roses" in this year, as the Stanford football
squad, led by Heisman trophy winner Jim Plunkett, traveled to the Rose
Bowl and thrashed a previously unbeaten Ohio State squad, 27-17.

Franklin's emergence as a
major campus figure cannot be
claimed by the '70-71 year
alone. Nor can the installation
of floodlights on major ad
ministrative and academic
buildings, which gave the
campus brightly lit nights by
which to watch the windows
shatter. Those occurrences, al
though witnessed that year,
belong to the times.
They were the times that
administrators are happy to see
long gone and the times that
students today find difficult
to imagine.
But while much has changed
since then, many things are
surprisingly similar. In
terspersed with news of
Richard Lyman's appointment
just four days before autumn
quarter registration as the
seventh president of the Uni
versity was that of a campus
housing shortage and a tight
rental market in Palo Alto. Stu
dents found the time to discuss
these issues while waiting for
up to four hours in the registra
tion lines at Maples Pavilion.
The wait may have been
somewhat less painful than the
one this fall, however. The tui
tion for one quarter was $800.
That's $2400 for an entire year.
The football team had played
a few games by the time stu
dents arrived in the fall, and
had won them all, including an
upset win over highly regarded
Arkansas. But USC was consi
dered to be the Pac-8 pow
erhouse and all that most fans

expected was a respectable
season under coach John
Ralston and with senior )im
Plunkett at quarterback.
Through it all, the war con
tinued. It didn't always make
headlines; the endless statis
tics of killed and wounded Cls
returning home in body bags
and wheelchairs wore heavily
on readers. But still, the war
was there, an inescapable real
ity that grated on the minds of
many and quickly catalyzed
campus reactions to major
local and national events.
For weeks on end, events on
campus would occur much as
they do now, but when a major
Indochinese invasion or bomb
ing was announced by the De
partment of Defense, the rocks
would fly and the police, com
plete with riot gear, would
flood the campus. The Hoover
Institution, the department of
aeronautics and astronautics,
the department of physics and
the then-Stanford Research In
stitute were favorite targets for
anti-war protesters.

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1970-71

The temper of the campus
could change dramatically. In
probably the most frightful
night this campus has ever
seen, two students, one from
Palo Alto's Cunn High School
and the other an under
graduate here, were each shot
in the leg by an unknown as
sailant during the widespread
campus protests which fol
lowed the Laotian invasion in
February 1971. As a Daily edito
rial said the day following the
shooting, "The shit has come
home." And it had.
Campus protesters were not

the only ones to have their
problems with the police,
however. In early April, a Stan
ford Hospital employee named
Sam Bridges was fired. Charges
of racial discrimination
abounded after the firing of
Bridges, a black, and on April 8,
about 60 demonstrators staged
a sit-in in a corridor of the hos
pital. Thirty hours later, 175
Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies and Palo Alto police
arrived to clear out the de
monstrators. A violent con
frontation followed, leaving 13
police officers and more than
two dozen demonstrators in
jured.
Amid the confusion, many of
the demonstrators escaped
undetected from the building.
On April 12, in an effort to
gather information about
those who escaped and evi
dence against those arrested,
four Palo Alto police officers
entered the offices of the Daily
with a search warrant and
rummaged through files, desks
and garbage cans for nearly an
hour before leaving empty
handed.
It was the first such raid in

the nation's history ever car
ried out against a newspaper
and within a month, the
Daily sued Palo Alto and its
police chief James Zurcher.
The case outlived the era of
its birth, finally being decided
by the U.S. Supreme Court
after seven years of hearings
and appeals, in favor of Palo
Alto. The Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher is claimed by the press
to be one of the Supreme
Court's most flagrant intrus
ions upon the First and Fourth
amendments of the constitu
tion.
But not every noteworthy
event of the year ended with a
visit by the police. The football
team, then called the "In
dians," filled the stadium with
rooters and those rooters with
dreams of roses.
That perennially powerful
USC team visited the Farm and
was shocked 24-14 by a team
sporting a new name: the
"Thunderchickens."
More victories would follow,
as well as some defeats. But in
the end, the team would have
its Rose Bowl berth guaranteed
with two games left in the sea
son. Even a disheartening Big
Came loss to Cal couldn't spoil
Stanford's first trip to Pasadena
in 19 years.
Leading Stanford against a
heavily favored Ohio State
team was Jim Plunkett, who
was awarded the Heisman
Trophy after rewriting the re
cord books in his three years as
a starter.
Plunkett and Stanford sur
prised the nation on New
Year's Day by beating Woody
Hayes' Buckeyes 27-17. Ranked
eighth in the final AP Top 20
poll, Stanford wouldn't have to
wait another 30 years between
Rose Bowl wins.
But it was still difficult to
bask in the glow of the pleasant
times. The unpleasant world
situation just wouldn't go
away.
Lyman's office in Building 10
was bombed on April 23 and
the Junipero Lounge was de
stroyed in an arson fire just
three days later. The fact that
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy
"Mayer were pacing a success
ful tennis team and Tom Watson
was spending his time on the
golf course here mattered little
to many persons.
As the year ended, two famil- j
iar tales of woe were heard, i
Tresidder Union was having j
labor problems and a boycott I
was in progress. And 576 stu- j
dents were unassigned to on- >
campus housing for the follow
ing year.
In time, the bombings would
end. But the registration lines t
and housing shortage would
return as regularly as the rising
sun — although eventually to a
campus minus harsh flood- j
lights.

Franklin emerged as a major
campus figure in 1970-71. An
avowed Maoist and revolutio
nary, Franklin was suspended
and later dismissed from the
University on charges that he
had incited students to violence
during a speech.


Things were not "not all Roses" in this year, as the Stanford football
squad, led by Heisman trophy winner Jim Plunkett, traveled to the Rose
Bowl and thrashed a previously unbeaten Ohio State squad, 27-17.
The 1970-71 academic year
contrasts sharply with many
that will be examined hereafter
in this issue. The generally pre
valent calm of the post-

administrators are happy to see
long gone and the times that
students today find difficult
to imagine.
But while much has changed
since then, many things are
surprisingly similar. In
terspersed with news of
Richard Lyman's appointment
just four days before autumn
quarter registration as the
seventh president of the Uni
versity was that of a campus
housing shortage and a tight
rental market in Palo Alto. Stu
dents found the time to discuss
these issues while waiting for
up to four hours in the registra
tion lines at Maples Pavilion.
The wait may have been
somewhat less painful than the
one this fall, however. The tui
tion for one quarter was $800.
That's $2400 for an entire year.
The football team had played
a few games by the time stu
dents arrived in the fall, and
had won them all, including an
upset win over highly regarded
Arkansas. But USC was consi
dered to be the Pac-8 pow
erhouse and all that most fans

expected was a respectable
season under coach John
Ralston and with senior )im
Plunkett at quarterback.
Through it all, the war con
tinued. It didn't always make
headlines; the endless statis
tics of killed and wounded Cls
returning home in body bags
and wheelchairs wore heavily
on readers. But still, the war
was there, an inescapable real
ity that grated on the minds of
many and quickly catalyzed
campus reactions to major
local and national events.
For weeks on end, events on
campus would occur much as
they do now, but when a major
Indochinese invasion or bomb
ing was announced by the De
partment of Defense, the rocks
would fly and the police, com
plete with riot gear, would
flood the campus. The Hoover
Institution, the department of
aeronautics and astronautics,
the department of physics and
the then-Stanford Research In
stitute were favorite targets for
anti-war protesters.

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1970-71

The temper of the campus
could change dramatically. In
probably the most frightful
night this campus has ever
seen, two students, one from
Palo Alto's Cunn High School
and the other an under
graduate here, were each shot
in the leg by an unknown as
sailant during the widespread
campus protests which fol
lowed the Laotian invasion in
February 1971. As a Daily edito
rial said the day following the
shooting, "The shit has come
home." And it had.
Campus protesters were not

the only ones to have their
problems with the police,
however. In early April, a Stan
ford Hospital employee named
Sam Bridges was fired. Charges
of racial discrimination
abounded after the firing of
Bridges, a black, and on April 8,
about 60 demonstrators staged
a sit-in in a corridor of the hos
pital. Thirty hours later, 175
Santa Clara County sheriff's
deputies and Palo Alto police
arrived to clear out the de
monstrators. A violent con
frontation followed, leaving 13
police officers and more than
two dozen demonstrators in
jured.
Amid the confusion, many of
the demonstrators escaped
undetected from the building.
On April 12, in an effort to
gather information about
those who escaped and evi
dence against those arrested,
four Palo Alto police officers
entered the offices of the Daily
with a search warrant and
rummaged through files, desks
and garbage cans for nearly an
hour before leaving empty
handed.
It was the first such raid in

the nation's history ever car
ried out against a newspaper
and within a month, the
Daily sued Palo Alto and its
police chief James Zurcher.
The case outlived the era of
its birth, finally being decided
by the U.S. Supreme Court
after seven years of hearings
and appeals, in favor of Palo
Alto. The Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher is claimed by the press
to be one of the Supreme
Court's most flagrant intrus
ions upon the First and Fourth
amendments of the constitu
tion.
But not every noteworthy
event of the year ended with a
visit by the police. The football
team, then called the "In
dians," filled the stadium with
rooters and those rooters with
dreams of roses.
That perennially powerful
USC team visited the Farm and
was shocked 24-14 by a team
sporting a new name: the
"Thunderchickens."
More victories would follow,
as well as some defeats. But in
the end, the team would have
its Rose Bowl berth guaranteed
with two games left in the sea
son. Even a disheartening Big
Came loss to Cal couldn't spoil
Stanford's first trip to Pasadena
in 19 years.
Leading Stanford against a
heavily favored Ohio State
team was Jim Plunkett, who
was awarded the Heisman
Trophy after rewriting the re
cord books in his three years as
a starter.
Plunkett and Stanford sur
prised the nation on New
Year's Day by beating Woody
Hayes' Buckeyes 27-17. Ranked
eighth in the final AP Top 20
poll, Stanford wouldn't have to
wait another 30 years between
Rose Bowl wins.
But it was still difficult to
bask in the glow of the pleasant
times. The unpleasant world
situation just wouldn't go
away.
Lyman's office in Building 10
was bombed on April 23 and
the Junipero Lounge was de
stroyed in an arson fire just
three days later. The fact that
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy
"Mayer were pacing a success
ful tennis team and Tom Watson
was spending his time on the
golf course here mattered little
to many persons.
As the year ended, two famil- j
iar tales of woe were heard, i
Tresidder Union was having j
labor problems and a boycott I
was in progress. And 576 stu- j
dents were unassigned to on- >
campus housing for the follow
ing year.
In time, the bombings would
end. But the registration lines t
and housing shortage would
return as regularly as the rising
sun — although eventually to a
campus minus harsh flood- j
lights.


Assoc. English Prof. Bruce
Franklin emerged as a major
campus figure in 1970-71. An
avowed Maoist and revolutio
nary, Franklin was suspended
and later dismissed from the
University on charges that he
had incited students to violence
during a speech.


Things were not "not all Roses" in this year, as the Stanford football
squad, led by Heisman trophy winner Jim Plunkett, traveled to the Rose
Bowl and thrashed a previously unbeaten Ohio State squad, 27-17.
