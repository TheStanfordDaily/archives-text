# Franklin firing, protests: last gasp of violence
## Stanford wins at the Rose Bowl but loses coach Ralston and 'Indian' as mascot 
### Rob Lempert 
The spring of 1972 was the
last gasp of the violent protest
at Stanford. It was the last time
bands of students prowled the
campus waging war against the
armies of police in their riot
gear. Sometimes it is hard to
believe how different things
were then, how the plazas we
now stroll through thinking of
finals or of love were once
battlefields, how those nice
people who now and then
come to our dorms and sip our
wine and answer our questions
about advising were once The
Administration. Or how the
long-haired students in beards
and jeans looked so different
than the slicked-down police
that they seemed to be from
different worlds, as different
from one another as the Yan
kee soldiers were from those
Asian peasants whose villages
they razed in the Vietnamese
jungles.
The political issues raised on
editorial pages perhaps would
not even be asked now. In 1972
the LSJUMB felt the need to
vote on whether it should
admit women to its ranks, and
decided not to. The administ
ration felt the need to discuss a
ban on waterbeds as a possible
improper influence on cam
pus, and the whole country
debated whether it was moral
and feasible to bomb a jungle
into submission.

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1971-72

It was a year when now
j permanent fixtures of campus
i and our lives were first init
iated, things that are so natural
now that it is hard to believe
I they are only eight years old. It
1 was the year the University first
started advance registration,
I got a labor union arid an on
j campus bank. It was the year
! 18-year-olds were given the
vote.
It was a year with whose le
i gacy we are still struggling.
| Students protested a Hoover
Institution celebration of the
| 2500 th year of the Persian Em
! pire and the rule of the Shah of
I Iran. It was the year Nixon went
, to China and George Wallace
I was shot. It was the year the
United States mined Haiphong
harbor.
| The biggest story of the
! 1971-1972 school year was the
| firing of Bruce Franklin, and it
i is hard to say which is more

t surprising about the incident:
that the University fired a te
nured professor for something
he said or did or that a tenured
professor would say or do the
things he did.
Franklin was an associate
professor of English and a re-
J nowned Melville scholar. He
j was also an avowed revolutio-
I nary. He had returned from Fr
| ance in 1968 a devoted Maoist
| and founded two groups, the
Peninsula Red Guards and the
Revolutionary Union, both of
which advocated armed vio
lence to speed the fall of
American "imperialism. He
was considered the most inf
luential radical on campus.
I At the beginning of 1971,

Franklin was involved in four
incidents that led to disruption
and violence: the heckling of
ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge; a speech that may have
incited a crowd to illegally oc
cupy the campus computer

center, a speech that may have
incited a crowd to disobey a
police order to disperse, and a
speech that may have incited
groups of students to form
marauding late-night hands on
campus.
President Richard Lyman
convened the Faculty Advisory
Board to consider the question
of Franklin's dismissal. On
Sept. 28, 1971, the seven
member board met in public
session tor the first of six weeks
of hearings.
Day after day the sessions
went on, Franklin arguing he
was discussing a "strike" or
"voluntary boycott" rather
than an occupation of the
computer center, and that his
comments to the police in
tront of the building were not
meant to be heard by the
crowd that subsequently
rioted. The administration ar
gued his speeches were inten
tional calls for violence.
By a 5-2 vote the board re
commended Franklin's firing
for his three speeches involv

ing the computation center.
The next day 400 people
marched across campus in pro
test, and both faculty and stu
dents blasted the decision.
Franklin left, and the protests
slowly died away.

But the war rallies certainly
didn't pass quietly. On April
16, 1972, hundreds of U.S.
bombers struck Hanoi and
Haiphong in the heaviest raids
in four years. The next day 350
students marched across cam
pus and broke windows for

two hours in protest of the
bombings. There were no ar
rests or injuries but the Hansen
Labs, the Hoover Institution,
the Durand building, the
Placement building, the En
gineering labs and a patrol car
were hit by barrages of rocks.
The next day 650 people tried
to shut down El Camino at the
corner of Escondido Road.
Singing "We Shall Overcome,"
They marched into the north
bound lanes blocking all traf
fic. The police reacted quickly.
About 70 officers charged the
crowd, scattering the de
monstrators in all directions.
Those who fled toward the
cover of the campus eucalyp
tus groves were pursued by the
club-wielding police. Several
students were beaten, one as
she stood caught on the fence,
protesters were dragged
bleeding and sometimes un
conscious to the waiting paddy
wagons. More than 200 people
were arrested, 116 of them
from Stanford.
But the year also had battles
of a more pleasant sort. Led by
the passing aim ot Don Bunce
and the "Thunderchicken" de
fense of middle-linebacker Jeff
Siemon, Stanford went to its
second straight Rose Bowl. It
was a "typical" Stanford sea
son. When they were heavily
favored, the then Indians blew
easy games against San )ose

State, Duke and conference
doormat Washington State but
when emotions ran high, they
convincingly thrashed UCLA,
USC and Cal.
The game that year in )
Pasadena was one to be re- |
membered. Big Ten champion
Michigan was 10-0 and had
outscored its opponents 409 to
70. On paper Michigan looked
unstoppable. But for four
hard-fought quarters, the
Thunderchicken defense
stifled the powerful but boring
Michigan running attack. With
12 seconds left on the clock,
Rod Garcia put the ball through
the uprights from 31 yards out
to give Stanford three points, a
second consecutive Rose Bowl
victory.
But the Indians would not re
turn to Pasadena for two
reasons. |ohn Ralston, talented
and audacious coach, resigned
four days after his Rose Bowl
triumph to take the head
coaching spot of the Denver
Broncos and, in early February,
President Richard Lyman said
he was sympatheticwith Native
American requests that the In
dian be dropped as the school
mascot. By the end of the year
the ASSU senate had started its
search for a new symbol.
Stanford had problems over
seas that year. French police
raided the campus of
Stanford-in-Tours looking for
drugs. Fortunately, for those
students planning a stay of less
than 20 years, none were
found.
The year 1972 marked the last
of the riots and (he last of the
Rose Bowls. That summer a
group of burglars would set off
the chain of events that would
gain Richard Nixon an infam
ous place in history. The years
ahead would see America lose
its first war, its boundless
sources of energy, and much
of its national purpose.
Those who graduated in 1972
found themselves moving to
quieter times. The next crises
would be fought in Washington
court rooms, not rice paddies
and plazas.
(Also helping with this article
was Lihby Keller.)



Sit-ins, strikes and demonstrations continued into 1972, and occasion
ally the pressures of police-student tensions flared into violence. On
April 21, 1972, 70 policemen charged a crowd blockading the traffic
on El Camino. There were 200 arrests of the protesters stemming from
the incident.


For the second time in as many years, Stanford (the knights in white)
traveled to Pasadena.

The next day 400 people
marched across campus in pro
test, and both faculty and stu
dents blasted the decision.
Franklin left, and the protests
slowly died away.

But the war rallies certainly
didn't pass quietly. On April
16, 1972, hundreds of U.S.
bombers struck Hanoi and
Haiphong in the heaviest raids
in four years. The next day 350
students marched across cam

two hours in protest of the
bombings. There were no ar
rests or injuries but the Hansen
Labs, the Hoover Institution,
the Durand building, the
Placement building, the En
gineering labs and a patrol car
were hit by barrages of rocks.
The next day 650 people tried
to shut down El Camino at the
corner of Escondido Road.
Singing "We Shall Overcome,"
They marched into the north
bound lanes blocking all traf

About 70 officers charged the
crowd, scattering the de
monstrators in all directions.
Those who fled toward the
cover of the campus eucalyp
tus groves were pursued by the
club-wielding police. Several
students were beaten, one as
she stood caught on the fence,
protesters were dragged
bleeding and sometimes un
conscious to the waiting paddy
wagons. More than 200 people
were arrested, 116 of them
from Stanford.
But the year also had battles
of a more pleasant sort. Led by
the passing aim ot Don Bunce
and the "Thunderchicken" de
fense of middle-linebacker Jeff

second straight Rose Bowl. It
was a "typical" Stanford sea

pus and broke windows for

two hours in protest of the
bombings. There were no ar
rests or injuries but the Hansen
Labs, the Hoover Institution,
the Durand building, the
Placement building, the En
gineering labs and a patrol car
were hit by barrages of rocks.
The next day 650 people tried
to shut down El Camino at the
corner of Escondido Road.

They marched into the north

About 70 officers charged the

But the year also had battles
of a more pleasant sort. Led by
the passing aim ot Don Bunce
and the "Thunderchicken" de
fense of middle-linebacker Jeff
Siemon, Stanford went to its
second straight Rose Bowl. It
was a "typical" Stanford sea
son. When they were heavily
favored, the then Indians blew
easy games against San )ose

The game that year in )
Pasadena was one to be re- |
membered. Big Ten champion
Michigan was 10-0 and had
outscored its opponents 409 to
70. On paper Michigan looked
unstoppable. But for four
hard-fought quarters, the
Thunderchicken defense
stifled the powerful but boring
Michigan running attack. With
12 seconds left on the clock,
Rod Garcia put the ball through
the uprights from 31 yards out
to give Stanford three points, a
second consecutive Rose Bowl
victory.
But the Indians would not re
turn to Pasadena for two
reasons. |ohn Ralston, talented
and audacious coach, resigned
four days after his Rose Bowl
triumph to take the head
coaching spot of the Denver
Broncos and, in early February,
President Richard Lyman said
he was sympatheticwith Native
American requests that the In
dian be dropped as the school
mascot. By the end of the year
the ASSU senate had started its
search for a new symbol.
Stanford had problems over
seas that year. French police
raided the campus of
Stanford-in-Tours looking for
drugs. Fortunately, for those
students planning a stay of less
than 20 years, none were
found.
The year 1972 marked the last
of the riots and (he last of the
Rose Bowls. That summer a
group of burglars would set off
the chain of events that would
gain Richard Nixon an infam
ous place in history. The years
ahead would see America lose
its first war, its boundless
sources of energy, and much
of its national purpose.

found themselves moving to
quieter times. The next crises

Sit-ins, strikes and demonstrations continued into 1972, and occasion
ally the pressures of police-student tensions flared into violence. On
April 21, 1972, 70 policemen charged a crowd blockading the traffic
on El Camino. There were 200 arrests of the protesters stemming from
the incident.


For the second time in as many years, Stanford (the knights in white)
traveled to Pasadena.
The spring of 1972 was the
last gasp of the violent protest
at Stanford. It was the last time
bands of students prowled the
campus waging war against the
armies of police in their riot
gear. Sometimes it is hard to
believe how different things
were then, how the plazas we
now stroll through thinking of
finals or of love were once
battlefields, how those nice
people who now and then
come to our dorms and sip our
wine and answer our questions
about advising were once The
Administration. Or how the
long-haired students in beards
and jeans looked so different
than the slicked-down police
that they seemed to be from
different worlds, as different
from one another as the Yan
kee soldiers were from those
Asian peasants whose villages
they razed in the Vietnamese
jungles.
The political issues raised on
editorial pages perhaps would
not even be asked now. In 1972
the LSJUMB felt the need to
vote on whether it should
admit women to its ranks, and
decided not to. The administ
ration felt the need to discuss a
ban on waterbeds as a possible
improper influence on cam
pus, and the whole country
debated whether it was moral
and feasible to bomb a jungle
into submission.

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1971-72

It was a year when now
j permanent fixtures of campus
i and our lives were first init
iated, things that are so natural
now that it is hard to believe
I they are only eight years old. It
1 was the year the University first
started advance registration,
I got a labor union arid an on
j campus bank. It was the year
! 18-year-olds were given the
vote.
It was a year with whose le
i gacy we are still struggling.
| Students protested a Hoover
Institution celebration of the
| 2500 th year of the Persian Em
! pire and the rule of the Shah of
I Iran. It was the year Nixon went
, to China and George Wallace
I was shot. It was the year the
United States mined Haiphong
harbor.
| The biggest story of the
! 1971-1972 school year was the
| firing of Bruce Franklin, and it
i is hard to say which is more

t surprising about the incident:
that the University fired a te
nured professor for something
he said or did or that a tenured
professor would say or do the
things he did.
Franklin was an associate
professor of English and a re-
J nowned Melville scholar. He
j was also an avowed revolutio-
I nary. He had returned from Fr
| ance in 1968 a devoted Maoist
| and founded two groups, the
Peninsula Red Guards and the
Revolutionary Union, both of
which advocated armed vio
lence to speed the fall of
American "imperialism. He
was considered the most inf
luential radical on campus.
I At the beginning of 1971,

Franklin was involved in four
incidents that led to disruption
and violence: the heckling of
ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge; a speech that may have
incited a crowd to illegally oc
cupy the campus computer

center, a speech that may have
incited a crowd to disobey a
police order to disperse, and a
speech that may have incited
groups of students to form
marauding late-night hands on
campus.
President Richard Lyman
convened the Faculty Advisory
Board to consider the question
of Franklin's dismissal. On
Sept. 28, 1971, the seven
member board met in public
session tor the first of six weeks
of hearings.
Day after day the sessions
went on, Franklin arguing he
was discussing a "strike" or
"voluntary boycott" rather
than an occupation of the
computer center, and that his
comments to the police in
tront of the building were not
meant to be heard by the
crowd that subsequently
rioted. The administration ar
gued his speeches were inten
tional calls for violence.
By a 5-2 vote the board re
commended Franklin's firing
for his three speeches involv

ing the computation center.
The next day 400 people
marched across campus in pro
test, and both faculty and stu
dents blasted the decision.
Franklin left, and the protests
slowly died away.

But the war rallies certainly
didn't pass quietly. On April
16, 1972, hundreds of U.S.
bombers struck Hanoi and
Haiphong in the heaviest raids
in four years. The next day 350
students marched across cam
pus and broke windows for

two hours in protest of the
bombings. There were no ar
rests or injuries but the Hansen
Labs, the Hoover Institution,
the Durand building, the
Placement building, the En
gineering labs and a patrol car
were hit by barrages of rocks.
The next day 650 people tried
to shut down El Camino at the
corner of Escondido Road.
Singing "We Shall Overcome,"
They marched into the north
bound lanes blocking all traf
fic. The police reacted quickly.
About 70 officers charged the
crowd, scattering the de
monstrators in all directions.
Those who fled toward the
cover of the campus eucalyp
tus groves were pursued by the
club-wielding police. Several
students were beaten, one as
she stood caught on the fence,
protesters were dragged
bleeding and sometimes un
conscious to the waiting paddy
wagons. More than 200 people
were arrested, 116 of them
from Stanford.
