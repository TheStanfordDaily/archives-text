The fourth academic year of
the decade was a busy one for
Stanford.
The conflict begun earlier in
the year over the firing of Bruce
Franklin continued during the
fall oi 1972 as the University
tiled for a motion of summary
judgment in a county court.
Santa Clara County Court
Judge Joseph Kelly later denied
the two University motions,

which sought a judgment
against Franklin without a lull
scale trial.
The American Civil Liberties
Union filed suit on his behalf
against the University in Au
gust 1972. The suit charged that
the reasons given from the Te
nure Statement for Franklin's
dismissal ("substantial and
manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's per
formance of his appropriate

function within the University
community") did not apply to
Franklin's conduct.
While student reaction to
Franklin's dismissal and sub
sequent suit was not nearly so
strong in 1972-73 as in the pre
vious academic year, students
here remained active in taking
a stand on national issues in
1972. In mid-January students
reacted to President Richard
Nixon's Christmas bombing of
North Vietnam by holding sev
eral rallies and hosting numer
ous anti-war speakers. Folk
singer Joan f3aez, speaking
here in February called the
bombing "heart-rending, out
rageous and terrifying."
Faculty members also pro
tested the Vietnam War in early
1973. As a sign of protest, 10
University professors marched
from a noon rally in Cubberley
Auditorium to President
Richard Lyman's office in late
January. The faculty members

urged Lyman to sever Univer
sity ties with the Department of
Defense (DOD). Opposed to
DOD's recruiting efforts on
campus, Professor of Medicine
Hal Holman said, "although
not everyone agrees that DOD
ties should be severed or that
military recruitment should be
banned, Lyman as symbolic
head ot the University should
stand up for certain humanita
rian values which don't reflect
war, murder or torture."
Despite the strong anti-war
sentiment on the campus, Uni
versity reaction to then Sec ret
ary ol State Henry Kissinger's
announcement of a peace ag
reement with North Vietnam in
early 197.i was mixed. Stanford
graduate Greg Larsen said, "I
didn't teel any cause for ela
tion. How can I celebrate a
peace with honor when all I
can remember is the
thousands ot lives that have
been ruined?"

Anti-war sentiment on c am
pus helped fuel the McGovern
lor President campaign on
campus. Several student or
ganizations formed to work toi
the South Dakota senator in his
bid tor the presidency. Nixon
won re-election in the biggest

ing standards of living and full
employment. Lyman left the
University for autumn quarter
to study English history in Lon
don. William Miller, a former
physics researcher, replaced
Lyman as acting president.
Electrical engineering pro
fessor William Shockley
suggested spending $40,000 to
study the correlation between
the amount of Caucasian an
cestry of black students here
and their scholastic perfor
mance and intelligence quo
tient. Shockley, a 1956 Nobel
laureate in physics continued
to support his theory that
"genes account for 80 percent
of whatever pushes IQ up or
down." This assertion he said,
"leads inescapably to the opin
ion that American Negro IQ
and social "deficiencies are
primarily hereditary and ra
cially genetic in origin."
The University's diverse fa
culty and academic prestige
continued to attract high
school seniors in 1973. In mid-
February, the Admissions Of
fice announced that under
graduate applications in
creased six percent in 1972.
More than 9200 people applied
for the 1450 openings in the
1973 freshman class.
University Dean of Admis
sions Fred Hargadon also
stated that Stanford would not
follow Bowdoin College's lead
in abolishing the Scholastic Ap
titude Test (SAT) as an admis
sion requirement for under
graduate applicants. Hargadon
questioned the desirability of
seeking an increase in the
number of applicants at the
expense of dropping admis
sion requirements.
Like the rest of the country
inflation came to the University
in 1972 as the Office of Man
agement & Budget announced
a ten percent increase in tui
tion costs. The mid-November
proposed price hike brought
the tuition bill for the academic
year 1973-74 to $3135 and a

seven percent rise in room and
board costs raised students'
housing and food bills to $1425
for the coming year.
In an effort to combat an an
nual inflation rate of eight per
cent, Tresidder Union offered
a breakfast special. Ninety
nine cents bought University
residents two eggs, hash
browns, bacon, toast and cof
fee. In another anti
inflationary move the ASSU did

not raise the 50-cent price of
the Sunday Flicks.
Entertainment at the Univer
sity covered all bases in late
1972 and early 1973. "The
Grateful Dead" played to a

packed house at Maples Pavil
ion. The Drama Dept. put on a
bawdy French comedy called
"The Beaux Strategem" and
Sometimes a Great Notion,
starring Henry Fonda, played at
the Flicks.
Students bored vVith Univer
sity entertainment ventured off
campus to see rock star David
Bowie bring down the house at

Winterland or to Palo Alto
theaters to see the new hit
movie One Flew Over the Cuc
koo's Nest with Jack Nichol
son.
Regardless of student in

terest in off-campus enter
tainment, most University re
sidents turned out on Saturday
afternoons to watch the wild
and crazy Leland Stanford
)unior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) perform at half
time of the football games. The
Incomparables marked a turn
ing point in 1972 as band mem
bers decided to admit women
to the band's marching ranks.
Neither female nor male mem-

bers seemed worried over the
group's policy change. As Band
leader Dean Smith remarked,
"Some of the girls are just as
gross as the guys."
Despite unique half-time

routines by male and female
incomparables, football fans
left the stadium disappointed
on Big Came Day. The UC-
Berkeley Bears dealt a close but
painful loss to the Cards 24-21.
However, Card fans found
some consolation for the Big
Game loss later in the year
when the Cardinal basketball
team rolled over the Bears
73-68. University students
cheered as the gymnastics
team tied for the NCAA title in
the spring.
Other aspects of campus life
remained unchanged through
the events of 1972. In the
spring housing draw 700 stu
dents were left unassigned
after the second round. The

University suspended (he
Delta Tau Delta fraternity from
campus for two years following
numerous complaints of mis
conduct. Residents of nearby
houses complained that
fraternity members threw
rocks and bottles through car
windows and fired pellet guns
at passing cars.
Other fraternities came up
against University criticism in
1972. In late May, Administra
tion officials investigated the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity after
a stripper was raffled off during
a rush party. Student reaction
to the University investigation
was mixed. One senior who at
tended the controversial party
said, "I don't see why they (the
Administration) are investigat
ing the whole thing. It was one
of the best parties Stanford has
ever had."
In a Daily poll, freshmen
complained of being sexually
frustrated. Interested students
offered a wide variety of solu
tions to the problem including,
"Join the Band," "Read Picking
Up Girls Made Easy and
Change Your Sex.
