## Franklin fever cools but not anti-war sentiment or demands to cut Stanford-DOD ties

The fourth academic year of
the decade was a busy one for
Stanford.
The conflict begun earlier in
the year over the firing of Bruce
Franklin continued during the
fall oi 1972 as the University
tiled for a motion of summary
judgment in a county court.
Santa Clara County Court
Judge Joseph Kelly later denied
the two University motions,

which sought a judgment
against Franklin without a lull
scale trial.
The American Civil Liberties
Union filed suit on his behalf
against the University in Au
gust 1972. The suit charged that
the reasons given from the Te
nure Statement for Franklin's
dismissal ("substantial and
manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's per
formance of his appropriate

function within the University
community") did not apply to
Franklin's conduct.
While student reaction to
Franklin's dismissal and sub
sequent suit was not nearly so
strong in 1972-73 as in the pre
vious academic year, students
here remained active in taking
a stand on national issues in
1972. In mid-January students
reacted to President Richard
Nixon's Christmas bombing of
North Vietnam by holding sev
eral rallies and hosting numer
ous anti-war speakers. Folk
singer Joan f3aez, speaking
here in February called the
bombing "heart-rending, out
rageous and terrifying."
Faculty members also pro
tested the Vietnam War in early
1973. As a sign of protest, 10
University professors marched
from a noon rally in Cubberley
Auditorium to President
Richard Lyman's office in late
January. The faculty members

urged Lyman to sever Univer
sity ties with the Department of
Defense (DOD). Opposed to
DOD's recruiting efforts on
campus, Professor of Medicine
Hal Holman said, "although
not everyone agrees that DOD
ties should be severed or that
military recruitment should be
banned, Lyman as symbolic
head ot the University should
stand up for certain humanita
rian values which don't reflect
war, murder or torture."
Despite the strong anti-war
sentiment on the campus, Uni
versity reaction to then Sec ret
ary ol State Henry Kissinger's
announcement of a peace ag
reement with North Vietnam in
early 197.i was mixed. Stanford
graduate Greg Larsen said, "I
didn't teel any cause for ela
tion. How can I celebrate a
peace with honor when all I
can remember is the
thousands ot lives that have
been ruined?"

Anti-war sentiment on c am
pus helped fuel the McGovern
lor President campaign on
campus. Several student or
ganizations formed to work toi
the South Dakota senator in his
bid tor the presidency. Nixon
won re-election in the biggest
