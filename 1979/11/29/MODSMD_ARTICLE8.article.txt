# USE strikes, students streak across campus
## Meanwhile, the White House that Nixon built crumbles, Franklin still out of a job too By Jimmy Glanzer and Joan O'Connell

"lt is quiet enough now to
go about the business of edu
cation. "
-letter to the Daily, Sept. 1973,
Certainly it was a year "quiet
enough" for the operation of a
university that had witnessed,
within the past few years, many
disruptive student protests.
But it was not silent.
Watergate and the possible
impeachment of President
Richard Nixon clearly domi
nated the headlines that year.
The Watergate scandal was
still unfolding when Spiro
Agnew resigned as vice presi
dent of the United States on
Oct. 10. A tew weeks later, a
panel of Stanford faculty called
for the impeachment of Nixon.
A rally in support of Nixon's
impeachment drew more than
400 students to White Plaza.
In an interesting quirk of
late, one of the lour principle
speakers there urged protes

ters to contact, in particular,
then-Stanford trustee Thomas
Jones to help push Nixon out
of office.
But in May of 1974 )ones
pleaded guilty to criminal
charges that he illegally used
corporate funds to contribute
to the then-President Nixon's
re-election campaign. He res
igned from the Board of Trus
tees two weeks later.
Another troublesome
episode for the University, the
Bruce Franklin controversy,
continued. Sacked by Stanford
in 1972 on incitement-to-riot
charges, the ex-English profes
sor's unsuccessful bid for
employment elsewhere was
prominently reviewed every
few months. The Maoist pro
fessor and his sympathizers
saw the situation as another
example of University complic
ity: others saw Franklin as a
"perfidious hero" of the press.
Franklin's sidp of the argu

ment was strengthened by an
FBI memorandum that ap
peared to indicate that he had
been the target of a govern
ment program designed to dis
rupt his political activities.
Another employment dis
pute concerned the newly

formed United Stanford
Employees (USE). Five months
of labor negotiations between
the administration and USE
culminated in a walk-out on
May 13 of technical, mainte
nance and service workers.
The three-week-long strike
disrupted campus operations,
stopped deliveries and halted
millions of dollars worth of
construction.
The two bargaining teams
compromised on a three-year
contract that included a 26.4
percent increase in the wage
and-benefit base.
One University effort to
meet its increasing operating
costs was the Campaign for
Stanford, a five-year program
that had already met half of its
$300 million dollar objective in
its second year.
The 1973-74 academic year
emphasized adjustment and
re-emphasized tradition much
to the dismay of some people
on campus. In letters and opin
ions in the Daily, the words
"apathy" and "inertia" began
to appear. One columnist
questioned, "Where is the

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1973- 74

Stanford counter-culture
now?" and answered, "If the
current generation of under
graduates isn't into rock and
roll, please tell me that it's into
something subversive."
Representative of the chang
ing mood was streaking. What
Newsweek called a "bliztkrieg
run through public areas com
pletely in the buff" indeed cap
tured the Stanford campus. In
the most notorious streak, a
delegation of 45 Branner un
dergraduates amused and be
mused rush hour commuters
with a nude run across the i
Golden Gate Bridge that left
highway patrolmen with "a
traffic jam of massive propor
tions."
There was always tradition to
tall back on. As Kohoutek
the blazing celestial event that
wasn't â€” trekked across fall
skies, Stanford and Berkeley
prepared to fight out the 76th
Big Game. For the eighth time
in the history of the contest,
the axe, the symbol of victory
in the rivalry, was stolen. It was
an operation that the "Infam
ous Three" of the Theta Delts
labeled as "simple" and "oh, j
so smooth." But their efforts I
were only "icing on the cake" !
as the Big Game was indeed [
captured by the Cards, 26-17.
Less simple and smooth was
the campus housing problem.


Streaking came into vogue in 1973-74, and in the most notorious of the "blitzkrieg runs through public areas
c ompletely in the buff," 45 Branner undergraduates tied up rush-hour traffic with a streak across the Golden
Gate Bridge.


A few weeks after the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew, a rally calling for the impeachment of
President Richard Nixon drew a crowd of more than 400 to White Plaza.
