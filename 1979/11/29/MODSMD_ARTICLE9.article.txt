It's much too soon for nos
talgia, but if one were to go
back to academic year 1974-75
around the Stanford cam
pus,one would find that most
students' ears were still co
vered with hair, and many
wore those platypus-like nega
tive heel shoes. The now
defunct Paris Theater in
downtown Palo Alto was adver
tising films for adults only with

ads like "Why would a man pay
$500 for an hour with these
girls?"
Relatively pleasant
memories would be evoked by
an examination of local
gasoline prices. The lowest
price for regular gas was 48.9
cents a gallon, the highest was
59.9 cents.
Itwasayearwhen the United
States was suffering in the last
throes of its involvement in
Vietnam. Student protests no
longer had the fervor of de
monstrations in the early 70s,
but there were still those who
felt called upon to express out
rage. Some Concerned People
at Stanford had an all-day vigil
and teach-in in January com
memorating the second an
niversary of the signing of the
1973 Paris Peace Agreement. It
was a bitter indictment of the
"peace with honor" decree.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) went on a 10-day
tour of South East Asia and
came back recommending the
extension of American military
aid to Cambodia. He defended
his position before a largely
hostile crowd in Cubberley
Auditorium in March.
"Most students and faculty
surveyed last night after the
surrender of the South Viet
namese not only seemed re
lieved that the war was over,
but expected the new govern
ment to be better for the
people than was the govern
ment of former President
Nguyen Van Thieu," according
to the April 30 issue of the Dai
ly. Students took stands on
issues other than Vietnam.
There were 75 Stanford stu
dents who participated in a
week-long -march from San
Francisco to Modesto with the
United Farm Workers. The
students joined Cesar Chavez
in demanding from Ernest
Gallo Farms a secret ballot
election on the choice of un
ions, proving that students,
too, are capable of "thinking
l before drinking."
It has been i complaint for
many years that Stanford is
! strong in its graduate programs
! and weak at the undergraduate
! level. In February over 300 stu

dents held a "funeral" protest
ing what they called "the death
of undergraduate education"
atStanford. Theywere trying to
emphasize the impact of te
nure cutbacks, slashes in fi
nancial aid and innovative
programs and increased tui
tion. It was a year of recession
and budgetary conservatism.
Exemplary of the frustration
student protesters often felt
was the Oct. 30 demonstration
against on-campus recruiting

by the U.S. Marine Corps. The
150 students were peaceful and
the recruiter returned the next
day.
Stanford signed a $978,000
three-year contract in Tehran,
Iran, in March to assist in the
planning of a communication
satellite system under the
Shah's regime. Over the pro
tests of Iranian students and
the Alliance for Radical
Change, Communication Prof.
Edwin Parker said that it was
"an opportunity to help those
in rural Iran."
In response, approximately
350 students peacefully oc
cupied the Old Union in May
for an hour. They were protest
ing the research contract with
Iran and changes in financial
aid programs for students.

STANFORD IN THE 1970s
1974-75

The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) first began
receiving University funding
after two years of develop
ment. Other funding came
from the Ford Foundation and
the Robert Sterling Clark
Foundation. Its two stated ob
jectives were: promoting and
supporting research on
women and improving the
education of women at Stan
ford.

There was a good deal of
union activity among workers
on campus. A big setback oc
curred when the National
Labor Relations Board rejected
a bid by the Stanford Union of
Research Physicists to achieve
bargaining power for 83 re
search assistants in the Physics
Dept.
Researchers and scientists
were increasing Stanford's
prestige. Chemistry Prof. Paul
Flory was a 1974 Nobel Prize
winner for his pioneering re
search in the chemistry and
physics of large molecules. The
last person at Stanford to re
ceive the prize had been Linus
Pauling, 12 years earlier.
A new sub-atomic particle,
the "psi," was described as
"the biggest discovery in
high-energy physics in years."
It was found simultaneously by
teams of physicists working at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and the Brookhaven
National Laboratory in New
York, Nov. 16.
Though Stanford had better
seasons, true Stanford fans will
remember Mike Langford's
50-yard field goal made two
seconds before the end of one
game. It gave Stanford a 22-20
victory over Berkeley in the
77th Big Game.
Basketball fans were in
seventh heaven. The Cards
beat both UCLA and USC in
basketball. Stanford hadn't
taken UCLA since 1966.
As always, there were many
celebrities passing through the
academic portals. Ronald
Reagan was appointed an hon
orary Hoover Fellow that year
when he presented (lis guber
natorial papers to the Hoover
Institute in February.
The big surprise visit of the
year was made by Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, who made a
week-long appearance noted
mainly for its low profile. He
was perusing the collection on
Russian history in early June.
There were two kidnappings
involving Stanford students in
that period. Two students, Car
rie Hunter and Kenneth Smith,
were kidnapped, along with a
Dutch researcher, from Tan
zania's Combe Stream primate
research center in May. Held
by Marxist guerillas in Zaire, all
were eventually released un
harmed after ransom demands
were met.
The low point of the year
came early in October, when
the wife of a Stanford pre-med
student was found dead in
Memorial Church one morn
ing. She had been sexually
molested before being stab
bed in the back of the head.
The financial situation at
Stanford during that year was
not very secure. The budgetary
deficit was $1.6 million, and
subsequent budget cuts
threatened academic stan
dards.


Exiled Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn made a visit to Stanford
in June of 1975. The honorary Hoover Institution fellow spent a week
studying the Hoover's collection on Russian history.


President Gerald Ford showed up on campus in 1975 to deliver
a dedication speech for new Law School facilities. He was met by an
estimated 10,000 onlookers and a at the, entrance to the Man
/anita Trailer Park, "Welcome to HoovÂ«ryillp r "
