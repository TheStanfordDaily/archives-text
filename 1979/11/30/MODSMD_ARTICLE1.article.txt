# Mexico refuses to readmit shah; Carter administration surprised
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — U.S. officials, surprised by Mexico's
decision not to readmit the deposed Shah of Iran, were
trying last night to assess the impact of the move.
State Department officials said it was not clear from
the terse statement issued by Mexican Foreign Minister
)orge Castaneda what Mexico had done or what the
import of the action might be.
Castaneda said "the government of Mexico will not be
in a position to renew'' the shah's visa "because it would
make no sense for him to return to Mexico."
State Department spokesman Walter Ramsay said,
"There will be no reaction until we know what actually
has occurred."
Carter administration officials, speaking privately,
said the Mexican decision was a surprise.
Terms
Iran's terms for releasing the hostages being held at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran are that the deposed Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who is in New York for cancer
treatment, be extradited for trial as a war criminal. This
the Carter administration has refused to do.
Before Mexico announced its decision, the Moslem
militants holding the U.S. Embassy threatened yesterday
to speed up a trial of their 50 American hostages as
"spies" if the United States allows the deposed shah to
leave for Mexico.
In a telephone interview with The Associated Press, a
spokesman for the militants also hinted strongly that the
hostages would be mistreated in revenge.
Expected to leave
The shah had been expected to leave the New York
hospital within a few days to return to Mexico, where he
has lived since his regime fell last winter.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance had said earlier in the
day that the shah "has indicated that when he is able to
travel he does plan to leave the United States." But
Vance did not say when that might happen.
Officials said they did not think the Mexican decision
would change the Carter administration's basic position
that the shah was admitted for medical treatment and
will be leaving when he and his doctors decide it is safe
for him to travel.
Egypt other haven?
But, the officials conceded, the decision raises a new
problem tor the administration because Egypt is the only
other country which has publicly invited the shah to
come.
Another U.S. official whodid not want to be identified

said it was not certain that the administration would
decide that Egypt, already isolated from the Arab world
and facing some economic problems, ought to be given
the additional problems which might arise from harbor
ing the shah.
Earlier yesterday, the United States filed suit against
Iran in an international court, appealing for immediate
action to free American hostages held by Islamic milit
ants in Tehran.
International court
In an urgent appeal to the International Court of Jus
tice in The Hague, the Carter administration called for a
ruling that the American hostages be freed and the
grounds of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran be cleared of the
mob that seized the compound on Nov. 4.
In a letter to the international court, Vance also asked
the court for unspecified "interim measures of protec
tion" for the hostages.
He said Mexico's ambassador to Washington, Hugo
Margain, would inform the shah's "family and represen
tatives" of the decision.
The new threats of harm to the hostages came after
more than one million Iranians, chanting hatred for the
"Yankees" and their willingness to die, poured through
Tehran's streets in a massive show of religious devotion
to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's holy war against
America.
Iran's religious rulers were waiting until the last mi
nute to announce whether the new acting Iranian
foreign minister, Sadegh Chotbzadeh, will take part in
the U.N. debate on the crisis. Ghotbzadeh was expected
to announce the decision at a news conference
scheduled for today.
'Trial inevitable'
"If the U.S. government does not return the ousted
shah to Iran, and if it implements the plot of sending him
to another country, the trial of the hostages will be
inevitable," the radio statement said.
The spokesman said later that the shah's departure
would be "the worst thing the United States can do. It
may be a case of the trial beginning very soon." The
militants have never set a date for such a trial.
He added darkly: "We will change our policy toward
the hostages. We have respect for them, friendly rela
tions, because our religion is Islam. We will change our
policy . . . The reaction of the Iranian people will be

such that it brings a great loss to the United States."
As has been customary, the young man did not give
his name.
Terrorism?
The militants' radio statement, addressed to Iranian
students in America, also seemed to hint at terrorist
activity in the United States, saying that if the shah is
allowed to leave "Iranian Moslems, whether in or out of
the country, will be mobilized to resist the U.S. plot and
the U.S. government will be responsible for the results
of such action."
U.S. officials have said a trial of the hostages might be
the only thing even "more unacceptable" than the

hostage-taking itselt.
The State Department revised its estimate yesterday of
the number of hostages from 49 to "at least 50," saying
the 50th was a businessman named Jerry Plotkin from
California. No further details were available.
Also yesterday, 54 congressmen, led by Rep. Samuel
Stratton, (D-N.Y.) introduced a House resolution urging
President Carter to set a deadline for release of the
hostages, after which the United States would conduct
"selected, deliberate, sustained and increasingly severe
military operations" against Iran.
Despite virtually unanimous international support for
the United States in the 26-day crisis, Iran so far has
refused to yield either the hostages or the embassy.
