### 
Washington (AP) â€” The U.S.
Office of Education Sunday
published a translation of the
college entrance exam that
nearly 6 million Chinese young
people took last year.
The agency said the exam,
the first nationally standar
dized college entrance test in
the People's Republic of China
since the Cultural Revolution
began in 1966, "may very well
provide the outside world with
the most revealing clues it can
hope to obtain regarding . . .
China's ten-year primary

secondary school system."
Just 5 percent, or 290,000, of
those who took the test were
admitted to Chinese colleges
and universities. The test was
given in eight subjects, with all
students taking at least five.
The subjects were mathema
tics, physics, chemistry, poli
tics, history, geography,
Chinese language and foreign
language.
The Chinese made the tests
and an accompanying syllabus
available to outsiders several
months atter the July 1978 ap

plication of the tests. They
were translated by the U.S.
government's Foreign Broad
cast Information Service.
Each subject area was scored
on a 100-point basis, and the
cutoff for ?dmission to regular
colleges was at least 300 points
out of 500, the study said. For a
major university, a score of 380
or higher was needed,. Al
though the test was standar
dized, the passing score varied
according to the province or
municipality where the stu
dents lived.
