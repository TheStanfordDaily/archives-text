### 
Rome (AP) — Ten years after hijacking a
jetliner from Los Angeles to Rome, former
U.S. Marine Raphael Minichiello is free in
Italy but homesick tor America, where he
faces arrest and trial.
"I'd like to go back there, I'd like the
United States to be my second homeland,
the only one for which I was at war," said
the slender Minichiello, who on Oct. 31,
1969 commandeered a Trans World Air
lines Boeing 707 tor a flight of more than
6000 miles. No one was injured in the
hijacking, one of the longest on record.
He was arrested almost immediately and
served 18 months in an Italian prison, but
faces prosecution under a U.S. air piracy
statute that has no statute of limitations.
Minichiello was born 30 years ago in
Italy but went to the United States as a
child. He fought for 2'/j years as a Marine
in Vietnam, where he was decorated for
bravery.
"There always remains something in

side me about America. I'd like to see my
mother and sister in Seattle, and my
friends again," Minichiello said in an in
terview.
"I'm well. I work from morning to night.
I have a wife and son. I'm rather happy,"
Minichiello said. "But I don't feel com
pletely free because in America I'm not
free."
At age 14, Minichiello moved with his
family toSeattle, Vvash., from the villageof
Irpino in the mountains above Naples. He
said he had trouble adjusting to American
society.
"I joined the Marines at 17 and I told
myself I'll be brave so they will treat me as
a true American. I saw so many dead but I
thought I was fighting for my country. But
at Camp Pendleton, Calif, some superiors
would call me Mafioso."
While he was stationed at Camp Pendle
ton, Minichiello broke into the post ex
change. He said he thought he had been

cheated out of money and wanted to
check the record books. He was caught
and ordered to face a court martial on
breaking and entering charges.
''I was desperate. I bought a carbine. I
felt I wanted to go back to Italy. The Cuban
hijackings made methink thequickest way
was to hijack a plane."
Minichiello went to Los Angeles where
he boarded a flight bound to San Fran
cisco. Fifteen minutes after takeoff, he pul
led out the carbine and held it to the back
of a stewardess, demanding the plane fly
to Rome.
The plane landed in Denver, Colo., and
Minichiello released all 35 passengers and
three stewardesses from the crew of se
ven.
In Italy, Minichiello and an Italian sec
urity officer who volunteered as a hostage
left the plane and drove into the coun
tryside until apprehended by police.
