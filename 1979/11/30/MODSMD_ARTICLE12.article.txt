# College ranking: does it matter?

Stanford does not always
rank at or near the top of
rank-order scales of univer
sities.
Alexander Astin and Lewis
Solomon of the Higher Educa
tion Research Institute in Los
Angeles recently did a survey
measuring "relative selectiv
ity" through entrance exam
scores in which Stanford did
not even rank in the top ten.
They concluded that north
eastern institutions are gaining
in popularity among bright
students at the expense of in
stitutions in the Midwest and
far West.
Astin and Solomon said that
none of the most popular in
stitutions for highly able New
Yorkers is located outside the
Northeast. "Apparently,
among highly able students,"
they said, "West looks east to
some extent, but East doesn't
look west."
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Fred Hargadon com
mented: "This survey makes
test scores more important
than they actually are. Though
some of the Ivy League schools
list a higher mean of SAT scores
among incoming students than
does Stanford, that does not
mean they are attracting
higher-caliber students."
Hargadon explained that
Astin and Solomon did not
consider several important var
iables in their suiVey. For in
stance, test scores alone are
not the basis for selectivity in

admissions at Stanford, he
said. The private schools in the
West have to contend with a
renowned and relatively inex
pensive public system.
"The Ivies really don't have a
Berkeley at their back door,"
he said. Another variable is that
Stanford draws students from
the West, and there are fewer
excellent secondary schools
nearby.
Both Hargadon and Bob
Beyers of University News and

Northeastern institutions are gaining in
popularity at the expense of institutions in
the Midwest and West.

Publications agreed with Astin
and Solomon that there is great
competition with the North
east.
"One of the most sensitive
barometers of how good a
school is, is its ability to attract
the students it has accepted,"
Beyers said. "That's where the
competition really lies.
"At Stanford we get about 60
percent of those students we
have accepted," he said.
"When a student is admitted at
two or more schools, he is cal
led a dual admit. Only Harvard
beats us in our rate of dual ad
mits."
Beyers and Hargadon admit
ted that the Ivy League schools
have great popularity, but
pointed out that their minority
enrollment is not as good as
Stanford's, noris theirability to
attract low and middle-income

students.
Astin and Solomon
hypothesized in the same
study that there is "a kind of
folklore regarding the
best' institutions" among stu
dents. Beyers said he saw this in
effect when he worked at Cor
nell.
"I saw great fluctuations in
the reasons students gave from
one year to the next for coming
to a particular school," he said.
"I don't think students

should use rankings to deter
mine which school they will at
tend," said William Clebsch,
professor of religious studies
and humanities. "They should
instead consult with people in
those departments where they
wish to go and not depend on
reputational studies."
"I think the rating systems at
the undergraduate level are
nonsense," said Hargadon. "I
also think it's nonsense for
students to use them to decide
which institution to attend."
Some students seem to be
wary of rankings as well. Kim
Hayes, a graduate student in
environmental engineering,
admitted that it was Stanford's
reputation that made him
come here, but he doubted
whether that reputation was
derived frorn a ranking survey.
"I'm normally against rank
ings, though I understand a

good ranking could influence
someone's decision in terms of
narrowing the choice of
schools," he said.
"I'm no longer concerned
with questions like how Stan
ford rates nationwide," said
Hayes. "Students should base
their choice of school on the
individual program in which
they will be involved."
Sharon Pad i I la, a student
here, said that Stanford's repu
tation was a major factor in her
decision to come here. Padilla,
an undergraduate in Spanish,
said she came to Stanford be
cause she wanted to be close to
home.
"I also wanted to participate
in ethnic and religious organi
zations, and knew that Stan
ford offers both," she said.
"These are things you don't
find in a ranking survey.
"Outside of the University,"
Padilla said, "people seem to
have a very good opinion of
Stanford. But inside, the stu
dents seem to be concerned
with our national ranking.
Those T-shirts that say 'Stan
ford is the Harvard of the West'
prove my point."
Luis Lujan, a student here,
advised an individualistic ap
proach to developing a percep
tion of a university or college.
"Each school has a different
personality. In choosing a
school, students should look at
different institutions in terms
ot what kind of educational ex
perience they want. Stanford
offers a unique experience."

among incoming students than
does Stanford, that does not
mean they are attracting
higher-caliber students."
Hargadon explained that
Astin and Solomon did not
consider several important var
iables in their suiVey. For in
stance, test scores alone are
not the basis for selectivity in

admissions at Stanford, he
said. The private schools in the
West have to contend with a
renowned and relatively inex
pensive public system.
"The Ivies really don't have a
Berkeley at their back door,"
he said. Another variable is that
Stanford draws students from
the West, and there are fewer
excellent secondary schools
nearby.
Both Hargadon and Bob
Beyers of University News and

Northeastern institutions are gaining in
popularity at the expense of institutions in
the Midwest and West.

Publications agreed with Astin
and Solomon that there is great
competition with the North
east.
"One of the most sensitive
barometers of how good a
school is, is its ability to attract
the students it has accepted,"
Beyers said. "That's where the
competition really lies.
"At Stanford we get about 60
percent of those students we
have accepted," he said.
"When a student is admitted at
two or more schools, he is cal
led a dual admit. Only Harvard
beats us in our rate of dual ad
mits."
Beyers and Hargadon admit
ted that the Ivy League schools
have great popularity, but
pointed out that their minority
enrollment is not as good as
Stanford's, noris theirability to
attract low and middle-income

students.
Astin and Solomon
hypothesized in the same
study that there is "a kind of
folklore regarding the
best' institutions" among stu
dents. Beyers said he saw this in
effect when he worked at Cor
nell.
"I saw great fluctuations in
the reasons students gave from
one year to the next for coming
to a particular school," he said.
"I don't think students

should use rankings to deter
mine which school they will at
tend," said William Clebsch,
professor of religious studies
and humanities. "They should
instead consult with people in
those departments where they
wish to go and not depend on
reputational studies."
"I think the rating systems at
the undergraduate level are
nonsense," said Hargadon. "I
also think it's nonsense for
students to use them to decide
which institution to attend."
Some students seem to be
wary of rankings as well. Kim
Hayes, a graduate student in
environmental engineering,
admitted that it was Stanford's
reputation that made him
come here, but he doubted
whether that reputation was
derived frorn a ranking survey.
"I'm normally against rank
ings, though I understand a

good ranking could influence
someone's decision in terms of
narrowing the choice of
schools," he said.
"I'm no longer concerned
with questions like how Stan
ford rates nationwide," said
Hayes. "Students should base
their choice of school on the
individual program in which
they will be involved."
Sharon Pad i I la, a student
here, said that Stanford's repu
tation was a major factor in her
decision to come here. Padilla,
an undergraduate in Spanish,
said she came to Stanford be
cause she wanted to be close to
home.
"I also wanted to participate
in ethnic and religious organi
zations, and knew that Stan
ford offers both," she said.
"These are things you don't
find in a ranking survey.
"Outside of the University,"
Padilla said, "people seem to
have a very good opinion of
Stanford. But inside, the stu
dents seem to be concerned
with our national ranking.
Those T-shirts that say 'Stan
ford is the Harvard of the West'
prove my point."
Luis Lujan, a student here,
advised an individualistic ap
proach to developing a percep
tion of a university or college.
"Each school has a different
personality. In choosing a
school, students should look at
different institutions in terms
ot what kind of educational ex
perience they want. Stanford
offers a unique experience."
Stanford does not always
rank at or near the top of
rank-order scales of univer
sities.
Alexander Astin and Lewis
Solomon of the Higher Educa
tion Research Institute in Los
Angeles recently did a survey
measuring "relative selectiv
ity" through entrance exam
scores in which Stanford did
not even rank in the top ten.
They concluded that north
eastern institutions are gaining
in popularity among bright
students at the expense of in
stitutions in the Midwest and
far West.
Astin and Solomon said that
none of the most popular in
stitutions for highly able New
Yorkers is located outside the
Northeast. "Apparently,
among highly able students,"
they said, "West looks east to
some extent, but East doesn't
look west."
Dean of Undergraduate Ad
missions Fred Hargadon com
mented: "This survey makes
test scores more important
than they actually are. Though
some of the Ivy League schools
list a higher mean of SAT scores
among incoming students than
does Stanford, that does not
mean they are attracting
higher-caliber students."
