# Vatican has financial woes
## 
### 
Vatican City (AP) — The Vati
can, with a collection of price
less artworks, real estate hold
ings and stock portfolios, is
hardly going broke.
But it is dipping ever deeper
into contributions from Roman
Catholics around the world to
pay for its day-to-day opera
tions, and those offerings are
shrinking.
On the one hand, the Vati
can must cope with inflation, a
growing global mission and the
wage demands of Italians who
work in this tiny city-state. All
contribute to a deficit the Vati
can says will reach $20 million
this year and probably worsen
in 1980.
On the other hand, con
troversies that have engulfed
the church over the last two
decades have taken their toll
on giving. Church experts say
this is particularly true in the
United States which, along
with West Germany, is looked
upon as a main source of con
tributions.
This was the gloomy finan
cial picture presented by Pope
John Paul II to the world's car
dinals when they gathered ear
lier this month in an extraordi
nary assembly, leading to an
historic disclosure of the state
of Vatican finances — if only in
part.
The pontiff said that reports
of fabulous wealth held by the
Holy See were damaging
myths.
A concluding report said
bluntly that the Holy See's in
come from property, invest
ments and other sources was
"absolutely insufficient" to
cover the costs of the church's
central government and the
pope's activities. It warned that
if the situation were not
changed, the Holy See would
soon be "hard pressed'' to
carry out its mission.
Until now, the Vatican has
covered the deficit thanks to
Peter's Pence. What began in
the ninth century as a sort of
property tax levied on the
homes of British Catholics to

support the Holy See has
evolved into voluntary con
tributions from parishes and
the 2500 dioceses around the
world.
Vatican sources say these
contributions dipped as low as
$6 million a year under Pope
Paul VI, but in the first year of
Pope john Paul ll'spontificate,
contributions climbed to $12
million.
The rises and falls in these
contributions, Vatican obser
vers say, reflect the turmoil in
the church, the popularity of
the pope and increasing finan
cial demands on Roman
Catholics.
"After the reforms of Vatican
11, conservative Catholics, who
tend to be the wealthy ones,
probably cut back their giv
ing," said the Rev. Vincent
O'Keefe, a Jesuit official.
"Another group was proba
bly turned off by Humanae
Vitae," he said, referring to
Paul's encyclical opposing arti
ficial birth control.
Within the next three
months, the cardinals are to
send suggestions to the pope
on how to deal with the finan
cial problems.
The pope's report did not lift
the traditional secrecy entirely.
It gave no indication of the ac
tual size of the Vatican's
budget and made no mention
of the Vatican's bank, officially
called the Institute for Religi
ous Works.
The bank, headed by Bishop
Paul Marcinkus of Cicero, 111.,
has estimated deposits of $2
billion and provides a full
range of banking services for
its customers — religious or
ders, ambassadors to the Holy
See and recommended lay
persons.
The Rev. Giovanni Cereti,
who has studied Vatican fi

nances, estimates the Holy
See's budget at about $70 mill
ion a year.
Pope Paul once said the
church must be poor and ap
pear poor, and the Vatican
sometimes hints at compara
tive poverty as it knocks down
reports that the Holy See is
rich.
In 1970, when published re
ports put the Vatican's invest
ment capital inside and outside
Italy at $12 billion, the Vatican
disclosed that the actual figure
was less than $130 million.
Vatican insiders say that in
recent years the Holy See has
been divesting itself of hold
ings in Italian companies and
shifting into public utilities,
banks, insurance companies
and "blue chip" stocks in the
United States, Switzerland,
West Germany and japan.
To avoid many moral con
flicts, it has sold interest in
companies involved in the
manufacture of arms, con
traceptives and films.
The shift to non-Italian in
vestments makes sound finan
cial sense. Since 1962, the
value of its long-held stocks on
Milan's battered market has
dropped more than half, even
without taking inflation into
account.
Investment income is used
to run the Roman curia, the
church's central administra
tion; maintain its mainly Re
naissance buildings; operate
the daily Observatore Romano
newspaper, which reportedly
runs $1.7 million in the red
every year, and pay t he salaries
of 1500 lay workers, who re
cently took steps toward form
ing a union.
Salaries now range from $360
a month for doormen to $1200
a month for engineers, jour
nalists and other professionals.

can says will reach $20 million
this year and probably worsen
in 1980.
On the other hand, con
troversies that have engulfed
the church over the last two
decades have taken their toll
on giving. Church experts say
this is particularly true in the
United States which, along
with West Germany, is looked
upon as a main source of con
tributions.
This was the gloomy finan
cial picture presented by Pope
John Paul II to the world's car
dinals when they gathered ear
lier this month in an extraordi
nary assembly, leading to an
historic disclosure of the state
of Vatican finances — if only in
part.
The pontiff said that reports
of fabulous wealth held by the
Holy See were damaging
myths.
A concluding report said
bluntly that the Holy See's in
come from property, invest
ments and other sources was
"absolutely insufficient" to
cover the costs of the church's
central government and the
pope's activities. It warned that
if the situation were not
changed, the Holy See would
soon be "hard pressed'' to
carry out its mission.
Until now, the Vatican has
covered the deficit thanks to
Peter's Pence. What began in
the ninth century as a sort of
property tax levied on the
homes of British Catholics to

support the Holy See has
evolved into voluntary con
tributions from parishes and
the 2500 dioceses around the
world.
Vatican sources say these
contributions dipped as low as
$6 million a year under Pope
Paul VI, but in the first year of
Pope john Paul ll'spontificate,
contributions climbed to $12
million.
The rises and falls in these
contributions, Vatican obser
vers say, reflect the turmoil in
the church, the popularity of
the pope and increasing finan
cial demands on Roman
Catholics.
"After the reforms of Vatican
11, conservative Catholics, who
tend to be the wealthy ones,
probably cut back their giv
ing," said the Rev. Vincent
O'Keefe, a Jesuit official.
"Another group was proba
bly turned off by Humanae
Vitae," he said, referring to
Paul's encyclical opposing arti
ficial birth control.
Within the next three
months, the cardinals are to
send suggestions to the pope
on how to deal with the finan
cial problems.
The pope's report did not lift
the traditional secrecy entirely.
It gave no indication of the ac
tual size of the Vatican's
budget and made no mention
of the Vatican's bank, officially
called the Institute for Religi
ous Works.
The bank, headed by Bishop
Paul Marcinkus of Cicero, 111.,
has estimated deposits of $2
billion and provides a full
range of banking services for
its customers — religious or
ders, ambassadors to the Holy
See and recommended lay
persons.
The Rev. Giovanni Cereti,
who has studied Vatican fi

nances, estimates the Holy
See's budget at about $70 mill
ion a year.
Pope Paul once said the
church must be poor and ap
pear poor, and the Vatican
sometimes hints at compara
tive poverty as it knocks down
reports that the Holy See is
rich.
In 1970, when published re
ports put the Vatican's invest
ment capital inside and outside
Italy at $12 billion, the Vatican
disclosed that the actual figure
was less than $130 million.
Vatican insiders say that in
recent years the Holy See has
been divesting itself of hold
ings in Italian companies and
shifting into public utilities,
banks, insurance companies
and "blue chip" stocks in the
United States, Switzerland,
West Germany and japan.
To avoid many moral con
flicts, it has sold interest in
companies involved in the
manufacture of arms, con
traceptives and films.
The shift to non-Italian in
vestments makes sound finan
cial sense. Since 1962, the
value of its long-held stocks on
Milan's battered market has
dropped more than half, even
without taking inflation into
account.
Investment income is used
to run the Roman curia, the
church's central administra
tion; maintain its mainly Re
naissance buildings; operate
the daily Observatore Romano
newspaper, which reportedly
runs $1.7 million in the red
every year, and pay t he salaries
of 1500 lay workers, who re
cently took steps toward form
ing a union.
Salaries now range from $360
a month for doormen to $1200
a month for engineers, jour
nalists and other professionals.
Vatican City (AP) — The Vati
can, with a collection of price
less artworks, real estate hold
ings and stock portfolios, is
hardly going broke.
But it is dipping ever deeper
into contributions from Roman
Catholics around the world to
pay for its day-to-day opera
tions, and those offerings are
shrinking.
On the one hand, the Vati
can must cope with inflation, a
growing global mission and the
wage demands of Italians who
work in this tiny city-state. All
contribute to a deficit the Vati
