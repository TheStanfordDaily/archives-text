The last Bug Me of the decade! Can you
believe it?
This column is dedicated to that
courageous breed of Americans who have
found a way to laugh in the face of diminish
ing oil supplies: cyclists.
Dear Bug Me,
I am a 200 pound male. I ride a motorcycle
which, while small, would be a substantial
challenge for most people to lift off the
ground. Yet even with all this weight and
metallic mass, I have spent many a frustrated
moment stuck in a left turn lane as the traffic
signal's cycle passed me by ... So imagine
my surprise to read in your column that both
the magnetic and the weight-sensing signal
systems can be tripped by a mere bicycle and
rider!
Does this mean I have been regularly violat
ing the law needlessly? Please help me, Bug
Me, as I am suffering from my . . .
Culpable Mens Rea
Let me answer this letter with some excerpts
from a second letter I received in response to
that column. These informative comments
are from the "president-elect of the Western
Wheelers Bicycle Club, vice chairman of the
Palo Alto Bicycle Advisory Committee, and a
long-time Stanford cyclist," Alan Wachtel.
What should a bicyclist do at a stop light
that changes only for cars and motorcycles?
These lights operate by detecting large mas
ses of metal passing near a magnetic induc
tion loop buried in the pavement. (Pressure
plates are rare, and the ones you see are usu
ally not in service.)
Clearly, auto traffic in your lane can trip the
light for you. Traffic in adjacent lanes will help
in some cases, but remember that left-turn

only and through lanes may have different
greens. Likewise, opposing traffic may give
you a green light.
What if no auto traffic is around? In many
cases you can fool the detector by placing
your bicycle directly over one side of the re
ctangular cuts in the pavement which mark
the magnetic induction loops. Sometimes
passing along the wire is enough; sometimes
you must sit on it. This technique works de
pendably almost everywhere in Palo Alto.
There's an alternative, of course. A traffic
light that you would normally obey has failed
in its function of regulating traffic; instead it
prohibits bicycle travel altogether or forces
the cyclist to leave the proper lane, and pos
sibly the street, to push a button. Such a
signal, whatever its intention, is illegal in
practice, and you have no duty to observe it.
Treat it as a stop sign, and cross when safe. If
cross traffic is heavy, you may have no choice
but to use the pedestrian button.
A final bike question:
A couple of weeks ago the sidewalks in
front of Roble Gym were sloped so that bicy
cles could ride on them. But whoever did the
work neglected to put an incline on one side
of an intersection, causing me to almost
break my neck. What is the reason for this
incomplete job?

According to campus planner Max
Mazenko, "this sounds like a situation where
there should be a ramp. The University, in an
effort to make the campus more accessible to
the handicapped, is putting ramps wide
enough for wheelchairs to use at all pedest
rian crossings. Mazenko said he would look
into the case of the missing Roble ramp.
