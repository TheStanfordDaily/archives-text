# Bill 'Early-Date' Kemmeries
## Cure the 'B.S. Blues' 
### 
It was at some dorm or fraternity/sorority for
mal with everyone looking real fancy and cham
pagne fountains overflowing, when I turned
around and saw that jackass Larry Smelly. Be
sides being ugly, Larry is extremely boring.
We started talking the basic "how has your
quarter been I haven't seen you for awhile" gar
bage. You know how it is with some people, it
was pure bull. I have more fun talking to my pets
at home.
It was then ttyat I realized, while I was trying to
decide whether Larry was as exciting as the
champagne fountain, that ole Smelly was giving
me a bad case of the "B.S. Blues" (a psychologi
cal term for pent-up frustrations due to massive
amounts of 8.5.).
This social disease runs rampant at Stanford,
and is usually an epidemic at dorm and
fraternity/sorority formals. Not only is it easy to
tell who gives you the "B.S. Blues," but it is also
pretty simple to determine when you are giving
a bad case to someone else (usually their eyes
are moving up and down, all around while you
are talking to them, like the person is doing
some kind of eye test for the doctor or some
thing). • w
Why is this disease spreading so quickly?
The ma'rn problem is that the "B.S. Blues'," two
standard cures are so old that they are getting
stale. These are:
1. Refreshment Fake-Out: In the middle of
your dull conversation, just say to the person,
"Hey, would you like a drink or some cake?"
and then don't ever come back. IJ is a well
known party "secret" that you can always tell
who the boring people are at a formal because
they all stand around, waiting for sqme food or
punch.
In fact, if you walk up to someone at a formal
and ask, "What's going on?" and they say "Just
waiting for some punch," just keep on walking.
Don't even think twice because that person is
probably boring.
l.Dancing: When you can hardly take another
word from a person's mouth, just ask him or her
to dance. It's an incredible conversation killer,
and that's why you see some couple continue to
dance after the music is over. You think they
love to dance. Hah, they are afraid to talk.
As I said before, these two techniques have
become antiquated, and thus a$ a result of the
increasing "B.S. Blues" "there has been a major
breakdown in the party system."
In fact, Ann Landers called me up last week to
find out just exactly how to handle this terrible
social disease, and of course I gave her the
cures.
Now I've already helped you little ingrates
remember names in the "Name-Game," and
learn to stop the "Early-Date" syndrome, so I
might as well help you cure the "B.S. Blues."
O.K. "Lucky-bucks," there are four cures, and
each one is for a 1 different relationship.
1. Turk Schonert Fake-Out: Guys, if some
other dude is putting you to sleep, just say to the
deadbeat, "Hey, I didn't know Turk Schonert
and your girlfriend were that close." First he'll
look puzzled, and then immediately start look
ing around the room in fear that Turk might be
"scoring" a T.D. in the "off-season."
2. Bull-in-China-Closet Technique: Girls, if
your conversation with another girl is driving
you crazy, just say to her, "Oh, may I take a

closer look at your necklace?" and then acci
dently spill your wine all over her dress. Then be
sure to say, "Oh dear, I am so sorry."
Remember, it must look like it was an acci
dent! I remember last year some girl dumped
the whole punch-bowl over another girl's head,
and then said, "Oh me oh my, I am so sorry." It
didn't cut the mustard, and the two ended up in
a huge, hair-pulling fight.
Probably the most interesting sight you'll ever
see is when two girls that hate each other are
talking, and both are using the Bull-in-China-
Closet Technique. It's like two cobras facing off,
you don't know which one is going to strike first.
I remember my senior prom cheering, and
placing bets, while forming a circle around
these two girls who were trying to spill wine on
each other. I won something like $100 that night.
Paid for my tux, dinner, everything!
3. Cramps Fake-Out: Girls, this takes a lot of
guts, but if your conversation with a guy is get
ting so bad you can't stand it, just make a weird
face and say, "I'm sorry, I've got cramps to
night." BINGO! This totally treaksguysout. You
have put them in a world in which they have no
clue. This technique is one of the most effective
known.
I remember last spring some girl told my
buddy Johnny Neverkiss this line at our formal,
and he freaked out, screamed, "Nice have a
day/' starjed crying, and then ran in the bat
hroom and hid near the trash can all night. Al
though he did get a couple of tips, he had a
lefrible evening.
4i "Big Eyes" Technique: This technique is
best used later in the evening, when everyone is
sauced. Guys, if you are really getting tired of
some girl's gab, instead of having your eyes roll
around like some Disneyland manikin, stoop
down til you are six inches from the girl's chest,
and stare. This alone is worth it because a) she
stops talking almost immediately, and b) it will
probably be the most fun you'll have all night.
Then, after 10 or 20 seconds of staring, look
into her eyes and say, "Oh my, you have a big
beautiful pair of eyes."
Generally the girl will either a) be so flustered
that'she thanks you for the compliment, or b)
just knock the living "hudda"out of you. Usu
ally its the Jatter. In fact, often you never even
have time to say, "Oh my, you have," before
you find yourself smelling the dance floor.
These are the major cures of the "B.S. Blues,"
and I hope that they will help you this year.
Personally, I think the best thing would be a
mandatory "Thumbs-up/Thumbs-down" rule at
all tormals.
If you turn around and see someone you don't
like or don't want to talk to, then form the
"thumbs-down"' sign with your hand that is not
holding a drink. No questions asked.
If you like the person and want to talk then of
course it would be "thumbs-up." It's as simple
as that.
Although some people will complain and start
crying that they are always being "thumbed
down," big deal such is life. However, if anyone
puts "thumbs-down" on me tonight, I'll per
sonally . . .

closer look at your necklace?" and then acci
dently spill your wine all over her dress. Then be
sure to say, "Oh dear, I am so sorry."
Remember, it must look like it was an acci
dent! I remember last year some girl dumped
the whole punch-bowl over another girl's head,
and then said, "Oh me oh my, I am so sorry." It
didn't cut the mustard, and the two ended up in
a huge, hair-pulling fight.
Probably the most interesting sight you'll ever
see is when two girls that hate each other are
talking, and both are using the Bull-in-China-
Closet Technique. It's like two cobras facing off,
you don't know which one is going to strike first.
I remember my senior prom cheering, and
placing bets, while forming a circle around
these two girls who were trying to spill wine on
each other. I won something like $100 that night.
Paid for my tux, dinner, everything!
3. Cramps Fake-Out: Girls, this takes a lot of
guts, but if your conversation with a guy is get
ting so bad you can't stand it, just make a weird
face and say, "I'm sorry, I've got cramps to
night." BINGO! This totally treaksguysout. You
have put them in a world in which they have no
clue. This technique is one of the most effective
known.
I remember last spring some girl told my
buddy Johnny Neverkiss this line at our formal,
and he freaked out, screamed, "Nice have a
day/' starjed crying, and then ran in the bat
hroom and hid near the trash can all night. Al
though he did get a couple of tips, he had a
lefrible evening.
4i "Big Eyes" Technique: This technique is
best used later in the evening, when everyone is
sauced. Guys, if you are really getting tired of
some girl's gab, instead of having your eyes roll
around like some Disneyland manikin, stoop
down til you are six inches from the girl's chest,
and stare. This alone is worth it because a) she
stops talking almost immediately, and b) it will
probably be the most fun you'll have all night.
Then, after 10 or 20 seconds of staring, look
into her eyes and say, "Oh my, you have a big
beautiful pair of eyes."
Generally the girl will either a) be so flustered
that'she thanks you for the compliment, or b)
just knock the living "hudda"out of you. Usu
ally its the Jatter. In fact, often you never even
have time to say, "Oh my, you have," before
you find yourself smelling the dance floor.
These are the major cures of the "B.S. Blues,"
and I hope that they will help you this year.
Personally, I think the best thing would be a
mandatory "Thumbs-up/Thumbs-down" rule at
all tormals.
If you turn around and see someone you don't
like or don't want to talk to, then form the
"thumbs-down"' sign with your hand that is not
holding a drink. No questions asked.
If you like the person and want to talk then of
course it would be "thumbs-up." It's as simple
as that.
Although some people will complain and start
crying that they are always being "thumbed
down," big deal such is life. However, if anyone
puts "thumbs-down" on me tonight, I'll per
sonally . . .
(Bill Kemmeries is crazy. His column appears
every three weeks.)
It was at some dorm or fraternity/sorority for
mal with everyone looking real fancy and cham
pagne fountains overflowing, when I turned
around and saw that jackass Larry Smelly. Be
sides being ugly, Larry is extremely boring.
We started talking the basic "how has your
quarter been I haven't seen you for awhile" gar
bage. You know how it is with some people, it
was pure bull. I have more fun talking to my pets
at home.
It was then ttyat I realized, while I was trying to
decide whether Larry was as exciting as the
champagne fountain, that ole Smelly was giving
me a bad case of the "B.S. Blues" (a psychologi
cal term for pent-up frustrations due to massive
amounts of 8.5.).
This social disease runs rampant at Stanford,
and is usually an epidemic at dorm and
fraternity/sorority formals. Not only is it easy to
tell who gives you the "B.S. Blues," but it is also
pretty simple to determine when you are giving
a bad case to someone else (usually their eyes
are moving up and down, all around while you
are talking to them, like the person is doing
some kind of eye test for the doctor or some
thing). • w
Why is this disease spreading so quickly?
The ma'rn problem is that the "B.S. Blues'," two
standard cures are so old that they are getting
stale. These are:
1. Refreshment Fake-Out: In the middle of
your dull conversation, just say to the person,
"Hey, would you like a drink or some cake?"
and then don't ever come back. IJ is a well
known party "secret" that you can always tell
who the boring people are at a formal because
they all stand around, waiting for sqme food or
punch.
In fact, if you walk up to someone at a formal
and ask, "What's going on?" and they say "Just
waiting for some punch," just keep on walking.
Don't even think twice because that person is
probably boring.
l.Dancing: When you can hardly take another
word from a person's mouth, just ask him or her
to dance. It's an incredible conversation killer,
and that's why you see some couple continue to
dance after the music is over. You think they
love to dance. Hah, they are afraid to talk.
As I said before, these two techniques have
become antiquated, and thus a$ a result of the
increasing "B.S. Blues" "there has been a major
breakdown in the party system."
In fact, Ann Landers called me up last week to
find out just exactly how to handle this terrible
social disease, and of course I gave her the
cures.
Now I've already helped you little ingrates
remember names in the "Name-Game," and
learn to stop the "Early-Date" syndrome, so I
might as well help you cure the "B.S. Blues."
O.K. "Lucky-bucks," there are four cures, and
each one is for a 1 different relationship.
1. Turk Schonert Fake-Out: Guys, if some
other dude is putting you to sleep, just say to the
deadbeat, "Hey, I didn't know Turk Schonert
and your girlfriend were that close." First he'll
look puzzled, and then immediately start look
ing around the room in fear that Turk might be
"scoring" a T.D. in the "off-season."
