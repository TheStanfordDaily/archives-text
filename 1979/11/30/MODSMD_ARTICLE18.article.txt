## Israel, not the PLO, needs support 
### 
With growing concern the
nation of Israel and its suppor
ters have watched the Palesti
nian Liberation Organization
(PLO) gain more open accep
tance in the United States.
Some examples within approx
imately the last several months
are: Andrew Young, U.S. am
bassador to the United Na
tions, secretly meets with the
PLO observer to the U.N.; the
PLO office in New York City
suddenly starts receiving a
daily deluge ot letters of sup
port for their organization;
and, U.S. black leaders meet
PLO leader Yassir Arafat in
Lebanon and tell him they are
behind him.
Why is this happening?
Where have the supporters of
Israel gone? Within the last few
months American public opin
ion has seemingly begun to
give hearty approval to an or

ganization it once regarded as
a band of terrorists.
Part of this recent trend is
due to change of strategy by
the PLO. This organization has
come to the realization that
they can better reach their
ends through negotiation than
terrorism.
So they now have started to
cut back on their acts of vio
lence and are trying to estab
lish a Palestinian state by work
ing through the U.N. Thus,
many Americans are now
thinking that all the PI O wants
is a small state on the West
Bank and then they will let Is
rael live happily ever after.
This is not so.
How can anyone simply
torget the numerous PLO
hijackings, letter bombs and
the PLO slaughter ot 11 Israeli
athletes at the 1972 Munich
Olympics? Still bombs placed

by the PLO are set off continu
ally and kill or injure innocent
civilians in Jerusalem.
The Soviet military is training
new Palestinian guerillas every
day. If negotiations fail, the
PLO simply will return to their
acts of violence and terrorism.
To think that the PLO simply
wants a state of their own and
will let Israel exist is naive. The
PLO charter has always stated
that the State of Israel must be
destroyed. Yet many Ameri
cans, such as the nation's black
leaders who recently visited Is
rael, tell the Israelis that they
should negotiate with the PLO.
One would have to be a fool to
bargain with someone whose
aim is your destruction.
However, just because I feel
that we should not bargain
with the PLO, does not mean I
believe we should not
negotiate with the Palestinians
in general. Many Palestinians
are not set on the destruction
of Israel, but would like to co
exist peacefully alongside the
Jewish state.
Although there seems to be a
shift in American sentiment
towards the PLO, much of this
is due to exaggeration and»
weighted press coverage.
The press enjoys contlict and
thus they have overstated the
split between Jews and blacks
and have caused it to become
more of a reality than originally
existed. Our newspapers have
taken great delight in highlight
ing Ambassador Young's meet
ing with the PLO observer and
Young's resignation. They
have dwelled even more on the
meeting of black leaders, such
as the Rev..Jesse Jackson, with
the PLO.
Finally, a grave concern in
the shift of American public
opinion away from Israel is
Arab oil and OPEC. Oil seems
to mean more to the United
States than respect for our true
friends. If it should ever come
down to choosing between oil
and Israel, I fear that Israel will
be left in the cold.

Eric Hoffer wrote about the
power of oil in his diary, Before
the Sabbath. An excerpt from
his Nov. 27, 1974 entry reads,
"The democracies are entering
1975 without confidence in the
tuture. They are paralyzed by
fear when facing external or in
ternal adversaries. There is not
a democracy that dares say boo
to the pack ot oil sheiks who
are pushing the free world into
recession and stagna
tion. . . ." Now, as we head
towards 1980, this is truer than
ever.
In his Nov. 30 entry, Hotter
wrote, "I have a hunch that the
Arabs will use their oil billions
not to modernize their coun
tries but to redress the balance
between the Christian West
and the Islamic East. They are
financing the pressure against
the non-Moslem enclaves of
Lebanon, Israel and Ethiopia."
Clearly, today, the Arabs and
the PLO are using oil to pres
sure us away from support of
Israel.
Therefore, as the PLO has
now come to the negotiating
table and is attracting follow
ers, and as the need for oil
dominates our country's con
cerns, the Americans who back
Israel sit blindly or apatheti
cally by. This is the major prob
lem in Israel's seeming loss of
support.
Israel's backers have not left.
They just are not speaking out.
Some are not taking notice of
the PLO's new tactics and
others are just not taking ac
tion.
It is time for the American
public to realize that the PLO
does not seek peace as Egypt
and Israel do, but destruction.
Now is the time for Ameri
cans, non-lews as well as Jews,
to speak out in behalf of Israel.
Those who support Israel in
thought must begin to support
Israel in action.

cally by. This is the major prob
lem in Israel's seeming loss of
support.
Israel's backers have not left.
They just are not speaking out.
Some are not taking notice of
the PLO's new tactics and
others are just not taking ac
tion.
It is time for the American
public to realize that the PLO
does not seek peace as Egypt
and Israel do, but destruction.
Now is the time for Ameri
cans, non-lews as well as Jews,
to speak out in behalf of Israel.
Those who support Israel in
thought must begin to support
Israel in action.

With growing concern the
nation of Israel and its suppor
ters have watched the Palesti
nian Liberation Organization
(PLO) gain more open accep
tance in the United States.
Some examples within approx
imately the last several months
are: Andrew Young, U.S. am
bassador to the United Na
tions, secretly meets with the
PLO observer to the U.N.; the
PLO office in New York City
suddenly starts receiving a
daily deluge ot letters of sup
port for their organization;
and, U.S. black leaders meet
PLO leader Yassir Arafat in
Lebanon and tell him they are
behind him.
Why is this happening?
Where have the supporters of
Israel gone? Within the last few
months American public opin
ion has seemingly begun to
give hearty approval to an or

ganization it once regarded as
a band of terrorists.
Part of this recent trend is
due to change of strategy by
the PLO. This organization has
come to the realization that
they can better reach their
ends through negotiation than
terrorism.
So they now have started to
cut back on their acts of vio
lence and are trying to estab
lish a Palestinian state by work
ing through the U.N. Thus,
many Americans are now
thinking that all the PI O wants
is a small state on the West
Bank and then they will let Is
rael live happily ever after.
This is not so.
How can anyone simply
torget the numerous PLO
hijackings, letter bombs and
the PLO slaughter ot 11 Israeli
athletes at the 1972 Munich
Olympics? Still bombs placed

by the PLO are set off continu
ally and kill or injure innocent
civilians in Jerusalem.
The Soviet military is training
new Palestinian guerillas every
day. If negotiations fail, the
PLO simply will return to their
acts of violence and terrorism.
To think that the PLO simply
wants a state of their own and
will let Israel exist is naive. The
PLO charter has always stated
that the State of Israel must be
destroyed. Yet many Ameri
cans, such as the nation's black
leaders who recently visited Is
rael, tell the Israelis that they
should negotiate with the PLO.
One would have to be a fool to
bargain with someone whose
aim is your destruction.
However, just because I feel
that we should not bargain
with the PLO, does not mean I
believe we should not
negotiate with the Palestinians
in general. Many Palestinians
are not set on the destruction
of Israel, but would like to co
exist peacefully alongside the
Jewish state.
Although there seems to be a
shift in American sentiment
towards the PLO, much of this
is due to exaggeration and»
weighted press coverage.
The press enjoys contlict and
thus they have overstated the
split between Jews and blacks
and have caused it to become
more of a reality than originally
existed. Our newspapers have
taken great delight in highlight
ing Ambassador Young's meet
ing with the PLO observer and
Young's resignation. They
have dwelled even more on the
meeting of black leaders, such
as the Rev..Jesse Jackson, with
the PLO.
Finally, a grave concern in
the shift of American public
opinion away from Israel is
Arab oil and OPEC. Oil seems
to mean more to the United
States than respect for our true
friends. If it should ever come
down to choosing between oil
and Israel, I fear that Israel will
be left in the cold.

Eric Hoffer wrote about the
power of oil in his diary, Before
the Sabbath. An excerpt from
his Nov. 27, 1974 entry reads,
"The democracies are entering
1975 without confidence in the
tuture. They are paralyzed by
fear when facing external or in
ternal adversaries. There is not
a democracy that dares say boo
to the pack ot oil sheiks who
are pushing the free world into
recession and stagna
tion. . . ." Now, as we head
towards 1980, this is truer than
ever.
In his Nov. 30 entry, Hotter
wrote, "I have a hunch that the
Arabs will use their oil billions
not to modernize their coun
tries but to redress the balance
between the Christian West
and the Islamic East. They are
financing the pressure against
the non-Moslem enclaves of
Lebanon, Israel and Ethiopia."
Clearly, today, the Arabs and
the PLO are using oil to pres
sure us away from support of
Israel.
Therefore, as the PLO has
now come to the negotiating
table and is attracting follow
ers, and as the need for oil
dominates our country's con
cerns, the Americans who back
Israel sit blindly or apatheti
cally by. This is the major prob
