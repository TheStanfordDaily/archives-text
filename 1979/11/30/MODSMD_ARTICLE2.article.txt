# Antarctic storm buries victims
## Crash blamed on pilot error 
### 
Christchurch, New Zealand (AP) â€”
The pilot of the Air New Zealand
DC-10 that crashed into a remote An
tarctica volcano, killing all 257 per
sons aboard, apparently made a
navigational error that took him on
the "wrong" side of the wind-lashed
mountain, the head of the recovery
operation said yesterday.
An airline spokesman acknow
ledged that the pilot, Capt. |im Col
lins, 45, had never flown the Air New
Zealand antarctic sightseeing route
before. But spokesman ]im Berry re
fused to comment on a possible
cause for the crash.
An advance team of three moun
taineers reached the crash site yes
terday, 1500 feet up the side of
12,400-foot-high Mount Erebus, re
ported no sign of survivors and said
they spotted 60 or 70 bodies, a U.S.
Navy spokesman said.
But it was clear the recovery effort
would be an awesome task: the
climbers said a polar blizzard was al
ready covering the wreckage and
bodies with snow.
The death toll in Wednesday's

crash, including 21 Americans, was
the fourth-highest in aviation his
tory. It was the third fatal accident
involving a DC-10 this year, and it
aroused new demands that the
McDonnell Douglas plane be
grounded.
Roy Thomson, New Zealand's
chief official for Antarctica and
leader of the crash-recovery mission,
said it appeared to him that the pilot,
not the plane, was to blame.
Speaking with reporters in Auck
land, New Zealand, before heading
for the crash area 2000 miles south of
here, he said the plane was supposed
to have been flying past the north
west side of Mount Erebus but slam
med into the northeast side.
The DC-10s normally fly past the
smoldering volcano at about 2000
feet as part of Air New Zealand's ae
rial tour of spectacular polar sights.
"It would seem there has been a
substantial error in navigation by the
pilot," Thomson said.
He did not elaborate, but
treacherous winds in mountain areas
often pose a danger to aircraft, and

unpredictable drafts around active
volcanos can be particularly danger
ous.
Airline spokesman Berry said Col
lins had been with Air New Zealand
tor 21 years "and was a well
experienced pilot ... He had re
ceived a very elaborate briefing on
the flight."
He said the airline would have no
comment on the cause until after the
"black boxes" recording flight date
and communications were reco
vered. Berry said Air New Zealand
has "always been high in our praise
of the DC-10." It owns seven other
DC-10s.
