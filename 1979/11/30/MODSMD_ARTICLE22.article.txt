# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Ann Cuthbertson Rally staged to promote objectivity 
### 
Speaking in defense of fhe
group who sponsored (he
noon rally on Iran (Nov. 19), we
would like to reply to Brett
Kingstone's column (Daily,
Nov. 26), specifically to point
out some areas of inaccuracy
and misrepresentation.
Kingstone's main objection
in the column seems to be that
the rally dicJ not present all
points of view on this issue.
Specifically, he says several
times that he heard much dis
cussion of the "rights of the
Iranian people," and the "evils
of American corporate
capitalism," but not much talk
about the "oppressiveness of
Khomeini's ruleor the threat to
the lives of American hostages
in Iran."
Our group is very concerned
about the safety of the Ameri
can hostages and we do not
necessarily condone the
takeover of the embassy. Many

of us simply feel that it is
hypocritical and inappropriate
for the United States to over
react to this "breach of interna
tional law" considering our
past foreign policy in Iran,
which I think everyone agrees
was exploitative and in
humane.
In response to the charge
that the rally was "one-sided,"
we would like to point out that
the rally was itself a reaction
against the lack of objectivity in
the media about this issue.
There surely has not been
much discussion about the
role of American corporate
capitalism in Iran or the rights
of the Iranian people in the
news lately.
On the contrary, we have
been reading and hearing a
great deal ot sensationalism
and attacks on Iran that come
very close to war propaganda.
This stirs up racist sentiments
and anger against Iran which
cannot possibly serve to help
the hostages.
One example of this is that
the rally was inaccurately
labeled "pro-Khomeini" by the
Peninsula Times Tribune. A
central purpose of the rally was
thus to provide an alternative,
or a counter-balance, to the
media's one-sidedness which,
quite frankly, has most ot us
very scared.
Another purpose of the rally
was to collect signatures on a
petition which clearly stated
the group's position on four
points: 1) The United States
should not respond to this
crisis with military interven
tion, 2) The harassment of the
Iranian students in this country
should cease, particularly the
deportation order, 3) Iran

should receiveacleardiploma
tic pledge that the United
States will refrain from inter
ference in its internal affairs in
fhe future, and 4) It was wrong
to allow the shah to enter this
country, and he should leave
immediately.
Kingstone got us right on the
first three, but he mistook one
speaker's suggestion that the
shah be returned to Iran as re
flecting the attitude of the
group in general. The speakers
did not necessarily voice the
opinions of the group; in fact,
the speakers presented a wide
variety of views of this issue,
and if anything, they rep
resented the diversity of politi
cal leanings within the group.
We therefore object to
Kingstone's statement that the
rally attempted to play on "the
American students' guilt or
sympathy." This may be some
people's reaction to informa
tion about their country that
they would rather not hear, but
it was not our intention.
Kingstone contends that
Khomeini's regime is "just a
radical faction." This is not
true, and needs to be refuted.
Even before the embassy
takeover, Khomeini was a
powerful leader, and the pre
sent crisis, particularly the
military threats from the Un
ited States, has unified Kho
meini's support and
popularized anti-American
sentiments in Iran and in many
other countries as well.
But the point is that Iranians
should be left to decide politi
cal events in their country for
themselves. We can argue the
pros and cons of Khomeini's
regime â€” it may not be "the
supreme result of the struggle
for the autonomy of the Iranian

people," as Kingstone asserts,
and our rally did not seek to
justify him or "cover up" the
oppressiveness of his regime.
But it is the Iranians' strug
gle, and we should not inter
vene in it, whether on the be
half of oil companies, the
weapons industry, or the fact
that the Moslem religion and
culture is "sexist" by our
Western standards.
A final purpose of the rally
was to stimulate thought and
discussion on this issue, and
we are glad that Kingstone,
Stephen Requa {Daily, Nov.
26), and hopefully many others
realize the scope of this crisis
and are being vocal about it.
Far from stifling debate, we
hope to encourage it.
Yes, we are grateful to have
the right of free speech, and
the right to question our coun
try's foreign policy, and we
would like to urge everyone
who is concerned about the
crisis in Iran and the possibility
of a show of military force
there to exercise these rights,
rather than sit back and ap
preciate the fact that they exist,
as Kingstone's conclusion
suggests.
Analyze the situation for
yourself, and play out some
possible scenarios if the Un
ited States does use military
force in this situation.
Right now, Carter's ad
ministration is claiming that
there is virtually no popular
opposition to his option of
military intervention in Iran. If
you don't like the idea, now is
the time to speak up.
