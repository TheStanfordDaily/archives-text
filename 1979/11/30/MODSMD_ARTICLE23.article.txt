Black recruitment
The Stanford Black Caucus
would like to recognize what
appears to be fine administra
tive work by the staffs respon
sible for recruiting and admit
ting students to Stanford. The
results are a surprising yield of
black and other ethnic stu
dents in certain areas. We, the
Stanford Black Caucus, would
like to commend the adminis
trative officers and their re
spective staffs for their efforts.
We take heart in noting that
Undergraduate Admissions,
Law School and Medical
School black and other ethnic
enrollments are not only
commensurate with previous
years, in fact, they are up sub
stantially in some cases.
Those staffs and the Stanford
community should know that
we applaud what is being ac
complished in admissions
under considerable pressure
of close scrutiny. We hope and
expect this will continue. We
are willing to assist in ways that
seem helpful to continue this
success and extend it to others
whose results may not have
been as fruitful.
It would be remiss of us not
to include in this commenda
tion those volunteers and stu
dent program efforts that cur
rently exist to complement the
efforts of the schools and de
partments. We know yours is
not a task of authority but of
individual commitment. You
too are appreciated for the wil

ling and active demonstration
of your beliefs.

Forum proposed
Dreams and schemes we
have. We need a forum. At
probably no other point in our
lives will we have such high
ideals, and ouf of these ideals
come blueprints for a better
world.
Admittedly, our plans are
usually over-simplified, but
buried among them are so
many truly valuable notions
On this campus alone, there
are, I feel certain, at least 117
good, practical solutions to
world problems. Yet, I have
heard but a half a dozen of
them.
I propose to every college
paper that once a week a sec
tion be added to share our
ideas nationwide, to find out
which world crises our peers
are concerned about, and how
they are reacting to them, to
encourage cooperation.
This supplement must be
come a part of the daily paper,
so that the reading of it be
comes as automatic as the
reading of the editorial page.
Out of our campuses come
most of this country's leader
ship, and much of that of the
world.
I would not at all be embar
rassed if the Daily were to in

itiate this project;
)ust give me a decent forum.
I, myself, have at least six or
seven plans for saving human
ity or some part of it.

Three cheers for Craig
Richards who spoke out force
fully against racism (Daily,
Nov. 21). Like Richards, I rarely
write letters to the editor. But I
think he is absolutely right that
there is a rising climate of hos
tility toward non-whites in
America, a fact that I find
thoroughly horrifying.
The brunt of this falls hardest
on blacks. We read of cross
burnings and Klan marches.
Racist graffiti appears at Stan
ford. Cocktail conversation in
cludes racist jokes.
Home run king Hank Aaron
received 950,000 pieces of mail
while pursuing Babe Ruth's
home run record, and fully half
of that was hate mail.
There must be a few of us left
who still care about civil rights
and racial equality. Let's refuse
to be passive or apathetic in the
face of racism. Let's join Craig
Richards and be loudly vocal
about putting an end to this
garbage.

many truly valuable notions
On this campus alone, there
are, I feel certain, at least 117
good, practical solutions to
world problems. Yet, I have
heard but a half a dozen of
them.
I propose to every college
paper that once a week a sec
tion be added to share our
ideas nationwide, to find out
which world crises our peers
are concerned about, and how
they are reacting to them, to
encourage cooperation.
This supplement must be
come a part of the daily paper,
so that the reading of it be
comes as automatic as the
reading of the editorial page.
Out of our campuses come
most of this country's leader
ship, and much of that of the
world.
I would not at all be embar
rassed if the Daily were to in

itiate this project;
)ust give me a decent forum.
I, myself, have at least six or
seven plans for saving human
ity or some part of it.

Racism
Three cheers for Craig
Richards who spoke out force
fully against racism (Daily,
Nov. 21). Like Richards, I rarely
write letters to the editor. But I
think he is absolutely right that
there is a rising climate of hos
tility toward non-whites in
America, a fact that I find
thoroughly horrifying.
The brunt of this falls hardest
on blacks. We read of cross
burnings and Klan marches.
Racist graffiti appears at Stan
ford. Cocktail conversation in
cludes racist jokes.
Home run king Hank Aaron
received 950,000 pieces of mail
while pursuing Babe Ruth's
home run record, and fully half
of that was hate mail.
There must be a few of us left
who still care about civil rights
and racial equality. Let's refuse
to be passive or apathetic in the
face of racism. Let's join Craig
Richards and be loudly vocal
about putting an end to this
garbage.
