# Exhibits revive spirit of Christmas past
## 
### Dean Eyre Senior staff writer 
Longing for a change of pace from
the shopping-center yuletide? How*
about an alternative to the all-too
trequent pizza or Jack's run? If either or
both of these appeals to you, plan to
visit the New Ways Holidays Fair today
and tomorrow in front of Tresidder
Union between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
The holiday crunch is upon us. Major
stores have already begun assaulting us
with jingle-bell jingles and hard-sell
sales to break down our resistance from
the day after Thanksgiving (traditionally
the heaviest shopping day of the year)
right through to the last after-Christmas
sale.
But the Scrooge of commercialism
hasn't won out yet â€” the spirit of
Christmas past, featuring old
fashioned cooking and homemade

crafts, will be revived courtesy of sev
eral campus and Palo Alto groups.
John Eaton, energy programs coor
dinator of the Energy Conservation
Center in Crothers Hall, explained that
the event originated from a SWOPSI
course, "Energy Conservation as an
Energy Resource," that Karl Johnson
taught a couple of years ago. Johnson is
the director of the ECC and, along with
Eaton, plans many energy-saving ac
tivities here.
The main purpose of the event, ac
cording to Eaton, is to "make people
more aware of products and their effect
on the environment." Ideally, he ad
ded, people can appreciate "getting
away from the Bank Americard, Mas
tercharge Christmas where you charge
it up, throw it on your card and worry
about paying later."
Funding for the two-day event has

come from the Office of Student Ac
tivities, SCIRE, ASSU Program fees, ECC
and some of the University's living
groups.
The fair doesn't profit from the pub
lic's participation, so donations must
be solicited to cover incurred ex
penses.
The philosophy behind this financial
situation is that "It's not possible to get
people as actively involved" when you
charge admission and high prices on
items, Eaton said. The whole point of
presenting the homemade projects is
"to draw people into the learning pro
cess and give people a craft, to get them
involved without making them feel ob
ligated" to buy things or donate
money, he explained.
Co-op houses, particularly Synergy
and Columbae, have contributed to the
fair in the past by supplying volunteers

and materials.
"More living groups will participate
this year," Eaton said. "Synergy is doing
candlemaking and granola and yogurt
recipes. Columbae is baking bread and
making Christmas cards and decora
tions, Junipero will teach origami (the
Japanese art of paper folding) and the
Italian House will be singing Italian folk
songs. Hammarskjold will be doing cap
knitting and Terra House will roast
chestnuts and make soap."
Besides the living groups, demonst
rations will be offered by other organi
zations. The Women's Center here will
practice quiltmaking, and the Palo Alto
Senior Center and Palo Alto Commun
ity Gardens will both have booths. The
ASSU Recycling Center will have a pre
sentation and Co-Evolution Quarterly
will display books and posters.

Columbae's solar oven will be one of many displays featured at the
New Ways Holidays Fair, running from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. today and
tomorrow in front of Tresidder. The oven gathers the sun's heat with
foil-covered panels and reflects onto a black heating chamber.
