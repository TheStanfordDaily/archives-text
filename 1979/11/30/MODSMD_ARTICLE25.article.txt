# Teacher 'transforms' pupils
## 
### 
Chicago (AP) — In a shabby
West Side neighborhood
where the lessons of the street
are considered more relevant
than those of the classroom,
Marva Collins is changing
things.
She runs a private school for
some 50 children in an all
black, poverty-level area of
rundown multi-family apart
ments. Another 400 children
are on a waiting list.
")ust looking at the faces of
children in this area makes one
cry," said Collins, 42. "They
come home at the end of the
day with listless expressions
and dull eyes. The same chil
dren come here with their eyes
lit up. They metamorphose be
fore my eyes."
Five years ago, Collins and
her husband, Clarence,
scraped together their $5000
savings and bought a three
story, 24-room house in the
heart of the area. The Westside
Preparatory School was born.
Clarence Collins knocked
down walls to make space. His
wife traveled across the coun
try lecturing at workshops, her
earnings providing just
enough to keep the program
running.
After 14 years in the Chicago
public school system — "You
name it, I've taught it" — Col
lins had started to realize her
dream.
She began with 12 pupils in a
second-floor classroom in her
home. Today, she has an assis
tant, Lillian Vaughn, and about
30 children, ranging from kin
dergarten through sixth grade,
in two classrooms. Next sum
mer she plans to train five more
assistants and move into larger
quarters.
She teaches a curriculum tai
lored to produce a special kind
of education — as flexible as it
is traditional, as sophisticated
as it is basic.
"I don't expect society to
educate these children. I re
fuse all federal funds and ac
cept very few private monies,"

she said.
Indeed, Collins takes money
out of her own pocket to feed
stucJents who don't get a full
breakfast at home, buys books
and clothes for many others,
and waives the $81) monthly tui
tion lee for those parents who
can't afford it.
"The most depressing part of
this whole venture is that I've
been besieged by calls from
parents.
"They call up weeping,
'Please accept my child,' or I
receive other calls offering to
move me and start the program
in another city," she said.
Like most educators, Collins
bases her teaching on reading
skills. But her emphasis is un
yielding.
"If you can't read, you can't
do anything else," she said. "I

can't see why society finds this
so difficult to understand. )ust
about all learning branches from
that skill and almost every pro
fession today demands exact
ness.
Collins teaches exactness.
Children are drilled on voc
abulary and multiplication ta
bles. They are required to read
one book every two weeks,
memorize one poem a week
and write a composition each
day on a topic she chooses.
Collins teaches pupils of var
ious ages in the same clas
sroom because she doesn't be
lieve that learning always cor
relates with age. She works
with each child throughout the
day, allowing no pupil to get
snagged on a problem he or
she can't solve.
