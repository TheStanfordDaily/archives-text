# ON CALL
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
OK, here we are, back on the job again
after a very lonely week. Need I remind you
that I am anxiously awaiting your insistent
inquiry, your casual comment, your ruthless
rejoinder . . . just any form of feedback,
please.
This is On Call's first and only appearance
this quarter in its scheduled time slot. Next
week this column will be lost somewhere in
the inside pages of the monstrous Dead
Week issue, so keep your eyes peeled. The
proximity of exams must be literally wracking
your body, and you will certainly have a mul
titude of problems for me to solve.
Now for the second order of business and
the guiding light of this dauntless venture:
My roommate seems to be drinking a lot
more and also seems to hold it better. We Ve
discussed this because he's wondering if he's
just learning how to drink better or whether
he could have a problem. What do you think?
As an exemplary student, I try to think as
little as possible. The Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) counselors
did, however, bail me out.
Prepare yourself for this one. Your room
mate may indeed have a problem, namely an
increasing tolerance to alcohol. Despite
rumors to the contrary, drinking is not a skill
nor an acquired asset. It can be a serious and
debilitating addiction.
To place your roommate's behavior into
some perspective, try discussing these ques
tions:
Does he feel like he needs to drink to do
well in school or to get through a social situa
tion? How much time is he putting into drink

ing — thinking about it, making liquor runs,
actually imbibing? Has he been structuring
more time lately around alcoholic consump
tion? Is he drinking alone? What's he drink
ing — strictly beer and wine or serious stuff?
Does he anticipate parties as opportunities to
get blitzed? What's his history? Are recent
events a radical change in pattern? Does he
visualize more drinking as a goal? Has he ever
had a blackout, which may be an ominous
sign of alcohol dependence? Reflect on your
responses to these questions, talk openly
about your feelings on the matter and seek
professional advice if you think that al
coholism may be on an encroaching colli
sion course with your life.
Here's a relevent dilemma for the upcom
ing vacation:
I'm feeling really guilty because my parents
are putting pressure on me to go home for the
holidays, and I'd prefer to do something dif
ferent with my friends this year. Is this wrong?
Well, this may sound a little wishy-washy,
but that's typical of the preponderance of
forthright stands around here.
First of all, your wish for a change of pace is
not wrong. Your predicament is in how to
prepare your doting parents for your inde
pendence, which will not be an easy task.
You are facing a probably now familiar con
flict in values, and the first denial is the most
difficult. Talk earnestly with your parents,
and compare your values in a manner fair to
both sides. Don't present your plans as a
last-minute afterthought. Rather, offer your
ideas in a logical, organized and mature fash
ion. Try to avoid bickering, haranguing,
screaming and stubborn willfulness at all

costs, and allow your parents to gradually
adapt to your changing needs. It's natural
and right to consider your own desires, but
you should also recognize the concerns of
your parents. If there are any overriding dif
ficulties or pressures at home, such as illness,
try to give that some added weight in making
your decision.

I hope you're still there because this last
one is a doozy.
What is the origin of the term blow job? You
don't really have to blow, do youf
I agonized over this query in the library and
uncovered a few leads, anyway.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea suggested that blow
job (a.k.a. fellatio or oral stimulation of the
penis) is simply a shortened version of below
job, an observation which seemed to make a
lot of sense. But I didn't stop there. Oh, no, I
bore the stifled snickers and darting glances
of erstwhile bookworms at UGLY as I rifled
through the racks on sex. In case you're in
dire need of some quick advice, the collec
tion there is not skimpy.
Although the whole blow job is almost
nowhere to be found (it's reproachable, even
in fairly detailed sex manuals), blow alone
has a staggering portfolio of connotations,
practically all negative. I recovered a few
blurbs relevant to our quandary.
Slang and its Analogues related that the
Old English blowen or blowing originally re
ferred to a woman, without any allusion to
moral character. The word was subsequently
debased and came to mean a showy courte
san or prostitute. Among American criminal
organizations (gang bangs?), blowing was

used simply to designate a mistress. The de
rivation of blowen is extremely uncertain,
but it had at one time signified blosson;
hence, a (lower; a pet. Later, it may have
evolved from the reputation of having been
blown upon, or damned.
A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue
by an appropriately named chap, Francis
Grose, revealed that blowen or more prop
erly bloen occured in Byron's Don juan in the
sense of mistress.
Finally, A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon and
Cant said that in archaic slang to blow the
groundsels meant to use the floor for the
purpose of sexual intercourse. To blow the
gag actually signified to blow off the
metaphoric impediment which keeps one's
mouth closed.
Has this given you some clues? In all can
dor, I'm not an expert in lexicology, and I'll
gladly abandon further searchers to more
knowledgeable linguists.
On your second point: Assuredly, one
does not blow. Of course, you could try, but I
wouldn't guarantee any degree of success.
Instead, Dr. David Reuben recommends in
Everything You Always Wanted to Know
About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask, the old
standby, that one kiss, lick or suck a partner's
penis to invoke the appropriate response. I
trust that issue is clarified.
Unitl next time, in the words of a once
revered sot, keep those cards and letters
coming.
