# Move to save Yosemite Park

### 
Yosemite National Park (AP)
— The headquarters of Yose
mite National Park and the
main offices of the park's chief
concessioner — involving
more than 1000 workers — will
be moved to Wawona on the
southern edge of the park
within two years, National Park
Service Director William Wha
len said last Wednesday.
The move signals a sharp
switch from plans announced
years ago that the facilities
would be shifted to El Portal
outside the park's western
boundary.
Whalen plans to announce
the details of a trend-setting
master plan for Yosemite
which officials hope will re
duce commercialization in the
park.
The plan, hailed in advance
by conservationists, is ex
pected to set policy to reverse
environmental damage caused
by years of development which
tended to increase man's im
pact on the granite wonder
land 200 miles east of San Fran
cisco.
The NPS master plan will
take Yosemite to the threshold
of the 21st century and affect
the future of other NPS pre
serves as well.
The blueprint, to be an
nounced in the dramatic set
ting of Yosemite Valley itself by
Whalen, will carry 760,900-acre
Yosemite into its second cen
tury as a national park.
