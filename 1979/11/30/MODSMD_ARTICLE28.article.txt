# Classroom lights burn too long, survey shows
## 
### Dean Eyre Senior staff writer 
Whether it's higher utility
bills or gas lines, changes in
price and availability of energy
affect us all. The University is
no exception — along with in
flation, rising energy costs are
one of the main reasons for tui
tion increases.
But a group of students here
is trying to lessen the impact ol
this trend by studying and
promoting conservation in the
classroom.
Junior Bill Aiello heads an
eight-student group which has
surveyed classroom lighting
for the Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLQ) . From the data
collected in the survey, the
students found that about "50
percent of the lights left on (in

the classrooms) are lett on un
necessarily," according to
)ohn Eaton, energy programs
coordinator tor the Universi
ty's Energy Conservation
Center (ECC).
The ECC is assisting the stu
dents, many of whom are in Gil

turning off fluorescent lights . . "

Masters' Civil Engineering 170
class, Man and His Environ
ment.
According to Eaton, the
group defined "unnecessary"
as having "lights on in the clas
sroom when no one was there,

or having all ot the lights on in a
large classroom when only one
person was inside."
Considered individually, a
light bulb does not appear to
consume much energy even it
left blazing 24 hours a day.
However, Eaton estimated that

approximately 50 percent of
the University's energy expen
ditures go toward lighting
(classroom and residences)
and overall capital costs of
energy to Stanford have tripled
in the last three years.

According to an energy bul
letin prepared by Aiello and his
group, the wasted classroom
lighting "costs the University
approximately $150 per day —
$50,000 a year. This is equiva
lent to 600,000 pounds of coal
per year."
All of the classrooms, with
the exception ot the Biology
Department, Music Depart
ment and Law School rooms,
were surveyed three times a
day. Students checked the 180
rooms between noon and I
p.m., from 4 to 5 p.m. when
most classes terminate and the
peak electricity period begins,
and again between 7 and 8 p.m.
The significance of the mid
dle reading is that Pacific Gas
and Electric is nowchargingbig
users ot electricity extra, Eaton

said. The utility places a sur
charge on electricity con
sumed when overall demand is
greatest
Energy bulletins containing
preliminary findings were dis
tributed to faculty members,
who were asked to read the
brief note on the results to
their classes. In addition,
notices were placed above
light switches in classrooms, to
remind people to turn off un
needed lights, similar to the ef
fort to save water during the
drought.
Karl Johnson, director of the
ECC explained that there is a
"strong, ingrained myth about
turning otl fluorescent lights,"
for short periods of time.
Johnson said that for all practi
cal consideration, fluorescent
lights can be turned off any
time since they stay warm tor a
; short while and the conserva
tion eltort wouldn't signific
antly diminish the lile ot the
bulb.
Johnson also pointed out
that several years ago when
bulbs were relatively more ex
pensive and energy was cheap,
it was more economical to just
leave the lights on. But energy
economics have since changed
and he suggested putting tim
ers on light switches it the sav
ings can't be encouraged by
habit.
Aiello said that a follow-up
survey has been initiated to
measure the impact of the
j group's efforts in comparison
with the preliminary, or
! baseline, survey results.

Stickers encouraging students and professors to conserve on class
room lighting have been placed above many light switches. A
follow-up survey measuring the effect of the public awareness prog
ram was initiated last week by students in an ARIO project.
