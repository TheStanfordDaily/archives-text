### julie Kaufmann 
In its last meeting of the quarter
Wednesday night, the ASSU Senate
elected a first-year co-terminal can
didate to serve as parliamentarian.
In other action, Senate Chair Mark
Breier discussed the results of ques
tionnaires distributed last week to
University faculty, staff and students
as well as Senate members. The Se
nate also assigned members to work
on specific issues and considered
procedural changes.
New parliamentarian Gary Reiff, a
student in Economics and the Food
Research Institute, said that he
thinks the parliamentarian should
bring order to meetings, "but that
doesn't mean waving the book
around citing every substructure of
every law. It is my responsibility to
quietly tell Mark (Brier) that some
thing is wrong."
Reiff has worked for KZSU as an
editor and a reporter. He served as
presiding ofiicer of the National Stu
dent Congress in high school.
Sophomore Roc Blumenthal also
ran for parliamentarian.
Senators and alternates volun
teered to work on investigative task
forces concerning
athletics, academics, housing siu
dent social centers, senate re
organization and campus safety.
These assignments, outside of the
work of the Senate standing commit
tees, resulted from senate members'
responses to the question, "What
would you like to see the Senate ac
complish this year?"
Specific issues include the mascot
debate, extended hours at athletic
facilities, the housing draw and elec
tion reform.
The questionnaires were sent to
people outside of the Senate on the
basis of past association with the Se
nate and/or prominence in the Stan
ford community. Breier stressed
suggestions for the creation of an
ASSU Handbook that could be
used from year to year and
emphasized advice that the Se
nate avoid "snap" voting on "half
researched questions."
In all, the Senate received 34 out

side evaluations
in other business, Sen. Leslie Tor
vik, Rules Committee chair, reported
that the committee's proposed
communication network is undergo
ing major revision. Torvik said she
hopes that the network will be a big
program reaching out to students in
dorms, academic associations and
departments with monthly reports.
The Coffee House task force,
which was formed to investigate the
possibility of a student-run coffee
house, is now in the process of defin
ing the idea "student-run," Sen.
Dick Butterfield told the Senate. He
added that the University will soon
decide whether to split the Tresidder
food service contract. If the contract
is divided, the ASSU hopes to bid for
operation of the Coffee House.
