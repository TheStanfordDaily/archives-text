### Associated Press 
Armed forces recruiters said Wednesday
there has been no general rush to join the U.S.
military since the Iranian crisis began, but many
Army and Marine stations report enlistments up
and some attribute the gain to the tensions.
Other recruiters checked in an Associated
Press survey report they are getting more in
quiries about military service and that many of
the calls are from older men than usual and even
from some veterans.
"There's kind of a patriotic atmosphere in
both Connecticut and Western Massachusetts, '
said Marine Corps Maj. David Andriacco, one of
the few recruiters to flatly attribute a rise in
enlistments to the Iran crisis.
Andriacco said he expected 80 enlistments
this month, compared to 50 tor November I 978.
But recruiters for the Army, Navy and Air Force

in Connecticut reported no increases in enlist
ments or inquiries since Iranian militants over
ran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took Ameri
can employees hostage.
lack Muhlenbeck of the U.S Army Recruiting
Command at Fort Sheridan, 111., said, "We have
not observed any increase attributable to the
Iranian crisis."
He said enlistments nationwide for the Army
were averaging about 3500 a week, as they have
for about a year.
John McCord, a spokesman tor the Army re
cruiting center in Atlanta, said he is getting eight
to 10 calls a week from people saying they would
be willing to serve if needed in Iran. He said
most of the inquiries were from older men and
college students.
In Salt Lake City, Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class
Bill Childs attributed three re-enlistments to the
crisis.
