Senate committee decries SALT II
Washington — A report drafted by a decisive majority
ot the Senate Armed Services Committee concludes that
the SALT II treaty is unfair, unverifiable and "not in the
national security interests of the United States."
A committee majority, said by Senate sources to be
11-6 and perhaps greater, is prepared to recommend the
Senate not ratify the strategic arms limitation treaty with
the Soviet Union until major changes are made.
Although the committee's conclusion has no official
standing in the Senate ratification process, it is bound to
have a psychological impact on the embattled treaty.
Meanwhile, Frank Moore, the chief White House lob
byist on Capitol Hill, said the Senate will not be able to
complete work on the treaty until after the first of the
year. He said chances for ultimate ratification are good,
although neither supporters nor opponents currently
have the votes needed to prevail.
The Armed Services Committee had a long series of
hearings into the provisions of the pact, which ran
parallel to a similar examination conducted by the Se
nate Foreign Relations Committee.
The Foreign Relations Committee voted 9-5 to re
commend the Senate approve the pact. It said that on
balance, the accord represented a useful framework
which could be used to produce deep cuts in nuclear
arms in SALT 111. And it said Soviet compliance with its
terms was adequately verifiable.
Iran investigating shah's finances
Tehran, Iran — Iran's banks are turning over finan
cial records to a government investigating team seek
ing evidence to support Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini's accusation that the shah and his family di
verted billions ot dollars in public funds to their own
use.
The investigation is being caried out by officials of
Iran's Central Bank under the leadership of the bank's
new governor, All Reza Nobari.
At the same time, the Iranian government has filed suit
in a State Supreme Court in New York, where the shah is
undergoing medical treatment, seeking $56 billion in
damages from the shah and his wife, Empress Farah.
"We understand that the Americans and Europeans
think it wrong for us to take Americans and diplomats as
hostages," Nobari, 32, said in an interview. He took over
the Central Bank earlier this month.
"So we need documents to prove our case. . .If those
49 hostages have rights, the 35 million Iranians have
rights because the shah really plundered our country for
37 years."
None ot the documents seen bore the shah's own
signature.
Nobari said the most damaging documents would be
taken to the United Nations in New York, where a Sec
urity Council meeting on the Iran crisis is scheduled for
next Saturday night. The remainder, Nobari added,
would be sifted through and held in Tehran, awaiting the
return ot the shah tor trial — the price Iran demands for
the hostages' release.
Prosecutor named to Jordan case
Washington — At the recommendation of Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti, a special three-judge court
appointed a special prosecutor yesterday to investigate
an allegation that White House chief of staff Hamilton
Jordan used cocaine.

The court named Arthur Cristy, 56, a former U.S. at
torney in New York, to conduct the probe.
Jordan has denied ever using the illegal drug cocaine.
But in its brief order, the court said Christy should
investigate the Studio 54 charge "and any other related
or relevant allegation" of drug law violation. Christy told
reporters in New York that his investigation is not li
mited to the Studio 54 allegation, but would not elabo
rate.
White House press secretary )ody Powell said Presi
dent Jimmy Carter asked Jordan to remain as chief of
staff, and that Jordan would do so.
Jordan released a statement saying:
"I am gratified that on the basis of a 90-day investiga
tion, the attorney general has concluded that 'the matter
is so unsubstantiated the prosecution is not warranted.'
I am disappointed that because of his inability under the
Ethics Act to obtain testimony under oath, the attorney
general feels compelled to request the appointment of a
special prosecutor."
In a brief interview, Christy pledged to "conduct a
very thorough, complete, and certainly very impartial
investigation."
Pope, Orthodox leader seek unity
Istanbul, Turkey — With an embrace and "a kiss of
unity," Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Demetrius I
opened talks yesterday aimed at reuniting the Roman
Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches after nine cen
turies of discord.
"I dare to hope that this day of unity is near. Personally
I would wish it to be very near," the pope said in the
Roman Catholic Cathedral ot the Holy Spirit where he
sang his first Mass on his three-day visit to Turkey.
More than 1000 people packed the cathedral, includ
ing Patriarch Demetrius and the 12 members ot his Holy
Synod, the Orthodox Church's ruling body. The pope
said he hoped the leaders of the two largest branches of
Christianity could one day celebrate Mass at the same
altar.
The Mass climaxed a long day of traveling and papal
diplomacy in Turkey, which is 99 percent Moslem.
Activists arrested for nuke protest
Sacramento — Nine protesters who want the Rancho
Seco nuclear plant shut down scaled a four-foot fence in
front of the facility and were arrested yesterday.
The five women and four men — mostly from Sonoma
and Marin counties — were charged with trespassing
and taken to Sacramento County Jail at Elk Grove, said
Bob Radford, chief sheriff's deputy.
The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum sen
tence of six months in jail and a fine of $50 to $500.
The protesters and about 20 fellow nuclear oppo
nents, who have been in Gov. Jerry Brown's outer office
since Wednesday afternoon, want the governor to use
his emergency powers to close the Sacramento Munici
pal Utility District's nuclear plant, 25 miles southeast of
Sacramento. They claim the plant, a near-twin to the
faulty Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, is unsafe.
Following a private two-hour meeting with protesters
at the Capitol, Gray Davis, the governor's chiet of staff,
said Brown could not legally shut down Rancho Seco
unless there was a determination of immediate peril.
1954 desegregation case reopened
Topeka, Kan. — The historic Brown vs. Board of Educa
tion case, which began here 28 years ago and led to the

U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ban on racial segregation in
schools, was reopened by a federal judge yesterday after
a group of parents complained schools are not yet integ
rated.
The parents contend Topeka schools remain racially
imbalanced and cite figures that some schools have as
much as 70 percent minority enrollment.
School officials deny they have failed to carry out the
Supreme Court's desegregation order and say recent
federal investigations have dismissed charges of segre
gation in Topeka schools.
The original Brown decision struck down a 1949 Kan
sas law which allowed racial segregation of school chil
dren in some cities. In the early 19505, Kansas was one of
four states which permitted segregation, while 17 states
and the District of Columbia required segregation.
In the decision, then-Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote,
"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,"
and therefore in violation of the equal protection clause

of the 14th Amendment.

York Stock Exchange by a 4-3 margin, and trading on the
