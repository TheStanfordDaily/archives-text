# Faculty Senate forecasts finances
## 
### Kathy Bowman 
In a presentation of the long-range financial fore
cast for 1980-81 to the Faculty Senate yesterday, Pro
vost Donald Kennedy and Vice President of Business
and Finance William Massy cited the need to "tighten
the belt" in Stanford's individual departments, but
expressed optimism about the University's overall
financial strength.
"We're having trouble finding the wherewithal to
do all the things we'd like to do, but we're not having
any trouble in a fundamental sense," Massy said.
Kennedy called for imaginative use of resources,
particularly on the departmental level. He suggested
using "program quality as a lever for change," adding
that "Stanford has always been good at this."
Kennedy said that his estimations for income and
expenses over the next five years, based on the con
sumer price index and figures from Stanford's
economists, should be used as a tool in the budget to
make "a reasonable hypothesis about what we can
do."
Massy discussed possible trade-offs in the alloca
tion of funds, particularly between faculty/staff
salaries and funded improvements. He also cited

Stanford's financial strengths, including a strong en
rollment demand, good investment performance,
land, a large endowment, gift support and a strong
research faculty.
Among long-term expenses, two new categories
were introduced in the presentation: consolidation,
which encompasses growth expenses of already ex
tant programs such as programs which start on re
stricted funds, prove themselves and then move into
general funds support: and funded improvements,
which include additions to University activity, such as
the appointment of a new faculty member.
Kennedy also said that Stanford now recognizes
and plans for future plant needs which were not
acknowledged in the past: updating research labs,
meeting new building code requirements and index
ing increasing construction costs.
Among Stanford's sources of income, which in
clude endowment, gifts and indirect cost recovery
Irom federal government research grants, tuition is
highest, set at 1.5 percent above the annual con
sumer price index for next year, and 2 percent above
it for the four following years.
