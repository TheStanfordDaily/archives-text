# College basketball 1979-80: on and off the Farm
## Cards' recipe calls for brains and Belton 
### Chris Haft 
Let's play the word
association game with sports
figures and teams.

boyant, The Greatest.

puterized, Tom Landry.
Stanford's men's basketball
team: eh? Huh? What?
Like a certain candy bar, the
men's basketballers are inde
scribable, and as six consecu
tive losing seasons indicate,
they are hardly delicious
either.
But when the Cardinals open
their 1979-80 basketball season
in Colorado Springs against the
Air Force Academy tomorrow
night, they will be making their
initial effort to try and establish
a definite flavor of their own —
one that head coach Dick Di-
Biaso hopes will produce some
sweet victories.
The fifth-year coach believes
that his 15-man roster, which
includes nine returning let
termen, has the character to
create a brand of basketball
that can be associated solely
with Stanford.
"We never have had enough
depth to sustain a style of
play," DiBiaso said.
"Washington State always has
one or two 'trees' (huge
players), UCLA has its press,
and USC its quickness. Now
we like to think we can have an
identifiable style of play."
The style DiBiaso envisions
for the Cards is similar to that
displayed by the football team.
It incorporates multiple of
fenses and constantly chang
ing defenses, thusenablingthe
Cards to "take advantage of
our intelligence so we know
exactly what we want to do," in

Dißiaso's words.
The ideal basis lor the shift
ing of tactics is an aggressive
rather than an adaptive one.
Dißiasodoes not want toadjust
to the opponent's game, but
instead to make strategic ver
satility the essential part of
Stanford's style.
"We'll do anything we can to
dictate the tempo of the
game," Dißiasosaid. "Wewant
the other team to know that
(for example), even if we don't
fast break, they'll have to work
on defense to stop us."
Last season the 12-15 Cards
usually stopped themselves,
suffering at ditferent times
from a lack of rebounding
(Stanford was outrebounded
in 10 of its 12 Pacific-10 Confer
ence losses last season), de
fense (Oregon State shot a
school-record 71.1 percent
against the Cards in one rout)
and injuries (captain Paul
Giovacchim missed much of
the late season, and forward
Kimberly Belton played with
constant aches and pains).
These problems particularly
plagued Stanford on the road,
where it won just two of 13 de
cisions. This season it is im
perative that the Cards become
more relaxed and comfortable
as visitors, tor that is the role
they play in four of their first six
conference games.
Yet win or lose, the Cards
have rarely shown a lack ol
hustle, and this year ought to
be no exception. "Our team
will again be characterized by
high intensity and hard play
ing," Dißiaso said.
And nobody sustains a
higher level of intensity or a
harder style of play than Bel
ton, an Associated Press All-

America honorable mention
pertormer a year ago.
The Cards' bruising senior
power forward sank 164 of 265
field goal attempts in 1978-79
for a school-record 61.9 shoot
ing percentage. With averages
of 14.3 points and 8.7 rebounds
a game, Belton rose to tourth
place on Stanford's career re
bounding ladder (700) and
ninth on the Card all-time scor
ing list (1128).
The 6-toot-7, 220-pound Bel
ton is more than capable of
holding his own and even
dominating bigger men inside.
In fact, Belton does every
thing big, including missing
tree throws. While Pac-IO for
wards might have been ter
rorized by Belton's ceaselessly
aggressive play, Dißiaso and
Card basketball tans were hor
rified by Belton's gross in
adequacies at the charity
stripe. He hit just 42.6 percent
of 136 free-throw shots.
What the Cards need from
Belton more than successful
free-throw shooting, however,
is his leadership. A dynamic
personality on the court, Bel
ton captained the U.S. squad
which toured the Republic of
China last spring, and Dißiaso
counts on him to continue that
direction.
Belton will be greatly aided
in his scoring responsibilities
by 6-7 sophomore Brian
Welch, who tallied 11.6 points
per game last year to lead all
Pac-10 freshmen.
Dißiaso, making a rare (tor
him) radical change, has
moved Welch from forward to
guard. Dißiaso believes

As Kimherly Helton goes, so go the Stanford Cardinals. The senior has
proven to he an on-court leader through his play and through his
emotion, as shown here. The 6-foot-7, 220-pounder's specialties are
as a power forward and rebounding.
outside shooting give him
enough tools to become a suc
cessful backcourt man.
Welch's departure from for
ward also gives more playing
time to frontcourt men Or
lando Ward and Jeff Ryan.
Welch's arrival at guard re
lieves Dißiaso of the uncer
tainty existing at that spot with
Mark Pitchford's troubled back
and Doug Barnes and Terry
Smith's inexperience.
Whippet-quick senior
Daryle Morgan joins Welch in
the backcourt and will handle
the majority of the ballhandl
ing responsibilities.
The 6-0 Morgan, annually the
team's most popular player
with the fans, has been suffer
ing from a stress foot fracture.
Though Dißiaso said that Mor
gan's status is a "day-to-day
thing," the El Cerrito native will
make today's trip to Colorado
Springs.
Sophomore forward Ward
and senior center Tom
Schmalzried complete Stan
ford's starting lineup. As a
freshman, the 6-7 Ward came
on strong at the end of last sea
son, scoring a career-high 16
points against USC in the next
to-last game.
Ward's raw talent, man
ifested in his fine jumping abil
ity, is evident. What has not
been so evident in recent
years, however, is Schmal
zried's ability.
After providing promise as a
freshman and mostly disap
pointment as a sophomore,

Schmalzried came back last
year with a little of both. The
6-11 pivotman was remem
bered equally well for his fine
outings (19 points, 13 re
bounds against Santa Clara)
and his dismal ones (zero
points, one rebound against
both Seton Hall and Oregon
State).
Dißiaso's comments about
Schmalzried are tinged with
typical early-season optimism.
"He's always had the poten
tial to do well," Dißiaso said.
With the presence of 6-10
freshman center David
Nussbaum, Schmalzried has
had a big man to work against
in practice for the first time in
his four years here, which
ought to help him play more
like a center should.
Sophomore Doug Marty cur
rently stands as the first point
guard substitute behind Mor
gan, with Barnes as the top
man behind Welch. Pitchford,
Smith and Peter Lallas are also
ready for backcourt duty.
Ryan, whose last-second
tip-in beat UCLA last year, is
the third forward, where junior
Steve Crandell also plays.
Nussbaum, who Dißiaso said
still has to adjust to playing
with 14 new teammates, backs
up Schmalzried.
Dißiaso picks Oregon State
and UCLA to battle for the top
two spots in the Pac-10, with
the remainder of the league
pushing and shoving each
other for an upper-division
berth.

Though Dißiaso said that Mor

Sophomore forward Ward
and senior center Tom
Schmalzried complete Stan
ford's starting lineup. As a
freshman, the 6-7 Ward came
on strong at the end of last sea
son, scoring a career-high 16
points against USC in the next
to-last game.
Ward's raw talent, man
ifested in his fine jumping abil
ity, is evident. What has not
been so evident in recent
years, however, is Schmal
zried's ability.
After providing promise as a
freshman and mostly disap
pointment as a sophomore,

Schmalzried came back last
year with a little of both. The
6-11 pivotman was remem
bered equally well for his fine
outings (19 points, 13 re
bounds against Santa Clara)
and his dismal ones (zero
points, one rebound against
both Seton Hall and Oregon
State).
Dißiaso's comments about
Schmalzried are tinged with
typical early-season optimism.
"He's always had the poten
tial to do well," Dißiaso said.
With the presence of 6-10
freshman center David
Nussbaum, Schmalzried has
had a big man to work against
in practice for the first time in
his four years here, which
ought to help him play more
like a center should.
Sophomore Doug Marty cur
rently stands as the first point
guard substitute behind Mor
gan, with Barnes as the top
man behind Welch. Pitchford,
Smith and Peter Lallas are also
ready for backcourt duty.
Ryan, whose last-second
tip-in beat UCLA last year, is
the third forward, where junior
Steve Crandell also plays.
Nussbaum, who Dißiaso said
still has to adjust to playing
with 14 new teammates, backs
up Schmalzried.
Dißiaso picks Oregon State
and UCLA to battle for the top
two spots in the Pac-10, with
the remainder of the league
pushing and shoving each
other for an upper-division
berth.

Stanford's men's basketball
team: eh? Huh? What?
Like a certain candy bar, the
men's basketballers are inde
scribable, and as six consecu
tive losing seasons indicate,
they are hardly delicious
either.
But when the Cardinals open
their 1979-80 basketball season
in Colorado Springs against the
Air Force Academy tomorrow
night, they will be making their
initial effort to try and establish
a definite flavor of their own —
one that head coach Dick Di-
Biaso hopes will produce some
sweet victories.
The fifth-year coach believes
that his 15-man roster, which
includes nine returning let
termen, has the character to
create a brand of basketball
that can be associated solely
with Stanford.
"We never have had enough
depth to sustain a style of
play," DiBiaso said.
"Washington State always has
one or two 'trees' (huge
players), UCLA has its press,
and USC its quickness. Now
we like to think we can have an
identifiable style of play."
The style DiBiaso envisions
for the Cards is similar to that
displayed by the football team.
It incorporates multiple of
fenses and constantly chang
ing defenses, thusenablingthe
Cards to "take advantage of
our intelligence so we know
exactly what we want to do," in

Dißiaso's words.
The ideal basis lor the shift
ing of tactics is an aggressive
rather than an adaptive one.
Dißiasodoes not want toadjust
to the opponent's game, but
instead to make strategic ver
satility the essential part of
Stanford's style.
"We'll do anything we can to
dictate the tempo of the
game," Dißiasosaid. "Wewant
the other team to know that
(for example), even if we don't
fast break, they'll have to work
on defense to stop us."
Last season the 12-15 Cards
usually stopped themselves,
suffering at ditferent times
from a lack of rebounding
(Stanford was outrebounded
in 10 of its 12 Pacific-10 Confer
ence losses last season), de
fense (Oregon State shot a
school-record 71.1 percent
against the Cards in one rout)
and injuries (captain Paul
Giovacchim missed much of
the late season, and forward
Kimberly Belton played with
constant aches and pains).
These problems particularly
plagued Stanford on the road,
where it won just two of 13 de
cisions. This season it is im
perative that the Cards become
more relaxed and comfortable
as visitors, tor that is the role
they play in four of their first six
conference games.
Yet win or lose, the Cards
have rarely shown a lack ol
hustle, and this year ought to
be no exception. "Our team
will again be characterized by
high intensity and hard play
ing," Dißiaso said.
And nobody sustains a
higher level of intensity or a
harder style of play than Bel
ton, an Associated Press All-

America honorable mention
pertormer a year ago.
The Cards' bruising senior
power forward sank 164 of 265
field goal attempts in 1978-79
for a school-record 61.9 shoot
ing percentage. With averages
of 14.3 points and 8.7 rebounds
a game, Belton rose to tourth
place on Stanford's career re
bounding ladder (700) and
ninth on the Card all-time scor
ing list (1128).
The 6-toot-7, 220-pound Bel
ton is more than capable of
holding his own and even
dominating bigger men inside.
In fact, Belton does every
thing big, including missing
tree throws. While Pac-IO for
wards might have been ter
rorized by Belton's ceaselessly
aggressive play, Dißiaso and
Card basketball tans were hor
rified by Belton's gross in
adequacies at the charity
stripe. He hit just 42.6 percent
of 136 free-throw shots.
What the Cards need from
Belton more than successful
free-throw shooting, however,
is his leadership. A dynamic
personality on the court, Bel
ton captained the U.S. squad
which toured the Republic of
China last spring, and Dißiaso
counts on him to continue that
direction.
Belton will be greatly aided
in his scoring responsibilities
by 6-7 sophomore Brian
Welch, who tallied 11.6 points
per game last year to lead all
Pac-10 freshmen.

high intensity and hard play
ing," Dißiaso said.
And nobody sustains a
higher level of intensity or a
harder style of play than Bel
ton, an Associated Press All-

America honorable mention
pertormer a year ago.
The Cards' bruising senior
power forward sank 164 of 265
field goal attempts in 1978-79
for a school-record 61.9 shoot
ing percentage. With averages
of 14.3 points and 8.7 rebounds
a game, Belton rose to tourth
place on Stanford's career re
bounding ladder (700) and
ninth on the Card all-time scor
ing list (1128).
The 6-toot-7, 220-pound Bel
ton is more than capable of
holding his own and even
dominating bigger men inside.
In fact, Belton does every
thing big, including missing
tree throws. While Pac-IO for
wards might have been ter
rorized by Belton's ceaselessly
aggressive play, Dißiaso and
Card basketball tans were hor
rified by Belton's gross in
adequacies at the charity
stripe. He hit just 42.6 percent
of 136 free-throw shots.
What the Cards need from
Belton more than successful
free-throw shooting, however,
is his leadership. A dynamic
personality on the court, Bel
ton captained the U.S. squad
which toured the Republic of
China last spring, and Dißiaso
counts on him to continue that
direction.
Belton will be greatly aided
in his scoring responsibilities
by 6-7 sophomore Brian
Welch, who tallied 11.6 points
per game last year to lead all
Pac-10 freshmen.

As Kimherly Helton goes, so go the Stanford Cardinals. The senior has
proven to he an on-court leader through his play and through his
emotion, as shown here. The 6-foot-7, 220-pounder's specialties are
as a power forward and rebounding.
outside shooting give him
enough tools to become a suc
cessful backcourt man.
Welch's departure from for
ward also gives more playing
time to frontcourt men Or
lando Ward and Jeff Ryan.
Welch's arrival at guard re
lieves Dißiaso of the uncer
tainty existing at that spot with
Mark Pitchford's troubled back
and Doug Barnes and Terry
Smith's inexperience.
Whippet-quick senior
Daryle Morgan joins Welch in
the backcourt and will handle
the majority of the ballhandl
ing responsibilities.
The 6-0 Morgan, annually the
team's most popular player
with the fans, has been suffer
ing from a stress foot fracture.
Though Dißiaso said that Mor
gan's status is a "day-to-day
thing," the El Cerrito native will
make today's trip to Colorado
Springs.
Sophomore forward Ward
and senior center Tom
Schmalzried complete Stan
ford's starting lineup. As a
freshman, the 6-7 Ward came
on strong at the end of last sea
son, scoring a career-high 16
points against USC in the next
to-last game.
Ward's raw talent, man
ifested in his fine jumping abil
ity, is evident. What has not
been so evident in recent
years, however, is Schmal
zried's ability.
After providing promise as a
freshman and mostly disap
pointment as a sophomore,

Schmalzried came back last
year with a little of both. The
6-11 pivotman was remem
bered equally well for his fine
outings (19 points, 13 re
bounds against Santa Clara)
and his dismal ones (zero
points, one rebound against
both Seton Hall and Oregon
State).
Dißiaso's comments about
Schmalzried are tinged with
typical early-season optimism.
"He's always had the poten
tial to do well," Dißiaso said.
With the presence of 6-10
freshman center David
Nussbaum, Schmalzried has
had a big man to work against
in practice for the first time in
his four years here, which
ought to help him play more
like a center should.
Sophomore Doug Marty cur
rently stands as the first point
guard substitute behind Mor
gan, with Barnes as the top
man behind Welch. Pitchford,
Smith and Peter Lallas are also
ready for backcourt duty.
Ryan, whose last-second
tip-in beat UCLA last year, is
the third forward, where junior
Steve Crandell also plays.
Nussbaum, who Dißiaso said
still has to adjust to playing
with 14 new teammates, backs
up Schmalzried.
Dißiaso picks Oregon State
and UCLA to battle for the top
two spots in the Pac-10, with
the remainder of the league
pushing and shoving each
other for an upper-division
berth.
Let's play the word
association game with sports
figures and teams.
Muhammad Ali: loud, flam
boyant, The Greatest.
Dallas Cowboys: cold, com
puterized, Tom Landry.
Stanford's men's basketball
team: eh? Huh? What?
Like a certain candy bar, the
men's basketballers are inde
scribable, and as six consecu
tive losing seasons indicate,
they are hardly delicious
either.
But when the Cardinals open
their 1979-80 basketball season
in Colorado Springs against the
Air Force Academy tomorrow
night, they will be making their
initial effort to try and establish
a definite flavor of their own —
one that head coach Dick Di-
Biaso hopes will produce some
sweet victories.
The fifth-year coach believes
that his 15-man roster, which
includes nine returning let
termen, has the character to
create a brand of basketball
that can be associated solely
with Stanford.
"We never have had enough
depth to sustain a style of
play," DiBiaso said.
"Washington State always has
one or two 'trees' (huge
players), UCLA has its press,
and USC its quickness. Now
we like to think we can have an
identifiable style of play."
The style DiBiaso envisions
for the Cards is similar to that
displayed by the football team.
It incorporates multiple of
fenses and constantly chang
ing defenses, thusenablingthe
Cards to "take advantage of
our intelligence so we know
exactly what we want to do," in

Dißiaso's words.
The ideal basis lor the shift
ing of tactics is an aggressive
rather than an adaptive one.
Dißiasodoes not want toadjust
to the opponent's game, but
instead to make strategic ver
satility the essential part of
Stanford's style.
"We'll do anything we can to
dictate the tempo of the
game," Dißiasosaid. "Wewant
the other team to know that
(for example), even if we don't
fast break, they'll have to work
on defense to stop us."
Last season the 12-15 Cards
usually stopped themselves,
suffering at ditferent times
from a lack of rebounding
(Stanford was outrebounded
in 10 of its 12 Pacific-10 Confer
ence losses last season), de
fense (Oregon State shot a
school-record 71.1 percent
against the Cards in one rout)
and injuries (captain Paul
Giovacchim missed much of
the late season, and forward
Kimberly Belton played with
constant aches and pains).
These problems particularly
plagued Stanford on the road,
where it won just two of 13 de
cisions. This season it is im
perative that the Cards become
more relaxed and comfortable
as visitors, tor that is the role
they play in four of their first six
conference games.
Yet win or lose, the Cards
have rarely shown a lack ol
hustle, and this year ought to
be no exception. "Our team
will again be characterized by
high intensity and hard play
ing," Dißiaso said.
And nobody sustains a
higher level of intensity or a
harder style of play than Bel
ton, an Associated Press All-
