# College basketball 1979-80: on and off the Farm
## Cards' recipe calls for brains and Belton

Let's play the word
association game with sports
figures and teams.
Muhammad Ali: loud, flam
boyant, The Greatest.
Dallas Cowboys: cold, com
puterized, Tom Landry.
Stanford's men's basketball
team: eh? Huh? What?
Like a certain candy bar, the
men's basketballers are inde
scribable, and as six consecu
tive losing seasons indicate,
they are hardly delicious
either.
But when the Cardinals open
their 1979-80 basketball season
in Colorado Springs against the
Air Force Academy tomorrow
night, they will be making their
initial effort to try and establish
a definite flavor of their own —
one that head coach Dick Di-
Biaso hopes will produce some
sweet victories.
The fifth-year coach believes
that his 15-man roster, which
includes nine returning let
termen, has the character to
create a brand of basketball
that can be associated solely
with Stanford.
"We never have had enough
depth to sustain a style of
play," DiBiaso said.
"Washington State always has
one or two 'trees' (huge
players), UCLA has its press,
and USC its quickness. Now
we like to think we can have an
identifiable style of play."
The style DiBiaso envisions
for the Cards is similar to that
displayed by the football team.
It incorporates multiple of
fenses and constantly chang
ing defenses, thusenablingthe
Cards to "take advantage of
our intelligence so we know
exactly what we want to do," in

Dißiaso's words.
The ideal basis lor the shift
ing of tactics is an aggressive
rather than an adaptive one.
Dißiasodoes not want toadjust
to the opponent's game, but
instead to make strategic ver
satility the essential part of
Stanford's style.
"We'll do anything we can to
dictate the tempo of the
game," Dißiasosaid. "Wewant
the other team to know that
(for example), even if we don't
fast break, they'll have to work
on defense to stop us."
Last season the 12-15 Cards
usually stopped themselves,
suffering at ditferent times
from a lack of rebounding
(Stanford was outrebounded
in 10 of its 12 Pacific-10 Confer
ence losses last season), de
fense (Oregon State shot a
school-record 71.1 percent
against the Cards in one rout)
and injuries (captain Paul
Giovacchim missed much of
the late season, and forward
Kimberly Belton played with
constant aches and pains).
These problems particularly
plagued Stanford on the road,
where it won just two of 13 de
cisions. This season it is im
perative that the Cards become
more relaxed and comfortable
as visitors, tor that is the role
they play in four of their first six
conference games.
Yet win or lose, the Cards
have rarely shown a lack ol
hustle, and this year ought to
be no exception. "Our team
will again be characterized by
high intensity and hard play
ing," Dißiaso said.
And nobody sustains a
higher level of intensity or a
harder style of play than Bel
ton, an Associated Press All-

America honorable mention
pertormer a year ago.
The Cards' bruising senior
power forward sank 164 of 265
field goal attempts in 1978-79
for a school-record 61.9 shoot
ing percentage. With averages
of 14.3 points and 8.7 rebounds
a game, Belton rose to tourth
place on Stanford's career re
bounding ladder (700) and
ninth on the Card all-time scor
ing list (1128).
The 6-toot-7, 220-pound Bel
ton is more than capable of
holding his own and even
dominating bigger men inside.
In fact, Belton does every
thing big, including missing
tree throws. While Pac-IO for
wards might have been ter
rorized by Belton's ceaselessly
aggressive play, Dißiaso and
Card basketball tans were hor
rified by Belton's gross in
adequacies at the charity
stripe. He hit just 42.6 percent
of 136 free-throw shots.
What the Cards need from
Belton more than successful
free-throw shooting, however,
is his leadership. A dynamic
personality on the court, Bel
ton captained the U.S. squad
which toured the Republic of
China last spring, and Dißiaso
counts on him to continue that
direction.
Belton will be greatly aided
in his scoring responsibilities
by 6-7 sophomore Brian
Welch, who tallied 11.6 points
per game last year to lead all
Pac-10 freshmen.
Dißiaso, making a rare (tor
him) radical change, has
moved Welch from forward to
guard. Dißiaso believes
Welch's adequate ballhandl
ing, sure passing and excellent

Sophomore Brian Welch (35) will be moving from forward to guard
tomorrow night when Stanford opens their season at Air Force. The
Idaho native is moving because of a wealth of talent at the former
sosition and a death at the latter.

As Kimherly Helton goes, so go the Stanford Cardinals. The senior has
proven to he an on-court leader through his play and through his
emotion, as shown here. The 6-foot-7, 220-pounder's specialties are
as a power forward and rebounding.
