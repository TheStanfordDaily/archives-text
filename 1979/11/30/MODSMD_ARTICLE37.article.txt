# Ruark heads main show
## SPORTS 
### Richard Martinez 
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team brings its show to
Maples Pavilion this Saturday
night lor its opening perfor
mance of the 1979-80 season
against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. And when I say show,
I mean show.
Promising a more enjoyable
sequel than /<iws 2 or Beyond
the Planet of the Apes, this
year's cast should provide even
more action and entertainment
for its audience than last year's
performances. Like any class
act, the Cards have the talent
and the production staff to
make sure the show runs
smoothly.
The "Jeanne and Angie
Show" of last season will cer
tainly be reworked to include a
more star-studded cast this
year. First-team All Conference
last year, sophomores Jeanne
Ruark and Angie Paccione have
been assigned different roles
that should complement their
respective skills.
Ruark, the team captain and
most consistent performer,
has been moved to a wing posi
tion where she will be able to
better exhibit her accurate
perimeter shooting.
Averaging 21.3 points per
game last season while hitting
64 percent of her shots, Ruark
hopes to continue her offen
sive onslaught this year.

Coach Dotty McCrea called
Paccione the most improved
player on the team. That
should give plenty of reason
for her Northern California
Athletic Conference oppo
nents to worry. Paccione aver
aged 12 points per game last
year and her tlashy, aggressive
style of play contrasts well with
Ruark's smooth, steady brand
of ball.
Paccione, too, has been
moved to the wing where her
long-range accuracy will com
plement the Cards' scoring
threats underneath.
"We're much more of a scor
ing threat this year and the
main reason is Angie's move
from point guard to wing,"
McCrea said.
Starting in the front court
with Ruark and Paccione will
be sophomore Ann Miller and
junior Kathy Murphy. Miller, a
walk-on last year, has im
proved her speed on the court
and Murphy is playing her
tough style of defense, thus
giving the Cards some strength
under the boards.
Debi Gore, who McCrea says
has improved as much as Pac
cione, will be at point guard.
The Cards are noticeably
much deeper this year.
Sophomore Louise Smith, who
is coming off a sprained ankle,
is both a good defensive center
and a fine shooter. Meg Metz

ger, a 6-foot-1 prep All-
America, is the Cards' quickest
big player.
Coach McCrea will not hesi
tate to call on Metzger and
freshman center Kim Kupferer
(6-1) to replace her starters.
Other reserves include 5-9
sophomore Kathy Schultz, 5-10
sophomore Sue Thomas, 5-8
junior Beth Boylan, 5-5
freshman Denise McCuire, 6-1
freshman Leigh Pederson and
6-1 freshman Mary Osborne.
Not only is there an im
provement in the talent of the
squad, but McCrea also says
she has changed her attitude
toward the team.
"I believe I've changed," she
said. "I am more tolerant of
their mistakes now. I'm saying
less now that the girls are
older. They've been given a
loundation; now they can be
creative on the court and com
bine their natural abilities with
what they have been taught.
We will not be concerned with
whom we play. We will try to
perfect our performance on
the court every time we go on
the floor. It doesn't matter
whether we play UCLA or
UC-Davis, we'll worry about
our performance — not how
tough the other team is."
So the rehearsals are just
about over. The cast and the
directors are confident of their
abilities.

giving the Cards some strength
under the boards.
Debi Gore, who McCrea says
has improved as much as Pac
cione, will be at point guard.
The Cards are noticeably
much deeper this year.
Sophomore Louise Smith, who
is coming off a sprained ankle,
is both a good defensive center
and a fine shooter. Meg Metz

ger, a 6-foot-1 prep All-
America, is the Cards' quickest
big player.
Coach McCrea will not hesi
tate to call on Metzger and
freshman center Kim Kupferer
(6-1) to replace her starters.
Other reserves include 5-9
sophomore Kathy Schultz, 5-10
sophomore Sue Thomas, 5-8
junior Beth Boylan, 5-5
freshman Denise McCuire, 6-1
freshman Leigh Pederson and
6-1 freshman Mary Osborne.
Not only is there an im
provement in the talent of the
squad, but McCrea also says
she has changed her attitude
toward the team.
"I believe I've changed," she
said. "I am more tolerant of
their mistakes now. I'm saying
less now that the girls are
older. They've been given a
loundation; now they can be
creative on the court and com
bine their natural abilities with
what they have been taught.
We will not be concerned with
whom we play. We will try to
perfect our performance on
the court every time we go on
the floor. It doesn't matter
whether we play UCLA or
UC-Davis, we'll worry about
our performance — not how
tough the other team is."
So the rehearsals are just
about over. The cast and the
directors are confident of their
abilities.

Angie Paccione, one of Stanford's three sophomore musketeers, will
lead the Cards in their home opener tomorrow night against Cal
Poly-SLO. The slick hall-handling guard is the team's on-court quar
terback from her backcourt position.
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team brings its show to
Maples Pavilion this Saturday
night lor its opening perfor
mance of the 1979-80 season
against Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. And when I say show,
I mean show.
Promising a more enjoyable
sequel than /<iws 2 or Beyond
the Planet of the Apes, this
year's cast should provide even
more action and entertainment
for its audience than last year's
performances. Like any class
act, the Cards have the talent
and the production staff to
make sure the show runs
smoothly.
The "Jeanne and Angie
Show" of last season will cer
tainly be reworked to include a
more star-studded cast this
year. First-team All Conference
last year, sophomores Jeanne
Ruark and Angie Paccione have
been assigned different roles
that should complement their
respective skills.
Ruark, the team captain and
most consistent performer,
has been moved to a wing posi
tion where she will be able to
better exhibit her accurate
perimeter shooting.
Averaging 21.3 points per
game last season while hitting
64 percent of her shots, Ruark
hopes to continue her offen
sive onslaught this year.

Coach Dotty McCrea called
Paccione the most improved
player on the team. That
should give plenty of reason
for her Northern California
Athletic Conference oppo
nents to worry. Paccione aver
aged 12 points per game last
year and her tlashy, aggressive
style of play contrasts well with
Ruark's smooth, steady brand
of ball.
Paccione, too, has been
moved to the wing where her
long-range accuracy will com
plement the Cards' scoring
threats underneath.
"We're much more of a scor
ing threat this year and the
main reason is Angie's move
from point guard to wing,"
McCrea said.
Starting in the front court
with Ruark and Paccione will
be sophomore Ann Miller and
junior Kathy Murphy. Miller, a
walk-on last year, has im
proved her speed on the court
and Murphy is playing her
tough style of defense, thus
giving the Cards some strength
under the boards.
Debi Gore, who McCrea says
has improved as much as Pac
cione, will be at point guard.
