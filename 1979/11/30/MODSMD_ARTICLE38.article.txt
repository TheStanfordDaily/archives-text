# Purdue's Carroll tops heady crop of hoop stars
## 
### Associated Press 
Last year, )oe Barry Carroll
was mobile and agile. This
year, Lee Rose hopes he'll be
hostile, too.
"This may be hard to be
lieve,'' says the Purdue coach,
"but one of the things |oe Barry
has to learn is to be more phys
ical He's going to have to learn
to go to the basket better."
But even with that alleged
shortcoming, Carroll is clearly
one of the country's best col
legiate centers, a potential
gamebreaker who moves like a
forward and shoots like a
guard.
This 7-footer will be among
the nation's most watchable
players during the 1979-80 col
lege basketball season which
opens full-tilt tonight.
The player they call "Rocky
Mountain High" in deference
to his Denver origins is among
a high-profile group of
trontcourt players whose faces
should be as familiar on the na
tional scene this season as
Larry Bird's and Earvin
lohnson's were last season.
These include, among
others, Mike O'Koren of North
Carolina, Louisiana State's
DeWayne Scales, Notre
Dame's Kelly Tripucka, Rudy
Woods of Texas A&M, De-

Paul's Mark Aguirre, Mike
Gminski of Duke, Herb Wil
liams of Ohio State, Michael
Brooks of La Salle and Vir
ginia's Ralph Sampson, the un
tested freshman with enorm
ous potential.
The 6-7 O'Koren is a versatile
player. He compares favorably
with other great forwards in
the history of North Carolina, a
school that has produced the
likes of Bobby )ones and Wal
ter Davis.
"He is the most fundamen
tally sound player in the col
lege game today," says Wake
Forest coach Carl Tacy.
The 6-9 Scales carries the
nickname of "Astronaut" for
an obvious reason: he concen
trates his game at heights that a
lot of players don't reach.
Scales plays a lot with his
shoulders above the nm and
his slam-dunks usually bring
down the house, to say no
thing of an occasional
backboard.
Tripucka comes from a fam
ily of talented basketball
players and appears to be the
best of the brood. As a junior,
Tripucka is the acknowledged
big shot of Digger Phelps'
team. At 6-7 and 215 pounds,
Tripucka is by no means the
biggest man on the floor, but

easily one of the toughest.
"I don't play dirty," Tripucka
admits, "but I do rough it up."
The 6-11, 210-pound Woods
is only in his sophomore sea
son but already there is talk of
his potential to be the greatest
player ever in the Southwest
Conference. He is starting to
dominate the league in much
the same manner that )im
Krebs did at SMU in the 1950s
and Texas Tech's Rick Bullock
in the 19705.
DePaul coach Ray Meyer
calls Aguirre perhaps "the best
all-around ballplayer to come
to DePaul." Aguirre's game is
generally compared to Adrian
Dantley, the one-time Notre
Dame great, mostly because of
their similar stocky appear
ances and highly-physical
styles.
Gminski, 6-11, is recognized
as one of the best outside
shooting big men in the col
lege game. Quick, very strong
and an excellent rebounder,
Gminski'sability toplayat both
the high and low posts mak»s
him one of the country's most
versatile centers.
Williams is one of the na
tion's quickest and most dura
ble centers. The 6-11, 245-
pounder who added some

weight this season, averaged
39 minutes per game last sea
son with the Buckeyes.
Brooks is the only returning
collegiate player with more
than 1000 career points and re
bounds. He had a fine junior
year in 1978-79, averaging 23.3
points and 13.3 rebounds per
game and had an outstanding
performance in the Pan Ameri
can Games last summer.
Sampson, a 7-foot-3 center
some have compared to
Kareem Abdul-|abbar, was the
most sought-after schoolboy
player in the country this year
by the colleges. His precocity is
evident: the Virginia product
was the only high school player
selected to the 12-rnan United
States team in the Pan Am
Games.
There'll be some dominating
backcourt players in this year's
crop as well: Kyle Macy at Ken
tucky; lowa's Ronnie Lester;
Darnell Valentine of Kansas;
Darrell Griffith of Louisville;
Marquette's Sam Worthen,
and Ohio State's Kelvin Ran
sey.
The 6-3 Macy is at his best in
pressure situations and also is
one of the country's best foul
shooters. But his true value to
the Wildcats cannot be mea

sured in figures — rather in in
tangible qualities, like inspira
tional leadership.
Lester is the player most re
sponsible for the resurgence ot
lowa basketball. He is gener
ally acknowledged to be the
most consistent guard in the
Big Ten, although Ransey can
be more spectacular.
The 6-2 lowa guard is one of
the quickest and quickest
witted players in the country.
Valentine has established
himself as one of the best point
guards in college basketball.
The 6-2 junior has led the
(ayhawks in scoring, assists
and steals the past two seasons
and also has paced the Big
Eight in the latter two
categories in that time.
The 6-4 Griffith has superb
hands and exceptional speed.
But his most spectacular talent
is his leaping ability. And his
defense, once criticized, has
vastly improved over past sea
sons.
Worthen, a junior college
transfer and a New York playg
round product, is emerging as
one of the best playmakers in
the nation. He averaged seven
assists a game last season, a
Marquette record.
Last year, )oe Barry Carroll

opens full-tilt tonight.
The player they call "Rocky
Mountain High" in deference
to his Denver origins is among
a high-profile group of
trontcourt players whose faces
should be as familiar on the na
tional scene this season as
Larry Bird's and Earvin
lohnson's were last season.
These include, among
others, Mike O'Koren of North
Carolina, Louisiana State's
DeWayne Scales, Notre
Dame's Kelly Tripucka, Rudy
Woods of Texas A&M, De-

Paul's Mark Aguirre, Mike
Gminski of Duke, Herb Wil
liams of Ohio State, Michael
Brooks of La Salle and Vir
ginia's Ralph Sampson, the un
tested freshman with enorm
ous potential.
The 6-7 O'Koren is a versatile
player. He compares favorably
with other great forwards in
the history of North Carolina, a
school that has produced the
likes of Bobby )ones and Wal
ter Davis.
"He is the most fundamen
tally sound player in the col
lege game today," says Wake
Forest coach Carl Tacy.
The 6-9 Scales carries the
nickname of "Astronaut" for
an obvious reason: he concen
trates his game at heights that a
lot of players don't reach.
Scales plays a lot with his
shoulders above the nm and
his slam-dunks usually bring
down the house, to say no
thing of an occasional
backboard.
Tripucka comes from a fam
ily of talented basketball
players and appears to be the
best of the brood. As a junior,
Tripucka is the acknowledged
big shot of Digger Phelps'
team. At 6-7 and 215 pounds,
Tripucka is by no means the
biggest man on the floor, but

easily one of the toughest.
"I don't play dirty," Tripucka
admits, "but I do rough it up."
The 6-11, 210-pound Woods
is only in his sophomore sea
son but already there is talk of
his potential to be the greatest
player ever in the Southwest
Conference. He is starting to
dominate the league in much
the same manner that )im
Krebs did at SMU in the 1950s
and Texas Tech's Rick Bullock
in the 19705.
DePaul coach Ray Meyer
calls Aguirre perhaps "the best
all-around ballplayer to come
to DePaul." Aguirre's game is
generally compared to Adrian
Dantley, the one-time Notre
Dame great, mostly because of
their similar stocky appear
ances and highly-physical
styles.
Gminski, 6-11, is recognized
as one of the best outside
shooting big men in the col
lege game. Quick, very strong
and an excellent rebounder,
Gminski'sability toplayat both
the high and low posts mak»s
him one of the country's most
versatile centers.
Williams is one of the na
tion's quickest and most dura
ble centers. The 6-11, 245-
pounder who added some

weight this season, averaged
39 minutes per game last sea
son with the Buckeyes.
Brooks is the only returning
collegiate player with more
than 1000 career points and re
bounds. He had a fine junior
year in 1978-79, averaging 23.3
points and 13.3 rebounds per
game and had an outstanding
performance in the Pan Ameri
can Games last summer.
Sampson, a 7-foot-3 center
some have compared to
Kareem Abdul-|abbar, was the
most sought-after schoolboy
player in the country this year
by the colleges. His precocity is
evident: the Virginia product
was the only high school player
selected to the 12-rnan United
States team in the Pan Am
Games.
There'll be some dominating
backcourt players in this year's
crop as well: Kyle Macy at Ken
tucky; lowa's Ronnie Lester;
Darnell Valentine of Kansas;
Darrell Griffith of Louisville;
Marquette's Sam Worthen,
and Ohio State's Kelvin Ran
sey.
The 6-3 Macy is at his best in
pressure situations and also is
one of the country's best foul
shooters. But his true value to
the Wildcats cannot be mea

sured in figures — rather in in
tangible qualities, like inspira
tional leadership.
Lester is the player most re
sponsible for the resurgence ot
lowa basketball. He is gener
ally acknowledged to be the
most consistent guard in the
Big Ten, although Ransey can
be more spectacular.
The 6-2 lowa guard is one of
the quickest and quickest
witted players in the country.
Valentine has established
himself as one of the best point
guards in college basketball.
The 6-2 junior has led the
(ayhawks in scoring, assists
and steals the past two seasons
and also has paced the Big
Eight in the latter two
categories in that time.
The 6-4 Griffith has superb
hands and exceptional speed.
But his most spectacular talent
is his leaping ability. And his
defense, once criticized, has
vastly improved over past sea
sons.
Worthen, a junior college
transfer and a New York playg
round product, is emerging as
one of the best playmakers in
the nation. He averaged seven
assists a game last season, a
Marquette record.
Last year, )oe Barry Carroll
was mobile and agile. This
year, Lee Rose hopes he'll be
hostile, too.
"This may be hard to be
lieve,'' says the Purdue coach,
"but one of the things |oe Barry
has to learn is to be more phys
ical He's going to have to learn
to go to the basket better."
But even with that alleged
shortcoming, Carroll is clearly
one of the country's best col
legiate centers, a potential
gamebreaker who moves like a
forward and shoots like a
guard.
This 7-footer will be among
the nation's most watchable
players during the 1979-80 col
lege basketball season which
opens full-tilt tonight.
The player they call "Rocky
