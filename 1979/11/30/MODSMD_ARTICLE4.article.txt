# University offers advice, counsel, action
## Sexual harassment incidence low here 
### Hillary Earnest 
The University's methods for deal
ing with instances of sexual harass
ment are meeting with increasing
success, said Leah Kaplan, a
psychological counselor at Huston
House's Counselling and Psycholog
ical Services.
Fewer than 10 cases of sexual
harassment have been reported to
Kaplan in the 14 years that she has
been here. Most cases she hears
concern male professors allegedly
harassing female students, she said.
Harassment includes both physical
and verbal overtures, she added, and
is characterized by continuous un
welcome attention that the student
does not encourage.
"We can't tell how many cases go
unreported for various reasons,"
Kaplan said. "However, I think we've
begun to establish a clear channel
where women can seek help with
this problem."
There are three avenues for com
plaints about sexual harassment
here.
â€” First, Kaplan is available to pro
vide help and counsel to students. If
action seems justified, she will notify
the provost of the problem and the
two will delegate the problem to
whoever seems to be the best person
to deal with it effectively.
Second, the Ombudsman's

Office is available for advice and
counsel for everyone, but it is espe
cially recognized as an avenue for
staff or faculty complaints. Again, it
action seems justified, the om
budsman will notify the provost in
order that the problem can be prop
erly handled.
Third, the threatened person can
appeal to the supervisor of the indi
vidual who is thought to be the
source of harassment. Students, staff
or junior faculty may be quite timid
about approaching a dean or a de
partment head, however. If so, they
may use the first two avenues for a
less direct approach.
Kaplan said that the University's
means of dealing with sexual
harassment cases will alleviate prob
lems of ineffectiveness, red tape and
confusion encountered when too
many persons are involved in the
solution.
"If the problem isn't resolved at an
earlier level and is brought to my at
tention," Provost Donald Kennedy
said, "then it would be my place to
intervene."
Kaplan said that in past cases, con
sultation with former provost Wil
liam Miller and the faculty member
involved corrected the problem.
"If the faculty member knows that
there is someone looking over his
shoulder, the behavior usually

stops," Kaplan said.
She added that she is not aware of
any cases at the University where
more formal action was taken, such
as salary cuts or firing.
Kennedy said that repeated in
stances of sexual harassment, espe
cially combined with the promise of
preferential treatment or the threat
of withholding it, are unacceptable.
He added that penalties such as firing
or reductions in salary might be im
posed on employees who continue
to practice sexual harassment.
"The institution owes people pro
tection against coercion," he said.
"In power relationships where the
student is dependent on the faculty
member for a recommendation,

grant or grade, the student can be
manipulated," Kaplan said.
Both Kaplan and Kennedy acknow
ledged that cases could arise where a
student could makea report against a
professor whose intent was not to
sexually harass the student. They
recognized the faculty's vulnerability
to unjustified accusations in cases of
sexual harassment.
"We don't want to jump the gun
and make false assumptions," Ken
nedy said.
Kaplan said that the shame accom
panying sexual harassment cases has
lessened in past years. While women
used to feel guilty and would not
speak out against harassers, more
are now coming forward with com
plaints.
