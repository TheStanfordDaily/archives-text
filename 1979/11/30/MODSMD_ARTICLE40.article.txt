# Bears optimistic

San Francisco (AP) — In
the unpredictable world of
college basketball, as
California coach Dick
Kuchen says, "Everyone is
waiting for Friday night."
Most of the nation's
teams will be tested before
the weekend is over, and
those with tonight's
season-opening games in
clude Cal's young Bears
who play on the road
against UC-Santa Barbara.
"Our weakness is really
our strength," Kuchen said
Tuesday at a preseason
gathering of Bay Area
coaches. "We went out and
had a great recruiting year,
so now we're very young."
Two of Kuchen's recruit
ing prizes, freshmen
Michael Pitts and Michael
Chavez, will be in the start
ing lineup against UCSBand
several other newcomers
will be seeing action.
"As vitally important as it
was to get some good young
players into our program,
our success this season is
going to depend a lot on the
ability of returning players
like Doug True and Kevin
Singleton to provide leader
ship," concluded Kuchen.
The Bears will be trying to
work their way up from a
6-21 overall record and a
4-14 finish in the Pacific-10
last season, Kuchen's first at
Berkeley.

Stanford coach Dick Di-
Biaso noted that, for the first
lime in many years, UCLA is
not the clear-cut favorite in
the Pac-10.
Santa Clara coach Carroll
Williams, whose Broncos of
the West Coast Athletic
Conference play at UCLA on
Dec. 8, said to Dißiaso, "I
don't think UCLA will betoo
bad. Wouldn't you love to
have some of their second
stringers?"
Santa Clara dropped from
a WCAC favorite to a dark
horse when 6-10 Mark
McNamara, a strong center,
dropped off the squad re
cently.
"I would pick Seattle first
and Portland second," said
San Francisco coach Dan
Belluomini, whose Dons
won the title last season
when 7-foot Bill Cartwright
was wrapping up his great
college career.
Another 7-footer,
sophomore Wallace Bryant,
is now the USF center. He
scored 18 points in the re
cent exhibition game
against the touring Russian
national team.
Bill Berry, the new coach
at San lose State, noted that
his team has been picked
seventh in the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association, and he
said, "That's probably about
where we belona."
