# Cards host top swim meet
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
While you munch lackadais
ically on your toast, the Card
swimmers are warming up for
the three-day Stanford Invita
tional beginning this morning
at 9. From all indications, the
meet promises to be action
packed, spotlighting the top
age-group teams of northern
California plus collegiate
squads from California, San
Jose State, University of Pacific
and University of Arkansas.
According to coach Skip
Kenney, the competition will
include at least eight or 10
swimmers definitely bound for
the 1980 Olympic Games in
Moscow. Former Cardinal
breaststroke stars ]ohn
Hencken, the bearer of three
Olympic gold medals, and
Noel Moran, one of the main
ingredients in last year's AIAW
third place finish will return to
deCuerre with the Santa Clara
Swim Club.
Ex-Cal backstroker Peter
Rocca, holder of Olympic
silver and multiple NCAA titles,
will join the fray, as will former
NCAA butterfly champion Matt
Vogel. Linda Jezek, who
monopolized all backstroke
events for the Cards last year
but is stopping out to train this
quarter is also scheduled to
swim.
Current collegiate standouts
Par Arvidsson, last year's NCAA
victor in the 100 and 200 yard
fly, and AAU national champ
ion John Simons will hit the
water for Cal and Stanford re
spectively.

The Cardinal men will all
swim in three events per day,
the maximum number allowa
ble and an energy-depleting
maneuver in itself. "This meet
will tell us where we are at this
point in our training. This is an
evaluation meet for us," said
Kenney.
The women will enter their
best events and numerous
others, according to coach
Claudia Thomas. "We're hop
ing for a good meet and expect
to be in there with quite a few
good swims," she said. The
meet will give the Cards the
chance to compete in all the
AIAW events, and Thomas is
looking for several AIAW qual
ifying times.

The Cards have not rested
for today's action, but Thomas
classified her team as "men
tally prepared." Unlike the un
relenting Cards, the team from
Arkansas is fully tapered and
shaved, as was the band of
marauders from lowa last
week, Kenney noted. Since the
meet is non-scoring, such early
season tactics will serve no
purpose.
AAU powerhouses Pleasant
Hill Swim Club, Walnut Creek
Aquabears, Concord Swim
Club and Ladera Oaks will be
on display at deCuerre, one of
the meet's attractions as the
"fastest outdoor facility in the
nation," in Kenney's words.
Races begin at 9 a.m. tomorrow
and Sunday as well.
