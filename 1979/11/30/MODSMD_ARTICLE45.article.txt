MOONRAKER
105 Rockaway Beach Ave.
Pacifica
359-0303
Most people will agree that a
deep appreciation of art, ballet
or opera requires much know
ledge, insight and a certain cul
tural sophistication, but few
realize that there exist culinary
creations equally demanding.
The beauty and complexity of a
meal are ephemeral things de
spite modern freezing
techniques and tupperware, so
the appreciation of food as art
is understandably underde
veloped. Rembrandt is served
to hundreds of thousands of
people per day, but how many
experience foie gras and a sip
ot a rare sweet Meursault in a
lifetime? Unfortunately too
few, but alas there is hope for
those on the Farm who admire
the art of haute cuisine.
The Moonraker, perched
above the sands of Rockaway
Beach 12 miles north of Halt
Moon Bay on Highway One,
offers a gastronomic spectacle
for the connoisseur who seeks
a masterpiece that will delight
and challenge all the senses.
First for the eyes, which
should never be overlooked in
dining, for they choose the
light in which the evening is
perceived. A 45-minute drive
over the winding foothill roads
and up along the coastal high
way refreshes your visual pa
late in preparation for the
sights to come.
You spot the Moonraker
atop a small cluster of restaur
ants which offer a variety of
atmospheres and menus.
Mounting the stairs to the
Moonraker's cozy quarters,
the sight of water meeting rock
emerges through large picture
windows. Inside the ocean
flows around every booth.
Even at the bar, mirrors cast the
surf back through the drinks to
the far reaches of the room.
The lights are dim in order that
the glimmer of the Pacific pre
dominates.
The rest ot the body is en
veloped in the warmth and
comfort emanating trom the
flames in the fireplace. Every
one is well dressed, in curious
contrast to the favorite
sweater-and-slippers sense of
ease. The prelude.

The main event is of course
the food; taste and aroma.
Choosing the fare for the even
ing is by far the most demand
ing aspect of dining at the
Moonraker. How are you to
decide on the composition of
your meal when there are more
than 25 entrees and dozens of
hors d'oeuvres, specialties,
and desserts on the me r ,u?
Hopefully a few drinks trom
the excellent bar will help.
We pondered the ordering
of the most perfect combina
tions for a considerable time,
often with the advice of our
waiter who was most know
ledgeable, cordial and patient.
It was evident that he took
pride in his role in a rare gus
tatory endeavor.
Blue Point oysters, oysters
Rockefeller, escargot bour
guignon, filet de sole Murat,
whole Pacific coast Rex Sole,
salmon, abalone, veal, roast
duckling, cuisses de grenouil
les, steaks, lobster, crab,
shrimp, white asparagus, and
cauliflower polonais are just a
few items from the Moon
raker's extensive and frustrat
ing menu , frustrating because
it is impossible to sample ev-

erything it so tantilizingly of
fers.
After we finally ordered, our
hors d'oeuvres of escargot
and oysters Rockefeller arrived
promptly on an attractive set
ting. Our taste buds were
overwhelmed. I have eaten
many snails in my life, but none
could compare with those of
the Moonraker. A touch of
pernod in the garlic-butter
parsley sauce transformed an
old favorite into a completely
new, unique dish. Inventive
ness of this sort is the hallmark
of true art.
The oysters were no less
superb. Cream spinach topped

with gratin was baked with the
shell fish to deliver a subtly
bitter treat.
We were not thirsty for a
moment thanks to two fine
French wines; a 1976 Pouilly
Fuisse and a 1977 Pommard. Al
though our wine was quite ex
ceptional, especially the
Pouilly which had a mysteri
ously charming odorand flavor
only to be found in French
wines, the wine list seemed
rather limited in light of the
immense choice available in
the menu. The restricted choce
of wines is perhaps the only
flaw in the Moonraker experi
ence, and a minor one at that.
Alter hors d'oeuvres, salads
were mixed at the table and
served, as salad should be, on
plates, rather than in bowls.
This attention to minor details
such as selection of china is
important in serious dining for
it promotes confidence in the
rest of the meal.
The entrees of steak, lobster
and abalone,'warmed over
sternoes brought to the table,
surpassed all our expectations.
Rather than extoll the
achievements of the chef, I

simply urge you to go and
taste for yourself.
Open Tuesday through Sun
day for dinner only, it is wise to
make reservations. Making re
servations, driving for 45 mi
nutes to an hour, trying to de
cide what to order from such a
large selection, and persuad
ing someone else in your party
to pick up the tab which will
run anywhere from $20 to $45
per person may seem like a lot
of work just to eat dinner.
But remember, that this is
not mere food, dinner at the
Moonraker is art.

rather limited in light of the
immense choice available in
the menu. The restricted choce
of wines is perhaps the only
flaw in the Moonraker experi
ence, and a minor one at that.
Alter hors d'oeuvres, salads
were mixed at the table and
served, as salad should be, on
plates, rather than in bowls.
This attention to minor details
such as selection of china is
important in serious dining for
it promotes confidence in the
rest of the meal.
The entrees of steak, lobster
and abalone,'warmed over
sternoes brought to the table,
surpassed all our expectations.
Rather than extoll the
achievements of the chef, I

simply urge you to go and
taste for yourself.
Open Tuesday through Sun
day for dinner only, it is wise to
make reservations. Making re
servations, driving for 45 mi
nutes to an hour, trying to de
cide what to order from such a
large selection, and persuad
ing someone else in your party
to pick up the tab which will
run anywhere from $20 to $45
per person may seem like a lot
of work just to eat dinner.
But remember, that this is
not mere food, dinner at the
Moonraker is art.

MOONRAKER
105 Rockaway Beach Ave.
Pacifica
359-0303
Most people will agree that a
deep appreciation of art, ballet
or opera requires much know
ledge, insight and a certain cul
tural sophistication, but few
realize that there exist culinary
creations equally demanding.
The beauty and complexity of a
meal are ephemeral things de
spite modern freezing
techniques and tupperware, so
the appreciation of food as art
is understandably underde
veloped. Rembrandt is served
to hundreds of thousands of
people per day, but how many
experience foie gras and a sip
ot a rare sweet Meursault in a
lifetime? Unfortunately too
few, but alas there is hope for
those on the Farm who admire
the art of haute cuisine.
The Moonraker, perched
above the sands of Rockaway
Beach 12 miles north of Halt
Moon Bay on Highway One,
offers a gastronomic spectacle
for the connoisseur who seeks
a masterpiece that will delight
and challenge all the senses.
First for the eyes, which
should never be overlooked in
dining, for they choose the
light in which the evening is
perceived. A 45-minute drive
over the winding foothill roads
and up along the coastal high
way refreshes your visual pa
late in preparation for the
sights to come.
You spot the Moonraker
atop a small cluster of restaur
ants which offer a variety of
atmospheres and menus.
Mounting the stairs to the
Moonraker's cozy quarters,
the sight of water meeting rock
emerges through large picture
windows. Inside the ocean
flows around every booth.
Even at the bar, mirrors cast the
surf back through the drinks to
the far reaches of the room.
The lights are dim in order that
the glimmer of the Pacific pre
dominates.
The rest ot the body is en
veloped in the warmth and
comfort emanating trom the
flames in the fireplace. Every
one is well dressed, in curious
contrast to the favorite
sweater-and-slippers sense of
ease. The prelude.

The main event is of course
the food; taste and aroma.
Choosing the fare for the even
ing is by far the most demand
ing aspect of dining at the
Moonraker. How are you to
decide on the composition of
your meal when there are more
than 25 entrees and dozens of
hors d'oeuvres, specialties,
and desserts on the me r ,u?
Hopefully a few drinks trom
the excellent bar will help.
We pondered the ordering
of the most perfect combina
tions for a considerable time,
often with the advice of our
waiter who was most know
ledgeable, cordial and patient.
It was evident that he took
pride in his role in a rare gus
tatory endeavor.
Blue Point oysters, oysters
Rockefeller, escargot bour
guignon, filet de sole Murat,
whole Pacific coast Rex Sole,
salmon, abalone, veal, roast
duckling, cuisses de grenouil
les, steaks, lobster, crab,
shrimp, white asparagus, and
cauliflower polonais are just a
few items from the Moon
raker's extensive and frustrat
ing menu , frustrating because
it is impossible to sample ev-

erything it so tantilizingly of
fers.
After we finally ordered, our
hors d'oeuvres of escargot
and oysters Rockefeller arrived
promptly on an attractive set
ting. Our taste buds were
overwhelmed. I have eaten
many snails in my life, but none
could compare with those of
the Moonraker. A touch of
pernod in the garlic-butter
parsley sauce transformed an
old favorite into a completely
new, unique dish. Inventive
ness of this sort is the hallmark
of true art.
The oysters were no less
superb. Cream spinach topped

with gratin was baked with the
shell fish to deliver a subtly
bitter treat.
We were not thirsty for a
moment thanks to two fine
French wines; a 1976 Pouilly
Fuisse and a 1977 Pommard. Al
though our wine was quite ex
ceptional, especially the
Pouilly which had a mysteri
ously charming odorand flavor
only to be found in French
wines, the wine list seemed
rather limited in light of the
immense choice available in
the menu. The restricted choce
of wines is perhaps the only
flaw in the Moonraker experi
ence, and a minor one at that.
