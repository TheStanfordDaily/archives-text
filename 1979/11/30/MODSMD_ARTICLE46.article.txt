CHART HOUSE
8150 Cahrillo Highway
Montara
728-7366
Life at Stanford isn't easy. As the quarter
draws to a close, academics seem to get
tougher, but so does stomaching the great
food which either you or your friendly
food service cooks. You can take only so
much "Chef's surprise" before it's no
longer something to get excited about (as
if it ever was).
So, where can you go to escape the has
sles which present themselves to you as
you plan an exciting evening out?
My suggestion is to go to the beach.
Sounds a little crazy at this time ot the year,
but can you honestly say that you are sane
if you dare try to find your way around San
Francisco, or for that matter even around
campus?
No, you don't need a blanket, firewood
or picnic supplies, because you're headed
tor a cozy beach house overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. No reservation is needed
and in tact, should you try to make one, it
won't be accepted.
Following the Coast Highway north
trom Highway 92, and keeping an eye on
the ocean, you'll spy your destination: a
unique-looking structure of glass and
wood, the Chart House. A fairly new addi
tion to the Montara coastline, which
opened in October 1978.
After being seated at a table which, it
you're awake enough to notice it, has a
"chart'' (get it?) embossed upon its sur
face, the menu is brought to you. It is
printed on a wooden cutting-board and
carries approximately 10 entrees. Don't be
upset by this apparent lack of choice be
cause unless you want hamburgers, the
menu offers something for practically
everyone: steak or shrimp teriyaki, prime
rib, steak and lobster, as well as a house
specialty, Mahi Mahi.
If you're curious enough to ask, you'll
be told that this is a dolphin fish, not to be
contused with the Flipper variety. This is a
white fish, apparently quite good.
Prices are very reasonable, ranging from
$6.95 for Mahi Mahi on up to steak and
lobster at $14.95. But the good old Ameri
can "steak and potatoes" is non-existent
here. Once you've discovered the terrific
salad bar and endless supply of hot bread,
which is included with your entree, you
forget about potatoes.
The salad bar is amazing: you can have
the waitress bring you your salad, or you
can design your own. (I preferred to do the

latter, but I think I overdid it.) My advice is
to go easy on the lettuce, since you 'll want
to stock up on the tomatoes, carrots, mus
hrooms, peppers, grated cheddar cheese,
and on and on. Then you can top it off with
your favorite dressing, bacon bits and
croutons.
When you finally return to your table, a
basket of hot bread awaits you. Wheat fans
will be happy to know that half of the bas
ket contains their tavorite, while the other
half is French.
Alter consuming two or three baskets of
bread plus an extremely large salad, it's
probably time to leave before they have to
roll you out. But, then you will recall that
the main dish is on its way.
The entrees are served quite simply, in
keeping with the general theme ot there-

staurant. But they are great! Steak and
lobster in restaurants often seems to be
the least for one's money; the lobster is
really small, and the steak is minute. But at
the Chart House, the lobster is huge!
Truthfully, I have never seen (on the West
Coast) a crustacean that big served as part
ot surt and turt (and I'm Irom the coast of
California). The steak wasn't small, either.
And both were delicious. At $14.95, it was a
real deal.
Shrimp Teriyaki, at $10.95, was great
too. Mildly seasoned and, while the
number of shrimp which you are given
may not look like a meal, believe me, it is.
Since dessert usually follows a meal, you
definitely have to try the one and only
alter-dinner item on the menu, mud pie.
You'll never settle for sherbert or ice
cream again.
Chocolate waters form the crust, which
is filled with coffee ice cream, topped with
chewy tudge syrup, followed by whipped
cream and topped with nuts. It's great for
$1.50, but watch the cookie crust. It's fro
zen hard, so don't embarrass yourself (as I
did) by trying to cut into it and spewing
whipped cream all over South America
(which was what the map on my table con
tained).
On the way out, if you're interested you
can pick up recipes for the infamous mud
pie or the restaurant's special salad dres
sing so that the next time your stomach

craves something different, you'll be able
to impress it, as well as your friends, with a
little touch of class from the coast.
The Chart House is a member of a chain
which selects individual locations near
water or in the mountains. In selecting
such areas, emphasis is placed upon exist
ing structures, rather than building new
ones. The management looks for struc
tures interesting in design of heritage: for
example, the Chart House in Los Gatos
was originally a mortuary.
The Montara Chart House has always
been a beach house, although not in its
present form. A stucco building owned by
Frank Torre once stood on the site where
the present structure of wood shingles
and glass now stands.
One wall remains from Torre's house,
but the rest has been completely con
verted. The angles of the new building are
designed to conform to both the coastline
and surrounding trees.
The interior of the restaurant warrants
just as much admiration as the exterior.
The building is split leveled, with a lounge
below, restaurant on the second level, and
private dining rooms above. Furnishings
are kept simple: tables are surrounded by
captain's chairs with photos of sea scenes
displayed upon the walls. Planters sur
round both the dining room and the
lounge, with a tropical fern for practically
each table. Lighting is low, and dinner is
served by candlelight.
This intimate atmosphere, however,
does not warrant a coat and tie; dress is
casual and is reflected in the attire worn by
the employees — Polynesian shirts. While
the restaurant is very nice, it tries to keep it
appearance simple, dispelling any stuffi
ness which many others of its caliber may
possess.
The employees also help to eliminate
any stuffiness you could possibly feel:
they are all fairly young. I was told by one
of the waitresses that the chain encour
ages the hiring of young people, particu
larly those in college. They want people
who have other things in their life besides
their restaurant work.
At the end of your dining experience, if
it's not too cold you may try a walk (or roll)
on the beach before bidding adieu to the
beautiful beach house, great food and in
timate atmosphere, for a return to Stan
tord, the land of junk food and Chef's de
light.

probably time to leave before they have to
roll you out. But, then you will recall that
the main dish is on its way.
The entrees are served quite simply, in
keeping with the general theme ot there-

staurant. But they are great! Steak and
lobster in restaurants often seems to be
the least for one's money; the lobster is
really small, and the steak is minute. But at
the Chart House, the lobster is huge!
Truthfully, I have never seen (on the West
Coast) a crustacean that big served as part
ot surt and turt (and I'm Irom the coast of
California). The steak wasn't small, either.
And both were delicious. At $14.95, it was a
real deal.
Shrimp Teriyaki, at $10.95, was great
too. Mildly seasoned and, while the
number of shrimp which you are given
may not look like a meal, believe me, it is.
Since dessert usually follows a meal, you
definitely have to try the one and only
alter-dinner item on the menu, mud pie.
You'll never settle for sherbert or ice
cream again.
Chocolate waters form the crust, which
is filled with coffee ice cream, topped with
chewy tudge syrup, followed by whipped
cream and topped with nuts. It's great for
$1.50, but watch the cookie crust. It's fro
zen hard, so don't embarrass yourself (as I
did) by trying to cut into it and spewing
whipped cream all over South America
(which was what the map on my table con
tained).
On the way out, if you're interested you
can pick up recipes for the infamous mud
pie or the restaurant's special salad dres
sing so that the next time your stomach

craves something different, you'll be able
to impress it, as well as your friends, with a
little touch of class from the coast.
The Chart House is a member of a chain
which selects individual locations near
water or in the mountains. In selecting
such areas, emphasis is placed upon exist
ing structures, rather than building new
ones. The management looks for struc
tures interesting in design of heritage: for
example, the Chart House in Los Gatos
was originally a mortuary.
The Montara Chart House has always
been a beach house, although not in its
present form. A stucco building owned by
Frank Torre once stood on the site where
the present structure of wood shingles
and glass now stands.
One wall remains from Torre's house,
but the rest has been completely con
verted. The angles of the new building are
designed to conform to both the coastline
and surrounding trees.
The interior of the restaurant warrants
just as much admiration as the exterior.
The building is split leveled, with a lounge
below, restaurant on the second level, and
private dining rooms above. Furnishings
are kept simple: tables are surrounded by
captain's chairs with photos of sea scenes
displayed upon the walls. Planters sur
round both the dining room and the
lounge, with a tropical fern for practically
each table. Lighting is low, and dinner is
served by candlelight.
This intimate atmosphere, however,
does not warrant a coat and tie; dress is
casual and is reflected in the attire worn by
the employees — Polynesian shirts. While
the restaurant is very nice, it tries to keep it
appearance simple, dispelling any stuffi
ness which many others of its caliber may
possess.
The employees also help to eliminate
any stuffiness you could possibly feel:
they are all fairly young. I was told by one
of the waitresses that the chain encour
ages the hiring of young people, particu
larly those in college. They want people
who have other things in their life besides
their restaurant work.
At the end of your dining experience, if
it's not too cold you may try a walk (or roll)
on the beach before bidding adieu to the
beautiful beach house, great food and in
timate atmosphere, for a return to Stan
tord, the land of junk food and Chef's de
light.

CHART HOUSE
8150 Cahrillo Highway
Montara
728-7366
Life at Stanford isn't easy. As the quarter
draws to a close, academics seem to get
tougher, but so does stomaching the great
food which either you or your friendly
food service cooks. You can take only so
much "Chef's surprise" before it's no
longer something to get excited about (as
if it ever was).
So, where can you go to escape the has
sles which present themselves to you as
you plan an exciting evening out?
My suggestion is to go to the beach.
Sounds a little crazy at this time ot the year,
but can you honestly say that you are sane
if you dare try to find your way around San
Francisco, or for that matter even around
campus?
No, you don't need a blanket, firewood
or picnic supplies, because you're headed
tor a cozy beach house overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. No reservation is needed
and in tact, should you try to make one, it
won't be accepted.
Following the Coast Highway north
trom Highway 92, and keeping an eye on
the ocean, you'll spy your destination: a
unique-looking structure of glass and
wood, the Chart House. A fairly new addi
tion to the Montara coastline, which
opened in October 1978.
After being seated at a table which, it
you're awake enough to notice it, has a
"chart'' (get it?) embossed upon its sur
face, the menu is brought to you. It is
printed on a wooden cutting-board and
carries approximately 10 entrees. Don't be
upset by this apparent lack of choice be
cause unless you want hamburgers, the
menu offers something for practically
everyone: steak or shrimp teriyaki, prime
rib, steak and lobster, as well as a house
specialty, Mahi Mahi.
If you're curious enough to ask, you'll
be told that this is a dolphin fish, not to be
contused with the Flipper variety. This is a
white fish, apparently quite good.
Prices are very reasonable, ranging from
$6.95 for Mahi Mahi on up to steak and
lobster at $14.95. But the good old Ameri
can "steak and potatoes" is non-existent
here. Once you've discovered the terrific
salad bar and endless supply of hot bread,
which is included with your entree, you
forget about potatoes.
The salad bar is amazing: you can have
the waitress bring you your salad, or you
can design your own. (I preferred to do the

latter, but I think I overdid it.) My advice is
to go easy on the lettuce, since you 'll want
to stock up on the tomatoes, carrots, mus
hrooms, peppers, grated cheddar cheese,
and on and on. Then you can top it off with
your favorite dressing, bacon bits and
croutons.
When you finally return to your table, a
basket of hot bread awaits you. Wheat fans
will be happy to know that half of the bas
ket contains their tavorite, while the other
half is French.
Alter consuming two or three baskets of
bread plus an extremely large salad, it's

casual and is reflected in the attire worn by
the employees — Polynesian shirts. While
the restaurant is very nice, it tries to keep it
appearance simple, dispelling any stuffi
ness which many others of its caliber may
possess.
The employees also help to eliminate
any stuffiness you could possibly feel:
they are all fairly young. I was told by one
of the waitresses that the chain encour
ages the hiring of young people, particu
larly those in college. They want people
who have other things in their life besides
their restaurant work.
At the end of your dining experience, if
it's not too cold you may try a walk (or roll)
on the beach before bidding adieu to the
beautiful beach house, great food and in
timate atmosphere, for a return to Stan
tord, the land of junk food and Chef's de
light.
