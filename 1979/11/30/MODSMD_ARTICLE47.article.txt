THE MOSS BEACH DISTILLERY
Beach Highway and Ocean Blvd.
Moss Beach
728-5434
Tucked away among resi
dences and side streets, the
Moss Beach Distillery is a place
that you want to tuck away in
your memory once you visit it.
Open seven days a week (it will
be closed from Dec. 3-31), the
Distillery, located at the corner
of Beach Way and Ocean
Boulevard, specializes equally
well in prime rib, steak and fish
dishes.
Attractive wooden paneling
and healthy-looking hanging
plants are just part of the tidy
decor that greets the diner.
You are joined at your table by
fresh flowers, and many tables
are located next to the wide
Window, which affords a beaut
iful view of the Pacific Ocean.
This view, the low lighting and
the soft, (almost impercepti
ble) mellow rock music playing
in the background contribute
to an overall soothing feeling.
One may not be so soothed
upon gazing at the prices in the
menu — most of the 21 entrees
are priced at $8.95 or slightly
above. However, the cost is
fully justified by the cuisine.
For the famished who need
something to nibble on im
mediately, the Distillery offers

an extensive oyster bar menu
that includes oysters and clams
on the half-shell, teriyaki on a
stick, and crab and shrimp
cocktails, to name a few de
licacies. Hot artichoke (in sea
son) and sauteed fresh mus
hrooms (definitely delicious)
are other alluring appetizers.
Once you are done consider
ing this array of appetizers, you
have to ponder over your
choice of entree. Co ahead,
ponder. The waitresses are
singularly friendly, and would
sooner throw themselves into
the adjacent ocean than rush
you into making your order.
The resulting feeling of calm
is pervasive, thus making
the Distillery an ideal place to
dine whether you are accom
panied by your parents, your
loved one, or your IRS auditor.
Diners with carnivorous
tendencies ought to find some
thing to please them from the 10
dishes available "from the
broiler." Prime rib, top sirloin,
teriyaki chicken or sirloin, beef
ribs, quail, lamb and filet mig
non are included in the Distil
lery's repertoire of meats.
Seafood lovers need not suf
fer, for the Distillery serves
fresh seafood whenever avail
able (snapper and halibut are
the current fresh fish offered).
Further temptations are

broiled salmon, steamed
clams, Australian lobster (a full
tail costs $15.95 and is the most
expensive dish served), crab
legs and sauteed shrimp.
Those who are torn between
meat and fish can have the best
of both worlds. The Distillery
caters to such wishy-washy
folk by offering steak with
lobster, crab or shrimp, and
beef with prawns.
There are no disappoint
ments once the food arrives. If
you opted for the oysters or the
mushrooms, you have proba
bly already entered the early
stages of euphoria. As for the
main courses the sitloins are
tender and juicy, without fail
And the Distillery is not a place
where the potato

obscures your steak — they
give you enough to eat.
The delectable fish causes
one to have fits of lipsmacking.
Yes, they probably caught your
dinner by taking a quick stroll
down to the nearby beach and
tidepools.
You are primed for the en
tree, of course, by your choice
of either Boston clam chowder
or a salad from the salad bar.
The chowder is memorable for
its substantial chunks of clam.
The salad bar is typical lor
most above-average restaur
ants, which means that it is
good. Three different types of
sprouts, garbanzo and kidney
beans, cucumbers and to
matoes all may make their way
into your salad bowl if you so

desire.
The Distillery's bread is ex
cellent — fresh wheat, and
baked daily. However, they
neglect to otter bread plates,
which can be traumatic for
those who live in mortal fear of
crumbs sullying the tablecloth
or even one's clothes.
Nothing is messy, though,
about the desserts — carrot
cake, cheesecake, Irish parfait
(yummy), and coffee ice
cream. I highly recommend
trying one of these delectable
treats as a finish to a satisfying
eating experience.
In addition to this half of the
dining experience, the wine
list is fairly long and offers a
luscious selection of both
California and imported wines.

Also there is a dimly lit and
cozy lounge next to the dining
area. The bar is ready, willing,
and able to accommodate any
cravings.
According to manager Dave
Andrews, the restaurant has
been in existence for over 50
years. He chose the name with
the thought in mind that in yes

teryears the restaurant was in
volved, as were many up and
down the coast, in bootlegging
activities.
For a quaint mellow atmos
phere secluded on the coast
and lor superb steak and sea
tood, take a drive out to The
Moss Beach Distillery.

Attractive wooden paneling
and healthy-looking hanging
plants are just part of the tidy
decor that greets the diner.
You are joined at your table by
fresh flowers, and many tables
are located next to the wide
Window, which affords a beaut
iful view of the Pacific Ocean.
This view, the low lighting and
the soft, (almost impercepti
ble) mellow rock music playing
in the background contribute
to an overall soothing feeling.
One may not be so soothed
upon gazing at the prices in the
menu — most of the 21 entrees
are priced at $8.95 or slightly
above. However, the cost is
fully justified by the cuisine.
For the famished who need
something to nibble on im
mediately, the Distillery offers

an extensive oyster bar menu
that includes oysters and clams
on the half-shell, teriyaki on a
stick, and crab and shrimp
cocktails, to name a few de
licacies. Hot artichoke (in sea
son) and sauteed fresh mus
hrooms (definitely delicious)
are other alluring appetizers.
Once you are done consider
ing this array of appetizers, you
have to ponder over your
choice of entree. Co ahead,
ponder. The waitresses are
singularly friendly, and would
sooner throw themselves into
the adjacent ocean than rush
you into making your order.
The resulting feeling of calm
is pervasive, thus making
the Distillery an ideal place to
dine whether you are accom
panied by your parents, your
loved one, or your IRS auditor.
Diners with carnivorous
tendencies ought to find some
thing to please them from the 10
dishes available "from the
broiler." Prime rib, top sirloin,
teriyaki chicken or sirloin, beef
ribs, quail, lamb and filet mig
non are included in the Distil
lery's repertoire of meats.
Seafood lovers need not suf
fer, for the Distillery serves
fresh seafood whenever avail
able (snapper and halibut are
the current fresh fish offered).
Further temptations are

broiled salmon, steamed
clams, Australian lobster (a full
tail costs $15.95 and is the most
expensive dish served), crab
legs and sauteed shrimp.
Those who are torn between
meat and fish can have the best
of both worlds. The Distillery
caters to such wishy-washy
folk by offering steak with
lobster, crab or shrimp, and
beef with prawns.
There are no disappoint
ments once the food arrives. If
you opted for the oysters or the
mushrooms, you have proba
bly already entered the early
stages of euphoria. As for the
main courses the sitloins are
tender and juicy, without fail
And the Distillery is not a place
where the potato

obscures your steak — they
give you enough to eat.
The delectable fish causes
one to have fits of lipsmacking.
Yes, they probably caught your
dinner by taking a quick stroll
down to the nearby beach and
tidepools.
You are primed for the en
tree, of course, by your choice
of either Boston clam chowder
or a salad from the salad bar.
The chowder is memorable for
its substantial chunks of clam.
The salad bar is typical lor
most above-average restaur
ants, which means that it is
good. Three different types of
sprouts, garbanzo and kidney
beans, cucumbers and to
matoes all may make their way
into your salad bowl if you so

desire.
The Distillery's bread is ex
cellent — fresh wheat, and
baked daily. However, they
neglect to otter bread plates,
which can be traumatic for
those who live in mortal fear of
crumbs sullying the tablecloth
or even one's clothes.
Nothing is messy, though,
about the desserts — carrot
cake, cheesecake, Irish parfait
(yummy), and coffee ice
cream. I highly recommend
trying one of these delectable
treats as a finish to a satisfying
eating experience.
In addition to this half of the
dining experience, the wine
list is fairly long and offers a
luscious selection of both
California and imported wines.

Also there is a dimly lit and
cozy lounge next to the dining
area. The bar is ready, willing,
and able to accommodate any
cravings.
According to manager Dave
Andrews, the restaurant has
been in existence for over 50
years. He chose the name with
the thought in mind that in yes

teryears the restaurant was in
volved, as were many up and
down the coast, in bootlegging
activities.
For a quaint mellow atmos
phere secluded on the coast
and lor superb steak and sea
tood, take a drive out to The
Moss Beach Distillery.
