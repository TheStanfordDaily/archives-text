VALLEMAR STATION
2125 Cabrillo Hwy.
Pacifica
359-6238
In 1907 the Vallemar Station
was built by the Ocean Shore
Railroad along its route bet
ween San Francisco and Santa
Cruz. Today Vallemar Station is
a cafeteria-style restaurant and
bar operated by Dema and
Mark Savage.
The menu is written on a
large blackboard behind the
food counter. Today there are
four homemade soups: mines
trone, black bean, split pea and
clam chowder (cup $.50), bowl
$1). The split pea is a little thick
but enjoyable. The clam chow
der is spicy and packed with
potatoes and clams. The types
of soups — always at least three
— are changed daily, except
for the vegetarian minestrone.
The tossed salad ($1) fea
tures several types of lettuce,
tomatoes, sprouts and cucum
bers. It can be topped off with
either bleu cheese, oil & vin
egar, thousand island or

French dressing. A chef's salad
($2.50), potato salad ($.75) or a
fresh fruit salad ($.75) are also
available.
Forentrees, Vallemar Station
offers Super Sandwiches and a
hot entree which is changed
daily.
Super Sandwiches start with
sourdough or sweet roll, or
white, whole wheat or rye
bread. Next they are spread

with a little mayonnaise or
mustard. Then there is achoice
of roast beef, turkey, ham (all
$2.50) or Swiss, American,
cheddar, cream cheese or
Monterey lack (all $1.85).
Top it all off with lettuce, on
ions,-tomatoes and a sprinkling
of sprouts for a hearty
sandwich (though the sour
dough roll that came with my
roast beef sandwich was a little

chewy). Half sandwiches are
available for those who don't
want to eat a whole one.
Today's entree is clam sauce
with linguine ($3.50) served
with salad and bread and but
ter. The clam sauce was
lukewarm; it had a nice flavor
but would taste much better
hot.
Because Dema cooks all the
food herself, and since it is
served cafeteria-style, the
prices are very reasonable and
the portions are good-sized.
There is a large fireplace in the
dining room, and on Sundays
for the Sunday brunch the out
side patio is opened for dining.
Sunday brunch is served from
9:30 until 3:00, and it is not
cafeteria-style.
On Friday and Saturday
evenings, the tables are
pushed back and there is live
music and dancing until 2 a.m.
Vallemar Station is open for
lunch and dinner from 11:30
until 8:00.
