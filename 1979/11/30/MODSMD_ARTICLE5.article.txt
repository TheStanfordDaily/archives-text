# Okada wins vote
## Residents rename Junipero 
### Lisa Adler Andrea James 
"Welcome to Okada House."
Visitors to the Asian-American theme dorm on cam
pus were greeted with this message yesterday when they
walked into the lounge of what they thought was Wil
bur's junipero House.
Dorm residents voted by a clear majority Wednesday
night to change the name of their house to Okada, in
honor of the late Asian-American author John Okada.
The vote came after five years of unsuccessful at
tempts to rally residents behind a new dorm name. The
Asian-American house inherited the dorm's original
name, Junipero, when Residential Education initiated
the theme several years ago. Since then, residents have
thrown out suggestions for a new name but until this
year, were never able to unite behind one title.
About 60 percent of the 81 voting house members
chose Okada House over runner-up Pacifica, reported
house associate (RA) Leo Liu. Other choices were
Shizunami, a Japanese word meaning "small wave,"
Amerasia and East Winds.
A first
Comments from residents and other members of the
Asian-American community were generally favorable
toward the name commemorating the author of No-No
Boy, the first Asian-American novel printed in English.
"The name has a real relevance to Asian-Americans,"
said resident Loren Fong. "I read John Okada's book

over Thanksgiving, and it captures a lot of the Asian-
American experience."
No-No Boy deals with the indoctrination of a second
generation Japanese American into U.S. society and the
conflicts the teenager must face in coping with the strict
homeland traditions of his parents in conjunction with
the looser customs of the United States.
The novel also discusses such themes as identity and
prejudice.

"Okada represents the rebirth of Asian-American arts,
a movement in which Stanford has played a critical
role," said Woody Ichiyasu, a non-resident who has
been active in efforts tochange the name of the dorm for
the last four years.
In fact, the People's Teahouse, a small Asian-American
cafe in Wilbur, contributed $500 a few years ago to sup
oort a republication of No-No Boy.
Okada House was the final choice made by a commit
tee of house members last year, but, because of a gen
eral disinterest among dorm members, no action was
taken to implement the name.
This year, however, residents will work hard to pub
licize the name, said Liu.
"The official change won't take place until the begin
ning of the next academic year when the University
prints new booklets and pamphlets that now contain the
name Junipero," he said. "But the practical change is
starting now."
