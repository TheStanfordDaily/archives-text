The Big Sleep * ★ ★ ★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alio
Howard Hawks' "tough guy"
style fits this adaptation of the
Raymond Chandler novel per
fectly. Philip Marlowe, the hard
boiled private eye, is a piece-of
cake characterization for Hum
phrey Bogart, and the pairing of
Bogart with Lauren Bacall here is
movie — and sexual — magic.
William Faulkner assisted
J Raymond Chandler on the script,
which is full of fast-paced double
entendres. When they're spoken
by Bogart and Bacall, they be
come very easy to understand. As
they discuss the characteristics of
horse racing here, you know pre
cisely what they're getting at. By

3 Dillon star in this wonderfully
childlike tale about man's first
meeting with extraterrestrial be
ings. Director Steven Spielberg's
magical movie recalls both
i Hitchcock and The Wizard of Oz;
| Spielberg is clearly indebted to
I both, and in all the right ways. He

Moonraker *
3 Menlo Menlo Park
I Formula James Bond —it looks
as if this movie was made from a
recipe instead of from a script.
Take one dose of Roger Moore
1 (whatever you say, I still like
Connery better), one major
femme fatale (in this case Lois
Chiles, who seems fine right up
Duntil she speaks), and a gimmicky
B plot and you can make your very
own James Bond movie.

Moonraker has a great pre-title
sequence that is shot in mid-air;
after that the movie is ear
thbound for two solid hours —
even the patented in-the-sack
last scene seems affected by
fatigue. The Spy Who Loved Me,
the last Bond movie, was watcha
ble; skip this one and wait for
something better to come along.
—Jim Mattson
The Great Train Robbery it ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Michael C rich ton's movie
about "the first train robbery" is

an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be. It's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, semblance of
plot and a beautiful woman").
But there are enough twists,
enough Sean Connery and
enough cinematography from
the late Geoffrey Unsworth to
sustain the pleasant, glossy feel
ing here — but, overall, it's fake

gloss and not real sparkle. With
Donald Sutherland and Lesley-
Anne Down.
—R.L.
Dr. Ho * * *
Saturday, Cubberlev 8 & 10 p.m.
The first of the James Bond
movies — at about a tenth of the
cost of the latest, Moonraker. But
Sean Connery more than makes
up for any possible deficiencies
with a typically sauve perfor
mance in this slyly well-made
thriller. In contrast to the latest
Bond movies, Dr. No can at least
claim to be witty. Like all of the
good Bond pictures, this movie is
a helluva lot of fun.

Wdlership Down if.
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a movie most
notable for its lack of distinction
— I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster rabbits any day. Direc
tor Martin Rosen has bragged in
interviews that he knew nothing
about animation before under
taking Watership Down, and it
shows in every institutionally

those attempts at whimsy which,
instead of waking you up, makes

movie musical, lewison doesn't
attempt to temper the theatrical

the movie doesn't get stagy —

One of last year's most promis

Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the

nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with

And justice for All *
Palo Alto Square
About 10 years ago, this movie
would have made a great TV pilot
film, and that's probably the best
that can be said for it. Lots of the
"can the honest, crusading
lawyer keep his integrity in the
ugly, dog-eat-dog world of crim
inals, dirty attorneys and dishon
est judges?" type conflict. Nor
man lewison, who should know
better, directs the shallow
dramatics and cheap comedy in
the script with an embarrassing
earnestness. Al Pacino has nfever
seemed so ordinary; by sheer
force of will, he's interesting, but
the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be successful in his bid for
a weekly series?" Pacino must be
more ambitious than that.
—R.L.
Lund ir *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative

harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci'i first English language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo
graphy in Apocalypse Now) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it.

Apocalypse Now * * * *
Old Mill
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad I
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola t
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and 1
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri- [
can movie of this decade. It has I
almost untenable ambitions, but I
the profound questions that it jl
confronts you with justify the 8
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon

Like a short hit of nitrous oxide

Plots about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often pro
vided fertile movie ground, but
director )ohn Schlesinger, armed
with a skilled crew and healthy
budget, manages only to exhibit
the genre's limitations. Lisa Eic

young lovers, have the best of it
here; they both at least deliver
i motions that strike you. Despite
the likeability of the performers,
the Vanessa Redgrave-William

should have been scrapped; the
only point of contrast made is
that they are older and less naive
than Eichhorn and Cere. Limp

Moonraker has a great pre-title
sequence that is shot in mid-air;
after that the movie is ear
thbound for two solid hours —
even the patented in-the-sack

The Big Sleep * ★ ★ ★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alio
Howard Hawks' "tough guy"
style fits this adaptation of the
Raymond Chandler novel per
fectly. Philip Marlowe, the hard
boiled private eye, is a piece-of
cake characterization for Hum
phrey Bogart, and the pairing of
Bogart with Lauren Bacall here is
movie — and sexual — magic.
William Faulkner assisted
J Raymond Chandler on the script,
which is full of fast-paced double
entendres. When they're spoken
by Bogart and Bacall, they be
come very easy to understand. As
they discuss the characteristics of
horse racing here, you know pre
cisely what they're getting at. By
the end of the movie, you may
3 not know who did what to whom,
but chances are you won't care.

Close Encounters of the Third Kind
1r ★ ★ ★
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9:30 p.m.
Richard Dreyfuss and Melinda
3 Dillon star in this wonderfully
childlike tale about man's first
meeting with extraterrestrial be
ings. Director Steven Spielberg's
magical movie recalls both
i Hitchcock and The Wizard of Oz;
| Spielberg is clearly indebted to
I both, and in all the right ways. He
l|also has the youthful exuberance
3 that Hitchcock lost about four
I decades ago. Pure, sky-high fun
made by a director who seem
ingly has no creative limits. Also
starring Francois Truffaut.
—R.L.
Moonraker *
3 Menlo Menlo Park
I Formula James Bond —it looks
as if this movie was made from a
recipe instead of from a script.
Take one dose of Roger Moore
1 (whatever you say, I still like
Connery better), one major
femme fatale (in this case Lois
Chiles, who seems fine right up
Duntil she speaks), and a gimmicky
B plot and you can make your very
own James Bond movie.

Moonraker has a great pre-title
sequence that is shot in mid-air;
after that the movie is ear
thbound for two solid hours —
even the patented in-the-sack
last scene seems affected by
fatigue. The Spy Who Loved Me,
the last Bond movie, was watcha
ble; skip this one and wait for
something better to come along.
—Jim Mattson
The Great Train Robbery it ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Michael C rich ton's movie
about "the first train robbery" is

an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be. It's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, semblance of
plot and a beautiful woman").
But there are enough twists,
enough Sean Connery and
enough cinematography from
the late Geoffrey Unsworth to
sustain the pleasant, glossy feel
ing here — but, overall, it's fake

gloss and not real sparkle. With
Donald Sutherland and Lesley-
Anne Down.
—R.L.
Dr. Ho * * *
Saturday, Cubberlev 8 & 10 p.m.
The first of the James Bond
movies — at about a tenth of the
cost of the latest, Moonraker. But
Sean Connery more than makes
up for any possible deficiencies
with a typically sauve perfor
mance in this slyly well-made
thriller. In contrast to the latest
Bond movies, Dr. No can at least
claim to be witty. Like all of the
good Bond pictures, this movie is
a helluva lot of fun.
—R.L.

lulid * * * *
New Varsity, tonight & tomorrow
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftsmanship and com
plete and purposeful intelligence
dominate this movie about
friendship and its respon
sibilities. |ane Fonda and Vanessa
Redgrave star in this true story
based on a chapter from Lillian
Hellman's autobiographical
book Pentimento. Both are bril
liant; Fonda effectively captures
Hellman's spirited personality,
and Redgrave delivers a fine, un
derstated performance as the
idealistic )ulia.
—R.L.
Yanks * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Like a short hit of nitrous oxide
— gives you a brief high, but it
quickly wears off. A nostalgia trip
that withers in its sentimentality,
providing a sometimes pleasura
ble sweetness but little heat.
Plots about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often pro
vided fertile movie ground, but
director )ohn Schlesinger, armed
with a skilled crew and healthy
budget, manages only to exhibit
the genre's limitations. Lisa Eic
hhorn and Richard Cere, the

young lovers, have the best of it
here; they both at least deliver
i motions that strike you. Despite
the likeability of the performers,
the Vanessa Redgrave-William
Devane sequences probably
should have been scrapped; the
only point of contrast made is
that they are older and less naive
than Eichhorn and Cere. Limp
lyricism; no magic.
—R.L.
An Unmarried Woman * ★ * ★
New Varsity, tonight & tomorrow
Writer-director Paul Mazurs
ky's faintly feminist look at di
vorce in the '70s is perhaps a little
too smooth, but Jill Clayburgh's
performance is so richly tender
and comic that it really doesn't
matter. It's a soaring and convinc-

ing piece of acting, neatly com
plemented by Alan Bates' per
formance as the man who nearly
convinces Clayburgh to make a
commitment again. With Michael
Murphy.
—R.L.
Wdlership Down if.
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a movie most
notable for its lack of distinction
— I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster rabbits any day. Direc
tor Martin Rosen has bragged in
interviews that he knew nothing
about animation before under
taking Watership Down, and it
shows in every institutionally
colored frame. This is one of
those attempts at whimsy which,
instead of waking you up, makes
you leave the theater feeling as if
you've slept all night with your
mouth open.

Old Mill
Norman lewison, who in 1971
was in much better form than he
is now, directed this vibrant
movie musical, lewison doesn't
attempt to temper the theatrical
ity inherent in the material, yet

the movie doesn't get stagy —
Jewison keeps things flowing
smoothly. As Tevye, the main
character, Topol may not be as
brilliant as Zero Mostel was in the
stage version, but he still fills the
mighty role with a supreme zest
and vitality.
—R.L.
The Lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of
its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
rudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after

more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
for more details.

And justice for All *
Palo Alto Square
About 10 years ago, this movie
would have made a great TV pilot
film, and that's probably the best
that can be said for it. Lots of the
"can the honest, crusading
lawyer keep his integrity in the
ugly, dog-eat-dog world of crim
inals, dirty attorneys and dishon
est judges?" type conflict. Nor
man lewison, who should know
better, directs the shallow
dramatics and cheap comedy in
the script with an embarrassing
earnestness. Al Pacino has nfever
seemed so ordinary; by sheer
force of will, he's interesting, but
the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be successful in his bid for
a weekly series?" Pacino must be
more ambitious than that.
—R.L.
Lund ir *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative

harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci'i first English language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo
graphy in Apocalypse Now) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate
it.
— R.L.
The Onion Field ★ ★
Old Mill
This movie belongs on the
shelf next to other (oseph Warn-

baugh tales: a tough "fact
stranger than fiction" piece,
which smacks of sex, savagery
and, nonetheless, a sensitivity of
the agony and the fear which
keep both cops and robbers
awake nights. John Savage is
stunning as an L.A. policeman
who must keep h(,s lite together
after watching his partner's mur
der. lames Woods plays the killer
with elegant cruelty. Despite

Apocalypse Now * * * *
Old Mill
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad I
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit

stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
