About $6000 was raised by the 1100
students who participated in a last
held here Nov. 20. Sponsored by the
Stanford Committee on Hunger, the
event benetits several hunger reliet
organizations.
"The last was a way to get
campus-wide attention and locus it
on the issue ot hunger; many people
may not have participated in the fast
but just about everyone was aware
that it was going on," said Lam Rice,
member ot the hunger committee.
About 50 percent ot the raised
lunds will to go to Oxtam America
and 25 percent to the Ecumenical
Hunger Program in Palo Alto. The
remaining 25 percent will be divided
between Barrio Assistance, Church
World Service, Red Cross, Unicel,
Bread lor the World and World Vis
ion.
Rebates tor students forgoing
Food Service meals that day totaled
$3760. "The Committee is especially
grateful to FoocJ Service lor their
cooperation because the last in

volved a lot ol work on their part,"
said Rice.
The purpose ot the fast was not
only to raise money for benefiting
hunger reliet groups, but also to
raise consciousness in the Stanford
community.
"The committee was very pleased
that so many students cared enough
to participate in the day ol last," Rice
reported. "I hope that the impact of
going without food tor one day
raised some issues in students'
minds that won't be easily torgot
ten."
The hunger committee now hopes
to concentrate on smaller projects,
such as films and discussions, in
order to delve more deeply into
hunger issues, she said.
"A lot ot work needs to be done on
campus to break the attitude ol com
placency that Stanford can generate.
There is complacency about our own
roles in global problems. This must
be broken il real solutions are to be
lound," Rice said.
