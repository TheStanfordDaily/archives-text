# Sinsemilla paces fast-growing industry
## Big profits help reseed California pot crop 
### Associated Press 
Thousands of commerical and amateur growers
are making California the top marijuana producer
in the United States, law enforcement authorities
say. They believe marijuana has become one of the
state's most lucrative crops.
The size of the well-concealed annual crop can
not be estimated, but even the most conservative
guesses set California's underground cultivation
industry as a multimillion dollar business produc
ing tons of marijuana in gardens all over the state.
It is an untaxed industry made all the more pro
fitable by the emergence in the last five years of a
highly potent, seedless variety of marijuana plant
called California sinsemilla.
Higher prices
With a dramatic increase in potency has come a
jump in the asking price. While an ounce of pot
sold for $10 in the late 19605, an ounce of mani
cured sinsemilla buds can bring $125 to $200 on
the street this year.
And from the mountainous pine forests of the
northern coastal counties to the brushy high de
serts in the south, the increase in cultivation has

kept pace with the prices that the potent bud
commands among smokers.
"Any place in the state that is remote, sparsely
populated and which offers some concealment,
you'll find sinsemilla being grown," said Steve
Helsley, chief narcotics officer for the state De
partment of Justice.
More growers
Despite the fact that cultivation of even one
marijuana plant is a felony in California, the
number of growers is increasing yearly.
Authorities believe the industry reportedly has a
profound effect on the economies of some North
ern California counties, and there appear to be
few counties in the state that do not produce at
least $1 million worth of commercial marijuana
annually.
Most observers compare the phenomenon to
Prohibition and to the moonshiners in the South.
"Here's a chance to be a socially acceptable
outlaw," explained Patrick Cassidy, who said he
has been growing marijuana in Big Sur on the
California coast about 150 miles south of San Fran
cisco.

"Society accepts the pot farmers," he said.
"We're like heroes."
Over the years Mendocino and Humboldt coun
ties in Northern California have gained a reputa
tion among smokers and lawmen alike as the
state's sinsemilla breadbasket.
But other parts ot the state also are major pro
ducers, from the undulating, sage-covered high
desert country in Riverside County to the rugged
canyons of Santa Cruz County and the western
slopes of the Central Sierra.
Urban cultivation
Authorities and pot smokers agree that small
gardens tor personal use pervade even urban
areas.
The demand for domestic marijuana increased
throughout the state when the Mexican govern
ment tried to destroy the smuggling trade by
spraying paraquat poison on pot fields south of
the U.S. border. An increasing number of Califor
nians, fearing lung damage from the paraquat
tainted grass, turned to fhe domestically produced
product.
