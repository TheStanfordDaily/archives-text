# Contributions flow for ailing Daily Cal

### Rich Hefter 
The worst is over for the crippled
UC-Berkeley student newspaper,
The Daily Californian, in their battle
against bankruptcy and foreclosure,
according to the newspaper's
editor-in-chief, Tom Abate.
"We're starting to get in a more
comfortable position," said Abate,
who said that the paper was barely
able to meet its operating expendi
tures at the outset ol the quarter.
Revenue from fund raising drives
and contributions is now allowing
fhe Daily Cal more breathing room in
meeting its printing bills and debts
from last year's financial trouble.
Independent newspaper
The paper, which declared itself
independent from UC-Berkeley in
1971, almost went bankrupt last year
as a result of financial mismanage
ment and increased printing costs,
according to Abate.
But a $52,000 Berkeley studenl se
nate loan last spring saved the paper
from having to shut down.
This fall, the newspaper began
operating already well in debt, with
out any cash reserves and with pay
ments for advertisements not due
until December, Abate said.
So it had to resort to "extensive
l und raising drives to meet October's
and November's print bills," Abate
said.

The fund raising has been success
ful, "the most dangerous part" has
passed, Abate said.
Contributions
He revealed that the paper has col
lected well over $3000 from alumni
contributions and that they expect a
similar amount will be donated by
tormer Daily Cal staffers.
In addition, the paper has made
about $6000 from a donation drive
that will conclude today with a raffle.
"First prize is a full page in the
Daily Cal — the winner can do what
ever he pleases," Abate said. Other
prizes include a one month parking
space near campus, and a tour of San
Pablo area bars, he added.
Land donation
A Berkeley resident donated a
piece of land in Colorado that the
newspaper plans to sell to bring in
more revenue, Abate said.
While fhe most difficult times are
behind, the newspaper still has "a
tough year ahead," according to
Abate.
"We'll be running a tight paper all
year round, working to increase ad
vertising sales — a main source of
revenue.
"We're doing pretty well — we're
still publishing and that's always a
comfort," Abate added.
