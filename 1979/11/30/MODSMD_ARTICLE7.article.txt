## U.S. files World Court suit against Iran 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Un
ited States filed suit against
Iran yesterday in the Interna
tional Court of lustice in The
Hague, seeking an order tor the
release of the 49 Americans
held hostage in Tehran.
Details of the suit were not
immediately available. But the
function of the court is to arbit
rate disputes between United
Nations members.
The United States and Iran
have signed several conven
tions and treaties which obli
gate them to protect the
others' diplomats.
The World Court, however,
has no mechanism to force Iran
to obey an order. The move
was apparently another in what
President Jimmy Carter said
Wednesday night would be an
exhaustive effort to use peace
tul and legal means to gain re
lease of the hostages.
Saying he cannot set a dead
line for release of the hostages,

Carter asked the American
people to be determined but
patient.
Meanwhile, Iranian Consul
officials in Los Angeles remain
firm in their belief that the 49
U.S. hostages in Tehran can be
freed only if President Carter
returns the deposed shah to
Iran, a step Carter says he
won't take.
Former Attorney General
C.riffin Bell said in Beverly Hills
Wednesday that the president
"has handled the Iranian crisis
just right so far" — a crisis he
called "an act of war without
calling it a war."
Following Carter's nationally
televised news conference
Wednesday night on the sei
zure of the U.S. hostages at the
American Embassy, Iranian
Student Affairs Consul Reza
Shaker said "President Carter
could solve this problem very
quickly by extraditing the shah
to Iran." He added he saw "no

thing new" in the president's
remarks.
Bell, speaking to tne Ameri
can Jewish Committee's 1979
Human Relations Award din
ner, was critical of a trip to
Tehran by Rep. George Han
sen, R-ldaho, and coverage of
the crisis by the news media as
well.
Combined, they are
"exacerbating the situation by
acting like they are
negotiators," said Bell, who
now practices law in Atlanta.
Hansen's recent talks with Ira
nian students and news media
interviews give Iranians
"reason to believe that the
American people are not back
ing the president's stand."
Other Iranians in Los
Angeles had harsh words for
the president and his speech.
"It was a nice speech, but it
wasn't true," said Kayhan
Solmn, oneof ten Iranians who

watched the president along
with other students at the Uni
versity ot Southern Califor
nia, which has the largest con
centration of Iranians of any
U.S. school.
The Iranians expressed
unanimous support for Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini despite
pro-Carter sentiment from
their American counterparts,
who were also watching the
president at the campus ac
tivities center.
"It is worth war," the 20-
year-old Solmn, an under
graduate majoring in en
gineering and computer sci
ence, said atter the news con
ference.
However, Bill Rhienschild, a
22-year-old business major
from Los Angeles, ran out of
patience. "I've had it,"he said,
"and so have all the students at
USC and UCLA. It it comes to
war, there are a lot ready to join
up tomorrow.
