# Turkey tightens security for papal visit

Istanbul, Turkey (AP) — The
government on Tuesday can
celed a planned papal motor
cade in Izmir, the scene of re
cent violent anti-American
demonstrations, and reflecting
the heavy security measures
lor Pope John Paul ll's three
day Turkish visit, which began
Wednesday.
Instead ol making a 72-mile
drive today trom the Aegean
coastal city to the ruins ot
Ephesus, where he will visit a
shrine dedicated to the Virgin
Mary, the pope will travel by
helicopter, and will lly to other
points "whenever possible."
Officials say there will be a
minimum ot contact between
the pope and citizens because
authorities are concerned
about the political violence
that is taking about live lives a
day in this nation.

Government sources said
1000 marksmen are on guard in
Izmir along with "assault
squads," and Premier
Suleyman Demirel said "all
security measures" have been
taken to protect the pontiff.
Fourth foreign trip
The pope is in Turkey to talk
with leaders ot the Eastern Or
thodox church's 200 million
members about reunifying it
with his Roman Catholic
Church, now with 700 million
members. It is his fourth visit to
foreign lands this year, but this
time there are no cheering
throngs.
Turkey's 45 million residents
are 98 percent Moslem, and
because of the growing vio
lence and animosity in the
Moslem world against the
West, particularly in Iran, the
NATO nation's welcome will

probably be low-key, except
tor a few small crowds of Chris
tians.
The official papal itinerary
published by the Turkish gov
ernment does not mention the
pope's meeting with Eastern
Orthodox Patriarch Demetrius
I or other Eastern Orthodox
leaders.
Constantinople, as Istanbul
was then known, broke from
the Vatican in 1054 in a battle
over papal supremacy. Pope
Leo IX and Patriarch Michael
Cerularius, excommunicated
each other and schism has en
dured.
Villagers prepare
Meanwhile, the tiny village
of Polonezkoy, near Istanbul
prepared a surprise welcome
tor the pope.
"This is indeed an ideal place
tor him to relax and teel at

home a while," said Adolt Wil
kochewski, a 72-year-old re
tired farmer living in pictures
que Polonezkoy, which is
populated by descendants ot
Polish settlers.
"We are willing to make him
torget his homesickness," said
Wilkochewsi with a broad
smile on his sun-burnt tace.
Eighty Poles of Turkish citi
zenship lead an isolated life in
Polonezkoy, about 45 miles
north of Istanbul near the Black
Sea coast.
Polonezkoy is hidden be
hind pine groves and accessi
ble only by a rough asphalt
road, and the villagers thrive by
raising pigs and renting rooms
to tourists.
They have retained their lan
guage and culture, and the vil
lage, unlike the cluttered Tur
kish settlements with flat
roofed houses, consists of
slope-rooted dwellings scat
tered in a hillside meadow.
A Roman Catholic priest
comes here from Istanbul once
every two weeks to sing Mass
in Turkish tor close to 70
people at the Santa Maria
church atop the village hill.
