You get the same amount of light for
different amounts of energy
1 -100 watt, 2-60 watt or 4-40 watt light bulbs give you about the same
amount of light but the 60 watt bulbs use 20% more energy and the 40
watt bulbs use 60% more energy.
Whenever you have more than 1 bulb in a light fixture try to replace the
multiple bulbs with only one bulb. (Do not exceed the maximum
recommended light bulb size labled on the light fixture.)
Replacing 1-100 watt bulb for 4-40 watt bulbs would save about
$22.00 in one year for a light operating 24 hours per day.
