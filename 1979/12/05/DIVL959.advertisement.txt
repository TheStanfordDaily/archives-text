TAKE STANFORD HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS
Two Great Gifts
1980 STANFORD FOLIO TWO ALBUM/CALENDAR
A splendid full-color wall calendar with outstanding photographs of the
Stanford campus. Each month's calendar gives you all major holidays and
important Stanford dates. ($4.95)
A GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE PORTABLE STANFORD
A series of incisive, beautifully illustrated hooks on topics of contemporary
interest. Each hook is written by a distinguished scholar on the Stanford
faculty in lively, nontechnical language for the intelligent layman.
A PS gift subscription includes four Portable Stanford volumes and a
handsome gold-embossed Stanford-Red slipcase. ($25.00)
The first PS gift volume will arrive before Christmas along with the library
slipcase and a handsome card announcing your gift. The remaining three PS
gift volumes arrive individually, providing a thoughtful gift that will last
through the year.
Available at Bowman Alumni House, just behind Tresidder.
