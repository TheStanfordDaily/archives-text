# Afghan refugees cross into Pakistan

Peshawar, Pakistan (AP) —
Refugees are crossing into
Pakistan from Afghanistan at
the rate of more than 1000 a day
and by spring as many as a
half-million are likely to have
flooded into this country, a
Pakistani official here says.
The sudden influx of re
fugees was triggered by a mas
sive offensive launched by Af
ghan government troops in
October against "mujahid

deen" — Moslem sacred war
riors who have been fighting
for the past 19 months against
the Soviet-backed Afghan re
gime, now led by President
Hafizullah Amin.
Afghanistan, like Pakistan, is
a predominantly Moslem
country and many Moslems
oppose the Marxist taint of
their new government.
The official count of Afghan
refugees who have taken

haven in Pakistan is given as
262,000 but a reliable estimate
put the figure closer to 300,000.
Pakistan, itself facing an
economic crisis and importing
wheat, cooking oil and tea for
its own people, is having diffi
culty providing for them.
U.S. contribution
The Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees
has given funds for only
185,000 Afghans, an aid official
said. The U.S. government is
expected to make a $2 million
cash contribution, according
to a U.S. official in Islamabad.
Western diplomats said star
vation was not likely but condi
tions, except at a few "model"
refugee camps, were generally
dismal. Some Afghans have
lost their livestock to disease
and most will have to endure
freezing weather this winter in
tents.
"In many places, I have seen
people without shelter, living

under trees," said a foreign re
lief official. "But the Pakistan
government has made an effort
to ease the situation." It gives
each refugee four rupees (ab
out 55 cents) a day for food.
'Staring blankly'
At the Khyber Hospital here,
15-year-old Akram Khan, one
of the refugees, lay on a bed,
staring blankly and too weak to
raise his head from the pillow.
Doctors said the shepherd's
son is lucky to be alive.
"A lot of Afghan refugees die
on the way because it can take
weeks to reach Peshawar,"
said Dr. Nawab Khan, head of
the hospital, now crowded
with Afghans suffering battle
wounds or dysentery and mal
nutrition like Akram.
Akram was carried three
days on his father's back to
Pakistan after his family suc
cessfully eluded Afghan troops
for 50 days in mountain hide
outs.
