# Americans support attack if Iran hostages are harmed
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Americans
say they would not like to see
the United States launch a re
venge attack on Iran if the U.S.
citizens now held hostage in
Tehran are released un
harmed, an Associated Press-
NBC News poll says.
But it the hostages are
harmed — or even put on trial
as Iranian militants have
threatened — the public
strongly backs a U.S. military
attack, despite their deep
worry that war could result
from this crisis.
President Jimmy Carter got
high marks from Americansfor
his handling of the hostage
situation, with more than three
times as many approving his
actions as disapproving. They
think he is doing all he can to
get the hostages freed, and
they agree that the deposed
Shah of Iran should not be ex
changed for the hostages, as
the Iranian militants have de
manded.
The poll was taken Tuesday
and Wednesday, in the fourth
week of the Iranian crisis. It
was completed before Carter's
news conference last Wednes
day night.
Fifty Americans are still held
hostage by Iranian militants in
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
The militants have said the hos
tages would be freed if the Un
ited States sent the shah, cur
rently in San Antonio, Texas,
recuperating from medical
treatment, back to Iran to be
tried for alleged war crimes.
High awareness
The seizure of the embassy
and the Americans there,
coupled with threats against
the hostages, has made quite
an impression on the public.
Ninety-eight percent of the
public said they had heard or
read of the hostage situation —
a very high level of public
awareness.

Eighty-one percent of those
who said they knew about the
crisis were "personally
angered" by the taking of hos
tages. Sixteen percent said
they were not angry. Three
percent of the 1381 adults in
terviewed across the country
by telephone were not sure.
The possibility of U.S. milit
ary action against Iran has left
Americans grimly resolved in
the face of difficult choices.
For example, if the hostages
are released unharmed, 79
percent would oppose a re
taliatory U.S. attack on Iran.
Only 14 percent would support
such revenge, and 7 percent of
those who had heard of the
crisis were not sure.
But if the hostages are
harmed or put on trial, Ameri
can sentiment is quite diffe
rent.
Support for attack
Sixty-six percent of those
who have heard about the Ira
nian crisis said they would
support a U.S. military attack
against Iran if the hostages
were tried or even put on trial.
Twenty-one percent said they
would not support a military
strike under such cir
cumstances, and 13 percent
were not sure.
The dangers inherent in the
Iranian crisis are clearly appa
rent to Americans.
In just a year, the number of
Americans who say a war in
volving the United States is
"very likely" has tripled.
Thirty-two percent of those in
terviewed this week said such a
war was "very likely" within
the next three years.
One year ago, only 10 per
cent of the public foresaw a
war. ,
War likely?
This month, 39 percent said
war is somewhat likely and 26
percent said war is not likely.
Three percent were not sure.

In the November 1978 AP-NBC
News poll, 26 percent said war
was somewhat likely; 60 per
cent said it was not likely and
four percent were not sure.
Carter's handling of the deli
cate situation drew applause
from the public.
Sixty-seven percent said they
approved of Carter's handling
of the crisis and only 21 percent
disapproved. Twelve percent
had not heard of the crisis or
were not sure.
This favorable rating is in
sharp contrast to the opinion
of Americans of his work over
all in recent months. The Sep
tember AP/NBC News poll
found that public opinion of
Carter was at the lowest point
for any president in more than
two decades.
A critical element in the posi
tive rating of Carter's handling
of the crisis is that the presi
dent is seen as trying just
as hard as he can to get the
Americans freed. Seventy-one
percent said Carter is doing all
he can inthesituation,while23
percent said he is not making
the maximum effort. Six per
cent were not sure.

This favorable rating is in
sharp contrast to the opinion

found that public opinion of
Carter was at the lowest point

two decades.
A critical element in the posi

Americans polled by The Associated Press and NBC support Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's efforts and tactics to «ain the release of the
American hostages held in Tehran.
New York (AP) — Americans
say they would not like to see
the United States launch a re
venge attack on Iran if the U.S.
citizens now held hostage in
Tehran are released un
harmed, an Associated Press-
NBC News poll says.
But it the hostages are
harmed — or even put on trial
as Iranian militants have
threatened — the public
strongly backs a U.S. military
attack, despite their deep
worry that war could result
from this crisis.
President Jimmy Carter got
high marks from Americansfor
his handling of the hostage
situation, with more than three
times as many approving his
actions as disapproving. They
think he is doing all he can to
get the hostages freed, and
they agree that the deposed
Shah of Iran should not be ex
changed for the hostages, as
the Iranian militants have de
manded.
The poll was taken Tuesday
and Wednesday, in the fourth
week of the Iranian crisis. It
was completed before Carter's
news conference last Wednes
day night.
Fifty Americans are still held
hostage by Iranian militants in
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
The militants have said the hos
tages would be freed if the Un
ited States sent the shah, cur
rently in San Antonio, Texas,
recuperating from medical
treatment, back to Iran to be
tried for alleged war crimes.
High awareness
The seizure of the embassy
and the Americans there,
coupled with threats against
the hostages, has made quite
an impression on the public.
Ninety-eight percent of the
public said they had heard or
read of the hostage situation —
a very high level of public
awareness.

Eighty-one percent of those
who said they knew about the
crisis were "personally
angered" by the taking of hos
tages. Sixteen percent said
they were not angry. Three
percent of the 1381 adults in
terviewed across the country
by telephone were not sure.
The possibility of U.S. milit
ary action against Iran has left
Americans grimly resolved in
the face of difficult choices.
For example, if the hostages
are released unharmed, 79
percent would oppose a re
taliatory U.S. attack on Iran.
Only 14 percent would support
such revenge, and 7 percent of
those who had heard of the
crisis were not sure.
But if the hostages are
harmed or put on trial, Ameri
can sentiment is quite diffe
rent.
Support for attack
Sixty-six percent of those
who have heard about the Ira
nian crisis said they would
support a U.S. military attack
against Iran if the hostages
were tried or even put on trial.
Twenty-one percent said they
would not support a military
strike under such cir
cumstances, and 13 percent
were not sure.
The dangers inherent in the
Iranian crisis are clearly appa
rent to Americans.
In just a year, the number of
Americans who say a war in
volving the United States is
"very likely" has tripled.
Thirty-two percent of those in
terviewed this week said such a
war was "very likely" within
the next three years.
One year ago, only 10 per
cent of the public foresaw a
war. ,
War likely?
This month, 39 percent said
war is somewhat likely and 26
percent said war is not likely.
Three percent were not sure.
