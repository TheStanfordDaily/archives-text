Nabatiyeh, Lebanon (AP) â€” Screaming ambu
lances rushed off bleeding, unconsciouszealots
Friday as Lebanon's Shiite Moslem admirers of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini spilled their own
blood in a delirious festival showing the
strength of their religious faith.
The sunrise celebrations began quietly, with
young men and children donning white "ka
fans," death shrouds, and beating their heads
and chests to lament the slaying of the Shiite

saint Imam Hossein 14 centuries ago.
The festival gradually built to a crescendo and,
by midday, the whirling crowds brandished
scalpel-sharp swords and hit their heads amid
shrieks of joy and pain.
Nabatiyeh, often the target of artillery shelling
by Israeli-backed Christian militias, was secure
and festive through the day. The militiamen of
Lebanese army renegade Maj. Saad Haddad had
told the townspeople there would be no shel
ling.
