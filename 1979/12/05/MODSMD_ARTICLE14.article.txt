# Iranians vote to approve ayatollah's rule
## 
### 
Tehran, Iran (AP) — The
Iranian people, in a vast show
of support for the Moslem
elder who has made the hold
ing of American hostages part
of a holy crusade, voted over
whelmingly Monday to make
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
their political overlord for life.
Initial returns of a two-day
referendum that ended Mon
day showed Iranians voting
60-to-1 in favor of new con
stitution that Khomeini's polit
ical critics say will make him a
theocratic dictator.
Though final official results

will not be announced until
later in the week, Iranian vot
ers obviously did what the Is
lamic leadership had urged in
the non-secret, yes-or-no bal
loting.
Reporters saw bearded, tur
baned mullahs — Moslem
priests — seated in front of bal
lot boxes at several polling sta
tions instructing people to
"vote yes only."
Colored slips
Then the mullahs, or anyone
else, could see whether the
voter put the green, for "yes,"
or red, for "no," slip into the
ballot box.
The Khomeini regime,
meanwhile, stepped up public
readiness for an eventual U.S.
military attack, expected by
many Iranians. It posted more
guards at the U.S. Embassy,
where 50 Americans entered
their 30th day of captivity in the
hands of Moslem militants
demanding that the United
States hand over the deposed
Shah of Iran.
For the first time some of the
guards were dressed in green
army fatigues and boots.

In an unexplained develop
ment, an ambulance was seen
moving from point to point
within the embassy com
pound. A student spokesman
contacted by telephone said
the hostages were "all well"
but would not say why the am
bulance went to the embassy.
Security Council
At U.N. headquarters in New
York, the Security Council was
still seeking diplomatic ways
out of the month-long U.S.-
Iran crisis. Among the alterna
tives under consideration was
launching of an international
inquiry into the ex-shah's re
gime, and sending a Council
mediation mission to Iran.
In other developments:
— A pro-government news
paper in Panama said Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, re
cuperating from medical
treatment at a Texas Air Force
base, would be given asylum in
that Central American nation.
But Panamanian government
officials denied it.
— Western diplomatic
sources and a Beirut news
paper reported that Saudi Ara

bian troops put down pro-
Iranian demonstrations by
thousands of Shiite Moslems
last week in eastern Saudi
Arabia, and several protesters
were killed or wounded.
Bomb blast
— A bomb exploded outside
the office of Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co. early Monday, exten
sively damaging the exterior of
the American bank, police
said. No one was injured.
Windows were shattered
and an exterior cement wall
damaged by the explosion
shortly after 1:30 a.m. in
downtown Frankfurt, police
said.
Last week, Morgan Guaranty
shocked the West German fi
nancial community by obtain
ing a German court order at
taching Iran's 25 percent share
in Krupp industries. The bank
claimed Iran had failed to make
payment on a loan.
"There is obviously a con
nnection between the explo
sion and the bank's attachment
of Iran's Krupp shares," a
police spokesman said after
the explosion.

of Iran's Krupp shares," a
police spokesman said after
the explosion.
