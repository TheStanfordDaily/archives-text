Istanbul, Turkey (AP) — Pope
John Paul II ended his three
day visit to Turkey on Friday
optimistic about results of his
reunification talks with Pat
riarch Demetrius I of the East
ern Orthodox Church.
The pope began the last of
his three day sin Turkey at a full
Orthodox service — becoming
the first pope to do so since the
Great Schism of 1054 split the
churches. He attended the St.
Andrew's feast day service at
St. George Orthodox church,
then visited the ancient city of
Ephesus before returning to
Rome Friday evening.
Although the pope did not
join in celebrating the Divine
Liturgy at St. George Orthodox
Church, he hummed through
the liturgy in a low voice and
made the sign of the cross from
right to left in the Orthodox
manner, and not from left to
right as Roman Catholics usu
ally do.
"This visit to the primary
throne of the Orthodox church
. . . . My participation in this
liturgy . . . show with clarity
the will of the entire Roman
Catholic church to go forward
in the march toward unity of all

.. . the pope said to the pat
riarch and the several hundred
persons packed in the tiny
cathedral.
Replying, Demetrius
explained, "We too search and
desire peace and goodness. . .
It is toward this aim that our
two churches come out of their
isolation and alienation — not
to say hostility — in order to
take the road of this meeting
and reconciliation."
In a joint declaration the two
said they had made progress in
their talks, and an informed
Vatican source said the pope
felt "quite close" to agreement
with the patriarch on some
major concepts. "The Holy
Father also believes that sister
churches could differ in their
liturgy, in their usages, in their
expressions, in thv, manifesta
tion of their faith, and even in
their theology and still be
one," the source said.
Tight security was in evi
dence, as at previous appear
ances at religious ceremonies
since the pope's arrival in Ank
ara Wednesday.
Extremist Moslems claimed
responsibilitity for explosions
at nine Istanbul bank branches
overnight, protesting the
pope's visit.
"We affirm anew our firm
desire for full communion,"
Demetrius and John Paul said
in a joint declaration. They said
they had made progress and
later would name members of
a mixed commission for
"theological dialogue."
John Paul was flown to the
Aegean coastal city of Izmir,
then went by helicopter to
Ephesus, the ancient Greek
city where the Virgin Mary was
said to have lived before her
death, and where the Second
Ecumenical Council in 431
proclaimed her the mother of
God.
Taking advantage of relaxed
security around the mountain
top shrine dedicated to the
Virgin Mary, the pope moved
about freely, exchanging
pleasantries with those who
came to see him.
As he toured the shrine, a
single shot rang out in the dis
tance, creating anxiety among
the crowd. Associated Press
reporter Ismail Kovaci re
ported that a soldier on guard
in the area had accidentally
fired his rifle and that no one
was hit.
