## We must restore American honor 
### 
The reaction — in the White
House, on the streets of
American cities, and, to some
degree, on the Stanford cam
pus — to the month-long
tragedy in Iran reflects poorly
on the judgment and character
of the people and rulers of the
United States.
The U.S. government has
risked the lives of fifty Ameri
cans in its determination to
protect the shah.
Yet, no one seriously dis
putes the basic facts of the
shah's criminality.
The shah is a thief who has
stolen — via taxation and other
means — billions of dollars
from the citizens of Iran.
More importantly, he is a
mass murderer responsible for
the deaths of thousands of
people.
The fact that Khomeini is also
a criminal is irrelevant: the
criminality of one person does
not erase the crimes of
another.
To return the shah to Iran is
the only course of action con
sistent with reason, justice and
humanity.
Those persons — Carter,
Vance, Kissinger, David Roc
kefeller, etc. —who have acted
to protect the shah are guilty of
obstruction of justice.
Those Americans who argue
that returning the shah would
violate the honor of the United
States have robbed the con
cept of "honor" of any intellig
ible meaning.
For four decades, the rulers
of this country have trampled
on America's honor by re
peatedly allying this nation
with vicious and despotic re
gimes — the shah's regime in
Iran, Stalinist Russia during the
forties, Communist China in
the seventies, etc.
This pragmatic and unprin
cipled policy has resulted in
world-wide hatred and opposi
tion towaids the United States
and cynicism towards the prin
ciples which America still pre
tends to uphold.
To return the shah would
mark a repudiation of the dis
astrous policy of supporting
and protecting despots and
would be a first step towards
America's regaining of honor
and influence in the world.
The legitimate tear that the
shah would not receive due
process in Iran could be as
suaged by declaring that the
United States would extradite
the shah only after establishing
his guilt beyond a reasonable

doubt in American courts —
thereby ensuring that the shah
would receive all the protec
tion of the Anglo-American
system of justice.
If the United States further
announced that it would return
the shah regardless ot the ac
tions of the Tehran terrorists
and that this decision was not a
"caving-in" to the terrorists
but rather the start of a new
direction in U.S. foreign pol
icy, the risk of setting a prece
dent that might incite future
terrorism would be lessened.
Unfortunately, such a policy
of sanity and responsibility has
received no public hearing in
this country in the past month.
Instead, ugly mobs have
taken to American streets,
blaming all Iranians for the ac
tions taken by a few Iranians.
Carter has encouraged and
endorsed this primitive idea of
collective guilt and responsibil
ity by ordering the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to
harass Iranians resident in the
United States.
Carter's irresponsible ap
proach is further shown by his

veiled threats of military action
and of reprisal against Iran
after the hostage crisis is resol
ved.
The motives behind Carter's
irresponsible saber-rattling are
rather clear.
First, Carter and his underl
ings — and most other mem
bers of the American political
establishment — praised,
aided and condoned the de
spotic regime of the shah. They
are understandably reluctant
to admit publicly the enormity
of the shah's crimes, crimes in
which they share complicity.
Second, Carter is a nearly
lame-duck president desper
ately trying to salvage his polit
ical fortune. "Acting presiden
tial" — i.e., being a swagger
ingly authoritarian bully-boy
— is evidently an effective way
of rallying the public. (Kho
meini seems to be acting from
a similar motive.)
Threats of military action call
to mind Randolph Bourne's
aphorism, "War is the health of
the state": an incumbent pres
ident has never lost the elec

tion during a period when the
United States was at war.
Finally, politicians and au
tocrats have a remarkable
sense of group interest and
hanging-togetherness. In this
country, there has been a
nearly unanimous bipartisan
consensus in tavor of protect
ing the shah from justice.
In toreign capitals, as Carter
has emphasized, from the
aging autocrats in the Kremlin
to the crazy colonel who rules
Libya, foreign tyrants have
given unanimous support to
Carter's position.
It is too late to reverse Car
ter's irresponsible actions dur
ing this crisis. But it is not too
late to understand, evaluate
and condemn those actions
and to begin working towards a
future in which such men do
not hold the reins of power — a
future which abandons the ob
solete bipartisan dogmas of
liberalism and conservatism
and turns instead to libertarian
policies based on justice,
human liberty and the rights of
the individual.

More importantly, he is a
mass murderer responsible for
the deaths of thousands of
people.
The fact that Khomeini is also
a criminal is irrelevant: the
criminality of one person does
not erase the crimes of
another.
To return the shah to Iran is
the only course of action con
sistent with reason, justice and
humanity.
Those persons — Carter,
Vance, Kissinger, David Roc
kefeller, etc. —who have acted
to protect the shah are guilty of
obstruction of justice.
Those Americans who argue
that returning the shah would
violate the honor of the United
States have robbed the con
cept of "honor" of any intellig
ible meaning.
For four decades, the rulers
of this country have trampled
on America's honor by re
peatedly allying this nation
with vicious and despotic re
gimes — the shah's regime in
Iran, Stalinist Russia during the
forties, Communist China in
the seventies, etc.
This pragmatic and unprin
cipled policy has resulted in
world-wide hatred and opposi
tion towaids the United States
and cynicism towards the prin
ciples which America still pre
tends to uphold.
To return the shah would
mark a repudiation of the dis
astrous policy of supporting
and protecting despots and
would be a first step towards
America's regaining of honor
and influence in the world.
The legitimate tear that the
shah would not receive due
process in Iran could be as
suaged by declaring that the
United States would extradite
the shah only after establishing
his guilt beyond a reasonable

doubt in American courts —
thereby ensuring that the shah
would receive all the protec
tion of the Anglo-American
system of justice.
If the United States further
announced that it would return
the shah regardless ot the ac
tions of the Tehran terrorists
and that this decision was not a
"caving-in" to the terrorists
but rather the start of a new
direction in U.S. foreign pol
icy, the risk of setting a prece
dent that might incite future
terrorism would be lessened.
Unfortunately, such a policy
of sanity and responsibility has
received no public hearing in
this country in the past month.
Instead, ugly mobs have
taken to American streets,
blaming all Iranians for the ac
tions taken by a few Iranians.
Carter has encouraged and
endorsed this primitive idea of
collective guilt and responsibil
ity by ordering the Immigration
and Naturalization Service to
harass Iranians resident in the
United States.
Carter's irresponsible ap
proach is further shown by his

veiled threats of military action
and of reprisal against Iran
after the hostage crisis is resol
ved.
The motives behind Carter's
irresponsible saber-rattling are
rather clear.
First, Carter and his underl
ings — and most other mem
bers of the American political
establishment — praised,
aided and condoned the de
spotic regime of the shah. They
are understandably reluctant
to admit publicly the enormity
of the shah's crimes, crimes in
which they share complicity.
Second, Carter is a nearly
lame-duck president desper
ately trying to salvage his polit
ical fortune. "Acting presiden
tial" — i.e., being a swagger
ingly authoritarian bully-boy
— is evidently an effective way
of rallying the public. (Kho
meini seems to be acting from
a similar motive.)
Threats of military action call
to mind Randolph Bourne's
aphorism, "War is the health of
the state": an incumbent pres
ident has never lost the elec

tion during a period when the
United States was at war.
Finally, politicians and au
tocrats have a remarkable
sense of group interest and
hanging-togetherness. In this
country, there has been a
nearly unanimous bipartisan
consensus in tavor of protect
ing the shah from justice.
In toreign capitals, as Carter
has emphasized, from the
aging autocrats in the Kremlin
to the crazy colonel who rules
Libya, foreign tyrants have
given unanimous support to
Carter's position.
It is too late to reverse Car
ter's irresponsible actions dur
ing this crisis. But it is not too
late to understand, evaluate
and condemn those actions
and to begin working towards a
future in which such men do
not hold the reins of power — a
future which abandons the ob
solete bipartisan dogmas of
liberalism and conservatism
and turns instead to libertarian
policies based on justice,
human liberty and the rights of
the individual.
(David Miller is a graduate stu
dent in physics.)
The reaction — in the White
House, on the streets of
American cities, and, to some
degree, on the Stanford cam
pus — to the month-long
tragedy in Iran reflects poorly
on the judgment and character
of the people and rulers of the
United States.
The U.S. government has
risked the lives of fifty Ameri
cans in its determination to
protect the shah.
Yet, no one seriously dis
putes the basic facts of the
shah's criminality.
The shah is a thief who has
stolen — via taxation and other
means — billions of dollars
from the citizens of Iran.
More importantly, he is a
mass murderer responsible for
the deaths of thousands of
people.

a criminal is irrelevant: the
