## Student deportation unjust 
### 
First-year law students, studying "equal pro
tection" in their constitutional law course, usu
ally read an 1886 Supreme Court case called Yick
Wo v. Hopkins. A moment's reflection on this
case may help u.s ponder our reaction to the
current effort by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service to locate and deport Ira
nian students violating technical visa require
ments.
In Yick Wo, the San Francisco Board of Super
visors had systematically denied a necessary
safety permit (to operate a laundry in a wooden
building) to every one of 200 Chinese applic
ants, while issuing permits to all but one of 80
non-Chinese applicants. Every applicant,
Chinese or not, had met basic safety require
ments.
The Supreme Court reversed a conviction
based on laundry operation without such a
permit, stating that although the law might be
"fair on its face and impartial in appearance," it
had been administered in an openly dis
criminatory fashion."No reason for (the dis
crimination) exists except hostility to the race
and nationality to which the petitioners be
long," concluded the Court.
Well, there's a lot of hostility toward Iranians
floating around today, and tremendous pres
sure to "show" Iran by kicking out those stu
dents. In singling out Iranian students for visa
checks, the INS program seems to have met
widespread popular approval.
All the while, of course, we loudly denounce
plans to try the Americans held hostage in
Tehran as "spies" unless the shah is returned to
Iran.
Along with our skepticism about the impar
tiality of any tribunal over there, we also recog
nize a fact of diplomatic life: the military attache
at any embassy is, in effect, a sanctioned spy.
We have them all over the world, and other
countries have them here. They pass informa
tion on the host country's military strength back
home, which in theory helps deterrent effect;
that's why we tolerate them.
Nonetheless, they are spies, and a tribunal in
Iran cannot help but find them out. It's a cinch.
It's also a cinch to "bust" foreign students

here for visa violations.
For example, labor protectionists have suc
ceeded in placing a condition on foreign stu
dent visas that the student may not work while in
this country. This restriction is usually ignored,
and many foreign students obtain jobs — as
busboys, stock clerks, what-have-you — in the
same markets as illegal aliens.
Indeed, the foreign-student job market is
probably better, since it has been allowed to
flourish under INS inaction.
Nonetheless, the students have violated their
visa restrictions. They have broken the law, and
are to be deported.
Never mind that fact that the criteria used by
the INS in "weeding out" illegal Iranian students
possess the same precision as a move to expel
every Stanford undergraduate who has ever
masturbated, smoked pot or read National
Lampoon. We would be more honest with
ourselves if we went ahead and deported all
Iranians summarily, rather than engage in the
elaborate ballet of "enforcing the law" fn a
parody of legality.
Otherwise, if visa technicalities are of such
signal importance that failure to obey them in
any manner means immediate deportation for
foreign students, we should be out there de
porting Canadians, Britons, French, Germans
and all those other brazen law-breakers on our
campuses.
President Carter has touted the deportation
plan as a means to defuse and co-opt anti-
Iranian hostility in this country.
Admittedly, because the bureaucratic wheels
at INS turn slowly, the president has bought
some time during which to pressure Iran before
many students actually have to leave.
But these seem like slim justifications after
Yick Wo.
We should remember that only 5Vi years ago
we sanctimoniously prepared to impeach Presi
dent Nixon lor, among other things, misusing
government agencies against political enemies.
How strange that we should applaud the same
activity today.

In Yick Wo, the San Francisco Board of Super
visors had systematically denied a necessary
safety permit (to operate a laundry in a wooden
building) to every one of 200 Chinese applic
ants, while issuing permits to all but one of 80
non-Chinese applicants. Every applicant,
Chinese or not, had met basic safety require
ments.
The Supreme Court reversed a conviction
based on laundry operation without such a
permit, stating that although the law might be
"fair on its face and impartial in appearance," it
had been administered in an openly dis
criminatory fashion."No reason for (the dis
crimination) exists except hostility to the race
and nationality to which the petitioners be
long," concluded the Court.
Well, there's a lot of hostility toward Iranians
floating around today, and tremendous pres
sure to "show" Iran by kicking out those stu
dents. In singling out Iranian students for visa
checks, the INS program seems to have met
widespread popular approval.
All the while, of course, we loudly denounce
plans to try the Americans held hostage in
Tehran as "spies" unless the shah is returned to
Iran.
Along with our skepticism about the impar
tiality of any tribunal over there, we also recog
nize a fact of diplomatic life: the military attache
at any embassy is, in effect, a sanctioned spy.
We have them all over the world, and other
countries have them here. They pass informa
tion on the host country's military strength back
home, which in theory helps deterrent effect;
that's why we tolerate them.
Nonetheless, they are spies, and a tribunal in
Iran cannot help but find them out. It's a cinch.
It's also a cinch to "bust" foreign students

here for visa violations.
For example, labor protectionists have suc
ceeded in placing a condition on foreign stu
dent visas that the student may not work while in
this country. This restriction is usually ignored,
and many foreign students obtain jobs — as
busboys, stock clerks, what-have-you — in the
same markets as illegal aliens.
Indeed, the foreign-student job market is
probably better, since it has been allowed to
flourish under INS inaction.
Nonetheless, the students have violated their
visa restrictions. They have broken the law, and
are to be deported.
Never mind that fact that the criteria used by
the INS in "weeding out" illegal Iranian students
possess the same precision as a move to expel
every Stanford undergraduate who has ever
masturbated, smoked pot or read National
Lampoon. We would be more honest with
ourselves if we went ahead and deported all
Iranians summarily, rather than engage in the
elaborate ballet of "enforcing the law" fn a
parody of legality.
Otherwise, if visa technicalities are of such
signal importance that failure to obey them in
any manner means immediate deportation for
foreign students, we should be out there de
porting Canadians, Britons, French, Germans
and all those other brazen law-breakers on our
campuses.
President Carter has touted the deportation
plan as a means to defuse and co-opt anti-
Iranian hostility in this country.
Admittedly, because the bureaucratic wheels
at INS turn slowly, the president has bought
some time during which to pressure Iran before
many students actually have to leave.
But these seem like slim justifications after
Yick Wo.
We should remember that only 5Vi years ago
we sanctimoniously prepared to impeach Presi
dent Nixon lor, among other things, misusing
government agencies against political enemies.
How strange that we should applaud the same
activity today.
