# Commencement site decision expected early winter quarter

### David Frank 
The University will decide early
next quarter whether to decrease
the number of guests attending
)une Commencement in Frost
Amphitheater or to move the
ceremony to the much larger
Stanford Stadium, according to
Susie Farr, associate director of
Public. Events.
"Overcrowding at Com
mencement has been a problem
for several years," said Farr,
whose job it is to oversee the
logistics of the ceremony. Stu
dents were allowed four guests
each at last )une's Commence
ment exercises, but hundreds of
people were unable to tind seats,
she said.
The space constraint was com
pounded in September when
Abbey Rents, the company that
previously rented all 18,000 chairs
for Commencement to the Uni
versity, discontinued its chair ren
tal business. This led to serious

consideration of alternatives to
the long-standing tradition of
Commencement in Frost.
President Richard Lyman, his
staff and other top school ad
ministrators directed Farr and
others to investigate different
courses of action.
Graduation conflicts
One of the possibilities first
considered, Farr said, was finding
other Bay Area rental companies
to supply the needed chairs.
Since, however, several other col
leges hold graduation at the same
time as Stanford, Farr continued,
the companies already had too
many obligations to be able to fill
the University's large order.
In addition, she said, "the
prices that other rental companies
charged were prohibitive. Abbey
Rents had charged 80 cents per
chair per week. These other com
panies were asking in the range of
60-80 cents per chair per day."
The Purchasing Department re

searched and estimated the cost
of buying the needed number of
chairs by taking into account all
the various storing, handling,
shipping and repair charges.
Large cost differential
Meanwhile, the Office of the
Vice President for Business and
Finance determined how such
costs could be absorbed into the
Commencement budget. In so
doing, researchers compared the
cost of purchasing the chairs for
Commencement at Frost to the
savings of holding the exercises in
the stadium. According to Farr,
the office concluded that purchas
ing the chairs would add $7000 to
the Commencement budget for
the next 10 years. The move to the
stadium would save $22,000 a
year.
Farr also said that the University
desired student input on the mat
ter and thus formed a temporary
student-staff committee. The

committee included Farr, Public
Events Director Vicky Holt, the
four senior class presidents and
staff members from areas such as
Business and Finance, Service
Operations and the Alumni As
sociation.
This group ran a letter in the
Daily twice during the week of
Nov. 27 to solicit opinions on the
subject.
"The letter was not asking
whether buying the chairs or mov
ing to the stadium is a better fi
nancial project," Farr said, "but
simply for the Stanford commun
ity, especially students, to give
their opinions as to whether we

should further limit attendance at
Commencement to keep it at
Frost, or whether the ceremony
should be moved to the stadium
to allow many more guests to at
tend. We want the feedback,"
she added.
Farr said the student-staff
committee plans to report back to
the administration early next
quarter. The final decision will be
made then, Farr said, noting that
plans must be settled as soon as
possible because of the many
logistical details to be worked out.
For example, if Commencement
remains in Frost, the chair order
would have to be sent im
mediately "since it would take

several months for them to ar
rive," she said.
Much of the sentiment for
keeping Commencement at Frost,
Parr said, is for preserving the
tradition of graduation in a beauti
ful setting. Commencement has
been held in the amphitheater
since 1937.
Gray Boyce, one of the senior
class presidents, said that some
seniors had complained about the
"impersonal" nature of graduat
ing in a football stadium.
"A few people have said they
would think twice about par
ticipating in Commencement if it
were held in the stadium," she
said.
