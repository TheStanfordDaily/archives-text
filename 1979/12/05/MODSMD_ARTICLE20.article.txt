# Abolhassan Bani Sadr
## Shah's extradition would not disgrace U.S. 
### 
(What follows is an edited version of a
Nov. 10 message of Dr. Albolhassan
Bani Sadr, then minister of foreign af
fairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, to
the United States. Bani Sadr has since
been relieved of his duties.)
Americans:
Ever since the entry of the students
into the U.S. Embassy — or more pre
cisely an important administration
and espionage center in our world —
the propaganda machine has been
conducting propaganda every day
and night intended to beguile you
Americans and the world into believ
ing that, under the Islamic regime, no
law or rule is respected, that tradi
tions, which have for centuries been
revered by humanity, are being un
dermined, that your embassy, which
is regarded as part of your country's
territory, is stormed, that persons
who enjoy diplomatic immunity are
taken as hostages, etc.
But you Americans are never told
that the so-called embassy of your
government in Iran does in no sense
resemble one as such.
Although the greatest part of the
documents were removed from the
embassy before and after the over
throw of the last U.S. puppet, and in

spite of the fact that the remaining
documents and papers were burned in
three hours and that the memories of
computers have been destroyed, the
documents and papers that have been
seized leave no doubt that the em
bassy had been the actual center ot
rule over Iran in the days of the ex
shah.
The embassy of your administration
has in fact been the real court in
Tehran.
Now ask your government whether
they would tolerate it if other coun
tries should turn their embassies in
your country into centers of rule, in
terference in general and particular
affairs and espionage in the country
and the region.
Ask your government why, contrary
to their pretenses, they have trampled
down a time-honored tradition by
transforming their embassy into a
center of rule and espionage in our
country and region.
Would you have regarded the staff
of a foreign embassy, interfering in
your internal affairs and administra
tion for 35 years, as ordinary embassy
staff had you staged a revolution and
succeeded?

Would you have acquiesced if they
had stayed on and carried on their
policy and methods as if nothing had
happened?
This is the truth which they hide
from you.
You fought against Hitlerian Ger
many, you tried Nazi leaders at
Nuremberg as war criminals under
the plea of establishing a good tradi
tion in the world. Many of them were
sentenced and put to death.
You did not forego the trial of Rudolf
Hess although he had sought asylum
in England, neither have you released
him from prison after so many years of
imprisonment although he is now a
very old man.
Now, what has happened that your
government is breaking the very tradi
tion established by your own country
and by European countries?
Why should they receive, shelter
and protect, at all cost, a most brutal
criminal? Does not the fact that the
ex-shah has been trying ever since his
departure from Iran to come to
America and the fact that the embassy
of your government in Tehran has
been making preparations to this end
reveal to you that he has been an
American puppet throughout?

Is this right and proper for your
government to force someone on a
country and give him free rein to
commit any sort of crime, treachery,
robbery and corruption and to bring
him subsequently to your country to
protect him?
Would it be expecting too much if
our people urged your government to
extradite, in reference to the tradition
established by the trial of Nazi lead
ers, the most notorious criminal of the
century to Iran in order that he might
be tried publicly and fairly?
They are telling you a lie when they
say that extradition of the ex-shah
would be a disgrace to the American
people. On the contrary, it would be a
great victory for you Americans as well
as for freedom-promoting traditions
and for the spirit of justice of man
kind.
Your government, through a bunch
of traitors, has exposed our economy
to annihilation and now threatens us
wiTh economic boycott and refusal to sell
goods to us. You must know that:
1) The ruin of Iran will be a great loss
to humanity. This very economic
threat must make you aware how your
government, through the ex-shah's

regime has destroyed our economy.
In order to continue to live, Iran has
no option but to succeed in her Is
lamic Revolution.
2) Economic boycott does not
trighten us. The reason being, in fact
to save our ruined economy, we have
no option but to depend on ourse
lves.
History has subjected both of us to
one of the greatest trials. We wish you
to look carefully into the contents of
this message and if you find Iranian
people rightful, ask your government
to sincerely observe human rights and
hand over the ex-shah and his proper
ties and those of his relatives and high
ranking officials of the former regime
to our nation.
If this takes place, would anybody
betray his people anymore? Would
anybody be prepared to make mas
sacre, torture, execution and corrup
tion the sole way to rule?
Rest assured that your compatriots
are treated humanely and have no an
xiety about their comfort. In this con
nection, everything has been done to
remove any cause for anxiety.

this message and if you find Iranian
people rightful, ask your government
to sincerely observe human rights and
hand over the ex-shah and his proper
ties and those of his relatives and high
ranking officials of the former regime
to our nation.
If this takes place, would anybody
betray his people anymore? Would
anybody be prepared to make mas
sacre, torture, execution and corrup
tion the sole way to rule?
Rest assured that your compatriots
are treated humanely and have no an
xiety about their comfort. In this con
nection, everything has been done to
remove any cause for anxiety.

Americans:
Ever since the entry of the students
into the U.S. Embassy — or more pre
cisely an important administration
and espionage center in our world —
the propaganda machine has been
conducting propaganda every day
and night intended to beguile you
Americans and the world into believ
ing that, under the Islamic regime, no
law or rule is respected, that tradi
tions, which have for centuries been
revered by humanity, are being un
dermined, that your embassy, which
is regarded as part of your country's
territory, is stormed, that persons
who enjoy diplomatic immunity are
taken as hostages, etc.
But you Americans are never told
that the so-called embassy of your
government in Iran does in no sense
resemble one as such.
Although the greatest part of the
documents were removed from the
embassy before and after the over
throw of the last U.S. puppet, and in

spite of the fact that the remaining
documents and papers were burned in
three hours and that the memories of
computers have been destroyed, the
documents and papers that have been
seized leave no doubt that the em
bassy had been the actual center ot
rule over Iran in the days of the ex
shah.
The embassy of your administration
has in fact been the real court in
Tehran.
Now ask your government whether
they would tolerate it if other coun
tries should turn their embassies in
your country into centers of rule, in
terference in general and particular
affairs and espionage in the country
and the region.
Ask your government why, contrary
to their pretenses, they have trampled
down a time-honored tradition by
transforming their embassy into a
center of rule and espionage in our
country and region.
Would you have regarded the staff
of a foreign embassy, interfering in
your internal affairs and administra
tion for 35 years, as ordinary embassy
staff had you staged a revolution and
succeeded?

Would you have acquiesced if they
had stayed on and carried on their
policy and methods as if nothing had
happened?
This is the truth which they hide
from you.
You fought against Hitlerian Ger
many, you tried Nazi leaders at
Nuremberg as war criminals under
the plea of establishing a good tradi
tion in the world. Many of them were
sentenced and put to death.
You did not forego the trial of Rudolf
Hess although he had sought asylum
in England, neither have you released
him from prison after so many years of
imprisonment although he is now a
very old man.
Now, what has happened that your
government is breaking the very tradi
tion established by your own country
and by European countries?
Why should they receive, shelter
and protect, at all cost, a most brutal
criminal? Does not the fact that the
ex-shah has been trying ever since his
departure from Iran to come to
America and the fact that the embassy
of your government in Tehran has
been making preparations to this end
reveal to you that he has been an
American puppet throughout?

Is this right and proper for your
government to force someone on a
country and give him free rein to
commit any sort of crime, treachery,
robbery and corruption and to bring
him subsequently to your country to
protect him?
Would it be expecting too much if
our people urged your government to
extradite, in reference to the tradition
established by the trial of Nazi lead
ers, the most notorious criminal of the
century to Iran in order that he might
be tried publicly and fairly?
They are telling you a lie when they
say that extradition of the ex-shah
would be a disgrace to the American
people. On the contrary, it would be a
great victory for you Americans as well
as for freedom-promoting traditions
and for the spirit of justice of man
kind.
Your government, through a bunch
of traitors, has exposed our economy
to annihilation and now threatens us
wiTh economic boycott and refusal to sell
goods to us. You must know that:
1) The ruin of Iran will be a great loss
to humanity. This very economic
threat must make you aware how your
government, through the ex-shah's

regime has destroyed our economy.
In order to continue to live, Iran has
no option but to succeed in her Is
lamic Revolution.
2) Economic boycott does not
trighten us. The reason being, in fact
to save our ruined economy, we have
no option but to depend on ourse
lves.
History has subjected both of us to
one of the greatest trials. We wish you
to look carefully into the contents of
this message and if you find Iranian
people rightful, ask your government
to sincerely observe human rights and
hand over the ex-shah and his proper
ties and those of his relatives and high
ranking officials of the former regime
