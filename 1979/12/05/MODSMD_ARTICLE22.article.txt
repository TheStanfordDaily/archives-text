## Seek peaceful resolution 
### 
U.S. military intervention in Iran would only
result in negative consequences for everyone —
It would endanger the lives of the embassy
hostages, and not save them.
It would further unify and incite anti-
American sentiment throughout the Third
World.
The Iranians have promised to blow up their
oil fields if the United States should attack their
country. The loss of the Iranian oil supply would
seriously damage the economics of Europe and
japan.
In recent weeks, the U.S. government policy
of systematic discrimination against Iranians vis
iting our country and irresponsible reporting in
the media have created a climate in which Ira
nians living in the United States, regardless of
their political leanings, must fear for their safety.
Continuing harassment and deportation of
Iranian visitors to America will only increase
tensions between our countries.
We urge all those who seek a just and peaceful
resolution to this crisis to support the following
points:
1) We oppose any military or violent

response by the United States to the takeover of
the American Embassy in Tehran. Such an action
would only compound the damage done by 26
years of U.S. support of the shah's regime, and
would surely result in the death of the hostages.
2) It was wrong to allow the shah info the
United States, and he should not be permitted
to remain.
3) We are outraged at the anti-Iranian racism
which is developing in the United States. The
media should stop encouraging it by sen
sationalist reporting which stirs up national
chauvinism.
Iranians in this country should not be made
into scape-goats for the situation in Iran. In par
ticular, the order for discriminatory treatment
and deportation of Iranian students should be
rescinded immediately.
4) Considering the history of U.S. support for
the shah's brutal dictatorship, renewal of good
relations with Iran must be predicated upon a
pledge to refrain from interference in its internal
affairs in the future.
