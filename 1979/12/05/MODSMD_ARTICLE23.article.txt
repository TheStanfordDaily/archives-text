## Dale Gieringer More Khomeinis to come? 
### 
Not since the Cuban missile
crisis has the world order
seemed so in the grips ol man
kind s irrational subcon
sciousness. lor lour weeks
now Iran has played center
stage in the news, leading this
inveterate news junkie into
several exasperating argu
ments, to the point ol haunting
his dreams. Whether the
drama turns into a tarce or a
tragedy, its melodramatic tirst
act has so lar succeeded in br
inging out the worst in nearly
everybody.
The Iranian mob, whipped
into an anti-American tren/v by
the tanatic Khomeini holds 49
Americans hostage in their
embassy and demand the re
turn ol the shah. In so doing,
they violate the Koran's explicit
instructions that diplomats
should be inviolate.
The Iranian government,
badly in need ol a scapegoat
tor its own domestic incompe
tent e, stands by the mob. In so
doing, it violates a principle ot
international law which even
Hitler did not dely.
Many Americans, outraged,
harass Iranian nationals and
demand their deportation. In
so doing, they indulge the
same nationalistic collective
guilt tantasy as the Iranian
mob.
Meanwhile, the shah, in his
hospital bed, is all but ignored
except lor medical bulletins.
The press shows no interest in
investigating the charges ol
Iranians that he looted their
country lor billions, and that
Khomeini's victims are still but
a drop in the bucket to his.
Iran has a point that the shah
should stand trial .is a criminal.

So should Pol Pot, Amin,
Bokassa, Somo/d — not to
mention untoppled tyrants like
Qaddati, Bic/hnev, Marcos
and Videla. But this inquires
legal procedure. The law pro
tects even murderers irom
lynch mobs.
The tact is that Iran never
nled an extradition request,
either with the U.S. or Mexico.
Instead, by breaking interna
tional law, Iran has lorleited
the only means by which it
could obtain justice. Under
these circumstances, the
shah's person is non
negotiable. As the shah owes
damages to Iran, so Iran owes
damages to the hostages. And
what follows trom harm to the
hostages must be automatic:
military retaliation.
This is not a pretty thought.
Violence begets violence, fol
lowing the law ot karma. Il
military action is necessary, let
it come not out ol anger, as
from Tehran, but rather as in
Krishna's instructions to the
warrior Arjuna in the Bhagavad
Cita: "Free Irom thought ot
sell, tore e, pride/Longing and
anger, possessions/Unseltish,
calm." Let the targets, it any,
be military.
And as lor the Ayatollah
Khomeini: he too is at the
mercy ol karma. His days are
numbered by his acts. Let his
martyrdom come at the hands
ol Iranians, not the U.S. state
Department.
The important question is
what we will learn Irom this
crisis. It can be argued that it
was "wrong" to admit the
shah. But even it not, it was
certainly a mistake ot the tirst
magnitude. Who among our

pundits, much less the bevy ot
would-be "leaders" now cam
paigning lor president, was
peceptive enough to note this
at the time?
Instead, we read on the
cover ot Newsweek, the ques
tion, "Has America lost its cl
out?" "Clout" — not even "in
lluence"! The spirit ot letter
son and Washington must be
shuddering. We had our clout,
and he was the shah. Do we
want another? It so, we must
not be surprised that our
karma deals us Khomeinis.

tragedy, its melodramatic tirst
act has so lar succeeded in br
inging out the worst in nearly
everybody.
The Iranian mob, whipped
into an anti-American tren/v by
the tanatic Khomeini holds 49
Americans hostage in their
embassy and demand the re
turn ol the shah. In so doing,
they violate the Koran's explicit
instructions that diplomats
should be inviolate.
The Iranian government,
badly in need ol a scapegoat
tor its own domestic incompe
tent e, stands by the mob. In so
doing, it violates a principle ot
international law which even
Hitler did not dely.
Many Americans, outraged,
harass Iranian nationals and
demand their deportation. In
so doing, they indulge the
same nationalistic collective
guilt tantasy as the Iranian
mob.
Meanwhile, the shah, in his
hospital bed, is all but ignored
except lor medical bulletins.
The press shows no interest in
investigating the charges ol
Iranians that he looted their
country lor billions, and that
Khomeini's victims are still but
a drop in the bucket to his.
Iran has a point that the shah
should stand trial .is a criminal.

So should Pol Pot, Amin,
Bokassa, Somo/d — not to
mention untoppled tyrants like
Qaddati, Bic/hnev, Marcos
and Videla. But this inquires
legal procedure. The law pro
tects even murderers irom
lynch mobs.
The tact is that Iran never
nled an extradition request,
either with the U.S. or Mexico.
Instead, by breaking interna
tional law, Iran has lorleited
the only means by which it
could obtain justice. Under
these circumstances, the
shah's person is non
negotiable. As the shah owes
damages to Iran, so Iran owes
damages to the hostages. And
what follows trom harm to the
hostages must be automatic:
military retaliation.
This is not a pretty thought.
Violence begets violence, fol
lowing the law ot karma. Il
military action is necessary, let
it come not out ol anger, as
from Tehran, but rather as in
Krishna's instructions to the
warrior Arjuna in the Bhagavad
Cita: "Free Irom thought ot
sell, tore e, pride/Longing and
anger, possessions/Unseltish,
calm." Let the targets, it any,
be military.
And as lor the Ayatollah
Khomeini: he too is at the
mercy ol karma. His days are
numbered by his acts. Let his
martyrdom come at the hands
ol Iranians, not the U.S. state
Department.
The important question is
what we will learn Irom this
crisis. It can be argued that it
was "wrong" to admit the
shah. But even it not, it was
certainly a mistake ot the tirst
magnitude. Who among our

pundits, much less the bevy ot
would-be "leaders" now cam
paigning lor president, was
peceptive enough to note this
at the time?
Instead, we read on the
cover ot Newsweek, the ques
tion, "Has America lost its cl
out?" "Clout" — not even "in
lluence"! The spirit ot letter
son and Washington must be
shuddering. We had our clout,
and he was the shah. Do we
want another? It so, we must
not be surprised that our
karma deals us Khomeinis.
