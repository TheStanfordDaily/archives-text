## Americans have nothing to feel sorry about 
### 
Despite the tact that I am
swamped by end-ot-quarter
overload, alumnus Stephen
Requa'seditorial on the Iranian
situation (Daily, Nov. 2(>l de
serves a reply. I am not so sure
we, as Americans, owe the Ira
nian people an apology. Read
on and I think you will agree.
Iranian government in the
twentieth century has gone
through several c hanges. Alter
years, eons is the
proper term, ol rule by king,
the Iranians instituted the
principles ot constitutional
monarchy in 1905. From 1925,
the present shah's lather, the
Riza Shah, ruled as king until
194 I. It was under the rule ol
the Riza Shah that most long
term U.S. oil contracts with
Iran were negotiated.
The Ri/a Shah died in 1941,
and betore his son, the current

Mohammed Kiza Shah, could
consolidate Ins power, a new
government was instituted.
This government, under its
elected leader Mohammed
Mossadegh, wanted to nullity
its long-term oil contracts with
the U.S. oil companies and
nationalize all ot the U.S. pro
duction hardware in Iran. The
U.S. government diet not like
this move, and through a
C.1.A.-backed coup reinstated
the current shah.
So lar so good. I am not
ashamed of any ol this as an
American. When a long-term
contract, negotiated in good
taith by independent parties, is
abrogated, a major wrong has
been committed. In this coun
try, it a steel company says it
will supply a ( at maker with
sheet metal lor x number ol
years at a given price, it is ex

pected to comply with these
terms under penalty ol legal re
tribution lor non-compliance.
Of course, U.S. oil com
panies could not drag Iran into
court to make their leaders
honor their contracts. I he U.S.
government, in an ellort to
protect the interests ol U.S.
companies, had lew choices.
They could allow Iran to steal
billions ot dollars in equipment
and research ellort from our
companies, or they could
make the Iranian government
uphold their end ol the bar
gain. The U.S. chose the latter
route, and this took the form ot
reinstating the shah, who was
sympathetic to the United
States.
Still, I aifl not ashamed ot
anything the U.S. has done.
U.S. companies must abide by
their contractual agreements

with foreign governments, and
i see no reason why the reverse
should not be true as well. Yes,
the United States has a stable
government which facilitates
the oiderly operation of con
tracts, and foreigners have
contidence in international
contracts with U.S. companies
and the U.S. government;
however, the tact that toreign
nations have internal conflicts
should not jeopardize our at
tempts to do business in
toreign lands.
It newly-instituted toreign
governments want to re
negotiate a contract with the
U.S. government or a private
lirm when the contract expires,
that is their privilege. In addi
tion, it foreign governments
want to reluse to sell to the
U.S., or simply tell us to go to
hell in general, that again is
their right — but not until the
contract expires.
The American people cannot
appeal to an international au
thority to torce compliance in
international contracts. We
can only use our political,
economic or military might to
torce compliance.
I inally, I am not ashamed ot
what the shah has done in Iran
alter the C.I .A. helped him into
ot I ice. I deplore killing inno
cent people, but that was the
shah's internal doings and
does not affect us.
It the Iranian government
under Mossadegh had hon
ored its obligations as a suc
cessor to a previous govern

ment, the shah would never
have been returned to power.
The U.S. would not have en
tered Iranian internal affairs at
all had it not been given an in
just deal in the lirst place.
Furthermore, whatever the
shah may or may not have
done, as has been said by many
others, Khomeini does not
seem squeamish about shed
ding blood, either.
No, I am not ashamed about
the actions ot my government.
I am not ashamed ot my coun
try. And I retuse to tell an Ira
nian I'm sorry.

Iranian government in the
twentieth century has gone
through several c hanges. Alter
years, eons is the
proper term, ol rule by king,
the Iranians instituted the
principles ot constitutional
monarchy in 1905. From 1925,
the present shah's lather, the
Riza Shah, ruled as king until
194 I. It was under the rule ol
the Riza Shah that most long
term U.S. oil contracts with
Iran were negotiated.
The Ri/a Shah died in 1941,
and betore his son, the current

Mohammed Kiza Shah, could
consolidate Ins power, a new
government was instituted.
This government, under its
elected leader Mohammed
Mossadegh, wanted to nullity
its long-term oil contracts with
the U.S. oil companies and
nationalize all ot the U.S. pro
duction hardware in Iran. The
U.S. government diet not like
this move, and through a
C.1.A.-backed coup reinstated
the current shah.
So lar so good. I am not
ashamed of any ol this as an
American. When a long-term
contract, negotiated in good
taith by independent parties, is
abrogated, a major wrong has
been committed. In this coun
try, it a steel company says it
will supply a ( at maker with
sheet metal lor x number ol
years at a given price, it is ex

pected to comply with these
terms under penalty ol legal re
tribution lor non-compliance.
Of course, U.S. oil com
panies could not drag Iran into
court to make their leaders
honor their contracts. I he U.S.
government, in an ellort to
protect the interests ol U.S.
companies, had lew choices.
They could allow Iran to steal
billions ot dollars in equipment
and research ellort from our
companies, or they could
make the Iranian government
uphold their end ol the bar
gain. The U.S. chose the latter
route, and this took the form ot
reinstating the shah, who was
sympathetic to the United
States.
Still, I aifl not ashamed ot
anything the U.S. has done.
U.S. companies must abide by
their contractual agreements

with foreign governments, and
i see no reason why the reverse
should not be true as well. Yes,
the United States has a stable
government which facilitates
the oiderly operation of con
tracts, and foreigners have
contidence in international
contracts with U.S. companies
and the U.S. government;
however, the tact that toreign
nations have internal conflicts
should not jeopardize our at
tempts to do business in
toreign lands.
It newly-instituted toreign
governments want to re
negotiate a contract with the
U.S. government or a private
lirm when the contract expires,
that is their privilege. In addi
tion, it foreign governments
want to reluse to sell to the
U.S., or simply tell us to go to
hell in general, that again is
their right — but not until the
contract expires.
The American people cannot
appeal to an international au
thority to torce compliance in
international contracts. We
can only use our political,
economic or military might to
torce compliance.
