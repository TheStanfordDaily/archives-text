## Justice without violence 
### 
Despite the revolution in
Iran, most Americans have
made little effort to understand
the causes of Iranian anger
against Shah Mohammed Re/a
Pahlavi. This failure to under
stand is the primary cause ol
the current crisis.
Although rumors about
monetary corruption and
about the brutality ot the
Shah's secret police, Savak,
began to spread after the
Shah's exile in March 1979,
most Americans turned their
attention away too soon to
focus on theories regarding
the religious leadership ot the
Ayatollah Khomeini.
Most Americans, therefore,
fail eel to realize that the crucial
issue for the people ot Iran, the
issue that led to the revolution
and that, with religion, was the
foundation tor Khomeini's re
lationship with the Iranian
people, was anger at the shah
and a desire lor justice. Until
this issue was resolved, the
Iranian people could not be at
ease with the United States.
The Iranian siege ot the U.S.
embassy was a gross breach of
international law that could
even be interpreted as a decla
ration of war, but Americans
should realize that the Iranian
people view it as a last desper
ate effort to seek justice against
the shah, whom they consider
the greatest criminal in their
history. Their drastic action
was triggered by the U.S. gov
ernment's granting of entry to
the shah. Iranians have a deep
mistrust ot the country that
first put the shah in power and,
when he was suddenly allowed
into the U.S., they greatly

tea red a plot to reinstate the
shah. The embassy siege was
an act oi defense.
One serious impediment to
Americans' ability to under
stand this is their anger at the
Iranian people. Many Ameri
cans have made the mistake ot
personalizing a political situa
tion. Crowds cheered Miss Lil
lian's claim that she would like
to have someone kill Kho
meini. Sen. Robert Byrd's
statement in Time magazine
that he telt like "taking a punch
at one (an Iranian) myself" is an
example ol a widely-held sen
timent that impedes under
standing.
Most Iranians, however, are
able to distinguish between
the government ot a nation and
the people ol a nation. Most
Iranians are angry at the U.S.
government and leel that its
policies have made it their
enemy. Vet they teel no hostil

ity toward the American
people.
It Americans could momen
tarily torget their anger, they
could easily understand Ira
nian motives. Iranians are dri
ven by a great religious fervor,
a sti iig desire tor indepen
dence and above all, justice.
This entails the return ot a tor
tune they believe was stolen by
the shah, as well as a trial.
Americans should not ignore
these teelings. They are the key
to the solution ot the present
crisis. Although the Iranians
have broken international law,
they do not mean any harm to
the American people and do
not want to hurt the hostages.
They only want what they con
sider justice. They, at least,
have a right to a tair hearing ot
their grievances against the
shah.
