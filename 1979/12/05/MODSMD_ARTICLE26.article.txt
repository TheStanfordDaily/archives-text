## United we stand 
### 
Many Americans are looking
for a way to express concern
tor their fellow citizens being
held hostage in Iran that is con
sistent with this country's re
spect tor law. As you know, the
American Charge in Iran,
Bruce Laingen, who is being
held at the Foreign Ministry,
has suggested that church bells
be rung each noon until the
hostages are released. Several
members of Congress and the
Attorney General also have
suggested that Americans
write the Iranian Mission at the
United Nations to demand re

lease of the hostages.
The president endorses
these suggestions.
It is of overriding importance
that Iranian authorities under
stand that Americans are un
ited in their determination not
to yield to blackmail and in the
demand tor the sate return ot
the hostages. Your support tor
these two suggestions will help
prevent any miscalculation ot
where Americans stand in this
time ot crisis.
