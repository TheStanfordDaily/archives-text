## Iranian leaders 'grossly misrepresent' Islam 
### 
As a non-Iranian Muslim I
would like to present my opin
ion on the crisis in Iran.
Islam in Arabic means peace,
purity, obedience and submis
sion. In the present day crisis,
Islam is grossly misrep
resented by leaders in Iran.
The religion is also frequently
stereotyped by others as un
mitigatedly harsh in its code oi
law, intolerant ot other relig
ions, repressive toward
women and incompatible with
progress.
Islam did not prosper over
800 million adherents by use ot
oil embargos, or holding hos
tages or keeping political pris
oners.

A major portion ol the Mus
lim population is not in Arab
countries and some ol the
largest Muslim populations are
living peacefully in countries
where Islam is not the state re
ligion. This is the case lor 12 5
million Muslims in Indonesia,
HO million in India, 50 million in
the Soviet Union and 18 million
in China.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini's threat ot putting hos
tages on trial by Islamic law will
be a horrible insult to the in
stitution ot Islam Islam judges,
protects, and wages resistance
where there is injustice.
The Koran starts with this
quality ol compassion and

justice seasoned with mercy.
In Islam there is no dichotomy
between declaration and
deed; between belief and
righteous action.
Quoting the Koran, "believe
and act rightly" sums up this
sentiment. Islam is- wrongly
understood in the West as a
new religion. II was in essence
the same religion ot Islam
which Cjocl revealed to all his
prophets. Quoting Koran,
"Say: We believe in Cod and
that which is revealed to us,
and, that which was revealed to
Abraham and Ishmael and
Isaac, Jacob and the tribes and
that which was given to Moses
and )essu and to the prophets

Irom their lord; we make no
distinction between any ol
them and to them we submit."
The message ot Islam was re
vealed to prophet Muhammad
in its comprehensive and tinal
lorm.
And the Koran cannot be
cribbed into fanatical crucibles
ol unreasoning doctrine and
dogma, nor is it meant lor
monopolization by sectarian
orthodoxy. A message that
reaches out to the whole family
ol man avowing peace and
human brotherhood without
distinction ol race, color, class
or any manner ol hierarchical
superiority, cannot but be for
all.
His boundless goodness and
our oneness in Him indicate
that we belong to what the
prophet Muhammad termed
"the family ol God." How re
vealing is this utterance of the
prophet: "O Lord, Lord ot my
life and everything in the uni
verse: I atlirm that all human
beings are brother unto one
another."
The Koran holds out the
heal-hand for bruised personal
relationships between indi
viduals. In racial and religious
contlict between communities
it points to rapprochement; in
the larger international sphere
its message embraces a planet
ary perspective ol peace. The
Muslims' normal greeting is
"peace be upon you." Yet the
Ayatollah has asked Muslims in
Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union,

and in other countries to revolt
against their governments. He
tried to create a mass confu
sion in Muslim countries by
giving a talse report that the
Grand Mosque in Mecca was
captured by the United States,
which is highly unbecoming of
any leader.
He wants to plunge all coun
tries in war lor his own benefit.
Surely justice should be sought
by the people ot Iran lor the
shah's crimes, but not at the
cost ol international chaos, or
at the expense of innocent
people held as hostages, not at
the expense ol a bloody war
which might kill more people
in a lew days than the shah al
legedly killed in many years.
There is no doubt this is a
bad time lor war. Indus
trialized countries are facing
high unemployment, energy
crises, and less developed
countries are conlronting star
vation. Let the fanaticism of
Khomeini remain with Kho
meini. II should not be allowed
to creep into other countries.
All the countries ol the world
should send special envoys to
Iran. All the Arab and Muslim
countries should do every
thing to maintain international
peace. As the Koran says:
"Seek not the path of those
who earn thine anger nor of
those who go astray."

countries should do every
thing to maintain international
peace. As the Koran says:
"Seek not the path of those
who earn thine anger nor of
those who go astray."

As a non-Iranian Muslim I
would like to present my opin
ion on the crisis in Iran.
Islam in Arabic means peace,
purity, obedience and submis
sion. In the present day crisis,
Islam is grossly misrep
resented by leaders in Iran.
The religion is also frequently
stereotyped by others as un
mitigatedly harsh in its code oi
law, intolerant ot other relig
ions, repressive toward
women and incompatible with
progress.
Islam did not prosper over
800 million adherents by use ot
oil embargos, or holding hos
tages or keeping political pris
oners.

A major portion ol the Mus
lim population is not in Arab
countries and some ol the
largest Muslim populations are
living peacefully in countries
where Islam is not the state re
ligion. This is the case lor 12 5
million Muslims in Indonesia,
HO million in India, 50 million in
the Soviet Union and 18 million
in China.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini's threat ot putting hos
tages on trial by Islamic law will
be a horrible insult to the in
stitution ot Islam Islam judges,
protects, and wages resistance
where there is injustice.
The Koran starts with this
quality ol compassion and

justice seasoned with mercy.
In Islam there is no dichotomy
between declaration and
deed; between belief and
righteous action.
Quoting the Koran, "believe
and act rightly" sums up this
sentiment. Islam is- wrongly
understood in the West as a
new religion. II was in essence
the same religion ot Islam
which Cjocl revealed to all his
prophets. Quoting Koran,
"Say: We believe in Cod and
that which is revealed to us,
and, that which was revealed to
Abraham and Ishmael and
Isaac, Jacob and the tribes and
that which was given to Moses
and )essu and to the prophets

Irom their lord; we make no
distinction between any ol
them and to them we submit."
The message ot Islam was re
vealed to prophet Muhammad
in its comprehensive and tinal
lorm.
And the Koran cannot be
cribbed into fanatical crucibles
ol unreasoning doctrine and
dogma, nor is it meant lor
monopolization by sectarian
orthodoxy. A message that
reaches out to the whole family
ol man avowing peace and
human brotherhood without
distinction ol race, color, class
or any manner ol hierarchical
superiority, cannot but be for
all.
His boundless goodness and
our oneness in Him indicate
that we belong to what the
prophet Muhammad termed
"the family ol God." How re
vealing is this utterance of the
prophet: "O Lord, Lord ot my
life and everything in the uni
verse: I atlirm that all human
beings are brother unto one
another."
The Koran holds out the
heal-hand for bruised personal
relationships between indi
viduals. In racial and religious
contlict between communities
it points to rapprochement; in
the larger international sphere
its message embraces a planet
ary perspective ol peace. The
Muslims' normal greeting is
"peace be upon you." Yet the
Ayatollah has asked Muslims in
Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union,

and in other countries to revolt
against their governments. He
tried to create a mass confu
sion in Muslim countries by
giving a talse report that the
Grand Mosque in Mecca was
captured by the United States,
which is highly unbecoming of
any leader.
He wants to plunge all coun
tries in war lor his own benefit.
Surely justice should be sought
by the people ot Iran lor the
shah's crimes, but not at the
cost ol international chaos, or
at the expense of innocent
people held as hostages, not at
the expense ol a bloody war
which might kill more people
in a lew days than the shah al
legedly killed in many years.
There is no doubt this is a
bad time lor war. Indus
trialized countries are facing
high unemployment, energy
crises, and less developed
countries are conlronting star
vation. Let the fanaticism of
Khomeini remain with Kho
meini. II should not be allowed
to creep into other countries.
All the countries ol the world
should send special envoys to
Iran. All the Arab and Muslim
countries should do every
thing to maintain international
peace. As the Koran says:
"Seek not the path of those
who earn thine anger nor of
those who go astray."
