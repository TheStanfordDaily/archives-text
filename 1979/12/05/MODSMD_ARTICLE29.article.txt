## Khomeini surpasses Nazis 
### 
The fundamental issue in
Iran is diplomatic immunity,
not the shah or American pol
icy toward that country.
By tolerating (perhaps or
ganizing) the seizure ot the
American Embassy in Tehran
by so-called students, the
Khomeini regime is setting
back established practice in in
ternational relations by several
centuries. There was a time
when emissaries of kings or
other rulers were seized or
kidnapped. Over time, how
ever, nations learned that it
they were to conduct relations
among themselves, they could
not interlere with one

another's representatives.
This principle of diplomatic
immunity is so deeply
grounded that all books on in
ternational law list it as an
example ot international law.
In more recent times, the obli
gations of governments to pro
tect diplomatic missions were
specified in an international
convention, to which Iran is a
signatory.
Khomeini must ultimately be
held responsible lor the pre
sent barbaric violation ot in
ternational law, tor which
there is no real modern paral
lel.
Even in the midst of World

War 11, Na/i Germany, as well
as all other nations at war, did
not violate the principle ot dip
lomatic immunity. Diplomatic
relations were broken, but dip
lomats were not molested. On
the contrary, they were given
sate conduct home.
No nation can accept what
has happened in Iran, for to do
so would mean giving any
group of selt-willed terrorists
the right toseizediplomatsand
to use them tor whatever pur
poses or ends that they so de
sired.
