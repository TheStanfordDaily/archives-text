# Foreign minister vows to put hostages on trial

Tehran, Iran (AP) — The month-old
U.S. Embassy crisis took a sudden
grim turn yesterday as Iran's foreign
minister declared the American hos
tages would be put on trial and their
Moslem militant captors were re
ported to have threatened to shoot
them if they did not "cooperate."
At an emergency U.N. Security
Council session in New York, the 15
members unanimously passed a re
solution urging Iran to release the 50
hostages immediately and appealing
to both Iran and the United States "to
exercise the utmost restraint" in the
critical situation.
Pentagon officials said, mean
while, that a six-ship Navy force led
by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk has
reached the Arabian Sea area, joining
another U.S. carrier force. This put
the ships, carrying more than 135
planes, within reach of the entrance
of the Persian Gulf.
President |immy Carter has
warned Iran of "extremely grave"
consequences if the hostages are
harmed, and U.S. officials say a trial
of the diplomats would be an even
more grievous violation of interna
tional law than the hostage seizure
itself.
Hie report of threats to shoot hos
tages came from a White House offi
tial in Washington.
The statement marked the first
time a U.S. official has said the hos
tages have been threatened with
execution, although Carter said last
week that the Americans had been
threatened at pistol point.
The official, who asked not to be
identified, said the hostages "have
been threatened with execution if
they fail to cooperate with their cap
tors." He said it could be assumed "I
don't mean cooperation just ... in
routine matters."
The warning of an upcoming trial

of the hostages as "spies" came trom
Iran's acting foreign minister,
Sadegh Ghotbzadeh.
Iranian television said he told a
French interviewer that the American
captives would be tried "for sure."
Whether the hostages will be
punished according to the verdict —
they could be sentenced to death —
would depend on Iran's leader,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who
could overrule the sentence "if the
United States extradites the shah,"
Ghotbzadeh reportedly said.
The Iranian account of the inter
view with the French newspaper Le
Figaro differed slightly from the ver
sion published by Le Figaro. In that,
Ghotbzadeh says such halfway mea
sures as an international investiga
tion of ousted Shah Mohammad
Reza Rahlavi's regime would not set
tle the crisis.
"Thus the hostages will be tried?"
he was asked.
"Yes."
It was evident from the minister's
remarks as reported by Iranian tele
vision, which closely follows the offi
cial line, that Ghotbzadeh meant the
hostages would be tried in any event.
Previously, Iran threatened to try
the hostages on espionage charges
only if Carter stuck to his refusal to
send back the shah.
It appeared from Ghotbzadeh's
remarks that the ruling Revolutio
nary Council was stepping up pres
sure by offering a Khomeini "par
don" instead of no trial as the price of
the hostages' eventual freedom.
Before Ghotbzadeh's statement,
there were indications that the Car
ter administration was settling in for
an indefinite standoff in its efforts to
free the hostages.
Le Figaro also quoted Ghotbzadeh
as saying the hostages would be tried

by the militant students holding the
embassy. This was not reported by
the television here, and a student
spokesman at the embassy im
mediately denied it, saying only an
"Islamic revolutionary court" would
have jurisdiction.
Relatives of the captives were
being summoned to Washington at

government expense for a briefing
Friday from Secretary of State Cyrus
R. Vance.
"It's a status report," a U.S. official
said of the briefing, to which one
member from each ot the hostages'
families has been invited. "It's not a
question of presenting good news or
bad news."
