## Secular cruelty unmatched 
### 
I was surprised to see Susan Nowlis' letter in
response to my column (Daily, Nov. 26) on the
Cambodia situation. She accuses me of condon
ing killing and maiming in certain situations,
especially when the mayhem is committed by
my "team," the Church. This is a fairly serious
charge.
Perhaps I was unclear, but I had hoped to
show that the taking of life — life I believe to be
sacred — is never to be condoned. I am a Christ
ian pacifist, and these accusations really stung
me.
The point of my column was that when people
no longer regard each other as sacred parts of
Cod's creation, they find it easier to kill one
another. This devaluation of man has been oc
curring for hundreds of years, but I strongly
asserted that it has reached its zenith in the
secular 20th century.
I agree that the Inquisition and the Crusades
were as revolting and evil as any single mass
horror of this century; I am ashamed that institu
tions bearing the name "Christian" carried on
these programs. But I would also argue that the
20th century, measured by its unmatched and
widespread cruelty and devaluation of human
life, leaves both of these sad periods in history
looking pale by comparison.
And this is significant, for it reveals a modern
value structure moving farther and farther away
from God, and hence farther away from the pos
sibility of dogmatically stating that human life

has ultimate value.
Working in the void left by the "dead" Cod,
humanists during this century have tried to con
vince people that human beings are ultimately
valuable.
They have, by their own admission, largely
tailed. If we believe that people have ultimate
value because Almighty Cod feels this way,
there is little room for discussion. Without God,
the subject of people's value becomes a matter
of opinion. As with most topics, people's opin
ions vary greatly.
I am not so naive as to believe that all killing
and manipulation would end if everyone be
lieved in Cod and valued people as sacred.
People have an overwhelming desire to manipu
late each other and to treat one another like
"things," and this desire has given rise to great
inhumanities in all periods of history. Faith in
Cod and in His desire for people to treat each
other as if they were relating to the very image of
God is difficult to sustain in this bewildering
world.
But difficult or not, I will continue to believe
that faith in God is the only hope for people in
any century. If I thought that this faith condoned
the murder of people for social or religious
goals I would not be a believer. But I don't think
this is the case, and for this reason and many
others I am, and will remain, a Christian.
