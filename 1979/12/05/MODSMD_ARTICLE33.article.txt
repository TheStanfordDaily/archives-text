Whose space?
We are told in an article in
the Daily (Nov. 20) that from
now on student organizations
are going to have to justify their
need for space.
The reason that student or
ganizations will not be allowed
to take space and proliferate is
because there is a shortage of
housing and space for student
activities. But, it seems that the
same rule does not apply to
administrative organizations.
Once administrative or
ganizers are granted space it is
permissible for them to prolif
erate indefinitely as the
bureaucracy inevitably in
creases.
It seems only fair that since
the university is for the stu
dents and that the student or
ganizations must justify their
space that administrative or
ganizations should justify their
space.
If there is a shortage of space
everyone should have to con
serve. If after the "annual re
view" it is found that an or
ganization (administrative or
student) could function as effi
ciently on less space (just walk
into any administrative office
and look around!) then its
space would be cut down and
allocated to a more needy or
ganization.
I'm sure that if there was a
complete overhaul of the ad
ministrative offices that there
would be plenty of space for
everyone. But, if this is not
enough space then a priority
system should be designed to
see which organization(s) must
function on less space than it
needs. This system should re
flect the fact that schools are to
educate and not to benefit ad
ministrators.
If a priority system is not set
up, then the lease that should
be done is that as long as stu
dents are required to justify
their space, administrators
should be required to justify
their space. Otherwise, if ad
ministrative space is allowed to
expand without justification
while student space is re
stricted, we may end up with a
university campus full of ad
ministrative offices and with all
student organizations (and
students?) off-campus.

Recognize PLO
I found the view expressed in
Laurie Gould's article "Israel,
not the PLO, needs support"
(Daily, Nov. 30), somewhat one
sided, and would like to clarify
a couple of points. After mak
ing a few inaccurate statements
concerning the Palestinian
Liberation Organization and its
policy, she concludes that
now, more than ever, Ameri
cans should support Israel.
At the onset of the article,
Gould recognized the PLO's at
tempt in recent months to gain
credibility and to use negotia
tion as a means to achieve its
goals. Yet, she then states that
the PLO's aim is to destroy Is
rael. That simply is not true
anymore. In the last year
numerous PLO spokesmen
have stated that the PLO would
be more than willing to discuss
the possibilities of a Palestinian
state on the West Bank and
Gaza strip. A Palestinian home
land does not mean the de
struction of Israel.
She also states, "If negotia
tions fail, the PLO simply will
return to acts of violence and
terrorism." Maybe, maybe
not; at any rate, I do not think
that that is sound reasoning for
not negotiating in the first
place. After many years of justi
fiably being denounced as a
group of dirty terrorists, the
PLO is making a serious at
tempt to deal with the Middle
East problem in a responsible
manner. To snuff this attempt
towards peace would be a mis
take.
Gould states that, rather
than bargain with the PLO, we
should negotiate with other
Palestinians. Yet, since 1974
the United Nations has recog
nized the PLO as "the rep
resentative of the Palestinian
people." Time after time,
Palestinians on the West Bank
have supported and elected
PLO sympathizers as their
mayors. The fact that the PLO is
the sole legitimate representa
tive of the Palestinian people
cannot be debated.
There are two important
points to be made. The first,
Gould said, "This organization
(PLO) has come to the realiza
tion that they can better reach
their ends through negotiation

than terrorism." The second
point is that there will never be
peace in the Middle East until
the PLO is brought into negoti
ations concerning the West
Bank, Gaza and a Palestinian
homeland.
One could never condone
the senseless killing for which
the PLO has been responsible.
Yet to deny the PLO at this time
its right to participate in Middle
East negotiations, would be to
advocate the continuation of
warfare which affects both in
nocent Israelis and Palesti
nians.
The PLO cannot be wished
away by increasing support for
the Israeli government. This is
recognized by many Israelis
("Israel intellectuals are think
ing the unthinkable," San
Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 20)
and by more and more Ameri
cans.

Corner happy
When I heard the History
corner was open after being
closed for renovation for
longer than I've been at Stan
ford, I was afraid we had
another Math corner on our
hands. I get furious when I
think about that earlier attempt
at renovation which resulted in
the worst building at Stanford,
worse, I think, than Stern —
the usual nominee for that
award.
They "stuffed" the Math
corner, putting about seven
stones where there used to be
four, which makes it impossi
ble to look out most of the
windows if you happen to be
taller than two feet or shorter
than seven.
There is something about
the classrooms there that
makes them the grungiest on
campus: last year I never went
to my Math classes because I

was afraid of what diseases
those rooms might be the
breeding grounds for.
So I went to the History
corner expecting the worst; I
came away very pleasantly sur
prised. They did a beautiful
job. The central staircase is an
elegant renovation of the type
of stairway in the Geology
corner. The hallways are
woodpaneled and have the
character that was lost from the
Math corner. There are still
only four stories which means
high ceilings and windows
people can look out of.
The lighting is from energy
saving fluorescents, none of
those incandescent spot-lights
like in Terman which cause a
series of temporary blindnes
ses when you walk down the
hall wearing glass. The whole
building seems well thought
out and beautifully executed.
Now if in the next two and a
half years something can be
done about the Quad — that
festering wound at the middle
of the University — I'll
graduate happy.
