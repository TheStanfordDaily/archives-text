## Only through understanding THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS 
### 
I would like to commend
Tarif Abboushi (Daily, Nov. 16)
for his honest approach to re
solving the Middle East con
flict. He is absolutely correct in
the need to "start preaching
coexistence rather than blind
hatred." He is also correct in
pointing to the Palestinian
question as being at the heart
of the problem, and the need
for the "Israelis and Palesti
nians to come to terms with
each other."
In spite of the shortcomings
of the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty, I feel that one of the
major benefits of the treaty will
be a new positive, personal
and understanding relation
ship between Israelis and Egyp
tians. If such supportive
coexistence can be shown to
be possible between these two
groups, future encounters be
tween Israelis and other Arab
peoples will be made easier.
I would like to add one addi
tional point that is crucial to the

future prospects for peace.
The American Jewish commun
ity must also approach the
issue of Palestinian rights in an
honest and open manner.
While a significant minority of
American Jews are facing the
realities and are going through
a difficult and painful reapprai
sal of Israeli policy and official
attitudes toward the Palesti
nian people, too many are not
willing to challenge those
policies of the Israeli govern
ment which offend their sense
of justice and humanitarian
ideals.
The time-worn excuse that a
"strong Israel" requires a
monolithic supportive stance
on the part of the Jewish com
munity in America must be
seen as doing more harm than
good. While most Jews fight
vigorously for their right to par
ticipate in the decision and pol
icy making processes of their
own communities, they waive
their rights to do so in the one

community that should be
most important to them: the
State of Israel. As a result, we
are in danger ol losing not only
our own personal integrity, but
the integrity of the community
as a whole.
I support the efforts of con
cerned Jews and non-Jews in
bringing the issue to the foref
ront of public dialogue. Here at
Stanford there are increased
efforts to deal with the ques
tions posed by the problems of
the Middle East.
The lecture series sponsored
by Toyon Hall, and other guest
speakers should be attended
by those interested in hearing
new perspectives. In both
winter and spring quarters
there will be classes offered by
the political science depart
ment on Israel's foreign policy.
A SWOPSI class focused on the
Palestinian perspective will be
given winter quarter.
As Abboushi concludes, Al
bert Einstein observed that
"Peace can never be achieved
by force. Only through under
standing." Understanding will
only come through education.
Please take advantage of these
opportunities to get a more
complete understanding of the
complexities involved in the
Middle East conflict.
