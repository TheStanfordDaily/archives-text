## Gov't should let Chrysler die 
### 
Public opinion has recently
been stirred over whether the
Federal government should or
should not grant the Chrysler
corporation a monetary sub
sidy to help keep afloat the
floundering corporation. As
consumers and as tax-paying
citizens, we should say "no" to
Chrysler and instead, take
steps to insure a prosperous
economic future for this coun
try.
Chrysler recently an
nounced that it had suffered
third quarter losses of $461
million which bring this year's
total losses to $721 million. The
other two largest automobile
producers — General Motors
and Ford Motor Co. — also re
ported third quarter losses but
were not nearly as severe as

Chrysler's.
So what has been the reason
for Chrysler's losses? Unrealis
tic governmental rules and
regulations regarding our
gasoline supply, exhaust
emission controls and safety
standards have been partially
responsible, but they have af
fected all of the corporations,
not just Chrysler. The govern
ment, through its legislative ac
tions, has helped to kill
Chrysler, but it should not help
to save Chrysler.
The real reasons for
Chrysler's losses are directly
related to some internal prob
lems which the corporation is
suffering from. Most notable
among these problems were:
1) Chrysler's refusal to cut back
its European operations when

it became apparent they were
losing money, and 2) a delay on
Chrysler's part in the produc
tion of compact, fuel-efficient
cars at a time when soaring
gasoline prices made motorists
more energy conscious.
Our society is based on a
free enterprise system. It's
often described as a profit sys
tem, but that label is rather mis
leading. In reality, capitalism is
a profit and loss system; and
the losses are more important
than the profits because losses
eliminate badly managed,
poorly-operated companies
from the market.
Because Chrysler is losing
money does not mean that this
is a failure of capitalism; it
means that the losses are a re
sult of a failure of management
at Chrysler.
Regarding the issue of gov
ernmental aid to Chrysler, the
real question at issue is:
"Should we allow the govern
ment to take money from our
pockets, not to buy cars we
want to buy, but to pay for the
managerial blunders which
Chrysler has made?" General
Electric Chairman Reginald
Jones once said: "One of the
aspects of the free enterprise
system is that you should be
allowed to succeed, and you
should also be allowed to fail."
What will be the effect on the
economy if Chrysler is allowed
to go bankrupt? Data Re
sources research firm claims
that unemployment, which
now runs about 6 percent,
might rise by 0.5 percent by
eliminating the jobs of 117,000
American workers and 35,000
employees in foreign facilities.
So the question at hand is:
What are the best policies to
undertake in order to deal with
this dilemma? The answer is,
quite simply, to allow the free
market to deal with this prob
lem.
First, to insure that a future
market will exist for auto
makers, we must insure that
there will be sufficient fuel av
ailable to power the autos. De
control of fuel prices and re
search and development of al
ternative energy sources, will
insure our country of adequate
supplies of energy, while not
allowing ourselves to become

economically dependent on
foreign countries for our
energy needs.
Secondly, to insure that fu
ture automobiles will perform
more efficiently, provide grea
ter passenger safety and be
made available to a wider range
of people, we should deregu
late the auto industry. By so do
ing, we would promote greater
competition among auto pro
ducers, not greater irresponsi
bility as some people might
think.
Also, by allowing the auto
industry to expand, more
people would be employed
and the unemployed people
from Chrysler would have no
problem whatsoever in finding
jobs.
And finally, to insure that the
auto industry would remain
highly competitive, we should
remove import tariffs imposed
against autos produced in
foreign countries. In so doing,
we are not going to destroy the
U.S. auto industry, we will just
put the U.S. market in compet
ition with the world market.
At the present time, many
foreign car producers make no
attempt to export cars to the
U.S. because the cost of meet
ing all the particular gov
ernmental regulations, stan
dards and tariffs, make it un
economical to do so.
Government has been par
tially responsible for the losses
suffered at Chrysler, but the
main culprit has been poor
management. Even if Chrysler
does receive the $750 million in
aid it has requested, Alan
Greenspan, President Ford's
chief economic adviser pre
dicted: "I forecast that the aid
package will be insufficient to
solve the problems of
Chrysler. I further forecast that
the company will be back for
more."
This country did not become
great in its 200 years of exis
tence under the guidance of
governmental rules and regu
lations. In order to insure a
prosperous economic future,
we must eliminate unneces
sary rules and regulations
which are now extinguishing
the guiding light of the free en
terprise system.
