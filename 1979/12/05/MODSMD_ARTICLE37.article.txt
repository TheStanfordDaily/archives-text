## The 						red badge of Stanford 
### 
Since the choice of a mascot
for Stanford seems to be a
major issue here, I think it is
time to point out something
which has been overlooked. It
has to do with correlating two
seemingly unrelated
phenomena.
First: In almost every issue of
this paper, one can find refer
ences to a certain well-known
liberal arts school on the
Charles River. Sometimes
these references are humble,
sometimes they are matter-of
fact comparisons, most often
they are sarcastic.
One might get the idea that
Stanford undergraduates (and
faculty) are insecure with re
spect to this other school, and
need reassurance that they are
equally worthy as scholars.
Second: Since the Indian
was deposed as the official

mascot, the administration has
been insisting that the "Cardi
nal" be substituted (not the
bird, the color for Pete's sake).
This was actually a clever
move, except that people seem
to be too thick not to confuse
the color with the bird. Inno
cent that I was last year, I
thought it justified all the red
feathers that alumni give away
at football games.
This very paper ran a head
line to the effect that the Car
dinals would remain our mas
cot after the last election. The
plural more easily suggests a
flock of birds than different
shades of red.
Now for the point: (North
easterners, please disqualify
yourselves) What is the mascot
of Harvard University? if you
said bulldogs or tigers, close
but no cigar. If you couldn't

think of one, you were correct.
When Harvard men com
pete, they fight for the "Crim
son," a color reminiscent of
dried blood. It is suspect to me
that Stanford adopted the
"Cardinal," a color reminis
cent of fresh blood. One might
get the idea that the policy
makers here are also insecure
about Harvard. Unfortunately,
it is not possible to acquire the
dignity and respectability of
another school merely by ap
propriating one of its tradi
tions.
It makes sense. After all, this
is not Harvard, never will be,
and students should stop try
ing to make it so. There are too
many similarities already.
