# Skydiving: a natural high
## 
### Richard Hefter 
"That's got to be the closest
thing to Hying," we agreed on
the car ride back to campus.
"Not hearing anything —
just the wind — Wow!" one
girl spoke in fragments, ap
pearing to only partially con
ceive of what she had just
done.

Eight students, myself in
cluded, were returning to the
University after spending an af
ternoon at the Antioch Sport
Parachute Center. For seven of
us, it was our first jump and the
climax of many days of "high
anxiety." For Andy Cargile, the
organizer of the trip, it was his
second jump, and all he could

say was, "When can I go
again?"
Itwas Thursday evening, and
we had just achieved a high
that would fly us through Big
Came weekend.
The instruction began the
previous Sunday morning at
6a.m. Lack of sleep did not di
minish our adrenaline, how
ever, as the seven of us (Andy
had already been through in
struction) anxiously awaited
the lesson.
The skydiving instructor,
Carl, was nothing short of a
WWI drill sergeant, rigorously
preparing the class for all regu
lar and emergency proce
dures. Antioch has not had a
first-jump fatality in 21 years,
and Carl was set on maintain
ing tradition.
He emphasized the impor
tance of landing correctly. The
fall can sometimes have the
impact of landing from a two
story building, he said, but
with a proper Parachute Land
ing Fall (PLF), one can land
even on cement without in
jury.
But, he warned, "we haul off
at least one person to the hos
pital every week because of a
bad PLF."
Carl prepared the class for
any emergency situation. If the
parachute doesn't open, he
explained, one has 19 seconds
before hitting the ground.
Therefore, one must act
quickly and correctly.
He attached each student to
a harness hanging from the
ceiling and yelled out various
emergencies that might be en
countered to test reactions.
He screamed, "You have a
streamer — You're falling —
What do you do?"
A streamer is when the
parachute canopy entangles
and does not open. One must

get rid of it by "cutting away"
and then pulling the
emergency chute handle. Cut
ting away allows the
emergency parachute to open
without getting tangled with
the first chute.
It was dark by the end of
Sunday's lessons, and we
would have to return another
day in order to jump. Everyone
agreed on Thursday: four long
days ahead.
Tension was undoubtedly
building up during these four
days. "Good luck," friends
would say to me before the
jump. "Good luck," I've always
felt, is an inappropriate phrase
because you shouldn't ever
have to count on luck. Except
in skydiving.
There is always that chance
that someone packed a bad
parachute. And there is that
other chance that someone
else packed a bad emergency
parachute.
And so it both parachutes
fail, then you are certainly very
much "out of luck!"
2800 feet above the ground, I
sat in the open doorway of an
airplane, gazing out at the vas
tness of the earth and awaiting
the jumpmaster's signal,
"Go!"
Across the earth's horizon,
the sun was setting over the
hills and partly hiding itself be

hind clouds — its late
afternoon colors still shining
beautifully.
The wind was pulling me out
of the doorway, and so when
the jumpmaster signaled, I just
let go and fell.
Because people jumping for
the first few times are not ac
customed to falling out of
planes, a static line attached to
the plane automatically opens
the parachute.
Though I was falling close to
bl) mph, I lelt almost still, as if
the air was moving, but not me.
The 150 feet I fell before the
chute opened could have been
1000 feet or none at all.
Time also had no meaning.
The three to five seconds I was
free-falling may very well have
been much longer.
By the time I even attempted
to conceive of where I was,
how long I'd been falling, the
static line had pulled the chute
open, and I was dangling from
my harness.
I looked up to see if the
canopy had opened properly. I
must have been wearing a tre
mendous smile of relief, be
cause the people in the
airplane later said they could
see my face beaming from far
away.
For two and a half minutes, I
glided like a bird toward the




ground. I could see a lake,
hills, a delta, prairies and even
San Francisco smog.
The rear risers of a parachute
have strings attached enabling
one to steer the canopy toward
a target area 20 feet in diame

ter. And so I turned my atten
tion to guiding myself accu
rately, for I did not feel like
landing in the lake with about
40 pounds of equipment at
tached to me.
"Feet together! Keep your
legs straight!" they screamed
to me from below. I was now
about 100 feet from the ground
and preparing for my PLF.
The earth was coming to

ward me at about 14 teet per
second, and before I knew it,
my feet touched the ground
and I fell safely at the edge of
the gravel target area.
I watched nearby as seven
more students landed without
injury. Some were smiling and
laughing, while others were

dazed and silent — each
seemed to be experiencing a
very unique and personal reve
lation.
I agreed with what the
instructor had said: "Skydiving
is the greatest thing you can do
with your clothes on."

parachute canopy entangles
and does not open. One must

get rid of it by "cutting away"
and then pulling the
emergency chute handle. Cut
ting away allows the
emergency parachute to open
without getting tangled with
the first chute.
It was dark by the end of
Sunday's lessons, and we
would have to return another
day in order to jump. Everyone
agreed on Thursday: four long
days ahead.
Tension was undoubtedly
building up during these four
days. "Good luck," friends
would say to me before the
jump. "Good luck," I've always
felt, is an inappropriate phrase
because you shouldn't ever
have to count on luck. Except
in skydiving.
There is always that chance
that someone packed a bad
parachute. And there is that
other chance that someone
else packed a bad emergency
parachute.
And so it both parachutes
fail, then you are certainly very
much "out of luck!"
2800 feet above the ground, I
sat in the open doorway of an
airplane, gazing out at the vas
tness of the earth and awaiting
the jumpmaster's signal,
"Go!"
Across the earth's horizon,
the sun was setting over the
hills and partly hiding itself be

hind clouds — its late
afternoon colors still shining
beautifully.
The wind was pulling me out
of the doorway, and so when
the jumpmaster signaled, I just
let go and fell.
Because people jumping for
the first few times are not ac
customed to falling out of
planes, a static line attached to
the plane automatically opens
the parachute.
Though I was falling close to
bl) mph, I lelt almost still, as if
the air was moving, but not me.
The 150 feet I fell before the
chute opened could have been
1000 feet or none at all.
Time also had no meaning.
The three to five seconds I was
free-falling may very well have
been much longer.
By the time I even attempted
to conceive of where I was,
how long I'd been falling, the
static line had pulled the chute
open, and I was dangling from
my harness.
I looked up to see if the
canopy had opened properly. I
must have been wearing a tre
mendous smile of relief, be
cause the people in the
airplane later said they could
see my face beaming from far
away.
For two and a half minutes, I
glided like a bird toward the




ground. I could see a lake,
hills, a delta, prairies and even
San Francisco smog.
The rear risers of a parachute
have strings attached enabling
one to steer the canopy toward
a target area 20 feet in diame

ter. And so I turned my atten
tion to guiding myself accu
rately, for I did not feel like
landing in the lake with about
40 pounds of equipment at
tached to me.
"Feet together! Keep your
legs straight!" they screamed
to me from below. I was now
about 100 feet from the ground
and preparing for my PLF.
The earth was coming to

ward me at about 14 teet per
second, and before I knew it,
my feet touched the ground
and I fell safely at the edge of
the gravel target area.
I watched nearby as seven
more students landed without
injury. Some were smiling and
laughing, while others were

dazed and silent — each
seemed to be experiencing a
very unique and personal reve
lation.
I agreed with what the
instructor had said: "Skydiving
is the greatest thing you can do
with your clothes on."

"That's got to be the closest
thing to Hying," we agreed on
the car ride back to campus.
"Not hearing anything —
just the wind — Wow!" one
girl spoke in fragments, ap
pearing to only partially con
ceive of what she had just
done.

Eight students, myself in
cluded, were returning to the
University after spending an af
ternoon at the Antioch Sport
Parachute Center. For seven of
us, it was our first jump and the
climax of many days of "high
anxiety." For Andy Cargile, the
organizer of the trip, it was his
second jump, and all he could

say was, "When can I go
again?"
Itwas Thursday evening, and
we had just achieved a high
that would fly us through Big
Came weekend.
The instruction began the
previous Sunday morning at
6a.m. Lack of sleep did not di
minish our adrenaline, how
ever, as the seven of us (Andy
had already been through in
struction) anxiously awaited
the lesson.
The skydiving instructor,
Carl, was nothing short of a
WWI drill sergeant, rigorously
preparing the class for all regu
lar and emergency proce
dures. Antioch has not had a
first-jump fatality in 21 years,
and Carl was set on maintain
ing tradition.
He emphasized the impor
tance of landing correctly. The
fall can sometimes have the
impact of landing from a two
story building, he said, but
with a proper Parachute Land
ing Fall (PLF), one can land
even on cement without in
jury.
But, he warned, "we haul off
at least one person to the hos
pital every week because of a
bad PLF."
Carl prepared the class for
any emergency situation. If the
parachute doesn't open, he
explained, one has 19 seconds
before hitting the ground.
Therefore, one must act
quickly and correctly.
He attached each student to
a harness hanging from the
ceiling and yelled out various
emergencies that might be en
countered to test reactions.
He screamed, "You have a
streamer — You're falling —
What do you do?"
