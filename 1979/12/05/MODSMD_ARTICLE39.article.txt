# Will Carter get black vote again?
## 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — President
Jimmy Carter's spectacular
political star seemed sud
denly dim that spring of
1976 as blacks recoiled from
his use of the term "ethnic
purity'' in a statement on
open housing.
But when the aging bull of
the movement — the Rev.
Martin Luther King, Sr. —
embraced Carter on a plat
form in downtown Atlanta,
much of the shock and fury
disappeared. Carter,
elected with the help ot the
black vote, termed King's
endorsement the turning
point of his campaign.
Carter still holds the bles
sings of the King family as he
faces the 1%0 election. But
there is doubt the King en
dorsement will be enough
to deliver the black vote
again to the Deep South's
first president since the Re

construction.
Today there is dissension
and frustration among black
voters over issues unlikely
to be quickly resolved or to
lade far from memory: the
resignation of U.S. Ambas
sador to the United Nations
Andrew Young, strained re
lations between blacks and
lews, the impact on blacks
of inflation and unemploy
ment.
And there is the candi
dacy of Sen. Edward Ken
nedy, whose family won the
affections of many blocks
during the early days of the
civil rights movement.
An October poll by the
Atlanta-based Darden Re
search Corp. found Ken
nedy leading Carter 50 per
cent to 35 percent among
black voters in Georgia, the
president's home state.
With all voters included in

the 57-town sampling of 500
voters, the poll indicated
Carter would still carry his
home state in Georgia's
March 11 primary. Those
percentages were 60 per
cent tor Carter and 27 per
cent for Kennedy.
But much would be made
over the symbolism if Carter
could not hold the black
vote at home.
"If there is dissension
among the black voters at
home, that's going to multi
ply across the nation," said
Georgia state Rep. Hosea
Williams, former executive
director of the Southern
Christian Leadership Con
ference.
And the dissension is
there, said Steven Suitts, di
rector of the Southern Reg
ional Council. Suitts said
Carter cannot count on
black support because ot

the administration's "mixed
record" on economic issues
given high priority by
blacks.
"Part of the problem of
the president may be that he
established expectations
which the administration
simply cannot fulfill
whether it wanted to or
not," said Suitts. "The net
effect ot what's happened is
that the president is not
going to be able to count on
large numbers of black sup
porters if there is another
candidate who does have a
traditional constituency
among blacks."
In his most recent en
dorsement of Carter,
"Daddy" King said:
"Sen. Kennedy is our
friend. Our tragedies are
alike. But I am Carter's close
friend."
