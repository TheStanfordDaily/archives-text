# Increase of 12 percent
## Trustees to vote on tuition hike 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
General tuition, room and board
rates will increase 12.2 percent, from
$7949 to $8921, next fall if administra
tion recommendations for new rates
are approved by the Board of Trus
tees.
The recommendations include a
$690 general tuition increase, from
$5595 to $6285. Room and board will
rise $282, from $2354 to $2636, under
the proposals. The figures represent
12.3 and 12 percent increases respec
tively.
The administration will also ask for
a 20 percent tuition increase for new
medical students, a 12 percent l aw
School tuition increase, and a 14 per
cent hike in Escondido Village
apartment rents.
Approval of the recommendations
is virtually assured, administrators
say.
Officials made the recommenda
tions public yesterday at a briefing
for student leaders and the press.
The board will consider the propos
als at its meeting next week.
Tough one ahead
Despite the increases, adminis
trators at the briefing warned that the
coming year would be a difficult one
for the University financially.
Inflation was blamed for the in
creases and the gloomy outlook.
Kent Peterson, associate vice pres
ident for business and finance, out
lined the basic points of the latest
University Long-Range Forecast (LRF)
and said there was a reasonable pos
sibility that the University would run
a deficit budget in 1980-81.
The University has shown small
surpluses over the past few years and
expects to break even this year.
Comparably priced
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost
for budget and planning, said Uni
versity research indicates that 84 per
cent of students refusing a Stanford
offer of admission into the Class of
1984 accepted offers at other com
parably priced private institutions.
This fact, plus the increasing
number of applicants the University
is drawing, leads to the conclusion
that high tuition is not steering pros

pective students elsewhere.
Tuition comprises 50 percent of
that budget and is the income categ
ory over which the University has the
most control.
Bacchetti and Peterson both said
the University was doing all that it
could to improve other income
sources, which include gifts, cost
reimbursement from research, and
endowment income.
Extraordinary rise
At the Medical School, an extraor
dinary tuition increase of 6.5 percent
over and above the general increase
will mean new students next year will
pay 20 percent more tuition than this
year.
Returning students' tuition will,
like general tuition, increase 12.3
percent.
Tuition paid, then, will rise $1224
for new students — from $6114 to
$7338 — and $753 lor returning stu
dents — to $6867.
David Hopkins, assistant dean for
administration at the Medical
School, explained that the extraordi
nary increase was needed to bring
tuition into line with an administra
tion policy that tuition make up 22
percent of the cost of medical educa
tion.
The 22-percent figure was the per
centage tuition paid for earlier this

decade. Over the past tew years,
however, the contribution of tuition
to the budget has fallen to 17 per
cent, Hopkins said.
Last year, the Board of Trustees
stunned the administration when it
rejected a proposal to increase Med
ical School tuition more than 27 per
cent to bring it back up to the 22
percent.
That action, the only board rejec
tion of a tuition recommendation in
recent history, was believed to be
mainly political in motivation. The
University did not want to appear to
be a "bad citizen" in light of the
then-new wage and price guidelines.
At that time, the board ordered a
phased-in return to the 22-percent
of-cost level and later approved a
13.5 percent increase.
Hopkins said the 22-percent level
will be nearly achieved with the
proposed increase and that tuition
increases in the future will be de
signed to maintain that level.
Current Medical School tuition is
at the approximate median of private
medical schools nationwide. Tuition
charged this year ranges from $2400
to $13,500.
Law School tuition will rise $690
from $5774 to $6434, keeping to its
usual formula of a $150 surcharge on
general tuition.
