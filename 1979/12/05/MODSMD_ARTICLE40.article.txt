### Dianne Cahoon 
Where are all your outraged responses or at
least intriguing questions? I'm still waiting by my
hole in the wall. I did manage to happen upon a
tew pertinent perplexities, no thanks to most of
you apathetic creatures. Criticism comes easily;
reflective consideration does not.
Here's today's grist: ,
How should I cope with the pending stress ot
finals? I already feel burnt out, and it's just Dead
Week.
- Red hot
Okay, Red, I feel eminently qualified to assist
you on this one, since I am currently approach
ing my tenth finals week at The Farm. There's
really nothing to it, so don't let exams intimidate
you unduly. There's really no need to lose your
mind over a few piddling tests and grades. Re
member, this is just another week in your life. Its
outcome may shape the rest of your existence,
but that's only a minor point.
Most importantly, don't become suddenly
hyperactive. So what if you have one research
project, two term papers and three finals con
verging on Monday, and you haven't bothered
to crack a book all quarter? Calm down, and
relax. Your profs are ex-students themselves
and will undoubtedly be sympathetic to your
cause.
At any rate, don't rush out and change all your
daily patterns. If you normally participate in
physical activities, continue that. If not, don't
start jogging now. Such an unwise maneuver
could place excess stress and strain on your
waning strength. Maintain your normal study
habits and location. If you usually study accom
panied by blaring stereo noises in your room,
don't join the hoards at Meyer. You will defi
nitely feel out-of-sorts and unable to properly
concentrate. If you feel comfortable commun
ing in commiseration with a friend, you should

certainly do that.
Do something different when you find your
self just spinning your wheels unproductively.
Go grab a little exercise, rest without con
templating your work or try a cat nap it you re
overly fatigued. I know, you're too busy for such
asides, right? Yet, studies have shown that you
will accomplish much more and be more effi
cient if you indulge in a slight break instead of
stubbornly plodding along. Interludes are not
luxuries but necessities.
Many people, particularly students, have a
tendency to be stuck in a stress response syn
drome. Otten, increased vigilance, physical ac
tivity and rumination will combine with a lack of
sleep to produce a type of workaholism. Never
pausing from a moment of work, the person
drives himself into a mad and unproductive
frenzy which re-enforces itself into an inescapa
ble vicious circle.
Take note of your consumption. Ingesting
loads of stimulants is not recommended. Your
body may continue to function, but your brain
will probably switch off (which may be typical of
many of us, anyway). Drink water and juice in
stead ol drowning yourself in coffee and dark
colored soft drinks. Caffeine will only aggravate
your inbred stress response and will not help
you to retain staggering amounts of worthless
knowledge.
Stress is otten attended by either an increased
sex drive or loss of libido altogether. If you are
afflicted by one of these conditions, don't be
surprised, but don't allow that to dominate or
destroy your life.
Good luck. And after the vacation, make me
happy. Don't ignore my existence. Please write
in with some taxing questions to which I can give
some titillating answers.
