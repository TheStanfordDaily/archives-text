# Energy conservation: Mass. town shows it can be done
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” In a Massachusetts town of
38,000 people, federal officials think they have
found a way to put years of rhetoric about
energy conservation into practice. By winter's
end, the town could see its fuel oil use cut by
50,000 barrels.
Federal officials hope to try the idea across the
country.
Devised by the federal volunteer agency AC
TION, the project began Oct. 24 in Fitchburg, 47
miles northwest of Boston.
By mobilizing the community to partially
weatherproof its homes, Fitchburg Action to
Conserve Energy (FACE) hopes to save 2.1 mill
ion gallons of oil and reduce fuel bills by two
million dollars. Fitchburg's heating oil, at 95
cents a gallon, is amongthe highest priced in the
nation.
On Nov. 12 ACTION Director Sam Brown and
Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Thomas O'Neill toured the
project.
Their visit came a day after President jimmy Car
ter ended oil imports from Iran. Faced with the
loss of 700,000 barrels of Iranian oil, or 4 percent of
U.S. consumption, Carter appealed to the nation
"to redouble efforts to curtail the use of petroleum
products."
Energy cut 'can be done'
"To cut our energy use by the four percent
Iran gives us," Brown said in an interview,
"takes just the simplest use of existing re
sources, people and ingenuity, which Fitchburg
is proving can be done."
The idea's author, Don Green of ACTION,

said, "People all over are aching tor a way to
help out, but they hear talk about millions of
barrels of oil and think cleaning the backs of their
refrigerators won't help. We thought if we could
get one town to work together, we could show
that all those small efforts make a difference."
Tamara Stanton, ACTION'S Fitchburg coor
dinator, described FACE:
The local antipoverty agency had $175,000
from the Energy Department to pay federal job
trainees to do total weatherprooting, but it
lacked the workers. ACTION convinced the
Energy Department to allow volunteers to do
partial weatherprooting.
It also convinced the Department ot Housing
and Urban Development to give the city $95,000
for materials tor moderate-income families, so a
family ot four with an income of $14,000 can get
free caulking, weather-stripping and insulation.
Half the residents qualify.
Volunteers fanned out to explain the project
from 10 FACE offices, which were also used as
schools to train residents in weatherproofing.
Publicity
FACE leaflets were inserted in newspapers
and in gas and electric bills. About 7500 leaflets
were carried home by school children.
FACE hopes to partially weatherproof 7700 of
Fitchburg's 14,000 residences. Already, 750 have
been done for a saving of 187,500 gallons of oil.
Through measures costing between $15 and
$30 a home, FACE says it can cut a home heating
bill 25 to 30 percent, or about $300.
