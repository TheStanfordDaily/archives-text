# Dance instructor teaches emotion, expression
## Valenzuela: body a 'marvelous instrument' 
### Vance Mason 
"Don't think about it, feel
it!" commands the lean, nut
brown man at the front of the
dance studio, and 31 amateur
Barishnikovs strive to obey.
Moving gracefully, he
pauses to gently straighten a
student's slightly bent leg,
then glides back to the huge
tom-tom to pound out the next
routine. As the dancers prance
past, he studies them in
tensely, shouting "Yes! That's
it! Now turn! Keep smiling!"
His smooth, Indian features,
jet black hair and sinewy frame
suit a man ot JO. His freshness
and unflagging zeal are those
of a delighted child. |uan Val
enzuela is bl years old.
Valenzuela lays down the
law the first day of class. "I
want all of you, not just your
bodies. When I call roll, your
mind and spirit had better be
here too."
He teaches his own style of
dance, a blend of modern and
classical peppered with lots of
emotion and facial expression.
"Dane ing is a humanistic art,
so bring out your humanity,"
he tells his rapt students.
That's what makes this more
than just a P.E. class." Valen
zuela starts his classes with a
poem or philosophy and en
courages his pupils to think
about it during the lesson.
Although he stresses emo
tion, the physical aspect of
dance is far from neglected.
Students moan and groan
through stretching exercises at
the beginning of every class. "I
t an tell it's Wednesday by how
sore my legs are," says Lisa
Glass, a member of his Move
ment for Actors class.
"We must learn to guide the
body, to trust it, to obey it.
Look at you! You've lived in
this marvelous instrument for
20 years, and you still don't
know it. Work with it, not
against it.
"My teacher, Martha

Graham, one of the three great
dance masters of our time,"
Valenzuela says with pride,
"taught me that by knowing
our bodies, we transcend the
physical and become the
dance-poet."
Valenzuela studied with
Graham four years. "I'll never
forget the day she asked me to
understudy for her company.
It's the highest honor I'll ever
be given."
That honor came in 1949,
when he was 30. Valenzuela
got a late start on his dance
career due to being drafted
into the Army for five years
right out of high school. Re
turning home to Salt Lake City,
Utah, he worked in an office
and took dance classes at
night. The only local dancer in
the musical Promise of Valley,
which played in Salt Lake City
in 194b, Valenzuela was singled
out by choreographer Helen
Tomeris in New York.
"Talk about culture shock. I
was raised as a Mormon, and
the sinful city was hard to ad

just to. Plus I was a minority,
and other dancers would look
at me like 'What are YOU doing
here?' Everyone was better
than me.
"I lived like a monk, taking
classes eight hours a day with
Catherine Dunham, every
thing I could find, ballet, ja/z,
psychology for the dancer,
stage lighting, i was insatiable.
I felt like I had to make up for
the five years I lost to the Army.
Valenzuela worked so hard
his first year in New York that
his health deteriorated. He
fainted doing pirouettes and
broke his left ankle. "I was in a
cast foreight weeks Talk about
hell," he shudders, closing his
eyes. "I still can't balance well
on my left leg.''
By the end of the year, he
was so sick with mononuc
leosis, malnutrition and lack of
sleep that he was forced to go
home to Salt Lake to recover.
After he recovered, he re
turned to New York to study
and teach with Martha Graham
for four years.

Since that time, he has
danced and taught throughout
Utah, New Mexico and
California. A grant from the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts
allows him to teach children
for tree. Two weeks of October
were spent teaching elemen
tary school children and local
dance instructors in Hawaii
how to express themselves
through their bodies. The trip
culminated in a dance concert
directed by luan.
Valenzuela has taught dance
at Stanford for the last five
years. "I'm angry at Stanford.
They have the bare minimum
of a dance department just so
that they won't be critic ized tor
not having a dance department
"I see the potential for
genius in students, then I get
frustrated because there is not
a dance department to help
them express their genius."
One such "genius" is Marty
Moran, a freshman student of
Valenzuela's last year who
dropped out of school this year
to pursue dance and acting.

Marty assisted Valenzuela in
Hawaii, and is currently taking
ballet, voice, piano and acting
lessons in preparation tor an
assault on New York next year.
"I've started notes on an idea
I 've had tor a long time, a Mus
ical of the Aged Dancer. It will
have a very young dancer and
an aged dancer. The young
dancer can only travel forward
in time, but the aged dancer
can travel forward and back
ward and help the young
dancer along."
Teaching young people also
rejuvenates Valenzuela. "Their
energy inlects me and I reflect
their enthusiasm." He pulls a
folder from his desk and dis
plays drawings by third
graders, titled "Thanks Mr.
. |uan."
"Sometimes I get so tired, I'm
torn by different classes, and I
ask myself 'Why are you doing
this? Why don't you retire and
slow down?'
"Then I realize, " he grins
"that I would probably b
bored stiff."

the beginning of every class. "I
t an tell it's Wednesday by how
sore my legs are," says Lisa
Glass, a member of his Move
ment for Actors class.
"We must learn to guide the
body, to trust it, to obey it.
Look at you! You've lived in
this marvelous instrument for
20 years, and you still don't
know it. Work with it, not
against it.
"My teacher, Martha

Graham, one of the three great
dance masters of our time,"
Valenzuela says with pride,
"taught me that by knowing
our bodies, we transcend the
physical and become the
dance-poet."
Valenzuela studied with
Graham four years. "I'll never
forget the day she asked me to
understudy for her company.
It's the highest honor I'll ever
be given."
That honor came in 1949,
when he was 30. Valenzuela
got a late start on his dance
career due to being drafted
into the Army for five years
right out of high school. Re
turning home to Salt Lake City,
Utah, he worked in an office
and took dance classes at
night. The only local dancer in
the musical Promise of Valley,
which played in Salt Lake City
in 194b, Valenzuela was singled
out by choreographer Helen
Tomeris in New York.
"Talk about culture shock. I
was raised as a Mormon, and
the sinful city was hard to ad

just to. Plus I was a minority,
and other dancers would look
at me like 'What are YOU doing
here?' Everyone was better
than me.
"I lived like a monk, taking
classes eight hours a day with
Catherine Dunham, every
thing I could find, ballet, ja/z,
psychology for the dancer,
stage lighting, i was insatiable.
I felt like I had to make up for
the five years I lost to the Army.
Valenzuela worked so hard
his first year in New York that
his health deteriorated. He
fainted doing pirouettes and
broke his left ankle. "I was in a
cast foreight weeks Talk about
hell," he shudders, closing his
eyes. "I still can't balance well
on my left leg.''
By the end of the year, he
was so sick with mononuc
leosis, malnutrition and lack of
sleep that he was forced to go
home to Salt Lake to recover.
After he recovered, he re
turned to New York to study
and teach with Martha Graham
for four years.

Since that time, he has
danced and taught throughout
Utah, New Mexico and
California. A grant from the Na
tional Endowment for the Arts
allows him to teach children
for tree. Two weeks of October
were spent teaching elemen
tary school children and local
dance instructors in Hawaii
how to express themselves
through their bodies. The trip
culminated in a dance concert
directed by luan.
Valenzuela has taught dance
at Stanford for the last five
years. "I'm angry at Stanford.
They have the bare minimum
of a dance department just so
that they won't be critic ized tor
not having a dance department
"I see the potential for
genius in students, then I get
frustrated because there is not
a dance department to help
them express their genius."
One such "genius" is Marty
Moran, a freshman student of
Valenzuela's last year who
dropped out of school this year
to pursue dance and acting.

Marty assisted Valenzuela in
Hawaii, and is currently taking
ballet, voice, piano and acting
lessons in preparation tor an
assault on New York next year.
"I've started notes on an idea
I 've had tor a long time, a Mus
ical of the Aged Dancer. It will
have a very young dancer and
an aged dancer. The young
dancer can only travel forward
in time, but the aged dancer
can travel forward and back
ward and help the young
dancer along."
Teaching young people also
rejuvenates Valenzuela. "Their
energy inlects me and I reflect
their enthusiasm." He pulls a
folder from his desk and dis
plays drawings by third
graders, titled "Thanks Mr.
. |uan."
"Sometimes I get so tired, I'm
torn by different classes, and I
ask myself 'Why are you doing
this? Why don't you retire and
slow down?'
"Then I realize, " he grins
"that I would probably b
bored stiff."

Instructor Juan Valen/uela teaches a mixture of c lassical and modern
dance in his classes here.
"Don't think about it, feel
it!" commands the lean, nut
brown man at the front of the
dance studio, and 31 amateur
Barishnikovs strive to obey.
Moving gracefully, he
pauses to gently straighten a
student's slightly bent leg,
then glides back to the huge
tom-tom to pound out the next
routine. As the dancers prance
past, he studies them in
tensely, shouting "Yes! That's
it! Now turn! Keep smiling!"
His smooth, Indian features,
jet black hair and sinewy frame
suit a man ot JO. His freshness
and unflagging zeal are those
of a delighted child. |uan Val
enzuela is bl years old.
Valenzuela lays down the
law the first day of class. "I
want all of you, not just your
bodies. When I call roll, your
mind and spirit had better be
here too."
He teaches his own style of
dance, a blend of modern and
classical peppered with lots of
emotion and facial expression.
"Dane ing is a humanistic art,
so bring out your humanity,"
he tells his rapt students.
That's what makes this more
than just a P.E. class." Valen
zuela starts his classes with a
poem or philosophy and en
courages his pupils to think
about it during the lesson.
Although he stresses emo
tion, the physical aspect of
dance is far from neglected.
