# Alaskans seek ways to spend extra billion
## 
### 
Anchorage, Alaska (AP) —
While Northeastern cities
hover on the edge of ban
kruptcy and inflation licks at
local governments across the
land, Alaska's treasury is»burst
ing with a spare $1 billion.
The unexpected bundle ar
rived because of Alaska's oil
treasure on its North Slope.
The price of Alaska oil is tied to
the prices posted by the Or
ganization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries — and those
prices have risen and risen
again.
Royalties and severance taxes
paid on oil leaving the state ac
count for 70 percent of the
Legislature's annual revenues.
This year alone, the price
boosts have been translated
into a $1 billion budget
surplus. That is enough to pay
normal operating expenses —
and then issue each Alaskan a
check for $2700.
Analysts say the surplus
could total $27.8 billion in the
19905.
Six months ago, those same
state analysts were predicting
Alaska could go broke by the
mid-1980s as Prudhoe Bay pro
duction tapered off. Now
bureaucrats are scratching
their heads over what to do
with the windfall. Alaska's
400,000 residents, however,
have plenty of ideas.
They have flooded news
papers and politicians with let
ters suggesting the money be
spent to help the handicapped,
build a Swiss-style ski resort at
Mount McKinley, develop hyd
roelectric energy, provide free
transportation and free educa

tion.
They have suggested con
struction projects ranging from
a natural gas pipeline to a
municipal golf course in An
chorage. They want loans
given for business, industry,
agriculture, tourism and hous
ing.
Tiie Anchorage Times as
signed a "Billion Dollar Editor"
to keep track of letters on how
to "Help the Governor Spend a
Billion."

Editor: What to do with the bill
ion dollars? 1. Do not let the
legislators get their hands on
it."
Not surprisingly, some are
urging the state to either
abolish its individual income
tax or give citizens tax credits
based on length of residence in
Alaska.
"I don't believe the state
should be in the business of
saving our budget surplus, but
should disperse it to Alaska re
sidents," Dennis Bottorff told
the Fairbanks Daily News-
Miner.
State officials are not en
thusiastic about the idea of
doing away with the state indi
vidual income tax.
Deputy Commissioner of
taxation joe Donohue said he
felt it would be too risky to run
state government on an un
predictable and fluctuating oil
income. He said, for example,
that the state would be "strap
ped" for funds if the trans-
Alaska pipeline were shut
down for any longer than one
month.
