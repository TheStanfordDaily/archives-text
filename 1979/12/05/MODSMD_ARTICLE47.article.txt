# Summer experiences 'change lives'
## Students work in Africa 
### Jiri Weiss 
Concern that the "darkest
thing about Africa is America's
ignorance of it" prompted Rev.
James Robinson to found Op
eration Crossroads Africa,
which sends about 200 young
Americans each year to live and
work in African villages.
About 5000 volunteers have
travelled with Crossroads since
the program was founded in
1958, spending their summers
in various countries construct
ing schools, health clinics and
water systems, and photo
graphing historical monu
ments.
Technical skill is desirable
but not required of particip
ants. Volunteers travel in small
coed and racially mixed
groups, each with a Crossroads
leader.
Crossroads, a nationwide
organization based in New

York, attracts a few persons
from the University each year.
Every one of the several
Crossroads returnees who
spoke at a recent informational
meeting at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center agreed that
Crossroads had altered their
lives.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy said his experience
with Crossroads helped de
termine his career studying Af
rica.
"You learn more about your
self," he said. "The best fea
ture of the trip is work, getting
everyone's hands dirty . . . .
Abernethy recalled how he
was frustrated by the pace of
work at the construction site
he was assigned to, but "I got a
perspective on the work ethic
and learned to cool it."
But, "some caution is neces
sary," Abernethy warned.

Many projects run into dit
ficulties, primarily because
they are "at the mercy of the
host government and its in
terests, and there are many
things that can go wrong," he
said.
But the harsh life and snags
do not seem to deter Crns
sroaders.
Kim Euell, a senior majoring
in International Relations, was
about to leave tor Ghana last
spring when there was a milit
ary coup. As a result, her group
had trouble getting supplies to
the village where they were
building part of a rural train
ing center.
"It was a kind of experience
that I would never get
elsewhere," Euell said. "I
wanted to test myself." She
said that she had to deal with
food shortages, typhoid fever
she contracted, and soldiers
who harassed her group when
they did not have proper iden
tification.
Michael Kerner, a youth
counselor at the. YMCA in
Redwood City, led a group to
Sierra Leone. They were going
to clear land and build a house
in the village of Mabuveh.
"Most of us felt a strong cul
ture shock," Kerner said. They
worked in an isolated village
consisting of four huts. Kerner,
10 other Americans and their
Sierra Leonean counterparts
had to sleep on straw mats on
the floor.
The rain, mosquitoes and
low-protein diet made their
stay "difficult on a physical and
eventually emotional level,"
said Kerner. Sickness was
another problem. One
member contracted malaria,
and others developed rashes,
according to Kerner.

"All of us were gung-ho
about working," he said, but
the group did not finish their
job because of weather and
lack of appropriate tools.
Despite the problems that
plagued their trip, Kerner said
that of the people that went,
only one was dissatisfied.
Not all of the groups have
such problems. Keith Ar
chuleta, a Stanford alumnus
who went to Liberia, said his
experience was "more positive
and well-planned" than some.
Volunteers must raise about
$2000 to cover expenses. Euell
and Archuleta raised money
by distributing a proposal they
had written to organizations
both on and off campus, in
cluding banks and corpora
tion. Euell said this worked bet
ter than their bake sales or raf
fles, adding that "tundraising
can be frustrating, so you
should get an early start."

Concern that the "darkest
thing about Africa is America's
ignorance of it" prompted Rev.
James Robinson to found Op
eration Crossroads Africa,
which sends about 200 young
Americans each year to live and
work in African villages.
About 5000 volunteers have
travelled with Crossroads since
the program was founded in
1958, spending their summers
in various countries construct
ing schools, health clinics and
water systems, and photo
graphing historical monu
ments.
Technical skill is desirable
but not required of particip
ants. Volunteers travel in small
coed and racially mixed
groups, each with a Crossroads
leader.
Crossroads, a nationwide
organization based in New

York, attracts a few persons
from the University each year.
Every one of the several
Crossroads returnees who
spoke at a recent informational
meeting at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center agreed that
Crossroads had altered their
lives.
Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy said his experience
with Crossroads helped de
termine his career studying Af
rica.
"You learn more about your
self," he said. "The best fea
ture of the trip is work, getting
everyone's hands dirty . . . .
Abernethy recalled how he
was frustrated by the pace of
work at the construction site
he was assigned to, but "I got a
perspective on the work ethic
and learned to cool it."
But, "some caution is neces
sary," Abernethy warned.

Many projects run into dit
ficulties, primarily because
they are "at the mercy of the
host government and its in
terests, and there are many
things that can go wrong," he
said.
But the harsh life and snags
do not seem to deter Crns
sroaders.
Kim Euell, a senior majoring
in International Relations, was
about to leave tor Ghana last
spring when there was a milit
ary coup. As a result, her group
had trouble getting supplies to
the village where they were
building part of a rural train
ing center.
"It was a kind of experience
that I would never get
elsewhere," Euell said. "I
wanted to test myself." She
said that she had to deal with
food shortages, typhoid fever
she contracted, and soldiers
who harassed her group when
they did not have proper iden
tification.
Michael Kerner, a youth
counselor at the. YMCA in
Redwood City, led a group to
Sierra Leone. They were going
to clear land and build a house
in the village of Mabuveh.
"Most of us felt a strong cul
ture shock," Kerner said. They
worked in an isolated village
consisting of four huts. Kerner,
10 other Americans and their
Sierra Leonean counterparts
had to sleep on straw mats on
the floor.
The rain, mosquitoes and
low-protein diet made their
stay "difficult on a physical and
eventually emotional level,"
said Kerner. Sickness was
another problem. One
member contracted malaria,
and others developed rashes,
according to Kerner.

"All of us were gung-ho
about working," he said, but
the group did not finish their
job because of weather and
lack of appropriate tools.
Despite the problems that
plagued their trip, Kerner said
that of the people that went,
only one was dissatisfied.
Not all of the groups have
such problems. Keith Ar
chuleta, a Stanford alumnus
who went to Liberia, said his
experience was "more positive
and well-planned" than some.
Volunteers must raise about
$2000 to cover expenses. Euell
and Archuleta raised money
by distributing a proposal they
had written to organizations
both on and off campus, in
cluding banks and corpora
tion. Euell said this worked bet
ter than their bake sales or raf
fles, adding that "tundraising
can be frustrating, so you
should get an early start."
