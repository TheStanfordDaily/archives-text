# Convert to metric system, but slowly
## 
### 
Los Angeles(AP)—California
elementary schools were
urged last week to take a mea
sured approach to metric edu
cation instead of a "cold tur
key" method that would have
eliminated feet, pounds and
other customary units from
classrooms next year.
A resolution calling for "a
comprehensive program to
give major 'mphasis to the
teaching of the metric system
of measurement" w„s ap
proved by the California Metric
Conversion Council at a pujlic
hearing.
The council, an advisory
group appointed by'Gov. jerry
Brown, dropped an earlier re
solution urging exclusive use

of the metric system in elemen
tary classrooms.
The mportance of metric
education was stressed by
CMCC President Richard Por
ter.
Concessions seen
"Bv the 1990s we will all have
made major concessions to the
metric system, if only by de
fault," Porter >aid. "Individuals
who will have to think in terms
of customary units and then
convert to metric will be
greatly disadvantaged over
those who already think in
metric terms."
Although the CMCC resolu
tion has no bind ig effect on
the state Department of Educa
tion, which sets teaching pol
icy, it is expected to influence
the appioach taken to metric
education in the nation's most
populous state.
The resolution calls for phas
ing out of customary units in
elementary school cla^-rooms
and textbooks over the next
few years. However, it stopped
short of the earlier measure
which recommended that only
the metric system be taught in
elementary schools, effective
in the 19H0-81 school year.
'Cold turkey' pushed
Proponents of the "cold
turkey" approach contend that
teaching metrics exclusively
would better equip students
for the increasing use of the
system in coming years. Al
most all other countries except
Great Britain, New Zealand and
Australia already use the
decimal-denominated system
exclusively instead of the
weights and measures most
familiar to North Americans.
