# Trustees to decide fate of new building plans
## 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
Three major, highly controversial
building projects totalling more than
$26 million are slated for trustee con
sideration next week at the board's
regular December meeting.
Two other projects totalling more
than $40 million are also slated for
discussion in what will be the largest
building agenda to come before the
board in recent years.
The three controversial projects
include a $6 million music building, a
$6 million laboratory to house a new
Center for Integrated Systems (CIS),
and a $14 million cardiovascular re
search building at the Medical
Center. Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig said he ex
pects "extensive discussion of all
three" by the board.
The controversy surrounding the
projects involves their funding.
None of the projects presented now
has full funding, a normal require
ment before board approval of
facilities. All three involve major
commitments by the University for
special tundraising for the projects in

the near future.
The cardiovascular research
center, according to the program
proposal, will he a 40,000-square
toot facility adjacent to the Hospital
which will house the Cardiology and
Cardiovascular Surgery Depts.
It is anticipated that the facility will
become one ot the major cardiovas
cular research centers in the world.
In addition to the departments them
selves, the building will house re
search support groups from other
disciplines so the researchers can
collaborate with relative ease.
The facility proposal is being for
warded now because of a special $4
million proposed grant from the Max
Fleischmann Foundation. The foun
dation is willing to commit itself to
making a "good faith effort" to raise
the other $10 million rather quickly.
Terms of the gift ask that construc
tion begin by mid-1981 which would
require initial planning work to begin
next month.
Administration fundraisers have
told trustees in background reports
that they consider the $10 million
goal to be a difficult, but attainable
near meeting department needs.
After years of planning and rethink
ing, the administration will ask the
board to approve a $6 million budget
for a 35,000-square-foot building to
be constructed between Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and Storey House.
Timing of the request centers
around an offer from the Carl F.
Braun Trust to donate $2.5 million for
the building if the project is ap
proved by the board.
The administration believes it can
get the additional $3.5 million
needed through fundraising totalling
$1.2 million and a reassignment of
$2.3 million previously allocated for
Building 120's reconstruction.
The administration promises it can
then replace the $2.3 million of re
construction funds through addi
tional fundraising for Building 120.
Under the program proposal sub
mitted, the music building will house
some faculty and department ad
ministration, including practice
rooms, classrooms, and a 9000-
square-foot library.
The library has been extremely
crowded in recent years, a situation
which culminated last year when the
University built a temporary library
addition in the Knoll courtyard. The
new facility would include room for
13 years of library growth.
The Archive of Recorded Sound
and some other Music Department
facilites will continue to be housed at
the Knoll under the proposal.
The least controversial of the three
new projects is for a $6 million
building for the new CIS. The prop
osal is less controversial because it
seeks only approval of permission to
fundraise for the project. Implicit in

the fundraising program, however, is
project approval if funding is re
ceived.
Under the plan, gifts of between
$300,000 and $1 million will be sol
icited from corporate donors. Prog
ress of the fundraising drive will be
reported to the board in )une when
the board will decide whether to go
ahead with the project.
The facility in question is a 20,000-
square-foot first phase of a planned
60,000-square-foot facility to house
CIS. The Center will be an interdis
ciplinary effort in basic research of
very large-scale integrated systems
(VLSI).
The other building projects to

come before the board this month
are report items, with no action
slated.
The first involves the reconstruc
tion of Building 120, a project which
received final approval in June. Bids
on the project were all "signific
antly" over budget, and the board
will consider the alternatives.
Finally, the board is scheduled to
discuss the proposed 800-unit stu
dent residence which has been in
planning for the past year.
The Dean of Student Atfairs Office
has submitted a lengthy preliminary
report for discussion this month in
cluding basic program conclusions
to date plus decisions on site loca
tion and residence type.

University built a temporary library
addition in the Knoll courtyard. The
new facility would include room for
13 years of library growth.
The Archive of Recorded Sound
and some other Music Department
facilites will continue to be housed at
the Knoll under the proposal.
The least controversial of the three
new projects is for a $6 million
building for the new CIS. The prop
osal is less controversial because it
seeks only approval of permission to
fundraise for the project. Implicit in

the fundraising program, however, is
project approval if funding is re
ceived.
Under the plan, gifts of between
$300,000 and $1 million will be sol
icited from corporate donors. Prog
ress of the fundraising drive will be
reported to the board in )une when
the board will decide whether to go
ahead with the project.
The facility in question is a 20,000-
square-foot first phase of a planned
60,000-square-foot facility to house
CIS. The Center will be an interdis
ciplinary effort in basic research of
very large-scale integrated systems
(VLSI).
The other building projects to

come before the board this month
are report items, with no action
slated.
The first involves the reconstruc
tion of Building 120, a project which
received final approval in June. Bids
on the project were all "signific
antly" over budget, and the board
will consider the alternatives.
Finally, the board is scheduled to
discuss the proposed 800-unit stu
dent residence which has been in
planning for the past year.
The Dean of Student Atfairs Office
has submitted a lengthy preliminary
report for discussion this month in
cluding basic program conclusions
to date plus decisions on site loca
tion and residence type.
Three major, highly controversial
building projects totalling more than
$26 million are slated for trustee con
sideration next week at the board's
regular December meeting.
Two other projects totalling more
than $40 million are also slated for
discussion in what will be the largest
building agenda to come before the
board in recent years.
The three controversial projects
include a $6 million music building, a
$6 million laboratory to house a new
Center for Integrated Systems (CIS),
and a $14 million cardiovascular re
search building at the Medical
Center. Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig said he ex
pects "extensive discussion of all
three" by the board.
The controversy surrounding the
projects involves their funding.
None of the projects presented now
has full funding, a normal require
ment before board approval of
facilities. All three involve major
commitments by the University for
special tundraising for the projects in

the near future.
The cardiovascular research
center, according to the program
proposal, will he a 40,000-square
toot facility adjacent to the Hospital
which will house the Cardiology and
Cardiovascular Surgery Depts.
It is anticipated that the facility will
become one ot the major cardiovas
cular research centers in the world.
In addition to the departments them
selves, the building will house re
search support groups from other
disciplines so the researchers can
collaborate with relative ease.
The facility proposal is being for
warded now because of a special $4
million proposed grant from the Max
Fleischmann Foundation. The foun
dation is willing to commit itself to
making a "good faith effort" to raise
the other $10 million rather quickly.
Terms of the gift ask that construc
tion begin by mid-1981 which would
require initial planning work to begin
next month.
Administration fundraisers have
told trustees in background reports
that they consider the $10 million
goal to be a difficult, but attainable
near meeting department needs.
After years of planning and rethink
ing, the administration will ask the
board to approve a $6 million budget
for a 35,000-square-foot building to
be constructed between Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and Storey House.
Timing of the request centers
around an offer from the Carl F.
Braun Trust to donate $2.5 million for
the building if the project is ap
proved by the board.
The administration believes it can
get the additional $3.5 million
needed through fundraising totalling
$1.2 million and a reassignment of
$2.3 million previously allocated for
Building 120's reconstruction.
The administration promises it can
then replace the $2.3 million of re
construction funds through addi
tional fundraising for Building 120.
Under the program proposal sub
mitted, the music building will house
some faculty and department ad
ministration, including practice
rooms, classrooms, and a 9000-
square-foot library.
