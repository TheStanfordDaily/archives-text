# Trustees to decide fate of new building plans
## 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
Three major, highly controversial
building projects totalling more than
$26 million are slated for trustee con
sideration next week at the board's
regular December meeting.
Two other projects totalling more
than $40 million are also slated for
discussion in what will be the largest
building agenda to come before the
board in recent years.
The three controversial projects
include a $6 million music building, a
$6 million laboratory to house a new
Center for Integrated Systems (CIS),
and a $14 million cardiovascular re
search building at the Medical
Center. Vice President for Public Af
fairs Robert Rosenzweig said he ex
pects "extensive discussion of all
three" by the board.
The controversy surrounding the
projects involves their funding.
None of the projects presented now
has full funding, a normal require
ment before board approval of
facilities. All three involve major
commitments by the University for
special tundraising for the projects in

the near future.
The cardiovascular research
center, according to the program
proposal, will he a 40,000-square
toot facility adjacent to the Hospital
which will house the Cardiology and
Cardiovascular Surgery Depts.
It is anticipated that the facility will
become one ot the major cardiovas
cular research centers in the world.
In addition to the departments them
selves, the building will house re
search support groups from other
disciplines so the researchers can
collaborate with relative ease.
The facility proposal is being for
warded now because of a special $4
million proposed grant from the Max
Fleischmann Foundation. The foun
dation is willing to commit itself to
making a "good faith effort" to raise
the other $10 million rather quickly.
Terms of the gift ask that construc
tion begin by mid-1981 which would
require initial planning work to begin
next month.
Administration fundraisers have
told trustees in background reports
that they consider the $10 million
