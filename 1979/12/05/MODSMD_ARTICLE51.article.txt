# Sister solidarity dispels old myths
## 
### Kathleen McClung 
A new and exciting "author
ity of sisterly solidarity" is just
beginning to replace old myths
about women's possession of
power, said Associate Prof, of
Political Science Nan Keohane
in a lecture last week in Terman
Auditorium.
The concluding speaker of
the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) fall lecture
series, Keohane discussed
philosophical and historical
themes underlying the topic
"Women and Authority."
To explore this ideology and
its ramifications, Keohane cen
tered on the term "myth" as a
tool of analysis, because "myth
is a lie that teaches us the
truth," she said, paraphrasing
artist Pablo Picasso.
Her lecture outlined both
old and new myths and culmi
nated in an examination of
presently available images of
women exercising authority.
"We need to remind ourse
lves that women do exercise
authority. We must make an ef
fort to remember, but if that
fails — invent."
Ultimately, she said, "an au
thority of sisterly solidarity
based on a sense of suppor
tiveness" can develop through
viewing power as "creative and
cooperative."
Among the "new myths,"
she noted there are at least
four versions of feminist
Utopias "setting out alternative
visions where sexism is ab
sent." But, she said, these vis

ions have flaws.
"Maybe I'm being too much
a traditional political scientist,
but I'm disappointed in the
thin anarchism of these
Utopias. Very little is said about
authority, and harmony is just
taken tor granted. An effective
Utopia has got to tell us, ac
cording to logic, how potential
problems in society are resol
ved."
The "myth of the patriarch"
is foremost among the "old
myths" and is a proscriptive
one, Keohane said. She quoted
as example, ancient Creek
philosopher Sophocles' dic
tum, "A modest silence is a
woman's crown.
"This myth is crucial to au
thority, because authority in
volves speech, a central politi
cal act. Our speech has been
heard as alien, strange. Hence,
women's speech has been dis
valued."
Because of the perpetuation
of this kind of myth, she said,
women have traditionally
"exercised power obliquely.
The conjunction ot women and
authority has, in the past, been
rare. Maybe women held au
thority over children or other
women or men of inferior so
cial classes, but almost never
over men of equal position."
Some of the old myths are
still active today, Keohane
stated, but she expressed op
timism. "Many more women
are exercising authority today.
Many are pioneers, out to
create new myths."
