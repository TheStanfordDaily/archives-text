# Committees replace lawyers in China
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — China has
a few lawyers left — 200 com
pared to the more than 70,000
in California — but the typical
legal dispute is settled by a
workers' committee and not a
lawyer.
And Melvin Belli, who has
been a trial lawyer for 50 years
and recently spent several
weeks in China, says the
Chinese are doing fine.
"I talked to the dean of the
law school in Beijing," the
flamboyant San Francisco
lawyer in an interview at
his Los Angeles office. "And he
told me, We're not going to
have the private institution of
lawyers. They are the enemy of
the people."
Belli said if a factory worker
rode his bicycle recklessly and
injured a fellow worker, a

committee from the factory
would decide on a penalty for
the man. He said a similar pro
cedure would be followed in a
breach-of-contract action, di
vorce proceeding or criminal
case.
Belli said China has tew crim
inal cases because it has little
crime. If anyone stole anything
of value, he said, the neighbors
would see it and the neighbors
probably would belong to
"committees."
"Everyone belongs to a
committee there," he said.
"One committee informs on
another and that one informs
on still another."
He said lawyers were the first
group purged after the revolu
tion because it was lawyers that
held the establishment to
gether.
