# Locally made videotape looks at rape
## 
### Karen Springen 
Rape — a Societal problem
affecting everyone, both
women and men. This is the
focus of a locally produced
videotape which premiered
here Thursday.
An audience of about 250
people packed the large in
struction room of CERAS for
the 60-minute color presenta
tion of "Working Against
Rape.''
Stanford students and
alumni Laurie Foster, Allison
Brown, Sally Edwards and
Sheila Kiernan produced the
analysis of rape at Instructional
Media, a medical Center de
partment.
Between one-tenth and
one-quarter of women in the
United States will be raped
sometime in their lives, said
Foster. She regards rape as a
societal problem rather than a
random act.
The tape includes interviews
with rape victims, 50 to 60 per
cent of whom know their at
tackers. This figure includes
the forceful sex act in marriage.
The tape attacks several
myths about rape. Popular
falsehoods include: men rape
only to satisfy sexual desire;
only attractive women are at
tacked; rapes occur in dark al
leys; minority men are most
likely to rape; and women
want to be raped.
According to the videotape,
"men are socialized to feel
they're the aggressive party."
"There is pressure on a man

to be a James Bond figure,"
said one male in the videotape.
Rape can be a physical expres
sion of that feeling of inadequ
acy.
"Men sometimes feel
they're entitled to have what
they want," said one female.
"The idea that women should
be passive makes it difficult for
them to be assertive."
One victim's best friend
raped her after a five-vear
platonic relationship. "I
wanted to cut my neck. He was
really the only friend I had,"
she said. "I despised him for
betraying me, for being so self
ish. He felt that I had done
something to him."
Guilt and shame are com
mon feelings after rape, ac

cording to the videotape. Staf
fers at a rape crisis center
explained that rapists are re
sponsible for the attacks, not
the women themselves.
"Anger is a healthy emotion,
but usually one of the last," ac
cording to the film.
The clinic featured in the
tape leaves the decision of
police notification up to each
woman. "Not every woman
has the strength to go through
the whole court process. Some
victims have had to repeat their
stories at least seven times,"
one crisis center worker said.
The videotape dealt with
rape prevention measures, in
cluding suggesting that Uni
versity students travel in
groups, check in and out with

one another, and stop and
question strangers in campus
residences.
Also proposed in the tape
were rape law reforms: that the
law clearly define rape, that
witnesses not be needed, and
that rape be judged by degree.
The audience laughed dur
ing some of the victims' narra
tives. One audience member
suggested this was a nervous
release to the tense subject
matter.
The videotape will be used
by the RA orientation program
and by Rape Education Project
dorm discussions.
