# Holiday House opens doors
## 
### 
In the past, the campus has
come to a standstill during
Christmas vacation, and those
in search of holiday fun or even
food have had to venture
elsewhere.
But this year, the Bechtel In
ternational Center will become
a "Holiday House" designed to
entertain those remaining on
campus.
Bechtel Director Lee Zeigler
thought of the Holiday House
concept when he noticed that
both foreign students and
many Americans remain in the
area during the holiday season.

Often during break, no food
facilities have been available
on campus.
Holiday House (Bechtel) will
be open throughout the vaca
tion. Activities planned include
a Family Festival Day, with
ornament-making and tree
trimming, international sup
pers, silent films, a games night
and an evening of music.
Tresidder Union plans to ex
tend the Transition's hours,
staying open every day for
lunch and dinner, except on
Christmas and New Year's Day.
Holiday House also pians an

excursion to Napa Valley Wine
Country, a walking tour of San
Francisco, a three-day trip to
Monterey and a cross-country
skiing trip to Yosemite. Local
excursions include the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) and the Stanford
Museum.
Many of the events require
sign-up in advance. Bechtel
Program Coordinator Donna
Bolster and Program Adviser
Lisa Verhovek are organizing
the event. Ten staffers will as
sist them, but others are en
couraged to help.
