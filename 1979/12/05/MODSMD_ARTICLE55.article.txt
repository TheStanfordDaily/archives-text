Interested University students can travel to
Peru for a summer of archeological excava
tion or to Berlin for a newly expanded Stan
ford Program in Berlin, according to an Over
seas Studies Office announcement last week.
The Overseas Studies Office is offering a
special archeological program and is expand
ing the University program in Berlin, said
Peggy Blumenthal, assistant director of the
Overseas Studies Office.
The new archeology program, offered to
undergraduates in the summer of 1980, will
let selected students assist Anthropology
Prof. )ohn Rick at his excavation project in
high-altitude Peru. The nine-week program
will include training in archeological field
methods and instruction in Andean archeol
ogy at a Peruvian excavation site, according
to a press release issued last week.
"We'll be getting at some of the earliest
human artifacts," Rick said Friday. The pro
fessor called the excavation site "excep
tional" and said the dig could be of "major
importance in world history."
The early prehistoric cave site, which re
portedly contains artifacts spanning the
period of 10,000 B.C. to 500 A.D., was used
as a base camp for early sedentary hunters
relying on the game resources of the 14,000-
foot high "puna" grassland.
Located 100 miles northeast of Lima, stu
dents at the site will experience a harsh, cold
climate with temperatures varying from 60
degrees to 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
The high altitude and Spartan accommoda
tions demand that those selected be in good
physical shape, "but you don't have to be an
athlete," Rick noted.
Participants in the program, which starts
on June 27, 1980, will earn 15 quarter units of
credit after producing a field account of their
experience and an individual preliminary
analysis of an artifact excavated from the

four-meter deep site. Evening discussions,
visits to museums and tours of other digs are
included in the program, in addition to field
work during the day.
The goals of Prof. Rick's project include the
identification of artifacts with prehistoric liv
ing floors, recovery of spearheads, knives
and other stone tools, and of plant and ani
mal remains. Huts and burials will also be
excavated.
In a second press release, Mark Mancall,
Director of Overseas Studies, and Gerald Gil
lespie, Chairman of the German Studies De
partment announced the expansion of the
Stanford-in-Berlin program from a two
quarter to a three-quarter program, begin
ning in the fall of 1980.
The Overseas Office also announced the
opening of a new University program at the
Free University of Berlin. The program, open
to Stanford undergraduates and graduates,
offers students one or two semesters of clas
ses at the Free University.
Students electing to enroll in classes at the
Free University will also be able to take inten
cive German at the existing Stanford Progam
in Berlin and to enroll in other courses of
fered at the Stanford campus there taught by
German and American faculty.
"There's still a two-quarter program in Ber
lin," Blumenthal said Friday.
Blumenthal said the Stanford program tor
advanced undergraduates at the University
of Bonn will be temporarily phased out be
cause "budgetarilv and administratively it
made sense not to have two campuses" in
Germany. The Bonn program for graduate
students will no be affected.
Additional information concerning the
new programs in archeology and at Berlin is
available from the Stanford Overseas Studies
Department. The application deadline for the
Peru program and the new program in Berlin
is February 1.
