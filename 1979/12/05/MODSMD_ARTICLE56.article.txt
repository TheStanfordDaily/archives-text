Carter officially declares candidacy
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, formally
launching his fight for another term in the White House,
said last night the crisis with Iran that has delayed his
campaign plans "may not be resolved easily or quickly."
In a five-minute paid political broadcast on CBS televi
sion, Carter said the tate of 50 American hostages in
Tehran could hang in the balance so long that "our
patience and sense of unity may waver as frustration
builds up among us."
White House press secretary Jody Powell said the tele
vision appearance was keyed to 2800 Carter fund-raisers,
many held in private homes around the country. Had
there not been this connection, he said, the broadcast
would have been canceled.
The broadcast followed a muted declaration ot candi
dacy that Carter made yesterday afternoon in the East
Room of the White House.
At the brief East Room ceremony, Carter said he
"would have preferred to postpone this announcement
until another time." But he said election laws in some
states forced him to act now.
Promoters blamed in Who tragedy
Cincinnati — City officials said yesterday promoters ot
The Who concert delayed up to one hour in opening
doors to Riverfront Coliseum despite a police warning of
a "potential danger" posed by thousands ot waiting
fans.
City Councilman lerry Springer said the alleged delay
was "definitely a problem" Monday night when 11
people were killed and 22 were injured by a stampede ot
8000 tans. Eight persons remained hospitalized yester
day.
City Safety Director Richard Castellini said police rec
ognized the potential danger at 6:30 p.m., which he said
was about the time doors for such an event would nor
mally open. *
"Police asked the promoter to open up but he said the
group was late and that he couldn't open," Castel 11 ni
said. "He was told there were not enough tickets takers
to open more than just the north bank ot doors."
The promoters, Electric Factory Concerts, Inc. ot
Philadelphia, said they would have no immediate com
ment on the allegation about the doors. Earlier, the
promoters said in a statement that they would have no
immediate comment "due to the gravity of the inci
dent."
Court rules public defenders liable
Washington — Lawyers appointed by federal courts to
help penniless criminal defendants can be sued by those
clients for malpractice, the Supreme Court ruled yester
day.
By a unanimous vote, the justices said federal law and
past Supreme Court rulings otter no absolute shield of
immunity tor court-appointed lawyers.
The immunity enjoyed by judges, prosecutors and
other "federal officers" does not apply to court
appointed defense lawyers in federal criminal trials, )us
tice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
The court's decision overturned a ruling by the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court and revived a $5.6 million
negligence suit tiled against a Greensburg, Pa., lawyer
by a federal prisoner serving a 30-year sentence.
Francis Ferri, an inmate at the federal penitentiary in
Lewisburg, I'd., contends in his suit that his long prison
term is the fault of his court-appointed lawyer, Daniel
Ackerman.

Ackerman had argued that denying immunity to
court-appointed lawyers, who otten are paid less by the
government than they could earn in their private prac
tice, would make many lawyers unwilling to accept such
assignments.
Stevens' opinion acknowledged that preserving "a
supply ot lawyers available for this important work"
could be a problem. A solution, it needed, should come
from Congress, he said.
Kennedy defends remarks on Iran
San Francisco — Sen. Edward Kennedy, (D-Mass) after
generating a storm of protest from the Carter administ
ration over his remarks on Iran, insisted Monday he still
supports the president's handling of the Iranian crisis.
"My position is unchanged," Kennedy told reporters
when asked about his statement that the exiled Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi "ran one of the most violent
regimes in the history ot mankind."
Kennedy's comments on the shah were made Sunday
night in an interview at KRON-TV.
"Whatever the repressive aspects of the shah's re
gime," Kennedy told reporters Monday, "I don't believe
it justifies the action of the Iranian government in hold
ing the hostages and I feel that very strongly."
But on Monday he began emphasizing that "our firm
national commitment to the sate release of the hostages
does not and cannot mean that this nation must con
done the shah and the record ot his regime.
Senate panel approves death penalty
Washington — The Senate judiciary Committee ap
proved a new federal death penalty law Tuesday after
passing a sweeping revision of federal criminal laws.

mediately branded the action part of a "political deal' by
Senate judiciary Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy
(D/Mass.). A Kennedy aide denied the charge.
The death penalty measure, approved by the commit
tee on a 7-4 vote, would authorize the death sentence tor
first degree murder, treason, espionage and aircraft
hijacking in which human life is taken.
While various states have passed death penalty laws to
meet Supreme Court guidelines, the federal govern
ment has not.
The criminal code revision, which Kennedy has listed

tee on a 13-1 vote.

Court rules public defenders liable
Washington — Lawyers appointed by federal courts to
help penniless criminal defendants can be sued by those
clients for malpractice, the Supreme Court ruled yester
day.
By a unanimous vote, the justices said federal law and
past Supreme Court rulings otter no absolute shield of
immunity tor court-appointed lawyers.
The immunity enjoyed by judges, prosecutors and
other "federal officers" does not apply to court
appointed defense lawyers in federal criminal trials, )us
tice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
The court's decision overturned a ruling by the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court and revived a $5.6 million
negligence suit tiled against a Greensburg, Pa., lawyer
by a federal prisoner serving a 30-year sentence.
Francis Ferri, an inmate at the federal penitentiary in
Lewisburg, I'd., contends in his suit that his long prison
term is the fault of his court-appointed lawyer, Daniel
Ackerman.

Ackerman had argued that denying immunity to
court-appointed lawyers, who otten are paid less by the
government than they could earn in their private prac
tice, would make many lawyers unwilling to accept such
assignments.
Stevens' opinion acknowledged that preserving "a
supply ot lawyers available for this important work"
could be a problem. A solution, it needed, should come
from Congress, he said.
