Stanford women's basket
ball team started early on pad
ding its seasonal statistics
Tuesday evening as it trounced
the University of California at
Davis, 94-55. The nets were
threadbare after the contest,
which featured a dominant
performance by the Cards'
sophomore triumvirate of
Jeanne Ruark, Angie Paccione,
and Louise Smith.
Ruark again led all scorers
with 19 points and grabbed
nine rebounds. Paccione con
tributed 14 points and five
boards, and Smith responded
with 13 points and four re
bounds.
Ruark easily controlled the
key area, Paccione added some
spark to the Cards' running
game and Smith displayed sur
prising hustle and even reck
less abandon around the loose
ball.
As team leaders, they have
shown a tremendous amount
of poise on the court. In fact, it
is amazing to remember that
this is just the beginning of
their second year on the team.
Besides stabilizing their own
squad, their presence on the
floor has commanded the re
spect of their opponents.
Starter Kathy Murphy and
Debi Gore also turned in
noteworthy performances.
Murphy played her usual ag
gressive style of ball as she
grabbed four boards and
added nine points. After hav
ing an injury hamper her sea

son last year, Murphy has re
gained her poise on the court.
Core turned in perhaps her
finest performance as a Cardi
nal, scoring one bucket,
snatching four rebounds, pas
sing off seven assists and bag
ging three steals. She also di
rected the team's set offense
with sharp passing while ignit
ing the fast break with her swift
penetration to the basket.
As the team's quarterback
and quickest player, Core will
have the responsibility of mus
tering a volatile running game
for the Cards. Team quickness
and board strength could be
the two ingredients which key
a successful Stanford season.
Coach Dottie McCrea got
plenty of the latter last night as
her team out-rebounded the
Aggies, 54-32. No starter saw
action for more than half the
game. Freshmen Kim Kupterer,
Meg Metzger and Denise
McCuire came off the bench to
turn in impressive perfor
mances.
Reserves Mary Osborne, Sue
Thorns, Leigh Pederson, and
Beth Boylan also must have
given their coach a boost of
confidence with their con
tributions to the game. Os
borne played especially well,
scoring eight points and grab
bing five rebounds. Thomas
and Pederson scored three
buckets apiece and Boylan
added four caroms.
After leading 48-24 at
halftime, the Cards played

Forward Kimberly Belton (41) looks for Terry Smith (21) cutting across the middle as Wyoming's Mark
Wrapp (50) and Mike Hamilton (52) defend. Tne Belton-to-Smith combination worked to perfection last
night when, with 18 seconds to go, Belton inbounded the ball to Smith. The sophomore guard sank the
winning basket in Stanford's 54-52 triumph.
