# Women coast past Cal Poly-SLO
## 
### Richard Martinez 
In a very encouraging home
opener, the Stanford women's
basketball team scored an easy
victory over Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, 78-49, Saturday even
ing at Maples Pavilion.
It took almost nine minutes
for the Cards to prove to those
attending that they were, by
far, the superior team. Once
Stanford got rolling it was evi
dent that the Mustangs did not
belong in the same gym with
the Cards.
Midway through the first
half, the Cards opened a 19-11
lead thatwasextendedanother
10 points by the time the teams
went to the locker rooms.
In fact, if the Cards had been
as successful with their lay-ups
as they were with their outside
jumpers, Cal Poly could have
gotten a 20-minute head start
on its long trip home. Time and
time again, flawless play execu
tion of back-door patterns left
a player open for an easy layup.
At least five of those shots were
missed, however, which gave
the Mustangs a chance to stay
in the game.
The only other evident
weakness in the women's per
formance was the lack of a via
ble running game. The Card
team is a bigger, stronger,
more aggressive squad this
season but it lacks the speed
necessary to run the fast break.
Point guards Debi Core and
Denise McCuire — the in

itiators of the fast break —
were often the only players
down the floor as their front
court teammates weren't quick
enough to fill the lanes after
going for the rebound. Thus,
the point guard had to hold up
and then wait for the team to
(fet up another play. This defi
ciency could hurt the Cards
when they meet high caliber,
explosive teams.
One aspect of the women's
game that has seen drastic im
provement is its defense. The
Cards held the Mustangs to
four points in the first eight
minutes of the second half,
turning the game into a rout.
They dominated the boards
and limited their opponents to
34-percent shooting accuracy.
Jeanne Ruark had another
amazingly consistent evening,
hitting on 10 of 13 shots for 20
points. Angie Paccione, how
ever, drew more attention with
her net-rippling, long-range
bombers and acrobatic, inside
aerials, finishing with 17
points.
Runaway victories can be
beneficial for a team if the
players are aware of their op
ponents' weaknesses and con
centrate on their own personal
improvement.
Otherwise a team, overcon
fident from romping over hap
less opponents, will find itself
flat on its face when tested by a
quality ball club.

Cardinal triumph. Last night Kupferer and her mates again had an
easy time of it, defeating UC-Davis 94-55.
