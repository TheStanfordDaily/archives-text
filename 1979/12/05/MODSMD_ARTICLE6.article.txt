## Rules issued for ending sex bias in sports 
### Associated Press staff reports 
The government formally announced new
guidelines tor ending sex bias in college athletics,
including a provision that sports scholarship
money be distributed in proportion to the number
of male and femafe athletes enrolled.
The guidelines announced yesterday mean that
unless schools find new sources of income, they
may have to shift funds from expensive, all-male
football programs to provide per capita scholar
ship aid to women athletes.
For example, it 40 percent of a school's athletes
are women, female athletes must receive 40 per
cent of the money a college allots for scholarships.
The guidelines, which supersede a tentative pol
icy statement issued a year ago, immediately were
attacked by the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation. But the association's spokesman, Bill
Kramer, said no decision had been made on what
action to take.
Stanford Athletic Director, Andy Geiger, said
the new guidelines will not severely affect the Uni
versity.
"We're close to complying now," he said.
Geiger said approximately 30 percent of the
University's athletes are females and that about
that same percentage of athletic department scho
larship funds are currently reserved for women's
sports.
The government also will evaluate such specific
factors as the provision of equipment, coaching
assignments and the provision of locker rooms
and other facilities to determine if an institution is

discriminating against women athletes.
"It is important to note that HEW is not requiring
that benefits — such as locker facilities or coach
ing staffs — be identical," Patricia Roberts Harris,
secretary of health, education and welfare, told
reporters in announcing the guidelines.
"We will, however, compare programs to de
termine whether policies and practices provide
equivalent opportunities throughout men's and
women's sports programs."
The major impact of the new guidelines is likely
to be felt in college football because of the com
paratively heavy amount of scholarship money al
lotted to the sport.
The per capita spending test was proposed a
year ago by Harris' predecessor, Joseph Califano
|r., who allowed exceptions for football because
of the heavy expenses involved when compared to
such other sports as tennis.
Harris said the guidelines would "give colleges
and universities maximum flexibility in develop
ing and maintaining their athletic programs while
establishing clear standards for insuring that their
programs are free from sex discrimination."
At the same time, the new guidelines for com
pliance with a 1972 anti-discrimination statute will
eliminate the per capita spending requirement in
such areas as sports publicity, game scheduling,
equipment, practice sessions, distribution of per
diem and travel allowances, coaching assign
ments, availability of coaching, medical, and train
ing services, and such facilities as locker rooms.
Stanford Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosen/weie said the Universitv had lob

bied HEW for changes in the original set of
guidelines.
"We thought there were problems in the last set
of guidelines," he said. The original guidelines
were "too inflexible" and posed a "special problem
for high-tuition, private institutions," Rosenzweig
said, because they called for immediate com
pliance.
President Richard Lyman called former HEW
Secretary Califano after the original set of
guidelines was announced to suggest that it be
implemented in phases.
Cieiger also said the University had participated
in the dialogue about the guidelines but said its
own eltect on the change is difficult to measure.
Rosenzweig said the University still saw prob
lems with the new guidelines.
"The guidelines don't take account of the fact
that no other sport played by men or women is as
large as intercollegiate football. The number of
awards (scholarships) you need to remain com
petitive distorts the picture," he said.
The guidelines are an interpretation requested
by colleges and universities of Title IX of the 1972
Education Act, which bars sex discrimination in
federally assisted programs. Federal money gen
erally does not go to college athletic programs. But
the goverment takes the view that any institution
receiving its money cannot discriminate in any of
its programs.
The NCAA has filed a suit challenging this view
and Title IX. Thecase is before the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Denver.
