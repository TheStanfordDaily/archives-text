# Same old road showmen fail at Air Force
##

Colorado Springs — A new season, new hopes, new dreams —
but the same old nightmare.
Stanford opened its 1979-80 basketball campaign Saturday
night with a frustrating last-second 61-59 loss to Air Force, the
Cardinals' eighth consecutive loss on the road. The Cards fell
victim to the same bugaboos that plagued them for much ot last
season — shoddy ball-handling, spotty defense and poor free
throw shooting.
Their losing by only two points can be attributed to the Falcons'
inability to put the game away in the closing moments.
With 1:25 left in the game, Air Force forward Tim Harris sank
both ends of a one-and-one to put the Falcons ahead 60-56.
Stanford smartly drove back down the court and Jeff Ryan, who
was afire the entire second half, dropped a 15-footer to pull the
Cards within two.
Air Force brought the ball down and began stalling to protect
their two-point cushion. With :44 to play, Stanford's Daryle Mor
gan fouled Greg Lewis, thus giving him a one-and-one and giving
the Falcons the chance to put the game away.
Lewis missed — the second one-and-one he had missed in the
last two minutes — but the Falcons got the rebound. Morgan
fouled Lewis again seven seconds later.
The third time was a charm — for Stanford. Lewis once again
missed from the free-throw line and Kimberly Belton pulled
down the rebound. The Cards went hurriedly downcourt from
where Morgan flailed a shot from ten feet. It was wide, but the
Cards came down with the rebound.
Lewis then reciprocated to Morgan, fouling him and giving the
deadeye foul shooter a chance to even things up at 60 with : 19 left
to play.
Morgan only hit on the first, the second one bouncing to the
floor with about six of the ten men on the floor diving after it. Air
Force controlled the jump ball and had the lead and the ball. With
six seconds left, the Cards' Brian Welch fouled Tim Harris in a
last-ditch attempt at getting the ball back.
It worked. Harris hit only his first free-throw (Air Force was
3-for-7 from the line in the final 90 seconds) and the Cards had the
ball, five seconds and a chance to tie it at 61.
From underneath the Falcons' basket, Stanford had five sec
onds to get the ball through the Air Force defense to Doug
Barnes, who was waiting at the other end to take the shot that
could send the game into overtime.
Barnes, with a hand in his face, let go a 25-footer with two
seconds left. It was wide, but Morgan was underneath the basket.
He grabbed the rebound and tossed it in, but the buzzer sounded
just before he released, and the game was over.
"My players tell me it should have been good/' head coach Dick
Dißiaso said of Morgan's shot. "My own unbiased opinion was that it
was good but it doesn't matter because the game is over."
Dißiaso was also peeved over the officiating of the last five
seconds.
"I think there was goaltending (on Barnes' shot) and I think it
(Morgan's shot) was good. I think the film will show both officials
out of position. One was under the basket and the other was 13
feet away. That's all I saw. I'm not complaining about the officiat
ing. The one under the basket didn't call anything. He just looked
out at the other guy."
In the gloom of the postgame locker room, Barnes quietly tried
to explain what he thought had happened.
"I saw the shflt go up and the Air Force guy was above the rim.
Whether the shot was in the cylinder I don't know. When I let it
go I thought it was in. I couldn't tell (about goaltending) from
where I was. I just couldn't tell."
The fact remains that Stanford should never have been behind
Air Force, a steady, basic, thoroughly mediocre ball club. The
Cards had the class of the talent on the court, but just beat
themselves.
Air Force took a 29-28 lead into the locker room at halftime,
then burst out to a 39-31 lead with tive minutes gone in the second
half. The Cards had scored 10 points in the last 12:30. They soon
awoke however, thanks to Jeff Ryan. The third forward gunned
three consecutive jumpers from the left side to bring the Cards
back into the game.
As if in a duel, Air Force's Dean Christian dusted off his weapon
when Ryan got hot, popping in four in a row from no closer than
18 feet, to keep the Academy ahead at 49-45.
Stanford kept plugging away and finally got the lead with 4:45
to play, when Welch's 20-footer put them up 53-52. But Tim Harris
scored from five feet seconds later, and the Falcons were never
behind.

was good but it doesn't matter because the game is over."
Dißiaso was also peeved over the officiating of the last five
seconds.
"I think there was goaltending (on Barnes' shot) and I think it
(Morgan's shot) was good. I think the film will show both officials
out of position. One was under the basket and the other was 13
feet away. That's all I saw. I'm not complaining about the officiat
ing. The one under the basket didn't call anything. He just looked
out at the other guy."
In the gloom of the postgame locker room, Barnes quietly tried
to explain what he thought had happened.
"I saw the shflt go up and the Air Force guy was above the rim.
Whether the shot was in the cylinder I don't know. When I let it
go I thought it was in. I couldn't tell (about goaltending) from
where I was. I just couldn't tell."
The fact remains that Stanford should never have been behind
Air Force, a steady, basic, thoroughly mediocre ball club. The
Cards had the class of the talent on the court, but just beat
themselves.
Air Force took a 29-28 lead into the locker room at halftime,
then burst out to a 39-31 lead with tive minutes gone in the second
half. The Cards had scored 10 points in the last 12:30. They soon
awoke however, thanks to Jeff Ryan. The third forward gunned
three consecutive jumpers from the left side to bring the Cards
back into the game.
As if in a duel, Air Force's Dean Christian dusted off his weapon
when Ryan got hot, popping in four in a row from no closer than
18 feet, to keep the Academy ahead at 49-45.
Stanford kept plugging away and finally got the lead with 4:45
to play, when Welch's 20-footer put them up 53-52. But Tim Harris
scored from five feet seconds later, and the Falcons were never
behind.
Colorado Springs — A new season, new hopes, new dreams —
but the same old nightmare.
Stanford opened its 1979-80 basketball campaign Saturday
night with a frustrating last-second 61-59 loss to Air Force, the
Cardinals' eighth consecutive loss on the road. The Cards fell
victim to the same bugaboos that plagued them for much ot last
season — shoddy ball-handling, spotty defense and poor free
throw shooting.
Their losing by only two points can be attributed to the Falcons'
inability to put the game away in the closing moments.
With 1:25 left in the game, Air Force forward Tim Harris sank
both ends of a one-and-one to put the Falcons ahead 60-56.
Stanford smartly drove back down the court and Jeff Ryan, who
was afire the entire second half, dropped a 15-footer to pull the
Cards within two.
Air Force brought the ball down and began stalling to protect
their two-point cushion. With :44 to play, Stanford's Daryle Mor
gan fouled Greg Lewis, thus giving him a one-and-one and giving
the Falcons the chance to put the game away.
Lewis missed — the second one-and-one he had missed in the
last two minutes — but the Falcons got the rebound. Morgan
fouled Lewis again seven seconds later.
The third time was a charm — for Stanford. Lewis once again
missed from the free-throw line and Kimberly Belton pulled
down the rebound. The Cards went hurriedly downcourt from
where Morgan flailed a shot from ten feet. It was wide, but the
Cards came down with the rebound.
Lewis then reciprocated to Morgan, fouling him and giving the
deadeye foul shooter a chance to even things up at 60 with : 19 left
to play.
Morgan only hit on the first, the second one bouncing to the
floor with about six of the ten men on the floor diving after it. Air
Force controlled the jump ball and had the lead and the ball. With
six seconds left, the Cards' Brian Welch fouled Tim Harris in a
last-ditch attempt at getting the ball back.
It worked. Harris hit only his first free-throw (Air Force was
3-for-7 from the line in the final 90 seconds) and the Cards had the
ball, five seconds and a chance to tie it at 61.
From underneath the Falcons' basket, Stanford had five sec
onds to get the ball through the Air Force defense to Doug
Barnes, who was waiting at the other end to take the shot that
could send the game into overtime.
Barnes, with a hand in his face, let go a 25-footer with two
seconds left. It was wide, but Morgan was underneath the basket.
He grabbed the rebound and tossed it in, but the buzzer sounded
just before he released, and the game was over.
"My players tell me it should have been good/' head coach Dick
Dißiaso said of Morgan's shot. "My own unbiased opinion was that it
was good but it doesn't matter because the game is over."
