# Smith's basket wins it, 54-52
## 
### Chris Haft 
Alter 39 minutes of moribund basketball, Stanford's Terry
Smith applied the necessary euthanasia by sinking a four-foot
bank shot with 18 seconds left, giving the Cardinals a 54-52 victory
over Wyoming last night at Maples Pavilion.
It was a game played at a crippled, lurching pace. Occasionally
Smith, Kimberly Belton and the Cowboys' Charles Bradley gave it
shots of adrenalin with their lively antics.
Overall, however, the operation was unsuccessful. Like bumbl
ing surgeons dropping their scalpels on the floor, the men per
sisted in kicking, throwing and dropping the ball almost at ran
dom.
Fortunately, Smith ended this sporting form of malpractice.
Final hoop
After Wyoming's Bill Garnett tied the score on a short banker
with 2:07 remaining, the Cards painstakingly worked the clock
down. Then a kicking violation gave Stantord the ball out of
bounds underneath its own basket with 19 seconds to go.
As the Cards began their bumpy carousel of screens on the
inbounds play, Belton, the inbounds passer, saw Smith cutting
across the key from the left low post.
Belton passed to Smith, who wedged the ball up over a posse of
Cowboys for the winning points.
Smart adjustment
Smith, a 6-toot-4 sophomore who redshirted last year due to
suffering stress fractures in both feet, expressed surprise at
Wyoming's choice of defenses on the inbounds play.
"I thought they were going to (play) zone," Smith said. "I
started down low and nobody was guarding me. When we first
started to set up out of bounds, I saw an opening and cut to the
ball.
"I guess they were confused, and we took advantage of it,"
Smith added.
Free-throw inaccuracy
What the Cards took advantage of most was Wyoming's atroci
ous free-throw shooting. The Cowboys made just eight of 20 tries
from the charity stripe, converting just two of seven in the deci
sive second half.
Guard Tim Tucker and Bradley each missed the lirst shot of
one-and-one situations in the waning minutes with Stanford
holding leads of two and four points, respectively.
"I think we defeated ourselves rather than Stanford beating
us," Cowboy head coach Jim Brandenburg said.
Effective defense
Card head coach Dick Dißiaso preferred to dwell on Stanford's
defense, which held Wyoming to 18 second-half points.
"They had scored 190 points this past weekend," Dißiaso said
of the Cowboys, who had actually scored 193 in defeating Missis
sippi Valley State 121-62 and losing to South Dakota 73-72. "The
defense kept us in the game."
Considering individual players, Dißiaso praised Smith, who
entered the game late in the first half and sparked an ultimately
crucial effort that held Wyoming to just three points in almost five
minutes.
"Terry Smith really was the catalyst to get us going defen
sively," Dißiaso said.
Late first-half surge
Somebody had to Stanford going somehow. The Cards were
trailing 31-18 with just under five minutes left in the first half when
the emergence of Smith and a hustling Card defense generated a
14-3 streak.
The crowd of 3078, fighting boredom, came to life when Smith
blocked Mike Jackson's breakaway lay-up attempt. Smith was
called for a foul on the play, but its reverberations were to be felt
in the following moments.
Smith's perpetual motion produced points as he missed a shot,
got his own rebound, missed another shot, got that rebound and
scored.
Employing a full-court press, the Cards stole the following
inbounds pass, and Belton banged one in to cut the Cowboy lead
to 33-26.
Sophomore Brian Welch ended the half in fine fashion, swish
ing a 20-footer, alertly dishing the ball to Orlando Ward for a
lay-in and flipping in two more points on a drive down the mid
dle, pushing Stanford within 34-32. »
"I think that showed what kind of character we have," Welch
said the Cards' resurgence. "We made a lot of mistakes, but we
came back and that's what counted."
Taking the lead
The game resumed its dreary character after intermission, with
Wyoming stretching its advantage to 48-39 in the meantime.
Then, suddenly and improbably, the Cards scored 13 points in
a row. Two long-range bombs by Doug Barnes and one each by
Welch and guard Daryle Morgan tied the score.
Belton, ignoring his shortcomings at the free-throw line, sank
two shots to give the Cards their first lead of the night, 50-48, with
5:53 remaining. Another 20-footer by Welch made the score 52-48
and enabled the Cards to hold off Wyoming until the final mi
nutes.

inbounds pass, and Belton banged one in to cut the Cowboy lead
to 33-26.
Sophomore Brian Welch ended the half in fine fashion, swish
ing a 20-footer, alertly dishing the ball to Orlando Ward for a
lay-in and flipping in two more points on a drive down the mid
dle, pushing Stanford within 34-32. »
"I think that showed what kind of character we have," Welch
said the Cards' resurgence. "We made a lot of mistakes, but we
came back and that's what counted."
Taking the lead
The game resumed its dreary character after intermission, with
Wyoming stretching its advantage to 48-39 in the meantime.
Then, suddenly and improbably, the Cards scored 13 points in
a row. Two long-range bombs by Doug Barnes and one each by
Welch and guard Daryle Morgan tied the score.
Belton, ignoring his shortcomings at the free-throw line, sank
two shots to give the Cards their first lead of the night, 50-48, with
5:53 remaining. Another 20-footer by Welch made the score 52-48
and enabled the Cards to hold off Wyoming until the final mi
nutes.
Alter 39 minutes of moribund basketball, Stanford's Terry
Smith applied the necessary euthanasia by sinking a four-foot
bank shot with 18 seconds left, giving the Cardinals a 54-52 victory
over Wyoming last night at Maples Pavilion.
It was a game played at a crippled, lurching pace. Occasionally
Smith, Kimberly Belton and the Cowboys' Charles Bradley gave it
shots of adrenalin with their lively antics.
Overall, however, the operation was unsuccessful. Like bumbl
ing surgeons dropping their scalpels on the floor, the men per
sisted in kicking, throwing and dropping the ball almost at ran
dom.
Fortunately, Smith ended this sporting form of malpractice.
Final hoop
After Wyoming's Bill Garnett tied the score on a short banker
with 2:07 remaining, the Cards painstakingly worked the clock
down. Then a kicking violation gave Stantord the ball out of
bounds underneath its own basket with 19 seconds to go.
As the Cards began their bumpy carousel of screens on the
inbounds play, Belton, the inbounds passer, saw Smith cutting
across the key from the left low post.
Belton passed to Smith, who wedged the ball up over a posse of
Cowboys for the winning points.
Smart adjustment
Smith, a 6-toot-4 sophomore who redshirted last year due to
suffering stress fractures in both feet, expressed surprise at
Wyoming's choice of defenses on the inbounds play.
"I thought they were going to (play) zone," Smith said. "I
started down low and nobody was guarding me. When we first
started to set up out of bounds, I saw an opening and cut to the
ball.
"I guess they were confused, and we took advantage of it,"
Smith added.
Free-throw inaccuracy
What the Cards took advantage of most was Wyoming's atroci
ous free-throw shooting. The Cowboys made just eight of 20 tries
from the charity stripe, converting just two of seven in the deci
sive second half.
Guard Tim Tucker and Bradley each missed the lirst shot of
one-and-one situations in the waning minutes with Stanford
holding leads of two and four points, respectively.
"I think we defeated ourselves rather than Stanford beating
us," Cowboy head coach Jim Brandenburg said.
Effective defense
Card head coach Dick Dißiaso preferred to dwell on Stanford's
defense, which held Wyoming to 18 second-half points.
"They had scored 190 points this past weekend," Dißiaso said
of the Cowboys, who had actually scored 193 in defeating Missis
sippi Valley State 121-62 and losing to South Dakota 73-72. "The
defense kept us in the game."
Considering individual players, Dißiaso praised Smith, who
entered the game late in the first half and sparked an ultimately
crucial effort that held Wyoming to just three points in almost five
minutes.
"Terry Smith really was the catalyst to get us going defen
sively," Dißiaso said.
Late first-half surge
Somebody had to Stanford going somehow. The Cards were
trailing 31-18 with just under five minutes left in the first half when
the emergence of Smith and a hustling Card defense generated a
14-3 streak.
The crowd of 3078, fighting boredom, came to life when Smith
blocked Mike Jackson's breakaway lay-up attempt. Smith was
called for a foul on the play, but its reverberations were to be felt
in the following moments.
Smith's perpetual motion produced points as he missed a shot,
got his own rebound, missed another shot, got that rebound and
scored.
Employing a full-court press, the Cards stole the following
inbounds pass, and Belton banged one in to cut the Cowboy lead
to 33-26.
