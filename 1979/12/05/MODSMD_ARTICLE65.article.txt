The swimmers proved that
they are well on their way to an
outstanding season by churn
ing to lightning-quick times in
the three-day Stanford Invita
tional at deCuerre Pools over
the weekend. The AAU format
of the meet gave the Cards the
opportunity to test their skills
in many diverse events, and
they met the challenge with
gusto.
"Everyone swam great," said
men's coach Skip Kenney.
"Based upon what the kids
have said, we're way ahead of
where we were a year ago," he
judged. Unlike last year, the
Cards did not shave or rest for
this meet, but the results
evaluated training methods so
far with an A plus.
"The women were awe
some," said assistant men's
coach Stu Corliss.
Women's coach Claudia
Thomas agreed wholehear
tedly, "All in all, I'm pleased
with everyone. The team is
coming together really well,"
she asserted. Still, "it's kind of
scary when people do this well
this early," Corliss com
mented.
The men swam secondary
events and revealed them
selves adept at a wide variety of
strokes and distances. "We
wanted to swim events that we
don't in every dual meet,"
Kenney said. Thus, the men did
not even enter any relay teams

because they practice those at
each dual competition. "We
wanted to give them every
chance to get away from the
pool to study," Kenney added.
Meet action accounted for
"at least a dozen lifetime bests
and a lot of best unshaven
times," Kenney noted.
Card freshman John Simons
recorded easily the fastest col
legiate time in the nation yet
this year with a 4:03.60 run
away victory in the 400-yard in
dividual medley, according to
Corliss. Harry Freeman and
Bryant Lum notched their fas
test 100-yard butterflies with a
53.02 third-place and a 53.50
seventh respectively. Corliss
also recognized Kevin
O'Beirne and Phil Gyori for
best times.
"All the 1650s (freestyle)
were outstanding," Kenney re
lated. Co-captain Monte
Brown finished second in a
time 10 seconds faster than his
previous best unshaved. Barry
Weick won that event in grand
fashion, and Craig Spada also
excelled in that endurance
event. In fact, "Spada was like a
god in everything he swam,"
Corliss claimed.
Kenney lauded sophomore
Wade Flemons for a great meet
and an especially grueling 1650
backstroke, leff Stiling is just
regaining his form after early
season illness and injury.
University of California's Par
Arvidsson, NCAA champion

last year, lunged for an as
tounding 49.77 pool record in
the 100 fly.
The women hung most of
their competitors in the pool
gutters. All their relays scored
AIAW-national-qualifying vic
tories and red suits were defi
nitely in vogue for the final
heats. Often, Stanford or
former Stanford swimmers
took up five or six of the eight
available final positions.
Although the attainment of
meet records was precluded by
last year's performance by a
shaved and tapered Mission
Viejo team, one of the top
age-group teams nationally,
freshman Janet Buchan
nonetheless defied all odds
with a meet record, 4:20.76, in
the 400 I.M. Buchan also won
the 200 I.M. in 2:06.729 and
stroked to her best time ever in
the 500 free (4:55.855), only to
be nipped at the wall by Ladera
Oaks Aquatic Club's lane Ab
raham for first. "All of Jane's
swims were exceptional,"
Thomas said.
Sprinters Kelly Asplund and
Barbara Major ranked 1-2 in the
50 free in fleet times, 24.09 and
24.48 respectively. Thomas
singled out junior Zena
Herrmann and freshman Patty
Spees for their individual per
formances. Hermann swam
her fastest 100 free, and Spees
bobbed to her fastest 200
breaststroke.
