Ken Margerum couldn't get more awards if
he robbed a trophy store.
Margerum, ace wide receiver on Stanford's
football team, became a consensus All-
America yesterday as the Associated Press
selected Margerum on its first team. The
6-foot-1, 175-pound junior has also been
named to the dream teams of The Sporting
News, United Press International and the
Newspaper Enterprise Association, among
others.
Defensive tackle Chuck Evans was ac
corded honorable mention All-America hon
ors by AP. However, quarerback Turk
Schonert, the nation's leading passer, was
totally left off the list.
Brigham Young's Mark Wilson made the
first team, USC's Paul McDonald made the
second team and Ohio State's Art Schlichter

was named to the third team.
At least Margerum had something to be
happy about. "It's pretty wild/' he said about
being selected by AP. "I never expected
these things to happen."
The AP All-Americas will be featured on
Bob Hope's "Merry All Star Christmas Spe
cial"on NBC-TV Thursday, Dec. 13,afact that
Margerum is fully conscious of.
"It will be a thrill to meet the other guys I've
been reading and hearing about," Margerum
said.
However, the fleet flanker still has a couple
of errands to do before he heads for the tele
vision studios.
"I'll see if I can buy myself a couple of new
pairs of pants and a shirt," Margerum stated.
"I hope they don't put too much makeup
on my face," he added.
