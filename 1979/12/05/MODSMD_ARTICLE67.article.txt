Total individual effort, a good attitude, and a team spirit that
grew with the weeks made the 1979 Stanford cross country sea
sons one of the best in recent years, according to both men's
coach Dean Clark and women's mentor Laurel Treon.
Referring to the past three months of competition as a "great
season," Clark further noted, "I guess what I'm most pleased
about is the attitude and the improvement that came about. We
felt great unity and real team spirit; it's definitely more marked
this year than previously."
"There's no question that this was our most competitive year
ever," commented Treon about her squad. "Every time out we
were among the top competition," she continued.
For the men, training and mental preparation combined most
etfectively in the Pac-10 Southern Division meet at UCLA when
the runners captured first place, topping powerhouses Arizona
and UCLA en route to the victory. Previously the squad had
earned second at the Fresno Invitational, their first meet, and
third behind Cal Poly-SLO and UCLA in the Stanford Invitational.
In what would be the team finale, the Cardinals missed qualify
ing tor the NCAA Finals with a fourth place finish at the Pac-10
Championships. In this race senior Roy Kissin placed 11th to
make the finals, where he placed 61st.
"Our only disappointment was not making our goal to go the
NCAA's. We were one food poisoning case short," said Clark,
referring to team captain Rod Berry. The sophomore had placed
second at the Southern Division Championships, but his perfor
mance was hindered at the Pac-10 Finals by the case he con
tracted prior to the meet. Speculating on how far he could have
gone, Clark noted, "Berry would have been in the top 40 at
NCAA's."
One of the highlights of the women's season was the "total
team effort at the Cal Poly (Invitational) meet," according to
Treon. "It was the best team grouping; everyone was very aware
of one another in the race," she explained. The team placed
second in the meet, its best showing to date.
The season started lor the women with a fifth-place showing at
the Fresno Invitational, followed bya pairof fourth places at both
the Cal and Stanford Invitationals.
After the Cal Poly race the team garnered second at the NorCal
Championships held at the Stanford Colt Course. Freshman Kim
Schnurpfeil set the Stantord course record at 17:24.9, cutting 9.1
seconds off her time run in the Stanford Invitational.
The squad took fifth in the AIAW Regionals, two spots below
the qualifying mark tor the team, but Schnurpfeil and team cap
tain Ann Thrupp went on to the finals via 11th and 14th place
finishes. Missing Ail-American honors by one place, Schnurpfeil
snatched 16th while Thrupp ran the second-best race of her lite
for 67th.
Individually for the squads, the newcomers show promise of
continuing to lead the pack while the veterans bow out with
All-American honors. On the women's squad freshman
Schnurpfeil is expected to improve her already impressive times
while Ann Thrupp leaves the intercollegiate circuit with three
All-American honors.
In a final retrospect, Clark stated, "I'm extremely proud and
enthusiastic. I couldn't have worked with a finer group of voung
men." Stressing the great strides her team made during the
season Treon pointed out, "The team made great gains, the
attitude was excellent, and the team gained a great sense of
identity through it all."
