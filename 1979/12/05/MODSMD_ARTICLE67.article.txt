Total individual effort, a good attitude, and a team spirit that
grew with the weeks made the 1979 Stanford cross country sea
sons one of the best in recent years, according to both men's
coach Dean Clark and women's mentor Laurel Treon.
Referring to the past three months of competition as a "great
season," Clark further noted, "I guess what I'm most pleased
about is the attitude and the improvement that came about. We

NCAA's."
One of the highlights of the women's season was the "total
team effort at the Cal Poly (Invitational) meet," according to
Treon. "It was the best team grouping; everyone was very aware
