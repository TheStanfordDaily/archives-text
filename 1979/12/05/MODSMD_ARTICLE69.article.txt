# Women's tennis manager
## 
### 
The women's tennis team needs a manager for the 1980
season. Males or females may apply. The manager gains two
units of credit and free admission to all home matches, though
he or she won't be able to travel with the team free due to
increased travel costs. Once in a while the manager may be
able to participate in practice. For more details call coach
Frank Brennan at 497-1160.
