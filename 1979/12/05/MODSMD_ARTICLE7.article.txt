## Debate on civilian or military jurisdiction South Korea suspends assassination trial 
### 
Seoul, South Korea (AP) â€”
The trial of the former chief of
the Korean Central Intelli
gence Agency (KCIA) and
seven others charged in con
nection with the assassination
of President Park Chung-hee
opened yesterday and then
was quickly suspended.
The presiding officer of the
military court, Lt. Gen. Kim
Yung-sun, suspended the trial
pending a ruling by the Sup
reme Court on whether the ac
cused should be tried by a civi

lian or army court.
After the indictment was
read, defense attorney Kim
Chong-doo objected to the
court martial, arguing the
former intelligence chief, Kim
Jae-kyu, was a civilian and the
killing of Park and five of his
bodyguards Oct. 26 occurred
the day before martial law was
imposed because of the assas
sination.
Murder charged
Kim Jae-kyu is charged with
murdering Park at a dinner

party in an attempted coup.
Five Korean CIA agents and
former presidential secretary
Kim Kae-won also are charged
with murder. All could be sen
tenced to death.
Acting President Choi Kyu
hah meanwhile accepted a
draft to be a candidate in to
morrow's election of Park's
successor. Choi, 60, a career
diplomat who was premier
under Park, is expected to be
the only candidate before the
2560-member electoral col

lege. He will need a simple
majority of 1281 votes to win.
Park, South Korea's
strongman leader for 18 years,
was killed along with five
bodyguards.
20 lawyers
Informed sources said 20
civilian lawyers, most of whom
defended leading dissident fi
gures at the Samil manifesto
trial in 1976, will defend Kim
Jae-kyu and the others.
At the Samil trial, 33 dissi
dents including former Presi
dent Vun Po-sun and presiden
tial candidate Kim Dae-jung
were convicted of violating a
martial law emergency decree
by circulating the manifesto.
The document demanded Park
resign and democratic reforms
be instituted.
The emergency decree bans
virtually all political dissent and
has been the chief target of
Park's opponents. The Na
tional Assembly unanimously
recommended last Saturday
that Choi lift the decree, and
he is expected to do so quickly
if he becomes president.
