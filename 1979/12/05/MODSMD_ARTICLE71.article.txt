### Dean Eyre 
Sadao Hamada, Stanford's
men's gymnastics coach, is get
ling a sneak preview ol his
team's potential in preparation
for the Pacific-10 competition
which begins lanuary 12.
To toretell such futures in
gymnastics, Hamada relies on
inter-squad and invitational
meets rather than crystal balls
and tea leaves.
Based on the Cardinals' per
lormance in last weekend's
Sacramento Invitational, the
Pac-10 future is promising.
Competition in the capital city
featured individuals represent- 1
ing the teams at San )ose State,
Chico State, Sacramento State,
(California), UC-Davis, Diablo
Valley College and Sonoma
State.
Sophomore Mike Lee led the
Card efforts with a second
place finish in all-around com
petition with a score ot 50.15,
"almost a career high," accord
ing to Hamada.
Lee's strong showing in the
preseason meet came on a
third on pommel horse (pre
liminary score 7.6, final 8.35),
third on rings (8.45, 8.15), third
in vaulting, second on high bar
(8.65, 8.55) and second on

parallel bars (7.90, 7.90).
Rich Rosen placed third in all
around with a 47.05 total, and
earned fourth on rings (8.10,
8.40) and third on bar (8.35,
8.75).
Other top individual show
ings included a third-place
linish in floor exercise by Bob
Maganini (8.55, 8.35) and Craig
Goldman's top honors in rings
competition with scores ol 9.05
and 8.70.
Although he is still sending
individuals to other meets to
evaluate "what shape they're
in and what level 10l competi
tion) they're at," Hamada pre
dicted a league tinish between
third and sixth.
"Oregon and UCLA should
be pretty tough," Hamada
said. After that, it's a horse race
between Arizona State, USC,
Cal and Stantord.
"We came so close to the top
colleges last year," Hamada
said, "and our depth has im
proved since last year." Evi
dence of the improvement in
the program can be seen in the
team schedule, which includes
a match-up with Michigan and i
UCLA in the home opener at
Maples Pavilion lanuary 12 at
7:30 p.m.
