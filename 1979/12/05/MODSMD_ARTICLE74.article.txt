## Dracula's new and ugly face 
### 
While the phallic signifi
cance of two long white teeth
sinking intoan even longerand
whiter Victorian neck is debat
able, there has never been any
question of Count Dracula's
powers of seduction. From
Bela Lugosi to Frank Langella,
Dracula on screen has always
been the great sexual predator,
whose fatal attractiveness sets
him above and below the
Christian world outside his cas
tle walls; it is both the source
of his great strength and the
symptom of his weakness.
What, then, should we make
of the central character in
Werner Herzog's Nosferatu,
the Vampyrel Bald, bubble
headed, and altogether un
pleasant to look at, with fangs
in front rather than on the
sides, Klaus Kinski is an almost
anti-sexual vampire; this guy
would have had problems
charming the Bronte sisters.
This conception of the vam
pire is what sets Herzog's film
apart from both the
mainstream of Dracula flicks
and from F.W. Murnau's 1922
silent classic, Nosferatu, a
Symphony of Horrors, on
which it is ostensibly based.
The original Nosferatu was,
like all the rest, a straight
ahead horror story with sexual
overtones; it suffered from all
the limitations that that genre
imposes. Herzog has bor
rowed the name and look of
the older film to fashion an
exercise in psychology and
philosophy which, inevitably,
is hampered even more by the
chosen genre.
The story is quite different
from the one Bram Stoker
"edited'' nearly 1(K) years ago.
The coast of England has be
come the coast of the Nether
lands, where Lucy Harker
(Isabelle Adjani) tries to dis
suade her freshly-wed hus
band lonathan (Bruno Canz)
from making a business trip to
Transylvania. He is being sent
by his employer, Renfield, who

is played with strange, man
iacal glee by Roland Topor. Re
nfield is later seen in the town
insane asylum, eating flies and
proclaiming the approach of
his master. Dracula dispatches
him to Riga, his mission — to
spread the Black Death.
The plague hangs over the
last half of Herzog's film like a
mushroom cloud, over
shadowing all individual con
cerns. Dracula brings havoc
not only to the lives of
lonathan and Lucy Harker, but
to the entire city of Wismar.
The 50 black coffins in the
ghost ship's hold carry
thousands of rats; shots of the
rats overrunningthe wharf, the
town square, the very houses
are the film's dominant im
ages.
Nosferatu is a scary movie
only because of these rats.
They represent the evil that re
sults when the primitive, sen
sual base of man's soul, which
Herzog celebrates, runs ram
pant in a weak character such
as the Count's. The residents
have denied their passions by
subscribing to either supersti
tion or empty positivism. Dr.
Van Helsing, a town leader,
does not believe in vampires;
he tells Lucy that her fears are
groundless, that there is "a sci

entific explanation for every
thing."
Lucy is the only character
capable of taking on the
Count. She believes in demons
and doesn't pretend that the
"dark side of the soul" doesn't
exist; and she possesses the
necessary purity of heart to
hold her passions in check.
The dark impulses rep
resented by Dracula and his
rats are, basically, sexual. Lucy
is, despite her religiousness,
desirable in a very real way;
and the count, loveless be
cause of his repulsive appear
ance, longs for death as a re
lease from desire. His defeat at
the hands (and legs) of Lucy is a
triumph of sex in the light of
day over sex in the darkness of
the mind.
Herzog has tried here to
create instant myth, attaching
cultural significance to pop
phenomena. Despite lovely
cinematography, especially
the location shooting in the
Carpathian mountains, and the
even lovelier presence of
Isabelle Adjani, this
the sad fate of its own German
seriousness. It is, finally, more
pompous and slow-moving
than the philosophy which it
attacks.

Klaus Kinski plays a less than beautiful Count Dracula in Nosferatu, the Vampyre.
