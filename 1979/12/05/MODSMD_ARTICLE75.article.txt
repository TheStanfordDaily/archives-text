# The 						Rose is a hollow, wilting flower

### 
It must have occurred to
someone somewhere along
the way that The Rose was re
ally just another remake of the
oft-used Star is Born material,
and that the script's vague fic
tionalization of Janis Joplin's
life was so tenuous that it
probably wasn't worth keep
ing. Then again, the kind of
people who make movies like
this gutless monument to cyni
cism usually don't let such
things bother them.
The Rose rings false at its
core; in fact, it's hollow. The
1969 setting that the movie
clothes itself in makes little
sense. The movie makes only
three bare references to the
'60s, the most substantial of
which is the "69 tour" logo im
printed on The Rose's (Bette
Midler) touring plane. Without
these, you'd probably just as
sume that the movie was set in
the present, especially since
brand-new limousines and
musical instruments are used.
The music is more aptly de
scribed as frenetic show tunes
with bass and drums than as
Janis Joplin's brand of blues
and rock (or indeed any other
"hard rock" form played in the
late '60s). I really don't know
why Hollywood insists on in
cluding large horn sections in
depicting "stripped-down"
rock; it might have something
to do with the fact that many of
the people in charge of the
movie have backgrounds in old
film musicals and not in rock.
Beyond that, some of the
music is also inauthentic in that
it was written after 1969.
Even when these two pre
tensions are cut away, the
movie doesn't stand up. Al
though the Star is Born-type
downhill slide is more lurid
than ever here, the point is still
the same — success kills, via
booze, drugs and above all,
loneliness. The totally false in
sinuation here is that rock
music kills — that the kind of
life the music talks about is
suicidal.

Rock music doesn't kill;
what blows you away is the ac
couterments of rock — the
things that money can get you.
But you do have a choice
(Bruce Springsteen, who
drinks nothing stronger than
beer and has never touched
hard drugs is an easy example)
but this spineless crap isn't
about choice or even trying to
deal with moral and emotional
decay — it's just like all the
poorly made Star movies, it's
about reveling in someone's
disintegration.
Not too surprisingly, against
this background, the perfor
mances manage to be a little
more complex. Director Mark
Rydell lets his actors go, and
the personal interactions bet
ween characters are the best
things here.
Frederic Forrest, who piays
Midler's down-home lover,
exudes a deceptive intensity;

he gets at you when you're
barely even paying attention to
him. Though equally capable
as Chef in Apocalypse Now,
Forrest hasn't quite found the
right role — one where his style
can begin to carry a movie.
In a nicely off-beat role, Alan
Bates plays a ha-xl-ass manager
figure. As Bates' character gets
more and more evil, the less
able Bates is in maintaining
your interest, despite his usu
ally fine-tuned characteriza
tion.
Bette Midler's performance
has drawn a wide variety of
raves; while there's much to be
said for it there's an element of
cool calculation involved in it,
and that's a severe dampener.
Despite Midler's endless pos
ing and excellent cinematog
raphy by Vilmos Zsigmona and
others, Midler doesn't let go in
the early music sequences. She
is, in the end, acting like a rock
star. Only later does she com

pletely lose herself in the role,
and by that time, the movie's
credibility is in general close to
nil.
The Forrest-Midler scenes
have a street-wise, hip energy
that's infectious, and Midler
plays a spaced-out sequence
toward the end that offers a
faint indication of what this
movie might have been.
Yet for all of quality perfor
mances; The Rose fundamen
tally is a whore of a movie; it
takes with a cold cynicism and
delivers with a clinical hard
ness.
Whatever its intentions, The
Rose certainly isn't about Janis
Joplin, and Midler's stirring,
howling last song only makes
the difference between the
two more stark. Janis Joplin
played her guts out night after
night but the buck-chasers
who made this movie wouldn't
understand that. They don't
have any guts.

Bette Midler tries not too successfully to imitate the career of Janis Joplan in The Rose.
