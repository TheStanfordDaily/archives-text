# Toth and his orchestra finish strong
## 
### 
Less than one month after
their last concert, the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra pre
sented another major perfor
mance last Sunday in Din
kelspiel Auditorium. Under
the direction of their distin
guished and ambitious con
ductor Andor Toth, the or
chestra performed confidently
from the works of Ralph Vau
ghan Williams, Beethoven,
Debussy and Richard Strauss.
The program opened with
Vaughan Williams' renowned
work for solo string quartet
and double string orchestra,
the Fantasia on a Theme by
Thomas Tallis. The piece, re
ligious in nature, was realized
with justice to its pastoral and
pensive qualities. The intelli
gence with which the sym
phony approached this in
teresting selection was re
flected in their unique in
terpretation; they performed
the Fantasia with an air of both
introspection, introversion
and inspiration.
The work as a whole is ex
traordinarily rich in melody
and lyrical sonority, (omplex in
rhythm and harmony, and an
tiphonal in terms of structure.
The rushing, fluid nature of the
Fantasia is reminiscent of
Smetana's "The Moldau," and
equally as moving.

The concertmaster, Fred
Yen, and the principal violist
exchanged solo passages with
a feeling of rubato. Quick
changes of mood and in
strumentation were executed
with precision, and the
melodic swells and areas of
musical daylight were ob
served with heartfelt convic
tion on the parts of the musi
cians. Aside from a few shaky
spots hardly even worthy of
mention, the Fantasia was
given a highly achieved and
both emotionally and intellec
tually satisfying performance.
Pianist Nicholas Isaacs, win
ner of the First Annual Student
Soloist Award joined the or
chestra in Beethoven's Con
certo No. 2 in B Flat Major,
Opus 19, a work not quite as
celebrated as the other Beeth
oven Concerti, nonetheless
one of great merit.
The Allegro con brio
opened with a tutti passage
with commendable work by
the oboe and flute. Isaacs' first
solo introduced his style which
was not to waver throughout
the concerto. His perfectly
executed runs and utter com
mand of the technical aspects
of the piece at the expense of
its emotional aspects hurt the
performance as a whole.
Although Isaacs is most defi

nitely a capable and proficient
pianist as well as an inventive
one having written his own
cadenzas for the concerto, he
emerged with a detached, un
derstated and mechanistic im
age.
The Adagio was given a solid
and consistent performance,
however, it lacked personal in
terpretation and sufficient
change in attitude from the
first movement. The
heightened pace of the Rondo:
Molto Allegro was not accom
panied by a heightened emo
tional level on the part of the
soloist, despite the intense
undercurrents propelled by
the orchestral accompani
ment.
The concert resumed after
the intermission with the Pre
lude a I'Apres-Midi d'un Faune
by Debussy, a piece which
epitomizes what is called mus
ical impressionism. The fam
ous flute solo was well exe
cuted and the work of the
woodwind section in general
was outstanding with the ex
ception of one untimely
squeak of the clarinet which
broke the smooth-as-glass am
bience of the Prelude.
The embellishment pro
vided by the two harps, the
clarity of the strings and the
distant-sounding French horns

all contributed to the soothing
effect of the piece. Peter Jatte,
assistant conductor ot the
Stanford Symphony should be
complimented for the fine
work he did with the orchestra
on this selection.
The finale of the program
was a finale in every sense of
the word. The full orchestra
unleashed their talents and
energies in Strauss' Till
Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks.
As far as pranks go, the or
chestra had a few of its own —
largely in the form of miscalcu
lations in the way of counting
measures. But outside these
flaws which were few and far
between, the Strauss was per
formed with vigor and en
thusiasm.
Each section had noteworthy
strong points, but the brass
outshined them all with its
tremendous brilliance and ab
solutely thunderous power.
The woodwinds were crisp and
accurate; the bassoons
merged nicely with versatility
to the multitudinous changes
of mood throughout this tech
nically demanding piece. The
percussion section stayed on
top of the movement and pro
vided a great deal of excite
ment and drama.

chestra had a few of its own —
largely in the form of miscalcu
lations in the way of counting
measures. But outside these
flaws which were few and far
between, the Strauss was per
formed with vigor and en
thusiasm.
Each section had noteworthy
strong points, but the brass
outshined them all with its
tremendous brilliance and ab
solutely thunderous power.
The woodwinds were crisp and
accurate; the bassoons
merged nicely with versatility
to the multitudinous changes
of mood throughout this tech
nically demanding piece. The
percussion section stayed on
top of the movement and pro
vided a great deal of excite
ment and drama.

Less than one month after
their last concert, the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra pre
sented another major perfor
mance last Sunday in Din
kelspiel Auditorium. Under
the direction of their distin
guished and ambitious con
ductor Andor Toth, the or
chestra performed confidently
from the works of Ralph Vau
ghan Williams, Beethoven,
Debussy and Richard Strauss.
The program opened with
Vaughan Williams' renowned
work for solo string quartet
and double string orchestra,
the Fantasia on a Theme by
Thomas Tallis. The piece, re
ligious in nature, was realized
with justice to its pastoral and
pensive qualities. The intelli
gence with which the sym
phony approached this in
teresting selection was re
flected in their unique in
terpretation; they performed
the Fantasia with an air of both
introspection, introversion
and inspiration.
The work as a whole is ex
traordinarily rich in melody
and lyrical sonority, (omplex in
rhythm and harmony, and an
tiphonal in terms of structure.
The rushing, fluid nature of the
Fantasia is reminiscent of
Smetana's "The Moldau," and
equally as moving.

The concertmaster, Fred
Yen, and the principal violist
exchanged solo passages with
a feeling of rubato. Quick
changes of mood and in
strumentation were executed
with precision, and the
melodic swells and areas of
musical daylight were ob
served with heartfelt convic
tion on the parts of the musi
cians. Aside from a few shaky
spots hardly even worthy of
mention, the Fantasia was
given a highly achieved and
both emotionally and intellec
tually satisfying performance.
Pianist Nicholas Isaacs, win
ner of the First Annual Student
Soloist Award joined the or
chestra in Beethoven's Con
certo No. 2 in B Flat Major,
Opus 19, a work not quite as
celebrated as the other Beeth
oven Concerti, nonetheless
one of great merit.
The Allegro con brio
opened with a tutti passage
with commendable work by
the oboe and flute. Isaacs' first
solo introduced his style which
was not to waver throughout
the concerto. His perfectly
executed runs and utter com
mand of the technical aspects
of the piece at the expense of
its emotional aspects hurt the
performance as a whole.
Although Isaacs is most defi

nitely a capable and proficient
pianist as well as an inventive
one having written his own
cadenzas for the concerto, he
emerged with a detached, un
derstated and mechanistic im
age.
The Adagio was given a solid
and consistent performance,
however, it lacked personal in
terpretation and sufficient
change in attitude from the
first movement. The
heightened pace of the Rondo:
Molto Allegro was not accom
panied by a heightened emo
tional level on the part of the
soloist, despite the intense
undercurrents propelled by
the orchestral accompani
ment.
The concert resumed after
the intermission with the Pre
lude a I'Apres-Midi d'un Faune
by Debussy, a piece which
epitomizes what is called mus
ical impressionism. The fam
ous flute solo was well exe
cuted and the work of the
woodwind section in general
was outstanding with the ex
ception of one untimely
squeak of the clarinet which
broke the smooth-as-glass am
bience of the Prelude.
The embellishment pro
vided by the two harps, the
clarity of the strings and the
distant-sounding French horns

all contributed to the soothing
effect of the piece. Peter Jatte,
assistant conductor ot the
Stanford Symphony should be
complimented for the fine
work he did with the orchestra
on this selection.
The finale of the program
was a finale in every sense of
the word. The full orchestra
unleashed their talents and
energies in Strauss' Till
Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks.
As far as pranks go, the or
chestra had a few of its own —
largely in the form of miscalcu
lations in the way of counting
measures. But outside these
flaws which were few and far
between, the Strauss was per
formed with vigor and en
