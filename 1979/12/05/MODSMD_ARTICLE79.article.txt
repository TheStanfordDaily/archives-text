# Polo Alto Arsenic a local treat
## 
### 
Every year A.C.T. drags Hay
Fever out of repertory, and
every year the reviewers sing
loud hosannas in praise of the
old lolks," the actors who
portray the older generation of
loonies in Coward's English
country house. Well, the Palo
Alto Players have their own set
ot old folks, inhabitinga Brook
lyn row house, and they do a
very nice job of carrying a play
all by themselves, too.
The Players' 1979-80 seasons
opened last Friday with the first
performance of Arsenic and
Old Lace (through Dec. 15).
This is their 49th consecutive
season; they claim to be the
oldest continuously-running
municipally-funded theater
group in the country. Last Fri
day's production found them
still young at heart, though a
bit creaky in the joints.
The city of Palo Alto has al
ways been known for its sup
port of local arts, and this was
evident before the play began.
Not a play that can soar on
ideas alone, Arsenic and Old
Lace demands authenticity. Set
designer Donald Cate did an
excellent job with his World
War II home-front interior; he
obviously had plenty of money
to work with.
this meticulousness carried
through to the costumes and
props; everything was, as far as
our generation can tell, just
right. And since a fair share of
the audience were familiar
with the play's time period, I
assume things were on the
level.
Volunteer labor can do
much for the look of a show;
volunteer actors are another
matter. The greatest problem
facing any community theater
is the search for reasonably
competent performers willing
to donate the time necessary to
a major production. And the
Players are plagued with their
fair share of enthusiastic, but
untalented, tyros.
What saves Arsenic and Old
Lace is the age of the centr'al

characters. While I hesitate to
say that older performers have
more time and experience to
donate to community theater, I
don't think that that is too hor
rible a generalization to make.
In any case, Edna Macafee,
Grace Webster and Wayne
Witthaus are what make this
play worth seeing.
Macafee and Webster are,
respectively, Aunt Abby and
Aunt Martha Brewster; Witth
aus, who really does look like
Roosevelt, is their nephew
Teddy. The story is so well
known as not to bear detailing
here. Macafee and Webster
have a wonderful time being,
one teels, themselves; a little
simpler, perhaps, but very real.
The rest of the cast, with the
exception of Jerry Fox as Dr.
Einstein, either get lost in the
hectic pace or stand out be
cause of their amateur stand
ing.' The unconvincing Irish
brogues and Brooklyn accents
soon begin to grate. One great

problem is that the entire cast
appears to have seen the movie
version together. Rand Earl, as
Mortimer, does a very pedest
rian Cary Grant imitation; Jerry
Fox stands out mainly because
he does a good Peter Lorre.
The opening performance
was also plagued with en
thusiasm; people tripped,
slipped and fell over chairs in
their hurry to be great actors.
In one memorable scene, it
took five matches for
Jonathan and Dr. Einstein to
light two candles. They were
given an ovation when the feat
was finally accomplished.
Given the price and the pro
ximity to campus, though, the
Palo Alto Players make a nice
evening out. Pretend you're
seeing your high school play;
all the actors seem like people
you used to know. And a few of
them could do very well out
side of Palo Alto if they were
less than happy there.

competent performers willing
to donate the time necessary to
a major production. And the
Players are plagued with their
fair share of enthusiastic, but
untalented, tyros.
What saves Arsenic and Old
Lace is the age of the centr'al

characters. While I hesitate to
say that older performers have
more time and experience to
donate to community theater, I
don't think that that is too hor
rible a generalization to make.
In any case, Edna Macafee,
Grace Webster and Wayne
Witthaus are what make this
play worth seeing.
Macafee and Webster are,
respectively, Aunt Abby and
Aunt Martha Brewster; Witth
aus, who really does look like
Roosevelt, is their nephew
Teddy. The story is so well
known as not to bear detailing
here. Macafee and Webster
have a wonderful time being,
one teels, themselves; a little
simpler, perhaps, but very real.
The rest of the cast, with the
exception of Jerry Fox as Dr.
Einstein, either get lost in the
hectic pace or stand out be
cause of their amateur stand
ing.' The unconvincing Irish
brogues and Brooklyn accents
soon begin to grate. One great

problem is that the entire cast
appears to have seen the movie
version together. Rand Earl, as
Mortimer, does a very pedest
rian Cary Grant imitation; Jerry
Fox stands out mainly because
he does a good Peter Lorre.
The opening performance
was also plagued with en
thusiasm; people tripped,
slipped and fell over chairs in
their hurry to be great actors.
In one memorable scene, it
took five matches for
Jonathan and Dr. Einstein to
light two candles. They were
given an ovation when the feat
was finally accomplished.
Given the price and the pro
ximity to campus, though, the
Palo Alto Players make a nice
evening out. Pretend you're
seeing your high school play;
all the actors seem like people
you used to know. And a few of
them could do very well out
side of Palo Alto if they were
less than happy there.
