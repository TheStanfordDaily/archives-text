# U.S. may sever Libya ties
## 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Car
ter administration is reviewing
U.S. ties with Libya and is con
sidering options that include
severing relations because of a
mob attack on the American
Embassy in Tripoli, officials
said Monday.
The embassy attack Sunday
was the latest in a number of
violent incidents in Islamic
countries and involved a mob
proclaiming solidarity with Ira
nians who are holding 50
American hostages in Tehran.
The Libyan government has
offered "profuse apologies"
for the attack and has in
creased the guard there, but
the response to a U.S. protest
was inadequate, State Depart
ment officials said today.
"We will be satisfied only
when we have satisfactory as
surances for the security both
of our embassy and our people
in Libya," department
spokesman David Passage
said.
State Department spokes
man Hodding Carter said the
administration is conducting a
"general review" of relations
with Libya, and he also
criticized the Libyan govern
ment's response to Sunday's
mob attack as "inadequate."
The spokesman would not
specify what steps might be
taken in the review of U.S. rela
tions with Libya, beyond say
ing that a "full range of op
tions" existed.
Sever relations?
Officials, speaking privately,
confirmed that the administra

tion might break relations en
tirely if Libya failed to accept
responsibility and offer com
pensation, as Pakistani officials
did after the burning of the
embassy in Islamabad.
Fourteen embassy depen
dents left Libya yesterday,
some flying to Paris and the
others to Rome.
Libya's response came from
Ali Turayki, the foreign minis
ter, to charge d'atfaires Wil
liam Eagleton, the top U.S. dip
lomat in Libya.
But the State Department
wants Libya's leader, Col.
Moammar Khadafy, to acknow
ledge the attack as a way of
reassuring that the Libyan
people understand the em
bassy is not to be a target ot
violent demonstrations.
'Quiet chanting'
Eagleton's wife said about a
dozen staff members were
working in the Tripoli embassy
at midmorning Sunday when a
group of demonstrators ar
rived "quietly chanting."
She said the staff "im
mediately locked up," and
several male officials went to
the Green Square, a central
plaza several blocks away,
where they "saw a large mob.
They got back to the embassy
and within five minutes the
mobs arrived."
Consul Vincent Principe said
the Libyans began "banging on
the door and made it known to
us they wanted to get inside.
We just thought it prudent to
leave."
The Americans fled through

a back door and took refuge in
their homes.
Only one Libyan policeman
was on duty in front of the em
bassy at the time, and Libyan
officials ignored appeals from
the embassy for reinforce
ments, the State Department
said in Washington. The em
bassy's Marine guard was
withdrawn from Tripoli some
time ago at the request of the
Libyan government, the de
partment said.
The State Department said
the mob apparently used two
by-fours to break through the
front door while some ot the
demonstrators climbed up to a
second-floor balcony.
LAN A, the official Libyan
news agency, said the mob
burned an American flag and
effigies of President Carter and
the deposed shah ot Iran. U.S.
officials said there was serious
tire damage to the consular
section on the tirst floor and
damage also on the second
Moor.
