# Uncle Sam and John's Bull
## 
### 
Uncle Sam wants you! Travel
to foreign shores, learn a trade,
keep America strong. Be a man
in the Marine Corps. If the Pen
tagon really knew what it was
doing, it would scrap all those
recruitment pitches, old and
new, and show every young
American male an uncut print
of Yanks. Preferably just after
said males have been frus
trated in some way by young
American females. Yanks
shows American soldiers being
made into men in ways they
never dreamed of when they
enlisted.
Yanks manages, with a small
amount of tasteful nudity and
no significant violence, to be a
very offensive film. On the sur
face, it's a story of love, both
young and old (meaning
"didn't know any better" and
"should have known better")
forming in the crucible of war
and strange surroundings.
Underneath, it's a shallow, jin
goistic, male chauvinistic
propaganda piece for Ameri
can men; the essence of its two
and one-half hours was stated
much more economically
when )ohn Travolta beat the
Puerto Rican disco dancers in
Saturday Night Fever.
Director John Schlesinger,
of Sunday, Bloody Sunday
fame, still has only one
strength — he brings his British
mid-lands locations to the sc
reen very well. All human in
terest gets lost in the scenery,

however. At least Yanks isn't
burdened with the topicality
and social significance that
make Sunday, Bloody Sunday
virtually impossible to sit
through now.
Yanks, in fact, has no detect
able significance whatever. As
the film opens, truckloads of
American troops roll into a
small British town. Women and
old men (there are no British
males between the ages of 15
and 35 out of uniform in the
entire film) line the streets. The
women cheer wildly, and their
happiness has nothing to do
with the fact that these boys are
making the world safe for
democracy.
As the film ends, the
truckloads roll out again, head
ing for the trains that wait to
carry the boys to war. British
women mob the train station,
tearing their hair and beating
their breasts. The boys seem
easily resigned to their fate;
either it hasn't occurred to
them that they are about to go
to war, or perhaps war doesn't
seem like such a bad alterna
tive.
Ten hours between these
two scenes are an extended
proof of the proposition:
American men make better
lovers. There aren't many
British men around, of course;
but as the cream of British
maidenhood falls, quickly, one

by one, the impression is built
up that the same thing would
have happened had Groucho
Marx been set loose in a Royal
Army bivouac in the 1880s.
A number of good actors are
wasted during this process,
primarily Vanessa Redgrave
and William DeVane. Red
grave, as befits her years and
manner, is allowed to hold out
through two-thirds of the film;
she spends most of her time
quietly saying no to DeVane
and comforting her son, a deli
cate, picked-upon child who
seems to represent the current
state of British manhood. De-
Vane is forced to grunt and
show his teeth quite a bit to
generate interest; his charac
ter otherwise possesses none.
Richard Cere fares slightly
better. At least his target (Lisa
Eichhorn) is younger and pret
tier than Redgrave; and she
gives in quite a bit easier, too.
But Gere has to play the film's
most painfully ridiculous
scene; when he finally gets his
chosen one into bed, after a
heavy investment in candy and
stockings, he becomes impo
tent at the crucial moment. We
are asked to believe that this is
caused by his shame at what he
is doing to the poor girl. She,
meanwhile, begs him to con
tinue. I would rather believe
that he has finally realized that
this may be the last woman
he'll ever go to bed with.
On top of all its prejudices
and sticky sweetness, Yanks is
quite boring. The only really
good scene is a dance-hall fight
between white and black
American soldiers; it's com
pletely irrelevant, but exciting.
I just wish the lovers were as
nasty as those brawlers in the
dance-hall; at least then this
mess would be believable, if
no more redeemable.

Vane is forced to grunt and
show his teeth quite a bit to
generate interest; his charac
ter otherwise possesses none.
Richard Cere fares slightly
better. At least his target (Lisa
Eichhorn) is younger and pret
tier than Redgrave; and she
gives in quite a bit easier, too.
But Gere has to play the film's
most painfully ridiculous
scene; when he finally gets his
chosen one into bed, after a
heavy investment in candy and
stockings, he becomes impo
tent at the crucial moment. We
are asked to believe that this is
caused by his shame at what he
is doing to the poor girl. She,
meanwhile, begs him to con
tinue. I would rather believe
that he has finally realized that
this may be the last woman
he'll ever go to bed with.
On top of all its prejudices
and sticky sweetness, Yanks is
quite boring. The only really
good scene is a dance-hall fight
between white and black
American soldiers; it's com
pletely irrelevant, but exciting.
I just wish the lovers were as
nasty as those brawlers in the
dance-hall; at least then this
mess would be believable, if
no more redeemable.

A Christmas Carol
Tammy Xarpenko as Little Fan and Patrick O'Brien as Boy Scrouge
appear in A.C.T.'s production of Charles Dickens' immortal A
Christmas Carol. The show opens this week at the Geary Theatre and
runs through the Christmas season.
Uncle Sam wants you! Travel
to foreign shores, learn a trade,
keep America strong. Be a man
in the Marine Corps. If the Pen
tagon really knew what it was
doing, it would scrap all those
recruitment pitches, old and
new, and show every young
American male an uncut print
of Yanks. Preferably just after
said males have been frus
trated in some way by young
American females. Yanks
shows American soldiers being
made into men in ways they
never dreamed of when they
enlisted.
Yanks manages, with a small
amount of tasteful nudity and
no significant violence, to be a
very offensive film. On the sur
face, it's a story of love, both
young and old (meaning
"didn't know any better" and
"should have known better")
forming in the crucible of war
and strange surroundings.
Underneath, it's a shallow, jin
goistic, male chauvinistic
propaganda piece for Ameri
can men; the essence of its two
and one-half hours was stated
much more economically
when )ohn Travolta beat the
Puerto Rican disco dancers in
Saturday Night Fever.
Director John Schlesinger,
of Sunday, Bloody Sunday
fame, still has only one
strength — he brings his British
mid-lands locations to the sc
reen very well. All human in
terest gets lost in the scenery,

however. At least Yanks isn't
burdened with the topicality
and social significance that
make Sunday, Bloody Sunday
virtually impossible to sit
through now.
Yanks, in fact, has no detect
able significance whatever. As
the film opens, truckloads of
American troops roll into a
small British town. Women and
old men (there are no British
males between the ages of 15
and 35 out of uniform in the
entire film) line the streets. The
women cheer wildly, and their
happiness has nothing to do
with the fact that these boys are
making the world safe for
democracy.
As the film ends, the
truckloads roll out again, head
ing for the trains that wait to
carry the boys to war. British
women mob the train station,
tearing their hair and beating
their breasts. The boys seem
easily resigned to their fate;
either it hasn't occurred to
them that they are about to go
to war, or perhaps war doesn't
seem like such a bad alterna
tive.
Ten hours between these
two scenes are an extended
proof of the proposition:
American men make better
lovers. There aren't many
British men around, of course;
but as the cream of British
maidenhood falls, quickly, one

by one, the impression is built
up that the same thing would
have happened had Groucho
Marx been set loose in a Royal
Army bivouac in the 1880s.
A number of good actors are
wasted during this process,
primarily Vanessa Redgrave
and William DeVane. Red
grave, as befits her years and
manner, is allowed to hold out
through two-thirds of the film;
she spends most of her time
quietly saying no to DeVane
and comforting her son, a deli
cate, picked-upon child who
seems to represent the current
state of British manhood. De-
Vane is forced to grunt and
show his teeth quite a bit to
generate interest; his charac
ter otherwise possesses none.

better. At least his target (Lisa
Eichhorn) is younger and pret
tier than Redgrave; and she
