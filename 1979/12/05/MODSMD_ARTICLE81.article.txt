Brahams: Violin Concerto
Hermann Krebbers, violin.
Concertgebouw Or
chestra. Bernard Haitnik,
cond.
Philips Festivo 6570 172
Hermann wAio? That's
what people keep saying
when I tell them about
Krebbers, the concertmas
ter of the Concertgebouw
and one of the world's
greatest violinists. Now that
this 1973 recording has been
issued here at last, maybe I
won't have to keep explain
ing.
Krebbers has, for exam
ple, Isaac Stern's sweetness
of tone, but he has even
more power as well. He is
commanding where need
be (the first entry of the sol
oist) buttenderwhere many
violinists ride roughshod
(the conclusion of the first
movement after the
cadenza).
The collaboration bet
ween soloist and orchestra
is exceptional (Krebbers
first played this concerto
with them in 1932 — he was
nine) and the recording
tine, though the soloist is
placed slightly too tar tor
ward. Second to none,
especially at the price.
Dohnanyi, Serenede in C,
Op. 10.
Beethoven, Serenede in D,
Op. 8.
Itzhak Perlman, violin.
Pinchas Zukerman, viola.
Lynn Harrell, cello.
Columbia M 35152
An ideal coupling, and a
powerfully evocative one
for anyone who has been
lucky enough to enjoy live
chamber music in the
home. These trios are called
serenades — classy
background music, in a

sense — because of their
multi-movement form and
their light-hearted spirit.
The atmosphere is very
much that of great musi
cians making music to
gether just for fun; Colum
bia's all-star trio of friends
fits perfectly into this tradi
tion. If you had these three
over to your house, this
would be what they'd play,
no doubt, especially after a
little wine.
Cellists of the Berlin
Philharmonic
Works by Eder, Xenakis,
Villa-Lobos, etc.
Telefunken AW6 42339
Cellists are an arrogant
breed, or so this record
would lead one to con
clude. When violinists get
together to play, people
laugh, but when cellists
form a consort, we are sup
posed to be overawed. The
twelve cellists of the Berlin
Philharmonic have worked
hard to assert their inde
pendence as a performing
group, and I must admit
they've succeeded.
The program includes
existing works for cello en
semble (the Villa-Lobos),
works recently commis
sioned (the Eder and
Xenakis), and even cello ar
rangements of old stan
dards ("Yesterday" and"St.
Louis Blues"). One can only
marvel at the versatility of
the cello in skilled hands.
These players have a
blend of power and sweet
ness which Telefunken's re
cording captures well,
spreading them around the
stereo stage. It will be in
teresting to see what they
come up with for the next
record.
