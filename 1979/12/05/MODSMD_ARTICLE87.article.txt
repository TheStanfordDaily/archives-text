Born to Run
the Bruce Springsteen story

776 pp. $7.95
It was inevitable that Rolling
Stone roc k critic Dave Marsh
would one day write a Bruce
Springsteen book, Marsh's
"messianic regard'' for the
man called "The Boss" is by
now well established.
In his reviews of Springs
teen's albums, especially
Darkness orl the fdge of Town,
Marsh has managed to bril-

liantly combine his no
nonsense, int isive writing style
with his seemingly limitless
adoration for his subject. This
may well be the hardest thing
tor a critic to do, as other writ
ers at Rolling Stone have con
tinually proved with their intel
lectually overblown "this artist
is a god" ramblings.
Unfortunately, Marsh has
been less successful with this
unauthorized, picture-filled

biography. Marsh doesn't hide
the fact that he's writing from a
fan's perspective, and while
that's honest, it will probably
hurt the book's chances
among those who are unfamil
iar with Springsteen.
But Marsh is too talented a
writer to dismiss that easily.
And Springsteen is a far richer
subject than that of the usual
rock book.
Also, Marsh takes care to
give Springsteen's music a con
text. In his most riveting prose,
Marsh rips the cynical, aging
stars and the corporate music
system that artists like Springs
teen have continually had to
battle against.
Marsh's portrayal of Springs
teen as "the last of rock's great
innocents" is surely a convinc
ing one for many of those who
have heard Springsteen and
the tabled E Street Band play.
And the book pieces together
many heretofore scattered
remnants of Springsteen's
early life to give some clues to
the shaping of this dynamic
"innocent."
Springsteen is painted by
Marsh as a performer who,
from an early age, wanted only
to be a rock star. But instead of
looking at this obsession more
critically, Marsh tends to
romanticize it, producing a far
more unrealistic picture than
he probably had intended.
After seeing his career nearly
crippled by hype and a lengthy
lawsuit, Springsteen now
keeps track of every aspect of
his career, even down to the
printing of his album covers.
Springsteen has (ought, and so
far seemingly won, severe pro

tessional battles, but Marsh's
book doesn't show us the
scars, the price Springsteen
has had to pay for his obses
sions.
Despite the limitations, Born
to Run's anecdotes and, more
than that, its pictures tell an
often extremely vital, compel
ling story. At once angelic,
then angry, then again almost
brutally sexy, the photos of
Springsteen seern almost a re
telling of rock's history.
And among many other
emotions contained in both
the pictures and the prose
here, there's an overwhelming
feeling of freedom and of
complete commitment. Even
though I teel strongly that Dave
Marsh has had (and will have)
much better moments, in con
veying this, he has made his
fan's stance very understanda
ble.
