Need a gift tor that hard
to-please roommate? You
want to buy him a supply ot
his favorite hallucinogenic,
but you don't know where
to go? And you're afraid
he'd take .1 wrong if you
gave him air freshener?
We have the answer.
Here, just in time for
Christmas, is The Cul
tivator's Handbook of
Marijuana (Wingbow Press,
$8.95), a revised and ex
panded edition of the clas
sic guide first issued in 1971.
In 223 action-packed pages,
Bill Drake, a "devotee ot the
marijuana plant," tells you
everything you need to
know about growing
marijuana inside and out.
The highly-detailed text
covers everything from
fluorescent lighting and
daylengths to fertilizers and
the correct way to prune

your plant.
But Drake's interest
doesn't end with the tech
nical aspects ot marijuana.
Describing the plant as a
"great force in the evolution
of human consciousness,"
he devotes the book's first
section to the social and
spiritual dimensions ot
psychoactive drug usage.
The discussion ranges from
the history of the drug to
modern techniques for de
veloping greater rapport
with your plants.
Drake, a true visionary,
hopes for a time when small
family farms will grow
marijuana as a cash crop and
fine restaurants will use it as
an exquisite herb. He is cur
rently working on his next
book, The Cannabis Gour
met's Cookbook, to stay
one step ahead of the re
volution.
