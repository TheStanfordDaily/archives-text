# Borges and himself
## 
### 
Who is Jorge Luis Borges?
External facts: born 1899 in
Buenos Aires, educated in
Europe, became seriously ill,
while convalescing wrote the
first of the "fictions" which
were to make him famous.
While known by readers of
Spanish as South America's
greatest prose writer for many
years, only in the last 20 years
have translations been availa
ble. In 1961 he and Samuel
Beckett shared the Interna
tional Publishers Prize; he is a
perennial favorite to win a
Nobel Prize in literature.
Such is Borges' career and
reputation. And how else are
we to know a man who seems
so unsure himself of his own
identity, who merely calls him
self "one who has not died"?
To help us approach an ans
wer, A Personal Anthology,
first published in 1967, has
been reissued in paperback
(Grove Press, $3.95). It is a col
lection of short stories, essays,
poems and sketches selected,
compiled and ordered by
Borges himself.
The pieces are, by Borges'
own admission, the ones he
would like to be remembered
by; "I should like to be judged
by it, justified or reproved be
cause of it, and not by certain
exercises in excessive and
apocryphal local color which I
cannot recall without a blush."
Forsaking chronological order,
he has arranged the pieces ac
cording to his perception of
their "sympathies and differ

ences."
Running through A Personal
Anthology is the theme, an ob
session with Borges, of the na
ture of the self, of the differ
ence between man as man and
man as author, discoverer of
the universe's secrets. The
next-to-last selection in the an
thology is the famous sketch
"Borges and I."
In it, Borges the man discus
ses his relationship with
Borges the author and public
figure: "... I recognize my

self less in his books than in
many another, or than in the
intricate flourishes played on a
guitar." He is caught in a
paradox of despair; while his
(the author's) literature justifies
his life, it belongs not to him
but to the literary tradition and
offers him no hope of salva
tion.
But the book ends on a note
of hope — "Beyond my anxi
ety, Beyond my writing/the
universe waits, inexhaustible,
inviting."
