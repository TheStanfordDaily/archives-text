Bangkok, Thailand (AP) — The Phnorn Penh
government Sunday denied that international
aid to Cambodia was being diverted to Vietnam
and that only small quantities had been distri
buted to the Cambodian people.
In a statement carried by the news agency
SPK, Cambodia said the supplies from interna
tional agencies and private Western aid groups
had been distributed to "all parts of Cambodia
under the supervision and with the collabora
tion of the representatives" of aid groups.
I he Cambodian government denounced
comments made by members of a French par

liamentary delegation that recently visited
Cambodia, who charged that aid was being im
properly distributed and was being siphoned off
by the Vietnamese. The United States also has
complained of inefficient distribution of food
and medicine in the international effort against
famine in Cambodia.
In Singapore this weekend, officials of two
private aid organizations — Malcolm Harper of
the British agency Oxfam and Roger Walker of
World Vision — said they were satisfied after
recent trips to Cambodia that food was reaching
the country's population.
