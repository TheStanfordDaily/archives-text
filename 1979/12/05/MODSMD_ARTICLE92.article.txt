Trying to do Cliff, Barnes and
Noble, and Twentieth Century
Views one better, Pantheon
Books has begun publication
of a series of "documentary
comic books." Each takes a
major thinker or issue and pre
sents their life and ideas in il
lustrated form. Shown here are
samples from the first two vol
umes, Freud for Beginners and
Einstein for Beginners.
Designed to amuse more
than to enlighten, the books
will not replace textbooks, and

are probably more expensive
to begin with ($8.95). But
ihey are informative, if not de
finitive, and a pleasant way to
pass the time in Meyer while
waiting for your reserve book.
Future volumes planned in
clude Marx for Beginners, The
Anti-Nuclear Handbook, and
Feminism for Beginners (the
planners seem to have a rather
radical bias — also in the works
are Lenin, Mao and Trotsky for
beginners).
