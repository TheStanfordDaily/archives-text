Hubert
Edgar Berman, M.D.
C.P. Putnam's Sons
300 pp. $10.95
Edgar Berman's biog
raphy of Hubert Humphrey
begins with a dedication.
Not by the author, but to the
author. "To Eagar — my de
voted friend — my counsel
lor — but above all the
friend I can trust and believe
with admiration and affec
tion. Hubert H."
Turn the page. Another
dedication. This time by the
author. "To those tens of
millions of true believers
who knew their man and
never wavered in their sup
port of him through the
bleakest and darkest nights
of his elective years;
through a humiliating vice
presidency, an anguishing
war, and a period of unde
served calumny by a nation
in turmoil." Etc., etc.
Now that objectivity has
been thrown out the win
dow, Berman gets down to
the business of biography.
In one sense, the entire
story has already been told;
the story of the book, that
is, not the story of Hum
phrey. Berman, Hum
phrey's great friend and
personal medical adviser,
has penned a polemic on
modern politics and a diat

ribe against almost
everyone involved in it.
This is a shame, for few
recent figures deserve a
sympathetic hearing as
much as Humphrey. The re
cord, or at least a dig just
beneath it, shows that
Humphrey was one of the
most decent, honest and
able men in American polit
ical history. His life-long
support of peace and civil
rights, obscured by
Johnson's political man
euvers, was acknowledged
before his death and has
been celebrated since.
Berman, however, will
not settle for letting the re
cord speak for itself. His
evangelical fervor for clear
ing Humphrey of the
charges of conservative

war-mongering made in the
late 60s (especially after the
1968 Chicago convention)
lead him to maximize every
virtue of Humphrey's and
every slight he suffered.
Political figures and news
men who hindered Hum
phrey through forgetful
ness or indifference or any
number of innocent
reasons become evil con
spirators.
The book is valuable,
though, as the only
thorough account thus far
of Humphrey's career, and,
by extension, of a large part
of the history of the war in
Vietnam and the civil rights
movement. Read for facts
and not opinions, it serves a
eood purpose.
