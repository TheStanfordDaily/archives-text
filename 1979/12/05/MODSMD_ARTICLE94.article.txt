So what if you have holes in your socks? You
can still eat Japanese food without being embar
rassed. So what if you can't eat using chopsticks,
we used our fingers. Fukisushi, ten miles south
on El Camino, features authentic Japanese
cuisine.
This eighteen-month-old restaurant is a
branch of a famous Japanese chain. In fact, most
of the employees are Japanese, and the chef
himself is from Osaka. Fukisushi's atmosphere,
a blend of East and West, features Japanese
decor combined with western dining style. The
Oriental mystique of rice paper lanterns,
kimonoed waitresses, chopsticks and Kikkoman
soy sauce does not go unnoticed. Neither do the
Japanese objets d art which are carefully
placed throughout the restaurant.
The food, although expensive for the portions
received, is excellent in quality. Diners can
choose from either the dinner or an a la carte
menu, both of which include plenty of delicious
gooey rice and green tea. One of Fukisushi's
most popular dishes is the tempura: shrimp,
vegetables or squid dipped in batter and deli
cately deep-fried. It is truly delicious, and
ranges in price at around $5.00 a plate.
Another a la carte entree is the teriyaki, from
chicken and pork for $5.25 to salmon, eel and

$6.25, one receives assorted raw fish served with
green mustard and a special soy sauce. Don't be
afraid to try the raw fish — it's tun to be daring.
The octopus and squid are the best, while there
is also raw tuna, shellfish and mackerel.

FVKISUSHI
Japanese Restaurant

However, the most interesting feature ot
Fukisushi is the shushi bar, located in the rear ot
the restaurant. The customer chooses his or her
own assorted fish, and watt lies the chef prepare
it as shushi. Shushi consists of a core of raw fish,
vegetables or egg, surrounded by seasoned
rice, wrapped in seaweed and sliced. This is a
must if you haven't tried it. The average price is
$4.00.
Dinners, priced from $7.25 to $15.50, are
served with soup, salad, rice and green tea.
Specialties include the Fukisushi (steak and
tempura), Sashimi (raw fish), Sukiyaki, and
much more.
There is also a wide assortment of appetizers,
salads and soups. One unusual yet great soup is
the Chawanmushi ($2.00). It is thick like custard,
steamed with egg, shrimp, chicken and veeeta-


steak, at $5.75, $6.00 and $6.25 respectively.
These platters are presented with rice, green
pepper, beansprouts, honeydew melon, and an
unusual but delightful potato puree which is
served cold and contains peas and chunks of
apples. Here again, one might guess that steak
(eriyaki is a very frequently ordered dish.
The final a la carte choice is the sashimi. For

bles.
Fukisushi probably can serve some of the best
Japanese cuisine in the are.). Another redeem
ing feature is that they accept Master Charge,
Visa and American Express. Open weekdays,
11:30-2:00 for lunch, and daily 5:00-10:00 for
dinner. Closed Mondays.
Go there — Sayonara.
