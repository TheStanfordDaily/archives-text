Are you overdosed on
pizza? Can you no longer
face a lack-in-the-Box bur
rito in the eye? Have you
wanted to upgrade your
dining-out without sacrific
ing the month's rent?
The Onion Barn at 4970 LI
Camino Real, Los Altos,
provides pewter table ser
vice, exceptionally well
prepared and fresh tood,
iow lighting and full bar tor
prices comparable to those
ot lull dinners at local coffee
shops. Lhe menu lor dinner
otters hot entrees, large
salads and special
sandwiches.
The hot entree choices
range from $4.50 to $6.95
with 11 ot the 13 offerings
priced at $5.25 or lower.
Halt ol the entrees are sea
tood dishes while chit ken
and beef plates take up the
balance. As the menu ot
tered this greater choice
among seafood plates, we

ordered the Lish Shrimp
Polynesia ($5.25) and Baked
Pacific Salmon ($5.25). Each
entree includes soup or
green salad, sourdough
bread, vegetable

Q||Hon

The two entrees arrived
with rice and a pea and car
rot mix on the side. The
shrimp had been very lightly
and delicately battered;
there was a small bowl of a
sweet polynesian sauce, but
I enjoyed my shrimp more
without it. The baked sal
mon was also good though
probably not as good as can
be bought in I'uget Sound.

I he generous savings
satisfied me, but being wil
ling to sacritice my waistline
for the review, I ordered the
Peach Flambe ($2.50) tor the
dessert. The peach wasn't
nearly as tresh as the peas,
but with the surrounding
ice cream, brandy and
tlames it didn't seem to mat
ter. The cheesecake wasn't
quite as good as the Flambe
and not half as much tun.
Other entrees were the
Canneloni Milanaise ($4.50)
which features stuffed thin
crepes with chopped chic
ken, c heese and turkey with
a topping of cream and to
mato meat sauce, and I ried
Baby Scallops ($5.75).
Greens and Things titles
the salad section which ot
ters a tresh spinach salad
($1.25) and various combi
nations of bay shrimp, crab
and avocado salads priced
from $J. 95 to S r >, -r i. t ac li
comes with sourdough
bread.
Beginning the special
sandwich list is the $4.25
Onion Barn Special which,

not surprisingly, combines
a side order of onion rings
with Canadian bacon,
sauteed mushrooms, on
ions and melted cheese,
topping an English muffin.
The lunch size costs $1.25.
Crab Alfredo ($5.25 or
$4.25 tor lunch) places
crabmeat, cheese and sauce
Mornay on a mutlin while
lor those with a less pres
sing sense ot adventure
there's a Hamburger Ex
travaganza ($4.25) ot tresh
ground char-broiled meat
with melted cheese and
sauteed mushrooms.
The Onion Barn also cat
ers to the lunch crowd by
adding a salad bar and some
cold sandwiches to its
menu.
The Onion Barn provides
nice surroundings, ex
tremely good food, moder
ate prices and a jazz swing
band on Saturday nights in
the bar from l ) p.m. to mid
night. Try going to Denny's
and asking when the band
plays.

nearly as tresh as the peas,

sauteed mushrooms, on
ions and melted cheese,
topping an English muffin.
The lunch size costs $1.25.
Crab Alfredo ($5.25 or
$4.25 tor lunch) places
