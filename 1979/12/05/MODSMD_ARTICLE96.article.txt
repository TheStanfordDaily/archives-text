I didn't go back to look at
him, but I took their word that
the cooker was happy at the
Happy Cooker Saturday even
ing.
He cooked up a nice veal
piccata, I haven't had too many
veal piccatas to compare it
with, but I'd say it was tender
and well spiced. The broccoli
was crisp and delicious. The
dinner also included lentil
soup, rice, salad from the salad
bar, ice cream dessert, and a
Lowenbrau. All foods per
formed admirably on my tas
tebuds. My friend reported
that the prawns were average.
It's hard to cook a truly
superior prawn. The broccoli
was impressive.
On to the question of impor

tance: Why go to the Happy
Cooker for dinner? You might
go because the Cooker is near
the Keystone and the Fine Arts
Theatre. (Cooker is half a block
off El Camino on California.)
It's a classy way to start off a big
evening. Moneyed Daily read
ers might go because they
enjoy good food. I say
"moneyed" because our din
ner for two, for example, cost
eighteen dollars. The Cooker is
not lack's, despite its similarly
funny name.
The Cooker offers four
categories of food: seafood,
veal, chicken, and meat. The
items range broadly from red
snapper ($6.50) to chicken
souvaroff ($6.95) to calves liver
and bacon, with fried onions
($6.50). I appreciate the unpre
tentious dinner menu: there's
only one listing for steak, the
essential New York cut, and
prawns aren't listed under five

different names.
However, there is the usual
glut of salad listings. I suppose
this is due to pressure from
salad devotees who seem to
have great power in this na
tion. There's the Chef's salad
or the half Chef's salad. After
all, everyone has heard some
one exclaim, "Oh, that's too
much salad!"
Let's face it, the salad bar is
where it's at, and the Cooker
has a fine salad bar. It is
stocked with four excellent
salad dressings, well prepared
lettuce and tomatoes, green
beans, those funny yellow
spherical things (garbanzos),
etc. I, a dorm food service un
fortunate, realized that there
are tasty salad dressings. Mine
was light blue and tasted
snappy. Yes, snappy.
The lights are low in the
Cooker. This, combined with

the simple, tasteful, flowery
decor, makes for a good con
versation environment. I sup
pose you could do other things
besides talk in such an envi
ronment.

When we were there most
people were cool. Dress
ranged from levis to tweed
coats. It's not a stuffy highbrow
place, nor is it a cute organic
place. (Okay, there are a few
cute flower pots.) For the most
part, the place is on the level.
The staff is there to serve good
food to you and not flash you
phony tip smiles. I like that.
Another thing I like is their
liquor list. It features six beers
including Michelob, Heine
ken, Lowenbrau, and three
lessers, and rose, chablis and
burgundy. Adrink is80cents to
$1.20.
Parents will like their
reasonable children's dinners:
hamburger steak ($2.50), fried
chicken ($2.50), and top sirloin
($3.95). Gluttons will like their
New York cut steak (12 oz.,
$8.50). Dieters will like their
"high protein entrees served
with cottage cheese, tomatoes
and hard boiled eggs,"

(though I don't know why).
The host led me to believe
that lunch time is when the
Cooker really gets rolling. The
sandwich list is impressive in
content. Sandwiches average
about $2.50, and some of them
have cute names such as the
Catsby, the Daisy and the
Flora. (Somebody had just
finished reading The Great
Catsby when he made up the
sandwich list.)
You can buy a deli club for
$3.55, or a hot brisket of beef
for $3.25. The Cooker also has
four versions of the hamburger
including the triumphant
"Cooker's Whopper," $2.95.
Breakfast is where the Happy
Cooker really comes into its
own. They proudly boast 17
three egg omelettes (around
three bucks apiece), and take
requests. I can just imagine the
Cooker beaming with happi
ness as he receives a request.
Omelette number one is
strawberry jam. We're talking a
diversified omelette list. This is
state-of-the-art restauranting.
If you're hungry for quality
and can spare the pecunias,
don't skip over the Happy
Cooker when perusing the Yel
low Pages restaurant section. I
take that back. The Cooker is
not yet in the Yellow Pages be
cause it's only three weeks old.
This also explains why you've
never heard of it. I hope I won't
be accused of spoiling the un
hurried pace of the place by
telling you about it.
Grand Opening is today,
tomorrow and Saturday and
includes breakfast and dinner
specials. Check out the Noel
sign at the end of California
Avenue after dinner.

burgundy. Adrink is80cents to
$1.20.
Parents will like their
reasonable children's dinners:
hamburger steak ($2.50), fried
chicken ($2.50), and top sirloin
($3.95). Gluttons will like their
New York cut steak (12 oz.,
$8.50). Dieters will like their
"high protein entrees served
with cottage cheese, tomatoes
and hard boiled eggs,"

(though I don't know why).
The host led me to believe
that lunch time is when the
Cooker really gets rolling. The
sandwich list is impressive in
content. Sandwiches average
about $2.50, and some of them
have cute names such as the
Catsby, the Daisy and the
Flora. (Somebody had just
finished reading The Great
Catsby when he made up the
sandwich list.)
You can buy a deli club for
$3.55, or a hot brisket of beef
for $3.25. The Cooker also has
four versions of the hamburger
including the triumphant
"Cooker's Whopper," $2.95.
Breakfast is where the Happy
Cooker really comes into its
own. They proudly boast 17
three egg omelettes (around
three bucks apiece), and take
requests. I can just imagine the
Cooker beaming with happi
ness as he receives a request.
Omelette number one is
strawberry jam. We're talking a
diversified omelette list. This is
state-of-the-art restauranting.
If you're hungry for quality
and can spare the pecunias,
don't skip over the Happy
Cooker when perusing the Yel
low Pages restaurant section. I
take that back. The Cooker is
not yet in the Yellow Pages be
cause it's only three weeks old.
This also explains why you've
never heard of it. I hope I won't
be accused of spoiling the un
hurried pace of the place by
telling you about it.
Grand Opening is today,
tomorrow and Saturday and
includes breakfast and dinner
specials. Check out the Noel
sign at the end of California
Avenue after dinner.

I didn't go back to look at
him, but I took their word that
the cooker was happy at the
Happy Cooker Saturday even
ing.
He cooked up a nice veal
piccata, I haven't had too many
veal piccatas to compare it
with, but I'd say it was tender
and well spiced. The broccoli
was crisp and delicious. The
dinner also included lentil
soup, rice, salad from the salad
bar, ice cream dessert, and a
Lowenbrau. All foods per
formed admirably on my tas
tebuds. My friend reported
that the prawns were average.
It's hard to cook a truly
superior prawn. The broccoli
was impressive.
On to the question of impor

tance: Why go to the Happy
Cooker for dinner? You might
go because the Cooker is near
the Keystone and the Fine Arts
Theatre. (Cooker is half a block
off El Camino on California.)
It's a classy way to start off a big
evening. Moneyed Daily read
ers might go because they
enjoy good food. I say
"moneyed" because our din
ner for two, for example, cost
eighteen dollars. The Cooker is
not lack's, despite its similarly
funny name.
The Cooker offers four
categories of food: seafood,
veal, chicken, and meat. The
items range broadly from red
snapper ($6.50) to chicken
souvaroff ($6.95) to calves liver
and bacon, with fried onions
($6.50). I appreciate the unpre
tentious dinner menu: there's
only one listing for steak, the
essential New York cut, and
prawns aren't listed under five

different names.
However, there is the usual
glut of salad listings. I suppose
this is due to pressure from
salad devotees who seem to
have great power in this na
tion. There's the Chef's salad
or the half Chef's salad. After
all, everyone has heard some
one exclaim, "Oh, that's too
much salad!"
Let's face it, the salad bar is
where it's at, and the Cooker
has a fine salad bar. It is
stocked with four excellent
salad dressings, well prepared
lettuce and tomatoes, green
beans, those funny yellow
spherical things (garbanzos),
etc. I, a dorm food service un
fortunate, realized that there
are tasty salad dressings. Mine
was light blue and tasted
snappy. Yes, snappy.
The lights are low in the
Cooker. This, combined with

the simple, tasteful, flowery
decor, makes for a good con
versation environment. I sup
pose you could do other things
besides talk in such an envi
ronment.

When we were there most
people were cool. Dress
ranged from levis to tweed
coats. It's not a stuffy highbrow
place, nor is it a cute organic
place. (Okay, there are a few
cute flower pots.) For the most
part, the place is on the level.
The staff is there to serve good
food to you and not flash you
phony tip smiles. I like that.
Another thing I like is their
liquor list. It features six beers
including Michelob, Heine
ken, Lowenbrau, and three
lessers, and rose, chablis and
burgundy. Adrink is80cents to
$1.20.
