JO ★ ★ *
Park, Menlo Park
The sexist ad campaign has
misled many people to this
movie; if you're looking for a
semi-pornographic turn-on, 10
may not be right for you. Writer
director Blake Edwards' values
are, for lack of a better word,
straight, and this comedy about
male mid-life crisis probably
won't please those who enjoy
watching females get conquered.
As an over-40 songwriter, Dudley
Moore is an ingratiating bum
bler, and Edwards gives the re
mainder of the cast more than
enough depth to get by. Except
♦or Bo Derek, that is. This
poster-star just may have found
her "niche" as the vacuous "10"
the title refers to.

Harold and Maude ★ * ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals
and committing suicide. Maude
is an old woman who believes in
free love and in the inherent
goodness of humanity. It's
clear from the beginning that the
two are destined to fall in love.
Hal Ashby (Shampoo, Coming
Home) directed this invigorating
cult comedy. The two principals
are played by Bud Cort and Ruth
Cordon. Songs by Cat Stevens
round out the soundtrack.
—Jim Mattson
The Rose *
Century 23, San Jose
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion of Star is Born except this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character vag
uely based on |anis Joplin. But
the movie only makes three re
ferences to 1969, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
And the music is more aptly de
scribed as frenetic show tunes
with bass and drums than as |anis
loplin's form of blues and rock.
The performances at times man
age to obscure some of the
movie's hollowness, but the
much-ballyhooed Bette Midler
only exacerbates the problem by
being less-than-convincing in the
concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
100 late.

Nosferatu ★ * ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
It is easy to make a poor
Dracula film. It is possible, on a
relatively low budget, to sprinkle
some blood, add a few claws and
fangs for good measure and cast
a comely young woman in the
victim's role and call the mixture
a Dracula movie. Writer-director
Werner Herzog does more than
that. Like Shakespeare did with

so many of his stories, he takes a
well-known tale to its logical
conclusion, extrapolating from
the bare bones of the narrative to
a flesh-and-blood creation one
can relate to. The end of the
movie has more promise than its
beginning, perhaps. Nosferatu
ends up human, pitiable — not a
personification of mechanistic
evil worthy of Alien, but a living
breathing being, whereas he
started out much more imper
sonal. This tension works against
the movie, but it is not an overrid
ing problem. And clearly, as any
one can tell by watching the
movie, this Dracula sucks.
—Seth Zuckerman
Yanks * * ■
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Like a short hit of nitrous oxide
— gives you a brief high, but it

quickly wears off. A nostalgia trip
that withers in its sentimentality,
providing a sometimes pleasura
ble sweetness but little heat.
Plots about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often pro
vided fertile movie ground, but
director )ohn Schlesinger, armed
with skilled crew and healthy
budget, manages only to exhibit
the genre's limitations. Lisa Eic
hhorn and Richard Gere, the
young lovers, have the best of it
here; they both at least deliver
emotions that strike you. Despite
the likeability of the performers,
the Vanessa Redgrave-William
Devane sequences probably
should have been scrapped; the
only point of contrast made is
that they are older and less naive
than Eichhorn and Gere. Limp
lyricism; no magic.
—R.L.

Luna * *
Metro, San Francisco
One of Bernardo Bertolucci's
least ambitious and (though this
doesn't necessarily follow) least
successful efforts. The movie
contrasts an arena of relative
harmony and order (opera) with
the dissonance and disorder of
the relationship between a
mother and son. Luna is Ber
tolucci's first English language
film, but he seems more unfamil
iar with the subject area here
than he does with the new lan
guage. Cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro (who also did the photo
graphy in Apocalpyse Now) pro
vides him with startling images,
but Bertolucci seems to still be
groping with the intellectual di
mensions of his subject; he's not
quite sure how to communicate

it. In a very different role, Jill
Clayburgh is sporadically good;
it's her most mannered perfor
mance, and such an approach
doesn't quite suit her. As the son,
Matthew Brady is the best thing
in the movie. Both overpower
ingly violent and surprisingly
sensual, Brady delivers a
frighteningly intense embodi
ment of self-destructive eroti
cism.
—R.L.
Apocalpyse Now ★ ★ ★ ★
Old Mill
Century 21, San lose
Northpoint, San Francisco
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella

Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions that it
confronts you with justify the
seeming craziness of this "im
possible," almost nihilistic, vis
ion of mankind. Starring Marlon
Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.
—R.L.

Life of Brian ★ *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Sort of like Godspell with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all
funny, but it goes on for much
too long. Python takes aim at bi
blical epics, terrorist logistics and
the PLO; while they don't always
score, even a series of bullseyes
would be boring. A Python movie
needs a better plot than the Bible
can provide.
—Mike Hale
Starting Over ★ ★
Palo Alto Square
Extremely unambitious; rarely
rises above the level of unin

spired '40s romantic comedy. Di
rector Alan Pakula (Klute, All the
President's Men) is more at home
with suspense and crisp drama
tics; here he comes off as an old
time studio hack with a comic
sense that is, at best, unsure.
But all that wouldn't matter too
much if the movie were carried
off with the kind of winking
lightness that Burt Reynolds' per
formance here continually deliv
ers. (ill Clayburgh is wasted;
Candice Bergen is supposed to
be shrill and awful — and she's
successful. No matter what Burt
Reynolds is in, it seems, he ends
up being the only reason to see it.
—R.L.
The Big Sleep * ★ ★ ★
Festival Cinema, Paio Alto
Howard Hawks' "tough guy"
style fits this adaptation of the

Raymond Chandler novel per
fectly. Philip Marlowe, the hard
boiled private eye, is a piece-of
cake characterization for Hum
phrey Bogart, and the pairing of
Bogart with Lauren Bacall here is
movie — and sexual — magic.
William Faulkner assisted
Raymond Chandler on the script,
which is full of fast-paced double
entendres. When they're spoken
by Bogart and Bacall, they be
come very easy to understand. As
they discuss the characteristics of
horse racing here, you knowpre
cisely what they're getting at. By
the end of the movie, you may
not know who did what to whom,
but chances are you won't care.
—R.L.

Watership Down 4f
Old Mill
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a movie most
notable tor its lack of distinction
— I'd take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster rabbits any day. Direc
tor Martin Rosen has bragged in
interviews that he knew nothing
about animation before under
taking Watership Down, and it
shows in every institutionally
colored frame. This is one of
those attempts at whimsy which,
instead ot waking you up, makes
you leave the theater feeling as if
you've slept all night with your
mouth open.
—J.M.
Fiddler on the Hoof ★ * *
Old Mill
Norman lewison, who in 1971
was in much better torm than he

is now, directed this vibrant
movie musltal. lewison doesn't
attempt to temper the theatrical
ity inherent in the material, yet
the movie doesn't get stagy —
lewison keeps things flowing
smoothly. As Tevye, the main
character, Topol may not be as
brilliant as Zero Mostel was in the
stage version, but he still tills the
mighty role with a supreme zest
and vitality.
—R.L.
The Lord of the Rings ★
Old Mill
One of last year's most promis
ing movies turns out to be one of

its most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the
Cat and Wizards) adds one or two
nice scenes, but the look of this
film, which mixes animation with
rudely re-dyed live action, is less
Tolkien than tacky. The lowest
blow is the movie's ending: after
more than two hours we are in
formed that this is merely Part
One — come back in a year or so
tor more details.
—J.M.
And /ustice For All *
Palo Alto Square
About 10 years ago, this movie
would have made a great TV pilot
tilm, and that's probably the best
that can be said for it. Lots of the
"can the honest, crusading
lawyer keep his integrity in the
ugly, dog-eat-dog world of crim
inals, dirty attorneys and dishon
est judges?" type conflict. Nor
man lewison, who should know
better, directs the shallow
dramatics and cheap comedy in
the script with an embarrassing
earnestness. Al Pacino has nfcver
seemed so ordinary; by sheer
force of will, he's interesting, but
the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be successful in his bid for
a weekly series?" Pacino must be
more ambitious than that.
— R.I.
Moonraker ★
Menlo Menlo Park
Formula lames Bond — it looks
as if this movie was made from a
recipe instead of from a script.
Take one dose of Roger Moore
(whatever you say, I still like
Connery better), one major
femme fatale (in this case Lois
Chiles, who seems fine right up
until she speaks), and a gimmicky
plot and you can make your very
own James Bond movie.
Moon raker has a great pre-title
sequence that is shot in mid-air;
after that the movie is ear
thbound for two solid hours —
even the patented in-the-sack
last scene seems affected by
fatigue. The Spy Who Loved Me,
the last Bond movie, was watcha
ble; skip this one and wait for
something better to come along.
—J.M.
The Great Train Robbery * ★
Menlo, Menlo Park
Michael Crichton's movie
about "the first train robbery" is
an entertainment that's not quite
as classy as it wants to be. It's got
a hack's mentality ("all you need
is photography, semblance of
plot and a beautiful woman").
But there are enough twists,
enough Sean Connery and
enough cinematography from
the late Geoffrey Unsworth to
sustain the pleasant, glossy feel
ing here — but, overall, it's fake
gloss and not real sparkle. With
Donald Sutherland and Lesley-
Anne Down.
—R.L.
