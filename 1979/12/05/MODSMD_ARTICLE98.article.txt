# Ticket office to be BASS outlet
## 
### Rebecca Moss 
Students here won't have to leave campus to buy
tickets for most concerts and other events once a new
BASS outlet opens in lanuary at the Tresidder Ticket
Office.
The closest outlet now is at Bullocks in the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Having a BASS outlet in addition to a Ticketron outlet
at Tresidder will enable students here to get most tic
kets, said Larry Davidson of the Tresidder Ticket Office,
including tickets for many of the Bill Graham events.
Students will also have access to tickets for the Fox
Warfield in San Francisco and the Keystone in Berkeley,
he said.
"We are hoping through the BASS outlet to com
puterize the ticket office," Davidson said.
Students will be able to "get almost any ticket in
stantly," said Lenny Lieberman of ASSU Special Events.
Last year the ticket office handled over 150,000 tickets.
With the addition of BASS "we hope to gain the capabil
ity of handling more events with a quicker service," said

Davidson.
Another benefit of the BASS outlet is that it will allow
the University to put tickets for shows on sale instantly,
according to John Harris of the ASSU Special Events.
Tresidder's current policy is not to charge students a
service for ticket purchases. Instead, ASSU Special
Events absorbs a cost of 22 cents on each general admis
sion ticket and 27 cents on each reserved ticket.
According to Lieberman, no other promoter does this.
Harris said that the installation of the BASS outlet will
not change this policy. "However, we would hope that
somewhere along the road we can decrease the amount
that we pay out," he said.
ASSU Special Events pre-prints "hard tickets" for on
campus shows. The BASS outlet will enable Special
Events to punch the information into the terminal and
"eliminate the need for hard tickets at the box office,"
Harris said.
"Eor a really hot show we may have a few hard tickets
to accommodate BASS, in case it can't print the tickets
fast enough," he added.


The ASSU Speakers Bureau sponsored last Thursday's "The
Future of Nuclear Power" debate at Kresge Auditorium.
Participants included (I. to r.) Gus Taylor, Westinghouse
senior project engineer, Ann Pauley, Westinghouse nuclear
