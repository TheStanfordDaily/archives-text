# Nuke debate outlines conflicts

### Dean Eyre Senior staff writer 
A debate on "The Future of Nuc
lear Power" ended in a deadlock with
both sides citing conflicting studies
on several key issues of the troubled
industry.
The two-hour presentation, spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau,
drpw i small audience to Kresge Au
..iii (.lursday night. After the
debate, trie debaters fielded ques
tions from the floor.
Participants included the Westin
ghouse Campus America representa
tives, known as one of the nation's
utility "truth squads," Ann Pauley, a
nuclear fuel engineer for Westin
ghouse, and Gus Taylor, senior pro
ject engineer for the firm.
Representing the con side were
Peter Faulkner, a professor here with
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues, anti-nuclear activist
and author of Silent Bomb, and Dr.
Peter Joseph of the Physicians for So
cial Responsibility.
The basic question raised by the
nuclear advocates was, "If not nuc
lear, what other resources are
there?"
Although the Westinghouse de
baters defended aspects of the nuc
lear controversy such as radiation
hazards, waste disposal and
weapons proliferation, the major
thrust of their position was to com
pare nuclear energy to coal in terms
ot societal risks.
Some of the environmentalists
criticizing the nuclear industry have
proposed that America's abundant
supply of coal be utilized as a "transi
tion" fuel until alternative energy
sources such as solar catch on.
Taylor argued that nuclear was the
preferred resource of the two, citing
the problems of air pollution, strip
mining and black lung disease as
drawbacks to using coal.
Faulkner summarized the anti
nuclear position by expressing con

cern for the "prodigious amounts of
radioactivity released under normal
operation . . . and the fact that "a
major accident would cause a major
release of radioactivity capable of kil
ling thousands and making an area
the size of Pennsylvania uninhabita
ble" for many generations.
Faulkner also stressed that opera
tion ot nuclear reactors and control
of the resulting wastes will "require
long-term social stability and super
management, not Chrysler man
agement, not Lockheed manage
ment or that of the Pentagon or space
program."
The nuclear critics also pointed out
the significant drop in electrical de
mand since the 1973 Arab oil em
bargo and the potential for greater
energy conservation to eliminate the
need for increased nuclear capacity.

Radiation, waste disposal and pro
liferation were the areas of greatest
disagreement. The Westinghouse
pair emphasized that there is a "small
risk from low-level radiation," that
nuclear waste disposal is a proven
technology (using specialized en
casement procedures to isolate the
waste in geologic formations) and
that military reactors are much more
of a threat than commercial ones in
the proliferation of potential
weapon-grade material.
To point out the dangers of low
level radiation, Taylor read studies
showing increased rates of Down's
syndrome from high background
radiation. The studies also showed
tissue damage in vital parts of repro
ductive organs of laboratory animals
resulting from radiation concentra
tion.
