Auditing
Students who register on a full-time basis are considered to have the privilege of the
University and may, with the consent of the instructors, audit lecture courses in addition to
the program taken for credit. Students registered on some partial basis (such as half
tuition) may not audit additional courses without payment of the regular tuition that would
be charged for credit registration. Changing from auditing basis to credit basis or vice
versa is not permitted after the published deadline for changing study lists.
Persons not registered at Stanford are permitted to audit only under unusual cir
cumstances; permission may be granted by the Registrar or Associate Registrar on
payment of the Attendance Permit fee of $525 per quarter.
Stanford alumni and their spouses may register on Attendance Permit basis on request
and upon payment of the Attendance Permit Fee.
Faculty may attend another faculty member's class upon his or her invitation.
A member of the University staff may audit lecture courses with a letter from the
department head that auditing will not interfere with normal duties and that the course in
question will contribute to the ability to perform the assignment. Spouses of University
faculty and staff may audit lecture courses. In both of the above cases a Courtesy Card
should be obtained from the Registrar or Associate Registrar. In all cases of auditing the
instructor's consent is required.
No person should attend any class unless he or she is in one of the classifications above.
