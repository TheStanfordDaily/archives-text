# Profs want avocados spared

### Joan O'Connell 
Seven septuagenarian avocado trees in the cour
tyard of the inner quad may soon join the cypress and
the Lilly Pilly as tree casualties here unless Professors
Ronald Braceweli and Eric Hutchinson succeed in
saving them.
The trees, located between Buildings 1 and 120, are
threatened because they interfere with plans to reno
vate Building 120, the old Graduate School of Busi
ness. The trees impede the maneuvering of heavy
equipment which will be needed to gut and rebuild
the structure, according to Robert Nerrie of Facilities
Planning, project coordinator.
"Estimators have told us it will cost $39,000 extra to
leave the trees in," Nerrie explained, "and even at
that we may have to cut them back severely. Also,
they may be damaged by the equipment if they are
left in," he said.
The University decided to remove the avocado
trees, said Assistant Director of Facilities Peter Hopf.
This decision, which was "not easily reached," is
under "active consideration," he added, and Presi
dent Richard Lyman and Vice-Presidents Donald
Kennedy, William Massy, Clayton Rich, Robert
Rosenzweig and )oel Smith, are attempting to "arrive
at a formula where perhaps only some of the trees
need be removed."
Apparently attempting to appeal to the commit
tee's economic justifications for their original deci
sion, Braceweli, professor of radio science and elec
trical engineering, pointed out in a letter to Provost
Donald Kennedy that removing the trees may in fact
be "false economy."
Braceweli, a member of the International Shadet
ree Conference, has been creating a mini-campaign
to save the trees, citing among other things that the

grove has an approximate value of $20,000 (not to
mention its aesthetic value) and that the shade they
provide constitutes a "non-negligible saving in air
conditioning" for the offices adjoining the courtyard.
Also, Bracewell's co-campaigner, Eric Hutchinson,
secretary of the Faculty Senate, has said "they mean a
lot to the people here," including faculty, students
and staff who over the years have helped themselves
to fresh fruit directly from the trees.
Bracewell's letter also cited two recent, costly
examples of landscaping problems in the Quad.
More than 200 cypress trees died, and in 1972, follow
ing exceptionally cold weather, so did several Lilly
Pilly trees. Both groups of trees had to be removed at
high cost to the University. The avocados outlived
them both.
"Delayed costs can be incurred by those charged
with fresh plantings," said Bracewell's letter, addres
sing the topic of relandscaping.
Vice-President for Business and Finance, William
Massey, explained his concern that the money spent
to save the trees might be wasted because they might
not survive the construction anyway. "The money
saved, while not that great an amount, might be
enough to keep a faculty member or two around fora
year," said Massy.
Herb Fong, University arborist and grounds super
visor, said he and his ground crews could ensure the
safety of the trees by pruning the trees and wrapping
their branches prior to the construction. "It would be
a shame to cut them down," said Fong of the trees
which he estimates are 75 years old.
The University has until lanuary 15 to inform con
tractor Ralph Larsen & Son of their final decision
about the fate of the avocado trees.
