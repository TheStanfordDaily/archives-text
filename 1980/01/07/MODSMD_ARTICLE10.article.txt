# Soviets blame detente 'collapse' on U.S.
## 
### 
Moscow — Soviet officials and analysts,
convinced of the Tightness of their
policies, are digging in for a prolonged
period of tension with the United States.
They put the collapse of detente at Pres
ident jimmy Carter's doorstep and insist
the United States has no business expres
sing indignation over the recent events in
Afghanistan. They say on the one hand
that they must act to protect themselves
from U.S.-inspired encirclement, while at
the same time they say Washington will
regret taking on Moscow, because Ameri
can power is no longer what it was.
In a series of private, unattributable
conversations with middle-level Com
munist Party officials, the Soviets invari
ably came back last week to the theme that
Carter's foreign policy has no continuity
and said this zigzagging, as they see it, is
the root cause of bilateral difficulties —
not Afghanistan.
The Kremlin leadership, in its first direct
statement since the Afghanistan invasion,
yesterday bluntly rejected Carter's sanc
tions as "a hopeless undertaking that will
flop" and made clear the Kremlin is ready
for a severe deterioration of relations as
the price of its military action.
The Soviet leaders, in a lengthy un
signed statement issued through the offi
cial Tass press agency, said Carter's jan. 4
retaliation "lacks political balance, lacks
real consideration of the international
situation and overestimates the real
potentialities of the United States" while

underestimating Soviet strength.
"If the White House decided to influ
ence in some way the Soviet Union, its
foreign policy, this is a hopeless undertak
ing," the leadership declared. Moscow
said the president'sactions would hurt the
United States more than Russia, made
clear the Kremlin has no intention of giv
ing up Afghanistan and asserted Carter
acted because of re-election fears.
The statement, which Tass said it was
"authorized" to transmit, leaving no
doubt as to its source, is the first official
leadership response to Carter since the
controversial "hotline" exchange Dec. 8
between the president and Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev in the midst of the
Soviet-backed coup in Kabul. The leader
ship declaration shows more starkly than
anything the Russians have said through
their controlled media that the Kremlin
does not shrink from either world con
demnation or confrontation with
Washington over the invasion.
Without referring directly to previous
Soviet contentions that the pro-Marxist
Kabul government sought their interven
tion, the leadership asserted that all know
"the Afghan people alone and nobody
else (have) the right to decide its internal
development." They said Carter's sanc
tion speech, in which he embargoed 17
million tons of grain to Russia, cut other
trade, science and cultural exchanges and
reiterated that Carter's attempt to delay
SALT-II ratification shows "gross interfer

ence in Afghanistan's internal affairs."
The Soviet leaders avoided the Soviet
media's shrill personal attacks on Carter,
but like earlier Soviet responses so far to
the crisis, did not indicate if the Kremlin
itself may undertake any specific bilateral
steps in response to the president's ac
tions. There is speculation here that the
leadership, despite its tough stance, has
been stung and is carefully watching the
U.N. Security Council debate over the in
vasion, and the related Iranian-crisis de
bate before contemplating any further
moves of the Kremlin's own.
The Kremlin leaders said Carter "is heat
ing the passions of those circles in the U.S.
long displeased with detente. It looks not
(like) a statement of the person holding
the highest government post in the U.S.,
but rather that of a candidate embarking
on another round of the election cam
paign."
They accused Carter of using the Tehran
embassy crisis for "blackmail and threats
against Iran," their "neighbor," and
strongly indicated Moscow would veto
any economic sanctions by the U.N. Sec
urity Council against Iran. In a new at
tempt at gaining favor with AyatoJlah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who has strongly
condemned the Moscow invasion, the
leaders asserted, "Washington clearly
cannot stomach the revolution made by
the Iranian people, (or their) intention to
oppose imperialist policy of threats and
diktat."

leadership, despite its tough stance, has
been stung and is carefully watching the
U.N. Security Council debate over the in
vasion, and the related Iranian-crisis de
bate before contemplating any further
moves of the Kremlin's own.
The Kremlin leaders said Carter "is heat
ing the passions of those circles in the U.S.
long displeased with detente. It looks not
(like) a statement of the person holding
the highest government post in the U.S.,
but rather that of a candidate embarking
on another round of the election cam
paign."
They accused Carter of using the Tehran
embassy crisis for "blackmail and threats
against Iran," their "neighbor," and
strongly indicated Moscow would veto
any economic sanctions by the U.N. Sec
urity Council against Iran. In a new at
tempt at gaining favor with AyatoJlah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who has strongly
condemned the Moscow invasion, the
leaders asserted, "Washington clearly
cannot stomach the revolution made by
the Iranian people, (or their) intention to
oppose imperialist policy of threats and
diktat."
Moscow — Soviet officials and analysts,
convinced of the Tightness of their
policies, are digging in for a prolonged
period of tension with the United States.
They put the collapse of detente at Pres
ident jimmy Carter's doorstep and insist
the United States has no business expres
sing indignation over the recent events in
Afghanistan. They say on the one hand
that they must act to protect themselves
from U.S.-inspired encirclement, while at
the same time they say Washington will
regret taking on Moscow, because Ameri
can power is no longer what it was.
In a series of private, unattributable
conversations with middle-level Com
munist Party officials, the Soviets invari
ably came back last week to the theme that
Carter's foreign policy has no continuity
and said this zigzagging, as they see it, is
the root cause of bilateral difficulties —
not Afghanistan.
The Kremlin leadership, in its first direct
statement since the Afghanistan invasion,
yesterday bluntly rejected Carter's sanc
tions as "a hopeless undertaking that will
flop" and made clear the Kremlin is ready
for a severe deterioration of relations as
the price of its military action.
The Soviet leaders, in a lengthy un
signed statement issued through the offi
cial Tass press agency, said Carter's jan. 4
retaliation "lacks political balance, lacks
real consideration of the international
situation and overestimates the real
potentialities of the United States" while

underestimating Soviet strength.
"If the White House decided to influ
ence in some way the Soviet Union, its
foreign policy, this is a hopeless undertak
ing," the leadership declared. Moscow
said the president'sactions would hurt the
United States more than Russia, made
clear the Kremlin has no intention of giv
ing up Afghanistan and asserted Carter
acted because of re-election fears.
The statement, which Tass said it was
"authorized" to transmit, leaving no
doubt as to its source, is the first official
leadership response to Carter since the
controversial "hotline" exchange Dec. 8
between the president and Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev in the midst of the
Soviet-backed coup in Kabul. The leader
ship declaration shows more starkly than
anything the Russians have said through
their controlled media that the Kremlin
does not shrink from either world con
demnation or confrontation with
Washington over the invasion.
Without referring directly to previous
Soviet contentions that the pro-Marxist
Kabul government sought their interven
tion, the leadership asserted that all know
"the Afghan people alone and nobody
else (have) the right to decide its internal
development." They said Carter's sanc
tion speech, in which he embargoed 17
million tons of grain to Russia, cut other
trade, science and cultural exchanges and
reiterated that Carter's attempt to delay
SALT-II ratification shows "gross interfer

ence in Afghanistan's internal affairs."
The Soviet leaders avoided the Soviet
media's shrill personal attacks on Carter,
but like earlier Soviet responses so far to
the crisis, did not indicate if the Kremlin
itself may undertake any specific bilateral
steps in response to the president's ac
tions. There is speculation here that the
leadership, despite its tough stance, has
been stung and is carefully watching the
U.N. Security Council debate over the in
vasion, and the related Iranian-crisis de
bate before contemplating any further
moves of the Kremlin's own.
The Kremlin leaders said Carter "is heat
ing the passions of those circles in the U.S.
