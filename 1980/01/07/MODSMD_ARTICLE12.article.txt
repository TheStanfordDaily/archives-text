# Candidates clash in Iowa

### 
Des Moines, lowa (AP) — Six
Republican presidential candi
dates, jockeying in debate
Saturday night, forsook unity
on the crisis in Iran and then
took verbal jabs at the man
who wasn't there — campaign
frontrunner Ronald Reagan.
The Republicans criticized
President jimmy Carter's
foreign policy as creating the
conditions that led to the tak
ing of U.S. hostages in Tehran,
but they differed on whether to
pose specific alternatives to
Carter's efforts to free the
Americans.
One candidate, Sen. Bob
Dole of Kansas, called the sei
zure of the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran an "act of war," and
urged tougher economic sanc
tions. But several other candi
dates declined to offer specific
proposals, indicating they
feared it would weaken Car
ter's hand.
The debate of GOP candi
dates for the 1980 presidential
nomination came a little more
than two weeks before the
lowa caucuses which will be
the first step toward choosing
delegates to the Republican
National Convention.
The candidates differed on
energy and tax policy, on
whether the United States has
become militarily inferior to
the Soviet Union and in their
responses to Carter's decision
to cut off most U.S. grain
shipments to the Russians.
And in his closing statement,
Rep. John Anderson of Illinois
accused his rivals of dealing in

vague generalities and said the
country was tired of "politi
cians by and large playing poli
tics in the same old way."
Reagan criticized
Early in the debate, spon
sored by the Des Moines Regis
ter and Tribune, the GOP
hopefuls chided Reagan for
not showing up.
"I wish Governor Reagan
were here. Oh, do I wish he
were here," said former Texas
Gov. )ohn Connally. "I really
don't know how he stands on
the issues. I must say to you I
read, I watch, I listen, but I
don't hear much. I don't see
much. If he were here I'd be
delighted to compare notes
with him."
Anderson said the real
reason Reagan was not in the
debate was that he has nothing
different to say in America than
he did in 1%4 and 1968.
Reagan, the former Califor
nia governor who is the
acknowledged GOP frontrun
ner, refused to participate in
the lowa debate, calling it "di
visive" because it "pits Repub
lican against Republican."
Unity dissolved
In fact, Republican unity fell
aparton the very firstquestion.
Asked what they would do to
win freedom for U.S. hostages
being held in Tehran, their
answers were in sharp .con
trast.
Connally proposed a
stronger military presence in
the Persian Gulf area and Dole
called for an embargo of all
commerce with I ran except es

sential medical supplies.
But Rep. Philip Crane of Il
linois, who was the first candi
date to speak, said, "I don't
think it's appropriate for us to
be speaking to specific solu
tions to the (hostage) prob
lem."
Sen. Howard of Ten
nessee called the hostage situ
ation a "symptom" of a failed
foreign policy and added, "I
think the world has perceived
thatweare weak. "Still, he said
he would not now "second
guess" Carter's handling of the
situation.
The debate was televised by
the Public Broadcasting System
and broadcast nationally on
radio. During the two-hour
debate, candidates answered
questions from a panel of four
news reporters for 80 minutes
and then from the audience.
