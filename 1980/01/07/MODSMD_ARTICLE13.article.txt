# Fellowships here praised
## Jobs await English Ph. D. students 
### Krisan Froelich 
The last 15 years brought a
glut ot humanities college
graduates to the job market. Be
tween the recessions, oil crises
and surges of unemployment,
the overqualified English Ph.D.
driving a taxicab has become
almost a cliche in the American
lexicon.
All seven students who
graduated from Stanford last
year with doctorates in English
found jobs. Three took assis
tant professorships at the Uni
versity of Virginia, the Univer
sity of Ottawa in Canada, and
Chico State University in
California. Two found instruc
torships at St. Lawrence Uni
versity in New York and here.
One is working as an editor in a
San Francisco publishing
house, and the last works in
Green Library.
"Nationally, 64 percent of
the people graduating with
doctorates in English find full
time teaching positions," said
Bill Chace, director of place
ment for the English graduate
department. "But Stanford's
average is closer to 70 or 80
percent."
While jobs are scarce, ad
missions are still tight. More
than 200 people apply for
roughly 12 spots in Stanford's
program. "We usually admit'
around 20 to fill those places,"
said David Riggs, admissions
chairman for the department.
"Competition here is compar
able to the Ivy League."
Not many Stanford
graduates apply here, because

generally they aren't admitted.
"There is a strong presumption
that if you've done your un
dergraduate work here, it's
better to be exposed to
another place, although we do
consider special cases," said
Albert Gelpi, director of
graduate studies for the En
glish department.
Riggs thinks Stanford's at
tractive feature is that
everyone admitted receives a
fellowship. "There are enough
funds so that the average per
son is guaranteed money all
four years," he explained.
"Many schools will reallocate
the funds every year." Here,
since the fellowship is con
stant, students aren't compet
ing with one another for
money.
Fellowship
The fellowship includes tui
tion and a stipend of approxi
mately $3000 a year. "Part of
the stipend is for support and
part is in return for teaching,"
Gelpi explained. In addition to
a section of a large English
class, students must teach two
freshman English courses.
Many students find the
funds inadequate. "It's a real
pinch for a lot of students to
make it," Gelpi said, "but then
I don't know of any program
which completely supports
students for all four years."
The Ph.D. program here is
relatively small. "About six or
seven years ago, we cut back
the number of people because
the number of jobs was de
creasing," Gelpi said.

On the average, students
write 20 to 40 letters to find a
position. "Early on the de
partment took seriously the re
sponsibility to get our people
jobs," Gelpi said. "Even with
the tight market, we've been
able to place, but not always in
tenure track jobs."
So why are students under
taking four to five years of hard
work with no guarantee of a
job at the other end?
"On their applications, most
students say they've heard the
warnings, but they want to
study literature and they want a
Ph.D.," Gelpi explained.
"They think they'll be one of
the lucky ones. But after stu
dents get here, I think they

start wondering and doubt
ing." Flowever, very few drop
out.
Work experience
Nick Bromell, a second-year
student here working toward a
Ph.D. in Classics and
Philosophy, said living and
working in a university were
his deciding factors. After
graduating from Amherst Col
lege in 1972, Bromell worked
for Harvard University Press.
"I knew the job market was
tight, but if you have some
work experience, there's a
wide variety of jobs a Ph.D. can
help you get," he explained.
"At a university press it's prac
tically impossible to get a
