## Foundation pushes prisoners' rights 
### 
A new non-profit corpora
tion has been formed, called
the Freedom Foundation In
ternational. The primary pur
pose and objective of this or
ganization is to provide legal
assistance to indigent, inno
cent persons who are incarcer
ated all over the world, starting
with the United States, in ob
taining post-conviction review,
appeal and vindication of their
innocence through the courts
and legal aid.
The need for this type of or
ganization is consistent with
the fact that between one and
three percent of all people in
carcerated in the United States
afe actually innocent. That
means that of the 300,000 in
carcerated in the United
States, between 3000 and 9000
are living a daily hell they do
not deserve because of a mis
carriage of justice, mostly the
result of economic depriva
tions.
Within the last two decades,
civil and constitutional rights
of prisoners have been greatly
Increased, but there is evi
denced a corresponding de
crease in the advocacy of those
rights. This is simply due to the
fact that most prisoners are in
digent and cannot afford the
cost of obtaining competent
advocacy.
While government grants
have been made to fund civil

rights and legal aid groups, it is
difficult and mostly impossible
for prisoners to obtain the
political support necessary to
obtain such grants. Con
sequently, a dynamic social
need is evidenced in the ad
ministration of justice for fund
ing that will ensure equal pro
tection of the law for the indi
gent prisoner who is hand
icapped by poverty and politi
cal anonymity in obtaining ad
vocacy to vindicate his civil and
constitutional rights.
Thus, the purpose,
philosophy and objective of
this organization is to establish
a viable means to overcome
these handicaps to provide the
indigent prisoner the same
protection and benefits of the
law accorded all othercitizens.
While the Freedom Founda
tion International is a charita
ble organization that is not
presumed to be any more de
serving of charity than many
other charitable organizations,
it does represent a unique
dynamic social cause, founded
upon no less than the funda
mental, individual rights of
every person to liberty, free
dom and the pursuit of happi
ness that have been guaran
teed by both our States' and
the United States constitu
tions.
Unfortunately, these con
stitutions do not supply the

funds for persons handicap
ped by poverty to obtain com
petent counsel and/or appel
late or post-conviction review
from the courts as provided by
law. The Freedom Foundation
International will raise these
funds, primarily through be
nefit concerts.
I can cite many examples
which are classic, such as Pitts
and Lee, who walked free from
death row in Florida after the
State learned it had the wrong
men for a murder they wanted
solved. What would have hap
pened to these men if the State
hadn't discovered its mistake?

And then there is Isidore
Zimmerman, the man in the
New York State penal system
who was on death row before
his sentence was commuted to
life and after 20 years of im
prisonment, the State said,
"we are sorry, we have the
wrong man"! And I could go
on and on!
If you would like to help this
timely organization and can
donate only part of your
energy, write now. Something
has to be done and done now.
