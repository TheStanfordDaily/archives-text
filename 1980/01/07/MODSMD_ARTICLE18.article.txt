The legitimacy of human civil
rights is not debatable. Every
citizen is entitled to housing,
employment and public ac
commodations free from fear
of selective, arbitrary exclu
sion.
The public must be given
every opportunity to discuss
the facts of homosexuality, to
meet homosexuals in the
community, and to hear about
the experiences of homosexu
als' lives. But there are no
"sides" to the fact that all law
abiding citizens have inaliena
ble rights.
The people must see that
they never are diverted or mis
led by any forensically dis
guised attempt to establish and

proceed from the false
hypothesis that rights are
privileged goods to be doled
out now and then by condes
cending bureaucrats. Rights by
definition are beyond the au
thority of anyone to give or
take away: they belong in
nately to a person simply be
cause he/she is human.
Any pretense of objective
discussion which nevertheless
subtly implies that basic rights
are optional or subject to
"compromise" or dole is no
thing but a desperate, crafty at
tempt to legitimize continued
falsehoods, hatred and dis
crimination. The people of San
lose and Santa Clara County
must recognize any such at
tempt and reject it. Cay people
are not asking for permission
to be themselves; they are de
manding recognition of what
already is theirs.
