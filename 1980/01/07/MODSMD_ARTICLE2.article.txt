# Trustees 'rubber stamp' proposals
## Tuition, room, board costs up 12.2% 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
As expected general tuition, room
and board charges will increase $972,
from $7949 to $8921, next fall follow
ing rubber-stamp approval of the
administration requested hike by the
Board of Trustees last month.
The 12.2 percent increase was ap
proved by the board with virtually no
controversy or debate, according to
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs.
The increase was part of a package
of tuition, room and board increase
requests the administration submit
ted to the board. All requests were
approved.
Tuition will rise $690 from $5595 to
$6285, a 12.3 percent increase. Room
and full board charges will rise $282
from $2354 to $2636, a 12 percent
jump.
The administration also won ap
proval for a 20 percent increase in
tuition for new medical students.
Continuing medical students' tuition
will, like general tuition, rise 12.3
percent.
Tuition paid, then, will rise $1224
for new medical students — from
$6114 to $7338 — and $753 for return
ing ones — to $6867.
Law School tuition will rise $690,
from $5774 to $6434, keeping to its
usual formula of a $150 surcharge on
general tuition.
Students in the Graduate School of
Business pay the general tuition rate.
The University is traditionally the

first major private university to an
nounce its tuition increases, doing
so after every December board meet
ing.
Late last month, however,
Washington University of St. Louis
announced it would increase tuition
next fall 12.5 percent and Cornell
said it was considering an 11.5 per
cent increase, tne University News
Service reported.
Rosenzweig said that while trus
tees did not voice acute concern over
the tuition increases they approved
last month, "there has been forsome
years now a general concern about
the rate at which tuition has been
rising."
He said the board has standing in
structions to the administration to
keep the increases as low as possible
and to monitor the effects of the tui
tion rate on the quality and size of the
applicant pool and students admit
ted.
Admissions office statistics have
indicated the rise in tuition has not
deterred more students from apply
ing or enrolling.
This year, for example, 64 percent
of students admitted actually enrol
led, a figure topped only by Harvard.
Harvard is one of the three institu
tions nationwide which actually
charges more than Stanford in tui
tion, room and board.
In addition, an overwhelming 84
percent of those admitted to Stan
ford but enrolling elsewhere chose

other private institutions.
At the Medical School, a 20 percent
tuition increase for new medical stu
dents will provide the base for tuition
increases for students enrolling from
now on, while the base for students
already matriculated will be 6.5 per
cent lower.
David Hopkins, assistant dean for
administration at the Medical School
said last month that theextraordinary
increase was needed to bring tuition
into line with an administration pol
icy that tuition pay for 22 percent of
the cost of medical education.
General tuition pays 50 percent of
the cost of educating the students

who pay it.
The 22-percent figure was the per
centage that tuition paid for in the
mid-19705. Since then, however, the
contribution of tuition to the medical
school budget has eroded to 17 per
cent, Hopkins said.
Applying the 20 percent increase
just to new students is part of a prog
ram of phasing in the 22-percent-of
cost policy over the next few years.
Rosenzweig said, "I don't think
there is anyone on the board who
would not like to see a lower tuition
rate." But he added that he doesn't
think anyone on the board has any
better way of paying the bills.
