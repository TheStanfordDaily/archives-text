# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Aleen Zimberoff Explore Third World reality 
### 
The Third World. As a diligent
Stanford student who took
Political Science 35 freshman
year, that was the name used to
describe the poor nations we
extended foreign aid to; third
world countries were "lesser
developed countries," and I
believe I might have men
tioned them on a midterm or
something. But aside from a
hasty drive through Tijuana on
my way to Mazatlan last
Christmas, the third world did
not exist in my life.
I have recently returned to
the Villa in Florence from our
mid-quarter break in Tunisia.
For those of you who shake
your heads and wonder if
Tunisia is a new kind of taco or
suburb of Bangkok, let me give
you a brief geography lesson:
Tunisia is a small "LDC" on the
northeastern coast of Africa. As
our guide Hemm so accurately
commented, "Tunisia makes a
little bit of everything, and no
thing very well."
The trip was exciting for
most of us. Camel rides, wild
marketplaces filled with exotic
clothes (a la White Plaza on
good days), Roman ruins and
catacombs, and a jaunt to the
Sahara for a few daring adven
turers. But, the aftertaste is bit
ter.
I feel a profound sense of in
justice tainting the postcards
and trinkets carried home. My
memories and impressions are
clouded by the glimpses and
glances I managed behind the

tourist attractions. And in exa
mining these feelings, I began
to discover some frightening
attitudes held by myself, and
my peers, about our lives.
I question whether many of
us at Stanford every really stop
to appreciate our lifestyle. A
bad draw in the housing lottery
means Manzanita, and life
sucks. We eat at Stern for a
month and our parents hear
about surprise meatloaf as if
the world wereending. I know.
I bitch when a flat tire requires
an early walk in the rain across
campus. How does Tunisia re
late to these familiar scenes,
you wonder.
We live in a paradise, by in
ternational standards anyway.
Aside from the AP summary
and scattered leaflets protest
ing human rights in some fara
way country, we are personally
unaffected by the reality that
millions of people are struggl
ing to survive on 59 cents a day.
Sure, I knew what poverty was
â€” I read about it in Time
magazine. But an article is
finished and put back in the
rack; it's a little difficult to be
surrounded by begging chil
dren scrambling for candy or a
few cents for torn pockets.
The third world is not merely
a term defining an economic
condition or technological in
feriority. Real people are suf
fering. I saw tiny mud streets
paved with children who
should've been in kindergar
ten; I saw women shrouded in

veils draping their faces and
more tragically, their freedom;
I saw shadows of men
exhausted with a day spent
herding sheep through the vil
lage. And my Nikon hung idle
because a slideshow could not
possibly capture the look in
their eyes. Vet for the most
part, I did not see bitterness,
just a fierce tenacity to survive.
I realize that my perspective
is clouded. I haven't done my
emotional laundry yet. The
smells and sights are still vivid,
the realizations freshly scrib
bled to friends. But right now,
the Peace Corps looks good to
me; so does a house in
Sausalito. I suppose what I am
saying is that Stanford doesn't
have to culminate with a mutu
ally exclusive choice.
What the trip did for me was
to sharpen my commitment to
more than a "career," more
than the LSATs, more than
sound investments on Wall
Street. Tunisia provided a rare
education that was as stimulat
ing, revealing and challenging
as any course I've encountered
thus far. And the "test" will
continue for the rest of my life.
I went to Tunisia. I will go
back, at least to a place with
similar conditions, but next
time as a participant in an ac
tive capacity, instead of as a
tourist. The opportunity to
share my impressions is ap
preciated.
