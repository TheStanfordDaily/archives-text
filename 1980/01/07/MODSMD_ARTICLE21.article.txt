## Keep asking why: '70s philosophic inquiry 
### 
During my freshman year at
Stanford, I noticed a sign in my
physics class that said simply,
"KEEP ASKING WHY." Looking
back upon the past decade of
life on The Farm, it appears that
this species of inquiry has be
come less and less common
since the late 19605. During
that period, campus turmoil
challenged the mind of each
student at Stanford. In those
years students searched for
answers that would provide a
foundation for their lives. To
day, no one even asks the
questions.
If nothing in our mundane
existence provokes us to an
opinion about life, we can only
hold ourselves responsible.
We must ask what gives our
lives purpose. What is our ful
fillment? What can be done
about our inability to live up to
our own ideals? And where is a
source of strength and stabil
ity?
The gravity of these ques
tions cannot be passed over
lightly. This is the most
momentous decision we will
ever face. Our presuppositions
shape not only the quality and
meaning of our lives, but also
our very destiny.
During the dawn of the
seventies, the search for
answers varied from Existen

tialism to the Jesus movement.
"After the turmoil of the six
ties," writes Christian scholar
Dr. Francis Schaeffer, "many
people thought that it was so
much better when the univer
sities quieted down in the early
seventies. I could have wept.
The young people had been
right in their analysis, though
wrong in their solutions. How
much worse when many
people gave up hope and sim
ply accepted the same values
as their parents â€” personal
peace and affluence."
Today, at the dawn of the
eighties, students are hostile to
anything that questions their
lifestyles of pleasure and the

drive to succeed. The vague,
nebulous answers that we live
by today are all things which at
the last must be swallowed up
in death.
The radical difference bet
ween Existentialism and Christ
ianity illustrates our need to
examine the meaning of exis
tence. It is possible that our
race may be a protoplasmic ac
cident living our brief exis
tence uncared for in a mean
ingless universe controlled
solely by chance.
Or, it is possible that in our
search to find meaning within
ourselves, we have fallen far
short of being loving men and
women, and therefore God

sent His only Son out of love
for us so that through His sac
rifice and Lordship in our lives
we might become the people
that we were meant to be.
Both of these examples are
possible. Either would have a
profound effect upon some
one who lived by them.
But those who are open
minded enough to believe ev
erything, in reality, believe no
thing. We must decide what we
believe and then strive for con
sistent application in our daily
lives. Without a consistent
philosophy that provides
meaning in our lives and ac
tions, we shall have no direc
tion in life.

Philosophic inquiry is not a
meaningless study but rather a
search to find meaning in our
studies. Our years at Stanford
are meant to provide an
academic atmosphere that en
courages thought and inquiry.
It is absurd to think that in
our frenzy to acquire high
paying degrees, we do not
have the time to think about
the fundamental way in which
we view our world.
"As a man thinketh, so he
is." College is our opportunity
to search for answers. Keep
asking why!
