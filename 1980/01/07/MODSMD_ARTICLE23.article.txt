## No time to 'rally 'round the flag boys' 
### 
The faces on the cover of the
Nov. 26 Time magazine were
familiar enough; by the time
that particular issue hit the
newsstands I had all but
memorized the faces of Ayatol
lah Khomeini and Jimmy Car
ter, as had almost everyone
else who had been following
the Iranian situation. Yet this
particular rendering of the two
leaders was somehow diffe
rent.
Khomeini's image caught my
attention first; his face, drawn
in a side view, took up almost
all of the space on the cover.
Beneath an ominous black tur
ban the ayatollah's blood red
eyes stared out contemptu
ously. His skin was an other
wordly grey-green, and the
corners of his mouth turned

downward, enhancing the
cruelty of the rest of his face.
Carter's image, on the other
hand, was rendered with a
photograph that was dwarfed
in size by the towering face of
the Imam. The president
looked concerned and deter
mined, yet somehow compas
sionate. Perhaps the white
light that illuminated his face
gave me this impression, espe
cially as it caused the photo to
stand out in stark contrast to
the darkness and harshness of
Khomeini's encompassing im
age.
Khomeini's Time image fol
lows a time honored tradition
in America of portraying the
leaders of "enemy" nations as
grotesque and inhuman. As in
the past, the people of this

country have constructed a
melodrama involving the ex
tremes of good and evil, with
Khomeini — who was recently
portrayed by political car
toonist Mac Nelly as the Devil
himself — as the villain. He and
the Iranian people have be
come symbolic of evil, of
fanaticism run amok. And we
are pleased to be united
against them.
In my opinion, this melod
ramatic view is absolutely irra
tional; Khomeini is, if any
thing, a tragic character. He is
caught in a longstanding
morass of political and moral
outnges that will give histo
rians in the future plenty to
write about.
America has contributed its
fair share to the situation by in

stalling a murderous dictator
who ignored the human rights
and the religion of his people.
By using Iran to further our
energy and arms industries we
helped the shah to push his
country into the technological
age before it was prepared to
deal with such radical social
changes.
And now that we are being
humiliated in front of the\fcorld
we are responding by making
Khomeini and the Iranians a
scapegoat while ignoring the
incredible lack of morality with
which we have conducted our
foreign policy.
Of course, none of this les
sens the outrageousness of the
embassy take-over. Nor does it
make Khomeini's lies and his
marshalling of hate any less

contemptible. But it does
mean that this is no time to
"rally 'round the flag, boys."
As a nation we should realize
that Iran is a product of our ar
rogantand immoral foreign
policy. We should write letters
to Washington demanding that
any self-righteous military re
sponse be ruled out, especially
since such a response will in no
way save the precious lives of
the hostages.
Finally, in the future we
should pay a bit more attention
to the foreign policies cooked
up by our leaders. It has be
come apparent that the sins of
a nation do indeed return.
