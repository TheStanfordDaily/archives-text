# Virginia entrepreneurs market gasohol stills

Norfolk, Va. — The way Andy
Butler and John Phillips see it,
there is a stovetop still in your
future.
But it isn't likely that ax
toting prohibitionists will
come breaking into your
kitchen to hack up any
homemade brew — this stuff is
for your gas tank.
These two young entrep
reneurs aren't kidding, either.
They've staked their savings on
it.
If it weren't for the coils and
gauges coming out of the con
traptions, you could probably
cook chili in those big
aluminum pots — but they're
for making high-grade fuel al
cohol instead. And Butler says

they are selling like crazy for
$99.95 each from his
warehouse — or $130 in retail
outlets.
"We chose Plexiglas as a sig
nificant component," he said.
"It leaves a distinctive plastic
taste and odor. We didn't want
anybody to consider us a
tongue-in-cheek whiskey-still
manufacturer. We're very seri
ous about what we are doing."
A person could cook up a
batch of gasohol on the
kitchen range during a
weekend, Butler said, and use
it either of two ways to extend
automobile fuel.
"You can inject it 150-proof
directly into the carburetor
using a water-injector," he
said. "With approximately one

gallon of alcohol for a tankful
of gas, you'll get a 20 percent
increase in mileage. That's how
I use it in my car. The second
way is to mix it directly with gas
— one gallon of alcohol for
nine gallons of gas. The injec
tion method gives you an in
crease in mileage; mixing with
gas does not."
However, the problem in
some states, Butler said, is that
it is still illegal for an individual
to own a fuel-producing still.
But he hopes that will change
soon.
"Many state legislatures ha
ven't met since the federal
government decided to en
courage the manufacturer of
gasohol fuel," Butler said, "In
several states, we've sent in
terested legislators copies of
other state laws."
In states where it is legal,
the only thing needed
is a federal permit, Butler
said. His company, Victory
Still Inc., will even supply the
application form when the

purchase is made. The com
pany does not recommend
using the still until the permit is
obtained.
"First, you need a trash can
to ferment the mash," Butler
said, in describing the man
ufacturing process. "You need
vegetables — any vegetable
containing starch. Potatoes,
corn, apples or peaches. You
need enough to get a 15-20
percent alcohol-by-volume
reading. A bushel of corn and
30 gallons of water will pro
duce 2Vi gallons of pure
ethanol when fermented. You
grind the corn, mix with water
and add yeast. Five days later,
you'll have what they call
mash.' You process the 'mash'
through the still in five-gallon
batches. The still separates the
alcohol from water.
But does it pay? After all,
fresh vegetables aren't cheap
either. "There are ways to
scrounge," he said. "One man
in North Carolina made an ar
rangement with his grocer to

pick up vegetables and fruits
that are going bad. In Maine
you can buy 'culls' — potatoes
they can't use on the market —
at 50 cents a barrel."
"The early models were in
teresting," Butler said. "We
came up with a cooling
chamber design — to cool the
alcohol — that was designed to
sit on the table, or the neck of
the collection jar. It was a cy
linder with coils running
through it on the neck of the
bottle, with the collection
hose. It never occurred to us
that the dead weight from the
water would exert pressure far
in excess of atmospheric pres
sure — we must have had 50
pounds per square inch. It
blew every seal in the system.
But we didn't realize what was
happening — we were too
tipsy from the fumes."
These prototypes, he said,
probably cost about $4000 in
mistakes, but the two were
convinced they had a solid,
marketable idea.
