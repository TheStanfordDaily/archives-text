### 
Gail Tietjen, a 1978 Stan
ford graduate, was killed
last week when her Pinto
was hit head-on by a drink
ing driver going the wrong
way on Highway 85 in
Cupertino.
I Seven years earlier, Tietjen
had suffered major head in
juries when her date
crashed his Porsche after he
had been drinking. That ac
cident left her mentally
handicapped, but she
gradually regained her per
sonality and independence.
Tietjen studied art here
and graduated with a
bachelor'sdegree. Shetried
to tackle the heavy loads in
science courses, but she
was plagued by learning
disabilities caused by the
head injuries.
Before the accident, Tiet
jen had been a homecom

ing princess and a National
Honor Society member.
She dreamed of being a
doctor. The car accident
came just a few weeks after
she graduated from high
school with two scholar
ships to attend Stanford.
After the accident, she
was dependent, insecure
and needed constant atten
tion, according to family
members. She slowly
learned to take care of her
self again and in 1975, she
learned how to laugh again.
Everything seemed to be
going the right direction.
Then, Tuesday night, she
was killed in the wreck. Ar
rested on suspicion of man
slaughter and felony driving
while underthe influence of
alcohol was Beth June
O'Donnell, a 59-year-old
nurse.
