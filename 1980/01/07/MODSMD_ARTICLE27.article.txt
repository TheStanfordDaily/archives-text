# Is Quechua spoken here?

He is probably the only man
on campus who can speak at
length about Nahautl, Yapese
and Quechua.
They are languages, and
John Metcalfe can tell you all
about them.
Metcalfe is director of the
Stanford language laboratory,
a teaching facility with a dizzy
ing array of foreign language
tapes used by thousands of
students seeking to unravel the
mysteries of other cultures.
Perhaps the most interesting
part of the lab is the 61 -year-old
Metcalfe, who holds the whole
operation together with verve
and a taste for the unique.
"A great part of this job is to
try to find tapes of any lan
guage any student needs,"
Metcalfe says. "Sometimes,
that's quite a challenge." A re
cent search led him to the Ang

lican Church of Canada before
he found a set of tapes for one
student â€” now mastering the
intricacies of "James Bay
Cree," spoken by 30,000 Cree
Indians in Saskatchewan, On
tario and Manitoba.
World-traveler
Metcalfe has been director
of the Stanford language lab
since 1972 and brings to the job
a background in instrumenta
tion engineering and, perhaps
more importantly, 22 years of
seeing the world while in the
Navy. During those years he
toured extensively through the
Orient, Australia and Europe,
and developed an appreciation
for the diverse cultures of the
world, an appreciation that
bordered on marvel.
"Japan is without a doubt the
most sensual part of the
world," Metcalfe says. "Their

consideration for aesthetics
over material things is striking.
Even in their eating and ba
thing, their attitude is 'This is
the time we enjoy,' unlike in
the United States, where it's a
mechanical thing, a lump in the
day."
It was this fascination with
culture and the interaction of
that culture with language that
brought Metcalfe to the lan
guage lab seven years ago.
Other cultures
He sees his job as giving stu
dents an opportunity to ap
preciate other cultures. "Many
of these students are at that
perfect age right between the
academic world and the real
world," he says,"and they're
seeking to understand other
people a little better. I like
being a part of that."
But he is not detached from
the student's role, and that is
Metcalfe's charm. Like an avid
student, Metcalfe recognizes
that language offers clues to
the mysteries of a foreign cul
ture, and seems to revel in
their discovery. "One
wouldn't expect to find much
sophistication in the language


Language lab director John Metcalfe points with pride to one of the
pieces of audio equipment in the lab at Meyer Undergraduate Lib-

rary. One of Metcalfe's many tasks as direc tor is to find tapes of any
language a student requests, a job that is often "quite a challenge."
