# Is Quechua spoken here?
## 
### Lee Hochberg 
He is probably the only man
on campus who can speak at
length about Nahautl, Yapese
and Quechua.
They are languages, and
John Metcalfe can tell you all
about them.
Metcalfe is director of the
Stanford language laboratory,
a teaching facility with a dizzy
ing array of foreign language
tapes used by thousands of
students seeking to unravel the
mysteries of other cultures.
Perhaps the most interesting
part of the lab is the 61 -year-old
Metcalfe, who holds the whole
operation together with verve
and a taste for the unique.
"A great part of this job is to
try to find tapes of any lan
guage any student needs,"
Metcalfe says. "Sometimes,
that's quite a challenge." A re
cent search led him to the Ang

lican Church of Canada before
he found a set of tapes for one
student — now mastering the
intricacies of "James Bay
Cree," spoken by 30,000 Cree
Indians in Saskatchewan, On
tario and Manitoba.
World-traveler
Metcalfe has been director
of the Stanford language lab
since 1972 and brings to the job
a background in instrumenta
tion engineering and, perhaps
more importantly, 22 years of
seeing the world while in the
Navy. During those years he
toured extensively through the
Orient, Australia and Europe,
and developed an appreciation
for the diverse cultures of the
world, an appreciation that
bordered on marvel.
"Japan is without a doubt the
most sensual part of the
world," Metcalfe says. "Their

consideration for aesthetics
over material things is striking.
Even in their eating and ba
thing, their attitude is 'This is
the time we enjoy,' unlike in
the United States, where it's a
mechanical thing, a lump in the
day."
It was this fascination with
culture and the interaction of
that culture with language that
brought Metcalfe to the lan
guage lab seven years ago.
Other cultures
He sees his job as giving stu
dents an opportunity to ap
preciate other cultures. "Many
of these students are at that
perfect age right between the
academic world and the real
world," he says,"and they're
seeking to understand other
people a little better. I like
being a part of that."
But he is not detached from
the student's role, and that is
Metcalfe's charm. Like an avid
student, Metcalfe recognizes
that language offers clues to
the mysteries of a foreign cul
ture, and seems to revel in
their discovery. "One
wouldn't expect to find much
sophistication in the language


Language lab director John Metcalfe points with pride to one of the
pieces of audio equipment in the lab at Meyer Undergraduate Lib-

rary. One of Metcalfe's many tasks as direc tor is to find tapes of any

called 'New Guinea Pidgin,'
spoken by as few people as it
is," he says. "Yet, in its dictio
nary is one word defined as
the 'second wicket passed
through in the game of cric
ket.' It's not hard," he says with
the look of a child discovering
candy, "to figure out which na
tion colonized New Guinea."
Just as language reflects the
characteristics of the culture,
so does the absence of culture
result in the death of language.
Metcalfc anxiously makes the
point.
Artificial language
"Look what happened to Es
peranto (an Indo-European
language without the ir
regularities of all indigenous
Indo-European languages,
created almost a century ago
by Russian scholar Ludwig
Zamenhof). It was created to
be an international language,

but it is sterile and has no cul
ture behind it, and never truly
caught on." Given the chance,
Metcalfe will tell you that only
one million persons worldwide
speak Esperanto, despite the
logic of the language and the
efforts of an international or
ganization based in nearby
Hayward, Calif., to prom
ote that language. And even
Esperanto has been more suc
cessful than Ido (an artificial
Mandarin language) or any of
two dozen other artificial lan
guages.
Metcalfe loves his laborat
ory. Lest language students
grow too cocky after a long
tape session, however, he cau
tions that mastery of language
does not supplant real mastery
of a people's culture. "So many
interpreters are shot down de
spite their book knowledge of
two or three languages," he
says. "They don't know the cul

ture, and learning a culture can
take a lifetime."
The lab director advises to
day's economics or engineer
ing students to master English
and French, and business stu
dents to learn Japanese. Apart
from its obvious practical value
in the 1980 s business world,
Japanese is easy for Americans
to learn, Metcalfe says, be
cause it includes many of the
same sounds as English.
Speaks little
As for the million-dollar
question — how many lan
guages does Metcalfe speak?
— the answer is somehow dis
appointing. "I'm afraid I only
speak one, and that's English,"
he admits. "I have some con
trol of Mediterranean Dutch
that I picked up overseas, but
that's my limit." Metcalfe
blames a weak foundation in
grade school grammar for his
failure to attain more foreign

language skill.
But don't let that fool you.
Metcalfe knows more about
the world's 3000 languages
than he would care to admit.
)ust when one thinks he has
exhausted Metcalfe's know
ledge, the man begins anew.
"I'll tell you about Nahautl —
it's an old Mexican language.
We got tapes of that one from
the University of Texas," or
"Yapese is spoken by about 50
natives on the island of Yap,
about 500 miles south of
Hawaii — actually, that was an
important American protecto
rate during World War II," or
"You ever heard of Quechua?
It's the most widely spoken In

about seven million people in
Bolivia and Peru." Where else

ing array of foreign language
tapes used by thousands of
students seeking to unravel the
mysteries of other cultures.
Perhaps the most interesting
part of the lab is the 61 -year-old
Metcalfe, who holds the whole
operation together with verve
and a taste for the unique.
"A great part of this job is to
try to find tapes of any lan
guage any student needs,"
Metcalfe says. "Sometimes,
that's quite a challenge." A re
cent search led him to the Ang

lican Church of Canada before
he found a set of tapes for one
student — now mastering the
intricacies of "James Bay
Cree," spoken by 30,000 Cree
Indians in Saskatchewan, On
tario and Manitoba.
World-traveler
Metcalfe has been director
of the Stanford language lab
since 1972 and brings to the job
a background in instrumenta
tion engineering and, perhaps
more importantly, 22 years of
seeing the world while in the
Navy. During those years he
toured extensively through the
Orient, Australia and Europe,
and developed an appreciation
for the diverse cultures of the
world, an appreciation that
bordered on marvel.
"Japan is without a doubt the
most sensual part of the
world," Metcalfe says. "Their

consideration for aesthetics
over material things is striking.
Even in their eating and ba
thing, their attitude is 'This is
the time we enjoy,' unlike in
the United States, where it's a
mechanical thing, a lump in the
day."
It was this fascination with
culture and the interaction of
that culture with language that
brought Metcalfe to the lan
guage lab seven years ago.
Other cultures
He sees his job as giving stu
dents an opportunity to ap
preciate other cultures. "Many
of these students are at that
perfect age right between the
academic world and the real
world," he says,"and they're
seeking to understand other
people a little better. I like
being a part of that."
But he is not detached from
the student's role, and that is
Metcalfe's charm. Like an avid
student, Metcalfe recognizes
that language offers clues to
the mysteries of a foreign cul
ture, and seems to revel in
their discovery. "One
wouldn't expect to find much
sophistication in the language


Language lab director John Metcalfe points with pride to one of the
pieces of audio equipment in the lab at Meyer Undergraduate Lib-

rary. One of Metcalfe's many tasks as direc tor is to find tapes of any

called 'New Guinea Pidgin,'
spoken by as few people as it
is," he says. "Yet, in its dictio
nary is one word defined as
the 'second wicket passed
through in the game of cric
ket.' It's not hard," he says with
the look of a child discovering
candy, "to figure out which na
tion colonized New Guinea."
Just as language reflects the
characteristics of the culture,
so does the absence of culture
result in the death of language.
Metcalfc anxiously makes the
point.
Artificial language
"Look what happened to Es
peranto (an Indo-European
language without the ir
regularities of all indigenous
Indo-European languages,
created almost a century ago
by Russian scholar Ludwig
Zamenhof). It was created to
be an international language,

but it is sterile and has no cul
ture behind it, and never truly
caught on." Given the chance,
Metcalfe will tell you that only
one million persons worldwide
speak Esperanto, despite the
logic of the language and the
efforts of an international or
ganization based in nearby
Hayward, Calif., to prom
ote that language. And even
Esperanto has been more suc
cessful than Ido (an artificial
Mandarin language) or any of
two dozen other artificial lan
guages.
Metcalfe loves his laborat
ory. Lest language students
grow too cocky after a long
tape session, however, he cau
tions that mastery of language
does not supplant real mastery
of a people's culture. "So many
interpreters are shot down de
spite their book knowledge of
two or three languages," he
says. "They don't know the cul

ture, and learning a culture can
take a lifetime."
The lab director advises to
day's economics or engineer
ing students to master English
and French, and business stu
dents to learn Japanese. Apart
from its obvious practical value
in the 1980 s business world,
Japanese is easy for Americans
to learn, Metcalfe says, be
cause it includes many of the
same sounds as English.
Speaks little
As for the million-dollar
question — how many lan
guages does Metcalfe speak?
— the answer is somehow dis
appointing. "I'm afraid I only
speak one, and that's English,"
he admits. "I have some con
trol of Mediterranean Dutch
that I picked up overseas, but
that's my limit." Metcalfe
blames a weak foundation in
grade school grammar for his
failure to attain more foreign

language skill.
But don't let that fool you.
Metcalfe knows more about
the world's 3000 languages
than he would care to admit.
)ust when one thinks he has
exhausted Metcalfe's know
ledge, the man begins anew.
"I'll tell you about Nahautl —
it's an old Mexican language.
We got tapes of that one from
the University of Texas," or
"Yapese is spoken by about 50
natives on the island of Yap,
about 500 miles south of
Hawaii — actually, that was an
important American protecto
rate during World War II," or
"You ever heard of Quechua?
It's the most widely spoken In
dian language, spoken by
about seven million people in
Bolivia and Peru." Where else
on the Stanford campus can
one hear a soliloquy quite like
this?
He is probably the only man
on campus who can speak at
length about Nahautl, Yapese
and Quechua.
They are languages, and
John Metcalfe can tell you all
about them.
