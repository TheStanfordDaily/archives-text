More than 35 years ago, The
Stanford Daily installed an As
sociated Press teletype machine.
Until this morning, the Daily re
lied on one wire service and that
same machine to supplement its
own news with reports from
around the world.
But after 35 years, we decided
to modernize a bit. So we've
taken another step into the elec
tronic age by acquiring a new As
sociated Press teleprinter
machine which transmits our AP

wire copy on a newer, less fragile
machine (and we've kept the old,
original AP machine for posterity.)
In addition, this morning you
will be reading some copy from
our new wire service — the Los
Angeles Times/Washington Post
News Service. Our new Extel tele
printer for this service will give us
news, sports, features and enter
tainment copy from the 800 repor
ters and editors of those papers to
add to our own local news and
features.
