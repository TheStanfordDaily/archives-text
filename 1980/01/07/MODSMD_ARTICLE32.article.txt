# Bright triumph clashes with dark defeats
## Where, when will Card men find themselves? 
### Chris Haft 
In the Pacific Southwest Air
lines terminal at San Jose's
Municipal Airport Dec. 27,
Terry Smith, guard on Stan
ford's men's basketball team,
and Brian Dißiaso, son of head
coach Dick Dißiaso, were en
gaged in a game of backgam
mon while waiting to board a
flight to Los Angeles for the
Cardinals' contests against
USC and UCLA.
Smith had the younger Di-
Biaso soundly beaten. Brian
Dißiaso rolled double fives,
but could not move because
Smith had the first available
space blocked.
Coach Dißiaso, who had just
learned to play backgammon,
asked why Brian could not take
advantage of the roll. Both
Smith and Brian explained the
situation to Dißiaso, who had
some slight difficulty under
standing the rule.
One can't blame Dißiaso if
he has similar difficulty under
standing his enigmatic basket
ball team. In their first four
Pacific-10 Conference games,
the 3-9 Cards sandwiched im
pressive efforts — a 69-68 loss
to USC Dec. 28 and a 99-80
romp over Arizona Saturday at
Maples Pavilion — around
dismal defeats to UCLA (92-60,
Dec. ?9) and Arizona State (70-
64, Jan. 3).
Because the Cards lack the
overall talent of a team like
Oregon State, whose players
could probably dunk while
immersed underwater or hit a
25-footer during an ear
thquake, they must play intel
ligently to even have a chance
at winning. Turnovers
spawned by indecision or

foolishness and poorly
selected shots have to become
almost absent from the Cards'
play.
Any fool, of course, can
comprehend that mistake-free
basketball will likely result in
victory. And in the Arizona
triumph, the Cards played in
near-flawless fashion. Among
the factors contributing to
their conquest was their low
turnover total of 13.
"The noticeable lack of tur
novers on our part. . . kept us
in the game," Dißiaso said.
By contrast, the UCLA and
ASU games provided examples
of how turnovers spoil an
otherwise good effort. Against'
the Bruins, Smith sped for a
breakaway dunk with 4:46 left
in the first half to give Stanford
a 24-23 lead. However, UCLA
followed by generating two
steals on press plays that
sparked a 16-2 Bruin onslaught
over the next four minutes.
Stanford trailed the Sun De
vils by only 28-25 with less than
a minute left in the half. Yet by
halftime, the Cards were be
hind 32-25 — thanks to two in
stant turnovers coupled with a
pair of Byron Scott's 22-foot
jumpers. Stanford went on to
amass 27 turnovers, an atroci
ous figure.
To avoid such a preponder
ance of errors, the Cards must
have constant activity from
their point guards, starter
Doug Marty and reserve Peter
Lallas. Neither of them are Bob
Cousys or "Magic" Johnsons
as passers, but they don't have
to be as long as they are able to
keep moving the ball and ex
changing it from side to side.
"We weren't so stagnant

passing the ball around the
perimeter," forward Brian
Welch said after Saturday
night's victory, implying that
offensive success begins and
ends with the guards.
Another shortcoming the
Cards have to deal with is their
depth, which is questionable
in quality. The list of reserve
players on other schools who
could conceivably start for or
help the Cards is endless.
In the 32-point loss to the
Bruins, Stanford's bench
scored 16 points. UCLA's sub
stitutes poured in 55.
"It seemed like every sub
stitution we made . . . picked
(us) up," Bruin coach Larry
Brown said.
"Eventually it (lack of depth)
is going to catch up to you,"
Dißiaso said after the UCLA
loss.
Significantly enough, the
Card bench outscored the
Wildcat subs 18-12 in Satur
day's winning performance.
Five different Stanford re
serves scored, while John
Smith was the only reserve to
produce points for Arizona. Six
of sub Doug Barnes' eight
points for the Cards came dur
ing their 60-40 second-half
splurge.
"It was a tremendous effort
by the bench," Dißiaso said.
"They made a difference com
ing in — they contributed as
opposed to coming in and
maintaining the status quo."
The Cards have had reason
able success upsetting the
status quo when it comes to
limiting the opposition's top
player to below-average effec
tiveness.
USC's Purvis Miller, averag

ing 18.1 points per game when
the Trojans met Stanford, tal
lied just eight points (two in the
first half) and got so frustrated
that he picked a fight with Kim
berly Belton. UCLA's Kiki Van
deweghe, scoring over 20
points a game, got only 13
against Stanford. After hitting
seven of nine shots in the first
half Saturday, Arizona's Joe
Nehls sank only two of 13 at
tempts after intermission.
ASU's6-foot-10Kurt Nimphius,
who collected 25 points and 12
rebounds against the Cards,
was the only standout that gave
Stanford trouble.
But when Belton, the Cards'
own star, is throttled, the re
sults are usually disastrous. His
27-point, 17-rebound perfor
mance keyed the Arizona
triumph, and his absence
leaves an enormous void in the
Card lineup.
At USC, Belton ripped
through the Trojans for 16
first-half points, leading Stan
ford to a 35-33 halftime advan
tage. USC, however, paid Bel
ton considerable attention
thereafter. Only 8:14 remained
when he got his first basket in
the second half, and by that
time USC had surged to a 59-52
lead.
Belton fouled out of the ASU
game with 5:47 to go after scor
ing 22 points and grabbing 12
rebounds. The Cards trailed
58-51 at the time, and even
though they closed to within
61-58 minutes later, their com
eback try was missing its most
important ingredient — Bel
ton. Even ASU coach Ned Wulk
attested to Belton's value.

"That (Belton's fouling out)
was very definitely a big factor
in the game," Wulk said. "Bel
ton is tremendous and has al
ways given us a hard time."
The Cards, too, maintain the
potential to give other teams a
hard time. Belton, as Wulk
said, is tremendous. Welch's
arching jumpers ought to be
immortalized in poetry for
their beauty. Sophomores
Marty and Orlando Ward con
tinue to gain assertiveness on

the court. Smith provides
crowd-pleasing and, at least
against Wyoming, game
winning hustle. Freshman
center David Nussbaum has a
lot to learn, but the only other
players his size with his shoot
ing touch are in the NBA. Larry
Harris always seems to give the
team a lift with a steal or a bas
ket. Barnes, Lallas, Steve Cran
dell, Jeff Ryan and Tom
Schmalzried all have had mo
ments of brilliance in the past,

and there is no reason why
they can't repeat them.
"Every year there's a break
where you start to play better
— I hope this is now," Belton
said Saturday.
Yet will this "break" and the
aforementioned Card assets be
enough in the improved,
talented Pac-10? It's just like
backgammon — double fives is
a good roll, but if your oppo
nent has you cornered, it's use
less.

No, Orlando Ward (42) and Brian Welch (35) are not performing some intricate dancing maneuver.
Rather, they are battling for a rebound. And each player has distinguished himself in recent action. In his
last seven games, Ward is averaging 12.4 points and 8.7 rebounds. Welch has scored 47 points in the last
two games while hitting 20 of 31 shots from the floor.
