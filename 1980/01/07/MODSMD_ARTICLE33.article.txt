# Super Bowl: It's Pitt and LA
## Disputed call aids Steelers 
### 
Pittsburgh (AP) — Terry Brad
shaw, stung by Vernon Perry's
75-yard interception return in
the opening minutes, burned
Houston with two touchdown
passes yesterday and the
Pittsburgh Steelers charged
into the Super Bowl with a con
troversial 27-13 victory over the
Oilers.
The game may have turned
on the touchdown pass that
didn't count — a 6-yard throw
from Houston quarterback
Dan Pastorini to wide receiver
Mike Renfro, who caught the
ball behind cornerback Ron
Johnson in the right corner of
the end zone in the closing mi
nute of the third period. Side
judge Donald Orr at first made
no signal, then made a waving
motion to indicate that Renfro
had come down out of bounds.
Television replays, however,
indicated that both of Renfro's
feet had been in bounds. But
despite Houston's vehement
protests, the decision stood
and the Oilers had to settle for

Toni Fritsch's 23-yard field goal
that opened the fourth period
and cut Pittsburgh's to
four points, 17-13. A
touchdown would have wiped
it out.
The Oilers got no closer.
Matt Bahr's second field goal
of the game, a 39-yarder, re
stored Pittsburgh's seven
point lead, then Rocky Bleier
sealed the Oilers' doom with a
4-yard touchdown run 54 sec
onds from the final gun, and
the Steelers had their second
successive American Football
Conference Championship
victory over the Oilers. Last
year, the Steelers romped 34-5
en route to their 35-31 triumph
over Dallas in the Super Bowl.
Bradshaw brought the Steel
ers from an early 10-3 deficit
with his scoring strikes of 16
yards to tight end Bennie Cun
ningham and 20 yards to All-
Pro wide receiver John
Stallworth in the second
period.
Those passes and the con
troversial call by Orr obliter
ated the Oilers' dreams of a
championship upset, built on
Perry's early heroics.
The Houston strong safety,
who had a playoff-record four
interceptions eight days ago in
the Oilers' 17-14 upset of San
Diego, picked off a poorly
thrown Bradshaw pass and ran
it a record 75 yards to open the
scoring exactly 2Vi minutes
into the game.
Except for Fritsch's 27-yard
field goal for Houston 48 sec
onds into the second period
and the 23-yarder in the fourth

quarter, the Oilers' offense —
especially running back Earl
Campbell — was relatively
dormant.
Campbell, the National
Football League's rushing
champion in each of his two
years in the league, gained
only 15 yards on 17carries. Pas
torini, under constant pressure
and knocked out of the game
for one play midway in the
third period, completed 19 of
28 passes tor 203 yards.
Bradshaw, meanwhile,
completed 18 of 30 passes for
219 yards, while Franco Harris
punched out 85 yards on 21
carries in the balanced Steel
ers' offense.
