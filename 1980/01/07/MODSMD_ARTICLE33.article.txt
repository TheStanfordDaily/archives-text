# Super Bowl: It's Pitt and LA
## Disputed call aids Steelers 
### 
Pittsburgh (AP) — Terry Brad
shaw, stung by Vernon Perry's
75-yard interception return in
the opening minutes, burned
Houston with two touchdown
passes yesterday and the
Pittsburgh Steelers charged
into the Super Bowl with a con
troversial 27-13 victory over the
Oilers.
The game may have turned
on the touchdown pass that
didn't count — a 6-yard throw
from Houston quarterback
Dan Pastorini to wide receiver
Mike Renfro, who caught the
ball behind cornerback Ron
Johnson in the right corner of
the end zone in the closing mi
nute of the third period. Side
judge Donald Orr at first made
no signal, then made a waving
motion to indicate that Renfro
had come down out of bounds.
Television replays, however,
indicated that both of Renfro's
feet had been in bounds. But
despite Houston's vehement
protests, the decision stood
and the Oilers had to settle for

Toni Fritsch's 23-yard field goal
that opened the fourth period
and cut Pittsburgh's to
four points, 17-13. A
touchdown would have wiped
it out.
The Oilers got no closer.
Matt Bahr's second field goal
of the game, a 39-yarder, re
stored Pittsburgh's seven
point lead, then Rocky Bleier
sealed the Oilers' doom with a
4-yard touchdown run 54 sec
onds from the final gun, and
the Steelers had their second
successive American Football
Conference Championship
victory over the Oilers. Last
year, the Steelers romped 34-5
en route to their 35-31 triumph
over Dallas in the Super Bowl.
Bradshaw brought the Steel
ers from an early 10-3 deficit
with his scoring strikes of 16
yards to tight end Bennie Cun
ningham and 20 yards to All-
Pro wide receiver John
Stallworth in the second
period.
