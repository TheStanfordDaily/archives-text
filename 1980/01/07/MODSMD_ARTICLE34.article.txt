# Rams outlast Bucs, 9-0

### 
Tampa, Fla. (AP) — Frank
Corral kicked three field goals
and the Los Angeles Rams
ended six years of frustration
yesterday with a 9-0 victory
over the Tampa Bay Buc
caneers that gave them the Na
tional Football Conference
championship and a berth in
the 1980 Super Bowl.
Corral connected from 19
and 21 yards in the second
quarter and added a clinching
23-yarder in the fourth period,
moving the Rams into the Jan.
20 title game against the de
fending champion Pittsburgh
Steelers.
It will be the first time the
Rams will play for the National
Football League championship
since 1951, when they won the
title. Four times in the past five
years they reached the confer
ence title game only to be
eliminated one step short of
the Super Bowl.
In their fifth try they made it
on defense, completely throttl
ing the Bucs and ending Tampa
Bay's Cinderella season. With

All-Pro defensive end Jack
Youngblood playing despite a
hairline fracture of his left leg,
the Rams' defenders played in
spired football and rarely al
lowed Tampa Bay to threaten.
The closest call the Rams had
came when Corral, the kicker,
made a touchdown-saving
tackle against Isaac Hagins fol
lowing the first Los Angeles
field goal. Corral was the last
Los Angeles defender and
caught Hagins with a rolling
tackle at the Bucs' 29.
Twice the Rams seemed to
have touchdowns, only to lose
them on decisions by the offi
cials. First an apparent 4-yard
TD run by Cullen Bryant was
nullified by an illegal motion
penalty, then Preston Dennard
grabbed a 20-yard pass from
Vince Ferragamo in the end
zone but was ruled out of
bounds before he had posses
sion of the ball.
It was the first time in NFC
history that no touchdowns
were scored in a championship
game.
The first quarter was Score
less, but late in the period the
Rams launched a drive that car
ried them to the Tampa Bay
1-yard line.
The big play in the march was
a 35-yard pass by Ferragamo to
Dennard on a third-and-13
situation at the Tampa Bay 39.
Bryant went in from the 4 on
the next play, but the
touchdown was nullified and
the Rams were pushed back to
the 9. Wendell Tyler picked up
3 yards, putting Los Angeles at

the 1, but when two plays failed
to dent the Bucs' end zone, Los
Angeles settled for Corral's
19-yard field goal on the first
play of the second quarter.
The teams exchanged punts
twice before Ferragamo got the
Rams moving again. The young
quarterback, starting only his
seventh pro game because of
an injury to Pat Haden, com
pleted five straight passes in a
drive that was culminated by
Corral's 21-yard field goal with
47 seconds left in the first half.
Three of the completions in the
drive went to Charles Young,

who caught only 13 passes all
season.
That gave Los Angeles a 6-0
halftime lead, but the impor
tant statistic was possession
time. Tampa Bay had control
led the ball for only 9:16, com
pared to 20:44 for Los Angeles.
Doug Williams, Tampa Bay's
second-year quarterback, mis
sed on his first eight passes —
and when he finally threw one
that was complete, it was for no
gain. At halftime, Williams had
completed 2 of 12 for 12 yards,
compared to 10 of 17 for 143
yards for Ferragamo.
