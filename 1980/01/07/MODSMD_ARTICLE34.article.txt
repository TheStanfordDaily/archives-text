# Rams outlast Bucs, 9-0
## 
### 
Tampa, Fla. (AP) â€” Frank
Corral kicked three field goals
and the Los Angeles Rams
ended six years of frustration
yesterday with a 9-0 victory
over the Tampa Bay Buc
caneers that gave them the Na
tional Football Conference
championship and a berth in
the 1980 Super Bowl.
Corral connected from 19
and 21 yards in the second
quarter and added a clinching
23-yarder in the fourth period,
moving the Rams into the Jan.
20 title game against the de
fending champion Pittsburgh
Steelers.
It will be the first time the
Rams will play for the National
Football League championship
since 1951, when they won the
title. Four times in the past five
years they reached the confer
ence title game only to be
eliminated one step short of
the Super Bowl.
In their fifth try they made it
on defense, completely throttl
ing the Bucs and ending Tampa
Bay's Cinderella season. With

All-Pro defensive end Jack
Youngblood playing despite a
hairline fracture of his left leg,
the Rams' defenders played in
spired football and rarely al
lowed Tampa Bay to threaten.
The closest call the Rams had
came when Corral, the kicker,
made a touchdown-saving
tackle against Isaac Hagins fol
lowing the first Los Angeles
field goal. Corral was the last
Los Angeles defender and
caught Hagins with a rolling
tackle at the Bucs' 29.
Twice the Rams seemed to
have touchdowns, only to lose
them on decisions by the offi
cials. First an apparent 4-yard
TD run by Cullen Bryant was
nullified by an illegal motion
penalty, then Preston Dennard
grabbed a 20-yard pass from
Vince Ferragamo in the end
zone but was ruled out of
bounds before he had posses
sion of the ball.
It was the first time in NFC
history that no touchdowns
were scored in a championship
