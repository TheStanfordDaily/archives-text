## Easterners prove rough 
### Rick Ostiller 
Providence, R.I. â€” When the
Stanford men's basketball
team headed to New jersey to
open a three-game road trip,
few of the Cards had heard of
the new Big East Conference.
But after seven days and three
losses to league members, the
Cardinals knew more about
the new conference than they
ever wanted to ask.
Sorely missing the services
of Daryle Morgan, who frac
tured his foot in the Cards'
67-66 loss to San )ose State
Dec. 15, Stanford first lost to
Seton Hall, 72-55, then finished
last in the Industrial National
Classic by dropping back-to
back contests to Providence,

58-46, and Boston College,
97-89.
The Cards came to South
Orange, New Jersey with a 2-3
record that included consecu
tive losses to Portland (Dec. 8,
66-59) and San Jose State.
Waiting to host Stanford
were the Seton Hall Pirates,
owners of a 3-3 record and
charter members of the new
Big East Conference.
Formed this past year to
showcase the best in Eastern
basketball, the Big East in
cludes Syracuse, Georgetown,
Connecticut, St. John's, Seton
Hall, Providence and Boston
College. Last season, five of
the teams were 20-game win
ners, and were in post-season

tournaments. Although Seton
Hall, Providence and Boston
College are tabbed as the
league's worst teams, Stanford
soon found them to be good
enough.
Seton Hall lived up to its
nickname, as the Pirates stole
the ball from the Cards 17
times.
Stanford jumped off to a 12-9
lead after eight minutes only to
see the advantage disappear
under an avalanche of turnov
ers. In the next four minutes,
the Pirates made four steals
and ran off a 17-3 spurt to take a
26-15 lead, and after that they
never looked back. At
halftime, Stanford trailed 33-23
