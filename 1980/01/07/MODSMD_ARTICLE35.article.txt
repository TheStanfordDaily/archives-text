## Easterners prove rough 
### Rick Ostiller 
Providence, R.I. — When the
Stanford men's basketball
team headed to New jersey to
open a three-game road trip,
few of the Cards had heard of
the new Big East Conference.
But after seven days and three
losses to league members, the
Cardinals knew more about
the new conference than they
ever wanted to ask.
Sorely missing the services
of Daryle Morgan, who frac
tured his foot in the Cards'
67-66 loss to San )ose State
Dec. 15, Stanford first lost to
Seton Hall, 72-55, then finished
last in the Industrial National
Classic by dropping back-to
back contests to Providence,

58-46, and Boston College,
97-89.
The Cards came to South
Orange, New Jersey with a 2-3
record that included consecu
tive losses to Portland (Dec. 8,
66-59) and San Jose State.
Waiting to host Stanford
were the Seton Hall Pirates,
owners of a 3-3 record and
charter members of the new
Big East Conference.
Formed this past year to
showcase the best in Eastern
basketball, the Big East in
cludes Syracuse, Georgetown,
Connecticut, St. John's, Seton
Hall, Providence and Boston
College. Last season, five of
the teams were 20-game win
ners, and were in post-season

tournaments. Although Seton
Hall, Providence and Boston
College are tabbed as the
league's worst teams, Stanford
soon found them to be good
enough.
Seton Hall lived up to its
nickname, as the Pirates stole
the ball from the Cards 17
times.
Stanford jumped off to a 12-9
lead after eight minutes only to
see the advantage disappear
under an avalanche of turnov
ers. In the next four minutes,
the Pirates made four steals
and ran off a 17-3 spurt to take a
26-15 lead, and after that they
never looked back. At
halftime, Stanford trailed 33-23
after shooting a frigid 33 per
cent from the field.
In the second half, the Cards
warmed up to 57 percent as
Kimberly Belton recorded all 11
of his points, but it went for
naught as the Stanford defense
could not cool down Seton
Hall's Clark Young and Dan
Callandrillo.
Young finished with 24
points, while Callandrillo tal
lied 21 points, five assists and
six steals. Brian Welch and Or
lando Ward led Stanford with
14 points each. Pirate center
Dan Dunne provided the most
entertaining play of the game,
when he rebounded a missed
Card shot and put the ball right
back up at the Stanford basket.
Unfortunately for the Cards,
Dunne missed the two-foot
jumper.
After a brief practice and rest
stop in snowy New York, Stan
ford took off for Providence,
Rhode Island, and the Indust
rial National Classic. Only in its
fourth year, the Classic has be
come one of the East's best
Christmas tournaments, and
this year was no exception as
top-ranked Duke, host Provi
dence and undefeated Boston
College joined the Cards.
Stanford drew Providence in
the first round. Providence
possesses a great basketball
tradition, but the Friars were
coming off a 10-10 season and
worse was expected this year.
Yet under first-year coach Gary
Walters, the team employed a
stifling defense to jump off to a
4-2 record. That defense
proved decisive in the Friar vic
tory, as Stanford recorded its
lowest scoring total in four
years.
Providence won because its
defense stopped the Cards'
one-two punch of Welch and
Belton. Welch hit only three of

15 shots for seven points, while
Belton was held to five, season
lows for both players. The only
bright spot for Stanford was
Ward, who played the entire 40
minutes while recording 19
points and 10 rebounds, the
scoring figure a collegiate
career high.
Stanford had hoped to play
Duke, and the Cards almost
got their chance anyway. In the
nightcap of the doubleheader,
the Blue Devils needed a
jumper with two seconds re
maining to force an overtime
before outlasting Boston Col
lege for a 70-64 win.
Matters were not much
easier in the finals, but Duke
held off Providence to win the
title, 62-58. As for Boston Col
lege, the Eagles had to be satis
fied with a date with Stanford
for third place.
Nobody likes consolation
games and the Cards hoped
Boston College would be par
ticularly down after the tough
loss the previous night. The
Eagles came out blazing, how
ever, and they took a 27-14 lead
midway through the first half as
forward Mike Bennett scored
14 of his 20 points. The Cards
cut the lead to 47-38 at inter
mission, as Belton muscled for
nine points. It was the senior
forward's best half of the trip,
but as it turned out he had only
started to warm-up.
The Eagles flew out of the
gate in the second half also,
but this time guard Dawn
Chandler had the hot hand. He
pumped in 10 points on a vari
ety of drives and jump shots as
Boston College went on an 18-9
tear in the first five minutes to
put the game out of reach at
65-47.
Although it was too late to
win, the Cards made it respect
able by dominating play over
the final 15 minutes and out

scoring the Eagles 42-32. Belton
poured in 20 of those points as
he totalled 32 for the game,
along with 11 rebounds. The
second-half performance left
one feeling that had Stanford
played the same way in either
of the first two games, the
Cards would not have suffered
through a winless trip.
Stanford also got a lift from
the fine play of Terry Smith,
who netted 12 points in 15 mi
nutes of play. Smith, the
6-foot-4 freshman swingman,
sat out the first two games of
the trip with a pulled hamstr
ing, but once again proved his
value to the team by sparking
the Cards' second-half surge.
The Boston College game
also provided a chance for
David Nussbaum, Larry Harris
and Doug Barnes to exhibit
their talents. Nussbaum, the
6-10 freshman center, played
well in his second consecutive
start with four points, three re
bounds and two blocked shots
while continuing to gain ex
perience.
Harris, a 6-1 guard, scored
six points, played tough de
fense and displayed good
quickness, something the
Cards lack desperately with
Morgan sidelined.
Barnes, the senior guard,
canned three long jumpers,
proving why he is considered
the best shooter on the team.
Although no one wants to
lose five straight going into
league play, the Cards can fee
confident coming off one c
their best games and having fi
nally found their most com
petitive lineup.
And, after their three per
formances on the road trip,
things could be a lot worse.
The Cards could be in the Big
Fast Conference where they
would already be in the league
basement at 0-3.

Stanford jumped off to a 12-9
lead after eight minutes only to
see the advantage disappear
under an avalanche of turnov
ers. In the next four minutes,
the Pirates made four steals
and ran off a 17-3 spurt to take a
26-15 lead, and after that they
never looked back. At
halftime, Stanford trailed 33-23
after shooting a frigid 33 per
cent from the field.
In the second half, the Cards
warmed up to 57 percent as
Kimberly Belton recorded all 11
of his points, but it went for
naught as the Stanford defense
could not cool down Seton
Hall's Clark Young and Dan
Callandrillo.
Young finished with 24
points, while Callandrillo tal
lied 21 points, five assists and
six steals. Brian Welch and Or
lando Ward led Stanford with
14 points each. Pirate center
Dan Dunne provided the most
entertaining play of the game,
when he rebounded a missed
Card shot and put the ball right
back up at the Stanford basket.
Unfortunately for the Cards,
Dunne missed the two-foot
jumper.
After a brief practice and rest
stop in snowy New York, Stan
ford took off for Providence,
Rhode Island, and the Indust
rial National Classic. Only in its
fourth year, the Classic has be
come one of the East's best
Christmas tournaments, and
this year was no exception as
top-ranked Duke, host Provi
dence and undefeated Boston
College joined the Cards.
Stanford drew Providence in
the first round. Providence
possesses a great basketball
tradition, but the Friars were
coming off a 10-10 season and
worse was expected this year.
Yet under first-year coach Gary
Walters, the team employed a
stifling defense to jump off to a
4-2 record. That defense
proved decisive in the Friar vic
tory, as Stanford recorded its
lowest scoring total in four
years.
Providence won because its
defense stopped the Cards'
one-two punch of Welch and
Belton. Welch hit only three of

15 shots for seven points, while
Belton was held to five, season
lows for both players. The only
bright spot for Stanford was
Ward, who played the entire 40
minutes while recording 19
points and 10 rebounds, the
scoring figure a collegiate
career high.
Stanford had hoped to play
Duke, and the Cards almost
got their chance anyway. In the
nightcap of the doubleheader,
the Blue Devils needed a
jumper with two seconds re
maining to force an overtime
before outlasting Boston Col
lege for a 70-64 win.
Matters were not much
easier in the finals, but Duke
held off Providence to win the
title, 62-58. As for Boston Col
lege, the Eagles had to be satis
fied with a date with Stanford
for third place.
Nobody likes consolation
games and the Cards hoped
Boston College would be par
ticularly down after the tough
loss the previous night. The
Eagles came out blazing, how
ever, and they took a 27-14 lead
midway through the first half as
forward Mike Bennett scored
14 of his 20 points. The Cards
cut the lead to 47-38 at inter
mission, as Belton muscled for
nine points. It was the senior
forward's best half of the trip,
but as it turned out he had only
started to warm-up.
The Eagles flew out of the
gate in the second half also,
but this time guard Dawn
Chandler had the hot hand. He
pumped in 10 points on a vari
ety of drives and jump shots as
Boston College went on an 18-9
tear in the first five minutes to
put the game out of reach at
65-47.
Although it was too late to
win, the Cards made it respect
able by dominating play over
the final 15 minutes and out

scoring the Eagles 42-32. Belton
poured in 20 of those points as
he totalled 32 for the game,
along with 11 rebounds. The
second-half performance left
one feeling that had Stanford
played the same way in either
of the first two games, the
Cards would not have suffered
through a winless trip.
Stanford also got a lift from
the fine play of Terry Smith,
who netted 12 points in 15 mi
nutes of play. Smith, the
6-foot-4 freshman swingman,
sat out the first two games of
the trip with a pulled hamstr
ing, but once again proved his
value to the team by sparking
the Cards' second-half surge.
The Boston College game
also provided a chance for
David Nussbaum, Larry Harris
and Doug Barnes to exhibit
their talents. Nussbaum, the
6-10 freshman center, played
well in his second consecutive
start with four points, three re
bounds and two blocked shots
while continuing to gain ex
perience.
Harris, a 6-1 guard, scored
six points, played tough de
fense and displayed good
quickness, something the
Cards lack desperately with
Morgan sidelined.
Barnes, the senior guard,
canned three long jumpers,
proving why he is considered
the best shooter on the team.
Although no one wants to
lose five straight going into
league play, the Cards can fee
confident coming off one c
their best games and having fi
nally found their most com
petitive lineup.
And, after their three per
formances on the road trip,
things could be a lot worse.
The Cards could be in the Big
Fast Conference where they
would already be in the league
basement at 0-3.
Providence, R.I. — When the
Stanford men's basketball
team headed to New jersey to
open a three-game road trip,
few of the Cards had heard of
the new Big East Conference.
But after seven days and three
losses to league members, the
Cardinals knew more about
the new conference than they
ever wanted to ask.

67-66 loss to San )ose State
Dec. 15, Stanford first lost to
Seton Hall, 72-55, then finished

Classic by dropping back-to

The Cards came to South
Orange, New Jersey with a 2-3
record that included consecu

basketball, the Big East in

Connecticut, St. John's, Seton
Hall, Providence and Boston
College. Last season, five of
the teams were 20-game win

tournaments. Although Seton

Yet under first-year coach Gary
Walters, the team employed a
stifling defense to jump off to a
4-2 record. That defense
proved decisive in the Friar vic
tory, as Stanford recorded its
lowest scoring total in four
years.
Providence won because its
defense stopped the Cards'
one-two punch of Welch and
Belton. Welch hit only three of

15 shots for seven points, while
Belton was held to five, season
lows for both players. The only
bright spot for Stanford was
Ward, who played the entire 40
minutes while recording 19
points and 10 rebounds, the
scoring figure a collegiate
career high.
Stanford had hoped to play
Duke, and the Cards almost
got their chance anyway. In the
nightcap of the doubleheader,
the Blue Devils needed a
jumper with two seconds re
maining to force an overtime
before outlasting Boston Col
lege for a 70-64 win.
Matters were not much
easier in the finals, but Duke
held off Providence to win the
title, 62-58. As for Boston Col
lege, the Eagles had to be satis
fied with a date with Stanford
for third place.
Nobody likes consolation
games and the Cards hoped
Boston College would be par
ticularly down after the tough
loss the previous night. The
Eagles came out blazing, how
ever, and they took a 27-14 lead
midway through the first half as
forward Mike Bennett scored
14 of his 20 points. The Cards
cut the lead to 47-38 at inter
mission, as Belton muscled for
nine points. It was the senior
forward's best half of the trip,
but as it turned out he had only
started to warm-up.
The Eagles flew out of the
gate in the second half also,
but this time guard Dawn
Chandler had the hot hand. He
pumped in 10 points on a vari
ety of drives and jump shots as
Boston College went on an 18-9
tear in the first five minutes to
put the game out of reach at
65-47.
Although it was too late to
win, the Cards made it respect
able by dominating play over
the final 15 minutes and out

scoring the Eagles 42-32. Belton
poured in 20 of those points as
he totalled 32 for the game,
along with 11 rebounds. The
second-half performance left
one feeling that had Stanford
played the same way in either
of the first two games, the
Cards would not have suffered
through a winless trip.
Stanford also got a lift from
the fine play of Terry Smith,
who netted 12 points in 15 mi
nutes of play. Smith, the
6-foot-4 freshman swingman,
sat out the first two games of
the trip with a pulled hamstr
ing, but once again proved his
value to the team by sparking
the Cards' second-half surge.
The Boston College game
also provided a chance for
David Nussbaum, Larry Harris
and Doug Barnes to exhibit
their talents. Nussbaum, the
6-10 freshman center, played
well in his second consecutive
start with four points, three re
bounds and two blocked shots
while continuing to gain ex
perience.
Harris, a 6-1 guard, scored
six points, played tough de
fense and displayed good
quickness, something the
Cards lack desperately with
Morgan sidelined.
Barnes, the senior guard,
canned three long jumpers,
proving why he is considered
the best shooter on the team.
Although no one wants to
lose five straight going into
league play, the Cards can fee
confident coming off one c
their best games and having fi
nally found their most com
petitive lineup.
And, after their three per
formances on the road trip,
things could be a lot worse.
The Cards could be in the Big
Fast Conference where they
would already be in the league
basement at 0-3.
