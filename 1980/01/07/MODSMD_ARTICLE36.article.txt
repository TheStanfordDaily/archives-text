# Ruark's 20-of-22 sets record
## Women drop seven games 
### 
After suffering defeats in
seven out of eight games, Stan
ford's women's basketball
team returned to the ranks of
the winning last Thursday by
trouncing San Francisco State,
87-64.
The Cardinals, now 6-8 over
all after winning four of their
first five games, were led by
amazing sophomore ]eanne
Ruark, who continued her
season-long excellence by col

lecting 22 points and 12 re
bounds.
The loss string began in the
middle of December as Stan
ford fell to then-11th-ranked-
UCLA, 88-63, and then-eighth
ranked Long Beach State,
85-76.
Ruark tallied 42 points in the
two games and center Louise
Smith added 40, but the most
pleasant revelation was the
play of freshmen Meg Metzger

and Kim Kupferer.
Against Long Beach, Metz
ger tallied 20 points and hauled
in nine rebounds, while Kup
ferer distinguished herself
with outstanding defense in
both games.
The Cards also fell to two
other strong teams, East
Carolina (88-72) and Indiana
(73-63) in the North Carolina
Christmas Classic at Chapel
Hill, N.C.
In the East Carolina game,
Ruark set an AIAW field goal
percentages record by gun

ning in 20 of 22 attempts. She
finished with a school-record
42 points, but in vain.
Stanford also fell to
Montclair State, 85-58, before
heading 112o r the Queens Holi
day Tournament in New York.
There, the Cards opened with
an 87-64 loss to Memphis State
but ended their six-game los
ing streak (the longest in team
history) with a 59-54 triumph
over Michigan State. In the
consolation bracket of the
tournament Drake outlasted
the Cards, 64-59.
