Pittsburgh — Like many of us, Terry Bradshaw thought Mike
Renfro caught the ball in the end zone late in the third quarter.
"I was just watchin' it,"the Steeler quarterback said, "and I
thought it was a touchdown. But the guy (side judge Donald Orr)
never raised his arms. He should be able to make the call, one
way or the other."
Like many of us, Bradshaw thought the nullification important
but not ultimately decisive.
"I thought: 'So they score; we'll just score again.' They had to
stop us and they didn't. Not once, but twice. They were great, but
my boys responded and got six at the end."
"They should have stopped us."
That is the attitude here, the feeling that the Steelers were
going to find a way to win the AFC title yesterday no matter what
the circumstances, that they just might be subconsciously teasing
us by allowing the Oilers to get ever so close to winning before
saying "No."
If Oiler fans want to argue that the pressure of having to break a
17-17 tie instead of padding a four-point lead might have caused
Matt Bahr to miss from 39 yards on the possession after the Renfro
controversy, Pittsburgh fans could counter by saying Bahr might
not have had to try that field goal.
The added pressure of a tie might have inspired the Steelers to
get a touchdown of their own. Hadn't they matched the Oilers
point-for-point all afternoon, spotted them a touchdown early
and come storming back, made every catch and play that was
absolutely necessary?
Still, the Steelers had been uncharacteristically tense before
the game — and Bradshaw surprisingly cautious much of the time
after it began.
"It may have seemed as though we were loose (during practice
all week)," said halfback Rocky Bleier, "but we really weren't.
There was a down undercurrent Thursday and Friday, especially
Friday.
"There was not the enthusiasm everyone expected. It could
have been taken for complacency — but it was butterflies. We
were nervous . . . the law of averages was not necessarily on our
side, getting back-to-back appearances in the Super Bowl."
