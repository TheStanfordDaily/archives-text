# Shrine game: better late than never for Evans and Schonert
## 
### Chris Haft 
It just didn't feel like Stan
ford Stadium Saturday at the
55th annual Shrine All-Star
East-West football game and
pageant.
Maybe it was the presence of
the Kilgore Rangerettes instead
of the Stanford Band. Maybe it
was the maroon fezzes worn by
many of the spectators instead
of red T-shirts. Maybe it was
the large orange walrus danc
ing on the sidelines instead of
the Tree.
What was definitely unsettl
ing was watching Stanford
seniors Chuck Evans and Turk
Schonert assume different pos
itions â€” Evans at outside
linebacker instead of his cus
tomary defensive left tackle
spot, and quarterback
Schonert on the West squad's
bench for most of the game,
won by the West 20-10.
However, the Cardinal stars
ultimately displayed their ta
lents, though they waited until
the game's final minutes to do
so.
Finally moved back to the de
fensive line with less than
seven minutes remaining,
Evans chased East quarterback
Bill Hurley out of bounds for a
loss of eight yards and formed
part of a human wall that held
Notre Dame star Vagas Fergu
son to a harmless four-yard
gain on the next play.
Schonert's brightest mo
ment came at the very end of

the game, when he tossed a
seven-yard touchdown pass to
Rice University's Earl Cooper
for the West's final points.
Schonert had to beat the clock,
which showed just three sec
onds remaining when the ball
was snapped,and Cooper had
to fight his way through two
East defenders into the end
zone.
Both Evans and Schonert,
the pair that will represent
Stanford in this week's Japan
Bowl, were reasonably pleased
with their efforts.
"I played OK," Evans said. "I
certainly haven't played out
side linebacker, but I think
that's what I'm going to have to

play if I want to go on (to the
NFL)."
Early in the first quarter
Evans made a fine play from his
linebacker spot, stopping Fer
guson after a one-yard gain.
"Playing the run is nothing
new, because I've done that,"
Evans said, adding, "I have to
work on my pass drop . . . try
ing to pick up the receivers.
That will be tough."
While Evans played much of
the game, Schonert spent very
little time on the field. After
completing five of six passes
for 46 yards during the second
quarter, Schonert languished
on the sidelines for the rest of
the second half before coming
in for Brigham Young standout

Marc Wilson with just 58 sec
onds left.
"I'm disappointed I didn't
play much, but I'm just happy
to have been in the game,"
Schonert said.
"The main reason you come
to a game like this is you want
to play, to show people what
you can do," the NCAA's lead
ing passer added later.
As it was, Schonert almost
didn't get his TD pass. After
pitching out twice to Cooper, it
appeared that both squads,
though they were at the line of
scrimmage, would let the clock
run out.
"When I saw there were four
seconds (left) I knew we had to
get it (the play) off."
