# Fall paralyzes gymnast; Lockard condition stable
## 
### Andrea James 
Stanford gymnast William Brodie
Lockard was listed in stable condi
tion at Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center yesterday where he has been
recovering from paralyzing injuries
suffered in a Dec. 6 trampoline fall.
Lockard, a 19-year-old junior from
San Diego, has been paralyzed from
the neck down since he fell seven
feet into the trampoline pit in Encina
Gym after failing to complete a new
twist during a 3 p.m. practice ses
sion.
Lockard landed on his head in the
pit, broke his neck and disaligned
several parts of his spine. He was
rushed to Stanford University Hospi
tal and was treated by Dr. lames Col
den, clinical associate professor of
surgery.
After several days there, Lockard
was transferred to Valley Medical
Centerwhere he is being seen by Dr.
Conal Wilmot, chairman of the De
partment of Rehabilitation there.
Mens gymnastics coach Sadao
Hamada said Lockard had been at
tempting a twist he had not yet prac
ticed in the pool. Usually the gym
nasts try out the new twists on the

diving board before attempting them
on the trampoline, and when the
moves are tried for the first time on
the trampoline, the foam pads are
fluffed up to allow for more padding
should the gymnast fall, as Lockard
did.
"It seemed to be by accident that
he tried the new twist," Hamada
said. "The move was unexpected; he
didn't expect it either. So the pit
wasn't fluffed."
Lockard has been on the 12-man
gymnastics competitive squad for
two years. Hamada said he would
easily have made the squad this year.
The first competition is tomorrow.
"He is most serious about gymnas
tics," Hamada said. "He's a very
competitive gymnast. It's kind of
hard to say what will happen. He may
recover 100 percent or zero per
cent."
Hamada visited Lockard last night
and said he was in good spirits.
Lockard can see visitors dui ing the
hospital's regular visiting hours from
noon to 8 p.m. daily. Santa Clara Val
ley Medical Center is located at 751
Bascom Ave. in San Jose.
