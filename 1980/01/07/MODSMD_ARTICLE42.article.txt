Carter renews call for sanctions on Iran
Washington — President Jimmy Carter, in a two-hour meeting
with United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim, last
night rejected a proposal that a U.N. commission investigate
the regime of the deposed shah of Iran and reiterated Ameri
can insistance that the U.N. impose economic sanctions against
Iran.
Carter's position, which amounts to a demand that the U.N.
make good on an earlier resolution calling for economic sanc
tions against Iran if the 50 American hostages were not freed by
today, was relayed to reporters alter the meeting by White
House Press Secretary Jody Powell.
Although today was the deadline set in the Dec. 31 resolution
for release of the hostages, officials said last night they do not
expect a resolution that would implement economic sanctions
against Iran to be introduced in the U.N. Security Council until
later this week.
Waldheim, who returned to New York Friday after a three
day visit to Tehran, flew to Washington yesterday afternoon to
report to Carter on his mission.
The Dec. 31 resolution on sanctions also called on Waldheim
to travel to Iran in an attempt to obtain the release of the
hostages who have been held by militant Iranians inside the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran since Nov. 4.
If Waldheim's mission failed, as it did, the resolution called
for the imposition of economic sanctions against Iran, but did
not specify what those sanctions would be.
Among the questions that cloud the future of a new resolu
tion imposing sanctions is the possibility of a Soviet veto, par
ticularly in light of the deteriorating state of Soviet-American
relations brought on by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Egypt cuts back relations with Soviets
Aswan, Egypt — Egypt signalled a sharp cutback in diplomatic
relations with the Soviet Union yesterday as a result of the
Afghanistan crisis and said it was ready to offer weapons, finan
cial aid and military training to Afghani rebels.
President Anwar Sadat's government, speaking through the
political bureau of the ruling National Democratic Party, also
promised diplomatic reprisals to "the Marxist regime at Aden
(South Yemen) and the Baathist regime in Syria," both of which
it said have supported the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
Neither Aden nor Syria presently have diplomatic relations
with Egypt, nor does either have significant trade ties, so it
appeared doubtful that the cancellation would have any effect
on either country.
Sadat has been the most outspoken of Arab and Islamic
leaders in his condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan. He views it as a serious and perhaps perilous extension of
the Soviet encirclement of the Middle East, which he has been
complaining about since he ejected Soviet military advisers and
military units from Egypt in the early 19705.

Gandhi leading in Indian elections
New Delhi, India — Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
swept into a commanding lead yesterday in early returns of a
national election that could bring her back to power as ruler of
the world's largest democracy.
The early tabulations were from representative districts — indi -
cating that if the trend continued Gandhi would easily recap
ture the prime ministership in a dramatic reversal of her stun
ning defeat in the March 1977 election.
Gandhi's Indira Congress Party captured 28 of the first 40
decided races, official results showed. Indian news reports had
her candidates leading 53 of 56 other districts where counting
of ballots cast last Thursday and Sunday had begun.
Violence and charges of voter harassment marked election
days. Indian news media counted a nationwide toll of 20 dead
and scores injured.
Sunday's worst violence flared in the eastern state of Bihar,
where the United News of India reported five deaths and about
1000 arrests as riotous groups of political party workers repor
tedly tried to capture ballot boxes to rig the election in 54
separate districts. Police opened fire at least three times, UNI
said.
Success seen in Rhodesian ceasefire
Salisbury, Rhodesia — A total of 18,500 armed guerrillas have
complied with ceasefire terms by assembling in "peace camps"
throughout Rhodesia, the head of the Commonwealth force
monitoring the truce said yesterday.
Maj. Gen. John Acland said it was a "comparative success"
that this number of guerrillas had ceased fighting to await the
outcome of elections in late February that will determine
whether guerrilla leaders or moderate black politicians inside
Rhodesia would form the first post-independence govern
ment.
But both Acland and Nicholas Fenn, spokesman for Lord
Soames, the British governor of Rhodesia, acknowledged that
the validity of the guerrillas who had come into the camps was
still in question, and indicated that restoration of peace in the
countryside was not yet accomplished.
Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the black prime minister who relin
quished power to Soames when Great Britain took back control
of the breakaway colony and who is regarded as the most
formidable moderate leader opposing the guerrilla leaders in
elections, said he was "very dubious" about the validity of the
guerrilla return.
"These people (the guerrilla leaders) have cheated a lot,"
Muzorewa said before mounting a platform to start his election
campaign Sunday before 40,000 followers.
Muzorewa estimated that only a third of the guerrillas in the
assembly camps were "genuine" and that those outside the
camps were either electioneering or intimidating people in
tribal areas.
If that were the case, it would leave the British-supervised
"free and fair" elections in a "precarious situation," Muzorewa
said.

26 killed in Iranian rival-sect clashes
Tehran — Twenty-six were killed in fierce fighting between
rival Moslem sects in the southern port city of Bandar Langeh,
while in the northern city of Tabriz, clashes resumed between
followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and his most power
ful rival religious leader.
In all, 28 died and more than 200 were wounded in the
increasingly bitter conflicts developing in Iran's provinces.
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotzbadeh, meanwhile, appealed
to Khomeini to resolve the latest hostage issue, forwarding to
the 79-year-old revolutionary a new demand by the radical
captors of the U.S. Embassy to hand over America's charge
d'affairs Bruce Laingen for questioning about alleged espion
age documents.
In an attempt to ease the rising level of violence between
Turkish-speaking Iranian followers of Khomeini's rival, Ayatol
lah Kazem Shariat-Madari, and Khomeini loyalists in Azerbaijan
province, Iran's state radio broadcast a statement reportedly by
Shariat-Madari disassociating himself from his supporters in
the Moslem Peoples' Republic Party.
In the broadcast Shariat-Madari allegedly called upon his
partisans to stay calm and avoid "the deepening of difference."
Iran threatens journalists' expulsion
Tehran — Iran's government, protesting what it called dis
torted and racially biased reporting on the occupation of the
U.S. Embassy and the regional unrest here, publicly threatened
yesterday to expel all American, British and West German re
porters from the country.
Although Iranian authorities have frequently criticized
foreign reporting since American hostages were captured nine
weeks ago, yesterday's warning coincides with an unusually
harsh pattern of crackdowns, especially on the broadcast
media.
Widely circulated through the official Pars news agency, this
latest attack is seen as an attempt to extort more favorable
foreign press coverage of Iran as its international isolationism
on the hostage issue grows. At the same time it is meant to
mobilize domestic public support in a period of widespread
regional unrest.
Recent threats and curbing of press freedom emerged after
two Khomeini stories that officials deemed unfair — a CBS
report claiming that the spiritual leader was cut off from vital
information, and a Time cover story naming him "Man of the
Year" and saying he succeeded in "rousing hatred in nations."
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today and tonight. Increasing cloudiness to
morrow with chance of showers. Slightly cooler nights. Lows in
the 40s to low 50s. Highs in the 50s. East to southeast winds 5 to
15 mph.
