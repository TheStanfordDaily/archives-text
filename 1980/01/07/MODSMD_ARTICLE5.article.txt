## Moslems pledge 'fight to finish' 
### Associated Press 
A radio broadcast from Afghanistan yesterday said
Moslem insurgents have suffered heavy casualties fight
ing Soviet troops but pledged a "fight to the finish" to
force the Soviets out of the Central Asian nation.
In Moscow, the official news agency Tass charged that
steps taken by the United States in response to the
Soviet intervention were "hostile to the interests of
peace." Tass said it was "hopeless" for the United States
to try to alter the Soviet position by curtailing ties bet
ween the two countries.
President Jimmy Carter announced Friday thatthe Un
ited States would halt the sale of 17 million tons of grain
and sophisticated technology to Moscow, and an official
said Saturday that these moves "should not be consi
dered the final word."
In Peking, U.S. Defense Secretary Harold Brown, al
luding to the situation in Afghanistan, warned yesterday
that if the shared interests of the United States and China
are threatenee "we can respond with complementary
actions in the field of defense as well as diplomacy."
Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, speaking in Pek
ing at a banquet honoring visiting Egyptian Vice Presi
dent Mohamed Hosni Mobarak, called the Soviet action
"a flagrant violation of the U.N. charter and the norms of
international relations." He said the Soviets intended to
"make a southward thrust to the Indian Ocean, control
sea lanes, seize oil-rich areas and outflank Europe so as
to. gain world hegemony."
In Aswan, Egypt, meanwhile, a top official said the
government had ordered the Soviet presence in Egypt
scaled down and had offered aid to the Afghan rebels.
Mansour Hassan, minister of state for presidential af
fairs, also said Egypt had called for an Islamic summit
meeting and had ended relations with two pro-Soviet
countries, Syria and South Yemen.
Elsewhere, officials in Riyadh announced Saudia
Arabia will boycott the Olympic games this summer in
Moscow to protest the Soviet action in Afghanistan.
At the United Nations in New York, the Security
Council debated the Afghanistan situation for a second
day.
U.S. Ambassador Donald McHenry called the Soviet
action a "dangerous breach of peace and security" and

"a terrible miscalculation . . . by Soviet authorities." He
asked Moscow to withdraw its troops and called on the
council to censure the Soviets.
The debate was expected to produce a resolution
along the lines McHenry asked, one which the Soviets
almost certainly would veto. There was talk of taking the
issue to the General Assembly should that happen,
where no country can exercise veto power.
As the international war of words continued, travelers
arriving at the Iranian frontier Sunday told of Afghan
men and women attacking Soviet tanks with sticks and
stones in the western Afghan city of Herat on Friday.
They said many people were killed in the streets of
Herat, 60 miles east of the Afghan-Iran border.
Also, a Pakistani newspaper quoted officials at Quetta
on the Afghan-Pakistan border as saying the gas plant
outside Herat was blown up last night, hurling flames
into the sky that could be seen for miles.
The daily Jang newspaper also said Soviet troops exe
cuted a tribal leader in Herat for cooperating with the
guerrillas, and kept the body hanging in the city's main
square as a warning.
The rebel radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad,
Pakistan, said the insurgents suffered heavy casualties
near Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan. Thousands of
Soviet troops reportedly were flown to Jalalabad last
week, days after the Soviets began sending what West
ern diplomatic sources now say is a force of 100,000
soldiers into Afghanistan.
The rebel broadcast also claimed the rebels have
gained "considerable strength" from the defection of
Afghan army units in fighting in other parts of the coun
try. It claimed Saturday that 30,000 regular Afghan sol
diers had defected and were fighting the Soviet troops.
"Islamic dissidents, pro-rebel citizens and deserters
from the Afghan army who have joined the rebel cause
have pledged under oath on the Moslem holy book, the
Koran, that they will fight to the finish and throw the
Soviets out of Afghanistan," the broadcast said.
Diplomatic sources in Islamabad said fighting con
tinued Sunday in northeastern Badakshan Province near
Afghanistan's borders with China; Russia and Pakistan;
in Paktia, southeast of the capital city of Kabul and near
the Pakistan border
