# Rockefeller position open
## Lyman up for foundation head 
### 
President Richard Lyman was
named last week by The New York
Times as one of five leading conten
ders for the presidency of the Roc
kefeller Foundation. Lyman is a trus
tee of the Foundation.
The search for a new chief execu

tive began two years ago when
McCeorge Bundy, the latest head of
the foundation and former national
security adviser to President Lyndon
Johnson, announced he would leave
his job when he turned 60 in the
spring of 1979.
Lyman rose to the ranks of the
frontrunners after the favorite for the
post, State University of New York
Chancellor Clifton Wharton, took
himself out of the running just be
fore a recent meeting of the founda
tion trustees.
Since then, a selection committee
has interviewed Lyman and the other
candidates, Princeton Provost Wil
liam Bowen, )ohns Hopkins Presi
dent Steven Muller, former Univer
sity Law School Dean and current di
rector of the government's Interna
tional Development Cooperation
Agency Thomas Ehrlich, and the act
ing head of the Rockefeller Founda
tion, agricultural scientist Sterling
Wortman.
Lyman, 55, was among the leading
candidates last year for the Ford
Foundation presidency. He, along
with Bowen and Ehrlich, were passed
over for the post in favor of Franklin
Thomas, a New York attorney.
Lyman has said repeatedly in re
cent years that he is not actively seek
ing another job away from the Uni
versity and that he is happy with his
position here.
Lyman could not be reached for
comment yesterday on the Rockefel
ler post.
The foundation selection commit
tee tried unsuccessfully to persuade
Wharton, a Rockefeller trustee, to

change his mind and accept the pres
idency, according to The New York
Times.
It is still uncertain whether the
trustees will be able to arrive at a final
choice at their next meeting, but Rev.
Theodore Hesburgh, president of
the University of Notre Dame and the
selection committee head, was
quoted in the Times article as saying
the committee wants to choose from
the five candidates.
The 'Rockefeller Foundation, the
nation's second wealthiest (after the
Ford Foundation), has traditionally
selected its presidents from
academic or government circles. The
five leading candidates all fit that pat
tern.
The Times stated that more than
1000 persons applied for the posi
tion. The Rockefeller trustees had
tried to keep the list of candidates
secret while the selection committee
screened them, the article said.
Ehrlich, 45, was with the State De
partment before he became dean of
the Law School and later president of
the Legal Services Corporation, the
federal agency that provides free
legal aid for the poor in civil cases.
Lyman was named as the Universi
ty's seventh president in 1970 after
serving as the provost and vice presi
dent. He is the president of the
American Association of University
Presidents, chairs the Commission
on the Humanities and is on the
boards of trustees or directors of
several major foundations and cor
porations, including IBM Corpora
tion and the Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Teaching.
