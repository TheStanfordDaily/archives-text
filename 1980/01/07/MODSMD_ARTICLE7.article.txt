# Grad awarded Rhodes
## 
### 
Mary Carolyn King, a 1979 University graduate, was named last month as
one of the country's 32 Rhodes Scholars.
Now working and living in San Francisco, King, 23, will study for two years
at Oxford University in Oxford, England, on a grant sponsored by the
Rhodes Scholarship Trust.
The economics graduate is the University's 45th Rhodes Scholar and the
first woman here to receive the honor.
The 32 Americans, 24 men and eight women, will join an international
group of scholars from 17 countries at Oxford. Until four years ago, women
were excluded from the prestigious scholarships.
The Rhodes Scholarships were established in 1902 by the will of Cecil
Rhodes, the British philanthropist and colonial entrepreneur in southern
Africa, for whom Rhodesia was named. Rhodes hoped the scholarships
would contribute to world peace. His will specifies that no student will be
chosen or disqualified for a scholarship on the basis of race or religion.
King was a coordinator of Women's Week activities in 1977, sponsored by
the Women's Center, and she was a member of the governing board of the
Committee for Research on Women^
She said she plans to work toward a Master of Philosophy degree in
international relations at one of three colleges out of the more than 30 at
Oxford. She will decide which college she will attend before the fall, she
said.
King is currently working for an urban planning consulting firm in San
Francisco, but is not sure whether or not she will pursue a career in that field.
"I applied for the Rhodes on the basis that I had as good a chance as
anybody else," King said. "My parents are very pleased and excited."
She said she was thrilled at winning, but expressed slight unhappiness at
the prospect of being away from home for two years.
