## Tension forseen in U.S.-Soviet relations 
### 
The Washington Post
Washington — Major deci
sions in Moscow and
Washington in the past few
days, and the interplay bet
ween them, have cast a dark
shadow on international rela
tions in the first year of the
1980s and perhaps for years to
come.
The immediate cause of the
change in the world outlook is
the Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan beginning Christmas
week, but the immediate ef
fects range far beyond that
country and beyond the trou
bled region of Southwest Asia.
The list of retaliatory mea
sures against the Soviet Union
announced by President jimmy
Carter Friday night is the be
ginning rather than the end of
the drastic consequences. Far
more important than reduced
grain sales, restricted technol
ogy transfers and curtailed fish
ing rights is the thinking be
hind these measures in the
high councils of the U.S. gov
ernment.
Carter, who said early last
week that the Soviet action had
a greater impact on his assess
ment of the Russians than any
thing else since he has been in
office was reported Saturday to
be both impressed and depre
ssed by the brutality and de
ception which were employed
by Moscow's forces in Kabul.
According to those close to
Carter, not only his judgment
but his feelings about the
Soviets were affected.
Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, who consistently had
spoken up for a businesslike
and optimistic view of the Rus

sians, is reliably reported to be
equally shaken. Vance is said
to feel he gave a cooperative
relationship with the Soviets
his best effort, but that this ef
fort has failed, at least for the
foreseeable future.
National Security Affairs Ad
viser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who
long has maintained a darker
picture of the Russians and ex
pectations of an era of "over
lapping imperial power" bet
ween Moscow and
Washington, has been con
firmed in his views. Brzezins
ki's plans for intimate rela
tions, verging on a de facto al
liance, between Washington
and Peking have been em
bodied in the last-minute in
structions to Secretary of De
fense Harold Brown, who ar
rived in the Chinese capital
Saturday.
There is no expectation in
policy-making circles here that
the Russians will respond to
Western pressure by withdraw
ing their forces from Afghanis
tan, where they appear to be
positioning themselves for a
long haul. Moreover, there is
little expectation of a near
term change for the better in
Soviet activity elsewhere as in
ternational tensions rise, but
considerable apprehension
about potential changes for the
worse.
Without a change in the flow
of thinking, which would re
quire a change in the flow of
events and perhaps a leader
ship change in Moscow or
Washington or both, the chill
in East-West relations is likely
to be an international fact of
basic importance for many

months.
To think or speak of this as a
return to the cold war of earlier
decades is deceptive, because
the world is more complex
now, the margins of safety and
patience are thinner, and in
ternational life is more difficult
to manage.
In short, the world is a more
dangerous place, and the new
events and attitudes are likely
to make it still more danger
ous. Among the likely con
sequences of the new turn in
Soviet-American relations are
spiraling increases in military
budgets and armaments on
both sides, greater danger that
proxy wars will directly involve
great powers, and a greater
likelihood of the spread of nuc
lear weapons to additional na
tions, some of them highly un
stable. The prospect is enough
to make one wish for "the
good old days" of the 19705.
All this may be considerably
more than the Soviet leader
ship anticipated in the calcula
tions — or miscalculations —
leading to the intervention in
Afghanistan. There is still little
or nothing known in
Washington about the details
of this decision, which is be
lieved to have been made
about a month ago. On the
basis of attitudes and historical
analysis, rather than hard facts,
there are two schools of
thought about the Soviet moti
vation.
One is that the Kremlin acted
on national security considera
tions of a largely local charac
ter, possibly at the behest of
military officials who were
committed to "not losing" in

Afghanistan. To allow the Mar
xist revolution there to col
lapse, as it was in danger of do
ing, would be to court the
spread of a Khomeini-like Is
lamic revolution to a second
nation on Soviet borders. Such
a development would be
dangerous as well as distasteful
in Moscow's eyes.
The second school of
thought emphasizes the
strategic nature of Soviet thrust
toward the warm waters of the
Indian Ocean and the oil-rich
Persian Gulf at a time when the
United States is engaged in a
quarrel with Iran. In this view,
the Kremlin seized an oppor
tunity to reap long-term advan
tages. Advocates of this line of
thinking speak of Afghanistan
as a Soviet "test" of the West.
One countermeasure that
generated little debate but
holds the seeds of long-term
consequences is the decision
to extend economic and milit
ary assistance to Pakistan, the
now-threatened neighbor of
Afghanistan. U.S. aid had been
cut off last April under non
proliferation laws because
Pakistan was discovered to be
building a secret uranium en
richment plant capable of pro
ducing the raw material for
atomic weapons.
By pushing ahead to aid
Pakistan despite its continuing

nuclear program, the administ
ration is cutting the ground
from under its antiproliferation
effort. It would be difficult for
the United States to penalize
India for refusing international
safeguards on its nuclear prog
ram, even while aiding Pakis
tan under present cir
cumstances. Carter is reported
to be preparing to use his pres
idential authority to release
two controversial shipments of
atomic fuel for India following
that country's elections next
week.
An India-Pakistan nuclear
weapons race and the enfee
blement of U.S. antiprolifera
tion efforts could have an ef
fect on other nations on the
threshold of atomic weapons
capability.
On a global rather than a reg
ional level, the consequences
of Soviet action in Afghanistan
and the U.S. reaction to it are
also severe.
In the strategic weapons
field, Carter has been forced to
shelve his highest priority
foreign policy initiative, the
SALT II treaty, for at least the
time being — almost certainly
for the rest of his elected term.
Even before this action, Car
ter committed himself to a far
higher increase in military
spending over the jiext five
years than he previously had
scheduled.
