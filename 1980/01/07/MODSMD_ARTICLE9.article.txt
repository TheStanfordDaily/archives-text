The Washington Post
Paris â€” France refused yes
terday to line up behind Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's program
of economic countermeasures
against the Soviet Union for in
vading Afghanistan.
, The French position con
trasted dramatically with the
jjblidarity expressed by Britain
and West Germany. Although
French Foreign Minister lean
Francois-Poncet argued that
the opposite is the case,
French prestige in the Third
World may complicate the at
tempts to form a united front of
nations against the Soviet ac
tion.
Francois-Poncet expressed
disapproval of the Soviet inva
sion with the relatively mild
diplomatic language that the
Soviets had lied to France
about the Afghan situation.
But, as the "witness" and

originator of East-West detente
15 years ago, France is
dutybound not to act hastily,
Francois-Poncet told reporters
in a radio interview program.
His description of French
policy was the most striking
example of a number of recent
instances in which France has
appeared to be signalling to
the Soviet Union that it wants
to reestablish Franco-Soviet
ties on a separate basis from
Soviet relations with the rest of
the Western allies.
When the United States was
pressing its allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to
accept stationing in Europe of
missiles that can reach Soviet
soil, French diplomats spoke of
what one of them called "our
obstinate refusal to express a
judgment on the decisions of
our allies."
The French also have been

stressing in recent days the
dangers of world war in a way
that seemed to be warning Car
ter not to go too far. In his trad
itional address to the French
people on New Year's Eve,
President Valery Giscard D'Es
taing said: "The danger of war
exists. We live in a period when
the world's equilibrium rests
on the capacity for self-control
of a few men."
By contrast, the French had
been saying only a few days be
fore that Carter had not been
displaying enough firmness
over U.S. diplomatic hostages
in Tehran.
Francois-Poncet said that Fr
ance would vote for a Security
Council resolution calling on
the Soviets to withdraw from
Afghanistan. He also said Fr
ance would not take commer
cial advantage of the gap
created by the U.S. cancella
tion of deliveries of grain or
technology to the Soviets.
