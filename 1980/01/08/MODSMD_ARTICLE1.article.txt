# Lyman to pick site of graduation
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman is ex
pected to make the final decision on
the site for )une Commencement
exercises sometime this week, ac
cording to )ean Fetter, assistant to
the president.
Lyman must decide whether to
hold commencement in Frost Am
phitheater and limit the number of
guests allowed per graduate or
move the ceremony to the much
larger Stanford Stadium.
Lyman met with his staff yesterday
morning to discuss the issue, and
"always seeks advice as widely as he
can," said Fetter, but the final deci
sion will be Lyman's.
The University formed a tempor
ary student-staff committee in
November, which ran a letter in the
Daily to solicit opinions on the sub
ject.
According to Director of Public
Events Vicky Holt, the committee
received 39 responses from the gen
eral public and 52 from the senior
class, which were "pretty strongly in
favor of Frost."
The major conflicts with holding
the exercises at Frost are overcrowd
ing and a shortage of chairs.
"Overcrowding at Commence
ment has been a problem for several
years," said Susie Farr, associate di
rector of Public Events, who over
sees the logistics of the ceremony.
Last year each graduate was allowed
four guests, but hundreds of people
were unable to find seats, she said.
An added problem is that Abbey
Rentals, the company that previ
ously rented all 18,000 chairs tor
Commencement here, discontinued
its chair rental business last fall.
Renting the chairs from other
companies was not considered feas
ible, according to Farr, because the
companies contacted already had
too many obligations to till Stan
lord's large order and the price
charged was prohibitive, ranging
from 60 to 80 cents per chair per day.
It Lyman decides to use the am
phitheater for commencement, the
University will have to buy the
chairs. According to Farr, the Office
of the Vice President for Business
and Finance determined this would
add $7000 to the Commencement
budget tor the next 10 years. The
move to the stadium would save
$22,000 a year.
According to Holt, the decision is
"such a difficult issue," because of
the sentiment involved. Com
mencement has been held in the
amphitheater since 1937.
