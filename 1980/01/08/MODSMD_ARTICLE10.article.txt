# Whale song is constantly changing

San Francisco (AP) - A
decades-long study of the
haunting songs of humpback
whales shows the surprisingly
complex tunes are nature's
only music that is constantly
rewritten, a New York
zoologist said Saturday.
"The amazing thing that
we're finding is that the song
(distinct in each humpback
group) is constantly changing.
The song is evolving," said
Katharine Payne of the New
York Zoological Society.
"This is something that no
other animal does as far as we
know and we don't understand
the significance of it," she told
a news conference at the
American Association for the
Advancement of Science's an
nual meeting.
Payne and her hus
band, Roger, have been re
cording and analyzing whale
songs for 22 years near Ber

rnuda, the West Indies, Hawaii
and Mexico.
She said whales at each loca
tion sing their own song - a
melodical series of hums,
grunts, growls and squeaks.
"But they have a structural
pattern that is very compli
cated and seems to be adhered
to by humpbacked whales the
world over," she said.
The pattern, in which sounds

are arranged into eight to 10
repeated themes for each 15-30
minute song, apparently is in
herited, she said.
But within these rules, the
50-ton, 50-foot mammals have
ample room to improvise,
changing "the kinds of sounds,
the combinations, patterns,
timing and pitch," she said.
But, she added, the changes
are adopted by all whales in the

group. "You don't find every
whale off singing his own
thing. Everybody's up on the
current vogue. They know
what the latest, hottest thing is
everyday," she said.
For scientists, "The fascina
tion of this is that now we have
a process for studying the cul
tural transmission of some
animal other than man," she
said.
The humpbacks, protected
from hunters, migrate annually
from feeding grounds near the
poles to breeding grounds in
tropical waters. They sing only
during the six-month breeding
season.
And although the same
songs seem never to be re
peated after they are changed,
when the whales return to the
tropics after six months of si
lence, "They pick up their song
right where they left off."
