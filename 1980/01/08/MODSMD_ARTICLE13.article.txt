## Saving Cambodia: the duty of 20th century humanity 
### 
While the eyes of the world are
transfixed on the happenings in Iran,
the drama of Cambodia is ongoing,
with all its misery, starvation and pes
tilence.
It is unlikely that the world has ex
perienced an analogous holocaust.
Following the immense destruction
during the Vietnam war, the at
rocities of the Pol Pot regime are dif
ficult to fathom. The subsequent Vie
tnamese invasion and usurpation of
Cambodia completed the unbeliev
able task. An entire people is now at a
very advanced state of decimation.
Political and historical perspectives
aside, the human tragedy is of over
whelming proportions.
The historical background of
Cambodia is a tangled web of
nationalistic movements spanning
several centuries capped with the

colonial and imperialistic politics of
the West. Whatever territory is called
Cambodia or Campuchea today is
significantly out of proportion to its
cultural and historical contributions
to the development of Southeast
Asia.
During the period between the
11th and 13th centuries and at the
height of its power, the Khmer
(Cambodia) State stretched across a
vast area of the Indochinese penin
sula incorporating much of Vietnam,
Laos and Thailand. Few civilizations
in the world can rival the splendor of
Angkor and the might of the Khmer
empire.
The emergence of Siam in the
West and Vietnam in the East
brought the decline of the Khmer,
crowned by the fall of Angkor to Thai
invaders by the end of the 14th cen

tury. The next 450 years saw a Viet
namese and Thai expansion at the
expense of Cambodia which was
ruled by warring royal families owing
their allegiance to either foreign
power.
The Western influence began
when, in an almost classic use of
gunboat diplomacy, the French in
1803 intimidated the Cambodian
King Norodom into signing a protec
torate treaty.
Prince Norodom Sihanouk led the
country to independence in 1953.
Conscious of historical precedent,
Sihanouk saw South Vietnam and
Thailand as the greatest threats to
Cambodia's survival.
Both of these states were under
United States influence, which the
prince distrusted. He also could

foresee the eventual success of the
Vietnamese communists and the
danger of a unified Vietnam. He pur
sued, therefore, a precarious policy
of strict nonalignment. It brought his
downfall.
In 1970, Lon Nol, with obvious CIA
support, overthrew Sihanouk and es
tablished a pro-American regime.
With the debacle of Vietnam, Lon
Nol's fate was prescribed, with
Phnom Penh falling to the Khmer
Rouge guerillas in 1975.
The carnage began. The capital city
was evacuated and the country was
"re-oriented" to Marxist ag
rarianism. Pol Pot emerged as the
strongman of the new order of
things. Intellectuals, those sus
pected of being westernized, and
even those whose only "crime" was

wearing glasses fell victim to his sys
tematic genocide.
Last year Vietnam invaded Cam
bodia, bringing the patron super
powers, the Soviet Union and China,
to the brink of war. The Vietnamese
are now in control of much of Cam
bodia although the remnants of the
Khmer Rouge have solidified them
selves in the western frontier land, at
the Thai border.
Starvation of the Western Cambo
dians, who find themselves in the
midst of the conflict, has become al
most unavoidable. The occupying
forces of Vietnam, who are angered
by continued U.N. and Western rec
ognition of Pol Pot, often prevent or
usurp relief supplies. Whatever can
infiltrate through Thailand may fall
into the hands of the Khmer Rouge.
The civilian population is left to die at

the rate of 6000 per day.
The proud Cambodians who sur
vived the Vietnam War and a tumult
uous history preceeding it are at a dis
tin< I point of real extinction. There is
no end to their calamity nor any
political solution to their dream.
Only the pity of humanity and mas
sive relief aid may ease some of the
misery.
Enough money, privately raised
and channeled through organiza
tions like Oxfam-America whose re
cord of neutrality has won itaccessto
Phnom Penh, may save the remain
ing Cambodians. To abandon them
would be an insult to the latter part of
the twentieth century.
