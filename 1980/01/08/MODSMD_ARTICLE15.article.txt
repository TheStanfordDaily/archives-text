## Military intervention in Mideast perilous 
### 
The Soviet Union's attempt
to prop up a Marxist govern
ment in Afghanistan last year
has now developed into a mas
sive invasion of more than
45,000 Russian troops to put
down widespread and bitter
resistance by anti-government
forces. Whatever the final out
come, thousands of lives will
have been wasted and another
small country left ravaged by
modern warfare, with damag
ing effects certain to spread far
beyond Afghanistan.
If the situation seems similar
to our own involvement in
Vietnam, it should serve as yet
one more warning that "li
mited operations" against
seemingly weak Third World
nations succeed in remaining
limited only in the imagination
of military planners. In real life
instances, such as Vietnam
and Afghanistan, there is no
such thing as a quick and easy
victory, and in any case such
adventures are bound to cause
hostile reverberations around
the world.
Nevertheless, for the past
year the Pentagon has been

laying plans for possible U.S.
military intervention in the
Middle fcast. Well before the
shah of Iran was overthrown
Administration officials and
members of Congress referred
to the continued supply of
Middle East oil as "vital to our
national interest," to be pro
tected with military force if
necessary.
Last spring U.S. naval forces
in the Persian Cult and the In
dian Ocean were expanded
and the Pentagon established
a "unilateral corps" of 110,000
troops equipped and trained
for rapid strikes outside the
NATO area. In December a
Pentagon team was sent to the
Persian Gulf area to try to ar
range for the use of bases in
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Somalia
and Kenya by American troops
and ships "in case of
emergency."
The build-up is being car
ried out on the assumption
that either internal disruption
or outside aggression would
justify American military inter
vention. In other words, even
a popular uprising against the

traditional leadership in Saudi
Arabia or the Gulf sheikdoms
could be met with U.S. force.
Acceptance of such possible
involvement is based on the
belief that the continued flow
of oil is mutually beneficial —
to the West because it helps
maintain traditional standards
of living and to the exporting
countries because it provides
them with the capital to fi
nance modernization.
Unfortunately this assump
tion conflicts with an appa
rently growing feeling in the
Moslem world that Western
"progress" has been an evil
rather than a blessing. Iranians
saw their vast oil wealth bring
with it a breakdown of tradi
tional customs, polluted and
overcrowded cities, wide
spread corruption and brutal
repression. Huge fortunes
were made by a few, but the
poor continued to go without
even the basic necessities.
According to Nikki Keddie,
Middle Eastern historian at
UCLA, "What the West terms
modernization is frequently
experienced in the Third
World as a series of policies
that favor only a minority of
the population: the technoc
rats, bureaucrats, intelligent
sia, the foreigners and foreign
corporations. The rest of the
society gets either relatively
poorer, if it's an oil country, or
absolutely poorer if it's not."
What has happened in Iran
has already caused shock
waves in other Arab nations,
where growing Moslem mili
tancy reflects basic internal in
stabilities as well as resent
ment against the West.
Some of the instability is
due to conflict between large
Shi'ite minorities and the
Sunni leadership in the Gulf
states, to long-standing tribal
rivalries, to the presence of
large numbers of low-paid
immigrant workers, and to the
vast disparity of wealth that
exists in most of the Arab
world.
The people in these coun
tries are aware that, as was
true in Iran, American banking
and industrial interests main
tain close and profitable ties
with the wealthy ruling
families. A truck driver in
Kuwait recently told a Wall
Street Journal reporter that
America is "the friend of the

sheiks, the rich and the pow
eilul. I don't consider America
as my triend."
With such an attitude preva
lent among the largely immig
rant work force, Persian Gulf
state leaders fear that an in
crease in the U.S. military pre
sence in the region might be
the spark to ignite the tinder
box. Bahrain has firmly re
fused to permit U.S. warships
to use its facilities, and when
the sultan of Oman suggested
that U.S. ships be asked to
stand guard in the Straits of
Hormuz other Arab rulers re
jected the idea as too provoca
tive.
All of this suggests that even
a limited American military
venture in the Middle East —
whether in reprisal against the
Khomeini government or to
put down a popular uprising
elsewhere — could easily en
flame passions throughout the
area. Armed intervention to
"save" one country could re
sult in violent reactions in half
a dozen others, with results no
one can predict.
The situation in the Middle
East in many ways parallels
that of Indochina after World
War 11, when American in
volvement on behalf of the

French was marked by a total
failure to understand the val
ues and traditions of the
people and the nature of their
struggle against colonial rule.
Our massive use of firepower
largely accomplished its pur
pose.
Those who today envision a
military solution to the fer
ment in the Middle East show
the same lack of perspective
and cultural understanding
that brought tragedy to In
dochina and disruption to our
own society. Most of the
countries in that area, after all,
emerged only recently from
colonial rule and are not likely
to accept once again the oc
cupation of their cities by
foreign troops.
Whatever approach U.S.
leaders use from now on will
have to involve far greater
sensitivity to the grievances
and concerns of the people
than th£y have shown in the
past. Sticking to the old
policies and using the threat of
military power to enforce
them can only arouse further
turmoil among people who
have a great deal to resent and
very little to lose.

adventures are bound to cause
hostile reverberations around
the world.
Nevertheless, for the past
year the Pentagon has been

laying plans for possible U.S.
military intervention in the
Middle fcast. Well before the
shah of Iran was overthrown
Administration officials and
members of Congress referred
to the continued supply of
Middle East oil as "vital to our
national interest," to be pro
tected with military force if
necessary.
Last spring U.S. naval forces
in the Persian Cult and the In
dian Ocean were expanded
and the Pentagon established
a "unilateral corps" of 110,000
troops equipped and trained
for rapid strikes outside the
NATO area. In December a
Pentagon team was sent to the
Persian Gulf area to try to ar
range for the use of bases in
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Somalia
and Kenya by American troops
and ships "in case of
emergency."
The build-up is being car
ried out on the assumption
that either internal disruption
or outside aggression would
justify American military inter
vention. In other words, even
a popular uprising against the

traditional leadership in Saudi
Arabia or the Gulf sheikdoms
could be met with U.S. force.
Acceptance of such possible
involvement is based on the
belief that the continued flow
of oil is mutually beneficial —
to the West because it helps
maintain traditional standards
of living and to the exporting
countries because it provides
them with the capital to fi
nance modernization.
Unfortunately this assump
tion conflicts with an appa
rently growing feeling in the
Moslem world that Western
"progress" has been an evil
rather than a blessing. Iranians
saw their vast oil wealth bring
with it a breakdown of tradi
tional customs, polluted and
overcrowded cities, wide
spread corruption and brutal
repression. Huge fortunes
were made by a few, but the
poor continued to go without
even the basic necessities.
According to Nikki Keddie,
Middle Eastern historian at
UCLA, "What the West terms
modernization is frequently
experienced in the Third
World as a series of policies
that favor only a minority of
the population: the technoc
rats, bureaucrats, intelligent
sia, the foreigners and foreign
corporations. The rest of the
society gets either relatively
poorer, if it's an oil country, or
absolutely poorer if it's not."
What has happened in Iran
has already caused shock
waves in other Arab nations,
where growing Moslem mili
tancy reflects basic internal in
stabilities as well as resent
ment against the West.
Some of the instability is
due to conflict between large
Shi'ite minorities and the
Sunni leadership in the Gulf
states, to long-standing tribal
rivalries, to the presence of
large numbers of low-paid
immigrant workers, and to the
vast disparity of wealth that
exists in most of the Arab
world.
The people in these coun
tries are aware that, as was
true in Iran, American banking
and industrial interests main
tain close and profitable ties
with the wealthy ruling
families. A truck driver in
Kuwait recently told a Wall
Street Journal reporter that
America is "the friend of the

sheiks, the rich and the pow
eilul. I don't consider America
as my triend."
With such an attitude preva
lent among the largely immig
rant work force, Persian Gulf
state leaders fear that an in
crease in the U.S. military pre
sence in the region might be
the spark to ignite the tinder
box. Bahrain has firmly re
fused to permit U.S. warships
to use its facilities, and when
the sultan of Oman suggested
that U.S. ships be asked to
stand guard in the Straits of
Hormuz other Arab rulers re
jected the idea as too provoca
tive.
All of this suggests that even
a limited American military
venture in the Middle East —
whether in reprisal against the
Khomeini government or to
put down a popular uprising
elsewhere — could easily en
flame passions throughout the
area. Armed intervention to
"save" one country could re
sult in violent reactions in half
a dozen others, with results no
one can predict.
The situation in the Middle
East in many ways parallels
that of Indochina after World
War 11, when American in
volvement on behalf of the

French was marked by a total
failure to understand the val
ues and traditions of the
people and the nature of their
struggle against colonial rule.
Our massive use of firepower
largely accomplished its pur
pose.
Those who today envision a
military solution to the fer
ment in the Middle East show
the same lack of perspective
and cultural understanding
that brought tragedy to In
dochina and disruption to our
own society. Most of the
countries in that area, after all,
emerged only recently from
colonial rule and are not likely
to accept once again the oc
cupation of their cities by
foreign troops.
Whatever approach U.S.
leaders use from now on will
have to involve far greater
sensitivity to the grievances
and concerns of the people
than th£y have shown in the
past. Sticking to the old
policies and using the threat of
military power to enforce
them can only arouse further
turmoil among people who
have a great deal to resent and
very little to lose.

The Soviet Union's attempt
to prop up a Marxist govern
ment in Afghanistan last year
has now developed into a mas
sive invasion of more than
45,000 Russian troops to put
down widespread and bitter
resistance by anti-government
forces. Whatever the final out
come, thousands of lives will
have been wasted and another
small country left ravaged by
modern warfare, with damag
ing effects certain to spread far
beyond Afghanistan.
If the situation seems similar
to our own involvement in
Vietnam, it should serve as yet
one more warning that "li
mited operations" against
seemingly weak Third World
nations succeed in remaining
limited only in the imagination
of military planners. In real life
instances, such as Vietnam
and Afghanistan, there is no
such thing as a quick and easy
victory, and in any case such
