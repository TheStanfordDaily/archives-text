## Iran crisis a U.S. creation 
### 
As our country struggles
with the crisis in Iran, we must
painfully recall other recent
problems — Nicaragua and
Cuba to name two. Scanning
our history still further, it
seems that our increased in
ternational involvement since
World War II has not always
been impressive. The after
math of the Yalta agreement,
the Korea and Vietnam con
flicts, and the Mideast oil em
bargo stand out in a long list of
events where our country, in
retrospect, has walked away
the "loser."
Why do we have such a poor
track record? And why are we
so much less popular than
many of us realize or than most
of us would like to believe?
On the surface, finding
answers, or even making
generalizations, would seem
difficult. Many of ourproblems
with other nations appear un
predictable or unavoidable.
Sometimes we consider the
other party "wrong," "unfair,"
or "evil." Sometimes we blame
our leaders.
Sometimes there is no con
sensus about whether the final
outcome was good or bad, as
in the Korea conflict. Often
there is no consensus concern
ing the entire issue, as with the
Panama Canal. Sometimes

there is controversy over the
alternatives but general ag
reement that none of those op
tions open to us are very appe
aling, as with SALT 11.
Does this mean we are not to
blame for our problems in the
world 1 1 doubt it. When crisis is
upon us we often ask, "Now
what do we do?" We must also
ask, "How did we allow ourse
lves to get into this situation in
the first place?"
In a country with such great
influence in the world, and
with such great resources, I
find it hard to believe that we
cannot do a better job of pre
dicting, reacting and under
standing; that we cannot bet
ter control what we do and
what happens to us.
Indeed, there is something
very disturbing about our fail
ings on the world scene: too
often they are products of our
own arrogant and insular men
tality. Too often we have
brought about our own prob
lems — through a lack of
awareness and understanding
of the institutions and events
of other nations, through a lack
of empathy for the cultures and
attitudes of other peoples.
ioo often we assume that
other countries should func
tion as we do, and that most of
them actually want to. Too
often we act as if others benefit
when we benefit.
We do, of course, have some
great experts in all of the relev
ant fields. But we also are a
democracy with many power
ful special-interest groups and
pluralistic views — the advice
of a few experts is often ig
nored or mismterpreted.
Given the resources of this
country, and the importance of
our international dealings, it is
ironic that we cannot provide

adequate expertise in all parts
of the government, at home
and abroad, where that exper
tise is needed.
Even when we elect our con
gressmen and presidents
knowledge of world affairs is
rarely a factor.
In school we are taught too
little about other peoples.
Often what we are taught is an
inaccurate portrayal of an
American-centered world. The
general public remains rela
tively misinformed and unin
terested — and this is reflected
in our media.
In short, we have an in
adequate bureaucracy advising
an even less informed group of
politicians who are responsible
to a generally ignorant public.
This might sound harsh; it is
meant to be. That some prob
lems occur between nations is
inevitable. That some solutions
are beyond reach is under
standable. For these are not
condemned. But our creation
and exacerbation of problems
through self-imposed ignor
ance is inexcusable.
We are, in many ways, a
great nation — our resources
of materials, knowledge and
people are tremendous. But
potential alone does not solve
our problems. We seek friend
ship and respect, but end up
looking naive and overly
generous, and we get taken
advantage of. We try to be as
sertive and protect our own in
terests, and instead we get
stung by a backlash of protest
and resentment.
There is something about
that world out there that we
have not figured out. It is about
time we woke up.

the "loser."
Why do we have such a poor
track record? And why are we
so much less popular than
many of us realize or than most
of us would like to believe?
On the surface, finding
answers, or even making
generalizations, would seem
difficult. Many of ourproblems
with other nations appear un
predictable or unavoidable.
Sometimes we consider the
other party "wrong," "unfair,"
or "evil." Sometimes we blame
our leaders.
Sometimes there is no con
sensus about whether the final
outcome was good or bad, as
in the Korea conflict. Often
there is no consensus concern
ing the entire issue, as with the
Panama Canal. Sometimes

there is controversy over the
alternatives but general ag
reement that none of those op
tions open to us are very appe
aling, as with SALT 11.
Does this mean we are not to
blame for our problems in the
world 1 1 doubt it. When crisis is
upon us we often ask, "Now
what do we do?" We must also
ask, "How did we allow ourse
lves to get into this situation in
the first place?"
In a country with such great
influence in the world, and
with such great resources, I
find it hard to believe that we
cannot do a better job of pre
dicting, reacting and under
standing; that we cannot bet
ter control what we do and
what happens to us.
Indeed, there is something
very disturbing about our fail
ings on the world scene: too
often they are products of our
own arrogant and insular men
tality. Too often we have
brought about our own prob
lems — through a lack of
awareness and understanding
of the institutions and events
of other nations, through a lack
of empathy for the cultures and
attitudes of other peoples.
ioo often we assume that
other countries should func
tion as we do, and that most of
them actually want to. Too
often we act as if others benefit
when we benefit.
We do, of course, have some
great experts in all of the relev
ant fields. But we also are a
democracy with many power
ful special-interest groups and
pluralistic views — the advice
of a few experts is often ig
nored or mismterpreted.
Given the resources of this
country, and the importance of
our international dealings, it is
ironic that we cannot provide

adequate expertise in all parts
of the government, at home
and abroad, where that exper
tise is needed.
Even when we elect our con
gressmen and presidents
knowledge of world affairs is
rarely a factor.
In school we are taught too
little about other peoples.
Often what we are taught is an
inaccurate portrayal of an
American-centered world. The
general public remains rela
tively misinformed and unin
terested — and this is reflected
in our media.
In short, we have an in
adequate bureaucracy advising
an even less informed group of
politicians who are responsible
to a generally ignorant public.
This might sound harsh; it is
meant to be. That some prob
lems occur between nations is
inevitable. That some solutions
are beyond reach is under
standable. For these are not
condemned. But our creation
and exacerbation of problems
through self-imposed ignor
ance is inexcusable.
We are, in many ways, a
great nation — our resources
of materials, knowledge and
people are tremendous. But
potential alone does not solve
our problems. We seek friend
ship and respect, but end up
looking naive and overly
generous, and we get taken
advantage of. We try to be as
sertive and protect our own in
terests, and instead we get
stung by a backlash of protest
and resentment.
There is something about
that world out there that we
have not figured out. It is about
time we woke up.

As our country struggles
with the crisis in Iran, we must
painfully recall other recent
problems — Nicaragua and
Cuba to name two. Scanning
our history still further, it
seems that our increased in
ternational involvement since
World War II has not always
been impressive. The after
math of the Yalta agreement,
the Korea and Vietnam con
flicts, and the Mideast oil em
bargo stand out in a long list of
events where our country, in
retrospect, has walked away
the "loser."
