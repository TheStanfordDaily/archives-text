Crime against. . .
Imagine my surprise when I
opened The Stanford Daily on
Friday, Nov. 30 and out fell
three eight-by-twelve glossy
advertisements. Looking
down, I was shocked to see
two nearly bare pair of buns
staring up at me. Clad in cheap,
skimpy garb, these twin juicy

pieces of meat seemed to say,
"come and eat me." This
seductive advertising shows
once again that the way to a
person's heart is through his
stomach. But what next? Next
time it may be Mom's apple
pie! Another crime against
roast beef sandwiches!
