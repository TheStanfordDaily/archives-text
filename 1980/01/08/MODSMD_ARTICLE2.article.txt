# Arrest stems from debate incident here
## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
A Palo Alto woman pleaded not
guilty Friday to charges of disturbing
the peace and interfering with an of
ficer stemming from an incident at a
debate on the draft Dec. 14 at Kresge
Auditorium.
The defendant, Andrea Chan, 24,
was originally charged with unlawful
assembly, incitement to riot and fai
lure to disperse upon lawful order,
in addition to the current charges.
The former three charges were
dropped before the case came to
trial.
Chan, a member of the Revolutio
nary Communist Youth Brigade
(RCYB), had participated in a march
through the aisles of the auditorium
before the debate,
The debate, part of the Hoover
Institution-sponsored Hoover-
Rochester Conference on the All-
Volunteer Force, matched Nobel
Prize-winning economist and Senior
Hoover Fellow Milton Friedman
against Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park).
The debate focused on the ways
to increase the size of the U.S.
standing army. When Chan asked a
question from the floor, the chair
man ruled her out of order because
her question addressed the need for
a larger army, not the means to ob
tain one.
Later, another RCYB member
asked a similar question and was
also ruled out of order, but this time
Friedman replied nonetheless. Ac
cording to police reports written by
Captain Raoul Niemeyer ot the De
partment of Public Safety here,
another man "began to scream at
the panel. A shouting match then
ensued."
Two plainclothes policemen,
Niemeyer and Sergeant Marvin
Moore, rose from their seats and
removed the two from the au
ditorium. Once outside the officers
asked to see the pair's identification
and, according to Niemeyer,
"explained that they were disrupting
the program and that tempers were
tlaring as a result."
Chan followed the four outside,
and asked the officers why they
were arresting the two hecklers.
The officers, according to police

reports, told her the men were not
being arrested. When she persisted
in asking them, she said they
warned her not to continue or they
would arrest her.
Niemeyer ordered Chan to dis
perse and arrested her when she re
fused.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, who at
tended the debate, said, "it's a sorry
state of affairs it we've gone back to
people being arrested just for being
noisy. Selective use ot police power
was involved."
Niemeyer explained the presence
ot the plainclothes officers at the
debate, saying his office "had re
ceived information that an unknown
number of RCYB activists were
going to disrupt the program in
order to present their political point
of view."
Chan's pretrial hearing is set for
Feb. 13,
