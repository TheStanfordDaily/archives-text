## Star Trek: adventure that never began 
### 
Star Trek the television series
was a remarkable show. Pro
duced amid makeshift sets,
often hokey plots, and the
incredible pressure ol weekly
deadlines, it managed to
create a 23rd century worth
looking forward to. The
machines were wonderful
(though sometimes they'd
look a little too much like
cardboard) and so were the
people, each with his or her
own goals, dreams and frail
ties. Episodes such as the
"Menagerie" or "City on the
Edge of Forever" were human
dramas, sometimes touching,
sometimes troublesome. The
greatest success of Star Trek
on T.V. was that it put people
on a spaceship.
Star Trek-the Motion Picture,
three years in the making, fell
a little short. As a showcase for
all the technical goodies pro
ducer Gene Roddenbery im
agines for the 23rd century, it
was beautiful. As a display of
special effects it was spectacu
lar. But the movie just tried to
say too much and when the
Starship Enterprise left Earth
orbit, it forgot to take along
the spirit of its crew.
The movie opens like a Na

tional Geographic tour of the
galaxy. First we're in deep
space with the Klingons, lis
tening to their alien chit-chat
(you mean they don't speak
English everywhere?) and
watching them being fried
alive by a mysterious energy
cloud. Next we zip to the cra
tered planet Vulcan where
Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is en
gaged in a ceremony which is
something between a gradua
tion and a Bar Mitzvah. Finally
we are allowed to hear English
on space outpost Epsilon 9,
which is also being sizzled by
the alien invader.
Soon we flash to a more
familiar sight, 23rd century San
Francisco, where they not only
have BART running, but flying.
Admiral Kirk (William Shatner)
has just arrived at Star Fleet
Ffeadquarters to take com
mand of the Enterprise.
The next scene is perhaps
the best of the movie, at least
for the devoted Trekkie. After
our quick view of the galactic
panorama we finally return
home. In a small travel pod
with a picture window, Kirk
approaches his ship poised in
a drydock high above the
Earth. Those of us who grew

up watching a small wooden
model swish by on a black and
white T.V. screen were ecsta
tic at this dazzling new Enter
prise and the long drawn out
views that let us see her every
door, every port, and every
other detail we always knew a
starship would have.
But we hardly get to unpack
our bags before Kirk starts
babbling about the alien
monster. You'd think that
even the most professional ot
officers would take time out
for at least a sigh atter having
been away so long.
Inside, the ship is as thrilling
as it was outside. There are
swirling tubes of anti-matter
fuel in engineering; recreation
areas with carpets, games and
chirping birds; and an officers'
quarters with windows. Crew
members have a wealth of cos
tumes. (Watching the T.V.
show, one would think Cap
tain Kirk wore the same smelly
shirt for five years.) The new
bridge is well organized, has
seat-belts and circuit breakers
and an emergency exit. The
set even has ceilings.
Looking around one can
only imagine the fun the set
designers had in building a

starship full of gadgets. When
Kirk takes the Enterprise past
the speed of light, the effects
are something even Einstein
could love.
But a fancy ship was never
enough for the creators of Star
Trek. Their plots on T.V. al
ways carried a message and
their movie is no exception.
Flailing about in all its techni
cal wizardry, Star Trek-the Mo
tion Picture attempts to
examine the search for the
meaning of life.
Everyone seems to get into
the act. For Kirk, meaning is
command of the Enterprise. As
long as he has it, little else
matters. For Decker (Stephen
Collins) there is the beautiful
Ilia (Persis Khambatta) and he
gladly sheds his career for a
chance at cosmic sex.
For Spock, things are more
difficult. At first he believes
true fulfillment can come
through the total logic cult of
Kolinahr. But he rejects this
gospel for it leaves him in
complete. It is V'jur, the
machine at the center of the
energy cloud, that points to
the answer. Roaming the
galaxy in search of its creator,
Carl Sagan's revenge shows

pure intellect is not enough.
Man or machine, both must
see beauty to be truly alive.
V'jur's quest is the impetus
for the story. The cloud is fly
ing to Earth because it thinks
there lies its mommy. The
other quests are the sub-plots:
Kirk vs. Decker over the com
mand of the Enterprise, De
cker courting the celibate Ilia
and Spock abandoning
Kolinahr. Any one of these
could have made an excellent
television episode. Taken to
gether, they swamped the
movie.
The meaning of life is a
heavy question. A brilliant wri
ter might have sent a living
machine hurtling across space

searching for truth, contrasted
this with the dreams of a star
ship captain and his crew, and
made it come off. A brilliant
script could successfully show
us the 23rd century, populate
it with individuals, and debate
a nagging question of our age.
But the Star Trek script was
mediocre and the special ef
fects only made it worse. As
the Enterprise travels deeper
and deeper into the cavernous
interior of V'jur we begin to
expect an ending as climactic
as the machine is immense.
But (' mensionless characters
and shallow sub-plots do not
involve us emotionally and at
the end, the intensity of the
film's finale does not nearly
approach the grandeur of the

images on the screen.
Somehow the movie seems
to fly in the face of its own
message. Its picture of the
23rd century lies too much on
the technical side. It never de
velops any emotion, never in
tertwines the moral dilemmas
and the personal conflicts. It
never gets very human.
Star Trek is billed with the
slogan "the human adventure
is just beginning." This is
more true than was intended.
If those gorgeous Enterprise
sets are ever used again, and it
would be a shame if they are
not, let's hope the human ad
venture gets a little further
along the second time around.

"She's dead |im." Well, ac tually just a drone. Persis Khambatta is Ilia and William Shatner is Admiral
James T. Kirk in Paramount's Star Trek.
