Vocalist Flora Purim, with
her husband, percussionist
Moreira, and trombonist Raul
de Souze, will bring to the
stage her innovative approach
to the "seductive sounds of
Brazil." She developed her
style while singing with Return
to Forever, Chick Corea's
milestone group where she
said she began to reevaluate
traditional forms of pop sing
ing, shitting from a lyric con
centration to an emphasis on
producing sound which
"communicates more Ireely"
with the audience.
This, according to Warner
Brothers, her American record
company, includes develop
ment ol a vocal style which
shows off a six octave range
which can "run breakneck
from laughter to tears in the
span of a few bars."

working together and because
they work so well together the
result is larger than the indi
vidual parts."

nese waltz to a blues shuttle.
