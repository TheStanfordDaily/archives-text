Gandhi sweeps Indian election
New Delhi, India —Indira Gandhi swept back
into power yesterday with a spectacular elec
tion victory that humiliated her rivals. She
triumphantly declared the people had
realized "their big mistake" in deposing her
three years ago.
"You can't tool the people all the time," the
jubilant 62-year-old political leader told repor
ters at a victory celebration as her candidates
captured a strong majority in the lower house
of Parliament.
With votes st.il being counted from ballot
ing Thursday and Sunday, 337 seats had been
decided in the 524-member assembly and
Gandhi could count on 283. Of those, 263
were won by hei Indira Congress Party and 20
by its allies.
Drowning in the flood of pro-Gandhi bal
lots was the Janata Party, which had defeated
Gandhi in the March 1977 election when vot
ers rebelled against her near-dictatorial rule
by emergency decree. Janata, led by Un
touchable leader Jagjivan Ram, had won only
13 -.eats, compared to the 278 it polled in 1977.
Caretaker Prime Minister Charan Singh's
breakaway Janata taction had 16 seats; his
parlnei, the rump Congress Party 8; India's
two communist parties shared 8 seats and
minor parties and independents accounted
tor 9.
Gandhi, daughter of the late Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru, said she would make for
mal policy announcements only after final re
turns Tuesday of the general election, but tirst
priority would go to restoring law and order
and controlling inflation.
Refinery workers may strike
Denver — A union representing 60,000 re
finery workers across the nation will go on
strike today unless agreement is reached with
the oil companies in their contract dispute,
the union's president said yesterday.
Robert Goss, president of the Oil, Chemical
and Atomic Workers Union (OCAW), said the
workers planned to walk off the job at 4 p.m.
today and intended to shut down refineries
operated by 100 domestic oil companies.
Oil companies executives have said they
can keep their highly automated plants run
ning almost indefinitely without the OCAW
workers. But the union says the workers
would not be on the payroll if the companies
did not need them.
The Denver-based union is seeking a fully
paid health and dental insurance plan and
wage increases for the second year of its
two-year contract with the industry.
Goss earlier rejected a 9 percent wage in
crease offer. Union spokesman Jerry Ar

chuleta said the union would not consider any
wage offer until a comprehensive health-care
plan had been agreed upon.
Men held in Adamson murder
Nairobi, Kenya — Kenyan police questioned
three men yesterday in the death — now cal
led murder — of Joy Adamson, conser
vationist and author of Born Free, last week
near her tented camp in central Kenya.
Ben Gethi, Kenya's commissioner of police,
said police decided to treat Adamson's death
as a murder after receiving information that
indicated she was not killed by a wild animal.
Three men later were taken into custody at
an undisclosed location and were being ques
tioned, he said. Details on the three men's
identities were not disclosed, but it was be
lieved they may be former employees of
Adamson.
Adamson, 69, was killed Thursday night
while strolling outside her study camp in
Shaba Game Reserve, located about 175 miles
north of Nairobi.
Initial reports from friends and police indi
cated that she had been killed by a lion. It was
disclosed later, however, that there was little
blood at the death site and that the battery of
Adamson's car was missing.
' Wounds on the body led police to start
investigations immediately because they (the
wounds) were not consistent with claw
marks," a senior police spokesman in Nairobi
said. "This has been confirmed by a team of
experts. The cause ot death was a sharp in
strument."
Adamson's body will be cremated in
Nairobi today. Friends said it will be a private
ceremony and no religious service will be
held.
Newspaper suit called mistrial
San Francisco — A mistrial was declared yes
terday after a federal court jury failed to reach
a verdict in an anti-trust suit challenging the
joint publishing agreement under which the
city's two daily newspapers are produced.
The suit was against The San Francisco
Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner,
which in 1965 combined non-editorial func
tions in the San Francisco Newspaper Agency.
Lawyers tor the group challenging whether
that combination met terms of the federal
Newspaper Preservation Act said they would
seek a new trial.
The four-woman, two-man jury told U.S.
District Court Judge William Ingram after four
days of deliberation they could not arrive at a
unanimous verdict on two of three issues in
the case, and could reach no decision on the
third.

The jury was asked to decide whether,
without the agreement, the three newspapers
were likely to remain or become financially
sound.
The weekly Pacific Sun in nearby Marin
County, The Berkeley Barb and four employ
ment agencies challenged the joint operating
agreement.
They argued that it did not qualify for li
mited exemptions from federal antitrust laws
permitted under the Newspaper Preservation
Act of 1970, which allows two or more news
papers under different ownerships to share
printing and business operations if only one
of them was "likely to become or remain a
financially sound publication."
U.S. can use Egypt's facilities
Aswan, Egypt — Egyptian Defense Minister
Kamel Hassan Ali said yesterday the United
States can make use of Egyptian military
facilities on a temporary basis in the defense
of any Moslem state, but that Egypt would not
turn over naval or air bases for exclusive U.S.
use.
At the start of a summit conference bet
ween Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin — the
ninth the two leaders have held — Ali denied
reports circulating in Israel that Egypt had al
ready turned over at least one Egyptian air
base for use by the United States to deal with
the crises in the Middle East and central Asia.
Ali said if the United States wanted to come
to the aid of Afghanistan, that might represent
a "different situation," because Afghanistan
does not have a government that qualifies
under the Egyptian definition. Previously, Ali
had suggested the United States would be
welcome to use Egyptian military facilities in
defending Afghanistan, because that country
is Moslem.
Remaining is a major question — un
answered by Ali — whether the United States
would be permitted by Egypt to stockpile the
weapons and supplies in Egypt that would be
needed in any offensive in the region.
Grain embargo stalls market
Chicago — Brokers walked aimlessly around
once-lively trading pits at Midwest com
modities exchanges yesterday, complaining
that the government's suspension of grain
and soybean futures trading was unnecessary
and would hurt America's farmers.
Domestic trading was halted in wheat, corn,
oats, soybeans and soybean oil and meal be
cause the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission on Sunday suspended futures
trading in those commodities until tomorrow.
Prices plummeted on foreign commodities

Lower prices mean that farmers' crops will
be worth less, although the government has
said it will protect producers against a price
breakdown because of the embargo.
Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland said
yesterday the government would buy the con
tractual obligations of the firms that had deals
to sell grain to the Soviets, a measure hoped
to "minimize the disruption in the nation's
grain markets" at a cost of about $2.5 billion.
Carter okays Chrysler loan
Washington — President Jimmy Carter
signed legislation yesterday providing $1.5
billion in federal loan guarantees to Chrysler
Corp., declaring it a good investment for the
government and "extremely important . . .
for all the people of our country."
Carter said at a White House ceremony that
the legislation would save thousands of jobs
and head off a drop in tax revenues that
would have occurred if Chrysler went out of
business.
Chrysler had said that without the aid,
pushed through Congress just before the
Christmas holiday, the company would have
had to declare bankruptcy this month.
The nation s third-largest automaker, which
lost $1 billion in 1979, now says it has enough
money to keep going until February, by which
time the loan guarantees could be in place.
The loan package guaranteed by the legisla
tion is contingent on wage concessions by
hourly workers and other private assistance.
