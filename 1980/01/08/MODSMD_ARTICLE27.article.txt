# Power fails on Row
## 
### 
A fault in a street lighting system
cut off power late Sunday night and
most of yesterday to several Row
Houses, University Service Opera
tions officials said.
The power loss affected the Beta
Theta Pi and Delta Upsilon frater
nities, Columbae, Lathrop and
Hammarskjold Houses,, the sociol
ogy department in Mariposa and
Rogers houses, and The Bridge peer
counseling center.
Robert McKnight, utilities dis
tribution supervisor, said he had
been working to rectify the problem
throughout Sunday night and the
early hours of Monday morning, and
he expected power would be re
stored before nightfall yesterday. He
"guesstimated" material damage of
$5000 to $4000.
The blackout was caused by a
short in several 4000-volt power
lines at the Maytield Avenue dogleg.
It cut off heating in some of those
houses because the furnaces are
blower-fed and shut down small
appliances and lights in house
kitchens.
Row Food Service personnel said
the power outage caused no food
spoilage.
McKnight speculated that "if
people didn't have blankets, they
probably had a cold night."
