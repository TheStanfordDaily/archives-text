# Violence flares across Iran
## Kurdish governor resigns 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Tens of thousands of de
monstrators tilled the streets of Tab
riz, the Azerbaijani capital, setting
fire to a revolutionary committee
building yesterday as violence flared
across Iran.
Tension mounted in the Kurdish
powderkeg ot Sandandaj as the gov
ernor general of Kurdistan province
resigned to join protesters who de
mand the withdrawal of non-Kurdish
government security forces.
The Persian Cult coast near the
Strait of Hormuz was closed down in
mourning for the 41 killed in clashes
between Sunni and Shiite Moslems

in Bandar Langeh, according to offi
cial reports.
Meanwhile, the office of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini announced the
revolutionary leader had canceled
all appointments for 15 days starting
|an. 12, Tehran radio said. Citing
Khomeini's "extreme fatigue," the
statement said he would not receive
anyone.
In New York, U.N. Secretary-
General Kurt Waldheim reported to
the Security Council on his visit to
Iran last week — a trip it was hoped
would lead to release of some 50
Americans being held hostage at the
occupied U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Waldheim told the council, which
is considering a U.S. request for
economic sanctions against Iran,
that Iranian officials warned him
"enforcement" actions would only
provoke resistance.
European diplomats in Iran have
advised the United States that U.N.
economic sanctions against Kho
meini's regime may backfire and
end up strengthening Khomeini and
his most radical advisers.
Senior envoys of three Western
European countries all said they see
no prospect that Iran will soon re
lease the hostages.
"Things look pretty gloomy," one
ambassador said. "We are com
pletely stuck."
White House officials said yester
day that the United States is explor
ing certain unspecified ideas on a
resolution of the crisis in Iran that
emerged from Sunday night's meet
ing between President |immy Carter
and Waldheim.
Presidential Press Secretary |ody
Powell would not disclose details of
the ideas Carter and Waldheim dis
cussed, but he said they are "not
inconsistent" with the U.S. demand
that the first step in any resolution of
the crisis must be the release of the
American hostages in Tehran.

"Basically, the discussion last
night, (Sunday) was a discussion out
of which ideas emerged, rather than
any formal exchange of proposals or
plans," he said.
Powell also reiterated, as he had
Sunday night, U.S. insistence that
the release of the hostages must
precede any inquiry into alleged
crimes of Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi.
The militant students occupying
the embassy insist they will not re
lease the hostages until the deposed
shah is returned to stand trial for
'"orruption.
Western reporters were expelled
from Tabriz as violence entered its
fourth straight day in that north
western regional capital, major city
of the Turkish speaking Azari minor
ity.
But reports reached Tehran of fol
lowers of Iran's second-ranking
ayatollah, Mohammed Kazem
Shariat-Madari, angrily patroling the
streets. The reports said de
monstrators set fire to the headquar
ters of a revolutionary committee
that is loyal to Khomeini and has
been arresting demonstrators in re
cent days. Reporters said four
Shariat-Madari supporters were
slain there recently.
