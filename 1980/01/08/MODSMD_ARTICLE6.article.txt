The Los Angeles Times
United Nations — The Soviet
Union yesterday vetoed a U.N. Sec
urity Council resolution calling tor
the immediate withdrawal of foreign
troops from Afghanistan, where a
Soviet invasion has spread through
out the country since late last
month.
The United States and 12 other
members voted for withdrawal.
Only East Germany voted with the
Russians.
Sponsored by Bangladesh,
jamaica, Niger, Zambia and the
Philippines, the resolution did not
mention the Soviet Union by name
but "deeply deplored" the armed
intervention in Afghanistan.
Soviets cast veto
After three days ol debate, in
which nearly all the 46 speakers at
tacked the intervention, the Soviet
ambassador, Oleg Troyanovsky, cast
his veto. Earlier he had said the re
solution was a "flagrant intervention
in the affairs of a sovereign state and
should be rejected."
U.S. Ambassador, Donald
McHenry, called the Soviet veto
"unfortunate" but told reporters: "I
think you can expect active discus
sion" within the next 24 hours on a
proposal to send the matter to the
General Assembly. The assembly
does not have the enforcement
powers of the council, but it can ex
press the will of the United Nations
as a whole, and its actions are not
subject to a veto.
The Kremlin has insisted that it
sent Soviet troops — now estimated
by U.S. officials at a total of 85,000
men — into Afghanistan at the re
quest of Afghan government under
a mutual defense treaty.
After the vote, the council went
into private session to discuss
turther action in the Afghan case
and also to hear Secretary General
Kurt Waldheim report on his mis
sion to Iran.
On the Atghan issue, there are re
ports that the Philippines was pre
pared to introduce a "uniting for
peace" resolution to the council,
which could send the question to a
special session of the General As
sembly. Such a resolution would re
quire the support of nine of the 15
council members and would not be
subject to veto.
In Washington a report on Soviet
reinforcements by State Department
spokesman Hodding Carter
suggested that this foreign presence
in Afghanistan will become larger
and possibly even "permanent."
Carter said one or two more
Soviet infantry divisions, totalling
20,000 to 25,000 troops, recently
moved to the Afghan border and al
ready may have crossed, augment
ing 50,000 to 60,000 Soviet troops al
ready in that country.
In a portent of still further rein

forcement, Carter added that the
United States has indications that
two or three additional Soviet
ground force divisions — more than
30,000 men — may be mobilizing
north of the border.
Soviet purpose unclear
For the first time, U.S. official
comment went beyond a report on
the continuing Soviet influx to
speculation about its long-term pur
pose. Carter said that the extent and
nature of the equipment being deli
vered indicates that "there is no
thing expeditionary" about the
Soviet torce but that it is "probably
the core of a larger, permanent
torce to be deployed in the tuture."
Meanwhile, Moslem Afghan re
bels yesterday claimed control of
three districts about 25 miles troni
the nation's northern border with
the Soviet Union and the capture ot
two towns near Pakistan.
However, in a tacit acknowledge
ment of the interiority ot their posi
tion, the rebels said they are step
ping up hit-and-run guerrilla attacks
against the better-armed Soviet
troops.
The Soviets, armed with modern
weapons and backed by tanks and
warplanes, are reported to control
most ol the major cities and towns in
Afghanistan, but fighting through
out the countryside is believed con
tinuing.
U.S. displeasure
Separately the United States made
new decisions yesterday to show
displeasure by cutting back a broad
range of official and cultural ties
with the Soviet Union
Among the links to be affected is
the U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange
agreement, which provides for the
exchange of monthly magazines,
long-scale exhibitions, theatrical
performances, teachers, students
and other private citizens. Officials
said the United States will halt
negotiations on an extension of the
pact, which terminated Dec. 31.
Under guidelines to be estab
lished, according to officials, the
United States will place an indefinite
moratorium on high visibility visits
or exchanges with the Soviet Union.
Most trips involving officials of the
rank of assistant secretary and above
are being barred. The exceptions
will be those deemed to be of over
riding national importance, such as
arms control discussions.
Still under consideration is a re
duction in the Soviet diplomatic
presence in the United States, which
almost certainly would prompt a re
taliatory Soviet cutback in the U.S.
presence in Moscow
Another aspect ot the U.S. re
sponse to the situation in Afghanis
tan is renewed military and
economic assistance to that coun
try's threatened neighbor, Pakistan.

quest of Afghan government under
a mutual defense treaty.
After the vote, the council went
into private session to discuss
turther action in the Afghan case
and also to hear Secretary General
Kurt Waldheim report on his mis
sion to Iran.
On the Atghan issue, there are re
ports that the Philippines was pre
pared to introduce a "uniting for
peace" resolution to the council,
which could send the question to a
special session of the General As
sembly. Such a resolution would re
quire the support of nine of the 15
council members and would not be
subject to veto.
In Washington a report on Soviet
reinforcements by State Department
spokesman Hodding Carter
suggested that this foreign presence
in Afghanistan will become larger
and possibly even "permanent."
Carter said one or two more
Soviet infantry divisions, totalling
20,000 to 25,000 troops, recently
moved to the Afghan border and al
ready may have crossed, augment
ing 50,000 to 60,000 Soviet troops al
ready in that country.
In a portent of still further rein

forcement, Carter added that the
United States has indications that
two or three additional Soviet
ground force divisions — more than
30,000 men — may be mobilizing
north of the border.
Soviet purpose unclear
For the first time, U.S. official
comment went beyond a report on
the continuing Soviet influx to
speculation about its long-term pur
pose. Carter said that the extent and
nature of the equipment being deli
vered indicates that "there is no
thing expeditionary" about the
Soviet torce but that it is "probably
the core of a larger, permanent
torce to be deployed in the tuture."
Meanwhile, Moslem Afghan re
bels yesterday claimed control of
three districts about 25 miles troni
the nation's northern border with
the Soviet Union and the capture ot
two towns near Pakistan.
However, in a tacit acknowledge
ment of the interiority ot their posi
tion, the rebels said they are step
ping up hit-and-run guerrilla attacks
against the better-armed Soviet
troops.
The Soviets, armed with modern
weapons and backed by tanks and
warplanes, are reported to control
most ol the major cities and towns in
Afghanistan, but fighting through
out the countryside is believed con
tinuing.
U.S. displeasure
Separately the United States made
new decisions yesterday to show
displeasure by cutting back a broad
range of official and cultural ties
with the Soviet Union
Among the links to be affected is
the U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange
agreement, which provides for the
exchange of monthly magazines,
long-scale exhibitions, theatrical
performances, teachers, students
and other private citizens. Officials
said the United States will halt
negotiations on an extension of the
pact, which terminated Dec. 31.
Under guidelines to be estab
lished, according to officials, the
United States will place an indefinite
moratorium on high visibility visits
or exchanges with the Soviet Union.
Most trips involving officials of the
rank of assistant secretary and above
are being barred. The exceptions
will be those deemed to be of over
riding national importance, such as
arms control discussions.
Still under consideration is a re
duction in the Soviet diplomatic
presence in the United States, which
almost certainly would prompt a re
taliatory Soviet cutback in the U.S.
presence in Moscow
Another aspect ot the U.S. re
sponse to the situation in Afghanis
tan is renewed military and
economic assistance to that coun
try's threatened neighbor, Pakistan.
The Los Angeles Times
United Nations — The Soviet
Union yesterday vetoed a U.N. Sec
urity Council resolution calling tor
the immediate withdrawal of foreign
troops from Afghanistan, where a
Soviet invasion has spread through
out the country since late last
month.
The United States and 12 other
members voted for withdrawal.
Only East Germany voted with the
Russians.
Sponsored by Bangladesh,
jamaica, Niger, Zambia and the
Philippines, the resolution did not
mention the Soviet Union by name
but "deeply deplored" the armed
intervention in Afghanistan.
Soviets cast veto
After three days ol debate, in
which nearly all the 46 speakers at
tacked the intervention, the Soviet
ambassador, Oleg Troyanovsky, cast
his veto. Earlier he had said the re
solution was a "flagrant intervention
in the affairs of a sovereign state and
should be rejected."
U.S. Ambassador, Donald
McHenry, called the Soviet veto
"unfortunate" but told reporters: "I
think you can expect active discus
sion" within the next 24 hours on a
proposal to send the matter to the
General Assembly. The assembly
does not have the enforcement
powers of the council, but it can ex
press the will of the United Nations
as a whole, and its actions are not
subject to a veto.
The Kremlin has insisted that it
sent Soviet troops — now estimated
by U.S. officials at a total of 85,000
men — into Afghanistan at the re
quest of Afghan government under
a mutual defense treaty.
