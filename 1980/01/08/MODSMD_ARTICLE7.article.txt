The friction between Stanford's
fledgling student magazines has
ceased as they prepare their debut
issues, according to the editors of
Inside Stanford and the Inquisitor.
"Both magazines are ready to go
now," said sophomore Darren Bar
nett, co-editor of Inside Stanford.
Senior Mindy Mayer, creator and
co-editor of the Inquisitor, said that
the magazines can "peacefully go

their separate ways. I hold no hostil
ity toward Darren."
In a Nov. 28 Daily article, Barnett
charged that Mayer had taken in
formation and ideas for the In
quisitor from Inside Stanford. Mayer
gathered the material at a meeting
with Barnett, where she agreed to
work on Barnett's staff, he alleged.
Mayer had termed the charges
"ridiculous."
Prior to the article, Barnett's com
plaints were well known to at least
some members of both the Inside
Stanford staff and the ASSU Publica
tions Board, according to )ack
Trumpbour, chairman of the Publi
cations Board.
Barnett said recently the conflict
was a misunderstanding, brought on
by personal pressures and the pres
sure of starting up a magazine.
"There was never any question of
Mindy's right to go ahead with her
magazine," Barnett said. "It was my
personal ethical dispute that occur
red totally within myself."
Barnett added that although he
may still have "internal questions"
about the affair, "they won't influ
ence anything in the real world as far
as the two magazines are con
cerned."
Mayer said she-has had little con
tact with Barnett, but she believes
the conflict is over. "The hostilities
were all in Darren's mind, and Dar
ren's mind has changed," she said.
Both magazines plan to publish
their debut issues in late February or
March, a month later than previ
ously announced.
Inside Stanford has received a fair
response to requests for student
submissions, Barnett said. "We
won't come out until everyone on
the staff is satisfied with the mate
rial."
According to current plans, the

first issue of Inside Stanford will in
clude an excerpt from a book being
written by a Stanford student who
recently toured China. The issue will
also include columns on various to
pics, "similar in style to Saturday Re
view," Barnett said.
The Inquisitor has received
"plenty of fiction and photo
graphy," Mayer said. According to
her, the debut issue will include a
feature on San Francisco's Glide
Methodist Church, a "Baptist
church gone Sixties," where pic
tures of flowers, lovers holding
hands and hymn lyrics are flashed
on the wall.
Mayer said she expects Inside
Stanford to be a "general interest
and appeal magazine with standard
topics. . . . The Inquisitor will have
more off-the-wall stories, emphasiz
ing a creative and subjective" writ
ing style.
"I want our magazine to be a wri
ter's magazine," she added.
Both the Inquisitor and Inside
Stanford are canvassing local
businesses for advertising. Inside
Stanford has received $500 from the
Publications Board, and the staff
plans to foot the $2000 bill for their
first issue with additional revenue
from advertising and sales.
The Inquisitor has a less expensive
tabloid format, which will cost bet
ween $500 and $1000 to produce.
The Publications Board will consider
a $500 grant to the Inquisitor early
next week, according to
Trumpbour.
Trumpbour said that he is glad to
see the conflict between the two
magazines resolved. "It upsets me
to see new publications at odds. It's
like fighting for deck seats on the
Titanic."
