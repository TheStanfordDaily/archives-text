Looking for a class where
you can do as little or as
much work as you want and
still pass?
The Stanford Daily is offering a course entitled
"Working on a newspaper" (Stanford Daily 101). The
course will provide practical experience on a college
newspaper. Topics covered include story writing
(news, features, sports and entertainment), photo-
I graphy, editing, layout and much more. No pre
requisites (no journalism experience required).
Students doing at least one assignment will be
given a passing grade. If a student completes a sig-
nificant amount of work, credit will be given in
money (we call it compensation) instead of units.
Time: Sunday through Thursday, noon to 3 a.m.
(students can attend during this time as much or as
little as they would like).
Place: Storke Publications Building (across from
Terman Engineering Center).
Students interested in taking this course may attend
special introductory meetings tomorrow at 3:15
p.m. or Friday at 2:15 p.m. If you cannot make
these meetings, you can drop in any afternoon or
evening.
