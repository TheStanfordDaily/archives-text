# U.S. quotas hamper flow of new immigrants from China

Peking (AP) — Thousands of
Chinese-Americans now trying
to get their relatives out of
China after 30-year family sep
arations have a new frustra
tion: China is ready to let
them go, but U.S. quotas are
full.
"We get 10 to 20 letters a day
and one or two visits a week
from people who are very
concerned. It just rips your
heart out," said a U.S. Em
bassy official, who asked not
to be identified.
"Almost all the cases involve

an aged person," he added.
"We realize the immediacy
they feel. They worry that the
(Chinese) government could
change its policy or that they
won't be able to see their rela
tives before they die."
Top on the priority list right
now are married children ot
U.S. citizens, and spouses and
unmarried children of Chinese
granted permanent residency
in the United States. Their ap
plications have been on file
more than three years.
The backlog is six years for
brothers and sisters of U.S.
citizens.
A big reason for the overall
backlog is that the annual
quota ot 20,000 immigrant
visas for China must be shared
by all applicants who were
born in China, whether they
apply in Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Mainland China or abroad
elsewhere.
The U.S. Embassy in Peking
did not formally open until last
March 1, which is also when
the two governments im
plemented their policy on eas
ing family reunions.
Formerly, visas for those
from mainland China were
processed in Hong Kong — for
those who could get there.
Files on about 6000 applica
tions for immigrant visas, cov
ering about 15,000 people, re
cently were transferred to Pek
ing, the official said.
Four or five immigrant visas
a week are issued now, he
said, but the number is ex
pected to increase considera
bly once notifications reach
the 15,000 applicants whose
files were in Hong Kong that
they now can follow them up
in Peking.
It is more simple for those
who just want to visit. They get
exit permits from Chinese au
thorities, then line up at the
U.S. consulate in the morning.

Chances are good lhat they
can be on their way the next
day, the official said.
He said more than 6000
non-immigrant visas were is
sued in 1979, including 715 in
October.
About 30 people line up
each \of the four mornings a
week on which visa applicants
are interviewed. Many, having
traveled to Peking from far
away Chinese cities, already
are carrying their bags for their
flight to America.
Every afternoon, the consu
late handles visas tor 20 to 25
Chinese who are going to the
UnitecJ States under
exchange-student programs
sponsored by the Ministry of
Education and other official
organizations.
A deluge of applications is
expected when the new con
sulate in Canton begins handl
ing non-immigrant visa appli
cations in the next month or
two, and immigrant visas by
April or May.
"Most Americans of
Chinese ancestry are from
Guangdong (Kwangtung) pro
vince/which includes Canton
and borders Hong Kong, the
official explained.
"A broad segment of people
all 9ver China are applying for
and getting exit documents for
the United States," the official
said. "We like to be optimistic,
but we wonder how many
people have applied, and we
never hear that they were re
fused."
The embassy also has abouf
50 active cases of people in
China claiming U.S. citizen
ship, he said. These people
say they were born in the Un
ited States and came to China
before the 1949
takeover, or were born in
China of American parents. .
"In 30 years, critical docu :
ments have been lost," he
said.
