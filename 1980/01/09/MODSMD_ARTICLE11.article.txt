An exhibition of photographs of Peru opened yesterday at the Stanford Art Museum. "Peruvian

The above photo is by Chambi, a native Peruvian from Cuzco who was active from the 1920s until
his death in 1973. Ranney is a contemporary photographer who lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The
artists have each contributed complementary views of the country — of monuments of its Inca
heritage, the landscape and (from Chambi) ihe urban social life in the 1920s and JOs. Ranney will
speak here on Chambi's photographs later this month.
