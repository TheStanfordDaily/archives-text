# Clamshell alliance endorses some violence
## Anti-nuke groups split on tactics 
### 
Providence, K.I. (AP) â€” The ( lamshell Al
liance says it now endorses almost all types oi
protests against nuclear power plants, presum
ably including the destruc lion ot property. But
the Alliance will draw the line at violence
against people.
The policy was adopted Sunday .it an unpuh
licized conference attended by about 150 New
I ngland anti-nuc lear ac ti\ ists. [he ( lamshell Al
liance is a loose alliance ot about 80 environ
mentalist groups.
It was a vie lory lor the more militant wing ot
the movement which wanted to move beyond
the traditional civil disobedience and symbolic
protests used in the past.
"This does appear to remove the guidelines
against property destruction,' said William
Smith of Jamestown, who has been ac live in the
Alliance lor several years. "It's a concession by

the people who didn't want to cut lences."
rhe Coalition tor Direct Action, a splinter
group which has pushed tor more militant ac
tion, also announced it would attempt another
occupation ot the Seabrook, N.H. nuclear plant
on May 24.
The coalition's call tor destruction of prop
erty during last October's attempted takeover
of the $2.b billion Seabrook plant had split the
anti-nuclear movement.
Many members of the mam Clamshell office
in Portsmouth, N.H., denounced the more
forceful protests.
The question ot tactics had threatened to
split the two-day weekend conference at Brown
University. Those tavoring militant tactics took
one side ot the meeting room and those op
posed took the other.
