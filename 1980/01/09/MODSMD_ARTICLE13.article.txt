Would you like to share
your time and knowledge with
other students? The Under
graduate Program in the
School ol Education (UPSE)
helps University under
graduates who are interested
in working with younger stu
dents in local schools.
Students who participate in
the program "can pick and
choose. Any type ol student
request to tutor can be tilled,"
according to Tom Chenoweth,
UPSE coordinator. Students
here are tutoring emotionally
disturbed children at the Chil
dren's Hospital, coaching
football, acting as TAs in a high
school advanced placement
history class, and working in a
kindergarten.
"Tutoring has kept me sane
this quarter," said one tutor,
Sharon Tejeda. It keeps me in
touch with the outside world
and it helps me to do some
thing constructive."
There are "three major be
nefits to tutoring,"
Chenoweth said. "The
greatest benefit is the reward
of going out into the real
world and helping someone.
Undergraduates can learn
whether or not they're really
interested in a career in educa
tion. Tutoring also gives stu
dents a c hance to get oil cam
pus."
Communication skills
Rob Harris, a former tutor,
added that "students c an learn
valuable communication skills
through teaching kids. There
are tew opportunities on cam
pus lor students to try out

what they're actually learning.
By teaching a subject to
others, you reinforce your
own knowledge of the sub
ject. It's tun to perform a ser
vice and be learning at the
same time."
Prop I 1 has "devastated"
the schools, according to
Chenoweth. "They need all
the help we can give them,
and are really appreciative ot
(he tutors." Presently UPSE
has about 200 requests trom
local schools tor tutors.
Participants can earn two to
three units ol credit tor their
work. In addition to three to
tour hours in the classroom
each week, tutors keep a jour
nal of their experiences, com
plete a linal project and attend
conferences and seminars.

This quarter the program will
be more individually oriented
so that students will get help
with their particular situation,
Chenoweth said. He added
"the only prerequisite is an in
terest in helping others." The
tutoring is supervised so that
students can learn how to
share their knowledge, he ad
ded.
Tutoring in area schools was
formerly coordinated by Op
eration Share, a student-run
organization. However, be
ginning this quarter Operation
Share will no longer exist and
its activities will be conducted
through ui'si. Chenoweth
said that "The tutoring prog
ram will have the same tormjt,
but it will be a little more or
ganized. Harris, a lormer
coordinator lor SHAKE, said

"the changeover Ironi SHARI
to UPSE is a positive step.
We'll have more tirm time
commitments, more support
from the School ot Education,
and a program that will con
tinue after we have gone."
Other benefits
UPSE serves several other
tunctions as well. It was re
vived last year atter being
dormant since 1975 to help
make the School of Education
more accessible to under
graduates. Besides giving un
dergraduates an opportunity
for field experience in educa
tion, UPSE coordinated intor
mation tor school placement,
gives credit for supervised re
search in a students' lield ot
interest and serves as a coun
seling center on coursework
in education.
