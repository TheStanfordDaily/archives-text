## ASSU Senate is serious 
### 
Of all the resolutions made
in the waning moments ol
1979, one sober one should
stand out to the Stanford
community: that of the ASSU
Senate to take itselt — and its
constituency — seriously.
Though hardly an unbiased
observer (I was elected Chair,
of the senate on Nov. 14), I do
count mysell at least as an in
formed latecomer to the ASSU
events of the last tew months.
And I think that there is reason
to be, as the State Department
might say, "cautiously op
timistic" about this year's
body.
ASSU Senates usually do not
take themselves seriously, ol
course, otten to such an ex
tent that outsiders remark on
them cynically rather than en
thusiastically.
But past senates have not
always taken their constituen
cies seriously. The oft-heard
condemning observation ol
campus politicos is that thev
are quite visible during the
election process but amaz
ingly invisible afterwards. Or
worse, that they serve only to
consume Ironl page Daily
news space with scandals and
controversies that seem re
mote from student affairs.
The direction ot this year's
senate has been indisputably
shaped by attention to previ
ous senate tailures and pittalls.
Note several ol the legislative
and procedural changes to
date:
Attendance Requirements:
One ol the iirst actions ol this
year's senate was to consider
ably tighten senator alien
dance requirements. Ii was
obvious that irregularly at
tended senate meetings could
nol lead to informed, much
less respected, senate deci
sions.

Outreach Programs: The se
nate recognized early that
there exists a need for sys
tematic interaction with stu
dents. Though several district
ing proposals have been con
sidered (and deemed in
adequate), the senate has
gone ahead with production
of a newsletter to intorm stu
dents directly ot senate ac
tivities. The senate will con
duct its open (bi-weekly)
meetings in Tresidder this
quarter and will also embark
on a series ol dorm sherry
hours on topics ol both
specific and general nature.
An Accessible Office: In past
years, students may never
have known that there was an
ASSU Senate office. (It's less
clear that, having been told its
whereabouts, they could
ever have found it.)
The ASSU Senate otfice has
been moved Irom the lot! in
the ASSU Office to an area
along side the usual student
lines lor lecture notes. The ot
lice will be stalled starting
early this quarter.
The senate will additionally
seek active contact with 7he
Daily lor coverage ol its events
and will continue to use the
newspaper lor announce

ments of its activities.
It is important to realize,
though, that an accessible and
hard-working ASSU Senate
Still does not ensure the suc
cess of our student govern
ment system. At best, the
steps listed above are out
reach steps that demand re
sponses oi outreach. An ac-

cessible otfice, an informative
newsletter, and even a direct
sherry hour visit are no more
than opportunities tor interac
tion.
The senate will need to sol
icit the assistance as well as
the views of the Stantord stu
dent body. II the focus is to be
on the legislative process, and
not merely on legislation, then
the work ot task lories and
sub-committees must be that
much more thorough.
The senate is actively in
volved in many areas of per
ceived student interest al
ready. Among them are: cam
pus lighting and safety, Tre
sidder Union, housing, elec
tion reform, availability of ath
letic facilities and the feasibil
ity of an ASSU takeover of the
Coffee House. These and any
luture projects require ideas
and talents trom outside the
senate lor complete success.
Two years ago, the ASSU
Senate was hampered by elec
tion controversies. Last year,
senate visibility was restricted
to several otten troublesome
issues.
I'm not convinced that this
year's senate is destined tor a
substantially different turn ot
events, but, again, I think one

can he "cautiously optimis
tic." The trend thus tar is a
good one.
In October, a record
number ot individuals ran lor
— and voted tor — positions
in the ASM) Senate. It's time
to keep both parties visible.

in economics, is the chair of

Senate was hampered by elec
tion controversies. Last year,
senate visibility was restricted
to several otten troublesome
issues.
I'm not convinced that this
year's senate is destined tor a
substantially different turn ot
events, but, again, I think one

can he "cautiously optimis
tic." The trend thus tar is a
good one.
In October, a record
number ot individuals ran lor
— and voted tor — positions
in the ASM) Senate. It's time
to keep both parties visible.
(Mark lireier, a junior majoring
in economics, is the chair of
the senate.)
Of all the resolutions made
in the waning moments ol
1979, one sober one should
stand out to the Stanford
community: that of the ASSU
Senate to take itselt — and its
constituency — seriously.
Though hardly an unbiased
observer (I was elected Chair,
of the senate on Nov. 14), I do
count mysell at least as an in
formed latecomer to the ASSU
events of the last tew months.
And I think that there is reason
to be, as the State Department
might say, "cautiously op
timistic" about this year's
body.
ASSU Senates usually do not
take themselves seriously, ol
course, otten to such an ex
tent that outsiders remark on
them cynically rather than en
thusiastically.
But past senates have not
always taken their constituen
cies seriously. The oft-heard
condemning observation ol
campus politicos is that thev
are quite visible during the
election process but amaz
ingly invisible afterwards. Or
worse, that they serve only to
consume Ironl page Daily
news space with scandals and
controversies that seem re
mote from student affairs.
The direction ot this year's
senate has been indisputably
shaped by attention to previ
ous senate tailures and pittalls.
Note several ol the legislative
and procedural changes to
date:
Attendance Requirements:
One ol the iirst actions ol this
year's senate was to consider
ably tighten senator alien
dance requirements. Ii was
obvious that irregularly at
tended senate meetings could
nol lead to informed, much
less respected, senate deci
sions.

Outreach Programs: The se
nate recognized early that
there exists a need for sys
tematic interaction with stu
dents. Though several district
ing proposals have been con
sidered (and deemed in
adequate), the senate has
gone ahead with production
of a newsletter to intorm stu
dents directly ot senate ac
tivities. The senate will con
duct its open (bi-weekly)
meetings in Tresidder this
quarter and will also embark
on a series ol dorm sherry
hours on topics ol both
specific and general nature.
An Accessible Office: In past
years, students may never
have known that there was an
ASSU Senate office. (It's less
clear that, having been told its
whereabouts, they could
ever have found it.)
The ASSU Senate otfice has
been moved Irom the lot! in
the ASSU Office to an area
along side the usual student
lines lor lecture notes. The ot
lice will be stalled starting
early this quarter.
The senate will additionally
seek active contact with 7he

and will continue to use the

It is important to realize,
though, that an accessible and
hard-working ASSU Senate
Still does not ensure the suc
cess of our student govern
ment system. At best, the
steps listed above are out
reach steps that demand re
sponses oi outreach. An ac-

cessible otfice, an informative
newsletter, and even a direct
sherry hour visit are no more
than opportunities tor interac
tion.
The senate will need to sol
icit the assistance as well as
the views of the Stantord stu
dent body. II the focus is to be
on the legislative process, and
not merely on legislation, then
the work ot task lories and
sub-committees must be that
much more thorough.
The senate is actively in
volved in many areas of per
ceived student interest al

pus lighting and safety, Tre
sidder Union, housing, elec
tion reform, availability of ath
letic facilities and the feasibil
ity of an ASSU takeover of the
Coffee House. These and any
luture projects require ideas
and talents trom outside the
