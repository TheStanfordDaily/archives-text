# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Sartoris Carter's Olympic threat unjustified 
### 
As part of our nation's re
sponse to the recent Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan, Presi
dent Carter hinted at the pos
sibility of an American boycott
of the upcoming Olympic
Games to be held in Moscow.
Tor a politic al leader who only
last month appeared on the
cover of Runner's World
magazine, implying support
tor physical litness and sport
to a voting public, this an
nouncement is an undeniable
inconsistency.
Despite the current gravity
of Russian aggression in an
area where American citizens
continue to be held hostage,
the president demonstrated a
clear misunderstanding of the
athlete and his brand ot com
petition.

The Olympic Games are a
traditional event held every
four years for the purpose of
bringing together the world's
finest amateur athletes in a
variety of competitive sports.
While the media and political
leaders would lead the spec
tator to think otherwise, they
are not intended to represent
a battle between nations or
ideologies.
In past Games, far too much
emphasis has been placed
upon the country of origin of
the participants, as well as the
cumulative medal total earned
by athletes ol each nation.
That politics do not belong in
the Olympics was de
monstrated in the 1968
Munich Games, where several
Israeli athletes were tragically

murdered by terrorists linked
to an on-going Middle East
crisis.
Ideally, the Olympic Games
should be an arena where
athletes draw their nations to
gether in the spirit of friendly
competition. The participants
share a common goal which
only they can tully under
stand: the personal fulfillment
and self-satisfaction of doing
one's best at the culmination
of years of training, self
discipline and sacrifice.
This mutual bond trans
cends all prejudice, nationalis
tic pride, racial barriers, and
ideological differences. Win
or lose, each athlete humbly
respects what he or she knows
each tellow participant has
had to endure in order to qual
ify for mankind's acme of
physical ablity.
A second, less important but
more practical, factor figures
strongly in the implications ot
Carter's recent announce
ment. While the Olympic
teams ot most other participat
ing nations receive financial
support from their respective
governments, the United
States' athletes depend
primarily upon donations from
public and private sources. In
view of this fact, even if
Soviet-American relations con
tinued to deteriorate, it would
be unjustifiable for our gov
ernment to order American
athletes to abstain from par
ticipation in the Moscow
Games, unless of course a
threat to their safety existed.
Even it not carried through
to its fulfillment, the presi
dent's implied action will un
doubtedly have a significant
negative influence upon the
lives of our athletes. Many of
these individuals have given
up other aspects of their lives
for the dedication necessary to
achieve the level of Olympic
competition.
Suddenly, all because of
political maneuvering, they
discover that the dream of a
lifetime may not be capable of
realization. At a time when
their training should be inten
sifying so as to peak for the
event, they are instead faced
with the unmotivating possi
bility that all their work may
have been for nothing.
The detrimental impact of
Carter's threatened boycott of
the 1980 Olympic Games
should be clear from the pre
ceding remarks. While much
of the American public has be
come more aware of the im

portance of physical fitness
and sport in recent years, it is
apparent that at least some ot
our political leaders have not.
It is truly a shame that our
government sees lit to spend
millions on preparation tor a
future war with the Soviet Un
ion, and yet cannot bring itsell
to support peaceful competi
tion with that nation. Perhaps
when an Olympic team be
comes a higher tinanc ial prior
ity than anti-ballistic missiles,
mutual understanding bet
ween nations can begin to
work toward that heretofore
unknown entity we call "world
peace."
