# Faculty Senate to vote on Western Culture
## 
### Jill Liscom 
A unanimous committee recom
mendation to reinstate the Western
Culture requirement that would
start this tall, will be considered at
the Faculty Senate meeting tomor
row.
Under the new requirement, re
commended by the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS), en
tering freshmen would have to take
a year-long sequence in Western
•■ A ■

Culture. At least lour sequences
would be ottered.
It adopted, the proposals would
be the greatest change in the Uni
versity's undergraduate curriculum
in 10 years.
According to Assoc. History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee, CUS chairman, the
issue "has been discussed ott and
on for the past year and a halt" by
the committee, and discussed in
depth at the five CUS meetings au

tumn quarter.
The recommendation was unani
mously passed late last quarter,
Lougee said, based on "the high
quality of the courses that have been
developed" and"the eminence ot
people who have been recruited to
teach."
Lougee said she expects the se
nate to approve the requirement.
"I think that because the senate
asked tor a feasible Western Culture
program and is being given a strong
program with great merit, the senate
will pass it," Lougee said.
According to Philosophy Pro!.
|ohn Perry, chairman ot the Western
Culture Pilot Program Committee,
there is "much better than a 50-50
chance" that the senate will support
the proposal.
"The main question is how the
new Western Culture requirement is
going to lit into the distribution re
quirement," he added.
Perry said that simply adding the
new requirement to present dis
tribution requirements "would
create a lot ot problems."
The pilot committee has proposed
that entering Ireshmen be required
to take one course in each ol seven
other subject areas to t Lilt ill the dis
tribution requirement. Faculty
panels would determine which
courses in those areas would fulfill
the distribution requirement. At
least one course chosen must locus
on a non-Western culture.
In December 1976 the Faculty Se
nate approved a task force to study
the leasibility ot a Western Culture
requirement. Based on the task

force's report, the senate voted in
1978 to begin a Western Culture
Pilot Program.
Under that program, the Univer
sity ottered several sequences to
ireshmen on a voluntary basis start
ing in September 1978.
According to Perry, more than b()0
students are involved in the prog-
Kim this year and about 400-500 stu
dents participated in the program
last year.
Based on these tigures, Perry said
that about one-third ol the freshmen
class chose to take the Western Cul
ture c ourses voluntarily.
