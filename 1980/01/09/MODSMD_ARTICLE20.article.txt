## America is oppressor in Iran 
### 
I believe there are three
questions whose answers sum
up the U.S.-Iranian c risis I will
pose these questions ,md m\
answers lo them
1) Why did the lr.ini.in stu
dents occupy the U.S. Em
bassy?
I am convinced thai the
shah's coming to the United
States was only the straw thai
broke the camel s back. Re
volutionary Iran's relations
with the United Stales had
been bad belore the shah es
caped Irom his colony. They

Hdd lo hi 1 hdd.
It was the United States
which put the shah on his im
perial throne in 1952. It was
the United States which sold
him the weapons he used to
oppress his people. It was the
United States advisors who
advised him on how to op
press his people.
It was the United States' CIA
whith trained the shah's hor
ribly criminal secret police
(SAVAK) and c ollaborated with
it in hunting the shah's oppo
nents abroad. Hie U.S. Em
bassy in I ehran was used as an
American base to collaborate
with the criminal shah in op
pressing the Iranian people.
21 Wlhit ore the ospects
oI the crisis?
The Iranian students (and
governmenti demand that the
U.S. government send the
shah to Iran to stand trial in
return lor the release ot the
American hostages. Although
the following point is rarely
heard, the U.S. government in
tact has a criminal exchange
treaty with the Iran govern
ment. Ihe shah is ,11 riminal by
his land's standards so, in
purely legal terms, lie should
be extradited to his country to
lace its justice.

. . . Aggressors will be punished hand for
hand, head for head. . . .

Indeed, had Richard Nixon
lied to Iran, prior to his im
peachment, I would have ex
pec led the Iranian govern
ment to return him to the Un
ited Stales to (ace its justice —
regardless oi whether the Ipa*
man government thought
Nixon was or was not a crimi
nal.
But, does the United States'
harboring the shah justity leg
ally the seizure ot the Ameri
can embassy' I he Iranian stu
dents c harge that the embassy
was used to spy on their re
volution and to plot against
Iran. Should this charge be
well-lounded, the embassy's
diplomatic immunity is nul
litied and so is the diplomatic
immunity ol its personnel
who, as spies, can be tried in
the courts ol the host country
and according to its laws.
There are dozens ot similar

incidents where Britain, Fr
ance, the Soviet Union and
many other states have seized
toreign embassy personnel
accused ol spying or espion
age and interrogated them,
tins is exactly what the Iranian
authorities are going to do:
they are going to interrogate
the Americans they have ac
cused ol spying and espion
age.
Should these Americans be
tound guilty ol spying and es
pionage, there are dozens ol
precedents in which nations,
including the United States,
have e\c hanged spies and leg
ally held individuals.
II is worthy ol notice here
that the Iranian government
has promised that any Ameri
can who will he found inno
cent, in the proposed trial, will
he released whether the shah
has been returned to Iran or
not.
ii Wli.it should he done
now?
Religious and so-called
humanist groups should re
train irom siding with either
parly in this crisis. I believe,
lor example, that it was hypoc
iilic.il ol the Pope to try to in
terfere on behall ol the Ameri
can hostages, lor, where was

his "Christian love" when the
criminal shah, with the lull
support and direction of the
United States was killing Ira
nians right and let Should
anybody interfere as inter
mediaries, they should do jus
tice to both parties — through
work on releasing the Ameri
can hostages m return lor the
shah's extradition to Iran.
I believe that the U.S. gov
ernment will act as arrogantly
as ever and will not send the
shah to the Iranian authorities.
The U.S. government is al
ready showing ils military im
perialist might in the Arabian
Sea and lliiealemng to
"punish" Iran.
"Punishing" Iran, in any
serious manner, will be ex
tremely stupid lor at least two
reasons.
a) Should the United States
harm Iran, the Iranian stu-

dents will probably kill their
hostages;
b) The Islamic world is not
going to passively watch
America invade Iran, bomb
Iran or seriously harm Iran in
any other way.
Indeed there is already a
strong feeling ol solidarity and
brotherhood as well as a
strong anti-American, anti-
Western, anti-materialist sen
timent throughout the Muslim
world, this sentiment was ex
pressed in attacks on U.S. em
bassies in Turkey, India, Pakis
tan, Kuwait, lebanon, Saudi
Arabia, etc.
Should the U.S. "punish"
Iran, American interests as
well as personnel throughout
the Muslim world will be
"punished" back following
the Islamic moral-legal rule,
"Aggressors will be punished
hand for hand, head for
head."
Ol course, tor the United
Slates lo "wail and hope for
the best" lor its hostages is no
thing short ol an insult to its
imperialist honor as a world
power. Many Americans are
concerned about their coun
try's pride and honor. This is
understandable, though defi
nitely not justifiable because
lor very long that pride and
that honor meant insult,
humiliation, oppression, and,
yes, murder, tor a lot of us in
the so-called Third World. We
see examples ol this in Pales
tine, Nicaragua, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Cuba, Lebanon,
Morocco, /aire and Iran.
I rankly, I believe that, re
gardless ol its outcome, the
seizure of the embassy gives
America a c hance to taste what
it has been feeding the Third
World for very, very long.

I believe there are three
questions whose answers sum
up the U.S.-Iranian c risis I will
pose these questions ,md m\
answers lo them
1) Why did the lr.ini.in stu
dents occupy the U.S. Em
bassy?
I am convinced thai the
shah's coming to the United
States was only the straw thai
broke the camel s back. Re
volutionary Iran's relations
with the United Stales had
been bad belore the shah es
caped Irom his colony. They

Hdd lo hi 1 hdd.
It was the United States
which put the shah on his im
perial throne in 1952. It was
the United States which sold
him the weapons he used to
oppress his people. It was the
United States advisors who
advised him on how to op
press his people.
It was the United States' CIA
whith trained the shah's hor
ribly criminal secret police
(SAVAK) and c ollaborated with
it in hunting the shah's oppo
nents abroad. Hie U.S. Em
bassy in I ehran was used as an
American base to collaborate
with the criminal shah in op
pressing the Iranian people.
21 Wlhit ore the ospects
oI the crisis?
The Iranian students (and
governmenti demand that the
U.S. government send the
shah to Iran to stand trial in
return lor the release ot the
American hostages. Although
the following point is rarely
heard, the U.S. government in
tact has a criminal exchange
treaty with the Iran govern
ment. Ihe shah is ,11 riminal by
his land's standards so, in
purely legal terms, lie should
be extradited to his country to
lace its justice.

. . . Aggressors will be punished hand for
hand, head for head. . . .

Indeed, had Richard Nixon
lied to Iran, prior to his im
peachment, I would have ex
pec led the Iranian govern
ment to return him to the Un
ited Stales to (ace its justice —
regardless oi whether the Ipa*
man government thought
Nixon was or was not a crimi
nal.
But, does the United States'
harboring the shah justity leg
ally the seizure ot the Ameri
can embassy' I he Iranian stu
dents c harge that the embassy
was used to spy on their re
volution and to plot against
Iran. Should this charge be
well-lounded, the embassy's
diplomatic immunity is nul
litied and so is the diplomatic
immunity ol its personnel
who, as spies, can be tried in
the courts ol the host country
and according to its laws.
There are dozens ot similar

incidents where Britain, Fr
ance, the Soviet Union and
many other states have seized
toreign embassy personnel
accused ol spying or espion
age and interrogated them,
tins is exactly what the Iranian
authorities are going to do:
they are going to interrogate
the Americans they have ac
cused ol spying and espion
age.
Should these Americans be
tound guilty ol spying and es
pionage, there are dozens ol
precedents in which nations,
including the United States,
have e\c hanged spies and leg
ally held individuals.
II is worthy ol notice here
that the Iranian government
has promised that any Ameri
can who will he found inno
cent, in the proposed trial, will
he released whether the shah
has been returned to Iran or
not.
ii Wli.it should he done
now?
Religious and so-called
humanist groups should re
train irom siding with either
parly in this crisis. I believe,
lor example, that it was hypoc
iilic.il ol the Pope to try to in
terfere on behall ol the Ameri
can hostages, lor, where was

his "Christian love" when the
criminal shah, with the lull
support and direction of the
United States was killing Ira
nians right and let Should
anybody interfere as inter
mediaries, they should do jus
tice to both parties — through
work on releasing the Ameri
can hostages m return lor the
shah's extradition to Iran.
I believe that the U.S. gov
ernment will act as arrogantly
as ever and will not send the
shah to the Iranian authorities.
The U.S. government is al
ready showing ils military im
perialist might in the Arabian
Sea and lliiealemng to
"punish" Iran.
"Punishing" Iran, in any
serious manner, will be ex
tremely stupid lor at least two
reasons.
a) Should the United States
harm Iran, the Iranian stu-

dents will probably kill their
hostages;
b) The Islamic world is not
going to passively watch
America invade Iran, bomb
Iran or seriously harm Iran in
any other way.
Indeed there is already a
strong feeling ol solidarity and
brotherhood as well as a
strong anti-American, anti-
Western, anti-materialist sen
timent throughout the Muslim
world, this sentiment was ex
pressed in attacks on U.S. em
bassies in Turkey, India, Pakis
tan, Kuwait, lebanon, Saudi
Arabia, etc.
Should the U.S. "punish"
Iran, American interests as
well as personnel throughout
the Muslim world will be
"punished" back following
the Islamic moral-legal rule,
"Aggressors will be punished
hand for hand, head for
head."
Ol course, tor the United
Slates lo "wail and hope for
the best" lor its hostages is no
thing short ol an insult to its
imperialist honor as a world
power. Many Americans are
concerned about their coun
try's pride and honor. This is
understandable, though defi
nitely not justifiable because
lor very long that pride and
that honor meant insult,
humiliation, oppression, and,
yes, murder, tor a lot of us in
the so-called Third World. We
see examples ol this in Pales
tine, Nicaragua, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Cuba, Lebanon,
Morocco, /aire and Iran.
