# Scientists suggest dinosaurs killed by asteroid collision

The Washington Post
San Francisco — The extinction
ot the dinosaurs some 65 mill
ion years ago, one ot the
major mysteries ot geology,
was caused by a collision bet
ween earth and a giant as
teroid, according to a team ol
scientists led by Nobel
Laureate Luis Alvarez.
The asteroid hit the earth
with a force equal to a hydro
gen bomb explosion of 100
million megatons, vaporizing
so much rock that the dust
blocked out the sun's light tor
as long as five years, Alvarez
suggested. The loss ot sunlight
could have killed oil all plant
lite in the sea and On land that
grew by photosynthesis, he
said.
"Not only the dinosaurs
were made extinct 65 million
years ago, all kinds of animal
life disappeared at that time,"
Alvarez told an audience of
scientists at the 146 th annual
meeting ol the American As
sociation lor the Advancement
of Science. "The result ol the
main food chain being turned
oil on earth may have been
mass starvation ol animals de
pending on plants for nutri
tion."
To back up his theory, Al
varez said he and his geologist
son, Walter, collected in lour
locations on earth clay sam
ples formed 65 million years
ago. They found the clay laced
with a rare mix ol heavy metals
like iridium — found only in

meteorites. Alvarez said that
exhaustive analysis of the four
clays show they could not
have come from any event .on
earth, even an erupting vol
cano.
'Physical evidence'
"As far as we can tell, we've
found the first physical evi
dence that something strange
happened 65 million years
ago," said Alvarez, a world
renowned physicist at the
University of California who
won the Nobel Prize in 1968.
"These samples look to us as if
they came from something ex
traterrestial, not some mun
dane form of Earth happen
ing."
The lour clays analyzed by
Alvarez came from ancient
rock iormations in Italy, De
nmark, Spain and a deep-sea
core that iormed 65 million
years ago during the 5000-year
boundary between the Cre
taceous and Tertiary periods
of geologic time. The clay lay
trapped between limestone
layers that marked 8000 years
ot the Cretaceous and 15,000
years of the Tertiary period.
The clay taken from the
Grubbio Valley north of Rome
contained 60 times as much
iridium as is found in any part
ot the Earth's crust. The
Danish and Spanish samples
held 160 times more iridium
than .pormal.
One of mass extinctions
The dinosaurs thrived all the
way through the Cretaceous

period, then suddenly disap
peared at the start of the Ter
tiary. The existence of animal
life between the Cretaceous
and Tertiary is one of five mass
extinctions documented from
the fossil record dating back
570 million years to the begin
ning of the Cambrian period.
Countless theories have
been advanced lor the disap
pearance of the dinosaurs, in
cluding the onset of an Ice Age
that killed off their tood sup
ply and the appearance on
earth of a poisonous plant that
dinosaurs ate with such gusto
that it killed them.
The theory that keeps com
ing back is that there was a
"supernova," or exploding
star, in the nearby heavens
that showered the Earth with
cosmic rays for hundreds of
years, destroying all species of
animal unable to find shelter
from the radiation.
Other theories attacked
In proposing that an as
teroid collision caused the ex
tinction of the dinosaurs, Al
varez set out to prove that the
supernova theory was wrong.
Alvarez matched the quantity
of metals like iridium and os
mium found in the 65-
million-year-old clays with
what one would expect from
an exploding star, and calcu
lated that the star would have
been forty times closer to
earth than the nearest star
(alpha centauri) is today.

The Washington Post
San Francisco — The extinction
ot the dinosaurs some 65 mill
ion years ago, one ot the
major mysteries ot geology,
was caused by a collision bet
ween earth and a giant as
teroid, according to a team ol
scientists led by Nobel
Laureate Luis Alvarez.
The asteroid hit the earth
with a force equal to a hydro
gen bomb explosion of 100
million megatons, vaporizing
so much rock that the dust
blocked out the sun's light tor
as long as five years, Alvarez
suggested. The loss ot sunlight
could have killed oil all plant
lite in the sea and On land that
grew by photosynthesis, he
said.
"Not only the dinosaurs
were made extinct 65 million
years ago, all kinds of animal
life disappeared at that time,"
Alvarez told an audience of
scientists at the 146 th annual
meeting ol the American As
sociation lor the Advancement
of Science. "The result ol the
main food chain being turned
oil on earth may have been
mass starvation ol animals de
pending on plants for nutri
tion."
To back up his theory, Al
varez said he and his geologist
son, Walter, collected in lour
locations on earth clay sam
ples formed 65 million years
ago. They found the clay laced
with a rare mix ol heavy metals
like iridium — found only in

meteorites. Alvarez said that
exhaustive analysis of the four
clays show they could not
have come from any event .on
earth, even an erupting vol
cano.
'Physical evidence'
"As far as we can tell, we've
found the first physical evi
dence that something strange
happened 65 million years
ago," said Alvarez, a world
renowned physicist at the
University of California who
won the Nobel Prize in 1968.
"These samples look to us as if
they came from something ex
traterrestial, not some mun
dane form of Earth happen
ing."
The lour clays analyzed by
Alvarez came from ancient
rock iormations in Italy, De
nmark, Spain and a deep-sea
core that iormed 65 million
years ago during the 5000-year
boundary between the Cre
taceous and Tertiary periods
of geologic time. The clay lay
trapped between limestone
layers that marked 8000 years
ot the Cretaceous and 15,000
years of the Tertiary period.
The clay taken from the
Grubbio Valley north of Rome
contained 60 times as much
iridium as is found in any part
ot the Earth's crust. The
Danish and Spanish samples
held 160 times more iridium
than .pormal.
One of mass extinctions
The dinosaurs thrived all the
way through the Cretaceous

period, then suddenly disap
peared at the start of the Ter
tiary. The existence of animal
life between the Cretaceous
and Tertiary is one of five mass
extinctions documented from
the fossil record dating back
570 million years to the begin
ning of the Cambrian period.
Countless theories have
been advanced lor the disap
pearance of the dinosaurs, in
cluding the onset of an Ice Age
that killed off their tood sup
ply and the appearance on
earth of a poisonous plant that
dinosaurs ate with such gusto
that it killed them.
