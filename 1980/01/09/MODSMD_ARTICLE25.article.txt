# 'Best work' not necessary qualification
## Pulitzer Prize criteria: guts and guilty conscience 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
Los Angeles — Last April, the
weekly Point Reyes light in
Northern California became
one ot the smallest newspap
ers ever to win a Prize. The
Light, with a circulation ot
2700, was given the Pulitzer
public service award lor its
stories exposing conditions in
Synanon, the drug and alcohol
rehabilitation program.
But many members ot the
Pulitzer Prize Board — and ot
the nominating jury that re
commended The Light to the
board — have told The Los
Angeles Times that they ulti
mately voted to give the prize
to The Light more because it
was a small paper whose
editors had shown great cour
age, at considerable financial
risk, than because the paper's
Synanon stories were neces
sarily better than the three
other finalists in the public
service category.
Virtually everyone in the
Pulitzer selection process ag
rees that The Light's stories
were excellent — worthy ot
Pulitzer consideration on
purely journalistic terms.
"But it you took the names
of the newspapers off the en
tries, I would definitely have
voted tor The C hicago Tribune
series on the problems of the
aging," said Michael O'Neill,
editor ot The New York Daily
News and a member of the

Pulitzer public service jury in
1979.
"In fact, from the standpoint
ot journalistic quality," O'Neill
said, "There were at least
three or tour entries better
than Point Reyes."
Several members of the
Pulitzer board said they, too,
might have voted tor the
Tribune series — or lor one ot
the other finalists, The
Chicago Sun-Times or The Los
\ngeles Times had they not
been influenced by the con
trast between the size and re
sources of these papers and
the meager husband-wife op
eration at Point Reyes.
"1 he job that couple did was
damn good," one board
member said, "But the guts
they showed, with Synanon
just a few miles down the road
. . . that's what the Pulitzers
are all about; that's what won
the award."
Contrary to what is generally
thought, by journalists and the
public alike, Pulitzer Prizes in
journalism are not given lor
"the best" work in each
category but lor "A distin
guished example" of work in
each category.
It you just gave the award
lor the best' work," said
board member lames Reston
ot the New York Times,
"money and si/e would count
too much, and you'd give all
the prizes to the same three or

tour or tive papers every year.
I he prizes would just become
the plaything of the big and
rich."
Thus, contrary to wide
spread criticism in the indus
try, the Pulitzer Prize Board is
"often tar likelier to lean in
tavor ot small-town papers
than in tavor ot the large met
ropolitan dailies that are
widely thought to dominate
the selection process."
"One ol the journalist
characteristics ot the jour
nalists is sympathy lor the un
derdog," said board member
Clayton Kirkpatrick, president
ol The Chicago Tribune.
"Whenever a smaller paper
comes in with an entry ol
especially high quality, there's
a tilt on the board (toward that
paper)."
This is but one ol the several
ways in which Pulitzer Prizes
are sometimes awarded on the
basis ol personal sentiment,
rather than sheer journalistic
merit. Interviews with past and
present members ol the
Pulitzer board and with the
board's many nominating
jciries — and a detailed study
ot more than 50 years ol jury
and board selections — make
it clear that the board some
times also gives prizes to:
— Older journalists who are
demonstrably past their peak
but who deserved awards and
didn't get them in earlier

years. "We call this 'voting our
guilty consciences'," said one
board member. (Two recent
examples: Sportswriter Red
Smith of the New York limes,
who won the commentary
prize in 1976 and drama critic
Walter Kerr ot the New York
limes, who won the criticism
prize in 1978. Both were cited
for the body of their work, as
well as work in the specific
year.
People who were re
commended lor prizes by
juries but rejected by the
board in previous years.
The board also bypasses de
serving entries sometimes to
give prizes to admittedly in
ferior entries so as to avoid:
— Giving more than one
award to the same paper in
one year.
Giving a prize to some
one who has won before.
But the most irequent
"Sentimental-emotional-roman
tic vote" — as one board
member calls it — is clearly tor
the small paper over the big
paper.
Virtually every member ol
the Pulitzer board told
The Los Angeles Times ot the
special pleasure he felt in vot
ing lor the Point Reyes Light
last year.
"There was ecstatic excite
ment all around the (board)
table," said board member
William McGill, president ol

Columbia University, which
sponsors the prizes.
Last year may have been the
most sentimental year ot all tor
the Pulitzers. Board members
also gave prizes to the
Pottsdown (Pa.) Mercury (cir
culation 30,000) and the
Pottsville 1 Pa. > Republic an
(Circulation 28,000) in head
to-head competition with
papers from Chicago,
Philadelphia and Washington.
But this is no isolated
phenomenon. The board has
also given Pulitzers over the
last live years to small papers
in Lutkin, Tex., Xenia, Ohio;
and Anchorage, Alaska.
"I was chairman of the jury
that gave the (1977 public ser
vice) award to Lufkin," said
Norman Cherniss, executive
editor ol the Riverside, (Calif.)
Press-Enterprises. "II that same
story had been in The New
York Times, Washington Post
or L.A. Times, it probably
wouldn't have gotten the
award.
"Editors just have a special
place in their hearts tor small
papers."
Lhe sentimentality ol big
city board members is not the
only explanation lor this
phenomenon. Another is the
structure ol the Pulitzer jury
system. Board rules prohibit
anyone from serving on a jury
for a category in which his
newspaper has an entry. Be

cause I lie major big-city pap
ers generally have entries in
almost every category, the
juries are often dominated by
the small-to-medium-sized
papers.
Thus, in one recent year
selected at random, only 12 ot
50 jurors came from newspap
ers in the nation's 20 largest
cities. Hut it is the Pulitzer
board that makes the tinal
prize decision — alter the
juries select at least three
finalists from as many as 150
entries in each category — and
the board's sentimental at
tachment to the smaller pap
ers is an undeniable factor: A
Los Angeles Times study
shows that when the board
overturns a jury recommenda
tion, it is almost twice as likely
to reject a large paper in favor
of a small paper as it is to re
ject a small paper in favor of a
large paper.
There are other instances of
Pulitzer by sentiment — how
ever most board members
may publicly insist they are
unaware of it.
An even better example of
the role that sentiment plays in
the Pulitzer process — better
because some board members
will admit to it, at least off the
record — involves the board's
tendency to avoid repeat win
ners, even when that means
giving the prize to a less
deserving entry.
