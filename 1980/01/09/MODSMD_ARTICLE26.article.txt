### 
New Orleans (AP) — Ignor
ing the threat ot <1 lawsuit trom
a women's organization and
overcoming stiff opposition
within its own ranks, the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic As
sociation voted Tuesday to
sponsor women's champion
ships in Divisions II and 111.
This is a momentous deci
sion, a historic decision," said
one delegate, Many observers
feel the stage could be set for
the venerable, male
dominated NCAA to assimi
late the growing women's
movement in athletics.
The vote to include wo
men's championships < ame
amid a flurry ot activity which
saw the NCAA conclude its
annual convention a day
early. In other notable action,
delegates:
—Narrowly rejected a prop
osal to torce Division I basket
ball schools without football
programs to sponsor eight
sports;
-Adopted a resolution in
support oi President Carter
should he decide the United
Mates ought to boycott the
1980 Moscow Olympics be
cause ot the Russian invasion
ol Afghanistan.
Although the women's
championships concern only
fhe smaller schools, it was the
most significant development
in the three-day meeting ot
the decision-makers of college
sports.
Two days earlier, the As
sociation of Intercollegiate
Athletics tor Women (AIAW)
sent a telegram to the NCAA
convention saying, in effect,
"keep ott our turf." The tele
gram threatened legal action it
the NCAA adopted the wo
men's championships, and
during Tuesday's debate one
delegate, Gail Fullerton of San
lose State University, said the

move could "sound the death
knell tor the AIAW."
Beginning in 1981, the 282
Division II and 180 Division 111
NCAA members will otter
championships in Women's
basketball, field hockey,
swimming, tennis and vol
leyball.
Alter the voting. Division I
schools, led by the Pac-10
Conference, mounted a un
successful attempt to have the
action rescinded.
The threat to the AIAW is fi
nancial. The NCAA, with re
ceipts from its richly success
ful basketball tournament,
pays all team expenses, includ
ing a per diem stipend, tor all
championship events. The less
financially endowed AIAW
does not.
Most schools hold joint
membership in the NCAA and
AIAW and, as Fullerton
pointed out, "In these days ol
continuing financial restric
tions, most school administra
tions, given a choice ol
championships to go to,
would choose the least expen
sive."
