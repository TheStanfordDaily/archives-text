## Stanford's turning point is in Washington 
### Chris Haft 
The "turning point" — that
old friend of sportswriters,
sportscasters and other cliche
artists — has arrived now tor
Stanford's men's basketball
team.
Whether or not the Cardi
nals will improve their 3-9
overall and 1-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference records will be deter
mined by their fortunes in to
morrow night's game at
Washington and Saturday
night's contest at Washington
State.
Until last Saturday's game
against Arizona at Maples
Pavilion, the Cards had ap
peared destined for last place
in the Pac-10. They had lost
eight consecutive games. They
lost two games they could
have won (USC and Arizona
State) and another that they
were supposed to lose
(UCLA).
During these games Stan
ford's ballhandling problems
persisted; this, coupled with
the physical disadvantages the
Cards faced and were certain
to face in every tuture game,
portended doom.
Then against Arizona, a
team gifted with stellar guards
)oe Nehls and Russell Brown
and spring-footed pivotmen,
Stanford shot, passed and de
fensed its way to an astound
ing 99-80 victory. The 99 points
were the most a Card team has
ever scored in a conference
game.
"It was a tremendous confi
dence boost for us," Stanford
coach Dick Dißiaso said of the
Arizona conquest. "When you
are in that type of situation
(the losing streak) — which
you have to go through to re
ally, truly understand — your
faith and beliefs are really
being tested . . . particularly
when you know that you are
doing the right thing but are
just making mistakes."
It the Cards stop making ex
cessive mistakes against the

Northwest schools, it means
that efforts like the one against
Arizona will be repeated. If the
mistakes resume, then the vic
tory will surely be regarded as
a fluke.
Fluke is the word that comes
to mind when looking at
Washington's record. The
Huskies are 8-3 overall, but all
their losses have come when
they can least afford them —
in Pac-10 games.
Nevertheless, Dißiaso re
spects tomorrow's foe.
"Washington has the
biggest center in the Pac-10 in
Petur Gudmundsson, which
presents one challenge," the
fifth-year coach said. "They
like to run, also."
Coach Marv Harshman's
Huskies, who have lost four of
their last five meetings with
Stanford, boast no single out
standing player, Gud
mundsson included. Yet the
balanced scoring statistics of
the Husky starters imply that
theirs is a lineup where no
body is to be taken lightly.
Forwards Andra Griffin and
Stan Walker, averaging 11.3
and 9.8 points per game re
spectively, top all Washington
scorers. Bob Fronk (9.5 scor
ing average) and the
elegantly-named Lorenzo
Komar (9.4 points a game, plus
4.6 assists) patrol the
backcourt.
Gudmundsson, a 7-foot-2,
245-pound Reykjavik, Iceland
native, averages 8.5 points and
7.8 rebounds a game. His big
moment came last season
when he surprised California
with 37 points.
The Cards' other opponent,
Washington State, could finish
the season as one of the Pac
10's top tour or five teams.
The Cougars are gifted with
a genuine star in forward Don
Collins, a talented backcourt
tandem in seniors Bryan Rison
and Terry Kelly, and a flam
boyant but effective coach in

George Raveling.
"Washington State controls
the tempo by changing the of
fenses and defenses, so we
have to play intelligently,'' Di-
Biaso warned.
Collins, who ranked among
the league's top 10 in four
categories last year, currently
averages 21.4 points and 5.6
rebounds a game. He is joined
at forward by John Preston, a
6-8 mauler who has a great fu
ture as a bouncer.
Rison (13.8 points per game)
provides the Cougars with
quickness, while Kelly (13.2)
gives them solid outside
shooting.
Washington State's center,
6-11 senior Stuart House, did
to Gudmundsson last Saturday
what Gudmundsson did to Cal
last year. House exploded for
a career-high 38 points in a
72-68 Cougar victory. Such
performances are not typical
of House, who averages 10.7
points and 9.4 rebounds a
game.
Stanford, meanwhile, has
received consistently stellar
efforts from forward Kimber
ley Belton. The 6-7 senior, who
now ranks fifth on the all-time
Stanford scoring charts with
1334 points, averages 17.2
points and a league-leading
10.5 rebounds a game.
"Kim is playing like an Ail-
American," Dißiaso said.
"He's dominating the inside
with both his scoring and re
bounding, and he's also pro
viding outstanding leadership
to our young club."
Sophomore forward Br*«Nfr
Welch has been another C m
standout recently. The B(
Idaho native ranks lOth in the
conference in scoring with It
14.9 average after collecting 26
points against Arizona on ,13-
for-20 shooting. -r '
"If ever there was a time to
go on the road and try to turn
one around, this is the time to
do it," Dißiaso said,
larly after such a great wirns»*

Freshman guard Terry Smith (21) has been a bright spot in an
otherwise dismal season for fhe Stanford Cards. The Southern
California native's quickness and defense has helped him to play the
tough defense for which he is known. And as he is shown here
readying for a shot, he can play offense, too.
