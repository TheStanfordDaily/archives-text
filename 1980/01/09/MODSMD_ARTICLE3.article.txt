The National Indian Education As
sociation <N11A) lias unanimously
passed a resolution "taking a firm
stand against ettorts to reinstate the
Indian mascot symbol" here, follow
ing a request by representatives ot
the Stantord American Indian Or
ganization (SAIO).
The resolution, approved by both
the Nil A s student caucus and the
General Assembly at their annual
December conierence in Denver,
echoes the claims ot the orignal 55
Native American students who
petitioned President Richard Lyman
in 1972 tor the abolishment ot the
Indian mascot.
"It is dehumanizing and inap
propriate to use a racial group as a
mascot because the main tunction
ot mascots at athletic events is to

serve as an object ol sport and en
tertainment," the resolution states.
Citing that Stantord is "interna
tionally influential, preeminent, and
designed by its tounders lor the bet
terment ol mankind," it called for
alumni associations and other inf
luential organizations" to resist
groups trying to reinstate the Indian
as mascot.
SAIO members Wayne lohnson,
Hartm<jn Lomawaima and Karen At
kinson presented tin- text to the re
solution committee in response to
recent efforts by several alumni
groups to have the Indian mascot
as personified by Timm Williams
(Chief Lightfoot) â€” reinstated as the
symbol of the University.
According to lohnson, academic
advisor and counselor for Native
American students on campus, the
resolution enjoyed the "full sup
port" of the approximately 300 per
sons present at the conference, with
no one speaking in support of the
Indian as a mascot.
The resolution received special
support, according to Johnson, from
representatives from Dartmouth and
the University of Oklahoma. Both
schools have had similar mascot
controversies related to the use of
Native Americans as mascot sym
bols.
In schools with small Indian popu
lations such as Stanford, trying to

abolish the Indian as a mascot
"makes you feel like you're fighting
the whole world," said Johnson.
However, the resolution applies
only to Stantord in the use of the
Indian mascot because, according to
Johnson, "We are not in a position
to advocate anything.for anyone
else. For instance, if Navaho Com
munity College wanted to use an In
dian as a symbol, they would be ac
curately representing Indians," he
said.
The resolution "applauds anc
supports" the administration for its
past efforts to abolish the use of the
Indian as a mascot.
