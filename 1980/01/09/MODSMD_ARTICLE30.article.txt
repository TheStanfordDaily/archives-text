## Who's number one? Don't ask 
### 
Ivan Maisel

This column will not be very relevant to Stanford toot
ball fans. It will deal with the question of having college
football playoffs, and to be in those playoffs, you have to
win. Now you know why it is not relevant to Stantord fans,
but I ask you to bear with me.
Organized sports at many levels have playoffs. The NFL
has playoffs. The NBA has playoffs. NCAA basketball has
playoffs. So does NCAA fencing. The Stantord IM office
has playoffs. Pop Warner football has playoffs. NCAA Divi
sion I (the big schools) football, however, does not have
playoffs.
The recent spate ot bowls and playoffs that we red
blooded, apple-pied Americans gorged ourselves on over
the holiday season have once again regurgitated the de
bate on who's number one to the forefront of corner
tavern and barber shop jab sessions.
Playoffs have been argued about tor years and years
with no resolution in sight. It anything, the force of the
argument for determining the champion on the field has
risen in the past two years.
It might be more than coincidence that the same two
football teams have been embroiled in the controversy the
past two years: Southern California and Alabama.
You know them: USC, University ot Saudi California, of
Social Climbers, where beautiful blondes with Pepsodent
smiles and vacant heads cheer for the football team, a
team thai is the best money can buy, with a fleet of three
dozen PR people that can take a garden-variety tailback
and turn him into a Heisman trophy winner and guest star
on the johnny Carson Show and where $4000 for four
years will get you a — chuckle diploma.
And Alabama, where they want an academic institution
the football team can be proud of, where they have two
sports, football and spring football, where they relate how
Cod wears a houndstooth hat so people will think he's
Bear Bryant and where six-year-old boys write Bear to fell
him they want to play tor him in ten years (I know. I was
one ot them).
The bowl games have been history tor over a week and
still the debate rages. USC, 11-0-1 (and we all know who
tied them), staked its claim to the title via a 17-If> last
minute win over Ohio State in the Rose Bowl.
The Crimson Tide handily defeated Arkansas 24-9 in the
Sugar Bowl to linish the year 12-0-0.
There are other pretenders to the crown. Oklahoma's
only loss came early in the season against Texas, and
Houston suffered the same tate at the hands ol the Lon
ghorns.
So how do we decide who's number one? Not by play
ing, but by the poll system, whereby the writers, who see
one game a week, and the coaches, who see one game a

week, yet to rate every team in the country. And what they
say, in the AP (writers') and UPI (coaches') tallying, goes.
Some people view that as, sha'l we say, unfortunate.
The USC fans yell that Bear Bryant has the voters mes
merized by his legend and his "Aw, shucks, I'd be happy
with a one-point win" talk. The Alabama folks charge that
those Hollywood lights get in the writers' eyes and that the
aura of Trojandom obscures the real worth (or lack
thereof) of the team.
The uproar did not die after the release of the final polls
last week. Alabama won the top spot in both polls, thus
toning down those who screamed tor the writers' scalps
after Alabama dropped to number two in December de
spite a 25-18 win over I4th-ranked Auburn. Crimson Tide
cars sprouted "AP screwed us again" bumper stickers, as
well as the more political and humanitarian slogan, "Trade
the AP rating team lor the 50 hostages."
USC fans were overwrought. Hadn't they beaten the
top-ranked team in the Rose Bowl? (Yes) Hadn't they
beaten Notre Dame, Washington and LSU along the way?
(Yes) Wasn't quarterback Paul McDonald the kind of
clean-cut guy you would like to see your daughter marry?
(Maybe)
Alabama fans charged that there was only one 12-0-0
team in the country and they hung their hats in Tus
caloosa.
USC fans came right back. We'd be 12-0-0 too il we
played I lorida (0-10-11, Wichita State (I-10) and Vanderbilt
(2-9) as Alabama did.
(This one hurts) Alabama: Ihe bottom line is we won
every game and Stanford tied USC. Hell, Oregon State
beat Stanford and so did Army.
Ihe arguments will remain with us for along time be
cause a playoff just does not seem feasible. The season
already stretches over four months. A playoff would send
the season into the next semester/quarter of school and
after all, players are students first.
Keith Jackson, ABC-TV's number one play-by-play
commentator for NCAA football, predicted in a November
Daily interview that the playoffs would come about when
the schools needed the money. And any halt-hearted fol
lower ol football knows the bonanza that would result
from a national collegiate playoff.
I suspect that secretly, NCAA officials want no part of a
playoff. Look at pro football. The Super Bowl is forgotten
two weeks alter it is played. But get a Trojan tan and a T ide
booster together, and be it in Los Angeles in lanuarvor
Mazatlan in |une, you better believe they will argue as to
who is number one.
And those NCAA lolks will tell you, there ain't nothing
like tree publicity.

cause a playoff just does not seem feasible. The season
already stretches over four months. A playoff would send
the season into the next semester/quarter of school and
after all, players are students first.
Keith Jackson, ABC-TV's number one play-by-play
commentator for NCAA football, predicted in a November
Daily interview that the playoffs would come about when
the schools needed the money. And any halt-hearted fol
lower ol football knows the bonanza that would result
from a national collegiate playoff.
I suspect that secretly, NCAA officials want no part of a
playoff. Look at pro football. The Super Bowl is forgotten
two weeks alter it is played. But get a Trojan tan and a T ide
booster together, and be it in Los Angeles in lanuarvor
Mazatlan in |une, you better believe they will argue as to
who is number one.
And those NCAA lolks will tell you, there ain't nothing
like tree publicity.

This column will not be very relevant to Stanford toot
ball fans. It will deal with the question of having college
football playoffs, and to be in those playoffs, you have to
win. Now you know why it is not relevant to Stantord fans,
but I ask you to bear with me.
Organized sports at many levels have playoffs. The NFL
has playoffs. The NBA has playoffs. NCAA basketball has
playoffs. So does NCAA fencing. The Stantord IM office
has playoffs. Pop Warner football has playoffs. NCAA Divi
sion I (the big schools) football, however, does not have
playoffs.
The recent spate ot bowls and playoffs that we red
blooded, apple-pied Americans gorged ourselves on over
the holiday season have once again regurgitated the de
bate on who's number one to the forefront of corner
tavern and barber shop jab sessions.
Playoffs have been argued about tor years and years
with no resolution in sight. It anything, the force of the
argument for determining the champion on the field has
risen in the past two years.
It might be more than coincidence that the same two
football teams have been embroiled in the controversy the
past two years: Southern California and Alabama.
You know them: USC, University ot Saudi California, of
Social Climbers, where beautiful blondes with Pepsodent
smiles and vacant heads cheer for the football team, a
team thai is the best money can buy, with a fleet of three
dozen PR people that can take a garden-variety tailback
and turn him into a Heisman trophy winner and guest star
on the johnny Carson Show and where $4000 for four
years will get you a — chuckle diploma.
And Alabama, where they want an academic institution
the football team can be proud of, where they have two
sports, football and spring football, where they relate how
Cod wears a houndstooth hat so people will think he's
Bear Bryant and where six-year-old boys write Bear to fell
him they want to play tor him in ten years (I know. I was
one ot them).
The bowl games have been history tor over a week and
still the debate rages. USC, 11-0-1 (and we all know who
tied them), staked its claim to the title via a 17-If> last
minute win over Ohio State in the Rose Bowl.
The Crimson Tide handily defeated Arkansas 24-9 in the
Sugar Bowl to linish the year 12-0-0.
There are other pretenders to the crown. Oklahoma's
only loss came early in the season against Texas, and
Houston suffered the same tate at the hands ol the Lon
ghorns.
So how do we decide who's number one? Not by play
ing, but by the poll system, whereby the writers, who see
one game a week, and the coaches, who see one game a

week, yet to rate every team in the country. And what they
say, in the AP (writers') and UPI (coaches') tallying, goes.
Some people view that as, sha'l we say, unfortunate.
The USC fans yell that Bear Bryant has the voters mes
merized by his legend and his "Aw, shucks, I'd be happy
with a one-point win" talk. The Alabama folks charge that
those Hollywood lights get in the writers' eyes and that the
aura of Trojandom obscures the real worth (or lack
thereof) of the team.
The uproar did not die after the release of the final polls
last week. Alabama won the top spot in both polls, thus
toning down those who screamed tor the writers' scalps
after Alabama dropped to number two in December de
spite a 25-18 win over I4th-ranked Auburn. Crimson Tide
cars sprouted "AP screwed us again" bumper stickers, as
well as the more political and humanitarian slogan, "Trade
the AP rating team lor the 50 hostages."
USC fans were overwrought. Hadn't they beaten the
top-ranked team in the Rose Bowl? (Yes) Hadn't they
beaten Notre Dame, Washington and LSU along the way?
(Yes) Wasn't quarterback Paul McDonald the kind of
clean-cut guy you would like to see your daughter marry?
(Maybe)
Alabama fans charged that there was only one 12-0-0
team in the country and they hung their hats in Tus
caloosa.
USC fans came right back. We'd be 12-0-0 too il we
played I lorida (0-10-11, Wichita State (I-10) and Vanderbilt
(2-9) as Alabama did.
(This one hurts) Alabama: Ihe bottom line is we won
every game and Stanford tied USC. Hell, Oregon State
beat Stanford and so did Army.
Ihe arguments will remain with us for along time be
cause a playoff just does not seem feasible. The season
already stretches over four months. A playoff would send
the season into the next semester/quarter of school and
after all, players are students first.
