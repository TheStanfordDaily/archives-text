# Cardinals host rival Bears after tough Eastern journey
## 
### Richard Martinez 
Coming off a discouraging
eight-game road trip to Los
Angeles and the East Coast,
Stanford's women's basketball
team battles their arch-rivals,
the University of California
squad, this evening at Maples
Pavilion at 8 p.m. This is the
most important game of the
women's season for many
reasons.
A young Cardinal team
travelled to the East Coast and
learned, by experience, just
how far women's collegiate
basketball has progressed.
The Cards lost six games in a
row, five of those by a point
margin of ten points or larger.
Tonight Stanford faces its first
tough opponent since that
trip. What remains to be seen
is whether the women have
learned and benetited from
that experience or if this will
be a West Coast encore per
formance.
Last year Stanford entered
league play an impressive 8-0
and were trounced by a
talented USE team. The reason
for this was that the Cards
played unchallenging oppo
nents and were unprepared
for any competent teams. The
same is not true this season.
Will stiff preseason competi
tion pay off when league play
commences this evening? Ihe
Cardinals may |ust be a better
squad with a humble 6-8 re
cord than with a deceiving 8-0
mark.
Starting tonight for Stanford
will be forward jeanne Ruark,
who is averaging 19.5 points
per game, forward Ann Miller
scoring at 3.5 clip, freshman
forward Meg Metzger averag
ing 6. 5 ppg, guards Angie Pac
cione (11.6 ppg) and treshman
Denise McCuire, who dis
played good scoring potential
with a recent 11-point effort.
Cal is 8-6, coming in with a
three-game win streak after
winning the Chico tourna
ment. Junior forwards Colleen
Calloway (17.5 ppg) and jill
Weddick (16.7 ppg and 8 re
bounds) combine with
freshman center 6-foot-2 Chris
Sellin (10.6 ppg and 7 re
bounds) to provide the Col
den Bears with plenty of stor
ing and rebounding power.
Stanford leads the series 6-3,
including last year's home
thriller that resulted in a Stan
ford overtime victory, 70-62.
