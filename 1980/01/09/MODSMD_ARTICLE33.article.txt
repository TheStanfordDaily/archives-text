## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
In anticipation ot the crux of
their season, which begins
with a three-day power play
this weekend, the Card
swimmers ticked off the laps
last week and swam without a
great deal of verve at Berkeley
last Friday and Saturday.
Atter a exhausting week of
training, in which the intensity
was greater than any other
time, thanks to the lack ot
classes, the men and women
suffered through the cold and
rain-drenched California Invi
tational.
The women won almost ev
erything, according to coach
Claudia Thomas in the low
pressure, collegiate competi
tion. "Everyone swam all
right," she said, hut the real

.drive was abated by dismal
weather conditions and the
prospect ot more challenging
events upcoming.
The men also performed
lackadaisically, "like there was
no purpose in going to the
meet," said coach Skip Ken
ney. "Racing is 90 percent
mental, and there was nothing
to get up for," he explained.
"We were in the middle ot
hard training, and we found
out where we are physically at
the moment."
Thomas, meanwhile, es
corted live Stanford women
standouts to an international
meet in Austin, Texas, over the
past weekend. Thomas clas
sified the long-course (held in
a 50-meter, Olympic-size tacil
ity) contest as a pre-Olvmpic

endeavor, representing the
tinal time lor world talent to
gather before the 19H0 Sum
mer Olympics in Moscow.
The Cards, however were
tar Irom intimidating hy the
star-studded environment ot
which they were a part.
Rather, Linda Jezek won both
the 1(M) meter and 2()0 meter
backstroke races convincingly
and locked up tourth place in
the 200 individual medley.
Freshman Janet Buchan
swam tremendously, Thomas
relayed, by recording her best
time ever to place third in the
200 and 400 IM events. As only
the top three positions in each
event received recognition,
Buchan was the only indi*
vidual who was not a member
of a national team to score? two

places.
Frosh sprinter Barbara Major
rounded out the Cards' ac
complishments handily with a
tenth-place 58.0 in the 100
treestyle. Her time in her best
finish in a major national or
international meet qualified
tor the Olympic Trials.
Nonetheless, Kenney
claimed, "we're looking tor
ward to the meets this
weekend," which entail Friday
afternoon's men's dual meet
with Canada's Simon Fraser
University, Saturday's Stan
ford Relays for men and wo
men, and Sunday's clincher
tor both teams against strong
opposition from Arizona State
University. All action takes
place at deGuerre Pools.
