It's taken 37 years, but De-
Paul coach Ray Meyer is finally
just one step away from the
top, and closing.
"The highest we've ever
been was third place last
year," Meyer said after learn
ing the Blue Demons had
moved into the No. 2 spot be
hind Duke in the Associated
Press college basketball poll
yesterday.
"At long last, this team will
not only have something to
shoot at, but will gain the con
fidence and respect it needs to
stay there."

tirst-place votes cast by a
nationwide panel ot sports
writers and broadcasters and

But Meyer doesn't expect
Duke to remain undefeated.
"Mark my words, Duke is

more — yes and De Paul will
lose because nobody is really
that great," said Meyer, who

has more than 600 career vic

— and fell from 11th to No. 19.
