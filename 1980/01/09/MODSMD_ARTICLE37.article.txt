Ayatollah to protect diplomat
Tehran, Iran — Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh indicated yesterday that the Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini has rejected a demand
from the militant students occupying the U.S.
Embassy that U.S. Charge d'Aftaires L. Bruce
Laingen be turned over to them.
Laigen, who was outside the embassy when it
was seized Nov. 4, has been sheltered along with
twoother U.S. diplomats by the Foreign Ministry.
Problems in the provinces have distracted
Khomeini from the hostage issue in the past sev
eral days. More than 50 Iranians have been killed
and more than 200 injured in intense antigovern
ment fighting throughout the nation, presenting
Khomeini with his most serious challenge to cent
ral government control since he rode the Islamic
revolution to power last February.
Khomeini, who plans to spend 15 days in seclu
sion to recover from "excessive fatigue," met
with his special negotiating team tor Kurdistan
yesterday and resolved to give the rebellious
Kurds an ultimatum, according to the official
news agency Pars.
Yesterday insurgents in the Kurdish region of
west Iran ambushed 120 government military of
ficers in the city of Mahabad, critically wounding
one ol the officers. Four more government offic
ers were killed and lour wounded when a truck
ran into a group ot soldiers who had been stop
ped by insurgents, according to Pars.
In Washington, an informed official said the
State Department is beginning to believe no one,
not even Khomeini, controls the militants who
hold the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and some 50
American hostages.
Oil refinery workers go on strike
Denver — Oil refinery workers walked oft their
jobs yesterday in the first nationwide strike in 11
years by 60,000 members of the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Union.
The dispute is primarily about a union proposal
that management pay the full cost ol health care
lor the refinery workers, a system that the union
<says already prevails in most other unionized in
dustries.
To do that, the union estimates that manage
ment would have to add about $35 a month per
employee to its costs, or $25 a month more than
the companies have offered so tar. The workers
now pay an estimated $35 a month as their con
tribution to their health insurance programs.
It will be weeks, and perhaps months, betore
;i,he American consumer will notice the impact of
the strike, it it lasts that long, but both workers
'and management are braced for a prolonged bat
tle.
UN Afghanistan action delayed
United Nations — The United States continued
to press yesterday tor U.N. resolutions on Iran
and Afghanistan but action on both issues was
delayed by procedural problems and reservations
on the part ol other Western and Third World
backers.
An expected Security Council vote to present
the Afghan issue to the General Assembly was
postponed. Monday, the Soviet Union vetoed a
resolution in the counc il calling lor withdrawal ot

its troops from Afghanistan.
Third World sponsors of the proposal to shift to
the veto-free General Assembly spent the day pri
vately debating which of them would be singled
out for what they saw as the undesirable task of
publicly calling tor a special assembly session.
No movement was reported on a U.S. dratt
resolution calling for economic sanctions against
Iran. Although the )an. 7 deadline set last week
for the release of American hostages in Tehran
has passed, U.S. diplomats now say the sanctions
resolution, will not be presented to the Security
Council until at least tomorrow. Its eventual pas
sage is in question.
U.S. Air Force training in Egypt
Aswan, Egypt — The Egyptian and United States
air forces have conducted "joint training exer
cises" in Egypt recently to test the capability of
U.S. warplanes to use bases here, Egypt's defense
minister disclosed yesterday.
The purpose of the exercises, he said, was "to
make it easier for the air forces of the United
States to cross our skies and to land at our bases
where they can get facilities."
The disclosure of the air exercises comes as the
United States has been intensifying its redeploy
ment of military strength in the Middle East and
South Asia in the wake of the political convul
sions in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan. Included is a push by the United States to
develop a "network" of bases for a Rapid De
ployment force.

2'/.i-year-old girl was recommended by an Orange
County Superior Court jury last night, after less
than tour hours deliberation.

baby project has given the go-ahead by Virginia's
health commissioner yesterday, and doctors at
the Eastern Virginia Medical School said they

have applied fo the program, announced in
November 1978, a lew months alter the first tesl
tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in England.

dure raises serious moral and ethical questions

Feds reopen grain trading today
Washington — The federal government cleared
the way yesterday for grain trading to resume,
saying investors have had enough time lo assess
the impact ot President |immy Carter's limit on

grain shipments to the Soviet Union.
Trading in the commodities affected by the par
tial grain embargo — primarily corn and wheat —
was scheduled to resume today at four exchanges
in Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City after a
two-day suspension.
Grain trade analysts predicted lower prices
when the exchanges open, and some said Car
ter's order, halting the sale of 17 million metric
tons of grain to the Soviets this year, will unsettle
the market for weeks to come.

San Francisco — Dianne Feinstein was sworn in
yesterday as San Francisco s tirst woman mayor,

lenges."

1 978 assassination ol George Moscone, was
elected in December on her third try for the of
fice alter a bruising race against Supevrvisor

Brown, Kennedy attack Carter
Edmund Brown |r. and Edward Kennedy, still
bristling over President jimmy Carter's refusal to
debate them, escalated their attacks on his
toreign policy yesterday, less than two weeks be
fore the lowa precinct caucuses.
Brown accused Carter of retreating behind a
"wall ot silence" and demanded an immediate
congressional investigation of how the United
States became involved in the Iranian crisis, pre
cipitated by the seizure ot the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran Nov. 4.
Complaining that a two-hour State Department
briefing on the Iranian situation failed to answer
his questions, Brown told reporters in
Washington that a congressional inquiry would
"disclose the circumstances of how we got into
this situation and the responsibility of Jimmy Car
ter.''
Stumping lor votes in lowa, Kennedy said Car
ter has reneged on a 1976 campaign pledge that
he would never support an embargo of U.S. grain
shipments overseas.
