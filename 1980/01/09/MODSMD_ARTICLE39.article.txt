Yesterday's article on the arrest of
Andrea Chan said that Police Cap
tain Raoul Niemeyer ordered Chan
to disperse and arrested her when
she refused. Actually, Niemeyer
asked Chan if she understood his
request, and according to
Niemeyer, she said she did. How
ever, Chan said that she told
Niemeyer she did not understand
his request.
