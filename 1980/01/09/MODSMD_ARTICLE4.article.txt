Washington — The United States
told the Soviet Union yesterday to
remove its consular employees from
New York as the Carter administra
tion tried to increase pressure on
the Kremlin in response to the Rus
sian intervention in Afghanistan.
The State Department disclosed
that Deputy Secretary ot State War
ren Christopher told the Soviet
charge d'affaires that the Soviets
would not be allowed to open a
planned consulate in New York and
that the 17 officials expected to stall
the consulate should be expediti
ously sent home.
At the same time, Christopher
told the envoy, Vladillen Vasev, that
the United States would not open a
consulate under construction in
Kiev, capital ol Soviet Ukraine, and
that the seven U.S. officials assigned
there would be withdrawn.
The action, taken late Monday,
represented continuing efforts to

implement President jimmy Carter's
response to the massive Soviet
military intervention in Afghanistan.
Faced with the task of backing up
its denunciation of the Soviet role in
the strategically located Central
Asian nation, the administration
took a series of related steps yester
day, including:
—Civil Aeronautics Board reduc
tion of the three weekly New
York-Moscow (lights by Aeroflot,
the Russian airline, to two a week.
—The dispatch of three Coast
Guard cutters to Alaskan waters to
enforce Carter's decision to limit the
Soviet fish catch in U.S. territorial
waters to 75,000 metric tons in 1980,
18 percent ot the anticipated Soviet
catch within the 200-mile U.S. ter
ritorial limit.
In addition, Carter invited mem
bers ot Congress "interested in
foreign affairs and grain" to the
While House lor a buffet dinner last
night.
In the most dramatic aspect of his
response to the Kremlin, Carter de
cided Friday to embargo the ship
ment ot 17 million tons of grain to
the Soviet Union and halt sales to
Russia ot high technology equip
ment by U.S. corporations.
In Kabul, the new Soviet-backed
Afghan government, which took
power with vows to end official
brutality, is secretly continuing the
execution ot political prisoners, Af
ghan sources and Western dip
lomats said yesterday.
After Babrak Karmal was put in
power here by a Soviet-led coup
Dec. 27, he declared that the ousted
regime of tellow Marxist Hafizullah
Amin had subjected the Atghan
people to "intolerable violence and
tortures'' and that such repression
would be ended.
The new government claimed that
2075 political prisoners were re

leased from Kabul's notorious Pul
l-Charkhi prison last Sunday under
an amnesty, hut Kabul residents re
ported seeing only about WO treed.
Moreover, said one ranking
Western diplomat here, "we have
information that executions con
tinue." He and other sources here,
none of whom wanted their names
used, said they were certain that of
ficials of the Amin regime were
being executed secretly and buried
in mass graves on unpopulated hill
sides near the prison.
The sources gave no ligures or
names tor the reported victims.
Anti-communist Atghan rebels,
meanwhile, claimed to have cap
tured a border post just south of the
Soviet border alter nine days ot
bloody fighting with Russian and Af
ghan government troops.
Horse-mounted guerrillas staged
hit-run forays against white-clad
Soviet troops in the snowswept
northern hill provinces, eyewitnes
ses reported. Rebel sources in
neighboring Pakistan claimed the
guerrillas were successfully holding
out against the Soviets and Atghan
soldiers in other corners of At
ghamstan.
But the mechanized, air
supported Red Army force — esti
mated at as many as 100,000 men —
was reported in control ot most
major cities and towns.
In Moscow, the Soviet media in
tensified their charges that the Un
ited States, allied with China, Pakis
tan and Egypt, was behind the
"military aggression" of Afghan re
bels fighting the new government
here. The newspaper Pravda said the
American CIA sponsored formation
of a "broad alliance ot forces hostile
to the Afghan revolution" in 1978-79.
