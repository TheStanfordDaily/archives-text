# Brown's budget to end surplus
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” Gov. lerry Brown unveiled a $24
billion state budget bill yesterday including a $1.5 bill
ion deficit which would wipe out the last of California's
once-huge cash surplus.
In his written message to the legislature, which for
mally receives the budget tomorrow, the Democratic
governor described his spending proposal as "a budget
for difficult times" which "marks the end of the era of
large state surpluses."
The spending plan tor the fiscal year beginning July I
is based on pessimistic assumptions of a mild recession
in California, continued uncontrolled inflation and ris
ing unemployment.
The bill would be Brown's third consecutive deficit
budget since the state started sending massive amounts
of new aid to local governments to replace local prop
erty tax revenues which were slashed by voter enact
ment of Proposition 13.
Ol the total spending plan, $17.8 billion, or 74 per
cent of the total, goes directly or indirectly to local

governments. That figure includes $5.4 billion in direct
post-Proposition 13 aid, $6 billion for health and wel
fare programs administered by local governments and
$4.9 billion in local school aid.
The only major new programs proposed in his 1981-
82 fiscal year budget are $146 million extra to subsidize
local trains and bus systems and $i5 million for a new
energy conservation program.
Brown proposed no cuts in existing state services,
but his chief of staff, Gray Davis, said an alternative
budget, with proposed cuts of up to $5 billion, will be
submitted to the Legislature by March, when detailed
budget hearings begin.
That alternative budget will contain recommenda
tions to cut state spending in case voters in |une enact
the "larvis II" initiative, a proposal by Proposition 13
co-author Howard Jarvis to cut in half the state income
tax, currently the state's second biggest taxget, and he
refused to speculate on what it might contain.
