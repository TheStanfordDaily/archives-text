### Randy David 
News commentator Howard K.
Smith called it "the worst, most
dangerous ruling the court has
made in memory."
Sigma Delta Chi, the Society ot
Professional Journalists, said,
"The Supreme Court crippled the
American press."
And Boh Healey, executive
editor of the Boston Globe, said,
"This is the first step toward a
police state."

News analysis

Such were the comments by
the press following the Supreme
Court's decision on May Jl, 1977
in /urcher v. Stanford Daily. The
Court, overturning lower court
dec isioris, upheld the issuing ot a
warrant tor the search of a news
paper by law enforcement offi
cials.
The case stemmed from a
search of the Stanford Daily of
fices by Palo Alto polite officers
in April 1971. It was the tirst
search of a newspaper office in
American history. Journalists ac
ross the country felt the search
was ,i violation of freedom ot the
press, particularly because no
one at the Daily was suspected of
criminal activity.
A year and a halt after the deci
sion, the question remains
whether the decision really c rip
pled the American press and
whether the impact of the deci
sion has been as significant as

many journalists had perceived it
to be.
A month after the c ase was de
cided, lack Landau, director of
the Reporters Committee lor
Freedom ot the Press, predicted
an increase in surprise search
warrant raids against the press.
Ten news organizations were
searched by the police (all in
three states, including Califor
nia), between the time the Doily
was searched and the Supreme
Court decision came down. But
since the decision, no news
rooms have been searched.
Landau attributes this lack of
searches today to the tact that
prosecutors ran away from the
decision. "Reaction to the deci
sion was so outraged that district
attorneys and the lustice De
partment got very worried," he
said.
Richard Schmidt, general
counsel for the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, said, "Law
enforcement officers are deliber
ately holding back because they
are tearful of legislative action
moving to prohibit searches."
Although there have been no
newsroom searches since the de
cision, newspapers and television
stations are fearful of the possibil
ity ot searches.
Schmidt said that no news
paper editor feels sate. "News
papers assume that anytime there
can be a raid," he said.
This worry has spurred many
newspapers and journalists to

take precautionary measures in
anticipation of a search.
Some newspapers have de
veloped a specitic procedure to
tollow ii a police officer knocks
on the door with a search warrant
in his hand. In Pennsylvania, 4tt
news organizations formed the
Pennsylvania First Amendment
Coalition, which otters a 150-
page "Media Survival Kit" and a
law tirm on call for any type ot
First Amendment problems, in
cluding unannounced searches.
When the decision was handed
down, many journalists feared a
result would he that confidential
sources would dry up because
they feared their names would be
revealed.
However, New York Times col
umnist Anthony Fewis argues thai
they haven't. Sources like Deep
Throat call newspapers for per
sonal reasons, he said. They do
not check the latest Supreme
Court decisions to see if their
identity has any chance ot being
revealed it they talk to a reporter.
The Stanford Daily case has had
a major impact on how reporters
keep their notes. Most reporters
will not leave their notes laying
around the office or their home,
especially if the information
comes from confidential sources.
Fading notes is a standard
operating procedure at many
publications, including the Gan
nett newspapers and the Wall
Street lournal.
At the Minneapolis Tribune,

the editor no longer knows
where his reporters keep their
notes; he does know that they
are not kept in the Tribune office.
"I think that's a lousy way to run a
newspaper — or a country — but
that's the way we have to do it
these days," he said.
One Idaho newspaper editor
advises his reporters to hum their
notes alter writing a story. But
destroying notes is not the best
solution.
"If I tell (reporters) to hide or
destroy materials, they might be
guilty ot compounding a telony
or obstructing justice," Schmidt
said. In general, it there is any
possibility that a story is libelous,
Schmidt advises reporters to
keep their notes. It the story is
not libelous, he advises them to
destroy their notes.
With computerized editing
terminals in many newspapers,
editors can set up codes giving
only certain people access to a
particular story or notes. With
only a search warrant, a reporter
cannot be forced to give a police
officer a computer printout of his
story or his notes.
Both Congress and state legis
latures have attempted to protect
the press through legislation.
Two days after the decision came
down, a bill was introduced in
the House of Representatives that
would make it a crime to search
newspaper offices without a prior
court hearing or without a war
rant that specified a probable

cause to believe someone in the
office had committed a crime.
Within one month, 11 bills had
been introduced in both houses
of Congress. However, none of
them emerged from the sub
committees. During this session,
there have been at least 17 bills
introduced, including a proposal
by the Carter Administration.
The Carter bill, entitled the
First Amendment Privacy and Pro
tection Act ol 1979, would pro
hibit searches by federal, state

and local officials of material
produced for dissemination to
the public. This includes repor
ters' notes, drafts of articles, film
footage and tape recordings.
Under this bill, searches would
be allowed only if a person pos
sessing the material was involved
in a related crime or if the search
was necessary to prevent death
or serious bodily injury.
Subcommittees in both houses
of Congress are considering the


A Palo Alio police officer searches through Daily tiles in 1971. It was the
first search of a newspaper in American history.
