## Afghan army lacks discipline, morale 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
New Delhi â€” Well before
Soviet combat troops
swarmed into Afghanistan, a
group of Western newsmen
coming out of the presidential
palace in Kabul last autumn
were treated to a quick
glimpse ol the 80,000-man Af
ghan army's elite presidential
guard in action.
With ill-lifting, unkempt un
iforms, the platoon-si/ed unit,
out of step, made a vain at
tempt at the Russian-style
goosestep. One soldier, dis
tracted by the group of news
men, failed to hear the order
to hall and tumbled into the
ranks ahead of him like a bowl
ing ball.
The performance reflected
the undisciplined, poorly
trained nature ol what must be
one of the world's most be
leaguered armies. Its officer
ranks have been thinned by
countless purges in the wake
of three violent coups in the
last 20 months; and its rank
and-file conscript soldiers arc
poorly paid and ill-trained.
Some military experts in South
Asia are at a loss to explain
why the army die) not collapse
under the growing pressure ol
its thankless task: fighting its
own citi/ens to prop up suc
cessive unpopular Soviet
backed regimes in Kabul.
Military experts here believe
it was only the massive influx
ol Soviet equipment and ad
visers that kept the Afghan
army afloat. Even before the
airlift of Russian combat
troops, Soviet advisers were
with the Atghan army clown to
company level in some infan
try divisions.
Support from the Atghan air
force, equipped with Soviet
MIC.-21 lighter planes and
MI-24 helicopter gunships, has
also propped up the army.
While desertions were high
and morale low, the rag-tag
force generally stuck grimly to
its task.
Since Soviet combat troops
began pouring into Afghanis
tan on Christmas Eve, many
Afghan army units have turned
their guns on a new enemy
the invaders.
Although reports reaching
here and neighboring Pakistan
about the lighting in Afghanis
fan are sketchy, they have in
die ated that some division
sized army units, in Kabul and
in provincial cities, have re
fused to surrender, choosing
instead to light the Russians.
The 18th Division, based at
Kargah on the western out
skirts of Kabul, was reported
to be holding out against a
Soviet siege. Western dip
lomatic sources here said
small-arms lire was heard in
the city Friday, but the loca
tion was unclear.
In the provincial capital of
(alalabad, 100 miles east of
Kabul, the 11th Division was
lighting Soviet troops, accord
ing to reports reaching the
Pakistan frontier city oi
Peshawar. Resistance has also
been reported in eastern areas
of the country, with army units
joining Moslem guerrilla
groups to oppose advancing
Soviet troops.

Military experts listed three
main reasons why these units
were attempting to resist vas
tly superior Russian torces.
"Even though poorly
trained, Afghans have histori
cally been amazing fighters,"
explained P.B. Sinha, who
monitors Afghan military activ
ity tor the Institute tor Defense
Studies and Analyses here.
"Once they take up arms, they
will light to the finish."
Afghans historically have
buried their own differences
to lace a common enemy.
They defeated the British
soundly in the last century,
and there is a deep distrust
and dislike of Russians among
Afghans that dates back to
c/arist times.
Also, many Atghan army
commanders hold their posts
for no other reason than Iheir
loyalty to former President
Hafizullah Amin, who was
ousted and then executed dur
ing the Soviet-backed coup
thai brought Babrak Karmal to
power lasfc month.
Amin had the task ot secur
ing the army's loyalty before
the coup that first brought Nur
Mohammed fakari to power in
April, 1978. Amin did his job
effectively, and after the
takeover, Amin, working as
Taraki's deputy, consolidated
his own support within Ihe
armed forces, especially the
army.
When Amin overthrew
Taraki last September, Ihe loy
alty he had built paid off. Ihe
army remained in the barracks
and, except for a bloody
shootout at the presidential
palace in Kabul, the coup pas
sed peacefully.
Observers here said that it
was this previous loyalty to
Amin that was, in part, causing
troop units to resist the
Soviets. "It isn't so much thai

they loved Amin, it is that it
the officers of these units sur
render, they know they will
probably be killed in a purge,''
Sinha said.
Traditionally the main in
strument of political power,
the once-proud army has lost
much ot its efficiency in a
series ot brutal purges that
have accompanied each
change of power since
Mohammed Daoud overthrew
the Atghan monarchy in )uly
1973.
It was Daoud who tirst
began replacing professional
royalist officers with more
politically-minded, lett
leaning men of his own. The
replacement became a
wholesale purge alter Taraki's
rise to power. Amin moved
iirst to rid the army almost
completely of its career offic
ers, then to remove those
within his own Marxist party
faction who were suspected of
disloyalty.
One diplomat in Kabul esti
mated that less than 1000 ot
the 8000 officers held their
commissions 20 months ago
when Taraki came to power.
"Since April 1978, the officer
ranks have been purged at
least lour to live times," one
military expert in Kabul said
recently.
Those picked in the past
year to command important
units around Kabul and in pro
vincial capitals were chosen
more lor party or personal
loyalty than professional skills.
Because Amin's party tac
tion is comprised mainly of
educated leftist students or
recent graduates, the new of
ficer corps is extremely young
and inexperienced.
"Gradually, leadership in
the army has transferred to the
boys," a military expert in
Kabul said. "There are in-

stances ot brigade and even
division-sized units being
commanded by 22-year-olds
with almost no military experi
ence."
Lower ranks are virtually all
conscripts, who receive food,
a uniform and shelter, plus
about $8 a month. They are
poorly educated and receive
only a few months basic train
ing in their unit.
Units are traditionally or
ganized by region, and the
Marxist governments of both
Amin and Taraki have been
caretul not to commit a unit to
light insurgents in its own reg
ion.
Even so, the bitter fighting
against Moslem insurgents to
support governments de
spised by most of the popula
tion has taken its toll. Deser
tions have increased dramati
cally in recent months, accord
ing to military sources here,
while morale dropped.
But with a new foreign
enemy on the scene, many
army units appear to have fal
len back on their hatred for all
foreigners, and to have mus
tered new resistance.
Indeed, Atghan army resis
tance to the Soviet presence
did not begin just last week. In
March, the 17th Division in the
western city ot Herat mutinied
against the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul. Before
the rebellion was crushed, an
estimated 5000, including be
tween 50 and 200 Soviets, had
died.
Military sources here said
that it was only a matter ot
time before the Soviets
crushed Afghan army resis
tance. They said that some
units that have joined torces
with rebel insurgents probably
would melt into the rugged
mountain terrain covering
much of the nation.
