# Marchais 'returns to orthodoxy'
## French communists back Soviet action 
### 
Paris Cieorges Marchais, the French
Communist Party leader, flew to Moscow
Monday for his first visit since 1974 and
gave full backing to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. The trip brought an end to
Marchais' eight-year experiment with
Eurocommunism.
To mark the return of Marchais and the
French party to lull Soviet Brotherhood
and esteem, he was seen off on an Aerol
lot flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport
by the Soviet ambassador, Pytor Cher
vonenkov.
Through the party newspaper, I'Huma
nite, the French Communists have been
giving the Soviet Union the most unqual
ified support ot any Communist Party in
Western Europe for the Afghanistan inva
sion. The French Communists took a simi
lar stand in 1968, when Soviet tanks rolled
into Czechoslovakia to put down a liberal
Communist regime there.
Both the Italian and Spanish Com
munist parties have continued to show
more independence, in effect criticizing
the Soviet action in Afghanistan but at the
same time deploring the circumstances
•hat brought it about. The French party's
return to Moscow's favor and a complete
pro-Moscow line after having spent most
of the 1970s on a more independent
course in a political alliance with the
French Socialist Party was bitterly con
demned in an article in Le Monde by a

leading party intellectual, lean Ellenstein.
"Tens of thousands of Communists
thought that the French Communist Party
was going to be something other than
what it had been, and thousands of
French people held this hope for awhile,"
Fllenstein wrote. "At the start ot 1980, the
iron curtain of history descends on us,
wielded by a party leadership incapable ot
controlling events and lacking the cour
age to tace the facts of our times and our
country. The union ot the left has been
discarded. Establishing internal democ
racy within the French Communist Party
has been shelved. Eurocommunism is suf
fering a bitter failure."
In his attack on the party leadership,
which may now cost him his party mem
bership, Ellenstein declared: "Here and
now we want the French Communist
Party to define a policy independent from
that of the Soviet Communists. Ftere and
now we want democracy within the party
where there subsist so many active forces
of workers and intellectuals. Here and
now we want a true fundamental debate
to be raised on the crisis, on the interna
tional climate, the new policies that the
left should offer the French people. Let us
act against the freeze."
When Soviet President Leonid I.
Brezhnev last visited Paris in May 1977, he
retused to meet with Marchais, who at the
time was allied with the Socialists with

elections for the French National Assem
bly in the offing. But he then abruptly
engineered a break in the left alliance in
advance of the assembly vote, which then
turned into a landslide victory for Presi
dent Valery Giscard d'Estaing and the
Gaullists. His return to Moscow therefore
marked the full circle of return to Com
munist orthodoxy.
It also followed a strong denunciation
of Eurocommunism from the Kremlin in
late November, delivered by 74-year-old
Boris Ponomarev, secretary of the central
committee and director of its interna
tional department in charge of relations
with other Communist parties in Western
Europe.
Atter asserting that "so-called
Eurocommunism is opposed to real
socialism and rejects the historic and uni
versal role of Soviet achievements,"
Ponomarev pounded home this message:
"Eurocommunism can only bring harm to
the international Communist movement
as well as those parties which adhere to it.
The leaders of Eurocommunism are be
ginning to understand that this policy is
meeting with growing disapproval from
the rank and file as well as from the milit
ant cadres of their parties. The central
committee ot the Soviet Communist Party
will do all it can in the future to eliminate
all deviations from Marxism-Leninism and
from proletarian internationalism."

To mark the return of Marchais and the
French party to lull Soviet Brotherhood
and esteem, he was seen off on an Aerol
lot flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport
by the Soviet ambassador, Pytor Cher
vonenkov.
Through the party newspaper, I'Huma
nite, the French Communists have been
giving the Soviet Union the most unqual
ified support ot any Communist Party in
Western Europe for the Afghanistan inva
sion. The French Communists took a simi
lar stand in 1968, when Soviet tanks rolled
into Czechoslovakia to put down a liberal
Communist regime there.
Both the Italian and Spanish Com
munist parties have continued to show
more independence, in effect criticizing
the Soviet action in Afghanistan but at the
same time deploring the circumstances
•hat brought it about. The French party's
return to Moscow's favor and a complete
pro-Moscow line after having spent most
of the 1970s on a more independent
course in a political alliance with the
French Socialist Party was bitterly con
demned in an article in Le Monde by a

leading party intellectual, lean Ellenstein.
"Tens of thousands of Communists
thought that the French Communist Party
was going to be something other than
what it had been, and thousands of
French people held this hope for awhile,"
Fllenstein wrote. "At the start ot 1980, the
iron curtain of history descends on us,
wielded by a party leadership incapable ot
controlling events and lacking the cour
age to tace the facts of our times and our
country. The union ot the left has been
discarded. Establishing internal democ
racy within the French Communist Party
has been shelved. Eurocommunism is suf
fering a bitter failure."
In his attack on the party leadership,
which may now cost him his party mem
bership, Ellenstein declared: "Here and
now we want the French Communist
Party to define a policy independent from
that of the Soviet Communists. Ftere and
now we want democracy within the party
where there subsist so many active forces
of workers and intellectuals. Here and
now we want a true fundamental debate
to be raised on the crisis, on the interna
tional climate, the new policies that the
left should offer the French people. Let us
act against the freeze."
When Soviet President Leonid I.
Brezhnev last visited Paris in May 1977, he
retused to meet with Marchais, who at the
time was allied with the Socialists with

elections for the French National Assem
bly in the offing. But he then abruptly
engineered a break in the left alliance in
advance of the assembly vote, which then
turned into a landslide victory for Presi
dent Valery Giscard d'Estaing and the
Gaullists. His return to Moscow therefore
marked the full circle of return to Com
munist orthodoxy.
It also followed a strong denunciation
of Eurocommunism from the Kremlin in
late November, delivered by 74-year-old
Boris Ponomarev, secretary of the central
committee and director of its interna
tional department in charge of relations
with other Communist parties in Western
Europe.
Atter asserting that "so-called
Eurocommunism is opposed to real
socialism and rejects the historic and uni
versal role of Soviet achievements,"
Ponomarev pounded home this message:
"Eurocommunism can only bring harm to
the international Communist movement
as well as those parties which adhere to it.
The leaders of Eurocommunism are be
ginning to understand that this policy is
meeting with growing disapproval from
the rank and file as well as from the milit
ant cadres of their parties. The central
committee ot the Soviet Communist Party
will do all it can in the future to eliminate
all deviations from Marxism-Leninism and
from proletarian internationalism."
