# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Matt O'Connor National Forest a dilemma 
### 
The National Forests of the
United States were established
to improve, protect and utilize
forest resources. Although the
word "forest" conjures the
image of trees, this is not the
sole resource found in Na
tional Forests.
Historically, the National
Forests have been used
primarily as a source of lumber
and wood products. Such use
has not been without benefit:
these products are vital to
economic prosperity and
growth. Further, the availabil
ity of uncut timber and other
unexploited lands has been
such that other uses were not
excluded. In the past decade
this situation has changed.
The demand for the other
forest resources has risen
dramatically due to population
growth and the depletion of
natural resources. This has re
sulted in competition between
special interest groups for li
mited resources. Take for
example the battle for a large
mountainous area of virgin
forest.
Timber interests would push
for logging while fishermen,
wilderness enthusiasts and
environmental organizations
would favor preservation.
Such competition is inten
sified by the fact that logged
over lands often have margi
nally useful resources due to
careless logging practices and
excessive timber quotas.
These circumstances em
phasize the fact that past man
agement has been inadequate
with respect to maintaining
the productivity of the land as
well as the fact that the use of
resources must be carefully
planned to accommodate all
legitimate uses. It should be
added at this point that min
eral extraction is a use that,
under the 1872 Mining Law,
has priority over all other uses.
Thus, mining activities could
frustrate attempts to com
prehensively plan for the pro
duction of renewable re
sources and disrupt manage
ment programs. This anomaly
can be resolved only by Con
gress.
Recognition of the need for
better management and plan
ning requires that we make
management changes and
create planning mechanisms.
The key to improving man
agement programs is Con

gressional appropriations.
Funds must be allocated if the
Forest Service is to intensify
land management and refores
tation programs, and they
must be allocated reliably over
a period of years.
One way to finance these
programs is to reinvest a sig
nificant amount of the pro
ceeds from timber sales, most
of which go into the Federal
treasury.
Another way of improving
multi-use management is by
investing decision-making au
thority in Forest Service pro
fessionals other than fores
ters. Currently, wildlife
biologists, landscape ar
chitects and geologists serve
only in an advisory capacity to
the foresters who administrate
management programs.
This results in an organiza
tional bias towards timber
production. Although effec
tive management is crucial,
planning is even more impor
tant in that the manageability
of land for a given use is a re
flection of the quality of plan
ning.
Planning has two functions:
to ensure that land use is
commensurate with the land's
capability to support the use(s)
in the long term and to ba
lance different uses so that the
demand for all resources can
be met.
One way to achieve balance
is suggested in a report pub
lished by Resources Agency,
State of California, entitled
"Today, Tomorrow." Where
there is a land-use conflict, all
the concerned interest
groups, which presumably
represent all feasible, legiti
mate uses, are brought to
gether in an arbitration pro
ceeding.
Here, each group recog
nizes the legitimacy of the
other groups' wishes and then
seek a solution amicable to all.
I think this system could work
well if land capability studies
provide the framework of
reasonable land-use patterns
in which a solution may be
found.
The Forest Service should
have the final say, however,
because of its expertise and
authority. The Forest Service's
approach to resolving conflict
ing demands for resources is
similar.
The Pacific Southwest Reg

ion ot the Forest Service is in
the process ot preparing a reg
ional plan tor the National
Forest lands in California,
which cover 20 percent of the
state. The project is in its inci
pient stages, and is currently
identifying issues, which are
defined as "differences of
opinion over the use of limited
resources." Resolution of the
conflicts represented by issues
is the purpose of the planning
process.
In summary, effective man
agement can be defined as
achieving the greatest number
of uses on the same land,
yielding resources, at a rate
that can be sustained in the
long term. Effective planning
can be defined as establishing
the balance between uses that
can best satisfy the need for
resources.
