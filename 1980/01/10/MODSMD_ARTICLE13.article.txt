## Maple syrup a sticky issue 
### 
One amazing thing about
Stanford is that for every opin
ion, no matter how outrage
ous it might be, there is some
one willing to express it. And
they usually do it in the Daily.
Certainly it is good to have a
free flow of ideas, but I must
admit that I often treat the
Opinions page as a humor sec
tion. I mean, any idiot with a
pen can sit down, write a col
umn and get it published in
the Daily so that thousands of
people see it.
When I told that to one of
the Opinions Page editors, he
immediately suggested I write
a column.
Another amazing thing
about Stanford is that there is
someone to be offended by
anything. No matter how in
nocent or common an idea
may appear to its author or
how carefully he/she/it exp
lains it is intended as humor,
someone will write a letter to
take exception to it. If I took a
stand in favor of people eating
food, someone would proba
bly write in and say that it only
causes waste. Nonetheless,
this is an Opinions page article
and so I guess I should risk
discussing what I consider to
be the pressing problems we

face.
I am greatly disturbed that
so far this year I have been un
able to eat food service's pan
cakes with maple syrup with
out getting my fingers sticky.
Since I have the journalistic
responsibility to tell it to you
straight and put the blame
where blame is due, I must lay
the responsibility on the syrup
vats. The ladles tend to get
dirty early on so that one can
not help but get sticky fingers
while putting syrup on one's
pancakes.
Can we not solve this prob
lem? Do we not have a re
nowned engineering school
here? Let us lay down our
petty differences and unite in
a cause which will help all of
our brothers and sisters with
breakfast plans! Students, you

need not suffer with sticky,
gooey, maple-syrup-coated
fingers! ... Oh God, I hope
there are no maple syrup stu
dents out there. Next thing
you know the Maple Syrup
Students' Association will
write in and complain. I assure
you, I have nothing against
maple syrup. Some of my best
friends are maple syrup ... of
course I wouldn't go out with
any maple syrup, or blueberry,
or boysenberry or any syrup
for that matter.
0.K., you got me! I'm pre
judiced against syrup! I just
want to use it for a good
breakfast!
And that's my opinion.
