## Birth control abortion an 'ethical crime' 
### 
There was considerable con
troversy in the Daily's pages
on the subject of abortion last
quarter. There were appa
rently two principle contend
ing views.
The first seems to be that
the fetus is a human being in
principle at least and that as
such is due an undeniable
human right to continue liv
ing.
The second, in opposition,
appeared to hold that the fetus
is a non-human accumulation
of cells and has.no more con
ciousness (for the first three
months anyway) than, say, a
mouse. In this view the right
of women to control the dis
position of their bodies and
lives takes precedence over
such rights as an invasive fetus
might have.
The subject of abortion
taken out of its social context
as it has been cannot be resol
ved given its encrusted freight
of tension and anger. There
fore focusing on the question
which supplies the unspoken
basis for disagreement might
be more appropriate. This is
consideration of what makes
human life precious in the first

place.
From where does the value
of human life derive?
As a first guess perhaps it is
life itself which is intrinsically
sacred. In this case every tree,
lizard and worm is on an equal
par with human beings.
There are undoubtedly
philosophies which would
maintain this position, how
ever the exigencies of life
make such a position realisti
cally untenable. Even a Yogi in
the Himalayas must consume
something that was living in
order to maintain life. (Al
though to be fair this com
promise is viewed as sup
remely tragic.) Furthermore
life can have value only in a
human context. We are the
evaluators.
Maybe human life is special
because humans are distinctly
conscious of self and have pro
found rational and emotional
attributes. The destruction of
these unique qualities in the
taking of human life might
then be viewed as criminal.
However, this view suffers
when examined more deeply.
(To argue that human life is
God-given and that humans
have an invaluable soul is
merely regression.)
Most of the Stanford com
munity must by now be aware
of the studies of Dr. Francine
Patterson and her co-workers
on intelligence in nonhuman
primates. She may have taught
Koko and Michael, both of
whom are gorillas, what it
means to be human. They give
every evidence of a self
consciousness quite similar to
that of humans.
Likewise a chimpanzee of
similar talents and attributes
named Washoe seems to be
teaching sign language to an
adopted baby chimpanzee at
the Yerkes Regional Primate
Center.
Given these results (and
there are others) it is probable
that at least the higher mam
mals have some sense of self,
some sort of cognitive intelli
gence and some kind of emo
tive feeling. Therefore if
human life is to be valued for
the attributes of awareness,

cognition and emotional
depth then the lives of other
animals must be likewise val
ued.
For if animals are to be
excluded for possessing lesser
quality or magnitude of these
attributes then one is led by
extension to countenancing
the extermination of those
humans deficient in some ar
bitrary ability or virtue. This is
a conclusion which must be
shied away from.
It is clear then that some
judgmental criterion other
than tangible "human" qual
ities must exist. One would be
hard pressed not to sacrifice
the life of a chimpanzee or
cow if it would save the life of
a human. Nevertheless a dis
tinct reason is still lacking.
These thoughts lead to the
way out of the dilemma. For if
neither the fact of life itself nor
no longer monopolistically
human attributes make human
life singularly precious, what
can remain? Only this: We are
human and we speak of
human life.
Here lies the heart of the
controversy on abortion. It is
the perception that there is a
dichotomous conflict between
the value of human life that is
and human life that is becom
ing. This is a false distinction.
No one could possibly de
sire that a woman distraught
and fettered by an unwanted,
possibly hateful pregnancy
should be so intimately com
promised as to be forced to
bear to term. In the case of
rape the victim's need to re
cover herself must surely take
precedence over all else.
Abortion as a means of birth
control has a distinctly diffe
rent character however. There
is a danger here of a subtle but
real erosion of value assigned
to human life. After all, a fetus
is indeed merely an accumula
tion of cells.
On the other hand, so are
we. The fact that as developed
humans we are also sentient is
a non-argument.
A clump of cells is a clump
of cells. All one need do to be
convinced of the unsure grasp
humans have on the concept

of self-worth is to contemplate
the violent effect of war-time
propaganda.
An enemy is always, and too
easily converted into some
thing inhuman and killable. It
is the legacy of name-calling.
While the arguments used
to promulgate abortion are
most certainly analogous to
the ugliness of war
mongering, some of the prac
tices consequent to these ar
guments do darken the per
ceived value of human life.
The use of amniocentesis to
discover the sex of an unborn
child, with abortion the fate of
the unlucky, is one example.
A fetus through its growing
brain does share in the human
heritage. In its genetic and cel
lular qualities it is undeniably
human. In this respect the
value and dignity accorded to
sentient human life is as sec
ure as its extention to the un

born living.
Organizations concerned
with abortion and humanita
rian ideals should first and
foremost vigorously promote
the free access of birth control
methods and education for all
men and women. Given the
variety of methods both avail
able and in the offing there
should no longer be any-ex
cuse for pregnancy by negli
gent oversight.
Indeed, any person who re
lies on abortion for birth con
trol or to backstop careless
neglect is guilty of an ethical
crime. The practice of abor
tion should ultimately be re
duced to its proper role as the
expedient of last resort for the
termination of an unhealthy
pregnancy.

There was considerable con
troversy in the Daily's pages
on the subject of abortion last
quarter. There were appa
rently two principle contend
ing views.
The first seems to be that
the fetus is a human being in
principle at least and that as
such is due an undeniable
human right to continue liv
ing.
The second, in opposition,
appeared to hold that the fetus
is a non-human accumulation
of cells and has.no more con
ciousness (for the first three
months anyway) than, say, a
mouse. In this view the right
of women to control the dis
position of their bodies and
lives takes precedence over
such rights as an invasive fetus
might have.
The subject of abortion
taken out of its social context
as it has been cannot be resol
ved given its encrusted freight
of tension and anger. There
fore focusing on the question
which supplies the unspoken
basis for disagreement might
be more appropriate. This is
consideration of what makes
human life precious in the first

place.
From where does the value
of human life derive?
As a first guess perhaps it is
life itself which is intrinsically
sacred. In this case every tree,
lizard and worm is on an equal
par with human beings.
There are undoubtedly
philosophies which would
maintain this position, how
ever the exigencies of life
make such a position realisti
cally untenable. Even a Yogi in
the Himalayas must consume
something that was living in
order to maintain life. (Al
though to be fair this com
promise is viewed as sup
remely tragic.) Furthermore
life can have value only in a
human context. We are the
evaluators.
Maybe human life is special
because humans are distinctly
conscious of self and have pro
found rational and emotional
attributes. The destruction of
these unique qualities in the
taking of human life might
then be viewed as criminal.
However, this view suffers
when examined more deeply.
(To argue that human life is
God-given and that humans
have an invaluable soul is
merely regression.)
Most of the Stanford com
munity must by now be aware
of the studies of Dr. Francine
Patterson and her co-workers
on intelligence in nonhuman
primates. She may have taught
Koko and Michael, both of
whom are gorillas, what it
means to be human. They give
every evidence of a self
consciousness quite similar to
that of humans.
Likewise a chimpanzee of
similar talents and attributes
named Washoe seems to be
teaching sign language to an
adopted baby chimpanzee at
the Yerkes Regional Primate
Center.
Given these results (and
there are others) it is probable
that at least the higher mam
mals have some sense of self,
some sort of cognitive intelli
gence and some kind of emo
tive feeling. Therefore if
human life is to be valued for
the attributes of awareness,

cognition and emotional
depth then the lives of other
animals must be likewise val
ued.
For if animals are to be
excluded for possessing lesser
quality or magnitude of these
attributes then one is led by
extension to countenancing
the extermination of those
humans deficient in some ar
bitrary ability or virtue. This is
a conclusion which must be
shied away from.
It is clear then that some
judgmental criterion other
than tangible "human" qual
ities must exist. One would be
hard pressed not to sacrifice
the life of a chimpanzee or
cow if it would save the life of
a human. Nevertheless a dis
tinct reason is still lacking.
These thoughts lead to the
way out of the dilemma. For if
neither the fact of life itself nor
no longer monopolistically
human attributes make human
life singularly precious, what
can remain? Only this: We are
human and we speak of
human life.
Here lies the heart of the
controversy on abortion. It is
the perception that there is a
dichotomous conflict between
the value of human life that is
and human life that is becom
ing. This is a false distinction.
No one could possibly de
sire that a woman distraught
and fettered by an unwanted,
possibly hateful pregnancy
should be so intimately com
promised as to be forced to
bear to term. In the case of
rape the victim's need to re
cover herself must surely take
precedence over all else.
Abortion as a means of birth
control has a distinctly diffe
rent character however. There
is a danger here of a subtle but
real erosion of value assigned
to human life. After all, a fetus
is indeed merely an accumula
tion of cells.
On the other hand, so are
we. The fact that as developed
humans we are also sentient is
a non-argument.
A clump of cells is a clump
of cells. All one need do to be
convinced of the unsure grasp
humans have on the concept

of self-worth is to contemplate
the violent effect of war-time
propaganda.
An enemy is always, and too
easily converted into some
thing inhuman and killable. It
is the legacy of name-calling.
While the arguments used
to promulgate abortion are
most certainly analogous to
the ugliness of war
mongering, some of the prac
tices consequent to these ar
guments do darken the per
ceived value of human life.
The use of amniocentesis to
discover the sex of an unborn
child, with abortion the fate of
the unlucky, is one example.
A fetus through its growing
brain does share in the human
heritage. In its genetic and cel
lular qualities it is undeniably
human. In this respect the
value and dignity accorded to
sentient human life is as sec
ure as its extention to the un

born living.
Organizations concerned
with abortion and humanita
rian ideals should first and
foremost vigorously promote
the free access of birth control
methods and education for all
men and women. Given the
variety of methods both avail
able and in the offing there
should no longer be any-ex
cuse for pregnancy by negli
gent oversight.
Indeed, any person who re
lies on abortion for birth con
trol or to backstop careless
neglect is guilty of an ethical
crime. The practice of abor
tion should ultimately be re
duced to its proper role as the
expedient of last resort for the
termination of an unhealthy
pregnancy.
