Berlin â€” Ballet star Alexan
der Godunov says the four and
a half months since he de
fected from the Soviet Union
have proven such a strain he
has had to struggle day by day
"just trying to live."
A series of cancellations that
delayed his debut with the
strike-bound American Ballet
Theatre in New York were
"hard on the nerves," the tall,
blond dancer said in an inter
view.
Godunov spoke briefly fol
lowing the first of four per
formances scheduled in West
Berlin's Deutsche Oper, less
than 3 miles from the Berlin
Wall.
The performances, which
began Monday night, are his
first since his celebrated "leap
to the West" last August while
on a tour of the United States
with the Bolshoi Ballet.
Godunov said he remains in
contact with his wife, Ballerina
Ludmilla Vlasilova, 36, who re
fused to remain with him in
the United States. She re
turned to Moscow aboard a
Soviet airliner last Aug. 28 after
American officials held the
plane for three days at New

York's Kennedy Airport.
U.S. officials allowed the
plane to leave after she told
them personally that she was
returning voluntarily.
"I don't want to talk about
politics, about my wife," said
Godunov. "Of course, I miss
her very much, but we speak
on the phone regularly even
though I know everybody is
listening to our conversation.
But for me, it's enough to hear
her voice."
The slim, 30-year-old artist
with shoulder-length hair
drew a 15-minute ovation from
the Berlin audience following
his debut in the male lead of
"Giselle."
But after the performance,
Godunov told an interviewer
he had been so frustrated and
downcast during the past
months that "I haven't even
been in training all the time."
Didn't the rousing applause
boost his spirits?
"First, a glass of champagne
for everyone," he said, adding
after a pause: "It's difficult to
say. I must rest and think
about my performance. But it
was good to be dancing
again."
