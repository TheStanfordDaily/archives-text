The Los Angeles Times
Tehran, Iran — Opponents of the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini rioted
in the streets of the northwestern
city of Tabriz yesterday and were
driven back with gunfire from Kho
meini's Revolutionary Guards. The
shooting left at least eight dead and
more than 100 wounded.
The street battles, which rolled ac
ross Iran's second largest city from
mid-day until late evening, marked
the worst violence in a month of un
rest in the strategic Azerbaijan reg
ion.
All of the dead were believed to
be Azerbaijanis, members of Iran's
largest minority, and followers of
the Ayatollah Kazem Shariat-Madari,
Khomeini's only real rival in the
Shiite Moslem clergy. Many of the
Revolutionary Guards who fired on
them were Persians, members of the
country's largest ethnic group, and
loyal to Khomeini.
The deaths thus appeared certain
to deepen the bitter division bet
ween the Turkish-speaking Azer
baijanis, who make up an estimated
22 percent of Iran's population, and
the Farsi-speaking Persians, who
make up just under 50 percent.
It was difficult to obtain an accu
rate casualty count, for scattered
shooting continued in many areas
until almost midnight. "We don't
know how many are dead," an offi
cial at the East Axerbaijan provincial
governor's office said. "We have
been stuck in the building all day.
They're still shooting outside."
The crisis in the region has been
rooted in the long-dormant resent
ment of the Axerbaijanis, a re
sourceful people who have contri
buted more than their share of Iran's
technicians, managers and army of

f icers.
It was reflected in the tension be
tween Shariat-Madari, a scholarly,
soft-spoken man who led the con
servative wing of the clergy during
the revolution against Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, and Kho
meini, the Persian firebrand who ral
lied the masses around one simple
slogan: "Death to the shah."
The conflict was brought to a head
last month by a series of relatively
minor controversies — including
Khomeini's appointment of an un
popular governor.
Khomeini loyalists in the central
government handled the problems
clumsily, and the conflict spiraled
toward an explosion. In the one
case, the government agreed to re
move the governor, Aboul Hussein
Gharayi, but then went back on its
promise. Instead, the Revolutionary
Guard attempted to dissolve
Shariat-Madari's political organiza
tion, the Moslem People's Republi
can Party, and the party fought back.
Yesterday's riot, witnesses said,
began after supporters of Khomeini
and Shariat-Madari held separate
marches to observe the 40th day
after Ashura, the holiest day in the
Shiite religious calendar. Ashura
commemorates the death of Hus
sein, the sect's second Imam
(leader) in a battle with members of
the rival Sunni Moslems.
Shariat-Madari, who is under
house arrest in Qom, Tuesday is
sued a plea to his followers to keep
the peace on the holiday. They
either doubted the authenticity of
the message or decided he was
being too soft, for many of them
demonstrated with machetes, iron
bars, wooden clubs or leather
slings.

Shariat-Madari's backers decided
to break up the pro-Khomeini de
monstration, an independent wit
ness said. But when they converged
on the pro-Khomeini group, they
found that it was backed up by the
well-armed Revolutionary Guards,
many of whom had been airlifted in
from Tehran.
Some of the guardsmen fired tear
gas grenades, others shot straight
into the crowd.
"It was horrible," a French photo
grapher said. "The demonstrators
had no guns at all. Some of the
guards were just firing aimlessly."
The confrontation erupted into
fighting all over the city. Some of
Shariat-Madari's supporters again at
tacked the local radio and television
transmitter, which they have seized
and lost again a half dozen times in
recent months.
Units of the Revolutionary Guards
attacked headquarters of the Mos
lem People's Republican Party, firing
tear gas and smoke grenades in a
vain attempt to force its occupants
out.
The government ordered the army
to impose martial law and by early
this morning, the city was reported
calm but tense.
Khomeini issued a statement cal
ling again for national unity and
blaming regional disorders on

"plots" by the United States and the
Soviet Union.
"Islam is being threatened by the
superpowers, who are plotting
against your religion and your coun
try," Khomeini told a delegation
from Axerbaijan. "The plots we see
around the country are designed to
prevent peace from being restored.
"The country needs calm, calm all
around the nation, so that we can
elect a president and a parliament."
The election for the Islamic repub
lic's first president is scheduled ]an.
25; no definite date has been set for
election of the new parliament.
Shariat-Madari, who after the pre
vious outbursts in Tabriz had always
issued appeals for calm, remained
silent last night. But it was not clear
whether he had refused to call for a
truce, or whether he had been pre
vented from doing so.
Although the crisis has brought
Iran and the United States to the
brink of military conflict, sources
said the Revolutionary Council —
surrounded by hostile minority
groups — have hardly discussed the
hostage issue at its past three meet
ings.
Nevertheless, the Ayatollah
Mohammed Beheshti, the chairman
of the council, said yesterday a
compromise solution to the crisis
may still be possible.

marches to observe the 40th day
after Ashura, the holiest day in the

commemorates the death of Hus

(leader) in a battle with members of
the rival Sunni Moslems.
Shariat-Madari, who is under
house arrest in Qom, Tuesday is
sued a plea to his followers to keep
the peace on the holiday. They
either doubted the authenticity of
the message or decided he was
being too soft, for many of them
demonstrated with machetes, iron
bars, wooden clubs or leather
slings.

Shariat-Madari's backers decided
to break up the pro-Khomeini de
monstration, an independent wit
ness said. But when they converged
on the pro-Khomeini group, they
found that it was backed up by the
well-armed Revolutionary Guards,
many of whom had been airlifted in
from Tehran.
Some of the guardsmen fired tear
gas grenades, others shot straight
into the crowd.
"It was horrible," a French photo
grapher said. "The demonstrators
had no guns at all. Some of the
guards were just firing aimlessly."
The confrontation erupted into
fighting all over the city. Some of
Shariat-Madari's supporters again at
tacked the local radio and television
transmitter, which they have seized
and lost again a half dozen times in
recent months.
Units of the Revolutionary Guards
attacked headquarters of the Mos
lem People's Republican Party, firing
tear gas and smoke grenades in a
vain attempt to force its occupants
out.
The government ordered the army
to impose martial law and by early
this morning, the city was reported
calm but tense.
Khomeini issued a statement cal
ling again for national unity and
blaming regional disorders on

"plots" by the United States and the
Soviet Union.
"Islam is being threatened by the
superpowers, who are plotting
against your religion and your coun
try," Khomeini told a delegation
from Axerbaijan. "The plots we see
around the country are designed to
prevent peace from being restored.
"The country needs calm, calm all
around the nation, so that we can
elect a president and a parliament."
The election for the Islamic repub

Shariat-Madari, who after the pre

issued appeals for calm, remained
silent last night. But it was not clear
whether he had refused to call for a
truce, or whether he had been pre
vented from doing so.
Although the crisis has brought
Iran and the United States to the
brink of military conflict, sources
said the Revolutionary Council —
surrounded by hostile minority
groups — have hardly discussed the
hostage issue at its past three meet

Mohammed Beheshti, the chairman
of the council, said yesterday a
compromise solution to the crisis
may still be possible.
The Los Angeles Times
Tehran, Iran — Opponents of the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini rioted
in the streets of the northwestern
city of Tabriz yesterday and were
driven back with gunfire from Kho
meini's Revolutionary Guards. The
shooting left at least eight dead and
more than 100 wounded.
The street battles, which rolled ac
ross Iran's second largest city from
mid-day until late evening, marked
the worst violence in a month of un
rest in the strategic Azerbaijan reg
ion.
All of the dead were believed to
be Azerbaijanis, members of Iran's
largest minority, and followers of
the Ayatollah Kazem Shariat-Madari,
Khomeini's only real rival in the
Shiite Moslem clergy. Many of the
Revolutionary Guards who fired on
them were Persians, members of the
country's largest ethnic group, and
loyal to Khomeini.
The deaths thus appeared certain
to deepen the bitter division bet
ween the Turkish-speaking Azer
baijanis, who make up an estimated
22 percent of Iran's population, and
the Farsi-speaking Persians, who
make up just under 50 percent.
It was difficult to obtain an accu
rate casualty count, for scattered
shooting continued in many areas
until almost midnight. "We don't
know how many are dead," an offi
cial at the East Axerbaijan provincial
governor's office said. "We have
been stuck in the building all day.
They're still shooting outside."
The crisis in the region has been
rooted in the long-dormant resent
ment of the Axerbaijanis, a re
sourceful people who have contri
buted more than their share of Iran's
technicians, managers and army of

f icers.
It was reflected in the tension be
tween Shariat-Madari, a scholarly,
soft-spoken man who led the con
servative wing of the clergy during
the revolution against Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, and Kho
meini, the Persian firebrand who ral
lied the masses around one simple
slogan: "Death to the shah."
The conflict was brought to a head
last month by a series of relatively
minor controversies — including
Khomeini's appointment of an un
popular governor.
Khomeini loyalists in the central
government handled the problems
clumsily, and the conflict spiraled
toward an explosion. In the one
case, the government agreed to re
move the governor, Aboul Hussein
Gharayi, but then went back on its
promise. Instead, the Revolutionary
Guard attempted to dissolve
Shariat-Madari's political organiza
tion, the Moslem People's Republi
can Party, and the party fought back.
Yesterday's riot, witnesses said,
began after supporters of Khomeini
and Shariat-Madari held separate
