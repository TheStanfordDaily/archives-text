## Broadway by the Bay Gypsy, Sherlock & Uncle Milty: local theaters ring in new year 
### 
In New York, the theater
season starts in June. Out
here, Broadway usually
blooms with the new year; at
least, that "Broadway" which
is imported by Bay Area com
panies, big and small, to pro
vide both commercial appeal
and (they hope) critical spark
â€” and to lure us into signing
up for those 1980 subscrip
tions.
San Francisco's two
musical-comedy showplaces
lead the borrowed-from-
Broadway parade. The Curran
Theatre will present Richard
Burton in Camelot, Dick Van
Dyke in The Music Man, Rex
Harrison in My Fair Lady, and
Alexis Smith in The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas.
The Civic Light Opera will
counter with Milton Berle in
Guys and Dolls, Robert Goulet
In On a Clear Day You Can See
Forever, the pre-Broadway
Umbrellas of Cherbourg
Abased on a French movie with
a score by Michel Legrand),
and Debbie Reynolds in
Cypsy.

The American Conservatory
Theatre will add Paul Giovan
ni's The Crucifer of Blood to its
repertoire Jan. 15. This Broad
way hit will join such faithful
standbys as Coward's H.iy
Fever, Hellman's The Little
Foxes and Romeo and Juliet:
and a new audience draw:
Shepard's off-Broadway
Buried Child.
Crucifer of Blood, loosely
based on the writings of
Conan Doyle, follows a "new"
Holmes and Watson on adven
tures of love, death, and of
course, scintillating, though
elementary, deduction. Peter
Donat will play the sleuth and
Daniel Davis his medical
sidekick.
ACT also will offer a French
musical in January. Images,
written and scored by Serge
Lama, will premiere Jan. 23. It
is called "a kaleidoscopic
stage musical showcasing the
music of Lama," which is
compared with that of Edith
Piaf and Jacques Brel.
The show will play a limited

engagement at the Marines
Memorial Theatre.
Rounding out the ACT sea
son will be Belasco's splashy
horse opera, The Cirl of the
Colden West, Cihelderode's
Pantagleize, revival of last sea
son's Ah, Wilderness! by
O'Neill, Durang'sA History of
the American Film and a li
mited engagement in June of
The Flephant Man, Bernard
Pomerance's current Broad
way sizzler.
Five, six, seven. It's A
Chorus Line, back again, at
The Golden Gate Theater in
San Francisco through Sun
day. The shiny, soapy Michael
Bennett musical features a na
tional company repor'-'dly
supervised by Bennett.
Not from anyplace but here
are two long-running San
Francisco shows, Beach Blan
ket Babylon Goes to the Stars
at Club Fugazi (with bigger,
better hats promised) and Irv
ing Berlin in Revue, a slapdash
collection by the Mr. America
of Tin Pan Alley. Although in

its second year, the revue is
under new management and
has a new, less proficient cast,
at the Chi Chi Theater Club.
Anouilh's The Waltz of the
Toreadors plays at the Ber
keley Repertory Theater
through Feb. 3. This pomp and
pompous farce stars Michael
Liebert as an overstuffed
French general who is dictat
ing his memoirs.
Even crazier is Wisdom
Amok, a world premiere of an
Albert Innaurato work at the
Berkeley Stage Company
through Sunday. In this gross,
uneven satire, the Catholic
Church takes it on the chin,
and in other parts of the body
as male nuns, crazy priests and
a nympho mother superior
criss the cross and raise hell.
On the Peninsula, the Gas
lighter Theater in Campbell
presents Hush Money or In
human Bondage through
March.
A Comedy of Errors runs
through Saturday at the Theat
reworks in Palo Alto.
