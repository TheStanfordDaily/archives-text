— EDWIN LEE
(with Karen Wada)

Among the mire and squalor
of the human condition which
modern man has created,
there survives his indomitable
spirit. This aspect of humani
ty's character will be the cen
tral concern and the direc
tion of the Department of
Drama's production ot Sean
O'Casey's The Silver Tassie,
which opens in February.
As directed by Miriam
Yahil-Wax, the play's thematic
thrust will recall Faulkner's
stirring Nobel Prize speech
("Man will not merely endure,
but will prevail.") Both this
production and Faulkner's
words commend resoundingly
and resonantly upon humani
ty's tenacious ability to rise
phoenixlike alter each catas

trophic war. We will see the
essential comic nature of hu
manity: its resurrectional
prowess, its inability to do or
to be killed, its will to live de
spite all that it does to destroy
itself.
Heading this production's
cast will be Fon Landra as
Harry Heegan, a soccer
playing soldier who wins a
silver tassie, a trophy, for his
club, and who means nothing
more to his family than the
glory of his athletic exploits,
lackie Kanner will play
Heegan s mother, who loves
him for his paychecks, Brent
Shaphren his father and Erin
Dignam the girltriend who
loves him lor his winning
ways. Sally Morton will be the

neighbor whose love for
Heegan goes unanswered, but
who nurses him when he re
turns from World War I a crip
ple.
Prof. Wendell Cole will de
sign the set, department cos
tumer Barbara Cleveland the
costumes and student )ohn
Ruttenberg the lighting. Stu
dent |erry Robinson is music
director.
As an Israeli, Yahil-Wax
said she chose this Irish play in
part because of a "similarity
between the fate of the Jewish
people and the Irish. In self
destructiveness, they are twins
. . . Internal strife has always
been and still is a tragic factor
in the Irish national fate as it is
in the Jewish. Both reveal im

probable combinations of fel
lowship and indifference . . .
Both are emotional, indi
vidualistic peoples."
Also, Yahil-Wax said she
found at Stanford "a genera
tion tor whom even Vietnam is
history, to whom a world war
is science fiction." Yahil-Wax
said she has experienced three
wars and she cannot "imagine
a world unaware of war, its
waste and futility."
O'Casey wrote The Silver
Tassie as a combination of
humor and tragedy, of
realism, expressionism and "a
lot of other isms," Yahil-Wax
explained. The play is very
funny despite its weighted
themes and "alternates bet

ween tact and fancy, ver
similitude and poetic exagger
ation.
A pitiless exposure," the
play "at the same time (is) a
superb piece of dramatic
poetry, a life-affirming state
ment,'' an anti-war statement
with "an insistence on the
supreme value of life as
against the hollow religious
and political slogans that jus
tify its sacrifice." Underlining
this, Yahil-Wax cited the play's
attacks on man's acceptance
of war as "a fact of life . . .
when people believe that the
only choice is to fight;" of the
influence of institutions which
O Casey believed started war
tor material gain; and society's
attempts to redeem itself

through its "rehabilitation" of
war victims — "that's consci
ence money," Yahil-Wax
explained. "O'Casey said that
society helped only itself by
rehabilitation . . . Harry, for
instance, finally realized that
he could not join a normal life
again, after he was in the
wheelchair . . . We have to
learn there is no alternative.
O'Casey wanted us to learn
not to break the pot in the first
place, instead of trying to glue
back the pieces."
The Silver Tassie will open
Feb. 13 and will run through
Feb. 16, and Feb. 20-23 in the
little Iheatre. Tickets are av
ailable at Tresidder, $l for stu
dents, $3 general admission.
