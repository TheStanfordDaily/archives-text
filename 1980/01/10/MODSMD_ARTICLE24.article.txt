# 'Going in Style' with Art, Lee, George
## Gang of muggers on the loose 
### 
Oh, they are lovable, all
right. They have more than 150
years of acting experience
among them. But what good
reason, besides those, exists
to see George Burns, Art Car
ney and lee Strasberg involve
themselves in such shameless
mugging as Coing in Style, a
Martin Brest film which de
pends upon that lovability and
venerable experience to sell a
candyweight story about grow
ing old without leaving off the
grab for nusto?

"The three men play friends
in their nth year who decide
that waiting to keel over is no
tun. As retired "good citi
zens," tjiey lind there's no
security in social security and
damn little care in Medicare.''
To shake things up, they de
cide to rob a Manhattan bank:
their tirst trip downtown in 20
years, complete with Groucho
Marx masks, is a success.
After their tirst heist, the trio
makes for Vegas and enjoys
luck at the gaming tables. Un-
I •

fortunately, oik i them dies,
leaving his partners to share
the guilt and the wealth, d
won't tell you which tellow
ducks out, because that's the
only bit ot suspense in this
film.)
Strasberg retains the most
dignity and suiters because ot
it. In this sitcom-style movie,
he seems subdued, almost re
luctant. Perhaps he couldn't
stand the idea ot milking every
gag tor the obvious effect.
Carney, as an ex-singing
bartender who never gives up
the song in his heart, repeats
the triumphant, renegade ail
ing style, which emerged in
The Late Show.
George Burns, cashing in on
his recent rise to popularity,
provides few real laughs. He
seems to leel pushed, perhaps

l>v writer-director Brest. At 28,
Brest ma\ not be old enough
to understand his characters
Oh, maybe I am being too
hard on everyone. Gning in
Stylo has its warm moments,
and overall, it is charming and
quaint, as it you'd met three
nic e old men sitting in Central
Park, as if you'd had a chat
with them about the weather
and their lives and they just
happened to mention that
they were lonely and wanted
some excitement, in tact, they
wanted "to be wanted — even
by the police. It's a start." Von
would look up iii surprise and
they would wink. Then the\
would tell jokes and stories
and do old vaudeville num
bets. Ho hum? Ho hum.
