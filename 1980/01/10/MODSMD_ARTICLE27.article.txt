# Redford, Fonda meander through underplayed Capra tale
## 
### 
. . . constructed as the visual equivalent of a
Willie Nelson song; pleasant, warm,
nearly uneventful, yet quietly thoughtful.

If you tried to make a Frank
,£apra movie today and shied
■away from the seemingly ob
ligatory "powerfully dramatic"
scenes, you'd probably end up
'yvith something quite like
Sydney Pollack's The Electric
Horseman. And to further the
fnovie's modern-day populist
Ambiance, when the simple
script is combined with the
Southwest locations, this
.Robert Redford-)ane Fonda
Star vehicle appears to
have been constructed as the
visual equivalent of a Willie
Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson is one
of Horseman's co-stars only
enhances the movie's pleas
ant, warm, nearly uneventful,
yet quietly thoughtful, feeling.
And like a Nelson song,
Horseman seems to meander

more often than not, carefully
avoiding "climactic moments"
and dampening much of the
movie's potential impact in the
process. Since the script, in its
original form, covered only 10
pages, such moments proba
bly just were never written.
This soft peddling both
helps and hurts Horseman. A
calmness, almost a feeling of
self-satisfaction pervades the
movie; when it tries to make
its points, the movie's at its
worst.
The movie's opening, which
plays as if it's one lengthy
medley of commercials, de
tails the dehumanization ot
faded rodeo star Sonny Steele
(Robert Redford) at the hands
of the corporation which pays
him to advertise its breakfast
cereal.

Despite the authentic artifi
ciality of the Las Vegas sur
roundings, Horseman's open
ing features the same tired
conflicts that fueled the Capra
movies; in this case, the black
hats are the big business
types, and Steele, for all his
shitkicker dumbness, is still
supposed to be a pretty good
guy. Thankfully, Redford is
several degrees more believa
ble and watchable than either
)immy Stewart or Gary
Cooper, and his inevitable re
bellion — in this case, stealing
the corporation's mistreated
$10 million thoroughbred — is
not as obvious and anticlimac
tic as it might have been.
Since )ane Fonda, who again
plays a TV newswoman, is the
co-star, most of the movie is
taken up with her dogged pur

suit of Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to
set the horse free. And the
bankers would have had a
tough time swallowing the
movie's $11 million dollar
price tag if there weren't some
semblance of a love story
thrown in, so Redford and
Fonda dutifully fall in love.
Vet for all of the prefab ele
ments involved, the Fonda-
Redford pairing is a disarm
ingly enjoyable one. The pon
derousness which has plagued
many of director Sydney Pol
lack's efforts (especially his
last one — the dismal Bobby
Deerfield) is largely absent
here. Due to the slender
script, many of the scenes had
to be improvised, but instead
of groping for things to say,
Pollack moves economically.
Most of the scenes are terrifi
cally underplayed; Pollack is
careful not to highlight the
obviously hackneyed ele
ments in the story, which
would have been disastrous.
But the skilled perfor
mances are ultimately the

major reason for Horseman's
success. Fonda plays a charac
ter whose personality lies
somewhere between ruthless
realist of the first half of The
China Syndrome and the
idealistic crusader of the sec
ond half of that movie. Fon
da's always on here; the TV
reporter's constant calculation
and continual search for im
pact dominate her very assured
performance. Fonda's got all
the surface elements right, but
there's not much complexity
in the script and Fonda's
character is thus a decidedly
limited one. When she falls in
love with Redford, you half
expect her to quickly exploit

him for her own personal gain,
but the movie's humanitarian
and humanist posture won't
allow for that.
As for Redford, the movie is
built around him and the
Sonny Steele character is ob
viously written for him; Red
ford's been in this position
many times, but rarely has he
come up with such an in
gratiating and thoroughly be
lievable performance. When
Steele is in Las Vegas, Redford
plays him as if he's totally lost;
when the movie shifts to the
wide open spaces, every bone
in Redford's body seems to re
lax, and the dumb cowboy
seems to take on a whole new

emotional dimension. Steele's
an uncomfortable speaker;
he'd be right at home in a
Capra movie, but he doesn't
talk about the American way of
life, or the evils of the system.
In short, Sonny Steele doesn't
really have a "message." He
just wants to free a horse and
go back to being a cowboy.
There's a warm nostalgia to
that, and even if it's a bit naive
and out of place, there's
something attractive about it,
especially in a season filled
with empty apocalyptic rumbl
ings like Star Trek and The
Black Hole.

Steele is in Las Vegas, Redford
plays him as if he's totally lost;
when the movie shifts to the
wide open spaces, every bone
in Redford's body seems to re
lax, and the dumb cowboy
seems to take on a whole new

emotional dimension. Steele's
an uncomfortable speaker;
he'd be right at home in a
Capra movie, but he doesn't
talk about the American way of
life, or the evils of the system.
In short, Sonny Steele doesn't
really have a "message." He
just wants to free a horse and
go back to being a cowboy.
There's a warm nostalgia to
that, and even if it's a bit naive
and out of place, there's
something attractive about it,
especially in a season filled
with empty apocalyptic rumbl
ings like Star Trek and The
Black Hole.

Rcdford and Fonda: Cheering the good guys
. . . constructed as the visual equivalent of a
Willie Nelson song; pleasant, warm,
nearly uneventful, yet quietly thoughtful.

If you tried to make a Frank
,£apra movie today and shied
■away from the seemingly ob
ligatory "powerfully dramatic"
scenes, you'd probably end up
'yvith something quite like
Sydney Pollack's The Electric
Horseman. And to further the
fnovie's modern-day populist
Ambiance, when the simple
script is combined with the
Southwest locations, this
.Robert Redford-)ane Fonda
Star vehicle appears to
have been constructed as the
visual equivalent of a Willie
Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson is one
of Horseman's co-stars only
enhances the movie's pleas
ant, warm, nearly uneventful,
yet quietly thoughtful, feeling.
And like a Nelson song,
Horseman seems to meander

more often than not, carefully
avoiding "climactic moments"
and dampening much of the
movie's potential impact in the
process. Since the script, in its
original form, covered only 10
pages, such moments proba
bly just were never written.
This soft peddling both
helps and hurts Horseman. A
calmness, almost a feeling of
self-satisfaction pervades the
movie; when it tries to make
its points, the movie's at its
worst.
The movie's opening, which
plays as if it's one lengthy
medley of commercials, de
tails the dehumanization ot
faded rodeo star Sonny Steele
(Robert Redford) at the hands
of the corporation which pays
him to advertise its breakfast
cereal.

Despite the authentic artifi
ciality of the Las Vegas sur
roundings, Horseman's open
ing features the same tired
conflicts that fueled the Capra
movies; in this case, the black
hats are the big business
types, and Steele, for all his
shitkicker dumbness, is still
supposed to be a pretty good
guy. Thankfully, Redford is
several degrees more believa
ble and watchable than either
)immy Stewart or Gary
Cooper, and his inevitable re
bellion — in this case, stealing
the corporation's mistreated
$10 million thoroughbred — is
not as obvious and anticlimac
tic as it might have been.
Since )ane Fonda, who again
plays a TV newswoman, is the
co-star, most of the movie is
taken up with her dogged pur

suit of Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to
set the horse free. And the
bankers would have had a
tough time swallowing the
movie's $11 million dollar
price tag if there weren't some
semblance of a love story
thrown in, so Redford and
Fonda dutifully fall in love.
Vet for all of the prefab ele
ments involved, the Fonda-
Redford pairing is a disarm
ingly enjoyable one. The pon
derousness which has plagued
many of director Sydney Pol
lack's efforts (especially his
last one — the dismal Bobby
Deerfield) is largely absent
here. Due to the slender
script, many of the scenes had
to be improvised, but instead
of groping for things to say,
Pollack moves economically.
Most of the scenes are terrifi
cally underplayed; Pollack is
careful not to highlight the
obviously hackneyed ele
ments in the story, which
would have been disastrous.
But the skilled perfor
mances are ultimately the

major reason for Horseman's
success. Fonda plays a charac
ter whose personality lies
somewhere between ruthless
realist of the first half of The
China Syndrome and the
idealistic crusader of the sec
ond half of that movie. Fon
da's always on here; the TV
reporter's constant calculation
and continual search for im
pact dominate her very assured
performance. Fonda's got all
the surface elements right, but
there's not much complexity
in the script and Fonda's
character is thus a decidedly
limited one. When she falls in
love with Redford, you half
expect her to quickly exploit

him for her own personal gain,
but the movie's humanitarian
and humanist posture won't
allow for that.
As for Redford, the movie is
built around him and the
Sonny Steele character is ob
viously written for him; Red
ford's been in this position
many times, but rarely has he
come up with such an in
gratiating and thoroughly be
lievable performance. When
Steele is in Las Vegas, Redford
plays him as if he's totally lost;
when the movie shifts to the
wide open spaces, every bone
in Redford's body seems to re
