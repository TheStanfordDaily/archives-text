# Soc major specialized
## 
### 
An effort to better pinpoint the
interests and academic specializa
tions of students has led the Sociol
ogy Dept. to offer its students a
choice of six major programs de
scribing various common emphases
of the department's majors.
In addition to the general sociol
ogy major, undergraduates now
have a choice between Applied
Sociology, Social Psychology and
Group Behavior, Organizational Be
havior, Comparative Social and
Political Institutions and Research
Methods as specialized programs.
Certification that the student has
completed one of the specialized
degree programs will appear on the
student's official transcript.
The impetus for the change came
from discussions in the depart
ment's undergraduate studies
committee, said committee chair
and sociology professor Richard
Scott.
Scott said discussions of the
change began about a year ago.
He called the change a "recogni
tion of the varying aid different ex
periences students were having" in
the department.
Explaining the rationale behind the
new programs, Scott said, "Sociol
ogy has become quite diverse, and
students come into our department
with highly varied intellectual and
career interests. We believe that the
new major programs will provide a
better structure within which these
interests can be served; and we be
lieve that graduate schools and
prospective employers will benefit
from better information about the
specific type of program completed

by the student."
Faculty advisers in the department
have been selected for each ot the
specialized programs.
The Applied Sociology program
emphasizes the contributions which
sociological knowledge can make to
the solution of social problems.
Problem areas include deviance,
poverty, mental illness, alcoholism
and problems in the definitions of
sex roles and the relations among
ethnic groups.
The Social Psychology and Inter
personal Processes program focuses
on the social organization of indi
vidual identity, beliefs and be
havior; and upon social structures
which define interpersonal interac
tions.
The Organizational Behavior
program encompasses both the
study of individual behavior within
organizations as well as the behavior
of organizations as vital institutions.
The Comparative Social and Polit
ical Institutions major studies all
principle types of social institutions
familial, political, religious â€” that
make up societies. Attention is also
focused on the role of the state in
our lives.
The Research Methods program
emphasizes the use of research and
analytical skills in the collection and
interpretation of data. Direct in
volvement in a research project is
required as a part of this program.
Scott said an analagous situation
to the one in the Sociology Dept. in
which students specialize in their
particular areas of interest already
exists in other University depart
ments, such as political science.
