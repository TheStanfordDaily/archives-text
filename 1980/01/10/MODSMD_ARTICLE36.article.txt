Judges can't protect nature
Washington — In an action that could curb
the ability of environmental groups to chal
lenge some government actions in court, the
Supreme Court held Monday that federal
judges have no power to stop a project on
grounds that it might damage the environment
Instead, the court decided by an 8 to 1 vote,
the only proper role for the federal courts in
environmental cases was to make sure that
agencies in the executive branch of govern
ment have followed the right procedures and
at least considered the consequences of their
actions upon the environment. The only dis
senter was Justice Thurgood Marshall.
The court's action came in an unsigned
opinion in a case involving a proposed low
income housing project in New York.
A federal appeals court in New York had
held up the project on grounds that the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Develop
ment failed to give "determinative weight" to
environmental factors such as the fact that the
surrounding neighborhood on Manhattan's
West Side already had other low-income
housing.
But the Supreme Court overturned the ap
peals court and decided to let the housing be
built. "There is no doubt that HUD consi
dered the environmental consequences of its
decision," the court said. The federal law pro
tecting the environment "requires no more"
than this, it added.
One government official familiar with en
vironmental cases predicted that the ruling
"will take the wind out of the sails of all
lawyers who want to go to court to challenge
environmentally undesirable actions by the
government."
The National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 requires government agencies to pre
pare a study called an "impact statement" be
fore taking any action that would significantly
affect the environment.
Monday's ruling (Strycker's Bay vs. Karlen,
79-168; New York vs. Karlen, 79-181; HUD vs.
Karlen, 79-184) severely restricts the ability of
environmentalists to win such cases.
Soviets airlift reinforcements
Kabul, Afghanistan — Soviet transports are
airlifting Red Army reinforcements to the
southern Afghan province of Kandahar, hop
ping over rebel-threatened highway passes of
the Hindu Kush mountains, sources reported
from Kandahar city yesterday.
( In a separate report, Afghan rebel infor
mants quoted by a Pakistani newspaper said
the newly arrived Soviet forces were moving
southward from Kandahar, an ancient walled
capital of Afghanistan, to take control of
strategic positions between the city and the
Pakistani border, 80 miles away.
The anti-communist rebels claimed the
Soviets were pouring fresh troops into Kan
dahar, 300 miles southwest of here, because
most Afghan government soldiers in the
southern province had defected to the insur
gents.
But this could not be verified, and U.S.
government analysts say the rebel reports of
Afghan army defections appear to be exagg
erated.
The defense minister of the new Moscow
backed Afghan government, Mohammed
Rafeh, declared yesterday in an interview witl
the Soviet news agency Tass that the Afghan

armed forces "unanimously back the new
leadership."
U.S.S.R. to stay in Afghanistan
Washington — Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev told President Jimmy Carter that
Russian troops will not be withdrawn from
Afghanistan until they "have completed their
work," a senior White House official said yes
terday.
The official, asking not to be identified by
name, said the Soviet leader's response came
when Carter complained over the "hotline"
to Moscow about the Soviet military move
ment into Afghanistan.
He said the conversation took place on
Dec. 29, two days after a Soviet-backed coup
took place in Afghanistan.
"You can characterize that statement (by
Brezhnev) as 'The Soviets will withdraw the
troops when they have completed their
work,' " the official said.
"It was far from a satisfactory response.
There was no specific period of time," the
official said.
According to the most recent U.S. govern
ment estimate, there are between 50,000 and
85,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
The White House official also indicated that
brief consideration had been given to using
military force to respond to the massive Soviet
military intervention.
But the official left the impression that such
a response was not given extensive review.
One of the steps Carter has taken in retalia
tion for the Soviet action in Afghanistan is to
order a partial embargo of grain sales to the
Soviets and campaign opponents have been
critical of that action. But the president repor
tedly has invited a group of farmers, who
could be directly hurt by the embargo, to a
briefing tomorrow.
Saudis behead 63 zealots
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia — Saudi executioners
yesterday beheaded 63 of the religious zealots
who seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Is
lam's holiest shrine, last November, the offi
cial Saudi news agency said.
The executions were decreed by King
Khaled after the country's religious leaders
issued an edict specifying the crime of attack
ing the mosque was punishable by death in
accordance with the Koran, the Moslem holy
book.
Beheading is the traditional method of
execution in Saudi Arabia, and is usually car
ried out in public.
The beheading of the mosque attackers was
carried out in eight cities in the vast desert
kingdom in an apparent move to show that
the authorities were in full control of the situ
ation.
Those executed included Juseiman Bin Seif,
the military commander of the fanatic Mahdist
group which attacked the mosque. He was a
member of the dissident southern Saudi tribe
of Al Otaiba.
The announcement said 41 of those exe
cuted were Saudi citizens. The others were 10
Egyptians, six South Yemenis, three Kuwaitis
and one each from North Yemen, Sudan and
Iraq.
Earlier, the Saudi government said foreig
ners in the group had acted out of religious
conviction and that no foreign powers were
involved in the mosque affair.

U.S.-China defense talks end
Peking — U.S. Defense Secretary Harold
Brown, ending four days of talks with Chinese
military leaders here, said yesterday the Un
ited States and China would independently
move to strengthen nations in the Afghanistan
area and that a high Chinese military delega
tion would visit the United States.
Brown also indicated at a press conference
that Washington would be receptive to future
Chinese requests to buy high-technology
equipment like computers that could have
some military application. He again ruled out
sale of arms to China, however, and did not
specify what action Peking and Washington
would take to stymie the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, an event that has done much to
unify American and Chinese strategic views.
On the Soviet presence in Afghanistan,
Brown said Chinese and U.S. views "are very
closely parallel about the need to strengthen
other nations in the region and each side will
take appropiate action on its own toward that
end." The statement appeared to reflect ear
lier hints by U.S. officials here that both na
tions would try to increase military aid to
Pakistan, whose border is threatened by the
presence of bands of Afghan insurgents fight
ing the invading Soviet army.
Chinese Defense Minister Ku Xiangqian,
toasting Brown at a farewell banquet last
night, called the visit "fruitful."
Anti-Soviet alignment urged
Peking — Condemning Soviet aggression in
the toughest terms yet, Vice Premier Deng
Xiaoping challenged the United States Tues
day to join China in concrete action rather
than empty words over Afghanistan.
The senior vice premier, in a 2Vi-hour meet
ing with U.S. Secretary of Defense Harold
Brown, called on all countries to ally them
selves against further Soviet expansion. But
he seemed to reserve the strongest words for
the United States, which is negotiating ex
changes of military and technological infor
mation with the Chinese in a week-long con
ference here.
"China and the United States," Deng said
according to the English-language dispatch re
leased by the Chinese news agency, "should
do something in a down-to-earth way so as to
defend world peace against Soviet
hegemonism."
Iran situation called blunder
Sacramento — President Jimmy Carter's
handling of the American hostage situation in
Iran may be "the major diplomatic blunder of
the 20th century," Gov. Jerry Brown charged
yesterday.
Brown, who is campaigning against Carter
for the Democratic nomination for president,
said Congress should immediately investigate
Carter's handling of the Iranian crisis, and that
Congress shouldn't wait until the hostages are
freed to start a probe.
A month ago, Brown said all presidential
candidates should support Carter and refrain
from comment on his handling of the Iranian
crisis for fear of endangering negotiations to
free the 50 American hostages.
But since Carter cited the Iranian crisis as
his reason for withdrawing from the planned
lowa debates — where Brown had hoped to
gain national attention — Brown has become

increasingly critical of the president's actions.
Brown took that criticism to a new extreme
when he returned here yesterday charging
that Carter could have prevented the hostages
being taken in the first place and hinting at a
possible cover-up of Carter's bungling of the
crisis.
Brown condemned what he called "the veil
of secrecy and wall of silence behind which
Jimmy Carter is manipulating public opinion.
"Nothing concrete is being done, or no
thing has worked, to obtain the release of the
hostages," Brown commented.
Asked what he would do differently than
Carter, Brown said the United States was in a
"no exit" position and that he had no better
answers except to call a summit of American
allies to consider options.
Nation's grain prices collapse
Washington — Corn, wheat and soybean
prices collapsed when the nation's grain fu
tures markets re-opened yesterday after a
two-day, government-ordered holiday.
Prices plummeted by the limits permitted
by grain market rules — 10 cents a bushel for
corn, 20 cents for wheat, 30 cents for soy
beans.
Millions of bushels of grain were offered for
sale, but there were few buyers. The wheat
pits of the Chicago Board of Trade handled
less than 10 percent of the usual day's vol
ume.
Grain elevators across the Midwest did little
business, while the grain belt struggled to
fathom the full impact of President jimmy Car
ter's decision to slash grain exports to the
Soviet Union.
Plummeting prices indicated the administ
ration's steps to offset the loss of 17 million
tons in grain sales to the Soviets were in
adequate, farmers and their friends com
plained.
Later in the day, agriculture officials re
leased new estimates of the nation's grain ex
ports this year, projecting they will fall from
109.2 million metric tons to 98 million tons.
Dow Jones down 1.62
New York — The stock market exploded in a
near-record first hour buying rush yesterday,
but then settled back to digest a mixture of
economic news and ended the day with a
small loss.
New York Stock Exchange volume rose to
65.26 million shares from 53.39 million Tues
day in the third-busiest day in Big Board his
tory. Opening-hour volume of 20.22 million
shares was just below the record of 20.73 mill
ion set last Oct. 10.
Although advances held a 2-1 edge over de
clines on the NYSE, heavy losses among sev
eral blue chips pulled the Dow Jones average
down by 1.62 points to 850.09. The average
had been ahead by more than 7 points earlier
in the day.
Today's weather
Rain likely today through tomorrow. Lows
40 to 50. Highs in the 50s. Wind becoming
northwest 15 to 25 mph today. Chance of rain
decreasing to 60 percent today and 50 percent
tonight.
Through Monday — cool and wet weather.
Rain or snow locally heavy over the weekend.
