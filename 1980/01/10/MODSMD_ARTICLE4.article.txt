# Longshoremen protest invasion of Afghanistan
## ILA boycotts Soviet cargo 
### 
The los Angeles Times
New York — The International
Longshoremen's Association (ILA)
announced yesterday that it would
boycott all ships and cargo to and
from the Soviet Union until Soviet
troops are withdrawn from Af
ghanistan.
The action by the union represent
ing 116,000 dockworkers in ports
from Maine to Texas and Puerto Rico
would affect not only ships of Rus
sian registry but any other vessel
carrying goods destined to or from
the Soviet Union. The dockworkers
also refused to handle any Soviet
passenger liners.
Meanwhile, the United Nations
Security Council has called for an
emergency special session of the
General Assembly to deal with the
Soviet military intervention in Af
ghanistan.
The council approved a Philippine
and Mexican request to take the
issue to the 152-nation assembly fol
lowing a Soviet veto in the council
Monday of a resolution calling for

withdrawal of foreign troops from
the Central Asian nation. The vote
last night was 12-2, with Zambia abs
taining.
The Soviet Union and East Ger
many voted against the measure, as
they had against the council resolu
tion on Monday, claiming it was an
interference in the internal affairs of
Afghanistan. The question was a
procedural matter, however, and
the negative Soviet vote did not
constitute a veto.
Immediately after the vote,
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim
notified all representatives accre
dited to the United Nations that the
emergency session would convene
today at 3 p.m. EST.
At a Manhattan news conference,
Thomas Gleason, the ILA's presi
dent, emphasized that his union was
acting independently of the Carter
administration, a fact quickly con
firmed by the White House, which
clearly had reservations about the
longshoremen's action.
"We understand the reasons for
their decision," said presidential
press secretary )ody Powell. "The
ILA is reacting also with outrage to
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
We are discussing with them (the
union) their actions and our posture
with a view toward a situation where
their actions further the goals of
American foreign policy."
Administration officials, obviously
chagrined that the ILA had taken its
sweeping step, were seeking
through private meetings to get the
union to bring its position into line
with the president's limited em
bargo on sales of grain and high
technology products to Russia.
"The administration has made it
clear that we hope foreign policy
decisions will be left to the chief
executive and his branch of gov
ernment and not be made outside of
it," State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter 111 said.
However, the ILA's decision to
boycott Soviet ships and cargo re
ceived some support.
"We are proud that trade un
ionists are exhibiting such pat
riotism," said Allen Zack, a spokes
man for the national AFL-CIO.
"We think it is legitimate, respon
sible and proper, and believe it is in
support of U.S. government policy."
On Capitol Hill, Rep. ]ohn Mur
phy, (D-N.Y.) chairman of the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, wrote President Jimmy
Carter yesterday requesting that the
White House back the ILA. Murphy
asked the president to give priority

consideration to closing U.S. ports
altogether to the Soviet Union's
merchant fleet, the world's largest.
How effective the dockworkers
boycott would be was uncertain.
West Coast longshoremen are co
vered by the International
Longshoremen's and Warehouse
men's Union, and officials of that
union indicated they would urge
their members to continue to load
cargo.
There were also questions of
whether workers in all of the almost
40 ports the ILA represents would
line up solidly behind the decision.
In many of these cities, no Soviet
vessels were at the dock, so
Cleason's edict remained untested.
A key grain shipping port was New
Orleans, where no Soviet freighters
were in berth. But at dockside and
scheduled to leave New Orleans on
Saturday were two Soviet passenger
liners. The longshoremen's boycott
could affect the loading of food,
baggage and other commodities
aboard the passenger liners.
"These guys feel it in their guts
and they are unhappy and they don't
disagree with Gleason," said E.S.
Reed, executive director and gen
eral manager of the Port of New Or
leans, who said that an average of
nine Soviet cargo vessels a month
use the port.
At his news conference, Gleason
said that as many as 100 Soviet ships
or vessels with cargo bound for the
Soviet Union may be affected on any
day in ports under the ILA's jurisdic
tion.
"This order is effective across the
board, on all vessels and all cargoes
— grain and other foods, as well as
high valued general freight," the
union leader said in announcing the
work stoppage.
"Our people are upset and they
refuse to continue a business-as
usual policy as long as the Russians
insist on bemg international bully
boys."
Gleason estimated that the
longshoremen's refusal to handle
ships would cost the Soviet Union
"hundreds of millions of dollars"
and involve "millions of tons of
cargo."
ILA dockworkers already are
boycotting cargo bound for Iran be
cause of the American hostages held
at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Gleason said his union's Iranian ac
tion was tying up 500,000 tons of
cargo on U.S. docks.

sels on four other occasions.

Orleans, where no Soviet freighters
were in berth. But at dockside and
scheduled to leave New Orleans on
Saturday were two Soviet passenger
liners. The longshoremen's boycott
could affect the loading of food,
baggage and other commodities
aboard the passenger liners.
"These guys feel it in their guts
and they are unhappy and they don't
disagree with Gleason," said E.S.
Reed, executive director and gen
eral manager of the Port of New Or
leans, who said that an average of
nine Soviet cargo vessels a month
use the port.
At his news conference, Gleason
said that as many as 100 Soviet ships
or vessels with cargo bound for the
Soviet Union may be affected on any
day in ports under the ILA's jurisdic
tion.
"This order is effective across the
board, on all vessels and all cargoes
— grain and other foods, as well as
high valued general freight," the
union leader said in announcing the
work stoppage.
"Our people are upset and they
refuse to continue a business-as
usual policy as long as the Russians
insist on bemg international bully
boys."
Gleason estimated that the
longshoremen's refusal to handle
ships would cost the Soviet Union
"hundreds of millions of dollars"
and involve "millions of tons of
cargo."
ILA dockworkers already are
boycotting cargo bound for Iran be
cause of the American hostages held
at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Gleason said his union's Iranian ac
tion was tying up 500,000 tons of
cargo on U.S. docks.
The ILA has boycotted Soviet ves
sels on four other occasions.
The los Angeles Times
New York — The International
Longshoremen's Association (ILA)
announced yesterday that it would
boycott all ships and cargo to and
from the Soviet Union until Soviet
troops are withdrawn from Af
ghanistan.
The action by the union represent
ing 116,000 dockworkers in ports
from Maine to Texas and Puerto Rico
would affect not only ships of Rus
sian registry but any other vessel
carrying goods destined to or from
the Soviet Union. The dockworkers
also refused to handle any Soviet
passenger liners.
Meanwhile, the United Nations
Security Council has called for an
emergency special session of the
General Assembly to deal with the
Soviet military intervention in Af
ghanistan.
The council approved a Philippine
and Mexican request to take the
issue to the 152-nation assembly fol
lowing a Soviet veto in the council
Monday of a resolution calling for

withdrawal of foreign troops from
the Central Asian nation. The vote
last night was 12-2, with Zambia abs
taining.
The Soviet Union and East Ger
many voted against the measure, as
they had against the council resolu
tion on Monday, claiming it was an
interference in the internal affairs of
Afghanistan. The question was a
procedural matter, however, and
the negative Soviet vote did not
constitute a veto.
Immediately after the vote,
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim
notified all representatives accre
dited to the United Nations that the
emergency session would convene
today at 3 p.m. EST.
At a Manhattan news conference,
Thomas Gleason, the ILA's presi
dent, emphasized that his union was
acting independently of the Carter
administration, a fact quickly con
firmed by the White House, which
clearly had reservations about the
longshoremen's action.
"We understand the reasons for
their decision," said presidential
press secretary )ody Powell. "The
ILA is reacting also with outrage to
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
We are discussing with them (the
union) their actions and our posture
with a view toward a situation where
their actions further the goals of
American foreign policy."
Administration officials, obviously
chagrined that the ILA had taken its
sweeping step, were seeking
through private meetings to get the
union to bring its position into line
with the president's limited em
bargo on sales of grain and high
technology products to Russia.
"The administration has made it
clear that we hope foreign policy
decisions will be left to the chief
executive and his branch of gov
ernment and not be made outside of
it," State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter 111 said.
However, the ILA's decision to
boycott Soviet ships and cargo re
ceived some support.
"We are proud that trade un
ionists are exhibiting such pat
riotism," said Allen Zack, a spokes
man for the national AFL-CIO.
"We think it is legitimate, respon
sible and proper, and believe it is in
support of U.S. government policy."
On Capitol Hill, Rep. ]ohn Mur
phy, (D-N.Y.) chairman of the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, wrote President Jimmy
Carter yesterday requesting that the
White House back the ILA. Murphy
asked the president to give priority

consideration to closing U.S. ports
altogether to the Soviet Union's
merchant fleet, the world's largest.
How effective the dockworkers
boycott would be was uncertain.
West Coast longshoremen are co
vered by the International
Longshoremen's and Warehouse
men's Union, and officials of that
union indicated they would urge
their members to continue to load
cargo.
There were also questions of
whether workers in all of the almost
40 ports the ILA represents would
line up solidly behind the decision.
In many of these cities, no Soviet
vessels were at the dock, so
Cleason's edict remained untested.
