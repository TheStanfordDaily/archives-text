# Bay Area profs sexually harass women

### Mike Vaska 
Alleged sexual harassment of
women students by two Bay Area
professors, one at San Jose State and
the other at UC-Berkeley, have
caused officials at those schools to
take unprecedented disciplinary ac
tion.
Phillip Jacklin, an associate pro
fessor of philosophy at San jose
State was fired by Glenn Dumke,
chancellor of the California State
University and Colleges system "on
the basis of unanimous recommen
dation for dismissal by a faculty
committee and by San Jose Presi
dent Gail Fullerton."
Jacklin had been accused by five
women students of persistently
touching, embracing, kissing, fondl
ing and propositioning them in inci
dents occurring since the Fall of
1977.
At Cal, Elbaki Hermassi, an
assistant professor of sociology, was
suspended without pay for one
quarter for similar behavior which
students say he exhibited as far back
as 1971. Hermassi, currently on
sabatical in the Middle East, will lose
about $5000 due to the suspension.
In addition, a secret investigative
report and a summary of administra
tion findings in the case will be in
cluded permanently in Hermassi's
personnel file. These actions are a
"very substantial penalty" according
to Dick Hafner, spokesman for the
university.
Both Jacklin and Hermassi could
not be reached for comment, al
though they are on record as deny
ing the charges against them.
"Hermassi has agreed to accept
the administration's proposal for
disposition of the case in order to
avoid further proceedings and to set
matters at rest," said Hafner.
The official statement issued by
Chancellor Albert Bowker charging
that "misconduct warranting discip
line" had occurred did not mention
Hermassi by name, but officials at
the university have refused to deny
press reports and statements by stu

dents that he was the professor im
plicated.
Students at UC-Berkeley con
demned what they termed the "le
nient" punishment of Hermassi.
"The punishment doesn't fit the
violation," said student advocate
Mark Litchman. "Hermassi substan
tially affected the academic careers
of 14 students," he claimed. He
noted that in the San Jose State case,
with very similar circumstances, the
professor involved was fired, not
merely reprimanded.
The decision will be protested
today at noon in a demonstration
sponsored by a group called
Women Organized Against Sexual
Harassment (WOASH), said Litch
man.

WOASH will also take the deci
sion to civil court, he added.
In contrast to the situation at UC-
Berkeley, no group contacted on the
San Jose State campus indicated
student involvement in the con
troversy. The hearing and decision
on the case were made in secret by a
faculty committee and the SJS presi
dent.
WOASH first brought the current
charges against Hermassi to the uni
versity last spring. They were inves
tigated by Susan French of the UC-
Davis Law School who was ap
pointed by the administration. Her
report, which was not made public,
led the administration to conclude
that disciplinary action was neces
sary, according to Hafner.

In addition to the advances lead
ing to disciplinary action, Hermassi
had been accused of proposing sex
ual relationships to other women
students. One student alleged the
professor had retaliated with an un
favorable letter of recommendation
when she had resisted his overtures,
another said he had offered her a
higher grade in exchange for sexual
favors.
Both UC and State Un iversity
spokesman said Tuesday they were
unaware of any recent actions at
other institutions as severe as those
taken against Jacklin and Hermassi.
Stanford officials and student
groups involved with handling sex
ual harassment complaints did not
have enough information on the de
cisions to give comment.
