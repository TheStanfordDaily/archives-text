# AIC expands advising capacity
## 
### Gary Fremerman 
In an effort to improve undergraduate advising here,
the Academic Information Center (AIC) has increased
its general advisory services this quarter, while the
two-year-old Advising Associate (AA) Program is
scheduled to expand next fall to a fourth freshman
dorm.
In the past, the AIC offered primarily pre
professional advising to students. But beginning this
quarter, the center has added general academic coun
seling, which can be obtained daily by appointment or
on a walk-in basis.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian, the increase in AIC advisory services is
aimed at providing students "quick answers to simple
questions," especially when their normal advisers are
unavailable.
But AIC counselors will neither sign study lists nor
replace the normal role of assigned advisers, he added.
The Advising Associate Program, now covering some
400 freshmen in Branner Hall and in Wilbur Hall's Ar
royo and Rinconada dorms, will be expanded next year
"because it has proven to be quite successful," Katch
adourian said.
The number of juniors and seniors who join with
general faculty and staff advisers in providing academic

counseling to freshmen will increase from 40 to 50,
according to AA co-coordinator Dan Lessler.
The next AA locale remains undecided, Lessler said.
"But we're sort of thinking we'll stick to Wilbur Hall.
Now that the program's off the ground and growing
slowly, we want to stay self-contained."
Katchadourian added that if the program continues
to be a success, it eventually may include all freshmen
dorms, as well as those with large numbers of
freshmen.
However, he was quick to emphasize, neither AAs
nor the increased advisory services at AIC, is intended
to replace the existing system of undergraduate advis
ing. "Both are attempts at addressing inefficiencies of
the system while maintaining its basic structure," he
added.
The AlC's general advisers now are Stephen Peeps,
formerly an Associate Director of Undergraduate Ad
missions here, and Elizabeth Meyer, who also will con
tinue as one of the center's pre-professional advisers.
"A person in my place shouldn't be a surrogate ad
viser," said Peeps, whose appointment schedule has
been full this week. "Obviously, nobody could offer
effective service that way. If that happened, we'd be
defeating the system and short-changing students in
the process."
