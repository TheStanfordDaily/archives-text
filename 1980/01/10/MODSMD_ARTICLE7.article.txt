# Triples, strict residence priorities norm at other schools
## 
### Suzanne Smith 
Students who don't like the
housing draw system here
should count their blessings.
They're lucky they're not at
some of the other major uni
versities where returning resi
dents have priority their entire
academic career or where
doubles have been converted
to triples to take up home
less" students.
Eight major universities
were contacted by the Daily to
compare their housing alloca
tion systems with the housing
"lottery" used here at Stan
ford. While Harvard, Vale,
UCLA and Northwestern in
Chicago all place as much im
portance on returning status
as does Stanford, other
schools like USC, Duke and
the University of Chicago
guarantee all on-campus stu
dents a spot in the same dorm
for their entire career at
school. Only Princeton stu
dents are assigned housing
strictly on the basis of class
seniority and draw number.

Here at Stanford, on
campus housing — except for
fraternities and freshman
housing — is allocated each
spring by a draw. All students
mUst declare one of their years
"unguaranteed," and that
year, they are not guaranteed
a residence on campus.
In the draw, students submit
eight choices along with their
guaranteed or unguaranteed
status and any priorities they
may have by their being a re
turning resident or by having
enough energy to fulfill the
requirements sometimes laid
down by special row houses.
They then randomly select a
draw number. Guarantee
status and draw number de
termine who is in the assigna
ble group, which usually in
cludes some unguaranteed
students.
Those who are assignable
are given the highest of their
eight choices their priorities
and draw number allow. As
signments are made in draw
number order until houses are

tilled. All guaranteed students
are assigned somewhere on
campus, though they may not
necessarily receive one of
their designated choices.
The draw system was
created in 1971 by an ad hoc
committee of students, faculty
and administrators. The
guaranteed housing plan was
added in 1974.
Although many aspects of
the allocation procedure have
been the subject of student
complaints, "no one ever
comes up with anything bet
ter," said )ean Kitaji, super
visor of the single student
housing office.
"There are discussions
every year about redoing the
draw," she added.
Returning priority
One of the loudest com
plaints concerns the returning
resident priority. Many stu
dents say it favors those who
are lucky enough to draw well
one year.
But two myths exaggerate
the unfairness of this policy.

Contrary to popular belief,
students have no priority to a
dorm in which they have spent
their freshman year. Second,
even the most popular dorms
are never dominated by the
previous year's residents. This
is because a large number of
specific rooms in every four
class dorm is reserved before
the draw for entering
freshmen and transfers, and
also because enough old resi
dents always decide to move
out — because they are un
guaranteed or because they
want to graduate, go overseas
or try something different.
"Most people defend re
turning resident priority on
the argument of maintaining
house continuity," explained
Kitaji. "Each house has a per
sonality. People who have
lived there beiore know that
personality, as well as the
physical characteristics of the
house — where to have good
parties, etc. These people can
serve as a core group of in
itiators, especially at the be

ginning of the year."
Another advantage of the re
turning resident priority is that
it lends some predictability to
the housing process, Kitaji
said. This is both a psychologi
cal lift to students who want
some idea of where they may
be assigned, and a logistical
aid to the office, which can
count on a fairly consistent
number of students returning
to each residence.

Some students argue that
class seniority should count
tor something in Stanford's
system.
At Stanford, class makes no
difference in determining re
sidence. The three classes par
ticipate in a single draw.
This is unusual among top
universities. UCLA and
Northwestern are the only
schools of the eight inter
viewed where seniority is not

an advantage. All others first
assign seniors in draw number
order, then juniors, then
sophomores. Under such a
system, it is virtually impossi
ble to draw poorly three years
in a row. By the time students
are seniors, they should man
age to get one of their top
choices.
But Kitaji finds this too
simplistic.

Praying for a high draw number, this student reached into a deep pile of 5000 envelopes last year that
helped determine what on-campus housing he received.
