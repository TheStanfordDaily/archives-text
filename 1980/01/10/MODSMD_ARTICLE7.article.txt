# Triples, strict residence priorities norm at other schools
## 
### Suzanne Smith 
Students who don't like the
housing draw system here
should count their blessings.
They're lucky they're not at
some of the other major uni
versities where returning resi
dents have priority their entire
academic career or where
doubles have been converted
to triples to take up home
less" students.
Eight major universities
were contacted by the Daily to
compare their housing alloca
tion systems with the housing
"lottery" used here at Stan
ford. While Harvard, Vale,
UCLA and Northwestern in
Chicago all place as much im
portance on returning status
as does Stanford, other
schools like USC, Duke and
the University of Chicago
guarantee all on-campus stu
dents a spot in the same dorm
for their entire career at
school. Only Princeton stu
dents are assigned housing
strictly on the basis of class
seniority and draw number.

Here at Stanford, on
campus housing — except for
fraternities and freshman
housing — is allocated each
spring by a draw. All students
mUst declare one of their years
"unguaranteed," and that
year, they are not guaranteed
a residence on campus.
In the draw, students submit
eight choices along with their
guaranteed or unguaranteed
status and any priorities they
may have by their being a re
turning resident or by having
enough energy to fulfill the
requirements sometimes laid
down by special row houses.
They then randomly select a
draw number. Guarantee
status and draw number de
termine who is in the assigna
ble group, which usually in
cludes some unguaranteed
students.
Those who are assignable
are given the highest of their
eight choices their priorities
and draw number allow. As
signments are made in draw
number order until houses are

tilled. All guaranteed students
are assigned somewhere on
campus, though they may not
necessarily receive one of
their designated choices.
The draw system was
created in 1971 by an ad hoc
committee of students, faculty
and administrators. The
guaranteed housing plan was
added in 1974.
Although many aspects of
the allocation procedure have
been the subject of student
complaints, "no one ever
comes up with anything bet
ter," said )ean Kitaji, super
visor of the single student
housing office.
"There are discussions
every year about redoing the
draw," she added.
Returning priority
One of the loudest com
plaints concerns the returning
resident priority. Many stu
dents say it favors those who
are lucky enough to draw well
one year.
But two myths exaggerate
the unfairness of this policy.

Contrary to popular belief,
students have no priority to a
dorm in which they have spent
their freshman year. Second,
even the most popular dorms
are never dominated by the
previous year's residents. This
is because a large number of
specific rooms in every four
class dorm is reserved before
the draw for entering
freshmen and transfers, and
also because enough old resi
dents always decide to move
out — because they are un
guaranteed or because they
want to graduate, go overseas
or try something different.
"Most people defend re
turning resident priority on
the argument of maintaining
house continuity," explained
Kitaji. "Each house has a per
sonality. People who have
lived there beiore know that
personality, as well as the
physical characteristics of the
house — where to have good
parties, etc. These people can
serve as a core group of in
itiators, especially at the be

ginning of the year."
Another advantage of the re
turning resident priority is that
it lends some predictability to
the housing process, Kitaji
said. This is both a psychologi
cal lift to students who want
some idea of where they may
be assigned, and a logistical
aid to the office, which can
count on a fairly consistent
number of students returning
to each residence.

Some students argue that
class seniority should count
tor something in Stanford's
system.
At Stanford, class makes no
difference in determining re
sidence. The three classes par
ticipate in a single draw.
This is unusual among top
universities. UCLA and
Northwestern are the only
schools of the eight inter
viewed where seniority is not

an advantage. All others first
assign seniors in draw number
order, then juniors, then
sophomores. Under such a
system, it is virtually impossi
ble to draw poorly three years
in a row. By the time students
are seniors, they should man
age to get one of their top
choices.
But Kitaji finds this too
simplistic.

Praying for a high draw number, this student reached into a deep pile of 5000 envelopes last year that
helped determine what on-campus housing he received.
"It just doesn't work like
that," she said. No one can
agree on what's most desira
ble. Fven with a seniority sys
tem, students who asked tor
Manzanita would get their first
choice three years in a row,
while seniors who asked for
55H Mayfield still might not get
it."
furthermore, according to
Rodger Whitney, director of
Stanford's newly conceived
Housing Center, "a seniority
system would go against Stan
ford's view of all students as
adults with the same rights
and privileges. Age is such an
arbitrary criterion. Ours is
based on interest. For exam
ple, a student who has a real
desire to live at American
Studies should have a priority
there regardless of age."
Northwestern's housing di
rector Louise Anderson had
another argument against a
seniority system: "Actually,
it's the upperclassmen who
know their way around better
and can find off-campus hous
ing more easily."
Housing crunch
That Stanford does not
guarantee its students lour
years of campus housing is
probably a unanimous com
plaint among students.
Last autumn, about 5100 of

Stanford's 6500 under
graduates were able to live on
campus. Not including frater
nities, that figure was about
4550. Although most un
guaranteed students can sign
waiting lists and eventually be
housed, they must always be
prepared tor the worst.
The University is already
working to nullify this com
plaint. A dorm complex west
ot Lagunita Court is scheduled
tor completion in 1982. The
complex, to consist of a "vari
ety of living units," according
to Kitaji, will house about 800
students. Whitney calls this a
"significant" amount, al
though still not enough to
guarantee all students a cam
pus residence.
The housing crunch is
hardly a problem unique to
Stanford. Of the eight schools
surveyed, only two — Prince
ton and the University ol
Chicago — have enough
rooms for everyone who
wishes to live on campus.
The rest are coping with the
shortage in a variety of ways.
USC is discussing an un
guaranteed plan similar to
Stanford's. Vale is simply ad
mitting fewer students each
year. Duke has converted
doubles into triples and de
clared all transfer students
"unguaranteed." UCLA and

Northwestern are constructing
new dorms.
One problem with having
enough room lor everyone,
explains Whitney, is that by
spring, many rooms are inevit
ably vacated. As it is now,
these rooms are simply nllcd
by ludents who had been li\
ing off-campus. Without an
"excess" of students, the
rooms would remain empty
and room rates would reflect
the cost of maintaining them
Complexity
Many Stanford students
consider the housing system
here too complex.
According to authorities,
the complexity is largely unav
oidable in view of the large di
versity of housing on campus.
"No other system in the coun
try ofters this variety of lifes
tyles," says Whitney, who
began work here this Sep
tember. "I'm not sure stu
dents here appreciate this
richness. At first I was a little
shocked that they didn't
realize that this is unique."
On the other hand, Whitney
is quick to recognize that the
complexity has negative con
sequences. He considers the
draw procedure too confusing
and time-consuming for stu
dents. Indeed, students who
don't get what they want may
feel cheated because they

can't figure out why. And
theoretically, with two draws
to enter, eight choices to
select, and countless open
houses to attend, students can
spend much of spring quarter
simply deciding where to live.
Another drawback is that
unguaranteed students often
don't know where they are on
the waiting list until Sep
tember. The priority system is
so involved that calculating a
student's chances of being as
signed is nearly impossible.
Harvard and Yale's hous
ing systems provide a dramatic
contrast to Stanford's complex
one. AM freshmen are required
to live in a certain area of
campus. In the spring, they
are assigned (at Harvard, by a
draw; at Yale, randomly) to
one of 12 large, fairly
homogeneous dorms, called
"houses," or "colleges,"
where they spend the next
three years. In most cases,
students change only rooms
within that dorm from year to
year.
Whitney is intent on
simplifying Stanford's system,
but not to this extent. He is
now involved in developing a
single housing center to re
place the separate offices for
undergraduates; graduate
students and married stu
dents. The center should be
fully operational this spring.
He is also considering re
ducing the number of choices
in the draw from eight to five,
and moving up deadlines to
speed up the process. He may
also nullify the rule that gives
unguaranteed students return
ing resident priority.
No matter what, Whitney
promises that "we will see
some changes in the draw sys
tem this spring — in policies,
deadlines and priority no
tions."

A library behind some fraternities on campus was converted into temporary housing facilities earlier this
Jvear when the housing crunch became worse than usual. Other colleges handled the situation differently,
some by accepting fewer students.
