# U. of Chicago's woman
## president holds tough job 
### 
Chicago (AP) — In an age of
cutbacks and cruel tuitions,
faced with student and faculty
criticism, Hanna Cray has
marked yet another first: she's
completed her first year as
president of the University of
Chicago.
Hanna Holborn Gray is used
to long odds, a woman who
has made her way in higher
education, traditionally a
man's world, as a dean, a pro
vost, an acting president, a
president. She's shown she's
not afraid of a tough fight,
controversy or disapproval.
"I think that when it is
necessary, it is important to
take a stand," she says. She
has taken several.
As provost at Yale Univer
sity, she pared a $1 million an
nual budget deficit and even
closed the sacrosanct Vale Fa
culty Club. As Vale's acting
president, she faced down a
bitter, lengthy strike by
cafeteria and maintenance
workers.
Then, in her first year as the
chief of one of America's most
prestigious academic centers,
she weathered a storm of criti
cism for a controversial award
and for the university's in
vestment policies.
Even some of her critics over
the award, given to Robert
McNamara, say Gray
shows promise of becoming
the latest in a line of distin
guished presidents at the uni
versity.
She has zeroed in on the
problems that threaten private
institutions: the financial
crunch, where the private re
search university is headed,
and how to cope with less.

She's also concerned with
the quality of campus lite and
whether students at her uni
versity are having enough fun,
which gives an insight into the
multi-faceted, tall, gray-haired
woman.
She's been called brusque,
efficient, cold, distant She's
not described, though, as
stuffy or formal.

Mrs. Cray has been
criticized for being a director
of J.P. Morgan & Co. and its
banking subsidiary, Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co., and for
Morgan Guaranty's reaffirm

the university's sizeable in
vestments in South Atrica, but
says divestment is "incompat

sponsibility to manage univer
sity funds.

Chicago (AP) — In an age of
cutbacks and cruel tuitions,
faced with student and faculty
criticism, Hanna Cray has
marked yet another first: she's
completed her first year as
president of the University of
Chicago.
Hanna Holborn Gray is used
to long odds, a woman who
has made her way in higher
education, traditionally a
man's world, as a dean, a pro
vost, an acting president, a
president. She's shown she's
not afraid of a tough fight,
controversy or disapproval.
"I think that when it is
necessary, it is important to
take a stand," she says. She
has taken several.
As provost at Yale Univer
sity, she pared a $1 million an
nual budget deficit and even
closed the sacrosanct Vale Fa
culty Club. As Vale's acting
president, she faced down a
bitter, lengthy strike by
cafeteria and maintenance
workers.
Then, in her first year as the
chief of one of America's most
prestigious academic centers,
she weathered a storm of criti
cism for a controversial award
and for the university's in
vestment policies.
Even some of her critics over
the award, given to Robert
McNamara, say Gray
shows promise of becoming
the latest in a line of distin
guished presidents at the uni
versity.
She has zeroed in on the
problems that threaten private
institutions: the financial
crunch, where the private re
search university is headed,
and how to cope with less.

She's also concerned with
the quality of campus lite and
whether students at her uni
versity are having enough fun,
which gives an insight into the
multi-faceted, tall, gray-haired
woman.
