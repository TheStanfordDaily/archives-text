The Washington Post
United Nationsâ€” In language that
recalled the rhetoric of the Cold War,
the General Assembly convened the
fifth emergency session in its 34-year
history yesterday with a debate on
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Although the Soviet ambassador
here was slated to speak in defense
of his government's Afghan action,
he gave up the opportunity at the last
minute. Instead, Eastern bloc
member Poland took the initiative to
"strongly object" to a meeting called
by "reactionary elements" as a
"smoke screen to cover (their) ag
gressive designs."
Japan, Senegal, Colombia and
China spoke in favor of a resolution,
vetoed by the Soviets in the Security
Council Wednesday night, calling for
troop withdrawal.
'Global strategy'
Chinese Ambassadorto the United
Nations Chen Chu said the Soviet in
vasion was part of a "global strategy"
intent on "dominating the world."
Chen compared the Soviet move to
Hitler's invasion of Austria and
Czechoslovakia at the start of World
War 11.
On the question of Iran, the Un
ited States yesterday picked up a cru
cial ninth Security Council vote, re
portedly from Tunisia, for the impos
ition of economic sanctions.
Diplomatic sources said the U.S.
delegation was expected to submit
its sanctions resolution to the coun
cil last night or early today and ask
that it be tabled. Under U.N. rules, a
tabled resolution must be taken up
by the Security Council within 24
hours, and a council meeting pre
sumably will be held by tomorrow.
Take initiative away
The tabling move is a procedural
one, designed to take the initiative
away from the Soviets. If the United
States was to introduce the resolu
tion last night and call for an im
mediate debate, as was expected ear
lier, any other member could slow its
momentum by calling for a 24-hour
waiting period.
