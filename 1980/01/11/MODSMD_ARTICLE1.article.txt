# Assembly convenes on Afghan question
## 
### 
The Washington Post
United Nations— In language that
recalled the rhetoric of the Cold War,
the General Assembly convened the
fifth emergency session in its 34-year
history yesterday with a debate on
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Although the Soviet ambassador
here was slated to speak in defense
of his government's Afghan action,
he gave up the opportunity at the last
minute. Instead, Eastern bloc
member Poland took the initiative to
"strongly object" to a meeting called
by "reactionary elements" as a
"smoke screen to cover (their) ag
gressive designs."
Japan, Senegal, Colombia and
China spoke in favor of a resolution,
vetoed by the Soviets in the Security
Council Wednesday night, calling for
troop withdrawal.
'Global strategy'
Chinese Ambassadorto the United
Nations Chen Chu said the Soviet in
vasion was part of a "global strategy"
intent on "dominating the world."
Chen compared the Soviet move to
Hitler's invasion of Austria and
Czechoslovakia at the start of World
War 11.
On the question of Iran, the Un
ited States yesterday picked up a cru
cial ninth Security Council vote, re
portedly from Tunisia, for the impos
ition of economic sanctions.
Diplomatic sources said the U.S.
delegation was expected to submit
its sanctions resolution to the coun
cil last night or early today and ask
that it be tabled. Under U.N. rules, a
tabled resolution must be taken up
by the Security Council within 24
hours, and a council meeting pre
sumably will be held by tomorrow.
Take initiative away
The tabling move is a procedural
one, designed to take the initiative
away from the Soviets. If the United
States was to introduce the resolu
tion last night and call for an im
mediate debate, as was expected ear
lier, any other member could slow its
momentum by calling for a 24-hour
waiting period.
The United States, sources said,
now expects a Soviet veto, the re
solution for the prohibition of
all sales and supplies, except food
and medicine, to Iran by U.N. mem
bers until the 50 Americans held hos
tage in Tehran are released.
In preliminary discussions betore
the meeting officially was opened,
several Soviet bloc members ob
jected to holding it at all. They said
the Afghan situation did not meet the
prerequisite of threatening interna
tional peace necessary for such an
extraordinary session.
Once the session was opened,
new Afghan Foreign Minister Shah
Mohammad Dost repeated those ar
guments, plus points he and the
Soviet Union had made in the previ

ous Security Council debate. Dost
said the Soviet Union's "limited mis
sion" in Afghanistan was by invita
tion and was necessary to "repeal
foreign aggression and armed inter
vention" from other unnamed coun
tries.
Japanese Ambassador Masahiro
Nisibori countered that the "interna
tional community remains clearly
unconvinced of the Soviet explana
tion" for the presence of troops that
the West and much of the Third
World charge invaded Afghanistan
on Dec. 24,
The most colorful language used in
yesterday's debate, scheduled to
continue today and should last sev
eral days, was provided by Chen.
The Soviet Union's sponsorship of
the U.N. resolution last year con
demning expansionism "is like a
thief crying 'stop thief,' " Chen said.
Once the debate is over, the as
sembly is likely to pas's, by the neces
sary two-thirds majority, a condem
natory resolution similar to that vet
oed by the Soviets in the Security
Council. Since an assembly resolu
tion calling for Soviet troop with
drawal does not carry the weight of a
Security Council resolution, its sup
porters agree any victory will be a
purely moral one.
Assuming a Soviet veto of the sanc
tions resolution, however, the Un
ited States will have three remaining
options: it can do nothing about
sanctions; it could institute unilat
eral restrictions outside the United
Nations; or it could, under the same
special veto-less provision used on
the Afghan question, bring the issue
to the Special Assembly. 1
An assembly resolution on sanc
tions — which, in any case, is consi
dered unlikely to win the votes of
two-thirds of the United Nations' 152
members — would have only moral,
rather than legal, authority.

tabled resolution must be taken up
by the Security Council within 24
hours, and a council meeting pre
sumably will be held by tomorrow.
Take initiative away
The tabling move is a procedural
one, designed to take the initiative
away from the Soviets. If the United
States was to introduce the resolu
tion last night and call for an im
mediate debate, as was expected ear
lier, any other member could slow its
momentum by calling for a 24-hour
waiting period.
The United States, sources said,
now expects a Soviet veto, the re
solution for the prohibition of
all sales and supplies, except food
and medicine, to Iran by U.N. mem
bers until the 50 Americans held hos
tage in Tehran are released.
In preliminary discussions betore
the meeting officially was opened,
several Soviet bloc members ob
jected to holding it at all. They said
the Afghan situation did not meet the
prerequisite of threatening interna
tional peace necessary for such an
extraordinary session.
Once the session was opened,
new Afghan Foreign Minister Shah
Mohammad Dost repeated those ar
guments, plus points he and the
Soviet Union had made in the previ

ous Security Council debate. Dost
said the Soviet Union's "limited mis
sion" in Afghanistan was by invita
tion and was necessary to "repeal
foreign aggression and armed inter
vention" from other unnamed coun
tries.
Japanese Ambassador Masahiro
Nisibori countered that the "interna
tional community remains clearly
unconvinced of the Soviet explana
tion" for the presence of troops that
the West and much of the Third
World charge invaded Afghanistan
on Dec. 24,
The most colorful language used in
yesterday's debate, scheduled to
continue today and should last sev
eral days, was provided by Chen.
The Soviet Union's sponsorship of
the U.N. resolution last year con
demning expansionism "is like a
thief crying 'stop thief,' " Chen said.
Once the debate is over, the as
sembly is likely to pas's, by the neces
sary two-thirds majority, a condem
natory resolution similar to that vet
oed by the Soviets in the Security
Council. Since an assembly resolu
tion calling for Soviet troop with
drawal does not carry the weight of a
Security Council resolution, its sup
porters agree any victory will be a
purely moral one.
Assuming a Soviet veto of the sanc
tions resolution, however, the Un
ited States will have three remaining
options: it can do nothing about
sanctions; it could institute unilat
eral restrictions outside the United
Nations; or it could, under the same
special veto-less provision used on
the Afghan question, bring the issue
to the Special Assembly. 1
An assembly resolution on sanc
tions — which, in any case, is consi
dered unlikely to win the votes of
two-thirds of the United Nations' 152
members — would have only moral,
rather than legal, authority.
The Washington Post
United Nations— In language that
recalled the rhetoric of the Cold War,
the General Assembly convened the
fifth emergency session in its 34-year
history yesterday with a debate on
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Although the Soviet ambassador
here was slated to speak in defense
of his government's Afghan action,
he gave up the opportunity at the last
minute. Instead, Eastern bloc
member Poland took the initiative to
"strongly object" to a meeting called
by "reactionary elements" as a
"smoke screen to cover (their) ag
gressive designs."
Japan, Senegal, Colombia and
China spoke in favor of a resolution,
vetoed by the Soviets in the Security
Council Wednesday night, calling for
troop withdrawal.
'Global strategy'
Chinese Ambassadorto the United
Nations Chen Chu said the Soviet in
vasion was part of a "global strategy"
intent on "dominating the world."
Chen compared the Soviet move to
Hitler's invasion of Austria and
Czechoslovakia at the start of World
War 11.
On the question of Iran, the Un
ited States yesterday picked up a cru
cial ninth Security Council vote, re
portedly from Tunisia, for the impos
ition of economic sanctions.
Diplomatic sources said the U.S.
delegation was expected to submit
its sanctions resolution to the coun
cil last night or early today and ask
that it be tabled. Under U.N. rules, a
tabled resolution must be taken up
by the Security Council within 24
hours, and a council meeting pre
sumably will be held by tomorrow.
