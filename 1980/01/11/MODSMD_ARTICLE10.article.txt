## Afghans resist, resent Soviet troops

Kabul, Afghanistan —
"You're American," exclaimed
the middle-aged Afghan man
happily. "I'm Moslem. Mos
lems and Americans are
friends. Russians are the
enemy."
Moscow now has two
mechanized divisions of
troops dug in around the Af
ghan capital and as many as
85,000 troops in the country as
a whole, with more apparently
on the way. But as that com
ment by one Kabul resident
indicates, the Kremlin has a
long way to go before it can
hope to solidify its own politi
cal control or that of the pro-
Soviet regime it is propping up
in this mountainous, land
locked nation of 16 million.
There are many other indi
cations here that, while Mos
cow continues to virtually walk
over its military opposition, it
remains an unwelcome pre
sence in Afghanistan for most
natives.

While the Afghan capital
appears on the surface to be
solidly under Soviet control,
Soviet troops still slip quietly
into Kabul from the suburbs
each night around the 11 p.m.
curfew time to take over posi
tions guarded by Afghan sol
diers during the day.
On Tuesday, the Soviets
made their first daytime show
of military force in Kabul for
several days. They sent 26
tanks and at least 41 armored
personnel carriers through the
main streets of the city in
midafternoon. The purpose of
the move was uncertain, but it
sent Western diplomats scur
rying to their handbooks of
Soviet military hardware and
constituted what they de
scribed as a "sizeable" ar
mored movement.
Considerable numbers of
Soviet weapons surrounding
the city are trained not at the
countryside beyond, where Is
lamic Afghan rebels still con
stitute a threat, but at Afghan
military units based around
Kabul. An ambassador from a
NATO country said that on his
way to a golf course just out
side the city, he saw Soviet
machine gun emplacements
aimed at the nearby garrison
of the Bth Division of the Af
ghan army.
The Afghan rebels are not
believed to have any aircraft,
Western diplomatic sources
here said they assumed that
the weapons were insurance
against any defection of Af
ghan air force units.
Last weekend, according to
Western sources, at least three
Afghan army battalions, num
bering about 4000 troops near
the city of Jalalabad close to
the Pakistan border, defected
when the Soviet batallions
tried to disarm them. The
sources said it was still unclear
whether the Afghan defectors
remained together as a fight
ing unit or had simply dis
persed into the surrounding
countryside.

Western diplomats here said
that Afghan army strength has
been depleted by about one
third since last fall by attrition
and desertions. As a result,
they said, there are now more
Soviet than Afghan troops in
the country. In addition,
Soviet advisers reportedly are
assigned to every Afghan army
unit down to the company
•level.
Diplomatic sources here
noted that reports of Afghans
attacking Soviet troops in
Kabul continue, and that they
have confirmed at least five
such incidents in the area of
the capital city since the Dec.
27 coup.
In one such incident, two
young Soviet soldiers on day
time patrol near Khizkhana, a
suburb northwest of the city,
were set upon by a group of
young Afghan boys throwing
rocks. Two young Afghan men
joined the scuffle, beating the
Soviets to death with rocks.
Other Soviet troops meted out
quick punishment, machine
gunning to death both the two
older Afghans and 10 of the
young boys.
In a New Year's Eve ambush,
Soviet troops bivouacked near
the Rishkhor army base,
headquarters for the 7th Divi
sion of the Afghan army, were
surprised at night by Afghan
rebels who killed 20 Soviet
soldiers before escaping into
the darkness. The base is
about 15 miles south of Kabul.
"Night letters" — pamphlets
distributed around the city
after dark — have reappeared
in the last several days, calling
current leader Babrak Karmal an
anti-Islamic Russian puppet and
accusing Moscow of trying to
colonize Afghanistan.
One knowledgeable source
estimated that Moscow's
military adventure here is cost
ing it "$lO million a day
minimum," including the cost
of paying its troops, feeding
and equipping them, death

benefits for the families of
those killed in action, and
other direct costs.
On Monday, a Soviet trans
port plane crashed at Kabul
airport, reportedly killing its
crew of three when its cargo of
ammunition blew up. A huge
tent city at the northeast end
of the airport is one of six
major Soviet encampments
around the capital. At least
nine Soviet transport aircraft,
as well as 26 military helicop
ers, tanks, trucks, artillery and
other military hardware were
clearly visible there Tuesday.
Some diplomatic sources
here put the current Soviet
troop concentration in Af
ghanistan at about 60,000 men,
compared with the latest U.S.
estimate of 85,000. However,
all here agree that the buildup
is continuing, particularly in
the western part of the coun
try near the Iranian border
"The existing Soviet troops
are sufficient to maintain con
trol of the country," com
mented one well-informed
source here. "So the continu
ing buildup is very ominous."
This source suggested that it is
a sign that Moscow has inten
tions beyond propping up
what had appeared to be a
struggling socialist ally. "By
being here they have military
options up their sleeve in
Iran," this source said. "In my
personal opinion, that's
reason number one."
Other sources here expres
sed similar concern about the
continuing Soviet buildup, al
though they interpreted it as a
confirmation of earlier suspi
cions that the Kremlin may
take on the major military role
in suppressing the Afghan re
bels. The Soviets have insisted
that their military presence
here is only to secure Af
ghanistan's borders and its
lines of communication — not
to fight rebels unless Soviet
soldiers are attacked first.
