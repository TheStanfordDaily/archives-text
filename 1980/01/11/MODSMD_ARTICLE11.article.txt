# Deutsche mark rise worries West Germans

The Washington Post
Bonn, West Germany — While America
mourns the decline of the dollar, West
Germany publicly frets over the rise of the
Deutsche mark — which recalls the old
saying that money never seems to make
anyone happy.
Here the cause for concern is the in
creasing world demand — by Africans,
Iranians, even the U.S. Treasury Depart
ment — to invest in and get paid in marks.
German officials complain that strong
foreign calls for their currency is making it
more difficult to manage the West Ger
man economy.
Not that any of this actually bothers the
average West German, who finds in the
stunning appreciation of the mark a cer
tain sense of pride.
Nor, for that matter , is there as much
griping as one might expect among West
German exporters, whose goods have
been made more expensive in foreign
markets due to the stronger mark. Except

for a few selected industries — most not
ably, shipbuilding — German export
trade is as vigorous as ever.
Rather, the worry beads belong to Bonn
government officials and Frankfurt central
bankers who see the deutsche mark
being held increasingly by foreign gov
ernments in reserve accounts and doubt
the West German economy is big enough
to sustain the pressures that come with
being a worldwide reserve currency.
For West Germany, which is three times
more dependent on foreign trade than
America, the chance for such instability is
all the greater.
Bonn has thus tried hard to discourage
diversification into marks. It has foiled
some speculators by banning foreign in
vestors from the short-term bond market.
At the same time, the government has
refused to issue floating-rate notes.
Stronger measures have been con
templated but appear unlikely. "We
would not advocate restriction in capital

movements," said one Bonn official.
Interest in the mark as an investment
opportunity was also somewhat diverted
in recent months by the rush for gold.
Moreover, concern here over potential
prohlems found some relief in the fact
that West Germany, for the first time
since 1965, registered a current account
deficit last year. A deficit country can tol
erate capital imports better than a surplus
country.
The U.S. dollar still accounts for about
80 percent of world official reserves and
more than half of the currency used in
world trade, according to the Bundes
bank. German monetary officials say
there is no alternative to the dollar and
express the hope it will return to what
they call it "natural" function as a key
currency of the Western world.
But until that happens, the Bun
desbank seems destined to pay for its
domestic monetary restraint with a
gradual erosion of its grip on the mark.
