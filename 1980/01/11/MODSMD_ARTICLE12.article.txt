How was your first academic week of the new
decade? I've gone through 30 units of classes
already in order to find 15 units I can be happy
with. I hope this is no indication of what the
next ten years has in store for me.
> Ah well, I suppose you want to know what
peculiar questions or problems have arisen in
the past month around Stanford. Here's a par
ticularly timely question:
' ' - For Bug Me:
At the approach to the Quad there is an ugly
Unkempt area referred to as the Oval. The last
■ time I can remember it looking somewhat pre
' 'sentable was the year it snowed and someone
' drew a large "S" in the snow. Are there any plans
for doing anything with this area? I would think a
nice English country garden would be approp
riate, complete with sculptured hedges, classical
' statues and fountains.
* Horatio (Cliveden, 1978)
1 • That vision is certainly nice, but "approp
riate?" In any event, the Oval is about to get
a facelift. Campus Planner Max Mazenko says
that plans have just been finished for a recon
struction of that area.
The Oval will remain essentially unchanged
as far as the actual design is concerned,
Mazenko says. But replacing the weeds and
unkempt grass will be a flower garden with
paths through it. The irrigation will be redone,
and new grass will be put in.
The reason the Oval has been left in its pre
sent state of disarray, Mazenko said, is because
aesthetic projects have lower priority than their
academic counterparts. The funding for this
project wasn't even solicited by the University.
It was a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Boyd Smith. Mr.
Smith, who is now a private consultant, is a
former Universitv staff member.
Dear Bug Me:
What's the deal with parking tickets on campusi
I live off campus and I never bothered to get a
sticker because it didn't seem to be worth 75
bucks. Well, last quarter I scored five of those
babies and if I continue at this rate I may win the
competition with my roommates; but I'll be set
back a fortune if I ever have to pay. I've heard

rumors about not being able to renew my
driver's license, or being arrested if I'm ever pul
led over. What really can, and will, they do? Also
where does the money from those who pay for
their tickets go? Is the county of Santa Clara
getting rich off students who are forced (or
choose) to commute?
Off Campus Ticket Collector
First of all, "collector" is correct about the
possible consequences of storing up parking
tickets. Lt. Marvin Moore of Police Services said
that nonpayers won't be able to renew their
licenses or register their vehicles with the DMV.
Also, if a person is identified as a consistent
violator, the police may run a check for all out
standing citations in that name, and a warrant
will be issued by the court for that person.
If such a violator were stopped at any time in
California by a police officer, he would be
arrested. If the unpaid tab is really significant,
an officer might deliver the warrant to the vio
lator at home, work or school! Obviously, the
Police Department can't chase down every per
son who throws away a $2 ticket. And, according
to Moore, an out-of-state student has a better
chance of getting away without paying. "After
all," he said, "nobody's going to go through
extradition for parking tickets." But if they are
stopped in California, or they have a known
address, the long arm of the law may grab them.
Money from parking tickets on campus goes
to the County of Santa Clara, not Palo Alto or
Stanford. In fact, the University has no connec
tion at all with enforcement or collection of
parking fines. So no hold will be put on a vio
lator's transcript or diploma. (But you'd better
return those library books!)
Finally, "Collector" should be aware that all
students, including those living on campus, are
required to purchase parking permits, as are all
faculty and staff who wish to park their au
tomobiles on campus. It's not just commuters.
That's all the room I've got for today, so if
you're eager to find out about the Goodyear
Blimp or the Forsythe Computing Center, you'll
have to tune in next week. And if there's any
thing else, drop me a line. I'm Bug Me, c/o The
