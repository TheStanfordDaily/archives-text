# 'Ballroom' strives for club atmosphere
## Tresidder: new spot for concerts? 
### David Frank 
Instead of shivering over
the books this winter quar
ter, students might look
forward to some
heartwarming concerts in
Stanford's answer to the
Old Waldorf club in San
Francisco: "the Tresidder
Ballroom."
For tonight's Spyro Cyra
concert, the upstairs main
room will be redesigned to
accommodate 350 seats in
what ASSU Director of Spe
cial Events John Harris calls
an effort to create "an inti
mate, club-like atmos
phere."
Harris said the new con
cert facility will allow stu
dents to see musicians at a
low cost. He also said that
the ballroom will serve as a
"magnet" for groups that
pass through the Bay Area
and want to play for small
audiences.
Compared to the cost of
having concerts in build
ings such as Memorial Au
ditorium and Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, the cost of
using the ballroom is quite
inexpensive, Harris said,
because Tresidder Union is
the University's community

center.
As a result, ticket re
venue — which goes to pay
for building rental and
other concert costs — need
not be as high with con
certs in Tresidder as it is in
other campus facilities; this
means lower ticket prices,
Harris said. Tickets will be
"at least one dollar cheaper
than what one would pay in
a club in the City like the
Old Waldorf," Harris said.
Special Events, he added,
"is just trying to break
even. Our main concern is
not profit, but bringing
high quality entertainment
to campus."
Past attempts to create

club-like settings here have
not worked well, Harris
noted. Last year a few
groups played in Encina
Station. Musicians com
plained of poor acoustics,
while audiences grumbled
about the cramped quar
ters. Both problems will be
eliminated in the ballroom.
"Every seat will be a good
seat, and the ballroom's
acoustics are superior to
those in the Station," he
promised.
The logistics of convert
ing the ballroom to a con
cert club are simple. "No
construction or major re
modeling will be involved,"
Harris said. Special Events

will borrow the stage from
Dinkelspiel, and seats will
be taken from those in
storage around campus.
The Individual Lights Pro
ject, a student group, will
coordinate lighting ser
vices. The only outside ser
vice will come from Sound
On Stage, whom Special
Events contracted to handle
the sound. Conversion will
begin this morning.
Harris noted the flexibil
ity the ballroom gives Spe
cial Events in scheduling
concerts — even for grbups
that draw large audiences.
Spyro Cyra, presently a
popular jazz group, will
play two concerts tonight in
the 350-seat room.
Harris said that refresh
ments would be served dur
ing the concert, but that
there would not be any al
cohol.
In the coming weeks, the
following jazz musicians
will play at the ballroom:
)oe Pass, )an. 27; Ramsey
Lewis, Feb. 10; Yusef
Lateef, Feb. 17. Harris also
mentioned the possibility
of holding some dances
with new wave-reggae
bands later on in the year.
