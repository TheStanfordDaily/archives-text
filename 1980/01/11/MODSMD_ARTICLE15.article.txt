# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS
## Stan Young Pity the fuzzy study major 
### 
I chanced recently to converse with the
speech instructor at a community college. After
introducing myself to her as a prospective his
tory major, I watched as her lip curled slightly
and listened as she spat, "History is a luxury for
the rich\. I was an undergraduate history major;
that and forty cents will get you a cup of cof
fee."
Liberal studies have sustained many similar
charges of irrelevance in recent years. We hear
scare stories about humanities graduates bus
ing dishes in restaurants for lack of occupa
tional alternatives.
Relatives blanch when I describe my
academic plans, their composure recovering
only slightly when I quickly add that I think I
want to go to law school. My parents ask
whether I can find something more "useful,"
and my sister giggles at the latest exploits of her
hare-brained brother.
Somehow, the vaunted advantages of an
education in the humanities often get lost in
the shuffle of economic ways and means. Cer
tainly, philosophy, history, literature and art
are "nice'' fields of study. Certainly, it is good
to explore the full range of human experience,
to comprehend the complex grandeur of
human hope and failure.
However, verbose platitudes fail to convince
most people that a student working on a de
gree in classics is contributing as much to the
betterment of mankind as one advancing to
ward a degree in biology. While one politely
tolerates a philologist, one offers supplication
to a physician.
Students anticipating the stark terrors of "the
real world" maintain these values themselves.
Ihe Stanford student body comprises a rep
resentative sample of the American uppe"r

crust, and society here can be heartless to
those who fail to conform to the prevailing
ethic.
Majoring in "Modern Thought and Litera
ture" is almost as bad as having body odor. (At
the very least, mentioning it is enough to kill
the liveliest party conversation.) "Harmonious
unified sensibilities" take a back seat to "Start
ing Salary: $22,275."
I suspect that my sensitivity to this question is
a reflection of my own circumstances. I live, so
to speak, "in the sticks," and somehow the fact
that my bookshelves contain Aeschylus,
Shakespeare, Macaulay and Locke clashes vio
lently with what I know to be the concerns of
the vast majority of my fellow townspeople. I
have come, by and large, to resign myself to
this incongruity, which now only occasionally
surfaces to bother me.
Nevertheless, when they do arise, doubts
about the worth of my intended academic fu
ture are painful. Due, no doubt, to the diaboli
cal designs of "Res Ed," I have roomed for two
consecutive years with hard science majors,
both of whom have caused me to realize with
horror the relative unmarketability of the trans
cript with which I will leave Stanford.
I have also noticed, with considerable ap
prehension, that this campus literally crawls
with students whose academic careers are
explicitly intended to prepare them for
technological occupations.
I pledge myself, against all odds, to carry on
with my plans. However, I suppose that if the
doubt and pain ever exceed my capacity to
persevere, I could always commit what to me
has long been an unthinkable act: I could de
clare an engineering major.
