## What kind of future is R&D shaping? 
### 
Few things will shape future
events more than current sci
entific research and develop
ment. Since the Renaissance
we in the western world have
increasingly put our faith in
the "scientific method" as Our
Deliverer, and now more than
ever we're holding our breath
that science can pull us out of
our complex global problems.
Though I consider this
heavy reliance on scientific re
search a grave error, I hear

from many people around me
cries of "Help me, Mr.
Wizard!" The world awaits a
timely "Trizzle-trazzle,
trazzle-trum, time for this one
to come home" to emanate
from some research laborat
ory.

. . . one shocking fact is clear:
military programs use up approximately
one-fourth of the world's research and
development funds . . .

This dependence is proba
bly best underscored by the
fact that $150 billion last year
was spent worldwide on scien
tific research and develop
ment (R&D). Governments
and corporations operate high
powered R&D systems that re
quire tremendous monetary
investments as well as vast
amounts of manpower in the
form of some of the world's
ablest minds. Obviously, R&D
is big business.
But just what are the world's
R&D systems researching and
developing! 1 What is it that the
hope of western man is offer
ing us to alleviate our difficul
ties?
Though it is difficult to know
precisely where all the R&D
money and talent is going (be
cause of governmental and
commercial secrecy), one
shocking fact is clear: military
programs use up approxi
mately one-fourth of the
world's research and de
velopment funds. It is thought
that over half a million scien
tists and engineers are work
ing worldwide to develop new
weapons. Perhaps most dis-

turbing, military programs use
more R&D funds than do
programs related to health,
energy, food production and
environmental protection put
together, according to
Worldwatch Institute of
Washington.

This imbalance is deeply
troubling to me. It reveals a
fundamental truth about all of
us: we have our faith not in
science, but in death.
Our problems will be solved
at the end of a sword, albeit a
technologically advanced one.
Our priorities, as evidenced
by these R&D programs, are
grossly askew.
We can make much of the
earth's surface uninhabitable,
yet we have scarcely begun
trying to make the world's
slums inhabitable.
Our intelligence operations
can survey every inch of
foreign lands, yet scientists
have barely begun to survey
the ecological conditions in
Africa that have led to creep

.. . protecting ... people from devastating
malnutrition seems beyond our abilities . . .

ing deserts and famine.
We can collectively mobilize
much of the world's able
population for war, yet pro
tecting these same people
from devastating malnutrition
seems beyond our abilities.

Even energy, our current
problem child, takes a back
seat to military spending. This
even though many recognize
that the development of safe
and secure energy resources is
more important to the survival
of most countries than is more
advanced weaponry.
Fortunately, there has been
of late (especially in the Un
ited States) a slight trend to
ward spending more money
on socially beneficial goals. It
is true that the energy prob
lem has prompted much of
this switch, but any change is
welcome. In particular, new
governmental pollution con
trol and fuel-efficiency stan
dards have caused a great in
flux of R&D funds into energy
conservation and environmen
tal protection programs.
As I mentioned earlier, re
search and development — no
matter how well directed —
cannot by itself solve our so
cial difficulties. But a change
in R&D priorities is crucial if
we are to have a chance to
deal with our global problems.
Change can occur only if
people demand that govern
ment and industry redirect
their research funds away
from military objectives. We
really have no alternative, for
as the author of Proverbs

wrote thousands of years ago,
"So are the ways of everyone
who gains by violence; it takes
away the life of its posses
sors."
