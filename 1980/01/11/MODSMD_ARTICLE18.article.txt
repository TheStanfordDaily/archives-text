Realism needed
There is now widespread be
lief that we have turned a
corner in our national affairs,
emerging from our post-
Vietnam hesitancy with new
resolve and a willingness on
the part of the vast majority ot
Americans to consider military
options. As one who has long
felt, and said publicly, that we
needed more of that realism
internationally, I'd like to add
this at the trouble
some juncture:
International relations may

not be entirely in the "state of
nature" Spinoza spoke of, but
they are clearly so for the
Ayatollah Khomeini and his
followers and many others
around the globe. Hence they
call for a different mix ot the
humane dimension and that ot
cold realism than does the
local or national domain.
Our alliance with the shah
has to be viewed in that spe
cial light. This too is being in
creasingly acknowledged
around the country, and there
will be changes in our policy
of "moralism."

It is becoming apparent that
we need the whole range of
human virtues in order to sur
vive, including courage, pat
riotism and the like. Just hav
ing a nuclear shield and in
dulging in laid-back living
won't do it. We need strong
ground torces and probably
some form ot draft. Our vol
unteer army is very weak.
We may — if only as a re
mote possibility — have to go
in at some point to try to re
scue the hostages if all else
tails. We can't just let them sit
there bound to chairs for
years.
II that happens, it oughtn't
be a "push-button" attack, by
naval or aerial bombardment,
alone but a full human re
sponse involving foot troops
as well.
That rounded humanity,
rooted in our more authentic
past, is what we have to regain
after an era of incredible es
cape from reality and respon
sibility.

Spay! Neuter!
Right now in midwinter is the
critical time for unaltered cats.
Thanks to Nature, midwinter is
the big mating season when
males rove and maraud,
females get pregnant, and
both sexes yowl.
Death is often the result as
males are wounded in fights or
run down in traffic. Pregnant
temales wind up unwanted at
the animal shelter.
The cats can't help it, but
their owners can: NEUTER the
males, SPAY the females. It

would be a saintly kindness if
someone would arrange the
•operation for cats living wild
as some do on the campus.
Some owners may not
realize that kittens aoopted
last spring are now mature
cats. Females are ready for the
operation at six months and
males at around seven —
sometimes earlier. Unless al
tered now, they will mate and
produce kittens in March or
April.
Sad as it is to see a roving
young torn injured or mashed
on the street, it is even worse

to visit the shelter and see a
mother cat nursing kittens
eager to live but in all proba
bility doomed to be "put to
sleep" because she and they
are surplus. All this can be
prevented, inexpensively.
Now is the time to act. Vet
erinary hospitals and spay
neuter clinics are available.
There are organizations ready
to help with the cost if owners
are strapped. Females already
pregnant can have abortions.
