# Professors speculate on Soviet motives
## Attack runs counter to usual Russian policy 
### Victor Goetz (First of a series) 
The recent and continuing invasion of Afghanis
tan by Soviet troops represents a serious shift in
Soviet policy, according to international relations
scholars here.
"It's really the first time the Soviets have actually
used troops outside the Warsaw Pact," said His
tory Prof. Alexander Dallin, an expert in Russian
studies.
"In every other case, they've used the Cubans or
supplied arms or military advisers, things the Un
ited States has done, too."
Several faculty members attempted to look
beyond the obvious events of this sudden incur
sion to explain the underlying Soviet motivation,
an exploration often ignored by U.S. policymakers
in their involvement with this nation's concerns.

News analysis

"It is sometimes a good exercise to look at a
situation from the other point of view," said As
soc. Prof. David Kennedy, director of the interna
tional relations program.
Political Science Prof. Robert Keohane cited two
different interpretations of Soviet reasoning, both
of which, he said, could be partially true.
First, the Russian maneuver could be a "funda
mentally reactive, prudent strategy to try to keep
friendly regimes on borders," he said. On the
other hand, "it is also possible that the Soviets
launched the coup in Afghanistan to intimidate
Pakistan or Iran."
Kennedy subscribed to the first short-term view.
Armed intervention in Afghanistan, from the
Soviet point of view, is a justified move to protect
Russia from the threat of political instability along
its own border, he explained.
"Afghanistan was a target of opportunity," ag
reed Dallin. "I don't think there was a master plan
in Moscow.
, Encirclement
"Some of us have been saying that the Soviets
have been facing an encirclement, as they see it,
by the NATO nations to the west and )apan, China
and the U.S. in the east," said Dallin. "There's
bound to be an attempt to break out."
Certain types of actions generate encirclement,
explained Koehane. "When you display belliger
ence toward neighbors it tends to turn neighbors
unfriendly toward you."
Dallin further mentioned that the resurgence of
Moslem feelings may have contributed to the Rus
sian move. "Tension was building between the
radical left and the Moslem right," he said.
"I think the Soviets found themselves in a rather

desperate situation in Afghanistan, attempting to
control these regions. They were faced with a situ
ation that a pro-Soviet regime would collapse,"
said Political Science Prof. Alexander George.
"I don't think sending their own troops was an
easy decision for them to make," he said.
Moreover, according to Dallin, "there isn't
another area where (the Soviets) could repeat the
(Afghanistan) incident right now. (The U.S. has)
treaty commitments to Pakistan, and Iran is much
too sensitive," he added.
"It would be highly adventurous to make
another move in that region," said Kennedy. "Rut,
if they did, then you're really talking about a seri
ous situation."
Refuge

Franklin Weinstein said he could envision
Keohane's latter, long-range case. There is a
chance that the Soviets may go on to attack Pakis
tan because it is a refuge for Afghani rebels, he
said.
"It is easy to see the refugee argument, that the
Russians have the right to go in and 'clean out' the
guerrillas attacking from across the border," he
explained.
As Keohane said, "It's quite conceivable that
they (the Russian considerations) both played a
role in the influx into Afghanistan.
The Soviets might be in pursuit of far-ranging
goals. Indeed, the Russians may be finally trying to
break open the access they have long been seek
ing to the Indian Ocean, as well as an important
connection to the Middle East, Dallin said.
Such an eventuality "may be an ultimate con
cern, but it doesn't seem to be dominant inspira
tion,'' said Assoc. Prof, of History Barton Berns
tein.
That master plan is the jackpot, said Ken
nedy. "You can only say time will tell. We've seen
repeated efforts to get control in that region â€”
Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia. I kind of hate to
contemplate the implications of a 'yes' answer to
the question of whether this is just a first step," he
added.
"This comes down to what you view as the pur
pose of Soviet foreign policy."
Whatever their quest, whether or not the
Soviets will succeed remains a popular source of
speculation.
The Soviets must have weighed the potential
costs and benefits of their action before embark
ing upon their chosen course. "Certainly, in
foreign policy governments make tradeoffs,"
Koehane commented. "Sometimes one thing has
to take precedence over others."

"They (the Russians) quite clearly must have cal
culated that they have gained. Psychologically,
they may have lost world opinion, but they have
made very tangible gains," said Kennedy.
Yet, the Russians have never held the opinions
of other nations in very high esteem, Dallin said,
and, clearly, in this situation they risked turning
world opinion strongly against them.
"The Russians have always opted for control,
over the good will of other nations. I guess they
reason that you can't count on good will anyway,"
he said.
Of course, the Soviet actions had intimidation
potential, pointing out to Third World nations that
the U.S. could not do anything and was once again
weak and powerless, George said. Still, that
same assertion may have the opposite effect,
drawing moderate Arabs toward the U.S. and away
from the Soviet Union, he continued.
"One problem the Russians have with their
military power is that, if they try to make blackmail
threats, they may shock nations into galvanizing
against the Soviets," he added.
At the same time, the Soviets may be setting a
dangerous precedent that, if a pro-Soviet govern
ment in some country begins to fail, the Russians
will use their own force to keep it in power,
George said. "This is something new, and Arab
nations, Third World nations, should beworried."
Logically, the Soviet efforts to squelch Moslem
rebels should awaken Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini in Iran, too, according to George, who
turther suggested that the ayatollah may find it in
his best interests toclean his hands of the hostages
in order to better face the real threat on his coun
try's border.
Misunderstanding of U.S.
In terms of continuing associations with the Un
ited States, the Soviets may have gravely erred in
estimation.
"They (the Russians) will have gained control of
a country with marginal strategic importance. The
price they have to pay is relations with the U.S.,
which, I think, given the current mood, is quite
substantial," Dallin said. "In this way they may
have miscalculated the costs."
The Russian thinking must have been that they
had nothing to lose anyway. "The Soviets have
become quite sour on detente, so that I guess the
argument in Moscow must have been 'so what can
the U.S. do?'said Dallin.'
Some difference of opinion may result in Mos
cow from the somewhat unexpected U.S. reac
tion. "There will be some in Moscow who will say
that the relationship was not so good anyway,"
Dallin said. "There will be others who will regret
the losses.''
