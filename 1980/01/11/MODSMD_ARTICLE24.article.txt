# ON CALL

### Dianne Cahoon 
Welcome back to the excitement of edu
cation. Hopefully, your books have weath
ered the tedium of disuse and disregard.
On Call has at last joyously received a
scant supply of feedback trom the apathetic
masses, so this decade may indeed hold a
smattering of promise. Life might yet be a
worthwhile experience.
Let you forget your holiday boredom
and/or blasphemy, read on.
My supposedly lun-tillcd vacation turned
into a nightmare. While everyone else
seemed to be consumed by idyllic or al
coholic bliss, I was beset by an overriding
teeling of bleak and inescapable depression.
I survived the days by burying myselt in a
fantasy world tic tion and sleep around the
clock. Upon returning to Stanford, I con
fronted more guilt and frustrated disap
pointment when I heard about all the great
times others had that I seemingly missed Is
something drastically wrong with me? Am I a

According to the counselors at Counsel
ing and Psychological Services (CAPS), the
holiday and post-holiday blues are not tin
common among college students. You
might be somewhat consoled by the news
that you were undoubtedly not the only per
son whose bursting bubble was not just New
Year's Eve champagne.
Holiday anxiety can be attributed to a wide
variety of sources, most of which center
upon unfulfilled expectations.
In the sage and overworked words of
Thomas Wolfe, "You can't go home again."
Yet, many students mistakenly believe that

thoir family lives and their assessment of
those patterns will not have changed during
their educational interludes.
Such sentiment is often embodied in a
tendency to regress to an immature seeking
of nurture and dependence. When such
students lac e the harsh realization that it is
impossible to re-experience the childish de
light in holiday gilts and ornaments in which
they may have once revelled, they become
despondent.
Inevitably, the types of presents and
amount of attention that one receives will
modify with time, and it is natural to be
nostalgic when that occurs. It is, however,
important to abandon the wanton nature of
childhood and accept the responsibilities of
adulthood.
Others may readily grasp and enjoy the
independence of college and, thus, resent
the imposition of parental authority or dot
ing manner at home. Sue h students may find
their homes and families lacking in the cul
ture and ideas they have gained.
But, the belief that parental behavior can
be molded to align with the student's new
found knowledge and lifestyle is a myth.
Your parents will probably not change and
may even feel threatened by your changes.
Such values conflicts simply require time,
patience and tolerance tor resolution. An
eventual balance is attainable.
As Mark Twain related, "When I was a boy
of 14, my father was so ignorant I could
hardly stand to have the old man around.
But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at
how much he had learned in seven years."
Until next week, keep those noses to the
grindstone. Rousing mischief will resume
