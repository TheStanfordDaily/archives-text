# Green goes East

Shovels first bit into the dirt
35 months ago when ground
for the new Cecil H. Green
Library was broken and con
struction began. "The
shovel-wielders, even so
energetic a pair as Cecil and
Ida Green, will not be ex
pected to contribute signific
antly to the size of the excava
tion," said President Richard
Lyman, who battled both rain
and the loud bells of the
nearby Hoover Tower carillon
to speak at the ceremony. The
Greens made the largest dona
tion — $6 million — for the
new structure.
That stormy day set the
stage for two major floods and
shelving delivery problems
that were to delay the opening
of the new Green Library addi
tion by a year. Although the
basement and first two floors
opened Monday to users with
a Stanford ID, the third floor
may not be completed until
the end of February because
of late deliveries from the
snowbound East Coast.
As early as 1964 it was prop
osed that new space be found
for a University book collec
tion now growing at more than
130,000 volumes a year. In
November 1976 the University
Board of Trustees approved
plans for the $9.5 million
buff-colored concrete struc
ture known as the East Wing.
When fully completed by
Dickman Construction, it will
house nearly half of Green
Library's 2.7 million volumes.
Furnishings and moving ex
penses bring the total cost of
the new addition plus the im
provements planned for the
original building to $17.6 mill
ion.
Five hundred study carrels
are located around the
periphery of each floor near
the bronze-tinted windows.
The carrels are lit by fluores
cent tubes and the bright light
of mercury vapor lamps re

flecting oft the ceiling. Lounge
chairs and table seating also
provide abundant student sea
ting.
Several hundred private
rooms serve as studies for fa
culty and doctoral candidates.
The offices of Director of Lib
raries David Weber are on a
section of the second floor fac
ing the new brick-laid library
quadrangle.
Funds for the East Wing
were provided largely by
donors, including the James
Irvine Foundation, the Kresge
Foundation and the Lurie
Foundation. Also contributing
was Walter Haas, former
chairman of the board of
Levi-Strauss. But the Greens,
friends of former President
Wallace Sterling and Provost
Frederick Terrnan, made the
largest donation.
Cecil Green, co-founder of
Texas Instruments, and Ida
Green, of Southern
Methodist University, are not
Stanford graduates but lived in
Palo Alto from 1928 to 1930.
Here they met Stanford alum
nus Charles Litton who later
gave his name to Litton Indus
tries. Green graduated from
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, whose president
had recommended to Leland
Stanford the M.I.T. architect
who designed the original
Quadrangle. Such "interesting
coincidences," explained
Green, might explain "why we
have felt extra affinity for Stan
ford."
The couple's other gifts to
the University include en
dowment of two graduate fel
lowships in geophysics and
funding for completion of the
School of Earth Sciences Ruth
Wattis Mitchell Building.
A conference room in the
new addition has been named
for Ida Green.
Director Weber called the
early plans of the architectural
tirm of Hellmuth, Obata and
Kassabaum "an uncommonly



Daily photos by lames Higa

inviting design. Tasteful and
sensitive to functional needs,
the building will represent ar
chitectural innovation at Stan
ford even as it harmonizes
with traditional architectural
forms on campus."
Chrome-plated handrails
and a cardinal-red stairway
wind through a stairwell lined
in maple paneling where a
tapestry by Helena Hernmark
of New York will hang. The
paneling and carpeting were
replaced after a June 1979
flood caused $250,000 in dam
ages when an overheated fire
sprinkler began to operate.
Major services, including
card catalogs, loan desk and
information are on the main
floor.
I he lower level houses
newspapers and current
periodicals and features a
skylight in the study area. A
doorway leads to the adjacent
Meyer Basement, now called
the South Stack, and replaces
the old outdoor entrance. A
November 1978 flood near the
new connection soaked 50,000
books causing more than $1
million damage when a fire
main broke.
Telephones, copiers, loc
kers and sound-proof typing
rooms are located throughout
the building and carpeting var
ies from purple and royal blue
to cardinal. The 131,000 square
feet of floor space has dou
bled the area of Green l ibrary.
New entrances from the Main
Library, now the West Wing,
are available on the first and
third floors, and outer doors
face Galvez Mall and Meyer
Library.
Lhe top level has windows
that open to make it easier to
wash. Windows in
the rest of the building are
permanently closed to prevent
book theft and to control dust.
Three humidity gauges are
located on every floor. Con
stant control of the environ
ment, including the tempera-

ture, will prolong the life of
library materials. Other mea
sures include locating shelving
away from the damaging ef
fects of sunlight near the win
dows.
Late delivery of super-strong
shelving, custom-built and de
signed to meet California's
earthquake code, was a prin
cipal cause of delay in opening
the addition. "The structural
engineers specified shelving
with seismic requirements,"
said former Building Projects
Manager Philip Leighton,
"which no shelving manufac
turer had ever met before."
The Estey Company of San
Jose believed it could meet lhe
requirements but later disco
vered the project would in
quire complete retooling of its
shop. Rather than sue for
breach of contract, the Uni
versity decided to stay with
Estey because reopening bids
might cost "hundreds of
thousands of dollars," accord
ing to Leighton.
The shelving finally began
arriving last November and
another shipment is expected
next week. Original plans cal
led tor dark red shelving, but
lhe manufacturer could only
supply black.
Within a year, $2 million
worth of renovation to the
original 61-year-old library
should be completed. Con
tract negotiations are still
going on. Plans call for renova
tion of the rotunda and read
ing room and sections of the
former slacks to provide room
for government documents,
offices and study carrels.
Three acres of landscaped
grounds with trees, shrubs
and benches now surround
the complex — located on the
site of a former parking lot. A
fountain planned for the brie k
quadrangle will only be built if
a donor is found.
A formal dedication cere
mony is planned for April 11.

Late delivery of super-strong
shelving, custom-built and de
signed to meet California's
earthquake code, was a prin
cipal cause of delay in opening
the addition. "The structural
engineers specified shelving
with seismic requirements,"
said former Building Projects
Manager Philip Leighton,
"which no shelving manufac
turer had ever met before."
The Estey Company of San
Jose believed it could meet lhe
requirements but later disco
vered the project would in
quire complete retooling of its
shop. Rather than sue for
breach of contract, the Uni
versity decided to stay with
Estey because reopening bids
might cost "hundreds of
thousands of dollars," accord
ing to Leighton.

arriving last November and
another shipment is expected
next week. Original plans cal
led tor dark red shelving, but

Within a year, $2 million

Shovels first bit into the dirt
35 months ago when ground
for the new Cecil H. Green
Library was broken and con
struction began. "The
shovel-wielders, even so
energetic a pair as Cecil and
Ida Green, will not be ex
pected to contribute signific
antly to the size of the excava
tion," said President Richard
Lyman, who battled both rain
and the loud bells of the
nearby Hoover Tower carillon
to speak at the ceremony. The
Greens made the largest dona
tion — $6 million — for the
new structure.
That stormy day set the
stage for two major floods and
shelving delivery problems
that were to delay the opening
of the new Green Library addi
tion by a year. Although the
basement and first two floors
opened Monday to users with
a Stanford ID, the third floor
may not be completed until
the end of February because
of late deliveries from the
snowbound East Coast.
As early as 1964 it was prop
osed that new space be found
for a University book collec
tion now growing at more than
130,000 volumes a year. In
November 1976 the University
Board of Trustees approved
plans for the $9.5 million
buff-colored concrete struc
ture known as the East Wing.
When fully completed by
Dickman Construction, it will
house nearly half of Green
Library's 2.7 million volumes.
Furnishings and moving ex
penses bring the total cost of
the new addition plus the im
provements planned for the
original building to $17.6 mill
ion.
Five hundred study carrels
are located around the
periphery of each floor near
the bronze-tinted windows.
The carrels are lit by fluores
cent tubes and the bright light
of mercury vapor lamps re

flecting oft the ceiling. Lounge
chairs and table seating also
provide abundant student sea
ting.
Several hundred private
rooms serve as studies for fa
culty and doctoral candidates.
The offices of Director of Lib
raries David Weber are on a
section of the second floor fac
ing the new brick-laid library
quadrangle.
Funds for the East Wing
were provided largely by
donors, including the James
Irvine Foundation, the Kresge
Foundation and the Lurie
Foundation. Also contributing
was Walter Haas, former
chairman of the board of
Levi-Strauss. But the Greens,
friends of former President
Wallace Sterling and Provost
Frederick Terrnan, made the
largest donation.
Cecil Green, co-founder of
Texas Instruments, and Ida
Green, of Southern
Methodist University, are not
Stanford graduates but lived in
Palo Alto from 1928 to 1930.
Here they met Stanford alum
nus Charles Litton who later
gave his name to Litton Indus
tries. Green graduated from
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, whose president
had recommended to Leland
Stanford the M.I.T. architect
who designed the original
Quadrangle. Such "interesting
coincidences," explained
Green, might explain "why we
have felt extra affinity for Stan
ford."
The couple's other gifts to
the University include en
dowment of two graduate fel
lowships in geophysics and
funding for completion of the
School of Earth Sciences Ruth
Wattis Mitchell Building.

new addition has been named
for Ida Green.
