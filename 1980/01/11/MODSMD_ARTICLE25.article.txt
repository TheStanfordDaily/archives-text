# Green goes East

Shovels first bit into the dirt
35 months ago when ground
for the new Cecil H. Green
Library was broken and con
struction began. "The
shovel-wielders, even so
energetic a pair as Cecil and
Ida Green, will not be ex
pected to contribute signific
antly to the size of the excava
tion," said President Richard
Lyman, who battled both rain
and the loud bells of the
nearby Hoover Tower carillon
to speak at the ceremony. The
Greens made the largest dona
tion — $6 million — for the
new structure.
That stormy day set the
stage for two major floods and
shelving delivery problems
that were to delay the opening
of the new Green Library addi
tion by a year. Although the
basement and first two floors
opened Monday to users with
a Stanford ID, the third floor
may not be completed until
the end of February because
of late deliveries from the
snowbound East Coast.
As early as 1964 it was prop
osed that new space be found
for a University book collec
tion now growing at more than
130,000 volumes a year. In
November 1976 the University
Board of Trustees approved
plans for the $9.5 million
buff-colored concrete struc
ture known as the East Wing.
When fully completed by
Dickman Construction, it will
house nearly half of Green
Library's 2.7 million volumes.
Furnishings and moving ex
penses bring the total cost of
the new addition plus the im
provements planned for the
original building to $17.6 mill
ion.
Five hundred study carrels
are located around the
periphery of each floor near
the bronze-tinted windows.
The carrels are lit by fluores
cent tubes and the bright light
of mercury vapor lamps re

flecting oft the ceiling. Lounge
chairs and table seating also
provide abundant student sea
ting.
Several hundred private
rooms serve as studies for fa
culty and doctoral candidates.
The offices of Director of Lib
raries David Weber are on a
section of the second floor fac
ing the new brick-laid library
quadrangle.
Funds for the East Wing
were provided largely by
donors, including the James
Irvine Foundation, the Kresge
Foundation and the Lurie
Foundation. Also contributing
was Walter Haas, former
chairman of the board of
Levi-Strauss. But the Greens,
friends of former President
Wallace Sterling and Provost
Frederick Terrnan, made the
largest donation.
Cecil Green, co-founder of
Texas Instruments, and Ida
Green, of Southern
Methodist University, are not
Stanford graduates but lived in
Palo Alto from 1928 to 1930.
Here they met Stanford alum
nus Charles Litton who later
gave his name to Litton Indus
tries. Green graduated from
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, whose president
had recommended to Leland
Stanford the M.I.T. architect
who designed the original
Quadrangle. Such "interesting
coincidences," explained
Green, might explain "why we
have felt extra affinity for Stan
ford."
The couple's other gifts to
the University include en
dowment of two graduate fel
lowships in geophysics and
funding for completion of the
School of Earth Sciences Ruth
Wattis Mitchell Building.
A conference room in the
new addition has been named
for Ida Green.
Director Weber called the
early plans of the architectural
tirm of Hellmuth, Obata and
Kassabaum "an uncommonly
