### Richard Martinez 
; The Stanford and Cal wo
i\ men's basketball teams may
!j have been involved in a physi
►' cal battle Wednesday night at
Maples Pavilion, but for alter
*« nate halves one team was still
mentally enjoying Christmas
.■ break. The Golden Bears'
[• psyches took most of the first
! half off while the Cards recip
f rocated by being out to lunch
the second half. The final
score read 68-66 in Stanford's
favor.
Stanford's inability to put
Cal away and the Bears' initial
lapse that gave them the lead
actually resulted in a close
contest that was quite pleasing
• for the fans but infuriating for
, the coaches. "I was glad we
j won, but I wasn't happy with
it," Stanfordhead coach Dotty
» McCrea said. "The girls were
unable to put their opponents

away because of their lack ot
mental discipline."
The first 15 minutes of the
game were played with great
intensity by both squads. Stan
ford overcame an early 18-11
deficit to take the lead for
good at 24-23 with five minutes
remaining in the period.
The Cards then outscored
the Bears 11-2. Nine of those
came from )eanne Ruark, al
though the entire team out
ran, outrebounded and out
hustled an obviously befud
dled Cal squad. The first half
ended with Stanford leading,
35-25.
The Cards shot a horrend
ous 39.5 percent from the
floor the first half, but they so
completely dominated the of
fensive boards that second
and even third efforts were
taken to score. Stanford out
rebounded Cal 34-19. Ruark

had a 20-point half, and Meg
Metzger grabbed seven
boards in the most lopsided
half to date in the Stanford-Cal
series.
Momentum remained with
the Cards for opening minutes
of the second halt as they
opened up a 14-point lead.
The most impressive example
of Stanford domination occur
red when the Cards put up
four attempts before scoring.
A Debi Gore steal and basket
made it 47-33, and Stanford
students licked their chops in
anticipation of a Bear humilia
tion.
Halfway through the period,
however, the Cards' emotion,
concentration and discipline
were put on hold while the
Bears awoke from their com
atose state. The Bears gnawed
the lead to 10, 53-43, with
10:40 remaining, junior for
ward Colleen Galloway di
rected her team's comeback,
scoring 19 of her team-high 29
points.
Stanford had several
chances to put the lights out of
the contest, but the Cards
seemed content to try to

match Cal's scoring output.
The good, hustling running
game disappeared, crisp pas
sing and movement went
stale, poor shot selection in
creased and the overall bril
liance of the Cards' first-half
performance digressed to un
inspired mediocrity.
With five minutes remain
ing, the score read 61-54 and
with 1 Vi minutes to play the
lead was cut to 65-60. Employ
ing a full-court press, the
Bears stole an inbound pass
and scored 65-62 with 40 sec
onds to play.
Cardinal guard Angie Pac
cione was fouled after the next
inbound pass and went to the
line to shoot one-and-one.
She hit on the first but missed
the second. Louise Smith,
however, grabbed the re
bound followed with a bucket.
68-62 with 26 seconds to play.
The Bears scored a quick
two and set up the press. 68-64
with 18 seconds to play. Stan
ford fans' nerves frayed even
further when Galloway stole
the inbound pass, made the
shot and was fouled. Galloway

stepped up to the line with the
score reading 68-66 and 8 sec
onds remaining.
Cal's only chance was to
miss the free throw, hoping
for the rebound and a basket
or foul. Galloway, however,
not only made the shot by mis
take, but she was also guilty of
a line violation.
Could the home crowd
breathe easily yet? Not quite.
Paccione was fouled again
immediately upon receiving
the ball. She missed the first of
one-and-one, and a struggle
ensued for the ball.
As anxious coaches and
spectators looked up to the
clock, they noticed one unbe
lievable detail. The clock had
not started! The blunder
fortunately had no effect on
the outcome of the game, but
it was another strange aspect
of an already all-too-unusual
contest.
By holding onto the victory,
Stanford improved its overall
record to 7-8 while commenc
ing league play with a big win.
The Stanford-Cal series is now
7-3 in the Cards' favor.
