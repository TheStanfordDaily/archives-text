# McCrea talks hoop sense

### 
Gradually and patiently, coach Dotty McCrea
has brought Stanford women's basketball to its
current high level of competence -the Cardinals
are regarded as one of the stronger teams on the
West Coast. Daily Friday interviewer Sally /en
kins talked with McCrea about where the team
stands now and what lies in its future.
lenkins: How much have you seen the wo
men's basketball program change since you've
been at Stanford, and in what ways?
McCrea: I think that it has grown as we have
grown. The talent we have is better. The sup
port has grown as we have improved. Also, the
athletes' attitudes have changed. They want to
play more, I think.
lenkins: Has the program changed or im
proved as much as it should?
McCrea: I think the program is where it
should be at this time. Within the three years
I've been here, it has changed a great deal.
Anyone who saw the team three years ago
would certainly tell you that. We have full sup
port in recruiting and in money.
lenkins: The team is 7-8 now, after such a
good start. What happened? It seems as though
you fell off.
McCrea: I think it's a mistake to say we fell
off. We didn't fall off — we played some of the
best teams in the country. We can't improve
our own play unless we play teams that are
better than we are. We expected what hap
pened. We won one game, and that's about
what we thought would happen. The won-loss
record is not what matters to me. We just
played some really good teams, and I think we

got a lot out of it. Those teams play good teams
every day; that's why they have the porse that
they do.
Jenkins: Has there been any change in the
team's play?
McCrea: I think there's been a change in their
overall intensity level. We are letting out the
reins just a little bit and letting them play with a
little more "street sense." Everyone on the
other teams was an Angie Paccione type of
player, a street player. We were too mechanical
in our play, and we are trying to get rid of that.
lenkins: What do you project now for the rest
of the season?
McCrea: I think we will be very competitive in
our own league. Our main goal is to get into
the Regional tournament. As we get older and
wiser our goals will grow. We have a very
young team, with three sophomores and two
freshmen. There are no seniors on the team.
What we need to work on is consistency in our
play. We have not been consistent.
lenkins: What is the most satisfying thing for
you in coaching?
McCrea: I think the fact that I'm getting better
all the time, in terms of the style of play ! want
and recruiting. Also, we have a tremendous
group of people to work with. We are growing
together.
lenkins: How about the most frustrating
thing?
McCrea: The most frustrating thing is getting
consistent performances and intensity, over
coming the Stanford syndrome of only playing


Dotty MtCrea
well against good teams. We need a larger
commitment. That's not to say that basketball
should be their whole life. But we need the
commitment.
Jenkins: Do you have any idea about what
causes the Stanford syndrome?
McCrea: No, I don't know. If I did I wouldn't
be talking about it. Possibly it's because we

have different kinds of people here. Here the
athletes have different things in their life; they
are students and athletes and lots of other
things. Basketball is only a part of their life. At
other schools, basketball is the only reason
they are there. That might be a cause. But that's
part of the job: I have to expect that. Actually, I
think it's healthy.

off. We didn't fall off — we played some of the
best teams in the country. We can't improve
our own play unless we play teams that are
better than we are. We expected what hap
pened. We won one game, and that's about
what we thought would happen. The won-loss
record is not what matters to me. We just
played some really good teams, and I think we

got a lot out of it. Those teams play good teams
every day; that's why they have the porse that
they do.
Jenkins: Has there been any change in the
team's play?
McCrea: I think there's been a change in their
overall intensity level. We are letting out the
reins just a little bit and letting them play with a
little more "street sense." Everyone on the
other teams was an Angie Paccione type of
player, a street player. We were too mechanical
in our play, and we are trying to get rid of that.
lenkins: What do you project now for the rest
of the season?
McCrea: I think we will be very competitive in
our own league. Our main goal is to get into
the Regional tournament. As we get older and
wiser our goals will grow. We have a very
young team, with three sophomores and two
freshmen. There are no seniors on the team.
What we need to work on is consistency in our
play. We have not been consistent.
lenkins: What is the most satisfying thing for
you in coaching?
McCrea: I think the fact that I'm getting better
all the time, in terms of the style of play ! want
and recruiting. Also, we have a tremendous
group of people to work with. We are growing
together.
lenkins: How about the most frustrating
thing?
McCrea: The most frustrating thing is getting
consistent performances and intensity, over
coming the Stanford syndrome of only playing

well against good teams. We need a larger
commitment. That's not to say that basketball
should be their whole life. But we need the
commitment.
Jenkins: Do you have any idea about what
causes the Stanford syndrome?
McCrea: No, I don't know. If I did I wouldn't
be talking about it. Possibly it's because we

have different kinds of people here. Here the
athletes have different things in their life; they
are students and athletes and lots of other
things. Basketball is only a part of their life. At
other schools, basketball is the only reason
they are there. That might be a cause. But that's
part of the job: I have to expect that. Actually, I
think it's healthy.
