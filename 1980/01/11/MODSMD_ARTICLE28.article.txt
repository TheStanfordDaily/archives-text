To the boy from
BeJvidere: Right after
you left, hordes of
attractive blonde female
clones came in singing
"Happy Birthday" and
"Won't you Marry Me,
Bill." We had to send
them away unhappy.
Better luck next time,
buddy. You see, while
many things were
different then, many
things are still the same.
Best wishes,
Imam
& friends
