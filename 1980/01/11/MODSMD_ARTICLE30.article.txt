match-ups of their own tomor
row night at Maples Pavilion
beginning at 7:30 p.m.
Although ranking of gym
nastics squads in not the
highly developed science
found in football or basket
ball, based on the best availa
ble "guestimates" the home
opener for both Cardinal
teams offers several outstand
ing teams and individuals.
The Card men, rated 20th

UCLA and Michigan, both in
the top 10 according to pre
season polls.
In the women's competi

the first time that a Big-10 team
has visited Stanford for gym
nastics.
Hamada described the Spar
tans as a "Big-10 powerhouse,
which makes them a national
powerhouse — they're super
tough."
As respectable as Michigan
is, Hamada picks the improved
Bruins as the favorites, and
along with USC in the wo
men's dual meet, called the
event a "great combination.
The spectators won't be sorn
— it should be a good meet."
Jackie Walker, the Card
women's coach, noted that
the Trojans will be without the
services of their top per
former, Donna Turbow, who

performed exhibition
routines.
Oklahoma dominated the
individual events, taking first
place in all events except for
pommel horse. Stanford's
sophomore all-around per
former Mike Lee stopped the
Sooner's from making a sweep
of the top spots, by winning
the pommel event with an 8.80
score.
Other top finishes for the
Cards included freshman Rich
Rosen, who placed third on

earned eighth in all-around
competition as a freshman in
last year's AIAW champion
shps.
Walker's starting line-up in
cludes Karen Hall, Annie
Smith, Jeanette LaCoste, Trina
Wiggins, Julie Bledsoe, Jen
nifer Roberts and Kim Crow

competition, will be freshman
Mary Lee Mackichan and
sophomore Cindy Stevenson.
Hall has been sick this past
week, junior team captain
Linda Park is out with a stress

Walker.

night at San Jose State's Spar
tan Gym, Stanford placed sec
ond with 247.50 points, behind
Oklahoma's total of 269.35.

lents of Bart Conner, who is
redshirting this season in pre
paration for the Olympics, are
rated among the top three
teams in the country. Conner
did travel with his team and
performed exhibition
routines.
Oklahoma dominated the
individual events, taking first
place in all events except for
pommel horse. Stanford's
sophomore all-around per
former Mike Lee stopped the
Sooner's from making a sweep
of the top spots, by winning
the pommel event with an 8.80
score.
Other top finishes for the
Cards included freshman Rich
Rosen, who placed third on
pommel horse with an 8.40
tally, and Craig Goldman,
Stanford's top ring specialist
with a 9.20 score, good for
third place.
The Sooners also dominated
the all-around competition, fil
ling the top four places. The
winner was Jeff Martin with a
52.90 total, including third
place on parallel bars and sec
ond place in the high bar
competition.
Lee was Stanford's top all
around gymnast, earning fifth
place with a 51.10 total, fol
lowed by senior Tad Bostick in
sixth with 50.05.

match with Oklahoma and San Jose State. Rosen earned an 8.00 in
the event and Stanford placed second behind the Sooners. The
Cardinal squads share a home opener tomorrow night at Maples
Pavilion starting at 7:30 p.m.
The "bowl season" may be
over for college football, but
Stanford's gymnastics teams
play host to some classic
match-ups of their own tomor
row night at Maples Pavilion
beginning at 7:30 p.m.
Although ranking of gym
nastics squads in not the
highly developed science
found in football or basket
ball, based on the best availa
ble "guestimates" the home
opener for both Cardinal
teams offers several outstand
ing teams and individuals.
The Card men, rated 20th
nationally themselves, take on
UCLA and Michigan, both in
the top 10 according to pre
season polls.
In the women's competi
tion, the fifth-ranked gymnasts
from (JSC face Stanford,
picked for the fifth-place spot
in the region (including
Washington, Oregon, Califor
nia, Nevada and Arizona.)
Men's coach Sadao Hamada
explained that the meet marks
the first time that a Big-10 team
has visited Stanford for gym
nastics.
Hamada described the Spar
tans as a "Big-10 powerhouse,
which makes them a national
powerhouse — they're super
tough."
As respectable as Michigan
is, Hamada picks the improved
Bruins as the favorites, and
along with USC in the wo
men's dual meet, called the
event a "great combination.
The spectators won't be sorn
— it should be a good meet."
Jackie Walker, the Card
women's coach, noted that
the Trojans will be without the
services of their top per
former, Donna Turbow, who
won't compete until February.
In Turbow's absence, sopho
more Jill Ornstein will head
