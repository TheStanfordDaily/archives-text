# Huskies knock out Cards
## 
### Rick Ostiller 
Seattle — In recent years
Washington has been the
Stanford basketball team's
favorite punching bag. The
Cardinals had knocked off
the Huskies in four of their
previous five games. Last
night, however, it was
Stanford who was beaten up
as Washington won in a
rout, 81-59.
The win was the first in
league play for the Huskies
after three losses and upped
their season mark to 9-3.
Stanford dropped to 1-4 in
conference play and 3-10
overall.
The game started slowly
for both teams as numerous
turnovers kept the score at
4-all for seven minutes. In
the next seven minutes,
however, the Huskies went
on a 20-10 tear to take a 24-14
lead and they were never
headed.
Washington's lead
stretched to 36-24 at

halftime as Stanford's Kim
berly Belton, Brian Welch
and Doug Barnes tallied all
but two of the Cards' first
half points. Shooting
proved to be the team's
downfall as Stanford hit
only 33 percent in the half,
as compared to 57 percent
for the Huskies.
Stanford came out run
ning in the second half and
made its best spurt of the
game, closing the lead to
45-38 with 12 minutes re
maining after two foul shots
by sophomore Orlando
Ward.
But on the ensuing in
bounds pass, the Cards fell
asleep and Washington's
Stan Walker went in un
molested for a layup. That
play seemed to break Stan
ford's back as it started a
20-9 run for Washington
which put the Huskies
safely ahead, 65-47 with six
minutes remaining.
Once again senior for

ward Belton led the way for
the Cards, with 23 points
and seven rebounds. Welch
added 10, but the sopho
more guard was only two of
10 from the field.
Andra Griffin paced the
Huskies with 20, while
Lorenzo Romar chipped in
14. Walker and Bob Fronk
added 12 apiece, with
Walker snagging a game
high 12 rebounds.
The loss was the 13th
straight on the road for
Stanford and things will not
get any easier Saturday
night when the Cards travel
to meet Washington State.
Stanford has not won in
Pullman in five years and the
Cougars have an eight
game winning streak overall
against the Cards.
Game time is 8 p.m. and
you can hear all the action
on KZSU at 7:45 p.m. from
90.1 on the FM dial.
