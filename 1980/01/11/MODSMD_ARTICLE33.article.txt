# The 						last 'Boy of Summer' shines in Hall
## 
### 
Newsday
New York — An era reached
a wonderful climax this week
and a bittersweet conclusion,
too. Duke Snider, after 11
years of coming close, was
elected to the Baseball Hall of
Fame and there's an awful lot
more involved in that than a
brass tablet and a line of statis
tics.
Duke Snider is the last of the
Brooklyn Dodgers who will
make the Hall of Fame. Pee
Wee Reese's time of eligibility
has passed, a great injustice.
Gil Hodges has three more
years on the ballot, but he is
losing ground. And that's the
end. The last links with a time
that was as remarkable as fic
tion will be left only in the
emotions and under the attic
dust in boxes of yellowing
memorabilia for those who
lived the time.
And shouldn't be. Every
body who cares about sports
and has the slightest taste for
New York ought to know
about the Dodgers and about
Brooklyn the way anybody
who cares about writing out to
read "The Sun Also Rises"
and, maybe, "The Boys of
Summer."
The Yankees were the do
minant team — they used to
beat the Dodgers in the World
Series — but the Yankees of
that time don't squeeze the
corners of the eyes the way
thoughts of those Dodgers do.
The Brooklyn Dodgers domi

nated the emotions, and our
children and our children's
children ought to be told
about it along with Hans Chris
tian Andersen.
They ought to know about
the glorious rivalry with the
Giants — the New York Giants
— which went beyond any
rivalry we know today. Of
course, times were different.
Television was an infrequent
treat and they played most
games in the afternoons and a
program called Today's
Baseball would recreate all
three New York games at din
nertime.
Snider, his hair silver now
and swept over a growing bare
spot, is a broadcaster for the
Montreal Expos. Two summers
ago he stayed a few days with
his wife and daughter on East
18th and Beverly Road and felt
the pangs. "There were tnree
empty purses thrown in the
lobby," Snider said. "It was
sad. It had been such a lovely
place."
Of course, that was before
the world learned to count
backwards to zero so freely
and before we learned to fear
neighborhoods in transition.
We're talking about the time
from 1947 until 1958, when
Walter O'Malley spirited the
Dodgers to Nevernever land.
Snider covered all of those
years as a graceful centerfiel
der. That was his rightfield
wall to hit. In 18 seasons he
batted .295 with 407 home

runs. He hit 40 or more hom
ers five consecutive seasons.
Baseball and the Hall of
Fame are too much a monu
ment to numbers, but the
Dodgers of Brooklyn were of
different stuff. The numbers of
their success were the vehicle
that developed the personal
ties, which is what endures.
That and the atmosphere.
"Campy (Roy Campanella)
would come into the
clubhouse with his hat and
cigar and say, 'Same team that
won yesterday going to win
today,'" Snider said with a
smile of delight at the mem
ory.
When he thinks of little be
nighted Ebbets Field, he first
sees that rightfield fence, so
close and so tall, and the sign
for Gem Blades and Hit Sign
Win Suit. Snider hit it once,
with a line drive over Hank
Sauer's head. It cost him a
dozen autographed balls.
Then he feels the memory of
the team, "the camaraderie,
the fun we had, the sorrows."
Snider was a rookie in 1947,
the year Jackie Robinson cros
sed the color line. Snider re
calls the profound moral sup
port that Reese, a Kentuckian,
gave Robinson when he
needed it most. It's a crime
that the baseball writers who
vote for the Hall of Fame did
not understand Reese's role as
the shortshop on the domin
ant team of his time in the Na
tional League.

Snider remembers Robin
son as a childhood hero when
Snider was in junior high in
Compton and Robinson was at
Pasadena City College. Snider
scampered along as Robinson
left a baseball game to win the
long jump between innings in
his baseball uniform. "They
used to call it the broad
jump," Snider said. "I can see
why they changed the name."
He remembers asking Robin
son if he would change to
track shoes and Robinson
answering that Comnton

Junior College did not have a
good jumper, winning in his
baseball shoes and returning
to the ballgame.
They were times to be re
membered, especially by a
man like Snider, who often
bridled at the criticism of
Brooklyn fans. "I don't think
anybody appreciates the good
times living through them as
much as looking back on
them," Snider said. "It seems
like yesterday. You don't
realize what you have until it's
gone."

end. The last links with a time
that was as remarkable as fic
tion will be left only in the
emotions and under the attic
dust in boxes of yellowing
memorabilia for those who
lived the time.
And shouldn't be. Every
body who cares about sports
and has the slightest taste for
New York ought to know
about the Dodgers and about
Brooklyn the way anybody
who cares about writing out to
read "The Sun Also Rises"
and, maybe, "The Boys of
Summer."
The Yankees were the do
minant team — they used to
beat the Dodgers in the World
Series — but the Yankees of
that time don't squeeze the
corners of the eyes the way
thoughts of those Dodgers do.
The Brooklyn Dodgers domi

nated the emotions, and our
children and our children's
children ought to be told
about it along with Hans Chris
tian Andersen.
They ought to know about
the glorious rivalry with the
Giants — the New York Giants
— which went beyond any
rivalry we know today. Of
course, times were different.
Television was an infrequent
treat and they played most
games in the afternoons and a
program called Today's
Baseball would recreate all
three New York games at din
nertime.
Snider, his hair silver now
and swept over a growing bare
spot, is a broadcaster for the
Montreal Expos. Two summers
ago he stayed a few days with
his wife and daughter on East
18th and Beverly Road and felt
the pangs. "There were tnree
empty purses thrown in the
lobby," Snider said. "It was
sad. It had been such a lovely
place."
Of course, that was before
the world learned to count
backwards to zero so freely
and before we learned to fear
neighborhoods in transition.
We're talking about the time
from 1947 until 1958, when
Walter O'Malley spirited the
Dodgers to Nevernever land.
Snider covered all of those
years as a graceful centerfiel
der. That was his rightfield
wall to hit. In 18 seasons he
batted .295 with 407 home

runs. He hit 40 or more hom
ers five consecutive seasons.
Baseball and the Hall of
Fame are too much a monu
ment to numbers, but the
Dodgers of Brooklyn were of
different stuff. The numbers of
their success were the vehicle
that developed the personal
ties, which is what endures.
That and the atmosphere.
"Campy (Roy Campanella)
would come into the
clubhouse with his hat and
cigar and say, 'Same team that
won yesterday going to win
today,'" Snider said with a
smile of delight at the mem
ory.
When he thinks of little be
nighted Ebbets Field, he first
sees that rightfield fence, so
close and so tall, and the sign
for Gem Blades and Hit Sign
Win Suit. Snider hit it once,
with a line drive over Hank
Sauer's head. It cost him a
dozen autographed balls.
Then he feels the memory of
the team, "the camaraderie,
the fun we had, the sorrows."
Snider was a rookie in 1947,
the year Jackie Robinson cros
sed the color line. Snider re
calls the profound moral sup
port that Reese, a Kentuckian,
gave Robinson when he
needed it most. It's a crime
that the baseball writers who
vote for the Hall of Fame did
not understand Reese's role as
the shortshop on the domin
ant team of his time in the Na
tional League.

Snider remembers Robin
son as a childhood hero when
Snider was in junior high in
Compton and Robinson was at
Pasadena City College. Snider
scampered along as Robinson
left a baseball game to win the
long jump between innings in
his baseball uniform. "They
used to call it the broad
jump," Snider said. "I can see
why they changed the name."
He remembers asking Robin
son if he would change to
track shoes and Robinson
answering that Comnton

Junior College did not have a
good jumper, winning in his
baseball shoes and returning
to the ballgame.
They were times to be re
membered, especially by a
man like Snider, who often
bridled at the criticism of
Brooklyn fans. "I don't think
anybody appreciates the good
times living through them as
much as looking back on
them," Snider said. "It seems
like yesterday. You don't
realize what you have until it's
gone."
Newsday
New York — An era reached
a wonderful climax this week
and a bittersweet conclusion,
too. Duke Snider, after 11
years of coming close, was
elected to the Baseball Hall of
Fame and there's an awful lot
more involved in that than a
brass tablet and a line of statis
tics.
Duke Snider is the last of the
Brooklyn Dodgers who will
make the Hall of Fame. Pee
Wee Reese's time of eligibility
has passed, a great injustice.
Gil Hodges has three more
years on the ballot, but he is
losing ground. And that's the
end. The last links with a time

tion will be left only in the
