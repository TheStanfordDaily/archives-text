# Swimmers meet ASU, among others
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
The swimming teams face an eventful
weekend beginning today. DeCuerre
Pools will be visited by scores of
aquanauts from far and near for a three
meet progression.
The men open the action with a dual
meet at 2 p.m. against Simon Fraser Uni
versity from Barnaby, British Columbia.
Simon Fraser is actually a familiar name to
the swimming world, as it is the perpetu
ally reigning monarch in the NAIA (the
small college version of the NCAA). Car
dinal coach Skip Kenney will enter his
squad in secondary events to allow for
experimentation and more equality in
competition.
California, San Jose State, University of
Pacific, Simon Fraser and Arizona State
University will plunge into the melee of
the Stanford Relays Saturday at 1 p.m.
Both the men and the women will enjoy

the unorthodox team races and relaxed
atmosphere.
Finally, the climax takes place Sunday
afternoon at 1 as the Card men and
women hurtle against the might of ASU.
Our outlook is a prayer and a dive,"
estimated Kenney. The December issue
of Swimming World magazine ranked the
ASU men 10th in its predictions for this
year's NCAA finalists.
"They beat Cal ( the eventual NCAA
victor) in dual meet competition last year,
so we're looking for them to swim well
there Friday, and we can take them on the
rebound," Kenney anticipated.
The big horses on ASU. according to
Stanford assistant coach Stu Corliss, are
backstroker and individual medleyist
Blake lohnson, breaststroke sprinter Sam
lones and distance swimmers Andrew
Astbury, Paul Asmuth and ]im New.
The Sun Devils will also be represented

by national calibre divers Dan La Sarge
and Duwan Ericson, who will be pitted
against the Cards' lone Bryan McCleve.
The Cards' chances against such a
blockbuster are not nil; just slim. "If we
have a great meet, we can beat them,''
Kenney said. "But everyone on the team
has to contribute. The stars won't help if
the others don't come through as well."
Neither are the ASU women anything to
be scorned. Perennial high finishers in
the AIAW nationals, they nudged the
Cards aside by 13 points to attain second
place in that meet last year.
They killed us in our dual meet, and
we swam well," admitted coach Claudia
Thomas. According to her, the ASU team
is not as potent as it was last year because
of the homeward migration of several
Canadian members to train for the sum
mer Olympics.
