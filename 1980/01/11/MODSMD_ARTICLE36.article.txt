# Rock reading no substitute for real thing
## BOOKS 
### 
It's a sad tact, but true, that rock fans can
spend as much time reading about music as
listening to it. |ust this fall, three major guides
to rock music have appeared. Born To Run, the
Bruce Springsteen Story (reviewed in the De
cember 6 Daily) examined the man many feel is
the single most important rock musician
around. The Story of Motown (Grove Press,
$8.95) purports to be the definitive history of
the most important record company of the
1960s and 70s. And the long-awaited Rolling
Stone Record Guide (Random House, $8.95)
claims to be the first (and, therefore, most im
portant) comprehensive critical guide to rock
records.
Peter Benjaminson's Story of Motown is a
short, easy-to-read and, surprisingly, impartial
account of the rise and continued prosperity of
Berry Gordy's empire. Motown Records,
started by Gordy in 1959 with 800 borrowed
dollars, was, less than 10 years later, the largest
black-owned business in the country. By taking
black music out of the hands of white execu
tives, he changed the course of popular music.
But, as Benjaminson points out, the battle
wasn't won without a few losses. To succeed in
an industry run by whites, Gordy had to com
promise; the Motown sound had to strike a
balance between real rhythm-and-blues and
more traditional "white soul." And, during the
seventies, Motown became more and more

conservative, turning from music to film and
multi-media packages.
Benjaminson condemns no one. Berry Gordy
set out to bring blacks financial equality, and he
did more in that direction than any other man
has. If the music was compromised, well, that
was never really the point.
Even so, the Motown stars do pretty well in
the Rolling Stone Record Guide. Edited by Dave
Marsh (author of The Bruce Springsteen Story),
the Record Guide contains capsule reviews of
almost 10,000 currently available rock (and pop,
soul, country, etc.; influences are given their
due) albums. The key phrase is "currently av
ailable"; they don't review anything you can't
get from your local record store. So, for a lot of
sixties groups whose albums are out of print,
only greatest hits collections get reviewed.
Still, the Guide is fascinating. You can spend
hours comparing opinions with some of rock
criticism's big guns (Marsh, John Swenson,
Greil Marcus, Chet Filippo, Peter Herbst, and
on and on). The ratings, ranging from five stars
(indispensable) down to no stars (roughly
comparable to guano) are completely arbitrary:
it appears that the individual reviewers as
signed ratings with no editorial control what
soever. This just adds to the fun, what would
you have given Yellow Submarine ( Peter
Herbst gave it a two)?


Six of (he five-slar albums in the Rolling Stone
Record Guide, .ilhums considered "indispensa
ble for any comprehensive collection"
(clockwise from upper left): Forever Changes,
love; Traffic, Traffic; Darkness on the Edge of
Town, Bruce Springsteen; The Freewheelin'
Hob Dylan, Boh Dylan; The Best of Dolly Par
ton, Dolly Parton; Tapestry, Carole King. While

the editors claim to have been "compelled to
deflate the reputations of certain previously
overestimated performers," the reputations of
most of rock's big names are left unscathed. The
Beatles rate 14 five-star albums, the Rolling
Stones six, Elvis 17. The Who, however, get only
three.


The Supremes


DA FREE JOHN was born in the West, and he
Awakened here and lives here. But he is neither a
conventional Western man of religion and action
nor a conventionally ascetic "swami" in the tradi
tional style of Eastern adepts. His Teaching, The
Way of Divine Ignorance, is a unique communica
tion of the living Truth, free of all binding cultural
and philosophical influences, and thus accessible
to all modern men and women.


Berry Gordy
