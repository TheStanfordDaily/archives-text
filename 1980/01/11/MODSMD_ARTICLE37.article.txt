When Roger /elazny takes a
Sunday drive, he travels fast.
In Roadmarks, his 18th novel,
/elazny travels trom Babylon
•to the Day of Reckoning and
back again in a mere 185
pages, leaving his fans breath
less and the rest ot us wonder
ing it we've really gotten any
where.
"Drive" isn't just my
metaphor tor the journey.
Roadmarks' hero, Red Dora
keen, drives his battered blue
pickup along the Road. The
Road, of course, travels from
the distant past to the foggy
tuture, with interchanges at
major branches ot history —

the Babylon exit, tor example.
The off-ramps are tricky,
though; they move around,
and fade away, and new ones
branch out toward the histori
cal suburbs which seem to be
springing up all the time.
Because, you see, all these
worlds, past, present and fu
ture, exist at the same time.
And events in the future affect
past worlds, and vice versa.
And it nasty things happen
now, a nice world that's 2000
years back down the road may
lose its ramp, and nasty new
ones may appear. A rough
analogy would be closing
down University and Embar
cadero and leaving open all
the Sunnyvale exits.
If you've read /elazny's
Amber series, you're probably
beginning to suspect that he's

traveled this road before.
While there is no perfect
realm in Roadmarks, there is a
place good enough to make
Red spend his life searching
tor it. And Dorakeen, like
Corwin ot the House of
Amber, is part of a select
group that knows how to navi
gate the spaces between
worlds.
In Roadmarks, though, the
group is larger, and far from
royal. The Road seems to be
travelled mainly by fastbuck
artists who have been kicked
out of their own worlds. The
novel's tone is rather squalid,
or worse, pedestrian. Corwin
could always go on a hellride;
Dorakeen has to obey the
speed limit.
The famed Amber books
succeeded because /elazny

never let his mysticism and
Eastern religious maunderings
get in the way of the story (un
til the last book, anyway). In
their own way, they resembled
C.S. Lewis' Narnia stories: a
very good read if you missed,
or ignored, the allegorical
elements.
Roadmarks, on the other
hand, reads about as easily as
the Bahagavad-Gita. So much
time is spent explaining what
the road is, how it got to be
there, and why Dorakeen
travels it, that very little space
is left for the action. The plot,
slight to begin with, is twisted
beyond recognition to ac
commodate /elazny's
philosophy.
/elazny has a gift for fan
tasy; he can create incredible
worlds and characters that

seem as real as the nerd next
door. But all his big-name
books have been, to one de
gree or another, bogged down
by his philosophical obses
sions. My own favorite
Zelazny novel ended up as the
basis tor Death Race 2000:
perhaps it deserved better,
but then I liked the movie bet
ter than the film versions of
Siddhartha or Steppenwolf.
The jacket blurb for Road
marks calls Zelazny "a great
imaginative writer." )ust what
that means, I'm not sure; I al
ways thought all great writers
were imaginative, /elazny may
have an active imagination,
but Roadmarks proves once
again that he's too obsessed to
be really imaginative.

Roadmarks' hero, Red Dora
keen, drives his battered blue
pickup along the Road. The
Road, of course, travels from
the distant past to the foggy
tuture, with interchanges at
major branches ot history —

the Babylon exit, tor example.
The off-ramps are tricky,
though; they move around,
and fade away, and new ones
branch out toward the histori
cal suburbs which seem to be
springing up all the time.
Because, you see, all these
worlds, past, present and fu
ture, exist at the same time.
And events in the future affect
past worlds, and vice versa.
And it nasty things happen
now, a nice world that's 2000
years back down the road may
lose its ramp, and nasty new
ones may appear. A rough
analogy would be closing
down University and Embar
cadero and leaving open all
the Sunnyvale exits.
If you've read /elazny's
Amber series, you're probably
beginning to suspect that he's

traveled this road before.
While there is no perfect
realm in Roadmarks, there is a
place good enough to make
Red spend his life searching
tor it. And Dorakeen, like
Corwin ot the House of
Amber, is part of a select
group that knows how to navi
gate the spaces between
worlds.
In Roadmarks, though, the
group is larger, and far from
royal. The Road seems to be
travelled mainly by fastbuck
artists who have been kicked
out of their own worlds. The
novel's tone is rather squalid,
or worse, pedestrian. Corwin
could always go on a hellride;
Dorakeen has to obey the
speed limit.
The famed Amber books
succeeded because /elazny

never let his mysticism and
Eastern religious maunderings
get in the way of the story (un
til the last book, anyway). In
their own way, they resembled
C.S. Lewis' Narnia stories: a
very good read if you missed,
or ignored, the allegorical
elements.
Roadmarks, on the other
hand, reads about as easily as
the Bahagavad-Gita. So much
time is spent explaining what
the road is, how it got to be
there, and why Dorakeen
travels it, that very little space
is left for the action. The plot,
slight to begin with, is twisted
beyond recognition to ac
commodate /elazny's
philosophy.
/elazny has a gift for fan
tasy; he can create incredible
worlds and characters that

seem as real as the nerd next
door. But all his big-name
books have been, to one de
gree or another, bogged down
by his philosophical obses
sions. My own favorite
Zelazny novel ended up as the
basis tor Death Race 2000:
perhaps it deserved better,
but then I liked the movie bet
ter than the film versions of
Siddhartha or Steppenwolf.
The jacket blurb for Road
marks calls Zelazny "a great
imaginative writer." )ust what
that means, I'm not sure; I al
ways thought all great writers
were imaginative, /elazny may
have an active imagination,
but Roadmarks proves once
again that he's too obsessed to
be really imaginative.
