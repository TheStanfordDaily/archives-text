# SRI story to be partly told
## 
### 
While many students know the initials SRI
only because of the recent controversy over
University control of the institute, the history of
SRI goes back nearly 65 years. On January 15
SRI - The Founding Years, the first volume of a
projected 3-volume history of SRI International,
formerly the Stanford Research Institute, will
be released by William Kaufmann, Inc., of Los
Altos (212 pp., $22.50).
The book will cover the early years of SRI,
beginning in 1925 when the idea for an institute
first arose here, until the end of 1948, and con
centrating on the years 1945 â€” 1948. The book
is largely the story of the individuals who took
part in the birth and development of SRI. Au
thor Weldon P. Gibson explains the parts
played by me : . such as Stephen Bechtel, James

Forrestal, Donald Tresidder, J.D. Zellerbach
and Herbert Hoover.
Gibson himself was involved in SRl's growth
from a concept to one of the largest institutions
of its kind in the world, employing 3000 profes
sionals in more than 100 disciplines. He joined
SRI at the beginning, became associate director
in 1955, and its first vice president in 1959, and
has been a member of the board of directors
since that year.
While the social and moral implications of
the research done by SRI are a subject for fre
quent, often fierce, debate, the institute's im
portance cannot be denied. SRI - The Founding
Years will be required reading for anyone in
terested in Stanford, in the institute, and in the
realities of scientific research.
