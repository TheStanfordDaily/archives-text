Kramer vs. Kramer * * * Vt
Old Mill
In most respects, writer
director Robert Benton's movie
is an astonishing one. With the
interplay between a brilliant
Dustin Hoffman and a youngster
of almost frighteningly correct
instincts named Justin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton con
structs a moving, compassion
,ate, almost Truffaut-like'"charac
ter study of a divorced man's
'struggle to love and care for his
.son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of
,the film. After all the care and
honesty Benton's invested
'throughout, why does he have
>to load the dice against the
( female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
' as much merit as Hoffman's, but

instead of taking things head on,
Benton backed off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity. )ane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb
composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen

A fantastic movie, but don't

black-and-white cinematography
combines with new directing
skills and a fresh attitude toward
film-making to provide a sensi

Old Mill Look, I love Steve Mar
tin, but this is more an attempt
to cash in on his present status
than an effort to face tougher
creative challenges. Steve's born
a "poor black child," and several
of the skits in this rags to riches
to rags story revel so wildly in
their dumbness that they simply
must be inspired, but this is sim
ply not the movie that's going to
make Martin a memorable movie
comedian. He's got the unique

Intolerance * * * *
Monday, Cubberley
An absolutely stupendous
movie. Made in 1919, at a then
astronomical $3 million, this
D.W. Griffith classic ranks as one
of the most fundamentally im
portant films ever made. Intoler
ance was a commercial failure
and it ruined Griffith's career,
and his intention here—to detail
intolerance throughout the
ages—certainly seems mad,
even suicidal, but there's clearly
a stunning creative and technical
genius working also. Much epic
filmmaking and movie making in

Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false
melodramatics; almost con
structed as the visual equivalent
of a Willie Nelson song. The fact
that Nelson's one of the co-stars
only enhances the warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
thoughtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-)ane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver
tises breakfast cereal for a de
humanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set
the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford fall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoid

the prefab elements, maintain

Wednesday, Bishop Aud., 7:30
p.m.
Marcel Dalio and Nora Cregor
star in this classic lean Renoir
movie. The social mores of the
French leisure class are bitterly
parodied; the satire is so harsh
at times that it intentionally
ceases to be funny. An extraordi
nary movie from one of the
greatest directors ever, working
at the very height of his powers in
this 1939 effort. K L
Apocalypse Now * # + *
Old Mill
Century, San Jose
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —

horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this just-ended de
cade. It has almost untenable
ambitions, but the profound
questions that it confronts you
with justity the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind.
Starring Marlon Brando, Martin
Sheen and Robert Duvall.

Aquarius, Palo Alto
The sexist ad campaign has
misled many people to this
movie; if you're looking for a
semi-pornographic turn-on, 10
may not be right for you.
Writer-director Blake Edwards'
values are, for lack of a better
word, straight, and this comedy
about male mid-life crisis proba
bly won't please those who

enjoy watching females gel con
quered. As an over-40 songwri
ter, Dudley Moore is an ingratiat
ing humbler, and Edwards gives
the remainder of the cast more
than enough depth to get by. Fx
cept for Bo Derek, that is. This
poster-star just may have found
her "niche" as the vacuous "10"

It would be easy to get worked

vaguely based on )anis (oplin.
But the movie only makes thrpe
references to 1%9, and without
those you'd probably just as

present. And the music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than
as )anis loplin's form of blues
and rock. The performances at
times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ
ences. When teamed with either
Frederic Forrest or Alan Bates,
Midler comes off much better,
but it's too little too late.

1941 * * *

Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directorial perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as an ex

Hawks-style comedy, 1941 is the'
strongest effort in years. Like a<
Stennet or lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly

the very harsh reaction of most<

completely physical, frenzied

Despite all that, I like this,
movie. There isn't a physical

Intolerance * * * *
Monday, Cubberley
An absolutely stupendous
movie. Made in 1919, at a then
astronomical $3 million, this
D.W. Griffith classic ranks as one
of the most fundamentally im
portant films ever made. Intoler
ance was a commercial failure
and it ruined Griffith's career,
and his intention here—to detail
intolerance throughout the
ages—certainly seems mad,
even suicidal, but there's clearly
a stunning creative and technical
genius working also. Much epic
filmmaking and movie making in
general owes a great deal to Grif
fith and specifically to Intoler
ance. Lillian Gish stars.

Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false
melodramatics; almost con
structed as the visual equivalent
of a Willie Nelson song. The fact
that Nelson's one of the co-stars
only enhances the warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
thoughtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-)ane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver
tises breakfast cereal for a de
humanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set
the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford fall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoid
ing overt messages and, despite
the prefab elements, maintain
ing its charm and good natured

Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of

search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where
one of the Enterprise's crew
members saves civilization by
gleefully agreeing to some cos
mic sex — is unintentionally
hilarious. Shatner, Nimoy and
the rest were much better on
TV; on the 70mm screen they're
almost unbelievably wooden.

In most respects, writer

structs a moving, compassion

'struggle to love and care for his

But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of
,the film. After all the care and
honesty Benton's invested
'throughout, why does he have
>to load the dice against the
( female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
' as much merit as Hoffman's, but

instead of taking things head on,
Benton backed off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking

aptly described as frenetic show

as )anis loplin's form of blues

times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi

Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directorial perfor

dramatic tension, but as an ex

strongest effort in years. Like a<

Kramer vs. Kramer * * * Vt
Old Mill
In most respects, writer
director Robert Benton's movie
is an astonishing one. With the
interplay between a brilliant
Dustin Hoffman and a youngster
of almost frighteningly correct
instincts named Justin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton con
structs a moving, compassion
,ate, almost Truffaut-like'"charac
ter study of a divorced man's
'struggle to love and care for his
.son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of
,the film. After all the care and
honesty Benton's invested
'throughout, why does he have
>to load the dice against the
( female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
' as much merit as Hoffman's, but

instead of taking things head on,
Benton backed off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity. )ane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb
composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen
dros.

New Varsity, tonight and tomor

A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
,plan to think about it and not

just bask in its glow. Artful
black-and-white cinematography
combines with new directing
skills and a fresh attitude toward
film-making to provide a sensi
tive portrayal of the struggle for
farmers' rights in North Dakota
in 1915 and 1916. Unwooden but
non-professional actors appear
in this occasionally slow-moving
winner of the Cannes Golden
Camera Award for the best fea
ture film last year. See it for its
human characterizations and
poignant plot. A thinking per
son's movie.

The jerk * *
Old Mill Look, I love Steve Mar
tin, but this is more an attempt
to cash in on his present status
than an effort to face tougher
creative challenges. Steve's born
a "poor black child," and several
of the skits in this rags to riches
to rags story revel so wildly in
their dumbness that they simply
must be inspired, but this is sim
ply not the movie that's going to
make Martin a memorable movie
comedian. He's got the unique
moves and he's perhaps got the
mind, but doesn't yet have the
material — The lerk's more a str
inging together of sketches than
a movie. Maybe next time, okay?

Intolerance * * * *
Monday, Cubberley
An absolutely stupendous
movie. Made in 1919, at a then
astronomical $3 million, this
D.W. Griffith classic ranks as one
of the most fundamentally im
portant films ever made. Intoler
ance was a commercial failure
and it ruined Griffith's career,
and his intention here—to detail
intolerance throughout the
ages—certainly seems mad,
even suicidal, but there's clearly
a stunning creative and technical
genius working also. Much epic
filmmaking and movie making in
general owes a great deal to Grif
fith and specifically to Intoler
ance. Lillian Gish stars.
—R.L.
Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false
melodramatics; almost con
structed as the visual equivalent
of a Willie Nelson song. The fact
that Nelson's one of the co-stars
only enhances the warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
thoughtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-)ane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver
tises breakfast cereal for a de
humanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set
the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford fall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoid
ing overt messages and, despite
the prefab elements, maintain
ing its charm and good natured
ness throughout. A completely

Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of
greed — Paramount Pictures. A
mechanical creation of man
comes back to haunt him as the
darling creature's quest for
knowledge leads it to finally
search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where
one of the Enterprise's crew
members saves civilization by
gleefully agreeing to some cos
mic sex — is unintentionally
hilarious. Shatner, Nimoy and
the rest were much better on
TV; on the 70mm screen they're
almost unbelievably wooden.
The rest of the movie is like a
greatest hits of Douglas Trum
bull and |ohn Dykstra's previous
special effects set out in lengthly
detail.

Mean Streets * ★ * ★
Friday, Kresge
One of director Martin Scor
sese's earliest efforts. This raw,
blistering 1973 drama was largely
ignored when it opened; soon it
may be regarded as a classic. An
exciting examination of street
life in Little Italy; Mean Streets
features extraordinary perfor
mances from the then-unknown
Harvey Keitel and Robert De
Nliro.

Superman * ★ *
Sunday, Mem Aud, 7 & 9:45 p.m.
A triumph of corporate com
promise, and while that
shouldn't sound like much, this
movie works. Though it's
scarcely great, a remarkable
>

number of the right decisions
are made, and what the movie
lacks in childlike wonder it
makes up for with an experi
enced comic book sense. The
movie survives its overlong
opening sequence (Brando try
ing to sound like Olivier) and
finishes rather breathlessly.
Christopher Reeve is a capable
Superman, but as Lois Lane,
Margot Kidder is the best thing
in the movie — she brings out
the sexiness we always knew
Lois Lane had.

Marcel Dalio and Nora Cregor
star in this classic lean Renoir
movie. The social mores of the
French leisure class are bitterly
parodied; the satire is so harsh
at times that it intentionally
ceases to be funny. An extraordi
nary movie from one of the
greatest directors ever, working
at the very height of his powers in
this 1939 effort. K L
Apocalypse Now * # + *
Old Mill
Century, San Jose
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —

horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this just-ended de
cade. It has almost untenable
ambitions, but the profound
questions that it confronts you
with justity the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind.
Starring Marlon Brando, Martin
Sheen and Robert Duvall.
