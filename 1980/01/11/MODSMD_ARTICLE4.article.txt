# Western Culture gets the nod
## 
### Fran Miller 
At the end of what Vice President and Provost Donald
Kennedy called "perhaps the most important discussion
it will undertake this year," the Faculty Senate unoffi
cially approved the establishment of Western Cultuie
requirement and the modification of the current dis
tribution requirements.
Both proposals will become effective this fall. Neither
will pertain to students who have already entered the
University.
The Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US),
headed by History Assoc. Prof. Carolyn Lougee, re
commended the motions after careful review of a report
from the Western Culture Pilot Program Committee.
Final discussion and vote will take place at the next
senate meeting Jan. 24.
Seven tracks
According to the plan, students could choose from
among at least seven tracks to satisfy the Western Cul
ture portion of the program. The courses could be taken
at any time during the undergraduate years.
The tracks include Structured Liberal Education, His
tory 1-2-3, Flumanities 61-62-63, Great Works ot Western
Culture 1-2-3 (thecurrent non-compulsory Western Cul
ture series), Ideas in Western Culture (proposed by the
Philosophy and Religious Studies departments), Com
parative Literature 21-22-23, and Values Technology and
Society 1-2-3.
Although Assoc. Prof, of Political Science David Aber
nethy expressed some concern over the lack of art and
music, science and technology, and the West's interac
tion with the non-West, Religious Studies Dept. Chair
man William Clebsch expressed his view that one could
"hardly expect" all features to be present in all the tracks
(forexample, some tracks did offer music) and that there
was an "enormous amount of concern for these issues."
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, head of the Western Cul
ture Pilot Program Committee, said that "the concepts
make sense, the courses are there and they're Rood."
The second motion was concerned with the new sys
tem of distribution requirements. Under the new prop

osal, students will have to take one course in each of
seven subject areas (initially defined by theC-US) as well
as the three sequential Western Culture Courses.
The seven areas are: Literature and Fine Arts;
Philosophical, Social and Religious Thought; Human
Development, Behavior and L anguage; Social Processes
and Institutions; Mathematical Sciences; Natural Sci
ences; Technology and Applied Sciences.
The writing requirement would be unaffected by this
proposal,
Lougee said she believed that the current distribution
requirement is "meaningless," because the criteria that
qualify a course to satisfy the requirement are poorly
defined. Although criteria for courses that satisfy the
requirement have yet to be drawn up, she said, the new
system would provide a "stronger and better-balanced
program and incentive for new courses." Assoc. Prof, of
Political Science Nannerl Keohane concurred with
Lougee and said that students will "have better ground
ing on which to base future courses."
In another unofficial vote, the senate approved the
creation of a Standing Subcommittee on Distribution-
Requirements under the C-US to determine which
courses would satisfy the distribution requirements,
112 ewer courses would be applicable to the requirements
under the new system.
Vice Provost Gerald Lieberman said he was "nervous
about out ability to get our act together by (autumn
quarter) 1980." Dean of Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian, has conducted feasibility studies on
these proposals, however, and assured the senate that
even if no new courses were developed "we now have
ones sufficient" to accommodate 1600 students.
President Richard Lyman said that "no one is ever
going to be wholly satisfied." He added that "the re
quirements are so much better than what we've been
living with, I hate to see us not move ahead."
