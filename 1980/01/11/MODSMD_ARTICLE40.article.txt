Wholesale prices rise 12.5%
Washington — Prices charged by producers rose
0.8 percent in December, bringing the inflation
rate at the wholesale level to 12.5 percent for all of
1979 — the steepest rise in five years — the gov
ernment reported yesterday.
The increase, while still hii'li bv historical stan
dards, marked a slowdown tmin he 1.3 percent
jump recorded in November and was the smallest
monthly rise since |une.
However, the improvement was concentrated
entirely in food prices, reflecting earlier declines
in farm prices. Prices of non-food items soared 1.2
percent in December, up from an 0.8 percent in
crease the previous month.
In all, the index provided little, it any, hope that
inflation might abate soon. Retail prices, whose
behavior often parallels those at the wholesale
level, have been rising at a 13.1 percent annual
rate.
The 12.5 percent increase for the year was the
largest since 1974, just before the last recession,
when wholesale prices rose a sharp 18.3 percent.
In both years, sharply rising energy prices were a
major factor.
Yesterday's report left the overall producer
price index at 227.8 percent of its 1967 average,
meaning it took $227.80 to buy the same goods at
wholesale that cost $100 just 13 years ago.
The producer price index previously was known
as the Wholesale Price Index, but has changed
after wholesalers' groups complained that the
name reflected unfairly upon their industry.
Militants confer with Khomeini
Tehran, Iran — Moslem militants from the U.S.
Embassy made a surprise pilgrimage to Qom yes
terday and consulted with Ayatollah Kuhollah
Khomeini, stirring speculation that some solid de
velopment may be near in the long captivity of
their American hostages.
But one possibility was that the militants were
only trying to persuade Khomeini to order that
U.S. diplomat L. Bruce Laingen, in custody at the
Foreign Ministry, be handed over to them.
The government radio reported that the leader
of a shadowy assassination band called "The Ko
ran" and 15 ol his comrades had been captured
alter a shootout with militiamen. The band had
claimed responsibility for a string of political kil
lings, including the slaying of a Khomeini associate
last month that many Iranians denounced as the
work of the CIA.
Anti-Khomeini unrest continued among Iran's
ethnic minorities yesterday. General strikes
paralyzed two provincial capitals — Tabriz, center
of the Azerbaijani region, and Kurdish-populated
Sanandaj.
One spokesman lor the student militants said
100 of the estimated 500 young people occupying
the embassy had gone to see tfie Iranian leader,
but another of the youths later denied the group
was that large.
The students refused to say whether the trip was
concerned with their 50 or so American hostages
or with Laingen, Although one said of the Laingen
issue, "If we had wanted to (discuss that), we
would have sent two people."
In was the first known meeting between Kho
meini and the militants, who describe themselves
as loyal followers of the ayatollah and have a cler
gyman representative ot Khomeini in the embassy.

Agreement escapes Sadat, Begin
Aswan, Egypt — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin appa
rently failed to reach agreement on a single sub
stantive Palestinian issue in the Middle East peace
negotiations that ended here yesterday after three
intensive meetings, despite the pressure to reach
agreement on self-rule in the territories occupied
by Israel.
Sadat resuscitated a plan he advanced more
than a year ago by proposing that Israel's idea of
limited self-rule for the 1.1 million Palestinian
Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip be im
plemented first in the Gaza Strip, which between
1948 and the Israeli-Arab six-day war of 1967 was
occupied by Egypt.
Seizing upon the suggestion, Begin said he
would present a "Gaza First" proposal to his
Cabinet as early as Sunday. But Sadat immediately
countered with the caveat that autonomy for the
approximately 500,000 Gazans could not be put
into effect until agreement was reached on the
future self-governance of all Palestinians in the
occupied territories.
Begin and Sadat made it clear in statements to
reporters that they did not even come close in an
understanding on the future of Jerusalem, which
Begin called "eternal and indivisible."
But the two leaders said they are in accord on
the formidable strategic questions facing the Mid
dle East and eastern Asia in the wake of the Iranian
upheaval and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
even though mutual military cooperation is un
likely at this time.
Labor giant Meany dead at 85
Washington — George Meany, 85, the blunt and
gruff-spoken former Bronx plumber who played a
giant role in American public life for decades as
the leader and personification of the American
labor movement, died here last night.
Meany had been in ill health for nearly a year
before retiring in November as president of the
AFL-CIO, the giant labor federation he forged al
most singlehandedly almost a quartercenturyago.
Meany died of cardiac arrest about 10 p.m. EST.
He was admitted to George Washington Univer
sity Hospital over the weekend after fluid began
building up in his legs.
Cuban influence seen declining
United Nations — Cuba's loss of a hard-fought
bid for a U.N. Security Council seat has dealt a
heavy blow to Fidel Castro's hopes of steering the
Third World majority here.
In the view of some observers, the Cuban with
drawal Monday from a contest over a vacant chair
on the 15-member council, coupled with Third
World shock over the Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan, also has given the United States a unique
opportunity to better its relations with developing
nations.
But representatives of the 95-member
nonaligned movement, the sprawling policy coali
tion to which most Third World countries belong,
have warned against a U.S. push to befriend them
at the public expense of the Soviets.
Instead, they caution that the issue of Cuba, as
well as current events in Afghanistan and Iran,
marksaturningpoint fortheirorganization, which
they feel, above all, must be left to find its own
direction.

China won't buy many weapons
Wuhan, China — U.S. Defense Secretary Harold
Brown said yesterday the Chinese do not want to
buy large amounts of arms from the United States
or other countries, for fear they would cost too
much and make China too defendent on foreign
suppliers.
After four days of talks in Peking, Brown said he
heard no requests from the Chinese for U.S.
weapons, but indicated they did want what he
called "fundamental technology," such as compu
ter and civilian aircraft designs, which could even
tually help them develop their own arms technol
ogy and industry.
President promises no grain glut
Washington — The Carter administration yester
day moved dramatically to shore up grain prices,
promising that it would not sell in this country, or
would sell only above certain prices, any of the
grain that was to have gone to the Soviet Union.
"The crops will be isolated from the market, and
there is no reason why they should become a
market depressant," said Howard Hjort, the Ag
riculture Department's principal economist, at a
news conference.
President jimmy Carter announced last Friday
that he was embargoing about 17 million tons of
grain exports to the Soviet Union in retaliation for
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Monday, having shut the grain markets to give
them time to adjust, the administration said it in
tended to buy up the embargoed grain to keep
prices from collapsing.
Oil companies to hike fuel prices
New York — The second shock wave from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
winter crude oil price hikes has hit the United
States, with most majoroil companies announcing
increases of up to 6 cents a gallon in wholesale
gasoline or heating oil prices.
The increases, which are likely to be passed on
to consumers, were generally attributed by oil
companies yesterday to rising crude oil prices.
But one U.S. oil industry source said he believes
heating oil prices may fall by as much as a nickel a
gallon later this winter because stockpiles here
and abroad are at such high levels.
Stock market continues to climb
New York — Heavy institutional buying again
powered the stock market to a broad-based gain
yesterday as it shrugged off some unfavorable
economic news.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks
closed with a 8.87 gain at 858.96. The blue chip
index, little changed throughout the morning,
surged to an 11 point lead by midafternoon before
giving back some of that gain near the close.
Yesterday's Big Board volume came to 55.98 mill
ion shares, down Irom 65.26 million Wednesday
which was the third busiest day in NYSE history.
