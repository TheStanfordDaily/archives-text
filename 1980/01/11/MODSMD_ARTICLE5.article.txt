Kabul, Afghanistan â€” Fighting bet
ween Soviet troops and Afghan Mos
lem insurgents is said to be continu
ing in several provinces in eastern
Afghanistan, with unconfirmed re
ports that a provincial capital has (al
ien to the insurgents.
Diplomatic sources said they had
received reports that Talakan, the
provincial capital of Takhar Province
in northeastern Afghanistan border
ing the Soviet Union, had been cap
tured within the last few days from
beleaguered Afghan government
troops. The Soviet invasion force that
began pouring across the border two
weeks ago was not believed to have
taken over Talakan yet from the Af
ghan government forces.
However, Wednesday night a con

voy of Soviet troops could be seen
driving from a base near Kabul to the
airport, where transport planes or
helicopters were heard ready to take
off. The Soviet troops appeared to
number about 401). Most looked to
be of Tajik ethnic origin from that
region of the Soviet Union near the
border with Afghanistan. The
Soviets' 27-truck convoy, followed to
the airport by reporters, included
nine trucks loaded with equipment.
It could not be determined where
the troops were going. Observers
speculated that they were being air
lifted to one of a number of troub
lespots in eastern Afghanistan.
Diplomats said they have heard
reports of casualties on both sides,
but it has not been possible so far to
verify them or determine the extent

and intensity of the fighting.
Before the Dec. 27 Soviet coup that
installed a new communist govern
ment here under Babrak Karrnal,
Badakhshan Province was reported
to be almost completely in the hands
of the insurgents except for the capi
tal, Frizabad, where harried Afghan
government troops were barely re
taining control. Since the coup,
Soviet troops are said to have gone to
Badakhshan, but there has been no
evidence that they have yet suc
ceeded in overrunning either it or
Takhar Province.
However, with two more Soviet di
visions reportedly joining the five al
ready in the country and bringing
total Soviet strength here to an esti
mated 85,000 men, diplomats here
feel it is only a matter of time before

the Russian troops enter the trou
bled provinces in force.
"They are going there to finish off
the rebels," an Asian diplomat said.
But he added that based on more
than a decade of experience here, he
believed that Afghans would con
tinue to fight what they regard as a
war between Islam and communism.
"There will be no peace in this
country for quite some time," he
said. "For the Russians it will be Viet
nam ultimately."
The Soviets so far are reported to
control all major cities and towns and
key military installations. These in
clude Kabul, Kunouz, Mazar-i-Sharif,
Bagram airbase, Jalalabad, Kandahar,
Shindand airbase and Flerat.
Soviet troops are becoming less
and less visible in the capital, but
elements of an airborne and a
motorized rifle division reportedly
totaling about 16,000 men are dug in
around the city.
The Soviets continue to airlift
supplies into Kabul, landing an aver
age of about a dozen transport
planes a day at Kabul airport, accoid
ing to reports.
In many areas the Soviets are re
portedly still in the process of putting
themselves into position. In the

southern provincial capital of Kan
dahar, according to diplomatic
sources, Soviet troops recently
moved into newly built army bar
racks. The Afghan soldiers already
living there were moved elsewhere.
Moscow's ambassador here has
been mostly silent about the Soviet
invasion. But in one contact with a
Western ambassador shortly after it,
he claimed that Soviet troops had
come to Kabul only to protect foreign
embassies and maintain order.
Asked about the presence of Soviet
troops elsewhere in the country, he
said they were thereto protect Soviet
economic aid projects.
Meanwhile, the plight of Afghan
refugees on the Pakistani side of the
border is said here to be growing in
creasingly serious. According to one
diplomatic report, the number of re
fugees has grown recently from
about 400,000 to 500,000 and may
soon reach 700,000.
Ihe report said mountain passes
between the two countries are likely
to be snowed in within 30 days, re
sulting in large loss of life for re
fugees trying to flee the fighting in
the Afghan border provinces.
