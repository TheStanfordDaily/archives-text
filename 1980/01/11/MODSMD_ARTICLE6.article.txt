# Legalize-pot program draws limited crowd

A less-than-anticipated audience
of 10 was on hand Wednesday to
hear about the "realistic" provisions
of the California Marijuana Initiative
campaign from Gordon Brownell,
western regional director of the Na
tional Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws (NORML).
If passed, the initiative will repeal
penalties for the private possession,

K JLX INITIATIVE

cultivation and transportation of
marijuana by adults 18yearsorolder,
and will form a state commission to
study the benefits of a legal
marijuana market in California.
The use of marijuana by minors
will remain a felony.
The Stanford Libertarians,coordi
nated by Scott Olmstead, back the
reform. Although Olmstead said he
is a non-user of marijuana, he added
"the government has no right to cur
tail any non-violent activity." As a
libertarian, Olmstead also spoke
against a tax in the event of a legal
market.
Brownell, manager of the signa
ture drive, said the campaign must
collect M 6,000 California voter signa
tures by May 1 to qualify for the
November 1980 general election bal
lot. The goal is MX),000 signatures to

provide a margin of error for invalid
signatures.
Invalid
More than 40 percent of the signa
tures gathered in the 1974 marijuana
legalization drive were invalid,
Brownell said, adding that is an "em
barrassingly high" proportion.
The effort has gathered at least
12,(K>0 signatures.
NORML circulates petitions at

large public functions like rock con
certs and at music and paraphernalia
shops.
According to Brownell, they col
lected 2300 signatures at a recent
Grateful Dead concert. "We also got
a good start at the Rose Bowl and the
Oakland Coliseum.
People who sign must be regis
tered to vote. Accordingly, the cam
paign has launched an extensive
voter registration effort, registering
2000 voters in the past two weeks.
"Because they are alienated from the
legal system, a lot of people who
would not ordinarily register do so to
sign this petition," said Brownell.
Why November?
According to Brownell, NORML is
aiming at the November election be
cause it receives a larger, younger
and more liberal turn-out than the
)une election.
In the conservative election of
1972, a law with essentially the same
provisions, received 34 percent of
the vote.
Another similar version has been
in effect in Alaska for five years.
"There haven't been any problems at
all in Alaska, but since it's hidden
away up there, there hasn't been
much attention paid to it," Brownell
said.
The present law classifies cultiva
tion as a felony and possession and
transportation as misdemeanors.
The initiative, which would be ef
fective immediately if passed, would
remove these penalties.
Two in five have smoked
According to Brownell, 42 percent
of California's adult population has
used marijuana at least once. Ap
proximately 40 percent favor total
legalization, including a legal mar
ket, while 58 percent support some
reform short of legalization.
"The intent when we drafted the
initiative was to have an initiative that
would pass. It doesn't go as far as
many of us would like to see," said
Brownell.
The initiative faces strong opposi
tion. Brownell called comedienne
Carol Burnett, forexample, the Anita
Bryant (an anti-homosexual
crusader) of pot-smoking.
In addition, "law enforcement has
a strong vested interest in keeping
the laws as they stand," he said.
Said Paul Williams, member of the
Santa Clara County campaign,
"Marijuana is here to stay. We need
to make a more realistic attitude.
That is what this is all about.
"Being thrown in jail for marijuana
is more hazardous thah smoking it.
The laws are hazardous to my
health," said Williams, who spent
two weeks in jail when possession
was a felony.
