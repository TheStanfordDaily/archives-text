Phnom Penh â€” The Cambo
dian capital is coming back to
life. For the past year au
thorities have been promoting
this "rebirth," which finally
seems to be taking place.
This progress was felt by
most of the foreign visitors
who came here for cere
monies to mark the first an
niversary ol the "liberation"
from the Khmer Rouge regime
of Pol Pot.
According to the local offi
cials, 140,000 people have to
date been brought back to the
city. But this figure seems a bit
high and most neutral obser
vers estimate the population at
80,000, still a big step forward.
Even more impressive is the
atmosphere here, lust five
months ago a few ragged indi
viduals hung around on the
streets looking lonely and lost
in the big city. Today people
stroll around in groups, the
old-timers gossip on their
doorsteps and children play.
The citizens of Phnom Penh

are once again enjoying the
lifestyle for which they be
came famous: a happy, easy
going existence with lots of
human contact.
Basic necessities are still in
short supply but the situation
has improved, with apparently
only a minority of the people
now going without food.
One year after the over
throw of the Khmer Rouge re
gime, Cambodians are no
longer dying of famine, but
the risks are still as serious,
according to diplomatic
sources here.
But though people are no
longer dying of starvation, the
situation remains extremely
disturbing, the sources said.
It Cambodia would have to
count exclusively on its own
resources, people here would
be without food at the end of
january under the worst cir
cumstances, and in April
under the best.
The dry season harvest
(lanuary to March) is very
scant, and food supplies in the

various provinces will last for
between three weeks to three
months.
The buildings have not
changed much since a year
ago: They still have a seedy,
neglected look about them.
Apart from the main
thoroughfares, most of the
streets remain littered with
rubbish under the blazing sun
of the dry season. The few
puffs of wind waft along the
stink of foul water and general
decay.
But on the wide avenues
traffic has started up again. It
would be incorrect to describe
most of the two-wheelers as
either bicycles or motorbikes
after piecemeal patch-up jobs,
some of them quite ingenious.
Trucks and cars are driven at
breakneck speed. The trucks
come from the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) or
the International Committee
of the Red Cross, while mul
ticolored little Moskvitch and
Lada cars are supplied with
Soviet aid.
Pedestrians here ignore the
sound of horns and cross the
streets as casually as if they
were still in the rice fields,
where almost everybody was
sent under the Khmer Rouge.
On the first anniversary of
"liberation" commemorating
the taking of the city by Viet
namese and Cambodian
forces from the Khmer Rouge
on Jan. 7, 1979, red and yellow
national flags were raised, and
traditional music was played
over loudspeakers in every
district. Trade has resumed at
the Toultumpong and
Monivong Bridge markets,
which are supplied mainly
with products smuggled in
from Thailand and brought

along the Mekong River in
sampans.
Since there is no national
currency, purchases are made
with Vietnamese dongs or
gold. It has been hinted that a
currency will be issued in Ap
ril.
Even foreign visitors now
have the feeling that they
could live in Phnom Penh.
They can walk or drive around
the city without official per
mits.
While the Cambodian sol
diers in the city could hardly
be described as cheerful look
ing, the Vietnamese "bo doi"
(soldiers) are completely
stone-faced except for the oc
casional twitch of the mouth
that might possibly be in
tended as a smile.
