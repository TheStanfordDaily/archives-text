# U.S. allies fail to act against Soviets

London (AP) — America's al
lies have offered many words
in condemnation of the Soviet
move into Afghanistan, but
tew seem willing thus far to
follow the United States
clamping economic or other
sanctions on the communist
superpower.
fhe British and
Washington's other "An«lo"
allies — Canada and Australia
— have gone the furthest in

backing President Carter's
hard-line stand.
But other U.S. partners —
lapan, France and West Ger
many among them — have
been reluctant to move
beyond words, in part because
of such hard realities as the
need for raw materials from
the Soviet Union and because
ot the hope that fragile East-
West detente can still be sal
vaged.
