# Gift enables Music Department to construct long-needed facility

After more than 30 years of increas
ingly cramped housing in the Knoll,
the Department of Music is finally
getting what relief it wants. The $6-
million Braun Music Center, the de
sign of which was authorized by the
Board of Trustees on Dec. 10, is ten
tatively scheduled for completion in
the 1982-83 school year, according to
Cliff Morse, project manager.
The board's decision is significant
in that "it's an outward expression of
the University's support of the de
partment and its acceptance of it as a
part of Stanford thatwill remain,"un
like the Architecture Department
which was terminated in recent
years, said John Planting, administra
tive assistant and project coordinator
for the Music Department.
The Carl F Braun Trust of Alhambra
made the principal gift early last fall
for the new building, to be located in
the vacant area between Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and Storey House.
The center will include clas
srooms, administrative offices, fa
culty and studio areas, rehearsal
facilities and the Music Library. The
Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics, the Archive of
Recorded Sound, some studios,
practice space, offices and audio
visual operations will remain at the
Knoll or in other suitable locations.
Morse, of the Office of Facilities, is
currently heading efforts to com
plete a program for the building's
design, taking into account the
needs and ideas voiced by represen

tatives of the Music Department in
initial planning sessions last week,
and to select an architect from a
group of San Francisco firms for re
commendation to University man
agement early in February.
"We are thrilled and delighted by
the trustees' approval of the plan and
extremely grateful for the generous
gift we've received," said Depart
ment Chairman Albert Cohen in a re
cent press release. University offi
cials would not disclose the exact
amount of the gift, but according to
)ohn Gilliland of the Office of De
velopment, a substantial portion of
the $6 million still must be raised.
"It's going to be a struggle, but the
action of the board shows its deter
mination to see the project com
pleted, which should help create a
climate for successful fundraising,"
Gilliland said.
The Music Department has grown
much more than its facilities have,
since its creation in 1947 at Stanford,
the last major university to establish
one. Currently consisting of 85 un
dergraduates, 65 graduate students,
21 full-time and 22 part-time faculty,
and serving over 700 non-majors a
year who participate in courses, the
department has found the former
home of ex-President Ray Lyman
Wilbur increasingly inadequate.
"We have no soundproofing or
room to expand, and professors find
themselves working out of linen
closets, while unuseable space, such
as bathing areas, is wasted," said
Planting.

To meet increasing space de
mands, the department was given
Harmony House on Lomita Drive
from the late 1950s to 1970, and re
ceived full use of the Knoll in 1969,
which it had previously shared with
other departments.
The Music Department also oc
cupied the Stanford Elementary
School from 1970 until its demolition
in 1974. That same year, several
modular structures were installed
behind the Knoll for instructional
use, according to Planting. Last
summer, another structure was in
stalled in the Knoll courtyard to store
library stacks, but it is expected to be
filled to capacity within five years.
Constance Keffer, a Ph.D. student
in Musicology who participated in
the initial planning sessions for the
proposed Braun center, said the de
partment has been constrained in
the past. "The building is not ear

thquake proof, the space limitations
and security risks of the library are
very great, documents in the Arc
hives of Recorded Sound are not
adequately protected from various
types of damage and teaching assis
tants have no offices."
In many areas, the new music
center will facilitate growth of the
department, according to Planting.
Operating in the name of a Los
Angeles engineer whose daughter
graduated from the Music Depart
ment here in the mid-'7os, the C F
Braun Trust has previously sup
ported other University construction
projects, including the Braun Au
ditorium in the Mudd Chemistry
Building.
