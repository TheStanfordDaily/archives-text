# Career seminars help English majors
## 
### Rose Chan 
"Take computer science and
accounting, even if you are an
English major. Get the
broadest umbrella and make
yourself marketable. It's when
you are tunnelled in one direc
tion and you have no choices
that you are not free."
This is the advice Audrey
Bernfield gives students who
are participating in the English
Department's new series of
seminars on career planning
this quarter.
Designed especially for En
glish majors, the group semi
nars are led by Bernfield, who
has been the career counselor
in the Human Biology Depart
ment here.
"Essentially, I'm developing

a personalized career service
tor one specific department
along the lines of what I do in
human biology," said
Berntield, who started the
human biology's counseling
program three years ago at the
request of Donald Kennedy,
then chairman of the depart
ment.
Bernfield's job is to help stu
dents define goals and expec
tations, to help them realize
their potential and to teach
them ways of gathering infor
mation they need to carry out
plans.
"I force people to get out
and seek information
firsthand," she said. "For
example, I can't tell you what it
feels like to be a journalist; you

have to talk to one."
Bernfield said she believes
the techniques she has used in
her human biology counseling
program are transferable to
other departments. The move
to set up the service in the En
glish Dept. was suggested by
Ellen Lee, a recent graduate
who took the Human Biology
core and had taken advantage
of the counseling.
Bernfield said her proposal
has support from the En
glish Majors Society, and ef
forts have been made to make
students aware of what's going
on.
"Each person's combination
is different, and it remains to
be seen if there is a difference"
between English and Human

Biology majors, said Bernfield.
She helps students to feel at
ease with their college ac
tivities.
"People don't trust their
own instincts. There are
people who think they are here
to punish themselves — that if
you enjoy something, the chal
lenge isn't there and it's not
right."
Bernfield will lead two six
week seminars of eight stu
dents each. The 90-minute
meetings will deal with values,
lifestyles, skills and interests
through informal discussions
and pencil-paper exercises.
Participants will be exposed to
different fields and will make
realistic assessments of job
opportunities.
Specific techniques such as
resume writing and interview
ing will also be covered.
Bernfield said she will be av
ailable to meet with students
individually when needed.
"What you want to do is de
velop a dialogue about op
tions," Bernfield said. "Stan
ford is not a vocational school,
but the skills learned here are
transferable. Learning to write
— to use the English language
— is a skill a lot of people don't
have anymore.
Students who want more in
formation on the new seminar
program may contact the En
glish Department.
