# lowa's corn overflows bins

Kelley, lowa (AP) â€” In the
gnawing cold outside Dan
Froning's grain warehouse,
there is nothing abstract about
the issues raised by President
Jimmy Carter's embargo of
shipments to the Soviet Union.

News analysis

They are as real as the
snow-dusted mounds of corn
heaped on the pavement be
cause the grain elevator is full,
as real as the 50 railroad cars
waiting to be loaded with corn
that may go nowhere.
To the presidential candi
dates seeking support in lo
wa's leadoff (ontest of the 1980
campaign, the embargo is a
subject for one-sided debate.
Almost to a man, they have as
sailed Ihe president's action.
Sen. Edward Kennedy is tel
ling crowds of farmers that all
Carter has done is penalize
them and the taxpayers, with
out really hurting the Russians.
Campaigning for Carter,
Secretary of Agriculture Bob
Bergland counters that it had to
be done, that Soviet troops

might now have stopped with
Afghanistan had the United
States failed to takea firm stand
against Russian expansionism.
Bergland says that would
have been a catastrophe, and
he tells the farmers the gov
ernment will cushion the blow.
He insists government grain
purchases will keep corn
prices at about the level the
crop would have brought
without the embargo.
He never calls it an embargo;
he calls it a suspension. What
ever it's called, Dan Froning
doesn't like it.
"We're sick," he said. He has
about 300,000 bushels of corn
in his elevator and in makeshift
bins by the railroad tracks, 30
miles north of Des Moines. He
ligures much of it would have
wound up in the Soviet Union.
"We started loading railroad
cars and then we quit," he said.
"We've got the supply, but the
demand is gone."
Bergland saicJ prices may
drop for a while, as they did
when grain markets reopened
last week, but maintains that

administration purchase prog
rams will get the price back to
where it would have been
without the embargo.
The embargo certainly is a
liability for Carter in the first
contest of the 1980 presidential
campaign, although Bergland
says farmers will understand
the action and won't oppose
him for it.
lowa is the No. 1 corn state,
and most of the embargoed
grain is corn. That crop is
grown on 108,000 lowa farms.
And seven in 10 lowans have
farm-related jobs.
But it is not clear just how the
embargo will affect the Jan. 21
presidential contest which is
not, after all, an election. The
Democratic decisions will be
made at 1531 neighborhood
political meetings, and organi
zation will be more telling than
issues in determining who
does best.
The process is less volatile
than an ordinary election, and
less likely to be altered by pro
test votes.
