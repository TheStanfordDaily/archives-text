When reflecting on the Ira
nian crisis, I am frequently re
minded of temporary water
weight buildup. Which brings
me to diuretics. It is interesting
that medicine can find drugs
which make the kidneys work
harder. The kidneys don't
seem to be the kind of organs
easily speeded up. You never
see them move, nor do you
hear of kidney exercises.
More generally, because the
body is so finely tuned, it
would seem much easier to
find something that interfered
with bodily processes than
something that accelerated
them. This non-medical obser
vation is conclusively proven
by a conversation I had once
with a medical student.
He said the kidneys work not
by merely extracting from the
blood the material eventually
excreted. They extract close to
100 per cent of the blood's vol
ume, and then reabsorb 99
percent.
Diuretics inhibit the reab
sorption. Q.E.D. This also exp
lains why diuretics are cheap
and available over the counter,
whereas adrenaline, which ac

celerates the heart, is fabul
ously expensive and available
only in the cardiac unit.
Why has man developed his
sense of taste, and in particular
his ability to taste salt? Sweet
foods are generally good for
us, so it's well to recognize
them. Sour and bitter foods are
usually spoiled, so we should
be able to avoid them. But salty
things, such as peanuts, potato
chips and onion rings are de
licious, and probably won't kill
you fast enough to be
evolutionarily significant. Also,
salty foods weren't available
when we were swinging
through the trees. But there
was salty water, and a hominid
who made no distinction bet
ween fresh and salt water was
prevented by kidney failure
from passing on this trait. As a
degree holder in liberal arts,
I'm pleased with this analysis.
Why do primates have nails
instead of claws? As our hands
and fingers developed to the
point of being able to form a
fish, claws would become a
liability because they would
gash the wearer. Primates who
tended to claws probably had

more infections and fewer
offspring than our ancestors
who were developing nails.
Also, claws probably interfered
with the usefulness of the op
posable thumb.
People often point to the in
dependence of the cat as evi
dence that cats were domesti
cated long after dogs.
Another tidbit of evidence is
the number of dog breeds that
need haircuts because they
don't shed. Such a trait in the
wild would produce dogs that
could not see and would trip
over their own fur.
The poodle, perhaps the
most extensively inbred breed,
needs haircuts. Poodles also
show other signs that
evolutionary flaws are creep
ing in which, if poodles we
ren't so dependent on man,
would have been selected
against.
Poodles tend to develop
leaky heart valves. For exam
ple, my previous Faithful Dog,
a miniature poodle, took heart
(and liver) pills for the last
one-third of his life.
In summation, for alI I know,
the foregoing analyses may be
total nonsense.
