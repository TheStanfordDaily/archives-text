Two wrongs don't
After reading Hamad Al-
Baadi's article in the Daily
(Jan. 9) I was stunned and
shocked as to how a student
with such hatred for our coun
try can choose to remain here
to obtain his education. It
seems that he applauds the tak
ing of the diplomats and office
assistants hostage and putting
their lives at bay as giving us "a
taste of our own medicine."
One of those people work
ing in the embassy could have

very well been one of his fellow
Stanford students employed
by the foreign diplomatic
corps. Would he also condemn
their lives for being "guilty" of
crimes against Irani"
I fail to see where threaten
ing the lives of innocent
American citizens can be seen
to be made a "right" in punish
ing a past wrong. If Al-Baadi's
lack of concern for American
lives is so great, perhaps he
should return to Iran where he
can pr rsonally punish the hos
tages "hand for hand,head tor

head."

Alter reading the column by
Hamad Al-Baadi, "America is
Oppressor in Iran," (Daily, Jan.
9) I cannot understand what he
is doing in this country.
I can't imagine myself mov
ing to a country I detested and
siudying in one of its institu
tions, anymore than I can im

agine myself going to the home
of a person I detested (who was
unaware of my feelings when
he offered me his hospitality)
eating his food and insulting
him at his table.
I feel very betrayed by Al-
Baadi and other Iranian stu
dents who come here and ac
cept our warm and generous
hospitality and secretly detest
us. I am much too proud to do
anything like (hat and cannot
understand their lack of per
sonal pride.
