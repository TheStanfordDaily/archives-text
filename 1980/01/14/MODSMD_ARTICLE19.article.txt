## Maple syrup supporters respond to attack 
### 
It was with deep regret and
astonishment and great loss of
respect for the editorial
policies of the Stanford Daily
that we read Allen Cohn's pre
judiced and abusive attack on
the maple syrup industry in the
)an. 10 issue of the Daily. Un
doubtedly the First Amend
ment of the Constitution pro
tects Cohn's right to speak his
mind, but such biased and ir-

... ivere maple syrup to be rendered
inviscid it would descend from its heights of
individuality ...

the de-stickifying of maple
syrup on the untold thousands
of maple syrup factory workers
both in Vermont and Canada
(gnarled New Englanders in
Pendleton shirts and woolen
socks). Were maple syrup to be
rendered inviscid, it would
descend from its heights of in
dividuality and mingle ignomin
iously among those other mun
dane liquid substances such as

responsible journalism is a sor
row to behold.
Nowhere does Cohn directly
address the possible effects of

corn oil, starch and cranberry
juice.
However, maple syrup, un
fortunately, has neither the

nutritional value nor the pretty
blue or red colors of oil, starch
and cranberry juice. Thus, in
any competition with those
other liquids, maple syrup
(due to the loss of its unique
gluttinousity) would inevitably
topple into disuse.
How, therefore, would the
banishment of stickiness from
maple syrup and the sub
sequent effect on maple syrup
sales figures affect maple syrup
factory workers? If Cohn's
dream comes true, factories
will close, spilling thousands of
good-hearted and industrious
workers into the streets. Un
abletoget other jobs, destitute
workers will starve in the
streets of Burlington, Vt. and
Manchester, New Hampshire,
bringing plague and disorder
to our Great Country.

Representatives Against Pre

on maple syrup. How cfearly
we view his use of apparent
humor to insidiously prejudice
and poison the minds of the
United States' intellectual elite
through the pages of the Stan
ford Daily.
The laughter of students as
they read Thursday's opinion
page, not recognizing the vici
ous bias and propaganda they
viewed, mortifies us. Cohn's
column seriously endangers
not only the freedom and fi-

nancial security of maple syrup
workers but the well being of
all of North America.
We feel that it is our moral

and civic obligation to com
ment on this appallingly anti-
American journalistic sham.
The backwoods, rustic simplic
ity and moral rectitude of these
hard-working folks is an exam
ple to us all. In his cruel excuse
for wit, Cohn is destroying the
last vestiges of the American
decency and frugality which
made this country great.
