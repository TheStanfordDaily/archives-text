# Problems with mice grow at Lag, Flo Mo

### Jill Liscom 
Residents of several houses in
Lagunita and Florence Moore Halls
have recently reported increasing
problems with mice in their rooms.
Incidents have been reported
most frequently in Granada in
Lagunita, where residents have
complained of ruined clothing, noise
and decimation.
"You can hear them running
through the walls and plaster falls
down," said junior Karin Northfield,
a Granada resident. "You know you
have mice when you see their drop
pings," she added.
Freshman Andy Barmeyer said the
small brown mice are hard to see.
"They're really fast so you lon't see
them much."
However, Barmeyer said he found
one mouse trapped in his trash can,
and his roommate was awoken by a
mouse crawling across his arm dur
ing the night.
Diane Charnov, a house associate
(RA), said she had 12 mice in her
room.
lunior Steve Smith said a mouse
"woke me up at 1 in the morning
scratching at a piece of wood I had
over my heater."
According to Smith, there were
several mice problems in the dorm
last quarter, beginning in October,
but "this is by far the worst."

Mice have also been a recent prob
lem in Adelfa, said another Lagunita
resident, RA Mike Moradzadeh.
Moradzadeh said about four to five
mice have been found since the be
ginning of this quarter and residents
have been asked to mark on a chart
when a mouse is found.
The Lagunita office is issuing traps
to any students with mice problems,
Moradzadeh said, and "there is a
bounty being given of one beer per
mouse caught" in Adelfa to encour
age the use of traps.
Residents in Granada said the mice
have been seen running out from
radiators in the rooms and are more
attracted to rooms with food in them.
One student said he got rid of the
mice simply by getting rid of unco
vered food in his room, and another
said the mice did not reappear after
she put steel wool around her
radiator.
Problems with mice also began
during finals week last quarter in
Mirlo house in Florence Moore, said
RA )ennifer Davis.
"One woman found droppings in
her desk drawer, so she bought a
trap and caught the mouse," said
Davis. Another woman complained
that a mouse had eaten holes in her
cashmere sweater, Davis added.
She said exterminators came to the
dorm Wednesday to place traps.
