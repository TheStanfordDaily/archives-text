## Iran spells Third World misery 
### 
Hamad Al-Baadi's column ti
tled "America is Oppressor in
Iran" {Daily, )an. $) is
hopelessly misguided.
He makes a valiant effort to
justify his self-imposed ques
tions: 1) Why did the Iranian
students occupy the U.S. em
bassy 2) What are the legal as
pects of the crisis and 3) What
should be done now?
His answer to the first ques
tion is a much regurgitated ac
count of the U.S. past trans
gressions and the Iranians'
reactions to them.
In his second question he
wholeheartedly espouses the

spy sloganeering and he curi
ously describes the purported
legal avenue that the Iranians
will follow. Yet, he denies the
"spies" any due process. (If
they are alleged guilty why is
their trial contingent on the
shah's return?)
He further allows that "the
Iranian government has prom
ised that any American who
will be found innocent . . . will
be released whether the shah
has been returned to Iran or
not." This, in spite of the re
peated conflicting versions be
tween the Iranian "govern
ment" and the Iranian "stu
dents" who have the obvious
and ultimate say.
Although Al-Baadi's column
is overwhelmed with simplifi
cation and hardly concealed
cliches, where he fails misera
bly is in his final analysis of the
repercussions and significance

of the current crisis.
First, he unceremoniously
bunches up a number of
"Third World" countries with
Khomeini's Iran. There is little
in common between the aspi
rations of these countries and
those of the mullahs. Blind
anti-Americanism will not do.
Khomeini and his disciples
have not won a battle. Invading
an embassy is certainly not a
victory against the United
States nor, to use popular Ira
nian nomenclature, a capitula
tion of Satan. What Khomeini
will accomplish is something
that the U.S. military-industrial
complex and the CIA were un
able to do in 35 years: a re
surgence of American
militarism and imperialistic in
terventionism—this time with
overwhelming popular sup
port.
Khomeini will give the pre

text that the U.S. was seeking
for years and the shah could
not deliver: a dynamic pre
sence in the Middle East.
Signs of this already ap
peared with the most recent
example—the "warning" that
the Turkish generals have deli
vered to their political leaders.
The United States has not
and will not "taste what it has
been feeding the Third World
for very, very long." Instead, it
is difficult to fathom the misery
and trouble that the Middle
East and the Third World may
lace as a reaction to the Iranian
shenanigans.
I would only wish that the
martyrdom were confined to
Tehran, Qom and other as
sorted places where all the
yearning for it exists.
