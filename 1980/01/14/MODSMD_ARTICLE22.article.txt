The industrialized nations'
dependence on OPEC oil for
the maintenance of their
economic systems will be the
central economic, military and
political focus of the 1980s.
The United States, Western
Europe, the Soviet empire and
Japan are going to be compet
ing and perhaps fighting for
access to this vital resource.
The response of the United
States in the early 1980s to the
challenge of this situation
could well determine whether
the U.S. remains an economic
and military superpower or be
comes a quasi-European type
power.
The Soviet empire is re
sponding to this challenge with
massive displays of force (e.g.
Afghanistan and Ethiopia); the
Japanese and Western Euro
peans are generally being ob
sequious in accommodating
OPEC and the United States
under Jimmy Carter's "moral
equivalent of war" is flounder
ing without a forceful, cohe
rent strategy.
The 1980 U.S. presidential
election could prove crucial in
determining whether the U.S.
remains a superpower and av
erts a system-shattering depre
ssion in the non-Communist
world.
The U.S. needs a president
who is experienced in interna

tional economics and the uses
of military power. Someone
who is tough and shrewd.
Someone who realizes that the
eras of detente and increas
ingly "freer" trade at America's
expense are (or should be)
over, and can act accordingly.
Of the seven major candi
dates (Carter, Kennedy,
Brown, Reagan, Connally,
Bush and Baker) only one of
these men has these qualifica
tions, that is John Connally.
John Connally is a tough and
shrewd bargainer — and right
now we need such a bargainer
(a "wheeler-dealer" in the
highest sense of the idiom) to
"deal" with the Soviet Union,
OPEC, Japan and Western
Europe. He is highly experi
enced in international
economics and the uses of
military power on a strategic
level.
John Connally has no halo
over his head — but more im
portantly he makes no preten
sions to self-righteousness.
Toughness and shrewdness
are not the attributes of a
"saint." Moreover, he is not
trapped with "saintly" persona
(a la Jimmy Carter.)

John Connally was the ear
liest major political figure to
realize that the eras of detente
and increasingly "freer" trade
at America's expense must
end.
As Chamberlain's learning
too well the "lessons" ,of
World War I led to Munich and
World War 11, let us not learn
too well the "lessons" of Viet
nam and Watergate and dis
count the only candidate who
can, and will if elected, be able
to effectively lead the U.S. in
the coming contest of the wills.
