# Where would they be without Belton?
## 'Other' Cards lose going away, 102-74 
### Rick Ostiller 
Before Saturday night's
Stanford-Washington State
menT"~basketball game, WSU
coach George Raveling won
dered which of two Cardinal
teams would show up to face
his powerful Cougars. Would it
be the "A team" that had
thrashed Arizona, 99-80, the
week before, or the "other
team" which fell to
Washington, 81-50, in Seattle
Thursday?
Well, both teams showed
up. In a classic case of )ekyll-
Hyde, the Cards played the
Cougars even in the first half,
only to give up 61 second-half
points and lose going away,
102-74.
The loss drops Stanford to
1-5 in Pac-10 play and 3-11
overall. Washington State im
proved its record to 3-1 in con
ference and 11-2 on the sea
son.
The Cards started slowly, fal
ling behind 4-0 in less than a
minute. But Kim Belton coun
tered with two dunks, the first
a three-point play and the sec
ond to tie the game at 5-5. From
there Stanford played one of its
best halves of the year as the

Cards never trailed.
Stanford opened its biggest
lead at 29-24 on a jump shot by
Brian Welch with just under
seven minutes left in the first
half. The Cards also led, 37-32,
but the Cougars rallied for nine
of the final 13 points of the
period to forge a 41-41 tie at
intermission.
Coach Raveling would later
say he was not too worried be
cause WSU shot and passed as
poorly as it could, but many of
the 9087 fans were stunned the
Cougars could manage only a
tie in an expected cakewalk.
The primary reasons for their
surprise were the perfor
mances of Belton and Orlando
Ward.
Belton, using an assortment
of spinning, twisting moves,
led all scorers with 14, while
Ward tallied 11, and grabbed
five rebounds. Forward Don
Collins paced WSU with 11.
The key to Stanford's first
half play was defense. The
Cougars try to run opponents
clear out of Friel Court but they
were unable to move against
the Cards. The leader of the
WSU running attack is Collins,
a second-team all-league pick a

year ago and the conference's
top scorer this season at 20.8.
Although Collins stil! col
lected 11 points, most of those
were from the patterned of
fense, not the fast break. Un
fortunately for Stanford, the
second half proved much dif
ferent.
Washington State started
fast breaking at the outset of
the second half and the
Cougars took a 46-43 lead on a
dunk by Collins after a minute
and a half. Belton retaliated
with two foul shots (he hit 7-7
on the night, including a tech
nical) but that proved to be
Stanford's last look at the
game. WSU went on an 8-0 tear,
including three fast breaks,
and Stanford trailed 54-45.
After both teams traded bas
kets, Stanford was dealt a de
vastating blow when Belton
picked up his fourth foul and
had to rest with 15 minutes left.
With no one to cover Collins,
the Cougars' ace scored seven
points in the next two minutes
as WSU ran off an 11-5 streak
and suddenly the game was
history at 67-52.
Later, after the game, Stan
ford head coach Dick Dißiaso

said, "The turning point came
when they got the first five field
goals of the second halt, four
on fast breaks. We had a de
fensive lapse and gave up 26
points in the first eight mi
nutes."
In the final 12 minutes Stan
ford never got closer than 14 as
Collins put on a second half
show, scoring 23 points in the
period and 34 overall to go with
10 rebounds. After the game
Dißiaso praised the 6-6 senior.
"He is so active that he gets
people in foul trouble. He
caused us problems by getting
out on the break so quickly."
This game probably featured
the two best forwards in the
Pac-10, and Belton was not dis
appointing either. The 6-foot-7
senior pumped in 23 points
and yanked down 10 re
bounds. Belton now has
scored 22 or more points in six
of his past seven games, and
his perfect night from the foul
line raised his once woeful
free-throw shooting percen
tage to a respectable 66 per
cent. Dißiaso called it his finest
game ever against WSU and
Raveling was similarly impre
ssed.
"Belton gets as much out of
his physical ability as any player
in this conference or maybe
the nation," said the WSU
coach. "He's just a great
player."
Stanford also got good
games from Ward, who
finished with 12 points and
nine rebounds; Doug
Marty, who contributed 12
points and two assists; and
Doug Barnes, who scored a
career-high 10 points in his first
starting role.
Asked whether Barnes will
continue to start after his per
formance, Dißiaso said,
"We've had trouble at that pos
ition (shooting guard). We
were fine with Welch there but
we have had to move him to
forward. We've had Smith
there and he'll play, but it will
be like tonight for a little
while."
In the final analysis, the de
fense that kept the Cards in the
game during the first half also
put them out of the game dur

ing the second half.
"Washington State got dowi
the court quickly for some eas>
baskets," said Dißiaso. "Wt
got beat on the transition.)
game; there is no doubt wt
were tired."
Stanford was also killed or
the rebounds, 30-18 in the set
ond half and 52-34 for tin
game.
