## Aquawomen tumble ASU to highlight swim action 
### Dianne Cahoon 
When the strains of "All
Now" began to swell and
the participants gingerly pr
anced to the addictive beat, the
circumstances seemed to
strangely mirror those of the
traditionally rain-spattered
ASU-Stanlord football game.
Yet, the swimming yesterday
was not isolated to invading
puddles, as the Cardinal wo
men's swimming team scored
an exhilarating, 63-59 upset
over determined and always
powerful Arizona State Univer
sity at a deluged deCuerre
complex.
With the score tied at 53
points before the last event,
the pool deck erupted into a
full-fledged cheering contest,
unhindered by the unrelenting
downpour nor the few cub
byholed spectators. But the
kickboard-gutter version of the
Indian fanfare forcefully
drowned out Sun Devil
shrieks, just as Kelly Asplund,
the anchor swimmer for the
Cards' 400 yard medley relay
team, smoothly outdistanced
tier opponent.
The miracle failed to
materialize for the men's team,
but they competed admirably
in a 69-44 loss to the

nationally-acclaimed ASU
men.
Yesterday's competition
capped a three-day meet pro
cession, which saw the Card
men casually down NAIA
champions Simon Fraser Uni
versity from Canada Friday and
finish third in the hectic Stan
ford Relays Saturday.
The Stanford women domi
nated the relay meet, while the
California men eked by ASU to
capture first in the men's team
category.
The women obtained a
plethora of AIAW national
qualifying standards yesterday
in their victory quest. Linda
lezek, under the close scrunity
of ABC-Television cameras,
handled the pressure calmly
and led the barrage.
Without the slightest hesita
tion, lezek notched easy wins
in the 200 individual medley
(1:51.42), the 200 free (1:51.42)
and her mainstay, the 200
backstroke (2:03.62).
junior /ena Herrmann also
performed to capacity, record
ing AIAW qualifying marks in
the 200 free (1:52.2, 4th place),
the 200 backstroke (2:07.04,
2nd) and the lead-off leg of the
highlighting free relay with an
official time of 51.1.

Maria Pease turned over
quickly to second-place
finishes in the 1000 free
(10:12.14), the 500 free (4:58.5)
and the 200 butterfly (2:05.98),
which was won by Libby
Beaudet in 2:04.72.
Sprinters Barbara Major,
Carol Procter and Asplund
controlled the short races and
propelled the final relay to its
happy culmination.
Although the men could not
overcome the might of the
blazing Devils, they proved
themselves to be formidable
and never-say-die foes.
Freshman Bari Weick van
quished his home-starters and
galvanized the Cards by stop
ping the ASU elite with the
second-fastest 1000 free time
yet recorded in the nation this
year (9:15.7). His motorized
kick further drove to a close
second in the 500 free
(4:31.63).
Dependable Wade Flemons
broke the pool 100-backstroke
record in the first leg of the 400
medley relay and humbled
ASU with a seering 1:53.57 vic
tory in the 200 back. Senior
co-captain Tom O'Brien con
vincingly locked up a win in the
200 fly (1:51.54).
