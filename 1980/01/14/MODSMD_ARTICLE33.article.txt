# Gymnasts storm toward records
## 
### Dean Eyre 
While the rest of campus was reeling
under a spree of Pacific-born winds and
rain, a whirlwind of gymnastics talent
stormed Maples Pavilion Saturday night,
unleashing a small flood of record perfor
mances.
One of the largest crowds to watch
gymnastics at Stanford, along with televi
sion viewers who caught the action on ca
ble, saw the Cardinal women upset fifth
ranked USC and national title-contending
UCLA dominate men's competition.
In their first meet of the season, lackie
Walker's gymnasts outscored the Trojans
by a 134.70 to 126.00 margin, setting a new
school record. The mark surpassed the
127.25 total earned at last season's NorCal
Conference championships in Berkeley.
Jill Ornstein, USC's top talent, was li
mited to entering just the uneven parallel
bars because of an injured toe. However,
Stanford's Karen Hall was kept out of all
around competition while recovering
from a week of the flu and Trina Wiggins
was forced out of the floor exercise event
with a sprained ankle suffered during vau
lting. Both Cards should be closer to full
strength for this weekend's meets at Cal
Poly-Pomona and Cal State-Long Beach.
Trojan Lori Sloan took top honors in all
around with a 33.50 total, followed by

Stanford's Anne Smith at 33.30 and Julie
Bledsoe with 33.20.
Bledsoe, a freshman from Falmouth,
Maine, scored 8.55 in vaulting, placed
third on balance beam with an 8.30 and
finished second in floor ex with an 8.40
score.
Smith earned third in floor with an 8.30,
tied for second in vaulting with Hall at 8.90,
and garnered top laurels on bars with 8.65.
Hall placed second on beam with 8.35
and won in floor with an 8.80 score.
Sophumore Wiggins came in second on
bars at 8.45 and won the vaulting event
with a 9.50, breaking Smith's school re
cord of 9.15 set last year. The team total of
33.50 in floor ex also set a new school mark
by .2.
"I'm very pleased," beamed Walker
after the meet. "Julie hit every routine and
Anne and Trina had excellent vaults. Jen
nifer Roberts and Kim Crowley did well but
still have room for improvement. Karen
was held back by the flu, but, except for
her one fall, did one of her best beam
routines."
In the men's competition, team honors
went to UCLA with a score of 272.95.
Michigan finished second with 265.85
while Stanford was third with 251.30.
The story of the three-way meet
sounded like a sequel to a fairy tale, enti

tied the Four Bears. Some combination of
the Bruin quartet of Peter Vidmar, Carlos
Spivey, Mark Caso and Mitch Gaylord was
usually in the thick of competition.
The movie "10" may be causing a stir in
the theaters, but the UCLA gymnasts eli
cited quite a response for their nine
point-plus scores.
Vidmar won the all-around competition
with a 55.85 total, as well as placing third
on rings (9.35), second on high bar (9.80),
second on pommel horse (9.25) and win
ning tloor ex with 9.45. Gaylord's perfor
mances, including a spectacular 9.90
showing on high bar, earned him second
place in all around at 55.00.
Stanford's Mike Lee placed sixth with a
52.00 total and earned third on pommel
horse with a 9.15 judging. He also had a
9.25 vault. Other top Card showings in
cluded Tad Bostick's 9.35 vault and 9.00
score in floor ex, Craig Goldman's 9.30
ring routine and Bob Maganini'sB.9s score
in tloor ex. Freshman David Hyde scored
9.10 on high bar and had a 9.20 vault.
"Event by event, we were improving ev
erything except parallel bars and high
bar," Hamada said. Of his all-around men
he commented, "They did pretty well. Tad
improved (since Tuesday) by 1.5 points
and Mike beat his personal record."
