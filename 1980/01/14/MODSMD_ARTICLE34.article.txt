# Women set scoring mark, win twice
## 
### Richard Martinez 
Stanford women's basket
ball team romped over the
University of Pennsylvania in
an inspired home performance
Friday evening and routinely
beat the University of Santa
Clara in Saturday night's
yawner.
The Cards established a new
school scoring record Friday
night, downing the Quakers
101-57. Their Saturday night's
performance was a bit more
mundane but the 75-58 deci
sion was nevertheless another
addition to their ever
important Northern California
Athletic Conference record,
now 2-0.
Penn seemed to be the
scapegoat for all of Stanford's
recent troubles with eastern
teams, as the Quaker squad
played the role Stanford did
while touring the East Coast.
Penn actually held an early lead
and then remained close for
the opening minutes, but the
inevitable occurred when Stan
ford reeled off 18 unanswered
points. This time the Cards

closed the door on the contest
early, leading at halftime 45-29.
Neither the first nor second
team let up as it soon became a
race with the clock and the
scoreboard to reach 100 points
rather than a two-team com
petition. Penn was undoub
tedly one of the Cards' weakest
opponents this season but, re
gardless of the foe, their
execution of the running game
and flawless fundamental team
play restored the team's confi
dence.
Angie Paccione played the
most inspired basketball for
the Cards as she scored 16
points, grabbed five rebounds
and made three steals. Her
level of concentration and in
tensity was evident.
One of the advantages of
playing a one-sided game is
that seldom-used reserves re
ceive valuable playing time.
The starters were pulled early
in the second half and the sec
ond team turned in a shining
performance. Freshman Kim
Kupferer turned in her finest

effort of the year with 13
points. Beth Boylan added
eight with her patented long
range set-shots. Sue Thomas
scored four points and added
six rebounds, Mary Osborne
contributed five points and
boards, while Leigh Pederson
matched Osborne in rebound
ing along with six points.
It was a true team effort with
balanced scoringand rebound
ing. Everyone scored but no
one had more than 16 points.
The Cards outrebounded the
Quakers by the embarrassing
margin of 63-28. Leading Stan
ford in that department was
Jeanne Ruark with eight. Point
guards Denise McCuire and
Debi Core both had excellent
nights directing the fast break
and passing off for seven and
five assists, respectively.
Saturday evening's contest
against the Broncos was
another in the series of dull
games between the two teams.
Santa Clara slowed the tempo
of the game to a snail's pace,
knowing itself unable to run

with the Cards.
The strategy did not work,
however, as Stanford, now 9-8
overall, dominated the boards.
Ruark and Paccione led the
team with 11 and seven, re
spectively, while Meg Metzger
scored 11 points.
Stanford faces San Jose State
Wednesday evening in what

could prove to be the battle tor
the league title. The Spartans
have yet to lose a league game
in the two years of the league's
existence. With their running
game and rebounding strength
primed, the Cards appear to
have as good a shot as anyone
to knock off the defending
league champs.

tensity was evident.
One of the advantages of
playing a one-sided game is
that seldom-used reserves re
ceive valuable playing time.
The starters were pulled early
in the second half and the sec
ond team turned in a shining
performance. Freshman Kim
Kupferer turned in her finest

effort of the year with 13
points. Beth Boylan added
eight with her patented long
range set-shots. Sue Thomas
scored four points and added
six rebounds, Mary Osborne
contributed five points and
boards, while Leigh Pederson
matched Osborne in rebound
ing along with six points.
It was a true team effort with
balanced scoringand rebound
ing. Everyone scored but no
one had more than 16 points.
The Cards outrebounded the
Quakers by the embarrassing
margin of 63-28. Leading Stan
ford in that department was
Jeanne Ruark with eight. Point
guards Denise McCuire and
Debi Core both had excellent
nights directing the fast break
and passing off for seven and
five assists, respectively.
Saturday evening's contest
against the Broncos was
another in the series of dull
games between the two teams.
Santa Clara slowed the tempo
of the game to a snail's pace,
knowing itself unable to run

with the Cards.
The strategy did not work,
however, as Stanford, now 9-8
overall, dominated the boards.
Ruark and Paccione led the
team with 11 and seven, re
spectively, while Meg Metzger
scored 11 points.
Stanford faces San Jose State
Wednesday evening in what

could prove to be the battle tor
the league title. The Spartans
have yet to lose a league game
in the two years of the league's
existence. With their running
game and rebounding strength
primed, the Cards appear to
have as good a shot as anyone
to knock off the defending
league champs.
