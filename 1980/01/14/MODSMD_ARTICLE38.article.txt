# Ali tabbed as AP's 'greatest'

Muhammad Ali, a boxing champion whose
renown transcended the sport, has been named
the Athlete of the Decade for the 1970s by The
Associated Press.
"The athlete of the decade . . . better than
anybody? I'm so honored," saicJ Ali, no stranger
to either honors or controversy.
Ali was a superstar during the 1960s — golfer
Arnold Palmer was the Athlete of that Decade —
when he won an Olympic gold medal and the
world heavyweight championship. But he
ended the '60s stripped of the title and in exile
from boxing because of his conviction for refus
ing to accept military draft. He faced a five-year
prison term.
His selection as Athlete of the Decade was
made by a panel of AP sports writers.
At the close of the '70s Ali was a reti red champ
ion, having won back the title twice, and was the
most written about, talked about, argued about,
photographed athlete in history. He was the ac
quaintance of kings and statesmen, champion

of the underdog to some people, a loudmouth
to others, a draft dodger to still others.
In a decade when television really became
king in the world of sports, Ali was a TV star. In a
decade when sports purses, prizes and salaries
soared, Ali grossed more than $45 million from
fighting.
"I hope in the next 10 years I can do some
thing equal in another field," Ali said. "Seeing
what kind of new thing I can make happen now,
that will be fun."
One thing Ali says won't happen in the 1980s,
despite reports to the contrary, is a return to
boxing.
"What do you think would happen if I came
back?" Ali asked. "It would be tough and you
don't have anything to prove," was the reply
from the interviewer. "That's right," said Ali,
who will be 38 next Thursday. "You said the
word. I have nothing else to prove."
Whatever path Ali follows in the '80s, it is
doubtful he can match the mark he made on
sports in the last decade.
