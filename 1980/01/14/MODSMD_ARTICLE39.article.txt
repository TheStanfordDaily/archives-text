U.S.S.R. vetoes Iran sanctions
United Nations — The Soviet Union last night
killed America's request for economic sanctions
against Iran, casting its second veto in the U.N.
Security Council within a week.
The 15-member council voted 10-2 with two
abstentions to approve the sanctions, sought by
the United States to press for the release of some
50 Americans held since Nov. 4 at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran by Moslem militants. China did not par
ticipate in the voting. Mexico and Bangladesh
abstained.
In the public debate before the vote, U.S. Am
bassador Donald McHenry urged approval of the
sanctions to show "the world is determined to see
the hostages freed."
He noted the council delayed action Friday and
Saturday to explore any possibility that messages
from Iran might propose the release of the hos
tages.
"But our efforts at clarification have come to a
frustrating end. It would be . . . irresponsible for
us to delay any longer in discharging our obliga
tions," the ambassador said.
Voting for the resolution were the United
States, Britain, France, Portugal, ]amaica, Norway,
Zambia, Tunisia, Niger and the Philippines. East
Germany joined the Soviet Union in voting against
the measure.
Last week, the Soviet Union vetoed a Security
Council resolution opposing the Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan.
Afghan rebels resist Marxists
Thousands Hocked to mosques yesterday in Af
ghanistan's capital of Kabul to mourn political
prisoners killed during the previous Marxist re
gime. But Moslem Afghan rebels, who fought that
regime, renewed their struggle in the countryside
against the Marxist government that took power
last month.
Diplomatic sources in Pakistan's capital of Is
lamabad said rebels were putting up stiff resis
tance to Soviet troops in the eastern portion of
Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan, even
as the new government scheduled special services
for the dead.
Newspapers in Pakistan carried reports of heavy
fighting throughout Afghanistan's countryside,
some near the mountainous Central Asian nation's
northern border with the Soviet Union.
One report said Soviet troops had killed 4000
Afghans since they began moving into the country
Christmas Eve and helped overthrow Hafizullah
Amin's government three days later. Neither re
ports about the fighting nor the casualty figures
could be confirmed independently.
The sources in Islamabad said Chinese Foreign
Minister Huang Hua will begin an official tour-day
visit to Pakistan on Friday.
Just-concluded talks between U.S. Defense Sec
retary Harold Brown and Chinese officials focused
on stepping up aid to Pakistan to improve its de
tense capabilities. Pakistan is at Afghanistan's
eastern and southern borders.
Brown, heading home, said yesterday in Tokyo
that China, like the United States, was prepared to
help Pakistan protect itself against further military
moves by the Soviets, who now have up to 100,000

troops in Afghanistan.
Iran minister to allow U.N. talks
Tehran, Iran — In an apparent policy switch,
Iran's Foreign Minister yesterday said he was wil
ling to have the United Nations discuss the issue of
American hostages in Tehran — but only if it con
sidered at the same time the return of the deposed
shah and his money.
It was clear the minister, Sadegh Chotbzadeh,
would not go along with discussion of the hos
tages except in concurrence with the other sub
jects. Iran, he said, would consider "void" any
decision taken by the world body if it were not
based on acceptance of Iranian demands that the
shah and his money be returned.
The request, contained in a letter sent to U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, asked that the
matter be taken up by the U.N. General Assembly,
which so far has not been involved in the U.S.-Iran
situation.
"The U.N. General Assembly has been asked to
announce its views concurrently on three issues:
1. Extradition of the deposed shah, 2. Returning
the property of the deposed shah and 3. The hos
tages," said a statement carried by Tehran news
papers in describing the request.
Soviet air office in N.Y. bombed
New York — Three persons were injured yester
day in a bomb explosion at the mid-Manhattan
offices of the Soviet Airline Aeroflot, police said.
A man chased from the scene and caught by
police was being questioned.
More than a half hour after the blast, an
anonymous caller, who identified himself as a
member of the militant ]ewish Defense League,
told the Associated Press the group had "planted
the bomb at Aeroflot" to protest the imprison
ment of Soviet dissidents.
Fifteen minutes after that, a man identifying
himself as a member of Omega 7 told the As
sociated Press that the anti-Castro terrorist group
was responsible for the Aeroflot explosion as a
show of "solidarity with the people of Cuba and
Afghanistan in their struggle against Soviet im
perialism."
U.S. to discuss Olympic boycott
Washington — The Carter administration, step
ping up its campaign of reprisals against the Soviet
Union, sent Deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to Europe yesterday to consult with
U.S. allies about a possible boycott of the Olympic
Games and joint military and economic aid to
Pakistan.
Christopher planned to stop in London, Rome,
Paris and Bonn, to meet with other European lead
ers. Then he will go to Brussels fora session of the
North Atlantic Council at which the allied govern
ments will consider a rumber of retaliatory moves
against the Soviet Union for its intervention in
Afghanistan.
"I think we can expect a strong, united western
response against the Soviet invasion," Christ
opher told reporters.
He said "close coordination" was required both
in aiding Pakistan and in limiting supplies of high

technology to the Soviet Union. Christopher also
said he expected the allies to support the with
holding ot 17 million metric tons ot American grain
shipments by not stepping up their own sales to
make up the shortfall.
President )immy Carter ordered the restrictions
on technology and grain and is clearing the way for
a resumption of military aid to Pakistan in retalia
tion for the Soviet move into Afghanistan.
Carter considers Iran blockade
Washington — The Carter administration is
stepping up preparations to mine or blockade the
Persian Gulf in case the president wants to exer
cise either option, government sources said last
night.
Either mining the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf or
sealing up that waterway by a blockade would
cripple Iran's economy. The gult is the main
lifeline for food and other supplies going into Iran,
as well as the exit passage for Iranian oil, the coun
try's main source of wealth.
From a diplomatic standpoint, either mining or
blockading the gulf would carry the risk of the
Iranian militants hurting or killing the 50 American
hostages held at gunpoint in Tehran.
From a military standpoint, there are also risks.
But President |immy Carter could take them if dip
lomacy fails and other economic pressures fail.
Defense Secretary Harold Brown said as much
yesterday on Issues and Answers (ABC-TV).
Asked about the prospects for a blockade,
Brown said, "Specifically, we cannot rule out the
options of cutting off Iranian imports by one
means or another," though he added the pres
sures by the international community were "much
preferable."
Brown accuses Carter of 'hiding'
Manchester, N.H. — Calitornia Gov. Jerry Brown
said yesterday that President Jimmy Carter is hid
ing in the White House, running a "bunker" cam
paign and hypocritically and cynically playing poli
tics with the crises in Afghanistan and Iran.
"What he is doing is to get his face and his image
on television every night to affect the lowa cau
cuses, not the Soviet Union," Brown said. "He's
careening down the path with a lot of actions,
helter-skelter, here and there, without any cohe
rent program."
He came from lowa, where aides said he
thought he did well in a modified debate Saturday
with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Vice
President Walter Mondale, proxy for the presi
dent. Brown said Mondale's defense of the Carter
administration was "pathetic" and that Kennedy
had said little of any substance.
The most recent lowa poll, published Friday in
the Des Moines Register, gives Brown only 4 per
cent support — contrasted to 57 percent for Carter
and 25 percent for Kennedy.
Today's weather
Variable clouds and cooler today through to
morrow with a chance of showers. Highs today
and tomorrow mid 50s to low 60s. Lows tonight 40

U.S.S.R. vetoes Iran sanctions
United Nations — The Soviet Union last night
killed America's request for economic sanctions
against Iran, casting its second veto in the U.N.
Security Council within a week.
The 15-member council voted 10-2 with two
abstentions to approve the sanctions, sought by
the United States to press for the release of some
50 Americans held since Nov. 4 at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran by Moslem militants. China did not par

abstained.
In the public debate before the vote, U.S. Am

sanctions to show "the world is determined to see
the hostages freed."
He noted the council delayed action Friday and
Saturday to explore any possibility that messages
from Iran might propose the release of the hos

"But our efforts at clarification have come to a

us to delay any longer in discharging our obliga

Voting for the resolution were the United
States, Britain, France, Portugal, ]amaica, Norway,
Zambia, Tunisia, Niger and the Philippines. East
Germany joined the Soviet Union in voting against
the measure.
Last week, the Soviet Union vetoed a Security

Afghan rebels resist Marxists
Thousands Hocked to mosques yesterday in Af
ghanistan's capital of Kabul to mourn political
prisoners killed during the previous Marxist re

regime, renewed their struggle in the countryside
against the Marxist government that took power
last month.
Diplomatic sources in Pakistan's capital of Is
lamabad said rebels were putting up stiff resis
tance to Soviet troops in the eastern portion of
Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan, even
as the new government scheduled special services
for the dead.
Newspapers in Pakistan carried reports of heavy
fighting throughout Afghanistan's countryside,
some near the mountainous Central Asian nation's
northern border with the Soviet Union.
One report said Soviet troops had killed 4000
Afghans since they began moving into the country
Christmas Eve and helped overthrow Hafizullah
Amin's government three days later. Neither re
ports about the fighting nor the casualty figures
could be confirmed independently.
The sources in Islamabad said Chinese Foreign
Minister Huang Hua will begin an official tour-day
visit to Pakistan on Friday.
Just-concluded talks between U.S. Defense Sec

Iran minister to allow U.N. talks
Tehran, Iran — In an apparent policy switch,
Iran's Foreign Minister yesterday said he was wil

It was clear the minister, Sadegh Chotbzadeh,

U.S. to discuss Olympic boycott
Washington — The Carter administration, step
ping up its campaign of reprisals against the Soviet
Union, sent Deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to Europe yesterday to consult with
U.S. allies about a possible boycott of the Olympic
Games and joint military and economic aid to
Pakistan.
Christopher planned to stop in London, Rome,
Paris and Bonn, to meet with other European lead
ers. Then he will go to Brussels fora session of the
North Atlantic Council at which the allied govern
ments will consider a rumber of retaliatory moves
against the Soviet Union for its intervention in
Afghanistan.
"I think we can expect a strong, united western
response against the Soviet invasion," Christ
opher told reporters.
He said "close coordination" was required both
in aiding Pakistan and in limiting supplies of high

technology to the Soviet Union. Christopher also
said he expected the allies to support the with
holding ot 17 million metric tons ot American grain
shipments by not stepping up their own sales to
make up the shortfall.
President )immy Carter ordered the restrictions
on technology and grain and is clearing the way for
a resumption of military aid to Pakistan in retalia

Carter considers Iran blockade
Washington — The Carter administration is
stepping up preparations to mine or blockade the
Persian Gulf in case the president wants to exer
cise either option, government sources said last
night.
Either mining the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf or
sealing up that waterway by a blockade would
cripple Iran's economy. The gult is the main
lifeline for food and other supplies going into Iran,
as well as the exit passage for Iranian oil, the coun
try's main source of wealth.
From a diplomatic standpoint, either mining or
blockading the gulf would carry the risk of the

U.S. to discuss Olympic boycott
Washington — The Carter administration, step
ping up its campaign of reprisals against the Soviet
Union, sent Deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher to Europe yesterday to consult with
U.S. allies about a possible boycott of the Olympic
Games and joint military and economic aid to
Pakistan.
Christopher planned to stop in London, Rome,
Paris and Bonn, to meet with other European lead
ers. Then he will go to Brussels fora session of the
North Atlantic Council at which the allied govern
ments will consider a rumber of retaliatory moves
against the Soviet Union for its intervention in
Afghanistan.
"I think we can expect a strong, united western
response against the Soviet invasion," Christ
opher told reporters.
He said "close coordination" was required both
in aiding Pakistan and in limiting supplies of high

technology to the Soviet Union. Christopher also
said he expected the allies to support the with
holding ot 17 million metric tons ot American grain
shipments by not stepping up their own sales to
make up the shortfall.
President )immy Carter ordered the restrictions
on technology and grain and is clearing the way for
a resumption of military aid to Pakistan in retalia
tion for the Soviet move into Afghanistan.
Carter considers Iran blockade
Washington — The Carter administration is
stepping up preparations to mine or blockade the
Persian Gulf in case the president wants to exer
cise either option, government sources said last
night.
Either mining the sea lanes of the Persian Gulf or
sealing up that waterway by a blockade would
cripple Iran's economy. The gult is the main
lifeline for food and other supplies going into Iran,
as well as the exit passage for Iranian oil, the coun
try's main source of wealth.
From a diplomatic standpoint, either mining or
blockading the gulf would carry the risk of the
Iranian militants hurting or killing the 50 American
hostages held at gunpoint in Tehran.
From a military standpoint, there are also risks.
But President |immy Carter could take them if dip
lomacy fails and other economic pressures fail.
Defense Secretary Harold Brown said as much
yesterday on Issues and Answers (ABC-TV).
Asked about the prospects for a blockade,
Brown said, "Specifically, we cannot rule out the
options of cutting off Iranian imports by one
means or another," though he added the pres
sures by the international community were "much
preferable."
Brown accuses Carter of 'hiding'
Manchester, N.H. — Calitornia Gov. Jerry Brown
said yesterday that President Jimmy Carter is hid
ing in the White House, running a "bunker" cam
paign and hypocritically and cynically playing poli
tics with the crises in Afghanistan and Iran.
"What he is doing is to get his face and his image
on television every night to affect the lowa cau
cuses, not the Soviet Union," Brown said. "He's
careening down the path with a lot of actions,
helter-skelter, here and there, without any cohe
rent program."
He came from lowa, where aides said he
thought he did well in a modified debate Saturday
with Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Vice
President Walter Mondale, proxy for the presi
dent. Brown said Mondale's defense of the Carter
administration was "pathetic" and that Kennedy
had said little of any substance.
The most recent lowa poll, published Friday in
the Des Moines Register, gives Brown only 4 per
cent support — contrasted to 57 percent for Carter
and 25 percent for Kennedy.
Today's weather
Variable clouds and cooler today through to

U.S.S.R. vetoes Iran sanctions
United Nations — The Soviet Union last night
killed America's request for economic sanctions
against Iran, casting its second veto in the U.N.
Security Council within a week.
The 15-member council voted 10-2 with two
abstentions to approve the sanctions, sought by
the United States to press for the release of some
50 Americans held since Nov. 4 at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran by Moslem militants. China did not par
ticipate in the voting. Mexico and Bangladesh
abstained.
In the public debate before the vote, U.S. Am
bassador Donald McHenry urged approval of the
sanctions to show "the world is determined to see
the hostages freed."
He noted the council delayed action Friday and
Saturday to explore any possibility that messages
from Iran might propose the release of the hos
tages.
"But our efforts at clarification have come to a
frustrating end. It would be . . . irresponsible for
us to delay any longer in discharging our obliga
tions," the ambassador said.
Voting for the resolution were the United
States, Britain, France, Portugal, ]amaica, Norway,
Zambia, Tunisia, Niger and the Philippines. East
Germany joined the Soviet Union in voting against
the measure.
Last week, the Soviet Union vetoed a Security
Council resolution opposing the Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan.
Afghan rebels resist Marxists
Thousands Hocked to mosques yesterday in Af
ghanistan's capital of Kabul to mourn political
prisoners killed during the previous Marxist re
gime. But Moslem Afghan rebels, who fought that
regime, renewed their struggle in the countryside
against the Marxist government that took power
last month.
Diplomatic sources in Pakistan's capital of Is
lamabad said rebels were putting up stiff resis
tance to Soviet troops in the eastern portion of
Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan, even
as the new government scheduled special services
for the dead.
Newspapers in Pakistan carried reports of heavy
fighting throughout Afghanistan's countryside,
some near the mountainous Central Asian nation's
northern border with the Soviet Union.
One report said Soviet troops had killed 4000
Afghans since they began moving into the country
Christmas Eve and helped overthrow Hafizullah
Amin's government three days later. Neither re
ports about the fighting nor the casualty figures
could be confirmed independently.
The sources in Islamabad said Chinese Foreign
Minister Huang Hua will begin an official tour-day
visit to Pakistan on Friday.
Just-concluded talks between U.S. Defense Sec
retary Harold Brown and Chinese officials focused
on stepping up aid to Pakistan to improve its de
tense capabilities. Pakistan is at Afghanistan's
eastern and southern borders.
Brown, heading home, said yesterday in Tokyo
that China, like the United States, was prepared to
help Pakistan protect itself against further military
moves by the Soviets, who now have up to 100,000

troops in Afghanistan.
Iran minister to allow U.N. talks
Tehran, Iran — In an apparent policy switch,
Iran's Foreign Minister yesterday said he was wil
ling to have the United Nations discuss the issue of
American hostages in Tehran — but only if it con
sidered at the same time the return of the deposed
shah and his money.
It was clear the minister, Sadegh Chotbzadeh,
would not go along with discussion of the hos
tages except in concurrence with the other sub
jects. Iran, he said, would consider "void" any
decision taken by the world body if it were not
based on acceptance of Iranian demands that the
shah and his money be returned.
The request, contained in a letter sent to U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim, asked that the
matter be taken up by the U.N. General Assembly,
which so far has not been involved in the U.S.-Iran
situation.
"The U.N. General Assembly has been asked to
announce its views concurrently on three issues:
1. Extradition of the deposed shah, 2. Returning
the property of the deposed shah and 3. The hos
tages," said a statement carried by Tehran news
papers in describing the request.
Soviet air office in N.Y. bombed
New York — Three persons were injured yester
day in a bomb explosion at the mid-Manhattan
offices of the Soviet Airline Aeroflot, police said.
A man chased from the scene and caught by
police was being questioned.
More than a half hour after the blast, an
anonymous caller, who identified himself as a
member of the militant ]ewish Defense League,
told the Associated Press the group had "planted
the bomb at Aeroflot" to protest the imprison
ment of Soviet dissidents.
Fifteen minutes after that, a man identifying
himself as a member of Omega 7 told the As
sociated Press that the anti-Castro terrorist group
was responsible for the Aeroflot explosion as a
show of "solidarity with the people of Cuba and
Afghanistan in their struggle against Soviet im
perialism."
