# Rains flood buildings
## 
### 
Heavy rain here yesterday
caused flooding and leaking in
buildings across the campus, in
cluding Dinkelspiel Auditorium
and several residences.
Service Operations received
more than 50 emergency calls yes
terday, mostly about leaky roofs
and clogged drains, according to
telecommunications operator
Peggy Flaherty.
The worst problem was in the
Donner wing of the Stern Hall
basement, said Flaherty, where
water flooded about 15 rooms in
the basement, including storage
rooms containing cardboard
boxes.
According to Susanna Wong,
assistant food service manager at
Wilbur Hall, there was also flood
ing in the Wilbur basement,
caused by clogged ditches in the
ramp leading into the basement.
Although water entered the

food service storage, Wong said
there was no damage because the
water was only one inch deep and
the food is stored on racks at least
thiee inches above the ground.
In Durand House, leaking was
reported in about five residents'
rooms, according to housing as
sociate (RA) Gail Blumberg.
Blumberg said water was seeping
in through the roofs of second
floor rooms located underneath
an overhang, and causing the
wood floors to swell. In one
room, water was coming in
through a light fixture, she said.
Other weather-related inci
dents were also reported across
campus yesterday, including a
minor power shortage in Escon
dido Village and a tree blown
down at Campus Drive and Serra
Street, temporarily blocking one
lane of traffic.
