# Graduate building new economy for Iran
## 
### jane West 
While the focus of international af
fairs rests on the fate of 50 American
hostages in Tehran and the increas
ing tensions in neighboring Af
ghanistan, one Stanford graduate is
concentrating on ameliorating his
country's economic state.
Ali Reza Nadegh-Nobari, the gov
ernor of the Central Bank of Iran and
a recipient of two masters degrees
from the University, is currently de
voting his attentions to reviving the
beleaguered Iranian economic sys
tem.
According to his 27-year-old wife
Cheryl, who is living in the Stanford
area, Nobari is rearranging the Ira
nian economy by focusing on funds
redirected from urban to rural sec
tors of the nation. Instead of thinking
of the increase in OPEC prices, he is
occupied with the allocation of more
farm funds and seeds into the hands
of the small farmers, she said.
Consistent with the theme of the
Iranian revolution, Nobari has said
he does not wish Iran to be depen
dent on foreign countries. According
to an article in the New York Times,
Nobari had also hoped for a swift
solution to the hostage crisis when
he talked to the students holding the
U.S. Embassy at the beginning of the
seizure.
Since that time, Nobari has been
involved in a project documenting
the financial affairs of the shah dur
ing his regime.
"Nobari and Bani-Sadr, Iran's fi
nance minister, believe the most
forceful pressure on President
(Jimmy) Carter to turn over the shah
for trial in Iran would be an American
public aroused by an accounting of
what the Iran leader and his family
did," said Walter Pincus of the
Washington Post in a Dec. 9, 1979
article.
"By calling for an international tri
bunal Nobari had hoped to find a way
out of the hostage crisis," said
Lenny Siegel of the Pacific Studies
Center, an American foreign policy
information center. "Carter refused

to go along. There were no conciliat
ory offers."
Siegel said, "Nobari was shot
down by his own government. He
had his wings clipped politically by
the way the crisis developed."
But Nobari, who was sent to the
Central Bank when Bani-Sadr be
came the finance minister, "is still
running one of the key economic in
stitutions" in the country, according
to Siegel, and is strongly depended
upon because other men in Iran do
not have a sense of the economy.
Nobari's graduate work here cor
relates directly to his current duties

in Iran. He enrolled at the University
in 1971 after attending college in Iran
and earning an engineer certificate at
the Ecole Politechnique and a mas
ters degree in mathematics from the
Sorbonne.
At the University here, Nobari re
ceived his masters in economics in
1973 and a masters in operations re
search in 1974. He is currently on a
leave of absence from the
Engineering-Economic Systems De
partment where he is doing docto
rate work.
Nobari's wife said her husband en
joyed the University very much and

he expects to return to finish his de
gree here.
Many professors in the three de
partments here said it was difficult to
recollect Nobari because so many
graduate students pass through the
University each year.
Prof. Gerald Lieberman, of the
Operations Research Department
said, "The only way I would re
member him would be if he was very,
very good or very, very bad, and he
was neither."
Associate Prof. Edison Tse, of the
Engineering-Economic Systems De-


Recipient of two master's degrees here, Ali Reza Nadegh-Nobari currently serves in the Iranian government
partment, remembered him as being
persistent. "He told me he would
have a high position when he got
back."
Siegel said that in his relations with
the banker, Nobari appeared dedi
cated and serious. "He was a very
hard worker."
After taking his leave of absence
from Stanford, Nobari wrote a book
called Iran Erupts in both Persian and
English.
"He threw himself into the study of
what was going on in Iran," Siegel
said.
In 1979, Nobari wefit to Iran and
edited Islamic Revolution, a periodi
cal, and helped Bani-Sadr on
economics until becoming the gov
ernor of the Central Bank.

forceful pressure on President
(Jimmy) Carter to turn over the shah
for trial in Iran would be an American
public aroused by an accounting of
what the Iran leader and his family
did," said Walter Pincus of the
Washington Post in a Dec. 9, 1979
article.
"By calling for an international tri
bunal Nobari had hoped to find a way
out of the hostage crisis," said
Lenny Siegel of the Pacific Studies
Center, an American foreign policy
information center. "Carter refused

to go along. There were no conciliat
ory offers."
Siegel said, "Nobari was shot
down by his own government. He
had his wings clipped politically by
the way the crisis developed."
But Nobari, who was sent to the
Central Bank when Bani-Sadr be
came the finance minister, "is still
running one of the key economic in
stitutions" in the country, according
to Siegel, and is strongly depended
upon because other men in Iran do
not have a sense of the economy.
Nobari's graduate work here cor
relates directly to his current duties

in Iran. He enrolled at the University
in 1971 after attending college in Iran
and earning an engineer certificate at
the Ecole Politechnique and a mas
ters degree in mathematics from the
Sorbonne.
At the University here, Nobari re
ceived his masters in economics in
1973 and a masters in operations re
search in 1974. He is currently on a
leave of absence from the
Engineering-Economic Systems De
partment where he is doing docto
rate work.
Nobari's wife said her husband en
joyed the University very much and

he expects to return to finish his de
gree here.
Many professors in the three de
partments here said it was difficult to
recollect Nobari because so many
graduate students pass through the
University each year.
Prof. Gerald Lieberman, of the
Operations Research Department
said, "The only way I would re
member him would be if he was very,
very good or very, very bad, and he
was neither."
Associate Prof. Edison Tse, of the
Engineering-Economic Systems De-


Recipient of two master's degrees here, Ali Reza Nadegh-Nobari currently serves in the Iranian government
partment, remembered him as being
persistent. "He told me he would
have a high position when he got
back."
Siegel said that in his relations with
the banker, Nobari appeared dedi
cated and serious. "He was a very
hard worker."
After taking his leave of absence
from Stanford, Nobari wrote a book
called Iran Erupts in both Persian and
English.
"He threw himself into the study of
what was going on in Iran," Siegel
said.
In 1979, Nobari wefit to Iran and
edited Islamic Revolution, a periodi
cal, and helped Bani-Sadr on
economics until becoming the gov
ernor of the Central Bank.
While the focus of international af
fairs rests on the fate of 50 American
hostages in Tehran and the increas
ing tensions in neighboring Af
ghanistan, one Stanford graduate is
concentrating on ameliorating his
country's economic state.
Ali Reza Nadegh-Nobari, the gov
ernor of the Central Bank of Iran and
a recipient of two masters degrees
from the University, is currently de
voting his attentions to reviving the
beleaguered Iranian economic sys
tem.
According to his 27-year-old wife
Cheryl, who is living in the Stanford
area, Nobari is rearranging the Ira
nian economy by focusing on funds
redirected from urban to rural sec
tors of the nation. Instead of thinking
of the increase in OPEC prices, he is
occupied with the allocation of more
farm funds and seeds into the hands
of the small farmers, she said.
Consistent with the theme of the
Iranian revolution, Nobari has said
he does not wish Iran to be depen
dent on foreign countries. According
to an article in the New York Times,
Nobari had also hoped for a swift
solution to the hostage crisis when
he talked to the students holding the
U.S. Embassy at the beginning of the
seizure.
Since that time, Nobari has been
involved in a project documenting
the financial affairs of the shah dur
ing his regime.
"Nobari and Bani-Sadr, Iran's fi
nance minister, believe the most
forceful pressure on President
(Jimmy) Carter to turn over the shah
for trial in Iran would be an American
public aroused by an accounting of
what the Iran leader and his family
did," said Walter Pincus of the
Washington Post in a Dec. 9, 1979
