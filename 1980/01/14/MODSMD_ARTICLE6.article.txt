## Firey American response likely surprised Soviets, perhaps world 
### Victor Goetz (Second of a series) 
Most observers here agree that the
Russians were probably surprised by
the intensity of American response
to their invasion of Afghanistan.
"It's never been too clear in ad
vance how the U.S. would react in a
given situation," said History Prof.
Alexander Dallin. "We may be over
reacting, but if that sets a pattern for
future actions, it's all right."

News analysis

Dallin, among others, questions
just how effective our response has
been, however. Dallin said he
thought the termination of grain and
advanced technology sales to the
Soviets was a reasonable reaction.
"But," he added, "things have gone
beyond that. The mood is pretty ugly
right now and it's getting rather ex
treme."
The termination of the U.S. consu
late in Kiev, which Dallin said rep

resented a symbolic presence as well
as a source of information, "hurts us
more than it hurts them.
"The same with the Olympics," he
added. "I think it would be a mistake
to have us pull out."
"So far we've engaged in words,
but rather modest behavior," said
Hoover Peace Fellow Barton Berns
tein. He pointed out that grain export
restrictions will probably hurt the
Soviets, but he agreed that removal
of the consular staff in Kiev hurts us
just as much. In addition, he said the
shelving of SALT II by President
jimmy Carter is just a realization that
it would never pass anyway.
"It's difficult to see how these
measures are anything more than
shows of displeasure," said Vice
President and Provost Donald Ken
nedy. "It's hard to say what real rest
raining effects the current policies
will have."
What the Russian invasion of Af
ghanistan will promote, according to
Kennedy, is a new awareness of
American defense deficiencies.

"I think you're going to see a tre
mendous drive in this country to
build up conventional forces, includ
ing reinstatement of the draft," he
said.
However, Kennedy said he
doubted the United States would be
moving toward a new, more militant
foreign policy. "It'sa perennial prob
lem, how to marshall just enough
public support without going too
far/' he said.
Assistance to Pakistan is the one
aspect of U.S. countermeasures that
might trouble the Russians, accord
ing to Bernstein, but Political Science
Prof. Alexander George pointed out
that, "it remains to be seen if the
Pakistani government wants us to
send arms to the Afghani rebels
through Pakistan."
"The Pakistanis are worried about
becoming a funnel for American
arms because of the inconstancy of
American policy. They are worried, if
they get *into trouble with the Rus
sians, whether the U.S. will back
