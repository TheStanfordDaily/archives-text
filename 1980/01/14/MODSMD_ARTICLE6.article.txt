# Professors evaluate effects
## Firey American response likely surprised Soviets, perhaps world 
### Victor Goetz (Second of a series) 
Most observers here agree that the
Russians were probably surprised by
the intensity of American response
to their invasion of Afghanistan.
"It's never been too clear in ad
vance how the U.S. would react in a
given situation," said History Prof.
Alexander Dallin. "We may be over
reacting, but if that sets a pattern for
future actions, it's all right."

News analysis

Dallin, among others, questions
just how effective our response has
been, however. Dallin said he
thought the termination of grain and
advanced technology sales to the
Soviets was a reasonable reaction.
"But," he added, "things have gone
beyond that. The mood is pretty ugly
right now and it's getting rather ex
treme."
The termination of the U.S. consu
late in Kiev, which Dallin said rep

resented a symbolic presence as well
as a source of information, "hurts us
more than it hurts them.
"The same with the Olympics," he
added. "I think it would be a mistake
to have us pull out."
"So far we've engaged in words,
but rather modest behavior," said
Hoover Peace Fellow Barton Berns
tein. He pointed out that grain export
restrictions will probably hurt the
Soviets, but he agreed that removal
of the consular staff in Kiev hurts us
just as much. In addition, he said the
shelving of SALT II by President
jimmy Carter is just a realization that
it would never pass anyway.
"It's difficult to see how these
measures are anything more than
shows of displeasure," said Vice
President and Provost Donald Ken
nedy. "It's hard to say what real rest
raining effects the current policies
will have."
What the Russian invasion of Af
ghanistan will promote, according to
Kennedy, is a new awareness of
American defense deficiencies.

"I think you're going to see a tre
mendous drive in this country to
build up conventional forces, includ
ing reinstatement of the draft," he
said.
However, Kennedy said he
doubted the United States would be
moving toward a new, more militant
foreign policy. "It'sa perennial prob
lem, how to marshall just enough
public support without going too
far/' he said.
Assistance to Pakistan is the one
aspect of U.S. countermeasures that
might trouble the Russians, accord
ing to Bernstein, but Political Science
Prof. Alexander George pointed out
that, "it remains to be seen if the
Pakistani government wants us to
send arms to the Afghani rebels
through Pakistan."
"The Pakistanis are worried about
becoming a funnel for American
arms because of the inconstancy of
American policy. They are worried, if
they get *into trouble with the Rus
sians, whether the U.S. will back
them up," said Political Science Pro
fessor John Lewis, adding that some
small scale arms manufacturing is
going on in the rebel villages.
The Chinese, also arms suppliers
to Pakistan, are concerned about
American policy in the area, too.
"The Chinese have found U.S. policy
in that area unintelligible," Lewis
said.
But, according to Lewis, the Af
ghanistan crisis has become another
important turning point in U.S.-
China relations.
"The most dominant effect (of the
crisis) is to bring about a much closer
relationship between the U.S. and
China. One means for the U.S. to
exeN more pressure against the
Soviet Union is to work more closely
with China," said Lewis, who cited
one recent Chinese statement which
"sounded like an alliance between
the U.S. and China."
Counterreactions by the Russians
will be quite limited, predicted
George. "The Soviets will object
rhetorically, but they will accept the
fact that it is unpleasant and not pro
voke (the United States) any further
into an action-reaction situation," he
said.
"They don't have counter
economic measures to hit us with.
They have not been selling us goods
in as great quantity as we nave been
sending goods over there," said
Kennedy.
It is highly unlikely, in any case,
that any of our actions will change
their behavior, according to Dallin.
"They will not reverse themselves;
they cannot let us dictate their be
havior."
"They have very rapidly achieved
their minimum objective — to set up

a reliable, stable Soviet 'stooge' gov
ernment," George said.
To this end, he explained, the
Soviets are using a double-barrelled
approach.
First, following their well
established philosophy, when al
ready using force, they are using as
much as necessary. By using
ruthlessness they demoralize the
enemy, according to George.
The other side is to create the im
pression that the new regime is bet
ter than the old, for example, the re
lease of 2000 political prisoners. (Of
course, eyewitnesses have been re
ported as saying they only saw about
300 leave the prison.)
The stronger objective, according
to George, would be to eliminate the
rebels.
"I don't see a prolonged military
struggle. I think the people, no mat
ter how solemn, will be over
whelmed by Soviet power. Then the
Russians will put the best face on it,"
George said.
"I don't think the Soviets want to
go back to the Cold War," George
added.

course, eyewitnesses have been re
ported as saying they only saw about
300 leave the prison.)
The stronger objective, according
to George, would be to eliminate the
rebels.
"I don't see a prolonged military
struggle. I think the people, no mat
ter how solemn, will be over
whelmed by Soviet power. Then the
Russians will put the best face on it,"
George said.
"I don't think the Soviets want to
go back to the Cold War," George
added.
Most observers here agree that the
Russians were probably surprised by
the intensity of American response
to their invasion of Afghanistan.
"It's never been too clear in ad
vance how the U.S. would react in a
given situation," said History Prof.
Alexander Dallin. "We may be over
reacting, but if that sets a pattern for
future actions, it's all right."

News analysis

Dallin, among others, questions
just how effective our response has
been, however. Dallin said he
thought the termination of grain and
advanced technology sales to the
Soviets was a reasonable reaction.
"But," he added, "things have gone
beyond that. The mood is pretty ugly
right now and it's getting rather ex
treme."
The termination of the U.S. consu
late in Kiev, which Dallin said rep

resented a symbolic presence as well
as a source of information, "hurts us
more than it hurts them.
"The same with the Olympics," he
added. "I think it would be a mistake
to have us pull out."
"So far we've engaged in words,
but rather modest behavior," said
Hoover Peace Fellow Barton Berns
tein. He pointed out that grain export
restrictions will probably hurt the
Soviets, but he agreed that removal
of the consular staff in Kiev hurts us
just as much. In addition, he said the
shelving of SALT II by President
jimmy Carter is just a realization that
it would never pass anyway.
"It's difficult to see how these
measures are anything more than
shows of displeasure," said Vice
President and Provost Donald Ken
nedy. "It's hard to say what real rest
raining effects the current policies
will have."
What the Russian invasion of Af
ghanistan will promote, according to
Kennedy, is a new awareness of
American defense deficiencies.

"I think you're going to see a tre
mendous drive in this country to
build up conventional forces, includ
ing reinstatement of the draft," he
said.
However, Kennedy said he
doubted the United States would be
moving toward a new, more militant
foreign policy. "It'sa perennial prob
lem, how to marshall just enough
public support without going too
far/' he said.
Assistance to Pakistan is the one
aspect of U.S. countermeasures that
might trouble the Russians, accord
ing to Bernstein, but Political Science
Prof. Alexander George pointed out
that, "it remains to be seen if the
Pakistani government wants us to
send arms to the Afghani rebels
through Pakistan."
"The Pakistanis are worried about
becoming a funnel for American
arms because of the inconstancy of
American policy. They are worried, if
they get *into trouble with the Rus
sians, whether the U.S. will back
them up," said Political Science Pro
fessor John Lewis, adding that some
small scale arms manufacturing is
going on in the rebel villages.
The Chinese, also arms suppliers
to Pakistan, are concerned about
American policy in the area, too.
"The Chinese have found U.S. policy
in that area unintelligible," Lewis
said.
But, according to Lewis, the Af
ghanistan crisis has become another
important turning point in U.S.-
China relations.
"The most dominant effect (of the
crisis) is to bring about a much closer
relationship between the U.S. and
China. One means for the U.S. to
exeN more pressure against the
Soviet Union is to work more closely
with China," said Lewis, who cited
one recent Chinese statement which
"sounded like an alliance between
the U.S. and China."
Counterreactions by the Russians
will be quite limited, predicted
George. "The Soviets will object
rhetorically, but they will accept the
fact that it is unpleasant and not pro
voke (the United States) any further
into an action-reaction situation," he
said.
"They don't have counter
economic measures to hit us with.
They have not been selling us goods
in as great quantity as we nave been
sending goods over there," said
Kennedy.
It is highly unlikely, in any case,
that any of our actions will change
their behavior, according to Dallin.
"They will not reverse themselves;
they cannot let us dictate their be
havior."
"They have very rapidly achieved
their minimum objective — to set up

a reliable, stable Soviet 'stooge' gov
ernment," George said.
To this end, he explained, the
Soviets are using a double-barrelled
approach.
First, following their well
established philosophy, when al
ready using force, they are using as
much as necessary. By using
ruthlessness they demoralize the
enemy, according to George.
The other side is to create the im
pression that the new regime is bet
ter than the old, for example, the re
lease of 2000 political prisoners. (Of
course, eyewitnesses have been re
ported as saying they only saw about
300 leave the prison.)
