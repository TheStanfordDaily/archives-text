## Sino-American 'marriage of convenience U.S. and China forging 'alliance' 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
« Peking — There was a mo
ment last week, as Secretary ot
„ Defense Harold Brown clam
oered aboard a Chinese T-59
tank fora close inspection of its
guns, when the world seemed
to tilt slightly on its axis.
All those who watched the
tank demonstration alongside
Brown sensed, with varying
degrees of disbelief, that they
t, were also witnessing a signific
ant geopolitical shift. Only a
* year after resumption of formal
k diplomatic ties, the United
*' States and its long-time an
tagonist, China, are forging an
v alliance of sorts.
A marriage of convenience,
born mostly of a common de
sire to throw up a united front
„ against the Soviet Union's in
vasion of Afghanistan, the new
relationship may not survive
' long enough to achieve any of
'• its objectives. But, for the mo
ment, the need for a joint Sino-
American policy toward Soviet
expansionism has made both
sides downplay the ideological
gulf and the policy differences
that separate them.
Perhaps in an effort to
suggest more agreement than
actually exists, the Chinese did
not publicly protest the Carter
administration's recent deci
sion to furnish $280 million in
arms to Taiwan, and voiced
only muted criticism of the
U.S. move even in private ses
sions with Brown.
Equally tactful, the American
defense secretary said nothing
on the record about China's
persistent threats to "teach
Hanoi another lesson" by
launching a second invasion of
Vietnam, though the Carter
administration disapproves.
Instead, Brown chose to em
phasize the willingness, both
in Peking and Washington, to
prop up Thailand if the Viet
namese campaign to wipe out
resistance in Cambodia spills
across the border.
Euphemisms
Brown, the first American
defense chief to visit China.

studiously avoided the word
"alliance," but he used every
euphemism in the dictionary to
describe the joint campaign to
make the Soviets pay dearly tor
their adventure in Afghanistan.
As he concluded 17 hours of
consultations with senior
Chinese politicians and com
manders, Brown announced
that the two sides had "parallel
views of the Soviets' outrage
ous and brutal action" and
would coordinate their efforts
to bolster the defenses of na
tions on the periphery ot Af
ghanistan, particularly Pakis
tan.
"Our strategic views — and
even more important, our
strategic interests — converge
in many instances," the de
fense secretary said. "Our talks
will also help to ensure that our
parallel actions will be mutu
ally reinforcing."
So far, the deepening Sino-
American friendship does not
qualify as a full-fledged military
axis, though there are signs
that that might change. For the
record, Brown reiterated the
Carter administration's posi
tion that it has no plans to sell
weaponry fo the Chinese, but
then he and his aides dropped
hints all week that their posi
tion on arms was flexible, too.
'Bolster and support'
"The (People's Republic of
China) and the United States
can, and I trust someday will,
bolster and support the other
in arms when help is needed,"
he told the commandant of
China's premier military
academy. "There is no coun
try, no matter how rich, no
matter how powerful, no mat
ter how numerous its people
. . . that does not need
friends."
The Pentagon delegation
may, in fact, have been laying
the groundwork last week for
eventual arms transactions by
openly promising to supply the
Chinese civilian technology
with military applications.
If the first transfer is ap
proved by Congress, China will

be able to purchase a ground
station for the Landsat-D photo
reconnaissance satellite to be
launched late next year.
Landsat-D is not a military spy
satellite — the Chinese will re
ceive primarily photos useful
in crop forecasting and oil exp
loration — but it includes
computer technology that the
Americans admit can be di
verted to military uses.
The transaction, disclosed
here just a day before Presi
dent (immy Carter suspended
high-technology transfers to
the Soviet Union, seemed de
signed partly to get the Soviets'
goat. So did Brown's an
nouncement, as he left Peking,
that the Pentagon stands ready
to sell China more "dual use"
technology items, without any
apparent restrictions on their
military applications.
From the American (joint of
view, the Brown trip's most
lasting legacy may be that it
formally brought to a halt the
policy of "even-handedness"
thai the United States followed
in its dealings with the Com
munist governments in Peking
and Moscow throughout the
late 19705.
Pro-Chinese?
I he till toward the Chinese
has been developing ever
since last fall, when the White
House recommended for Pek
ing most-favored nation status
and other trade concessions
that have long been denied the
Soviets. But now the Carter
administration is no longer
merely tilting; it has chosen
sides, deciding to be not only
anti-Soviet, but pro-Chinese.
The lines were drawn in
Brown's lirst banquet toast,
when he warned the Kremlin
that the United States and
China would take "com
plementary" military action if
their "shared interests" were
threatened anywhere in the
world.
Defending the administra
tion's move away from even
handedness, a senior official
traveling with Brown c m

mented, "It would be foolish
for us not to behave differently
toward the Chinese and the
Soviets since they behave dif
ferently toward us."
From the Chinese perspec
tive, the events of the past two
weeks — first the Soviet inva
sion, then the American reac
tion to it — have largely vindi
cated China's foreign policy.
For years, as Washington
struggled for what China re
garded as a largely meaning
less detente with Moscow, the
Chinese have doggedly de
nounced the Russians as "so
cial imperialists" and
"hegemonists" intent on sub
jugating most of the Third
World. Successive administra
tions ridiculed the Chinese
concern, in favor of arms limi
tation treaties and grain deals
with the Soviets.

"alliance," but he used every
euphemism in the dictionary to
describe the joint campaign to
make the Soviets pay dearly tor
their adventure in Afghanistan.
As he concluded 17 hours of
consultations with senior
Chinese politicians and com
manders, Brown announced
that the two sides had "parallel
views of the Soviets' outrage
ous and brutal action" and
would coordinate their efforts
to bolster the defenses of na
tions on the periphery ot Af
ghanistan, particularly Pakis
tan.
"Our strategic views — and
even more important, our
strategic interests — converge
in many instances," the de
fense secretary said. "Our talks
will also help to ensure that our
parallel actions will be mutu
ally reinforcing."
So far, the deepening Sino-
American friendship does not
qualify as a full-fledged military
axis, though there are signs

tion that it has no plans to sell
weaponry fo the Chinese, but

'Bolster and support'
"The (People's Republic of
China) and the United States

bolster and support the other
in arms when help is needed,"
he told the commandant of
China's premier military
academy. "There is no coun
try, no matter how rich, no
matter how powerful, no mat
ter how numerous its people
. . . that does not need
friends."
The Pentagon delegation
may, in fact, have been laying
the groundwork last week for
eventual arms transactions by
openly promising to supply the
Chinese civilian technology
with military applications.
If the first transfer is ap
proved by Congress, China will

be able to purchase a ground
station for the Landsat-D photo
reconnaissance satellite to be
launched late next year.
Landsat-D is not a military spy
satellite — the Chinese will re
ceive primarily photos useful
in crop forecasting and oil exp
loration — but it includes
computer technology that the
Americans admit can be di
verted to military uses.
The transaction, disclosed
here just a day before Presi

high-technology transfers to
the Soviet Union, seemed de
signed partly to get the Soviets'
goat. So did Brown's an
nouncement, as he left Peking,
that the Pentagon stands ready
to sell China more "dual use"
technology items, without any
apparent restrictions on their
military applications.
From the American (joint of

lasting legacy may be that it
formally brought to a halt the
policy of "even-handedness"

late 19705.
