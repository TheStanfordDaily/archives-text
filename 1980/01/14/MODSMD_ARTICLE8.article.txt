Geneva — Angered that the
Iranian government has leaked
details of confidential Red
Cross missions to Iranian pris
ons under the former shah, the
Red Cross released a full dos
sier last week on the visits,
claiming that the efforts led to
significant improvements.
The report was released by
the Iranian ambassador in
Brussels, and gave details of
the torture techniques applied
to 3087 prisoners who were vis
ited by the Red Cross in 18
prisons in March 1977. The
ambassador claimed that the
visits had not led to improve
ments.
This was being vigorously

disputed here Wednesday by
Red Cross officials, who comp
lain that the leaks are based on
the first visit only, and ignore
two subsequent missions to
Iran in October 1977 and the
summer ol 1978.
The reports claim improve
ments both in the length of in
terrogation after arrest — the
time during which the Red
Cross has always maintained
most torture occurs —andalso
the number of detainees. Bu' it
also points out that Red Cross
delegates were refused access
to some of those detained after
the first demonstrations of
1978.
The only known precedent
tor the Red Cross releasing

such a dossier occurred in 1969
after similar leaks by the Gieek
colonels. The confidentiality of
Red Cross reports is one
reason the agency has man
aged to visit an estimated
500,000 prisoners since World
War 11.
file disclosures by the Red
Cross are considered particu
larly significant because the
Iranian revolutionary govern
ment has been less coopera
tive than the shah in investigat
ing prison abuses. The Red
C ross, whose representation in
Iran has been cut from five de
legates to one, was refused ac
cess during the summary
executions there'early last
year. It visited the former

prime minister, Abbas
Hoveida, a lew days before his
death last March, but such vis
its were quickly suspended be
cause Red Cross officials were
not allowed to visit with a doc
tor, talk to whomever they
wanted and conduct inter
views without witnesses — all
conditions that are applied to
prison visits.
Eventually, the Red Cross
was allowed into the Qasr
Prison in Tehran last August
and delegates met 700 prison
ers. But this compares to the
1237 detainees thought to be in
the jail at the beginning of
1979. Since then the Red Cross
has been pressing unsuccess
fully for follow-up visits.
