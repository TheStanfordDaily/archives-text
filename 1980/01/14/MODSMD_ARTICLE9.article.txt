# Gandhi victory ensures one-party rule

New Delhi — Indira Gandhi's
Congress-I Party won such a
resounding victory in India's
national elections that it wiped
out the only effective chal
lenge it has faced to its one
party domination of Indian
politics.
The wipeout was so com
plete, in fact, that there is no
official opposition in parlia
ment to the Congress Party.
Fhe party itselt has splintered
several times, but its core —
called Congress-I for Indira —
has ruled India except for the
past 33 months, since it won
independence from Britain in
1947.
The Janata coalition, which
got together in 1977 to defeat
Gandhi, fell apart under the
weight of continual bickering
by its political leaders and,
many political observers here
believe, did everything but
throw the election to Gandhi's
Congress-I.
Its split triggered the elec

tion, and its two parts — the
Janata and the Lok Dal — man
aged to get just 13 percent of
the seats compared to
Congress-I's 66 percent.
Thus ended India's best
chance for two-party democ
racy.
'Squabbles'
The squabbles among Janata
coalition members last year
brought about the fall of the
Morarji Desai government in
August and led to Gandhi's
massive victory.
Moreover, the Janata gov
ernment handed Congress-I a
ready-made campaign issue by
its inability to control prices,
which have increased 20 per
cent since last February, and by
continuing labor unrest,
economic stagnation and law
and-order problems.
The magazine India Today
called it"the sugar and
kerosene election," and those
issues appeared more impor
tant to voters than the Janata
and Lok Dal arguments that
Gandhi would return to her
harsh emergency rule that saw
tens of thousands of Indians
jailed, censorship imposed on
the press and special favors for
friends of Gandhi, 62, and her
33-year-old son, Sanjay.
Fractured opposition
In fact, it was the fractured
nature of the opposition that
allowed Congress-I to win such
an overwhelming majority in
parliament.
In several north Indian
states, for instance, the com
bined votes of opposition can
didates exceeded that of the
Congress-I winner.
One of Gandhi's key aides,
Kamalapati Tripathi, who was
elected in a district in the
pivitol state of Uttar Pradesh,
won with 129,063 votes. But the
combined votes of his Lok Dal
and Janata opponents, who in
cluded Lok Dal Party President

Raj Narain, totaled 186,626.
Ironically, Narain had been a
Janata politician and a key fi
gure in the fall of the Gandhi
government in 1977. He per
sonally defeated her that year
in the constituency of Rae
Bareli, which gave Gandhi an
overwhelming victory this
election.
Split vote
"Such splits can be multip
lied," the national daily news
paper The Statesman said in an
election analysis Friday. "A
rough estimate shows that a
split in the )anata vote helped
Congress-I bag at least 50 con
stituencies which it would not
have done otherwise."
Splits notwithstanding,
Congress-I emerged from the
election as India's only major
national political party and
Gandhi as this country's only
politician with national stand
ing.
As it has consistently since
India's independence — with
the exception of Janata's 33-
month-rule — Congress-I
managed to appeal to voters of
all regions, castes and relig
ions. Predictions that Indian
national political parties would
be replaced by ones appealing
to narrow regional caste or
communal interests appeared
unfounded.
Charan Singh's Lok Dal,
which finished second in the
voting, appealed to a narrow
class of small, landowning far
mers in North India. He drew
41 seats, hardly a large national
following.
Petty politics
It is no secret that Indian
politics is among the pettiest in
the world. Charan Singh, the
caretaker prime minister and
leader of the Lok Dal, illus
trated this when he explained
in November why his bloc split
from the Janata coalition.
He said he was angry be

cause then Prime Minister
Morarji Desai failed to wish
him happy birthday in 1977and
refused to allow a government
doctor to accompany him on
official tours.
Janata leader Jagjivan Ram,
an untouchable himself, was
expected to win for his party
wide support from the 100-
million members of India's
lowest caste. In fact, most un
touchable votes went to Gan
dhi's Congress-I.
No vendettas
Gandhi now is in the process
of picking her Cabinet, which
will be sworn in Monday. In a
speech to her parliamentary
party Thursday, she pledged
not to indulge in vendettas
against her political enemies.
Now Gandhi is firmly in the
saddle. Her worst enemies, as
one diplomat here said, fear
she will move forcefully against
her enemies in India and ab
road — escalating an atomic
weapons program, taking ad
vantage of Pakistan's weak in
ternal position, disciplining
neighboring states such as
Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh
tor not following India's lead,
censoring newspapers, allow
ing corruption among her al
lies, freezing non-supporters
from government work and
jailing political opponents.
But most observers believe
she will tread more softly.
Her first priorities are ex
pected to be domestic — low
ering prices and ending shor
tages of key commodities such
as sugar, onions and kerosene,
and cutting crime in the streets
and the workplace.
But the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan has given her a hard
choice on the foreign front. On
the one hand she is a long time
friend of the Soviet Union, but
she has always opposed armed
intervention in another coun
try.

of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
