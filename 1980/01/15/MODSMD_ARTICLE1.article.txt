# Graduation to remain in Frost
## 
### 
Continuing a 43-year tradition,
President Richard Lyman decided
yesterday to hold this spring's com
mencement ceremony in Frost Am
phitheatre.
The limited size ot the audience
and added cost ot chair rental in
volved in the Frost ceremony took a
back seat to tradition in Lyman's
choice of the amphitheatre over
Stanford Stadium for the com
mencement exercises.
"Perhaps I am letting sentiment
play too big a part," Lyman stated in a
three-page explanation of his deci
sion, "but if there is an area where a
certain amount of sentiment is
wholly appropriate to the decision
making process, it may well be com
mencement."
The continuation ot the ceremony
in Frost is expected to cost the Uni
versity $33,000 in comparison to
$18,000 for a similar ceremony in the
stadium, Lyman stated.

Purchase of the 18,000 chairs
necessary lor the Frost ceremony
and other commencement events
will cost the University $131,400, an
expense which will be amortized
over the 10-year life expectancy of
the chairs, according to Sue Farr, as
sociate director of public events.
She said Abbey Rentals, the com
pany which previously rented the
chairs to the University before clos
ing its Northern California branch,
offered to sell its used chairs to the
University, but officials here decided
to purchase new chairs, instead.
Frost has a capacity of 9500 without
chairs, but attendance at com
mencement in recent years has over
flowed the 12,000 seats crowded into
the amphitheatre for the occasion.
This led to a decision last summer to
reduce the number ot free tickets
given graduating students from four
to three this |une.
Farr said the chairs will be stored
either in four trailers purchased for
the purpose and located near Bonair
Siding, behind the Department of
Police Services and Fire Station, or at
an off-campus location.
Co-senior Class President Alan Al
pert said he was happy with the deci
sion.
"It was a very difficult decision to
make," Alpert said, "but it will be a
much nicer environment for us to
graduate."
Alpert said the senior class presi
dents compiled the responses of
more than 100 students to a request
published in the Daily last quarter

soliciting student preferences on the
commencement site. Fie said the re
sults were turned over to the Office
of Public Affairs and then conveyed
to the president. According to Al
pert, some students said they would
not participate in the ceremony if it
were held in the stadium.
Lyman said that input given him
by students in general was substan
tially in lavor of continuing the cere
mony at Frost. He mentioned that a
letter written him by 1b seniors par
ticularly impressed him.
In noting the positive and negative
aspects of moving the ceremony to
the stadium, Lyman said "there is
some loss as well as gain in having a
virtually tree and open ceremony;
when, as not infrequently happens,
the commencement speaker is a
celebrated figure, likely to draw a
sizeable audience of curiosity
seekers, in addition (o those who
have a connection of family or
friendship with the graduates, the
nature of the ceremony is likely to
change in subtle but different ways."
In the last 10 years, the total
number of degrees granted has in
creased from 3692 in 1970 t04023 last
|une. The percentage of degree reci
pients attending the ceremony and
bringing guests has risen over the
same period, from 35 to 62 percent.
Farr said in addition to the increase
in participating graduates, an in
creased number of non-graduating
students who rent gowns and caps
and walk through the ceremony has
added to the crowd.


The Tradition Lives On
Frost Amphitheatre will once again be filled to the brim this
spring, when approximately 12,000 people will be on hand
to watch the Class of 1980 graduate. Although the outdoor

location is somewhat cramped, University president
Richard Lyman said that he chose to maintain the tradi
tional setting for commencement exercises for sentimental
reasons.

to the president. According to Al
pert, some students said they would
not participate in the ceremony if it
were held in the stadium.
Lyman said that input given him
by students in general was substan
tially in lavor of continuing the cere
mony at Frost. He mentioned that a
letter written him by 1b seniors par
ticularly impressed him.
In noting the positive and negative
aspects of moving the ceremony to
the stadium, Lyman said "there is
some loss as well as gain in having a
virtually tree and open ceremony;
when, as not infrequently happens,
the commencement speaker is a
celebrated figure, likely to draw a
sizeable audience of curiosity
seekers, in addition (o those who
have a connection of family or
friendship with the graduates, the
nature of the ceremony is likely to
change in subtle but different ways."
In the last 10 years, the total
number of degrees granted has in
creased from 3692 in 1970 t04023 last
|une. The percentage of degree reci
pients attending the ceremony and
bringing guests has risen over the
same period, from 35 to 62 percent.
Farr said in addition to the increase
in participating graduates, an in
creased number of non-graduating
students who rent gowns and caps
and walk through the ceremony has
added to the crowd.


The Tradition Lives On
Frost Amphitheatre will once again be filled to the brim this
spring, when approximately 12,000 people will be on hand
to watch the Class of 1980 graduate. Although the outdoor

location is somewhat cramped, University president
Richard Lyman said that he chose to maintain the tradi
tional setting for commencement exercises for sentimental
reasons.
Continuing a 43-year tradition,
President Richard Lyman decided
yesterday to hold this spring's com
mencement ceremony in Frost Am
phitheatre.
The limited size ot the audience
and added cost ot chair rental in
volved in the Frost ceremony took a
back seat to tradition in Lyman's
choice of the amphitheatre over
Stanford Stadium for the com
mencement exercises.
"Perhaps I am letting sentiment
play too big a part," Lyman stated in a
three-page explanation of his deci
sion, "but if there is an area where a
certain amount of sentiment is
wholly appropriate to the decision
making process, it may well be com
mencement."
The continuation ot the ceremony
in Frost is expected to cost the Uni
versity $33,000 in comparison to
$18,000 for a similar ceremony in the
stadium, Lyman stated.

Purchase of the 18,000 chairs
necessary lor the Frost ceremony
and other commencement events
will cost the University $131,400, an
expense which will be amortized
over the 10-year life expectancy of
the chairs, according to Sue Farr, as
sociate director of public events.
She said Abbey Rentals, the com
pany which previously rented the
chairs to the University before clos
ing its Northern California branch,
offered to sell its used chairs to the
University, but officials here decided
to purchase new chairs, instead.
Frost has a capacity of 9500 without
chairs, but attendance at com
mencement in recent years has over
flowed the 12,000 seats crowded into
the amphitheatre for the occasion.
This led to a decision last summer to
reduce the number ot free tickets
given graduating students from four
to three this |une.
Farr said the chairs will be stored
either in four trailers purchased for
the purpose and located near Bonair
Siding, behind the Department of
Police Services and Fire Station, or at
an off-campus location.
Co-senior Class President Alan Al
pert said he was happy with the deci
sion.
"It was a very difficult decision to
make," Alpert said, "but it will be a
much nicer environment for us to
graduate."
Alpert said the senior class presi
dents compiled the responses of
more than 100 students to a request
published in the Daily last quarter

soliciting student preferences on the
commencement site. Fie said the re
sults were turned over to the Office
of Public Affairs and then conveyed
to the president. According to Al
pert, some students said they would
not participate in the ceremony if it
were held in the stadium.
Lyman said that input given him
by students in general was substan
tially in lavor of continuing the cere
mony at Frost. He mentioned that a
