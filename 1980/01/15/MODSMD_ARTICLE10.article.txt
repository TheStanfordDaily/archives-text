# Keio: Farm's Tokyo connection
## 
### Jim Sakamoto 
"Tired, frightened and ex
cited, all rolled up into one"
sums up the feelings of Alan
Matsumoto upon landing at
Tokyo Airport in Japan last
summer.
Matsumoto and seven other
adventurous University stu
dents were participants in the
Keio University exchange
program, an entirely student
run activity which provides
Stanford students and recent
graduates with the opportunity
to experience Japanese culture
first-hand.
As the anxious group of stu
dents were led out of the cus
toms inspection area, they
were relieved to finally see the
familiar faces of Japanese
friends who had, earlier that
spring, come to Palo Alto in the
same exchange program.
Every year, for more than
two decades, a different group
of University students has ex
perienced these same anxious
moments upon their arrival in
Tokyo.
"The first challenge we faced
was how to find our way
around such a crowded and
large city as Tokyo," recalled
1979 Stanford graduate Kick
Rand, another participant in
the program last summer.
"The first thing you learn to
do is to push and shove your
way into the overcrowded
train. I know now what it feels
like to be a sardine." he added.
Students spend much of
(heir time in Tokyo, the major
center of commerce, culture
and activity in Japan. Narrow
streets, closely built homes
and apartment houses are
trademarks of this densely
populated city.
"The aspect which I re
member most vividly about
Tokyo is that everything is so
compact," said Robby
Buechel, another University
graduate.
"In America, the abundance
of wide-open space is taken for
granted. In Japan, though,
every inch of land is a precious
commodity. As a result, every

thing is smaller and more com
pact. The homes, the buildings
— everything."
The students are given a
great deal of time and inde
pendence to explore the city
and meet its residents on their
own. But students are also
taken on tours of such places
as Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Nikko
and Sandai, with the guidance
of theit Japanese friends from
Keio University.

"The pace was hectic, but
the places we visited were well
worth the trouble," said Russ
Kawahara, another 1979
graduate now attending law
school at the University of
Chicago.
"For such a small island,
there are an incredible number
of temples, shrines and
monuments to be seen," he
said. "There is a great deal of
history and culture, which we
had the opportunity to glimpse

while we were there."
For Wolf Brolley, a junior
majoring in East Asian Studies,
the opportunity to live with a
Japanese host family was the
most rewarding and eye
opening aspect of the prog
ram.
"In Japan, the roles of men
and women are still fairly in
grained. The husband is the
breadwinner, while the wife's

job is to tend to the house
chores and care for the chil
dren," he explained.
Brolley also said that another
advantage of his homestay was
the opportunity to work on his
Japanese language speaking
skills.
"Each student gets out of the
program exactly how much ef
fort he puts into it," according
to James Higa, chairman of the
Keio Exchange Program.

more than 100 students from

For Matsumoto, the high
light ol his stay in japan was
when he traveled to Sapporo, a
former site ot the Winter
Olympics, to attend the fourth
World Kendo Championships.
I le has studied the Japanese art
of Kendo lor more than ten
years. Kendo is roughly equiva

lent to the Western sport ot
fencing, and is very popular in
Japan.
"The caliber of skill which
the contestants demonstrated
was incredible," he said. "Even
it that were the only thing I did
in Japan, the trip would have
been extremely worthwhile."
As Higa pointed out, the op
portunity to adapt and live in
timately in a different culture
such as that ol Japan cannot
help but attect each student's
outlook and perspective upon
return to the United States.

As Higa pointed out, the op
portunity to adapt and live in
timately in a different culture
such as that ol Japan cannot
help but attect each student's
outlook and perspective upon
return to the United States.


Japanese student Motobe I akakihara was a student here last year
through the Keio University exchange program.
"Tired, frightened and ex
cited, all rolled up into one"
sums up the feelings of Alan
Matsumoto upon landing at
Tokyo Airport in Japan last
summer.
Matsumoto and seven other
adventurous University stu
dents were participants in the
Keio University exchange
program, an entirely student
run activity which provides
Stanford students and recent
graduates with the opportunity
to experience Japanese culture
first-hand.
As the anxious group of stu
dents were led out of the cus
toms inspection area, they
were relieved to finally see the
familiar faces of Japanese
friends who had, earlier that
spring, come to Palo Alto in the
same exchange program.
Every year, for more than
two decades, a different group
of University students has ex
perienced these same anxious
moments upon their arrival in
Tokyo.
"The first challenge we faced
was how to find our way
around such a crowded and
large city as Tokyo," recalled
1979 Stanford graduate Kick
Rand, another participant in
the program last summer.
"The first thing you learn to
do is to push and shove your
way into the overcrowded
train. I know now what it feels
like to be a sardine." he added.
Students spend much of
(heir time in Tokyo, the major
center of commerce, culture
and activity in Japan. Narrow
streets, closely built homes
and apartment houses are
trademarks of this densely
populated city.
"The aspect which I re
member most vividly about
Tokyo is that everything is so
compact," said Robby
Buechel, another University
graduate.
"In America, the abundance
of wide-open space is taken for
granted. In Japan, though,
every inch of land is a precious
commodity. As a result, every

thing is smaller and more com
pact. The homes, the buildings
— everything."
The students are given a
great deal of time and inde
pendence to explore the city
and meet its residents on their
own. But students are also
taken on tours of such places
as Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Nikko
and Sandai, with the guidance
of theit Japanese friends from
Keio University.

"The pace was hectic, but
the places we visited were well
worth the trouble," said Russ
Kawahara, another 1979
graduate now attending law
school at the University of
Chicago.
"For such a small island,
there are an incredible number
of temples, shrines and
monuments to be seen," he
said. "There is a great deal of
history and culture, which we
had the opportunity to glimpse

while we were there."
For Wolf Brolley, a junior
majoring in East Asian Studies,
the opportunity to live with a
Japanese host family was the
most rewarding and eye
opening aspect of the prog
ram.
"In Japan, the roles of men
and women are still fairly in
grained. The husband is the
breadwinner, while the wife's

job is to tend to the house
chores and care for the chil
dren," he explained.
Brolley also said that another
advantage of his homestay was
the opportunity to work on his
Japanese language speaking
skills.
"Each student gets out of the
program exactly how much ef
fort he puts into it," according
to James Higa, chairman of the
Keio Exchange Program.

In the past two decades,
more than 100 students from

For Matsumoto, the high
light ol his stay in japan was
when he traveled to Sapporo, a
former site ot the Winter
Olympics, to attend the fourth
World Kendo Championships.
I le has studied the Japanese art
of Kendo lor more than ten
years. Kendo is roughly equiva

lent to the Western sport ot
fencing, and is very popular in
Japan.
"The caliber of skill which
the contestants demonstrated
was incredible," he said. "Even
it that were the only thing I did
in Japan, the trip would have
been extremely worthwhile."
