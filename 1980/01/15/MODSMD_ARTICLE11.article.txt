# 'Energy Now' proposes renewable-resources fund
## Former students push for energy initiative 
### Carlos Greth 
Want to get involved in poli
tics? Ask Ray Thomas or Sally
Syka, and they will tell you how
frustrating, and rewarding, it
can be. Former University stu
dents, they have formed a
group called the "Committee
for Energy Now" with Jim
Tranquada, who was also a
student here, to provide for
the passage of a state initiative
for renewable resources
energy funding.
"I'm a leffersonian Democ
rat, and I believe in citizen par
ticipation," said Thomas. "The
initiative takes the onus off the
big corporations and puts re
sponsibility where it belongs,
at the community level."
"If there's one thing we've
learned," Syka said, "it's that
politics is not for people who
don't have money. To partici
pate in legitimate politics, you
have to play by the rules. Those
rules don't have to make
sense. That can be horrifying.
"People in government will
quote you conflicting figures.
It's hard to get straight
answers," she said.
The initiative "sets up a fund
for conservation, solar and
solar-related projects for
which the state will serve as a
bookkeeper and distributor,"
Syka said.

'The government or businesses can't charge
you for heat from solar panels. They can't
charge farmers for making their own alcohol
fuels from things that would otherwise be
thrown away/

Money for the fund will
come from contributions. On
the state tax forms, the initia
tive would provide for a sec
tion enabling people to contri
bute $1 or more to the fund.
The Office of Appropriate
Technology would receive all
contributions, evaluate sub
mitted proposals and initiate
projects.
Their idea is not a new one,
as Colorado has used a similar
tactic on its tax forms. During a
bad winter, she said, "the state
initiated a volunteer fund to
airlift food to snow-bound wild
animals."
Committee members have
had to battle, among other
things, a "granola-eating hip

pie" image. Their effort to
overcome this image has been
supported by the opinions of
groups such as Energy Future,
the Energy Project at the Har
vard Business School.
"What Harvard says in the
report," said Syka, "is that
maybe the freaks were right all
along."
"We've attracted a wide
range of support," said
Thomas, "from libertarians to
no-nuke groups. We don't
want to get so involved with
any one group, however, to
the point where our major
issue becomes confused with
theirs.
"If we try to get the initiative
passed through the petition
method, our chances are not
good," she said. "We would
have to gather 350,000 valid
signatures." The cost of gather
ing that many would be high,
running $10,000 just for print
ing. Alternatively, the commit
tee is trying to convince several
state legislators to sponsor the
initiative in Sacramento.
"One of the reasons we have
the sort of energy legislation
we do is because of who has
the money to spend on lobby
ing," Syka said."Among the 10
companies which spent the
most in lobbying in the state of
California last year, five were

utilities companies," she said.
Syka admitted they are hav
ing trouble being heard over
the jangle of those big energy
industry coins.
"We haven't received much
monetary support," she said.
"We have received many en
dorsements and valuable ad
vice from groups such as the
Citizens Against a Nuclear En
vironment in Palo Alto."
The Office of Appropriate
Technology, through which
the initiative-related funds
would be handled, is a small,
little-known office with a
budget of more than $1 mill
ion.
Renewable resources are
low-cost, recyclable, non

polluting, energy-producing
methods. "They tend to be
anti-conglomerate and anti-big
business," Syka said. "They
tend tobe things you can put in
your backyard."
Though the main thrust of
the initiative is forsolarenergy,
included are "de-centralized
bio-mass fuel projects." Such
projects convert wastes and
crops to produce methane and
other alcohol fuels.
It would cost 10 percent of
the funds gathered from the
tax funds to administer the
program proposed in the initia
tive.
"The government or
businesses can't chargeyoufor
heat from solar panels," she
said. "They can't charge far

mers for making their own al
cohol fuels from things that
would otherwise be thrown
away. And if alternative
sources work well, you'll be
conserving. You can't be
charged for what you don't
use.
Though she talks about turn
ing energy sources over to the
people, Syka said she is not to
be confused with certain
idealogues of the left. "The
Committee for Energy Now is
not against anything, but
rather, pro-alternative
energy."
The committee is placing
emphasis on passing the initia
tive quickly, according to
Thomas.
