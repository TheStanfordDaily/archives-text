# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Allan Chen Advising associates satisfy a need

How often have you wished
that advising could be im
proved, that rapport and av
ailability of advisers could be
increased?
Advising undergraduates in
a large university is a heroic
task when many of the advisers
are professors with teaching
loads, research programs,
graduate advisees, departmen
tal committees and families.
Some students are invariably
disappointed with their
freshman advisers, and so the
controversy over the im
provement of advising rages
on year after year.
Meanwhile, the students
suffer, since graduating stu
dents leave behind a legacy of
dissatisfaction with their

studies. Entering students are
quick to learn critical thinking
from them, but slow to learn
academic planning and the art
of making the most of what
Stanford has to offer.
Three years ago, the under
graduates themselves re
sponded to this dissatisfaction
with an idea that eventually be
came the Advising Associates
Program. Students who need
academic guidance almost in
variably turn to their peers for
information about courses and
majors.
By institutionalizing peer ad
vising, the student founders of
the Advising Associates Prog
ram hoped to establish peer
advisers who would be trained
in peer counseling techniques
and academic planning. They
would work with faculty/staff
advisers to complement the
long-range planning stressed
by these regular advisers with
information that students ask
each other: courses, majors,
university procedures and
academic-related campus ser
vices.
Where an adviser and stu
dent havetroubledevelopinga
rapport or where the adviser is
sometimes unavailable or un
familiar with an advisee's
academic interests, the advis

ing associate would act as
liaison, facilitator, or
supplementary academic
planning counselor. In the
case of academic problems
which neither member of the
advising team could solve, the
associate would help the stu
dent find people or services
who might help more success
fully.

Program is now in its second

counselor with a faculty/staff
adviser in three freshman
dorms: Branner, Arroyo and
Rinconada. The advising team
works with house associates
and resident fellows to advise
groups of roughly eight, ac
cording to general area in
terest. This year's program has
been so successful that Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Her
ant Katchadourian has ap
proved its expansion to a
fourth house next year.
We would like to invite every
student who is now a sopho
more, junior or fourth-year
co-terminal to apply. If you
want to advise prospective en
gineering freshmen, you
should go through the School
of Engineering which has an
advising program of its own.
Otherwise, you can get an ap
plication at the Academic In
formation Center. A broad,
well-rounded academic and
extracurricular background is a
big help.
The application process and
the program itself are both
somewhat demanding. A
prospective advising associate
submits a written application
first, and students will then be
chosen for interviews on the
basis of those applications.
Those who pass the interview
enter the program. They go on
to take a two-unit training

course during the spring quar
ter, which emphasizes coun
seling techniques, educational
resources at Stanford,
academic planning and educa
tional philosophy.
The only remuneration,
aside from the units for the
training course, is job satisfac
tion (we hope). The time spent
advising is your own, so be
prepared to make a few sac
rifices of your time and your
self.

Advising is a rewarding ex
perience and it helps advisers
as much as it helps advisees.
The fundamental assumption
of advising, as taught in the
training course is this: the ad
visee is capable of making his
or her own decision. The ad
viser doesn't decide lor the
student; the problem is to
make the choices clearer.
The idea turned out to be a
godsend for this year's advis
ing associates since most of us
are still in the process of mak
ing choices about our own
lives.
