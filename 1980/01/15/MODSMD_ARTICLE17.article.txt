## New foreign policy needed 
### 
In order to shed more light on the current
deterioration of U.S.—Soviet relations, it is
helpful to take a retrospective look at the U.S.
response to overt Soviet provocations during
the past few months.
After Senator Allan Stone (D.-Fla.) made pub
lic the discovery of Soviet combat troops in
Cuba, President jimmy Carter declared that this
situation is incongruent with the security in
terests of the United States and, therefore, un
acceptable.
However, in the following weeks Carter's out
rage was evidently placated, at least partly, by
Soviet explanations and, more importantly, by
his fervent wish not to jeopardize Senate ratifi
cation of the already embattled SALT II treaty.
Carrying a toothpick
When the Iranian militant "students," with
the overt endorsement of that country's leaders,
took over our embassy in Tehran, Carter's re
sponse was once again strictly oratorical. In
sharp contrast toTeddy Roosevelt's counsel, the
United States once again spoke strongly and
carried a stick the size of a toothpick.
Fven today, with our citizens being held hos
tage for over two months in transgression of the
most basic principles of international law, the
Carter administration is hesitant to impose
economic sanctions against Iran without the
blessing of the U.N. Security Council.
It is important that the American people
realize that in this instance the pursuit of a lofty
ideal in fact relegates the authority to authorize
this measure aimed at securing the release of
our hostages to a body where it can be defeated
by Soviet veto or by six votes from "world pow
ers" such as Jamaica and Zambia.
Moscow's ties
The Soviet Union, while critical of "U.S. im
perialism," has publicly called for release of the
American hostages. However, several Western
analysts have indicated that Moscow has at least
indirect ties with the Iranian "students." In addi
tion, Soviet radio broadcasts in Farsi into Iran
were aimed at further fueling the crisis.
The lack of an effective U.S. response to the
presence of Soviet combat troops in Cuba, or to
the Iranian crisis, as well as to the Cuban pre
sence in South Yemen, Ethiopia and Angola,
undoubtedly played a prominent role in the
Kremlin's decision to invade Afghanistan.
Apparently shocked by the Soviet aggression,
Carter, during an ABC-TV interview on De
cember 31,1979, let it be known that he has now
entirely altered his view of the Soviet Union.
One certainly has to wonder how the "lies of
Leonid Brezhnev" about Soviet aims in Af
ghanistan can suddenly disillusion a U.S. presi
dent during whose tenure the Soviet Union or
ganized military and political interference in the
Third World directly and through its Cuban, Vie
tnamese and East European proxies, and un
leashed vicious propaganda campaigns against
the NATO deployment of the neutron warhead
and, more recently against the modernization of
NATO theater nuclear weapons. However,
though it took Carter three years in office to
allow reality to overcome his idealism, it is al
ways better later than never.
Carter's actions
Unfortunately, once again Carter's actions do
not quite correspond with his words. While
limiting U.S.-Soviet economics and cultural ex
change are moves in the right direction, they
should be more extensive to be considered a
punishment. Some aspects of these restrictions,
especially the technology transfer which has in a
number of well documented instances aided the
unprecedented Soviet military buildup, are long
overdue.
The lifting of such restrictions should not be
based merely on the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan, or even on Soviet abstention
from other direct military invasions, but rather

on the Kremlin's total alteration of its global
foreign policy.
Unfortunately, at least in the immediate fu
ture, Soviet acceptance of an evenhanded de
tente does not seem too likely, and so assisting
the growth of an enemy's military potential con
stitutes a self-destructive U.S. policy.
Postponing SALT II
The president's request of the Senate to post
pone consideration of SALT II is also puzzling,
since it only prevents certain defeat of the tre
aty. Even more harmful is Carter's commitment
to comply with the unratified treaty so long as
Moscow also follows its terms. This condition is
not too harsh since SALT II permits the Soviet
Union to proceed with practically all the
strategic programs which its already strained
military budget can support and, in any case, it
assures the U.S.S.R. of obtaining substantial
strategic nuclear superiority in most indices by
the early 1980s.
If President Carter really is serious about alter
ing U.S. policies in light of his recent "discov
ery" of what the Soviet Union is all about, he
must not let SALT II dictate our strategic nuclear
policy. The balance in this dominant area often
has a decisive influence over the outcome of
crucial political issues.
In the 1962 crises Khrushchev was faced with a
six to one U.S. strategic nuclear superiority and,
not surprisingly, decided to withdraw Soviet
missiles from Cuba. On the other hand, after the
balance was tipped in the Soviet favor following
SALT I, Brezhnev felt strong enough to threaten
the United States with "grave consequences"
during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
Today, the Soviet Union repeatedly stresses
that U.S. pressures aimed at forcing the USSR to
withdraw from Afghanistan cannot be success
ful because of what is referred to as the
"changed correlation of forces" in the world.
While this term is meant to cover a wide spec
trum of military and non-military indicators, it is
nevertheless clear from Soviet statements that
they consider strategic nuclear balance as the
most influential aspect of this spectrum.
Foreign policy advisers
It is possible to excuse, at least partially, Car
ter's gullibility by his inexperience in foreign
policy. However, no such justification is possi
ble in the case of his foreign policy advisers.
They are, after all , professionals.
Most of the foreign policy experts in the Car
ter administration, including Zbigniew
Brzezinski, whom the press in its infinite wis
dom chose to portray as a hardliner, have based
their policies on the hope that U.S. unilateral
pursuance of the ideals of detente will eventu
ally induce a responsible Soviet behavior. For
example, burgeoning U.S.-Soviet trade was
seen by these officials as forcing Soviet depen
dence on the U.S. economy and together with
the growing cultural ties, gradually to bring
about convergence of the two socio-political
systems.
Fresh blood
In the light ol the failure of the above political
strategy, it is imperative that Carter, if he is now
really ready to confront Moscow, replace his old
foreign policy team with some fresh blood, just
the same way that a private business firm would
dismiss administrators guilty of mismanage
ment.
New people, particularly those that have al
ways had a more prudent view of the U.S.S.R.
will not have an incentive to cover their past
misjudgements with further mistakes, and will
be able to help the president to reappraise the
direction of U.S. foreign policy and, hopefully,
to prevent new and perhaps even more daring
Soviet adventures.

The president's request of the Senate to post
pone consideration of SALT II is also puzzling,
since it only prevents certain defeat of the tre
aty. Even more harmful is Carter's commitment
to comply with the unratified treaty so long as
Moscow also follows its terms. This condition is
not too harsh since SALT II permits the Soviet
Union to proceed with practically all the
strategic programs which its already strained
military budget can support and, in any case, it
assures the U.S.S.R. of obtaining substantial
strategic nuclear superiority in most indices by
the early 1980s.
If President Carter really is serious about alter
ing U.S. policies in light of his recent "discov
ery" of what the Soviet Union is all about, he
must not let SALT II dictate our strategic nuclear
policy. The balance in this dominant area often
has a decisive influence over the outcome of
crucial political issues.
In the 1962 crises Khrushchev was faced with a
six to one U.S. strategic nuclear superiority and,
not surprisingly, decided to withdraw Soviet
missiles from Cuba. On the other hand, after the
balance was tipped in the Soviet favor following
SALT I, Brezhnev felt strong enough to threaten
the United States with "grave consequences"
during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
Today, the Soviet Union repeatedly stresses
that U.S. pressures aimed at forcing the USSR to
withdraw from Afghanistan cannot be success
ful because of what is referred to as the
"changed correlation of forces" in the world.
While this term is meant to cover a wide spec
trum of military and non-military indicators, it is
nevertheless clear from Soviet statements that
they consider strategic nuclear balance as the
most influential aspect of this spectrum.
Foreign policy advisers
It is possible to excuse, at least partially, Car
ter's gullibility by his inexperience in foreign
policy. However, no such justification is possi
ble in the case of his foreign policy advisers.
They are, after all , professionals.
Most of the foreign policy experts in the Car
ter administration, including Zbigniew
Brzezinski, whom the press in its infinite wis
dom chose to portray as a hardliner, have based
their policies on the hope that U.S. unilateral
pursuance of the ideals of detente will eventu
ally induce a responsible Soviet behavior. For
example, burgeoning U.S.-Soviet trade was
seen by these officials as forcing Soviet depen
dence on the U.S. economy and together with
the growing cultural ties, gradually to bring
about convergence of the two socio-political
systems.
Fresh blood
In the light ol the failure of the above political
strategy, it is imperative that Carter, if he is now
really ready to confront Moscow, replace his old
foreign policy team with some fresh blood, just
the same way that a private business firm would
dismiss administrators guilty of mismanage
ment.
New people, particularly those that have al
ways had a more prudent view of the U.S.S.R.
will not have an incentive to cover their past
misjudgements with further mistakes, and will
be able to help the president to reappraise the
direction of U.S. foreign policy and, hopefully,
to prevent new and perhaps even more daring
Soviet adventures.
(terry Fleischhacker is a research assistant at the
Hoover Institution.)
In order to shed more light on the current
deterioration of U.S.—Soviet relations, it is
helpful to take a retrospective look at the U.S.
response to overt Soviet provocations during
the past few months.
After Senator Allan Stone (D.-Fla.) made pub
lic the discovery of Soviet combat troops in
Cuba, President jimmy Carter declared that this
situation is incongruent with the security in
terests of the United States and, therefore, un
acceptable.
However, in the following weeks Carter's out
rage was evidently placated, at least partly, by
Soviet explanations and, more importantly, by
his fervent wish not to jeopardize Senate ratifi
cation of the already embattled SALT II treaty.
Carrying a toothpick
When the Iranian militant "students," with
the overt endorsement of that country's leaders,
took over our embassy in Tehran, Carter's re
sponse was once again strictly oratorical. In
sharp contrast toTeddy Roosevelt's counsel, the
United States once again spoke strongly and
carried a stick the size of a toothpick.
Fven today, with our citizens being held hos
tage for over two months in transgression of the
most basic principles of international law, the
Carter administration is hesitant to impose
economic sanctions against Iran without the
blessing of the U.N. Security Council.
It is important that the American people
realize that in this instance the pursuit of a lofty
ideal in fact relegates the authority to authorize
this measure aimed at securing the release of
our hostages to a body where it can be defeated
by Soviet veto or by six votes from "world pow
ers" such as Jamaica and Zambia.
Moscow's ties
The Soviet Union, while critical of "U.S. im
perialism," has publicly called for release of the
American hostages. However, several Western
analysts have indicated that Moscow has at least
indirect ties with the Iranian "students." In addi
tion, Soviet radio broadcasts in Farsi into Iran
were aimed at further fueling the crisis.
The lack of an effective U.S. response to the
presence of Soviet combat troops in Cuba, or to
the Iranian crisis, as well as to the Cuban pre
sence in South Yemen, Ethiopia and Angola,
undoubtedly played a prominent role in the
Kremlin's decision to invade Afghanistan.
Apparently shocked by the Soviet aggression,
Carter, during an ABC-TV interview on De
cember 31,1979, let it be known that he has now
entirely altered his view of the Soviet Union.
One certainly has to wonder how the "lies of
Leonid Brezhnev" about Soviet aims in Af
ghanistan can suddenly disillusion a U.S. presi
dent during whose tenure the Soviet Union or
ganized military and political interference in the
Third World directly and through its Cuban, Vie
tnamese and East European proxies, and un
leashed vicious propaganda campaigns against
the NATO deployment of the neutron warhead
and, more recently against the modernization of
NATO theater nuclear weapons. However,
though it took Carter three years in office to
allow reality to overcome his idealism, it is al
ways better later than never.
Carter's actions
Unfortunately, once again Carter's actions do
not quite correspond with his words. While
limiting U.S.-Soviet economics and cultural ex
change are moves in the right direction, they
should be more extensive to be considered a
punishment. Some aspects of these restrictions,
especially the technology transfer which has in a
number of well documented instances aided the
unprecedented Soviet military buildup, are long
overdue.
The lifting of such restrictions should not be
based merely on the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan, or even on Soviet abstention
from other direct military invasions, but rather

on the Kremlin's total alteration of its global
foreign policy.
Unfortunately, at least in the immediate fu
ture, Soviet acceptance of an evenhanded de
tente does not seem too likely, and so assisting
the growth of an enemy's military potential con
stitutes a self-destructive U.S. policy.
