## Kramer is touching, but Joanna is lost 
### 
In the opening scene ot
Robert Benton's tor the most
part astonishing Kramer vs.
Kramer, Meryl Streep tearfully
wishes her eight-year-old son
goodnight, realizing that she
may never see him again.
Streep speaks haltingly,
searching inadequately for
something else to say. The
half-light in cinematographer
Nestor Almendros' beautiful
composition reveals the fun
damental uncertainty in
Streep's expressive face better
than any words could.
Even though the opening
shot is Streep's, Kramer isn't
really about her character at all.
After Streep leaves her hus
band, a work-obsessed,
thoroughly surprised Dustin
Hoffman, Benton focuses on
the struggle father and son
(lustin Henry) have to love and
care for each other.
This interplay becomes the
movie's heart; the Hoffman-
Henry scenes take up much of
the film's first half, and they're
likely what people will re
member most fondly after
ward.
Henry is a youngster of al
most frighteningly correct act
ing instincts; much of what he
does in the movie is impro
vised — the result of being told
the general idea of a scene and
then finding some means of
expressing it. Whether he
taunts Hoffman, or feels de
spair at the loss of his mother,
or fights for attention or is a
complete joy, there's never

any moment when you doubt
his performance; the added
touches that make it great ob
viously come straight from
some basic experience.
Yet Hoffman's performance
is the central one. I don't think
Hoffman has ever been quite
as successful at seizing and
fully exploring a role before.
Anyone who has seen a sud
denly single working father or
mother battle to cope will be
quick to respond to the fun
damental sincerity of
Hoffman'sactinginthis movie.
As in many movies about the
impact of broken marriages,
economic problems are not
the central concerns here.
Hoffman is a successful com
mercial artist, so the financial
hardships often faced by single
parents have been deem
phasized in favor of a more de
tailed examination of the emo
tional growth vitally necessary
for the success of relationships
between single parents and
their children.
This approach is daringly
successful. Benton uses com
edy to drive things along, and
Hoffman shines as he bril
liantly portrays a complex man
who progresses from a con
sumed worker who is a virtual
stranger to his son to a parent
of deep emotional involve
ment who desperately wants to
keep his child. At first, he's ter
ribly inadequate, but slowly,
painfully and, ultimately, be
lievably, Hoffman develops a
strong, mutually supportive re

lationship with his son. It's an
extremely well-modulated per
formance; whether he's por
traying intense anger or com
plete lightheartedness,
Hoffman always stays well
within his role. But for all its
power and self-assurance,
Hoffman's acting here still al
lows an audience room to
maneuver, to make their own
judgments.
But to some extent Benton
rigs the audience responses in
the latter part of the movie,
which covers the case which
Streep initiates to regain cus
tody of her son. Even though
the problem is to some degree
inevitable, the way Streep is
shortchanged in this section is
the movie's gnawing flaw.
The fundamental difficulty is
an obvious one, and Benton
must surely have been aware of
it: the audience has seen the
changes Hoffman has under
gone, whereas Streep must
continually tight against the
fact that the audience must try
to imagine the changes she
verbalizes.
Beyond the fact that she has
less screen time, Streep's
character thus can't rely on the
enormous audience involve
ment that Hoffman's character
has built up. Further, Streep is
given no real chance to in
gratiate herself with the audi
ence; she has no funny lines —
she's an icy, often distant
character. Also, Streep's sad
dled with the movie's only ob
viously wrong lines, including

the one that informs us that she
"found herself in California,"
which is such a cliche that you
don't know whether to laugh
or keep an embarrassed si
lence.
Streep's extraordinary per
formance only accentuates the
deficiencies in how her charac
ter is written; in her moving
portrayal of a woman trapped
and defeated by her marriage,
you begin to see the consider
able merit in her case for cus
tody. But instead of taking the
additional complexity this pre
sents head on, Benton backs
off.
After all the care and honesty
he's invested throughout, Ben
ton cheats us with his treat
ment of the Streep character.
And he also traps himself into
an ending that's a little too neat
for its own good, and which
relies on weakly drawn motiva
tions.
Vet it is, finally, truly remark
able how far Benton has taken
such slender movie material.
The performances of Hoffman,
Henry, Streep and )ane Ale
xander (as a woman who bef
riends both Hoffman and
Streep) are superb and insight
ful.
Kramer vs. Kramer doesn't
quite go all the way, but de
spite that, there's often a
greatness — a powerful emo
tional force — driving this
movie, and it's likely that this
more positive impression will
be the lasting one.
