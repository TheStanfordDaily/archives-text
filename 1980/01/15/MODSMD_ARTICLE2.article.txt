# Assembly calls for Soviet withdrawal
##

The Los Angeles Times
United Nations —The General As
sembly voted 104 to 18 yesterday to
call for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan.
The assembly action does not carry
the force of a resolution by the Sec
urity Council, where a Soviet veto
blocked a similar measure, but (he
size of the majority — 10 more than
the two-thirds required for passage
— was regarded as a moral indict
ment ot the Soviet move into Af
ghanistan.
Although the resolution did not
specifically mention Soviet forces,
calling tor the withdrawal of foreign
troops in general, the vote clearly
was directed at Soviet intervention.
Eighteen nations abstained, and
not even the entire Soviet bloc held
together. Romania, the most inde
pendent of the Soviet bloc states in
Eastern Europe, did not participate.
The 18 nations voting against the
measure were the Soviet Union, Af
ghanistan, Angola, Bulgaria,
Byelorussia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia,
Ethiopia, East Germany, Grenada,

Hungary, Laos, Mongolia, Mozam
bique, Poland, South Yemen, Uk
raine and Vietnam.
Most of the 18 nations that
abstained have traditionally sup
ported the Soviet Union. Among that
groupwas India. However, India said
it accepted Soviet assurances that its
troops were in Afghanistan at the in
vitation of the Afghan government
and condemned the United States
tor proposing arms aid to Pakistan.
ioining the majority was Iran,
which was considered somewhat of a
surprise in the light ot Iran's stub
born opposition to U.N. efforts to
tree the American hostages held by
Iranian militants at the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran.
Soviet Ambassador Oleg
Troyanovsky, whose veto ol a Sec
urity Council resolution )an. 7 re
sulted in moving the Afghanistan
issue to the General Assembly,
spoke yesterday near the end ot the
tour-day session. He repeated the
contention he made in the Security
Council — that the matter was a pri
vate one between the Soviet Union

and the Afghan government.
Mexico and the Philippines, two
non-aligned members ot the Security
Council, moved to send the matter to
the General Assembly after the
Soviet veto. And it was 21 non
aligned nations that sponsored the
assembly resolution that eventually
passed, condemning the interven
tion.
Troyanovsky, recognizing that the
overwhelming majority was forming
against him, issued a warning to the
United States, which he charged was
the prime mover ot the withdrawal
measure.
"The unilateral measures taken by
the United States are tantamount to a
serious miscalculation in politics,"
Troyanovsky said in what was re
garded as a threat to employ similar
tactics against Western vetoes in
controversies involving Israel or
South Africa.
"Like a boomerang," the Soviet
envoy said, "they will hit back at their
initiators, if not today, then tomor
row."
Cuba — a Soviet ally previously si

lent in the debate — took the floor
yesterday to denounce the United
States rather than to defend Mos
cow's action.
Cuba currently holds the leader
ship of the non-aligned movement of
nearly 100 nations, constituting two
thirds of the membership of the Un
ited Nations. Cuba, like the Soviet
Union, has traditionally presented
Moscow as the "natural ally" of the
Third World.
Significantly, no meeting of the
non-aligned envoys here has been
called by Cuban Ambassador Raul
Roa since the Soviet invasion. Be
cause all seven non-aligned mem
bers of the 15-nation Security Coun
cil voted Jan. 7 to condemn the
Soviet action, members of the
movement speculated that the Cu
bans were probably too embarrassed
to assemble the group.
Although delegates or other non
aiigned nations spoke in the Security
112 uncil and the subsequent debate,
in the assembly, Roa did not appear
until the final hours of the session.
When he finally spoke, he barely
mentioned the Soviet Union and its
action. Instead, Roa called the spe
cial session of the assembly a "prear
ranged fuss" in which the U.S. "rul
ers ripped their clothes off" to de
mand respect for international law.
"The Yankee chorus has been
joined by the Pinochets (a reference
to Chilean President Augosto
Pinochet), guilty of the genocide of
their peoples; by the Pekingese
(Chinese) traitors, who only recently
shed the blood of heroic Vietnam
and by others ot the same kin," Roa
said.
Second only to Cuba in the de
fense of Moscow was /ehdi Labib
Terzi, representative in the assembly
of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion, who failed even to mention Af
ghanistan as he hotly criticized the
U.S. role in the Middle East.
U.S. Ambassador Donald
McHenry, who spoke earlier in the
assembly debate, made no reply to
yesterday's attacks by Troyanovsky,
Roa and Terzi, and U.S. officials said
later that he would not comment on
the vote.
The assembly has voted in the past
to call for troop withdrawals after
Security Council vetoes. In the case
of the Hungarian invasion of 1956,
Moscow ignored the assembly's ap
peal and few expect the Soviets to
heed this one.
