# Disney's Black Hole is no Sleeping Beauty
## 
### 
Foust made into a Disney
movie? That's enough to throw
otl even the most accepting ol
movie tans. But that's exactly
what audiences are getting
with The Black Hole, the $20
million science fiction epic
from Walt Disney.
All that money was spent
with good intentions. But
the end product is less than
Hilly satisfactory. The HUick
Hole isn't sure whether it is a
G-rated children's film, a hard
science fiction epic or an alleg
ory about man's place in the
universe. And if the filmmakers
seem to be confused by this
vast range ol aims, then there is
little doubt why audiences are
left so contused by, and there
tore dissatisfied with, this film.
The film's premise comes
from Larry Niven-style science
fiction. A spaceship of several
hundred years from now
comes across a black hole, a
bottomless gravity well that
sucks up everything in its path.
To their amazement they find
an Earth ship, long presumed

to be destroyed, resisting the
black hole's seemingly irresis
tible gravitational pull. But it
wasn't destroyed and is man
ned by its original commander
(Maximilian Schell) and a host
ot robots.
Upon entering the ship, the
heavier plot elements start to
take shape. It becomes clear
that our Mad Scientist is a
megalomaniac, a brilliant man
who has mastered the secret ol
the black hole and will let no
thing stop him in his attempt to
travel through the galactic
aberration into whatever uni
verse is beyond.
The implication is that he has
made a pact with the devil tor
this knowledge, though we
don't tind out until very late
what this devil is, and by the
end of the film we find that he
must pay the price ot this pact.
Such ideas could be integrated
into a science fiction story to
good effect, and have been in
literature. Unfortunately the
Disney writers are not skillful
enough to do this.

These grand themes are car
ried off reasonably well for a
time, though not brilliantly.
Then the robots get in the way.
The robots in the film are
clearly aimed at the children in
the audience, but since most ol
the film is far beyond the aver
age 10 year-old, there seems
little point in going to this
trouble. The robots all have
cutsie names like
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and Old
8.0.8., and their characteriza
tion lives down to the promise
of their names. The scene in
which the robots practice at
target shooting is particularly
insipid and tiring.
The final blow to the be
lievability ot the film's grand
scope is the ending. The final
sequence is highly visual and
allegorical and seems aimed
more at tying up the film's
themes rather than the charac
ters' actions. This is completely
at odds with the rest of the film,
which is made in the realistic
style one expects from a hard st
story. I still haven't figured out

what happens to the heroes at
the end of the film, in spite of
being able to tollow everything
up to that point. Most ot the
audience was unwilling to ac
cept a purely metaphysical en
ding and simply scoffed.
All this is not to say that the
film doesn't succeed in creat
ing a semblance ot epic grand
eur. Two elements combine to
save the film from disaster.
One is Maximilian Schell,
whose magnetism comes
through in every performance
he gives. If anyone can be be
lievable as selling his soul for
the secrets of the universe, it is
Schell.
The other key element is the
quality of the special effects.
The effects are always both te
chnically masterful and visually
spectacular. Perhaps the most
enthralling sequence is the
breakup ot the ship, when all
the torces of the black hole
conspire to stop the trip to the
center. But equally eftective,
though less breathtaking, are
the space scenes in which the
crew floats about the ship in
zero gravity as it nothing at all
were the matter.
It is too bad that the Disney
writers couldn't be as success
ful as the studio's technicians.
Walt Disney Productions has
always been insular and not
prone to accept outside ideas;
especially since Walt Disney's
death, the quality ot Disney
films has suffered due to this
flaw. Perhaps the Disney
people have sold their souls to
the devil for Snow White and
the Seven Dwarls and are now
paying the price. In any case,
The Black Hole needn't be av
oided at all costs, but it cer
tainly shouldn't be at the top ot
your list.

which the robots practice at
target shooting is particularly
insipid and tiring.
The final blow to the be
lievability ot the film's grand
scope is the ending. The final
sequence is highly visual and
allegorical and seems aimed
more at tying up the film's
themes rather than the charac
ters' actions. This is completely
at odds with the rest of the film,
which is made in the realistic
style one expects from a hard st
story. I still haven't figured out

what happens to the heroes at
the end of the film, in spite of
being able to tollow everything
up to that point. Most ot the
audience was unwilling to ac
cept a purely metaphysical en
ding and simply scoffed.
All this is not to say that the
film doesn't succeed in creat
ing a semblance ot epic grand
eur. Two elements combine to
save the film from disaster.
One is Maximilian Schell,
whose magnetism comes
through in every performance
he gives. If anyone can be be
lievable as selling his soul for
the secrets of the universe, it is
Schell.
The other key element is the
quality of the special effects.
The effects are always both te
chnically masterful and visually
spectacular. Perhaps the most
enthralling sequence is the
breakup ot the ship, when all
the torces of the black hole
conspire to stop the trip to the
center. But equally eftective,
though less breathtaking, are
the space scenes in which the
crew floats about the ship in
zero gravity as it nothing at all
were the matter.
It is too bad that the Disney
writers couldn't be as success
ful as the studio's technicians.
Walt Disney Productions has
always been insular and not
prone to accept outside ideas;
especially since Walt Disney's
death, the quality ot Disney
films has suffered due to this
flaw. Perhaps the Disney
people have sold their souls to
the devil for Snow White and
the Seven Dwarls and are now
paying the price. In any case,
The Black Hole needn't be av
oided at all costs, but it cer
tainly shouldn't be at the top ot
your list.

Disney Productions.
Foust made into a Disney
movie? That's enough to throw
otl even the most accepting ol
movie tans. But that's exactly
what audiences are getting
with The Black Hole, the $20
million science fiction epic
from Walt Disney.
All that money was spent
with good intentions. But
the end product is less than
Hilly satisfactory. The HUick
Hole isn't sure whether it is a
G-rated children's film, a hard
science fiction epic or an alleg
ory about man's place in the
universe. And if the filmmakers
seem to be confused by this
vast range ol aims, then there is
little doubt why audiences are
left so contused by, and there
tore dissatisfied with, this film.
The film's premise comes
from Larry Niven-style science
fiction. A spaceship of several
hundred years from now
comes across a black hole, a
bottomless gravity well that
sucks up everything in its path.
To their amazement they find
an Earth ship, long presumed

to be destroyed, resisting the
black hole's seemingly irresis
tible gravitational pull. But it
wasn't destroyed and is man
ned by its original commander
(Maximilian Schell) and a host
ot robots.
Upon entering the ship, the
heavier plot elements start to
take shape. It becomes clear
that our Mad Scientist is a
megalomaniac, a brilliant man
who has mastered the secret ol
the black hole and will let no
thing stop him in his attempt to
travel through the galactic
aberration into whatever uni
verse is beyond.
The implication is that he has
made a pact with the devil tor
this knowledge, though we
don't tind out until very late
what this devil is, and by the
end of the film we find that he
must pay the price ot this pact.
Such ideas could be integrated
into a science fiction story to
good effect, and have been in
literature. Unfortunately the
Disney writers are not skillful
enough to do this.

These grand themes are car
ried off reasonably well for a
time, though not brilliantly.
Then the robots get in the way.
The robots in the film are
clearly aimed at the children in
the audience, but since most ol
the film is far beyond the aver
age 10 year-old, there seems
little point in going to this
trouble. The robots all have
cutsie names like
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and Old
8.0.8., and their characteriza
tion lives down to the promise
of their names. The scene in
which the robots practice at
target shooting is particularly
insipid and tiring.
