# Spyro's not short on energy

ASSU Special Events director
John Harris promised review
ers a concert "so good that the
ink will tly right out of your
pens," and while my hands
remained tree of stains as of
this writing, Eriday night's
Spyro Gyra concert in Tresid
der Union nevertheless made
for quite an enjoyable evening.
Special Events, without ar
gument, deserves much credit
for the efforts made recently to
both attract musical talent to
the campus (Stephen Stills,
Dave Mason, Southside
Johnny) and to find a decent
place for it to be heard when it

arrives.
The "Tresidder Ballroom,"
as the latest effort at locating
such a spot has been dubbed,
certainly creates some nice ef
fects for an audience, and is
clearly superior to Memorial
and Dinkelspiel auditoriums in
providing a more intimate,
club-like atmosphere.
Spyro Gyra played two con
certs, a trend that will for the
most part continue it the "Bal
lroom" is used in the future,
as there are not enough seats
in the room to make profitable
one longer concert. The band's
start was somewhat sluggish,

but wound up quite smooth,
and by the end of the second
show the band was playing to
three standing ovations and
three encores. (The more re
served audience at the lirst
show earned themselves only
two, but then they didn't rise
out ot their seats to get them.)
In fact, Spyro Gyra's de
velopment through the night
was mirrored in the
limbering-up of the band's
sixth member, whose function
was somewhat unclear at the
outset, but seemed to involve a
lot of running around, yelling
and releasing of pent-up
energy (he had a lot), sort of
like the Stanford yell leaders
(remember them?) of bygone
years. Yes, he played the bon
gos and waggled a tambourine
a few times, but his heart
seemed to be more in jumping
up and down, clapping, sprint
ing through the aisles, and in
convincing an initially sedate
crowd to do the same.
He clapped faster, jumped
higher and ran farther as the
night progressed and so,
metaphorically speaking, did
the band's music. And people
enjoyed themselves more and
more. What had been a
straggly beginning in a room
that could have been com
pared to a sterile high school
auditorium (with the lights up)
became a fine evening of jazz.
And what the heck, the gym
nast up on stage looked kind of
cute and kind of macho, there
in his UCLA muscle shirt, and
above all he was having a good
time, so why couldn't we also?
A final word about the
music. It is good, and almost all
of it was composed by mem
bers of the band. It is jazz, but
not pure jazz, as some of the
synthesizing added a steady,
noticeable rhythm, a beat that
at times surfaced into some
thing approaching (with all
apologies to the band mem
bers) disco. But it is very listen
able, and danceable too (not
that the "Ballroom" provides
much room for it.) If these boys
mellowed out a bit, they would
sound a lot like Chuck Man
gione, but they seem intent on
not doing so, and on releasing
a fury all their own.
