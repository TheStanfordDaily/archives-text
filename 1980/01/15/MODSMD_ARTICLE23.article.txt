# A 						poet of gesture tries his hand at a speaking part
## 
### 
Edward Villella was not exactly boring,
hut it was clear trom his Mlk in Memorial
Auditorium Sunday that the principal
dancer lor the New York City Ballet would
never have made his career as an orator.
His talk dragged on and on and it was quite
a let down to see him come out on stage in
street clothes instead of tights.
But the subject matter certainly saved
his show. Ballet makes you honest, he
said, and the tales ot how a truck driver's
son from Queens, New York became one
ot the premier male dancers in the world
were certainly worth hearing.
Villella lirst started to dance, he said,
when his mother dragged him to his sis
ter's ballet lessons because he was too un
ruly to leave home unattended. The fidgety
nine year old trying to mock the class's
exercises suddenly discovered he was very
good. Later, when his mother ran his
tights out on the neighborhood washline,
thereby disclosing his up to (hen secret
love, Villella, a future collegiate boxing
champion, had to explain his position to
his friends in true inner city style.
After being forced by a father none too
happy with his son-the-dancer to earn an
engineering degree from a military
academy, Villella joined the New York City
Ballet and its brilliant choreographer
George Balanchine. He has been with the
company ever since, though he has not
missed opportunities to dance with other
companies around the world.
Villella kicked off his Sunday talk, part of
the 1980 Lively Arts Season, with a movie
he produced, "Dance ot the Athletes."

The film, intended for TV, tries to
popularize ballet, to further the growing
public interest in the art which Villella says
is experiencing a golden age. In the films
the movements of the dancers are com
paredto those ot athletic stars Tom Seaver,
Bob Griese, George McGinnis and Virginia
Wade.
Villella is a good man to make what he
calls the human art even more accessible
than it has already become. Ori stage and
in his movie he is a model of grace and
strength, a cross between a sculpture and
a gazelle spinning and floating through
space.
But lecturing in his leisure suit with his
New York accent and childhood stories,
he seems like )ohn Doe giving a talk at a
Cub Scout dinner.
That is until he steps from behind the
podium, and while explaining that the job
of a classical dancer is to make the un
natural look innate, delivers a series of
gestures so graceful that they defy any at
tempt at repetition by any mere mortals.
Villella said he loves the freedom of his
dance, the feeling that as he moves across
stage apparently off balance he is actually
in complete control of every part of his
body. He showed the basic idea behind his
movements, the circles made by hands
and arms, and the passing through every
position to move from one to another.
He described the pas de deux, the duet
between a male and female dancer. Once
he was very bad at partnering, the skill of
dancing with another. But after years of
practice when ballerinas would do their

utmost to avoid being paired with him, he
became good. His talk ranged from the
tender description of the intense coopera
tion between two individuals on stage to
the comic tale of an associate who, at
tempting to lift a ballerina above his head,
forgot the girl but launched her dress.
But though he is a classical dancer, Vil
lella is certainly not a traditionalist. It is
fitting that this independent New Yorker
would say he has trouble sitting through
performances of Swon Lake and that he
much prefers to help create new ballets to
relearning old ones. Compared to the
companies of Europe and the Soviet Un
ion, Villella called his New York City Ballet
the most innovative in the world.
In fact, Villella attributed the recent de
tections of several ot Russia's top dancers
to the West to their desire for artistic di
versity and expression. A dancer begins
his or her studies about the age of ten,
Villella explained and can dance for nearly
thirty years. The Soviets have little use for
any innovative dance and he said three
decades ot 19th century ballet can get a
little tedious.
Villella's stories were certainly interes
ting, but theirdelivery was not much more
than homely. He described ballet as the
poetry of gesture, but he was certainly no
poet. )ust watching him take steps on the
stage one could easily imagine that all his
stories could be captured best, not in
words, but in just a moment of spinning,
of flying, of dance.
