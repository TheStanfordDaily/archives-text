Fighting slows in Afghanistan
Soviet troops captured control o! one ol Al
ghanistan's two major highways, and lighting
throughout the Central Asian nation has become
much slower in the past lew days, according to
Western diplomatic sources in the capital ot
Kabul.
One Western informant in Kabul said lighting
had stopped "almost everywhere." Others said it
was continuing in the rugged, snow-covered
mountains in northeastern Badakhshan Province,
near the Soviet border, and in Paktia, southeast ot
Kabul and near Pakistan, where Soviet troops re
portedly were backed by missile-firing MiG
warplanes and helicopter gunships.

they can go on harassing the Russians torever,"
one diplomatic source in Kabul said ot the Moslem
rebels, who have been staging a holy war against a
succession ol three pro-Soviet Atghan regimes tor
the past 20 months.
"They have been doing this sort ot thing for
c enturies," he said, referring to Afghanistan's his
tory ol resisting foreign troops.
No end in sight for U.S. hostages
Washington — Carter administration officials,
blocked by a Soviet veto in their bid lor United
Nations sanctions against Iran, said yesterday thai
ettorts to free the American hostages there could
drag on tor weeks or even months without resolu
tion.
That, administration sources said privately, is
the reality behind President |immy Carter's state
ments yesterday condemning the Soviet veto as an
offense to "all who honor freedom'" and urging
other countries to join the United States in putting
economic pressure on lra:<.
Underlying Carter's appeal, the sources con
ceded, is a tacit admission that the United States

has run through the list ot peacetul measures it can
bring to bear on the crisis and must resign itself, at
least tor the time being, to waiting and hoping that
Iranian authorities will tire.
As they have done frequently throughout the
70-day crisis, the sources insisted that U.S. pati
ence is "not infinite" and could give way at some
point to a naval blockade ol Iran or other military
action. But, they added, while military responses
remain "a live option," there is no plan to apply
them at present.

Lance, saying "I'm ready to go," went on trial in
federal court yesterday with three co-defendants
on changes of misusing $20 million in bank tunds.
Jury selection got under way after U.S. District
ludge Charles Moye rejected a request by Lance's
lawyers to dismiss the charges. They claimed that
news leaks influenced the indictment ot their
client.
Moye dismissed 21 prospective panelists who
said it would be a severe hardship to stay tor the
two months the trial is expected to last.
Lance and three friends, all north Georgia
businessmen, are on trial on charges of conspi
racy, bank fraud and misuse of bank tunds. The
indictment cites $20 million in loans from 41 banks
to the delendants, their Iriends and families.

Washington — Presidential candidate Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.» got a pair ol timely boosts yes
terday as two key union presidents — Douglas
Fraser, ol the United Auto Workers, and Fred
Kroll, of the Brotherhood ol Railway and Airline
Clerks — announced their support ol his chal
lenge to President limmy Carter.
Fraser, whose 1.4-million-member union played
an important role in helping Carter win the Demo
cratic nomination and the presidency in 1976,
scheduled a press conference tor this alternoon to
announce his endorsement of Kennedy.
Kroll said he had tiled at his home in Pennsyl
vania for election to the Democratic National Con
vention as a delegate committed to Kennedy.
Both men said their endorsements were per
sonal, but officials of both unions said the presi
dents' decisions made it probable that the unions
would back Kennedy lor the Democratic nomina
tions.
Alternatives to oil encouraged
Washington — In an effort to promote alterna
tives to oil, the Department ot Energy (DOE) an
nounced yesterday that it would distribute $2.2
billion this year to companies producing energy
from oil shale, coal, garbage and other unconven
tional sources.
The department wants the industry to work on
new fuels even betore creation ot the govern
ment's proposed Energy Security Corp., designed
to encourage development ot synthetic fuels.
Both houses ol Congress have passed legislation
providing lor development of such tuels, and the
final compromise version ot the legislation will be
settled alter Congress returns later this month.
In an effort to expedite production of fuels to

replace oil, Congress last year approved a special
$2.2 billion appropriation lor the DOE. President
)immy Carter signed the bill on Nov. 29, and the
department announced its general spending plans
yesterday, unusually quick action in energy policy
making.
Ford prosecution restricted
Winanac, Ind. — The judge in the trial of Ford
Motor Co., on charges of reckless homicide, re
stricted the prosecution's use yesterday ot key
documents dealing with detective Pinto fuel tanks.
In the documents, a Ford official estimated that
an $11 improvement in the luel tanks of 12.5 mill
ion Ford cars and trucks could save an estimated
180 lives. But the official said the total cost of the
changes outweighed the benefits in saving human
life. The documents put a $200,000 price on each
life lost.
The documents also recommended a delay in
any improvements until they were mandated by
tuture federal safety standards.
The charges against the automaker stem from an
August 1978 crash in which three teenagers
burned to death. Their 1973 Pinto sedan exploded
when it was hit from behind by a van traveling 50
mph on a northern Indiana highway.
The prosecution contends that Ford knew Pinto
fuel tanks were defective but did nothing about it.
Nader attacks admission tests
Washington — The Educational Testing Service's
multiple-choice admission tests are "a consumer
fraud" that do a poor job in predicting college
performance and are biased against minorities, a
Ralph Nader-sponsored study charged.
Nader compared ETS' Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT), Law School Admission Test (LSAT),
Graduate Record Examinations (CRE) and
Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT),
which more than two million American students
take each year, to "a roulette game."
"People are struck out ot opportunities in edu
cational career areas on the basis of a three-hour
test," he said. Standardized tests "don't measure
judgment, wisdom, experience, creativity,
stamina, determination — the actual characteris
tics that make for progress in human history."
Market continues upward climb
New York — Gold, silver and copper issues
racked up some dramatic gains yesterday as the
stock market continued its early 1980-rally. Trad
ing continued at a Irenetic pace.
The Dow jones average ot JO industrials, coming
off a gain ot nearly 30 points last week, climbed
another 5.04 to a three-month high of 863.57.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 52.93
million shares, nearly matching last week's record
daily average of 54.42 million.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today leading to a chance ot
rain late today becoming likely tonight and tomor
row. Lows in the mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs in the
mid 50s to low 60s. Chance ot rain 20 percent today

documents dealing with detective Pinto fuel tanks.
In the documents, a Ford official estimated that
an $11 improvement in the luel tanks of 12.5 mill
ion Ford cars and trucks could save an estimated
180 lives. But the official said the total cost of the

life lost.
The documents also recommended a delay in
any improvements until they were mandated by

The charges against the automaker stem from an
August 1978 crash in which three teenagers
burned to death. Their 1973 Pinto sedan exploded
when it was hit from behind by a van traveling 50

The prosecution contends that Ford knew Pinto

Ford prosecution restricted
Winanac, Ind. — The judge in the trial of Ford
Motor Co., on charges of reckless homicide, re
stricted the prosecution's use yesterday ot key
documents dealing with detective Pinto fuel tanks.
In the documents, a Ford official estimated that
an $11 improvement in the luel tanks of 12.5 mill
ion Ford cars and trucks could save an estimated
180 lives. But the official said the total cost of the
changes outweighed the benefits in saving human
life. The documents put a $200,000 price on each
life lost.
The documents also recommended a delay in
any improvements until they were mandated by
tuture federal safety standards.
The charges against the automaker stem from an
August 1978 crash in which three teenagers
burned to death. Their 1973 Pinto sedan exploded
when it was hit from behind by a van traveling 50
mph on a northern Indiana highway.
The prosecution contends that Ford knew Pinto
fuel tanks were defective but did nothing about it.
Nader attacks admission tests
Washington — The Educational Testing Service's
multiple-choice admission tests are "a consumer
fraud" that do a poor job in predicting college
performance and are biased against minorities, a
Ralph Nader-sponsored study charged.
Nader compared ETS' Scholastic Aptitude Test
(SAT), Law School Admission Test (LSAT),
Graduate Record Examinations (CRE) and
Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT),
which more than two million American students
take each year, to "a roulette game."
"People are struck out ot opportunities in edu
cational career areas on the basis of a three-hour
test," he said. Standardized tests "don't measure
judgment, wisdom, experience, creativity,
stamina, determination — the actual characteris
tics that make for progress in human history."

U.S. newsmen kicked out of Iran
Tehran, Iran — The government of Iran yester
day officially announced the expulsion of all
American news organizations.
Following an announcement by the ruling Re
volutionary Council last night, Abolghassem
Sagegh, toreign press director ot the Ministry ot
National Guidance, said American journalists and
technicians working tor American news agencies
would have "two or three days" to leave the coun
try.
"It you can't get an airline ticket within 48 hours
we're not going to send you out on a camel,''
Sagegh said, indicating that the expulsion order
may be a relaxed affair stretching over several
days.
The official announcement came Irom All
Akhbar Monifar, the Iranian oil minister, speaking
tor the Revolutionary Council which met last
night. He said British and West German news cor
respondents, who along with Americans were
threatened with expulsion a week ago, would be
given "the next lew days" to prove themselves to
revolutionary leaders by their reporting betore
they, too, are expelled.
All three American networks plus the two
American news agencies — The Associated Press
and United Press International — are included in
the expulsion orders, according to Sagegh.
Fighting slows in Afghanistan
Soviet troops captured control o! one ol Al
ghanistan's two major highways, and lighting
throughout the Central Asian nation has become
much slower in the past lew days, according to
Western diplomatic sources in the capital ot
Kabul.
One Western informant in Kabul said lighting
had stopped "almost everywhere." Others said it
was continuing in the rugged, snow-covered
mountains in northeastern Badakhshan Province,
near the Soviet border, and in Paktia, southeast ot
Kabul and near Pakistan, where Soviet troops re
portedly were backed by missile-firing MiG
warplanes and helicopter gunships.
"They cannot win tor they have no planes, but
they can go on harassing the Russians torever,"
one diplomatic source in Kabul said ot the Moslem
rebels, who have been staging a holy war against a
succession ol three pro-Soviet Atghan regimes tor
the past 20 months.
"They have been doing this sort ot thing for
c enturies," he said, referring to Afghanistan's his
tory ol resisting foreign troops.
No end in sight for U.S. hostages
Washington — Carter administration officials,
blocked by a Soviet veto in their bid lor United
Nations sanctions against Iran, said yesterday thai
ettorts to free the American hostages there could
drag on tor weeks or even months without resolu
tion.
That, administration sources said privately, is
the reality behind President |immy Carter's state
ments yesterday condemning the Soviet veto as an
offense to "all who honor freedom'" and urging
other countries to join the United States in putting
economic pressure on lra:<.
Underlying Carter's appeal, the sources con
ceded, is a tacit admission that the United States

has run through the list ot peacetul measures it can
bring to bear on the crisis and must resign itself, at
least tor the time being, to waiting and hoping that
Iranian authorities will tire.
As they have done frequently throughout the
70-day crisis, the sources insisted that U.S. pati
ence is "not infinite" and could give way at some
point to a naval blockade ol Iran or other military
action. But, they added, while military responses
remain "a live option," there is no plan to apply
them at present.
