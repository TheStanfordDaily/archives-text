Ralph Waldo Emerson can rest easy.
After a hastily organized campaign to save a group of avocado trees that
date back to the founding of the University, officials here have worked out a
compromise.
The seven trees, growing in the courtyard between Building 1 in the Inner
Quad and Building 120 in the Outer Quad, had faced the possibility of
removal in connection with the reconstruction of Building 120.
But Don Price, project coordinator in Facilities Planning, reported yester
day that after a series of meetings between the contractor and University
officials, it was decided that only one tree — the one nearest Building 120 —
will be removed.
Price said another, smaller one near President Richard Lyman's office in
Building 1 would be trimmed back, but that all the others, including the
tallest and oldest next to the Memorial Court arches, will be saved.
The mini-controversy arose before the holidays, when contractor Ralph
Larsen of Burlingame told University officials he could save $39,000 by taking
out all the trees so his heavy equipment could work in the area.
But the proposal met opposition from a groi'p oi concerned professors
and staff, led by Chemistry Prof. Eric Hutchinson and Ronald Bracewell,
protessor of radioscience and electrical engineering, who is also a member
of the International Shadetree Conference.
