# USE general manager resigns
## 
### 
The turbulent history of United
Stanford Employees (USE) has taken
another twist recently with the resig
nation of union General Manager
David Novogrodsky and union Pres
ident Mike Harris.
The resignations will be presented
to the USE membership this after
noon at the union's regular member
ship meeting.
There was considerable member
ship opposition to Novogrodsky's
handling of last summer's contract
negotiations with the University.
Many members objected to what
they considered his railroading of
the contract through membership
approval. They charged he misrep
resented the terms of the contract to
ensure ratification.
Novogrodsky said the contract was
a good one and that he felt it was
fairly presented to the membership.
One error that both he and union
consultant Teressa Ghilarducci ad
mitted later was that they over-stated
the benefits of the contract's pension
provisions during the presentation
of the contract to the membership.
Novogrodsky and Ghilarducci con
tend the error was unintentional.

Novogrodsky said he will be leav
ing at the end ol lanuary. He said he
has not yet accepted a job with
another union but he plans to seek a
union position. He also will teach a
class at the College of San Mateo.
Novogrodsky said although there
is "a lot of turmoil in the union, I like
a lot ol things about the union." He
said he feels he has accomplished
many ot the things he set out to do
when he accepted the position last
spring.
Novogrodsky said he sees his
handling ot the grievance load, the
formation of a steward's council, the
ratification ot the new contract in
September and aiding the organizing
campaign of campus office workers
as his primary contributions to the
union. "It's in better shape than it
ever was," Novogrodsky said.
Mike Baratz, an administrator of
local 715 ot Service Employees Inter
national, the same international to
which USE belongs, will act as an "in
terim replacement" for the general
manager, Novogrodsky said. The de
cision to bring in Baratz was made
before Novogrodsky's resignation
was submitted.

Union members and observers
said privately that there has been a
movement atoot for months to fire
Novogrodsky. In light of this pres
sure, Novogrodsky asked the inter
national to institute a trusteeship, in
which one individual virtually con
trols the union, a strong outside con
trol many members didn't want.
Instead, the union's Executive
Committee has decided to bring in
an administrator, Baratz, to conduct
some union reorganization.
The international approved that
action. Novogrodsky said the inter
national will stay out of USE's internal
problems unless Baratz asks for in
volvement.
Novogrodsky said the most impor
tant tasksfacingthe union leadership
involve bylaw changes, staff and of
fice reorganization. He said he be
lieves Baratz will be of great help to
the union.
Harris is leaving the University in
early February, Novogrodsky said,
and his replacement will be chosen
after Harris' regular one-year term
would have expired this spring.
Harris is reportedly moving to
Alaska, for personal reasons.
