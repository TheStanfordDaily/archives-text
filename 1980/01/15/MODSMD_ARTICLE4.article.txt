## 
### Monika Guttman 
Rep. Pete McCloskey, (R-Menlo
Park) has sponsored a state-wide in
itiative campaign to eliminate the
winner-take-all structure of the
California Republican presidential
primaries.
Under the present law, the candi
date who wins the most votes in the

California Republican primary gets
all the state's delegate votes at the
national nominating convention.
McCloskey's initiative would change
the system to a proportional distribu
tion of delegate votes, based on the
results of the primary election.
With 168 delegates to the Republi
can convention, California is the only
remaining state with a winner-take
all structure.
McCloskey headed the drive to

collect the necessary 360,000 signa
tures by )an. 1, which would place
the initiative on the state's June bal
lot and allow both Democrats and
Republicans to vote on the issue.
"We have filed all the petitions,
and there were a total of 494,131 sig
natures, "said )oan Williams of
McCloskey's office in Palo Alto.
"Probably 40 percent of these are not
valid."
The signatures have not yet been
verified by the state Elections Com
mission.
According to Pat Fowler of San
Mateo County Republican Head
quarters, the Republican Central
Committee voted three-to-one last
September against changing the law
until after the elections this year.
"I voted not to change the law,"
she said. "And I believe only the Re
publicans should vote on the issue.
But some people, like McCloskey,
didn't like the idea that all the dele
gates would be given to one candi
date this year."
The Democratic party changed its
policy in 1976, she said.
McCloskey, who supports former
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) di
rector George Bush for president,
believes that former Gov. Ronald
Reagan would get all the state's dele
gates under the present system, said
Williams.
"McCloskey feels no other candi
dates would spend money in the
state to campaign, and, therefore,
the electorate would not be fully in
formed," she said.
fowler said that McCloskey's ef
forts have not caused a split within
the Republican party.
