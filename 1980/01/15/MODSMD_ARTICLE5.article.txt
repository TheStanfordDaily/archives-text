# Impending leadership changes to affect U.S.-Soviet relations

### Victor Goetz (Last in a series 
The prospect of changes in leadership in both the
Soviet Union and the United States should play the
key role in determining the future of U.S.-Soviet rela
tions, according to History Prof. Alexander Dallin.
Though the recent Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
has enlarged the rift between the superpowers, it is
obvious that the Russians will want to wait until after
the 1980 election toseeif theywill still bedealingwith
President |immy Carter or with someone new who
might have different outlooks on detente, according
to Dallin.
Indeed, he said, the issue of relations with Russia
will likely be raised during the coming campaign, but
"it would be unlikely if a question of foreign policy
would decide the election."

On the Russian side, Leonid Brezhnev's days are
numbered and a leadership transter may not even be
delayed until his death, according to Political Science
Prof. Alexander George.
"A younger generation ot leadership has come to
the tore," said Dallin. "My impression is that no one
in this country, including (government officials) in
Washington, knows enough about the coming Rus
sian leadership."
But George did venture to characterize the

future leadership as being as much like the present as
possible. "They don't want a succession crisis. They
will not get a regime opposed to continuation of
detente. I don't see an alternative to detente, I see
variation or changes in emphasis," he said.
"We will return to better relations with the Rus
sians," George said. "Despite Carter's efforts to re
turn us to the Cold War, detente will survive.
More cautious
"Our version of detente is likely to be a much more
cautious, sober one, coupled with more sober expec
tations," said George. "We do not want to repeat the
overselling' of detente by (former President Richard)
Nixon and (former Secretary ot State Henry) Kis
singer."
Dallin, on the other hand, declared detente is cur
rently dead, "if you think of detente in terms of the
efforts of each side to come to terms with the other.
"The decision in Afghanistan obviously meant that
(the Soviets) were willing to subordinate relations
with the U.S. for other considerations," he said.
"That doesn't mean detente can't be revived, but it
will take a new effort," Dallin added.
Assoc. Prof. David Kennedy, director of the Inter
national Relations Program, said he didn't see Af
ghanistan as a necessary finale to the relaxing of
U.S.-Soviet tensions. "But," he said, "I'm saying this
more on the basis of faith than evidence."

"We're in a down period of immense proportions,
but I don't see it as an absolute end to detente," said
Political Science Prof. Robert Keohane.
The American attitude depends to a large extent on
the public image of the Russians, according to
George.
"It's important to realize that American foreign pol
icy is very sensitive to domestic feedback," he said.
The impact of the Afghanistan invasion, said
George, is to strengthen the "devil image" that
peaked during the Cold War. It also "to some extent
shakes the more moderate view (of Russia)," he said.
"The key is to what extent?"
"You can count on the Soviets, when the time
comes, to reinforce" a more tolerant view of them in
this and other countries, said George.
Lack policy
Americans have disagreed about Soviet motives
since World War 11, according to George. This
domestic conflict underlies and helps to explain all
the government's problems in developing a policy in
dealing with the Russians," a problem the Soviets
share in dealing with the U.S.
"What we need to have is a notion of where we
want to be with the Russians, what is desirable and
what is feasible," said George.
He pointed out that the major criticism ot Carter's
Soviet relations in the last two years, by both suppor-


Prof. Alexander Dallin
ters and opponents of the Strategic:
Arms Limitations Talks (SALT II), has
been a lack ot a long-range policy.
"Carter's policy' depended entirely
on SALT II, and that fell apart," he
said.
Similarly, Russian indecision over
policy stems from a long-running
inner conflict about the extent to
which the Soviets should seek
foreign contacts, according to Dallin.
"For the last generation, there's
been something of a behind-the
scenes argument in the Soviet Union
among those who did not want to
become dependent on toreign ex
change and those who advocated it,"
said Dallin.
The counterargument to tradi
tional Stalinist isolationism has been
that the Soviet economy is slowing
down, according to Dallin. "The ob
vious way to improve, as in all de
veloping nations is by bringing in ad
vanced technology, modernizations
and other necessities," he said.
The '70s represented the time
when the Soviets made their greatest

reversal ol policy, and came to the
United States for everything from
grain to computers, he said.
How much the American cutolt ol
these materials will ultimately hurt
the Russians depends mostly on how
successful the United States is in get
ting other countries to go along, said
Dallin.
If, however, Afghanistan does
send the Soviets back into isolation,
that would represent a lundamental
reversal ot affairs, according to Dal
lin.
Vet, the only immediate possibility
fora direct, head-to-head showdown
at the present time, according to Dal
lin, seems to be in Iran.
In the event that the current Ira
nian government should be toppled
or replaced, two opposing factions in
that country could form their own
governments, one appealing to the
Soviet Union lor help, the other to
the United States, said Dallin.
Both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. would
know the risks, he said, but at the
same time neither could afford to
back down.

U.S.-Soviet tensions. "But," he said, "I'm saying this
more on the basis of faith than evidence."

"We're in a down period of immense proportions,
but I don't see it as an absolute end to detente," said
Political Science Prof. Robert Keohane.
The American attitude depends to a large extent on
the public image of the Russians, according to
George.
"It's important to realize that American foreign pol
icy is very sensitive to domestic feedback," he said.
The impact of the Afghanistan invasion, said
George, is to strengthen the "devil image" that
peaked during the Cold War. It also "to some extent
shakes the more moderate view (of Russia)," he said.
"The key is to what extent?"
"You can count on the Soviets, when the time
comes, to reinforce" a more tolerant view of them in
this and other countries, said George.
Lack policy
Americans have disagreed about Soviet motives
since World War 11, according to George. This
domestic conflict underlies and helps to explain all
the government's problems in developing a policy in
dealing with the Russians," a problem the Soviets
share in dealing with the U.S.
"What we need to have is a notion of where we
want to be with the Russians, what is desirable and
what is feasible," said George.
He pointed out that the major criticism ot Carter's
Soviet relations in the last two years, by both suppor-


Prof. Alexander Dallin
ters and opponents of the Strategic:
Arms Limitations Talks (SALT II), has
been a lack ot a long-range policy.
"Carter's policy' depended entirely
on SALT II, and that fell apart," he
said.
Similarly, Russian indecision over
policy stems from a long-running
inner conflict about the extent to
which the Soviets should seek
foreign contacts, according to Dallin.
"For the last generation, there's
been something of a behind-the
scenes argument in the Soviet Union
among those who did not want to
become dependent on toreign ex
change and those who advocated it,"
said Dallin.
The counterargument to tradi
tional Stalinist isolationism has been
that the Soviet economy is slowing
down, according to Dallin. "The ob
vious way to improve, as in all de
veloping nations is by bringing in ad
vanced technology, modernizations
and other necessities," he said.
The '70s represented the time
when the Soviets made their greatest

reversal ol policy, and came to the
United States for everything from
grain to computers, he said.
How much the American cutolt ol
these materials will ultimately hurt
the Russians depends mostly on how
successful the United States is in get
ting other countries to go along, said
Dallin.
If, however, Afghanistan does
send the Soviets back into isolation,
that would represent a lundamental
reversal ot affairs, according to Dal
lin.
Vet, the only immediate possibility
fora direct, head-to-head showdown
at the present time, according to Dal
lin, seems to be in Iran.
In the event that the current Ira
nian government should be toppled
or replaced, two opposing factions in
that country could form their own
governments, one appealing to the
Soviet Union lor help, the other to
the United States, said Dallin.
Both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. would
know the risks, he said, but at the
same time neither could afford to
back down.
The prospect of changes in leadership in both the
Soviet Union and the United States should play the
key role in determining the future of U.S.-Soviet rela
tions, according to History Prof. Alexander Dallin.
Though the recent Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
has enlarged the rift between the superpowers, it is
obvious that the Russians will want to wait until after
the 1980 election toseeif theywill still bedealingwith
President |immy Carter or with someone new who
might have different outlooks on detente, according
to Dallin.
Indeed, he said, the issue of relations with Russia
will likely be raised during the coming campaign, but
"it would be unlikely if a question of foreign policy
would decide the election."

News analysis

On the Russian side, Leonid Brezhnev's days are
numbered and a leadership transter may not even be
delayed until his death, according to Political Science
Prof. Alexander George.
"A younger generation ot leadership has come to
the tore," said Dallin. "My impression is that no one
in this country, including (government officials) in
Washington, knows enough about the coming Rus
sian leadership."
But George did venture to characterize the

future leadership as being as much like the present as
possible. "They don't want a succession crisis. They
will not get a regime opposed to continuation of
detente. I don't see an alternative to detente, I see
variation or changes in emphasis," he said.
"We will return to better relations with the Rus
sians," George said. "Despite Carter's efforts to re
turn us to the Cold War, detente will survive.
More cautious
"Our version of detente is likely to be a much more
cautious, sober one, coupled with more sober expec
tations," said George. "We do not want to repeat the
overselling' of detente by (former President Richard)
Nixon and (former Secretary ot State Henry) Kis
singer."
Dallin, on the other hand, declared detente is cur
rently dead, "if you think of detente in terms of the
efforts of each side to come to terms with the other.
"The decision in Afghanistan obviously meant that
(the Soviets) were willing to subordinate relations
with the U.S. for other considerations," he said.
"That doesn't mean detente can't be revived, but it
will take a new effort," Dallin added.
Assoc. Prof. David Kennedy, director of the Inter
national Relations Program, said he didn't see Af
ghanistan as a necessary finale to the relaxing of
U.S.-Soviet tensions. "But," he said, "I'm saying this
