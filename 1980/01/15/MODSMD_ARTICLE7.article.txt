# Plan would create National Scenic Area
## Save-Tahoe bill introduced 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” A California congressman
unveiled legislation Wednesday to create a Na
tional Scenic Area at Lake Tahoe, and an en
vironmental group said it would mount a na
tional campaign to enact the bill.
Saying government soon must take strong
steps to preserve the lake's deteriorating envi
ronment, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento)
outlined a proposal giving broad powers to the
U.S. Forest Service to limit growth at the Sierra
Nevada lake.
I think we stand on a political threshold,"
he said in a statement. "We can look back in
time and see the lake as it should remain, and we
can look lorward to see what it is all too rapidly
becoming."
The bill, which Fazio said would be intro
duced later this month, requires the drafting of a
preservation plan tor the lake within two years

and requires local governments in the lake basin
to tollow it.
The Forest Service also would be given the
power to condemn and purchase property any
where in the basin, except tor single-tamily resi
dences in use at the time the bill is enacted.
The Forest Service could also impose user
tees on basin visitors. Residents, basin workers
and property owners would not have to pay
them.
The bill would scrap the bi-state compact
under which California and Nevada set up a
board to regulate Tahoe's growth. It also would
authorize funding to block construction ot two
south shore casinos and a proposed expansion
of Harvey's Wagon Wheel hotel-casino.
Cameron Wolte, |r., president of the League
to Save l ake Tahoe, said environmentalists
would launch a national campaign to enact the
bill this year.
