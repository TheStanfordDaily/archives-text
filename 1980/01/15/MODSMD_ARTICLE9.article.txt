# Group promotes 'Energyfast' plan to cut consumption
## 
### Suzi Alexander 
When the federal govern
ment, the state government,
your neighborhood, and even
your mother have failed to
come up with an equitable sol
ution to the ever-increasing
energy problem, it is reassur
ing to realize that ultimately we
may all rely on ourselves for at
least the beginnings to the
answer.
So says the Creative Initiative
Foundation (CIF), an educa
tional organization located in
Palo Alto which has started an
"Energyfast" campaign to
promote "a greater awareness
. . . of the need to conserve
energy," according to Robert
Lancefield, CIF member.
Lancefield stressed the need
to make the public realize that
energy conservation is really
not "hard or dramatic," nor is it

When the federal government, the state
government, your neighborhood and even
your mother have failed to come up with an
equitable solution to the energy problem, it
is reassuring to realize that ultimately we
may all rely on ourselves for at least the
beginnings to the answer.

something that "somebody
else has to do."
The group's major emphasis
has been to convince people to
"start themselves," and then to
instruct them in the relatively
minor changes which they
need to make to cut their per
sonal energy consumption.
Member Pat Dimock urged
that energy conservation is
"really not painful," to which
Lancefield added that we need
not yet resort to "the candles
and the cave bit!"
Energyfast plan
The group has devised a
three-pronged recommenda
tion. (1) One day a week, drive
no cars. (2)Reduce energy use
in your home by 20 percent.
(3) Educate at least two other
people to do the same.
They have also tried to "get
the word out." In July, they
went door-to-door, explaining
their organization's goals, ask
ing about energy concerns,
and inquiring about the indi
viduals' willingness to follow
the three steps.
Reactions were varied; ac
cording to Dimock, there is al
ways "a lot of resistance to
change — just naturally. But
when your neighbors ask you,
we're hoping it really brings it
home."
'Everybody's business'
They said they found many
interested and concerned
people who were already
doing something. With these
people they went a step

further, organizing a
neighborhood meeting to dis
cuss "all kinds of home con
servations."
Lancefield said that CIF
wanted "to do something with
the consumers that would
show that there were things
that they could do as individu
als .. . the whole idea is that
energy is everybody's busi
ness."
Lancefield also stressed the
need for people to "have a vis
ion or an idea ol how the basic
problem can be solved by sim
ply working together. Then it
makes it easier to do some
thing." Dimock agreed, say
ing, "When people realize that
there's an effort being made by
everybody, then they're just so
willing to cooperate."
Evaluation
Their evaluation process,

which will be completed some
time this week, will indicate
the success ot the program.
Perhaps an inherent problem
in focusing on the individual
consumers is that they use only
17 percent of our energy. But,
as Lancefield defends, "it's a
start."
Dimock said an eventual
dream is to have "the results be
positive here (in Palo Alto) to
the point where other cities
want to pick it up." Lancefield
said the basic idea is to "spread
it, get people involved in it.
You have no way of knowing
where it will really end up. But,
when the energy consumption
figures go down, then you'll
know."
Dimock, speculating about
their next step, looks toward
Stanlord as "a really good
place to go," adding that stu
dents all have "a lot more time
to put in on this planet."
Priorities
Lancefield said he sees shitt
ing to "middle-sized" busines
ses as a possibility, but is wait
ing for the evaluation to de
termine how they can most ef
fectively use their time and
energies.
Finally, Dimock noted that
the greatest impact has been
on her "personal experience at
home. When you work on
something like this, you really
do take it on," she said, con
cluding that there is a need to
have more people actively in
volved with the solution.

answer.
So says the Creative Initiative
Foundation (CIF), an educa
tional organization located in
Palo Alto which has started an
"Energyfast" campaign to
promote "a greater awareness
. . . of the need to conserve
energy," according to Robert
Lancefield, CIF member.
Lancefield stressed the need
to make the public realize that
energy conservation is really
not "hard or dramatic," nor is it

When the federal government, the state
government, your neighborhood and even
your mother have failed to come up with an
equitable solution to the energy problem, it
is reassuring to realize that ultimately we
may all rely on ourselves for at least the
beginnings to the answer.

something that "somebody
else has to do."
The group's major emphasis
has been to convince people to
"start themselves," and then to
instruct them in the relatively
minor changes which they
need to make to cut their per
sonal energy consumption.
Member Pat Dimock urged
that energy conservation is
"really not painful," to which
Lancefield added that we need
not yet resort to "the candles
and the cave bit!"
Energyfast plan
The group has devised a
three-pronged recommenda
tion. (1) One day a week, drive
no cars. (2)Reduce energy use
in your home by 20 percent.
(3) Educate at least two other
people to do the same.
They have also tried to "get
the word out." In July, they
went door-to-door, explaining
their organization's goals, ask
ing about energy concerns,
and inquiring about the indi
viduals' willingness to follow
the three steps.
Reactions were varied; ac
cording to Dimock, there is al
ways "a lot of resistance to
change — just naturally. But
when your neighbors ask you,
we're hoping it really brings it
home."
'Everybody's business'
They said they found many
interested and concerned
people who were already
doing something. With these
people they went a step

further, organizing a
neighborhood meeting to dis
cuss "all kinds of home con
servations."
Lancefield said that CIF
wanted "to do something with
the consumers that would
show that there were things
that they could do as individu
als .. . the whole idea is that
energy is everybody's busi
ness."
Lancefield also stressed the
need for people to "have a vis
ion or an idea ol how the basic
problem can be solved by sim
ply working together. Then it
makes it easier to do some
thing." Dimock agreed, say
ing, "When people realize that
there's an effort being made by
everybody, then they're just so
willing to cooperate."
Evaluation
Their evaluation process,

which will be completed some
time this week, will indicate
the success ot the program.
Perhaps an inherent problem
in focusing on the individual
consumers is that they use only
17 percent of our energy. But,
as Lancefield defends, "it's a
start."
Dimock said an eventual
dream is to have "the results be
positive here (in Palo Alto) to
the point where other cities
want to pick it up." Lancefield
said the basic idea is to "spread
it, get people involved in it.
You have no way of knowing
where it will really end up. But,
when the energy consumption
figures go down, then you'll
know."
Dimock, speculating about
their next step, looks toward
Stanlord as "a really good
place to go," adding that stu
dents all have "a lot more time
to put in on this planet."
Priorities
Lancefield said he sees shitt
ing to "middle-sized" busines
ses as a possibility, but is wait
ing for the evaluation to de
termine how they can most ef
fectively use their time and
energies.
Finally, Dimock noted that
the greatest impact has been
on her "personal experience at
home. When you work on
something like this, you really
do take it on," she said, con
cluding that there is a need to
have more people actively in
volved with the solution.

ment, the state government,
your neighborhood, and even
