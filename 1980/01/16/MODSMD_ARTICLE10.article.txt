Taxco, Mexico — Feliz Cuevas, standing
among the hundreds of sterling silver
drinking glasses and trays that line the
walls of her shop on one corner of Taxco's
picturesque central plaza, ought to be
more than happy.
During the past two months, her inven
tory of silver objects, part of the attraction
that has drawn millions of tourists to this
mountain town, has more than doubled in
value. Since |une, when local artisans paid
about $282 tor a kiio of raw silver, the value
of her inventory has jumped nearly 500
percent; the same kilo now costs almost
$1400.
But Cuevas, a short, plump, motherly
woman whose appearance belies her
ownership of a shop whose storeroom
contains more precious metal than, it is

claimed, Tiffany's in New York, does not
sound like a happy woman.
In the middle of the most spectacular
rise in metal prices ever, with silver price
hikes outdistancing the better-publicized
cost jumps of gold by hundreds ot percen
tage points, Cuevas' lament seems out of
place.
But it is repeated daily in this city by
Chamber of Commerce officials, bankers,
craftsmen, taxi drivers and even waitres
ses in the seemingly empty restaurants.
Taxco, long considered Mexico's — if not
the world's, premier silver market place —
is in crisii.. After 50 years of prosperity cat
ering to tourists' lusts for silver, the
skyrocketing price has pushed silver
beyond the grasp of its traditional custom
ers.
And the result of that crisis may be not
only the end of profitable silver shops like

«Cuevas', but also the end of a way of life
that has been the hallmark of this
storybook city that last month celebrated
its 450 th anniversary.
Already more than HO percent of the es
timated 8000 family-operated silver
working shops are closed, officials esti
mate, and sales in the <00 or more stores
that sell finished silver products have
dropped more than 50 percent.
Bank officials say deposits have dropped
by 25 percent in the last few months and
silver sales to local craftsmen, which had
been averaging about 100 kilos per month
per bank, have declined to only four or
five kilos since "before December."
"The situation is extremely urgent," said
Alejandro Garcia Maldanado, director of
Taxco's Chamber of Commerce. "If some
thing isn't done, this place will be a ghost
town in less than a year."
