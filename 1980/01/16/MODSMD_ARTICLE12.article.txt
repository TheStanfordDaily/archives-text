# Chinese military seeks modernization

The Washington Post
Shanghai â€” American milit
ary planners, in their first
meaningful if brief look at Chi
na's army, navy and air force,
have come away with an im
pression of an immense, rusty
and old-fashioned military
machine trying to polish and
modernize itself into a new
strategic potency.
"They'll tell you they're
backward, that their equip
ment is antiquated," said one
American expert surveying a
Chinese missile destroyer.
"Yet they take pride in this
ship; it's well maintained, and
this hydraulic steering system
is advanced."
Now the Chinese have the

advantage of enormous man
power and the sort of eager
ness among youth for the
rigors of military life that is only
found in poor peasant
societies like this one. "We still
have far more volunteers than
we can enlist," said one
Chinese officer.
In its brief skirmish with Vie
tnamese troops a year ago,
those overwhelming numbers,
peasant courage and the
well-maintained if backward
equipment in Chinese
storehouses performed well
and brought a limited victory
after initial confusion and mis
haps. But foreign military
strategists suspect that the
basic Chinese strategy against
its most likely major war adver
sary, the Soviet Union, relies
on assumptions as outmoded
as the T-59 tanks the Chinese
showed U.S. Defense Secret
ary Harold Brown during his
visit here.
'People's war'
The principal avowed
Chinese military strategy re
mains the late Chairman Mao
Tse-tung's idea of "people's
war," allowing a well
equipped invading army to
plunge deep into Chinese ter
ritory, then sniping at his
forces with militia and small
forces unit engagements until
he wearies of the struggle and
withdraws. The Chinese extol
this approach as a reaffirma
tion of the close ties between
the army, the Communist Party
and the vast peasant masses.
Actually it is making a virtue
out of a necessity. Peking is
short of modern tanks, anti

lank weapons and aircraft that
would make a full scale re
sponse to a Soviet invasion
possible.
Military analysts on the
Brown trip question if the
Soviets really would rise to the
bait and launch a deep invasion
intent on winning much
Chinese territory, as the
Japanese did in the 1930s when
Mao evolved his military
theory. If Moscow ever had any
intention of attacking China at
all, it is doubtful they would
want to fight on Chinese terms.
It would be better from the
Soviet view, the American
analysts say, for Moscow to use
its overwhelming air superior
ity for bombing raids on the
principal Chinese industrial
cities in the three northeastern
provinces once known as
Manchuria. Punitive raids on
these Chinese border military
camps might also be launched,
then pulled back, or parts of
the highly vulnerable border
areas might be held for bar
gaining purposes in Xinjiang,
in the northwest, or
Heilongjiang, in the northeast.
A small Soviet raiding party
managed to cross the Amur
River in Heilongjiang in mid
-1978 for a few hours without
apparently even being chal
lenged by Chinese military un
its.
The one thoroughly modern
arrow in China's quiver is its
clear nuclear strike force, al
though here it still relies on
liquid-fueled rockets that can
not be fired quickly and on
about 80 TU-16 bombers with a

radius of 2000 miles. Peking is
estimated to have about 30 to
40 medium-range ballistic mis
siles with a range of 600 to 700
miles and 50 to 70
intermediate-range missiles
with a range of about 1500 to
1700 miles, reaching most
Soviet cities east of the Urals.
Brown said during his visit
he was "certain" the Chinese
are developing a 3000-to
5000-mile-range intercontinen
tal missile which could reach
Moscow.
Astronauts
A Shanghai official news
paper published this week an
article with photographs of fu
ture Chinese astronauts un
dergoing training at an undis
closed location. Aside from the
light it threw on Chinese ambi
tions to someday put men in
space, the article also served to
display Chinese confidence
that the rockets they are de
veloping will be powerful
enough to boost very large
loads into orbit or at enemy
cities.
The Chinese have about 300
nuclear warheads, both A
bombs and H-bombs, and al
though the delivery systems
are far behind the rapid-fire
solid-fuel missiles in the U.S.
and Soviet arsenals, they still
are enough.to provide credile.
nuclear threat.
U.S. military experts warned
often during the trip here
against underestimating the.
fighting ability of the Chinese!
forces, even if they did not
possess the most up-to-date,
equipment.
