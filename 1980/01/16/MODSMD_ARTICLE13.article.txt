# Fireman heads here for new heart â€“ again
## 
### 
From Associated Press and staff reports
Former firefighter Fred Kel
ley says he feels like the Tin
Man from the "Wizard of Oz"
as he heads out to California to
await a heart transplant.
Kelley, 39, whose diseased
heart is apparently worsening
at a steady rate, left home Sun
day with his son, Fred Jr., for a
cross-country drive to Palo Alto

and the Medical Center here.
It will be Kelley's second visit.
On Nov. 1, after a much pub
licized trip, doctors at the Med
Center rejected Kelley's bid to
have a heart transplant, claim
ing his heart wasn't diseased
enough and was still function
ing at 25 percent of its capacity.
Bill Snyder, associate direc
tor of the Med Center's news

bureau, said Monday night that
Kelley was turned down in
November "not permanently,
but at the time his heart was at a
point of health where the risk
of a transplant was not worth
it." Snyder said that Kelley's
doctors in Massachusetts were
told to monitor his heart
closely, and that if its condition
deteriorated, he would be re
considered for a transplant.

"They won't perform a
transplant until my condition
reaches about 15 percent
capacity and since the doctors
at Massachusetts General
Hospital expect it to decrease,
they thought I should be in
California," Kelley said.
Traveling only five hours a
day, Kelley and his son hope to
make the trip in 12 days, taking
the southern route to avoid
bitd weather. His wife and
three of his four other children
plan to join him in California at
the end of the month. His old
est child, Kathy, 20, a nurse,
will stay in Kelley's hometown
of Framingham, Mass.
Kelley's case became well
known last fall when a Framin
gham town meeting voted to
appropriate $60,000 for the
transplant after Kelley's medi
cal insurance carrier called the
proposed transplant "experi
mental" and refused to pay for
it.
"This isn't the yellow brick
road," Kelley said in reference
to the "Wizard of Oz," "but I'll
be back. If it wasn't for the
people of Massachusetts I
wouldn't be going anywhere."
He said he had a CB radio
installed in his 1978 Dodge in
case he becomes ill on the trip
and has to summon help.
"My handle is the Tin Man,"
he said, "and I'm looking for a
heart."
