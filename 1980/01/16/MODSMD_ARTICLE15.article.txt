# For stubbornness on Birmingham bus, Rosa Parks is called 'saint'
## 'Mother of civil rights movement' awarded peace prize 
### 
Detroit (AP) â€” Rosa Parks has been proclaimed
"mother of the civil rights movement," even a
"saint," for refusing to yield her bus seat to a white
man in 1955.
Her stubbornness touched off a force lhat swept
the nation, but the small, soft-spoken 66-year-old
black woman seems unaffected by the praise.
"Saint?" she said with a laugh. "I don't consider
myself a saint at all. I'm just a human being like every
body else."
Mrs. Parks was awarded the Martin Luther King, )r.
Nonviolent Peace Prize Monday in Atlanta during
birthday celebrations for the slain civil rights leader.
She is the first woman to receive the prize. Eight
men have received the award, including former U.N.
Ambassador Andrew Young and migrant labor or
ganizer Cesar Chavez.
She said she is "happy and proud" to receive the
King award and "will do my very best to be deserving
of it." But she also seemed uncomfortable with re
newed public attention brought by the award.
She works here as a receptionist for Rep. )ohn
Conyers Jr., (D-Mich.). With requests for interviews
interrupting her day,"I don't seem to be able to get

very much done," she said.
With her gray hair pulled back into a bun and her
hands folded in her lap, Mrs. Parks patiently
answered questions about her past. But some of the
humiliation suffered by blacks was difficult for her to
talk about.
"It is so extraordinarily painful to look back on
some of the things we lived through," she said.

7 just wanted to be free like
everybody else. I didn't want to be
continually humiliated over
something I had no control over, the
color of my skin/

Mrs. Parks made history Dec. 1, 1955, on a bus in
Montgomery, Ala.
After a day working as a seamstress at the

Montgomery Fair department store, she was ordered
out of her seat in the bus' rear section reserved for
blacks so that a white man could sit.
Three blacks gave up their seats. She refused.
"I just wanted to be free like everybody else," she
said inexplaining her action that day."I didn't want to
be continually humiliated over something I had no
control over, the color of my skin."
She was arrested for defying segregation laws, an
act which sparked the 1955-56 bus boycott that
earned King national prominence.
The Supreme Court found the laws unconstitu
tional in 1956 and the boycott ended. Mrs. Parks
never paid the $10 fine and court costs.
Although she is best known for the stand she took
that day, Mrs. Parks was no newcomer to the civil
rights struggle.
She joined the Montgomery chapter of the Na
tional Association for the Advancement of Colored
People in the early 1940s and was immediately elected
secretary.
Mrs. Parks doesn't see her personal courage as
unique. "I think everybody has some inner strength
and it's just a matter of concentrating on whatever
your goal is."
