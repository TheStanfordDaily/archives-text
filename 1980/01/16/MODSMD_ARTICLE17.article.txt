# YWCA proposes support for student credit program
## 
### Allison Stone 
Have you ever been involved in helping
someone to win the struggle against alcohol
or to remove the stigma of social isolation
from one of society's elderly citizens? A new
volunteer program for students interested in
providing such service to the community is
now being offered by the Stanford Young
Women's Christian Association (YWCA).
Christened the Community Service Volun
teer Support Network (CsVsN), the program
aims to solicit student aid in community ser
vices and to promote professional training
for those students in a wide range of areas.
"The potential resource of students is great
here at Stanford for volunteer work," said
Mary Perner, program director for the YWCA
on campus. "The Stanford population is un
derused. There are needs that we're trying to
meet," she adds.
Perner said she believes that the problem
in the past has been finding a means to hold
students in volunteer positions. "Because
Stanford students are so careful with their
time, units of credit or money or the promise
of it are the only things that will retain stu
dents."
Negotiations for units of credit are cur
rently being pursued with both the Action
Research Liaison Organization (ARLO) and
the Stanford Workshops on Political and So
cial Issues (SWOPSI). Perner hopes to have
these units to offer to students by spring
quarter.
The YWCA is in the process of finding a

diverse range of service organizations to
offer to students in the surrounding area.
"We refuse to include any agency who offers
just licking envelopes for jobs," says Perner.
"We want to enhance human interaction and
professionalism."
The response from the community has
been great, according to the YWCA. Students
will be placed into agencies like the Phoenix
Center for alcohol rehabilitation; the Palo
Alto Senior Day Care Center for socially iso
lated adults; the Resource Center for crisis
counseling and the Ecumenical Hunger Prog
ram in East Palo Alto.
Perner, working in conjunction with Sally
Brennan, director of the Volunteer Bureau of
the Palo Alto Voluntary Action Center, says,
"We want to be more than a cleoringhouse
for agencies who need help as is found on
many college campuses. We require that the
agencies provide training for students. We
hope to place students according to their in
terests."
The YWCA, which has been established on
the Stanford campus for 80 years, wants to
become more actively involved in student
affairs. "We are trying to mainstream ourse
lves with the students," Perner notes.
Orientation for students interested in the
program will be tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. at the
YWCA Women's Center.
"To attract volunteers is like pulling teeth
at Stanford," explains Perner. "There is a
possibility that the program won't work, but
we think it is worth the effort to try."
