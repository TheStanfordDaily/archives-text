# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Matt Leipzig Humanities must be made current 
### 
The University has reinstated
■ihe Western Culture program
requirement, and I suspect two
principle motives determined
this action.
The first and most concrete
is that the University wants to
be certain that all graduating
students know at least the
names and (it is hoped) a few
seminal works of major West
ern thinkers. Given thecompe
tpnce of Stanford's facultv, I'm
sure this goal can be ac
complished.
, The second motive is more
subtle and general: to arrest
the gradual decline in the
humanities and make a liberal
education once again the cent
ral focus of the college experi
ence. It is doubtful in my mind
whether any single require
ment can achieve this.
! Indeed, I do not think any
number of requirements could
return the humanities to the
stature they once had and cer
tainly deserve. In recent years a
omplex of factors has as
saulted the humanities: poor
secondary school preparation
leaving college students un
prepared tor in-depth liberal
studies, decline in foreign lan
guage enrollments (but a re
cent reverse in this area is a
good sign), and an unstable job
market forcing students to
seek education in employable
fields.

But most of all, I think, the
humanities have hurt them
selves by their response to
these issues. That students
have become disenchanted
with liberal arts is a sign not just
that more requirements are
needed, but that those arts
must be taught (and defined) in
a different way.
When asked to justify the
humanities, most professors I
have encountered have im
mediately waxed historical and
stated that we must learn about
the events, cultures and arts of
the past in order to understand
more than just our narrow, li
mited present.
It may be a good answer, but
it isn't substantial enough. I
wouldn't expect it to compete
very well with the description
an engineer might give of his
field: a practical and diverse
area of study to enable the stu
dent to deal with real and pres
sing problems of the day.
The difficulty with most vin
dications of the humanities is
that they are rooted in the past,
in historicity, and therefore do
not appear too urgent or pres
sing to the student in a world
dominated by energy crises
and the threat of world war
tare. I personally, at least, am
deeply dissatisfied with any
vindication that tells me what
the humanities were but not
what they are.

Any worthwhile field of
study has to be alive and cur
rent — current in the sense of
havinga significant place in the
contemporary world. It is a
dangerous cop-out to say we
have a duty to learn about cul
tures past but not explain why.
Such a glib statement is the
starting point of the
humanities, not the catch-all
conclusion.
More than the humanities
being underlearned and un
dertaught they are mistaught
and misunderstood. When de
fenders of the humanities
place full blame for this on the
faltering economy they are
shadow-boxing. And they are
weakening the humanities'
position.
Economic conditions, by all
reports we have, will probably
be relatively dim for several
years. If the humanities are
going to survive, they must be
flexible.
Survival, in my mind, means
much more than being taught
in major universities. Far from
being rooted in the past, the
humanities must be tied to the
present and become as
dynamic as the present tense.
Defenders of the
humanities, for their part,
should set about redefining
their topic, rather than crying
tor more requirements and de
crying a world of economic

conditions beyond their con
trol.
A good starting point would
be a new type of class, not in
the humanities, but on the
humanities. What do they
mean? What does humanity
mean? Or, what does being
human mean? In a period of
such global uncertainty, in
sights into these questions
would be quite relevant and re
freshing.
The question of course re
quirements is probably an in
soluble one, as different gen
erations of students should be
required to undertake diffe
rent studies. The Western cul
ture program is probably a
good one, but it is no panacea;
it cannot reverse the decade's
trends, nor can it undo the ef
fects of misteaching.
In the final analysis, nothing
that is required can give us a
greater appreciation of the
humanities. A liberal educa
tion cannot be forced down
someone's throat. Only if the
humanities are made new, sig
nificant, relevant and current
will they flourish again.
