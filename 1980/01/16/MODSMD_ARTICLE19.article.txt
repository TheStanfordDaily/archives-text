## Iran violating Convention 
### 
In the interest ot accuracy, I should like to
respond to Hamad Al-Baadi's column [Daily,
)an. 9). He is absolutely wrong on the basic issue
concerning the take-over ot the U.S. Embassy in
Iran. Under international law, diplomatic im
munity is not qualified in any way, except that
the host country can at any time declare a dip
lomat "persona non grata" and therefore ask
him to leave.
There is no such thing as nullifying diplomatic
immunity. There is no right to seize an embassy
or its diplomatic representatives, or to rummage
through embassy files and documents. These
things are specifically forbidden by the Vienna
Convention, which in effect codified what had
already been international law.
The convention's Article 22 provides that
"the premises ot the mission shall be inviola
ble," and that "the receiving state is under a
special duty to take all appropriate steps to pro
tect the premises of the mission against any in
trusion or damage and to prevent any distur
bance of the peace of the mission or impairment
of its dignity.
The convention's Article 29 stipulates that
"the person of a diplomatic agent should be
inviolable," and that "he shall not be liable to
any form of arrest or detention."
The convention's Article 31 says that "a dip
lomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from crimi
nal prosecution of the receiving state. He shall
also enjoy immunity from its civil and adminis

trative jurisdiction."
The Iranians have violated every one of these
articles, and more.
Hamad Al-Baadi's statement that other states
have seized and interrogated foreign embassy
personnel clouds the issue. It may be true that
diplomats may have been asked to explain their
behavior prior to a decision to expel them, but
they were not held as prisoners (over 70 days
now!) and their embassies were not taken over
and ransacked.
He also clouds the issue when he refers to
precedents in the exchange of spies and other
individuals, because such exchanges did not fol
low from seizures of embassies and trials of dip
lomats in such embassies. The very idea of such
a trial is repugnant to international law.
What has happened in Iran is an act of war
against the United States, because the govern
ment there condones it. By our patience we
have given the Iranians an opportunity to desist
from that act. But increasingly the President is
going to feel the pressure of an impatient pub
lic.
It seems incredible to me that the rulers (are
there such?) in Iran do not seem to be aware of
what confronts them. They may believe that
U.S. military action against them would be irra
tional, but they would be well advised not to
seek comfort in such a belief.
