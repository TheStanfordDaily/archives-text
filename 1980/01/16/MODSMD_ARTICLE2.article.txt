# U.S. journalists ordered out by Friday
## Iran presidential candidate pulls out 
### 
From Daily wire services
The nominee of Iran's clergy and
largest political group dropped out
of the presidential election race yes
terday, improving the prospects of
the only candidate who has urged a
speedy end to the crisis over Ameri
can hostages here.
Religious support previously given
to lalalledin Farsi, who withdrew,
now is expected to swing to radical
economist Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr,
who long has proposed a quick deci
sion to release or punish the hos
tages. Election day is Jan. 25.
Nationality
In announcing his withdrawal yes
terday as a candidate, Farsi, a college
professor who advocates strong Is
lamic influence on the government,
said that he would drop out because
o! questions over his nationality.
Farsi, 47, who was the nominee of
most clerical groups and the power
ful Islamic Republican Party, re
vealed that his father held Afghan
citizenship. This apparently disqual
ifies him under the constitutional re
quirement that presidents be "Ira
nians by origin."
Although Farsi failed immediately
to throw his support to another can
didate, much of his influential religi
ous backing is expected to go to
Minister of Economic Affairs and Fi
nance Bani-Sadr.
The other strong contender in the
field of 101 presidential candidates is
Ahmad Madani, 51, the recently res
igned Navy commander and gover
nor general of oil-rich Khuzestan
Province, who has little support
among religious groups.
Backing of Iran's various theologi
cal societies and Moslem leaders is
considered very important in a na
tion swept by Islamic fervor and vir
tually idolatry of the revolutionary
leader and tather figure, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
Meanwhile, Iran yesterday or
dered American reporters to leave
the country by midnight Friday in a
move one Iranian official said could
help ease the embassy crisis by
"lowering the temperature" and tak
ing pressure off the militants who
hold the American hostages. Non-
American foreign journalists will be
allowed to remain.
The United States moved to build
up pressure on the Iranians by

rounding up support from the NATO
allies for economic sanctions against
Iran.
The Carter administration also
pressed its court actions against the
Iranians. Lawyers for the U.S. gov
ernment formally presented a
lengthy legal brief on its case against
Iran before the International Court
of justice in the Hague, Netherlands.
The court is the main legal arm of the
United Nations.
Abolghassem Sadegh, director of
foreign press at the Ministry of Na
tional Guidance, said the expulsion
of reporters tor U.S. news organiza
tionswould mean that "the students
(embassy militants) might be more
relaxed and the hostages might be
more relaxed in turn.
"I think it will be good for Iran, the
United States and the hostages," he
said, adding that the move could
"lower the tempeiature...(and)
might help the situation as a whole."
The 50 or so American hostages
have been held prisoner at the em
bassy since Moslem militants seized
the complex Nov. 4, demanding the
return ot the exiled Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi.
Iran's ruling revolutionary Council
and Cabinet ministers decided Mon
day to eject the 100 or so American
reporters here from the country, but
did not set a deadline. Yesterday the
National Guidance Ministry told the
Associated Press that the deadline
for leaving the country is midnight
Friday.
'Biased?'
The Iranian government of Kho
meini accused the American jour
nalists, part of a 300-member interna
tional press corps, of "biased report
ing" on the Iranian situation.
It said French, British and West
German journalists and those from
other countries could stay for the
time being. The non-American jour
nalist, Sadegh said, can look at Iran
"in a more fair way" since the hos
tages are not their fellow country
men.
The U.S. government campaign
,for sanctions against Iran was taken
yesterday to Brussels, Belgium,
where Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher met with mem
bers of the North Atlantic Council.
The Soviet news agency Tass
criticized Christopher's talks, saying

they "may lead to further heighten
ing of international tensions and to
an enhancement ot military prepara
tions."
The Western group's meeting on
Iran followed the Soviet veto of a
U.N. Security Council resolution on
sanctions Sunday. The Carter ad
ministration pledged to continue
working for an embargo on all goods
to Iran, excluding food and
medicine, until the hostages are re
leased.

an enhancement ot military prepara
tions."
The Western group's meeting on
Iran followed the Soviet veto of a
U.N. Security Council resolution on
sanctions Sunday. The Carter ad
ministration pledged to continue
working for an embargo on all goods
to Iran, excluding food and
medicine, until the hostages are re
leased.
From Daily wire services
The nominee of Iran's clergy and
largest political group dropped out
of the presidential election race yes
terday, improving the prospects of
the only candidate who has urged a
speedy end to the crisis over Ameri
can hostages here.
Religious support previously given
to lalalledin Farsi, who withdrew,
now is expected to swing to radical
economist Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr,
who long has proposed a quick deci
sion to release or punish the hos
tages. Election day is Jan. 25.
Nationality
In announcing his withdrawal yes
terday as a candidate, Farsi, a college
professor who advocates strong Is
lamic influence on the government,
said that he would drop out because
o! questions over his nationality.
Farsi, 47, who was the nominee of
most clerical groups and the power
ful Islamic Republican Party, re
vealed that his father held Afghan
citizenship. This apparently disqual
ifies him under the constitutional re
quirement that presidents be "Ira
nians by origin."
Although Farsi failed immediately
to throw his support to another can
didate, much of his influential religi
ous backing is expected to go to
Minister of Economic Affairs and Fi
nance Bani-Sadr.
The other strong contender in the
field of 101 presidential candidates is
Ahmad Madani, 51, the recently res
igned Navy commander and gover
nor general of oil-rich Khuzestan
Province, who has little support
among religious groups.
Backing of Iran's various theologi
cal societies and Moslem leaders is
considered very important in a na
tion swept by Islamic fervor and vir
tually idolatry of the revolutionary
leader and tather figure, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
Meanwhile, Iran yesterday or
dered American reporters to leave
the country by midnight Friday in a
move one Iranian official said could
help ease the embassy crisis by
"lowering the temperature" and tak
ing pressure off the militants who
hold the American hostages. Non-
American foreign journalists will be
allowed to remain.
The United States moved to build
up pressure on the Iranians by

rounding up support from the NATO
allies for economic sanctions against
Iran.
The Carter administration also
pressed its court actions against the
Iranians. Lawyers for the U.S. gov
ernment formally presented a
lengthy legal brief on its case against
Iran before the International Court
of justice in the Hague, Netherlands.
The court is the main legal arm of the
United Nations.
Abolghassem Sadegh, director of
foreign press at the Ministry of Na
tional Guidance, said the expulsion
of reporters tor U.S. news organiza
tionswould mean that "the students
(embassy militants) might be more
relaxed and the hostages might be
more relaxed in turn.
"I think it will be good for Iran, the
United States and the hostages," he
said, adding that the move could
"lower the tempeiature...(and)
might help the situation as a whole."
The 50 or so American hostages
have been held prisoner at the em
bassy since Moslem militants seized
the complex Nov. 4, demanding the
return ot the exiled Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi.
Iran's ruling revolutionary Council
and Cabinet ministers decided Mon
day to eject the 100 or so American
reporters here from the country, but
did not set a deadline. Yesterday the
National Guidance Ministry told the
Associated Press that the deadline
for leaving the country is midnight
Friday.
'Biased?'
The Iranian government of Kho
meini accused the American jour
nalists, part of a 300-member interna
tional press corps, of "biased report
ing" on the Iranian situation.
It said French, British and West
German journalists and those from
other countries could stay for the
time being. The non-American jour
nalist, Sadegh said, can look at Iran
"in a more fair way" since the hos
tages are not their fellow country
men.
The U.S. government campaign
,for sanctions against Iran was taken
yesterday to Brussels, Belgium,
where Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher met with mem
bers of the North Atlantic Council.
The Soviet news agency Tass
criticized Christopher's talks, saying

they "may lead to further heighten
ing of international tensions and to
an enhancement ot military prepara
tions."
