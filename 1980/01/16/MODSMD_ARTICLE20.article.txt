QUIM? QUIF?
I would like to share a solu
tion to a problem which I as
sume troubles many more
people than myself, and that is,
how do we convey the mean
ingot what is now termed a boy
or girlfriend of the opposite
sex without sounding like we
are in grade school.
Certainly by now we are ma
ture adults, experiencing ma

ture relationships with other
mature individuals. But some
how saying, "I went out last
night with my 'boyfriend' "
does not express the true rela
tionship, in my mind.
I could call him my "lover,"
but I feel this is a bit too inti
mately descriptive to be used
in all circumstances.
Cither possibilities I have
contemplated are a "man
triend," "special friend," "sig

nificant other," or what the
French have termed "conviv
ant," which is very romantic,
but unless you are living with
the other person this word
doesn't fit, and as for the other
terms, they seem rathercliche.
Well, when I was home at
Christmas I heard a new
suggestion on one of the more
imaginative radio stations by
terming that "significant
other" a "QUIM." I thought it
was interesting enough, and if
it were properly defined I
thought it could constitute a
major contribution to the En
glish language.
Then, on New Year's Eve
after I had been sufficiently
stimulated (with drink) to be
creative, I came up with a de
finition of what I decided was
an abbreviation; "QUIM"
must mean "quite unusually
intimate mate."
Or if one chooses to give the
term gender, one could define
a "QUIM" as a "quite unusu
ally intimate male," and a
"QUIF" as a "quite unusually
intimate female."
How about it everyone? Let's
establish these as common
concepts and finally graduate
from grammar school!
