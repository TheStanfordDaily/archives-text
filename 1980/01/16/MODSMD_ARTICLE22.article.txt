## Humanities give us value 
### 
Stan Young's column, "Pity the fuzzy study
major" (Daily, Jan. 11), laments the ridicule and
neglect that the humanities have received in our
time. Young further expresses numerous
doubts about his own majoring in a humanistic
discipline, but closes with a "pledge, against all
odds, to carry on with (his) plans."
No reason whatsoever is given for this pledge,
and no defense is made of the humanities. We
are simply counseled to "pity the fuzzy study
major," and the writer cynically confesses in his
closing sentence that he is leaving himself the
possibility of going into engineering. It looks as
though Young's answer to the criticisms that are
levelled against the humanities is mainly to ig
nore them.
The weaknesses of such a position are by no
means unique to Young's editorial; they are all
too common among students of the humanities.
Such students are aware of the charges of irrele
vance that are brought against their disciplines,
but rather than searching foran answer to these
charges, they give a cynical shrug and turn away.
I, for one, cannot believe that the only de
tense against these objections is a mock-heroic
stubbornness. The study of philosophy, relig
ion, history, literature, art and music must be
justified by reasons more convincing than the
fact that some of us fill our bookshelves with
such works. But we cannot grasp these reasons
it we allow our rational ijudgment to grind to a
halt before the criterion of "marketability."
I hat the work of the humanist meets with so
low a marketability, and that we should consider
that low marketability an objection, reflects our
failure to appreciate the value of such work. This
value cannot be materially or monetarily quan
tified; rather, it is the basis for our finding value
in the material arid the monetary at all.
Suppose that two professionally trained re
searchers in different fields are competing for
funding; one, an engineer, seeks to realize a
technological advance; the other, a medical sci
entist, seeks to realize an advance in health care.

Each one, by virtue of his professional train
ing, gives us information as to the likelihood of
his project succeeding, as to its utility, and so
forth; but neither can use his training to decide
whose advance is the more valuable. Neither
medical science nor engineering provides us
with a basis for making comparative evaluations
between advances in those respective fields.
Thus the very existence of professional
studies such as engineering and medicine,
whatever material advances they produce, pre
supposes the human value of those advances
and necessitates a means for judging their value.
Professional training in itself gives us no tools
for making judgments of human value.
Human value is not the object of study for
engineering or medicine, for law or business; it
is the concern of the humanities. The study of
the humanities seeks to educate us as valuing
beings, judging beings, thinking beings, feeling
beings, not the pursuers of the thoughtlessly
chosen material goals. The professional whose
training excludes humanistic study is not fully a
human being.
Those who doubt the value of humanistic
study on the grounds of its "unmarketability"
forget that it is the humanities which are respon
sible for there being such a thing as value at all.
The great thinkers, writers and artists who pro
duced the classics ot humanistic study, together
with the scholars and teachers who have la
bored in every age to revive and explore the
significance of those classics, have made possi
ble the fabric of value by means of which we
exist as human beings.
Philosophy, religion, history, art and music
are not "luxuries" which exist in addition to the
professional studies. Indeed, they are the very
conditions of the existence of humanity. We do
not call them "the humanities" without reason.

and necessitates a means for judging their value.
Professional training in itself gives us no tools
for making judgments of human value.
Human value is not the object of study for
engineering or medicine, for law or business; it
is the concern of the humanities. The study of
the humanities seeks to educate us as valuing
beings, judging beings, thinking beings, feeling
beings, not the pursuers of the thoughtlessly
chosen material goals. The professional whose
training excludes humanistic study is not fully a
human being.
Those who doubt the value of humanistic
study on the grounds of its "unmarketability"
forget that it is the humanities which are respon
sible for there being such a thing as value at all.
The great thinkers, writers and artists who pro
duced the classics ot humanistic study, together
with the scholars and teachers who have la
bored in every age to revive and explore the
significance of those classics, have made possi
ble the fabric of value by means of which we
exist as human beings.
Philosophy, religion, history, art and music
are not "luxuries" which exist in addition to the
professional studies. Indeed, they are the very
conditions of the existence of humanity. We do
not call them "the humanities" without reason.
