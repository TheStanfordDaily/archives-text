## Ethics, practicalities point to choice 
### 
If is unfortunate that anti
abortionists have continually
claimed that those who back
freedom of choice legislation
"conveniently avoid" consid
eration of the ethics involved
in abortion. Persons who are
pro-choice often hear too the
effete argument that women
must give birth to unwanted
children in part because they
should be "willing to live with
the consequences of their own
decisions." This is a common
argument, but it displays ig
norance of the social dynamics
involved.
In a sense it is true that per
sons of pro-choice persuasion
evade some pressing issues.
Perhaps this happens some
times because we find the
pragmatic arguments for legal
abortion so convincing.
For example, it is a plain fact
that one out of every ten teen
age women becomes pre
gnant, resulting in a million
pregnancies per year to 15-19-
year-olds, and 30,000 pregnan
cies to girls under 15. Further
more, seven out of every ten
legal abortions performed in
1974 would have occurred il
legally, according to the Popu
lation Council.
Because women have always
sought abortion and always
will when faced with an un
wanted pregnancy, this means
that non-legal abortions, espe
cially for the poor, will often be
performed by unethical back
alley practitioners, and result
in complications such as infec
tions and permanent sterility.
When Romania reversed a lib
eral abortion policy in 1968,
abortion-related deaths in
creased six-fold.
The other alternative is self
induced abortion. This is often
done by inserting a coat hanger
far enough into the body to

scratch the walls of the uterus
to induce bleeding and con
sequent abortion. Other
methods include taking a
douche bag, filling it with lysol,
bleach or turpentine and forc
ing the foreign substance into
the reproductive tract. Alterna
tively, a desperate woman
sometimes takes advantage of
the caustic properties of soap
by taking a bar, sharpening it,
and forcing it into her uterus.
Anti-abortionists should
realize that the alternative to
safe and legal abortion simply
cannot and never will be no
abortion at all, but rather, un
safe forms of abortion. Pro
choice backers aim to take a
more realistic stance and
legalize abortion to make it
safer.
Abortion is, and should be,
the last and least desirable al
ternative to pregnancy preven
tion, but the teen pregnancy
problem has not been com
pletely alleviated by improved
sex education and contracep
tive use, both of which are still
unavailable to large segments
of the population.
Unfortunately, some per
sons actually oppose these
measures to increase respon
sibility. Even then, birth con
trol is quite fallible, and one
out of every three couples
practicing it will have an un
wanted pregnancy in five
years.
Enough of practical argu
ments; what about the ethical
ramifications of abortion?
The idea that fertilized eggs
and fetuses are complete
"human beings" is religious
belief, not fact. Furthermore, it
is not even shared by most
traditions, whether one in
cludes classical Greece or the
vast majority of modern Protes
tant and (ewish sects. Anti

choice partisans would violate
the constitutional provision for
the separation of church and
state by making one dogma law
and thereby forcing compul
sory pregnancy upon a wo
man, rather than having her act
in accord with her personal be
liefs.
It is curious that some lead
ers in the anti-choice move
ment claim to have a monopoly
on morals. We who advocate
legal abortion have many ques
tions:
Is it ethical to bring an un
wanted and unloved child into
the world? Is it right to compel
a woman to give birth when
she is not emotionally pre
pared for motherhood?
What about when rape re
sults in pregnancy? Is a 12-
year-old fit to be a mother?
What if a fetus has severe gene
tic defects? What does one say
to a family that can't afford
another child and is trapped in
the poverty/welfare cycle? Will
such a family ever be able to
raise its standard of living?
Is it ethical to have poor
women undergo unsafe self
induced or illegal "hack" abor
tions?
The above questions tend to
focus on the quality of life. The
answers vary depending on the
individuals involved in such
cases, and we who pose the
questions must always be
plagued with uncertainty. But
this is not so for most persons
in the anti-choice movement.
They tend to focus on an

abstract principle known as
"the sacredness of life." It is
certain, absolute, and we are
not allowed to qualify it with
the sticky question of how
much a life is worth living.
I do not mean to imply that
the repulsion toward abortion
which some persons feel is a
simple taboo reaction. I think
the moral tenderness they feel
should be praised, but unfor
tunately in this case it has been
misplaced on unwanted
fetuses.
Moral intuitionism some
times goes astray. We who de
sire wanted, planned and
happy children should ask
about the suffering this anti
choice principle entails. Is suf
fering also sacred?
Who are we to judge
whether a life is worth living?
Who else will judge but hu
manity — with each and every
person deciding for his or her
self?
The pro-choice ethos is
agonizing, for with it we have
no ready-made answers, no
metaphysical tenets about
"sacredness" and "life." In
stead we ask tough questions
about social responsibility, and
about what makes for a happy
and fulfilled life — forchildancf
mother.
But after all, isn't the ability
to live with uncertainty and to
use our reason that which truly
makes us "responsible?"

the reproductive tract. Alterna
tively, a desperate woman
sometimes takes advantage of
the caustic properties of soap
by taking a bar, sharpening it,
and forcing it into her uterus.
Anti-abortionists should
realize that the alternative to
safe and legal abortion simply
cannot and never will be no
abortion at all, but rather, un
safe forms of abortion. Pro
choice backers aim to take a
more realistic stance and
legalize abortion to make it
safer.
Abortion is, and should be,
the last and least desirable al
ternative to pregnancy preven
tion, but the teen pregnancy
problem has not been com
pletely alleviated by improved
sex education and contracep
tive use, both of which are still
unavailable to large segments
of the population.
Unfortunately, some per
sons actually oppose these
measures to increase respon
sibility. Even then, birth con
trol is quite fallible, and one
out of every three couples
practicing it will have an un
wanted pregnancy in five
years.
Enough of practical argu
ments; what about the ethical
ramifications of abortion?
The idea that fertilized eggs
and fetuses are complete
"human beings" is religious
belief, not fact. Furthermore, it
is not even shared by most
traditions, whether one in
cludes classical Greece or the
vast majority of modern Protes
tant and (ewish sects. Anti

choice partisans would violate
the constitutional provision for
the separation of church and
state by making one dogma law
and thereby forcing compul
sory pregnancy upon a wo
man, rather than having her act
in accord with her personal be
liefs.
It is curious that some lead
ers in the anti-choice move
ment claim to have a monopoly
on morals. We who advocate
legal abortion have many ques
tions:
Is it ethical to bring an un
wanted and unloved child into
the world? Is it right to compel
a woman to give birth when
she is not emotionally pre
pared for motherhood?
What about when rape re
sults in pregnancy? Is a 12-
year-old fit to be a mother?
What if a fetus has severe gene
tic defects? What does one say
to a family that can't afford
another child and is trapped in
the poverty/welfare cycle? Will
such a family ever be able to
raise its standard of living?
Is it ethical to have poor
women undergo unsafe self
induced or illegal "hack" abor
tions?
The above questions tend to
focus on the quality of life. The
answers vary depending on the
individuals involved in such
cases, and we who pose the
questions must always be
plagued with uncertainty. But
this is not so for most persons
in the anti-choice movement.
They tend to focus on an

abstract principle known as
"the sacredness of life." It is
certain, absolute, and we are
not allowed to qualify it with
the sticky question of how
much a life is worth living.
I do not mean to imply that
the repulsion toward abortion
which some persons feel is a
simple taboo reaction. I think
the moral tenderness they feel
should be praised, but unfor
tunately in this case it has been
misplaced on unwanted
fetuses.
Moral intuitionism some
times goes astray. We who de
sire wanted, planned and
happy children should ask
about the suffering this anti
choice principle entails. Is suf
fering also sacred?
Who are we to judge
whether a life is worth living?
Who else will judge but hu
manity — with each and every
person deciding for his or her
self?
The pro-choice ethos is
agonizing, for with it we have
no ready-made answers, no
metaphysical tenets about
"sacredness" and "life." In
stead we ask tough questions
about social responsibility, and
about what makes for a happy
and fulfilled life — forchildancf
mother.
But after all, isn't the ability
to live with uncertainty and to
use our reason that which truly
makes us "responsible?"

ligious studies.)
If is unfortunate that anti
abortionists have continually
claimed that those who back
freedom of choice legislation
"conveniently avoid" consid
eration of the ethics involved
in abortion. Persons who are
pro-choice often hear too the
effete argument that women
must give birth to unwanted
children in part because they
should be "willing to live with
the consequences of their own
decisions." This is a common
argument, but it displays ig
norance of the social dynamics
involved.
In a sense it is true that per
sons of pro-choice persuasion
evade some pressing issues.
Perhaps this happens some
times because we find the
pragmatic arguments for legal
abortion so convincing.
For example, it is a plain fact
that one out of every ten teen
age women becomes pre
gnant, resulting in a million
pregnancies per year to 15-19-
year-olds, and 30,000 pregnan
cies to girls under 15. Further
more, seven out of every ten
legal abortions performed in
1974 would have occurred il
legally, according to the Popu
lation Council.
Because women have always
sought abortion and always
will when faced with an un
wanted pregnancy, this means
that non-legal abortions, espe
cially for the poor, will often be
performed by unethical back
alley practitioners, and result
in complications such as infec
tions and permanent sterility.
When Romania reversed a lib
eral abortion policy in 1968,
abortion-related deaths in
creased six-fold.
The other alternative is self
induced abortion. This is often
done by inserting a coat hanger
far enough into the body to

scratch the walls of the uterus
to induce bleeding and con
sequent abortion. Other
methods include taking a
douche bag, filling it with lysol,
bleach or turpentine and forc
ing the foreign substance into
the reproductive tract. Alterna
tively, a desperate woman
sometimes takes advantage of
the caustic properties of soap
by taking a bar, sharpening it,
and forcing it into her uterus.
