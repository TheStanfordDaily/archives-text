# Author criticizes U.S. policy toward famine in Cambodia
## 
### Kathleen McClung 
The American government's current pol
icy toward the widespread famine in Cam
bodia is "stupid and vindictive," Don Luce,
author of several books on Asia, told an au
dience last Thursday in Annenberg Au
ditorium.
Luce, who recently completed a three
week tour of the troubled Southeast Asian
nation, said that because the United States
refuses to send aid to Phnom Penh and other
Vietnamese-controlled areas of Cambodia,
"most of the food ends up with military
forces,"
"Pol Pot soldiers are in very good shape,
while the civilians are in horrible shape," he
said.

U.S. aid goes primarily to the refugee
camps on the Thai border, but "the U.S.
should provide aid to both sides," Luce said.
"I favor just dropping food all over Cam
bodia. Rice is an awful lot cheaper than the
B-52 bombs we dropped during the war."
Luce, international representative for
Clergy and Laity Concerned, traveled over
1500 miles in Cambodia between Nov. 22
and Dec. 12, accompanied by an ABC televi
sion news team.
News shortage
"There is so little news coming out of
Cambodia. Almost all reports have come
from the Thai border rather than inside the
country," he said.
Luce told the audience of more than 100

that "the stories about the (ousted Premier)
Pol Pot regime are true. At one point I
counted 117 skulls in front of me. They'd
been smashed with a hoe. These were not
starvation deaths.
â€¢ "If the government knew you were Viet
namese or educated or against Pol Pot, you
would be killed. I don't know how many
people were executed (during Pol Pot's re
gime). Reports vary from one to four mill
ion."
While showing slides, Luce also spoke of
the current living conditions in Cambodia.
Starvation continues
"Although I didn't see people dying in the
roads, there is still a great deal of malnutri
tion and hunger," he said. "There are many

children with extended stomachs and un
naturally brown hair from vitamin defi
ciency."
Hospitals have almost no medicine, and
thousands of people suffer from ringworm,
he added.
"Much of the food being sent is the wrong
kind. The Soviets are sending red corn, cat
tle teed, which is not very nutritious. A diet
of rice and salt, or corn and salt, is served in
the hospitals," he said.
"There are almost no fresh vegetables be
cause the present harvest is very poor. The
biggest starvation problem will start in the
beginning of March, because there will be
no local rice after that."
Answering a question from the audience,

Luce said, "Cambodians are so tired of war.
I've never seen so many psychologically
disoriented people. There's a wild stare in
their eyes as if they're trying to escape. The
whole trauma of the last 10 years has just
been too much."
Luce urged the support of charitable or
ganizations such as UNICEF and OXFAM.
"Private aid is far more effective than gov
ernment aid," he said.
He also said that shortcomings of the pre
sent U.S. foreign policy are because humane
citizens are not becoming involved.
Luce's presentation was sponsored by
several campus groups including the Coali
tion for Cambodian Relief, Stanford United
Ministry and the Southeast Asian Record.
