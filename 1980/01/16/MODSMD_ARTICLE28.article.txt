The Los Angeles Times
Washington — Increased cigarette smoking
among women has touched off a rise in the
incidence of lung cancer and now poses a major
threat to their health and ability to bear healthy
children, U.S. Surgeon General Julius
Richmond said Monday.
In his 12th annual report to Congress on the
effects of smoking, Dr. Richmond said that by
1983, the female death rate from lung cancer
could be higher than that from breast cancer.
"Cigarette smoking now contributes to one
fifth of the newly diagnosed cases of cancer and
one-quarter of all cancer deaths among women
— more cancer and more cancer deaths among
women than can be attributed to any other
known agent," he said.
Mostly because of social stigmas, widespread
cigarette smoking among women lagged 25 to 30
years behind men's habits, he said, but that has
changed and so has the health of women.
In the early 1960s the death rate for lung
cancer among women was less than five deaths
per 100,000 women, according to Richmond's

report.
8y1978, it said, the rate had tripled to nearly 15
deaths per 100,000 women, or 25,000 deaths a
year. By 1983, it estimated, the rate ot deaths for
women from lung cancer will rise to 25 per
100,000 women.
"Cigarette smoking, an early sign of woman's
social emancipation, is nowa majorthreat to her
personal health and her ability to bear healthy
children," the report said.
The report also cited new evidence that
women who smoke have more complications in
pregnancy, and deliver lighter-weight and more
premature babies with greater health risks.
Richmond also said that there is some evi
dence, not yet fully confirmed, that carbon
monoxide in cigarettes, present even in those
brands with lower yields of tar and nicotine, may
be responsible for the lighter-weight newborn
babies.
The report said that one out of every three
smokers makes a serious attempt every year to
quit smoking, and that 20 percent are success
ful.
