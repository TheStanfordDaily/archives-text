# Fraternities under fire at Dartmouth

Hanover, N.H. (AP) —
Dartmouth College students
say they need fraternities be
cause there isn't much to do in
this small community. Now, a
faculty committee battling
sexism wants the fraternities
closed — unless women are al
lowed to live in them.
Students — male and female
— at this Ivy League school say
the "forced integration of the
sexes" will destroy the hal
lowed traditions of the frater
nity system.
The committee report, is
sued last week, called the
fraternities "bastions of white
male dominance" that control
the social life of Dartmouth
undergraduates. It demanded
fraternities begin accepting
women and sororities begin
accepting men, and that
fraternities beef up recruiting
of minorities.
Dartmouth's faculty voted in
1978 in favor of abolishing
fraternities and sororities be
cause of "abuses . . .
categorized as sexism, racism
and anti-intellectualism."
College official? say the vote
prompted the investigation by

the faculty committee, which
now goes to the board of trus
tees.
"What bothers the faculty is
that the predominantly male
fraternity system excludes and
has a negative attitude toward
women," said committee
member Charles McLane.
"The sexism, the massive male
dominance, is what is trouble
some."
Hanover has two bars and
two movie theaters, students
note, so fraternities are the
heart of Dartmouth's social
life. Says the report: "Hanover
is without the usual places for
letting off steam that most col
lege towns possess."
David Kollmorgan, president
of the inter-fraternity council,
says "there isn't a pure WASP
frat on campus." He argues
there are "certain aspects of
all-male companionship that
you can only get in a frater
nity."
"There are certain needs
which women have apart from
men, and the women in this
sorority covet the all-women
environment that prevails,"
said )anet Jakobsen, president
of Sigma Kappa.
