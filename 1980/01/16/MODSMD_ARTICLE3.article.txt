# Students campaign for Carter
## 
### Cameron Smith 
To stimulate public awareness of the major issues of
the 1980 presidential campaign is one of the goals of the
newly-formed Stanford Carter-Mondale Campaign
Committee, according to sophomore Brad Crystal, who
organized and chaired the group's first meeting.
Held on Monday evening in the Hillel lounge of the
Old Union Clubhouse, the meeting brought together
eight students interested in supporting the re-election
of President |immy Carter.
The group hopes to make the public more aware of
what it sees as Carter's strengths by sponsoring speak
ers, rallies and benefit events on campus. In addition,
the committee plans to organize a voter registration
effort, staff an information table in White Plaza and par
ticipate in off-campus campaign activities and Democra
tic party events.
Members are also attempting to gain endorsements of
Carter's campaign by prominent University professors
and administrators.
"Carter is the most courageous, sincere and effective
man of all the people running. He is not merely the
lesser of two evils; he represents a strength in the White
House," said Crystal, a political science major. It is this
message, he said, he hopes to spread to students
through campus activities. "Youth support could be key

in this election ... if we can get students to come out to
the polls," he added.
Clay Smith, a junior at UC-Berkeley and Northern
California campus coordinator for the state-wide
Carter-Mondale organization, particularly urged stu
dents to take part in a California Young Democrats
caucus meeting Saturday morning at the State Democra
tic Convention in the San Francisco Hilton Hotel.
Smith also suggested participation in a benefit brunch
to be attended by Carter Feb. 8 in San Francisco and
assistance in local party caucuses in May to elect dele
gates to the National Democratic Convention.
One student, Brad Heinz, will attend the stateconven
tion this weekend as a delegate. He was appointed to
represent the legislative district of his hometown, West
Covina, by his state legislator. Heinz, a junior in interna
tional relations, is also organizing the Stanford Democ
rats, a group which, he said, he hopes will coordinate
the voter registration efforts of Democratic campaigns
on campus.
While the Stanford Carter-Mondale Campaign Com
mittee currently has no funds, members proposed to
raise money by sponsoring a benefit concert, as well as
by selling buttons and bumper stickers.
Tom Christopher, a junior in political science, was
selected to be the group's treasurer.
