# Wineries may aid in making gasohol

The Los Angeles Times
California win eries may soon
be pouring their products into
your fuel tank. And while it
may not be the very best vin
tage, it will come from the
same place.
A just-released preliminary
study coordinated at the Uni
versity of California at Davis
(UC-Davis) found that produc
tion of alcohol for gasohol by
wineries is feasible, and the
vineyard-to-gas pump link also
is getting a boost from the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
An estimated 40 of Califor
nia's 350 wineries produce
brandy and high-proof alcohol
for use in dessert and aperitif
wines, utilizing distillation
equipment necessary to pro
duce the key component for
gasohol, a 9-1 mix of gasoline
and alcohol.
The study found that the
equipment is used by the
wineries only 25 percent of the
time. During the remaining 75
percent, it could produce
some 60 million to 75 million
gallons per year of above
170-proof alcohol, suitable tor
gasohol.

This would meet an esti
mated one percent of Califor
nia's annual needs. While pro
duction from major grain distil
leries across the country would
dwarf this figure, it would,
nevertheless, be a significant
contribution if added to other
fuel conservation moves.
Secretary of Agriculture Bob
Bergland said in Des Moines,
lowa, earlier this week that his
department was working with
California wineries on the pro
ject. "The wineries have a
burning interest in it, since ob
viously it would make them
more efficient," Bergland said.
Bergland made the state
ment while discussing the ad
ministration's efforts to ease
the effect on farmers of an em
bargo on grain sales to the
Soviet Union.
The government is attempt
ing to divert 17 million tons of
Russia-bound grains to other
uses. The making of alcohol for
gasohol would utilize a great
deal of the surplus.
Though optimistic on the
feasibility of the project, the
report warned that the
"economic problems deserve
scrutiny."
