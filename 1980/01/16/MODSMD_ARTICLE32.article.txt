## Entertainer, hustler, magician: Kim Belton is the greatest 
### 
Chris Haft

His flaws are evident, as
evident as the grimaces of
disgust he is wont to flash
during a difficult game. Un
like most basketball stars,
he cannot shoot from out
side. His passing is occa
sionally flashy, but also un
reliable. At 6-foot-7, he
lacks the physical smooth
ness necessary to play guard
that many players of his
height possess.
Yet his gifts, too, are evi
dent, as evident as his im
pressive musculature or the
number 41 he wears. His
opponents know his offen
sive talents generate from
underneath or close to the
basket, but they still cannot
stop him. He constantly
wins battles — for a basket,
for a rebound, for a loose
ball — with men larger or
quicker than he. Recently
he has given evidence that
he has conquered his most
glaring on-court weakness,
thus showing his dedication
and perseverence.
It might be wrong to call
Kimberly Belton the
greatest player in Stanford's

men's basketball history.
That mantle will probably
always be reserved for Hank
Luisetti, who pioneered the
one-handed jump shot here
from 1936 to 1918.
There is no doubt, how
ever, that Belton ranks as
the most dynamic Cardinal
basketball performer ever.
A human synthesis of power
and agility, Belton plays
with a verve never seen be
fore in Maples Pavilion.
Belton doesn't just play
basketball — he entertains
while doing so. A man of
many faces, Belton's fea
tures perpetually remain
animated: first a look of fury
when an opponent whisks
past Stanford on a back
door lay-up, then a smug
grin after dunking over a
hapless foe, now an in
credulous gape as an official
makes a doubtful decision.
Add all this to the con
stant clapping and shouting
Belton offers, and you im
mediately sense the excite
ment and joy that the Bronx,
N.V., senior surely feels on
the court.

It is also easy — and un
pleasant — to sense the
physical punishment Belton
takes. At22o pounds, Belton
is built like a football tight
end or a heavyweight
prizefighter, yet he is forced
to use every bit of his mus
cle to compensate for his
teammates' rebounding dif
ficulties and duel with the
behemoths of the Pacific-10
Conference.
At UCLA last month, Bel
ton seemingly spent every
other minute picking him
self up off Pauley Pavilion's
floor. He dove for nearly
every loose ball, rebound or
pass that was within reach.
The "boom" from Belton's
body striking hardwood or
even concrete was as re
sounding and constant a
noise as the referee's whis
tle.
If Belton's hustle is a con
stant part of his game, then
his shot selection is even
more so. Because Belton
lacks good outside shooting
touch — his rare 15-foot at

tempts invariably carom
hard off the front rim — he
is forced to pick up his
points through short jum
pers, lay-ins or stuff shots.
But what short jumpers,
lay-ins and stuff shots they
are! Try as they might, op
posing teams have not yet
curtailed Belton's efforts to
reach the hoop. Sheer
strength or a well-timed
drop step are two of Bel
ton's tools for slicing
through defenses.
On a few occasions, when
he has been denied an easy
route to the basket, or heav
ily guarded by two or more
defenders, Belton has re
sponded with an amazing
move: taking off from one
side of the basket, he leaps
across to the other side,
meanwhile windmilling the
ball two or three times in a
circular motion before fi
nally putting it up and in.
Once witnessed, this sort of
shot becomes fixed in
memory.
However, another

memorable part of Belton's
game is his free-throw
shooting, which was an
abysmal 42.6 percent (58-
for-136) last season.
Fans regarded his appear
ances at the free-throw line
as tremendous jokes.
Whenever Belton made a
free throw, the feat was met
with condescending cheers
of surprise.
This season began no dif
ferently Belton sank only
three of nine free throws in
a 61-59 loss at Air Force.
"You guys have just got to
bear with me, that's all," a
slightly exasperated Belton
urged early in the season.
Obviously Belton knew
what he was talking about,
for in his last seven games
he has converted 79.3 per
cent of his free throws — an
astounding improvement.
Belton has made 23 of his
last 27 charity shots, includ
ing nine of 10 against
Arizona and seven of seven
against Washington State.
To climax his emergence

as a competent free-throw
shooter, Belton even shot a
technical foul — a privilege
usually reserved fora team's
best shooter.
Thus, Belton ranks as one
of Stanford's best — not
only today, but also for all
time. He currently ranks
fifth on the Card career
scoring list with 1380 points,
behind only Claude Terry
(1566), Tom Dose (1441),
Ron Tomsic (1416) and Rich
Kelly (1412). Belton is also
second in career rebound
ing with 843, trailing just Kel
ley (944).
Barring a shocking slump,
then, Belton could end the
season and his Stanford
career as the all-time rio. 1
Card scorer and rebounder.
Dynamic, yes. The great
est. . . .?
Whether or not he
achieves these marks, Bel
ton is assured of the record
that matters most for sen
tient sports fans: most
thrills and excitement pro
vided.
