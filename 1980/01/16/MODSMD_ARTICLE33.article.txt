## UCLA searching for top 20, AD 
### Associated Press 
More often than not during
the past 15 years, UCLA has
been No. 1 nationally. Now,
the Bruins aren't even No. 1 in
Los Angeles and they're not
ranked among the nation's top
20 college basketball teams.
The Bruins were strangely
absent from this week's As
sociated Press poll, released
on Monday. Sports Informa
tion Director Vic Kelly said it's
believed that UCLA is un
ranked for the first time since
the 1965-66 season.
UCLA's string of 13 straight
league championships is in
serious jeopardy, although
there's a long way to go in the
Pacific-10 Conference's 18-
game schedule.
After losing to crosstown
rival Southern California 82-74
last Saturday—the first UCLA
loss to a Trojan team since 1970
— the Bruins are 3-2 in Pac-10
action and 8-4 overall.
It's been quite a comedown
for UCLA, which starting in

1963-64, won 10 NCAA champ
ionships in 12 seasons. All
came under Coach John
Wooden, who retired follow
ing the 1974-75 campaign.
Gene Barton and Gary Cun
ningham coached the Bruins
for two years each, and al
though both were successful
— UCLA's record during those
four seasons was 102-17 —
there were no NCAA titles.
And now, under first year
Coach Larry Brown, there
might not be a conference title.
Fourth-ranked Oregon State,
along with Southern Cal,
Arizona State, Washington
State and Washington appear
to have legitimate chances to
beat out the Bruins this season.
Washington State raised its
conference record to 4-1 and
its overall mark to 12-2 with an
easy 83-64 victory over visiting
California Monday night.
UCLA entertains Arizona
State tomorrow night, a game
Brown calls the most critical of

the season.
"If we get that one, we'll be
4-2 and Oregon State has to
come here to play us," said
Brown Monday. "A loss could
affect our confidence and out
look for the rest of the season.
Oregon State is one of the
four teams to beat UCLA this
season — the others are
Southern Cal, top-ranked De-
Paul, and eighth-ranked Notre
Dame.
The Bruins will get a chance
to avenge the Notre Dame loss
when the teams square off in a
nationally televised game at
Pauley Pavilion Saturday after
noon.
Brown said he may start four
freshmen — guards Rod Foster
and Michael Holton, forward
Cliff Pruitt and swing man Dar
ren Daye — against Arizona
State.
"Our experienced players
are not accepting responsibil
ity or leading and directing the
team," said Brown. "Coach

Wooden told me that if you
play as many freshmen as he
does, they'll make mistakes.
They're not supposed to win
games, but I think we could be
8-4 even if he started four
freshmen.

now? Heck, yes."

though both were successful
— UCLA's record during those
four seasons was 102-17 —
there were no NCAA titles.
And now, under first year
Coach Larry Brown, there
might not be a conference title.
Fourth-ranked Oregon State,
along with Southern Cal,
Arizona State, Washington
State and Washington appear
to have legitimate chances to
beat out the Bruins this season.
Washington State raised its
conference record to 4-1 and
its overall mark to 12-2 with an
easy 83-64 victory over visiting
California Monday night.
UCLA entertains Arizona
State tomorrow night, a game
Brown calls the most critical of

the season.
"If we get that one, we'll be
4-2 and Oregon State has to
come here to play us," said
Brown Monday. "A loss could
affect our confidence and out
look for the rest of the season.
Oregon State is one of the
four teams to beat UCLA this
season — the others are
Southern Cal, top-ranked De-
Paul, and eighth-ranked Notre
Dame.
The Bruins will get a chance
to avenge the Notre Dame loss
when the teams square off in a
nationally televised game at
Pauley Pavilion Saturday after
noon.
Brown said he may start four
freshmen — guards Rod Foster
and Michael Holton, forward
Cliff Pruitt and swing man Dar
ren Daye — against Arizona
State.
"Our experienced players
are not accepting responsibil
ity or leading and directing the
team," said Brown. "Coach

Wooden told me that if you
play as many freshmen as he
does, they'll make mistakes.
They're not supposed to win
games, but I think we could be
8-4 even if he started four
freshmen.
"Would I consider doing it
now? Heck, yes."
