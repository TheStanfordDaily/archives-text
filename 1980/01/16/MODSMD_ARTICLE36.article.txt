Pat-10 honors Carfino
San Francisco (AP) — Don
Carfino, the star of Southern
Calilornia's first basketball vic
'cry over UCLA since 1970, was
named Pacific-10 Player of the
Week Monday.
The 6-foot-3 senior guard
scored 24 points, his career
high, and had tour assists as
the Trojans beat UCLA 82-74
Saturday night. Earlier in the
week, Carfino scored 17 points
in a victory over Oregon.
Carfino is the leading Pac-10
scorer in conference games,
averaging 19.4 points for the
Trojans, 4-1.
Countdown begins
Los Angeles (AP) — The
Super Bowl Week ritual of mass
press conferences began tor
the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los
Angeles Rams Tuesday as the
countdown to Sunday's Na
tional Football League champ
ionship game started.
The Steelers, in the big game
for the fourth time in six years,
are familiar with the routine
and deal with it rather
matter-of-factly. The Rams were
somewhat reluctant, still sizzl
ing over widespread criticism of
their mediocre 9-7 regular sea
son record.
There has been some talk on

the club of boycotting the
press conferences but the
carefully-choreographed NFL
program never would allow
such insurrection.
So, the show went on as
scheduled with dozens of writ
ers bussed from NFL headquar
ters in Los Angeles tirst to the
Steelers' camp at Fullerton and
then to the Rams in Anaheim.
Because this is their home
turf, the Ram players are not
required to check into the
hotel and they have the com
fort of working at the regular
practice site — both firsts for a
Super Bowl team.
Playing on the natural grass
of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena
could be another edge for the
Rams. The Steelers are more
accustomed to artificial sur
faces and played only twice on
grass this season — beating
Cleveland 51-35 and I osing to
San Diego 35-7. The Rams
played all of their home games
on grass.
All of those things — the
"home team'' advantage, the
grass field, the presence of
three ex-Steeler coaches on
their staff — hasn't changed
the oddsmakers' view of Los
Angeles' chances in Super Bowl
XIV. The Rams remain 11-point
underdogs.

Pat-10 honors Carfino
San Francisco (AP) — Don
Carfino, the star of Southern
Calilornia's first basketball vic
'cry over UCLA since 1970, was
named Pacific-10 Player of the
Week Monday.
The 6-foot-3 senior guard
scored 24 points, his career
high, and had tour assists as
the Trojans beat UCLA 82-74
Saturday night. Earlier in the
week, Carfino scored 17 points
in a victory over Oregon.
Carfino is the leading Pac-10
scorer in conference games,
averaging 19.4 points for the
Trojans, 4-1.
Countdown begins
Los Angeles (AP) — The
Super Bowl Week ritual of mass
press conferences began tor
the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los
Angeles Rams Tuesday as the
countdown to Sunday's Na
tional Football League champ
ionship game started.
The Steelers, in the big game
for the fourth time in six years,
are familiar with the routine
and deal with it rather
matter-of-factly. The Rams were
somewhat reluctant, still sizzl
ing over widespread criticism of
their mediocre 9-7 regular sea
son record.
There has been some talk on

the club of boycotting the
press conferences but the
carefully-choreographed NFL
program never would allow
such insurrection.
So, the show went on as
scheduled with dozens of writ
ers bussed from NFL headquar
ters in Los Angeles tirst to the
Steelers' camp at Fullerton and
then to the Rams in Anaheim.
Because this is their home
turf, the Ram players are not
required to check into the
hotel and they have the com
fort of working at the regular
practice site — both firsts for a
Super Bowl team.
Playing on the natural grass
of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena
could be another edge for the
Rams. The Steelers are more
accustomed to artificial sur
faces and played only twice on
grass this season — beating
Cleveland 51-35 and I osing to
San Diego 35-7. The Rams
played all of their home games
on grass.
All of those things — the
"home team'' advantage, the
grass field, the presence of
three ex-Steeler coaches on
their staff — hasn't changed
the oddsmakers' view of Los
Angeles' chances in Super Bowl
XIV. The Rams remain 11-point
underdogs.
