Soviets angered by resolution
Anti-communist rebels, reportedly fighting
a losing battle against a modern Soviet force,
claimed yesterday to be disrupting movement
along three roads into Kabul, forcing the
Soviets to airlift troop reinforcements and
supplies into the Afghan capital, a Pakistani
newspaper reported.
On the political front, the Soviets, angered
oy a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling
for withdrawal of their troops from Afghanis
tan, denounced the action as intervention in
Afghanistan's affairs.
The resolution, adopted by a vote of 104-18,
with most Moslem and Third World members
voting for it, did not name the Soviet Union
specifically. But it said the Assembly "strongly
deplores" military intervention in Afghanistan,
and called on the Security Council "to con
sider ways and means to implement" the with
drawal.
Other sources have said the rebels continue
to resist the Soviets in the northeastern pro
vince of Badakhshan and in Paktia, near the
Pakistani border. But on Monday, hundreds of
Soviet army trucks rolled northward through
Badakhshan with only a light guard.
Two Soviet motorized divisions numbering
some 25,000 men have moved into western
Afghanistan, in the Herat area 75 to 100 miles
from the Iranian border, but there is no indica
tion Iran's oilfields are threatened, a State De
partment spokesman said yesterday.
The official Soviet news agency Tass de
nounced as "concoctions" some U.S. news
reports that Soviet troops were amassing on
Afghanistan's border with Iran within striking
distance of the oilfields.
The Soviets reacted angrily, too, to the U.N.
General Assembly's call Monday for the troop
withdrawal.
In a Tass report from Moscow, the Soviets
condemned the U.N. move as "backstage ac
tions by American diplomats and others."
The statement quoted Afghan Foreign
Minister Shah Mohammad Dost as having told
the Assembly the resolution was "aimed at in
terference in the internal affairs of Afghanis
tan."
U.S. moves to help the thousands of Afghan
refugees fleeing across the border into Pakis
tan got under way yesterday with arrange
ments by the U.S. Agency for International
to ship tons of wheat, oil and
"milk.
Black leader's birth honored
Atlanta — First Lady Rosalynn Carter said
yesterday the president joins her in a renewed
commitment to work for a national holiday
honoring the |an. 15 birthdate of the late Mar
tin Luther King Jr.
Ms. Carter's remarks at a two-hour memorial
service before an overflow crowd at Ebenezer
Baptist Church came only hours after the mar
ble front of King's crypt was defaced during the
night by streaks of red, black and green paint.
"Hope, faith, love, that is what we celebrate
today," she said. "We must have a national
holiday to commemorate this great man of
hope, faith and love," Ms. Carter said.
The proposal for a national holiday for King
lost twice in the House last year and failed to
make much progress in the Senate. However,
the date is a holiday in the District of Colum
bia.

There were no arrests in the defacing of the
tomb. The Rev. Fred Bennett, chief of security
for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social
Change near the crypt, said he would not
begin an investigation until after yesterday's
activities.
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said Atlan
ta's City Hall was closed yesterday because
King's birthday has been a holiday in the city
for years.
"March to the ballot box and send your mes
sage to the state house," he told the crowd.
The Georgia Senate and House honored
King with a moment of silence, one of many
tributes throughout the country. In recent
years, the Legislature has failed to make King's
birthday a state holiday.
However, several states — including Mas
sachusetts, Delawareand Maryland — observe
Jan. 15 as a state holiday.
Gov't workers guilty of bribery
Washington — Evidence of corruption in the
General Services Administration mounted yes
terday as 11 persons agreed to plead guilty
here to bribery and conspiracy charges in a
scandal that has spread to 15 states and
Washington, D.C.
The plea agreements involve $415,000 in
fraud against the government and $120,000 in
bribes and kickbacks to federal workers.
They bring to 119 the number of indictments
nationwide against contractors and govern
ment employees, most of whom work for the
GSA — the government's Office Supply and
Building Maintenance agency.
The latest indication of corruption in the
huge agency came Monday when a GSA draft
audit was revealed showing that the agency
spent $500,000 for office space it never used in
a New York City building. Sources said that
audit and similar ones, details of which they
did not reveal, were evidence of continuing
mismanagement in the agency.
The GSA, which operates 10,000 properties
owned or leased by the government nation
wide, has been under investigation since 1977.
Its administrator, Rowland Freeman, is now
involved in a dispute over his efforts to remove
William Clinkscales from his job as deputy in
spector general.
In the latest plea agreements, Assistant U.S.
Attorney William Block filed criminal informa
tions outlining the charges against seven cur
rent and former GSA employees, a former
State Department employee and three con
tractors who did business with the GSA.
Criminal informations are legal papers filed
when defendants waive possible grand jury
indictments and agree to plead guilty. The new
plea agreements all involve fraud in the na
tion's capital.
Block said the contractors will admit in court
that they negotiated contracts worth more
than $850,000, with more than $415,000 ob
tained through fraudulent billings. The gov
ernment employees will admit receiving at
least $120,000 in kickbacks and bribes, he said.
Court vindicates parole officer
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
told the father of a slain teenage girl he cannot
sue the parole officials who released his
daughter's murderer, a convicted sex offen
der.
Voting unanimously in a case from Califor-

nia, the justices ruled that states may give
parole officials absolute immunity from being
sued because of their parole decisions.
Laws granting such immunity do not violate
an individual's constitutional rights, the court
said in upholding state court rulings.
George Martinez of San Diego tried to sue
for $2 million after the 1975 kidnapping and
murder of his 15-year-old daughter, Mary El
len, by a man paroled five months earlier.
Martinez charged that state parole officials
had abused their duty when they paroled
Richard Thomas, designated as a medically
disordered sex offender not amenable to
treatment.
Thomas had been sentenced to prison for six
months to 20 years for trying to rape two young
girls in the same San Diego neighborhood
from which Mary Ellen Martinez was abducted.
Thomas' sentencing judge recommended
that he not be paroled, but Thomas was re
leased March 10,1975, after serving five years.
The Martinez murder occurred Aug. 1, 1975.
The dismissed lawsuit contended that the
granting of Thomas' parole was negligent, re
ckless and malicious.
In another significant constitutional deci
sion yesterday, the court said that before
stripping any person of U.S. citizenship, the
government must prove that person inten
tionally renounced citizenship.
The court thus rejected State Department
contentions that it need only prove the com
mission of some voluntary act of expatriation,
such as pledging allegiance to a foreign nation,
before taking away U.S. citizenship.
The ruling, however, did not resolve the
controversy which carried the expatriation
issue to the nation's highest court.
Laurence Terrazas was born in Takoma
Park, Mo., in 1947. His father was a citizen of
Mexico and his mother a U.S. citizen — mak
ing him a citizen of both countries at birth.
While a student in Monterey, Mexico, in
1970, Terrazas claims he was told by a school
official that he needed to sign a certificate of
Mexican nationality before receiving a dip
loma.
The certificate he signed renounced his U.S.
citizenship, but the young man later said he
had no idea that his signing would have such
an effect.
Terrazas sued to regain his citizenship.
Chappaquiddick story refuted
Washington — Two new investigative reports
on Chappaquiddick have raised fresh ques
tions about whether Sen. Edward Kennedy
told the truth about the automobile accident
that took Mary )o Kopechne's life. Kennedy
said yesterday that both reports are inaccurate.
As he has almost since the accident on July
18, 1969, Kennedy stuck to his version of the
tragedy, and said one of the new reports —
published by The Washington Star — "is
wrong, is wrong, is dead wrong."
In a lengthy article to be published in the
Digest's February issue, senior editor John
Barron said independent scientific studies and
the Digest's own investigation challenge Ken
nedy's version of the accident, in which 29-
year-old Mary Jo Kopechne drowned.
The Digest account was immediately chal
lenged by Kennedy's presidential campaign
manager and brother-in-law, Stephen Smith,
who told a hastily called news conference here
that Kennedy stands by his version of the

events on the night of July 18,1969. Kennedy is
running for the 1980 Democratic presidential
nomination.
The magazine, which said it had been re
fused an interview with the Massachusetts
senator, also published a new tidal current
study that tends to support the testimony of
Kennedy and his colleagues that they encoun
tered a strong current at the accident scene
when they tried to rescue Kopechne, whose
body was trapped in Kennedy's submerged
Oldsmobile.
The author, however, concluded that al
though the current "would constitute a sig
nificant impediment to someone trying to
swim any appreciable distance against it. .
water safety experts believe that such a current
would not have posed an insurmountable obs
tacle to a poised and experienced swimmer
determined to rescue someone."
Arguments open in Ford trial
Winanac, Ind. — Ford Motor Co. "deliber
ately chose profit over human life" in selling its
Pinto automobiles while knowing that the car's
fuel system was unsafe, a prosecutor said yes
terday in opening arguments for the au
tomaker's criminal liability trial.
Prosecutor Michael Cosentino told a Pulaski
Circuit Court jury that Ford refused to alter the
Pinto fuel system "for the sole reason that they
would save money by not doing so."
Chief Ford attorney lames Neal replied in his
opening statement that the Pinto was safer
than many sub-compact models and that Ford
decided in )une 1978 to recall 1971-76 Pintos
"to even improve it, to make it safer."
Ford is charged with three counts of reckless
homicide in the August 1978 deaths of three
women in a 1973 Pinto that exploded when hit
from behind by a van traveling 50 mph near
Goshen, Ind.
The state contends Ford marketed the car
and 1.5 million other Pintos and Mercury Bob
cats while knowing the fuel tanks were likely to
explode in rear-end collisions.
Opening arguments before the jury of seven
men and five women came after a day and a
half of preliminary legal skirmishing. Earlier
yesterday, the prosecution lost an effort to
present photographs and other evidence
about the victims of the Pinto crash that
triggered the trial, the first criminal prosecu
tion of a manufacturer in a prpduct defects
case.
Testimony was scheduled to begin today,
with the trial expected to last about two
months in this farming community of 2400.

Chappaquiddick story refuted
Washington — Two new investigative reports
on Chappaquiddick have raised fresh ques

that took Mary )o Kopechne's life. Kennedy
said yesterday that both reports are inaccurate.
As he has almost since the accident on July
18, 1969, Kennedy stuck to his version of the
tragedy, and said one of the new reports —
published by The Washington Star — "is
wrong, is wrong, is dead wrong."
In a lengthy article to be published in the
Digest's February issue, senior editor John

the Digest's own investigation challenge Ken

year-old Mary Jo Kopechne drowned.
The Digest account was immediately chal

manager and brother-in-law, Stephen Smith,

that Kennedy stands by his version of the

Arguments open in Ford trial
Winanac, Ind. — Ford Motor Co. "deliber
ately chose profit over human life" in selling its
Pinto automobiles while knowing that the car's
fuel system was unsafe, a prosecutor said yes
terday in opening arguments for the au
tomaker's criminal liability trial.
Prosecutor Michael Cosentino told a Pulaski
Circuit Court jury that Ford refused to alter the
Pinto fuel system "for the sole reason that they
would save money by not doing so."
Chief Ford attorney lames Neal replied in his
opening statement that the Pinto was safer
than many sub-compact models and that Ford
decided in )une 1978 to recall 1971-76 Pintos
"to even improve it, to make it safer."
Ford is charged with three counts of reckless
homicide in the August 1978 deaths of three
women in a 1973 Pinto that exploded when hit
from behind by a van traveling 50 mph near
Goshen, Ind.
The state contends Ford marketed the car
and 1.5 million other Pintos and Mercury Bob
cats while knowing the fuel tanks were likely to
explode in rear-end collisions.
Opening arguments before the jury of seven
men and five women came after a day and a

Soviets angered by resolution
Anti-communist rebels, reportedly fighting
a losing battle against a modern Soviet force,
claimed yesterday to be disrupting movement
along three roads into Kabul, forcing the
Soviets to airlift troop reinforcements and
supplies into the Afghan capital, a Pakistani
newspaper reported.
On the political front, the Soviets, angered
oy a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling
for withdrawal of their troops from Afghanis
tan, denounced the action as intervention in
Afghanistan's affairs.
The resolution, adopted by a vote of 104-18,
with most Moslem and Third World members
voting for it, did not name the Soviet Union
specifically. But it said the Assembly "strongly
deplores" military intervention in Afghanistan,
and called on the Security Council "to con
sider ways and means to implement" the with
drawal.
Other sources have said the rebels continue
to resist the Soviets in the northeastern pro
vince of Badakhshan and in Paktia, near the
Pakistani border. But on Monday, hundreds of
Soviet army trucks rolled northward through
Badakhshan with only a light guard.
Two Soviet motorized divisions numbering
some 25,000 men have moved into western
Afghanistan, in the Herat area 75 to 100 miles
from the Iranian border, but there is no indica
tion Iran's oilfields are threatened, a State De
partment spokesman said yesterday.
The official Soviet news agency Tass de
nounced as "concoctions" some U.S. news
reports that Soviet troops were amassing on
Afghanistan's border with Iran within striking
distance of the oilfields.
The Soviets reacted angrily, too, to the U.N.
General Assembly's call Monday for the troop
withdrawal.
In a Tass report from Moscow, the Soviets
condemned the U.N. move as "backstage ac
tions by American diplomats and others."
The statement quoted Afghan Foreign
Minister Shah Mohammad Dost as having told
the Assembly the resolution was "aimed at in
terference in the internal affairs of Afghanis
tan."
U.S. moves to help the thousands of Afghan
refugees fleeing across the border into Pakis
tan got under way yesterday with arrange
ments by the U.S. Agency for International
to ship tons of wheat, oil and
"milk.
Black leader's birth honored
Atlanta — First Lady Rosalynn Carter said
yesterday the president joins her in a renewed
commitment to work for a national holiday
honoring the |an. 15 birthdate of the late Mar
tin Luther King Jr.
Ms. Carter's remarks at a two-hour memorial
service before an overflow crowd at Ebenezer
Baptist Church came only hours after the mar
ble front of King's crypt was defaced during the
night by streaks of red, black and green paint.
"Hope, faith, love, that is what we celebrate
today," she said. "We must have a national
holiday to commemorate this great man of
hope, faith and love," Ms. Carter said.
The proposal for a national holiday for King
lost twice in the House last year and failed to
make much progress in the Senate. However,
the date is a holiday in the District of Colum
bia.

There were no arrests in the defacing of the
tomb. The Rev. Fred Bennett, chief of security
for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social
Change near the crypt, said he would not
begin an investigation until after yesterday's
activities.
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said Atlan
ta's City Hall was closed yesterday because
King's birthday has been a holiday in the city
for years.
"March to the ballot box and send your mes
sage to the state house," he told the crowd.
The Georgia Senate and House honored
King with a moment of silence, one of many
tributes throughout the country. In recent
years, the Legislature has failed to make King's
birthday a state holiday.
However, several states — including Mas
sachusetts, Delawareand Maryland — observe
Jan. 15 as a state holiday.
Gov't workers guilty of bribery
Washington — Evidence of corruption in the
General Services Administration mounted yes
terday as 11 persons agreed to plead guilty
here to bribery and conspiracy charges in a
scandal that has spread to 15 states and
Washington, D.C.
The plea agreements involve $415,000 in
fraud against the government and $120,000 in
bribes and kickbacks to federal workers.
They bring to 119 the number of indictments
nationwide against contractors and govern
ment employees, most of whom work for the
GSA — the government's Office Supply and
Building Maintenance agency.
The latest indication of corruption in the
huge agency came Monday when a GSA draft
audit was revealed showing that the agency
spent $500,000 for office space it never used in
a New York City building. Sources said that
audit and similar ones, details of which they
did not reveal, were evidence of continuing
mismanagement in the agency.
The GSA, which operates 10,000 properties
owned or leased by the government nation
wide, has been under investigation since 1977.
Its administrator, Rowland Freeman, is now
involved in a dispute over his efforts to remove
William Clinkscales from his job as deputy in
spector general.
In the latest plea agreements, Assistant U.S.
Attorney William Block filed criminal informa
tions outlining the charges against seven cur
rent and former GSA employees, a former
State Department employee and three con
tractors who did business with the GSA.
Criminal informations are legal papers filed
when defendants waive possible grand jury
indictments and agree to plead guilty. The new
plea agreements all involve fraud in the na
tion's capital.
Block said the contractors will admit in court
that they negotiated contracts worth more
than $850,000, with more than $415,000 ob
tained through fraudulent billings. The gov
ernment employees will admit receiving at
least $120,000 in kickbacks and bribes, he said.
Court vindicates parole officer
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
told the father of a slain teenage girl he cannot
sue the parole officials who released his
daughter's murderer, a convicted sex offen
der.
Voting unanimously in a case from Califor-

nia, the justices ruled that states may give
parole officials absolute immunity from being
sued because of their parole decisions.
Laws granting such immunity do not violate
an individual's constitutional rights, the court
said in upholding state court rulings.
George Martinez of San Diego tried to sue
for $2 million after the 1975 kidnapping and
murder of his 15-year-old daughter, Mary El
len, by a man paroled five months earlier.
Martinez charged that state parole officials
had abused their duty when they paroled
Richard Thomas, designated as a medically
disordered sex offender not amenable to
treatment.
Thomas had been sentenced to prison for six
months to 20 years for trying to rape two young
girls in the same San Diego neighborhood
from which Mary Ellen Martinez was abducted.
Thomas' sentencing judge recommended
that he not be paroled, but Thomas was re
leased March 10,1975, after serving five years.
The Martinez murder occurred Aug. 1, 1975.
The dismissed lawsuit contended that the
granting of Thomas' parole was negligent, re
ckless and malicious.
In another significant constitutional deci
sion yesterday, the court said that before
stripping any person of U.S. citizenship, the
government must prove that person inten
tionally renounced citizenship.

Black leader's birth honored
Atlanta — First Lady Rosalynn Carter said
yesterday the president joins her in a renewed
commitment to work for a national holiday
honoring the |an. 15 birthdate of the late Mar
tin Luther King Jr.
Ms. Carter's remarks at a two-hour memorial
service before an overflow crowd at Ebenezer
Baptist Church came only hours after the mar
ble front of King's crypt was defaced during the
night by streaks of red, black and green paint.
"Hope, faith, love, that is what we celebrate
today," she said. "We must have a national
holiday to commemorate this great man of
hope, faith and love," Ms. Carter said.
The proposal for a national holiday for King
lost twice in the House last year and failed to
make much progress in the Senate. However,
the date is a holiday in the District of Colum
bia.

There were no arrests in the defacing of the
tomb. The Rev. Fred Bennett, chief of security
for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social
Change near the crypt, said he would not
begin an investigation until after yesterday's
activities.
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said Atlan
ta's City Hall was closed yesterday because
King's birthday has been a holiday in the city
for years.
"March to the ballot box and send your mes
sage to the state house," he told the crowd.
The Georgia Senate and House honored
King with a moment of silence, one of many
tributes throughout the country. In recent
years, the Legislature has failed to make King's
birthday a state holiday.
However, several states — including Mas
sachusetts, Delawareand Maryland — observe
Jan. 15 as a state holiday.
Gov't workers guilty of bribery
Washington — Evidence of corruption in the
General Services Administration mounted yes
terday as 11 persons agreed to plead guilty
here to bribery and conspiracy charges in a
scandal that has spread to 15 states and
Washington, D.C.
The plea agreements involve $415,000 in
fraud against the government and $120,000 in
bribes and kickbacks to federal workers.
They bring to 119 the number of indictments
nationwide against contractors and govern
ment employees, most of whom work for the
GSA — the government's Office Supply and
Building Maintenance agency.
The latest indication of corruption in the
huge agency came Monday when a GSA draft
audit was revealed showing that the agency
spent $500,000 for office space it never used in
a New York City building. Sources said that
audit and similar ones, details of which they
did not reveal, were evidence of continuing
mismanagement in the agency.
The GSA, which operates 10,000 properties
owned or leased by the government nation
wide, has been under investigation since 1977.
Its administrator, Rowland Freeman, is now
involved in a dispute over his efforts to remove
William Clinkscales from his job as deputy in
spector general.
In the latest plea agreements, Assistant U.S.
Attorney William Block filed criminal informa
tions outlining the charges against seven cur
rent and former GSA employees, a former
State Department employee and three con
tractors who did business with the GSA.
Criminal informations are legal papers filed
when defendants waive possible grand jury
indictments and agree to plead guilty. The new
plea agreements all involve fraud in the na
tion's capital.
Block said the contractors will admit in court
that they negotiated contracts worth more
than $850,000, with more than $415,000 ob
tained through fraudulent billings. The gov
ernment employees will admit receiving at
least $120,000 in kickbacks and bribes, he said.
Court vindicates parole officer
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
told the father of a slain teenage girl he cannot
sue the parole officials who released his
daughter's murderer, a convicted sex offen
der.
Voting unanimously in a case from Califor-

nia, the justices ruled that states may give
parole officials absolute immunity from being
sued because of their parole decisions.
Laws granting such immunity do not violate
an individual's constitutional rights, the court
said in upholding state court rulings.
George Martinez of San Diego tried to sue
for $2 million after the 1975 kidnapping and
murder of his 15-year-old daughter, Mary El
len, by a man paroled five months earlier.
Martinez charged that state parole officials
had abused their duty when they paroled
Richard Thomas, designated as a medically
disordered sex offender not amenable to
treatment.
Thomas had been sentenced to prison for six
months to 20 years for trying to rape two young
girls in the same San Diego neighborhood
from which Mary Ellen Martinez was abducted.
Thomas' sentencing judge recommended
that he not be paroled, but Thomas was re
leased March 10,1975, after serving five years.
The Martinez murder occurred Aug. 1, 1975.
The dismissed lawsuit contended that the
granting of Thomas' parole was negligent, re
ckless and malicious.
In another significant constitutional deci
sion yesterday, the court said that before
stripping any person of U.S. citizenship, the
government must prove that person inten
tionally renounced citizenship.
The court thus rejected State Department
contentions that it need only prove the com
mission of some voluntary act of expatriation,
such as pledging allegiance to a foreign nation,
before taking away U.S. citizenship.
The ruling, however, did not resolve the
controversy which carried the expatriation
issue to the nation's highest court.
Laurence Terrazas was born in Takoma

Chappaquiddick story refuted
Washington — Two new investigative reports
on Chappaquiddick have raised fresh ques
tions about whether Sen. Edward Kennedy
told the truth about the automobile accident
that took Mary )o Kopechne's life. Kennedy
said yesterday that both reports are inaccurate.
As he has almost since the accident on July
18, 1969, Kennedy stuck to his version of the
tragedy, and said one of the new reports —
published by The Washington Star — "is
wrong, is wrong, is dead wrong."
In a lengthy article to be published in the
Digest's February issue, senior editor John
Barron said independent scientific studies and
the Digest's own investigation challenge Ken
nedy's version of the accident, in which 29-
year-old Mary Jo Kopechne drowned.
The Digest account was immediately chal
lenged by Kennedy's presidential campaign
manager and brother-in-law, Stephen Smith,
who told a hastily called news conference here
that Kennedy stands by his version of the

events on the night of July 18,1969. Kennedy is
running for the 1980 Democratic presidential
nomination.
The magazine, which said it had been re
fused an interview with the Massachusetts
senator, also published a new tidal current
study that tends to support the testimony of
Kennedy and his colleagues that they encoun
tered a strong current at the accident scene
when they tried to rescue Kopechne, whose
body was trapped in Kennedy's submerged
Oldsmobile.
The author, however, concluded that al
though the current "would constitute a sig
nificant impediment to someone trying to
swim any appreciable distance against it. .
water safety experts believe that such a current
would not have posed an insurmountable obs
tacle to a poised and experienced swimmer
determined to rescue someone."
Arguments open in Ford trial
Winanac, Ind. — Ford Motor Co. "deliber
ately chose profit over human life" in selling its
Pinto automobiles while knowing that the car's
fuel system was unsafe, a prosecutor said yes
terday in opening arguments for the au
tomaker's criminal liability trial.
Prosecutor Michael Cosentino told a Pulaski
Circuit Court jury that Ford refused to alter the
Pinto fuel system "for the sole reason that they
would save money by not doing so."
Chief Ford attorney lames Neal replied in his
opening statement that the Pinto was safer
than many sub-compact models and that Ford
decided in )une 1978 to recall 1971-76 Pintos
"to even improve it, to make it safer."
Ford is charged with three counts of reckless
homicide in the August 1978 deaths of three
women in a 1973 Pinto that exploded when hit
from behind by a van traveling 50 mph near
Goshen, Ind.
The state contends Ford marketed the car
and 1.5 million other Pintos and Mercury Bob
cats while knowing the fuel tanks were likely to
explode in rear-end collisions.
Opening arguments before the jury of seven
men and five women came after a day and a
half of preliminary legal skirmishing. Earlier
yesterday, the prosecution lost an effort to
present photographs and other evidence
about the victims of the Pinto crash that
triggered the trial, the first criminal prosecu
tion of a manufacturer in a prpduct defects
case.
Testimony was scheduled to begin today,
with the trial expected to last about two
months in this farming community of 2400.

Soviets angered by resolution
Anti-communist rebels, reportedly fighting
a losing battle against a modern Soviet force,
claimed yesterday to be disrupting movement
along three roads into Kabul, forcing the
Soviets to airlift troop reinforcements and
supplies into the Afghan capital, a Pakistani
newspaper reported.
On the political front, the Soviets, angered
oy a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling
for withdrawal of their troops from Afghanis
tan, denounced the action as intervention in
Afghanistan's affairs.
The resolution, adopted by a vote of 104-18,
with most Moslem and Third World members
voting for it, did not name the Soviet Union
specifically. But it said the Assembly "strongly
deplores" military intervention in Afghanistan,
and called on the Security Council "to con
sider ways and means to implement" the with
drawal.
Other sources have said the rebels continue
to resist the Soviets in the northeastern pro
vince of Badakhshan and in Paktia, near the
Pakistani border. But on Monday, hundreds of
Soviet army trucks rolled northward through
Badakhshan with only a light guard.
Two Soviet motorized divisions numbering
some 25,000 men have moved into western
Afghanistan, in the Herat area 75 to 100 miles
from the Iranian border, but there is no indica
tion Iran's oilfields are threatened, a State De
partment spokesman said yesterday.
The official Soviet news agency Tass de
nounced as "concoctions" some U.S. news
reports that Soviet troops were amassing on
Afghanistan's border with Iran within striking
distance of the oilfields.

said yesterday that both reports are inaccurate.
As he has almost since the accident on July
18, 1969, Kennedy stuck to his version of the
tragedy, and said one of the new reports —
published by The Washington Star — "is

In a lengthy article to be published in the

The Digest account was immediately chal

Arguments open in Ford trial
Winanac, Ind. — Ford Motor Co. "deliber
ately chose profit over human life" in selling its
Pinto automobiles while knowing that the car's
fuel system was unsafe, a prosecutor said yes
terday in opening arguments for the au
tomaker's criminal liability trial.
Prosecutor Michael Cosentino told a Pulaski
Circuit Court jury that Ford refused to alter the
Pinto fuel system "for the sole reason that they
would save money by not doing so."
Chief Ford attorney lames Neal replied in his
opening statement that the Pinto was safer
than many sub-compact models and that Ford
decided in )une 1978 to recall 1971-76 Pintos
"to even improve it, to make it safer."
Ford is charged with three counts of reckless
homicide in the August 1978 deaths of three
women in a 1973 Pinto that exploded when hit
from behind by a van traveling 50 mph near
Goshen, Ind.
The state contends Ford marketed the car
and 1.5 million other Pintos and Mercury Bob
cats while knowing the fuel tanks were likely to
explode in rear-end collisions.
Opening arguments before the jury of seven
men and five women came after a day and a
half of preliminary legal skirmishing. Earlier
yesterday, the prosecution lost an effort to
present photographs and other evidence
about the victims of the Pinto crash that
triggered the trial, the first criminal prosecu
tion of a manufacturer in a prpduct defects
case.
Testimony was scheduled to begin today,
with the trial expected to last about two
months in this farming community of 2400.

Soviets angered by resolution
Anti-communist rebels, reportedly fighting
a losing battle against a modern Soviet force,
claimed yesterday to be disrupting movement
along three roads into Kabul, forcing the
Soviets to airlift troop reinforcements and
supplies into the Afghan capital, a Pakistani
newspaper reported.
On the political front, the Soviets, angered
oy a U.N. General Assembly resolution calling
for withdrawal of their troops from Afghanis
tan, denounced the action as intervention in
Afghanistan's affairs.
The resolution, adopted by a vote of 104-18,
with most Moslem and Third World members
voting for it, did not name the Soviet Union
specifically. But it said the Assembly "strongly
deplores" military intervention in Afghanistan,
and called on the Security Council "to con
sider ways and means to implement" the with
drawal.
Other sources have said the rebels continue
to resist the Soviets in the northeastern pro
vince of Badakhshan and in Paktia, near the
Pakistani border. But on Monday, hundreds of
Soviet army trucks rolled northward through
Badakhshan with only a light guard.
Two Soviet motorized divisions numbering
some 25,000 men have moved into western
Afghanistan, in the Herat area 75 to 100 miles
from the Iranian border, but there is no indica
tion Iran's oilfields are threatened, a State De
partment spokesman said yesterday.
The official Soviet news agency Tass de
nounced as "concoctions" some U.S. news
reports that Soviet troops were amassing on
Afghanistan's border with Iran within striking
distance of the oilfields.
The Soviets reacted angrily, too, to the U.N.
General Assembly's call Monday for the troop
withdrawal.
In a Tass report from Moscow, the Soviets
condemned the U.N. move as "backstage ac
tions by American diplomats and others."
The statement quoted Afghan Foreign
Minister Shah Mohammad Dost as having told
the Assembly the resolution was "aimed at in
terference in the internal affairs of Afghanis
tan."
U.S. moves to help the thousands of Afghan
refugees fleeing across the border into Pakis
tan got under way yesterday with arrange
ments by the U.S. Agency for International
to ship tons of wheat, oil and
"milk.
Black leader's birth honored
Atlanta — First Lady Rosalynn Carter said
yesterday the president joins her in a renewed
commitment to work for a national holiday
honoring the |an. 15 birthdate of the late Mar
tin Luther King Jr.
Ms. Carter's remarks at a two-hour memorial
service before an overflow crowd at Ebenezer
Baptist Church came only hours after the mar
ble front of King's crypt was defaced during the
night by streaks of red, black and green paint.
"Hope, faith, love, that is what we celebrate
today," she said. "We must have a national
holiday to commemorate this great man of
hope, faith and love," Ms. Carter said.
The proposal for a national holiday for King
lost twice in the House last year and failed to
make much progress in the Senate. However,
the date is a holiday in the District of Colum
bia.

There were no arrests in the defacing of the
tomb. The Rev. Fred Bennett, chief of security
for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Social
Change near the crypt, said he would not
begin an investigation until after yesterday's
activities.
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said Atlan
ta's City Hall was closed yesterday because
King's birthday has been a holiday in the city
for years.
"March to the ballot box and send your mes
sage to the state house," he told the crowd.
The Georgia Senate and House honored
King with a moment of silence, one of many
tributes throughout the country. In recent
years, the Legislature has failed to make King's
birthday a state holiday.
However, several states — including Mas
sachusetts, Delawareand Maryland — observe
Jan. 15 as a state holiday.
Gov't workers guilty of bribery
Washington — Evidence of corruption in the
General Services Administration mounted yes
terday as 11 persons agreed to plead guilty
here to bribery and conspiracy charges in a
scandal that has spread to 15 states and
Washington, D.C.
The plea agreements involve $415,000 in
fraud against the government and $120,000 in
bribes and kickbacks to federal workers.
They bring to 119 the number of indictments
nationwide against contractors and govern
ment employees, most of whom work for the
GSA — the government's Office Supply and
Building Maintenance agency.
The latest indication of corruption in the
huge agency came Monday when a GSA draft
audit was revealed showing that the agency
spent $500,000 for office space it never used in
a New York City building. Sources said that
audit and similar ones, details of which they
did not reveal, were evidence of continuing
mismanagement in the agency.
The GSA, which operates 10,000 properties
owned or leased by the government nation
wide, has been under investigation since 1977.
Its administrator, Rowland Freeman, is now
involved in a dispute over his efforts to remove
William Clinkscales from his job as deputy in
spector general.
In the latest plea agreements, Assistant U.S.
Attorney William Block filed criminal informa
tions outlining the charges against seven cur
rent and former GSA employees, a former
State Department employee and three con
tractors who did business with the GSA.
Criminal informations are legal papers filed
when defendants waive possible grand jury
indictments and agree to plead guilty. The new
plea agreements all involve fraud in the na
tion's capital.
Block said the contractors will admit in court
that they negotiated contracts worth more
than $850,000, with more than $415,000 ob
tained through fraudulent billings. The gov
ernment employees will admit receiving at
least $120,000 in kickbacks and bribes, he said.
Court vindicates parole officer
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday
told the father of a slain teenage girl he cannot
sue the parole officials who released his
daughter's murderer, a convicted sex offen
der.
Voting unanimously in a case from Califor-

nia, the justices ruled that states may give
parole officials absolute immunity from being
sued because of their parole decisions.
Laws granting such immunity do not violate
an individual's constitutional rights, the court
said in upholding state court rulings.
George Martinez of San Diego tried to sue
for $2 million after the 1975 kidnapping and
murder of his 15-year-old daughter, Mary El
len, by a man paroled five months earlier.
Martinez charged that state parole officials
had abused their duty when they paroled
Richard Thomas, designated as a medically
disordered sex offender not amenable to
treatment.
Thomas had been sentenced to prison for six
months to 20 years for trying to rape two young
girls in the same San Diego neighborhood
from which Mary Ellen Martinez was abducted.
Thomas' sentencing judge recommended
that he not be paroled, but Thomas was re
leased March 10,1975, after serving five years.
The Martinez murder occurred Aug. 1, 1975.
The dismissed lawsuit contended that the
granting of Thomas' parole was negligent, re
ckless and malicious.
In another significant constitutional deci
sion yesterday, the court said that before
stripping any person of U.S. citizenship, the
government must prove that person inten
tionally renounced citizenship.
The court thus rejected State Department
contentions that it need only prove the com
mission of some voluntary act of expatriation,
such as pledging allegiance to a foreign nation,
before taking away U.S. citizenship.
The ruling, however, did not resolve the
controversy which carried the expatriation
issue to the nation's highest court.
Laurence Terrazas was born in Takoma
Park, Mo., in 1947. His father was a citizen of
Mexico and his mother a U.S. citizen — mak
ing him a citizen of both countries at birth.
While a student in Monterey, Mexico, in
1970, Terrazas claims he was told by a school
official that he needed to sign a certificate of
Mexican nationality before receiving a dip
loma.
The certificate he signed renounced his U.S.
citizenship, but the young man later said he
had no idea that his signing would have such
an effect.
Terrazas sued to regain his citizenship.
Chappaquiddick story refuted
