# Maintenance fights mice
## 
### Andrea James 
Maintenance personnel are setting
traps in Lagunita and Florence Moore
halls in an effort to curb the growing
problem here with field mice.
"We can usually respond quickly
to any problems with mice in any of
the halls here on campus," said Terry
McCovern, housing facilities man
ager.
But he said his office and pest con
trol workers have run into some re
sistance from animal-loving stu
dents.
"Some students just don't like to
hear a trap shut and know an animal
was just killed," he said. "They seem
to want us to work magic."
Maintenance workers are also try
ing to attack the problem at its source
by laying baits and glue boards
(pieces of wood covered with a non
poisonous sticky substance that
doesn't harm mice during the cap
ture) in dorm basements and storage
rooms.
McCiovern said the rodent prob
lem has been bad this year.
"This seems to be the year for the
overpopulation cycle, and this com
bined with the excessively wet
weather has brought the mice out
of the fields and uito the dorms
where they eat anything they can get
hold of."
He said the rodent problem began
in October and has been growing
worse all year. Clothing and towels
have been ruined by the gnawing ro
dents, and students have found
mouse droppings in their desk draw
ers.
One student said his roommate
was awakened by a mouse crawling

across his arm in the middle of the
night.
Some residents are successfully
ridding their rooms of the pests by
simply throwing away uncovered
food or by wrapping steel wool
around the room radiators.
One dorm has encouraged its re
sidents to place traps by offering a
bounty of one beer per mouse
caught.
Students who want maintenance
personnel to lay the traps should call
that department at 497-3293 anytime
from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., McGovern
said. Escondido Village residents
should call 497-1191.
