# Med School VP search continues

A University search committee has
"passed on some names" to Presi
dent Richard Lyman of candidates for
the post of vice president for medical
affairs, according to committee
chairman Dr. Thomas Merigan.
Dr. Clayton Rich vacated the post
last January, after serving as dean of
the medical school and vice presi
dent for seven years.
The committee is seeking some
one to fill only the vice president's
slot; the search for a dean will begin
after the vice president is selected.
"To date, the committee has re
ceived hundreds of recommenda
tions, but this type of search is
shrouded by an element of confiden
tiality," admitted Bob Beyers, direc
tor of the University News Service.
He cited the recent situation at the
University of Southern California
where controversial publicity over
possible candidates resulted in the
decision not to hire three possible
candidates for the office of university
president.
The committee interviewed six
candidates for the vice presidency
before submitting its recommenda
tions to Lyman. Interviews are con
tinuing for the position.
At this time, Merigan, professor of
infectious diseases here, said he
does not know exactly when the final
decision will be made. The commit
tee is "very desirous of filling the
position before another academic
year," he said.
The year-long search for a re
placement has been conducted na
tionally. As stated by Lyman in
November 1978, the committee was
asked to "search for a vice-president
of medical affairs at a time when it is
increasingly clear that the incumbent
will have different responsibilities
from the last two holders." Previ
ously, both positions were held by
one administrator.
This type ot search is unusually

complicated, especially in the medi
cal field. "Nationally, a lot of diffe
rent interests come into play," said
Beyers. "Relationships with the fed
eral government, changing federal
funding patterns affecting grants,
emphasis on research, patient care
and administering a faculty of 300
which accounts for one-third of the
faculty here," are all factors cited by
Beyers.
The application pool is chosen
after "a fairly substantial advertising
program" and the receipt of letters
nominating candidates, said Robert
Hamrdla, assistant to the president
on trustee affairs.
The candidates are screened by
the committee, some visit the cam
pus and the final decision is made by
the president from a list compiled by
the search committee.
Merigan clarified the committee's
function as "providing suggestions
and opinions to the administration."
Although the president is currently
reviewing some candidates, "the

committee will carry on more discus
sion and consider other candidates
on a continuing basis, said Merigan.
"It all depends on the results of
negotiations with the people under
consideration," he added.
Once the decision has been made,
a second search tor a permanent
dean of the medical school will be
conducted. The two searches were
not conducted simultaneously be
cause the new vice-president "needs
to have some input" in the choice of
the dean, explained Hamrdla.
Currently, Dr. Lawrence Crowley
is the acting dean and vice-president.
Crowley was professor of surgery at
Stanford from 1964 to 1974. He be
came dean of the University of Wis
consin Medical School in Madison in
1974 but returned to Stanford in 1977
as the deputy dean of the medical
school.
Members of his staff said they did
not know whether he is a candidate
to fill the vice-presidency perma
nently.
