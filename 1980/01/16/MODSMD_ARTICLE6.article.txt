# Decision delayed on lighted tennis courts
## 
### Grant Finlayson 
The Athletic Department has de
cided to provide more tennis
facilities, but the decision whether to
light existing courts or build addi
tional ones has been postponed
pending assessment of the budget,
said Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Geiger presented the two alterna
tives to the Committee of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation
(CAPER) Monday night. After discus
sion, the committee voted to post
pone its decision until after the Ath
letic Department's current budget
analysis is completed.
Funding
The department is assessing the
balance of the '79-' BO budget, and a
funding freeze has been imposed on
all projects, according to Assistant
Athletic Director Bob Young. If the
budget is inadequate, funds will have
to be requested from the University,
drawn from the department's re
serves, orsupplied by gift money, he
said.
Installing lights in the six Enema
courts would be less expensive than
constructing four new courts, which
would go in near the Shell station on
Campus Drive, CAPER chairman
Gerald Lieberman said. Geiger said
he is inclined to build more courts
because they could afford usage dur
ing the high-demand afternoon

hours.
"Providing more tennis-playing
opportunity is a very high priority for
us right now," Geiger said, "so we
will try to get it done as soon as pos
sible — hopefully before the end of
the year." He added, however, that
should they opt for new courts, con
struction would take longer.
Disappointment
ASSU Sen. Ron Johnson, who was
partly responsible for placing the
tennis court lights referendum on
the fall ASSU election ballot, said he
was pleased that CAPER has made a
positive move toward action, but
also expressed disappointment at
the further delay.
Johnson, a senior, was a member
of last year's senate task force as
signed to study the need for lighted
tennis courts. Based on its study, the
task force proposed light installation
to CAPER last spring.
CAPER has been discussing the
proposal since then and an antici
pated decision in last November's
meeting was again postponed when
Geiger was unable to attend.
The extra month's delay "looks
like it could make the difference be
tween having or not having the
courts spring quarter," Johnson said.
The next CAPER meeting is
scheduled for Feb. 26.
