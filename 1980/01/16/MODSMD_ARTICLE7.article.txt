# Ambassador speaks on OAS policy, praises president as 'good neighbor'

)immy Carter is the first American
president to actually adhere to the
"good neighbor policy" in Latin
America that he advocated in his
maiden address, said Gale McCee,
United States Ambassador to the Or
ganization of American States (OAS),
here Monday night.
All American presidents have men
tioned the "good neighbor policy" in
their maiden addresses and then
neglected any further actions, he
said.
McCee added that he believed
"none sincerely meant to welch on
their promises" but were involved
with other global problems.
Carter, McCee said, has worked
more with the OAS and maintained a
more constant link between the Un
ited States and Latin America than all
the past presidents combined. He
noted that Carter personally had
travelled extensively throughout
Latin America.
"Latin America has been impres
sed," McGee said. "Their fears of (a
United States) temporary involve
ment have been lessened."
The OAS, begun in 1890, is the
oldest international organization of
its kind. Comprised of countries in
the western hemisphere, its goals in
clude strengthening peace and sec
urity on the two American conti
nents. It seeks to solve political,
economic and social problems and
to promote cultural development.
Technological sophistications and
industrial diversifications have quad
rupled Latin American economic
productivity in the past two decades,
McGee said.
For Latin America, economic de
velopment is the No. 1 priority. "The
OAS does not send massive aid (to
Latin America) but introduces pilot
projects and experimental develo
ments that are then later funded by

proper aid groups," he said.
Latin American nations have thus
made great advances since the Ken
nedy years, McCee said. Two-thirds
of her peoples now live in cities.
Ninety percent of the people own
radios and 40 percent own televi
sions. Women have gained in educa
tion and in the labor market.
But peacekeeping is the United
States' first priority, McGee said. It
utilizes the OAS to implement its
peacekeeping efforts, "so the Latin
Americans don't think the 'big guy'
alone is enforcing pressures." The
United States, through the OAS, has
sought to introduce human rights
commissions and courts to the
Americas.
In recent years the Vatican, the
only non-American entity, has been

added to the OAS membership list as
an observer government. The Pope is
a respected symbol of pacification.
As many of the Latin nations are
Catholic, the Pope helps to form a
common bond among them, McGee
said.
Vet Latin American countries re
main suspicious of involvement in
global problems, McGee said.
In our hemisphere, he said, it is still
possible to isolate quarrels from the
rest of the world. The Latins prefer
such separatism, which has been ef
fectively employed by the OAS.
McGee said that he was aware that
little OAS news reaches the public.
"You don't hear about it because it
succeeds (in its peacekeeping ef
forts)."
