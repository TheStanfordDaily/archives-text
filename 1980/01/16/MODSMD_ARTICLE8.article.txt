## PLO faces uncertain political future 
### 
The Washington Post
Beirutâ€” The Soviet Invasion
of Afghanistan has capped a
series of crises undermining
the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization's once-promising
diplomatic offensive to win re
spectibility, stature and influ
ence in the West.
With the Soviets' Afghan in
tervention angering much of
the Third World, especially Is
lamic countries, the PLO feels
deprived of its normally effec
tive Soviet leverage to
counter-balance American in
fluence in the Middle East.
Also contributing to PLO
worries have been the effect of
the U.S. Embassy crises in
Tehran involving its controver
sial ally Iran and the embarras
sing public quarrel with Libyan
leader Muammar Khadafy.
Discussions with PLO insid
ers here reflect disappoint
ment and the realization that
the diplomatic offensive at best
js marooned during the Ameri
can presidential election year.
The PLO's strategy last year

was designed to avoid just that
quadrennial pitfall, which Is
rael over the years has so skill
fully exploited to justify the
Middle East status quo.
Brandishing the implied
threat of a Middle East oil em
bargo was a never stated, but
nonetheless real, vehicle for
the offensive in favor of a
negotiated Middle East settle
ment.
Last summer and fall PLO
leader Yasser Arafat was re
ceived by officials and some
heads of government in West
ern Europe in a strikingly effec
tive demonstration of the new
diplomatic approaches.
But now one PLO analyst has
been reduced to arguing pri
vately, and without much con
viction, that "we can only hope
the Soviets will get out of Af
ghanistan as fast as possible."
He said his greatest fear was
that "we are now basically de
fenseless before unfettered
American force in the Middle
East."
"Egypt is out of the military

equation, and Israel is stronger
militarily than ever before,"
another PLO analyst lamented.
Paradoxically, it is basically
the conservative Arabs of the
oil-rich Arabian Peninsula who
question this gloomy analysis
of the confrontation state. Jor
dan, Syria and the PLO have
either remained silent or ex
pressed understanding, if not
approval, for the Kremlin's ac
tion.
'Contagion'
Fearful of the contagion
wafted westward across the
Persian Gulf from Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic
revolution in Iran, these con
servative governments fear
that the United States is no
longer a reliable ally.
While the PLO privately in
sists it is bogged down, the
conservatives publicly claim
the only way to save their own
and Western interests is
through American pressure on
Israel to bring about a Palesti
nian state in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip.

What today is denounced as
Soviet aggression against a fel
low Islamic country in Af
ghanistan, they fear, could to
morrow be hailed as an effec
tive, if brutal, means of achiev
ing the Kremlin's aim and the
Palestinians' longing for a
homeland.
Radicals opposed
Palestinian moderates,
hopeful that the diplomatic of
fensive would pay off now, re
gretfully note that both Israel
and Palestinian radicals op
posed to any negotiated set
tlement are never happier than
during periods of U.S.-Soviet
tensions.
Radical guerrilla groups such
as George Habash's Popular
Front for Liberation of Pales
tine and Nayef Hawatmeh's
Popular Democratic Front en
dorsed the recent Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan in a calcu
lated effort to force an embar
rassed Arafat to stop sitting on
the fence and follow suit.
Their open siding with
Khadafy in his continued pub
lic criticism of the PLO's dip
lomatic offensive also has em
barrassed Arafat.
Fatah, Arafat's power base
representing about 80 percent
of the Palestinian guerrilla
movement, is reassessing its
moderate policy. Some
analysts feel it may indeed back
the Soviets, but in the vaguest
possible fashion.
