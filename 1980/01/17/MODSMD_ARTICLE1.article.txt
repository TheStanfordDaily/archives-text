### Mike Vaska 
Baseball's greatest home-run
hitter, Henry Aaron, discussed the
role of sports in America and the
world and answered questions on
baseball's history before a sparse
crowd in Kresge Auditorium last
night.
Criticizing those who demand
the U.S. boycott of the Moscow
Summer Olympic Games, he said
that "athletic competition should
not be used for political purposes."
Although sports were originally
established to bring peoples to
gether, they "will only serve to
further divide them" it things con
tinue as they have for the past
several years, Aaron said.
"Someone has taken the tun
out (of amateur sports) and put
politics in," he said. In our drive
to attain excellence, we "have al
most killed off amateur athletics,"
he added.
Turning to the politics of col
legiate sports, Aaron said "too
many universities spend too
much time trying to be number
one with outstanding athletes
rather than with outstanding stu
dents.
"The role ot Stanford University
should not be to turn men into
athletic machines," he con
tinued.

He compared collegiate athle
tics to a "sports merry-go-round"
where universities pursue televi
sion and alumni money to build
winning programs. To maintain
winning traditions, they must
continue to seek revenue and
thus they "cannot get off," he
said.
Pressures from alumni, stu
dents and newspapers in addition
to the use of computers, polls and
recruiting have caused college
sports to stray from the notion of
amateur competition, he said.
He also said that college sports
seasons need to be shortened to
allow student athletes to concen
trate more on being students, he
said.
Aaron said he sees no reason
why temales should not play pro
fessional sports. He also expres
sed uncertainty as to why there
are no no black managers or
coaches in professional baseball
or football.
Although he has been offered a
manager's position, which he de
clined, he said he feels there are
several other black former
athletes who are capable ot man
aging a team who have not re
ceived similar invitations.
Aaron, 16 times an allstar and
the most valuable player in 1957,

also spoke about his baseball
career in both his speech and in a
question and answer period that
followed.
He called his 715 th home run
hit, which broke Babe Ruth's re
cord, the "greatest event in
sport." Wishing to finish the rest
of the inning in the outfield, he
put then-President Richard Nixon
"on hold" until the inning ended,
when he called to congratulate
Aaron immediately after the re
cord breaking event. Aaron said
Nixon invited him to have dinner
at the White House, but he never
went because the Watergate
scandal intervened.
In answer to questions, Aaron
said he felt no pressure to hit his
715 th ball out ot the park and that
once it was hit, "it felt like it was
going over the fence."
He called Candlestick Park in
San Francisco the "toughest park
to hit in" and said he hoped
someone would break his record,
because he believes that "records
are made to be broken."
Regarding baseball's past, he
(laimed that the 1957 Braves were
the best team ever in baseball his
tory and named himself, Willy Mays
and Roberto Clemente for an all-star
outfield.


Hank Aaron, who c urrently holds the record for the most career home runs, spoke on a variety of subjects to a small
audience in Kresge Auditorium last night.
