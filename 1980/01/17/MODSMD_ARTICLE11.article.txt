CIR lives on
In case some historian of the
future uses "Stanford in the
19705" {Daily, Nov. 29) as a
source, the writer ought to be
advised that the trustees' ad
hoc Commission on Invest
ment Responsibility was not
the same thing as the CIR, al
though one might be forgiven
for supposing so.
The ad hoc Commission first
met on Aug. 3,1977 and dissol
ved on presentation of its re
port dated Nov. 15, 1977. The
CIR had existed for some years
before and, after the ad hoc
Commission made its report,
was reconstituted and lives on
today.
It would not be correct to say
that "In the fall SCRIP recom
mended that the CIR be ex
panded to include two
employees, one trustee and
one administrator" because it
was the ad hoc Commission

that introduced the formula of
two regular staff, one trustee
and one administrator (in addi
tion to three members of the
Academic Council, three stu
dents and three alumni).
When the trustees adopted
guidelines for the new CIR,
Anne Henkelswas reported as
saying that they would "totally
subordinate social responsibil
ity to the maximization of pro
fit" and would be "most defi
nitely a method for pigeon
holing criticism" on University
investment policy but I am not
sure she did say that.
It is true that the ASSU re
fused to nominate the three
students to work with the fa
culty, other staff and alumni
but probably not out of any be
lief that criticism would be
pigeon-holed; obviously criti
cism would have been just as
free as the part of ASSU ap
pointees as it was on the part of

the students who did fill the
vacuum that the ASSU created.
The variety of dissenting
opinions reported at ASSU de
bates (e.g. Daily, Nov. 30,1977)
suggests that the ASSU may
have had trouble getting its act
together. In any case, the CIR
has functioned very well as a
pipeline from the community
to the trustees and the fears
reported did not materialize.

The Palo Alto Area Chapter of
the American Red Cross, on
behalf of International Red
Cross Services, wishes to ex
press its deep appreciation to
the Stanford community for its
generous contributions for
Cambodian relief.
The joint efforts of Red
Cross, UNICEF and other relief

agencies have now begun to
ameliorate the terrible situa
tion. The Stanford community
should take great pride in its
splendid participation in this
great humanitarian effort.
