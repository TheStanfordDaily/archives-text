## Ernest Conine Afghan crisis worries Yugoslavia 
### 
Of all the reactions to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
none were more predictable
than the harsh, unambiguous
criticism leveled by Com
munist Yugoslavia.
And for good reason. The
Yugoslavs know that they
could be next.
The newspaper Borba, the
official voice of the Tito re
gime, has ridiculed Russia's
statement that its massive
military intervention in Af
ghanistan was undertaken in
response to the Kabul govern
ment's appeal for help against
an outside threat.
The Soviet move, the paper
said in a bluntly worded edito
rial that presumably reflected
President Tito's own view, was
"unacceptable, unjust, unde
mocratic and very dangerous

to peace."
What bothers the Yugoslavs,
and what ought to worry West
ern governments, is that the
Soviet justification for inter
vening in Afghanistan sounds
very much like the rationale
used forsending Russian tanks
into Prague in 1968 to crush
Czechoslovakia's experiment
with a more humane, more
democratic form of com
munism.
In Czechoslovakia, the
Soviet armed forces entered at
the invitation of supposedly
genuine Communists who
were supposedly trying to de
fend "socialism" against im
perialist machinations.
In Czechoslovakia, as in Af
ghanistan, Russian forces
threw out an existing Marxist
government and installed one
to the Kremlin's liking.
Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, in a statement that
came to be known in the West
as the Brezhnev Doctrine, ar
gued in 1968 that the Soviet
Union has the right to inter
vene to prevent any "socialist"
government from departing
from the correct path as de
fined by Moscow.
Western political leaders
have wanted to believe that the
Brezhnev Doctrine was a one
shot rationale dreamed up sol
ely to justify Russian interven
tion in Czechoslovakia, and
should not be seen as a guide
to future Soviet intentions
elsewhere.
The Yugoslavs have been far
less sanguine, for the obvious
reason that the Brezhnev Doc
trine could be so conveniently
turned against them.
For most of the last 30 years,
Yugoslavia has been on the
outs with the Soviet Union be
cause of Tito's outspoken de
termination to keep his coun
try independent.
Except for its bizarre
neighbor, Albania — which
manages to be simultaneously
anti-Soviet, anti-Chinese and
anti-Western — Yugoslavia is
the only Communist country in
Eastern Europe that does not
belong to the Soviet
dominated Warsaw Pact.
Worse still, from Moscow's
viewpoint, Yugoslavia has
steadfastly encouraged other
Communist parties to do their
own thing, too, on grounds
that every Communist country
and every foreign Communist
party has the right to develop
its own form of socialism rather
than to slavishly copy the
rather horrid Russian model.
The Czechoslovaks who
tried to create a new "com
munism with a human face"
got a great deal of their inspira
tion from Yugoslavia. The
Yugoslavs make no secret,
either, of their sympathy for
the independent stance taken

by the Italian, Spanish and
other "Euro-Communist" par
ties.
Finally, Tito has irritated the
Russians by counseling Third
World nations against too
close an association with the
Soviet Union or its faithful ser
vant, Cuba.
It is taken for granted that
the Soviet Union would dearly
love to put the uppity Yugos
lavs in their place. The most
likely time for them to take a
stab at it — after being "in
vited" in by some pro-Soviet
element, no matter how small
— is when Tito passes from the
scene.
Because Tito is 87 and suffer
ing from liver and circulatory
problems — American heart
surgeon Michael Deßakey
treated him just last week —
that means that the danger may
come at any time.
The conventional wisdom is
that the Russians won't launch
a military invasion of Yugos
lavia, but will try to regain con
trol of its one-time satellite
through subversion, by en
couraging and exploiting
jealousies and conflicts among
the various ethnic groups that
make up the country.
One reason for this conclu
sion is the 100 percent certainty
that the Yugoslav people
would fight just as ferociously
against Russian invaders now
— "invited" or not — as they
did against German invaders
during World War 11.
Another reason has been the
conviction that the Soviet
Union knows full well that, by
forcibly occupying Yugoslavia,
it might threaten the balance of
power in Europe beyond the
bounds of Western toleration.
Neither the United States
nor the western alliance as a
whole has any treaty obligation
to come to Yugoslavia's de
fense in the event of an inva

sion, but the NATO countries
have been careful not to rule
out the possibility that they
would.
Thus Yugoslavia is one of the
places on this earth where a
Russian mistake in judgment
could all too easily trigger a
chain of events that might end
in World War 111. That is a chil
ling thought for Westerners —
and, to the degree that they
take it seriously, it must be chil
ling for the Soviets.
If the day ever comes when
the Soviet leaders don't take
the dangers of invading Yugos
lavia seriously, however, this
will suddenly become a very
dangerous world not just for
the Yugoslavs but for the rest
of us also.
It is within this context,
among others, that the Russian
adventure in Afghanistan is
deeply disturbing.
The Soviet move de
monstrates that the Brezhnev
Doctrine, or at least the men
tality that it reflected,'is alive
and well in Moscow. It also
demonstrates that, in an era
when the military balance has
been tilting toward the Soviet
Union, the Kremlin leaders
may be willing to use military
force more boldly, and with far
less regard for Western sen
sibilities, than the conven
tional wisdom had led us to be
lieve.
The Yugoslavs know in their
bones that, when President
Carter tries to shock Brezhnev
& Co. into realizing that they
cannot behave as they have
been doing in Afghanistan
without running grave risks, he
is fighting their battle. It re
mains to be seen whether the
Western Europeans, who are
being asked to help the United
States in the effort, realize it,
too.
