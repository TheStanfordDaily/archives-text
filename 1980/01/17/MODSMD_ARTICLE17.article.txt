# New program offered
## Reading a little faster 
### Kimberly Brown 
It has been recommended that University
students read a minimum of one million
words every week, but for most students, it is
a virtually unattainable task. Sunday night
creeps on, and suddenly, students find
themselves in a dimmed Meyer, contemplat
ing the 550 pages yet to go.
To help solve this problem the ASSU Publi
cations Board is offering the Institute of Read
ing Development (IRD) speed reading and
comprehension training program here this
quarter.
lack Trumpbour, chairman of the ASSU
Pub Board said, "From the rave reviews it has
received at other campuses, this program
should be a substantial aid to Stanford stu
dents interested in improving their reading
skills."
The course professes to increase reading
speed by 100 to 400 percent, comprehension
by 33 percent and vocabulary by 30 percent.
Even if sufficient time is available to cover
the week's pages at a "normal" reading rate,
a significant amount of information is lost in
the process, Trumpbour said.
Comprehension training should enable a
reader to absorb and retain substantially
more material. The course stresses that the
ability to understand, as well as to recall from
memory both technical and general informa
tion, is the key to academic success.
The program is divided into three areas of
concentration. The first, speed reading,

deals with obtaining faster, smoother read
ing skills while varying speed to fit the mate
rial. Ways to focus attention as well as to
sustain reading for long periods of time are
also covered.
The second portion, comprehension train
ing, presents ways to preview, survey and
retain material. The third section focuses on
methods of avoiding fatigue and eyestrain.
The IRD program is used by more than 100
leading universities and corporations. In
1975, the University of Southern California
compared four private reading organizations
in the Los Angeles area. The students were
tested before and after a reading program in
speed, comprehension and vocabulary using
nationally standardized reading tests. The
IRD system was unequivocally proven to be
the best and most effective.
"Publications Board inquiries into the re
sults of the IRD programs at the University of
California convinced us that Stanford stu
dents were missing out on a great opportun
ity to improve their reading skills,"
Trumpbour said.
The program meets on campus once a
week for six weeks, Wednesday evenings
from 7 to 10 beginning Feb. 6.
Tuition is $145, a $185 discount from the
commercial rate of $325. This fee includes all
materials used in the course, and lifetime
repeat privileges at all IRD offices in Califor
nia. Enrollment will be conducted in White
Plaza between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
