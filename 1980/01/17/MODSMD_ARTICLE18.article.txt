# CIA may get more power

Washington (AP) — Key re
strictions on covert U.S. Intel
ligence activities, imposed by
Congress becaus of Central In
telligence Agency abuses, are
almost certain to be relaxed
significantly by Congress this
year in response to Soviet ac
tivities in Afghanistan and
elsewhere.
Administration and congres
sional sources said last week
that efforts would begin within
a few weeks to pass a much
discussed, comprehensive
charter for the CIA, which
would both relax those restric
tions and also make the CIA
more accountable under the
law for higher standards of be
havior than in the past.
But intelligence experts be
lieve Congress, responding 1o
the crisis during a short
election-year session, will
delay action on the complex
legal issues in the proposed
charter while ending key re
straints.
The result would be that U.S.
intelligence agencies, while
continuing to be subject to
congressional oversight and a
presidential executive order
that bans many of the most
glaring past abuses, would
have substantially more license
to mount secret operations.
Critics fear that such license
might lead to new controver
sies, but others believe the re
strictions have hamstrung
American policy options for

five years.
Three specific measures —
the so-called "sweeteners" in
the overall intelligence reform
proposals — are expected to
pass:
— Repeal of the Hughes-
Ryan amendment of 1974,
which requires the CIA to re
port covert activities to a total
of eight congressional commit
tees, consisting of over 150
senators and representatives
and their staffs. Leaks and the
possibility of leaks have effec
tively vetoed some secret pro
jects, sources said.
The repeal would mean that
covert activities would be re
ported only to the Senate and
House Intelligence commit
tees, whose track record for
keeping secrets is said to have
impressed President Carter.
— Significant changes in the
Freedom of Information Act to
end what critics see as
"grotesque" abuses. The law,
for example, could allow
enemy intelligence agents to
request and receive critical file
data from the CIA and Federal
Bureau of Investigation at tax
payers expense.
One effect of the act is that
the CIA spent 116 man-years fil
ling Freedom of Information
requests, more manpower
than it spends "on any one of
several areas of key intelli
gence interest," its officials
have said publicly.

— Legislation to curtail the
so-called "Agee abuses,"
named for Phillip Agee, a
former CIA employee who
publishes the names of CIA
agents serving secretly abroad
in his "Covert Action Bulletin."
The lives as well as missions of
the agent are thereby en
dangered, specialists argue.
