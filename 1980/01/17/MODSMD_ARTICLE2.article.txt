# Hargadon: no admissions based solely on SATs
## Deans blast Nader test report 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Ralph Nader's study of the Educa
tional Testing Service (ETS) and its
effect on admissions evoked criti
cism from three Stanford deans of
admission yesterday.
Nader's report, a 550-page docu
ment called The Reign of ETS: The
Corporation J hut Makes Up Minds,
was released Tuesday. The report
calls ETS, better know as the supplier
of exams such as the Scholastic Ap
titude Test (SAT), the law School
Admission Test (LSAT) and others â€”
a "consumer fraud.''
Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don called Nader "willfully ignorant"
about the use of the test scores in
college admissions. Hargadon, who
serves as chairman of the College En
trance Examination Board (CEEB),
said yesterday that, "we look at the
total package of an applicant," and
that he knows of no college using ETS
test scores alone to determine ad
missions.
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman of
Law School admissions, and the as
sistant dean for admissions at the
Graduate School of Buisness, Lawr
ence Lieberman, concurred with
Hargadon s views. "Our own obser
vations with respect to the LSAT sim
ply contradict Nader's basic asser
tions," Friedenthal said yesterday.
The Nader investigation is highligh
ted by statements claiming that 90
percent of the time, the tests predict
first-year grades with less accuracy
than a roll of dice, and that previous
grades alone predict future
achievement twice as accurately as

ETS tests. The study, authored by
Allan Nairn, claims that ETS tests
exclude a disproportionate number
ot minorities from gaining admis
sions and that scores correlate di
rectly with income.
Bootstraps pull
"My own view," Friedenthal as
serted, "is that the test, when used
properly and taken in proper con
text, can be a way for certain people
from lesser schools, who are pulling
themselves up by the bootstraps, to
have a chance." Otherwise, Frie
denthal contended, students from
schools such as Stanford, Harvard
and Princeton would probably fill
each law school class.
All three deans of admission ques
tioned why the Nader group did not
contact their offices in preparing the
report.
The ETS, which has come under
increasing attack from minority
groups and the national Parent-
Teachers Association (PTA), was
created in 1948 by the American
Council on Education, the Carnegie
Foundation and the CEFB. The com
pany was intended tor use as a non
profit test developer. Today, ETS
runs more than 300 testing programs,
grosses $80,000,000 each year in un
taxed income and holds $25,000,000
in assets, according to a survey that
appeared in The Village Voice. In
1978, ETS netted a $1 million proft,
the Voice also reported.
Roulette game
According to Nader, more than
two million American students take
the service's tests each year. Nader

compared the tests to a "roulette
game" and said the tests "don't mea
sure judgment, wisdom, experience,
creativity, stamina (or) determina
tion."
Hargadon said Tuesday, "Other
parts of the college application do try
to get at these characteristics. Many
colleges have students submit
portfolios ot art, provide examples of
creative writing, or audition in
music, for example." Hargadon ad
ded, "He's (Nader) done no
homework on how the test scores
are used."
Lieberman said the Business
School has at times rejected applic
ants with scores of 800 on their busi
ness boards and that academic con
fidence and the type of potential evi
denced by previous work is
paramount. "I am also not overly im
pressed with Mr. Nader's research,"
lieberman noted. "No one here was
contacted."
