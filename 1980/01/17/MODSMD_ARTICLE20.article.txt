# Blacker discusses world situation
## American foreign policy shifting 
### Jiri Weiss 
American foreign policy may
be undergoing a profound
shift comparable to the shift
from isolationism to active in
ternationalism in the late
1940 s, according to Coit
Blacker, the associate director
of the Arms Control and Dis
armament Program here.
Blacker, who together with
program director John Lewis
teaches the Arms Control and
Disarmament course this quar
ter, is worried about the future
of arms control.
"The tragedy of the Afghan
crisis, beyond its immediate ef
fects, will allow those people
who have been saying that the
Soviet Union is bent toward
world domination point to the
invasion as proof of their ar
gument,"Blacker said. "They
will argue that the United
States has fallen dangerously
behind in strategic as well as
conventional weapons."
Blacker now talks about the
Strategic Arms Limitation Tre
aty (SALT II) in the past tense.
But he still hopes that the treaty
will pass after a Senate debate
which is not likely to resume
until January of next year.
"Any discussion of arms con
trol will fall by the wayside," he
said. "The perception is going
to be that any arms control is
giving in to the Russians." But
Blacker thinks that this attitude
is not justified.
"If we had the SALT II treaty
through two years ago and it
had been ratified we would be
in a better position to control
some significant develop
ments and trends in Soviet de
fense planning and spending.
Without the treaty we are
going to find it difficult to con
strain the Soviets."

The shift in American policy,
although provoked by the Af
ghanistan crisis, has been
gradual, according to Blacker.
The change has been happen
ing ever since the signing of
the SALT I agreement in 1972-
73 and Sen. Henry Jackson's
(D-Washington) charge that it
was asymmetrical.
"As soon as the Soviet Union
became a strategic equal of the
United States," said Blacker,
referring to the rapid growth
and modernization of the
Soviet nuclear arsenal,
"people started to get uncom
fortable.
"The shift in policy started in
earnest in 1975 when the Soviet
Union was involved in Angola,
when Soviet advisers and
Cuban troops started showing
up in Africa," Blacker con
tinued. "U.S. unhappiness
over Soviet behavior inten
sified when they became in
volved in Ethiopia and
switched sides from backing
Somalia, and with their high
profile in the Iranian crisis.
"The Afghanistan invasion will
be viewed as the action that
turned the tide and pulled the
president over"
President Carter, according
to Blacker, "has undergone a
conversion.
"The most astounding thing
I have heard is the statement
that Carter has made where he
said that his views of the Soviet
Union have changed more in
the last 10 days then in the pre
vious three years," he com
mented.
According to Blacker, "We
have passed through the
post-Vietnam syndrome where
we have felt that Ameican

forces have been used where
they should not have been and
that the use of American power
has been too great over the
past 25 years. It is conceivable
that this phase is completely
behind us now and we are
moving into a new one."
Blacker sees a danger in the
shift of policy. Some politi
cians, in an attempt to show
their "toughness" with the
Russians, have started talking
about the same "containment"
policy that was used in the
1940 s.
"Everyone is talking about
the renewal of containment.
That is a fundamental misper
ception. In 1946 it made sense
to talk about containing the
Soviet Union, plugging holes
everywhere around the
world."
"When people talk about
containment today, they are
missing a point. You are no
longer talking about the Soviet
Union of '46, a country that had
lost 20 million people and half
of its productive capacity. You
are talking about a superpower
with a strategic and conven
tional power equal to that of
the United States. You are not
going to be able to stop the
Soviet Union where you
choose."
What we must do, Blacker
says, is to "think through what
constitutesourvital security in
terests and define clearly when
we would move against the
Soviet Union because the risks
of war are much greater than
before."
It is preposterous to send aid
to Afghanistan as if this is going
to change the balance there
and make the Russians pull

out, according to Blacker.
"We simply do not have the
physical power," he says."The
risks of nuclear war would be
astounding."
Blacker is not opposed to aid
to Pakistan or other countries
threatened by the invasion but
he does object strongly to de
fining aid in terms of contain
ment.
"People talk about joining
with the Chinese to contain the
Soviet Union. This is ridicul
ous. The Chinese have nothing
to offer us in a military
sense. The rejection of
arms control and the SALT II
treaty that would have set ceil
ings on nuclear weapons is
going to change calculations of
defense planners. There is a
chance that the military budget
is going to increase even
beyond the current levels, ac
cording to Blacker.
Many people are going to
start talking again about build
ing Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
systems to protect our land
based Intercontinental Ballistic
missiles which are becoming
vulnerable with the deploy
ment of heavier and more ac
curate Soviet weapons that
have the theoretical capability
to knock them out.
The current plan to build a
mobile-based system for the
MX missile involving hundreds
of miles of track and shelters, is
likely to face opposition from
environmentalists and resi
dents of Utah, Nevada and
New Mexico who will be faced
with having this game of nuc
lear hide-and-seek in their
back yards. But the chances of
it being built have increased,
Blacker says.
