## Cambodia concert a sell-out Spirits, relief fund soar in Oakland 
### 
More than 14,000 people
packed the sold-out Oakland
Coliseum Arena Sunday night
for a Cambodian Emergency
Relief Fund benefit concert
featuring loan Baez, the Beach
Boys, jetterson Starship, Car
los Santana and The Grateful
Dead.
Emotion-filled performances
overcame sometimes-fuzzy
sound and lengthy intermis
sions to leave both the perfor
mers and the audience in high
spirits by the end.
Net proceeds from the con
cert and a post-concert recep
tion went to the Cambodian
Emergency Relief Fund, a Bay
Area effort to raise $1 million
for direct emergency food and
medical aid to Cambodian re
fugees in Thailand. Broadcast
live over radio station KMEL,
Sunday's show was one of a
series of such benefits which
includes lames Taylor, Linda
Ronstadt and Hoyt Axton.
loan Baez organized and
opened the show. Her soaring
voice and beautifully simple
acoustic guitar playing pro
vided the perfect introduction

for what followed. Baez is a
singer to whom people LIS
TEN, and for 25 minutes listen
ers were treated to newer
songs, old hits ("The Night
They Drove Old Dixie Down"),
stage banter and a pitch for the
relief fund. She left to ap
preciative applause, kissing
the Beach Boys as they came on
stage.
Awkward but mostly sincere,
the Beach Boys rocked and
cooed their way through an
hour of old ("California Girls")
and some newer ("Good Ti
min'") songs. Vacuous stage
commentary and fuzzy instru
mentals dampened audience
response. Even though the
Beach Boys left the people with
"Good Vibrations," the
crowd's energy had yet to be
really tapped.
Some have wondered how
good lefferson Starship would
be with three new members
and the loss of vocalist Grace
Slick. They were answered
with a tight, grinding rock 'n'
roll momentarily exploding
into wild instrumental solos.

This Starship rocketed for VA
hours, ending in heaven when
Carlos Santana joined the Star
ship's lead guitarist Craig
Chaquico in a stinging 15-min
ute guitar duel on "Some
body to Love." Although his
voice lacks rock 'n' roll power,
lead singer Mickey Thomas
didn't need Grace Slick to belt
out this one as the audience
sang along.
Clouds of cannabis smoke
ascended to the ceiling as pro
ducer Bill Graham announced
The Grateful Dead. Waiting
through the final set change,
the "Dead Heads" were very
noticeable in their distinctive
demeanor and garb. This
group of hard-core Grateful
Dead fans follows the band
everywhere on tour, and the
mellowness they exuded filled
the Arena. The Dead began to
walk shortly before midnight.
Leader )erry Garcia was smil
ing behind his full beard as The
Grateful Dead opened with
"We Can Share the Women
and We Can Share the Wine."
The crowd eagerly pushing to

the stage showed that the
band's time had come, each
avid fan caught up in a fervent
desire to fully experience the
music. Backs, tired from stand
ing the whole show, seated a
conspicuous few. Two hours of
Grateful Dead included such
hits as "Roll Away" and "Not
Fade Away." In typical Dead
style, the band wandered into
several improvisational breaks
dominated by the melodic
squeals of Garcia's lead guitar.
The crowd screamed when
Carlos Santana came on to lay
his fluid guitar magic over The
Dead's funky bluegrass in
sweet set-ending renditions of
"Sugar Magnolia" and "Sun
shine Daydream."
A brief, but noisy tew minutes
of foot-stomping and hand
clapping brought The Dead
back for an encore of "U.S.
Blues," with the Santana-
Garcia interplay carrying the
act to a rousing and approp
riate finish.
At the end all of the perfor
mers except the Beach Boys
gathered onstage to lead a final
audience sing-along. Applause
followed them downstairs to a
special reception, where a li
mited number of people were
able to meet and exchange a
few words with them. Joan
Baez sang "Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot" and then said that she
thought the concert had
brought the Cambodian
Emergency Relief Fund to its $1
million goal.
A feeling of goodwill was
evident among the perfor
mers. Producer Bill Graham
said, "That performers of such
talent got together and used
that talent and their drawing
power for a worthy cause â€”
that says something." Carlos
Santana said, "I was glad to
oe here. It felt good to play."
