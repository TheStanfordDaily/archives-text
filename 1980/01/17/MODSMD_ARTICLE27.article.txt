# Shaw's 'monumental egg'
## A 						dull and grim Mrs. Warren at CAT 
### 
George Bernard Shaw always
found it easier to pat himselt
on the back than to wait for the
public to do it for him. While
this was not a native trait, but
one he developed during many
lengthy waits, he did consider
himself the best thing that had
happened to English theater in
100 years.
In the preface to Mrs. War
ren's Profession, his third play,
Shaw began making large
claims for his work. He de
clared that his plays were "real
drama," as opposed to the
fashionable sentimental
dramas churned out by his
contemporaries, which he
likened to "opera without
music."
The preface was written in

1902, nine years after the play
was written and shortly after it
was first produced. This man
ifesto of "real drama" is, in
fact, Shaw's reply to his play's
reception. Mrs. Warren's Pro
fession had laid an egg of
monumental proportions. It
was panned from Dublin to
London and back again. The
public, rich and poor alike, ob
jected to it on moral grounds
(the play had been banned by
the Royal Censor eight years
before); the critics cried that it
was dull, grim and unrealistic.
Unfortunately, I agree with the
critics. "Unfortunately," be
cause this is all a long way of
saying that I don't see why a
company would produce Mrs.
Warren's Profession today,

especially a young company
like the California Actor's
Theatre which usually has the
sense to stick with younger
plays or jazz up the old ones (as
they did, quite sucessfully, to A
Midsummer Night's Dream last
September).
The play is about prostitu
tion, literal and figurative. Mrs.
Warren became a prostitute
because she couldn't face a life
ot drudgery; the rest ot the
characters have all prostituted
their humanity, in one way or
another, to accommodate
themselves to life. Shaw in
tended to show the British pub
lic that they had forced Mrs.
Warren's choice upon her;
that ,the fault was not hers, but
her environment's.

He may have succeeded U
though the critics missed tf
point). But then, the Britis
audience knew that environ
ment; we don't. The action
takes place in various middle
class milieus; the only glimp
ses we get of the environment
as antagonist are in Mrs. War
ren's reminescence. And
while, in the CAT production,
Kandis Chappell does an excel
lent job of bringing Mrs. War
ren to life, it would be beyond
anyone to do the same for her
past betore a modern audi
ence.
Catherine Butterfield, who
plays Mrs. Warren's daughter,
Vivie, has an even harder task.
Vivie is a thoroughly modern
young woman, tough, smart,
independent and about to em
bark on a career as an actuary.
She has never known her
mother, and has no idea how
her Newnham College educa
tion has been paid for. She ac
cepts the fact of her mother's
early fall, but hardens again
when she discovers that her
mother is still involved in pros
titution, now as a madam. Her
modern morality can forgive a
woman's desperate turn to
prostitution, but abhors that
woman when she exploits
others in the same position.
The problem is that Vivie
triumphs morally at the ex
pense of emotion. She is a cold
fish; not interested in love and
romance, she hopes never to

have a holiday from her actuarial
figures. She can resist the
temptation of her mother's
money because she is hard
enough not to want the things
her mother couldn't do with
out.
It this side of Vivie's charac
ter is emphasized, the play can
still have a powerful effect.
Butterfield plays this down,
however, making Vivie more
human than she should (espe
cially in the ridiculous shotgun
climax to Act III). As a result,
the play's tone is more depres
sing than frightening.
The remaining members of
the cast (all male) are quite
solid. Bob Kallus is especially
good as Praed, an eternal op
timist who, in contrast to Vivie,
sees only the good in people
and events and spends his life
chasing Beauty across Europe.
William Moreing, who
plays Frank, initially Vivie's
lover and eventually revealed
as her half-brother, misinter
prets the character of a Shavian
top (as most actors do). He
milks the role for all its comic
possibilities without showing
the selfishness underneath.
Shaw himself called
Warren's Profession an "un
pleasant" play. Modern pro
ductions can only bear him out
on that point; and while un
pleasantness isn't necessarily a
fault, it can't serve as a play's
only virtue.

another, to accommodate
themselves to life. Shaw in
tended to show the British pub
lic that they had forced Mrs.
Warren's choice upon her;
that ,the fault was not hers, but
her environment's.

He may have succeeded U
though the critics missed tf
point). But then, the Britis
audience knew that environ
ment; we don't. The action
takes place in various middle
class milieus; the only glimp
ses we get of the environment
as antagonist are in Mrs. War
ren's reminescence. And
while, in the CAT production,
Kandis Chappell does an excel
lent job of bringing Mrs. War
ren to life, it would be beyond
anyone to do the same for her
past betore a modern audi
ence.
Catherine Butterfield, who
plays Mrs. Warren's daughter,
Vivie, has an even harder task.
Vivie is a thoroughly modern
young woman, tough, smart,
independent and about to em
bark on a career as an actuary.
She has never known her
mother, and has no idea how
her Newnham College educa
tion has been paid for. She ac
cepts the fact of her mother's
early fall, but hardens again
when she discovers that her
mother is still involved in pros
titution, now as a madam. Her
modern morality can forgive a
woman's desperate turn to
prostitution, but abhors that
woman when she exploits
others in the same position.
The problem is that Vivie
triumphs morally at the ex
pense of emotion. She is a cold
fish; not interested in love and
romance, she hopes never to

have a holiday from her actuarial
figures. She can resist the
temptation of her mother's
money because she is hard
enough not to want the things
her mother couldn't do with
out.
It this side of Vivie's charac
ter is emphasized, the play can
still have a powerful effect.
Butterfield plays this down,
however, making Vivie more
human than she should (espe
cially in the ridiculous shotgun
climax to Act III). As a result,
the play's tone is more depres
sing than frightening.
The remaining members of
the cast (all male) are quite
solid. Bob Kallus is especially
good as Praed, an eternal op
timist who, in contrast to Vivie,
sees only the good in people
and events and spends his life
chasing Beauty across Europe.
William Moreing, who
plays Frank, initially Vivie's
lover and eventually revealed
as her half-brother, misinter
prets the character of a Shavian
top (as most actors do). He
milks the role for all its comic
possibilities without showing
the selfishness underneath.
Shaw himself called
Warren's Profession an "un
pleasant" play. Modern pro
ductions can only bear him out
on that point; and while un
pleasantness isn't necessarily a
fault, it can't serve as a play's
only virtue.

George Bernard Shaw always
found it easier to pat himselt
on the back than to wait for the
public to do it for him. While
this was not a native trait, but
one he developed during many
lengthy waits, he did consider
himself the best thing that had
happened to English theater in
100 years.
In the preface to Mrs. War
ren's Profession, his third play,
Shaw began making large
claims for his work. He de
clared that his plays were "real
drama," as opposed to the
fashionable sentimental
dramas churned out by his
contemporaries, which he
likened to "opera without
music."
The preface was written in

1902, nine years after the play
was written and shortly after it
was first produced. This man
ifesto of "real drama" is, in
fact, Shaw's reply to his play's
reception. Mrs. Warren's Pro
fession had laid an egg of
monumental proportions. It
was panned from Dublin to
London and back again. The
public, rich and poor alike, ob
jected to it on moral grounds
(the play had been banned by
the Royal Censor eight years
before); the critics cried that it
was dull, grim and unrealistic.
Unfortunately, I agree with the
critics. "Unfortunately," be
cause this is all a long way of
saying that I don't see why a
company would produce Mrs.
Warren's Profession today,

especially a young company
like the California Actor's
Theatre which usually has the
sense to stick with younger
plays or jazz up the old ones (as
they did, quite sucessfully, to A
Midsummer Night's Dream last
September).
The play is about prostitu
tion, literal and figurative. Mrs.
Warren became a prostitute
because she couldn't face a life
ot drudgery; the rest ot the
characters have all prostituted
their humanity, in one way or
another, to accommodate
themselves to life. Shaw in
tended to show the British pub
lic that they had forced Mrs.
Warren's choice upon her;
that ,the fault was not hers, but
her environment's.
