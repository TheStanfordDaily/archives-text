# Coffee House dispute ends
## ASSU shows profit 
### Fran Miller 
Although it was merely striving to
break even, ASSU Financial Manager
Bruce Bendix told the senate last night
that ASSU special projects brought in a
profit of more than $5000 last quarter.
Also during the two-hour meeting,
Sen. Dick Butterfieid announced that
the s'i-month dispute between the
tired workers of the Coffee House
and Guckenheimer Enterprises,
operators of the facility, ended last
week. A grand re-opening of the Cof
fee House is scheduled for tomorrow
night.
In addition, Butterfieid, a member
of the ASSU Coffee House task force,
encouraged students to participate
in researching the feasibility of a
student-run Coffee House. He said
that if enough student interest is
shown, and it appears to be finan
cially feasible, ASSU will submit a bid
for the operating contract of the Cof
fee House. The Tresidder Food Ser
vice contract, which included the
Coffee House, was split last month,
allowing separate bids to be made for
the Coffee House, Transition and En
cina Commons.
Although three ASSU projects lost
money last fall, profits from other
projects netted an overall profit,
Bendix said. The largest profit. $6700,
was brought in by the Lecture Note

Service.
A $6000 loss by Special Events was
attributed to the fact that there were
no large concerts last quarter, Bendix
said. He said the big artists
scheduled for winter and spring
quarters should return the initial in
vestments.
We fully expect to make money
on Special Events this year," he said.
Bendix said the loss of $5000 by the
Typesetting Shop was primarily due
to the dramatic increase in the size of
the Daily last quarter. The Daily's
rates have been readjusted to com
pensate for the loss.
A $600 loss by the Typing Service
was attributable to the fact that it was
a new project slow in getting started,
Bendix said. He added that it had
more work than it could handle after
the project was publicized.
In other business, Alternate Sen.
Julie Johnson told the senatea survey
on recreational facilities here will be
distributed through the Stanford
community by next week.
The survey will include questions
dealing with the importance to stu
dents of recreational facilities as well
as desired hours for their use. Stu
dents will also be questioned about
an Athletic Department proposal to
install four additional tennis courts
instead of adding lights to existing
courts.
The Athletic Department will re
view the survey results, Johnson
said.
Senators also approved the nomi
nations of members of the Tresidder
Union Board. The members are
freshman lonathan McGee, junior jill
Miller, sophomore Doug Mitchell,
graduate student Regina Petty and
senior Tom Virden.
Senate Chair Mark Breier prop
osed the formation of two new
committees. The first of these will
deal with problems with the student
directory, including inefficient or
ganization and late distribution. The
other committee will look into vari
ous ways in which computers can
help with the organization of senate
materials.
In its approval of the Finance
Committee Report, the senate ag
reed to allocate $200 to the Third
World Film Collective. After a
lengthy discussion, senators also ag
reed to give $50 to Special Events to
help that project cover expenses for
a free concert held early in the fall.
Deputy Chair Yvonne Hiltz said
that she is organizing a newsletter to
be distributed on a campus-wide
basis and asked for input.
