Iranian conspirators shot
Revolutionary guardsmen foiled a plot by Ira
nian army officers to overthrow the Khomeini re
gime, and the conspirators were secretly executed
by firing squad, a Kuwait newspaper reported yes
terday.
Word of the alleged plot came after saboteurs
reportedly bombed an oil pipeline in what Iranian
officials also described as a pro-shah, anti-
Khomeini atrack.
Yesterday was the first anniversary of Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's flight from Iran, and
the 74th day in captivity for some 50 American
hostages held by Moslem militants at the occupied
U.S. Embassy in Tehran. It also was the first full day
of a blackout imposed by the Iranian government
on American news reporting from Tehran.
The Iranians again rejected the idea of having
U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim act as a
mediator to try to resolve the U.S.-Iranian crisis.
Waldheim has proposed a U.N. investigation of
the Shah's alleged crimes against the Iranian
people. Iranian foreign Minister Sadegh
Chotbzadeh has reacted favorably to the idea as a
possible avenue of conciliation, but he still insists
the shah must be returned to Iran before the hos
tages are freed.
Iranians marked the anniversary of Pahlavi's de
parture with street decorations, congratulatory
messages to Khomeini and other celebration,
government-run Tehran Radio said.
The report of the coup plot, by the usually reli
able Kuwait newspaper Al Rai At Am, could not be
confirmed with officials in Tehran. But ever since
the Shah's downfall, the revolutionary regime has
warned repeatedly of alleged conspiracies to bring
him back to power.
Bloc backs Afghan invasion
Bonn, West Germany — The Kremlin's eastern
bloc of allies, with the exception of Romania, are
offering varying degrees of support for the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.
Yet the responses of each of the Soviet Union's
six Warsaw Pact allies, analysts here believe, fall
short of the solid front of "international solidarity"
that the Russians expect from their friends.
The East European states, it is felt, are concerned
about the adverse effects that the United States-
Soviet confrontation over Afghanistan will have on
their own relations with the West.
That confrontation could result in a setback to
East Europe's trade and other links that have been
laboriously forged since the days of the Cold War
in its efforts to improve its economies through
Western technical know-how and material help. It
comes at a time of mounting economic problems
for all of the East European states due to rising oil
prices and other troubles.
The concern is fueled by apprehension over the
state of health of Yugoslav President )osef Tito. The
87-year old Tito, who broke with the Kremlin in
1958, underwent surgery last weekend to remove a
blood clot from his left leg.
Medical reports indicate that the surgery was not
a success, and there is heightened concern that

another and potentially more serious East-West
confrontation could flare up if, in the event of
Tito's death, the Russians sought to force Yugos
lavia back into the Kremlin fold.
Communist Yugoslavia, which has pursued an
independent course, has been the only eastern
European state — with the exception of
zenophobic Albania, which has been at odds with
Moscow, Peking and the West — to openly con
demn the Soviet Union tor its invasion of Afghanis
tan. Its criticism has been as direct and forceful as
that expressed by the United States and other
Western countries.
U.S. discontinues gold sales
New York — The price of gold continued to rise
sharply yesterday spurred in part by Tuesday's an
nouncement from Treasury Secretary William Mil
ler that the United States would not sell any more
of its gold stockpile in the near future.
In New York, the price of gold closed at $744 an
ounce, $31.50 more than Tuesday and about $300
more than a month ago.
Nevertheless, the closing New York price was
below the highs reached earlier in the day in Euro
pean trading. At the morning London fixing, gold
hit $765 an ounce. But as the day wore on — and
dealers digested the Treasury announcement —
the price slipped back. By the end of the London
trading day, the price was $752.
While gold continues to climb in price, silver fell
60cents an ounce to $45.70 in New York. Platinum,
the other major precious metal, rose $12.90 to
$882.30
The U.S. dollar, which has remained strong
throughout most of the month-long explosion in
gold prices, declined slightly in what dealers cal
led active trading in Europe.
The gold and silver markets are reacting abnor
mally experts say, because investors are not buy
ing gold with the usual notion of selling it at a
higher price later. Instead, the Middle Eastern in
vestors especially are buying it and stashing it away
as a hedge.
Now, the major impact of the gold price in
crease can be seen in jewelry prices. Silver, which
has a wider industrial use than gold , will hit the
average American harder. Recently, film manufac
turers announced big price increase — silver is a
major component of photographic film.
— The commodities futures trading commis
sion, which regulates futures trading in gold, said
it is not considering shutting down gold trading,
but is monitoring the market.
— The Chicago Board of Trade increased the
range in which gold futures prices may trade on
any given day and raised the size of the down
payment (margin) investors must maintain on gold
futures contracts. The margin increase was im
posed to cut down gold speculation.
Mexico to buy surplus grain
Washington — Mexico has agreed to buy 2.35
million metric tons of corn and wheat that was
scheduled to go to the Soviet Union before Presi
dent |immy Carter imposed an embargo in retalia

tion for the Russian move into Afghanistan, ad
ministration officials announced yesterday.
Mexico will buy 1.7 million metric tons of corn
and 650,000 tons of wheat out of the 17 million tons
of wheat and corn shipments which had been
scheduled to go to the Soviet Union before Carter
imposed the partial grain embargo.
All told, U.S. and Mexican representatives an
nounced an agreement which calls for Mexico to
buy an additional 4.8 million metric tons of U.S.
farm products this year.
Agricultural officials say total sales will be
around 7.15 million metric tons.
Officials said the agreement involves commer
cial transactions, and that no U.S. government
credit package was involved.
)orge de la Vega, secretary of commerce for
Mexico, said the new agreement "will be very be
neficial to both countries," adding that the purch
ases "are due in part to the drought and early frost
that we suffered in Mexico" which reduced har
vests.
Hugo Margain, Mexico's ambassador to the Un
ited States, said the negotiations proceeded "in a
very friendly atmosphere" and that "we need
grains and you have a surplus."
Paul McCartney arrested
Tokyo — It was a hard day's night for former
Beatle Paul McCartney, jailedafterairport customs
officers said they found nearly half a pound of
marijuana in his luggage. McCartney was arrested
as he and his rock group "Wings" arrived yester
day for an 1 l-concert tour that now has been can
celed.
If he is formally charged and convicted, he
could be sentenced to a maximum of seven years
in prison and a fine of up to the equivalent of
$2 000 officials said. Such trials can take months or
even years in Japan.
Japanese news reports said it was likely
McCartney would be expelled from Japan without
facing formal charges.
