# Soviet backing of Iran terrorists claimed

An international student terrorist
network controlled from the Kremlin
is responsible for the American Em
bassy takeover in Tehran, said
Ronald Hilton, editor of the Califor
nia Institute of International Studies
quarterly World Affairs Keporl.
Hilton's article on this al
leged network will appear in the next
issue of World Affairs Report,
scheduled to come out early next
week. Hilton, an emeritus professor
here, said it will exhibit evidence ob
tained from studying what he terms
"Soviet sources."
"There is convincing evidence that
behind the mob scenes and seeming
chaos in Iran there is a master plan
involving 'student' terrorists around
the world. . . tied to Moscow, which
use detente as a cover for these de
stabilizing activities," he said.
Hilton's article cites incidents that
he said tie the Iranian students hold
ing Americans hostage to this ter
rorist network.
But History Prof. Alexander Dallin,
a specialist in Soviet affairs here, cal
led Hilton's hypothesis "nonsense."
"We are beyond the point where
we have to assume any anti-
American sentiment is part of a
communist plot," he said. "There are
communists in Iran and some of the
students are probably pro-Moscow,
but we just don't know. I insist that
Hilton doesn't know either."
Hilton said the Soviet-controlled
network involves student terrorists
around the world and such groups as
the lapanese Red Army, the provi
sional IRA and the West German
Baader-Meinhoff gang. As evidence
of his theory, Hilton pointed to the
arrest at the Canada-Vermont border
of a West German terrorist who is
believed to belong to the Baader-
Meinhoff gang. Her passport was re
vealed to be one of several stolen by
Iranian students during the occupa
tion of the Iranian consulate in
Geneva in 1976.

Dallin said that there are likely
some contacts between Arab and
lapanese terrorist groups, but he
stated that Moslem fanaticism is "just
as much anti-Soviet as it is anti-
American."
Hilton alleged the Soviets are di
rectly involved in Iran and outlined
what he called the connections bet
ween Moscow and both the over
thrown shah's and Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini's regimes.
The Soviet-controlled radio
broadcasts in Iran that encouraged
the embassy takeover, and the sig
nificant increase in the number of
Soviet embassy workers in Tehran
(many are thought to be members of
the Soviet secret police, the KGB) are
facts he said should not be ignored.
"The fact that the Soviet Union has
gone through the motions of con
demning, in ambiguous terms, the
seizure of the American Embassy
should not obscure the other facts,"
warned Hilton. The Soviet Union's
ambassador to the United Nations
vetoed a Security Council resolution
to impose economic sanctions on
Iran.
Dallin conceded that the Soviets
would like to take advantage of the
situation in Iran, but he said that it
doesn't follow that the seizure was
Soviet-controlled. "The whole no
tion that international terrorists are
all part of a Soviet manipulation net
work is supported by no facts that I
know of," he said.
Exposure
Hilton has recently appeared on
the British Broadcasting Corporation
(BBC) and several radio broadcasts to
discuss his controversial theory. But,
he said he was frustrated in his at
tempt to get the New York Times to
investigate and publicize his views.
He said he is being ignored by that
publication because of its "commer
cial" and "leftist" interests.
Most disbelief of his theory, he
said, is based in the average person's
unwillingness to see that which is not

directly before his eyes. Another fac
tor, he said, entails Moscow's
methods of silencing rumors of what
he calls "the conspiracy."
To credit his theory and
aackground in international affairs,
Hilton recalled his foresight in the
Bay of Pigs incident. He was the first
observer, he said, to give advance
ndication of America's ill-fated at
tempt to invade Cuba, and he re
membered that "no one believed me
then."
Hilton claimed evidence of not

only Soviet cooperation with the Ira
nian students involved in the
takeover, but of strong Russian con
trol of all Iran. Moscow keeps Kho
meini and his government "in-line"
through the students' immediate
power and the threat of the Soviet
hacked secessionist movements in
Azerbaidzhan and Kurdistan, he
said.
He said that the idea for a spy trial
of the embassy hostages originated
in Moscow. "(The trial) would be a

humiliation for the United States and
a triumph for Soviet propaganda."
Concerning the identity of the Ira
nian students, he noted that "in all
the voluminous reporting on the
hostages, there has been no serious
discussion on the nature of the
people who carried out the seizure
and have used their criminal act for
worldwide propaganda against the
U.S."
Hilton said that the dangers the
United States faces in Iran (and now
in Afghanistan) will be more grave if
the Soviets' methods aren't studied
and their plans "taken seriously." He
claimed that events in Iran are part of
"a broad plan to incite the Third
World against U.S. imperialism.
"People must wake up to the evi
dence," he said.
