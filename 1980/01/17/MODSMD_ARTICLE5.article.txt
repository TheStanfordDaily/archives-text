Although several Iranian students
here will soon face hearings for ex
pired visa cards, the students did not
suffer tuition problems from the
freezing of Iranian assets in U.S.
banks.
"The freeze was amended in De
cember to exempt educational fees,
so nobody should be denied his
education," said Robert
Rosenzweig, vice president for pub
lic affairs.
"I don't think any Iranian students
have suffered adverse consequ
ences" he added.
According to Mitch Hall, foreign
student adviser, all Iranian students
had to report to the U.S. Immigration
Office.
"Some of their 1-94 cards (visa
cards that show the cardholder's au
thorized time of arrival and depar
ture) had expired, so they had to ap
pear before the offices. It's a minor
ity of students â€” I'd guess that ap
proximately 10 students of the 111
Iranians at Stanford had some sort of
problem, he said.
Those who did not renew their I-94

cards are still in the hearing process.
"These hearings take a long time,
but my guess is that they'll be
reinstated. They (the Immigration
Office) have been fairly lenient with
late 1-94 requests in the past," said
Hall.
One Iranian student contacted here,
said he was riding his bicycle when
three tall, young and white males at
tacked him.
"I was scared. I came to Meyer
(Undergraduate Library). I thought
they were perhaps gone, and I came
back to Escondido. I don't know if
they were students," he said.
"If people know I'm Iranian, they
hesitate to talk to me and answer my
questions. I say I'm Mexian, because
I look more Mexican.
He also said one of his Iranian
friends has had a visa hearing. "He
said they made a file on him and
asked him if he like the government
in Iran."
The student said a small group of
Iranians gets together "to play for
three or four hours on Saturday," but
no official organization of Iranian
students exists at the Universitv.
