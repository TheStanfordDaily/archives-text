# 'Aqualin,' sharks, a winning combo
## Student here wins trip to Hawaii 
### Rose Chan 
Playing the underwater vio
lin and swimming with sharks
are not new activities for Mark
Gottlieb. But winning a trip to
Hawaii for doing so is certainly
a welcome twist for the 22-
year-old graduate student
here.
Gottlieb's trip came after he
placed third in the "Outrage
ous Stunt" contest sponsored
by the San Francisco radio sta
tion KYUU at the end of last
year.
The lure of a pound of gold
for first prize prompted the
engineering management and
product design student to play
his "aqualin" in the outrage
ous competition. That feat has
secured him a place in the Gui
ness Book of World Records
since 1976 and has earned him
considerable publicity.
But this time, he decided,
he'd add a few touches for
bravura.
Gottlieb's concert hall was
none other than the Shark
Pond at Marine World. Dres
sed in a tuxedo, complete with
frilly shirt and scuba gear, he
entertained both the judges
and the sharks. With 160 dives
throughout the world to his
credit, Gottlieb says he's swum
with a lot of sharks and has
never been afraid of them.
His program included the
theme from the James Bond
movie Goldfinger and the
theme from laws, both of
which were suggestions from
friends.
"The whole thing was fun.
Afterwards I took my friends
out to lunch," said Gottlieb.
But Gottlieb lost the gold
prize to a "KYUU Superman"
who ate lunch while hanging
100 feet below a helicopter
hovering over San Francisco.
And second prize — a trip to
New York to see Saturday
Night Live — went to a man
who carved a 12-foot loaf of
French bread into a kayak and

then carried his 200-pound
body into San Francisco Bay.
Gottlieb's Hawaiian vacation
is scheduled for sometime this
summer. The prize includes
two plane tickets to Honolulu,
a stay at the Reef Hotel on
Waikiki, free drinks, paid car
rental for one day, a photo
album and other odds and
ends.
Despite badgering from
friends, Gottlieb hasn't de
cided yet who will share his
prize.
"I'm waiting until summer
time to decide. I assume I can
ask anyone at the last minute
and they'll jump at the offer,"
said Gottlieb. His plans for the
one-week stay are to "sit on the
beach, play around, and go div
ing, of course," he said.
Gottlieb's unique musical ta
lent stemmed from his reluc

tance to spend time practicing
the violin.
"I always wanted to spend
time in the pool. So I figured if I
had to practice, it may as well
be where I enjoyed being," he
said. So at the age of 17, he set
forth to transform his violin
into an "aqualin" and to
waterproof his favorite under
water pieces — "Water
Music," "The Blue Danube"
and "Raindrops Keep Falling
on My Head." The third
aqualin Gottlieb constructed
has lasted four years and is still
going strong.
He didn't stop there. Two
years later he designed and
manufactured an underwater
organ or "hydrorgan." His sis
ter Karen accompanied him at
performances, and the
Gottlieb duet has been fea
tured in several nationwide
shows and in Japan.

Audiences may be surprised
at the clarity of the underwater
music.
"It doesn't sound great, but
it definitely sounds," said
Gottlieb, as he listened to a
very recognizable recording of
"Blue Danube."
Aside from the five TV shows
Gottlieb has done, he plays for
friends on special occasions —
in pools and in the ocean.
Gottlieb even comes equipped
with speakers for both under
and over the water.
When he isn't entertaining,
the Olympia, Washington, na
tive is a full-time graduate stu
dent here.
The soft-spoken student said
of his unusual specialty, "It's
not a matter of trying to change
the world. It's just a matter of
trying to make it more enjoy
able. That's what it's all about
— having fun."

underwater violin he designed and constructed. The 22-year old recently won a trip to Hawaii for playing
the unique instrument in a shark pond during an "Outrageous Stunt" competition sponsored by a San
