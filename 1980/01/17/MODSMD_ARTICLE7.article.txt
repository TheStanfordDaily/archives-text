Washington — The outlook for college
graduates entering the job market next June re
mains relatively good, despite any recession.
Moreover, beginning salaries for highly desira
ble degrees in engineering, computer science
and business management are expected to rise
comfortably ahead of the average.
Among the lessons business learned during
the recession of 1974-75, according to John
Shingleton, was that a gap in the manpower
supply line was created when hiring of college
graduates was cut back.
Shingleton, who as director ot placement for
Michigan State University conducts an annual
survey of employers, anticipates a slight ( one to
two percent) increase in the number of
graduates hired this year. This contrasts with the
much more optimistic picture painted by the
College Placement Council in Bethlehem, Pa.
which is forecasting a 13 percent rise.
In Shingleton's survey, the job market looks
brightest for graduates in accounting, aeros
pace, electronics, merchandising-retailing,

military and the petroleum industries. Moderate
hiring can be expected in the fields of electric
equipment-machinery, food and beverage pro
cessing, hospitals and health services, hotels
and motels, metals and metal products, utilities
and research and consulting.
Geographically speaking, the states where it
will be easiest to find a job are in the Sun Belt
and the North Central region. The Southeast,
Northeast and Northwest had the lowest hiring
potential.
The broader picture is not so optimistic.
Employment outlook surveys for the coming
year show that most industries are not planning
extensive layoffs, but neither are they planning
to hire.
Those occupations scheduled for substantial
reductions include compositors, postal clerks,
domestic workers, railroad workers, farm work
ers, merchant-marine sailors and blacksmiths.
Occupations showing the greatest oppor
tunities for employment include bank clerks,
city managers, dishwashers, travel agents and
flight attendants.
