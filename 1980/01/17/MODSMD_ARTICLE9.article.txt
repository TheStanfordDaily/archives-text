# Bill 'Early-Date' Kemmeries
## A 						'learning experience' 
### 
It was at the first big overseas students' meet
ing, after describing Cliveden as "a bea,utiful
paradise" and Florence as "a food capital of the
world," when the man said that Tours was "a
great learning experience." A learning experi
ence! ! What the "hudda," I should have known
right then. How many "good" learning experi
ences have you ever had?
I remember my Dad said it was "a real learning
experience" when I totally "accordionized" our
brand newcar. I also remember when my cousin
got pregnant at age 16 at some slumber party.
Everyone in our family said that it was an incred
ible learning experience, but then again we had
all heard that she "studies" pretty regularly.
Anyways, none of us Tours people got the
hint, and we were psyched up like everyone else
to go over there. Why were we so psyched? I
don't know for sure, but most people fit into
three categories:
1) Ner vou s-Breakdown-Just-A round-1 he-
Corner People: These students are really hurting.
Either grades, boyfriend/girlfriend problems,
food service or some other problem was quickly
driving them crazy and they had to get out.
Vou couid tell who these people were pretty
easily because they would just walk around,
looking starry-eyed, and shaking their heads
while continually repeating, '"Dead Week,
Dead Week." Or some just out of the blue
would start crying and singing "Still." At the
meeting the man put them all to one side so they
wouldn't infect the rest of us.
2) Kill Two Birds With One Stone People: Some
of the students at the meeting had never gotten
an "A" in their life and had heard that while
traveling around Europe and having fun you
could get 18 units worth of solid "A." This
sounded good to a whole mess of people.
3) The Miscellaneous People: Then of course
there were others who had some special reason
to go to Europe that they kept close to their
hearts. I knew these two Delts who had "acciden
tally" kicked to death some dude, and thought
that it would be better to be cultured than cap
tured.
In Tours they killed two old French ladies who
refused to do something called "le slide d'ice,"
and then left for the Berlin campus. Someone
told me the other day that they had joined some
fraternity called the "KGBs" and that they
wouldn't be back for a while.
Whatever the reason, the Tours people were
all in for a hard learning experience. My big
experience was learning to live in a papier
mache international dorm called Sanitas, which
had 800 students — 750 Arabs, 42 Nigerians and
Chadians, and 8 Vietnamese dudes. There were
no French students at all. They were smart. They
wouldn't be caught dead at the "U.N." and just
stayed at home living with their families, making
crepes and other crap.
I did have a hard time adjusting. And it's not
like I hold any prejudices toward the Arabs or
something like that. Some of my best friends on
campus are Arabs — lumana and Riyadh Nabti,
to name two.
The Vietnamese gang was pretty strange,
though. I think they were a little paranoid be
cause they always stood near the emergency exit
doors during class, constantly blinking their
eyes en masse.

Late at night all eight would form a tight circle
with their backs to each other for security, roam
ing the halls in a circular motion while moving
their hands in a karate-type motion that made
some weird noise like a helicopter blade cutting
the air.
They were always on time, too. I remember
waking up almost every night at 3:37 a.m. upon
hearing the "Swoosha-Swoosha" noise going
past my door. I heard one night they chopped
the cleaning lady real good.
I guess what the hardest thing about my learn
ing experience in the dorm was adjusting to the
fact that Sanitas was just not like a Roble or a
Wilbur. The median age at the dorm was 27, and
everyone carried a knife. Right when I just
moved in I knew that this was not your regular
Stanford dorm with Secret Santas, Bible Studies
and other stuff.
It was especially hard on the only other
American in the dorm, Marvin Goldberg. I could
tell Marvin was really nervous about living there
because the first thing he did was melt down and
sell his Star of David. Also, every time he saw
someone in the hall he would wildly dance
around, clap his hands and yell, "Let's Co,
P.L.0.!" I think all the Arab students knew that
he was faking it, but they really respected him
for trying.
The thing is, even though I had a few rough
moments, I did learn some things at the Sanitas
International Dorm:
1) Always remember to lock your door
whenever you leave, even if it's just for a mo
ment.
2) Americans shower a heck of a lot more than
other peoples of the world.
Seriously though, I did enjoy Tours and
Sanitas, and going overseas has been the best
thing I've done at Stanford.
And just as the man said it would be, my stay in
Prance was a learning experience as I learned a
whole lot about myself:
I) I learned that I can't speak French worth a
damn. My bad pronunciation (chateau —
"shaw-toe") also messed me up. I was the only
American kicked out of the "French Family Din
ner Program" when I tried to say in French, "I
am so hungry I could kiss that duck," but in
stead, unwittingly, I used the vulgar French verb
tor "to make love" in place of "kiss" (they do
sound amazingly alike).
Although the dad started cracking up and al
most fell over in his chair, "la mere" started
steaming through her nostrils while putting her
hands over her kids' ears, and then kicked me
out of the house.
2) I also learned that I will never marry a
French girl. My one date with Nicolette "never
used-Gillette" Chene convinced me of this.
3) I also learned who my friends were. It was
like a test in a way. I figured whoever wrote me
the most would be my "best" friends, which
turned out to be my mom followed closely by
the Single Student Housing Office.
And you know, my learning experience just
didn't end there; I am still learning a lot from my
trip overseas all the time. Why just the other day
I went over to the Old Union and found out what
I already had suspected to be true — it's almost
impossible to kill two birds with one stone.

ner Program" when I tried to say in French, "I
am so hungry I could kiss that duck," but in
stead, unwittingly, I used the vulgar French verb
tor "to make love" in place of "kiss" (they do
sound amazingly alike).
Although the dad started cracking up and al
most fell over in his chair, "la mere" started
steaming through her nostrils while putting her
hands over her kids' ears, and then kicked me
out of the house.
2) I also learned that I will never marry a
French girl. My one date with Nicolette "never
used-Gillette" Chene convinced me of this.
3) I also learned who my friends were. It was
like a test in a way. I figured whoever wrote me
the most would be my "best" friends, which
turned out to be my mom followed closely by
the Single Student Housing Office.
And you know, my learning experience just
didn't end there; I am still learning a lot from my
trip overseas all the time. Why just the other day
I went over to the Old Union and found out what
I already had suspected to be true — it's almost
impossible to kill two birds with one stone.
(BillKemmeries column appears every three
weeks.)
It was at the first big overseas students' meet
ing, after describing Cliveden as "a bea,utiful
paradise" and Florence as "a food capital of the
world," when the man said that Tours was "a
great learning experience." A learning experi
ence! ! What the "hudda," I should have known
right then. How many "good" learning experi
ences have you ever had?
I remember my Dad said it was "a real learning
experience" when I totally "accordionized" our
brand newcar. I also remember when my cousin
got pregnant at age 16 at some slumber party.
Everyone in our family said that it was an incred
ible learning experience, but then again we had
all heard that she "studies" pretty regularly.
Anyways, none of us Tours people got the
hint, and we were psyched up like everyone else
to go over there. Why were we so psyched? I
don't know for sure, but most people fit into
three categories:
1) Ner vou s-Breakdown-Just-A round-1 he-
Corner People: These students are really hurting.
Either grades, boyfriend/girlfriend problems,
food service or some other problem was quickly
driving them crazy and they had to get out.
Vou couid tell who these people were pretty
easily because they would just walk around,
looking starry-eyed, and shaking their heads
while continually repeating, '"Dead Week,
Dead Week." Or some just out of the blue
would start crying and singing "Still." At the
meeting the man put them all to one side so they
wouldn't infect the rest of us.
2) Kill Two Birds With One Stone People: Some
of the students at the meeting had never gotten
an "A" in their life and had heard that while
traveling around Europe and having fun you
could get 18 units worth of solid "A." This
sounded good to a whole mess of people.
3) The Miscellaneous People: Then of course
there were others who had some special reason
to go to Europe that they kept close to their
hearts. I knew these two Delts who had "acciden
tally" kicked to death some dude, and thought
that it would be better to be cultured than cap
tured.
In Tours they killed two old French ladies who
refused to do something called "le slide d'ice,"
and then left for the Berlin campus. Someone
told me the other day that they had joined some
fraternity called the "KGBs" and that they
wouldn't be back for a while.
Whatever the reason, the Tours people were
all in for a hard learning experience. My big
experience was learning to live in a papier
mache international dorm called Sanitas, which
had 800 students — 750 Arabs, 42 Nigerians and
Chadians, and 8 Vietnamese dudes. There were
no French students at all. They were smart. They
wouldn't be caught dead at the "U.N." and just
stayed at home living with their families, making
crepes and other crap.
I did have a hard time adjusting. And it's not
like I hold any prejudices toward the Arabs or
something like that. Some of my best friends on
campus are Arabs — lumana and Riyadh Nabti,
to name two.
The Vietnamese gang was pretty strange,
though. I think they were a little paranoid be
cause they always stood near the emergency exit
doors during class, constantly blinking their
eyes en masse.

Late at night all eight would form a tight circle
with their backs to each other for security, roam
ing the halls in a circular motion while moving
their hands in a karate-type motion that made
some weird noise like a helicopter blade cutting
the air.
They were always on time, too. I remember
waking up almost every night at 3:37 a.m. upon
hearing the "Swoosha-Swoosha" noise going
past my door. I heard one night they chopped
the cleaning lady real good.
I guess what the hardest thing about my learn
ing experience in the dorm was adjusting to the
fact that Sanitas was just not like a Roble or a
Wilbur. The median age at the dorm was 27, and
everyone carried a knife. Right when I just
moved in I knew that this was not your regular
Stanford dorm with Secret Santas, Bible Studies
and other stuff.
It was especially hard on the only other
American in the dorm, Marvin Goldberg. I could
tell Marvin was really nervous about living there
because the first thing he did was melt down and
sell his Star of David. Also, every time he saw
someone in the hall he would wildly dance
around, clap his hands and yell, "Let's Co,
P.L.0.!" I think all the Arab students knew that
he was faking it, but they really respected him
for trying.
The thing is, even though I had a few rough
moments, I did learn some things at the Sanitas
International Dorm:
1) Always remember to lock your door
whenever you leave, even if it's just for a mo
ment.
2) Americans shower a heck of a lot more than
other peoples of the world.
Seriously though, I did enjoy Tours and
Sanitas, and going overseas has been the best
thing I've done at Stanford.
And just as the man said it would be, my stay in
Prance was a learning experience as I learned a
whole lot about myself:
I) I learned that I can't speak French worth a
damn. My bad pronunciation (chateau —
"shaw-toe") also messed me up. I was the only
American kicked out of the "French Family Din
ner Program" when I tried to say in French, "I
am so hungry I could kiss that duck," but in
stead, unwittingly, I used the vulgar French verb
