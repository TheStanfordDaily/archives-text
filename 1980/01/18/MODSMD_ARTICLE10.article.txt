# Afghans hold rites for Amin victims

Kabul — ) ust one of the
ironies of the new Soviet
installed Afghan govern
ment's attempts to gain popu
lar acceptance was the specta
cle this week of Communist
cadres organizing a mosque
ceremony.
Although ideologically
worlds apart, the Afghan lead
ership seems to be cribbing
pages from the Iranian revolu
tion's book.
So it was that the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanis
tan's new president, Babrak
Karmal, Sunday organized
mosque ceremonies to make a
hastily declared National
Mourning Day for Afghans kil
led under what is described
here as the "sanguinary Amin
regime."
The main difficulty in trying
to adapt Iranian revolutionary
principles to circumstances in
Afghanistan is that it is hard for
leaders who are battling Mos
lem rebels to portray them
selves as men of the cloth.
Somehow, when Babrak
Karmal invokes the phrase
"bismillah Irrahman Irrahim"
(in the name of Allah, the com
passionate, the merciful) be
fore a speech in which he effu
sively lauds the Soviet Union,
there is an inherent contradic
tion that at least does not crop
up when Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini speaks those words.
At Kabul's blue mosque
Sunday this was illustrated as

party workers of Babrak's Par
cham (banner) faction of the
People's Democratic Party en
couraged mourners to sign
"visitors' books" after filing
through the mosque to hear
plaintive Koranic chants in
memory of the dead.
The well-drilled party cadres
consistently denied that they
were Communists and gave
the party line about how Amin,
a leader of the party's rival
Khalq (masses) faction, was a
CIA agent and tried to split the
party.
One Parchamite, asked how
he could reconcile the atheism
of the group's Soviet sponsors
with its staging of a Moslem re
ligious ceremony, would ans
wer only, "That's a good ques
tion."
Another organizer at the
mosque, Abdul Ghafar Shergi,
said he had joined the Parcham
faction 10 years ago and had
served three months in prison
under the four-month rule of
Amin.
"Babrak is acting for democ
racy," said Shergi, who now
also works in the Agriculture
Ministry. He added that the Af
ghan rebels opposed to the
government were "Moslems in
name only" and were really
"working for the imperialist
countries and the Saudis."
Then the gaunt, bearded
Shergi, wearing a Russian-style
fur hat, was asked whether it
was apparent to him that Af
ghans dislike the presence of
the estimated 85,000-strong
Soviet force here to shore up
the Babrak government.
"Maybe," he answered.
"But they are not political
people. They are simple
people. They don't know who
their friends are. They don't
know who their enemies are.
They are thinking by them
selves."
The mosque-side chat with
Shergi ended with this ex
change:
"Are you a Moslem?"
"Yes, of course. All Af
ghanistan is Moslem."
"Do you believe in Cod?"
"Huh?"
"Do you believe in God?"
Along pause. Asmile. "No."
Despite an order for shops to
close in observance of the
mourning day, there seemed
to be more Afghans in the
neighborhood peddling food
and sundries than attending
the ceremonies.
Embassies seemed to be
caught in a dilemma. Although
many Western and other non
communist missions have
been ordered not to deal for
mally yet with the new gov
ernment, most — includingthe
American and French embas
sies — obeyed a government
directive to fly their flags at
half-staff in respect of the
mourning day.
