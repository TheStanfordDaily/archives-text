Dear Bug Me,
For years I've had a desire to ride on the
Goodyear Blimp. Is there any way one could
try to get a ride? Doesn't someone at this
school have any connections along these
lines? Don't let my lofty dreams go .. .
Up in Smoke
The Blimp to which you refer is Goodyear's
"Columbia" based in Gardenia, California. It
is one of a fleet of four lighter-than-air craft
built and maintained by Goodyear.
Since 1917, Goodyear has built over 300
lighter-than-air craft, according to the com
pany. Most of these were for the Army and
Navy, both of which have since phased out
the airship.
Goodyear maintains its small fleet as "a
public relations tool," a representative of the
company said.
The "Columbia" is the only blimp which
regularly flies the western skies. The
"Europa" is based in Italy, and the "Mayf
lower" and "Enterprise" call Florida and
Ohio their respective homes.
Unfortunately, rides on the blimps are not
easy to come by. The maximum passenger
capacity of each ship is six people, and one of
the six should presumably be the pilot. Be
cause of the limited space, rides are by invita
tion only to Goodyear dealers and associates,
and members of the press, television and
radio.
Normally the "Mayflower" gives rides to
the public at its winter base in Miami, but it is
out of commission at present, according to
Goodyear.
II you do find yourself afloat in the Blimp
someday, you'll want to remember these in
teresting statistics: the "Columbia" has a
maximum speed of 50 mph and maximum
range of 500 miles. It normally cruises about
15 mph at an altitude between one and three
thousand feet.
As far as dimensions are concerned, it
could easily land between the goal posts in
the Stanford Stadium.

Although the George Forsythe Hall was just
dedicated on Monday, the new computing
center has already found at least one critic:
Dear Bug Me,
' Universities seem to have an irresistable
urge to locate their computing facilities "far
from the madding crowd." Once again, Stan
ford has tried to outdo all the competition.
The new Forsythe Computing Center is
situated on the extreme edge of the de
veloped campus.
Is there any reason why it is located so
inconveniently? Did the planners give any
thought to the needs of the faculty
and the students who ultimately pay for it?
Previously, there used to be output bins in
Encina Hall, for the convenience of the ad
ministration.
Does SCIP feel any obligation to provide a
similar commonsense service for other users,
who have been overlooked in SCIP's rush to
provide a comfortable new home for itself?
Distressed Computer User
"We didn't have too much choice," said Ed
Williams, associate director of SCIP. The lo- .
cation of the Forsythe building was made by
University officials. The center was limited in
its choices of location by needs for adequate
parking as well as building space. "The Plan
ning Office basically dictates where buildings
can go," Williams added.
The Forsythe Hall may be a distance from
the center of campus, but there are over 400
terminals around the University which are
tied into if. "Very few people actually come
to the new center," Williams said, except to
pick up output or use the special equipment
there.
Williams said that computer use will be
further decentralized in the coming years as
other output sites and more terminals are
added to the system.
Send or bring your inquiries to Bug Me via
the Daily. I'm still waiting for,mot her Preppie
joke and a "Please Me" question (a favorable
comment on some aspect of Stanford.)
