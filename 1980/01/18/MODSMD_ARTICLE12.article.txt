## ERA: Palo Alto boycotts the naysayers 
### Lisa Adler 
The Equal Rights Amend
ment (ERA) movement is alive
and well and backers are work
ing to gain support in cities and
communities across the United
States. In fact, new steps have
been taken to promote the
issue right here in Palo Alto.
The Palo Alto City Council
passed a resolution on Nov. 19,
boycotting states which have
not ratified ERA.
According to Amy Huntoon,
a coordinator for the mid-
Peninsula chapters of the Na
tional Organization for
Women (NOW), city
employees will not get reim
bursed for travel expenses in
curred while on city business:
that is, attending conferences,
assemblies, conventions and
meetings in those states not
having passed the ERA." The
intent of the boycott is to dis
courage people from going to
unratified states, she said.
According to Palo Alto
Mayor Alan Henderson,
"There was a feeling within the
majority of the city council
members that the Equal Rights
Amendment would not be pas
sed unless pressure were put
on those states which have not
ratified the legislation."
The proposal was submitted
to the city council by council
members Emily Renzel and
Gary Razzino.
However, the resolution has
a type of "Catch-22" because,
as Henderson pointed out, if a
meeting or court proceeding is
most vital to the working of the
city, an employee will still be
able to attend.
The vote on the boycott re
solution was eight in favor,
zero opposed and one absten
tion.
Council member Lee Levy
abstained from voting. Levy
summarized his reasons by say
ing, "I do not like the idea of
voting on anything which
should be open to public dis
cussion in front of the council.
"Although many people
were concerned about the full

agenda and the time during the
meeting on Nov. 19, the issue
still deserved lengthy discus
sion: to present various lines
of reasoning for favoring or
disagreeing with the proposal.
"Furthermore, as an elected
city official, I feel that I should
confine myself to city and local
issues — not national," Levy
concluded.
The resolution was passed a
few weeks before Palo Alto of
ficials were scheduled to at
tend the National Cities Con
ference in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Henderson reported that no
one from Palo Alto's council
traveled to the conference.
Jay Rounds, personnel direc
tor for Palo Alto, stated that the
resolution has already affected
the city to some extent: some
officials are not going to educa
tional institutes, except when
they want to pay for their own
bills and expenses.
"I do not know if anyone ran
financial investigations to as
certain whether the city would
be saving money or how much
money would be withheld
from the convention cities. In
reality, our officials don't travel
too much," said Rounds.
"One particular commun
ity," stated Henderson, "will
not have that much impact in
convincing a state to ratify the
ERA, but a large percentage of
communities rallying behind
such a boycott can wield
power."
The idea of a boycott is not
unique to the area. In March of
1978, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors was the
first county in the country to
pass an ERA resolution. It pas
sed on a 3-2 vote.
Palo Alto, said Huntoon, is
the first city in Santa Clara
county to pass a boycott resol
ution.
Huntoon spent two months
trying to get the boyott passed.
She attributed the success to
"an effective job in educating
the council members and pub
licizing the endeavor."
Twenty local organizations

wrote letters in support of the
resolution. Among the groups
were people from Stanford.
Debbie De Mott, a senior
who works at the Women's
Center, said that some profes
sors wrote letters.
"We are very concerned
about ERA and women's is
sues. We support the resolu
tion passed by the Palo Alto
City Council. Perhaps some
thing similar in some capacity
could be enacted here at Stan
ford," said Kim Bancroft, a
member of the staff at the
Women's Center.
Bob Beyers, director of News
and Publications at Stanford,
said he is not aware of an at
tempt by the University to re
strict faculty members and stu
dents from going to unratified
states.
"It would be difficult to en
force because individuals fre
quently go to conferences on
their own. Also, the University
usually will take a stand against
proposals which involve re
strictions on freedom of scho
larly movements either politi
cally or academically," Beyers
said.
The Equal Rights Amend
ment has been ratified by 35
states and needs just three
more states.
Huntoon said that over 400

national organizations and
more than 30 cities and coun
ties have joined in boycott? By
resolving that no funds will be
used to send employees to
conventions in the 15 un
ratified states.
Millions of dollars in conten
tion and travel business have
been withheld trom the follow
ing states (some majorconven
tion cities lie in these states):
Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Illinois,
Oklahoma, Missouri, Nevada,
Utah and Arizona.
The effectiveness of the
boycott was emphasized in
February 1978, when Missouri
Attorney General )ohn
Ashcrott and Nevada Attorney
General Robert list filed suits
against NOW. They claimed
that the boycott violated the
Sherman Antitrust Act.
NOW filed counterclaim
lawsuits against the two states
alleging violations of the or
ganization's civil and constitu
tional rights. Missouri did not
accept the counterclaim but
Nevada did.
The Federal District Court
reviewed the case brought
against Missouri by NOW and
ruled in NOW's favor in a dech
sion issued Feb. 21, 1979.

agenda and the time during the
meeting on Nov. 19, the issue
still deserved lengthy discus
sion: to present various lines
of reasoning for favoring or
disagreeing with the proposal.
"Furthermore, as an elected
city official, I feel that I should
confine myself to city and local
issues — not national," Levy
concluded.
The resolution was passed a
few weeks before Palo Alto of
ficials were scheduled to at
tend the National Cities Con
ference in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Henderson reported that no
one from Palo Alto's council
traveled to the conference.
Jay Rounds, personnel direc
tor for Palo Alto, stated that the
resolution has already affected
the city to some extent: some
officials are not going to educa
tional institutes, except when
they want to pay for their own
bills and expenses.
"I do not know if anyone ran
financial investigations to as
certain whether the city would
be saving money or how much
money would be withheld
from the convention cities. In
reality, our officials don't travel
too much," said Rounds.
"One particular commun
ity," stated Henderson, "will
not have that much impact in
convincing a state to ratify the
ERA, but a large percentage of
communities rallying behind
such a boycott can wield
power."
The idea of a boycott is not
unique to the area. In March of
1978, the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors was the
first county in the country to
pass an ERA resolution. It pas
sed on a 3-2 vote.
Palo Alto, said Huntoon, is
the first city in Santa Clara
county to pass a boycott resol
ution.
Huntoon spent two months
trying to get the boyott passed.
She attributed the success to
"an effective job in educating
the council members and pub
licizing the endeavor."
Twenty local organizations

wrote letters in support of the
resolution. Among the groups
were people from Stanford.
Debbie De Mott, a senior
who works at the Women's
Center, said that some profes
sors wrote letters.
"We are very concerned
about ERA and women's is
sues. We support the resolu
tion passed by the Palo Alto
City Council. Perhaps some
thing similar in some capacity
could be enacted here at Stan
ford," said Kim Bancroft, a
member of the staff at the
Women's Center.
Bob Beyers, director of News
and Publications at Stanford,
said he is not aware of an at
tempt by the University to re
strict faculty members and stu
dents from going to unratified
states.
"It would be difficult to en
force because individuals fre
quently go to conferences on
their own. Also, the University
usually will take a stand against
proposals which involve re
strictions on freedom of scho
larly movements either politi
cally or academically," Beyers
said.
The Equal Rights Amend
ment has been ratified by 35
states and needs just three
more states.
Huntoon said that over 400

national organizations and
more than 30 cities and coun
ties have joined in boycott? By
resolving that no funds will be
used to send employees to
conventions in the 15 un
ratified states.
Millions of dollars in conten
tion and travel business have
been withheld trom the follow
ing states (some majorconven
tion cities lie in these states):
Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Arkansas, Illinois,
Oklahoma, Missouri, Nevada,
Utah and Arizona.
The effectiveness of the
boycott was emphasized in
February 1978, when Missouri
Attorney General )ohn
Ashcrott and Nevada Attorney
General Robert list filed suits
against NOW. They claimed
that the boycott violated the
Sherman Antitrust Act.
NOW filed counterclaim
lawsuits against the two states
alleging violations of the or
ganization's civil and constitu
tional rights. Missouri did not
accept the counterclaim but
Nevada did.
The Federal District Court
reviewed the case brought
against Missouri by NOW and
ruled in NOW's favor in a dech
sion issued Feb. 21, 1979.
The Equal Rights Amend
ment (ERA) movement is alive
and well and backers are work
ing to gain support in cities and
communities across the United
States. In fact, new steps have
been taken to promote the
issue right here in Palo Alto.
The Palo Alto City Council
passed a resolution on Nov. 19,
boycotting states which have
not ratified ERA.
According to Amy Huntoon,
a coordinator for the mid-
Peninsula chapters of the Na
tional Organization for
Women (NOW), city
employees will not get reim
bursed for travel expenses in
curred while on city business:
that is, attending conferences,
assemblies, conventions and
meetings in those states not
having passed the ERA." The
intent of the boycott is to dis
courage people from going to
unratified states, she said.
According to Palo Alto
Mayor Alan Henderson,
"There was a feeling within the
majority of the city council
members that the Equal Rights
Amendment would not be pas
sed unless pressure were put
on those states which have not
ratified the legislation."
The proposal was submitted
to the city council by council
members Emily Renzel and
Gary Razzino.
However, the resolution has
a type of "Catch-22" because,
as Henderson pointed out, if a
meeting or court proceeding is
most vital to the working of the
city, an employee will still be
able to attend.
The vote on the boycott re
solution was eight in favor,
zero opposed and one absten
tion.
Council member Lee Levy
abstained from voting. Levy
summarized his reasons by say
ing, "I do not like the idea of
voting on anything which
should be open to public dis
cussion in front of the council.
"Although many people
