## Gas stations profitable investment 
### 
Gas stations, these days, are
extraordinarily neat. They're
clean. Sparkling. And in 1979,
they became a place to meet
your neighbor at six in the
morning — in line.
For many people, the gas
lines of '79 were a fitting con
clusion to a bizarre decade. In
the past few weeks, journalists
have used such words as "seri
ous" and "uncertain" to de
scribe the '70s.
Doonesbury recently
characterized the past 10 years
as "a kidney stone of a de
cade." Yet, among the titans of
the world's oil industry, 1979
was simply a "profitable year."
So was 1978, 1977 and the
rest of the '70s. Like banks and
the phone company, the oil
cartel is not in business to lose
money, and this fact has been
reflected at an international
level.
As we enter the 1980s, the
stakes are higher in energy's
world of high finance, and Af
ghanistan and Iran are already
on the betting line.
Owners
" All of this has not been lost

on the gas station owners of
this country, who are also in
business to make money. They
are smarter than most people
think. One former station
owner, who sold his Maryland
dealership last year for a net
profit in the five figure range,
told me that station owners
love gas lines. The high de
mand allows the owner to re
duce his overhead by staying
open fewer hours and cutting
labor costs.
A lot of owners have been
unable to understand why soc
iety's attitude toward them has
shifted. Once, they were glori
ously depicted in national ad
vertisements as the "friendly"
neighborhood service station
owner, ready to strip your car
to the engine blocks at a mo
ment's notice.
Bad rap?
By the late 19705, oil com
panies were more interested in
demonstrating a sincere con
cern for the environment, than
in improving the public's
image of the dealers.
Among automobile owners,
"friendly" had been replaced

by terminology that often re
quired the use of words such as
"thieves" and "rip-off." After
all of these years, why were sta
tion owners now getting a bad
rap?
I pondered this question one
day last December, as I sat on
Santa Clara County Transit bus
No. 22 on a wet California
morning. Traffic was moving
well on El Caimino as the bus
whizzed past several gas sta
tions that were already open
and doing a brisk business.
As we paused at a stoplight, a
red Cadillac suddenly pulled
into a deserted station. Beads
of moisture glistened on the
car's polished hood, and from
my seat on the bus I could see
that the sticker listing the car's
luxuries was still attached to a
side window. A tanned gent
leman of middle age stepped
out, and began to unlock the
gas pumps. He was wearing a
shirt with "manager" stitched
in red letters above the breast
pocket.
Life aboard the 22
Life aboard the 22 bus is
rarely dull.

After several more
stops on El Camino, the bus
driver brought the vehicle to a
halt and threw off a passenger
who had been covertly smok
ing a cigarette. The teenage of
fender indignantly threw his
cigarette into the driver's was
tebasket, nearly setting it on
fire.
Who knows, perhaps mass
transit will replace Disneyland
as California's number one
tourist attraction in the 1980s.
Taking the bus home from
work that day, I arrived to find a
letter in my mailbox. It was a
curt reminder from an oil com
pany that my credit card bill
was overdue. It was that kind of
a decade, I said to myself, and
set off down the street, looking
for a gas station for sale.

whizzed past several gas sta
tions that were already open
and doing a brisk business.
As we paused at a stoplight, a
red Cadillac suddenly pulled
into a deserted station. Beads
of moisture glistened on the
car's polished hood, and from
my seat on the bus I could see
that the sticker listing the car's
luxuries was still attached to a
side window. A tanned gent
leman of middle age stepped
out, and began to unlock the
gas pumps. He was wearing a
shirt with "manager" stitched
in red letters above the breast
pocket.

After several more
stops on El Camino, the bus
driver brought the vehicle to a
halt and threw off a passenger
who had been covertly smok

cigarette into the driver's was

fire.
Who knows, perhaps mass

Taking the bus home from
work that day, I arrived to find a
letter in my mailbox. It was a
curt reminder from an oil com
pany that my credit card bill
was overdue. It was that kind of
a decade, I said to myself, and
set off down the street, looking
for a gas station for sale.

Gas stations, these days, are
extraordinarily neat. They're
clean. Sparkling. And in 1979,
they became a place to meet
your neighbor at six in the
morning — in line.
For many people, the gas
lines of '79 were a fitting con
clusion to a bizarre decade. In
the past few weeks, journalists
have used such words as "seri
ous" and "uncertain" to de
scribe the '70s.
Doonesbury recently
characterized the past 10 years
as "a kidney stone of a de
cade." Yet, among the titans of
the world's oil industry, 1979
was simply a "profitable year."
So was 1978, 1977 and the
rest of the '70s. Like banks and
the phone company, the oil
cartel is not in business to lose
money, and this fact has been
reflected at an international
level.
As we enter the 1980s, the
stakes are higher in energy's
world of high finance, and Af
ghanistan and Iran are already
on the betting line.
Owners
" All of this has not been lost

on the gas station owners of
this country, who are also in
business to make money. They
are smarter than most people
think. One former station
owner, who sold his Maryland
dealership last year for a net
profit in the five figure range,
told me that station owners
love gas lines. The high de
mand allows the owner to re
duce his overhead by staying
open fewer hours and cutting
labor costs.
A lot of owners have been
unable to understand why soc
iety's attitude toward them has
shifted. Once, they were glori
ously depicted in national ad
vertisements as the "friendly"
neighborhood service station
owner, ready to strip your car
to the engine blocks at a mo
ment's notice.
Bad rap?
By the late 19705, oil com
panies were more interested in
demonstrating a sincere con
cern for the environment, than
in improving the public's
image of the dealers.
Among automobile owners,
"friendly" had been replaced

by terminology that often re
quired the use of words such as
"thieves" and "rip-off." After
all of these years, why were sta
tion owners now getting a bad
rap?
I pondered this question one
day last December, as I sat on
Santa Clara County Transit bus
No. 22 on a wet California
morning. Traffic was moving
well on El Caimino as the bus
whizzed past several gas sta
tions that were already open
and doing a brisk business.

red Cadillac suddenly pulled
into a deserted station. Beads
