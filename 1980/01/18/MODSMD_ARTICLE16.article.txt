No on Connally
David Yob's column "Con
nally is the one" (Daily, Jan. 14)
leaves me unconvinced as to
the virtue of having Big )ohn in
the White House. Sure, )ohn
Connally "is a tough and
shrewd bargainer" (ask any
dairy association representa
tive), but that does not qualify
him for the presidency.
To me, Connally is just
another ex-governor running
for president. His record as
former President Richard Ni
xon's Secretary of the Treasury
was dismal, especially if looked
at from the perspective of the
United States' international
stature.
Connally led those who
wanted the United States to act
unilaterally on international
economic issues, without any
concern about our allies in
Europe and )apan. His re
peated attacks on the lapanese
reveal his ultranationalistic
mentality, not a more virtuous
sense of patriotism.
Connally, in short, would be
a national disaster in office.
One look at the people who

are backing him would point to
this (e.g. John Schmitz — the
American Independent Party's
1972 presidential candidate;
the one who called fellow pres
idential candidate George
McGovern an "overt radical"
and Nixon a "covert radical").
I'm not sure what America
needs at this point, but I'm cer
tain that Connally is one thing
that we do not need, now or
ever. What's good for Texas,
Schmitz and the milk industry
is not necessarily good for
America.

In his column {Daily, )an.l6),
Tom Bohr makes the point that
abortions should be an alter
native for "a family that can't
afford another child and is
trapped in the poverty/welfare
cycle," because if it doesn't
have that option it might never
be able to raise its standard of
living. What a great idea! In
fact, why don't we carry it a bit

farther?
Indeed, why should a family
that didn't have the foresight to
get rid of their child while it
was still in the womb be sad
dled with it when it's a squal
ling infant or toddler? In my
opinion, hanging should bean
alternative for these poor
families burdened with un
wanted children that are too
young yet to be turned loose to
forage for themselves.
While it takes a few minutes
for a child with his neck in a
noose to die, hanging is gener
ally less messy than garrotting
the kid and entails no great out
lay of cash for the family, as
shooting or poison might.
Kids don't weigh that much,
so an inexpensive clothesline
will probably do. In the case of
small infants, however, suf
focating with a pillow might be
easier.

I applaud the Daily for its
front page photo as well as the
article on Rosa Parks (Jan. 16)
both commemorating the birth
of Martin Luther King, Jr. I am
pleased that the Daily carried
those news stories; it is a re
minder of the anniversary of
the birth of one of the greatest
Americans to have ever lived.

Bill Kemmeries' column yes
terday was a real learning ex
perience for me. I learned that
Arabs are dangerous, Viet
namese are bizarre and vio
lent, Jews are cowardly and
money-hungry, French women
are poorly groomed, and
foreigners in general are dirty
and thieving. I also learned that
the gratuitous racism and na
tional chauvinism of the "ugly
American" are alive and thriv
ing in the Stanford under
graduate.
I am appalled the Daily

Racist Humor?
Bill Kemmeries' column yes
terday was a real learning ex
perience for me. I learned that
Arabs are dangerous, Viet
namese are bizarre and vio
lent, Jews are cowardly and
money-hungry, French women
are poorly groomed, and
foreigners in general are dirty
and thieving. I also learned that
the gratuitous racism and na
tional chauvinism of the "ugly
American" are alive and thriv
ing in the Stanford under
graduate.
I am appalled the Daily
would print Kemmeries' col
umn. And please, don't tell me
I have no sense of humor.
Bigotry and ethnocentrism
aren't funny.

No on Connally
David Yob's column "Con
nally is the one" (Daily, Jan. 14)
leaves me unconvinced as to
the virtue of having Big )ohn in
the White House. Sure, )ohn
Connally "is a tough and
shrewd bargainer" (ask any
dairy association representa
tive), but that does not qualify
him for the presidency.
To me, Connally is just
another ex-governor running
for president. His record as
former President Richard Ni
xon's Secretary of the Treasury
was dismal, especially if looked
at from the perspective of the
United States' international
stature.
Connally led those who
wanted the United States to act
unilaterally on international
economic issues, without any
concern about our allies in
Europe and )apan. His re
peated attacks on the lapanese
reveal his ultranationalistic
mentality, not a more virtuous
sense of patriotism.
Connally, in short, would be
a national disaster in office.
One look at the people who

are backing him would point to
this (e.g. John Schmitz — the
American Independent Party's
1972 presidential candidate;
the one who called fellow pres
idential candidate George
McGovern an "overt radical"
and Nixon a "covert radical").
I'm not sure what America
needs at this point, but I'm cer
tain that Connally is one thing
that we do not need, now or
ever. What's good for Texas,
Schmitz and the milk industry
is not necessarily good for
America.

In his column {Daily, )an.l6),
Tom Bohr makes the point that
abortions should be an alter
native for "a family that can't
afford another child and is
trapped in the poverty/welfare
cycle," because if it doesn't
have that option it might never
be able to raise its standard of
living. What a great idea! In
fact, why don't we carry it a bit

farther?
Indeed, why should a family
that didn't have the foresight to
get rid of their child while it
was still in the womb be sad
dled with it when it's a squal
ling infant or toddler? In my
opinion, hanging should bean
alternative for these poor
families burdened with un
wanted children that are too
young yet to be turned loose to
forage for themselves.
While it takes a few minutes
for a child with his neck in a
noose to die, hanging is gener
ally less messy than garrotting
the kid and entails no great out
lay of cash for the family, as
shooting or poison might.
Kids don't weigh that much,
so an inexpensive clothesline
will probably do. In the case of
small infants, however, suf
focating with a pillow might be
easier.

I applaud the Daily for its
