## Stanford Band held hostage 
### 
(The following is the inside story as told by one
of the captive hostages. It is the true story of the
Stanford University Red Vest Band's terrifying
hours of bondage.)
Saturday 5 a.m. — We arrive at the Seattle
Airport to catch our Hughes Airwest flight to
Spokane for the Washington State game.
Although it is quite early, the band members go
about their secret work with unparalleled skill.
By 6:30 a.m. almost every sign of any interest
in the airport is safely in our possession. Pleased
with our loot we board the waiting
McDonnell-Douglas DC9 with high hopes for
the upcoming game.
The flight goes as usual with the band imitat
ing the stewardess' emergency instructions. By
the time the plane has reached an altitude of 6000
feet, the flight crew has given up all hope of a
future career in the sky.
Following the crew's early retirement an
nouncement, the captain informs us that upon
our arrival in Spokane, no one will be allowed to
disembark until an airport official boards the
plane and delivers a special message.
Much to our surprise, once the plane is on the
ground it is boarded not by airline officials, but
by a contingent from the Spokane Police De
partment's SWAT team. The officers rush onto
the plane blocking all hope of escape through
the rear emergency exit.
As the 'normal passengers' sit stunned, the
police announce that a bandmember was spot
ted stealing a sign from the departure gate in
Seattle. "Nobody leaves this plane until the sign
is returned," croaks the overweight officer. Not
sure of which sign the police are after, and un
willing to give up all of the signs that the band
stole fair and square, a stalemate ensues.
In an act of desperation, Band Manager Bruce
Heiman, using what little was left of his alcohol
infested brain, quickly points to an innocent
businessman in a three-piece suit and shouts,
"That man — he's our faculty advisor!" Police
then drag the unfortunate victim off of the air
craft as his wife and young children cry in de
spair.
Stalemate hour six: A Red Cross doctor is al
lowed aboard to examine both the mental and
physical condition of the madcap hostages. Our
mental capacity is rapidly deteriorating since the
only things we have to do on the plane are hav
ing pillow fights and stealing liquor from the
galley. Our physical illnesses are due mostly to
the ingestion of massive quantities of drugs,
swallowed when the police first boarded the
airplane.
The doctor greatly concerned the outside
world when he reported, "All the people on the
plane will say is 'We ain't doing no more Hughes
Airwest rallies this year.' " CIA code experts are

still searching for the hidden message in those
magical words.
Stalemate hour 10: Rumor has it that negotia
tions for our release are being hampered by a
confused chain of authority. Lawyers working
for the band's release claim that while the
Hughes Airwest spokesmen have stressed the
importance of compromise, the police have
maintained a hardline of, "No signs — no stu
dents."
Meanwhile, in an attempt to gain our own
release, we have smuggled the signs off of the
plane and have mailed them to Shak Island off
the coast of Stanford. Our attempt appears to
have failed as the police insist that although we
are no longer in possession of the signs, we are
still responsible for them. Stanford University
officials have been doing their best to help us in
our desperate plight. In addition to forwarding
all of our hate mail (a real morale booster), they
have threatened economic sanctions against the
State of Washington. Apparently, the University
intends to ban all new grads from working in the
state.
A breakthrough at last. . . Tired of hearing the
theme from Star Wars, the Washington State stu
dents have arranged for our release on the con
dition that we play at basketball game to
night.
Sunday 11 a.m. — Just when we thought it was
safe to come out into the open again our trou
bles started anew. After another LSJUMB in
flight show, we arrive back in Seattle.
No sooner have we settled into waiting at the
gate for our connecting flight than an airline
official comes over and informs us that Spokane
has called to report a Hughes Airwest sign mis
sing. Until the sign is returned the band will not
be allowed to fly home, at least not on an
airplane.
This time, however, we have a slight problem.
We don't have the sign.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to convince
airline people that the LSJUMB is innocent. They
continue insisting that we return the sign and we
continue pleading innocent.
This time we may be in over our heads. Could
it be? The end of the infamous LSJUMB when we
are truly not guilty. Irony to the max.
We consider stealing another Hughes Airwest
sign so that we can return it, but drop the idea
when we spot the undercover police constantly
watching us.
Due to unknown circumstances the airline of
ficials suddenly change their minds and decide
to allow u; to fly home. Now all we have to do is
explain to San Jose Airport Officials what hap
pened to their . . .

by a contingent from the Spokane Police De
partment's SWAT team. The officers rush onto
the plane blocking all hope of escape through
the rear emergency exit.
As the 'normal passengers' sit stunned, the
police announce that a bandmember was spot
ted stealing a sign from the departure gate in
Seattle. "Nobody leaves this plane until the sign
is returned," croaks the overweight officer. Not
sure of which sign the police are after, and un
willing to give up all of the signs that the band
stole fair and square, a stalemate ensues.
In an act of desperation, Band Manager Bruce
Heiman, using what little was left of his alcohol
infested brain, quickly points to an innocent
businessman in a three-piece suit and shouts,
"That man — he's our faculty advisor!" Police
then drag the unfortunate victim off of the air
craft as his wife and young children cry in de
spair.
Stalemate hour six: A Red Cross doctor is al
lowed aboard to examine both the mental and
physical condition of the madcap hostages. Our
mental capacity is rapidly deteriorating since the
only things we have to do on the plane are hav
ing pillow fights and stealing liquor from the
galley. Our physical illnesses are due mostly to
the ingestion of massive quantities of drugs,
swallowed when the police first boarded the
airplane.
The doctor greatly concerned the outside
world when he reported, "All the people on the
plane will say is 'We ain't doing no more Hughes
Airwest rallies this year.' " CIA code experts are

still searching for the hidden message in those
magical words.
Stalemate hour 10: Rumor has it that negotia
tions for our release are being hampered by a
confused chain of authority. Lawyers working
for the band's release claim that while the
Hughes Airwest spokesmen have stressed the
importance of compromise, the police have
maintained a hardline of, "No signs — no stu
dents."
Meanwhile, in an attempt to gain our own
release, we have smuggled the signs off of the
plane and have mailed them to Shak Island off
the coast of Stanford. Our attempt appears to
have failed as the police insist that although we
are no longer in possession of the signs, we are
still responsible for them. Stanford University
officials have been doing their best to help us in
our desperate plight. In addition to forwarding
all of our hate mail (a real morale booster), they
have threatened economic sanctions against the
State of Washington. Apparently, the University
intends to ban all new grads from working in the
state.
A breakthrough at last. . . Tired of hearing the
theme from Star Wars, the Washington State stu
dents have arranged for our release on the con
dition that we play at basketball game to
night.
Sunday 11 a.m. — Just when we thought it was
safe to come out into the open again our trou
bles started anew. After another LSJUMB in
flight show, we arrive back in Seattle.
No sooner have we settled into waiting at the
gate for our connecting flight than an airline
official comes over and informs us that Spokane
has called to report a Hughes Airwest sign mis
sing. Until the sign is returned the band will not
be allowed to fly home, at least not on an
airplane.
This time, however, we have a slight problem.
We don't have the sign.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to convince
airline people that the LSJUMB is innocent. They
continue insisting that we return the sign and we
continue pleading innocent.
This time we may be in over our heads. Could
it be? The end of the infamous LSJUMB when we
are truly not guilty. Irony to the max.
We consider stealing another Hughes Airwest
sign so that we can return it, but drop the idea
when we spot the undercover police constantly
watching us.
Due to unknown circumstances the airline of
ficials suddenly change their minds and decide
to allow u; to fly home. Now all we have to do is
explain to San Jose Airport Officials what hap
pened to their . . .
(Jeffrey Maltzman, an undeclared freshman, is a
member of the Stanford Band.)
(The following is the inside story as told by one
of the captive hostages. It is the true story of the
Stanford University Red Vest Band's terrifying
hours of bondage.)
Saturday 5 a.m. — We arrive at the Seattle
Airport to catch our Hughes Airwest flight to
Spokane for the Washington State game.
Although it is quite early, the band members go
about their secret work with unparalleled skill.
By 6:30 a.m. almost every sign of any interest
in the airport is safely in our possession. Pleased
with our loot we board the waiting
McDonnell-Douglas DC9 with high hopes for
the upcoming game.
The flight goes as usual with the band imitat
ing the stewardess' emergency instructions. By
the time the plane has reached an altitude of 6000
feet, the flight crew has given up all hope of a
future career in the sky.
Following the crew's early retirement an
nouncement, the captain informs us that upon
our arrival in Spokane, no one will be allowed to
disembark until an airport official boards the
plane and delivers a special message.
