## More to crises than media tells us 
### 
The television, press and
other media are whipping up
mass hysteria for war through
their control of the dissemina
tion of information about
events in southwestern Asia.
The series of articles in the
Daily on the Afghanistan crisis
(Jan. 11, 15 and 16) is the only
information in the media that
sheds some light on the
rationale of the Soviet moves
into Afghanistan.
We need and should de
mand from the media more
background information and
verified news from which to
make judgments. We should
not allow ourselves to be man
ipulated into precipitous ac
tions based on news from "un
identified" sources and indi
vidual refugee stories th^t

might embroil us in war due to
misinformation and misun
derstanding.
The call to arms against the
Soviet Union is openly sup
ported by opinion makers like
reporters on the "Agronsky &
Co." program of Channel 9. I
appreciate their frankness.
Reflecting the opinion of a
section of the State Depart
ment as well as the Pentagon,
they advise that we openly and
unequivocally state that the
Persian Gulf, whose oil we
need, is critical to this country
and that the surrounding na
tions not be allowed to fall into
unfriendly hands—even if milit
ary action is necessary.
Nevertheless, I feel it is the re
sponsibility of the media to
supply the public with the in
formation needed for us to
make our own judgments.
Insurgent forces in the area
often referred to as the "Arc of
Crisis" are casting off feudal re
lations and foreign exploita
tion. Religious and tribal forces
together with revolutionary or
Marxist forces are continuing
to destabilize a vital area in
southwestern Asia.
With the overthrow of the
shah, Iran has moved out of
our orbit and we have lost an
important electronic base for

spying on the Soviet Union.
Apparently, Turkey will now
supply that need.
The U.S.S.R. has moved into
Afghanistan to prevent religi
ous and tribal groups from
overthrowing the present re
gime. The area in Pakistan,
where the Soviet Union main
tains these groups are being
trained and armed by the Un
ited States and China, may also
be in jeopardy.
NATO countries, with some
pressure, have agreed to sta
tion ground launching missiles
with nuclear warheads in their
territories which are aimed at
the Soviet Union.
President John Kennedy was
willing to risk nuclear war
rather than allow Soviet mis
siles in Cuba close to our
shores. The Soviet Union is wil
ling to risk world-wide censure
rather than allow the estab
lishment of a hostile govern
ment that may collaborate with
United States and China to
complete encirclement of its
borders.
The issues, as I see them,
boil down, simplistically, to: 1)
the United States and western
powers' need to protect "our"

oil, 2) the U.S.S.R.'s need to
protect its borders and 3) the
need of the countries in
southwestern Asia to break out
of the feudal-monarchic rela
tions which have exploited and
enslaved its peoples while en
riching the shahs and sheiks
we helped keep in power.
With these forces in conflict,
a clash does seem inevitable.
Should we allow ourselves to
be conditioned to accept the
inevitability of war in this
atomic age?
