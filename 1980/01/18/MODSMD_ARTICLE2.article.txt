# Food service contracts up for bids
## Search begun for new Tresidder director 
### Mike Vaska 
University officials are laying the
groundwork now for major
changes that will affect the administ
ration and food service operations of
Tresidder Memorial Union this April.
A search committee, working
through the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs, is receiving applica
tions for the soon-to-be-vacant di
rector's position at Tresidder, ac
cording to Margaret Fidler, coor
dinator of the search.
Dan Williams, director of the
union for the past seven years, will
be leaving the University in April to
take an administrative position at the
University of Oregon.
The development of specifications
for the new food services contract on
campus is the goal of the Food Policy
Advisory Group, according to Ellie
Oppenheim, food contract coor
dinator and assistant director of Tre
siddern.
Competitive bidding will take
place to determine the contractor for
food services at Encina Commons,
the Transition and Tresidder Cater
ing and the Coffee Flouse, she said.
The current contract, held by TDS, a
subsidiary of Guckenheimer Enter
prises, expires April 0.
A bid for the Coffee Flouse con
tract will be made by the ASSU, ac
cording to Council of Presidents
member Laura Mead. The ASSU Cof
fee Ftouse Task Force will develop a
bid which will be submitted to the
senate.
The task force has reviewed other
student-run eating institutions to de
velop ideas on how they should ap
proach the task of making tht> Coffee
House here student run, Mead said.
The student affairs office is con
ducting a "fairly specialized, national
search" in an effort to find candi
dates suited to the special require

ments of running Tresidder, Fidler
said.
The union director must first
realize that Tresidder is "not just a
business," she said. "It is more than
a provider of services." It is an integ
ral part of the educational develop
ment of students, she said.
The director must be able to oper
ate with a limited amount of space
and be willing to take risks to de
velop new programs involving the
nature of the plant structure, she
said. While realizing that he "might
take the wrong direction in the im
provement of plant facilities," the di
rector "needs to be a person who will
push programs" that he believes in,
she said.
A summary report of interviews
conducted for Dean of Student Af
fairs )im Lyons by graduate student in
education Ellie Chaffee stressed the
need for an administrator who could
deal with the various labor problems
like those which have faced Tresid
der in the past.
The report concluded that "We
need a diplomat, a labor relations
specialist, and a small business per
son, all in one" to direct the union.
"We need a good huckster, one
with pzazz," Fidler said. The new di
rector must be willing to push for his
ideas, but still keep in touch with the
community.
The search committee sent several
thousand application invitations in
an effort to find a replacement for
Williams. They received about 15 re
sumes in response, Fidler said. Flow
ever, she said she expects the total
number to rise to between 30 and 50
as the (an. 21 application deadline
approaches.
Once all the applications have
been received, Fidler said the search
committee will narrow the field to a
few candidates, leaving the final de

cision to Lyons.
The Food Policy Advisory Group,
developing the food service con
tracts, is "shifting through contracts
from other college unions, studies
done during the last year on Tresid
der and the current contract" in an
effort to formulate the guidelines for
the new contract, according to Op
penheim.
Bid packages will be sent out
around Feb. 10 and should be re
turned by the end of that month, she
said. In contrast to the last bidding
process, companies or other organi
zations will be allowed to bid on any
or all of three basic food operations
on campus, she said.
When the last contract was bid,
each potential contractor had to bid
on the entire group, and had no op
tion to bid one part of the package.
The fact that the Union will have
both a new food service contract and
a new director within a short tirtie
span "will not offerany serious prob
lems," said Oppenheim.
A report by the Visiting Committee
for Tresidder, composed of students
and administrators, said that "now is
the time for a new beginning." The
report depicted the Union a pace
that must find an identity on the
campus.
The report discussed the differ
ence between Tresidder as a com
munity center and as a more
student-oriented facility. It con
cluded that Tresidder should "be
come an important center, or com
mon meeting ground, for members
of the Stanford . . . community,"
with special interest given to the
needs of the students.
The incoming director will help to
shape the identity of the Union, ac
cording to Fidler. In addition, he will
face the task of reviewing use of
existing space at Tresidder and pos

sible expansion proposals, said Fi
dler.
There is a "crying need for space"
at Tresidder, she said.
According to Chaffee's summary
report, the most frequent and vehe
ment request by students, staff and
others in the community was for an
"overhaul of the physical facility."
In addition, people wanted a re
structuring of the place to make
people want to come to stay awhile,
the report said.
