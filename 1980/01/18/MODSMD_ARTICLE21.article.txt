# ON CALL

### Dianne Cahoon 
Okay, last week was a little dry, I admit. Why
don't we take a gander at a couple more
post-vacation quandaries in hopes of striking a
few jarring chords?
As usual, I glutted myself with Mom's home
cooking throughout the break and transformed
my once-firm physique into a shapeless, floating
mass. Can you recommend a fast and painless
way to shed excess weight?
-Out of Shape
Dear Roly-Poly,
I hate to have to break this abysmal news to
you, but there is no quick, easy and harmless
method known to man for permanent weight
loss. This comment does, of course, rule out
such drastic and violent measures as self
mutilation by hacking off limbs or otherwise lit
erally whittling away fatty tissue.
Frankly, your question is right up my alley.
Over the past five years, I have tried everything,
including physical abuse but short of true depri
vation, in a vain and meager attempt to pare
pounds off my bulky body. Ah-ha, now that I
have blithely confessed, you are no doubt skep
tical about the veracity of my advice. But you
should harbor no doubts. Like any coach, I am a
knowledgeable expert notwithstanding my glar
ing personal failure.
So, do as I say, not as I do. You should be wary
of the most highly touted fad diets, because
weight lost in that quirkish fashion is invariably
regained almost immediately. As a perpetual
disciple of supposedly magical remedies, I have
endured the harmonic oscillation syndrome far
too many times.
Moreover, many fast-action diets are often
detrimental to one's health. They may not pro
vide the basic nutrients necessary for sound
survival or may simply deluge one's system with
an oversupply of water (alias vital bodily fluids).
Various dietary concoctions and medical pre
scriptions available on the market may indeed
diminish appetite. Yet these formulas could de
stroy more than just hunger pangs. Besides af
fecting chemical balances, they prevent one
from consuming the proper amount of vitamins
and minerals. The liquid protein diet has, in fact,
claimed several lives. At any rate, most pill
popping dieters experience nervous tension
while on the medication and usually revert to
poor eating habits when taken off the drugs.
I guess if you can tolerate wearing ponderous
mechanisms around your girth while you strug
gle through daily routines orsubjectingyourself
to excruciating contortions, those means might
be successful. I would not, however, term such
devices "effortless" as some advertisements are
wont to say.
All right, just what should a hapless soul in
quest of a slim figure do? The real trick is to
gradually change intake and exercise patterns.
In trite but true words, you must try to decrease
your caloric consumption while increasing your
activity level. Aim fora loss of one to two pounds
per week and don't attempt to create overnight

miracles. You simply do not expend that much
energy in your sleep.
More precisely, maintain a balanced moder
ate diet, and don't sate yourself with caf
feine. You could focus on salad, but make sure
you obtain enough protein from sources such as
eggs, cottage cheese and lean meats, fish or
fowl.
The same old recipe is valid: cut down on
simple sugars and carbohydrates and concen
trate on juices and vegetables. Avoid refined
products, like white breads and sugars, in favor
of whole-grain commodities. I know this plan
may be exceedingly difficult to follow under the
restrictions imposed by dorm food services.
Perseverence, mental discipline and determina
tion are always the keys to improvement.
Hang in there, and exert some self-restraint.
You could even coerce your friends and ac
quaintances into helping you to reach your goal,
(e.g. hand slapping at the table and disapprov
ing looks). Try betting (I'm not advocating
hard-core gambling) with someone as an incen
tive. Involve yourself assiduously in many con
cerns,. If you're busy, you won't have time to
think about luscious food.
I developed the habit of watching the late
night television movies and then sleeping in
until noon over the Christmas vacation. Now I
can't seem to drift off until 3 a.m. It's a huge
struggle for me to revive myself for my 8 o'clock
class, and, more importantly, I don't think I'm
getting enough sleep. What is the normal
amount of sleep for a college student, and how
can I change my sleep schedule?
-Still Yawning
Dear Gaping Mouth,
Many interesting studies have been con
ducted on your concern. According to staff
members at Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS), there is no magic number as
sociated with the optimal amount of sleep.
Rather, that figure varies with the individual.
Thus, you shouldn't worry unduly about the
particular amount of sleep in which you indulge.
The average figure for people your age is about
seven hours per night, but anything between six
and ten is fairly common. As long as you don't
feel overly fatigued or sluggish, you're probably
getting the right amount of shut-eye.
Your second point is more complicated. A
sleep-late pattern is extremely difficult to mod
ify and can only be revised gradually. Your
three-week divergence probably did not, how
ever, instill you with a permanent and unaltera
ble sleep schedule.
have determined that some indi
viduals do function more efficiently late at night
when others prefer to sleep. You could be one
of these "night owls," in which case you would
probably experience great difficulty in staying
awake during the day.
The significant concern is to recognize your
ebb or at least energetic periods throughout the
day and to avoid scheduling important activities,
such as classes, during those times.
