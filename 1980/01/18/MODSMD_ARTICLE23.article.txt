# Hoover honors children with book exhibit
## 
### Theresa Simons 
Books featuring Mother
Goose, Miss Tittlemouse and
Little Red Riding Hood may not
be what you would expect to
see in a Hoover Museum
exhibit, but these and many
other children's books are on
display there now in honor of
1979's International Year of the
Child.
The exhibit, on display
through )an. 31, is part of the
15,000 volume Mary Schofield
collection. Schofield, a retired
librarian at the Hoover Institu
tion, has been collecting chil
dren's books from bookstores
and museums throughout the
world for the past 40 years.
In addition to the Schofield
collection, original art from the
Hoover Institution Archives is
also on display.
A large selection of Beatrix
Potter's tales constitutes one of
the finest arrangements in the
display. Included are several
books signed by Potter and
some of her original drawings
of Peter Rabbit.
Potter's books are known for
their small size. Though the
publishers wished to print
large, expensive copies of her
tales, Potter requested that all
her books be small so that chil
dren would be able to handle
them.
Also included in the Potter
display are a set of bronze,
handpainted miniature Potter
mice from Austria. The details
on the miniatures are so fine
that they can only be seen
through the magnifier pro

vided.
A collection of Little Red Rid
ing Hood books traces the
evolution of the 17th century
French tale, in which the little
girl is eaten, to the familiar
Grimms Brothers version that
tells of her rescue.
Copies of the controversial
German book, Struwwelpeter,
are also on display. The book, a
collection of stories about
naughty children such as Cruel
Frederick and Conrad the
Thumbsucker, describes terri
ble things that happen to bad
boys and girls. Conrad, for
example, has his thumbs cut
off by the big, long scissorman.
While this has created some
controversy among parents
and teachers, children gener
ally love the book, according to
Schofield.
Old toys, such as Schofield's
mother's blocks and
Schofield's own paper dolls,
complement the displays. In
the Mother Goose collection, a
pop-up book facsimile of
Lothan Meggendorfer's Doll's
House, published in 1890, fea
tures a general store, a kitchen
and a garden scene where a
lady is feeding pigeons.
The collection of books at
the museum are in several lan
guages and come in all sizes
and shapes. However, Elena
Danielson, coordinator of the
display, points out that this is
only a small sampling of
Schofield's entire collection.
"What you see here is just
the tip of the iceberg. The
other books are in her home —

just piled knee-high everyp
lace."
Schofield, a native of Palo
Alto, has assembled one of the
finest private collections of
children's books during herex
tensive travels in the United
States and Europe. Her collec
tion is diverse. Included are
rare, signed editions as well as
a series of chapbooks, small
paperbacks sold by traveling
salesmen for a few pennies in
the 19th century.
Danielson noted that the col

lection would be of primary in
terest to book collectors and to
people interested in early child
development. The display "'ls
also a good place to fiijd
memories of childhood.
Of Schofield's great interest
in children's books, Danielson
commented, "She had a very
happy childhood. Maybe that's
the reason for her interest in
children's books. I suspect that
she just didn't want to give up
her childhood."
