# ACLU fights Princeton University
## Can campuses keep politicians out? 
### 
The Washington Post
Princeton, N.J. — To the 5800
students who live behind its ivy
covered walls, Princeton Uni
versity is one of the nation's
more exclusive seats of learn
ing. To the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) it is a
company town that should be
open to anyone with a political
statement to make.
The ACLU has used its
"company town" argument to
convert a routine trespassing
charge filed against a member
of the U.S. Labor Party two
years ago into an unusual free
speech issue with national im
plications.
The case could decide
whether hundreds of private
schools across the United
States — and possibly indust
rial "campuses" as well — can
continue to choose whether
they want to open or close
their grounds to various politi
cal advocates.
A measure of the interest in
the legal contest — which has
pitted former U.S. Attorney
General Nicholas Katzenbach
against constitutional scholar
Stanford Levinson — was the
decision of the New Jersey
Supreme Court to bypass the
normal state judicial appeals
procedure and hear the case
itself within the next few
months.
Technically, the case pits the
state of New Jersey against
Chris Schmid, a Labor Party
member convicted of trespass
and fined $15 for handing out
leaflets on the Princeton cam
pus in 1978. The university,
however, has entered the case
as an "intervenor" and will
argue its position before the
courts.
Schmid was arrested for
trespassing after he and
another Labor Party member
began passing out leaflets on
Labor Party candidates in
volved in 1978 state and na
tional elections. The university
charged that the Labor Party
members ignored a require
ment that they had to be in
vited onto the campus by
someone connected with the
school.

Levinson and the legal team
representing Schmid have
taken the position that Prince
ton, despite its private status,
constitutes a "company town"
and unlike private property is
subject to the First Amend
ment. The argument, accord
ing to representatives from
both sides, is without prece
dent.
The ACLU argument would
mean Princeton and numerous
other private schools, particu
larly those with small enroll
ments where students live on
campus, would be thrown
open in much the same man
ner as public institutions such
as UC-Berkeley or large state
schools.
Levinson noted that, if the
court's ruling was broad
enough, it also could encom
pass so-called industrial cam
puses that do not have a live-in
population but do have many
of the amenities found on col
lege campuses.
The university and the state
of New Jersey contend that
Princeton is a private institu
tion and is entitled to enforce
its own set of rules governing
access to its campus, which is
private property.
The case, which has received
almost no publicity, has
nevertheless caused some dis
comfort among members of
Princeton's faculty and staff

who are aware of its existence.
"I think you are bound to
feel uncomfortable appearing
to argue against free speech,
whether or not the facts back
up that appearance," Katzen
bach said in an interview this
week.
"Princeton is clearly being
put in a position of saying that
the interests of the university
override the commitment to
the unfettered debate of dissi
dent political ideas," Levinson
said.
In their court brief, Schmid's
attorneys argued that Prince
ton's 5800 students are mostly
housed on the university's
campus and that the campus
has all the attributes of a com
pany town.
"Not only do under
graduates live and do their
work primarily on university
grounds," the brief said, "they
also worship, eat, play, mail
letters, cash checks, buy
books, clothing and records,
visit museums, attend films,
plays and concerts and receive
counselling and medical care
on campus."
Princeton also has a univer
sity store, a radio station, a
newspaper and a security force
on the campus, the ACLU at
torneys said.
"By the standards of New
York City, Princeton University
is not a town," the ACLU brief

said. "But there are literally
thousands of municipalities ac
ross this land who have fewer
of the indicia of autonomous
identity than does Princeton
A key point in the ACLU ar
gument, according to Levin
son, is the fact that most
Princeton students are eligible
to vote. "There is a direct First
Amendment interest," he said,
"that people be able to get to
the voters with all the relevant
information."
A university spokesman de
nied this week that the policy
in effect at the time of Schmid's
arrest was designed to exclude
any particular groups from the
campus. But he said the policy
was changed last year "as a di
rect result of the Labor Party
case."
Under the new Princeton
policy, outside political and re
ligious groups are allowed on
the school's campus after get
ting permission from school
officials, the spokesman said.
He said the only requirement is
that they follow behavior rules
drawn up by the school.
In its brief to the court,
Princeton noted that unlimited
outside access to the school's
campus would disrupt the
educational environment,
erode its "essential freedom"
and cut back on the diversity
that private schools add to the
concept of private education.
