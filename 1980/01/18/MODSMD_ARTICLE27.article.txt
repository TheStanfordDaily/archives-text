# Recession just around corner

New York (AP) â€” Forty-four percent of all
families reporting to University of Michigan
economists last November said they were worse
off financially than they were a year earlier.
Their plight was well known: high prices, cre
dit overextensions, and paychecks that didn't
keep pace with inflation. Measures of consumer
confidence in that month were near all-time
lows.
At nearly the same time, The Conference
Board, a nonprofit research organization, mea
sured business confidence at its lowest since
1976. Only 20 percent of 1600 chief executives
felt profits would improve.
All this gray gloom was spread upon the
economic landscape even though, as we know
now, the economy was still expanding. The re
cession had not yet come, in spite of all the

assumptions that it had.
And yet, if we still have faith in forecasts, the
worst is to come. Industrial economists say it,
bank economists say it, academics say it and the
President of the United States is expected to say
it.
Congress isn't scheduled to receive President
Jimmy Carter's budget and economic report
until near the end of the month, but the broad
contents are known: double digit inflation con
tinuing, and unemployment rising from under
six percent to about 7.5 percent in the final quar
ter of 1980.
With all this as background, therefore, how
can individuals, businesses and elected officials
lay any activist plans? And the answer is: They
cannot and in many instances they are not.
