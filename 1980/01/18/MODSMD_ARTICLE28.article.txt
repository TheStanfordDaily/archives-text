# The 						Moscow Olympics: will America be there?
## No matter what anybody says, politics and athletics do mix

It started in 1936 at Berlin
when Adolf Hitler refused to
stand as Jesse Owens, an
American black, bent to re
ceive his gold medal. It flip
flopped in 1968 at Mexico City
when )ohn Carlos and Tommy
Smith each raised the clenched
fist of "Black Power" over his
head as the national anthem
played to their accomplish
ments. It continued in 1972 at
Munich when Palestinian ter
rorists infiltrated the Olympic
village and took members of
the Israeli team hostage. It per
sisted in Montreal only four
years ago with the sudden Afri
can boycott.

News analysis

That "it" of course is the
political intervention of na
tions into the Olympic games,

and now, in 1980, "it" still
plagues the quintessence of
amateur athletics.
Politics has permeated the
Olympics ever since the celeb
ration has involved nations
with flags and national an
thems. Only in the last 10
years, however, has the Olym
piad been increasingly bastar
dized from a spectacle of
global cooperation to a forum
for conflicting foreign policies.
This year, with the possibility
of a U.S. boycott imminent in
reaction lo the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, the marriage of
politics and sport has been
blown to dangerous propor
tions; dangerous to the future
of the Olympics themselves.
Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance said Monday night in an
interview with Bernard
Gwertzman of The New York
Times that if the Soviets do not
pull-out of Afghanistan by

mid-February they can expect
the likelihood of an American
boycott of the games this
summer in Moscow. That
statement reflects the official
sentiments of the Carter ad
ministration.
The ultimatum carries with it

It might be the greatest disappointment of
my life . . . but I gotta believe America is
right.
-Swimmer John Simons

even dimmer circumstances,
though, as a U.S. boycott
would probably set off a "free
world" domino effect of
further boycotts. An Olympics
without the United States,
which sports many of the best
athletes in the world, would be
meaningless enough as a world
championship, but the sub

traction as well of France, Bri
tain, Italy or any other country
from the games would destroy
the Olympic concept
alogether.
Vancedid not sound hopeful
in the interview of any im
mediate success with the

Soviets saying that, "If they did
(pull out) of Afghanistan that
would be a good thing. I don't
believe that is going to happen
in the near future, but I would
like to be proven wrong."
At this point, concerning
solutions, the Carter administ
ration is talking about the pos
sibility of setting up "Free
World Olympics" as a substi
tute for Moscow which would
involve seeking international
support. The New York Times
news service reports the Inter
national Olympic Committee
(IOC) has asserted that physi
cally the games cannot be
moved but administration offi
cials maintain that with support
from a majority of the commit
tee members, a move to a more
acceptable city could be made.
But that is still far from per
fect. A "Free World Olympics"
would still present the prob
lem of missing athletes and the
concept only underlines the
political split between "free"
and communist blocs which
the Olympics are, for a time at
least, supposed to mend.
Linda Jezek, Stanford's
world - record - holding
backstroker who is favored to
win a gold medal, said yester
day that a "Free World Olym
pics" would be better than no
thing, but added, "It would't
be the same. It would be just

like the Pan-American games,
nothing more."
Any solution beyond a Soviet
pull out from Afghanistan
would seem to compromise
the Olympic principles of
world competition and coop
eration; the reason being that
any way it is looked at one
country or another probably
would not attend. The U.S.
threatens boycott now, but
were the site changed and
were the U.S. then to go, Rus
sia probably would not.
At this point, the seemingly
inevitable union of politics and
the Olympics will probably
taint the latter and the athletes
have to decide how they feel.
Jezek, visibly shaken during
an interview on Wednesday
said, "It's my goal, it's the ulti
mate. It's the whole thing I've
been working for all these
years. If I can't go, I can't ever
know for sure what I could
have done."
When asked what she
thought of the politics in
volved, she said, "There's
probably a good reason for it,
but I don't see it. I also know
that's selfish. I will back my
country, though, because it
(the situation in Afghanistan)
might be more important. But
I've devoted eight years of my
life to this and I can't help
wondering 'what if a boycott
doesn't do any good'; then it's
all wasted.
"I'm really upset."
Skip Kenney, the Stanford
men's swimming coach, was a
bit less patriotic.
"I see what these swimmers
go through day after day after
day after day, and I think it's
very wrong to take away their
dreams. They say it means the
lives of a lot of people on the
other side of the world but I
still feel it's terrible to ruin
these athletes' lives. I spent
time in the marines with a year
of combat and I've seen that,
but you can't ruin the lives of
these people," Kenney said.
That politics and the East-
West conflict are nothing new
in amateur sports seems ap

parant.
"The politics are always
there," said Olympic water
polo hopeful Jody Campbell,
"and in all the sports. In Yugos
lavia when we played a tour
nament there last year, the pre
team meetings always involved
who the referees were and
what countries they were from
because the communists re
feree differently for us.
Campbell added that, "At
this point if the Olympics were
held I think there would be the
same type of hostile environ
ment people say there was in
Berlin with Hitler. Something
horrible could happen like in
Munich. I don't think politics
should be involved in sports
but the Olympics can't take
priority at this point. But from
an athlete's point of view it's
unfair."
john Simons, a national
champion breaststroker and
the best swimmer on the men's
team, echoed his peers' pat
riotism.
"Every time NBC plays the
Olympic song, chills run up

and down my spine. It might be
the greatest disappointment
of my life if I was denied the,
chance to go. But I gotta be
lieve that America is right and I,
don't have any choice but to
support my country.
"What I'd really like to do is
go over and beat the Russians
on their own turf. I think a
boycott should be the last re
sort. They should try abso-j
lutely everything in between
before that," Simons added.
Nancy White, a shoo-in for
the Olympic field hockey
team, declined comment ex
cept to say that, "I don't know
enough now and it could all
change. But it's upsetting."
It's unfortunate that the
Olympics must be marred by
the antics of cold war politics,
but it's also naive to expect that
intervention to disappear. The
fact remains that the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan during
an Olympic year has set up a
political clash destined to ruin
the 1980 summer Olympic
games and maybe many to
come. Pitifully it's the athletes
that must lose.
