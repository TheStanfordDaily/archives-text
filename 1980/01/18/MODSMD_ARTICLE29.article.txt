# USOCers not holding their breath

Publicly, organizers of the United States Olympics effort are
mounting a furious counterattack against suggestions that the
1980 Moscow summer games be boycotted as a reprisal for the
Soviet invasion of Atghanistan. Privately, they are fairly well con
vinced that the boycott talk will blow over.
Barring a new dramatic worsening of the international situa
tion, leaders of the United States Olympic Committee said they
thought that President Jimmy Carter's mention of a possible
boycott by U.S. athletes would remain just that — a mention.
But in the meantime, some USOC sources reported, private
fundraising for the American Olympic team has been hurt to a
small extent and there has been a very minor upset of a few
training schedules for athletes worried that they may not be able
to participate in the summer games.
Checks with various sources in the American Olympics Move
ment in the last two days generally revealed no great alarm that
American participation in the games has been, at this point at
least, seriously jeopardized.
Boycott 'subversive'
I he president of the USOC, Robert Kane, while describing a
boycott of the Moscow games as "subversive" to world Olympic
ideals ot peaceful, nonpolitical athletic competition, expressed
confidence that the American effort of preparing for the games
would continue on schedule and ultimately be fully funded.
the original USOC quadrennial budget of 1976-80, looking
lorward not only to the summer games in Moscow but also to the
winter games next month at Lake Placid, N.Y., was $26 million.
But without public announcement, the USOC has upped that to a
figure in excess of $4 ? million. This is a reflection of unexpected
fundraising successes in the past few years.
USOC officials interviewed were explicit in their warnings that
il an Americ an boycott of the Moscow games were to take place, a
Soviet boycott of the Los Angeles games in 1984 would have to be
expected in reprisal.
leading organizers of the Los Angeles games declined com
ment on the boycott possibilities. But they are known to be
concerned about the effect a boycott would have on their own
effort.
No USA, no NBC
I he NBC television network reportedly has informed the
LJSOC that should the American team not go to Moscow for any

reason, it would be highly unlikely that NBC would carry forward
with its plans to televise the Moscow games.
NBC carries insurance with Lloyd's of London for 90 percent
reimbursement of the $87 million paid to the Soviet Union for the
rights and equipment to telecast the games, should it not be able
to go ahead with the telecast.
In recent days, top-ranking USOC officials, most ot the na
tional sports tederations and the American members of the Inter
national Olympic Committee have publicly decried the pos
sibility of a boycott. Their contention has been that politics
should not be allowed to mix with the Olympic movement.
Much the same thing has been said by the leaders of the
International Olympic Committee abroad.
Governments involved
fhe talk of no political interference, however, flies in the face
of repeated solicitation by Olympic organizers in recent years of
government aid for the various games.
The Moscow games are almost wholly a project of the Soviet
government, with high government officials occupying key posts
on the organizing committee. At the Montreal games in 1976,
government agencies contributed more than $1 billion, and at the
Lake Placid winter games, nearly two-thirds of the financing is
governmental.
Despite much talk that the Los Angeles games are a private
venture, the administration of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley
has already solicited $141.5 million in federal aid and has plans to
ask for state aid and federal security aid.
Not only does such financial involvement increase political
influence over the Olympics, but frequently the lOC and other
Olympics groups ask for governmental advice on problems be
setting the Olympic movement.
For instance, last fall the lOC asked the U.S. State Department
for its views on which Chinese team — the Nationalists on Taiwan
or those representing the mainland — to admit to this year's
games. When the State Department suggested the mainland
team, the lOC Executive Board was quick to comply.
Thus, political ties are considerable, and there is little doubt
that if President Carter does ask the USOC to boycott the Mos
cow games, it would feel constrained to do so, despite any lack of
legal requirement that it honor the request.
For now, however, USOC officials are trying to bring influence
to bear to ensure that there will be no such request, and their best
evaluation that it is unlikely there will be one.
