# Officials say students in 'academic rut'
## Universities bringing back requirements 
### Andrea James 
Universities across the country,
including Stanford, are trying to re
vive the pre-1970 philosophy that
students should be required to take a
well-rounded curriculum.
Next year freshmen here may be
required to read classics and take
language, math and physical science
courses before they graduate. Har
vard and Yale recently strengthened
their requirements and UC-Berkeley
administrators are also proposing a
more structured undergraduate cur
riculum.
For most of these schools, such
strict requirements haven't been in
effect since the late 1960s when
educators "liberated" students from
many required courses.

News analysis

But during the last 10years, school
officials have found their students
getting into an academic rut, with
science majors leaving school expert
in the laws of physics but ignorant of
Voltaire, Marx or the Bible and
humanities majors graduating with
out ever taking a math course.
"In a sense it's a step backwards,
but it's like a step back to 50 cents a
gallon for gasoline. It's a good thing
todo, " said |ohn Perry, a philosophy
professor here.
"Students come here with a career
already in mind," he continued. "As
a result, over the last 10 years 'free
dom of selection' has often meant
takingalotof specialty courses that
reflect a narrow interest of the fa
culty. But part of a university educa

tion is to get a good exposure to al
ternatives. In this respect, the re
quirements are liberating."
Perry chaired Stanford's commit
tee on the Western Culture Program,
a year-long sequence of courses that
gives students a smattering of litera
ture, religious studies and history.
Vote Wednesday
Faculty members will vote Wed
nesday whether to make the prog
ram a requirement for next year's en
tering freshmen. It has been an op
tional course for students during the
last two years, and about 35 percent
of the entering freshmen enrolled
each year.
Stanford may also change the re
quired curriculum for under
graduates, making students take at
least one course in the fine arts,
philosophy and religion, human de
velopment and language, social pro
cesses, math, natural sciences and
applied sciences.
If the faculty votes in favor of these
proposed requirements Wednesday,
it will be the biggest change in the
undergraduate curriculum here
since 1969 when strict requirements
were dropped.
Harvard among first
While plans for strengthening re
quired curricula has been discussed
at many schools during the last few
years, Harvard was one of the first to
make the actual changes. Last year,
the school tightened up its required
general education core so that stu
dents now enroll in one class from
each of 10 fields. This core take?
about one-fourth of a student's un
dergraduate career to complete.

"When we implemented the prog
ram, many people called it going
back to the basics,' but that wasn't
really the case here," said |ohn Har
vey, Harvard's assistant director of
general education.
"We've had a general education
requirement for 35 years. For us, it
was just a revision and redefinition of
general education. It wasn't a rever
sal of something we did in the late
19605, as it was at many schools."
UC-Berkeley was one such school
that eased its requirements during
the late 19605.
Median?
"We had rigorous distribution re
quirements then and very relaxed
ones in the 19705," said Hal Felker,
supervisor of college advisers in the
College of Letters and Sciences
there. "I'd say the current proposal
has found a median position."
A Berkeley proposal would require
students to take a reading com
prehension course and a foreign lan
guage, plus eight other courses di
vided among the schools outside the
major.
In the 19705, the student needed
only eight courses outside the major.
All of them could have been in one
field if the student so desired.
Yale, Princeton and Northwestern
have distribution requirements simi
lar to the ones that were changed at
Harvard and may soon be changed at
Stanford. Students must take a writ
ing course, plus three classes each in
social sciences, humanities and
natural sciences.
Administrators here and at Har

vard have found this program too
vague, however, because students
could graduate without taking math,
art, music or other subjects that lib
eral arts advocates have deemed
necessary for a well-rounded educa
tion.
Stanford made plans to further
strengthen its curriculum by adding
the Western Culture requirement
after administrators surveyed former
students and found that they had
liked the program.
The old Western Civilization
course was eliminated in 1969 as part
of the curriculum revamping that re
laxed academic requirements.
Vaulable thing?
"We found that those in the re
quired Western Civilization course
looked back on it as a valuable thing
and that those who came to Stanford
after the program was abolished said
they were sorry they missed it," Perry
sajd.
Today's students greet the prop
osed changes with mixed feelings.
Some students in science fields such
as engineering where considerable
work loads are required for gradua
tion in that major see the courses as a
heavy, unnecessary burden. But
others look forward to the break
from a solid science curriculum.
One sophomore who chose to
take the pilot Western Culture prog
ram this year said he found it to be a
"necessary ingredient" in the math
saturated curriculum he needs for
his computer science major.
