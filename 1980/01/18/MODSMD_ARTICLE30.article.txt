Ottawa (AP) — The Summer
Olympics might be yanked out
of Moscow by the International
Olympic Committee despite
reported denials by lOC Presi
dent Lord Killanin, says Dick
Pound, president of the Cana
dian Olympic Association. And
Julian Roosevelt, an lOC dele
gate from the United States ag
rees.
Pound and Roosevelt said
Tuesday that anything could
happen at an lOC meeting Feb.
10-12 in Lake Placid, N.Y., just
priot to the opening of the
Winter Olympics.
It's the lOC's firs Hull meet
ing since the Soviet Union's in
vasion of Afghanistan and the
subsequent condemnation by
the United Nations.
"The matter will be discus
sed thoroughly and there
could be a resolution" to with
draw the Games, said Pound,
wno is one of two Canadian
lOC delegates.
In Britain, more than 100 MPs
from all major political parties
have signed motions calling for

the Games to be boycotted or
moved.
One motion said bluntly:
The 1980 Olympic Games
should be held somewhere
else other than Moscow.
Roosevelt said in an inter
view from Long Island, N.Y.,
that it is difficult to assess the
mood of delegates now be
cause the political situation is
rapidly changing.
Prime Minister Clark has
states that he would prefer the
Games be moved rather than
boycotted. So far only Saudi
Arabia has chosen that route.
Doubtful support
Pound said last week that the
Canadian Olympic Association
would defy a federal boycott
unless the athletes were in
physical danger. And an official
of the British association said
he doubted that British
athletes would support a
boycott.
External Affairs Minister
Flora Mac Donald said in
Montreal Monday that moving
the Olympics would be one of
the best ways to bring pressure

on the Soviet Union by making
its citizens aware of their gov
ernment's activities.
Mac Donald also threatened
to bar Soviet hockey teams
from playing in Cnnada.
Such a move would seriously
affect the Canada Cup tourna
ment scheduled in September
between European teams and
the National Hockey League.
'No mix'
But Lord Killanin has stated
repeatedly that the Games will
not be moved out of Moscow
because sports and politics
don't mix.
"We won't go back on our
word," he said in a weekend
interview. "In any event it
would be physically impossible
to change the venue."
Roosevelt said it boils down
to money.
"There's noothercity
to take the Games," he said.
"And if they found one willing,
the Games would probably',
have to be put off for a year." «'
The lOC also has a contract*
with Moscow that would cost!
the association millions to_
break, Killanin said.
