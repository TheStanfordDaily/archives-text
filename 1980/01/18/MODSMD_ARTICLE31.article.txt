# Cagers try to pick themselves up
## SPORTS 
### Robert Stone 
When a Daily writer recently
entered the locker room where
the men's basketball team was
dressing, the door was slam
med behind him with the cry,
"Let's get him." The light was
almost shut out as the towering
hoopsters gathered around the
scared young reporter.
After a tew agonizing mo
ments it became apparent that
the incident was in jest, much
to the relief of the writer. How
ever, it seems to indicate that
the squad feels that it hasn't
gotten a fair shake in the cam
pus media, that they've been
kicked while being down.
Tomorrow at Maples Pavil
ion the Cardinals have an op
portunity to pick themse'ves
up and stay out of the Pacific-10
Conference cellar when they
host California at 2: iO p.m.
NBC will be on hand to provide
regional coverage of the 19ird
meeting of the Bay Area rivals.
Both squads need a win in
order to climb out of the bot
tom of the Pac-10 standings,
the position presently held by
Cal. TheC.olden Bears are win
less in conterence play, drop
ping six Pac-10 games since
December 28th.
The Cards remain a game
ahead by virtue ol a 99-80 vic
tory over Arizona earlier this
month, leaving them at 1-5 in
the league ranks. Overall, both
the Cards and the Bears sport
<-11 records.
It will be a week since the
Cardinals have last played, a
102-74 thrashing at Washington
state. Alter leading three times
and ending the halt with the
score tied at 41, the team suf
lered a defensive breakdown
that allowed the Cougars to
run up 61 points. Stanlord was
also beaten on the boards, with
WSU outrebounding the Cards
52-14 on the night.
The layotl might have given

the team a chance to regroup
for the remainder of the sea
son.
"I think it (the layoff) will
help us. At this time in the sea
son the body needs to rejuve
nate," noted assistant coach
Tim Miller, who continued,
"We only took one day off
(trom practice). We're actually
getting the same amount ot
practice as we would if we were
playing."
Miller is jointly running the
practices with the other assis
tants in piace ot head coach
Dick Dißiaso, who is on the
road recruiting.
The starting lineup for the
Cardinals tentatively lists
b-toot-7 Kimberly Belton and
6-7 Brian Welch at forwards, 6-8
sophomore Orlando Ward at
center. 6-2 soph Doug Marty at
guard and either 6-2 senior
Doug Barnes or 6-4 sophomore
lerrv Smith in the other
backcourt spot.
Belton, the senior All-
America candidate, has consis
tently been the team's bright
spot all season. Averaging 18
points and 10.2 rebounds a
game, he scored eight tield
goals and hit seven of seven
Irom the free-throw line
against WSU.
Welch, a sophomore, is sec
ond in scoring lor the team
with a 14.4 scoring average
while connecting on 73 per
cent of his foul shots.
Belton is currently Stanford's
tilth all-time scorer with 1380
points, and second leading
career rebounder with 841. At
the present rate he will most
likely end his collegiate career
atop both lists.
Asked it this added any pres
sure on his performance, he
responded, "No, I just go out
and play my game. I've just
been happy to play these tour
years."
Across the Bay, Cal's head

coach Dick Kuchen is contend
ing with the inexperience or a
group in which seven of its 15
members are freshmen.
"Whenever you have as
young a team as we do, there's
a problem in getting over the
hump to win basketball
games," the second-year men
tor noted.
Cal's starting live teatures
three treshmen and a sopho
more, a situation that Kuchen
pointed out is caused by a lack
ot upperclassmen in the prog
ram. He also said that this is
providing the young players
with experience. "I think
everyone is moving in the right
direction," he added.
Unlike Stanford, Cal has
played twice since the 12th: an
81-64 loss at Washington State
last Monday, and a 73-70 win in
Santa Clara Wednesday, snap

ping an eight-game losing
streak. In the WSU game the
Bears performed much like
Stanford, recovering from an
early eight point deficit to keep
the score close in the tirst hall.
However, the Cougars utilized
the last break in the* second
half to widen the gap and seal
the victory.
The ireshman lineup lor Cal
places 5-9 Mike Chavez at
guard, 6-7 Darrell Haley at tor
ward and 6-11 Michael Pitts at
center.
Chavez is regarded as an
adept ball-handler with impre
ssive quickness, while Haley is
known tor good team play and
solid defense. Pitts, a nation
ally recognized high-school
star last year, is averaging 11.5
points and 7.6 rebounds,
"Pitts is a good player adjust
ing well to this level of compet

ition,' Miller remarked, "but
we don't expect him to present
more problems than any other
center we've lac ed."
Rounding out the starting
live will be 6- < soph* 'inori' N t<>'
Holland in the bac keen
6-8 senior forward Doug In.
Kuchen was particularly prai l
ing ol True.
"True is the guy in the lead
ership role," Kuchen said, lis
been difficult lor him with the
freshmen in there. I feel he's
really progressed over the
course ot the season." True is
currenty leading the team with
14.7 points and 9.7 rebounds
per game.
Saturday's game shapes up
as an evenly-matched contest
between two young teams in a
"must" game in terms ol keep
ing out ot the league base
ment.
Although Cal has a 115-77
lead in the series, Stanford
swept both games last year.
Emotion will probably play a
part in this year's mate h.
Kuchen observed, "Anytime
you get Cal and Stanford to
gether lor a couple ol basket
ball games, people are going to
be up."
Card forward Orlando Ward
confirmed this, saying, "I think
it will be a pretty emotional
game, both teams want this
win pretty bad."
II the Cards play with Hie ler
vor with which they respond to
raps in the press, the season
might be turned around.

Across the Bay, Cal's head

coach Dick Kuchen is contend
ing with the inexperience or a
group in which seven of its 15
members are freshmen.
"Whenever you have as
young a team as we do, there's
a problem in getting over the
hump to win basketball
games," the second-year men
tor noted.
Cal's starting live teatures
three treshmen and a sopho
more, a situation that Kuchen
pointed out is caused by a lack
ot upperclassmen in the prog
ram. He also said that this is
providing the young players
with experience. "I think
everyone is moving in the right
direction," he added.
Unlike Stanford, Cal has
played twice since the 12th: an
81-64 loss at Washington State
last Monday, and a 73-70 win in
Santa Clara Wednesday, snap

ping an eight-game losing
streak. In the WSU game the
Bears performed much like
Stanford, recovering from an
early eight point deficit to keep
the score close in the tirst hall.
However, the Cougars utilized
the last break in the* second
half to widen the gap and seal
the victory.
The ireshman lineup lor Cal
places 5-9 Mike Chavez at
guard, 6-7 Darrell Haley at tor
ward and 6-11 Michael Pitts at
center.
Chavez is regarded as an
adept ball-handler with impre
ssive quickness, while Haley is
known tor good team play and
solid defense. Pitts, a nation
ally recognized high-school
star last year, is averaging 11.5
points and 7.6 rebounds,
"Pitts is a good player adjust
ing well to this level of compet

ition,' Miller remarked, "but
we don't expect him to present
more problems than any other
center we've lac ed."
Rounding out the starting
live will be 6- < soph* 'inori' N t<>'
Holland in the bac keen
6-8 senior forward Doug In.
Kuchen was particularly prai l
ing ol True.
"True is the guy in the lead
ership role," Kuchen said, lis
been difficult lor him with the
freshmen in there. I feel he's
really progressed over the
course ot the season." True is
currenty leading the team with
14.7 points and 9.7 rebounds
per game.
Saturday's game shapes up
as an evenly-matched contest
between two young teams in a
"must" game in terms ol keep
ing out ot the league base
ment.
Although Cal has a 115-77
lead in the series, Stanford
swept both games last year.
Emotion will probably play a
part in this year's mate h.
Kuchen observed, "Anytime
you get Cal and Stanford to
gether lor a couple ol basket
ball games, people are going to
be up."
Card forward Orlando Ward
confirmed this, saying, "I think
it will be a pretty emotional
game, both teams want this
win pretty bad."
II the Cards play with Hie ler
vor with which they respond to
raps in the press, the season
might be turned around.

When a Daily writer recently
entered the locker room where
the men's basketball team was
dressing, the door was slam
med behind him with the cry,
"Let's get him." The light was
almost shut out as the towering
hoopsters gathered around the
scared young reporter.
After a tew agonizing mo
ments it became apparent that
the incident was in jest, much
to the relief of the writer. How
ever, it seems to indicate that
the squad feels that it hasn't
gotten a fair shake in the cam
pus media, that they've been
kicked while being down.
Tomorrow at Maples Pavil
ion the Cardinals have an op
portunity to pick themse'ves
up and stay out of the Pacific-10
Conference cellar when they
host California at 2: iO p.m.
NBC will be on hand to provide
regional coverage of the 19ird
meeting of the Bay Area rivals.
Both squads need a win in
order to climb out of the bot
tom of the Pac-10 standings,
the position presently held by
Cal. TheC.olden Bears are win
less in conterence play, drop
ping six Pac-10 games since
December 28th.
The Cards remain a game
ahead by virtue ol a 99-80 vic
tory over Arizona earlier this
month, leaving them at 1-5 in
the league ranks. Overall, both
the Cards and the Bears sport
<-11 records.
It will be a week since the
Cardinals have last played, a
102-74 thrashing at Washington
state. Alter leading three times
and ending the halt with the
score tied at 41, the team suf
lered a defensive breakdown
that allowed the Cougars to
run up 61 points. Stanlord was
also beaten on the boards, with
WSU outrebounding the Cards
52-14 on the night.
The layotl might have given

the team a chance to regroup
for the remainder of the sea
son.
"I think it (the layoff) will
help us. At this time in the sea
son the body needs to rejuve
nate," noted assistant coach
Tim Miller, who continued,
"We only took one day off
(trom practice). We're actually
getting the same amount ot
practice as we would if we were
playing."
Miller is jointly running the
practices with the other assis
tants in piace ot head coach
Dick Dißiaso, who is on the
road recruiting.
The starting lineup for the
Cardinals tentatively lists
b-toot-7 Kimberly Belton and
6-7 Brian Welch at forwards, 6-8
sophomore Orlando Ward at
center. 6-2 soph Doug Marty at
guard and either 6-2 senior
Doug Barnes or 6-4 sophomore
lerrv Smith in the other
backcourt spot.
Belton, the senior All-
America candidate, has consis
tently been the team's bright
spot all season. Averaging 18
points and 10.2 rebounds a
game, he scored eight tield
goals and hit seven of seven
Irom the free-throw line
against WSU.
Welch, a sophomore, is sec
ond in scoring lor the team
with a 14.4 scoring average
while connecting on 73 per
cent of his foul shots.
Belton is currently Stanford's
tilth all-time scorer with 1380
points, and second leading
career rebounder with 841. At
the present rate he will most
likely end his collegiate career
atop both lists.
Asked it this added any pres
