## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
"We II have a whole pool full of Olympic hopefuls,"
prophesized Card men's swimming coach Skip Kenney on to
morrows meet at deGuerre with powerful age group squad from
Mission Viejo Natadores.
Renowned coach Mark Schubert s team has dominated na
tional AAU competition since 1975. The women captured the U.S.
long c ourse last summer, while their male counterparts finished
second in that same collossal affair.
Prodigy lesse Vassallo, the world record holder in the 400 and
200 meter individual medleys, will head a group containing na
tional 200 meter backstroke champion Steve Barnicoat and Brazi
lian import Dgan Madruga, a 1500 meter freestyle finalist in the
Montreal Olympics and an emerging threat in the 400 IMand the
200 and 400 freestyle events.
Vassallo alone is a truly amazing athlete. "He can do anything
except breaststroke," claimed asistant coach Stu Corliss.
On the women s side, the Natadores feature distance treestyler
Mary Beth I in/meier, former Stanford sprinter and Olympic gold
medalist Kim Peyton and Denmark's Suzanne Nielsen, a
breaststroker described as "very fast" by Card women's coach
Claudia Thomas.
Vet, the diving tank will easily rival the pool in phenomenal
talent. Olympic three-meter springboard champion lennv Chan
dler tops a four-woman, four-man Mission Viejo corps com
prised ex< lusively of national champions.
Neither team is prepared to rest from its hec tic training pace at
this point in the season, so the swimmers will be tired but still
impressive. " This is just a c hance to get people to swim (against
challenging < ompetition) during the middle ol training," Thomas
said.
The Olympic preview will begin with diving at noon, and the
swimming will commence at I p.m.
