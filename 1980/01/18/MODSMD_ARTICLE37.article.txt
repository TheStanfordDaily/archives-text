# The 						Friday Interview
## Aztecs' pro bait lures McNevin off Farm 
### 
Today 's quiz: name the Stan
ford athlete who, after being
named all-conference for his
play this past fall, was drafted
and will play for a pro team.
Turk Schnoert? Chuck Evans?
No, the football draft is not
until May. The answer is soccer
midfielder Dan McNevin. The
junior was drafted by the Los
Angeles Aztecs and is stopping
out of Stanford to play for the
North American Soccer League
team.
M,cNevin discussed his
chances in the pros, his deci
sion to stop out and his feel
ings about his move with Sally
lenkins for this week's Friday
interview.
lenkins: Were you surprised
at being drafted, or was it
something you expected?
McNevin: Well it's hard to say
who's interested in you. Most
teams were not interested in
me as a prospect until next
year. But I had heard before
the draft, that the Aztecs would
pick me up if I was around. I
was glad they did, but you
might say it was a little bit of a
surprise.
lenkins: Why are you turning
pro with one more year of
eligibility left? Does it mean
that you are leaving school al
together?
McNevin: I've assessed my
priorities over the last two
years. When I entered Stanford
I hadn't thought of playing
soccer professionally. Since
then I have met with some suc
cess and really enjoyed playing
ball.
It's a good idea to get started

in sports as soon as possible.
The way I look at it, if I stay in
school I will always be wonder
ing about playing pro soccer.
The last year I have not been
buckling down to my studies
the way I should.
By going into soccer now I
will have one year of develop
ment over the people at my
level right now, which is really
important because there is a
rule that says the pro teams
have to have at least three
American players on the field
at a time.
Basically, I wasn't improving
any more at the collegiate level
(because) my ability is above
most of the players here, which
is not to say that there aren't a
lot of really fine players here.
There are. But on the whole the
level of technical ability is not
up to mine, which means I go
down.
I will be better otl in a situa
tion where I improve. Its a mat
ter of me wanting to play up to
my full potential.
Jenkins: What kind ot prob
lems do you anticipate moving
into professional soccer?
McNevin: Physically, profes
sional sports are much more
highly tuned, so I will have to
train that much harder. In col
lege you don't get that so
much, there are not many
people who can push me.
Mentally, there is a lot more
pressure because you are paid
to play. Not even a scholarship
is the same, because it's still a
relaxed atmosphere. But pro
fessionally, you are paid to
produce. It will be hard to

make that switch.
lenkins: Is there anything spe
cial you are doing to prepare
yourself?
McNevin: Of course. The key is
to think about it a lot, and ask
questions of my friends who
are already in pro sports, what
it's like, what to expect, things
like that.
I'm also training five hours a
day. I've never worked out that
hard before. My body is really
worn down from losing so
many calories. When I join
them in February they will al
ready be in preseason and
working out really hard. What I
am trying to do is simulate the
pro style of training that they
are going through. The key is
putting myself through more
abuse, and being able to take
it.
lenkins: Did you get offers from
any other teams?
McNevin: I got some feelers
from other teams besides the
Aztecs. I was offered a tryout
with a divison I team over in
England, and the guy I talked to
thought I would make the
team. I would have liked to
have done that, but it was too
complicated.
If I didn't make it over there
then I would want to come
back to Stanford, and the rule
is that you can't be exposed to
a pro team for longer than 48
hours, which would have been
the case. I would have been in
eligible.
If the Aztecs and I can't come
to terms, then I can still do that
(England). They aie the best in
the world over there.

lenkins: What about continuing
in school?
McNevin: I will come back in
the off season and take one or
two courses a quarter. But I will
have to go slowly. As long as I
am playing soccer I am not
going to get a chance to apply
my education.
But when I was in training I
realized that it was boring, that
I needed the stiniulation I get
from school. Soccer used to be
a welcome break from school.
Now it's the other way around,
I need a break from soccer. I
hope that I will find some good
friends on the team to talk to,
to kind of balance my life.
Other than that I guess I will
buy a lot of interesting books.
Jenkins: Are you scared at all?
McNevin: No, not scared. If
you go into a situation like this
scared they put you into the
ground, you're out in the cold.
After the dust settled I was able
to see that I have a real oppor
tunity. I'm not scared. I have a
high level of technical ability

and I want to learn. I'm not
cocky, but it you go into this
thing scared, you're going to
get beat.
Jenkins: Wli.it do your parents
think about all of this, espe
cially your leaving schools
McNevin: They have always
pushed for education, but they
saw my feelings about it. My
Dad was as frustrated as me
when he would watch me play.
He saw that I had sacrificed my
personal improvement for the
team, and that they didn't re
ally need my type of player. So
he supported me. They have
accepted it, they are behind
me.
I have caught some flack
from other people, you know,
they say 'but what about your
education!' But I never
thought I would finish in four
years anyway. It's a great chal
lenge that I have been ot
tered, and I think it can give me
a better idea of, what life is all
about.
