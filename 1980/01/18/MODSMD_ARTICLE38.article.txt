# Gymnasts scatter on road
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stantord's gymnastics teams
scatter in opposite directions
to compete in road meets be
ginning tonight. )ackie
Walker's women face Cal Poly
Pomona in a 7 p.m. meet to
night, then compete against
Cal State long Beach tomor
row at i p.m.
For Sadao Hamada and his
gymnasts, the trip to Berkeley
tomorrow will be short com
pared to the women's south
ern sojourn, but the implica
tions of the 7:10 p.m. show

down with the Golden Bears
could run long.
"They're a little bit ahead of
us, but each day the judges are
different," Hamada said. "It we
do very well, we have a chance
to beat them.
"This is really the first year
that I can say we tan be com
petitive with California. For
years Cal has been a top power
and we never gave them a seri
ous challenge. Finally we've
improved to the level where
we can be competitive,"
Hamada said.

In the women's competitor!,
the most recent national
coaches' poll ranked the Cards
20th in the country, primarily
on the strength ot staging a
M 4.70 to 126.00 upset ot fifth
ranked use.
After posting the school re
cord score, 12th highest team
total in the nation so tar this
season, it would he easy for the
women to let up in their pair of
non-conference meets.
That and injuries are the two
things Walker wants to avoid
most.
"Long Beach could be as
tough as USC, with a team
score of around 126," Walker
said.
"It (the USC meet) was the
first meet of the season, so the
team was especially psyched,
but in any meet we should be
able to score at least HO
points."
