# Letter of intent, cash resolve lengthy Coffee House dispute
## 
### Fran Miller 
The Jan. 10 settlement between
Guckenheimer Enterprises, the
operator of The Coffee House, and
the 36 employees who were fired
without notice last summer includes
a $15,321 cash settlement to the
employees, according to former Cof
fee House worker Jeffrey Kimball.
The settlement also includes a let
ter of intent containing nine grie
vance points signed by Guc
kenheimer President Stewart
Ritchie.
The settlement came after a long
series of negotiations which began in
mid-November, according to a press
release issued Wednesday.
Doug Arnstein, Jeff Silva and Har
mon Wang, all of Student Arts at

Stanford (STARTS), mediated bet
ween the parties. Arnstein said the
group was motivated by the belief
that "the firingscast a real shadow on
Tresidder as a whole." Besides the
fact that we (STARTS) had a hard time
putting on programs (because at
tendance at Tresidder was poor) we
wanted to try to make Tresidder a
worthwhile place for people to come
to again."
Some of the original employees
had been offered re-employment at
the Coffee House but negotiations
were at a standstill. The National
Labor Relations Board had filed suit
against Guckenheimer on behalf of
the employees and a court hearing
was scheduled for February.
Former Coffee House worker
Terry Fry said he thought it was "very
fantastic" that three students could
conduct the negotiations and that he
was disappointed about the lack of
involvement in the matter by the
ASSU, particularly the Council of
Presidents. He said the Tresidder
administration is concerned only
with profits and is ignoring student
desires.
Another source familiar with the
situation said theTresidderadminist
ration's pressure on the operators to
increase profits by turning the Cof
fee House into a "beer joint" indi
rectly caused the firings.
The source said this would help
explain why the administration re
fused to become involved in negotia
tions even after the new system was
found to be inefficient (October

sales were down 18 percent over
1978).
Ritchie said that he is "grateful for
the bridge that has been built" and
sees the settlement as "more than
liquidating a problem" and as "ex
tremely positive for the future."
Kimball said the nine points agreed
upon include:
—encouragement of Guc
kenheimer to employ a more
cooperative management, which
would be "less hierarchical";
—preference in hiring given to
Stanford students and/or alumni;
—the "crosstraining" of all
employees so that they will be able to
do most of the jobs in the operation;
—de-emphasis of beer and wine
including the withdrawal of signs ad
vertising alcoholic beverages, the
abolishment of happy hours, the re
moval of the television set and the
removal of the plastic fruit display
from behind the counter;
—the abolishment of red Stanford
t-shirts for employees;
—the joint scheduling of enter
tainment by STARTS and the Coffee
House; and
—an agreement for both sides to
"bury the axe" and work together to
make a new Coffee House.
All of the original employees, ex
cept the two managers, have been
offered their jobs again. Only a hand
ful are returning, however, because
most of them have since found other
jobs.
