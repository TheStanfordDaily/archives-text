ALEX'S MOUNTAIN HOUSE
13808 Skyline Blvd.
Woodside
851-9971
lo reach Alex's Mountain House on a
stormy night, visitors must know their de
stination. Out of the fog on wooded
Skyline Drive, a large sign and yellow
lights welcome you.
Inside the main room it is dim, but a tire
glows and spreads warmth. Couches, an
I-shaped bar, and small tables give locals
sitting space to share talk. A lively noise
ensues from the young crowd that isc lad in
jeans and llannel shirts.
City people beware! Settling in to this
backwoods establishment makes you teel
like you enter a mountain dweller's life,
tor effect, tiffany lamps cast light on an
tique style mirrors. Several old pianos sit
as decorations, not in tune to be played. In
lieu, a brightly lit juke box spews '50s
music and jazz.
Casual greetings lead to accommodat
ing service at the entrance to the back
room. The theme of this dining room is
red. White window casings accent the
brick-red walls. Red lanterns illuminate
red-clothed tables yielding just enough
light to read by.
s At a glance, home cooking made novel
with sauces and stuffings describes Alex's
menu. II welcomes you with appetizers
Irorn the sea; tresh Long Island oysters ora
bay shrimp cocktail. If you prefer, try an
artichoke '"steamed fresh from Pescad
em "with melted butter or mayonnaise.

Then choose from fish shellfish, thic
ken, lamb, heel, or vegetarian dishes. Let
your mood decide a saute and your dish.
Alex's gives you a white wine tream saute
with a hint of turry; hollandaise; orange
honey glazes; mint sauces and other
homemade tombinations.
Although the regular menu features less
than 10 entrees, varietv tempts you. And

there are surprises! When your waitress
explains the evening specials ask about
the freshness ot that dish that especially
appeals to you. This is a key to your delight
in dinner.
A loaf ot crusty, browned bread, freshly
baked and still warm accompanies a large
garden salad. Diners loss and help them
selves to the Iresh greens and to the jar ot
homemade dressing.

I praise Alex's evening specials Iho ap
petizer ot marinated crab proved tender
and flavorful. No salty taste or stringly
meat here. Also, the rabbit baked in cream
sauce and topped with real bacon pieces
won points. A stock base used before the
rabbit is smoothed with the delicately
spiced c ream sauce. Ihe meat,which looks
and tastes a bit like chicken, tell right off
the bone.
Unfortunately the rainbow trout was
scantilystuffed and did not taste that fresh.
1 his is why asking lor suggestions regard
ing freshness is emphasized.
Chopped tresh brut < oli and a mixture ot
wild rue accented the main plate. Alex's
entrees which include garniture, bread
loaf, and salad,cost approximately $<>.50 to
$11.50. A wine list is available. Wine, ap
petizers, and desserts are a la carte.
Anticipating dessert < It is all homemade.
Mom would appreciate Alex's brandied
apple pie. It is chunky and topped with
real whipped cream. A layered < heesecake
with a light heart tantalizes the light
hearted. Choose also from chocolate
mousse.
Owner Alex Reid dates his building in a
glen to the speak-easy days ot the twen
ties. The Mountain House has occupied it
lor the past s'j years. The bar serves a
regular local clientele, but the dining
room attracts frequenters from San Fran
ciso and the Bay Area. No reservationsare
taken; yet even on a toggy, loggy night,
the Mountain House was pleasingly full.
