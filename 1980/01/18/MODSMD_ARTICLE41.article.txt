A break in lilt' rain, heavy
misl descends over rustic
downtown Woodside and we,
in search ol fine French ciiis
ing, pull back the heavy door of
The Village Pub. Fortunately we
abandoned our hip mountain
Frye boots and down vests and
dressed lor gourmet eating, lor
hiding under this cozy British
appellation lurks excellent
French lood served only to
those* wearing suitable attire:
"(ientlemen, coats please."
Our line clothes were not
particularly warranted by the
tasteful but certainly unex
travagant decor. However,
once the meal appeared, we
realized oui suits and silks
were ollenngs lo please the
ehel and honor a primarily
flawless meal. We were off to a
good start with c/e
Boiiifiumonne iss), six lowly
snails, led lo maturity on lines
herbes and delicacies, gently
done in and over with butter,
parsely, garlic,and a briet stay
under the broilei. Served
steaming hot, these were a
beautilul appeli/er.
LJnlorlunately, when we
searched lor a light French

bread with vvhic h to sop up the
butter sauce and cleanse the
palate, we found sourdough,
toasted, buttered, tasty, but
inappropriate. Salad, though
generously seasoned with
freshly ground black pepper
and tasty was not what we ex
pected, either, a combination
ol leaf and iceberg lettuce.
Where, oh where was the dainty
and simple butter lettuce salad
the French have made so fam
ous? Onion soup was not spec -

tacular, but quite good.
And yet, neitherot usweieat
all dissatisfied at this point in
time; we sensed and expec ted
that the best was yet to arrive.
After the briefest pause bet
ween < ourses, our waiter (who
refreshingly did not make a
point ol introducing himself)
delivered /e.s entrees.
It had been a difticult deci
sive listing — and I chose the
(irenadine ol Beet ($12.95),
served with the diner's choice
ol mushrooms or beam.use

sauce. I picked the latter, and a
wise selection it was. Two
fork-tender medallions topped
with just enough ot the deli
cate, interestingly spiced
bearnaise now awaited the
test. It took but one bite lor me
to realize that the next halt
hour or so would be a blissful
experience, and a generous
portion insured that quality
would not be ec lipsed by a lac k
of qantity.
Accompanying my dish were
slices ol potato, cooked with
butter, and firm, sweet rounds
ol zucchini, delightfully ila
vored with seasonings which
battled the tongue — cinna
mon! 1 nutmeg? Whatever, both
vegetables were very pleasing;
their preparation enhanced
the nature ol the dish rather
than masking the primary
flavors.
Oysters Rockefeller: a dish
lo do the Walrus and Car
penter proud, lor $10.95,
plenty ol the slippery tellows
hidden under blankets ol
cheese and spinach were my
companion's choice most
pleasing to the eye. As she
energetic ally forked them from
their nests I pronged one Horn
her plate and lound it delici
ous, a mild blend ol spices
complementing the tresh last
ing shellfish. It was easy to im
agine their alleged powers as
medieval aphrodisiacs.
