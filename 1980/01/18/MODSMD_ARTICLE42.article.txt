# Woodside: Sophisticated food in quaint rural surroundings
## 
### 
Her side order of artichoke
hearts a la maison were per
fectly cooked, beautilul at $2
but mv asparagus Hollandaise
was >lit>htly overcooked, and
the little spears were also a bit
fibrous. The sauce was quite
smooth and rich, though, mak
ing the dish quite edible.
The house wine we ordered
with our meal was light, fruity,
and certainly pleasant. At last
sated and contentedly tired
from our healthy feed, we en
joyed coffee and a simple,
elegant cheesecake with a
lengthy and olt provocative
post-dinner conversation. The
evening had acquired an elu
sive, magical quality.
The varied menu of entrees
cooked, if our meals can be
said to stand as examples, to
perfection, accompanied by
hors d'oeuvres and side dishes
that should, perhaps, be more
carefully selected and pre
pared but good, nontheless,
make The Village Pub a worth
while, if expensive, adventure.
And so, if one is still search
ing tor line French food in a
scenic but unpretentious set
ting, this restaurant, which re
ceives a high rating, is defi
nitely worth a visit.
