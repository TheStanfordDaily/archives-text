The African Queen ¥ ¥ ¥ *
Saturday, Cubberley 7:30 & 9:30
p.m.
This 1951 John Huston movie is
thoroughly entertaining, and you
won't find a more inspired bit of
casting than the pairing of Hum
phrey Bogart and Katharine Hep
burn, Bogart's the crusty river
boat captain and Hepburn's the
untouchable spinster; it's basi
cally a magical matchup, and it
features all the elements — ad
venture, comedy, charm and fi
nally love. Huston, lames Agee
and |ohn Collier wrote the script;
Robert Morely co-stars.

Friday-Saturday, Wilbur/Cedro
Dining Hall 8:30 & 10:30 p.m.
George Lucas extended his
honors thesis a bit and ended up
with his first feature film. This
futuristic fantasy is a much more
cynical, claustrophobic movie
lhan Lucas' later American Graf
fiti or Star Wars, but there are
enough weird quirks here to
keep you wondering indefinitely.
—R.L.
Children of Paradise ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
Wednesday, Bishop, 7:30 p.m.
Among the greatest French
movies, Children was made
under extraordinarily trying con
ditions; much of the movie was
made before the end of the Ger
man occupation of France in
WWII, and some of the filmmak
ers were being hunted by the
Gestapo. This superb work by di
rector Marcel Carne and writer
lacques Prevert combines ele
ments of film poetry, theatre,
lush romance and profane love.
With the astonishing Jean-Louis
Barrault as the mime Deburau —
the Pierrot; Arletty, Pierre Bras
seur, Pierre Renoir and Maria Ca
sares also star.
— R.L.
A Clockwork Orange ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture; the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit*
I ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
i singularly disturbing film.

' The Black Hole *
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion pic
ture space race with a brilliant
plunge into the world of outer
space special effects, and falls flat
on its face. The effects are fun in
the beginning but the wires soon
, become obnoxiously visible and
k people start breathing in space.

The best acting is done by a tin
can named V.I .N.C.E.N. I". that
looks like a cross between Star
Wars' R2-D2 and a beer keg. The
movie plays like Captain Nemo in
space and the religious over
tones probably have Dante spin
ning in his grave.
—Simon Labov
The Gold Rush ¥ * # *
Monday, Cubberley 7 p.m.
A fully realized comedy of ex
traordinary charm and grace.
Charlie Chaplin is in full com
mand of his surely awesome ta
lents in this 1925 effort; this
movie about Chaplin's adven
tures in the forbidden wilderness
is among the most honored of all
time. Blonde Venus, a 1932 losef
von Sternberg movie starring
Marlene Dietrich, is the second
half of Monday's double bill.
—R.L.
Shampoo ¥ ¥ * Vt
Sunday, Mem Aud 7& 9:15 p.m.
One of the few '70s comedies
(other than Woody Allen's) that is
truly memorable. The Robert
Towne screenplay, despite its
occasional pretention, is a sca
thingly funny look at the Beautiful
People of 1968 Los Angeles, and
the performances, especially
Warren Beatty's (as a befuddled
haridresser), are perfect. Hal
Ashby directed, superbly. Julie
Christie, Coldie Hawn, )ack
Warden, Lee Grant and (for one
line) Carrie Fisher make up the
remainder of the fine cast.
—R.L.
Sleeper * * * *
Saturday-Monday, New Varsity
It is in vogue these days to rank
Woody Allen movies according
to their fundamental melan
choly. The "better" pictures are
held to be those in which Allen's
dark side is closest tothe surface,
while those not so rooted in mis
ery and fear are proportionately
lacking.
Such a system certainly has its
merits, in that Allen has clearly
developed in such a way, but at
tempts to judge his movies by
such limited criteria do him an
injustice. Sleeper is a perfect
example. This picture has little if
any dark side, and as such is very
clearly "early Woody," but I have
considerable trouble under
standing what the hell that
means. Sleeper is a funny movie,
pure and simple, and it doesn't
leave me unsatisfied — it leaves
mein theaisle convinced that it is
possible to die of excess laugh
ter. He's a serious, thoughtful,
intelligent man, and no doubt
deserves hosannas for those
qualities, but he's also the fun
niest person on the planet. It's
hard to fault Woody Allen for
playing his strength.
—John Nielsen
Going In Style » * *
Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie,
that, because ot its slower pacing

and lack of ribald comedy, has
been unjustly criticized. George
Burns, Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to
watch, and in his movie debut,
28-year old Martin Brest makes
up for his lack ot plot ideas with a
compassionate and gentle touch.
Much of the movie's comedy is
contained in the opening sequ
ences, where the elderly trio rob
a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, more emotionally
wrenching. Well worth seeing, if
only to watch actors who don't
need to trample you to be effec
tive.
—R.L.

The lerk * *
Old Mill Look, I love Steve Mar
tin, but this is more an attempt
to cash in on his present status
than an effort to tace tougher
creative challenges. Steve's born
a "poor black child," and several
of the skits in this rags to riches
to rags story revel so wildly in
their dumbness that they simply
must be inspired, but this is sim
ply not the movie that's going to
make Martin a memorable movie
comedian. Lie's got the unique
moves and he's perhaps got the
mind, but doesn't yet have the
material — The jerk's more a str
inging together of sketches than
a movie. Maybe next time, okay?
—R.L.

(juadrophenia ¥ * *
Old Mill
This interpretation of The
Who's 1973 album may or may
not be what you expected, but
there's a live-wire energy here
that surely does the world's
greatest rock band proud. Music
is of fundamental importance to
the kids populating this gritty,
realistic look at the British
Mods-Rockers conflict of the
mid-'6os; if anything else, this
movie makes the recent punk
and "new wave" movements in
England much more understand
able.
—R.L.

Kramer vs. Kramer * #* * ' •>
Old Mill
In most respects, writer
director Robert Benton's movie
is an astonishing one. With the
interplay between a brilliant
Dustin Hoffman and a youngster
of almost frighteningly correct
instincts named Justin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton con
structs a moving, compassion
ate, almost Truffaut-like charac
ter study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his
son land vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of
the film. Alter all the care and
honesty Benton's invested

throughout, why does fie have
to load the dice against the
female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
as much merit as Hoffman's, but
instead of taking things head on,
Benton backed off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity. Jane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb

composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen
dros.
—R.L.
Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false
melodramatics; almost con
structed as the visual equivalent
of a Willie Nelson song. The fact
that Nelson's one of the co-stars
only enhances the warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
thoughtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-lane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver

tises breakfast cereal for a de
humanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set
the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford fall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoid
ing overt messages and, despite
the prefab elements, maintain
ing its charm and good natured
ness throughout. A completely
amiable movie, and there's no
thing much wrong with that.
—R.L.
Star Trek * *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of
greed — Paramount Pictures. A
mechanical creation of man
comes back to haunt him as the
darling creature's quest tor
knowledge leads it to finally
search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where
one of the Enterprise's crew
members saves civilization by
gleefully agreeing to some cos
mic sex — is unintentionally
hilarious. Shatner, Nimoy and
the rest were much better on
TV; on the 70mm screen they're
almost unbelievably wooden.
The rest of the movie is like a
greatest hits of Douglas Trum
bull and )ohn Dykstra's previous
special effects set out in lengthly
detail.
—R.L.
Apocalypse How * * ★ ★
Old Mill
Century, San lose
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this just-ended de
cade. It has almost untenable
ambitions, but the profound
questions that it confronts you
with justify the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind.
Starring Marlon Brando, Martin
Sheen and Robert Duval I.

10 * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The sexist acl campaign has
misled many people to this
movie; if you're looking for a
semi-pornographic turn-on, 10
may not be right for you.
Writer-director Blake Edwards'
values are, for lack of a better |
word, straight, and this comedy
about male mid-lite crisis proba
bly won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwri
ter, Dudley Moore is an ingratiat
ing bumbler, and Edwards gives
the remainder of the cast more
than enough depth to get by. Ex
cept for Bo Derek, that is. This
poster-star just may have found
her "niche" as the vacuous "10"
the title refers to.
—R.L.
The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion of Star is Born except this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character
vaguely based on lanis loplin.
But the movie only makes three
references to I<W>9, and without
those you'd probably just as
sume the movie was set in the
present. And the music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than
as lanis loplin's form of blues
and rock. The performances at
times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ
ences. When teamed with either
Frederic Forrest or Alan Bates,
Midler comes off much better,
but it's too little too late.
—R.L.
1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directorial perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
• dramatic tension, but as an ex
pression of visual and Howard
Hawks-style comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennet or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the omedy is
generally not of the lasting vari
ety. That may partially explain
the very harsh reaction of most
critics to this movie; also, such
completely physical, frenzied
comedic action may be horribly
out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working better than
|ohn Belushi, and Dan Aykroyd,
Treat Williams, Toshiro Mifune
and Slim Pickens are all fine
here. But Robert Stack as Gen
eral "Vi negar |oe" St ilwe II
quietly steals the show as he
tearfully watches Disney's
Dumbo as a full-scale riot goes
on outside the theater.
-R.L.


Still ebullient at age 83, George Burns turns in a remarkable performance in the touching Going in Style.
