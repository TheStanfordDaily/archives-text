Olympic group to discuss boycott
Washington — Officials of the U.S. Olympic
Committee (USOC), annoyed that they were not
consulted before Carter administration officials
called for America to pull out of the 1980 Summer
Olympics in Moscow if Soviet troops remain in
Afghanistan, will meet to discuss a possible
boycott.
Robert Kane, the USOC president, who called
the boycott proposal "inappropriate and gauche,"
and Col. F. Don Miller, executive director of the
private organization that oversees American par
ticipation in the Olympics and amateur sports in
the United States will meet this afternoon with
loseph Onek, deputy counsel to the president,
and other members of the White House staff work
ing on the administration's Olympics policy.
Public and congressional support of the move
ment to shift the Olympics to another site, boycott
them, or counter them with an alternative "Free
World Games" swelled yesterday in the United
States, but failed to generate any substantial
movement abroad.
Three Republican members of the House —
Rep. Robert Bauman of Maryland, Rep. Don Ritter
of Pennsylvania and Rep. John Buchana of
Alabama — introduced resolutions urging that the
summer games be moved from Moscow.
The AFL-CIO was among the growing number of
public and private voices calling for Americans to
participate only if the games can be relocated
Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister,
reiterated that she favors asking the International
Olympic Committee to move the games, which
the lOC has insisted it will not do. Otherwise little
support was forthcoming from European allies and
Third-World nations for the U.S boycott initiatives
that have received among strong public support in
radio, television and newspaper surveys.
Meanwhile, USOC officials were invited to pre
sent their arguments against a boycott to the ad
ministration for the lirst time.
Kane and members of the 86-person USOC
Executive Board, which would have to vote for a
boycott, have said they would comply with a pres
idential request that Americans not participate.
But it was learned from Olympic sources tha they
will try to persuade presidential aides that a U.S.
boycott of Moscow would kill the Olympic games
as we now know them, guarantee future control of
international amateur sports by the Soviet bloc by
eliminating the United States as a force in the lOC,
and tail to be as severe a reprisal against the
Soviets as has been assumed.'
Schmidt pledges U.S. support
Bonn Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West
Germany yesterday pledged his country's full
support to the United States in its confrontations
with the Soviet Union and Iran, "even it this will
mean economic: sacrifices for us."
The chancellor declared that it the United States
implemented its plans to impose a boycott against
Iran as a retaliatory measure tor taking of American
hostages by student militants holding the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, Washington "can rely on the
support of West Germany as an absolutely
trustworthy ally and friend."
But while pledging Bonn s support for Americ an
measures against the Soviet Union lor its invasion
of Afghanistan, Sc hmidt said that West Germany
would c ontinue to support detente with the Soviet
Union and its Fast European allies, a concept that
was pioneered by Schmidt's predecessor, Wily
Brandt.
Fhe U.S. ambassador to West Germany, Walter
Stoessel Ir., said in ,111 interview that he was confi
dent that the Germans would actively support
American moves, especially through a restriction

or cutoff of high technology exports that the Sovet
Union needs for its internal development.
Bonn is reportedly ready to increase military aid
to Turkey and Greece, two NATO partiers situated
on the alliance's vital southern flank, and
economic aid to Pakistan and the Afghan refugees
who have fled into that country.
But the Afghanistan crisis has not led to cancella
tion of Schmidt's planned visit to East Germany for
a March summit meeting with Erich Hoenicker,
the East German Communist Party chief, nor a
scheduled meeting later in the year with Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev. Schmidt has main
tained that in times of c rises, such contact should
be reinforced, not cut.
Cubans to get third Russian sub
Washington — A third Soviet submarine for the
Cuban Navy is on its way to the Caribbean island,
U.S. defense officials said yesterday.
Now in the mid-Atlantic and flying a Cuban tlag,
the diesel submarine is expected to reach Cuba's
expanding naval base at Cienfuegos within two
weeks. There it will join another similar vessel and
an old submarine used for training purposes. Both
were supplied last year.
I he subs are the latest deliveries in a series of
substantial arms shipments to Cuba of sophisti
cated Soviet weapons in recent years, including 12
or more high-pertormance MiC-23 jets and at least
two high-speed, well-equipped, hydrofoil patrol
craft.
Ihe new arms buildup, valued at $550 million
over the past five years, has given Cuba a small but
growing capacity to interfere in time of crisis with
U.S. troop and supply ships from Gulf of Mexico
ports, with oil tankers from Venezuela and with
ship traffic of all kinds through the Panama Canal,
officials said.
I here is no sign that the administration is plan
ning to counter the Cuban activities, however,
beyond the increased U.S. military exercises and
intelligence-monitoring operations ordered by
President Jimmy Carter Oct. I after a Soviet "com
bat brigade" was discovered on the island.
Administration planners say they believe that
three kinds of events could halt Cuban adven
turism: getting a "bloody nose" in Africa, which
might happen, for example, if Cuban troops went
up against South Africans; losing Moscow's
economic subsidies, now running, at $8 million a
day; or failing to maintain influence in the Third
World.
Some officials believe the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan will make third World nations much
more wary of Cuban help unless Premier Fidel
Castro moves todissociate himself from Moscow's
aggression.
Japan clarifies hesitance on Iran
Tokyo — Japan explained to American officials
yesterday its cautious approach to sanctions
against both Iran and the Soviet Union and indi
cated it will move slowly toward a decision in both
cases.
Japanese officials cited the country's close
economic ties with Iran and its dependence on
Iranian oil and asked for American recognition ot
their problems in closing off exports to that coun
try.
Fhey also asserted a need for prudence in im
posing any sanction against the Soviet Union tor
its invasion of Afghanistan, mentioning Japan's
need to fish in Russian waters and the presence of
Soviet troops near its northernmost island.
Those views were expressed in a series of meet
ings I hursday with Philip Habib, a special assistant
to the U.S. secretary of state, sent here to sound

out Japan's position on the American drive for a
joint campaign of sanctions against both countries
on the part of the United States, Japan and Euro
pean apies.
As described by Japanese officials, the talks
broke no new ground and served only to under
score Japan's reluctance to take action that would
imperil its relaions with either country.
Moreover, these officials indicated it would take
time — perhaps as much as two weeks — before
any decisions are made. Nothing will be decided
until after Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira returns
Sunday from a visit to Australia. His chief cabinet
secretary, Masayoshi Ito, with whom Habib con
ferred yesterday morning, said all of the issues
must be discussed with Ohira and other officials
atter his return. One source indicated that the only
deadline fixed so far is Jan. 31, when the Japanese
parliament's budget committee comes into ses
sion.
The American response seemed to be one of
satisfaction with the talks. American sources said
they had expected no faster movement. They cal
led the meetings an opportunity for an exchange
of views. "It is too early to say what will be
achieved," one source said.
Pakistan calls aid offer 'peanuts'
Rawalpindi, Pakistan — The head of Pakistan's
military regime, Gen. Zia-ul-Haq, yesterday de
scribed the United States offer of $400 million in
economic and military aid as "peanuts," and said
that he wants to see U.S. guarantees of support for
his country written into a binding, bilateral treaty.
Zia made his comments in a joint English
language interview with five American correspon
dents in his home here near the Pakistani capital of
Islamabad.
He also categorically ruled out the construction
of any U.S. military bases on Pakistani territory,
saying that they "are only a source of trouble" for
the host country and that if built they would "earn
the animosity of the Soviet Union."
/ia indicated that he is not prepared to make any
concessions to the United States in the form of
human rights guarantees, greater political free
dom tor Pakistanis, or assurances regarding his
country's nuclear program in return for American
aid.
"Forget your Western ideals and your Western
standards of freedom and democracy," he replied
when asked about his regime's political prisoners.
"You are in a Moslem developing country. And
Islam says that if somebody says anything against
your integrity, against your religion, against your
everything, chop him — teach him a lesson."
