# Bill Burger judged prize Daily editor
## 
### 
Last night the Daily held its
semi-annual equivalent of the Il
linois Farm Fair. The winning
entry was Bill Burger, of Belvi
dere, at 6-foot-2 and 195 pounds.
He was judged by the staff as
being strong in journalistic ex
perience — and the only candi
date.
Burger was raised by the Belvi
dere Buccaneer Farm where he
first wrote some stories approach
ing the style called journalism.
Burger was then sent to the Daily
for three years of liquid feed and
training where he was even per
mitted to rise to the rank of man
aging editor — temporarily.
Various females who judged
the entire entry found it lacking.
One Cal student, who claims to
know the bare facts, yawned
when interviewed about Burger.
Burger, who says he has "the
potential for being a nice guy,"
announced last night his major
goal as editor will be to redecorate
the editor's office. First on his list
will be replacing the glass window
he broke in a tit of pique after
hearing write-in votes were al
lowed in the otherwise uncon
tested election.
Burger is known for his 'organi
zation and consistency,' which he
apparently learned from seeing
farmers plant rows of soybeans in
his native state.
While at the Daily, Burger main
tained a record of always getting
home early, even after long train
ing sessions with new staffers.
Many new staffers, some of
whom have likened him to an
"eager, young pup," have been
offered to be shown the tools of
the trade by the master journalist
himself. Most have refused.
Thus Burger has said his prim
ary goals will be "structural
reorganization of the Daily to make
it a more efficient newsgathering
organization — (more impor
tantly) and getting anybody to
work for me."
Staff reactions to his election
were unusually consistent.
"Big deal," said one staffer,
"We're replacing an Orange
County editor with a Chicago
mafioso."
Another staffer added, "Burger
aspires to the stereotypical carica

tureot the journalist oft portrayed
on television. He is hard working
and dedicated or rather strives to
appear so. He keeps odd hours —
but for all the wrong reasons. And
of course he drinks too much and
is prematurely developing a beer
bellv."
One staffer complained that
Burger should have listened to his
fraternity brothers and stayed
away from the Daily.
But then one frat brother com
plained that he should have
stayed away from the frat.
Burger's journalistic career has
been almost as shiny and illustri
ous as his leather winter coat.
Burger spent last summer graz
ing at the Mercury-News. After
winning last night's election he
said he plans to put in four hard
working months at the Daily and
then he says he hopes above all to
be put out to pasture in New
Mexico.
Also last night several staffers
voiced a more serious concern.
"Will Burger sandwiches be
served at every staff lunch?"
