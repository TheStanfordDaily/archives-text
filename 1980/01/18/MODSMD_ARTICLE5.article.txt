## Afghan and Soviet armies clash

The Washington Tost
Washington â€” Soviet forces were
reported to have clashed yesterday
with the Afghan army troops the Rus
sians say they came to Kabul to sup
port, according to accounts reaching
Pakistan.
Correspondents in Kabul for the
Reuter news agency said they heard
firing from heavy guns in the direc
tion of the Kabul airport, but they
were not allowed by Afghan au
thorities to go to that part of the capi
tal to investigate.
The reported clash came shortly
after the Tass news agency in Mos
cow reported that Afghanistan was
expelling all American correspon
dents for "gross interference in the
affairs of a sovereign state."
The announcement of the ouster,
reported from Kabul, was made by
the ruling Afghan revolutionary
Council, headed by President Babrak
Karmal.
Reporters criticized
The council was critical of Ameji
can news accounts of the Soviet inva

sion of Afghanistan and installation
of a pro-Moscow government
headed by Babrak. It said the U.S.
reporters had been writing "inven
tions and insinuations, each one
more clumsy than the one before.
Their goal is to increase tension in
our country and disrupt the normal
life of the Afghan people."
It singled out Washington Post cor
respondent William Branigin, James
Sterba of The New York Times, James
Dorsey of the Christian Science
Monitor and the correspondents of
the U.S. television networks.
The explusion order goes into ef
fect today, but the correspondents
were held at their Kabul hotel by Af
ghan authorities yesterday.
Initial reports indicated that 30 to
50 American reporters and camera
men were in Afghanistan. Non-
Americans working for U.S. news
agencies apparently are not affected.
Americans detained
Afghan authorities detained the
Americans Wednesday night atter
they refused to register with the In
terior Ministry, diplomatic sources
reported.
A State Department spokesman
said the explusion violated "basic
norms and international behavior."
It followed the expulsion of U.S.
journalists in Iran earlier this week.
"It's reprehensible and yet
another indication of the absolute
contempt for human rights that
exists there," the spokesman said.
Afghanistan was reluctant to let
Western journalists into the country
after the Dec. 27 coup and for the
first week turned away reporters
when they flew into Kabul airport.
Location unconfirmed
Although it could not be im
mediately confirmed if the reported

fighting in Kabul came from the air
port or a nearby location, it was
known that Soviet troops have
formed a heavy fortification at the
airport since coming to the capital
city.
The extent and nature of the fight
ing was also unknown, but Soviet
civil aircraft took off for Moscow
soon after the firing started.
Soviet troops have formed a defen
sive ring around the city with bat
teries of medium-ranged howitzers
and seemed likely these were in op
eration during the fighting, Reuter
reported.
Aircraft sighted
Washington Post correspondent
Stuart Auerback reported from Is
lamabad, Pakistan, that diplomatic
sources said aircraft were flying over
the scene of the firing and that if ap
peared that some of the shooting was
coming from the planes.
Pakistani President Mohammed
Zia Ul-Haq, in an interview with
American reporters, confirmed re
ports of the righting.
"It is an attempt by regular Afghan
forces to show contempt for the
military occupiers," he said. Al
though he had few details, he said
the fighting was at the hilltop Bala
Hissar fortress and at the airport. He
called the clashes heavy. He
suggested that the fighting could be
between a Soviet Airborne division
in Kabul and elements of the Afghan
Army tank corps.
The reliability of the Afghan army
has been a question since the Soviet
troops entered the mountainous
Southwest Asian country. U.S.
sources had questioned whether the
Afghans, known for their fierce in
dependence, would accept the
Soviet forces.
