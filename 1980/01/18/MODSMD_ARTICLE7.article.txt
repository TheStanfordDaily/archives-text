## Soviets react with anger to Olympic boycott threats 
### 
The Washington Post
Moscow — After a guarded
delay to see which way the
wind might be blowing, the
Soviet Union has reacted with
anger and alarm to a suggested
U.S. boycott of the 1980 Mos
cow Olympics in reprisal for
the Afghanistan invasion.
The official media here have
now labeled the Carter ad
ministration's suggestion
"political blackmail," aimed at
"undermining international
detente and seriously aggravat
ing Soviet-American rela
tions," as the newspaper
Sovietsky Sport declared in the
first official acknowledgement
of the issue.
Meanwhile, sources here say
they believe the Soviet sports
command has recently drop
ped veiled hints to foreign offi
cials that a 1980 boycott by the
United States of the Moscow
summer games could open the
door to retaliatory boycotts of
the 1984 games in Los Angeles.
But it was impossible to check
these reports from here Mon
day.
However, a senior Soviet
Olympics official in an inter
view Monday said it is his per
sonal feeling that "it's impos
sible to exclude the Moscow
games between the Lake Placid
and Los Angeles games." But
Vsevolod Sovva, chief of
Olympic press information,
declined to speculate about
any future participation pos
sibilities, calling such ques
tions hypothetical.
But he left no room for doubt
where the Soviets stand on a
possible boycott: ' n>e Olym
pics and a boycott are incom
patible. Any such boycott and
the Olympics would cease to
exist. The Olympic charter
excludes such discrimination,
or any connection between the
games and political purposes."
"Unconnected things"
As for Afghanistan, that situ
ation has been more than
adequately explained by Soviet

President Leonid Brezhnev,
Sovva said, and it has no con
nection to the Olympics. "It is
groundless trying to connect
unconnected things," he said.
Brezhnev has said the Soviet
military intervention was in re
sponse to pleas for assistance
from the Marxist government
in Kabul to defeat internal sub
version fermented by the Un
ited States and China.
Sovva said he hoped Ameri
can talk of a boycott was an "ir
ritation" that would fade. "The
doors of Moscow are open,
and we are for the survival of
the Olympics, not destruction.
If someone else wants to de
stroy the games, that's their
business."
lOC business
He echoed the views of Lord
Killanin, head of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee,
saying, "They shouldn't be
used for malicious political
purposes. We keep to this. To
hold or not to hold the games is
the business of the lOC and
the national Olympic commit
tees, and along this line no one
has said anything about not de
siring to participate."
As for Saudi Arabia, which
last week declared it would
boycott the games and called
as well for Islamic boycott,
Sovva said the Saudis had in
formed Moscow last October
they were not interested in par
ticipating. "It was for their own
reasons," he said. "I think it is
impossible to twice reject
proposals of marriage. One
time is enough."
For the Russians, even the
slightest hint of a boycott by
their principal capitalist com
petitors has had a noticeable
dampening effect after five
years of intense preparation to
showcase the Soviet system to
the world. A senior architect
for the huge press center, a
marbled building near the
foreign ministry in central
Moscow, expressed some of
this during a tour of the nearly

finished building.
Much to be ruined
"As an architect, I would like
to see the building work," he
said. "Much would be ruined,
but not only for me, for the
sportsmen as well."
The center will accommo
date several thousand foreign
and Soviet reporters and about
1000 Russians specially trained
in English and other languages
to help the foreigners with
cyrillic difficulties.
The U.S.S.R. has spent un
known hundreds of millions of
rubles and hard currency here
and in Leningrad, Kiev, Tallinn,
and Minsk, the other venues,
to refurbish and enlarge older
stadiums, build new ones, put
up an Olymplic village to
house some 8000 athletes and
their team officials and dress
up their cities for an estimated
200,000 foreign tourists.
Sovva said about 1.5 million
tickets have already been sold
to foreign travel agencies
handling the bookings lor
tourists, and tie expects the
rest to go soon.
But a complication has arisen
in the reprisal cutback of New
York-Moscow Aeroflot flights.
Sovva said the reduction has al
ready meant difficulties for
Soviet Olympic officials
headed to th'e Lake Placid,
N.V., wintergames next month
and, travel plans for some of
them may have been sus
pended.

Sovietsky Sport declared in the
first official acknowledgement
of the issue.
Meanwhile, sources here say
they believe the Soviet sports
command has recently drop
ped veiled hints to foreign offi
cials that a 1980 boycott by the
United States of the Moscow
summer games could open the
door to retaliatory boycotts of
the 1984 games in Los Angeles.
But it was impossible to check
these reports from here Mon
day.
However, a senior Soviet
Olympics official in an inter
view Monday said it is his per
sonal feeling that "it's impos
sible to exclude the Moscow
games between the Lake Placid
and Los Angeles games." But
Vsevolod Sovva, chief of
Olympic press information,
declined to speculate about
any future participation pos
sibilities, calling such ques
tions hypothetical.
But he left no room for doubt
where the Soviets stand on a
possible boycott: ' n>e Olym
pics and a boycott are incom
patible. Any such boycott and
the Olympics would cease to
exist. The Olympic charter
excludes such discrimination,
or any connection between the
games and political purposes."
"Unconnected things"
As for Afghanistan, that situ
ation has been more than
adequately explained by Soviet

President Leonid Brezhnev,
Sovva said, and it has no con
nection to the Olympics. "It is
groundless trying to connect
unconnected things," he said.
Brezhnev has said the Soviet
military intervention was in re
sponse to pleas for assistance
from the Marxist government
in Kabul to defeat internal sub
version fermented by the Un
ited States and China.
Sovva said he hoped Ameri
can talk of a boycott was an "ir
ritation" that would fade. "The
doors of Moscow are open,
and we are for the survival of
the Olympics, not destruction.
If someone else wants to de
stroy the games, that's their
business."
lOC business
He echoed the views of Lord
Killanin, head of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee,
saying, "They shouldn't be
used for malicious political
purposes. We keep to this. To
hold or not to hold the games is
the business of the lOC and
the national Olympic commit
tees, and along this line no one
has said anything about not de
siring to participate."
As for Saudi Arabia, which
last week declared it would
boycott the games and called
as well for Islamic boycott,
Sovva said the Saudis had in
formed Moscow last October
they were not interested in par
ticipating. "It was for their own
reasons," he said. "I think it is
impossible to twice reject
proposals of marriage. One
time is enough."
For the Russians, even the
slightest hint of a boycott by
their principal capitalist com
petitors has had a noticeable
dampening effect after five
years of intense preparation to
showcase the Soviet system to
the world. A senior architect
for the huge press center, a
marbled building near the
foreign ministry in central
Moscow, expressed some of
this during a tour of the nearly

finished building.
Much to be ruined
"As an architect, I would like
to see the building work," he
said. "Much would be ruined,
but not only for me, for the
sportsmen as well."
The center will accommo
date several thousand foreign
and Soviet reporters and about
1000 Russians specially trained
in English and other languages
to help the foreigners with
cyrillic difficulties.
The U.S.S.R. has spent un
known hundreds of millions of
rubles and hard currency here
and in Leningrad, Kiev, Tallinn,
and Minsk, the other venues,
to refurbish and enlarge older
stadiums, build new ones, put
up an Olymplic village to
house some 8000 athletes and
their team officials and dress
up their cities for an estimated
200,000 foreign tourists.
Sovva said about 1.5 million
tickets have already been sold
to foreign travel agencies
handling the bookings lor
tourists, and tie expects the
rest to go soon.
But a complication has arisen
in the reprisal cutback of New
York-Moscow Aeroflot flights.
Sovva said the reduction has al
ready meant difficulties for
Soviet Olympic officials
headed to th'e Lake Placid,
N.V., wintergames next month
and, travel plans for some of
them may have been sus
pended.

Moscow — After a guarded
delay to see which way the
wind might be blowing, the
Soviet Union has reacted with
anger and alarm to a suggested
U.S. boycott of the 1980 Mos
cow Olympics in reprisal for
the Afghanistan invasion.
The official media here have
now labeled the Carter ad
ministration's suggestion
"political blackmail," aimed at
"undermining international
detente and seriously aggravat
ing Soviet-American rela
tions," as the newspaper
Sovietsky Sport declared in the
first official acknowledgement
of the issue.
