The Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service
Cairo — With only eight days to go before
Israel opens an embassy in Cairo, Egyptian sec
urity officers are busy rounding up real or im
aginary dissidents who might attempt to voice
opposition to the new relations between the
erstwhile enemy countries.
In a security swoop started Tuesday morning,
11 people have been arrested so far. More ar
rests are expected, and several people have
gone into hiding after being warned the police
went to their homes in their absence.
There is no definite pattern to this new wave
ot arrests. Nine ot the people arrested are mem
bers of the opposition National Progressive Un
ionists Party. The other 22 appear to be persons
without any political ideology or affiliations and
others who are known to reject the opposition
views, whether communist, "progressive,"
Nasserist or Islamic.
The arrests have not been announced or re
ported in the press here, nor have lawyers been

allowed to visit the detained persons. It is as
sumed they are being held on the frequently
used vague charge of belonging to "secret
communist organizations," under which sus
pects are detained for varying lengths ot time in
what amounts to preventive detention.
In the past year there have been several
hundred arrests and re-arrests on this charge.
But after investigation, the courts have dismis
sed virtually all such cases for lack of evidence.
The present clampdown coincides with the
arrest in Alexandria of Muslim fundamentalists
of the "|ihad" organization, in connection with
explosions in churches in the Mediterranean
city.
A statement Monday night by the state pro
secutor indicated that all those implicated had
been arrested. But the minister of Interior
told the Peoples Assembly that live of that or
ganization's members are still on the run. The
authorities know where they are, he said, and
they will be cauyht.
