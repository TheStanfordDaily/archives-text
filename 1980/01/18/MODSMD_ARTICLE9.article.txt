# Israelis develop desert survival methods

Beersheba, Israel — Half of Is
rael is desert, and some of Is
rael's best brains are trying to
work out the best way for
people to live in the desert
They are the scientists of the
Desert Research Institute.
What they learn can help the
millions of people who live in
the deserts of the world — or
soon will.

In some places the desert is
encroaching on arable land at
the rate of a mile a year, but
that is not the only reason to
study deserts.
"The temperate areas are
full," explained Prof. Daniel
Cohen of the Ben Gurion Uni
versity of the Negev. "That
leaves the mountains, the
jungles and the deserts. Where
can people best move? To the
deserts."
Israel is a prime example.
Most of Israel's people live in
the coast plain, while, south of
Beersheba, stretching 150
miles to the Red Sea, is the
almost-empty Negev desert.
David Ben Gurion, Israel's
first prime minister, loved this
forbidding land. He respected
it, retired to it, and he lies
buried in it. It was he who chal
lenged Israelis to "make the
desert bloom."
Here and there, with back
breaking toil and water
brought from the far end of the
country, Israelis have managed
to do so. At Sde Boker, the
kibbutz where Ben Gurion
lived in retirement until his
death in 197), the fields are
startlingly green against the
dunes beyond.
The thinus beinn done bv

Ben Gurion University and its
institute at Sde Bvoker are
startling, too, in a way that
suggests a farm in Star Wars,
Among the projects:
— Closed-system agricul
ture. A sealed greenhouse cap
tures solar warmth to be fed
back to crops during the cool
night. The crops grow in
water, not soil, in an atmos
phere enriched by pumped-in
carbon dioxide. The sunlight is
filtered by a secret chemical
that is introduced into water
that flows over the greenhouse
panels, turning them into opti
cal filters that cut those rays of
the sun that are harmful.
— Algae farming. What looks
like pond scum is cultivated in
the green wafer of 0-shaped
tanks and stirred to expose it to
the sun. It is high in protein
and can be harvested, dried
and fed to cattle or eaten by
humans.
Desert Architecture —
The desert sun blazes through
what look like dormer win
dows and its heat is captured
by various stone and ceramic
substances. The heat is re
leased at night, to warm living
quarters. In summer the pro
cess is reversed; cool night air
is caueht and stored to hp rp

leased in the daytime.
— Animal studies. The sec
rets of the camel, whose resis
tance to heat and thirst make it
perfectly suited to desert life,
are being unraveled by Israeli
veterinarians in an effort to see
what lessons in adaptability
desert animals can offer men
moving into their ecosystem.
Ecosystem
Ecosystem and interdiscipli
nary are key words at the
Desert Research Institute, al
though the plain-spoken Is
raelis avoid most of the
academic jargon favored by
their scientific colleagues
elsewhere.
"Israel'sacute national prob
lem is to learn how to settle in
the desert," said Dr. Amos
Richmond, director of the De
sert Research Institute. "There
is room for three million new
residents in the Negev. "The
problem is to settle the desert
so it will contribute to the
economy of the country and
maintain the high standards of
the rest of the nation. People
who live here must have the
same standard of living. And it
must be done without damag
ing the ecosystem — the
natural environment of the de
sert."
