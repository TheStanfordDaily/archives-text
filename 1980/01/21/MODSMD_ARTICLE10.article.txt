lehran, Iran — Iran's
100,000-member foreign busi
ness community has shrunk to
about 4000 since the Islamic re
volution last January, accord
ing to informed sources here.
Of the 45,000 American resi
dents during the Shah's reign,
only a handful of individuals

now remain, the sources said.
And the French, formerly
2000 strong, today number no
more than 250, while the Italian
population has dwindled from
15,000 to 1200, and the
Japanese from 8000 to 1000.
The foreign business ele
ment that has stayed on in Iran
has done so either because
money is still owed them or
because they are banking on
better times.
The Italians and the French
tend to be in the first category,
Italian concerns here having
outstanding monies estimated
at $500 billion.
Scarcely operating
The chief executive of a firm
of Roman engineering consul
tants told Agence France-
Presse: "At present we are
scarcely in operation at all.
"We are still hoping to col
lect the 1 billion lire ($1.2 mill
ion) owed us here, though un
fortunately all funds are frozen
and there are no new contracts
in prospect."
In the category of op
timists investing in a better lu
ture are the Japanese and the

West Germans.
At a vast industrial complex
in southern Iran renamed in
honor of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, where 3000
Japanese technicians are
employed, work is currently at
a standstill.
And yet the picture is not all
black: Iran is supplying Japan
with one-third of its total daily
oil output.
As one Japanese technician
said, "We're trying to fill the
gap left by the Americans. By
the year 2000, Iran will have a
population of 50 million, and it
will have a lot of cash and oil to
spare."
He added: "This is a country
to be reckoned with. It's just a
matter of being patient and sit
ting out this transition period."
A French engineer working
at the power station in Tabriz,
Iran's second largest city, said:
"You don't have the feeling
that you're living through a re
volution here. We're working a
10-hout day and our relations
with the Iranian employees are
good."
He added, "In fact, things

are better than they were be
fore. With two million un
employed, workers know the
value of their work."
High labor costs
So, incidentally, do foreign
wage-earners in Iran. Accord
ing to an Iranian senior execu
tive in a steel foundry, some
German experts he employed
now expected a salary of 1100
deutschmarks ($647) a day,
compared to3oodeutschmarks
($176) before the revolution.
Meanwhile, foreign com
panies in Iran are finding it in
creasingly difficult to bring in
skilled employees from home,
and most foreign legations
here have advised their nation
als to send their families home.
Though the official Islamic
revolutionary line ultimately
aims at doing away with
"foreign imperialism," life for
foreigners in Iran is neverthe
less perfectly tolerable.
As one German who stayed
on remarked: "You are well
treated as long as you don't
break the Islamic code—you
don't stare at women and you
don't hit the bottle."
