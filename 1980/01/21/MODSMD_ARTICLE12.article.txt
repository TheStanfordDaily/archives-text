# Workshop on aging
## Today's elderly need love, company 
### Beth Harrison 
People eyed each other
curiously as they entered the
room. A rustle ol papers, a
cough, then the announce
ment that the class was begin
nmg.
The students were nervous
and they were apprehensive ol
some ot the issues they would
have to discuss.
It was no ordinary Stantord
lecture course.
This was the tirst meeting ot
a SWOPSI workshop called
"Political and Social Issues ol
Aging," led by Bruce Butler
and Karen Koman, two Stan
tord students. To open the
class, they explained why and
how they became involved in
gerontology — a relatively new
and unknown lield. Both had
taken Dr. Franklin Ebaugh's
Human Biology course, "Prob
lems ol Aging," and this sum
mer worked on a project that
tocused on health care lor the
elderly.
Students lidgeted as they
were asked why they had de
cided to take the course. One
young woman had watched
her grandmother gradually de
teriorate in a nursing home and
wanted to know how she could
have helped. Others were al
ready involved in working with

the elderly through Stanlord
Christian fellowship and had
become interested in the social
issues ot aging.
Several participants were
older community members
who had worked with the el
derly and were looking tor an
open lorum tor discussing
their experiences.
Diverse
Overall, it was a gathering ol
people ot various
backgrounds, ages and in
terests. But everyone had a de
sire to leain about, to talk ab
out, the neglect that a senior
citizen laces in our society.
In an interview alter class,
Butler and Koman elaborated
on this problem ol neglect.
Koman explained that it takes a
special kind ol person to work
with the aged, while Butler
added that it is hard lor young
people to stay committed to
such a project because tor a
student, schedules change
every three months at the be
ginning ol a new quarter.
"lor an older person," he
said, "three months is like no
thing."
Breaking down- student in
hibitions in working with the
elderly and making them less
alraid both ol their own old age
and ol dealing with older per

sons were the mam reasons
Komon and Butlei decided to
(each the course.
Action project
One way to get the students
directly involved with the el
derly is by assigning an "action
project," an integral part oi
every SWOPSI course.. The ac
tion project can be an intern
ship or research position with
such organizations as the Gray
Panthers and Options tor
Women Over Forty.
Designed to bridge the gap
between school and commun
ity, these projects should pro
vide "an invaluable lirst hand
experience with issues toi
merly discussed on a purely
theoretical plane," the class
syllabus reads.
Butler pointed to some dil
liculties in this approach, how
ever.
Some groups .ire enthusias
tic about student involvement,
but "a lot ol organizations are
really sick ol activist young
people," he remarked. Stu
dents apparently approach
groups olten to do surveys, but
oiter little concrete help.
Koman agreed, commenting
that students olten look at the
elderly like "clinical subjects."
Social, biological
To counter this etlect,

Koman and Butler have care
iLilly chosen their curriculum
to expose students to many as
pects oi aging, the social and
psychologic al lactors as well as
the biological ones. Koman
claimed Mat students cannot
"lationah'e away" the piob
lem willi the class meeting
eveiv week and "the lecturers
won t toddle you."
in llie interview, Koman and
Butler stressed that in this
youth-oriented culture, elderly
peisons suiely deserve as
much attention as other mis
tieated minorities. As Robeit
Atchely writes in an introduc
tion lo a class textbook, Socuil
I'mhlems ol the "Why
should college students be in
teiested in the problems ol ag-
Because the problems oi
old age in America are those
you, personally, are least likely
to escape. No one manages lo
get out ol this world alive
and today most people do not
die without becoming old.''
How to help
Butler and Koman suggested
ways students could confront
the problem: by taking mini
workshops al the University
that deal with aging, by work
ing with the Midpeninsula
Health Service, little House in
Menlo Park or the Senior
Center in Palo Alto. There are
many resources in this area,
Butler stressed.
"No matter what your in
terests are," he said, "there is
something that you tan contri
bute to the held ot gerontol
ogy.
"Although a lot ol people
leel aging is not an issue,
young people should get in
volved to overcome the mor
bid preoccupation they have
with it," Koman said. "It's ex
citing to watch young and old
people interact."

sire to leain about, to talk ab
out, the neglect that a senior
citizen laces in our society.
In an interview alter class,
Butler and Koman elaborated
on this problem ol neglect.
Koman explained that it takes a
special kind ol person to work
with the aged, while Butler
added that it is hard lor young
people to stay committed to
such a project because tor a
student, schedules change
every three months at the be
ginning ol a new quarter.
"lor an older person," he
said, "three months is like no
thing."
Breaking down- student in
hibitions in working with the
elderly and making them less
alraid both ol their own old age
and ol dealing with older per

sons were the mam reasons
Komon and Butlei decided to
(each the course.
Action project
One way to get the students
directly involved with the el
derly is by assigning an "action
project," an integral part oi
every SWOPSI course.. The ac
tion project can be an intern
ship or research position with
such organizations as the Gray
Panthers and Options tor
Women Over Forty.
Designed to bridge the gap
between school and commun
ity, these projects should pro
vide "an invaluable lirst hand
experience with issues toi
merly discussed on a purely
theoretical plane," the class
syllabus reads.
Butler pointed to some dil
liculties in this approach, how
ever.
Some groups .ire enthusias
tic about student involvement,
but "a lot ol organizations are
really sick ol activist young
people," he remarked. Stu
dents apparently approach
groups olten to do surveys, but
oiter little concrete help.
Koman agreed, commenting
that students olten look at the
elderly like "clinical subjects."
Social, biological
To counter this etlect,

Koman and Butler have care
iLilly chosen their curriculum
to expose students to many as
pects oi aging, the social and
psychologic al lactors as well as
the biological ones. Koman
claimed Mat students cannot
"lationah'e away" the piob
lem willi the class meeting
eveiv week and "the lecturers
won t toddle you."
in llie interview, Koman and
Butler stressed that in this
youth-oriented culture, elderly
peisons suiely deserve as
much attention as other mis
tieated minorities. As Robeit
Atchely writes in an introduc
tion lo a class textbook, Socuil
I'mhlems ol the "Why
should college students be in
teiested in the problems ol ag-
Because the problems oi
old age in America are those
you, personally, are least likely
to escape. No one manages lo
get out ol this world alive
and today most people do not
die without becoming old.''
How to help
Butler and Koman suggested
ways students could confront
the problem: by taking mini
workshops al the University
that deal with aging, by work
ing with the Midpeninsula
Health Service, little House in
Menlo Park or the Senior
Center in Palo Alto. There are
many resources in this area,
Butler stressed.
"No matter what your in
terests are," he said, "there is
something that you tan contri
bute to the held ot gerontol
ogy.
"Although a lot ol people
leel aging is not an issue,
young people should get in
volved to overcome the mor
bid preoccupation they have
with it," Koman said. "It's ex
citing to watch young and old
people interact."
People eyed each other
curiously as they entered the
room. A rustle ol papers, a
cough, then the announce
ment that the class was begin
nmg.
The students were nervous
and they were apprehensive ol
some ot the issues they would
have to discuss.
It was no ordinary Stantord
lecture course.
This was the tirst meeting ot
a SWOPSI workshop called
"Political and Social Issues ol
Aging," led by Bruce Butler
and Karen Koman, two Stan
tord students. To open the
class, they explained why and
how they became involved in
gerontology — a relatively new
and unknown lield. Both had
taken Dr. Franklin Ebaugh's
Human Biology course, "Prob
lems ol Aging," and this sum
mer worked on a project that
tocused on health care lor the
elderly.
Students lidgeted as they
were asked why they had de
cided to take the course. One
young woman had watched
her grandmother gradually de
teriorate in a nursing home and
wanted to know how she could
have helped. Others were al
ready involved in working with

the elderly through Stanlord
Christian fellowship and had
become interested in the social
issues ot aging.
Several participants were
older community members
who had worked with the el
derly and were looking tor an
open lorum tor discussing
their experiences.

people ot various
