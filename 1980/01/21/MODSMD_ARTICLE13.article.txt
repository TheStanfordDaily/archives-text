Washington — For the first time since the early
19705, the U.S. government is preparing to pay
large numbers of farmers not to grow grain.
A new farm strategy, now on President Jimmy
Carter's desk, would reverse the policy the De
partment of Agriculture announced only two
months ago of telling farmers to "plant fence
row to fence row" and grow all the grain they
could.
The president's decision to partially embargo
grain sales to the Soviet Union and an expectedly
abundant harvest have forced the sudden tur
naround in farm policy.
The switch in signals would add a little to the
federal budget deficit and would cost consum
ers money by artifically propping up food
prices, which had been expected to decline
this year.
The key tactic would be to pay farmers not to
plant at least three to four million acres of corn
this spring. Agricultural economists figure the
government would have to pay farmers at least
$60 million to take that much land out of produc
tion.
$ »() million
A modest program to cut this spring's wheat
harvest and other efforts to curb production of
some minor crops are also under consideration.
They would cost about $30 million.
No decision has been made on the new pol
icy, but it was recommended to Carter last

week. He is expected to act on it today before
the Democratic precinct caucuses in lowa, the
leading corn-growing state.
Paying farmers not to grow grain was the cor
nerstone of the Nixon administration's farm pol
icy. Since 1974, when the Soviets unexpectedly
stepped in and bought up America's surplus
grain, the government has moved away from
production curbs.
Instead it has been able to support farm in
comes by encouraging exports of grain. The 17
million metric tons of grain that the president
withheld from the Soviets two weeks ago here
were to have been sold in a five-year program
that has meant billions of dollars to American
farmers.
Hold off market
To protect farmers from the loss of Soviet
business, the administration has been forced to
promise to buy the Russians' grain and hold it off
the market.
That takes care of last year's record crop, but
planting time is coming soon in the Corn Belt,
and farmers have indicated they want to plant
even more land with corn this year.
Returning to a paid cropland diversion prog
ram would protect farmers from a precipitous
drop in their incomes in this election year.
While no decision on the diversion program
has been made, Agriculture Department offi
cials have hinted at it repeatedly in the daily
brietings they give on the grain situation.
