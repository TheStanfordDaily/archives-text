# Birds mess up small town
## 
### 
Patterson, Calif. (AP) — Alter trying everything
trom shotgun assaults to rubber snakes, otlicials
here don't know how to cope with pigeons that
have dirtied city streets and ruttled the leathers
of some townsfolk.
The pigeon problem first was noticed about a
year ago when the birds began lo roost in palm
trees that circle the center of town.
After months ol discussion, the city council
told police chiel Louis Ruddick to organize a
"tiring squad." And, on two recent occasions,
the chiel sent a squad ol shotgun-toting ollicers
into town with orders to "shoot lo kill."
"II we can get them on the wing, then we have
a real opportunity," says Ruddick, who also
serves as animal control ollicer.
"There's only about 4(H) ol them, but hell,
we're only a tiny town. When you take those 400
birds and put them over our lew buildings, they
make a hell ol a mess " he added in an interview
last week.
Ruddick's men bagged 72 birds, but the sight
ol patrolmen perched on the library steps with
shotguns hasn't won the lavor ot many ol the
city's 4000 residents. Neither has the shooting.
The councilmen heard that toy snakes could

he used to scare oil the pigeons. So they sent
Councilman |ohn Ramos to Narty's General
Store to get some ot the ruhhery reptiles.
Ramos planted the snakes in strategic loca-
Mons atop the hotel Hotel del Puerto, where a
regional meeting ot the League ol California
Cities was scheduled.
At tirst, a tew pigeons spotted the snakes and
took oil loi the palm trees. Hut, within a lew
days, the problem seemed worse than ever.
"There must he 800 ol them up on the root.
I here's a herd ol them," jokes Ramos. "We have
to do something. I'm one ol the councilmen up
lor reelection this year."
I he council considered the use ol special leed
lo make the buds sterile, thereby preventing
luture hatchings. But Ramos doesn't think the
leed idea would work.
"What are you going lo do, sterilize the pi
geons and then wait tor them to grow old and
die! 1 That could lake liv e years," he laughs.
In the meantime, city officials have given up
on trying to get rid ol the birds betore the league
meeting. They just hope league officials react
kindly when they tind out what is being served
lor dinner: Cornish game hen, the real thing.
