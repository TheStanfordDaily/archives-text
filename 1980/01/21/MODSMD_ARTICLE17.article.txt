## Tune in a New Wavelength 
### 
"I want to be sedated," the
lyrics shrieked between jump
ing legsand hecticarms flailing
on the dance floor. Red and
green lights blinked like a
drunk stoplight and the crowd
was oblivious, so frantic was the
sporadic, electric movement.
Walking up to X's Annex on a
hopping Saturday night, it was
my first exposure (and I don't
use that word lightly) to New
Wave, the phenomenon
sweeping the states.
Elvis Costello and the
Rubinos, leopard boots and
latex pants . . . what do I
know? I've been in Florence for
three months. I thought new
wave was an update on the
Dorothy Hamill hair-cut. Well,
I was almost right, give or take
a few splotches of purple high
light giving a slightly finger
painted appearance to an
otherwise sick imitation of a
dirty kitchen mop.
I'm no disco fiend to begin
with. Those rotating sequin
chandeliers were fine for the
prom and Donna Summer is
great to do sit-ups to but nou
it's new wave and I feel so
"square." I mean, I am the
original Loggins and Messm.i
fan.
Standing in line, making the
crucial decision between iiu*
disco room or an .uillu-nIK
NewWave concert I was taken
by the outrageous outhts.
Black pants, so tight I think I
could tile tor premeditated
homocide by suffocation, it I
ever attempted to zip up a pair.
And snazzy shirts boy the
type that repel sweat. Assorted
leathers, chains and even a pair
of stirrups crammed on to the
floor to join the nobbing
couples.
After a couple oi unsuccess
ful attempts at an odd mixture
ot the hustle and twist, I gave
up my new wave career and re
turned to the bar lor my under
21 club soda and an hour of
fascinating people watching.
My date joined me, a bit disap
pointed with my un-rally at

titude. We met a wild couple
though.
Laura was an art major from
Berkeley who did est seven
years ago and thought discos
were too judgmental. (It's a
good thing she wasn't
psychic). Her date, Derrick,
was a charming chap from
London working on a Ph.D. in
entomology. I thought he was
collecting specimens out on
Broadway. We chatted for a
while about "punk" and ex
changed our lavorite graffiti. It
was really "intense."
When we crawled out past
one a.m. I lelt richer for the
experience. I also felt compel
led to share a few tips with
those ot you, like me, who are
rookies in this new wave busi
ness.
1) Be sure to wear a pair of
sunglasses. It's very vogue and
ydu might he able to avoid se
eing the lolks moaning ecstati
(ally as Uma jab into your ribs.
2 > While dancing, be sure to

maintain a very stoic expres
sion on your face. Smiling is
not in.
3) Before you leave, borrow
one of those combs used to
brush a dog's hair with and run
it through your hair. Then,
wear a paper bag over your
head until you're on Highway
101 so no one recognizes you.
4) Don't mention Stanford.
Most of the couples are still in
high school and they can't "re
late" to your experience.
5) If you like to sing-a-long,
make up your own words and
be sure the lyrics are com
pletely ludicrous. You could be
on your way to a lucrative
career.
6) If you do end up getting
into the spirit, don't show it, I
think it's supposed to be some
kind of protest.
Oh, and if you see Laura,
give her my love.
