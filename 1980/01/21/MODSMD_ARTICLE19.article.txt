## A
						too-close-for-comfort Ivy League encounter 
### 
The last Samtrans bus left
San Francisco titteen minutes
late and h\ the time the wheels
finally rolled most of the pas
sengers, myself included, were
pretty close to sleep.
But the fellow in front of me
was wide-awake, sickeningly
so. His eyes darted around the
bus, and when they settled on
me he spoke rather loudly.
"Are you going all the way to
Palo Alto?"
"Yes," I replied, thinking
that a good guess.
"I thought so. Are you a stu
dent there, at Stanford? You
look like an undergraduate."
His tone was more than a little
superior.
"Yeah," I responded, "what
are you, a grad student?" I
meant it as an insult, because

after being an undergraduate
the thing i d like to be least is a
graduate student.
"Oh, goodness, no." He
didn't speak again until we
were on the Bayshore Freeway,
and by that time the bus had
filled with a collection of
shady-looking characters.
"Where do you live nor
mally?"
"Los Angeles."
He sniffed at that. "I have
never been there, nor do I wish
to go. Have you always lived
there?"
"Well, I spent a little time in
Connecticut."
"Oh yes?" That excited him,
and he began to twitch and
look around as if he'd had a
quart of coffee for supper. "I
once went to school there,

many years ago, at Yale. Four
teen years ago, in fact."
I was about to tell him I'd
gone there and fled with fear
after the first year, but he
looked like the type who
would get very angry at that.
He was a real Ivy Leaguer.
Even at 12:30 Saturday morn
ing he was wearing the tweeds,
the flannels, the topsiders. His
sportshirt had an alligator on it
and his hair looked as if he'd
just spent an hour combing it,
trying to hide a huge bald spot.
On the 7F Palo Alto Express at
that hour he was not incon
spicuous.
"I didn't go to Yale origi
nally," he continued, "trans
ferred from Columbia. I went
to Harvard and Princeton to do
grad work and also to Cornell

for a short time. But I liked Yale
the best of any of them. Har
vard is unmentionable, Prince
ton provincial and Cornell iso
lated."
I felt as if I were talking to
a Barron's Guide. He spoke
loudly and the people on the
bus began to stare at us. They
looked as if they didn't know
what he was talking about and
didn't like it.
"What is your major/' he
thundered.
"Comparative literature," I
mumbled.
His look was a mixture of
anger and disgust. "Haven't
you asked anyone what the job
prospects are like in comp.
lit?"
"No."
"Why not?"
"I didn't think there was a
job field in comp. lit."
"Then why are you majoring
in it?"
I tried to think of something
smart to say but couldn't, so he
went on without an answer.
"I believe in getting a well
rounded education, but I can't
see majoring in something
that's not employable. You
should take courses in litera
ture but major in engineering
or go to law school. Otherwise,
in a few years, you'll find your
self working in a bookstore for
$5 an hour. I majored in en

gineering and today I have my
choice of jobs."
The other passengers turned
their gazes from him to me, as
if they thought that he was
right, or that I should contest
him, or maybe they were really
just bored. But one man on the
other side of the vehicle broke
in.
"Now, you see, you're
wrong there, mister. I majored
in physics at Stanford, even
though everybody told me en
gineering'd get me a better
job. I had a great time. You
oughta take the classes you en
joy, regardless of whether or
not they'll get you a job."
The Yale Man's mouth drop
ped open.
The speaker looked unruly
and dishevelled. He wore a
dirty, torn green sweatshirt
and blue jeans. He was not any
fatter than Orson Welles.
Between sentences he sip
ped from a bottle of whiskey,
something you're not sup
posed to do on the bus.
"Now the job I'd like to
have" he continued, "is being
a rock and roll singer . . . .
That's what I've been doing in
the city tonight, listening to
some rock and roll. But I
couldn't make it in that busi
ness, 'cause I'm too fat and my
voice isn't right for it."
He proved his point by

laughing with the sort ot high
pitched noise a Volkswagen
makes going through a tunnel.
Somewhere around Belmont
the Ivy Leaguer recovered from
shock enough to argue with
the fellow, but he gave up
when the fat man told him he
had a hundred grand per year
job as a physics consultant.
Numbed, he simply whispered
"Good Luck" when exiting the
bus in Menlo Park. I felt vindi
cated.
The chubby man lurched to
the seat in front of me ana
turned.
"Thanks for agreeing with
me," I said. "I'm with you 100
percent."
"Hell, no problem," he said.
"Exceptin' that everything I
said was bull. I ain't heard of
half those schools he was talk
ing about and I wouldn't have
heard of Stanford except that I
live in Palo Alto. And I don't
have no big job neither. I'm
just a grease monkey on
Fords."
He coughed and wheezed
and got off at the next stop.
You could smell the liquor on
his breath even as he walked to
the doors.
He was a good man to have
on my side.
