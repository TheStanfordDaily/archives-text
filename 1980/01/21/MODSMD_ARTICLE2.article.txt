# Public policy program slated
## 
### 
By Monika Cuttman
A new interdisciplinary program in public policy will
begin here in September, and the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies (CUS) will decide later this month
whether to recommend that the program constitute a
full-fledged major.
Consisting of a series of "core" courses, the program
has been designed over the past two years by members
of various University departments, including political
science, statistics, sociology and economics.
"There have always seemed to be people around
here, from the law school to the business school, who
work in public policy, but as yet there has been no
institutional focus," said Dave Mowery, assistant direc
tor of the program.
"My impression is that there is quite a bit of interest
among students and faculty in this type of program," he
said.
According to a leaflet on the programs, the proposed
major is "a response to the growing complexity of the
interactions between the public and private sectors in all
areas of modern life, as well as recognition of the need
to address these issues with the intellectual resources of
several academic disciplines."
The plan has received a grant from the Andrew Sloane
Foundation for its first three years, said Economics Prof.
Nathan Rosenberg, director of the program. "Now it is up
to the CUS to decide if the program will be implemented
as a major," he added.
Decision )an. 30
Carolyn Lougee of the CUS said that the committee
would decide Jan. 30 whether the program would qualify
as a degree-granting department.
"The program in public policy will have either an in
terdisciplinary structure like Values, Technology and
Society (VTS), which does not grant degrees, or like
International Relations, which does," she said.
The program is designed to "bring to bear a more

broad set of perspectives," said Assistant Director
Mowery.
Series to debut
In academic year 1980-81, a series of core courses will
be open to students who have taken the necessary pre
requisites. The proposed classes include "Economics
and Public Policy," to be taught by Prof, lames Rosse;
"Ethical Aspects of Public Policy Decision Making," and
"Quantitative Methods and their Applications to Public
Policy."
After students complete the core sequence, they will
take 10 more units of work in an area of public policy
formulation, such as health care, arms control or
energy.
A summer internship is also being planned to follow
the completion of the core sequence of courses.
Complementary courses
"There already are some courses in public policy in
the University, such as Human Biology 40 (Public
Decision-making Regarding Human Health), which
could hopefully be complementary to the program,"
said Mowery.
Mowery admitted that there has been some difficulty
in defining what exactly constitutes "public policy."
"So far, it has only been functionally defined," he
said. "For instance, policy is seen by in terms of where it
happens and what it accomplishes." There have been
continuing efforts to give the term a more interdisciplinary
association, Mowery added.
A University program, he said, would help to establish
a more coherent set of disciplines.
According to other departments in the University,
students are interested in taking public policy courses.
"The Human Biology program already has a strong
public policy focus," said Kevin Reel, a student adviser
in that department. "Classes in the policy area are always
overcrowded."
