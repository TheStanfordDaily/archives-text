Darling Dollies
I wish to compliment and
thank the Stanford band and
especially the Dollies of your
fine school for the extraordi
nary celebration they brought
to Washington State University
at last Friday night's WSU-
Stanford basketball game.
Although our university won
the basketball contest, that
achievement pales compared
to the delightful and exciting
show your Dollies gave to our
student body and fans.
Following the game, these
beautiful visions of sweetness
and light provided a magical
display of dance and unbridled
joy for a fortunate few of us
who came to admire these girls
and begged them to dance on.
I confess my love for these
striking dancers who gladly
granted our requests and so
gave us a memory that will long
be cherished.
I don't even know their
names and I must have seemed
the model of incapacity to
them, but after they had given
us a special show, they chatted
and smiled with me and the
remaining others who learned

that these girls with their
dynamic sexuality, unbounded
exuberance and irresistable
charm are also capable of ex
tending warmth and friendli
ness.

Two-sided issue
I genuinely look forward to
reading the Daily following the
installation of the additional
news services, and the result
ing improved balance between
local and national/
international news.
I similarly applaud the Dai
ly's policies on access to edito
rial space. It seems to have al
lowed both sides of opinions
on the situation in Iran to be
aired.
This policy is in contrast to
those of the press in the Bay
Area, and I fear to say, Califor
nia and most of the nation.
I consider the holding of th®
hostages an untenable act. I
am, however, candidly
ashamed of America's reaction

to the situation. We have seen
the acts of wanton violence
against Iranian nationals or
people who could very well be
American citizens.
I am bothered by the incon
sistent enforcement of the
immigration laws and their use
as "foreign policy," the rights
of individuals residing here to
equal protection seem unde
niably compromised.
I believe there is little ques
tion that America has been an
imperialist force in Eastern and
Third World countries; its
support of the Shah was essen
tially a quid pro quo for the
continued flow of natural re
sources from the Persian Gulf.
Recognition of that fact does
not condone the holding of
hostages; nor does the holding
of hostages justify the reaction
of the majority of Americans,
which has ranged from vindic
tiveness to overt racism, and is
tawdrily rationalized as re
sponding in kind.
