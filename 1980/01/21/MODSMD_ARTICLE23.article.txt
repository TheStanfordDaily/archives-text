## Disturbed by Connally 
### 
While I do not argue David
Yob's contentions that oil is
getting scarce, Carter has been
ineffectual, and Connally is
tough, I find his arguments for
a Connally presidency very dis
turbing. This is partly because
of what Connally stands for.
Such as racism. He opposed
the desegregation of public ac
commodations sections of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, meaning
he didn't want blacks in public
(white folks') bathrooms.
Further, upon hearing of
Martin Luther King's assassina
tion, he noted that the non
violent Peace Prize-winning
minister "had contributed
much to the chaos and strife
and the confusion and the un
certainty in this country."
No friend of the poor or the

elderly either, Connally has
opposed minimum wage laws,
was the first governor to fight
against the war-on-poverty
program, and tried to veto
Medicare in Texas.
Rather, Connally maintains
hundreds of compro
mising corporate ties, in
volving Big Business, Big Oil,
Big Banks, and so on. Where
environmental regulations in
terfere with corporate profit,
he could be expected, as pres
ident, to relax those standards.
He has ignored conservation
and alternative energy plans
and unquestioningly supports
nuclear power, including the
deployment of the fast breeder
reactor (even though a breeder
reactor in Detroit suffered a
partial meltdown in 1966).
With respect to foreign pol
icy, a vote for Connally is a vote
for the draft, corruption and
increased military interven
tion. Connally believes the Un
ited States should be prepared
to take military action in the
Middle East if such aggression
is necessary to ensure an
adequate oil supply.
Connally also believes U.S.
corporations should be al
lowed to bribe foreign officials
in nations where bribery laws
are not strictly enforced.
And it wasn't long ago that
Connally was vigorously sup

porting the disastrous war on
Vietnam — calling its oppo
nents treasonous, and urging
Nixon to escalate the bombing
of North Vietnam with the
words "caution be damned."
Yob would lead us to believe
that the lessons of Vietnam
have perhaps been learned
"too well." But the loss of mill
ions of American, Vietnamese,
Cambodian and Laotian lives
seems to have had no effect on
Connally or his policies, much
less any permanent effect on
the American people.
The lesson of Vietnam — not
to mention Iran or Nicaragua
— is that the best way to prom
ote real democracy, oppose
communism, and truly aid
other nations is not by in
creased military and corporate
aid, not by setting up and sup
porting cruel puppet dictator
ships, and not by treating other
nations and their people as in
ferior or subhuman. But this is
a lesson that John Connally's
and Big Business' obsession
with "Big Profits" will never
allow them to learn.
