It was immediately clear from their devilish grins that I had no
chance in this race. Sidney Brown, the trainer told me, was a nag.
Dog meat.
Isn't that just perfect. You get a once-in-a-litetime chance to
harness race under the spotlights on a crystal-clear night before
thousands of people, and you draw a 14-year-old horse with
braces on its tront legs to ease the pain ol its arthritis.
I tried to make a joke out of the sad situation and everyone
around seemed happy to hear that it was now a ii\ e-person race,
with the sixth entrant content to finish his one-mile jaunt before
the next scheduled race, 20 minutes later.
Exactly how six Stanford seniors came to spend Saturday night
away from the enticing carrels of Green I ibrary risking t heir necks
riding on a flimsy two-wheeled cart with a horse-tail view is a long
story. Let it suffice to say that we were randomly sele( ted from a
list of students compiled by Patria Scruggs, a promotional rep
resentative from the City whose task it has been to try to interest
younger people in harness racing. This is the pusher principle
applied to racing: get them betting while they're young and
c arefree and they'll soon be addicted to spending their free time
.it the S5 Win, Place and Show windows.
The six of us, Ted Gardenswartz, Sally Scandalios, Mark
•\ntweil, Nancy White, Tom Gart and myself were told about our
selection and days later whisked off in a rented station wagon to
Bay Meadows to learn how to harness race. So far, so good.
We were to leave from the front of the Quad at 7:30 a.m. for our
first practice. Not ones toscheduleß a.m. classes but good sports
nonetheless, we met Patria under threatening skies.

We arrived at the track by 8 a.m. to meet the trainers who, in
just two short morning practices, would teach us to survive the
big race. Winning wasn't in our minds then, only survival.
According to the old hands, the track was its muddiest in 12
years. As we approached the backstretch break in the fence
where we would begin our muddy tour, a few humans behind
their horses came oft the oval. Vou couldn't tell if they were male
or female, blac k or white, old or young. They were all encased in
the muddiest mud I've every seen. They couldn't see, breathe or
hear.
A fresh horse with a friendly looking driver came along, and as
he entered the sea of soil, Tom Cart took our dare and jumped
alongside the weathered man to learn the fine points of harness
racing.
Before he completed his first lap, I blindlyacquiesced to be the
sec ond guinea pig. After being told which direc tion to tace, I held
on tor dear life as we breezed around with the driving rain and
splattering mud in our faces.
I looked at the people we passed and those who passed us (I
noticed there were significantly more of the latter) to try to learn
what sort of person gets out of the sack before sunrise to do this.
It was impossible to tell exactly in such a short time, but I can tell
you this: they were the friendliest people you'd ever want to
meet. Iheir love for horses was obvious, and they couldn't help
but take under their >irm anyone who showed the least bit of
interest in their livelihood.
After two laps alongside a driver more trusting than I would
have been in the situation, we approached the stopping point. I
was ready to stop. But evidently the horse needed a couple ot
additional miles of exercise. So rather than share the indescriba
bly uncomfortable with me, he had me slow the horse down.
And then he jumped otf and told me to "take heraround a couple
'a more miles." Belore I could protest that maybe, just maybe, I
wasn't ready tor the task, he vyas standing kppe-deep in the mud
behind me and it w$$ off to thfc races.
I must say at'this point that I have never'had too great an affinity
for horses. The last time before this one that I had any contact
whatsoever with equestrial being was when I was six years old
and the neighbor's Shetland Pony bucked me off, much to my
dismay and dissatisfaction. But back to the 1980s.
After the ordeal was over and I had stepped gingerly into the
mud, we slopped over to the stables where a hose lay ready to
dense our faceless bodies.
We stood there near the track as horses emerged from and
entered into the stable area where 750 harness-racers are kept
during the winter. We were still half caked in mud and half
soaked in near-freezing water. We were cold. We were still shak
ing a bit from our experiences. And we all agreed that we had
never had so much fun. Nothing could stop us from returning the
next morning to repeat the madness.
Everything was much the same the next day, except that the
track had dried out a great deal and the sun was shining. The mud
wasn't gone, but at least you could see where you were going.
After our solo laps, it became clear we probably would survive the
race.
We were also learning something about horses. Well, most of
us were, anyway. Nancy White explained to us in seeming seri

ousness that when she was riding behind the horse, she didn't
know what sex it was, so she took a guess and said horse-riding
things like "Ciddyap girl" and "Whoa girl." After a few chuckles
from everyone around, a few of us explained to Nancy how to tell
the male from female horses.
Atter our second practice, our race predictions were set.
Nancy, despite her unfamiliarity with the animals, and I after two
davs of solo experience, were the favorites.
Ted and Tom tried to downplay their credible performances to
lull the rest of us into a sense of false security and Mark, with only
one day's experience under his belt, was an unknown quantity.
And then there was Sally. Sally got along well with the horses
she practiced with. They evidently appreciated the lact that she
didn't work them too hard. A nice, steady walking pace was fine
tor them it it was fine with the person behind them. Horses aren't
smart enough to realize that their driver may be more interested
in survival than speed. Clearly, Sally was a strong believer in
survival. She would surprise us.
Ted was a sleeper. He sneaked in more laps by the end than any
ot the rest of us, without any of us even noticing. Talk about a low
profile. I think now that he really wanted to win.
Soon it was Saturday night. We arrived early to have dinner at
the Turf Club. Yes, it really is called the Turf Club. No, there isn't
any turf there. But the food is good and the price was certainly
right (free).
Our stomachs were churning, and our dates tried to calm us, to
no avail. It was simply a nerve-racking situation. The bright lights
shone on the track. The large crowd milled about near the betting
windows. The bugle call that reminds you of theKentucky Derby
sounded before each race. My whole body was shaking. And to
increase the pressure, we were allowed only one drink before the
race. One drink doesn't help in a situation like this. Several might
help. Many would help.
Finally it was time. We were led down to the jockey's dressing
room via the private elevator from the executive section. We
climbed into the racing silks of the regular drivers and made our
way to the paddock to meet our horses.
It was then I learned the life story of Sidney Brown, a New
Zealand product who was a pretty good stretch runner in his

prime. He had won about $60,000 in prize money during his life.
But his life was now near its end. I winced at the thought of
pouring Sidney out of a bottle of Elmer's Clue next year. Maybe
he was about to catch his second wind, I thought. Maybe his
experience, which about doubled that of any other horse in the
race, would pay off in this pressure-packed situation.
My strategy was clear. Sidney knew more about this game than
I. It would be his race from start to finish. If he wanted to take an
early lead, fine with me. If he wanted to wait in the wings until the
stretch to overtake the tiring newcomers, tine.
We followed the white Cadillac carrying the starting gate
around the track on our way to the starting line. As the pace
increased, the tension of the spectacle was getting to me. I was
scared. Maybe I had made a mistake. Maybe Sidney and I could
just pull up and I could tell everyone later that I had saved his life
by not pushing him to the point of destruction. But then it was too
late. The race had begun and I was already looking at the backs of
the other five entrants.
As planned, Sidney ran his own race. But it wasn't what I'd
hoped for. Sidney's best days were long behind him. My
thoughts were not directed at avoiding the unjustifiable: finish
ing last. Entering the fourth turn, however, that's just where we
we. Dead last. But true to form, Sidney, the stretch runner, made
up ground like Secretariat and in response to my war hoops,
passed Nancy and Mark, who had faded fast after an early lead.
On the stretch, the magnitude of my loss was apparent. Ted
was light years ahead of everyone. Tom and Sally, whose fear of
extreme speeds had evidently subsided during the excitement,
finished two and three, respectively. I humbly crossed the wire in
fourth, followed closely by Mark and Nancy.
The losers gamely congratulated Ted and Tom, who will repre
sent Stanford on Feb. 2 against the top two finishers from Cal and
San Francisco State, who will have survived a similar ordeal by
then.
I think I'll go to Bay Meadows that night to watch the race. If
Sidney Brown is still alive I hope a Cal Weenie draws him so I can
watch him or her try to prod that arthritic old nag to a last place
finish. My sympathies won't be with the driver, however: I'll be
thinking of poor old Sidney Brown. I really hope he doesn't end
up as dog meat. He did his best. If only wecouldhave run the race
10 years ago. Then we could have taken 'em.

Isn't that just perfect. You get a once-in-a-litetime chance to
harness race under the spotlights on a crystal-clear night before
thousands of people, and you draw a 14-year-old horse with
braces on its tront legs to ease the pain ol its arthritis.
I tried to make a joke out of the sad situation and everyone
around seemed happy to hear that it was now a ii\ e-person race,
with the sixth entrant content to finish his one-mile jaunt before
the next scheduled race, 20 minutes later.
Exactly how six Stanford seniors came to spend Saturday night
away from the enticing carrels of Green I ibrary risking t heir necks
riding on a flimsy two-wheeled cart with a horse-tail view is a long
story. Let it suffice to say that we were randomly sele( ted from a
list of students compiled by Patria Scruggs, a promotional rep
resentative from the City whose task it has been to try to interest
younger people in harness racing. This is the pusher principle
applied to racing: get them betting while they're young and
c arefree and they'll soon be addicted to spending their free time
.it the S5 Win, Place and Show windows.
The six of us, Ted Gardenswartz, Sally Scandalios, Mark
•\ntweil, Nancy White, Tom Gart and myself were told about our
selection and days later whisked off in a rented station wagon to
Bay Meadows to learn how to harness race. So far, so good.
We were to leave from the front of the Quad at 7:30 a.m. for our
first practice. Not ones toscheduleß a.m. classes but good sports
nonetheless, we met Patria under threatening skies.

We arrived at the track by 8 a.m. to meet the trainers who, in
just two short morning practices, would teach us to survive the
big race. Winning wasn't in our minds then, only survival.
According to the old hands, the track was its muddiest in 12
years. As we approached the backstretch break in the fence
where we would begin our muddy tour, a few humans behind
their horses came oft the oval. Vou couldn't tell if they were male
or female, blac k or white, old or young. They were all encased in
the muddiest mud I've every seen. They couldn't see, breathe or
hear.
A fresh horse with a friendly looking driver came along, and as
he entered the sea of soil, Tom Cart took our dare and jumped
alongside the weathered man to learn the fine points of harness
racing.
Before he completed his first lap, I blindlyacquiesced to be the
sec ond guinea pig. After being told which direc tion to tace, I held
on tor dear life as we breezed around with the driving rain and
splattering mud in our faces.
I looked at the people we passed and those who passed us (I
noticed there were significantly more of the latter) to try to learn
what sort of person gets out of the sack before sunrise to do this.
It was impossible to tell exactly in such a short time, but I can tell
you this: they were the friendliest people you'd ever want to
meet. Iheir love for horses was obvious, and they couldn't help
but take under their >irm anyone who showed the least bit of
interest in their livelihood.
After two laps alongside a driver more trusting than I would
have been in the situation, we approached the stopping point. I
was ready to stop. But evidently the horse needed a couple ot
additional miles of exercise. So rather than share the indescriba
bly uncomfortable with me, he had me slow the horse down.
And then he jumped otf and told me to "take heraround a couple
'a more miles." Belore I could protest that maybe, just maybe, I
wasn't ready tor the task, he vyas standing kppe-deep in the mud
behind me and it w$$ off to thfc races.
I must say at'this point that I have never'had too great an affinity
for horses. The last time before this one that I had any contact
whatsoever with equestrial being was when I was six years old
and the neighbor's Shetland Pony bucked me off, much to my
dismay and dissatisfaction. But back to the 1980s.
After the ordeal was over and I had stepped gingerly into the
mud, we slopped over to the stables where a hose lay ready to
dense our faceless bodies.
We stood there near the track as horses emerged from and
entered into the stable area where 750 harness-racers are kept
during the winter. We were still half caked in mud and half
soaked in near-freezing water. We were cold. We were still shak
ing a bit from our experiences. And we all agreed that we had
never had so much fun. Nothing could stop us from returning the
next morning to repeat the madness.
Everything was much the same the next day, except that the
track had dried out a great deal and the sun was shining. The mud
wasn't gone, but at least you could see where you were going.
After our solo laps, it became clear we probably would survive the
race.
We were also learning something about horses. Well, most of
us were, anyway. Nancy White explained to us in seeming seri

ousness that when she was riding behind the horse, she didn't
know what sex it was, so she took a guess and said horse-riding
things like "Ciddyap girl" and "Whoa girl." After a few chuckles
from everyone around, a few of us explained to Nancy how to tell
the male from female horses.
Atter our second practice, our race predictions were set.
Nancy, despite her unfamiliarity with the animals, and I after two
davs of solo experience, were the favorites.
Ted and Tom tried to downplay their credible performances to
lull the rest of us into a sense of false security and Mark, with only
one day's experience under his belt, was an unknown quantity.
And then there was Sally. Sally got along well with the horses
she practiced with. They evidently appreciated the lact that she
didn't work them too hard. A nice, steady walking pace was fine
tor them it it was fine with the person behind them. Horses aren't
smart enough to realize that their driver may be more interested
in survival than speed. Clearly, Sally was a strong believer in
survival. She would surprise us.
Ted was a sleeper. He sneaked in more laps by the end than any
ot the rest of us, without any of us even noticing. Talk about a low
profile. I think now that he really wanted to win.
Soon it was Saturday night. We arrived early to have dinner at
the Turf Club. Yes, it really is called the Turf Club. No, there isn't
any turf there. But the food is good and the price was certainly
right (free).
Our stomachs were churning, and our dates tried to calm us, to
no avail. It was simply a nerve-racking situation. The bright lights
shone on the track. The large crowd milled about near the betting
windows. The bugle call that reminds you of theKentucky Derby
sounded before each race. My whole body was shaking. And to
increase the pressure, we were allowed only one drink before the
race. One drink doesn't help in a situation like this. Several might
help. Many would help.
Finally it was time. We were led down to the jockey's dressing
room via the private elevator from the executive section. We
climbed into the racing silks of the regular drivers and made our
way to the paddock to meet our horses.
It was then I learned the life story of Sidney Brown, a New
Zealand product who was a pretty good stretch runner in his

prime. He had won about $60,000 in prize money during his life.
But his life was now near its end. I winced at the thought of
pouring Sidney out of a bottle of Elmer's Clue next year. Maybe
he was about to catch his second wind, I thought. Maybe his
experience, which about doubled that of any other horse in the
race, would pay off in this pressure-packed situation.
My strategy was clear. Sidney knew more about this game than
I. It would be his race from start to finish. If he wanted to take an
early lead, fine with me. If he wanted to wait in the wings until the
stretch to overtake the tiring newcomers, tine.
We followed the white Cadillac carrying the starting gate
around the track on our way to the starting line. As the pace
increased, the tension of the spectacle was getting to me. I was
scared. Maybe I had made a mistake. Maybe Sidney and I could
just pull up and I could tell everyone later that I had saved his life
by not pushing him to the point of destruction. But then it was too
late. The race had begun and I was already looking at the backs of
the other five entrants.
As planned, Sidney ran his own race. But it wasn't what I'd
hoped for. Sidney's best days were long behind him. My
thoughts were not directed at avoiding the unjustifiable: finish
ing last. Entering the fourth turn, however, that's just where we
we. Dead last. But true to form, Sidney, the stretch runner, made
up ground like Secretariat and in response to my war hoops,
passed Nancy and Mark, who had faded fast after an early lead.
On the stretch, the magnitude of my loss was apparent. Ted
was light years ahead of everyone. Tom and Sally, whose fear of
extreme speeds had evidently subsided during the excitement,
finished two and three, respectively. I humbly crossed the wire in
fourth, followed closely by Mark and Nancy.
The losers gamely congratulated Ted and Tom, who will repre
sent Stanford on Feb. 2 against the top two finishers from Cal and
San Francisco State, who will have survived a similar ordeal by
then.
I think I'll go to Bay Meadows that night to watch the race. If
Sidney Brown is still alive I hope a Cal Weenie draws him so I can
watch him or her try to prod that arthritic old nag to a last place
finish. My sympathies won't be with the driver, however: I'll be
thinking of poor old Sidney Brown. I really hope he doesn't end
up as dog meat. He did his best. If only wecouldhave run the race
10 years ago. Then we could have taken 'em.

thousands of people, and you draw a 14-year-old horse with
braces on its tront legs to ease the pain ol its arthritis.
I tried to make a joke out of the sad situation and everyone
around seemed happy to hear that it was now a ii\ e-person race,
with the sixth entrant content to finish his one-mile jaunt before
the next scheduled race, 20 minutes later.
Exactly how six Stanford seniors came to spend Saturday night
away from the enticing carrels of Green I ibrary risking t heir necks
riding on a flimsy two-wheeled cart with a horse-tail view is a long
story. Let it suffice to say that we were randomly sele( ted from a
list of students compiled by Patria Scruggs, a promotional rep
resentative from the City whose task it has been to try to interest
younger people in harness racing. This is the pusher principle
applied to racing: get them betting while they're young and
c arefree and they'll soon be addicted to spending their free time
.it the S5 Win, Place and Show windows.
The six of us, Ted Gardenswartz, Sally Scandalios, Mark
•\ntweil, Nancy White, Tom Gart and myself were told about our
selection and days later whisked off in a rented station wagon to
Bay Meadows to learn how to harness race. So far, so good.
We were to leave from the front of the Quad at 7:30 a.m. for our
first practice. Not ones toscheduleß a.m. classes but good sports
nonetheless, we met Patria under threatening skies.

We arrived at the track by 8 a.m. to meet the trainers who, in
just two short morning practices, would teach us to survive the
big race. Winning wasn't in our minds then, only survival.
According to the old hands, the track was its muddiest in 12
years. As we approached the backstretch break in the fence
where we would begin our muddy tour, a few humans behind
their horses came oft the oval. Vou couldn't tell if they were male
or female, blac k or white, old or young. They were all encased in
the muddiest mud I've every seen. They couldn't see, breathe or
hear.
A fresh horse with a friendly looking driver came along, and as
he entered the sea of soil, Tom Cart took our dare and jumped
alongside the weathered man to learn the fine points of harness
racing.
Before he completed his first lap, I blindlyacquiesced to be the
sec ond guinea pig. After being told which direc tion to tace, I held
on tor dear life as we breezed around with the driving rain and
splattering mud in our faces.
I looked at the people we passed and those who passed us (I
noticed there were significantly more of the latter) to try to learn
what sort of person gets out of the sack before sunrise to do this.
It was impossible to tell exactly in such a short time, but I can tell
you this: they were the friendliest people you'd ever want to
meet. Iheir love for horses was obvious, and they couldn't help
but take under their >irm anyone who showed the least bit of
interest in their livelihood.
After two laps alongside a driver more trusting than I would
have been in the situation, we approached the stopping point. I
was ready to stop. But evidently the horse needed a couple ot
additional miles of exercise. So rather than share the indescriba
bly uncomfortable with me, he had me slow the horse down.
And then he jumped otf and told me to "take heraround a couple
'a more miles." Belore I could protest that maybe, just maybe, I
wasn't ready tor the task, he vyas standing kppe-deep in the mud
behind me and it w$$ off to thfc races.
I must say at'this point that I have never'had too great an affinity
for horses. The last time before this one that I had any contact
whatsoever with equestrial being was when I was six years old
and the neighbor's Shetland Pony bucked me off, much to my
dismay and dissatisfaction. But back to the 1980s.
After the ordeal was over and I had stepped gingerly into the
mud, we slopped over to the stables where a hose lay ready to
dense our faceless bodies.
We stood there near the track as horses emerged from and
entered into the stable area where 750 harness-racers are kept
during the winter. We were still half caked in mud and half
soaked in near-freezing water. We were cold. We were still shak
ing a bit from our experiences. And we all agreed that we had
never had so much fun. Nothing could stop us from returning the
next morning to repeat the madness.
Everything was much the same the next day, except that the
track had dried out a great deal and the sun was shining. The mud
wasn't gone, but at least you could see where you were going.
After our solo laps, it became clear we probably would survive the
race.
We were also learning something about horses. Well, most of
us were, anyway. Nancy White explained to us in seeming seri

ousness that when she was riding behind the horse, she didn't
know what sex it was, so she took a guess and said horse-riding
things like "Ciddyap girl" and "Whoa girl." After a few chuckles
from everyone around, a few of us explained to Nancy how to tell
the male from female horses.
Atter our second practice, our race predictions were set.
Nancy, despite her unfamiliarity with the animals, and I after two
davs of solo experience, were the favorites.
Ted and Tom tried to downplay their credible performances to
lull the rest of us into a sense of false security and Mark, with only
one day's experience under his belt, was an unknown quantity.
And then there was Sally. Sally got along well with the horses
she practiced with. They evidently appreciated the lact that she
didn't work them too hard. A nice, steady walking pace was fine
tor them it it was fine with the person behind them. Horses aren't
smart enough to realize that their driver may be more interested
in survival than speed. Clearly, Sally was a strong believer in
survival. She would surprise us.
Ted was a sleeper. He sneaked in more laps by the end than any
ot the rest of us, without any of us even noticing. Talk about a low
profile. I think now that he really wanted to win.
Soon it was Saturday night. We arrived early to have dinner at
the Turf Club. Yes, it really is called the Turf Club. No, there isn't
any turf there. But the food is good and the price was certainly
right (free).
Our stomachs were churning, and our dates tried to calm us, to
no avail. It was simply a nerve-racking situation. The bright lights
shone on the track. The large crowd milled about near the betting
windows. The bugle call that reminds you of theKentucky Derby
sounded before each race. My whole body was shaking. And to
increase the pressure, we were allowed only one drink before the
race. One drink doesn't help in a situation like this. Several might
help. Many would help.
Finally it was time. We were led down to the jockey's dressing
room via the private elevator from the executive section. We
climbed into the racing silks of the regular drivers and made our
way to the paddock to meet our horses.
It was then I learned the life story of Sidney Brown, a New
Zealand product who was a pretty good stretch runner in his

prime. He had won about $60,000 in prize money during his life.
But his life was now near its end. I winced at the thought of
pouring Sidney out of a bottle of Elmer's Clue next year. Maybe
he was about to catch his second wind, I thought. Maybe his
experience, which about doubled that of any other horse in the
race, would pay off in this pressure-packed situation.
My strategy was clear. Sidney knew more about this game than
I. It would be his race from start to finish. If he wanted to take an
early lead, fine with me. If he wanted to wait in the wings until the
stretch to overtake the tiring newcomers, tine.
We followed the white Cadillac carrying the starting gate
around the track on our way to the starting line. As the pace
increased, the tension of the spectacle was getting to me. I was
scared. Maybe I had made a mistake. Maybe Sidney and I could
just pull up and I could tell everyone later that I had saved his life
by not pushing him to the point of destruction. But then it was too
late. The race had begun and I was already looking at the backs of
the other five entrants.
As planned, Sidney ran his own race. But it wasn't what I'd
hoped for. Sidney's best days were long behind him. My
thoughts were not directed at avoiding the unjustifiable: finish
ing last. Entering the fourth turn, however, that's just where we
we. Dead last. But true to form, Sidney, the stretch runner, made
up ground like Secretariat and in response to my war hoops,
passed Nancy and Mark, who had faded fast after an early lead.
On the stretch, the magnitude of my loss was apparent. Ted
was light years ahead of everyone. Tom and Sally, whose fear of
extreme speeds had evidently subsided during the excitement,
finished two and three, respectively. I humbly crossed the wire in
fourth, followed closely by Mark and Nancy.
The losers gamely congratulated Ted and Tom, who will repre
sent Stanford on Feb. 2 against the top two finishers from Cal and
San Francisco State, who will have survived a similar ordeal by
then.
I think I'll go to Bay Meadows that night to watch the race. If
Sidney Brown is still alive I hope a Cal Weenie draws him so I can
watch him or her try to prod that arthritic old nag to a last place
finish. My sympathies won't be with the driver, however: I'll be
thinking of poor old Sidney Brown. I really hope he doesn't end
up as dog meat. He did his best. If only wecouldhave run the race
10 years ago. Then we could have taken 'em.

It was immediately clear from their devilish grins that I had no
chance in this race. Sidney Brown, the trainer told me, was a nag.
