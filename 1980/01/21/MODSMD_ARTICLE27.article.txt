# Center for Disease Control:
## 'Life span won't increase unless we change habits' 
### 
Atlanta (AP) — The human
life span has increased dramat
ically in the 20th century be
cause of the spectacular suc
cess of disease control, but the
next 20 years likely will bring
little improvement, says an as
sistant director for the national
Center for Disease Control
(CDC).
The reason is that today's top
killers are not infectious dis
eases but accidents, violence
and chronic illnesses.
Future changes in human life
span are going to have to come
about through changes of poor
human habits — drinking,
smoking, stress and just plain
hard living, said Dr. Donald

Millar of the CDC.
"Preventing deaths due to
these problems will require the
simultaneous reduction of
several health risks over long
periods of time, clearly de
manding a much greater com
mitment of both the individual
and the community," said Mil
lar in a recent interview.
The improvement in life
span since the turn of the cen
tury has been stunning.
Studies show that a child born
in the United States in 1900
could expect to live 47 years.
Today, the average is 73 years.
Dramatic
"This dramatic increase of 25
years was achieved by reducing

the risk of dying during infancy
and childhood through en
vironmental sanitation, im
munization and improved nut
rition," Millar said.
In that same period, life ex
pectancy for adults increased
only slightly. In 1900, a 45-
year-old white male could ex
pect to live to age 69. In 1976, a
45-year old white male could
expect to live to 73, only 4.5
additional years.
"The highly touted lengthen
ing of life span for Americans is
largely due to prevention, not
cure," Millar said.
A.-> an example, as late as 1960
epidemic poliomyelitis swept
the United States every sum

mer. By 1970, as a result of mass
immunization campaigns, the
incidence of poliomyelitis was
so reduced that the total
number of cases could literally
be counted on the fingers of
two hands.
Pleasure
Millar said the real pleasure
in disease prevention is watch
ing "nothing happen."
And right now, there are no
epidemics of polio, no
epidemics of smallpox, no
epidemics of cholera, no epic
demics of leprosy and no
epidemics of malaria. Measles,
which once affected almost
everyone, is now close to ex
tinction.

But other killers are on the
loose.
One study lists these leading
causes of death in the United
States in 1976: heart disease,
cancer, stroke, influenza and
pneumonia, accidents, car ac
cidents, diabetes, cirrhosis of
the liver, arteriosclerosis and
suicide.
"Currently, average con
sumption of alcohol for all per
sons older than 14 is 30 percent
higher than 15 years ago —
about 2.6 gallons of ethanol
annually, representing a total
of 28 gallons of beer, plus 2.5
gallons of distilled spirits and
2.25 gallons of wine," the re
port said.

"Ten million adult Ameri
cans — seven percent of those
18 years or older — are esti
mated to be alcoholics or prob
lem drinkers."
Cirrhosis of the liver, caused
by excessive drinking, killed
31,407 persons in 1976, or 14.8,
of every 100,000 persons.
Alcohol abuse and al
coholism are estimated by the
Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Men
tal Health Administration to
have cost the nation nearly
$343 billion in 1975, including
health and medical costs, lost
production, auto accidents,
violent crimes, fire losses and
social programs.
Through a system of measur

ing the number of life years lost
because of premature deaths,
here are the total years lost to
some of the chronic diseases
and social factors in 1976:
Heart disease 4.3 million
years, motor vehicle accidents
1.7 million years, all other acci
dents 1.4 million years, stroke
833,944 years, suicide 814,157
years, homicide 755,625 years,
cirrhosis of liver 578,473 years
and diabetes 263,042 years.
Through improvement in
these areas, all of which are
traced to the choices that man
made in today's society, the
studies show that man can
most certainly improve his life
span.

31,407 persons in 1976, or 14.8,
of every 100,000 persons.
Alcohol abuse and al
coholism are estimated by the
Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Men
tal Health Administration to
have cost the nation nearly
$343 billion in 1975, including
health and medical costs, lost
production, auto accidents,
violent crimes, fire losses and
social programs.
Through a system of measur

ing the number of life years lost
because of premature deaths,
here are the total years lost to
some of the chronic diseases
and social factors in 1976:
Heart disease 4.3 million
years, motor vehicle accidents
1.7 million years, all other acci
dents 1.4 million years, stroke
833,944 years, suicide 814,157
years, homicide 755,625 years,
cirrhosis of liver 578,473 years
and diabetes 263,042 years.
Through improvement in
these areas, all of which are
traced to the choices that man
made in today's society, the
studies show that man can
most certainly improve his life
span.
Atlanta (AP) — The human
life span has increased dramat
ically in the 20th century be
cause of the spectacular suc
cess of disease control, but the
next 20 years likely will bring
little improvement, says an as
sistant director for the national
Center for Disease Control
(CDC).
The reason is that today's top
killers are not infectious dis
eases but accidents, violence
and chronic illnesses.
Future changes in human life
span are going to have to come
about through changes of poor
human habits — drinking,
smoking, stress and just plain
hard living, said Dr. Donald

Millar of the CDC.
"Preventing deaths due to
these problems will require the
simultaneous reduction of
several health risks over long
periods of time, clearly de
manding a much greater com
mitment of both the individual
and the community," said Mil
lar in a recent interview.
The improvement in life
span since the turn of the cen
tury has been stunning.
Studies show that a child born
in the United States in 1900
could expect to live 47 years.
Today, the average is 73 years.
Dramatic
"This dramatic increase of 25
years was achieved by reducing

the risk of dying during infancy
and childhood through en
vironmental sanitation, im
munization and improved nut
rition," Millar said.
In that same period, life ex
pectancy for adults increased
only slightly. In 1900, a 45-
year-old white male could ex
pect to live to age 69. In 1976, a
45-year old white male could
expect to live to 73, only 4.5
additional years.
"The highly touted lengthen
ing of life span for Americans is
largely due to prevention, not
cure," Millar said.
A.-> an example, as late as 1960
epidemic poliomyelitis swept
the United States every sum

mer. By 1970, as a result of mass
immunization campaigns, the
incidence of poliomyelitis was
so reduced that the total
number of cases could literally
be counted on the fingers of
two hands.
Pleasure
Millar said the real pleasure
in disease prevention is watch
ing "nothing happen."
And right now, there are no
epidemics of polio, no
epidemics of smallpox, no
epidemics of cholera, no epic
demics of leprosy and no
epidemics of malaria. Measles,
which once affected almost
everyone, is now close to ex
tinction.

But other killers are on the
loose.
One study lists these leading
causes of death in the United
States in 1976: heart disease,
cancer, stroke, influenza and
pneumonia, accidents, car ac
cidents, diabetes, cirrhosis of
the liver, arteriosclerosis and
suicide.
"Currently, average con
sumption of alcohol for all per
sons older than 14 is 30 percent
higher than 15 years ago —
about 2.6 gallons of ethanol
annually, representing a total
of 28 gallons of beer, plus 2.5
gallons of distilled spirits and
2.25 gallons of wine," the re
port said.

"Ten million adult Ameri
cans — seven percent of those
18 years or older — are esti
mated to be alcoholics or prob
lem drinkers."
Cirrhosis of the liver, caused
by excessive drinking, killed
31,407 persons in 1976, or 14.8,
of every 100,000 persons.
