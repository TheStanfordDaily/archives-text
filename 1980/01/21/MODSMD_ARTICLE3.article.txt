From the Daily wire services
Following tradition, Chief Justice
Warren Burger will pay tribute to the
late justice William O. Douglas as the
first order of business when the Sup
reme Court meets tomorrow.
Douglas, 81, died at 10:09 a.m. EST
Saturday at Walter Reed Army Medi
cal Center. He had been suffering
from progressive lung and kidney fai
lure. His wife and members of his
familyand staff were with him, hospi
tal officials said. No cause of death
was given.
President Jimmy Carter ordered
flags at federal institutions to fly at
half-staff in honor of Douglas, who
had sat on the nation's highest court
,a record 36 years.
"Individual freedom in this coun
try had no mightier champion,"said
the president about Douglas.
Fur -*ral services will be held Wed
nesday. Douglas will be buried in Ar
lington National Cemetery not far
from the grave of Supreme Court Jus
tice Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Tribute tradition
It is traditional that the nation's
chief justice pays tribute when the
court meets the first time after a jus
tice's death, and this time the duty
falls to Burger, an ideological rival of
Douglas, considered as much a con
servative as Douglas was a liberal.
Douglas retired from the bench in
1975 after a paralyzing stroke. He en
tered Walter Reed on Christmas Eve.
In death, he was praised by some
past critics as well as by admirers.
Former President Gerald Ford,
who in 1970 as House Republican
leader launched an unsuccessful ef
fort to have Douglas impeached,
said, "The nation has lost an out
standing jurist who had a tremend

ous impact on our society and our
government."
Justice William Brennan Jr., a close
friend of Douglas on the court, called
him, "The only true genius I have
ever known."
1500 opinions
Douglas wrote more than 1500
opinions, establishing a record, and
worked side by side with one-third of
all the menwhoever sat on thecourt.
He weathered an impoverished
childhood, a bout with polio, a hor
seback accident that broke 23 ribs
and cost him half a lung, two im
peachment attempts and a firestorm
of criticism about his four marriages,
two to women young enough to be
his daughters.
On the bench, Douglas was the
foremost exponent of individual
liberties and the "112 irstness of the First
Amendment," reading it as an abso
lute ban on government censorship
of speech, no matter how inflam
matory, libelous or obscene.
"The great thing about our Con
stitution," Douglas said frequently,
"is that it was designed to make it
difficult to do things to people."
Any one of Douglas' achievements
would have satisfied an ordinary
man. He was a professorat Columbia
University Law School and a celeb
rated expert on business and ban
kruptcy law before his 30th birthday;
a firebreathing chairman of the Sec
urities and Exchange Commission; a
member of the New Deal's inner cir
cle, and dean-elect of the Yale Law
School when his poker-playing
buddy, Frankiin Roosevelt, ap
pointed him to the Supreme Court.
At 40, Douglas was the youngest man
to sit on the Supreme Court since
1812.

Yet law professors jeered Douglas
for his haste, for writing "from the
gut" instead of reasoning out a deci
sion step by step. Lawyers some
times found his opinions so sloppy
and so poorly documented that they
were almost useless. To them, Doug
las' response was, "I'd rather create a
precedent than find one," by which
he meant that he preferred to adjust
the Constitution to modern needs
than to blindly follow the past.
His relations with the rest of the
court were sometimes so rocky that
they publicly and unceremoniously
repudiated his views. The most fam
ous incident occurred in 1953, when

Douglas halted the execution of con
victed atomic spies Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg. The justices rushed back
into session and overruled him.
Twenty years later, when Douglas
stopped the Air Force's bombing of
Cambodia, nearly the same thing
happened. The rest of the court con
ferred by phone and let the bombers
resume their flights.
At the end of 1974, Douglas suf
fered a serious stroke. For months,
he tried to regain enough strength to
resume full-time work at the court.
But on Nov. 12,1975, Douglas reluc-
