# Computers teach in logic and Armenian
## 
### Kathy Sheil 
Students here are fairly familiar with clas
ses taught about computers or how to use
computers. But classes taught by computers?
It's not just a dream from a science fiction
story anymore. Computers have been teach
ing classes here since the 19605.
According to Lee Blaine, a director for
programs and curricula, the classes have
been very successful. Classes in logic, set
theory and Armenian are currently being ot
tered by computer.
In the logic class, the first computer-taught
offering, enrollment has ranged from 75 to
125 students per quarter, and some have
been turned away, he said. The set
theory class, begun in 1975, has had no prob
lems in reaching its full enrollment of eight to
15 students a quarter. The Armenian class has
about five per quarter.
No previous knowledge
The classes do not require any previous
knowledge of computers. Ed Bolton, teach
ing assistant (TA) for the logic class, said the
course is self-contained and "not sophisti
cated." The programs are written in "non
computerized" English, so the students don't
have to worry about learning a computer lan
guage as well as the class material.
"It's a very good class for getting ac
quainted with the computers," Bolton said.
Students take the class for a variety of
reasons, he said. Not only do many
philosophy students take it for their major,
but it also fulfills the breadth requirement for
some types of engineering, and it can be
used as part of the natural-science distribu
tion requirement.
One student said he was taking the class to
"help with LSATs" (law school admission
tests). Others enrolled because the class
"sounded fun," because "my friend took it
and said it was a good class" or just because
"it looked better than any of my other op
tions."
"I would very definitely recommend the
class to anyone," said Byron Springer, a stu
dent in the logic class. He said that the com
puters were "self-explanatory" and the TAs
add a "personal touch." Nick Cault added
that, although he was a little intimidated by
the computers at first, it didn't last long.
"The computers give you hints and tell you

what you re doing wrong, ' he said, so its not
hard to get going in the class.
Audio components
All terminals have audio components, so
students can listen to the computer's prog
rammed voice, read the questions and type
the answers on the display terminal.
By making the programs more like an
instructor-blackboard class, the courses are
more than just simple drill. Students move on
to new material when they successfully com
plete the old, and grading is based on how
much work a student does. Since the class is
taught entirely on an individual basis, each
student can work at his own pace.
"About 100 hours of work will get you an
'A,' " said Gault, adding that he didn't think it
took any more time than a standard five-unit
lecture class.
)ohn Sobotik, also a student in the class,
agreed, but added that it was different than
other classes in that it didn't work as well to
use an hour here and an hour there, but was
best working in four to five hour stretches.
"It's a little frustrating," he said, "but en
joyable."
Two voices
The Armenian class works much the same
way, with the computer having two voices,
one in English and one in Armenian. The
computer can test student knowledge ot new
material as it is typed on the terminal and can
then respond. TAs are required to meet with
students to check their pronunciation.
The language program, funded in part by a
grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, is economical, said Research As
sociate Lawrence Markosian. It will become
even more so as the cost of computers con
tinues to go down.
At present, only one computer is set up to
teach the course.
The programs in logic and set theory have
been run under a succession of grants from
the National Science Foundation and are not
funded by Stanford. However, the current
research will be completed in June and what
will happen when the grant expires is "not
exactly certain," Blaine said. The program
may have to be cut back or dropped.
But according to Bolton, the program is
"more expensive by a long shot" than the
traditional lecture class.
