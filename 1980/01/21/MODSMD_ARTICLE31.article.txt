Johannesburg — Every
time the price of gold goes
up by $10, South Africa's
embattled white minority
government rakes in
another $1242 million a year.
Sitting happily atop this
bonanza, South African Fi
nance Minister Owe Hor
wood has appealed to his
country's politicians and
business men not to be
come carried away by their
windfall good fortune as the
worlds top gold producer
and to 'observe strict linan
cial disc ipline.
"Excessive wage in
creases," he warned last
week, cpuld lead to intla
tion and disaster.
While rejoicing that the
world had once more con
cluded that South Atrica's
gold, much maligned by
paper-money advocates,
was after all the best bet lor
stability in a troubled world,
Norwood said the present
skyrocketing price of the
metal is the "symptom of a
deep sickness" that would
have to be urgently cured by
world monetary reform.
Barometer
The Johannesburg Star
newspaper called the price
of gold, now about $750 an
ounce — triple what it was a

year ago — "the universal
barometer of international
tensions as crisis follows
crisis."
Meanwhile, South Afri
ca's income from gold
would reach a dizzying $15
billion in 1980, even if the
price drops, experts have
calculated.
What will happen to all
the new revenue?
Much of South Atrica's
gold earnings are tradition
ally ploughed back into the
mines. The big mining
groups, such as Harry Op
penheimer's Anglo-
American Corp., have
switched to mining lower
grade ore, leaving the richer
seams as security for luture
hard times.
Expensive treatment
methods to extract gold
trom the huge yellow sand
mountains which have been
part ol the lohannesburg
landscape for a century, are
now feasible. The city may
never look the same again.
Kipping up streets
There is even talk of rip
ping upcertain streets in the
suburbs that were paved
with mine tailings when the
price of gold was as low as
$35 an ounce a few years
ago.
