# Political views here follow national trends
## 
### Carlos Vidal Greth 
With presidential primaries
coming up, speculation on the
quantity and nature of voter
turnout is all around. A Daily
survey of 15 students aged 18 to
24, conducted on campus last
week, showed that student
opinion on the issues, reflects
several national electoral
trends.

According to William
Schneider, a visiting fellow at
the Hoover Institution, the
1980 election will have the
largest number of indepen
dent voters in American his
tory; in fact, more than show
party preference.
Following this trend i
majority of the students polled
said they were registered in

dependent, or would vote ac
cording to candidates, not par
ties.
"I voted Democrat in 1976
and '78," said Laird Easton, a
graduate student in history,
"but I just got involved in the
Citizen's Party, an alternative
party headed by Barry Com
moner. The thing that would
really get me out to the polls
would be if I thought the Re
publican candidate had a
chance of winning."
Jeff Silva is a registered Re
publican. "I don't like any of
the candidates, except maybe
Ford," the creative writing
major said. "I think the Demo
crats will have the strong can
didate this time, so I'll proba
bly vote Democrat."
Schneider also predicted
that "by election day, the two
parties may well present to the
country the most pronounced
ideological confrontation in
the past 50 years." He pre
dicted that the choice will be
between a liberal, probably
Sen. Edward Kennedy, and a
conservative, Ronald Reagan.
Frontrunner
However, a number of stu
dents said they were not con
cerned with the fron'.'-unner
status of these candidates.
Shoaib Khan, a graduate bus
niness student and registered
Republican, said he is taking a
careful look at his party's can
didates.
"The Republican party has
more diversity than the Demo
crats," he said. "First I thought
Connally was good, but after I
saw the debate in lowa, in the
primary I would vote for An
derson."
Many of the students inter
viewed expressed greater con
cern on candidates' foreign
policy than on domestic issues.
Atghanistan and Iran were the
most common issues listed as
major factors in choosing one
candidate over another.
"I the Republicans
would do a similar job in the
Middle East," said Paul De
lashaw, a sophomore. "The
handling of the situation will
influence me at the polls. The
president is doing all he can in
Iran without pushing us into
war, but I'm not saying he's the
only one that could handle it."
Divided
The country is divided along
a northern and southern axis,
according to Schneider, with

the South representing cul
tural and social conservatism.
He said that the West also has
greater support for the Repub
licans and students from the
West and South did tend to ex
press in the survey a relatively
conservative bias. â€¢
"I just don't want )immy Car
ter elected again," said Jeff
Tomlins, a native of Tulsa,
Okla. A petroleum engineer
ing student, Tomlins was blunt
in his support of |ohn Con
nally: "I like big business and
so does he. He's conservative,
and he's a Texan."
In Public Opinion magazine
last summer a survey showed
that 58 percent of the students
polled rated themselves politi
cally middle-of-the-road in
1978. Similarly, the students
questioned by the Daily all said
their political views were not
markedly different from those
of their parents, whom they
tended to characterize as
moderate. The students were
almost all Republicans, or in
dependent with conservative
leanings.
An ABC News Harris Poll
showed that Kennedy had
dropped from a 63 to 15 per
cent Democratic majority in
November to a 44-43 percent
last month. Students generally
paralleled the feeling of many

Democratic voters that Ken
nedy has not lived up to their
expectations since he declared
his candidacy.
Iran
Kenny Shropshire, a law stu
dent here, was bothered by
Kennedy's criticism of the ad
ministration during the Iranian
situation. "Some of his com
ments seemed to further his
own ends rather than to be in
the best interests ol the coun
try," he said.
A UC-Berkeley study con
ducted in 1977 showed that
being part of a college com
munity provides relatively free
access to information about
politics. The study also said
that it is generally easier for
students to register and vote.
All of the students surveyed
said they were registered or
plan to register to vote. Most
were aware of relevant issues
and the candidates' positions.
The U.S. Census Bureau
shows that in 1976, 68 percent
of the voters who had com
pleted one to three years of
college went to the polls. Al
most 80 percent of the voters
who had completed four years ;
or more turned out. If the stu
dents surveyed here are any
indication, 1980 may witness an
even higher rate of college
educated voter turnout.
