# Bradshaw's arm leads to 31-19 win over LA
## Super Bowl XIV is Pitt win IV 
### 
The Washington Post
Pasadena — It took a near
record passing day from Terry
Bradshaw. It took two sensa
tional catches by )ohn
Stallworth and one by Lynn
Swann. It took a last-quarter in
terception by Jack Lambert. It
took everything the mighty
Pittsburgh Steelers could mus
ter yesterday to finally subdue
the stubborn Los Angeles
Rams, 31-19, and win an unpre
cedented fourth Super Bowl ti
tle.
This was supposed to be a
dull, one-sided game, but the
11-point underdog Rams made
it one of the best and most ex
citing Super Bowls with a gutty
performance, especially from
inexperienced quarterback
Vince Ferragamo, who almost
outshone the glorious Brad
shaw.
But Bradshaw was not about
to let the Steelers' bid for foot
ball immortality get away. He
shrugged off three intercep

tions, a stiff Ram pass rush and
rallied his team to two fourth
period touchdowns before a
thrilled throng of 103,985 in the
Rose Bowl.
The Steelers now can lay
claim to being a football
dynasty, pointing to four NFL
titles in six years as ample proof
of their ability.
Bradshaw's two touchdown
passes and his 309 throwing
yards — second best in Super
Bowl history — were made
possible only by the talents of
Stallworth and Swann, whose
knack for producing big plays
exposed perhaps the only
weakness in the Ram defense.
Stallworth, who felt he was
ignored unjustly by Bradshaw
in the first half, scored what
became the winning
touchdown by sensationally
pulling in a 73-yard bomb early
in the last quarter to erase
19-17 Ram lead.
Then he somehow leaned
back and gathered in a 45-

yarder among three Ram de
fenders with three minutes left
to set up Franco Harris' one
yard icing-on-the-cake score—
Swann, who suffered a slight
concussion late in the third
period, got Pittsburgh's of
fense untracked right after half
time with one of his patented
leaping grabs between two
Rams. He stumbled at the two
before twirling into the end
zone for a 47-yard score.
"This is probably the best
one we've ever had," Coach
Chuck Noll said, showing a
rare hint of emotion in the
Steelers' joyous locker room.
Noll was far less happy in the
final minutes when the Rams,
trailing 24-19, and knowing
their chances of winning were
running out, drove to the
Pittsburgh 32. That is when Fer
ragamo made his only mistake
of the game, a wayward pas*
that middle linebacker Lam
bert picked off before the
Steelers struck for their final

touchdown.
That errant throw, however,
did not deter from Ferragamo's
effort. In only his seventh pro
start, he shredded Pittsburgh's
proud defense for 212 yards,
three times moving the Rams
into leads.
Both clubs served notice
early that this was going to be a
high-scoring affair, much like
Pittsburgh's scintillating
triumph last season over Dallas
in Super Bowl 13.

Bahr on the Steelers' first pos
session was offset immediately
by a one-yard touchdown run
from the Rams' Cullen Bryant

Pittsburgh answered with
four Bradshaw completions

scoring sweep. When Bahr
booted the conversion the

second period.
By now, everyone realized
the Rams were not kidding. To
emphasize that point, they
took advantage of Bradshaw's
lirst interception to set up a
45-yard Corral held goal and a
15-10 advantage with 14 sec
onds to go in the halt.
"We jusi knew we weren t
playing with the usual Steeler
intensity," Lambert said. "We
had lo change that."
Pittsburgh did, quickly. On

pass toward Swann, who had

ball, Swann started his jump.
He went higher and higher, fi
nally pulling in the ball while at
least three feet above the
ground. He came down, kept
his balance, danced in for the
47-yard score.
Surely this stunning blow,
one that had become a Steeler
trademark the last two sea
sons, would finally brush off
the pesky Rams.
It did not. Ferragamo took a
page from Bradshaw's go-for
broke book. He found Billy
Waddy 46 yards down the field
and Waddy turned the pass
into an eye catching reception
by pulling the ball away trom
Pittsburgh's Ron Johnson at
the Steeler 24.
Before their toes could re
cover, the Rams struck again.
Lawrence McCutcheon began

a sweeparound right end, then
pulled up and passed to Ron
Smith, who got behind j.T.
Thomas. Smith pulled in the
accurate toss and moved into
the end zone for the score.
After Corral missed the con

ter. Those L.A. fans who had
booed their team so vigorously
during the regular season, who
had thought the club had no
chance of making it this far,
now were beside themselves
with joy.
But Los Angeles couldn't
capitalize on two more inter
ceptions of Bradshaw. The
Rams had the Steelers on edge,
but they could not apply the
final blow.
On third down from his 27,

Bradshaw dropped back and
looked tor Stallworth, who was
running a hook-and-go pat
tern. He was being covered by
Rod Perry, a talented corner
back who had been sidelined
much of the season with a bad
calf.
Perry lunged for the ball at
the Ram 35 but missed with a
swipe of his arm. Stallworth
gathered in the pass without
missinga strideand scampered
untouched for a touchdown
while Perry lay on the turf.
Pittsburgh could sense vic
tory. Bradshaw sure again, cal
led a hook-and-go pattern to
Stallworth, "but I was they
wouldn't be in the same de
fense. When I came up to the
line, doggone if they weren't."
Stallworth cut between Perry

and Dave Elmendorf while
Bradshaw let go the pass. As it
came to Stallworth, Cromwell
came over to help. All three
Rams were thwarted as
Stallworth reached back and
cradled the ball against his
chest for a 45-yard gain to the
L.A. 22.
It was Stallworth's third re
ception, for 121 yards. And it
became Bradshaw's final com
pletion, giving him a 14-for-21
production. His 309 passing
yards were second only to his
318 of Super Bowl 13.
Two plays later, Thomas was
called for interfering with )im
Smith in the end zone. On the
third try from the one, Harris
bolted over, Bahr kicked the
conversion and the Steelers
had another title.
