# Bradshaw's arm leads to 31-19 win over LA
## Super Bowl XIV is Pitt win IV

The Washington Post
Pasadena — It took a near
record passing day from Terry
Bradshaw. It took two sensa
tional catches by )ohn
Stallworth and one by Lynn
Swann. It took a last-quarter in
terception by Jack Lambert. It
took everything the mighty
Pittsburgh Steelers could mus
ter yesterday to finally subdue
the stubborn Los Angeles
Rams, 31-19, and win an unpre
cedented fourth Super Bowl ti
tle.
This was supposed to be a
dull, one-sided game, but the
11-point underdog Rams made
it one of the best and most ex
citing Super Bowls with a gutty
performance, especially from
inexperienced quarterback
Vince Ferragamo, who almost
outshone the glorious Brad
shaw.
But Bradshaw was not about
to let the Steelers' bid for foot
ball immortality get away. He
shrugged off three intercep

tions, a stiff Ram pass rush and
rallied his team to two fourth
period touchdowns before a
thrilled throng of 103,985 in the
Rose Bowl.
The Steelers now can lay
claim to being a football
dynasty, pointing to four NFL
titles in six years as ample proof
of their ability.
Bradshaw's two touchdown
passes and his 309 throwing
yards — second best in Super
Bowl history — were made
possible only by the talents of
Stallworth and Swann, whose
knack for producing big plays
exposed perhaps the only
weakness in the Ram defense.
Stallworth, who felt he was
ignored unjustly by Bradshaw
in the first half, scored what
became the winning
touchdown by sensationally
pulling in a 73-yard bomb early
in the last quarter to erase
19-17 Ram lead.
Then he somehow leaned
back and gathered in a 45-

yarder among three Ram de
fenders with three minutes left
to set up Franco Harris' one
yard icing-on-the-cake score—
Swann, who suffered a slight
concussion late in the third
period, got Pittsburgh's of
fense untracked right after half
time with one of his patented
leaping grabs between two
Rams. He stumbled at the two
before twirling into the end
zone for a 47-yard score.
"This is probably the best
one we've ever had," Coach
Chuck Noll said, showing a
rare hint of emotion in the
Steelers' joyous locker room.
Noll was far less happy in the
final minutes when the Rams,
trailing 24-19, and knowing
their chances of winning were
running out, drove to the
Pittsburgh 32. That is when Fer
ragamo made his only mistake
of the game, a wayward pas*
that middle linebacker Lam
bert picked off before the
Steelers struck for their final

touchdown.
That errant throw, however,
did not deter from Ferragamo's
effort. In only his seventh pro
start, he shredded Pittsburgh's
proud defense for 212 yards,
three times moving the Rams
into leads.
Both clubs served notice
early that this was going to be a
high-scoring affair, much like
Pittsburgh's scintillating
triumph last season over Dallas
in Super Bowl 13.
A 41-yard field goal by Matt
Bahr on the Steelers' first pos
session was offset immediately
by a one-yard touchdown run
from the Rams' Cullen Bryant
after Wendell Tyler had
sprinted 39 yards around left
end.
Pittsburgh answered with
four Bradshaw completions
that set up a Harris one-yard
scoring sweep. When Bahr
booted the conversion the
Steelers had a 10-7 lead in the

The Steel C urtain rang down hard on Wendell Tyler yesterday, but not before the Los Angeles halfback
rushed for 60 yards on 17 carries. Jack Lambert bulldogs Tyler above as L.C. Greenwood, Gary Dunn and
Joe Greene zero in to assist during Pittsburgh's 31-19 Super Bowl XIV victory.
