# First-half lapse costly for Cards vs. Cal
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
The only person missing
from NBC's Pacific-10 basket
ball coverage of Stanford's
77-69 loss to California Satur
day afternoon was Dan Ayk
royd.
Though Ross Porter and
Lynn Shackleford did a credi
ble job behind the mic
rophones at Maples Pavilion,
they needed the expertise ol
Aykroyd as Leonard Pinth Gar
nell, the host of the network's
"Saturday Night Live's Bad
Cinema;" for what TV Guide
listed as NCAA Basketball was
really Bad Pac-10 Basketball.
No, mdke that Really Bad
Pac-10 Basketball.
In all fairness, the really bad
basketball lasted for only sev
eral minutes of the first halt
and was played mostly by the
Cardinals. With five minutes
gone in the game Stanford led
11-10. Six minutes, several bad
passes, five turnovers and in
numerable groans later, Cal
led 22-13.
Any other Pac-10 squad
would have taken the Cards'
gift and never looked back, but
the inexperienced Bears did all
they could to keep their oppo
nents in the game.

Stanford awoke from its
catatonic state and played their
usual game after their first-halt
lapse, but they could never
quite catch up, lowering their
record to 3-12, 1-6 in the con
ference.
"We combined lor some
turnovers and bad shot selec
tion and got down by nine
midway in the first half, and
that's what opened the game
up. Before that it was a see-saw
game," Stanford head coach
Dick Dißiaso said.
While it is not true that Cal's
unitorms were designed by
PamperAtis true that they are
young, %4fcr inability to put
the game i Saturday was a
sign of this fl»urt immaturity, as
a nonethelejßr ecstatic head
coach Dick Kuchen was the
lirst to admit.
'"We've got young players
who will continue to get better.
They'll also continue to make
mistakes," Kuchen said.
Leading the Bears to their
tirst Pac-10 win against six los
ses (5-10 overall) were 5-loot-9
guard Mike Chavez, who
sported the quickest jump shot
thi§ side of Pistol Pete Maravich
(remember him!*) in scoring 21
points, center Michael Pitts,

whose main contribution was
clogging up the middle as the
"1" in Cal's 2-1-2 zone defense,
and most ol all, senior forward
Doug I rue.
The key to stopping Stanford
has been onefold stop Kim
berly Belton. The Bears did just
that Saturday, with Pitts and
True limiting Belton to Ii
points.
I rue was the key art luted ol
the delensive job against Bel
ton, playing the staniord star
so close that he lollowed him
home alter the game mot re
ally). The b-H forward is the
leader and the Papa ol the Baby
Bears and no one is more
aware oi thai than Kuchen.
"True was in there lighting to
win. 11 he isn't Pac-10 Player ol
the Week alter his ellorl
against (Santa Clara's Kurti
Rambis and Belton then I .
he trailed oil, belore continu
ing. "He deserves the recogni
tion."
Admitting he was particu
larly up lor Stanlord, True was
excited as he basked in the
soothing feeling of victory. He
was particularly happy with his
play against Belton. "I've
played against Kim seven times
and a couple of them have

been nice times. He is not a
threat from the outside, so I
just try to stay between him
and the goal and make him stay
out."
The Bears kept Belton and
the rest ot the Cards out all
game, playing well the zone
detense that has given Stan
lord iits game alter game.
"The /one has given us dilli
c ulty all year," moaned Dißiaso
alter the game. "Earlier we we
ren't able to shoot over it.
Today we did .1 good job from
the outside, but we'd get in
side and take bad shots."
It the Cards did one thing
righl Saturday, it was burn the
nets irom the outside. Brian
Welch, Doug Barnes and Doug
Marty were IH-of-37 for the
game., and most ot their shots
would have been th ree
pomters at ()akland Coliseum.
However, Belton and Or
lando Ward were 5-of-20 from
closer 111, Ward going scoreless
in seven attempts from the
field.
Belton pooh-poohed the
idea of Cal's detense being re
sponsible for his performance,
pointing at the stats sheet and
saying, "It wasn't that (Cal). If I
had hit my shots, I would have

done alright
"Since the season began
they've sagged on Kim Belton
and cheated towards Brian
Wek h. The rest of the team has
to pick up the slack — that's
what makes a team good," Di-
Biaso said.
Dißiaso picked up the game
statistics. "Look at (Cal guard
Walt) Gillespie — he had 10
points and seven rebounds.
That adds to it."

Stanford guard Doug Marty (22) was one of the few bright spots in an
otherwise dreary day, scoring a career-high 13 points and playing
with "intensity and determination," according to Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso.
The Cards got only two
points off the bench, those a
Jeff Ryan tip-in in the first half.
The remainder of the scoring
came from the starting five.
Stanford's lack of depth has
been the telling blow this year
and that can only be remedied
through recruiting. '

Dißiaso has been recruiting a
great deal already this year, re
turning Thursday from a four
day trip East. When asked how
it went, Dißiaso's countenance
picked up and he said, "really
well . . . maybe I should have
stayed back there."
Down, down — he was only
kidding.
