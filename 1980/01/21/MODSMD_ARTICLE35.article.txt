The Los Angeles Times
Pasadena — As Tex Beneke would say, pardon me boy, is th.it
the Monongahela Choo Choo?
Choo, choo and shoe, shoe baby, too, you bet, and threw n
Tangerine, String of Pearls and a Little Brown |ug, as well i\
Pittsburgh Steelers, who jetted through the 70s, here also -til!
swinging through the Swinging Years when List sighted on Super
Sunday at the Rose Bowl.
As usual, they put up some mighty numbers on the super
scoreboard. Steelers 31, Rams 19, 1000 kegs of beer, 70,000 hot
dogs, a 103,985-person card stunt section, HO million television
iewers, maybe 1 (X) million, 2000 media clawing lor box lunches,
$2.50 programs and parking down the block lor trom $5 to $20.
Significantly, the gigantic "Terrible Towel" unfurled and car
ried onto the tield in pre-game warmups, 10 yards in length, was
six leet longer than the world's largest American I lag that fol
lowed a lew minutes later.
As Art Rooney, grand old Grand Old ol the Steelers, said it
when all was done, "this might be the best football team in
history right now." Maybe tomorrow and the day after, too.
But that's hardly the point. Not to mention too subtle, 100 soil,
and too much an underplay lor this sort ol day and show.
On the battlefield, there didn't seem to be as much dilterence
between the teams as in the score. What was it? "Just three
tantastic passes and three fantastic catches," Don Klosterman,
Kams general manager, said.
And one more lantastic to make it lour. Fantastic will to win,
which is as much a trademark ol the Steelers as that grotesque
and ridiculous parade ot towels.
The last time los Angeles had a team in the Super Bowl at the
Rose Bowl, it turned out a little happier lor the homers as the
Raiders crushed the Minnesota Vikings three lanuarys ago in
Supei XI.
But nobody's perlect, you can't win them .ill and all those other
things the losers always sing. The Rams had nothing to weep
about nor hang their helmets over in Chapter 14.1 or a long time,
they enjoyed Super Sunday like kids making their lirsl trip to the
candy store discovering all-day suckers. The party was good tor at
least three quarters and until Bombs Two and Three.
But what's the difference? The game was line, but the spec tac le
beat the contest, six touchdowns to one, and that's all that really
counts.
Vice presidents Klosterman and Jack Teele ol the Rams shared a
spot on the top floor ol the press box tor the feeding. Christians
to Lions, Rams to Steelers, that didn't make much dilterence,
either.
"This is what you call a happening on the American scene,"
Klosterman said. And he said LHAT even BEIORF kickoll, even
BEFORE the halttime and even BFf ORE the Rams roc ked here,
rocked there and roc ked around the clock to lead by a terrific two
points, stupendous 19 to marvelous 17, at the end ol three magni
ficent quarters.
What Commissioner Pete Ro/elle has molded into the world's
greatest case ol mass hysteria, outdoor or in, is truly the achieve
ment ol our time — a portrait to hang in heaven, it there's enough
room.
When one Super Show has been completed, they always say,
They'll never top that one." But Pete always does.
Hey, Roll Out The Barrel, too.
In short, the television sponsors who paid $4f>W,OOO tor a one
minute commercial and $234,000 lor JO seconds, got their luna
cy's worth. So did the live customers who paid $50 lor tickets. And
$60. And $200. And $450, the reported topper lor a single ducat.
Teele said it Nolan Cromwell, an all-pro most ol the day in the
secondary for the Rams, had held onto the interception he ap
peared ready to take all the way for a score, the Rams would have
won. He might be right.
But they sang it lor the Steelers. "I'll be Seeing You."

Klosterman sow delensive end Fred Dryer getting held just
before he was about to tackle Terry Bradshaw — just BEFORE
Ui trMi iw got ol his 7 i-yard bomb to John Stallworth that put the
' inrk and gold back on top, 24-19, three minutes into the last 15.
i mebody said "Good Lord" and somebody else shouted
jesus Christ" but it was neither doing the holding and nothing
illegal was cited. No tickee, no washee, and that's the way the
inches go.
II won't be remembered, anyway, as long as the sideshow. Fans
ol the Rams had enough tun before the game, if that's any conso
lation. Sure it is, Green Eyes, it you were In The Mood.
As is customary, even the theme title tor the event must be
super-colossal-stupendous, and this one was no exception.
Would you believe "A Spectacular Salute To The Music and
Energy Ol The Fabulous Swing Era?" All things considered —
I riday night's $150,(K)O party at Pasadena Center with 3000 guests
and maybe H)00 more entertaining, Tex Beneke, Helen O'Con
nell and Bob Eberly among them bringing back the '40s, to Sun
day s halftime mob ot 100 Up With People singers and dancers,
plus the los Angeles All-City Band, filling the field — it was.
Would you believe sportscaster |im Hill, the Super Bowl's MC,
leading a dress rehearsal featuring the 103,985 spectators practic
ing stunts with their cards between the first and second quarters?
Would you believe Rozelle looking into his TV monitor at
halttime at the aerial view ol the field, the bowl and beyond,
gigantic Roman Candles throwing fireballs into the clear Califor
nia sky, and summing it up with one sigh. "Incredible," the
commissioner said.
Wendell lyler was helped off the field four times, hurt and
hurling, Lawrence McCutcheon hurled a touchdown pass in the
super trick play of super day and the Rams, perhaps even Sports
Illustrated with its staff of 25 will suggest, made a gallant enough
stand to satisly the most picky critics.
But what will be remembered longer, ot course, will be the
romance of the Brandy Alexander popsicles at the Super Hop, the
boneless chicken thighs stuffed with sausage and the linguini
mannara.

The Los Angeles Times
Pasadena — As Tex Beneke would say, pardon me boy, is th.it
the Monongahela Choo Choo?
Choo, choo and shoe, shoe baby, too, you bet, and threw n
Tangerine, String of Pearls and a Little Brown |ug, as well i\
Pittsburgh Steelers, who jetted through the 70s, here also -til!
swinging through the Swinging Years when List sighted on Super
Sunday at the Rose Bowl.
As usual, they put up some mighty numbers on the super
scoreboard. Steelers 31, Rams 19, 1000 kegs of beer, 70,000 hot
dogs, a 103,985-person card stunt section, HO million television
iewers, maybe 1 (X) million, 2000 media clawing lor box lunches,
$2.50 programs and parking down the block lor trom $5 to $20.
Significantly, the gigantic "Terrible Towel" unfurled and car
ried onto the tield in pre-game warmups, 10 yards in length, was
six leet longer than the world's largest American I lag that fol
lowed a lew minutes later.
As Art Rooney, grand old Grand Old ol the Steelers, said it
when all was done, "this might be the best football team in
history right now." Maybe tomorrow and the day after, too.
But that's hardly the point. Not to mention too subtle, 100 soil,
and too much an underplay lor this sort ol day and show.
On the battlefield, there didn't seem to be as much dilterence
between the teams as in the score. What was it? "Just three
tantastic passes and three fantastic catches," Don Klosterman,
Kams general manager, said.
And one more lantastic to make it lour. Fantastic will to win,
which is as much a trademark ol the Steelers as that grotesque
and ridiculous parade ot towels.
The last time los Angeles had a team in the Super Bowl at the
Rose Bowl, it turned out a little happier lor the homers as the
Raiders crushed the Minnesota Vikings three lanuarys ago in
Supei XI.
But nobody's perlect, you can't win them .ill and all those other
things the losers always sing. The Rams had nothing to weep
about nor hang their helmets over in Chapter 14.1 or a long time,
they enjoyed Super Sunday like kids making their lirsl trip to the
candy store discovering all-day suckers. The party was good tor at
least three quarters and until Bombs Two and Three.
But what's the difference? The game was line, but the spec tac le
beat the contest, six touchdowns to one, and that's all that really
counts.
Vice presidents Klosterman and Jack Teele ol the Rams shared a
spot on the top floor ol the press box tor the feeding. Christians
to Lions, Rams to Steelers, that didn't make much dilterence,
either.
"This is what you call a happening on the American scene,"
Klosterman said. And he said LHAT even BEIORF kickoll, even
BEFORE the halttime and even BFf ORE the Rams roc ked here,
rocked there and roc ked around the clock to lead by a terrific two
points, stupendous 19 to marvelous 17, at the end ol three magni
ficent quarters.
What Commissioner Pete Ro/elle has molded into the world's
greatest case ol mass hysteria, outdoor or in, is truly the achieve
ment ol our time — a portrait to hang in heaven, it there's enough
room.
When one Super Show has been completed, they always say,
They'll never top that one." But Pete always does.
Hey, Roll Out The Barrel, too.
In short, the television sponsors who paid $4f>W,OOO tor a one
minute commercial and $234,000 lor JO seconds, got their luna
cy's worth. So did the live customers who paid $50 lor tickets. And
$60. And $200. And $450, the reported topper lor a single ducat.
Teele said it Nolan Cromwell, an all-pro most ol the day in the
secondary for the Rams, had held onto the interception he ap
peared ready to take all the way for a score, the Rams would have
won. He might be right.
But they sang it lor the Steelers. "I'll be Seeing You."

Klosterman sow delensive end Fred Dryer getting held just
before he was about to tackle Terry Bradshaw — just BEFORE
Ui trMi iw got ol his 7 i-yard bomb to John Stallworth that put the
' inrk and gold back on top, 24-19, three minutes into the last 15.
i mebody said "Good Lord" and somebody else shouted
jesus Christ" but it was neither doing the holding and nothing
illegal was cited. No tickee, no washee, and that's the way the
inches go.
II won't be remembered, anyway, as long as the sideshow. Fans
ol the Rams had enough tun before the game, if that's any conso
lation. Sure it is, Green Eyes, it you were In The Mood.
As is customary, even the theme title tor the event must be
super-colossal-stupendous, and this one was no exception.
Would you believe "A Spectacular Salute To The Music and
Energy Ol The Fabulous Swing Era?" All things considered —
I riday night's $150,(K)O party at Pasadena Center with 3000 guests
and maybe H)00 more entertaining, Tex Beneke, Helen O'Con
nell and Bob Eberly among them bringing back the '40s, to Sun
day s halftime mob ot 100 Up With People singers and dancers,
plus the los Angeles All-City Band, filling the field — it was.
Would you believe sportscaster |im Hill, the Super Bowl's MC,
leading a dress rehearsal featuring the 103,985 spectators practic
ing stunts with their cards between the first and second quarters?
Would you believe Rozelle looking into his TV monitor at
halttime at the aerial view ol the field, the bowl and beyond,
gigantic Roman Candles throwing fireballs into the clear Califor
nia sky, and summing it up with one sigh. "Incredible," the
commissioner said.
