# Swimmers fare well

In an unofficial swimming
and diving contest at deGuerre
Pool Saturday, Stanford com
peted gamely but was,
nonetheless, nipped by Mis
sion Viejo, the perennial age
group stronghorses of South
ern California.
"Our goal was to swim hard
and race," said men's head
coach Skip Kenney. "And I
think we did a great job."
"It was good considering
that we swam five to six miles
this morning and worked out
with weights," elaborated as
sistant coach Stu Corliss.
Even in the heart of season
training, Kevin Porter and
Kevin O'Beirne recorded
lifetime best times. Porter's
mark came with a 16:33 effort
in the 1650-yard freestyle. "It
was his best by a good ways
and a good indication of his po
tential," said Corliss of that
achievement.
O'Beirne rolled to a 55.2 per
sonal record in the lead-off 100
backstroke leg of the 400 med
ley relay.
The visiting Natadores, also
reeling from an Olympics
aiming practice schedule and
missing the myriad talents of
ailing world-record holder
(esse Vassallo, still managed to
tackle the Cardinal men, 68-45.
The fight was not, however,
one-sided. Performing before
the swimming events, diver
Bryan McCleve revealed the
persistant spirit of the Cardi
nals. Against a rockribbed
squad of four national champ
ions, McCleve leapt to the

third spot in both the 1-meter
and 3-meter springboard
events.
"Bryan really rose to the oc
casion," said Kennedy. "He
was better today than he's ever
been. Today was probably one
of the greatest diving meets
this school's ever seen."
Although most swimming
times were slightly slower than
those notched at last week's
Arizona State University meet
ing, freshman sensation John
Simons just missed the NCAA
qualifying time while finishing
second in the 400 individual
medley. Kenney estimated Si
mons' 4:02.90 as one of the top
five 400 IM times in the nation
this year.
Simons' conqueror, Brazi
lian Dgan Madruga, now of
Mission Viejo, set a 400 IMpool
record of 4:01.72. Madruga
also barely held off Card dis
tance man Bari Weick to cap
ture the 500 freestyle in
4:33.69.
The rapidly-improving
Weick continued to swim well,
with his 4:34.16 in the 500 and
an evenly-paced 15:45.65 in the
1650 free.
The 1650 provided the occa
sion for another pool record,
when Mission Viejo's Rafael
Escoles stroked away from the
pack in 15:23.65.
The Card men were almost
entirely shut out of the sprint
freestyle races J)y the Nata
dores' Jean Marc Francoise,
Dave Reed and Dave Barnes.
Reed won a judges' decision in
the 50 free over senior Bob
Hagberg (21.85) and a clear-cut

first with a 47.42 in the 100 free
The only Card scorer behind
Francoise's victorious 1:43.69
finish in the 200 free was, sur
prisingly, breaststroke and in
dividual medley specialist Ken
Shilling, who utilized a quick
start to churn to a 1:44.97 third
place. Shilling later ran away in
the 200 breast in 2:10.27.
Also participating in other
than-usual events, Wade Fle
mons still maintained his
backstroke dominance with a
1:54.1 unchallenged win in the
200.
The women experienced a
brief sensation of deja vu, as
the final outcome of their dual
meet narrowed down to their
last event, the 800 tree relay.
Vet, the recurrence of last
week's sneak past ASU was not
to be, for the Natadores swept
swittly by the Cards to wrap up
the meet, 71-60.
Janet Buchan, back from last
week's illness, showed an
amazing versatility by winning
the 400 IM in 4:22.5, her best
time this season, by placing a
close second in the
500 free (4:57.03), by re
submerging almost im
mediately for a 1:00.39 third in
the 100 back and by closing the
day with another third, 2:24.2
in the 200 breast.
Patti Spees and Dana Morton
controlled the breatstroke
competition, fighting it out
among themselves exclusively.
Morton the 100-yard distance
in 1:07.13 to Spees'
1:07.67,whi1e Spees stole top
honors in the 200 (2:22.62) over
Morton's 2:22.81.
