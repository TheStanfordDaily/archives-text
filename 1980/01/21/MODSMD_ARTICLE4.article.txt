Washington — It now appears likely that the United
States Olympic Committee will support President )immy
Carter's position that Americans should not participate
in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow unless Soviet
troops are out of Afghanistan within four weeks.
In a firm, 750-word letter to USOC President Robert
Kane, Carter declared that "deeper issues are at stake"
than the spirit and survival of the Olympics. The presi
dent also called for an American boycott of the Moscow
games if the International Olympic Committee refused
to move or postpone the quadrennial event.
Carter's decision on the Olympics makes U.S. partici
pation in the 1980 Olympic Cames highly unlikely since
both an early Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and
IOC acquiescence in the American demand are consi
dered remote possibilities.
But White House officials said they expect the USOC
to go along with the presidential request, and a number
of other countries to support the U.S. call for moving the
games to another site or to run their own "alternative
games."
"The U.S. government, if necessary and if it decided
to do so, could prevent American athletes from par
ticipating" in the games, White House counsel Lloyd
Cutler told reporters.
On the Olympic Cames, Carter said he would oppose
American participation at Moscow even if no other na
tion supports the United States.
He said he favors establishment of a permanent site
for the summer Olympics in Greece and another perma
nent, unspecified site for the winter games.
The USOC will meet next weekend in Colorado
Springs, Colo., to consider Carter's request, while
White House officials expect U.S. Olympic officials and
athletes to go along with the request, the power to move
or postpone the Olympics rests with the international
committee, which will meet Feb. 10 in Lake Placid.
The IOC, which owns the Olympics and contracts with
local organizing committees to promote and stage them,
reaffirmed its stand that the games will be held as
scheduled in Moscow, July 19 through Aug. 3.
IOC President Lord Killanin achnowledged that a U.S.
withdrawal "would be disastrous," but told United Press
International from his home in Dublin: "It is legally and
technically impossible to move the games from Mos
cow. It is not the business of the IOC to get involved in

politics."
The USOC has agreed to present the case for moving
or postponing the games to lOC, but officials privately
feel that it is a futile effort to sway an intransigent organiza
tion.
Kane said he was "very pleased" with Carter's state
ment yesterday because it was firm, but still gave the
USOC some time to maneuver — at least until the Feb.
20 deadline the president set for the Soviets to withdraw,
and possibly longer, since Olympic entries do not have
to be filed until early )uly.
"I'd like for us to stay flexible in this because we hope
very much that the games will go on and we can take part
in them. Now we've got at least a month of flexibility,
which we wouldn't have had if he had enacted a
boycott," Kane said.
"Now we have a chance to talk to other nations, to see
whether possibly world tensions will be relaxed, to hope
for a miracle; that the Soviets will move out of Afghanis
tan."
Kane was careful to draw a distinction between the
president's request that U.S. athletes not participate in
the Olympics if Soviet troops remain in Afghanistan and
what he called "a boycott."
"A boycott would have taken us out of the Olympic
movement all together, leaving us without a voice in the
deliberations and the decision-making," said Kane, who
had feared that the administration would order Ameri
cans to shun the Moscow games without going through
the USOC and following lOC procedur?s.
Kane and USOC Executive Director F. Don Miller is
sued a statement after a White House meeting with
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and other administration
officials on Friday saying that the executive board would
make a decision on entering American athletes in the
games "based on the collective view of the athletes."
At least one influential member of the executive board
said he saw no alternative but to support Carter's re
quest, regardless of the athletes' views, and suggested
that this would be the majority opinion of his colleagues
as well.
"My reaction is, 'That's it.' If the Soviets aren't out of
there in 30 days, we probably won't go. . . .We certainly
have to obey the command of our government and our
president, I feel," said Douglas Roby of Ypsilanti, Mich.,
a past president of the USOC and one of two current
American representatives on the lOC.
