# Men take tumble while women win

### Dean Eyre 
Competition on the road
held different fates for Stan
ford's gymnastics teams over
the weekend, as the women's
squad found a home away from
home in Southern California
while the men got the cold
shoulder from their Berkeley
hosts.
The Cardinal women raised
their overall record to 4-0 by
defeating Cal Poly-Pomona
Friday night 127.65 to 114.20
and then outpacing Long
Beach State and Nevada-
Reno Saturday afternoon.
Karen Hall, the team's top
all-around competitor, was
able to compete only in vault
ing and uneven parallel bars
before having to sit out the re
maining two events with an in
jured knee. Trina Wiggins en
tered only the bars event to
test her sprained ankle.
Along with tougher judging,
according to coach Jackie
Walker, the net result was a
lower-than-expected team to
tal. Individually though, the

Cards dominated competition
in both meets, particularly
against the 49ers.
Against Pomona, Anne
Smith took all-around honors
with a 32.65 total on perfor
mances that included a third
on bars (7.85), seconds in ba
lance beam (7.85) and floor
exercise (8.35) and first in vault
ing (8.60).
Julie Bledsoe placed second
in all-around with a 32.60
score, a third in vaulting (8.20)
and a pair of top finishes in
floor exercise (8.40) and bars
(8.55).
Earning third place overall
for the Cards was Jennifer
Roberts, with a total of 30.85
points and first on beam with
8.15.
Pomona's top competitor
was Diane Gardner, who was
third on beam with a 7.80 and
third in floor with 8.00.
Matters got a lot easier
Saturday as far as team compet
ition, since a combination of
illnesses and a quitting team
member reduced Long Beach

to only three gymnasts per
event instead of four and al
most eliminated Reno al
together — a solitary entrant
competed for the Nevada
squad.
Stanford rolled (actually
tumbled) to an easy victory,
compilingl27.os points, with
Long Beach a distant second at
67.30 and Reno with 28.40.
Smith repeated her perfor
mance as winner of the all
aroundcompetition with a
32.75 tally. She also placed
third in floor (7.90), second in
vaulting (8.70) and won the
bars and beam events (8.20 and
8.25).
Bledsoe earned third in all
around, totaling 31.50 points
and placed second in floorwith
a 785 mark. Kim Crowley took
third in vaulting (8.35) and tied
with teammate Roberts for
second on beam at 8.15.
Wiggins finished second on
bars at 7.95 and Jeanette
Lacoste was third with a 7.50
judging. Hall stayed out of the

Long Beach-Reno meet com
pletely.
"I'm pretty pleased overall,"
Walker said after the Long
Beach meet. "They're bruised
and aching, but really moti
vated to improve.
"It's really nice to have
judges from a different area of
this region — we get a lot of
compliments from them. And,
the team got to try out different
equipment and to be away
trom home. Now they really
appreciate Stanford's
facilities," Walker aded.
Across the Bay, the Golden
Bears weren't such congenial
hosts. Cal dominated the meet
and outscored Stanford by a
265.00 to 248.00 margin.
In all-around, Cal swept the
top three spots — first went to
Bill Paul (54.00), followed by
Michael Ares (52.45) and War
wick Forbes (51.35). Tad Bos
tick was the Cards' brightest
spot, taking tourth with a 51.30
score.
Rod Horn of Cal took fifth
with 51.10 and Stanford's Mike

Lee earned sixth with a 50.20
total.
Among the top Card perfor
mances were a third-place tie
in floor between Bob Maganini
and Bostick at 9.00, Bostick's
second-place tie on parallel
bars (8.H5) and fourth-place
finish on hiuh bar at 8.5h
