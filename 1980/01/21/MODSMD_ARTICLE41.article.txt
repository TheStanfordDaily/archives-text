# Women best Biola; face UOP tonight
## 
### 
Playing just well enough to
win, Stanford's women's bas
ketball team outlasted Bioia
72-62 Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinals opened mat
ters with a 20-7 romp over the
Eagles, making another
Pennsylvania-type result (Stan
ford 101, Penn 57) appear im
minent.
But by halftime, Biola had
evened the score at 37-37.
After what must have been a
fiery locker-room speech by
head coach Dotty McCrea,
Stanford started the second
half by outscoring Biola 13-4.
From there, the Cards cruised
to their 10th victory in 19 deci-

sions.
Biola, which finished an im
pressive 24-6 last year in Divi
sion 111 action, fell to 3-5.
Card sophomore leanne
Ruark continued her season
long mastery, collecting 31
points — garnished by a 14-
for-20 shooting performance
— and 10 rebounds.
The 31-point total was
Ruark's second best of the
campaign, behind only her
42-point outburst against East
Carolina last month. It was
Ruark's third 30-point outing
thus far.
Freshman forward Meg
Metzger added 10 points lor
the Cardinals, who face Uni
versity of the Pacific tonight in
Maples at 7.
