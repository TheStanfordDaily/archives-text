Negotiations for hostages stalled
New Delhi, India — A senior United Nations offi
cial said yesterday that "major gaps" still exist in
negotiations to release American hostages in
Tehran.
The remarks came as a clarification of a state
ment made earlier in the day by U.N. Secretary-
General Kurt Waldheim that a package for the re
lease of the hostages "had been worked out."
Waldheim's press secretary, Rudolf Stajouhar,
said the secretary-general's words referred only to
the basic framework developed during his visit to
Tehran earlier this month.
That framework meets an Iranian demand tor an
international commission ot inquiry to be estab
lished to investigate excesses committed during
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's rule in return for
the hostages' release.
"The Iranians still want the inquiry of the com
mission conducted, and the report of the inquiry
submitted and adopted by the Security Council all
before discussing the release of the hostages," he
said.
The United States has refused any settlement
that would put preconditions on the release of the
hostages.
Carter supports using military
Washington — The United States is committed to
using military force against the Soviet Union if
necessary to protect the security of Pakistan, Pres
ident Jimmy Carter declared yesterday, calling the
Soviet invasion ot Afghanistan a "radical depar
ture" from previous Kremlin policy.
Noting that since World War II Soviet troops had
never previously been sent into a non-aligned
country outside the Soviet bloc, Carter said that
Moscow must be shown "by actions of our coun
try and other nations that they cannot invade
another country with impunity — they must suffer
the consequences."
The president, describing the Soviet invasion as
"a kind of arrow aiming at" vital oil producing and
transporting regions of the Middle East, said that
the United States is continuing to build up its naval
torces in the northern Indian Ocean and the Per
sian Gulf region. And it is "exploring with some
intensity" the establishment ot lacilities lor serv
ing U.S. air and naval forces in those regions, he
said.
The possibility that Soviet troops might move
from Afghanistan into either Pakistan or Iran, both
of which stand between the tiny landlocked coun
try and the Indian Ocean, has worried leaders of
both of those countries and has caused serious
concern among national security analysts in the
Carter administration. The major fear among de
fense analysts is that the United States, to protect
its interests, would have to counter such a Soviet
military move and this would lead to nuclear war.
Revolutionaries plan alliance
Moslem revolutionaries rejected conciliation
with the Marxist Afghan government yesterday
and announced plans to unite rebel actions into a
single guerrilla front to tight a holy war against
Soviet troops in Afghanistan, according to an Ira
nian state radio report.
An Afghan Islamic Organization official in
Tehran said the revolutionaries never would ac
cept offers of negotiation from the Soviet-backed

Afghan government in Kabul or end their attempt
to rid Afghanistan of Soviet troops, Tehran Radio
reported. Most of the Afghan rebel groups have
headquarters in either Iran or Pakistan.
"The Afghan revolutionaries' duty is to expel the
Soviet forces from Afghanistan through Jihad (holy
war), not through negotiations," the official was
quoted as saying.
Discussions are underway among seven Islamic
organizations to form a guerrilla alliance to fight
the Soviet troops, which helped bring the gov
ernment of President Babrak Karmal to power on
Dec. 27 and are now battling guerrilla units in the
Afghan countryside.
Kennedy wins straw vote
San Francisco — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
narrowly won the state Democratic Party's first
presidential straw vote here yesterday on the eve
of today's lowa caucuses, edging past President
Jimmy Carter by 39 votes.
Kennedy polled 622 (42.2 percent) out of 1471
votes cast, to Carter's 583 (39.6 percent). Gov. Jerry
Brown picked up only 207 votes (14.1 percent)
among party activists in his home state.
Political operatives for the three candidates,
who spent the weekend wooing delegates to the
California Democratic state Central committee's
platform convention immediately debated the
significance of the vote and sought to cast the best
possible interpretation on the results.
But there was no doubt that Brown, who has
been running a poor third in the race for the 1980
presidential nomination, was the big loser.
State Democratic Chairman Richard O'Neill told
reporters he did not think that Brown could be
considered a credible candidate.
Grocery workers schedule strike
Oakland — Grocery workers overwhelmingly re
jected a contract offer yesterday and scheduled a
strike against about 200 targeted stores through
out eight Bay Area counties.
Union spokesman David Selvin said the strike
was called against Safeway, Cala Foods Inc. and
Fry's Food Stores Inc., beginning at the close of
business yesterday.
"These are the immediate strike targets," Selvin
said. "That doesn't mean any of the other
employers could not be subjected to a strike la
ter."
Selvin said the vote among members of the Un
ited Food and Commercial Workers was 7531-231
against an offer by the Food Employers Council,
which represents several major food chains in the
area.
The rejected otter called for a three-year pact
increasing the current $8.79 hourly wage for ex
perienced food clerks by $1.73 an hour. The total
wage and tringe benefit package would have
amounted to $3.97 an hour.
The 17,000-member union wanted a $I.Bl'/i per
hour wage increase, with tringe benefits totaling
$4.58.
Palestinian issue clouds peace
Jerusalem — With the withdrawal of Israeli
lorces from nearly two-thirds of the Sinai penin
sula and the beginning ot normal relations bet
ween Egypt and Israel five days away, the two gov
ernments yesterday moved farther apart on the
issue of Palestinian self-government than they

have been since the signing of their peace treaty
last March.
That gloomy assessment emerged as Israel's
cabinet yesterday icily "took note" of Egypt's re
jection of Israel's detailed scheme for limited
Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. The ministers, led by Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, condemned an Egyptian coun
terproposal for a Palestinian legislative assembly
as a "complete distortion" of the Camp David ac
cords.
Aid to China, Pakistan top agenda
Washington — The %th Congress convenes its
second session this week with plans to quickly
approve expanded trade with China and aid for
Pakistan in response to the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan.
President )immy Carter is expected to devote
much of his State of the Union address to Con
gress on Wednesday to the Soviet action in Af
ghanistan. And Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and
Secretary of Defense Harold Brown will report to
Congress on events both in Afghanistan and in
Iran.
They will seek $200 million in U.S. aid to bolster
Pakistan and discourage any Soviet military ad
vance into that country, which borders Afghanis
tan. Congressional leaders expect to win quick
approval for the aid program.
The $200 million is part of $400 million in aid the
Carter , dministration has offered Pakistan over
the next two years, half in economic aid and half in
credit loans for purchasing U.S. weapons.
The bill to expand U.S. trade with China by
granting China "most favored nation" trade status
is likely to be approved by the House this week
and possibly by the Senate as well.
Doctors amputate Tito's leg
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — President Josef Tito's
doctors amputated his left leg yesterday after con
vincing the 87-year-old Yugoslavian leader that the
surgery was absolutely necessary to save his life.
An opimistic-sounding medical bulletin last
night said that Marshall Tito had "taken the opera
tion well" and that "his condition was normal in
the immediate post-operative period."
Medical sources here interpreted the official
bulletin as suggesting that Marshall Tito was out of
immediate danger. But they cautioned that possi
ble complications could develop in view of his
advanced age and the fact that he had undergone a
long and unsuccessful surgery one week earlier.
Bleachers collapse, kill 147
Bogota, Colombia — Five sections of crowded
wooden bleaches atop the grandstand at the bullr
ing in Sincelejo collapsed yesterday and hospital

about 500 were injured.
Officials said about 3000 persons were in the
grandstand sections that fell.
