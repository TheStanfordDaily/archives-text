# Support of militants may bring reproof
## Criticism of hostages predicted 
### Gary Fremerman 
The vast outpouring of public sup
port for the American hostages in
Iran continues. But if and when they
are set free, will public opinion turn
against those hostages who expres
sed sympathy for their captors' de
mands?
The likely answer is yes, according
to Donald Lunde, clinical professor
of psychiatry and lecturer at the Law
School, who studied similar cases.
"The traditional American attitude
toward our own citizens who have
been hostages has been one of al
most excessive concern during their
imprisonment," Lunde said.
"But once the hostages have been

released, Americans have done an
about-face and have upbraided these
same people for not standing up to
pressure."
Lunde predicted that hostages'
statements of support for the Iranian
students' demands could cause a
public backlash when they return to
the United States. The students' de
mands include the return of deposed
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for
trial.
Great expectations
"Americans have very unrealistic
expectations of people in situations
like this, and they don't have a very
good idea of what the people go
through," he said.
"Secondly, Americans have im
ages of people like (movie star) )ohn
Wayne, who stand up to the enemy
and remain patriotic — images that
are not based on real-life experi
ence."
Lunde also blamed the
popularized military code of conduct
established after the Korean War —
under which prisoners are expected
to divulge only name, rank and serial
number — as being an unrealistic
standard, especially for a largely civi
lian group.
Soon after the Nov. 4 embassy
takeover, 33 hostages signed a peti
tion demanding the return of the
shah to Iran to stand trial. Since then
many have expressed sympathy for
the militants' cause.
Sympathetic at first?
And if and when the hostages re
turn home, Lunde predicted that
"they are apt at first to make state

merits that are sympathetic to the
people who have been holding them
captive, and Americans are not apt to
handle that very well."
Lunde described certain
techniques the embassy militants
use that can "influence people's be
liefs when you have total control
over their environment."
These techniques, he said, include
overt threats, a cut-off of the hos
tages' communications with others,
sleep deprivation, sensory depriva
tion and "a strongly enforced de
pendency ... by keeping the hos
tages bound all the time and totally
dependent on their captors for the
most basic needs of life."
He eschewed the use of the term
"brainwashing," however.
Confinement over a prolonged
period of time under these condi
tions, he added, tends to lead to a
state of mind "where a person iden
tifies more, or becomes sympathetic
with, the person who is taking care of
him — even though it's the enemy or
person who captured him."
'Re-educated'
Lunde, who has been contacted by
the government concerning the hos
tages' probable psychological state,
said that many of the captives proba
bly see themselves as being "re
educated," rather than brainwashed.
But later on, he added, after
they're released and are home for
awhile, "most people revert to their
usual beliefs and are puzzled how
they made those statements at the
time."
Although their confinement has
gone on long enough "to affect a
majority of the hostages," the degree
of harm will vary with each indi
vidual, Lunde said.
Different effects
He predicted most hostages would
recover fully within weeksor months
of their release, while others would
continue to have nightmares about
the experience for some time.
Some might "develop
psychosomatic symptoms or disor
ders," but few would experience
serious or permanent reactions to
their ordeal, he said.
To minimize possible problems for
the hostages upon their return,
Lunde recommended that they be
sheltered from the "media circus"
until they have had sufficient time to
recover and to readjust to home life.
Lunde's experience studying simi
lar cases includes extensive work
with kidnapped heiress Patty Ffearst,
and with Capt. Lloyd Bucher of the
U.S.S. Pueblo, whose crew was held
captive by North Korea forll months
in 1968.

captive, and Americans are not apt to
handle that very well."
Lunde described certain
techniques the embassy militants
use that can "influence people's be
liefs when you have total control
over their environment."
These techniques, he said, include
overt threats, a cut-off of the hos
tages' communications with others,
sleep deprivation, sensory depriva
tion and "a strongly enforced de
pendency ... by keeping the hos
tages bound all the time and totally
dependent on their captors for the
most basic needs of life."
He eschewed the use of the term
"brainwashing," however.
Confinement over a prolonged
period of time under these condi
tions, he added, tends to lead to a
state of mind "where a person iden
tifies more, or becomes sympathetic
with, the person who is taking care of
him — even though it's the enemy or
person who captured him."
'Re-educated'
Lunde, who has been contacted by
the government concerning the hos
tages' probable psychological state,
said that many of the captives proba
bly see themselves as being "re
educated," rather than brainwashed.
But later on, he added, after
they're released and are home for
awhile, "most people revert to their
usual beliefs and are puzzled how
they made those statements at the
time."
Although their confinement has
gone on long enough "to affect a
majority of the hostages," the degree
of harm will vary with each indi
vidual, Lunde said.
Different effects
He predicted most hostages would
recover fully within weeksor months
of their release, while others would
continue to have nightmares about
the experience for some time.
Some might "develop
psychosomatic symptoms or disor
ders," but few would experience
serious or permanent reactions to
their ordeal, he said.
To minimize possible problems for
the hostages upon their return,
Lunde recommended that they be
sheltered from the "media circus"
until they have had sufficient time to
recover and to readjust to home life.
Lunde's experience studying simi
lar cases includes extensive work
with kidnapped heiress Patty Ffearst,
and with Capt. Lloyd Bucher of the
U.S.S. Pueblo, whose crew was held
captive by North Korea forll months
in 1968.
The vast outpouring of public sup
port for the American hostages in
Iran continues. But if and when they
are set free, will public opinion turn
against those hostages who expres
sed sympathy for their captors' de
mands?
The likely answer is yes, according
to Donald Lunde, clinical professor
of psychiatry and lecturer at the Law
School, who studied similar cases.
"The traditional American attitude
toward our own citizens who have
been hostages has been one of al
most excessive concern during their
imprisonment," Lunde said.
"But once the hostages have been

released, Americans have done an
about-face and have upbraided these
same people for not standing up to
pressure."
Lunde predicted that hostages'
statements of support for the Iranian
students' demands could cause a
public backlash when they return to
the United States. The students' de
mands include the return of deposed
Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for
trial.
Great expectations
"Americans have very unrealistic
expectations of people in situations
like this, and they don't have a very
good idea of what the people go
through," he said.
"Secondly, Americans have im
ages of people like (movie star) )ohn
Wayne, who stand up to the enemy
and remain patriotic — images that
are not based on real-life experi
ence."
Lunde also blamed the
popularized military code of conduct
established after the Korean War —
under which prisoners are expected
to divulge only name, rank and serial
number — as being an unrealistic
standard, especially for a largely civi
lian group.
Soon after the Nov. 4 embassy
takeover, 33 hostages signed a peti
tion demanding the return of the
shah to Iran to stand trial. Since then
many have expressed sympathy for
the militants' cause.
Sympathetic at first?
And if and when the hostages re
turn home, Lunde predicted that
"they are apt at first to make state

merits that are sympathetic to the
people who have been holding them
captive, and Americans are not apt to
handle that very well."
Lunde described certain
techniques the embassy militants
use that can "influence people's be
liefs when you have total control
over their environment."
These techniques, he said, include
overt threats, a cut-off of the hos
tages' communications with others,
