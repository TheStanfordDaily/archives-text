# Former Douglas clerk reminisces about Justice's distinguished career
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
The death of William O. Douglas,
like that of most public figures, has
brought epitaphs and accolades
from many sources, both friends and
foes, those who knew him well, and
those whom he had never met,
Warren Burger, one of his
bitterest enemies on the Supreme
Court itself has stated, "His impact
on the law in his time is matched only
by a small company of the other 100
justices who have served on the
court since 1790. We mourn the loss
of a friend and colleague."
Stanford Law Prof. William Cohen
offers a more personal, deeply
loyal view of the former justice than
many, having known and respected
Douglas for years.
Cohen served as Douglas' law

clerk for the 1956-57 court session
and was also a member of Douglas'
clerk review panel for three years.
Cohen considers Douglas (realiz
ing that many of his colleagues
would not agree) "one of the court's
three best justices since 1940," and
along with lustice Hugo Black, one of
the greatest defenders of civil liber
ties and the First Amendment in the
Court's history.
He was a "complex man," warm
and charming to his friends yet often
impatient and aloof with his staff and
sometimes insulting, according to
Cohen.
He described Douglas as a man al
ways ill at ease at parties or formal
gatherings. While never at home at a
cocktail party, he was the kind of
man with whom you "could sit

around a campfire and tell tall tales,"
said Cohen.
Rough-and-ready
This picture of Douglas as a
rough-and-ready outdoorsman
emerged throughout Cohen's reflec
tions on his former employer. He
was often a maverick. At the same
time, on certain issues, he was wil
ling to "horse trade," or bargain with
his brethren for support.
Douglas was the Court's great dis
senter, and in Cohen's opinion,
Douglas' "finest moment" was his
dissent in Dennis vs. United Sfafes.
The majority upheld the conviction
of the national officers of the Com
munist Party for Smith Act violations.
Douglas dissented, however, stat
ing that their actions had not
tantly resigned, telling an old adver
sary, President Ford, that his ener
gies had been depleted by "inces
sant and demanding pain."
Even in retirement, Douglas con
tinued to work at the court. Though
half-paralyzed and confined to a
wheelchair, he would appear regu
larly in his chambers to compose the
second volume of his autobiog
raphy, a sequel to the popular Co
East Young Man.
