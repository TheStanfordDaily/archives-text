## In wake of Iran. Afghan crises U.S. 'scrambling' for Persian Gulf role 
### 
Washington (AP) â€” The Un
ited States, stripped of the
comfortable notion that it
could depend on a local
"policeman" to guard its con
siderable interests in the Per
sian Gulf, is scrambling to
maintain American influence
in the oil-rich region.
Faced with the revolutionary
loss of Iran and the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan, the Carter
administration is attempting to
establish a new alignment of
pro-Western governments,
focusing on strengthened ties
with Egypt and Pakistan, an old
relationship with Saudi Arabia
and new bonds with China.
President Jimmy Carter is
redrafting U.S. military
strategy, with the emphasis on
establishing new bases in the
region, expanding existing
facilities and setting up a large,
mobile combat force that
could be rapidly deployed to
the area.
The diplomatic and military
realignments began after the
Iranian revolution eliminated
the government upon which
the United States relied for
military might in the Persian
Gulf.
While the Iranian lesson was
sinking in, the Soviet Union
sent thousands of troops in
to Afghanistan, taking advan
tage of the U.S. distraction
with Iran.
With the incursion, the Rus
sians proved a sobering point:
strategically, the United States
is largely incapable of counter

ing Soviet power in the Gulf
despitp a decade of lining up
friends and plying them with
billions of dollars worth of
American jets, missiles, tanks
and other arms.
/bigniew Brzezinski, the
U.S. national security adviser,
acknowledges "the fragility of
the region."
That is why, he told The As
sociated Press, Carter is rein
forcing "our political relation
ships and military presence,
thereby enhancing the security
of friendly states."
Said Brezezinski: "All con
cerned should know one cent
ral fact: this region is of vital
importance to the United
States and American power is
available to protect it."
Thus, the Soviet intervention
is seen in Washington as a
watershed event in the
geopolitics ol the Gulf and one
immutable tact dominates U.S.
loreign policy in the area: so
long as Americans maintain
their love affair with the au
tomobile, the United States
must try to shape events there.
The Soviet move in Afghanis
tan complicates the U.S. task,
transforming an already tense
region into the center ring for
East-West confrontation and
providing a potential tor open
conflict.
The Soviet power play, reviv
ing a historic southward push
toward the Iranian oil fields
and Arabian sea ports, raises
new U.S. concerns about

Western oil supplies. Through
the Strait of Hormuz, gateway
to the gulf, passes 60 percent of
the Western world's foreign oil
purchases. Guarding this vital
lifeline: tiny Oman's 17-ship
navy.
Forced to redefine its role,
the United States tinds itself
with a limited number ot de
pendable allies. Israel and
Egypt are the most prominent
and, according to experts,
have the best armies in the
Middle East.
But there is no Gulf "police
man" to guard U.S. interests,
as Iran was supposed to do
witfi $21 billion in American
weaponry. Saudi Arabia is
neither capable not interested
in assuming that mission.
Although defiantly anti-
American, the Iranian regime is
not pro-Soviet. Some ad
ministration officials hope the
intervention of neighboring
Afghanistan will shock the rul
ing Moslem clergy in Iran intoa
renewed, if modest, friendship
with the United States.
The pessimistic view of the
region is that the Soviet influ
ence is gaining, with the inter
vention of Afghanistan only the
latest in a series of provocative
moves.
Working along the
periphery, the Russians have
acquired strong political and
military positions in Ethiopia,
on the Horn of Africa, in Aden
and South Yemen, and now are
lighting to impose a puppet re

gime in Afghanistan.
The United States, mean
while, has lost influence over
the last several years in Iran,
Ethiopia, and to some extent,
Saudi Arabia and Jordan. It has
gained ground in Somalia.
Trying to block the Soviet
advance, Carter is planning to
ask Congress to allow resump
tion in arms aid to Pakistan de
spite a disturbing nuclear pol
icy.
Brzezinski, the presidential
adviser who coined the phrase
"arc of instability" in late 1978
to describe the region, com
pares the plight of the coun
tries along the Indian Ocean to
Western Europe in the 1950s
and Asia in the 1960s and 19705.
"Their internal fragility, so
cial and political, could interact
with the projection of Soviet
power, and that together could
create a problem as acute as
the one that we faced even in
the '50s and 'bOs, especially be
cause of oil," he said.
