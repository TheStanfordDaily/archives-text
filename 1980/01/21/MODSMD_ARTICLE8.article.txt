# Israeli military has Syrian war scare

The Los Angeles Times
lerusalem â€” Generals, diplomats and
high-ranking officials of several govern
ments found themselves caught up this
week in the first Arab-Israeli war scare of
the 1980s. The Syrians, it was said, were
eager to go to war.
The deputy commander of Israel's
Northern Command said so, as did Prime
Minister Menachem Begin.
"We have reports," Begin said, "that the
Syrians may start warlike actions against
us."
In Syria, what the Israelis were saying
was interpreted as an indication that Israel
might be preparing to attack Syria.
"Such statements," a Damascus news
paper said, "have always preceded every
Israeli aggression . . . ."
By Thursday, it was clear that the war
clouds were mostly over the headquarters
of Israel's Northern Command, where the
crisis originated.
How all this started and developed is
under study in the upper echelons of the
Israeli Defense Forces, where there are
some who worry that such an incident
could trigger a war.
'Bouncing ball'
"It was like a bouncing ball," one officer
said. "It just got out of hand. As we know,
such things can be dangerous."
Higher authority has apparently let the
deputy commander of the Northern
Command know of its displeasure. Israel's
editorial writers have twitted Begin for his
part in the war scare.
The basis for the reports was said to be

intelligence reports that Syria was receiv
ing massive supplies of Soviet-made milit
ary equipment of the latest type. Accom
panying them were Soviet advisers.
"But since September Ihere have been
no changes in the Syrians' deployment,"
an Israeli officer said Thursday, after all the
information from across the northeast
frontier had been reassessed.
"There is no evidence on the ground of
any Syrian threat. The general assessment
of our people is that the Syrians won't do
anything."
T he CIA offered the same assessment to
U.S. diplomats.
Different story
Bui a brigadier general in northern Israel
saw it all differently earlier in the week. He
delivered his opinions to a delegation of
British Conservative Party members who
toured the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights
and were then briefed at his headquarters.
"Syrian President (Hafez) Assad is in
terested in a war with Israel," the news
paper Haaretz quoted the general as say
ing, "whether because he wants to tor
pedo the Israel-Egypt peace treaty as fast
as possible or because of the shaky
domestic situation with Syria."
The visitors had asked the general's
opinion, Haaretz said. Begin, who was
questioned when he met the Britons in
lerusalem last Monday, backed up his
general. He mentioned reports that the
Syrians "may start warlike actions" and
added:
"We are following the developments
vigilantly. We are prepared. We are not

intimidated."
The military writers of Israeli newspap
er found experts who supported Begin
and others who disagreed with him, but all
mentioned the arms flow into Syria from
the Soviet Union.
1500 Soviets?
"Authoritative forces in Israel estimate
that there are now some 1500 Soviet offic
ers and soldiers in Syria as military advis
ers," the lead story in the daily newspaper
Maariv said. "The Soviet army personnel
are in Syria on training missions, to help
the Syrian army absorb the new equip
ment acquired from the U.S.S.R. . . about
100 T-72 tanks, MIG-25 planes, new ar
mored personnel carriers and surface-to
air batteries.
Actually, Syria is in considerable disar
ray. One-third of its army is mired in Leba
non as the mainstay of the Arab League
security force, and Syria's attempts to
work out a united front against Israel with
Iraq and Jordan have been sidetracked
amid bickering.
Still, those who see a real threat of war
point out that Arab leaders often use the
Israeli issue to distract their people's at
tention from local troubles.
Precedents
On the eve of Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat's 1977 visit to Israel, Mordechai Cur,
who was then chief of staff, warned in a
newspaper interview that Sadat might be
planning a surprise attack on Israel under
the cloak of peace. Cur apparently was
alarmed by Egyptian military maneuvers
that coincided with Sadat's Jerusalem visit.
