# Grad is 10th for women in NYC Marathon
## Med school staffer doubles as running champ 
### Michael London 
Vivian Soderholm-Difatte
made an unusual tour of New
York recently, covering 26 miles
oi lity streets on loot.
It took her two hours and 49
minutes.
Difatte's performance
earned her 10th piace amon,;
women runners in the Oct. 21
New York City Marathon. Di
fatte, a 23-year-old file clerk in
the Medical School admissions
office here, shyly admits to
being recognized as one of the
top 50 female marathoners in
the country.
Not bad for a woman who
first donned running shoes five

7 ate too much and I never studied, but
every day I did my running. It was the only
discipline I had/

years ago, and competed in
only two marathons before the
New York race. "I started run
ning in college," says Ditatte,
who graduated from Stanford
with an English major in 1978.
"I ate too much and I never
studied, but every day I did my
running. It was the only discip
line I had."
Ditatte fits few of the
stereotypes of the long dis
tance runner. Her short, com
pact frame looks more at home
nestled in a lounge chair than
on a running track. She has
none of the typical runner's
aloofness; she hesitates before
speaking, like a flustered
Annie Hall, but then she
launches into a torrent of
words.
"The New York race was in-

credible. It was the best thing
I've ever done in my life. The
whole scene was unbelieva
ble."
Starting from Staten Island,
11,000 men and women ran
through all five boroughs on a
26.2 mile trek ending in Central
Park. Two million people lined
the streets to watch.
"After a while everything
turned into a blur, and all I
could hear was the noise of the
crowd. It sounded like
everyone was yelling just for
me. Of course, I did get special
attention, being a woman."
Spurred on by the crowd, Di
fatte broke her personal

marathon record by more than
25 minutes. She crossed the
finish line 22 minutes after
Greta Waitz, who broke the
women's marathon world re
cord with a winning time of
2:27.
Medal, Perrier and a cold
"I felt great through the
whole race," Difatte said, "but
once I reached the finish line, I
came down with a horrendous
cold. I think that's the way it
works. You get your medal,
you get your Perrier, and you
get your cold."
The marathon was a
homecoming for Difatte, a
New York native. Her lamily

watched the race, but they we
ren't overawed by her success.
Proven ability
In the meantime, she is quite
content to run. She puts in six
to eight miles a day with the
Angell Field Ancients, a group
of veteran local runners whom
she affectionately calls "those
leathery old men. I owe a lot of
my success to them," she adds.
Difatte also works out with
the Stanford University track
squads. Brooks johnson, di
rector of Track and Field, calls
her "an extraordinarily gifted
athlete."
"Vivian has spectacular
proven ability. She could do
almost anything. It's just a
question of her realizing how
good she really is."
In the Runner's World Wo
men's Invitational Race in Los
Altos Dec. 31, Ditatte battled
with Greta Waitz and other
world class runners, and
wound up sixth at the end o!
the five mile course with a time
of 27:30. In a )an. 710-mile race
in Stockton, Difatte won the
women's division with a time
of 56:33, about a minute off
U.S. record time.
Difatte is more cautious
about her running career. She
rules out any Olympic hopes,
because the longest women's
race is the mile run. "It's terri
ble," she commented. "The
men have 5000 and 10,000 met
ers and a marathon. The
women have nothing. Greta
Waitz is the greatest woman
athlete in the world, and she
has no event to run in."

Difatte is reluctant to take on
the rigorous training schedule
which the top marathoners fol
low. "To really make it in the
big time, I'd have to do a lot of
work. Most of the women train
like the men now, lifting
weights and developing huge
thigh muscles. I don't enjoy
that."
She also dislikes working out
on a track, where the serious

distance runners inevitably
wind up. "I hate going around
in circles. It's dull and you feel
so pressured."
While she clearly isn't court
ing success, Difatte does enjoy
the small pleasures of celeb
rityhood. She speaks with
childlike amazement of the
promotional items beginning

to turn up in her mailbox.
"These companies send out
$30 running shoes, absolutely
tree. That's a lot ot money!"
Difatte's success in New
York will allow her to start near
the front of the pack in next
April's Boston Marathon. "Last
year," she recalled, "I was so
far back, it took me five mi
nutes after the gun sounded
just to reach the starting line."

In the next few months, Di
fatte plans to compete in local
track meets and slowly build
up her running schedule in
preparation for the Boston
Marathon. Remembering that
event, she abruptly stands up
and ends the interview. "I'm
done boring you," she says
with a smile. "I've got to run."

aloofness; she hesitates before
speaking, like a flustered
Annie Hall, but then she
launches into a torrent of
words.
"The New York race was in-

credible. It was the best thing
I've ever done in my life. The
whole scene was unbelieva
ble."
Starting from Staten Island,
11,000 men and women ran
through all five boroughs on a
26.2 mile trek ending in Central
Park. Two million people lined
the streets to watch.
"After a while everything
turned into a blur, and all I
could hear was the noise of the
crowd. It sounded like
everyone was yelling just for
me. Of course, I did get special
attention, being a woman."
Spurred on by the crowd, Di
fatte broke her personal

marathon record by more than
25 minutes. She crossed the
finish line 22 minutes after
Greta Waitz, who broke the
women's marathon world re
cord with a winning time of
2:27.
Medal, Perrier and a cold
"I felt great through the
whole race," Difatte said, "but
once I reached the finish line, I
came down with a horrendous
cold. I think that's the way it
works. You get your medal,
you get your Perrier, and you
get your cold."
The marathon was a
homecoming for Difatte, a
New York native. Her lamily

watched the race, but they we
ren't overawed by her success.
Proven ability
In the meantime, she is quite
content to run. She puts in six
to eight miles a day with the
Angell Field Ancients, a group
of veteran local runners whom
she affectionately calls "those
leathery old men. I owe a lot of
my success to them," she adds.
Difatte also works out with
the Stanford University track
squads. Brooks johnson, di
rector of Track and Field, calls
her "an extraordinarily gifted
athlete."
"Vivian has spectacular
proven ability. She could do
almost anything. It's just a
question of her realizing how
good she really is."
In the Runner's World Wo
men's Invitational Race in Los
Altos Dec. 31, Ditatte battled
with Greta Waitz and other
world class runners, and
wound up sixth at the end o!
the five mile course with a time
of 27:30. In a )an. 710-mile race
in Stockton, Difatte won the
women's division with a time
of 56:33, about a minute off
U.S. record time.
Difatte is more cautious
about her running career. She
rules out any Olympic hopes,
because the longest women's
race is the mile run. "It's terri
ble," she commented. "The
men have 5000 and 10,000 met
ers and a marathon. The
women have nothing. Greta
Waitz is the greatest woman
athlete in the world, and she
has no event to run in."

Difatte is reluctant to take on
the rigorous training schedule
which the top marathoners fol
low. "To really make it in the
big time, I'd have to do a lot of
work. Most of the women train
like the men now, lifting
weights and developing huge
thigh muscles. I don't enjoy
that."
She also dislikes working out
on a track, where the serious

distance runners inevitably
wind up. "I hate going around
in circles. It's dull and you feel
so pressured."
While she clearly isn't court
ing success, Difatte does enjoy
the small pleasures of celeb
rityhood. She speaks with
childlike amazement of the
promotional items beginning

to turn up in her mailbox.
"These companies send out
$30 running shoes, absolutely
tree. That's a lot ot money!"
Difatte's success in New
York will allow her to start near
the front of the pack in next
April's Boston Marathon. "Last
year," she recalled, "I was so
far back, it took me five mi
nutes after the gun sounded
just to reach the starting line."

In the next few months, Di
fatte plans to compete in local
track meets and slowly build
up her running schedule in
preparation for the Boston
Marathon. Remembering that
event, she abruptly stands up
and ends the interview. "I'm
done boring you," she says
with a smile. "I've got to run."

Vivian Soderholm-Difatte
made an unusual tour of New

It took her two hours and 49
minutes.
Difatte's performance

New York City Marathon. Di

Not bad for a woman who

7 ate too much and I never studied, but
every day I did my running. It was the only
discipline I had/

years ago, and competed in
only two marathons before the
New York race. "I started run

who graduated from Stanford
with an English major in 1978.
"I ate too much and I never
studied, but every day I did my
