## More issues in standardized test debate 
### 
As has become uncomforta
bly often the case, I saw none
of my own concerns raised by
either side of the ETS debate in
last week's Daily. I don't think
that the notion of "consumer
fraud" states the proper chal
lenge to standardized admis
sions testing, and the three
deans' reactions seemed more
an attempt to justify them
selves professionally than any
thing else.
For me, the statistical
niceties of success-prediction
and the demarcation between
using the test-scores and abus
ing them aren't the major is
sues here.
One issue that does concern
me a great deal is the historical
effect of standardized college
admissions tests on high
school curricula. Knowing that
their students' lives will be af
fected appreciably by their
scores on such tests.

secondary-level educators
have come to see part of their
jobs as preparing students to
take them. The general result
has been the breaking-down of
knowledge into the sort of par
ticles that can pass for answers
from "a" to "e."
This unnatural curricular
go al had led directly to English
courses wherein students
memorize scads of unfamiliar
words in bunches, learn to edit
other people's writing but not
do their own, and approach lit
erature as a repository of fi
gures of speech. In social
studies, students memorize
names and dates, learn what all
the -cracies mean, and gain
passing familiarity with -ism
after -ism. Mathematics and
the natural sciences have
everywhere been reduced to
"problems" and the accepted
professional techniques for
solving them.

I most clearly see the short
sightedness here in all the
whining and finger-pointing in
the wake of the much
ballyhooed decline on the
SAT-Verbal. I simply don't care
that some fewer students know
what "admonitory" and "con
tumacious" mean and can dis
tinguish between a misplaced
modifier and an error in diction
in someone else's writing.
I would like to be able to laugh
when critics like Paul Copper
man treat "mistakes" like this
as evidence for a great national
loss of "verbal ability," but I
know that taxpayers' and pa
rents' attitudes are being
shaped by such nonsense.
My second major concern is
with the role of standardized
admissions tests in gate
keeping. Because they effec
tively define such concepts as
"scholastic aptitude" and
"verbal ability," ETS tests do

much more than reveal prior
difference, as president Wil
liam Turnbull keeps insisting.
Historically, standardized
tests have been used to
rationalize the disproportion
ate selection of well-off whites
at each successive educational
level. If the notion of equal op
portunity is ever to become
non-mythical, at some point
the excision of poor and/or
minority candidates in the
name of lesser "readiness" will
have to be stopped. Believe
me, if any "objective" test con
sistently gave blacks 120 more
points than whites on the aver
age, the cries of culture bias
and reverse discrimination
would be deafening. And at
tended to, post-haste.
Let us recall that the father of
standardized objective testing
in this country, the late Lewis
B. Terman, world-famous Stan
ford engineering professor,

"knew" that his tests were
working well when non-whites
did so badly on them.
Since the "dullness" of
Spanish-Indian, Mexican, and
Negro children was racial,
Terman wrote, they should be
"segregated in special classes"
where they would be trained to
be "efficient workers." Ter
man also suggested that "they
should not be allowed to re
produce."
In a very real sense, ETS has
become the corporate grand
child of Terman's social vision,
minus the viciousness of the
rhetoric. However mitigated
by the good judgment and
good will of admissions offic
ers like our own, the "norms"
set by ETS tests perpetuate and
justify a status quo ante that I,
for one, find unacceptable.

"scholastic aptitude" and
"verbal ability," ETS tests do

much more than reveal prior
difference, as president Wil
liam Turnbull keeps insisting.
Historically, standardized
tests have been used to
rationalize the disproportion
ate selection of well-off whites
at each successive educational
level. If the notion of equal op
portunity is ever to become
non-mythical, at some point
the excision of poor and/or
minority candidates in the
name of lesser "readiness" will
have to be stopped. Believe
me, if any "objective" test con
sistently gave blacks 120 more
points than whites on the aver
age, the cries of culture bias
and reverse discrimination
would be deafening. And at
tended to, post-haste.
Let us recall that the father of
standardized objective testing
in this country, the late Lewis
B. Terman, world-famous Stan
ford engineering professor,

"knew" that his tests were
working well when non-whites
did so badly on them.
Since the "dullness" of
Spanish-Indian, Mexican, and
Negro children was racial,
Terman wrote, they should be
"segregated in special classes"
where they would be trained to
be "efficient workers." Ter
man also suggested that "they
should not be allowed to re
produce."
In a very real sense, ETS has
become the corporate grand
child of Terman's social vision,
minus the viciousness of the
rhetoric. However mitigated
by the good judgment and
good will of admissions offic
ers like our own, the "norms"
set by ETS tests perpetuate and
justify a status quo ante that I,
for one, find unacceptable.

As has become uncomforta
bly often the case, I saw none
of my own concerns raised by
either side of the ETS debate in
last week's Daily. I don't think
that the notion of "consumer
fraud" states the proper chal
lenge to standardized admis
sions testing, and the three
deans' reactions seemed more
an attempt to justify them
selves professionally than any
thing else.
For me, the statistical
niceties of success-prediction
and the demarcation between
using the test-scores and abus
ing them aren't the major is
sues here.
One issue that does concern
me a great deal is the historical
effect of standardized college
admissions tests on high
school curricula. Knowing that
their students' lives will be af
fected appreciably by their
scores on such tests.

secondary-level educators
have come to see part of their
jobs as preparing students to
take them. The general result
has been the breaking-down of
knowledge into the sort of par
ticles that can pass for answers
from "a" to "e."
This unnatural curricular
go al had led directly to English
courses wherein students
memorize scads of unfamiliar
words in bunches, learn to edit
other people's writing but not
do their own, and approach lit
erature as a repository of fi
gures of speech. In social
studies, students memorize
names and dates, learn what all
the -cracies mean, and gain
passing familiarity with -ism
after -ism. Mathematics and
the natural sciences have
everywhere been reduced to
"problems" and the accepted
professional techniques for
solving them.

I most clearly see the short
sightedness here in all the
whining and finger-pointing in
the wake of the much
ballyhooed decline on the
SAT-Verbal. I simply don't care
that some fewer students know
what "admonitory" and "con
tumacious" mean and can dis
tinguish between a misplaced
modifier and an error in diction
in someone else's writing.
I would like to be able to laugh
when critics like Paul Copper
man treat "mistakes" like this
as evidence for a great national
loss of "verbal ability," but I
know that taxpayers' and pa
rents' attitudes are being
shaped by such nonsense.
My second major concern is
with the role of standardized
admissions tests in gate
keeping. Because they effec
tively define such concepts as
"scholastic aptitude" and
"verbal ability," ETS tests do

much more than reveal prior
difference, as president Wil
liam Turnbull keeps insisting.

tests have been used to
rationalize the disproportion
