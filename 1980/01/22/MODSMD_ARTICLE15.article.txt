Soviet aggression in Af
ghanistan is the most serious
challenge to the free world
since WW 11. Even if its original
objectives were to quell the
Moslem rebellion in Afghanis
tan, the invasion may easily es
calate into a pincer movement
through the Baluchi areas of
Pakistan and Iran to the shores
of the Arabian Sea. Thus, the
Damoclean sword of the
Soviets would be thrust closest
to the neck of the Persian Gulf
which supplies some 60 per
cent of energy to the industrial
West and Japan.
Under these dire
circumstances, I find it disturb
ing to hear some politicians
speculate that Afghanistan
might become Russia's Viet
nam. They mean that eventu
ally the USSR is going to suffer
a military defeat by the Afghan
guerillas. As an ostrich on a run
from a predator, our politicians
hide their heads in the sand of
wishful thinking.

I do not wish to dispute the
suitability of the Afghan terrain
for guerilla warfare, nor to de
tract from the reputation of the
Afghans as skillful and
courageous fighters. And I pre
fer to leave aside the imputa
tion of the American involve
ment in Vietnam, suggesting
only that the five years of the
Communist "peace" in In
dochina have probably taken a
heavier toll of lives, misery and
humiliation for the Vietnamese,
Laotians and Cambodians than
the previous 10 years of war.
What I would rather concen
trate on is the wishful-thinking
aspect of the analogy, namely,
the failure to recognize the fact
that our defeat in Indochina
was engineered not so much
by Viet Cong or even North
Vietnam but principally by the
Soviets who have managed to
turn the world, and our own
youth, against the United
States while unabashedly sup
plying arms for the aggression
from the North.
So, before talking about a
potential Soviet debacle in Af
ghanistan, we should face the
truth that in Afghanistan we
have suffered, through our de
fault, a second, and more
ominous "Vietnam" as a con
sequence of our failure to
stand firm in the first.
The real question we must
now ask is: Are we prepared to
do to the Soviets in Afghanis
tan what they have done to us
in Vietnam? The answer is: no.
Certainly, not to the extent of
Soviet involvement in Viet
nam, simply because we can
not resort to their totalitarian
methods of coercing citizens.
This does not mean we should
make no efforts at all.
)ust to restore the balance of
power of last year, we must,
first, deter the Soviets from
spilling their aggression over
the borders of Pakistan and
Iran, thus destabilizing the
former and possibly replacing
Khomeini's shaky rule with a
pro-Soviet regime in the latter;
second, we should bring the
political, economic, and milit
ary pressure to bear on the
Soviets to make them withdraw
their troops from Afghanistan.
The measures taken by Pres
ident Carter so far are hardly
adequate to the task. They
should be strengthened by:
1) a joint declaration of the
NATO countries that a Soviet
intervention in Pakistan and
Iran will make them free to
choose a military option;

2) urgent steps to create an al
liance of Moslem states tor the
defense of the Persian Gulf and
the adjacent region (while re
stricting playing the "China
card" to the Chinese territory);
3) steps to ensure arms
supplies to the Afghan national
liberation movement through
the intermediary of a Moslem
alliance.
Although the U.S. govern
ment has no legal right to bar
American athletes from the
Moscow Olympics, it should
take the initiative of declaring
such participation undesira
ble, as long as there are Soviet
troops in Afghanistan.
Still, no measures of the
government will be adequate
unless they have broad public
support. President Carter has
now a rare opportunity to rally
such support by invoking the
words of ]ohn F. Kennedy:.
"Ask not what your country
can do for you; ask what you
can do for your country." At no
moment since they were ut
tered were these words more
needed than they are now,
when we are closest to WW 111
because our adversaries per
ceive our lack of national will.
These words must touch
even the most deep-seated
patriotic stirrings in American
hearts. At the very least, they
will cause our farmers, the
Moscow-bound athletic and
television teams, presidential
contenders and senators to
think twice before withholding
their support of our govern
ment. Some of them may even
follow the noble example of
the ALCOA Company, which
broke off negotiations with the
USSR, or of those longshore
men who promise to aggravate
the grain sale embargo by their
refusal to load the ships.
I also hope that, when our
young people, the children of
those to whom these words
were originally addressed, ask
our president what they must
do for the country, he will have
the wisdom and courage to tell
them that, besides demonstrat
ing in front of the Soviet em
bassy, they should consider
volunteering for our danger
ously undermanned armeo
forces â€” or face a reinstituted
universal draft.
