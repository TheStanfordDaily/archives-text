# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Tom Pratt Chicago's 'Atrium' a sign of hope from the inner city 
### 
Ever since I can remember
I've thought of the innercity as
a depressing place. Though I
get excited every time I travel
in one of America's larger
cities, thoughts of crime, pov
erty, racial tensions, in
adequate school systems and
urban renewal failures quickly
fake the edge off of my enjoy
ment. A friend ot mine from
Islew York summed it up well
when he told me, "It's a nice
place to visit, but I live there."
During the past Christmas
break, however, I saw some
thing in Chicago that cracked
my cynicism about the future
of America's inner cities. I saw
first hand what can be done to
renew a community when a
Small group of people who
care go to work.
After attending a worldwide
missions convention at the
University of Illinois, a Iriend
and I were able to stay a few
days in Chicago with the

Leslies, a family we had met
through Lisa Leslie, a Stanford
freshman. Rev. Leslie is the
pastor of the evangelical La
Salle St. Church, an inner city
congregation located in one of
the more dangerous areas of
Chicago.
Rev. Leslie told me that three
serious difficulties plagued his
community: first, the poverty
and loneliness of the inner city
elderly; second, the dismal fai
lure of urban renewal highrise
projects to supply adequate
and safe housing for the poor;
and third, the displacement of
the poor caused by the new
influx of upper-middle class
whites back into the inner city,
a process often called "regen
trification."
With civic, state and federal
governments doing little about
these problems, the La Salle St.
congregation decided to act.
They began an outreach to the
elderly with a large number of

regular volunteers who visit,
feed and give transportation
and social opportunities to
over 300 elderly of all racial
backgrounds.
They opened a legal clinic
staffed by three full-time
lawyers who defend the rights
of the elderly and poor against
their inner city exploiters, of
whom there are many. And fi
nally, in their most ambitious
vision, they last year opened
an alternative urban renewal
housing complex called "The

Atrium."
The Atrium consists of or,_
highrise and two smaller build
ings in which people of all ra
cial backgrounds and
economic situations live to
gether. Families making over
$100,000 a year live next door
to families living below the
poverty line. Rental policies
obviously vary with differing
economic situations. In this
way, The Atrium brings the re
gentrification surge and the
indigenous poor together,

thus avoiding displacement.
One of the worst aspects of
federal urban renewal projects
has been the incredible crime
rates in these highrises, this
due to poor architectural
planning with long, dark halls,
secluded elevators and little or
no recreational areas for the
youth.
The Atrium was designed to
avoid these problems by ar
chitecturally inducing a com
munity atmosphere, and the
state and federal governments

were so impressed with the ini
tial plans that they financed
and insured the project.
And because it has worked
so well since its opening, it is
now up for an HUD award.
Rev. Leslie told me The Atrium
is the only urban housing pro
ject in the country where
people of all ages, races and
economic levels live together
in a clean, relatively crime-free
atmosphere. He hoped it will
be a model for future urban
planning.

I'm sure some will scoff at
these efforts as a mere "drop
in the bucket" compared with
the problems facing even
Chicago, let alone all the na
tion's cities.
But for me at least it was an
encouragement for the future,
a hope that even the inner city
can become a place worthy of
the people who live and work
and spend their lives there.

Ever since I can remember
I've thought of the innercity as
a depressing place. Though I
get excited every time I travel
in one of America's larger
cities, thoughts of crime, pov
erty, racial tensions, in
adequate school systems and
urban renewal failures quickly
fake the edge off of my enjoy
ment. A friend ot mine from
Islew York summed it up well
when he told me, "It's a nice
place to visit, but I live there."
During the past Christmas
break, however, I saw some
thing in Chicago that cracked
my cynicism about the future
of America's inner cities. I saw
first hand what can be done to
renew a community when a
Small group of people who
care go to work.
After attending a worldwide
missions convention at the
University of Illinois, a Iriend
and I were able to stay a few
days in Chicago with the

Leslies, a family we had met
through Lisa Leslie, a Stanford
freshman. Rev. Leslie is the
pastor of the evangelical La
Salle St. Church, an inner city
congregation located in one of
the more dangerous areas of
Chicago.
Rev. Leslie told me that three
serious difficulties plagued his
community: first, the poverty
and loneliness of the inner city
elderly; second, the dismal fai
lure of urban renewal highrise
projects to supply adequate
and safe housing for the poor;
and third, the displacement of
the poor caused by the new
influx of upper-middle class
whites back into the inner city,
a process often called "regen
trification."
With civic, state and federal
governments doing little about
these problems, the La Salle St.
congregation decided to act.
They began an outreach to the
elderly with a large number of

regular volunteers who visit,
feed and give transportation
and social opportunities to
over 300 elderly of all racial
backgrounds.
They opened a legal clinic
staffed by three full-time
lawyers who defend the rights
of the elderly and poor against
their inner city exploiters, of
whom there are many. And fi
nally, in their most ambitious
vision, they last year opened
an alternative urban renewal
housing complex called "The

Atrium."
The Atrium consists of or,_
highrise and two smaller build
ings in which people of all ra
cial backgrounds and
economic situations live to
gether. Families making over
$100,000 a year live next door
to families living below the
poverty line. Rental policies
obviously vary with differing
economic situations. In this
way, The Atrium brings the re
gentrification surge and the
indigenous poor together,

thus avoiding displacement.
One of the worst aspects of
federal urban renewal projects
has been the incredible crime
rates in these highrises, this
due to poor architectural
planning with long, dark halls,
secluded elevators and little or
no recreational areas for the
youth.
The Atrium was designed to
avoid these problems by ar
chitecturally inducing a com
munity atmosphere, and the
state and federal governments

were so impressed with the ini
tial plans that they financed
and insured the project.
And because it has worked
so well since its opening, it is
now up for an HUD award.
Rev. Leslie told me The Atrium
is the only urban housing pro
ject in the country where
people of all ages, races and
economic levels live together
in a clean, relatively crime-free
atmosphere. He hoped it will
be a model for future urban
planning.

I'm sure some will scoff at
these efforts as a mere "drop
in the bucket" compared with
the problems facing even
Chicago, let alone all the na
tion's cities.
But for me at least it was an
encouragement for the future,
a hope that even the inner city
can become a place worthy of
the people who live and work
and spend their lives there.
