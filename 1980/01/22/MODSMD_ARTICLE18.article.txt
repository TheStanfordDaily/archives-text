## Student voice must be heard at Tresidder 
### 
The settlement of the six
month old Coffee House labor
dispute comes as a relief to all
parties involved. As TDS spits
and polishes its image for the
upcoming contract negotia
tions, the old workers prepare
to pay off debts incurred dur
ing long-term unemployment,
the True Coffee House suppor
ters once again drink coffee on
campus with a clear consci
ence.
Now that the battles are
over, we find reason to explain
to the community why the dis
pute continued for nearly half a
year, and for this we must
admit one of near-fatal miscal
culation; we applied forhelpin
the settlement of this dispute
to those in the best position to
help us.
While hesitating to mention
the names of Dan Williams and
Ellie Oppenheim (director and
associate director of Tresidder
Union), let us just say that we
appealed to the people most
intimately involved with our is
sue.
Perhaps we betrayed a cer
tain lack of trust by presenting
these people with 3000 signa
tures of support rather than
appealing directly to their
sense of honor, thus stimulat
ing bitterness where assis
tance would surely have been
offered. We may even be guilty
of presuming that the firings
would never have taken place
without their (at least tacit) ap
proval.
Whatever the case may have

been, these people were un
able, over nearly a six-month
period, to bring us even one
step closer to an out-of-court
settlement.
We are instead indebted to
the efforts of three members of
Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS), anonymous at their
own request, for giving us
the folly of our rationality, and
for acting upon the faith that
where two parties suffered
from a continued stalemate,
those same two parties could
be brought to an agreement
favorable to both. (This is the
role one would have supposed
Stanford's representatives
would have played.)
Under the terms of the ag
reement, STARTS(formerly
Tresidder Program Board) will
extend their student volunteer

operation of free programs and
events to the Coffee House —
free entertainment, once
again. With this as their sole
compensation for six weeks of
intensive negotiations, these
three students were able to do
in a matter of weeks what the
directors of Tresidder refused
to do in as many months.
In fact, there is good reason
why Tresidder conspicuously
lacks the word "Student" in its
Union. Most university student
unions are not required to live
off profits from the sale of food
by outside corporations. At
worst, they are break-even op
erations run by the university
as a service; at best, they are
owned and operated by the
students themselves.
Tresidder Union, on the
other hand, operates like a

shopping center. Pushing beer
and wine means big sales, and
Tresidder collects 10 percent of
gross sales even when the
Coffee House is operating in
the red (as it was from the time
of the firings until December,
when it barely broke even.)
We would like to make clear
that none of the old employees
of the Coffee House was ever
against the establishment of a
pubon campus. We simply ob
jected to the sacrifice of the
Coffee House for this purpose
— an operation which has
been successful and popular
since a group of Wilbur stu
dents founded it 12 years ago
— while places like the Transi
tion and the Station continue
to falter, despite frequent
changes in appellation over the
last few years. Again, the con

tract between TDS and Stan
ford stipulates that major capi
tal investments be made by the
University, and the directors of
Tresidder would prefer in
creased profits for free. The
jobs of a few dozen students
and alumni were, as a result,
expendabJe.
Finally, we would like to
thank the Stanford community
for their support of our
boycott, and, with extraordi
nary pleasure and relief, an
nounce that that boycott is of
ficially and permanently over.
We ask only that you re
member that student voices
can and must continue to be
heard at Tresidder, despite the
lack of concern on the part of
those who run it.
