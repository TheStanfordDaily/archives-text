Unfair protrayals
In their zeal to conquer the
last remnants of sexism at Stan
ford, the publishers of A Wo
man's Guide to Stanford some
times made unfair portrayals or
used offensive quotes to de
monstrate the problems. Sure,
sexism still exists here, and I
support any organization
which specifically addresses
the problems women face in
our society, but we can't red
ress gross generalizations or
implicit stereotypes by creat
ing new ones.
I don't think it's fair to many

of the people here who truly
don't suffer from disabling
sexual prejudice to portray the
situation as any worse than it
really is. For instance, the fol
lowing quote printed in A Wo
man's Guide to Stanford was
intended to illustrate how sex
ually biased some (most) men
still are,
"I asked three of my male
friends once if they truthfully
believed that women at Stan
ford are on an equal intellec
tual footing as men. After some
hesitation each one replied
no."
Personally, I feel I would be

hard pressed to find three men
in my dorm who would seri
ously challenge the innate
academic prowess of women,
or at least admit doing so. Sure
at least three old-liners proba
bly still exist but I have found
many more examples of truly
thoughtful and broad-minded
men.
Another passage in A Wo
man's Guide to Stanford which
tends to make men look like a
pack of coarse and loutish oafs
is,
"There is no difference bet
ween being raped and being
run over by a truck except that

afterward men ask you if you
enjoyed it."
I realize I am lucky to have
been raised in such a time and
under such conditions that I
have never felt any restricting
sexual barriers but there is cer
tainly more to gaining confi
dence and a good self-esteem
than overcoming the stigma of
womanhood. Women aren't
the only ones who suffer from
unfounded stereotypes and
they won't be the only ones to
benefit from their extirpation.
