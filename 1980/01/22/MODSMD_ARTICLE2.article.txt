# President releases State of the Union address
## Carter promises lower federal deficit 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
Washington — President jimmy
Carter promised yesterday to con
sider a tax cut later this year if
economic conditions "sharply wor
sen," but warned that reducing taxes
now would increase inflation.
Carter, outlining his domestic and
foreign policies in a written State of
the Union message, also promised
the smallest federal deficit in seven
years in his new budget. Officials put
the deficit at about $15 billion.
Despite election-year support for
tax reduction among some members
of Congress, the president said it was
too early to tell if tax cuts are needed
to counter a recession predicted for
this spring.
Serious risk
"To enact tax cuts now would run a
serious risk of adding inflationary
demand pressures to an economy
which continues to grow more
strongly than predicted by the fore
casts," Carter said.
"With the present high inflation,
we cannot afford that risk," he ad
ded. "Forecasts of impending reces
sion may. . . prove to be as wrong as
previous ones."
In other parts of his 70,000-word
message, the president:
—Asked Congress, which con
venes today to consider as "the first
order of business" an economic and

military aid package for Pakistan,
which is threatened by the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan.
—Declared that the United States
would be ready to work out a "new
and mutually beneficial relation
ship" with Iran if that nation releases
American hostages held at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran since Nov. 4.
—Reaffirmed that his new budget
would ask $158 billion for defense
funding, an increase of more than 5
percent over the preceding year,
after adjusting for the impact of infla
tion.
—Disclosed that he will ask for a
modest increase in the number of
government-subsidized rental units
and a small increase in the number of
federally aided houses.
Contingency planning
In the message sent to Congress 4a
hours before his scheduled State of
the Union address to members of the
House and Senate Wednesday night,
Carter said he had ordered con
tingency planning for tax reductions
in case unemployment rises dramati
cally from its 5.9 percent level of last
month.
"Should the economic situation
and prospects sharply worsen, I will
consider recommendations to deal
with the situation," Carter said.
"Under those circumstances, tax
cuts and other measures could be

taken to improve the prospects for
employment growth, to reduce bus
iness costs and to assist those most
severely damaged by recession,
without threatening to set off in
flationary demand pressures."
Without mentioning that inflation
in 1979 ran about 13 percent, the
highest rate since the end ot World
War 11, the president held out hope
of improvement, saying:
"Inflation will slow this year. In
1981 it should be even lower." Carter
said his budget for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1 assumes that a reces
sion will take place this year, but he
added: "However, none of the cur
rent economic statistics yet show any
overall economic decline."
Tax reduction
If taxes are reduced, the president
added, the cuts should be aimed at
providing incentives for increased
investment, improved productivity
and adjustment to higher energy
prices.
"Serious consideration should be
given, in the case of tax cuts for indi
viduals, to lowering Social Security
payroll taxes, since half of such re
ductions would go towards lowering
business costs and prices," he said.
Senior administration officials said
the written message was designed to
spell out details of Carter's policy
that could not be included in his

speech and to provide a context for
tomorrow's talk.
It also served as a guide to con
gressional committee chairmen
planning forthe abbreviated session,
which is expected to adjourn before
July for the national political conven
tions and the ensuing campaign.
"There is no time to waste," Carter
said, aware of the limited time the
lawmakers will spend in Washington
in an election year.

tions and the ensuing campaign.
"There is no time to waste," Carter

in an election year.
The Los Angeles Times
Washington — President jimmy
Carter promised yesterday to con
sider a tax cut later this year if
economic conditions "sharply wor
sen," but warned that reducing taxes
now would increase inflation.
Carter, outlining his domestic and
foreign policies in a written State of
the Union message, also promised
the smallest federal deficit in seven
years in his new budget. Officials put
the deficit at about $15 billion.
Despite election-year support for
tax reduction among some members
of Congress, the president said it was
too early to tell if tax cuts are needed
to counter a recession predicted for
this spring.
Serious risk
"To enact tax cuts now would run a
serious risk of adding inflationary
demand pressures to an economy
which continues to grow more
strongly than predicted by the fore
casts," Carter said.
"With the present high inflation,
we cannot afford that risk," he ad
ded. "Forecasts of impending reces
sion may. . . prove to be as wrong as
previous ones."
In other parts of his 70,000-word
message, the president:
—Asked Congress, which con
venes today to consider as "the first
order of business" an economic and

military aid package for Pakistan,
which is threatened by the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan.
—Declared that the United States
would be ready to work out a "new
and mutually beneficial relation
ship" with Iran if that nation releases
American hostages held at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran since Nov. 4.
—Reaffirmed that his new budget
would ask $158 billion for defense
funding, an increase of more than 5
percent over the preceding year,
after adjusting for the impact of infla
tion.
—Disclosed that he will ask for a
modest increase in the number of
government-subsidized rental units
and a small increase in the number of
federally aided houses.
Contingency planning
In the message sent to Congress 4a
hours before his scheduled State of
the Union address to members of the
House and Senate Wednesday night,
Carter said he had ordered con
tingency planning for tax reductions
in case unemployment rises dramati
cally from its 5.9 percent level of last
month.
"Should the economic situation
and prospects sharply worsen, I will
consider recommendations to deal
with the situation," Carter said.
"Under those circumstances, tax
cuts and other measures could be

taken to improve the prospects for
employment growth, to reduce bus
iness costs and to assist those most
severely damaged by recession,
without threatening to set off in
flationary demand pressures."
Without mentioning that inflation
in 1979 ran about 13 percent, the
highest rate since the end ot World
War 11, the president held out hope
of improvement, saying:
"Inflation will slow this year. In
1981 it should be even lower." Carter
said his budget for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1 assumes that a reces
sion will take place this year, but he
added: "However, none of the cur
rent economic statistics yet show any
overall economic decline."
Tax reduction
If taxes are reduced, the president
added, the cuts should be aimed at
providing incentives for increased
investment, improved productivity
and adjustment to higher energy
prices.
"Serious consideration should be
given, in the case of tax cuts for indi
viduals, to lowering Social Security
payroll taxes, since half of such re
ductions would go towards lowering
business costs and prices," he said.
Senior administration officials said
the written message was designed to
spell out details of Carter's policy
that could not be included in his

speech and to provide a context for
tomorrow's talk.
It also served as a guide to con
gressional committee chairmen
planning forthe abbreviated session,
which is expected to adjourn before
July for the national political conven
tions and the ensuing campaign.
"There is no time to waste," Carter
said, aware of the limited time the
lawmakers will spend in Washington
in an election year.
