# Service advises on small claims, rentals
## ASSU offers students legal counseling 
### Jan Mireles 
Tenant-landlord problems
have long plagued those who
rent and lease real estate, and
many students complain that
when they encounter difficult
landlords, the students usually
wind up with the short end of
the stick.
The ASSU Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) contends that
that doesn't have to be the
case, however. Located in Tre
sidder Union, the LCO is avail
able for University students
and their spouses in need of
many types of legal counsel
ing.
"We have a significant load
of landlord-tenant problems,"
said Douglas Morgan, one of
five lawyers operating the legal
service.
"Problems range from land
lords refusing to make repairs
to refusing security deposit re
funds. Because of this, stu
dents sometimes end up in
small claims court," Morgan
added.
Small claims court does not
require lawyers. The two par
ties meet with a judge and
voice their complaints. More
than 90 percent of the cases
handled by the legal service are
resolved in smafl claims court.
If the claim involves more than

$750, however, the student has
to seek alternatives.
"The legal service does not
go to court unless we are speci
fically retained through our law
firm," Morgan said. Because
the lawyers do not represent
students in court, their primary
function is to give advice.
The legal service also aids
students with consumer prob
lems, personal injury cases that
may result from auto acci
dents, and with domestic rela
tions. Domestic relations in
clude uncontested divorces,
name changes and simple
wills.
The $10 fee for simple wills
and the dollar assessment fee
students pay during registra
tion fund the service. Students
must have paid the fee at the
beginning of the quarter to

qualify for assistance.
"Our work load is such that
we don't have time to handle
problems from students who
haven't paid the fee," Morgan
said.
The LCO cannot handle
problems involving the Uni
versity, such as housing disag
reements. These are referred
to the ombudsman.
The LCO was established in
the fall of 1973, when five law
partners in Palo Alto answered
an ad from the student body
requesting a half-time lawyer.
They took the job as a firm, and
alternate office hours. Several
firms and lawyers were inter
viewed before the current firm
of Morgan, Ruby, Franich,
Schofield and Fredkin was
chosen to head the LCO.
Morgan said his reasons for

participating in the service are
varied; "I enjoy it. I encounter
different attitudes than I would
trying to reorganize someone's
business," explained Morgan.
The legal service is con
ducted in the same manneras a
"typical" law firm. The atmos
phere is perhaps a bit more re
laxed, but all consultations are
confidential.
"We take great pride in the
strictness of our confidential
treatment of their problems,"
concluded Morgan.
The LCO has also tradition
ally been staffed by about 10
volunteer Stanford law stu
dents. They serve as assistants
to the lawyers. Five full lawyers
now staff the office at various
times; regular hours are from 9
a.m. tos p.m. onTuesdaysand
Thursdays.
