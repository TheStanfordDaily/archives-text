# Clouds shed light on theory of the universe's birth

### 
The Los Angeles Times
Pasadena, Calif. — Astronomers at
the California Institute of Technology
(CalTech) have discovered large,
wispy clouds of pure hydrogen and
helium along the farthest edges of the
observable universe, clouds so un
contaminated by other elements that
they could only be the remnants from
the "Big Bang" that created the uni
verse somewhere between 12 and 18
billion years ago.
Now the almost unanimous scien
tific theory of the universe's origins
and evolution, the Big Bang model
states that there was a stupendous
explosion of radiation, along with
trace amounts of matter, from an
atomic pin-hole 12 billion to 18 billion
years ago.
That radiation — visible light,
X-rays, ultra-violet and infra-red rays,
microwaves and radio waves — ex
panded outward in all directions and
at incredible speeds. But as it ex
panded, the radiation also slowed

and cooled — so much so that by the
end of a million years after the explo
sion, some of that energy began to
condense out as hydrogen and
helium.
And as more time passed and that
radiation decelerated and its temper
atures dropped further, still more of
it was transformed into increasing
quantities of hydrogen, deuterium (a
heavy form of hydrogen), helium and
lithium. These are the lightest ele
ments.
The primordial clouds blew out
ward, expanding the volume of the
universe as they did so, but it was
another 3 billion to 4 billion years
after the Big Bang before these ele
ments began clumping together to
form stars and galaxies.
At that, only a fraction of the matter
in the primordial, pristine clouds
went into the making of the galaxies;
large quantities fell on the cosmic
cutting-room floor, so to speak, and
these still drift through the intergalac

tic medium.
What Prof. Wallace Sargent and
Asst. Prof. Peter Young, both CalTech
astronomers, and their University
College London colleagues, Prof.
Alec Boksenberg, a physicist, and
David Tytler, an astronomer, believe
they have found are a half-dozen or
so of those unused, primitive clouds.
Dr. Sargent, reached at home by
telephone last week, said that the
team peered through the 200-inch
Palomar telescope near San Diego
and the 150-inch Anglo-Austrian tele
scope at Siding Spring, Australia, at a
half-dozen or so quasars.
Quasars are baffling objects that
put out mind-boggling amounts of
energy from very small, well-defined
points; they appear to be very distant
and, therefore, very ancient. In fact,
astronomers know of no other ob
jects in the universe that are older.
Sargent, Young, Boksenberg and
Tytler analyzed the light coming from
those quasars, as it passed through

some intervening clouds of hydrogen
and helium. Since different elements
absorb light at characteristic
wavelengths, the American and
British scientists were able to tell
what elements were present in the
clouds by determining which
wavelengths had been absorbed.
They found that only the hydrogen
and helium absorption lines were
present. Missing were the telltale
lines of such other elements as car
bon, oxygen or iron — all elements
that can only be cooked in the cruci
bles of stars, but that get scattered
throughout space when stars die and
explode.
If their particular clouds were not
contaminated by heavier elements,
the scientists reasoned, it could only
be because they were beyond the
reach of exploding stars. That meant
the clouds were more distant and
older than even the oldest stars, and
stars have been forming for at least 12
billion to 15 billion years.

points; they appear to be very distant
and, therefore, very ancient. In fact,
astronomers know of no other ob
jects in the universe that are older.
Sargent, Young, Boksenberg and
Tytler analyzed the light coming from
those quasars, as it passed through

some intervening clouds of hydrogen
and helium. Since different elements
absorb light at characteristic
wavelengths, the American and
British scientists were able to tell
what elements were present in the
clouds by determining which
wavelengths had been absorbed.
They found that only the hydrogen
and helium absorption lines were
present. Missing were the telltale
lines of such other elements as car
bon, oxygen or iron — all elements
that can only be cooked in the cruci
bles of stars, but that get scattered
throughout space when stars die and
explode.
If their particular clouds were not
contaminated by heavier elements,
the scientists reasoned, it could only
be because they were beyond the
reach of exploding stars. That meant
the clouds were more distant and
older than even the oldest stars, and
stars have been forming for at least 12
billion to 15 billion years.
