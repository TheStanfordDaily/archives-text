## Stan ford grads Newman, Hunt Onstage and off, BARC's life's as good as its bite 
### 
Admit it: you've always
wanted to be an actor. But
you're scared. . .
Two of 1700 people inter
viewed for the British Ameri
can Repertory Company's 12
slots, Stephen D. Newman and
Ruth Hunt, claim the odds are
at least this bad forevery acting
job in New York. But they don't
seem to be worried.
Since receiving MFAs from
Stanford in the late '60s, the
couple has accumulated im
pressive credentials.
Hunt's blonde, blue
jeaned and entirely unpreten
tious manner belies her broad
dramatic experience. Among
her many appearances are The
Last of Mrs. Cheyney with De
borah Kerr a tour of Jesus
Christ Superstar, Dame Judith
Anderson's Hamlet and televi
sion soap operas.
Her husband, an attractive
Seattle native with a warm
smile and the same approach
able air, won an Obie for his
role in the Chelsea Theatre's
Polly and was voted Best Actor
in the Variety Critic's Poll for
the role of Mac Heath in The
Beggar's Opera. He has ap
peared in such films as Net
work and The Seduction of /oe
Tynan.
Although each has enjoyed
success, both seem to have en
tered the profession realizing
that an actor's life holds few
guarantees. Explaining that liv
ing in New York provides many
job possibilities, Newman said,
"It's part of the blessing and
part of the curse that you're
faced with options every few
weeks.
"Lots of times there are sur
prises in relinquishing de
mands for the exact shape of
your career."
Asked to paint a picture of
the ideal life, Hunt said she
stopped doing this years ago.

She claimed the odds of find
ing a part are much worse for
women than for men, and that
"Men can be less talented and
still have a career."
Sometimes, she explained,
"you can feel unworthy if you
don't happen to be a 5'6"
brunette who can ride a unicy
cle." She said that "the big
problem isn't working, it's
dealing with the time between
jobs, the enforced retire
ments. Education helps to de
velop one's interests and
makes it easier to structure
time off work."
Newman, as well, stressed
the importance of education,
saying an actor shouldn't live
or die just when he's onstage.
He said he regrets not using
Stanford as he might have.
When he was going to school,
he said, "There were some
great professors who brought
an encyclopedic perspective to
the whole current of western
thought."
The couple credited Stan
ford, not only for strong
academic training, but also
with giving them a good artistic
foundation. "When the moti
vation for approval and
applause ends, you think
about developing a craft,"
Newman said. Both were

members of the Stanford Re
pertory Theatre, which in
volved students and profes
sionals in the training and per
forming processes.
"The big problem with
drama schools," Newman said,
"is that they teach people to go
out and teach others. The Stan
ford Rep was more intent on
turning out professionals.
"When you get to New York,
the rehearsal's over. They ex
pect you to do it right."
Both said they rely on each
other for professional criti
cism. Of her husband, Hunt
said, "I've found it helpful to
be around someone with a
practical history in the theater.
It's good to have someone you
trust with a similar vocabulary
who can give you intelligent
feedback."
Asked whether having a
two-career marriage creates a
problem, Newman explained
that a lot of decisions con
stantly need to be made about
professional issues. "If a show
is going out of town, we usually
do it, hoping that it will come
back to New York and run for a
while. On the other hand, if we
know a show is going to play
for a long time out of town, we
eliminate ourselves from con
sideration."

The two say they are fortu
nate to be touring together
now in Tom Stoppard and ED
Berman's British American Re
pertory Company (BARC),
which tours lour months in the
U.S. and four months in Bri
tain. Although they agree with
Bernard Shaw's remark that the
United States and Britain are
two countries separated by a
common language, "Berman
and Stoppard, with their prag
matism and intelligence, can
overcome this," Newman said.
Both actors say they find it
miraculous that their produc
ers have transcended the
union problems which so often

preclude the combination of
British and American theatrical
talent. "This company has
come close to paying for it
self," Newman said, "and for a
million-dollar venture, that's
an achievement."
Both also praise Stoppard's
writing. Calling his plays func
tional, three-dimensional, and
intellectually dazzling, Hunt
said, "because his material is
so strong, an actor doesn't
have to juggle and tap dance
and feed it so much."
"If there's anything that
doesn't work in a Stoppard
play, it's because it hasn't been
well-rendered," Newman ad

ded. Performing Stoppard
plays in December at ACT's
Marines' Memorial Theatre,
both did brilliant jobs of bring
ing to life Stoppard's material
which, in less perfect produc
tions, is criticized for super
ficiality.
Newman and Hunt seemed
pleased with BARC, and said
they plan to stay with the com
pany. Afterward, Hunt said,
she hopes to find material
which is as well-constructed as
Stoppard's and which, she
said, unlike most modern
plays, has'a strong story line.
Newman said he sees him
self as best suited for films and

musicals, explaining that "the
huge multiplicity ot disciplines
that go into a musical are excit
ing to me."
Neither he nor his wile seem
troubled by the uncertainty
and transience of the theatrical
life. In Newman's words: "It's
handy if you have a Siamese cat
you can farm out to the rela
tives. We don't have kids, we
sublimate through uir kitty.
We're looking forward to
going to Seattle and spending
Christmas with our darling."
So . . . if you still want to be
an actor, get a cat, a unicycle,
and an education.

matism and intelligence, can
overcome this," Newman said.
Both actors say they find it
miraculous that their produc
ers have transcended the
union problems which so often

preclude the combination of
British and American theatrical
talent. "This company has
come close to paying for it
self," Newman said, "and for a
million-dollar venture, that's
an achievement."
Both also praise Stoppard's
writing. Calling his plays func
tional, three-dimensional, and
intellectually dazzling, Hunt
said, "because his material is
so strong, an actor doesn't
have to juggle and tap dance
and feed it so much."
"If there's anything that
doesn't work in a Stoppard
play, it's because it hasn't been
well-rendered," Newman ad

ded. Performing Stoppard
plays in December at ACT's
Marines' Memorial Theatre,
both did brilliant jobs of bring
ing to life Stoppard's material
which, in less perfect produc
tions, is criticized for super
ficiality.
Newman and Hunt seemed
pleased with BARC, and said
they plan to stay with the com
pany. Afterward, Hunt said,
she hopes to find material
which is as well-constructed as
Stoppard's and which, she
said, unlike most modern
plays, has'a strong story line.
Newman said he sees him
self as best suited for films and

musicals, explaining that "the
huge multiplicity ot disciplines
that go into a musical are excit
ing to me."
Neither he nor his wile seem
troubled by the uncertainty
and transience of the theatrical
life. In Newman's words: "It's
handy if you have a Siamese cat
you can farm out to the rela
tives. We don't have kids, we
sublimate through uir kitty.
We're looking forward to
going to Seattle and spending
Christmas with our darling."
So . . . if you still want to be
an actor, get a cat, a unicycle,
and an education.

Ruth Hunt and Stephen D. Hunt in Stoppard's Macßeth
Admit it: you've always
wanted to be an actor. But
you're scared. . .
Two of 1700 people inter
viewed for the British Ameri
can Repertory Company's 12
slots, Stephen D. Newman and
Ruth Hunt, claim the odds are
at least this bad forevery acting
job in New York. But they don't
seem to be worried.
Since receiving MFAs from
Stanford in the late '60s, the
couple has accumulated im
pressive credentials.
Hunt's blonde, blue
jeaned and entirely unpreten
tious manner belies her broad
dramatic experience. Among
her many appearances are The
Last of Mrs. Cheyney with De
borah Kerr a tour of Jesus
Christ Superstar, Dame Judith
Anderson's Hamlet and televi
sion soap operas.
Her husband, an attractive
Seattle native with a warm
smile and the same approach
able air, won an Obie for his
role in the Chelsea Theatre's
Polly and was voted Best Actor
in the Variety Critic's Poll for
the role of Mac Heath in The
Beggar's Opera. He has ap
peared in such films as Net
work and The Seduction of /oe
Tynan.
Although each has enjoyed
success, both seem to have en
tered the profession realizing
that an actor's life holds few
guarantees. Explaining that liv
ing in New York provides many
job possibilities, Newman said,
"It's part of the blessing and
part of the curse that you're
faced with options every few
weeks.
"Lots of times there are sur
prises in relinquishing de
mands for the exact shape of
your career."
Asked to paint a picture of
the ideal life, Hunt said she
stopped doing this years ago.

She claimed the odds of find
ing a part are much worse for
women than for men, and that
"Men can be less talented and
still have a career."
Sometimes, she explained,
"you can feel unworthy if you
don't happen to be a 5'6"
brunette who can ride a unicy
cle." She said that "the big
problem isn't working, it's
dealing with the time between
jobs, the enforced retire
ments. Education helps to de
velop one's interests and
makes it easier to structure
time off work."
Newman, as well, stressed
the importance of education,
saying an actor shouldn't live
or die just when he's onstage.
He said he regrets not using
Stanford as he might have.
When he was going to school,
he said, "There were some
great professors who brought
an encyclopedic perspective to
the whole current of western
thought."
The couple credited Stan
ford, not only for strong
academic training, but also
with giving them a good artistic
foundation. "When the moti
vation for approval and
applause ends, you think
about developing a craft,"
Newman said. Both were

members of the Stanford Re
pertory Theatre, which in
volved students and profes
sionals in the training and per
forming processes.
"The big problem with
drama schools," Newman said,
"is that they teach people to go
out and teach others. The Stan
ford Rep was more intent on
turning out professionals.
"When you get to New York,
the rehearsal's over. They ex
pect you to do it right."
Both said they rely on each
other for professional criti
cism. Of her husband, Hunt
said, "I've found it helpful to
be around someone with a
practical history in the theater.
It's good to have someone you
trust with a similar vocabulary
who can give you intelligent
feedback."
Asked whether having a
two-career marriage creates a
problem, Newman explained
that a lot of decisions con
stantly need to be made about
professional issues. "If a show
is going out of town, we usually
do it, hoping that it will come
back to New York and run for a
while. On the other hand, if we
know a show is going to play
for a long time out of town, we
eliminate ourselves from con
sideration."

The two say they are fortu
nate to be touring together
now in Tom Stoppard and ED
Berman's British American Re
pertory Company (BARC),
which tours lour months in the
U.S. and four months in Bri
tain. Although they agree with
Bernard Shaw's remark that the
United States and Britain are
two countries separated by a
common language, "Berman
and Stoppard, with their prag
matism and intelligence, can
overcome this," Newman said.
