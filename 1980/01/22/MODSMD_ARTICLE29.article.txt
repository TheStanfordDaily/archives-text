# Flora, Airto: Brazilian artistry on fire
## Jazz musicians 'refreshing intensity' fills concert halls 
### 
Anyone who has ever telt the
energy of a Brazilian "Carna
val" knows where Airto and
Flora Purim are coming from.
They carry with them the spirit
of the samba, performing with
a pulsating fury that is un
equaled by most American jazz
or rock musicians.
Years ago, this husband
and-wife duo from Brazil were
launched into the mainstream
of modern jazz by Chick
Corea. That version of Return
to Forever, with Chick, Flora,
Airto, Stanley Clarke and Joe
Farrell, was, arguably, the most
creative band that Corea as
sembled.
Flora sang the complex, but
melodically rich melodies,
while Airto drove the band
with his fiery work on drums
and percussion. Flora intro
duced Brazilian scat singing
to the modern jazz, creating
a beautiful fusion of the
genres.
After the Return to Forever
disbanded, Flora and Airto to
gether set the American jazz
scene on fire. They brought
raw rhythmic excitement to an
art form that was becoming in
creasingly cerebral and inac
cessible. Audiences devoured
this refreshing intensity, filling
concert halls to capacity and
dancing feverishly to a beat
that isn't easily listened to sit
ting down. Contemporary
music critics joined in a warm

welcome by electing Flora and
Airto to jazz's No. 1 vocalist
and percussion positions sev
eral times in the last seven
years.
Flora, who has spent most of
her life in Rio de Janeiro,
brought to the U.S. the songs
ot Joao Cilberto, Antonio Car
los Jobim, Edu Lobo and
others; songs that she sang
with a softness and romanti
cism not widely heard since
saxophonist Stan Cetz' ven
tures with Astrud Cilberto and
other Brazilians in the '60s and
early '70s.
Flora expanded this Brazilian
idiom by taking these songs
and putting them into a jazz
context, played by jazz musi

cians. Ron Carter, George
Duke, Carlos Santana and Ear!
Klugh, to name a few, have
graced her albums, lending a
rich tlavortothe already strong
music in her repertoire.
In the last few years, Airto
and Flora Purim have pursued
their professions separately.
However, they never seem to
venture too far apart and often
appear as a "special guest" at
each other's shows. When they
play together, though, the
music is at its best.
Here's hoping that the
creativity and imagination of
Flora Purim and Airto help to
make the 1980s a decade worth
listening to.
