# Baker campaign group formed
## 
### Karen Springen 
Eight to 10 people are currently ac
tive in Stanford Republicans for
Baker, a recently formed campus
group supportive of Sen. Howard
Baker's (R-Tenn.) presidential cam
paign, according to group chairman
lames Cable.
An organizational meeting last
Monday brought in three new re
cruits, he added.
Gable, a junior from Kentucky,
who worked in Baker's Washington
office last summer, said that the
major purpose of the group is infor
mational, "especially if the California
primary remains winner-take-all.
Should the efforts of Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) to change
the primary structure fail, Baker
would stand little chance to garner
any California national committee
delegates against home-state favo

rite Ronald Reagan.
"In California, only a small number
of people are for Baker — people
don't even know who he is," Gable
said. "Right now we're just present
ing Baker to students. If Baker does
well in the first couple primaries,
though, we'll get a lot more people,"
he added.
Cable classified Baker as moderate
but right-leaning. Current events are
causing people to reassess their posi
tions, and this trend is "playing right
into the senator's hands," Cable
said. He claimed that Baker is the
most electable Republican because
Reagan, Connally and Bush have not
won an election in the past 10 years.
Regarding fund-raising, Cable
said, "At a university level, we don't
expect to get a lot of money from
students. As the campaign grows, we
will move out of the campus into the

Bay Area.
"At Stanford, people like to know
about issues," Cable continued and
stressed that Baker's positions are
clear and his past need not be con
tinually defended. "We don't have to
dream up his stand or make up for his
past," he said.
In Cable's opinion, there are no
doubts about Baker's integrity.
There's a great temptation to com
pare Baker to the "lackluster Democ
rats," Cable said. Baker "likes to say
he can beat Carter easily, but Ken
nedy would be more fun.'
According to Gable, the organiza
tion has no major sponsors in the
Political Science Department yet.
The Baker group hopes to have an
opinions column printed in the Daily
and tosponsora speaker, Gable said.
The gioup also plans to publish press
releases, he said.
