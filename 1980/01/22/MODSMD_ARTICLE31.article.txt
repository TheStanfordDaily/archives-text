Antique pianos
Margaret Fahrizio will play 18th- and 19th-century music on
two antique pianos in a Music Department concert at 8 p.m.
Saturday in Annenberg Auditorium.
She will perform a C.P.E. Bach "Fantasia," Schubert's "Diver
tissement a la Hongroise," sonatas by jiri Rcnda and Muzio
Clementi, and a set of "carations un piccolo divertimento" by
Haydn.
The music matches the time period of the 1797 Broadwood
Square piano and the 1811 Broadwood grand pianoforte, which
Fahrizio will play. Both instruments belong to the Musit Depart
ment collection.
A faculty member here, Fahrizio will be assisted by graduate
student Jodi Gandolfi. Tickets are available at Tresidder and other
major outlets.
