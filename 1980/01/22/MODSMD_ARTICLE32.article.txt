# Everyone has a ball in Vienna
## The 						black and blue Danube? 
### 
For those who have wor
shiped Heidi, enjoyed yodel
ling out dorm windows or just
dreamed of an enchanting
evening in the Old Country,
with a little imagination ac
companied by the "Blue
Danube Waltz," you can be in
Vienna once a year. At the Vie
nnese Ball.
Saturday's ball was held in
Roble Gym —
nyloned calves and trousered
knees exercise more fervently
than the Olympic team in those
magic hours between eight
and three. Never was so eleg
ant an atmosphere the stage
for the whirlwind of spiking
heels, darting elbows and a
whispered hum of "One, two,
three; one, two, three," as
couples attempted to shed
their rock n roll heritage for
refined waltzing steps.
And steps there were — on
everybody else's feet, over dis
carded goblets, hurdling the
third violinist and around the
dignitaries more refined in
their posture.

But it was evident from the
dreamy smiles, empty glasses
and cheek-to-cheek polkas
that at this ball, people were
having a ball.
Dance lessons were offered
the week before and, perhaps,
next year more people will take
advantage of them. The dance
floor was a chaotic cross bet
ween the bumper-cars at
Knotts Berry Farm and the of
fensive strategy displayed by
Pittsburgh: tux tails and taffeta,
frenzied tripping or cutting a
few successful turns to the ex
cellent tunes of the Stanford
Pops Orchestra, finding their
way amid the collision course
of formal gowns and bouton
nieres.
For those not courageous
enough to risk their toes and
reputations on the waltzing
merry-go-round, the Stanford
)azz Ensemble blasted out old
favorites from the Big Band Era
for the closet flappers and vet
erans of the you-twirl-me-l'll
clutch-your-hand techniques.

Here, the circular adaptation of
the Malibu Raceway was aban
doned for swing, fox-trot, tango
and unclassified gyrations on a
well-waxed floor.
At midnight, 10 students
wearing authentic
performed Austrian folk
dances. Their dancing was
complicated, the energy con
tagious and after the finale the
entire group joined in a mass
polka led by the more experi
enced performers.
The wait? experienced its in
fancy in the environs of Vie
nna, played by small groups in
the inns near the Vienna
Woods. The exciting vogue
flourished due to musical ta
lent of Johann Strauss and his
son, ]ohann )r., explained the

ball program.
It is fortunate that the return
ing students from Vienna in
1977 were carried away by this
"vogue" for the ball has been a
popular event here for the past
three years. Anyone doubting
its appeal should try to purch
ase tickets the week before or
watch ex-fullbacks "one, two,
threeing" to the delicate music
of the orchestra.
This year's dance was dedi
cated to Frau Hedwig Thiming,
associate director of the Uni
versity campus in Vienna. Ac
cording to Paul Eisler, consul
general of Austria, the ball "is
the best thing outside of Vie
nna."
