USOC will follow Carter's lead
U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) President
Robert Kane indicated yesterday that if all other
suggested alternatives fail, the USOC would yield
to a call by President Jimmy Carter for a boycott of
this summer's Moscow Olympics.
"We're just as conscious of the national interest
as President Carter and his staff," Kane said in a
telephone interview from his offices in Ithaca,
N.Y.
As for suggestions from White Ffouse counsel
Lloyd Cutler that the Carter administration might
take passport or financial action to prevent an
American team from going to Moscow if the U.S.
Committee defied the president's wishes, Kane
said, "I don't imagine that we'd ever reach such a
contingency."
But Kane said that since Carter has set a Feb. 20
deadline tor a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan
before any boycott could be formally called for,
and since the International Olympic Committee
will have an opportunity before then to consider
such Carter-proposed alternatives as moving the
Games, he thinks it is premature to decide the
boycott quesition now.
Elsewhere, the private Olympic committees of a
number of Western European countries forcefully
expressed themselves against a boycott of the
Moscow Games, but government reaction in some
of the same countries was uncommitted pending
further developments.
U.S. revokes Soviet trade license
Washington — The United States yesterday
further escalated its economic and military re
sponses to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by
revoking export licenses for computer parts used
in the Soviet Union's largest truck plant and by
sending B-52 bombers on a flight over Soviet ships
in the Indian Ocean.
Although the revocation order involves exports
worth only $80,000, Commerce officials said denial
of the parts, used in manufacturing and payroll
lunctions, was intended to hurt production at the
Soviet Kama River complex. Building of the Kama
complex from 1971 to 1975 involved $355 million in
U.S. equipment and technology, roughly 12 per
cent of the project's total cost.
"The original license for the Kama River was
granted in 1975 under conditions significantly dif
ferent from those which exist now," said Com
merce Secretary Philip Klutznick.
"I have not concluded and this revocation does
not suggest that the original issuance of the
license was inappropriate under the overall condi
tions which existed in 1975. . . . Obviously condi
tions have changed."
Afghan invasion worries Iranians
Tehran — The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
is a "danger" to Iran, Iranian authorities are saying
after three weeks of silence following their initial
condemnation of the Soviet action.
The Council of the Revolution devoted part of its
Sunday meeting to the problems posed by the
aftermath of the Kabul coup, and Foreign Minister
Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said the presence of
"foreign" troops in Afghanistan "poses a major
threat" to the Iranian province of Baluchistan va
Sistan.
"Iran," he added, "cannot accept this danger
that imperils our frontiers."
Ghotbzadeh hinted that the Soviet intervention
would give Washington a pretext to intervene in
Pakistan, and he warned, "We shall combat any
such plan."
Economy Minister Abdlhassan Bani-Sadr said
yesterday that the Soviet "danger" should incite

"peoples threatened by the superpowers" to get
together and obtain assurance that Moscow will
not intervene militarily in other countries.
As an upshot of this unexpected stance, Iran will
send a representative to the Islamic foreign minis
ters' conference opening Saturday in Islamabad,
Pakistan.
Carter delays aid to Pakistan
Washington — The Carter administration has
yielded to a request from Pakistan to delay formal
announcement of a $400 million economic and
military aid program to that country until after <t
conference of Islamic nations next weekend in
Islamabad, officials said yesterday.
Late last week, White House and State Depart
ment spokesmen said the administration would
press for quick congressional approval of the pac
kage, which Pakistan's president, Gen. Moham
med /ia ul-Haq, denounced as "peanuts" after
details of the two-year program were published in
the United States.
In a related matter, officials confirmed that the
administration is proposing a six-year military aid
commitment to Egypt that will extend into 1986,
include advanced F-16 fighter-bombers and total
$4.35 billion in military sales credits over that
period.
Officials said the decision to delay the Pakistan
aid package for a week or two came because /ia
had complained that excessive publicity regarding
the U.S. plan might undercut his hopes for garner
ing vastly larger amounts of aid from Saudi Arabia
and other Arab oil states.
Safeway hit by clerks strike
San Francisco — Two supermarket chains signed
last minute "interim" agreements with a striking
grocery clerks union, leaving Safeway, the largest
market chain in the West, as the only one initially
■ lit by a strike yesterday.
In response to the strike, the Food Employers
Council yesterday ordered a lockout of clerks at
unaffected stores in eight Northern California
counties.
John Bacon, spokesman for the council which
represents supermarkets, called the lockout a
"defensive" move designed to let the union know
that "a strike against one company or a limited
group of companies will be considered a strike
against the entire group of employers."
Cala Foods yesterday morning signed an agree
ment with the United Food and Commercial
Workers Union similar to one signed Sunday night
by Fry's. Both chains agreed to abide by any final
contract worked out between the union and the
food industry, according to union spokesman,
David Celman.
Yesterday pickets went up at 145 Safeway stores
in the eight counties, and the Teamsters union
announced it would honor the picket lines, raising
questions about the stores' ability to maintain
stocks of food and other products.
Kabul starts stronger resistance
Kabul, Afghanistan — Kabul residents who have
been passively resisting the massive Soviet military
presence here appeared to be moving toward
more active forms of resistance, foreign corres
pondents have observed.
More frequent distribution of anti-Soviet
brochures perhaps has made it easier for Kabul
residents to express openly their resentment over
the Soviet intervention.
These brochures, known as "night letters," by
Kabul residents because the brochures are slipped
under doors during the night, are a new
phenomenon here, foreign residents said.

Brochure distributors risk breaking the curfew and
being spotted by Soviet patrols.
Apparently written by university professors and
intellectuals, these brochures take a relatively
moderate view of the late President Nur Moham
med Taraki's government, ousted in a coup last
September, but attack the regime of recently de
posed President Hafizullah Amin and totally reject
the regime of current Soviet-backed leader Babrak
Karmal as well as the Soviet intervention.
124 feared dead in Iran air crash
Kuwait — An Iran Air Boeing 727 carrying 124
persons crashed yesterday while approaching
Tehran on a flight from Mashhad, Tehran Radio
reported.
In a broadcast monitored here, Iran's official
Pars news agency said search teams found the
burning wreckage of the three-jet craft in heavy
fog and deep snow in mountainous terrain 18
miles north of Tehran.
The report said six bodies were recovered, no
survivors were found, and poor weather was ham
pering search operations. There were no reports
of any foreigners aboard the craft, and it was be
lieved most of the passengers were Moslem pil
grims returning to Tehran from a visit to shrines in
the holy city of Mashhad, about 500 miles to the
east. The plane had a crew of eight, according to
the broadcasts.
DC-8 lands safe after bomb threat
Colorado Springs, Colo. — A United Airlines DC-8
en route from San Diego to Honolulu landed
safely yesterday after an extortionist said there was
an explosive device aboard the plane, law en
forcement officials said.
When bomb experts from Fort Carson examined
the contents of the cigar-box size container, found
in a rear lavatory of the plane, they found only
wooden dowels covered with wrapping paper
from real dynamite, said Col. Earl Burley, chief
information officer for the nearby Army base.
The sticks were wired to a real timing device and
batteries, Burley said.
The pilot of Flight 199 found the suspect box in
the lavatory after the first of several anonymous
calls to United headquarters in Los Angeles, Un
ited spokesman Irv Cuevas said in Los Angeles.
Cuevas said the caller demanded "a large sum of
money" and warned that the purported bomb
would detonate if the plane dropped to an altitute
below 5000 feet.
The plane was diverted to Colorado Springs
Municipal Airport because it is the highest airport
in the United States at 6172 feet, said Don Can
nalte, a United spokesman from the airline's reg
ional office in Denver.
Dow Jones reaches new highs
New York — The stock market's early-1980 rally

oil and aerospace issues.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed
5.63 to 872.78, its highest level since last October.
In the first three weeks of 1980 the average has
risen 34-04 points.
