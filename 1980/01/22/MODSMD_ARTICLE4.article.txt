The Los Angeles Times
Des Moines, lowa â€” President
Jimmy Carter scored a smashing vic
tory over Sen. Edward Kennedy last
night in the lowa caucuses, a contest
Kennedy once described as "the first
real test" of his challenge for the
Democratic nomination.
With 70 percent of the state's 2531
precincts reporting, Carter had 59.1
percent of the vote to 31.8 percent
for Kennedy, a margin of nearly
2-to-1 in the contest to select lowa's
50-member delegation to the Demo
cratic National Convention. Un
committed had 9 percent and

California Gov. Jerry Brown had less
than one percent.
In the GOP race, George Bush es
tablished the campaign vulnerability
of Ronald Reagan by stunning the
presumed GOP frontrunner with a
strong race in the lowa precinct cau
cuses.
An estimated 100,000 lowa Repub
licans turned out across the
state in clear but cold weather to
maKe known their preferences for
president.
With 29 percent of the state's 2531
precincts reporting, Bush had 33
percent of the vote to 29 percent for
Reagan. Tennessee's Sen. Howard
Baker was a distant third with 15 per
cent, followed by John Connally with
9 percent, Illinois Rep. Philip Crane
with 7 percent, Illinois Rep. John An
derson with 4 percent and Kansas
Sen. Robert Dole with 1 percent.
Bush said he was "ecstatic" with
his showing and described the vote
as "a victory no matter what the final
results are. . . I've won, no question
about it."
Aides to Reagan, who began his
entertainment career as a sportscas
ter on Des Moines radio station
WHO in the 19305, said the toimer
California governor would not have a

statement on the results until today.
Carter jumped off to a huge lead in
the early count, and even his own
strategists appeared surprised by the
extent of his victory.
Kennedy forces seemed even
more stunned. The Massachusetts
Democrat had said that Carter would
have to get at least 50 percent of the
vote in the state for any success to be
considered significant. Kennedy evi
dently considered this figure beyond
the president's reach, but in fact Car
ter was exceeding it last night.
At "Carter Command," the
election-night headquarters estab
lished by the president's forces on
the third floor of the Savery Hotel,
aides reported that the incumbent
was defeating the senator even in the
urban areasof the state that had been
considered Kennedy strongholds.
At Kennedy's headquarters, Paul
Tully, the senator's state coor
dinator, acknowledged that his can
didate had been swamped by a "tidal
wave" of votes.
Tully blamed the relatively heavy
turnout of an estimated 100,000 lowa
Democrats, which appeared to be
running about twice that of the 8 per
cent of registered voters reported in
1976, for the extent of Kennedy's de
feat.
