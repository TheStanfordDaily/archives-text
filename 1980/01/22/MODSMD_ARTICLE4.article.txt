The Los Angeles Times
Des Moines, lowa â€” President
Jimmy Carter scored a smashing vic
tory over Sen. Edward Kennedy last
night in the lowa caucuses, a contest
Kennedy once described as "the first
real test" of his challenge for the
Democratic nomination.
With 70 percent of the state's 2531
precincts reporting, Carter had 59.1
percent of the vote to 31.8 percent
for Kennedy, a margin of nearly
2-to-1 in the contest to select lowa's
50-member delegation to the Demo
cratic National Convention. Un
committed had 9 percent and

California Gov. Jerry Brown had less
than one percent.
In the GOP race, George Bush es
tablished the campaign vulnerability
of Ronald Reagan by stunning the
presumed GOP frontrunner with a
strong race in the lowa precinct cau
cuses.
An estimated 100,000 lowa Repub
licans turned out across the
state in clear but cold weather to
maKe known their preferences for
president.
With 29 percent of the state's 2531
precincts reporting, Bush had 33
percent of the vote to 29 percent for
Reagan. Tennessee's Sen. Howard
Baker was a distant third with 15 per
cent, followed by John Connally with
9 percent, Illinois Rep. Philip Crane
with 7 percent, Illinois Rep. John An
derson with 4 percent and Kansas
Sen. Robert Dole with 1 percent.
Bush said he was "ecstatic" with
his showing and described the vote
as "a victory no matter what the final
results are. . . I've won, no question
about it."
Aides to Reagan, who began his
entertainment career as a sportscas
ter on Des Moines radio station
WHO in the 19305, said the toimer
California governor would not have a

statement on the results until today.
Carter jumped off to a huge lead in
the early count, and even his own
strategists appeared surprised by the
extent of his victory.
Kennedy forces seemed even
more stunned. The Massachusetts
Democrat had said that Carter would
have to get at least 50 percent of the
vote in the state for any success to be
considered significant. Kennedy evi
dently considered this figure beyond
the president's reach, but in fact Car
ter was exceeding it last night.
At "Carter Command," the
election-night headquarters estab
lished by the president's forces on
the third floor of the Savery Hotel,
aides reported that the incumbent
was defeating the senator even in the
urban areasof the state that had been
considered Kennedy strongholds.
At Kennedy's headquarters, Paul
Tully, the senator's state coor
dinator, acknowledged that his can
didate had been swamped by a "tidal
wave" of votes.
Tully blamed the relatively heavy
turnout of an estimated 100,000 lowa
Democrats, which appeared to be
running about twice that of the 8 per
cent of registered voters reported in
1976, for the extent of Kennedy's de
feat.
Kennedy watched the returns with
his family from his national campaign
headquarters in Washington. "Well,
we could have done a little better in
lowa," he acknowledged to cheering
supporters.
The senator vowed to continue his
fight against Carter. Sources within
the campaign, however, said that
Kennedy already was suffering from
financial difficulties.
In a statement released by the
White House, Carter said he deeply
appreciated "the vote of confidence
from lowa Democrats. Their expres
sion of support is particularly wel
come in these times."
Carter campaign chairman Robert
Strauss, in a Des Moines victory
statement, referred to the presi
dent's controversial decision to em
bargo grain sales to the Soviet Union
in reprisal to the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan.
"This result tonight in lowa does
show one thing," Strauss said, "that

a president who has character can
make hard, tough, even unpopular
decisions and people will stay be
hind him."
Although Carter did not campaign
here personally, he was well rep
resented by surrogates including
Vice President Walter Mondale and
members of his Cabinet and family.
And the president was able to domi
nate the news because of the crises
in Iran and Afghanistan and his ac
tions in response to them.
Kennedy campaigned intensively
here, traveling more than 6000 miles
and visiting all of lowa's big cities and
many of its small towns. His efforts
gave his organization a lift, but the
senator could not stem a steady de
cline in the polls.
The COP voting was considerably
less complicated than the process
used by the Democrats. It involved
only a quick straw poll of those at
tending the caucuses and did not
legally bind the delegates chosen for
county conventions, the next step
toward choosing lowa's 37 delegates
to the Republican National Conven
tion in Detroit. There will be a total of
1994 delegates at the convention.
Nevertheless, the caucuses
marked the first solid test of power
for the Republican candidates.
Reagan started out as the odds-on
favorite but came under some in
tense criticism in the last few weeks
for failing to do more personal cam
paigning in the state and for not par
ticipating in a ]an. 5 debate among
the COP candidates sponsored by
the Des Moines Register and
Tribune.
He made six campaign swings into
lowa but spent a total of only about
41 hours here. On a final hopscotch
from Mason City to Fort Dodge to
Des Moines Saturday, he said he
would be satisfied to get "one more
vote than anyone else."
Bush, on the other hand, cam
paigned 31 days in the state and
mounted an aggressive organiza
tional effort in all 99 counties to get
his supporters to the caucuses and
establish himself as the No. 1 chal
lenger to Reagan.
