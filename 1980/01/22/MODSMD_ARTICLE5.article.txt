# 'Brethren' reveals 'horsetrading of justices
## Douglas: his colleagues, friends 
### Joan O'Connell 
Although William O. Douglas was
perhaps the greatest defender of the
hirst Amendment in the history of the
Supreme Court, he, like the other
justices with whom he served, har
bored a mistrust of the press and the
right of the people to be privy to the
Court's inner working.
This according to Stanford Law
Professor William Cohen, who
served as Douglas' law clerk for the
1956-57 court session and who re
cently reminisced about Douglas' life
and impact on American law.
"Every justice of the Supreme
Court when I clerked felt very
strongly that the court's internal
workings were confidential.
Washington is a hot bed of rumors.
We were all very careful not to dis
cuss court business outside the
court," Cohen declared.
Indeed, court business has re
cently been brought outside the
court with the publication of Bob
Woodward and Scott Armstrong's
The Brethren. Cohen's opinion of the
book is that it is only "a partial story."
Although Cohen considers much of
the information provided by law
clerks for The Brethren to constitute
a "breach of confidence — much like
a lawyer discussing the confidences
of his clients," he was impressed
with the fact that "with a few excep
tions, even the clerks who had very
tough years were very loyal to Doug
las," he said.
Loyalty evident
Cohen is certainly loyal to Doug
las. He has a portrait of the former
justice on the wall of his office and,
while not considering him a "close

friend," had kept in contact with the
late justice over the past 23 years, last
seeing him at a law clerks' reunion in
Los Angeles in 1973.
The Brethren focuses on the court
terms from 1969 through 1975, the
year that Douglas, who had served
on the court for 36 years — longer
than any other man — was forced to
retire because of a stroke. It paints a
rather pathetic portrait of the 76-
year-old Douglas as he struggled to
retain his position on the court while
the other justices gradually phased
him out.
Cohen, however, denies the im
plications of some who attribute
Douglas' struggle to an unwilling
ness to give up power.
"Anyone who knew Douglas
would never think that," said Cohen.
"His whole life consisted of meeting
and overcoming obstacles. He was
the poor boy from Walla Walla,
Washington ... he had polio as a
child ... he struggled through Col
umbia Law School." Unfortuantely
the stroke proved to be the one obs
tacle hecould not conquerand even
tually forced his resignation, Cohen
said.
Effect on Court
The impact of Douglas' resignation
from the Burger court was primarily
"one less liberal vote." The biggest
change, in Cohen's opinion, being
the ascension of Warren Burger to
the Chief lustice chair.
Yet, since 1975, Cohen noted that
"there always was a problem with the
Court being composed of nine sepa
rate law firms and, it's probably a lot
worse now."
As a general observation pertain

ing to The Brethren, Cohen noted,
"What's interesting is that some
people purport to be shocked by the
horsetrading that goes on. The fact is
that there isn't enough of that. Their
decisions are fragmented, not reli
able, puzzling. In many cases there is
no majority opinion. There are high
court opinions with positions so nar
row they don't even look alike," he
said.
Personal connections
Horsetrading is definitely a fea
tured aspect of The Brethren, and
Cohen discussed the relationships of
Justice Douglas with his fellow jus
tices.
Douglas' closest ally on the Court
was Justice Hugo Black, but his per
sonal ties were often strong with per
sons to whom he was ideologically
opposed. According to Cohen,
Douglas got along very well with Jus
tices Tom Clark and William Re
hnquist, both conservatives.
Douglas was also very close to and
had a great respect for former Chief
Justice Earl Warren, said Cohen.
Warren change
"If you read back on Warren's de
cisions for the first few years, the
school segregation case aside, they
were ideologically like Justice (Felix)
Frankfurter's. Starting with some
where around 1955-56, all of a sud
den he started voting with Douglas
and Black. Something happened,"
Cohen said.
Douglas felt "contempt" for War
ren's archconservative successor,
Warren Burger, a Nixon-appointee.
He felt similarly about Gerald Ford
who, as minority leader of the House
