# SLAC accelerator nears finish, competition intensifies

### Mac Funk 
Physicists at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), well
known as a leading research insti
tute for elementary particle
physics, are in hot pursuit of a
new breakthrough in the com
petitive world of international sci
entific research.
Last November, work began on
the installation of a new and
highly significant project at SLAC:
the Positron-Electron Project
(PEP). According to Doug Dupen,
director ot personnel and
laboratory relations at SLAC, the
project is still in the final installa
tion and check-out phase and is
due for completion sometime
within the next few months.
However, the physicists at SLAC
are not calmly awaiting the initial
fire-up date. They know that every
day is crucial in the race to be
come the first laboratory world
wide to crack some of the funda
mental secrets of the nature of
physical matter.
In Hamburg, West Germany,
scientists at a project similar to
PEP, called PETRA, provide the di
rect competition for the Ameri
cans in the field of particle
physics. Both accelerators are de
vices used to send charged parti
cles colliding into one another at
such high speeds that they will

break up into even smaller frag
ments of matter, which are
thought to comprise the most
basic elements of the universe.
These particles are called
quarks, a term taken from lames
loyce's Finnegan's Wake, and so
far five of these objects have been
found. Both PETRA and PEP are on
the verge of discovering the sixth
quark, which is deemed "the
most sought-after prize" in the
field of high-energy physics by
John Rees, director of PEP.
SLAC edge
The key at this point may be the
amount of power available to
generate these collisions; thus,
the fact that PEP is slightly more
powerful than PETRA may be the
factor that will allow the Ameri
cans to be the eventual victors in
the race.
The stakes are high. SLAC
physicist Burton Richter shared
the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics for
his discovery of the fourth quark,
the psi-| particle. A Nobel Prize
could well be awarded to the
physicists who are the first to
identify quark No. 6. Further
more, the quark search is a matter
of national pride, Rees said.
The competition, however, is
congenial and collaborative, ac
cording to Dupen. "It's always fun
to be first," said Dupen, but he

also acknowledged that the Ger
mans and Americans keep no sec
rets from each other. The coun
tries are happy to share know
ledge with each other for the
long-range benefits of increased
knowledge in the field, he said.
Soviet cooperation
In fact, according to Don Goetz,
assistant director of PEP, the field
of high-energy physics is one in
which extensive collaboration has
occurred between the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R. The main reason for
this cooperation, said Coetz, is
that the field is such a relatively
new one that very limited im
mediate applications can be
gleaned from new discoveries.
Scientists are now working at
the "forefront of ignorance,"
Dupen said, and any knowledge
that one team of scientists esti
mates as useful is shared with
other scientists in the field.
Such pure scientific research is
not questionable in terms of its
long-range worth, Dupen noted.
"History shows that all research
ends up being applicable a gener
ation or two down the line," he
said.
Government money necessary
Lacking immediate practical
application, research of the sort
undertaken at SLAC is unattrac
tive to most scientific corpora

tions and is, therefore, highly de
pendent on government funding
for support.
Overall, the federal govern
ment provides about $300 million
per year for the construction and
operation of accelerators, such as
SLAC, at four American
laboratories. That figure, accord
ing to SLAC physicists, nonethe
less pales in comparison with the
$1 billion allocated to the Viking
search for life on Mars.
Congress initially authorized
$78 million for PEP to be spread
out over several years in the an
nual budget of the Department of
Energy (DOE). Yet, since Con
gress approves an arbitrary prop
ortion of that total allotment in a
separate operating budget each
year, scientists here said they fear
that the funding may fall short of
the laboratory needs in any given
year.
Little relative support
Moreover, the U.S. govern
ment tends to provide less sup
port for laboratories like SLAC
than do the governments of other
countries, Goetz said. Thus, it is
increasingly difficult for American
scientists to keep abreast of their
foreign competition.
The shortfall of government
subsidy may also jeopardize

particle physics.
