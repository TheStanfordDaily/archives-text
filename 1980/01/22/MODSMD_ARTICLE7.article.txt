# Yogurt culture grows
## 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
On a recent Saturday at a swank market in
Encino, Calif., normally sedate matrons, lul
led by the ennui of food shopping, suddenly
grew obstreperous when they confronted an
empty section in the dairy case. Spying a
stockboy restocking the case with Yoplait
yogurt cups, the women rushed up and
began grabbing the cartons.
"People panic during a crisis. Earthquakes,
threakof war, they go crazy and stock up on
food," the market's manager said, "But for
yogurt, I just don't understand it."
That same Saturday, a bevy of fashionable
young women converged on an I. Magnin
store in the San Fernando Valley and doled
out $29 each for a sweatshirt emblazoned
with a carton of blueberry yogurt and the
brand name "Dannon."
"I can't imagine why they want to spend
that much to advertise my product," Juan
Metzger, the 62-year-old founder and chair
man of New York-based Dannon Milk Pro
ducts. "But of course I think its's wonderful."
What has fired up these ladies? A mania for
Yoplait and Dannon, two brand-name
yogurts about which a mystique has formed,
and which have been available in Los Angeles
for only six months. The fealty of these Yop
lait and Dannon consumers can only be
compared to the kind of devotion com
manded by other special brands like Coors
beer and Levi Strauss bluejeans.
Not that othei yogurts have not been avail
able in California for a long time — they have.
But the market leader, Los Angeles-based
Knudsen Corp. — with a commanding 40
percent of the Southern California market —
came under attack last summer when the two
international food giants whose subsidiaries
manufacture Yoplait and Dannon invaded its
home turf.
The result: a multimillion dollar advertis
ing and marketing war has broken out to win
the hearts and minds of yogurt eaters. Al
though Californians spent only $60 million on
yogurt last year, that figure is ballooning. The
New York-based marketing firm of Frost &
Sullivan estimates that national sales of
yogurt will double to nearly $790 million dur
ing the decade ended 1986, and a big chunk
of that will be sold in California. Thus
Knudsen — the dairy and food company
ranked No. 62 on the Los Angeles Times ros
ter of California's top 100 industrials (1979
sales estimates at more than $330 million) —
has been jolted out of its comfortable posi
tion and forced to defend itself. On the attack

are Minneapolis-based General Mills Co.
(1979 sales $3.7 billion), which manufactures
Yoplait on license ffom the French company
Yoplait, and Chicago-based Beatrice Foods
Corp. (1979 sales $7.5 billion), which owns
Dannon.
Ayogurtwarwould havebeen unheardofa
decade ago when yogurt was only eaten in
this country by health food faddists.
Basically, yogurt is fermented milk into
which Lactobacillus bulgaricus and other
"friendly" bacteria cultures have been intro
duced. The milk then uniformally thickens to
a fine, smooth consistency.
The popularity of yogurt in Western society
can be traced to the research of Dr. Ilya
Metchnikoff, head of the Pasteur Institute of
Paris during the 1890s.
After studying the role of yogurt in the
diets of the Balkans, most of whom lived well
into their 80s and 90s, Metchnikoff con
cluded that eating yogurt would prolong a
person's life.
The European love affair with yogurt that
hit after Metchnikoff's report was released
has lasted through today. The per capita con
sumption of yogurt in West Germany is 10.34
pounds a year. In Switzerland, it's 21.55
pounds and in the Netherlands it's almost 30
pounds a year.
Yogurt consumption in the United States,
2.35 pounds per person according to Frost
and Sullivan, is comparatively low and one
reason yogurt producers believe there is a lot
of room for expansion.
Fhe first volleys in the Southern California
yogurt war were fired last spring when Knud
sen, acting on advance intelligence, intro
duced a newfruit-on-the-bottom yogurt. The
objective: to torpedo the yogurt-and-fruit
Yoplait before it had a chance to enter the
market.
"Knudsen had to set up a defense of its
major position in order to protect it," said
Alan H. Lewis, corporate marketing manager
of Knudsen. Lewis, along with yogurt pro
duct manager Loudin Beam, was hired away
from another big food company last year
especially to coordinate Knudsen's yogurt
battle.
To establish a defense, Knudsen kicked off
a series of commercials based on the theme
"You know what you need — We know what
you like." This basic theme will run through
all Knudsen advertisements, with the latest
ad containing subliminal jabs at the two new
challengers in the yogurt market.

The result: a multimillion dollar advertis
ing and marketing war has broken out to win
the hearts and minds of yogurt eaters. Al
though Californians spent only $60 million on
yogurt last year, that figure is ballooning. The
New York-based marketing firm of Frost &
Sullivan estimates that national sales of
yogurt will double to nearly $790 million dur
ing the decade ended 1986, and a big chunk
of that will be sold in California. Thus
Knudsen — the dairy and food company
ranked No. 62 on the Los Angeles Times ros
ter of California's top 100 industrials (1979
sales estimates at more than $330 million) —
has been jolted out of its comfortable posi
tion and forced to defend itself. On the attack

are Minneapolis-based General Mills Co.
(1979 sales $3.7 billion), which manufactures
Yoplait on license ffom the French company
Yoplait, and Chicago-based Beatrice Foods
Corp. (1979 sales $7.5 billion), which owns
Dannon.

decade ago when yogurt was only eaten in
this country by health food faddists.
Basically, yogurt is fermented milk into
which Lactobacillus bulgaricus and other
"friendly" bacteria cultures have been intro
duced. The milk then uniformally thickens to
a fine, smooth consistency.
The popularity of yogurt in Western society
can be traced to the research of Dr. Ilya
Metchnikoff, head of the Pasteur Institute of
Paris during the 1890s.
After studying the role of yogurt in the
diets of the Balkans, most of whom lived well
into their 80s and 90s, Metchnikoff con
cluded that eating yogurt would prolong a
person's life.
The European love affair with yogurt that
hit after Metchnikoff's report was released
has lasted through today. The per capita con
sumption of yogurt in West Germany is 10.34
pounds a year. In Switzerland, it's 21.55
pounds and in the Netherlands it's almost 30
pounds a year.
Yogurt consumption in the United States,
2.35 pounds per person according to Frost
and Sullivan, is comparatively low and one
reason yogurt producers believe there is a lot
of room for expansion.
Fhe first volleys in the Southern California
yogurt war were fired last spring when Knud
sen, acting on advance intelligence, intro
duced a newfruit-on-the-bottom yogurt. The
objective: to torpedo the yogurt-and-fruit
Yoplait before it had a chance to enter the
market.
"Knudsen had to set up a defense of its
major position in order to protect it," said
Alan H. Lewis, corporate marketing manager
of Knudsen. Lewis, along with yogurt pro
duct manager Loudin Beam, was hired away
from another big food company last year
especially to coordinate Knudsen's yogurt
battle.
To establish a defense, Knudsen kicked off
a series of commercials based on the theme
"You know what you need — We know what
you like." This basic theme will run through
all Knudsen advertisements, with the latest
ad containing subliminal jabs at the two new
challengers in the yogurt market.
The Los Angeles Times
On a recent Saturday at a swank market in
Encino, Calif., normally sedate matrons, lul
led by the ennui of food shopping, suddenly
grew obstreperous when they confronted an
empty section in the dairy case. Spying a
stockboy restocking the case with Yoplait
yogurt cups, the women rushed up and
began grabbing the cartons.
"People panic during a crisis. Earthquakes,
threakof war, they go crazy and stock up on
food," the market's manager said, "But for
yogurt, I just don't understand it."
That same Saturday, a bevy of fashionable
young women converged on an I. Magnin
store in the San Fernando Valley and doled
out $29 each for a sweatshirt emblazoned
with a carton of blueberry yogurt and the
brand name "Dannon."
"I can't imagine why they want to spend
that much to advertise my product," Juan
Metzger, the 62-year-old founder and chair
man of New York-based Dannon Milk Pro
ducts. "But of course I think its's wonderful."
What has fired up these ladies? A mania for
Yoplait and Dannon, two brand-name
yogurts about which a mystique has formed,
and which have been available in Los Angeles
for only six months. The fealty of these Yop
lait and Dannon consumers can only be
compared to the kind of devotion com
manded by other special brands like Coors
beer and Levi Strauss bluejeans.
Not that othei yogurts have not been avail
able in California for a long time — they have.
But the market leader, Los Angeles-based
Knudsen Corp. — with a commanding 40
percent of the Southern California market —
came under attack last summer when the two
international food giants whose subsidiaries
manufacture Yoplait and Dannon invaded its
home turf.
