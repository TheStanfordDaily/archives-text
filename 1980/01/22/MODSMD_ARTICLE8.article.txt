A "Musicand Madness" pre
sentation here last Thursday
featured a lecture on the life of
early 19th century German
composer Robert Schumann
and the performance of his
Davidsbundler Dances, opus
six. The development of
Schumann's madness and its
expression in music were the
subject of the event, spon
sored by Psychology Prof.
Philip Zimbardo in conjunction
with his "Perspectives in Mad
ness" class.
Zimbardo began the pro
gram with a slide presentation

of madness and art. He then
introduced two speakers from
San Francisco to the audience
of 200 in Annenberg Au
ditorium.
Schumann in many respects
had a double personality, ac
cording to Peter Ostwald, pro
fessor of psychiatry at the
UC-San Francisco School of
Medicine.
He was torn early between
music and literature and was
encouraged by his father, who

was a publisher and booksel
ler, to become a writer. "In his
own day," said Ostwald, "he
was thought of equally as
highly as a journalist."
Schumann was sent as a
child to live with a neighbor,
noted the Berkeley professor,
and became confused about
who his mother was and lacked
a self-identity. "Often he cried,
was very lonely, and felt iso
lated; he was lost," he added.
In his frustration, Schumann

would sing to himself and play
act with friends. He found an
outlet for fantasy in the piano,
said Ostwald, and "had a mar
velous talent for portraying
moods, scenes and people in
tunes."
When Schumann was 16 his
father died, his sister Emilie
committed suicide, and his
prospective music teacher
died. This left him "no one to
turn to, no one to attach him
self to," said Ostwald.
Schumann soon met a
psychiatrist who was the hus
band of a playing partner. After
spending time with this man,
the composer "began to de
scribe himself as someonewho
was on the verge ot madness,"
Ostwald said. Schumann
feared killing himself and
asked in his journal, "What
would happen if you could no
longer think?"
Frau Schumann, his mother,
decided that her son should
become a lawyer. Schumann
was sent to the University of
Leipzig to study law but pre
ferred to spend his time com
posing and later left the
school.
Schumann's hopes of be
coming a virtuoso were shat
tered after he experimented
with a finger stretching device.
The tendons of his right hand
were damaged by this device,
and the remedy prescribed by
a doctor was to immerse the
hand in the blood of a freshly
killed ox. According to
Ostwald, Schumann thought
this was "not the most elegant
kind of treatment," nor was it
effective.
Despair and anger contri-

buted to the composer's
breakdown and attempted
suicide at the age of 23.
Ostwald said that Schuman
would lose consciousness and
his face would flush.
Schumann wrote "I am hardly
more than a statue, without
coldness or warmth . . .lam so
fearful and shy that I cannot
sleep alone."
Paul Hersch, instructorat the
San Francisco Conservatory of
Music, said Schumann used

music " as a kind of therapy."
After his speech, Hersch
played pieces by Schumann
that he said reveal "mood and
certain kinds ot energy that re
flect the development of the
personality." Some selections
Hersch claimed show "fury
and power," whileanotherwas
described as "almost clow
nish." He said the music has
"strong biographical over
tones."
Schumann used two
pseudonyms, Florestan and
Eusebius, to sign articles he
wrote for a publication. Each
name represented a distinct
part of the composer's person
ality, according to Hersch. This
personality split influenced
Schumann's musical works.
(Hersch played an excerpt
from the Davidsbundler in
order to illustrate to the differ
ence in these parts of
Schumann's personality.)
Florestan was a heroic
character, violent, aggressive
and manly, the impish person
he sometimes wished to be.
Hersch described him as "wild
sounding."
Eusebius, the feminine, pas
sive and sad figure who most
often was like the quiet and
thoughtful Schumann in real
life was described as sounding
"extremely beautiful."
Hersch said the Davidsbun
dler revealed "the terror of the
split" and records a fight bet
ween the two imaginary per
sonalities. After the battle
Eusebius "sounds like some
how they made a man out of
him," he added.
Ostwald said that Schumann
had probably not consciously

written his conflicts into his
music but that they were there
as the result of "an inner logic
related to the life experiences
he'd had earlier."
Hersch received a standing
ovation from the audience for
his performance of the
Davidsbundler. The composi
tion depicted the conflict with
Schumann that later contri
buted to his mental illness and
death in an asylum at the age of
46.

nish." He said the music has
"strong biographical over
tones."
Schumann used two
pseudonyms, Florestan and
Eusebius, to sign articles he
wrote for a publication. Each
name represented a distinct
part of the composer's person
ality, according to Hersch. This
personality split influenced
Schumann's musical works.
(Hersch played an excerpt
from the Davidsbundler in
order to illustrate to the differ
ence in these parts of
Schumann's personality.)
Florestan was a heroic
character, violent, aggressive
and manly, the impish person
he sometimes wished to be.
Hersch described him as "wild
sounding."
Eusebius, the feminine, pas
sive and sad figure who most
often was like the quiet and
thoughtful Schumann in real
life was described as sounding
"extremely beautiful."
Hersch said the Davidsbun
dler revealed "the terror of the
split" and records a fight bet
ween the two imaginary per
sonalities. After the battle
Eusebius "sounds like some
how they made a man out of
him," he added.
Ostwald said that Schumann
had probably not consciously

written his conflicts into his
music but that they were there
as the result of "an inner logic
related to the life experiences
he'd had earlier."
Hersch received a standing
ovation from the audience for
his performance of the
Davidsbundler. The composi
tion depicted the conflict with
Schumann that later contri
buted to his mental illness and
death in an asylum at the age of
46.

A "Musicand Madness" pre
sentation here last Thursday
featured a lecture on the life of
early 19th century German
composer Robert Schumann
and the performance of his
Davidsbundler Dances, opus
six. The development of
Schumann's madness and its
expression in music were the
subject of the event, spon
sored by Psychology Prof.
Philip Zimbardo in conjunction
with his "Perspectives in Mad
ness" class.
Zimbardo began the pro
gram with a slide presentation

of madness and art. He then
introduced two speakers from
San Francisco to the audience
of 200 in Annenberg Au
ditorium.
Schumann in many respects
had a double personality, ac
cording to Peter Ostwald, pro
fessor of psychiatry at the
UC-San Francisco School of
Medicine.
He was torn early between
music and literature and was
encouraged by his father, who

was a publisher and booksel
ler, to become a writer. "In his
own day," said Ostwald, "he
was thought of equally as
highly as a journalist."
Schumann was sent as a
child to live with a neighbor,
noted the Berkeley professor,
and became confused about
who his mother was and lacked
a self-identity. "Often he cried,
was very lonely, and felt iso
lated; he was lost," he added.
In his frustration, Schumann

would sing to himself and play
act with friends. He found an
outlet for fantasy in the piano,
said Ostwald, and "had a mar
velous talent for portraying
moods, scenes and people in
tunes."
When Schumann was 16 his
father died, his sister Emilie
committed suicide, and his
prospective music teacher
died. This left him "no one to
turn to, no one to attach him
self to," said Ostwald.
Schumann soon met a
psychiatrist who was the hus
band of a playing partner. After
spending time with this man,
the composer "began to de
scribe himself as someonewho
was on the verge ot madness,"
Ostwald said. Schumann
feared killing himself and
asked in his journal, "What
would happen if you could no
longer think?"
Frau Schumann, his mother,
decided that her son should
become a lawyer. Schumann
was sent to the University of
Leipzig to study law but pre
ferred to spend his time com
posing and later left the
school.
Schumann's hopes of be
coming a virtuoso were shat
tered after he experimented
with a finger stretching device.
The tendons of his right hand
were damaged by this device,
and the remedy prescribed by
a doctor was to immerse the
hand in the blood of a freshly
killed ox. According to
Ostwald, Schumann thought
this was "not the most elegant
kind of treatment," nor was it
effective.
Despair and anger contri-

buted to the composer's
breakdown and attempted
suicide at the age of 23.
Ostwald said that Schuman
would lose consciousness and
his face would flush.
Schumann wrote "I am hardly
more than a statue, without
coldness or warmth . . .lam so
fearful and shy that I cannot
sleep alone."
Paul Hersch, instructorat the
San Francisco Conservatory of
Music, said Schumann used

music " as a kind of therapy."
After his speech, Hersch
played pieces by Schumann
that he said reveal "mood and
certain kinds ot energy that re
flect the development of the
personality." Some selections
Hersch claimed show "fury
and power," whileanotherwas
described as "almost clow
nish." He said the music has
"strong biographical over
tones."
