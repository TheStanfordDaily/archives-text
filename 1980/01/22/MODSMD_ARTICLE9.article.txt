Poetry reading \
Professor of French Pauline Newman-Gordon read a wide
selection of her poetry at La Maison Francaise last Thursday r
evening. The mixed audience of students and faculty re- I
sponded favorably to the professor-poet who read her works in S
English. In between readings, the audience was entertained by r
a piano and violin duet by two residents of La Maison Fran- .
caise, Tracey Minkin and Anita Greenwald.
