Correction
In yesterday's column by Jef
frey Zorn ("More issues in
standardized test debate") the
late Lewis B. Terman was mis
takenly referred to as an en
gineering professor when, in
fact, he was a professor of edu
cation. The error was a result of
an editing oversight, and was
not intended by the author.
