# Quandt speaks on Mid East
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
Citing the possibility of a U:S.-
Soviet confrontation in the volatile
Middle Eastern region and offering
viable strategies to combat this po
tential conflict were two issues ad
dressed by Middle East expert Wil
liam Quandt in a speech here last
night in Toyon Hall.
Quandt, a former member of the
National Security Council and author
of Decade of Decisions, was a
member of the team negotiating the
Camp David accords.
Quandt emphasized the danger of
the increasingly antagonistic rivalry
between the superpowers "playing
itself out in the Middle East," and
warned that "American power is no
longer sufficient to protect what is at
stake." Hecriticized a purely military
solution as "the easiest to deal with
but not an adequate response to the
challenge."
He outlined a comprehensive
strategy calling for a "reassertion of
American power by knitting a net
work of political relationships.
"We can't just take over the region
and make it one big American base,"
Quandt said.

He also warned against a previous
U.S. tendency to "waver between
isolation and overreaction in the
most dangerous zone of United
States-Soviet conflict."
Quandt focused on recent events
that have produced a new environ
ment in the Middle East which is
eroding American power and influ
ence. The single most significant oc
curence in the past year, he said he
felt was the Iranian revolution. The
resulting fall of the shah's regime
drastically changed the balance of
power in the region and our control
of it, he said.
Quandt cited the effects on Ameri
can political attitude as the most ex
tensive ramification of that change.
"The recognition was made that
the Nixon Doctrine was a bankrupt
policy and that merely providing
arms to a regional surrogate does not
insure stability.
"If we want power, we must do it
on our own and not depend on sur
rogates," he said.
Quandt was candid in his reactions
to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
"We must accept that the Soviets are
there to stay. The opportunity pre

sented itself, the costs were assessed
as being not intolerable and the
Soviets are not incremental when
they decide to act."
He also firmly estimated future
Soviet objectives in neighboring
countries. "Iran is clearly the
strategic prize for the Soviets. It is
not a question of intention, only the
path they will take" in acquisition, he
said.
"The word of the United States is
not taken seriously," Quandt said.
"Other nations see random, incon
sistent actions, and our ability is
doubted. They view the Soviets as
toughminded, risk-taking and willing
to pursue their objectives, and it
takes more than rhetoric to begin to
erase that tendency," he said.
Quandt insisted that the United
States must draw the line at Soviet
aggression with Iran. He warned that
potential Soviet control of the world
oil supply would be "intolerable for
the industrial world."
He pointed out that energy is a
crucial factor affecting U.S. policy,
saying that "we cannot afford to re
main as addicted and vulnerable as


William Quandt
we are today to the oil producing car
tel."
Quandt suggested several steps to
build up American credibility in the
Middle East.
He maintained that a renewed ef
fort at dialogue to solve the Palesti
nian problem is one area that would
strengthen the U.S. position. Citing
Pakistan as a possible victim of Soviet
intervention, he outlined the possi
ble U.S. options.
"If we want to extend a security
umbrella over Pakistan, then we
need to guarantee more serious
military aid," he said. The $200 mill
ion currently being considered "just
doesn't buy anything anymore," he
added.
Quandt mentioned the possibility
of supporting the 500,000 Afghan re
fugees carrying on an anti-Soviet re
sistance movement in Pakistan.
"There are humanitarian grounds
to provide assistance to the rebels,
and if we are to become involved we
might as well doit where it will help,"
he said.
Quandt did not advocate
"stimulating the fighting," but said
that if there is an on-going resistance
movement, the U.S. aid could serve
to bolster its strength.
Quandt predicted that the years
ahead will not provide easy or quick
solutions and stressed that public
support for U.S. policy is needed.
Quandt is currently at the Brook
ings Institute.

strategy calling for a "reassertion of
American power by knitting a net
work of political relationships.
"We can't just take over the region
and make it one big American base,"
Quandt said.

He also warned against a previous
U.S. tendency to "waver between
isolation and overreaction in the
most dangerous zone of United
States-Soviet conflict."
Quandt focused on recent events
that have produced a new environ
ment in the Middle East which is
eroding American power and influ
ence. The single most significant oc
curence in the past year, he said he
felt was the Iranian revolution. The
resulting fall of the shah's regime
drastically changed the balance of
power in the region and our control
of it, he said.
Quandt cited the effects on Ameri
can political attitude as the most ex
tensive ramification of that change.
"The recognition was made that
the Nixon Doctrine was a bankrupt
policy and that merely providing
arms to a regional surrogate does not
insure stability.
"If we want power, we must do it
on our own and not depend on sur
rogates," he said.
Quandt was candid in his reactions
to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
"We must accept that the Soviets are
there to stay. The opportunity pre

sented itself, the costs were assessed
as being not intolerable and the
Soviets are not incremental when
they decide to act."
He also firmly estimated future
Soviet objectives in neighboring
countries. "Iran is clearly the
strategic prize for the Soviets. It is
not a question of intention, only the
path they will take" in acquisition, he
said.
"The word of the United States is
not taken seriously," Quandt said.
"Other nations see random, incon
sistent actions, and our ability is
doubted. They view the Soviets as
toughminded, risk-taking and willing
to pursue their objectives, and it
takes more than rhetoric to begin to
erase that tendency," he said.
Quandt insisted that the United
States must draw the line at Soviet
aggression with Iran. He warned that
potential Soviet control of the world
oil supply would be "intolerable for
the industrial world."
He pointed out that energy is a
crucial factor affecting U.S. policy,
saying that "we cannot afford to re
main as addicted and vulnerable as


William Quandt
we are today to the oil producing car
tel."
Quandt suggested several steps to
build up American credibility in the
Middle East.
He maintained that a renewed ef
fort at dialogue to solve the Palesti
nian problem is one area that would
strengthen the U.S. position. Citing
Pakistan as a possible victim of Soviet
intervention, he outlined the possi
ble U.S. options.
"If we want to extend a security
umbrella over Pakistan, then we
need to guarantee more serious
military aid," he said. The $200 mill
ion currently being considered "just
doesn't buy anything anymore," he
added.
Quandt mentioned the possibility
of supporting the 500,000 Afghan re
fugees carrying on an anti-Soviet re
sistance movement in Pakistan.
"There are humanitarian grounds
to provide assistance to the rebels,
and if we are to become involved we
might as well doit where it will help,"
he said.
Quandt did not advocate
"stimulating the fighting," but said
that if there is an on-going resistance
movement, the U.S. aid could serve
to bolster its strength.
Quandt predicted that the years
ahead will not provide easy or quick
solutions and stressed that public
support for U.S. policy is needed.
Quandt is currently at the Brook
ings Institute.
Citing the possibility of a U:S.-
Soviet confrontation in the volatile
Middle Eastern region and offering
viable strategies to combat this po
tential conflict were two issues ad
dressed by Middle East expert Wil
liam Quandt in a speech here last
night in Toyon Hall.
Quandt, a former member of the
National Security Council and author
of Decade of Decisions, was a
member of the team negotiating the
Camp David accords.
Quandt emphasized the danger of
the increasingly antagonistic rivalry
between the superpowers "playing
itself out in the Middle East," and
warned that "American power is no
longer sufficient to protect what is at
stake." Hecriticized a purely military
solution as "the easiest to deal with
but not an adequate response to the
challenge."
He outlined a comprehensive
strategy calling for a "reassertion of
American power by knitting a net
work of political relationships.
"We can't just take over the region
and make it one big American base,"
Quandt said.

He also warned against a previous
U.S. tendency to "waver between
