# Experts fear Mideast nuclear proliferation trend in 1980s
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The Mid
dle East, already a tinderbox of
rivalry for land and oil, may be
come infinitely more danger
ous in the 1980s because of the
proliferation of nuclear
weapons, according to a grow
ing consensus of experts.
"This is the area of the world
where there is more nuclear
technology than anywhere
outside of the major powers.
And it is one of the most unsta
ble parts of the world. It's hor
rifying," former British Prime
Minister lames Callaghan told
reporters at a breakfast here
recently.
The Carter administration
came to power with a three
pronged strategy to prevent
nuclear proliferation. But each
initiative has, at least partially,
failed.
The first initiative was an ef
fort to prevent or delay the ad
vent of plutonium as a com
mercial fuel in nuclear reac
tors. The present generation of
nuclear reactors uses uranium
that has been "enriched"

beyond its natural state to sus
tain a nuclear reaction, but not
enough to use in a bomb.
Plutonium is a byproduct of
commerical nuclear reactors,
but it requires highly sophisti
cated technology to extract it
from the used fuel. Plutonium,
once extracted, can be readily
used in nuclear weapons.
One State Department offi
cial estimated that a nation
with access to plutonium
would need only about 200
people — such as engineers
and machinists — and a
rudimentary factory, to make a
bomb.
The Carter administration
hoped to persuade other in
dustrialized nations at least to
delay the advent of the
plutonium reactor. But an
evaluation group has com
pleted a draft report which
sources say argues strongly
that plutonium reactors must
inevitably come onto the scene
in large numbers in the next
two decades. The report is due
to be made public next month.

With their non-proliferation
effort in disarray, U.S. officials
see these countries as the most
likely Middle East nations to go
nuclear in the 1980s:
Israel: If the Israelis do not
already have a bomb, administ
ration officials believe they
would quickly put one to
gether. They do not allow in
spection of all their nuclear
laboratories. Israel may be re
strained from testing a bomb
by fears that a test would in
crease its isolation in the world
and spur its enemies in the
Arab world to develop their
own bomb.
Pakistan: Officials believe
Pakistan has been having some
difficulties in its nuclear prog
ram and may still be three years
away from exploding a device.
Iraq: Officials say Iraq has an
active program of nuclear re
search, but there is little evi
dence that it has begun a de
termined effort to build a
bomb."lraq wants to be ready
to build one quickly if other
countries in the region get
one," an official said.
