# U.S., Japan evolving stronger alliance
## 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
Tokyo — The American-Japanese military
partnership, key to the U.S. defense line in
the Paofcr, is coming of age. And none too
soon, as defense analysts see it.
Soviet submarines are prowling the
Pacific in increasing numbers; the far
ranging Backfire bomber has been de
ployed to the Soviet Far East; Soviet ships
and planes are frequent visitors to ports
and airfields in Vietnam; and last year the
Russians introduced an aircraft carrier, the
Minsk, to the Pacific.
The United States has only 140,000 sol
diers, sailors and airmen strung out over
the Pacific, from sweltering Guam to the
frigid mountains of South Korea, and ele
ments of the 7th Fleet have been shifted
from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean in
connection with the crisis in Iran.
Thus Japan is more vital than ever to U.S.
defenses in the Western Pacific. And a
well-balanced military alliance between
the two countries is within sight for the
first time since 1952, when a joint defense
treaty took effect.
By doing mote for its own defense,
which is all it was asked to do in the first
place, Japan has released U.S. forces to
keep the peace elsewhere in the Pacific.
The security treaty is unequal in that it
requires the U.S. to come to Japan's de
fense in case of attack, but does not re
quire Japan to come to the defense of the
United States.
Falling taboos
Since the Japanese began to move, one
defense taboo after another has fallen.
In the past 18 months or so, what would
have been unthinkable a few years ago has
become routine. American and Japanese

pilots regularly engage in mock combat in
the skies over northern Japan. Since Ja
pan's skies are as crowded, in their way, as
the land, finding enough air space to man
euver in has been a problem.
"The important thing is that Japanese
and American sergeants, captains, col
onels and generals are working together,"
said Lt. Gen. William H. Ginn, Jr., a tall,
lean fighter pilot who commands the U.S.
sth Air Force and is the top-ranking Ameri
can military man in Japan.
Security relations between the United
States and Japan have "never been
stronger and (more) mutually advantage
ous than they are now," Ganri Yamashita,
Japan's former defense chief, said.
'Right direction'
"Japan's defense effort is moving at the
right pace in the right direction," U.S.
Ambassador Mike Mansfield said.
Another U.S. official said, "We've been
prodding the Japanese to do more for their
own defense tor so long that when they
did begin to move, it was almost as if we
were pushing against an open door."
Japan's defense planning can move
ahead only so long as it not exceed
the pace of public opinion. But public
opinion here has changed radically in
favor of a greater defense effort in recent
years.
Last year Yamashita took the politically
daring step of visiting Seoul, South Korea,
to confer with his Korean counterpart on
defense matters, becoming the first
Japanese defense chief to do that.
Symbolic gestures
In another symbolic gesture, members
of the Joint Staff Council, Japan's highest
military command, broke another self

imposed barrier by flying to Okinawa to
watch a big U.S. Marine Corps amphibious
exercise.
Not so long ago the entire high com
mand would have had to resign for that,
but press and public took the matter in
stride. And today Japanese and American
military men can plan joint strategy for the
defense of Japan, which is all that Japan is
required to do under the security treaty.
There was a mild stir recently when Ja
pan's defense planners announced that
they were about to break another taboo.
The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense
Force, or navy, will take part in joint naval
exercises with the United States, Australia,
New Zealand and Canada next spring in
Hawaiian waters.
Public attitudes
One of the most obvious recent changes
is the public attitude toward defense.
Military topics that used to provoke near
hysteria are now discussed openly, even
nuclear weapons. The once-controversial
security treaty, which brought down a
government when a major revision of it
was rammed through the parliament 20
years ago, is now widely accepted.
Opposition parties have either muted or
dropped their opposition to it. This is due
in part to the low profile of the U.S. milit
ary in Japan, only 46,000 men and women,
most of them Air Force and Marine Corps,
the latter based on Okinawa. But that is
only one factor among many.
The Japanese seldom do anything in a
hurry. They act only after there is general
agreement on a course of action and the
ground has been carefully prepared. The
change in military thinking was no excep
tion.

daring step of visiting Seoul, South Korea,
to confer with his Korean counterpart on
defense matters, becoming the first
Japanese defense chief to do that.
Symbolic gestures
In another symbolic gesture, members
of the Joint Staff Council, Japan's highest
military command, broke another self

imposed barrier by flying to Okinawa to
watch a big U.S. Marine Corps amphibious
exercise.
Not so long ago the entire high com
mand would have had to resign for that,
but press and public took the matter in
stride. And today Japanese and American
military men can plan joint strategy for the
defense of Japan, which is all that Japan is
required to do under the security treaty.
There was a mild stir recently when Ja
pan's defense planners announced that
they were about to break another taboo.
The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense
Force, or navy, will take part in joint naval
exercises with the United States, Australia,
New Zealand and Canada next spring in
Hawaiian waters.
Public attitudes
One of the most obvious recent changes
is the public attitude toward defense.
Military topics that used to provoke near
hysteria are now discussed openly, even
nuclear weapons. The once-controversial
security treaty, which brought down a
government when a major revision of it
was rammed through the parliament 20
years ago, is now widely accepted.
Opposition parties have either muted or
dropped their opposition to it. This is due
in part to the low profile of the U.S. milit
ary in Japan, only 46,000 men and women,
most of them Air Force and Marine Corps,
the latter based on Okinawa. But that is
only one factor among many.
The Japanese seldom do anything in a
hurry. They act only after there is general
agreement on a course of action and the
ground has been carefully prepared. The
change in military thinking was no excep
tion.
The Los Angeles Times
Tokyo — The American-Japanese military
partnership, key to the U.S. defense line in
the Paofcr, is coming of age. And none too
soon, as defense analysts see it.
Soviet submarines are prowling the
Pacific in increasing numbers; the far
ranging Backfire bomber has been de
ployed to the Soviet Far East; Soviet ships
and planes are frequent visitors to ports
and airfields in Vietnam; and last year the
Russians introduced an aircraft carrier, the
Minsk, to the Pacific.
The United States has only 140,000 sol
diers, sailors and airmen strung out over
the Pacific, from sweltering Guam to the
frigid mountains of South Korea, and ele
ments of the 7th Fleet have been shifted
from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean in
connection with the crisis in Iran.
Thus Japan is more vital than ever to U.S.
defenses in the Western Pacific. And a
well-balanced military alliance between
the two countries is within sight for the
first time since 1952, when a joint defense
treaty took effect.
By doing mote for its own defense,
which is all it was asked to do in the first
place, Japan has released U.S. forces to
keep the peace elsewhere in the Pacific.
The security treaty is unequal in that it
requires the U.S. to come to Japan's de
fense in case of attack, but does not re
quire Japan to come to the defense of the
United States.
Falling taboos
Since the Japanese began to move, one
defense taboo after another has fallen.
In the past 18 months or so, what would
have been unthinkable a few years ago has
become routine. American and Japanese

pilots regularly engage in mock combat in
the skies over northern Japan. Since Ja
pan's skies are as crowded, in their way, as
the land, finding enough air space to man
euver in has been a problem.
"The important thing is that Japanese
and American sergeants, captains, col
onels and generals are working together,"
said Lt. Gen. William H. Ginn, Jr., a tall,
lean fighter pilot who commands the U.S.
sth Air Force and is the top-ranking Ameri
can military man in Japan.
Security relations between the United
States and Japan have "never been
stronger and (more) mutually advantage
ous than they are now," Ganri Yamashita,
Japan's former defense chief, said.
'Right direction'
"Japan's defense effort is moving at the
right pace in the right direction," U.S.
Ambassador Mike Mansfield said.
Another U.S. official said, "We've been
prodding the Japanese to do more for their
own defense tor so long that when they
did begin to move, it was almost as if we
were pushing against an open door."
Japan's defense planning can move
ahead only so long as it not exceed
the pace of public opinion. But public
opinion here has changed radically in
favor of a greater defense effort in recent
years.

daring step of visiting Seoul, South Korea,

defense matters, becoming the first
