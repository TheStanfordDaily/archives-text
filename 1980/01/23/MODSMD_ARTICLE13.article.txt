The Los Angeles Times
Atlanta â€” Bert Lance, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's confidant,
and three of Lance's associates
manipulated the U.S. banking
system to obtain and spend
millions of dollars before they
were legally entitled to it,
jurors in Lance's bank fraud
trial were told yesterday.
Marvin Loewy, an attorney in
the justice Department's crim
inal division, said that Lance il
legally shifted huge debts bet
ween dozens of banks and
sought to "hamper and im
pede" federal bank examiners
by providing them with false
information.
In an opening statement,
Loewy told the federal court
jury that Lance, who served as
Carter's budget director until
he resigned under fire of the
banking allegations, engaged
for eight years in "a pattern of
self-dealing loans that ex
ceeded his ability to repay
them."
An estimated $20 million in
proceeds resulting from bank
manipulations, repeated over
drafts and unsecured loans en
abled the Lance group to buy

automobiles, take expensive
vacations, finance large in
vestments and pay back other
loans that were coming due,
Loewy said.
Loewy's statement came
shortly after a largely middle
class jury of six men and six
women was sworn in on the
seventh day of the trial by
ludge Charles Moye |r. of U.S.
District Court. Defense attor
neys for Lance and his as
sociates will outline their own
case for the jury today.
The prosecution then will
start putting on witnesses for
lengthy, detailed and highly
technical testimony about the
Lance group's banking affairs
from 1970 to 1977.
Prior to accepting his
Cabinet-level post in the Carter
administration in January 1977,
Lance had been president of
the National Bank of Georgia in
Atlanta. Before that, he was
board chairman of the Calhoun
First National Bank of Calhoun,
Ca. He resigned his govern
ment post in September 1977,
after a Senate committee
began investigating his bank
ing conduct.

He was indicted 20 months
later, along with his associates,
on 33 counts of conspiracy,
misapplication of bank funds
and submission of false state
ments to financial institutions
and to federal bank examiners.
Loewy said the government
would prove that "a calculated,
sophisticated scheme was car
ried out by highly intelligent
and clever businessmen' who
dealt with 41 banks.

Lance himself filed at least
five false statements in connec
tion with sizable loans that the
group had obtained, Loewy
charged. He said Lance had
overstated his net worth by
$700,000 and his cash assets by
$80,000. Lance also omitted
from bank statements between
$460,000 and $1.1 million in
contingent liabilities; that is,
loans he had co-signed for
others and for which he stood
liable, the prosecutor said.
