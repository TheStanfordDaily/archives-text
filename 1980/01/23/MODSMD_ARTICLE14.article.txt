San Francisco (AP) — A five
alarm tire gutted a downtown
commercial building yester
day, destroying several
businesses as it sent huge col
umns of acrid smoke billowing
over the downtown area.
The blaze, which authorities
said began in the basement of
an adult bookstore, caused an
estimated $250,000 damage
and caused "pretty close to a
total loss" of the structure.
The fire, which was con
tained at about 6 p.m., was lo
cated at Ellis and Mason streets

in the city's Tenderloin District
near the posh Hilton Hotel.
Along with the adult book
store, an adult movie theater, a
liquor store, a pizza restaurant
and a luggage shop were lost to
the flames.
Firefighters were required to
wear oxygen masks following
reports that stored chemicals
— including "Rush," a
nitrate-based purported sexual
stimulant — along with 150
reels of acetate films stored in
Mr. B's adult book store were
emitting toxic fumes.
