## Gerard Rebagliati Compassion the key in abortion issue 
### 
For all the arguments sur
rounding the abortion con
troversy, the principal focus is
on the problem of suffering.
People who advocate abortion
as a legitimate and often
necessary alternative point out
"pragmatically" the high rate
of dangerous "back-alley"
abortions when safe, legal
abortions are unavailable. The
outcome of such unsafe abor
tions is often death, and a pain
ful one at that.
Opponents of abortion,
however, point out that the
unborn child, if not fully de
veloped, is nonetheless
human and as such has a right
to life that cannot be denied by
someone else's personal dis
cretion. On top of that, one
may suppose that the fetus en
dures suffering in an abortion
as well. However transient the
pain, the outcome is certainly
final.
So we arrive at the presence
of very real suffering on both
sides of the question. In the
midst of this, advocates of each
policy accuse those of the
other of i nsensi tivity and
cruelty. Apparently, most
everyone sees a dilemma
which can only be resolved in
the context of abortion.
Yet somehow I wonder if we
have not closed our eyes to
another possibility â€” that of
compassion. Those who advo
cate abortion on the principle
of freedom of control over
one's own body somehow, I
suspect, are guilty of insensitiv
ity and self-deception for the
sake of personal convenience.
It is a scientific fact that the
fetus is both human and
biologically distinct from the
mother. However, there are
those advocates of abortion
who concede a human repug
nance to the act, but honestly
see no alternative in the face of
the desperate suffering that

might otherwise ensue. It is on
this account, if any, that I be
lieve "pro-lifers" may be
faulted.
While the arguments of
those against abortion may be
well-founded, their concern
often falls short. There are in
stances, for example, where
the same people who out of
moral concern oppose abor
tion might also condemn, os
tracize, and impoverish a
woman who bears an illegiti
mate child. More often, the
failing may simply be an out
right lack of any concern at all
for the struggle and prolonged
suffering that a poor and
unwed mother undergoes

once the child is born.
There is no point now in get
ting into another interminable
argument over abortion on
principle. That just adds to the
danger of falling into legalisms,
a failure which has already but
tressed the so-called "pragma
tic" viewpoint that many pro
abortionists adhere to. Rather
it is to point out an admonition
already old when Jesus of
Nazareth reaffirmed it: "Love
your neighbor."
Of course, compassion does
not often come easily. It is dif
ficult for a woman to have the
compassion to allow a child to
be born when she is not ready

for motherhood. It is difficult
for others to have the compas
sion to provide the personal
and material support to enable
her to care for the child, or to
find an adequate home if the
infant is given up for adoption.
Compassion of this sort is
certainly not easy. Yet without
such compassion, those who
"pragmatically" support abor
tion and those who "morally"
oppose it are not, as they
claim, being responsible and
humane. Quite the contrary,
they are being expedient and
callous.
