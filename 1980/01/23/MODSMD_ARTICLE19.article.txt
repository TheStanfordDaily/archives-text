## A 						call to American students 
### 
(The following is presented as
an appeal of Afghan students
to American students.)
Two decades ago it was not
considered proper for the stu
dents to be involved in politics.
However, the active participa
tion of students on most of the
American campuses on the is
sues of the unjust American
war in Vietnam during the 60s
and early 70s has proven the
wisdom of such participation.
It touched every American
youth as a valiant peaceful
strugggle in the name of high
ideals of human rights, the
right for self-determination,
and the notions of freedom
and liberty which formed the
foundations of this great

democracy.
Today, an unjust imperialis
tic war is waged by the Soviet
Union in the impoverished,
innocent nation of Afghanis
tan. Presently, 50,000 crack
soldiers of the U.S.S.R. are
forcefully occupying, bom
barding, using devastating
MIG-21s and MIC-23s with
napalm, modern mountain ar
tillery and T-62 tanks.
Within the past twenty
months, they have been the
cause of 250,000 deaths of our
people inflicted by Russian
equipment and advisers
through their puppet Afghan
governments.
Since Christmas day they
have decided to roll their tanks

over the religious national op
position of Afghans and finish
their resistance once and for all
by committing naked genocide
with their continued invasion
and raping of our country.
Since American students did
not refrain from rising against
their own government in the
war against the people of Viet
nam, we the Afghan students
request and expect the same
response by American stu
dents against the inhuman
slaughter and oppression of
our people by the U.S.S.R.
If we sincerely believe in the
right of the oppressed people,
if we sympathize with the op
pressed and if we truly believe
in truth, freedom, liberty,
human rights and dignity, then
we should rise on every occa
sion when helpless people are
ruthlessly oppressed, and
human rights and decency are
violated.
American students have
proved to the world their loy
alty to those high human val
ues even when those values
were violated by their own
government.
Therefore, we ask of you to
form committees to help re
fugees and to exert your influ
ence upon world opinion
against the unjustified and in
human war that the Soviet gov
ernment is waging in Afghanis
tan, a country once indepen
dent, proud and free — once
called by Zoraster the "land of
high flags."
