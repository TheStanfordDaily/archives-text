# Students for Kennedy losing support
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Changes inside and outside Stan
ford Students for Kennedy, the most
active presidential campaign group
here before Christmas break, are
roughening the political road for the
4-month-old organization.
According to Mark Agnew, group
chairman in charge of campus affairs,
there are more than 120 students
listed on the roster, including those
who attended a rally in White Plaza
last quarter.

Agnew also said the group had an
average of 40 students attending its
meetings last quarter.
Only 18 persons, however, came
last week to the group's first meeting
of the quarter to hear a short speech
by David Bender. Bender is Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy's (D-Mass.) San Fran
cisco headquarters director and in
terim state student coordinator.
The group has also been hurt by
the loss of several of its original lead
ers. Peter Stamos, who founded the
group and helped attract former New
York congressman Allard Lowens
tein to speak here in October, said
he dropped out for lack of time. A
second director, Ann Thone, trans
ferred out of the University.
"Another problem we've had to
deal with is fund-raising," Agnew
commented. "Any money raised has
to be used for our purposes; we
could not hand over money to Ken
nedy's campaign." The University,
Agnew explained, wants money
raised on campus to be used on
campus. At the same time, the Ken
nedy campaign committee is ac
countable for money raised in the
senator's favor. "We've stopped rais
ing money," Agnew said. "We have
not solved this problem."
External influence
Changes outside the sphere of the
pro-Kennedy association have posed
even greater problems for its lead
ers. The crises in Afghanistan and in
Iran have made criticism of the pres
ident, according to group members,
unpatriotic.
"We've yet to see how the opinion
polls have affected the group," one
director noted, adding, "I don't
think the shift in those polls shows a

sentiment in favor of President
limmy Carter, but a statement in
support of the presidency." A Time
magazine poll of Democrats and In
dependents taken at the end of last
month showed that Carter has a 20
percent lead over Kennedy for the
nomination.
Until settlement of the Iranian and
Afghanistan issues, "all the candi
dates are biding their time," said
Alllan Rivlin, the campus Kennedy
Organization's director of inter
campus affairs. "That means every
thing is being done by the students."
Straw vote victory
Polls aside, Kennedy did manage
to pull out a narrow victory over the
weekend at the straw vote in San

Francisco. It was the first such vote
by the state's Democratic Party just
before the start of Monday's lowa
caucuses.
"When the crises have passed,"
Bender said after last week's meet
ing, "it is very clear to me that Sen.
Kennedy will be a very clear voice on
where this administration has
failed." Bender, who arrived at the
meeting one hour after he was
scheduled to speak, was careful not
to mention what those failures might
be.
With Carter riding a wave of patrio
tic fervor, Agnew admitted that the road
ahead for the group "would be dif
ficult."
