## Consume less—or fight 
### 
Part of me is hoping that Rus
sia invades Iran. Then we
Americans would have to re
late some of our personal
habits to our values, a connec
tion we rarely make in our lives
these days.
I reaa in the paper that
America would go to war with
Russia if they invaded Iran, be
cause we cannot live without
Iran'soil. The article went on to
discuss that national security
advisers in Washington were
considering nuclear warfare
since "substantial U.S. military
involvement on the ground"
(American soldiers) would
probably prove insufficient
against Russia's armed forces.
This war would not be like
Vietnam. It would not be
forced on the American citi
zens by the U.S. government
and its corporate interests, but
rather forced on the govern
ment by we the people. We
Americans are demanding that
oil to this day, and the govern

ment is responding to that de
mand by considering how to
safeguard a prime source of
that oil.
Would you, the consumer,
sacrifice lives so that you can
use as much oil as you do now?
That is the issue that arises if
Russia invades Iran.
Actually, I don't really care
where you stand on this issue
as long as you're honest with
yourself and know who is re
sponsible for what goes on.
But if you don't want a war, you
shouldn't cause a war and then
look surprised when it hap
pens.
Listen to this: Americans,
the standard-bearers of the
free world, the most advanced
and humane society on earth,
use one-third of the earth's re
sources although we are only
one-sixth of the earth's human
population, and we would
rather fight nations than con
sume less energy.
By this stance we set a pre
cedent for any group that tries
to take some material thing by
force on the grounds that that
thing is necessary to improve
that group's lifestyle, moral
character, happiness, sense of
judgment or humaneness.
We should not be surprised
if others conclude that to attain
the virtues of this society they
should do what we do.
I, forone, do not believethat
the virtues we hold are depen
dent on having a lot of material
wealth or consuming lots of
energy, and I do not believe
that the virtues we hold can
only be marketed to others by a
nation that commands and
consumes such wealth and re
sources.
I could be wrong, but what
ever the case, let's be honest
and responsible. Americans
should not maintain awesome
energy consumption with awe
some military might in the
name' of freedom and human
ity if it's not true.
It comes down to a very per
sonal level, because it is our
personal energy consumption
that is necessitating combat if
our oil sources are threatened:
if we keep consuming as much
as we do, we could really and
seriously cause a war. If we
cause a war, the reasons we

consume so much become the
reasons for war.
If you drive your car and
consume oil products because
it makes you feel good or be
cause you won't responsibly
consider alternatives, then if
we fight and kill in Iran it'll be
because it makes you feel good
or because you won't respon
sibly consider alternatives. It
will not be because of your in
terest in human rights orworld
freedom. That is how close the
relationship is between your
personal lifestyles and the val
ues of this society.
Vou are not helpless. Vou do
not have to drive your car as
much as you think. We sold
ours, and buses and bikes and
carpools and walking and stay
ing home more than before
work just fine. You can wear
warmerclothes instead of turn
ing up the heat. Vou can take
baths instead of showers, you
can follow the energy
conserving tips regarding
flushing toilets, shaving,
brushing teeth and showering.
I mean, there's no excuse for
the American Studies house
using more energy in October
1979 than October 1978.1' d like
to see a couple of houses use
50 percent of last year's energy
instead of struggling to get 85
percent. It's not so hard once
you know it's possible.
If you live off campus, save
kitchen wastes in peanut but
ter jars and then dump it in
your yard and cover it with
some leaves and dirt and you'll
not only save the energy
needed to dispose of the waste
but you'll be creating the best
soil fertilizer possible.
Recycle your bottles, cans,
newspspers, cardboard,
paper, etc. It takes a lot less
energy to make an aluminum
can from an aluminum can
than to make one from the
ground. Crow sprouts, eat
more raw food, don't support
petroleum - dependent en
ergy-intensive agribusiness
(buy organic food instead),
start a garden. Surprise, sur
prise — it's fun to be responsi
ble, takes very little time and
changes the course of history.

This war would not be like
Vietnam. It would not be
forced on the American citi
zens by the U.S. government
and its corporate interests, but
rather forced on the govern
ment by we the people. We
Americans are demanding that
oil to this day, and the govern

ment is responding to that de
mand by considering how to
safeguard a prime source of
that oil.
Would you, the consumer,
sacrifice lives so that you can
use as much oil as you do now?
That is the issue that arises if
Russia invades Iran.
Actually, I don't really care
where you stand on this issue
as long as you're honest with
yourself and know who is re
sponsible for what goes on.
But if you don't want a war, you
shouldn't cause a war and then
look surprised when it hap
pens.
Listen to this: Americans,
the standard-bearers of the
free world, the most advanced
and humane society on earth,
use one-third of the earth's re
sources although we are only
one-sixth of the earth's human
population, and we would
rather fight nations than con
sume less energy.
By this stance we set a pre
cedent for any group that tries
to take some material thing by
force on the grounds that that
thing is necessary to improve
that group's lifestyle, moral
character, happiness, sense of
judgment or humaneness.
We should not be surprised
if others conclude that to attain
the virtues of this society they
should do what we do.
I, forone, do not believethat
the virtues we hold are depen
dent on having a lot of material
wealth or consuming lots of
energy, and I do not believe
that the virtues we hold can
only be marketed to others by a
nation that commands and
consumes such wealth and re
sources.
I could be wrong, but what
ever the case, let's be honest
and responsible. Americans
should not maintain awesome
energy consumption with awe
some military might in the
name' of freedom and human
ity if it's not true.
It comes down to a very per
sonal level, because it is our
personal energy consumption
that is necessitating combat if
our oil sources are threatened:
if we keep consuming as much
as we do, we could really and
seriously cause a war. If we
cause a war, the reasons we

consume so much become the
reasons for war.
If you drive your car and
consume oil products because
it makes you feel good or be
cause you won't responsibly
consider alternatives, then if
we fight and kill in Iran it'll be
because it makes you feel good
or because you won't respon
sibly consider alternatives. It
will not be because of your in
terest in human rights orworld
freedom. That is how close the
relationship is between your
personal lifestyles and the val
ues of this society.
Vou are not helpless. Vou do
not have to drive your car as
much as you think. We sold
ours, and buses and bikes and
carpools and walking and stay
ing home more than before
work just fine. You can wear
warmerclothes instead of turn
ing up the heat. Vou can take
baths instead of showers, you
can follow the energy
conserving tips regarding
flushing toilets, shaving,
brushing teeth and showering.
I mean, there's no excuse for
the American Studies house
using more energy in October
1979 than October 1978.1' d like
to see a couple of houses use
50 percent of last year's energy
instead of struggling to get 85
percent. It's not so hard once
you know it's possible.
If you live off campus, save
kitchen wastes in peanut but
ter jars and then dump it in
your yard and cover it with
some leaves and dirt and you'll
not only save the energy
needed to dispose of the waste
but you'll be creating the best
soil fertilizer possible.
Recycle your bottles, cans,
newspspers, cardboard,
paper, etc. It takes a lot less
energy to make an aluminum
can from an aluminum can
than to make one from the
ground. Crow sprouts, eat
more raw food, don't support
petroleum - dependent en
ergy-intensive agribusiness
(buy organic food instead),
start a garden. Surprise, sur
prise — it's fun to be responsi
ble, takes very little time and
changes the course of history.

Part of me is hoping that Rus
sia invades Iran. Then we
Americans would have to re
late some of our personal
habits to our values, a connec
tion we rarely make in our lives
these days.
I reaa in the paper that
America would go to war with
Russia if they invaded Iran, be
cause we cannot live without
Iran'soil. The article went on to
discuss that national security
advisers in Washington were
considering nuclear warfare
since "substantial U.S. military
involvement on the ground"
(American soldiers) would
probably prove insufficient
against Russia's armed forces.
