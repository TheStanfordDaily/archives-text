## The
						law of 'reverse results' still stands 
### 
Last November a column I
wrote about "the law of re
verse results" (Daily, Nov. 14)
drew two responses to which I
would like to respond. My orig
inal article set forth as a general
principle that the use of force
or coercion in attempts to pro

duce social benefits inevitably
leads to the opposite of the in
tended result or to side effects
worse than the original prob
lem to be solved.
In the first response Alex
Starr (Daily, Nov. 19) cited the
early 19th century as a time
when little coercion was used
by government and the "invis
ible hand" produced a minor
ity which reaped huge benefits
at the expense of the majority.
With this assertion, Starr
shows a profound ignorance of
both history and the way a free
market works. This period saw
the economic position of the
average American improve
tremendously. How else can
he explain why millions of
people made the dangerous
voyage to a new land and kept
coming over a period of more
than a century?
Starr, and many others, have
the notion that a free market is
like a race — those who start
out ahead have an advantage
that works to the disadvantage
of those who start out further
behind. This is just wrong.
In market exchanges both
parties benefit. One person's
advantage can also be another
person's advantage. If I am a
good shoemaker, you will wear

better shoes. The benefits of a
minority in a free market are
not reaped at the expense of
the majority, but to the advan
tage of the majority.
In further attempting to dis
credit the law of reverse re
sults, Starr resorted to a flawed
analogy: even if all drivers
were alert, sober, and benevo
lent, wouldn't we need traffic
lights?
Of course we need traffic
lights! But they are not coer
cion, since when one voluntar
ily uses a road one agrees to
abide by the rules that the
road-owner (in this case the
government) sets forth.
More importantly, the rules
of the road did not arise by
government fiat. They are a
perfect example of a spon
taneous order — an arrange
ment adopted voluntarily be
cause it enhances the ability of
individuals to get along with
and benefit from other indi
viduals.
The opposite approach —
that the conventions by which
individuals interact can be de
signed — has been aptly label
led by Nobel laureate Friedrich
Hayek as "the error of con
structivism." Constructivists
are confident not only that man

is the measureof all things, but
that he is smart enough to
choose his own future and
knows enough to achieve it, by
force if necessary.
Hitler was, of course, a con
structivism So was the shah,
who paid the price for ignoring
human and historical values in
his arrogant haste to remake
Iran. So are many intellectuals,
who would impose solar
energy, or "no-fault" insur
ance, or "national service" on
us.
All constructivists must
eventually learn about the law
of reverse results or die fai
lures. The future cannot in any
comprehensive way be de
signed, and those that try will,
as the saying goes, simply re
peat history without learning
from it.
A second response to my
column by Kent Baily (Daily,
Nov. 27) fell into the all-too
common class of retorts to
libertarianism based mainly on
ignorance of its principles. To
Bailey, a counter-example to
the law of reverse results is the
effectiveness of force in stop
ping a robbery. But no liberta
rian would deny this; it is the
initiation of force against
peaceful persons — drug laws,

the minimum wage, the milit
ary draft, taxation — that is to
be condemned on moral as
well as utilitarian grounds.
Baily also suggests that gov
ernment accomplishes many
things non-coercively — by
paying salaries, for example.
What he ignores is that gov
ernment, by its very nature, is
built on a foundation of vio
lence and the threat of vio
lence.
The revenues that govern
ment collects and calls "taxas
tion" ("your fair share"!) are
morally indistinguishable from
the robbery that Bailey con
demns. Libertarians would
merely hold government to the
same moral standards applied
to individuals.
Most interesting to me is the
fact that neither Starr nor
Bailey nor anyone else has met
my challenge to produce a
counter-example to the law of
reverse results, a case where
force has achieved a positive
social benefit without ill side
effects. If you think you Iwe
such a counter-example, give
me a call. I'm still waiting to
hear one.
