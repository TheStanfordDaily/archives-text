# Women picketed White House, endured angry crowds
## Oldest living suffragette recalls fighting days 
### 
The los Angeles Times
Washington — Hazel Hun
kins Hallinan, believed to be
the last living suffragette, will
be 90 in June, but she remem
bers clearly those fighting
days, even though they hap
pened more than a half
century ago.
What were they like?
"Hell," she said.
She and others, particularly
the late Alice Paul — who also
became a well-known champ
ion of the Equal Rights
Amendment — picketed Presi
dent Woodrow Wilson's White
House tor months, campaign
ing for the right to vote, an
amendment that was finally
ratified in 1920.
"We would take hot bricks to
stand on in the winter," she
said.
"They didn't stay hot very
long, but it was better than
standing on ice and snow. And
the crowds were very un
friendly. We used to grit our
teeth for the insults when the
civil servants came out of work
at 4 p.m. 'Dirty bitches — what
are you doing here?' they
would shout. Sometimes it was
even worse than that."
She taps her cane for em
phasis, the only tangible sign
of her age. She is a spunky,
energetic woman who looks
years younger, and who has
lost neither her energy nor her
passion for women's equality.
"We had people tearing our
banners out of our hands, tear
ing our clothes," she said.
"The police would arrest us
and charge us with causing a
riot — but it wasn't the peace
ful picketers who caused the
riot, but the crowds. But we
went to prison. It was a 30-day
sentence, but we were in there
only' 10 days. We went on a
hunger strike and there was
such an outcry that President
Wilson had to free us.
"President Wilson didn't like
the publicity we got. He made
all these speeches about

democracy and freedom —
and we threw his words back at
him through our banners. He
was talking about democracy
in the world — but we didn't
even have it here. But he just
didn't believe in it. That's all."
She has lived in England for
many years and has not fol
lowed closely the struggle in
recent years over the Equal
Rights Amendment. But she is
baffled over its failure to be
ratified.
"I'm afraid there are just too
many people who thought it
was the end of the fight when
the voting rights amendment
was approved," she said. "But
there is still deep-seated dis
crimination. We have to have
ERA. I think the women's
movement has fallen apart. It's
too diversified. Perhaps it is
because there is no leader as
great as AP (Alice Paul) who
galvanized women. She turned
them from placid housewives
into suffragettes. Now, there

are just splinter groups."
Hallinan said she was at a
loss to understand why a well
organized campaign would not
result in the amendment's ap
proval.
"Take the state of Illinois,"
she said. "The heartland of the
country — and it still won't
pass it. Why don't we just go in
there by the scores and picket
the men who vote against it?
Why don't we go to their meet
ings, interrupt them, picket —
and vote against them. That's
what wc did in the 1916 elec
tion. We went into Missouri
with a group of women from
the suffrage states and concen
trated on one congressman on
the judiciary committee. We
asked people to vote against
him. That's something — to ask
people to vote against their
normal representative."
The man was defeated, she
said.
"The word got around," she
said. "It spread like wildfire

that this old congressman had
been defeated by the women.
Every man in Congress got
scared. They all got worried. It
did us more good than any
thing else."
She was asked how she
would counter Phyllis Schlafly,
the Illinois woman who is
chairman of Stop ERA. "I never
heard of her," Hallinan said.
"But, mind you — I don't live in
America."
She was in Washington visit
ing family and close friends
and staying in the headquar
ters of the National Women's
Party, which she joined in the
summer of 1916 after a per
sonal experience with dis
crimination turned her into a
committee feminist.
"I got a job at the University
of Missouri teaching chemis
try," she said. "I taught there
from 1913 to 1916 and left to
return to Montana to take care
of my mother who had a seri
ous illness. I decided I wanted

to go into industry, to actually
be a chemist. I spent an entire
summer trying to get a job with
one firm after another. Every
single letter came back: 'Sorry,
we do not employ women.'
They all said I was over
qualified — but that they just
would not hire a woman."
And then she met one of
Alice Paul's colleagues, a
woman named Anna Louise
Rowe. "She came out to Mon
tana on a project AP gave her,
to organize feminists in the
state," Hallinan said. "Well,
this just fitted right into my life
— here was a movement to
allow women to go into offices,
and everywhere."
She was born in Aspen,
Colo., and grew up in Billings,
Mont., the only child of Civil
War veteran Lewis Hunkins
and Anne Whittingham Hun
kins. She was graduated in 1913
from Vassar College and in
1920 married Charles Thomas
Hallinan, a Chicago reporter.

great as AP (Alice Paul) who
galvanized women. She turned
them from placid housewives
into suffragettes. Now, there

are just splinter groups."
Hallinan said she was at a
loss to understand why a well
organized campaign would not
result in the amendment's ap
proval.
"Take the state of Illinois,"
she said. "The heartland of the
country — and it still won't
pass it. Why don't we just go in
there by the scores and picket
the men who vote against it?
Why don't we go to their meet
ings, interrupt them, picket —
and vote against them. That's
what wc did in the 1916 elec
tion. We went into Missouri
with a group of women from
the suffrage states and concen
trated on one congressman on
the judiciary committee. We
asked people to vote against
him. That's something — to ask
people to vote against their
normal representative."
The man was defeated, she
said.
"The word got around," she
said. "It spread like wildfire

that this old congressman had
been defeated by the women.
Every man in Congress got
scared. They all got worried. It
did us more good than any
thing else."
She was asked how she
would counter Phyllis Schlafly,
the Illinois woman who is
chairman of Stop ERA. "I never
heard of her," Hallinan said.
"But, mind you — I don't live in
America."
She was in Washington visit
ing family and close friends
and staying in the headquar
ters of the National Women's
Party, which she joined in the
summer of 1916 after a per
sonal experience with dis
crimination turned her into a
committee feminist.
"I got a job at the University
of Missouri teaching chemis
try," she said. "I taught there
from 1913 to 1916 and left to
return to Montana to take care
of my mother who had a seri
ous illness. I decided I wanted

to go into industry, to actually
be a chemist. I spent an entire
summer trying to get a job with
one firm after another. Every
single letter came back: 'Sorry,
we do not employ women.'
They all said I was over
qualified — but that they just
would not hire a woman."
And then she met one of
Alice Paul's colleagues, a
woman named Anna Louise
Rowe. "She came out to Mon
tana on a project AP gave her,
to organize feminists in the
state," Hallinan said. "Well,
this just fitted right into my life
— here was a movement to
allow women to go into offices,
and everywhere."
She was born in Aspen,
Colo., and grew up in Billings,
Mont., the only child of Civil
War veteran Lewis Hunkins
and Anne Whittingham Hun
kins. She was graduated in 1913
from Vassar College and in
1920 married Charles Thomas
Hallinan, a Chicago reporter.
The los Angeles Times
Washington — Hazel Hun
kins Hallinan, believed to be
the last living suffragette, will
be 90 in June, but she remem
bers clearly those fighting
days, even though they hap
pened more than a half
century ago.
What were they like?
"Hell," she said.
She and others, particularly
the late Alice Paul — who also
became a well-known champ
ion of the Equal Rights
Amendment — picketed Presi
dent Woodrow Wilson's White
House tor months, campaign
ing for the right to vote, an
amendment that was finally
ratified in 1920.
"We would take hot bricks to
stand on in the winter," she
said.
"They didn't stay hot very
long, but it was better than
standing on ice and snow. And
the crowds were very un
friendly. We used to grit our
teeth for the insults when the
civil servants came out of work
at 4 p.m. 'Dirty bitches — what
are you doing here?' they
would shout. Sometimes it was
even worse than that."
She taps her cane for em
phasis, the only tangible sign
of her age. She is a spunky,
energetic woman who looks
years younger, and who has
lost neither her energy nor her
passion for women's equality.
"We had people tearing our
banners out of our hands, tear
ing our clothes," she said.
"The police would arrest us
and charge us with causing a
riot — but it wasn't the peace
ful picketers who caused the
riot, but the crowds. But we
went to prison. It was a 30-day
sentence, but we were in there
only' 10 days. We went on a
hunger strike and there was
such an outcry that President
Wilson had to free us.
"President Wilson didn't like
the publicity we got. He made
all these speeches about

democracy and freedom —
and we threw his words back at
him through our banners. He
was talking about democracy
in the world — but we didn't
even have it here. But he just
didn't believe in it. That's all."
She has lived in England for
many years and has not fol
lowed closely the struggle in
recent years over the Equal
Rights Amendment. But she is
baffled over its failure to be
ratified.
"I'm afraid there are just too
many people who thought it
was the end of the fight when
the voting rights amendment
was approved," she said. "But
there is still deep-seated dis
crimination. We have to have
ERA. I think the women's
movement has fallen apart. It's
too diversified. Perhaps it is
because there is no leader as
great as AP (Alice Paul) who
galvanized women. She turned
them from placid housewives
into suffragettes. Now, there
