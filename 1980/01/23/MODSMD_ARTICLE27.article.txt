# Vietnam vets fear contamination by deadly herbicide

Washington (AP) — Thousands of ex-Cls want
the government to tell them whether they carry in
their bodies one of the world's deadliest chemi
cals, a grim residue of America's Vietnam years.
The men fear their health will break down or
even that they may die — as a result of their expo
sure in Vietnam to the herbicide dubbed Agent
Orange because it was packed in bright orange
drums.
Some already tell of ringing in their ears, losing
their toenails or their sex drive and a mystifying
varietyof otherailments. Government researchers
are looking for answers but say it may take years to
find them.
For nine years, Air Force planes sprayed more
than 10 million gallons of Agent Orange over Viet
nam, trying to kill off thick jungle growth that
concealed communist forces.
Thousands of American servicemen went into
sprayed areas. Some were drenched in Agent
Orange.
The spraying stopped in 1971, but not before
Vietnamese women had begun reporting an in
crease in stillbirths.
No one knew then that a byproduct of Agent

Orange is dioxin, a substance one researcher says
is a million times more poisonous than PCBs,
poly-chlorinated biphenyls, which the govern
ment has banned as carcinogen.
Agent Orange is a 50-50 mixture of two chemi
cals, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Dioxin is created in the
manufacture of 2,4,5-T, use of which was banned
last year by the Environmental Protection Agency
after it was linked to miscarriages in Oregon.
The official position of the Veterans Administra
tion (VA) is that "no conclusive evidence" links
Agent Orange with any disease.
Still, when a serviceman is ill, he is eligible for
treatment in VA hospitals. He need not show that
his ailment is caused by Agent Orange.
If, however, a connection existed, the veteran
would also be eligible for disability payments. The
catch is that even if research establishes that men
who were sprayed are in danger, no treatment
exists to counter the effects of dioxin.
VAofficials plan to study the men coming in with
the mystifying complaints, to see if one common
experience among them might be exposure to
Agent Orange.
Dr. Paul A.L. Haber, the VA's assistant chief

medical director, heads a 12-member Advisory
Committee on Health-Related Effects of Her
bicides, overseeing the study. It meets four times a
year.
In an interview, Haber made these points:
—More than 5000 veterans have come into VA
hospitals to ask about Agent Orange or to report
ailments they attribute to exposure, and the
number of complaints is increasing.
"The complaints that seem to be most com
monly experienced are numbness and tingling of
the fingers, insomnia, headaches, change of per
sonality, loss of libido, impotence, allegation of
malformed children ahd skin rashes," Haber said.
—Only one veteran has been awarded disability
payments because of an illness linked to Agent
Orange. The serviceman, receiving a 10 percent
disability award of $48.40 a month, suffers from
chloracne, a painful skin rash.
Asked to speculate whether their exposure to
Agent Orange threatens their health, Haber
hedged.
"I can't really give you any hunch," he said. "I
am, as most people with my perspective and train
ing are, very concerned."
