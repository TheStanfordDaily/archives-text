# Results have changed the presidential contest
## After Iowa caucuses, it's a new race 
### 
From Daily wire services
The startling results of Monday's
lowa caucuses have dramatically al
tered the presidential contests in
both parties and left winners and
losers to ponder the lessons of the
opening battle of the 1980 campaign
for the White House.
By his upset victory, former
U.N. Ambassador George Bush
transformed the struggle for the Re
publican nomination into a two-man
race between him and former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan.
With most of the precincts report
ing yesterday, Bush led the COP's
straw vote 33 percent, followed by
Reagan with 27 percent.
And President Jimmy Carter's
landslide 59-to-31 percent triumph
over Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
had Kennedy up against the ropes
and Carter in a position to deliver a
knockout blow in next month's New
Hampshire primary.
Underlining these developments
was the relatively large voter turn
outs in both parties, which stunned

strategists apd neutral observers as
well.
15 innings
Kennedy foresaw yesterday "a 15-
inning fight" against Carter for the
nomination, but conceded he must
win contests in his native New Eng
land to keep his candidacy alive.
Smiling and joking with reporters
over his loss by a nearly 2-1 margin to
Carter in the lowa precinct caucuses,
Kennedy said: "Well, we could have
done a little better." But he pre
dicted he still would win his party's
nomination in New York City this
August.
The Massachusetts senator had
consistently cast himself as the un
derdog in lowa, and his slide in the
polls confirmed that role. Kennedy
spokesman Tom Southwick attri
buted the senator's defeat to the na
tion's preoccupation with the crises
in Iran and Afghanistan.
Support
"People wanted some way of ex
pressing support for the president
during a time of foreign policy
crisis," said Steve Johnson, a
spokesman for the Kennedy cam
paign in lowa.
And to help drive that point home
to the voters, the Carter campaign
ran a television commercial that
showed the president in the Oval Of
fice, making his response to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The
commercial included this message:
"Do we or do we not support the
president as he makes the hard deci
sions in response to the challenges
from Iran and Soviet aggression in
Afghanistan?"

Carter, who never made a cam
paign appearance in lowa because of
the foreign crises, thanked lowans
for their support "in these difficult
times."
Vindication
White House press secretary Jody
Powell said Carter's triumph "cer
tainly is a vindication" of his partial
grain embargo against the Soviet
Union in retaliation for the Russian
military intervention in Afghanistan.
Powell called it"the single issue
that was a subject of definitely hot
debate" in lowa.
He also said it will be tough for
Cartertowin in Kennedy's back yard,
but just as tough for Kennedy in the
Deep South.
After primaries in New Hampshire
Feb. 26 and in Massachusetts and
Vermont on March 4, the competi
tion moves to Florida, Georgia and
Alabama on March 11. Powell said
the Carter target is to do better in
New England than Kennedy does in
the South.
Surprise
In the Republican straw vote in
lowa, George Bush scored a surprise
upset over Ronald Reagan, the pre
viously acknowledged frontrunner.
Senate Republican leader Howard
Baker of Tennessee ran a distant
third.
Bush's winning strategy was a
throwback to the pre-television age.
It depended on a chain reaction that
began over a year ago when Bush
started campaigning in lowa. Gradu
ally he built up a network of
statewide opinion leaders that mul
tiplied into a network of county lead

ers that culminated with organiza
tions in all 99 counties.
Reagan told a Los Angeles news
conference that Bush won because
of "great organizational effort," but
Reagan predicted: "I'm going in to
win in New Hampshire." He said it
still was a wide-open race among all
COP candidates.
Problems
The two other major Republican
candidates, Baker and former Texas
Gov. John Connally, faced serious
problems. Baker, who started lute in
lowa and finished a distant third with
only 13 percent of the straw vote of
Republican caucus attendees, has to
figure out a way to come closer to
Bush in the Feb. 26 New Hampshire
primary, or face a collapse of his can
didacy.
And Connally, whom both Bush
and Reagan strategists said they had
effectively eliminated as a serious
threat as a result of the caucuses, had
to figure out a way to survive politi
cally until the March 8 primary in
South Carolina. Connally had plan
ned the South Carolina election as a
major one-on-one confrontation
with Reagan. But now he must con
tend with the fact that Bush is plan
ning to step up his own efforts in that
state and elsewhere in the South, in
cluding the March 11 primaries in
Florida and Alabama.
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who
finished last in the lowa balloting,
said he would decide within a few
days whether to remain in conten
tion for the COP nomination.

straw vote 33 percent, followed by
Reagan with 27 percent.
And President Jimmy Carter's
landslide 59-to-31 percent triumph
over Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
had Kennedy up against the ropes
and Carter in a position to deliver a
knockout blow in next month's New
Hampshire primary.
Underlining these developments
was the relatively large voter turn
outs in both parties, which stunned

strategists apd neutral observers as
well.
15 innings
Kennedy foresaw yesterday "a 15-
inning fight" against Carter for the
nomination, but conceded he must
win contests in his native New Eng
land to keep his candidacy alive.
Smiling and joking with reporters
over his loss by a nearly 2-1 margin to
Carter in the lowa precinct caucuses,
Kennedy said: "Well, we could have
done a little better." But he pre
dicted he still would win his party's
nomination in New York City this
August.
The Massachusetts senator had
consistently cast himself as the un
derdog in lowa, and his slide in the
polls confirmed that role. Kennedy
spokesman Tom Southwick attri
buted the senator's defeat to the na
tion's preoccupation with the crises
in Iran and Afghanistan.
Support
"People wanted some way of ex
pressing support for the president
during a time of foreign policy
crisis," said Steve Johnson, a
spokesman for the Kennedy cam
paign in lowa.
And to help drive that point home
to the voters, the Carter campaign
ran a television commercial that
showed the president in the Oval Of
fice, making his response to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The
commercial included this message:
"Do we or do we not support the
president as he makes the hard deci
sions in response to the challenges
from Iran and Soviet aggression in
Afghanistan?"

Carter, who never made a cam
paign appearance in lowa because of
the foreign crises, thanked lowans
for their support "in these difficult
times."
Vindication
White House press secretary Jody
Powell said Carter's triumph "cer
tainly is a vindication" of his partial
grain embargo against the Soviet
Union in retaliation for the Russian
military intervention in Afghanistan.
Powell called it"the single issue
that was a subject of definitely hot
debate" in lowa.
He also said it will be tough for
Cartertowin in Kennedy's back yard,
but just as tough for Kennedy in the
Deep South.
After primaries in New Hampshire
Feb. 26 and in Massachusetts and
Vermont on March 4, the competi
tion moves to Florida, Georgia and
Alabama on March 11. Powell said
the Carter target is to do better in
New England than Kennedy does in
the South.
Surprise
In the Republican straw vote in
lowa, George Bush scored a surprise
upset over Ronald Reagan, the pre
viously acknowledged frontrunner.
Senate Republican leader Howard
Baker of Tennessee ran a distant
third.
Bush's winning strategy was a
throwback to the pre-television age.
It depended on a chain reaction that
began over a year ago when Bush
started campaigning in lowa. Gradu
ally he built up a network of
statewide opinion leaders that mul
tiplied into a network of county lead

ers that culminated with organiza
tions in all 99 counties.
Reagan told a Los Angeles news
conference that Bush won because
of "great organizational effort," but
Reagan predicted: "I'm going in to
win in New Hampshire." He said it
still was a wide-open race among all
COP candidates.
Problems
The two other major Republican
candidates, Baker and former Texas
Gov. John Connally, faced serious
problems. Baker, who started lute in
lowa and finished a distant third with
only 13 percent of the straw vote of
Republican caucus attendees, has to
figure out a way to come closer to
Bush in the Feb. 26 New Hampshire
primary, or face a collapse of his can
didacy.
And Connally, whom both Bush
and Reagan strategists said they had
effectively eliminated as a serious
threat as a result of the caucuses, had
to figure out a way to survive politi
cally until the March 8 primary in
South Carolina. Connally had plan
ned the South Carolina election as a
major one-on-one confrontation
with Reagan. But now he must con
tend with the fact that Bush is plan
ning to step up his own efforts in that
state and elsewhere in the South, in
cluding the March 11 primaries in
Florida and Alabama.
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), who
finished last in the lowa balloting,
said he would decide within a few
days whether to remain in conten
tion for the COP nomination.
From Daily wire services
The startling results of Monday's
lowa caucuses have dramatically al
tered the presidential contests in
both parties and left winners and
losers to ponder the lessons of the
opening battle of the 1980 campaign
for the White House.
By his upset victory, former
U.N. Ambassador George Bush
transformed the struggle for the Re
publican nomination into a two-man
race between him and former
California Gov. Ronald Reagan.
