## Freshman readies for enjoyable Olympian task 
### 
Ivan Maisel

For the thousands of athletes who
will descend upon the tiny hamlet of
Lake Placid next month for the 1980
Winter Olympics, their arrival will be
just the beginning of a years-long
journey filled with practice, sweat,
aches and tears. Yet they still may re
turn home crushed, deserted by the
very skills that had brought them to
the pinnacle of athletic achievement.
For Stanford freshman Bonnie
Warner, the road to Lake Placid
began just over a year ago as a diver
sion from studying. And Bonnie does
not have to worry about seeing her
preparation go down the tubes in de
feat, because for her, getting there
will be all the fun.
As a matter of fact, without Bonnie
Warner, the 1980 Winter Olympics
cannot start. She's carrying the torch.
The Olympic torch has traditionally
been relayed from Olympia to the site
of the Games on foot. In many cases,
the torch has been run from one end
of the host country to the other.
That endeavor not being feasible,
the Lake Placid Olympic Organizing
Committee (LPOOC) selected one
runner from each state, as well as one
from Washington, D.C. and from
lake Placid itself, in order to fulfill
this tradition.
The LPOOC began their nation
wide search for the torchbearers in
August of 1978 by advertising in run
ning magazines. It was just such a
magazine that Bonnie Warner picked
up while avoiding homework in the
Mt. Baldy, California Public Library.
"I saw this ad that asked 'Would
you like to be a torchbearer?' I said to
myself, 'I know I'll never get it,' but
you can't get anything unless you
send your name in. Then I looked at
the running times and thought I had
no chance. I'm real slow. ! just run for
the fun of it."
The torchbearers are not all-star
athletes. The only athletic require
ment on the application was that they
be able to run three miles at a 7Vi
minute pace, 'he only other condi

tion was that there were no condi
tions. The torchbearers are all shapes
and sizes.
There is a 44-year-old doctor from
Arizona, a 32-year-old from Kansas, a
45-year-old banker from Alabama.
The fastest time was run by a 15-
year-old. The runners are divided
evenly, 26 males and 26 females and
of ages between 15 and 56 years.
As for Bonnie, she is a typical 17-
year-old college freshman. Fler dorm
room is plastered with Olympic post
ers and runners, excluding the Terri
ble Towel that her roommate, a native
of Pittsburgh, has draped in one
corner. Her bed is covered with a
quilt decorated with the symbol of
the Lake Placid Games, the raccoon.
And she is an amateur among
amateurs. "I started running in high
school to get in shape tor field hoc
key," said Bonnie, a member of the
field hockey team on the Farm.
"When I heard I was a finalist, I began
running every chance I got. I ran to
school, I ran from school, I ran to
work."
That's running to school as in a
V-mile run. Each way. "I only ran
every other day, and only in one di
rection," Warner said.
There were five finalists from each
of the 52 areas, 260 in all. Each one
had a personal interview in March of
last year, as well as a final test of a
five-kilometer run whilst carrying a
torch.
"They just wanted to get to know
me," Warner said. "They asked me
about hockey, about Girl Scouts — I
think they wanted outdoorsy-type
people."
On April 1, Warner received a call
from Lake Placid —a call of congratu
lations. And then the real training be
gan.
"We had to meet their training
schedule by lanuary 1 — four miles at
a 7'/<-minute pace. That wasn't so
tough. We had orientation in )uly in
lake Placid. A week before I went

there, I broke my ankle at a field hoc
key camp in Virginia — it was Friday
the 13th," Warner laughed.
Orientation included a tour of the
facilities as well as a general initiation
as to the responsibilities of each run
ner. The 52 runners will converge
upon Yorktown, Va. ( next week to
betjin theB2o-mile trek to Lake Placid.
They will meet the flame there, which
will arrive from Greece via jet to
Langley Air Force Base, then by Navy
launch to Yorktown Harbor.
The route takes the torch wholly on
backroads, hitting every historical
landmark between the two points.
Yorktown was chosen because it was
the site of the surrender of the British
in the Revolutionary War. They go
from there to Colonial Williamsburg
and through Ml. Vernon
(Washington's burial ground) to
Washington, D.C.
After a ceremony at the Capitol the
run continues up the East Coast,
through Philadelphia, where they will
run up the steps that Rocky immor
talized, then to New York City.
The torch will continue through
Hyde Park, N.Y. (the burial site of
Franklin Roosevelt), and then will be
split, with the runners carrying the
flame around each side of the
Adirondacks before meeting in Lake
Placid on February 8.
The flame will be kept in a 6U-toot
protective lamp in Lake Placid until
the Opening Ceremonies five days la
ter.
Once there, the runners will prac
tice constantly until the Opening
Ceremonies. All 52 will participate in
the awards ceremony each night, as
well as continue practice for their role
in the closing ceremonies.
"We have to practice for the Clos
ing Ceremonies from midnight to 6
a.m.," Warner groaned. "It's the only
time the ice will be open. I don't plan
on getting much sleep."
To meet her increased load of re
sponsibility, Warner has increased
her daily running regimen to an aver

age of 7 to 9 miles per day. "Some
days I do sprints, some days I run
from Half Moon Bay. It's about 30
miles. Pve done lots of running re
cently," the bubbly blonde under
stated. "The closest thing I have to a
trainer is my roommate. When it's
seven in the morning and I don't want
to go running, she gets me up."
In addition to increasing her dis
tances, Warner has been preparing
for the package she will carry. "The
torch weighs about two pounds. I've
been carrying a steel bar that weighs
about IVi pounds for practice," she
said.
When she quits practicing and it is
time for the real thing, Warner will be
ready. "Ever since I was a kid, I always
wanted to go to the Olympics. When
we used to make a list of things we
always wanted to do, I would write
that down."
The Games are more to Warner
than just the fulfillment of a dream.
One of the essays she had to write in
application tor the role of California's
torchbearer asked how she could
contribute to the Olympic spirit.
"In a serious, all-out endeavor such
as the Olympics," Warner wrote,
"what we need is a little bit ot humor,
of camaraderie, of spirit. After all,
laughter is the same in any lan
guage."
With all the preparation completed
and the run to Lake Placid about to
commence, there is still one tor
chbearing position yet to be filled:
the one who actually lights the torch
in the Olympic Stadium.
"One of the 52 is chosen to run up
the stairs, but they won't say who
until an hour before the start of the
Games," Warner said. When asked
what her chances were of being that
torchbearer, she blushed and
laughed. "Zero — I don't have the
fancy running style ol the person who
lights it. I don't have a chance."
Funny, that is what she said when
she applied for her present role.

For the thousands of athletes who
will descend upon the tiny hamlet of
Lake Placid next month for the 1980
Winter Olympics, their arrival will be
just the beginning of a years-long
journey filled with practice, sweat,
aches and tears. Yet they still may re
turn home crushed, deserted by the
very skills that had brought them to
the pinnacle of athletic achievement.
For Stanford freshman Bonnie
Warner, the road to Lake Placid
began just over a year ago as a diver
sion from studying. And Bonnie does
not have to worry about seeing her
preparation go down the tubes in de
feat, because for her, getting there
will be all the fun.
As a matter of fact, without Bonnie
Warner, the 1980 Winter Olympics
cannot start. She's carrying the torch.
The Olympic torch has traditionally
been relayed from Olympia to the site
of the Games on foot. In many cases,
the torch has been run from one end
of the host country to the other.
That endeavor not being feasible,
the Lake Placid Olympic Organizing
Committee (LPOOC) selected one
runner from each state, as well as one
from Washington, D.C. and from
lake Placid itself, in order to fulfill
this tradition.
The LPOOC began their nation
wide search for the torchbearers in
August of 1978 by advertising in run
ning magazines. It was just such a
magazine that Bonnie Warner picked
up while avoiding homework in the
Mt. Baldy, California Public Library.
"I saw this ad that asked 'Would
you like to be a torchbearer?' I said to
myself, 'I know I'll never get it,' but
you can't get anything unless you
send your name in. Then I looked at
the running times and thought I had
no chance. I'm real slow. ! just run for
the fun of it."
The torchbearers are not all-star
athletes. The only athletic require
ment on the application was that they
be able to run three miles at a 7Vi
minute pace, 'he only other condi

tion was that there were no condi
tions. The torchbearers are all shapes
and sizes.
There is a 44-year-old doctor from
Arizona, a 32-year-old from Kansas, a
45-year-old banker from Alabama.
The fastest time was run by a 15-
year-old. The runners are divided
evenly, 26 males and 26 females and
of ages between 15 and 56 years.
As for Bonnie, she is a typical 17-
year-old college freshman. Fler dorm
room is plastered with Olympic post
ers and runners, excluding the Terri
ble Towel that her roommate, a native
of Pittsburgh, has draped in one
corner. Her bed is covered with a
quilt decorated with the symbol of
the Lake Placid Games, the raccoon.
And she is an amateur among
amateurs. "I started running in high
school to get in shape tor field hoc
key," said Bonnie, a member of the
field hockey team on the Farm.
"When I heard I was a finalist, I began
running every chance I got. I ran to
school, I ran from school, I ran to
work."
That's running to school as in a
V-mile run. Each way. "I only ran
every other day, and only in one di
rection," Warner said.
There were five finalists from each
of the 52 areas, 260 in all. Each one
had a personal interview in March of
last year, as well as a final test of a
five-kilometer run whilst carrying a
torch.
"They just wanted to get to know
me," Warner said. "They asked me
about hockey, about Girl Scouts — I
think they wanted outdoorsy-type
people."
On April 1, Warner received a call
from Lake Placid —a call of congratu
lations. And then the real training be
gan.
"We had to meet their training
schedule by lanuary 1 — four miles at
a 7'/<-minute pace. That wasn't so
tough. We had orientation in )uly in
lake Placid. A week before I went

there, I broke my ankle at a field hoc
key camp in Virginia — it was Friday
the 13th," Warner laughed.
Orientation included a tour of the
facilities as well as a general initiation
as to the responsibilities of each run
ner. The 52 runners will converge
upon Yorktown, Va. ( next week to
betjin theB2o-mile trek to Lake Placid.
They will meet the flame there, which
will arrive from Greece via jet to
Langley Air Force Base, then by Navy
launch to Yorktown Harbor.
The route takes the torch wholly on
backroads, hitting every historical
landmark between the two points.
Yorktown was chosen because it was
the site of the surrender of the British
in the Revolutionary War. They go
from there to Colonial Williamsburg
and through Ml. Vernon
(Washington's burial ground) to
Washington, D.C.
After a ceremony at the Capitol the
run continues up the East Coast,
through Philadelphia, where they will
run up the steps that Rocky immor
talized, then to New York City.
The torch will continue through
Hyde Park, N.Y. (the burial site of
Franklin Roosevelt), and then will be
split, with the runners carrying the
flame around each side of the
Adirondacks before meeting in Lake
Placid on February 8.
The flame will be kept in a 6U-toot
protective lamp in Lake Placid until
the Opening Ceremonies five days la
ter.
Once there, the runners will prac
tice constantly until the Opening
Ceremonies. All 52 will participate in
the awards ceremony each night, as
well as continue practice for their role
in the closing ceremonies.
"We have to practice for the Clos
ing Ceremonies from midnight to 6
a.m.," Warner groaned. "It's the only
time the ice will be open. I don't plan
on getting much sleep."
To meet her increased load of re
sponsibility, Warner has increased
her daily running regimen to an aver

age of 7 to 9 miles per day. "Some
days I do sprints, some days I run
from Half Moon Bay. It's about 30
miles. Pve done lots of running re
cently," the bubbly blonde under
stated. "The closest thing I have to a
trainer is my roommate. When it's
seven in the morning and I don't want
to go running, she gets me up."
In addition to increasing her dis
tances, Warner has been preparing

backroads, hitting every historical
landmark between the two points.
Yorktown was chosen because it was
the site of the surrender of the British
in the Revolutionary War. They go
from there to Colonial Williamsburg
and through Ml. Vernon
(Washington's burial ground) to
Washington, D.C.
After a ceremony at the Capitol the
run continues up the East Coast,
through Philadelphia, where they will
run up the steps that Rocky immor
talized, then to New York City.
The torch will continue through
Hyde Park, N.Y. (the burial site of
Franklin Roosevelt), and then will be
split, with the runners carrying the
flame around each side of the
Adirondacks before meeting in Lake
Placid on February 8.
The flame will be kept in a 6U-toot
protective lamp in Lake Placid until
the Opening Ceremonies five days la
ter.
Once there, the runners will prac
tice constantly until the Opening
Ceremonies. All 52 will participate in
the awards ceremony each night, as
well as continue practice for their role
in the closing ceremonies.
"We have to practice for the Clos
ing Ceremonies from midnight to 6
a.m.," Warner groaned. "It's the only
time the ice will be open. I don't plan
on getting much sleep."
To meet her increased load of re
sponsibility, Warner has increased
her daily running regimen to an aver

age of 7 to 9 miles per day. "Some
days I do sprints, some days I run
from Half Moon Bay. It's about 30
miles. Pve done lots of running re
cently," the bubbly blonde under
stated. "The closest thing I have to a
trainer is my roommate. When it's
seven in the morning and I don't want
to go running, she gets me up."
In addition to increasing her dis
tances, Warner has been preparing
for the package she will carry. "The
torch weighs about two pounds. I've
been carrying a steel bar that weighs
about IVi pounds for practice," she
said.
When she quits practicing and it is
time for the real thing, Warner will be
ready. "Ever since I was a kid, I always
wanted to go to the Olympics. When
we used to make a list of things we
always wanted to do, I would write
that down."
The Games are more to Warner
than just the fulfillment of a dream.
One of the essays she had to write in
application tor the role of California's
torchbearer asked how she could
contribute to the Olympic spirit.
"In a serious, all-out endeavor such
as the Olympics," Warner wrote,
"what we need is a little bit ot humor,
of camaraderie, of spirit. After all,
laughter is the same in any lan
guage."
With all the preparation completed
and the run to Lake Placid about to
commence, there is still one tor
chbearing position yet to be filled:
the one who actually lights the torch
in the Olympic Stadium.
"One of the 52 is chosen to run up
the stairs, but they won't say who
until an hour before the start of the
Games," Warner said. When asked
what her chances were of being that
torchbearer, she blushed and
laughed. "Zero — I don't have the
fancy running style ol the person who
lights it. I don't have a chance."
Funny, that is what she said when
she applied for her present role.

For the thousands of athletes who
will descend upon the tiny hamlet of
Lake Placid next month for the 1980
Winter Olympics, their arrival will be
just the beginning of a years-long
journey filled with practice, sweat,
aches and tears. Yet they still may re
turn home crushed, deserted by the
very skills that had brought them to
the pinnacle of athletic achievement.
For Stanford freshman Bonnie
Warner, the road to Lake Placid
began just over a year ago as a diver
sion from studying. And Bonnie does
not have to worry about seeing her
preparation go down the tubes in de
feat, because for her, getting there
will be all the fun.
As a matter of fact, without Bonnie
Warner, the 1980 Winter Olympics
cannot start. She's carrying the torch.
The Olympic torch has traditionally
been relayed from Olympia to the site
of the Games on foot. In many cases,
the torch has been run from one end
of the host country to the other.
That endeavor not being feasible,
the Lake Placid Olympic Organizing
Committee (LPOOC) selected one
runner from each state, as well as one
from Washington, D.C. and from
lake Placid itself, in order to fulfill
this tradition.
The LPOOC began their nation
wide search for the torchbearers in
August of 1978 by advertising in run
ning magazines. It was just such a
magazine that Bonnie Warner picked
up while avoiding homework in the
Mt. Baldy, California Public Library.
"I saw this ad that asked 'Would
you like to be a torchbearer?' I said to
myself, 'I know I'll never get it,' but
you can't get anything unless you
send your name in. Then I looked at
the running times and thought I had
no chance. I'm real slow. ! just run for
the fun of it."
The torchbearers are not all-star
athletes. The only athletic require
ment on the application was that they
be able to run three miles at a 7Vi
minute pace, 'he only other condi

tion was that there were no condi
tions. The torchbearers are all shapes
and sizes.
There is a 44-year-old doctor from
Arizona, a 32-year-old from Kansas, a
45-year-old banker from Alabama.
The fastest time was run by a 15-
year-old. The runners are divided
evenly, 26 males and 26 females and
of ages between 15 and 56 years.
As for Bonnie, she is a typical 17-
year-old college freshman. Fler dorm
room is plastered with Olympic post
ers and runners, excluding the Terri
ble Towel that her roommate, a native
of Pittsburgh, has draped in one
corner. Her bed is covered with a
quilt decorated with the symbol of
the Lake Placid Games, the raccoon.
And she is an amateur among
amateurs. "I started running in high
school to get in shape tor field hoc
key," said Bonnie, a member of the
field hockey team on the Farm.
"When I heard I was a finalist, I began
running every chance I got. I ran to
school, I ran from school, I ran to
work."
That's running to school as in a
V-mile run. Each way. "I only ran
every other day, and only in one di
rection," Warner said.
There were five finalists from each
of the 52 areas, 260 in all. Each one
had a personal interview in March of
last year, as well as a final test of a
five-kilometer run whilst carrying a
torch.
"They just wanted to get to know
me," Warner said. "They asked me
about hockey, about Girl Scouts — I
think they wanted outdoorsy-type
people."
On April 1, Warner received a call
from Lake Placid —a call of congratu
lations. And then the real training be
gan.
"We had to meet their training
schedule by lanuary 1 — four miles at
a 7'/<-minute pace. That wasn't so
tough. We had orientation in )uly in
lake Placid. A week before I went

there, I broke my ankle at a field hoc
key camp in Virginia — it was Friday
the 13th," Warner laughed.
Orientation included a tour of the
facilities as well as a general initiation
as to the responsibilities of each run
ner. The 52 runners will converge
upon Yorktown, Va. ( next week to
betjin theB2o-mile trek to Lake Placid.
They will meet the flame there, which
will arrive from Greece via jet to
Langley Air Force Base, then by Navy
launch to Yorktown Harbor.
The route takes the torch wholly on
backroads, hitting every historical
landmark between the two points.
Yorktown was chosen because it was
the site of the surrender of the British
in the Revolutionary War. They go
from there to Colonial Williamsburg
and through Ml. Vernon
(Washington's burial ground) to
Washington, D.C.
After a ceremony at the Capitol the
run continues up the East Coast,

The torch will continue through
Hyde Park, N.Y. (the burial site of
Franklin Roosevelt), and then will be
split, with the runners carrying the
flame around each side of the
Adirondacks before meeting in Lake
Placid on February 8.
The flame will be kept in a 6U-toot
protective lamp in Lake Placid until
the Opening Ceremonies five days la
ter.
Once there, the runners will prac
tice constantly until the Opening
Ceremonies. All 52 will participate in
the awards ceremony each night, as
well as continue practice for their role
in the closing ceremonies.
"We have to practice for the Clos
ing Ceremonies from midnight to 6
a.m.," Warner groaned. "It's the only
time the ice will be open. I don't plan
on getting much sleep."
