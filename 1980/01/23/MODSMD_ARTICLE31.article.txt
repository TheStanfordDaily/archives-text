## The 						1936 Olympics: evidence for or against a boycott? 
### 
The Washington Post
"Of course, the United
States should not withdraw
trom the 1936 Olympics.
"Why should I, or any other
athlete, be penalized for the
actions of Joe Zilch, or anybody
else named Hitler who has no
thing whatsoever to do with
us?"
-Eleanor Holm
Sept. 7, 1935, in the
Washington Post
In September 1935 Adolf Hi
tler had been in power le*ss
than three years; the invasion
of the Rhineland was six
months away, Auschwitz,
Buchenwald and Dachau were

still just names of far away
places, not landmarks of hor
ror.
In the summer of 1936,
Eleanor Holm, "the champion
American mermaid," was
caught sipping champagne
aboard the S.S. Manhattan or
the way to the Olympics in Ber
lin and was barred from com
petition. "I got more publicity
than Hitler," she says now.
On Sept. 15, 1935, Hitler
enacted the Nuremberg Laws
that deprived lews of German
citizenship. Not everyone in
the United States thought he
was "|oe Zilch."
Members of the American
Jewish community of labor un

ions and of leftist organiza
tions, all led bv Judge Jeremiah
Mahoney, president of (he
Amateur Athletic: Union (AAU),
tried and tailed to organize a

boycott of what has become to
be known as "the Nazi Olym
pics."
Compared to 1%0, "it (the
boycott government) was fee
ble and abortive," said Sam
Baiter, who won a gold medal

on the U.S. basketball team
and was the first Jewish athlete
selected for the 1936 team.
"The American public knew
practically nothing about it." A

Gallup poll taken in 1936 found
a 57 to 43 percent majority
against boycotting.
In recent weeks, as President
Jimmy Carter's proposed with
drawal from the 1980 Olympics
in Moscow has gained momen

turn, government officials,
athletes and sportswriters have
pointed to the 1936 games as
evidence that the United States
should or should not compete

in July.
On Jan. 1, Rolf Pauls, the
West German ambassador to
NATO said, "If the world had
boycotted Hitler's 1936 Olym
pics, the course of history
might have been different."

Last week, Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance said, "I look back
to the 1936 Games, when I was
in college, and I think in
hindsight that it was a mistake
for us to attend the 1936 Olym
pics. Obviously, that affects my
thinking about the current
situation."
The State Department offi
cial said the historical prece
dent had entered his thinking
— particularly the potential for
propaganda. But athletes who
participated in the 1936 Games
and historians do not believe
the situations are necessarily
parallel.
"It's not similar," said Holm,
who supports the 1980 boycott.

"Here the Russians are a defi
nite threat, they've already
gone into another country. I
don't think Hitler was believed
to be such a threat back then."
Back then, in the early 19305,
America was still "wallowing in
the Depression," said lames
Shaenton, professor of Ameri
can History at Columbia Uni
versity.
In 1936, the boycott move- |
ment "flowed from the bottom
up," said Mark Mason, a pro
fessor of history at Fordham
University. "It was grass
roots."
In 1980, Mason points out,
"This is a movement from the
top down."

tions, all led bv Judge Jeremiah
Mahoney, president of (he
Amateur Athletic: Union (AAU),
tried and tailed to organize a

boycott of what has become to
be known as "the Nazi Olym
pics."
Compared to 1%0, "it (the
boycott government) was fee
ble and abortive," said Sam
Baiter, who won a gold medal

on the U.S. basketball team
and was the first Jewish athlete
selected for the 1936 team.
"The American public knew
practically nothing about it." A

Gallup poll taken in 1936 found
a 57 to 43 percent majority
against boycotting.
In recent weeks, as President
Jimmy Carter's proposed with
drawal from the 1980 Olympics
in Moscow has gained momen

turn, government officials,
athletes and sportswriters have
pointed to the 1936 games as
evidence that the United States
should or should not compete

in July.
On Jan. 1, Rolf Pauls, the
West German ambassador to
NATO said, "If the world had
boycotted Hitler's 1936 Olym
pics, the course of history
might have been different."

Last week, Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance said, "I look back
to the 1936 Games, when I was
in college, and I think in
hindsight that it was a mistake
for us to attend the 1936 Olym
pics. Obviously, that affects my
thinking about the current
situation."
The State Department offi
cial said the historical prece
dent had entered his thinking
— particularly the potential for
propaganda. But athletes who
participated in the 1936 Games
and historians do not believe
the situations are necessarily
parallel.
"It's not similar," said Holm,
who supports the 1980 boycott.

"Here the Russians are a defi
nite threat, they've already
gone into another country. I
don't think Hitler was believed
to be such a threat back then."
Back then, in the early 19305,
America was still "wallowing in
the Depression," said lames
Shaenton, professor of Ameri
can History at Columbia Uni
versity.
In 1936, the boycott move- |
ment "flowed from the bottom
up," said Mark Mason, a pro
fessor of history at Fordham
University. "It was grass
roots."
In 1980, Mason points out,
"This is a movement from the
top down."
