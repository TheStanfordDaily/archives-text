# Cagers win displeasingly, 73-56

Dotty McCrea is a hard
woman to please. Just ask any
of the Stanford women bas
ketball players.
The host Cardinals rolled
over visiting UOP 73-56 Monday
night behind an outstanding
32-point, 17-rebound perfor
mance by Jeanne Ruark. But
head coach McCrea wasn't en
tirely pleased.
"We just can't seem to play
40 minutes of inspired basket
ball," said McCrea. "We can't
put a team away. The girls go
on the court thinking it would
be nice to win instead of want
ing to win. There is a differ
ence."
The difference Monday
night was the inspired play of
the 6-foot sophomore Ruark.
Hitting an uncanny 14-of-16
from the field and 4-of-4 from
the charity stripe, she paved
the way to victory for the 11-9
Cards.
Ruark canned her first seven
shots, stalking the team to an
early seven-point lead, 24-17.
UOP, however, aided by sev
eral sloppy Card turnovers, cut
the lead to two by the half.

But the lady hoopsters came
out running to open the final 20
minutes. Debbie Gore scored
two quick layups, Angie Pac
cione made two spectacular
swipes and before the Tigers
could say "Jeanne Ruark," the
Cards had streaked to 14 un
answered points, eventually
upping that to a 20-2 margin
within the first six-and-one
half minutes.
And what did Coach McCrea
say to the squad at halftime to
get them that fired up?
"I told them that if we didn't
get going, we'd get beat. UOP
out-rebounded and out-shot
us in the first half," said an un
impressed McCrea.
True to form, though, the
high level of intensity charac
terizing the Cards' play in the
first 10 minutes of the second
half did not last. In fact, said
McCrea, they played "terrible"
in the final six minutes.
But they won, nevertheless,
and must now look ahead to
the remaining NorCal confer
ence games. Now 3-1 in con
ference play and winner of six
straight home games, the

Cards, according to McCrea,
need "distributed scoring" to
be successful.
And "we've got to win at
home," declared McCrea,
"because the road games are
going to be rough. USF is going
to be very difficult and

elsewhere, we're going to have
to play exceptionally well on
the road," she added.
And winning on the road, as
the UOP Tigers will tell you,
isn't that easy. But to please
Dotty McCrea, the Card
women had better.
