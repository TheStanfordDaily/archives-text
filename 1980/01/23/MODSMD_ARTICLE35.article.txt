Soviets banish Nobel Laureate
Moscow — In a stunning new blow to East-West
detente that also effectively throttles the tiny but
vocal Soviet dissident movement, the Kremlin yes
terday sent Nobel Laureate Andrei Sakharov and
his wife into internal exile in the closed regional
city of Gorky and left hanging the threat of even
tual expulsion from Russia or arrest.
The noted physicist — considered a hero by the
Kremlin for his work on the hydrogen bomb, then
an enemy when he joined the dissidents in the
1960s —was accused of "subversive work" against
the state and stripped of all honors.
Family members permitted to accompany
Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner to
Domodedovo airport in a police van said they saw
the Sakharovs board a TU-134 aircraft and the
plane take off for Gorky, on the Volga River 250
miles from Moscow.
The decision to silence Sakharov and his wife,
Elena Bonner, also an activist, comes amidst the
world crisis set off by the Russian invasion of Af
ghanistan, and achieves two leadership aims: to
insult President Jimmy Carter for his retaliations in
the aftermath of the Soviet invasion and for his
personal support of Sakharov and the dissidents'
cause, and to further suppress dissent prior to the
opening next July of the Moscow summer Olym
pics. However, the move may result in other world
leaders joining Carter's call for an Olympic
boycott.
In several recent interviews with Western
newsmen, Sakharov has supported an Olympic
boycott and called on the world to take steps to
force Russia to withdraw its troops from Afghanis
tan. The government newspaper Izvestia indicated
in its brief announcement that these interviews
had brought the reprisals against him, which indi
cates how deeply stung Moscow is over the bitter
world reaction to its intervention.
"Sakharov lately embarked on the road of open
calls to reactionary circles of imperialist states to
interfere in the USSR's internal affairs," Izvestia
said.
Although stripped of the honors he garnered as
the "wunderkind" of Soviet science in the 19505,
and early 19605, Sakharov apparently retains
membership in the powerful Academy of Sci
ences, to which he has belonged for more than 20
years. His membership until now had protected
him from direct reprisals from the Kremlin.
Such blunt and crude handling of an Academi
cian, a revered title in Russia, is being interpreted
here as yet another sign of the toughened internal
policies of the KGB secret police against liberal
voices.
His exile also marks the virtual end of the era of
strong dissident activity in the country, which was
fostered by the 1970s U.S.-Soviet detente. In the
past three months, more than 40 less well-known
activists have been rounded up, including human
rights dissidents Tatyana Velikanova and Viktor
Nekipelov and dissident Russian Orthodox priests
Gleb Yakunin and Dmitri Dudko.
Pakistan requests 'credible' aid
Islamabad, Pakistan — Pakistan is asking "several
billion dollars" in military aid from the United
States as well as a binding, long-term defense tre
aty, a senior Pakistan government official said yes
terday.
President /ia ul-Haq and his foreign affairs ad
viser and de facto foreign minister, Agha Shahi,
had earlier expressed displeasure with the present
U.S.-Pakistan defense treaty, which dates from
1959, and had described President limmy Carter's
offer of $400 million as "peanuts" in Zia's word,
and "inadequate" in Shahi's. Neither had put a
figure on what they really wanted, however.
"Theassistance must becommensurate with the
size of the threat," Shahi said. He also said that it
should be "credible military and economic assis
tance which should be durable and serve to
strengthen (Pakistan's) security vis-a-vis the threat
developing on its western frontier."
Shahi made it clear that although Pakistan ex
pected continued military aid from China, follow

ing just-concluded talks with Chinese Foreign
Minister Huang Hua, it could only modernize its
forces with equipment from the United States and
other Western countries.
Shahi appeared upset by widespread reports
that a trilateral joint strategic arrangement bet
ween the United States, China and Pakistan was
emerging in the face of the Soviet incursion into
Afghanistan.
"Our relations with the People's Republic of
China are strictly bilateral and nothing has hap
pened to give it a trilateral configuration," he said.
"There is no question of any Washington-
Islamabad-Peking axis."
Shahi also said that the Soviets had indicated a
readiness for dialogue with Pakistan. He did not
elaborate.
Carter considers draft proposal
Washington — President Jimmy Carter is consid
ering a proposal that he ask Congress to authorize
a peacetime registration of draft-age youths, ad
ministration sources said yesterday.
The sources said they were uncertain who made
the proposal but added that they believed it came
from within the White House staff.
The sources, who asked not to be identified,
also said they were uncertain whether Carter
would accept the proposal and whether he would
include such a request to Congress in his State of
the Union address tonight.
If he does so, Carter will be changing his ad
ministration's position on the question of a
peacetime registration. White House spokesmen
declined comment on the issue last night.
In July, the White House said, "The administra
tion is opposed to registration" and that "it is not
necessary to impose this burden on our nation and
its youth."
But senior military officers, noting that the
Army, National Guard and Reserve are below
strength and in large part are unprepared for early
deployment, have said it could be fatal to U.S.
security if the country lacked some effective
standby draft machinery in the event the Soviets
launched an attack on Western Europe.
Gold, silver prices take a tumble
New York — The giddying rise in gold prices
came to a crashing halt yesterday as the price of
the metal plummeted both in Europe and New
York, closing down $143 to $683 an ounce here.
The gold collapse came as the Chicago Board of
Trade put a halt to all new futures trading in silver
for the next three months, a day after New York's
Commodity Exchange virtually shut down its en
tire silver futures operation.
Both exchanges acted because they are afraid
there is not enough silver around to satisfy all the
customers who might demand delivery of the pre
cious metal when their futures contracts expire:
during February in Chicago and during March in
New York.
The price of silver fell $10, closing at $34 an
ounce.
Public support of defense grows
New York — Faced with American hostages in
Iran and Soviet troops marching into Afghanistan,
public support for spending more on U.S. defense
and the military has jumped dramatically to the
highest level in a decade, the Associated Press-
NBC News Poll says.
The objective of more defense spending is to
gain military superiority over the Soviet Union, the
public says.
The strong support for a bigger military budget
is a historic change in American opinion. From the
early 1970s and the Vietnam war until a month ago,
there has been a consistent sentiment for cutting
defense spending. That sentiment has now been
decisively reversed.
Sixty-three percent of those questions Thursday
and Friday said they back increasing the U.S. de
fense budget. Twenty-one percent advocated
keeping defense spending at its current level and
only 8 percent called for a decrease. Another 8

percent of the 1595 adults interviewed nationwide
by telephone were not sure.
Affirmative action fails in court
Sacramento — In a ruling that could end minority
admissions programs at University of California
professional schools, a state appeals court says it is
unconstitutional to give any preference to applic
ants on the basis of race.
The 2-1 decision Monday at the 3rd District
Court of Appeal goes much further than the U.S.
Supreme Coutrt's 1978 Bakke decision in attacking
so-called affirmative action programs.
The state appeals court said race may not be
considered, with or without quotas.
"A policy of preference for certain ethnic or
racial groups unrelated to merit' . . . injects into
our professions an element of calculated medioc
rity," said the majority opinion by justice George
Paras, endorsed by Presiding Justice Robert Pug
lia.
In dissent, justice Cruz Reynoso said the major
ity opinion turns constitutional rules designed to
promote equality "into swords to be used against
those whom the constitution seeks 'o protect."
UC lawyer Donald Reidhaar said yesterday that
the decision would be appealed to the state Sup
reme Court.
Search begun for escaped spy
Lompoc — Christopher Boyce, one of two young
Californians convicted in 1977 of delivering copies
of classified U.S. defense documents to Soviet
agents, has escaped from the federal maximum
security prison here, a prison spokesman said yes
terday.
Milt Edman, executive assistant to the warden at
Lompoc, said that "escape paraphernalia" includ
ing tinships and a makeshift ladder were found at
the rear fence of the maximum-security prison 150
miles northwest of Los Angeles. The search of the
grounds was conducted after Boyce was missing at
the 10 p.m. prisoner count Monday.
Andrew Lee, sentenced to life in prison in the
same case, remained in custody at Lompoc today.
Boyce, the son of a former FBI agent, was serving
40 years for his part in the case.
The story of how Boyce and Lee obtained and
delivered U.S. satellite secrets to Russian agents
was the subject of a 1979 book The Falcon and the
Snowman by Robert Lindsey, a New York Times
reporter.
Boyce, 26, was imprisoned june 20, 1977, for
communicating and transmitting information to a
foreign government, after a Los Angeles federal
court jury deliberated three hours.
Stocks suffer losses yesterday
New York — Gold and silver issues were the
biggest losers as the stock market posted a broad
loss yesterday. Trading was active.
Gold fell to below $700 an ounce, from the
neighborhood of $850 an ounce Monday, and
silver prices tumbled to the $36-$37 arange from
the mid-s4os.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials drop
ped 6.57 to 866.21.
Declines outnumbered advances by a 9-5 mar
gin on the New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume totaled 50.62 million shares,
against 48.04 million in the previous session.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index tumbled 5.39 t0261.00, ending a string
of 12 consecutive gains.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy morning
fog locally, dense in the North Bay. Warm days and
cool nights. Lows in the upper 30s and 40s. Highs
in the 60s. Variable winds to 15 mph.
Mostly fair Friday through Sunday. Turning a
little cooler with highs in the upper 50s and 60s
Friday cooling to mostly 50s Sunday. Lows in the
mid 30s to mid 40s at low elevations. Morning fog
south end. Lows in the mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs in
the upper 50s.

Soviets banish Nobel Laureate
Moscow — In a stunning new blow to East-West
detente that also effectively throttles the tiny but
vocal Soviet dissident movement, the Kremlin yes
terday sent Nobel Laureate Andrei Sakharov and
his wife into internal exile in the closed regional
city of Gorky and left hanging the threat of even
tual expulsion from Russia or arrest.
The noted physicist — considered a hero by the
Kremlin for his work on the hydrogen bomb, then
an enemy when he joined the dissidents in the
1960s —was accused of "subversive work" against
the state and stripped of all honors.
Family members permitted to accompany
Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner to
Domodedovo airport in a police van said they saw
the Sakharovs board a TU-134 aircraft and the
plane take off for Gorky, on the Volga River 250
miles from Moscow.
The decision to silence Sakharov and his wife,
Elena Bonner, also an activist, comes amidst the
world crisis set off by the Russian invasion of Af
ghanistan, and achieves two leadership aims: to
insult President Jimmy Carter for his retaliations in
the aftermath of the Soviet invasion and for his
personal support of Sakharov and the dissidents'
cause, and to further suppress dissent prior to the
opening next July of the Moscow summer Olym
pics. However, the move may result in other world
leaders joining Carter's call for an Olympic
boycott.
In several recent interviews with Western
newsmen, Sakharov has supported an Olympic
boycott and called on the world to take steps to
force Russia to withdraw its troops from Afghanis
tan. The government newspaper Izvestia indicated
in its brief announcement that these interviews
had brought the reprisals against him, which indi
cates how deeply stung Moscow is over the bitter
world reaction to its intervention.
"Sakharov lately embarked on the road of open
calls to reactionary circles of imperialist states to
interfere in the USSR's internal affairs," Izvestia
said.
Although stripped of the honors he garnered as
the "wunderkind" of Soviet science in the 19505,
and early 19605, Sakharov apparently retains
membership in the powerful Academy of Sci
ences, to which he has belonged for more than 20
years. His membership until now had protected
him from direct reprisals from the Kremlin.
Such blunt and crude handling of an Academi
cian, a revered title in Russia, is being interpreted
here as yet another sign of the toughened internal
policies of the KGB secret police against liberal
voices.
His exile also marks the virtual end of the era of
strong dissident activity in the country, which was
fostered by the 1970s U.S.-Soviet detente. In the
past three months, more than 40 less well-known
activists have been rounded up, including human
rights dissidents Tatyana Velikanova and Viktor
Nekipelov and dissident Russian Orthodox priests
Gleb Yakunin and Dmitri Dudko.
Pakistan requests 'credible' aid
Islamabad, Pakistan — Pakistan is asking "several
billion dollars" in military aid from the United
States as well as a binding, long-term defense tre
aty, a senior Pakistan government official said yes
terday.
President /ia ul-Haq and his foreign affairs ad
viser and de facto foreign minister, Agha Shahi,
had earlier expressed displeasure with the present
U.S.-Pakistan defense treaty, which dates from
1959, and had described President limmy Carter's
offer of $400 million as "peanuts" in Zia's word,
and "inadequate" in Shahi's. Neither had put a
figure on what they really wanted, however.
"Theassistance must becommensurate with the
size of the threat," Shahi said. He also said that it
should be "credible military and economic assis
tance which should be durable and serve to
strengthen (Pakistan's) security vis-a-vis the threat
developing on its western frontier."
Shahi made it clear that although Pakistan ex
pected continued military aid from China, follow

ing just-concluded talks with Chinese Foreign
Minister Huang Hua, it could only modernize its
forces with equipment from the United States and
other Western countries.
Shahi appeared upset by widespread reports
that a trilateral joint strategic arrangement bet
ween the United States, China and Pakistan was
emerging in the face of the Soviet incursion into
Afghanistan.
"Our relations with the People's Republic of
China are strictly bilateral and nothing has hap
pened to give it a trilateral configuration," he said.
"There is no question of any Washington-
Islamabad-Peking axis."
Shahi also said that the Soviets had indicated a
readiness for dialogue with Pakistan. He did not
elaborate.
Carter considers draft proposal
Washington — President Jimmy Carter is consid
ering a proposal that he ask Congress to authorize
a peacetime registration of draft-age youths, ad
ministration sources said yesterday.
The sources said they were uncertain who made
the proposal but added that they believed it came
from within the White House staff.
The sources, who asked not to be identified,
also said they were uncertain whether Carter
would accept the proposal and whether he would
include such a request to Congress in his State of
the Union address tonight.
If he does so, Carter will be changing his ad
ministration's position on the question of a
peacetime registration. White House spokesmen
declined comment on the issue last night.
In July, the White House said, "The administra
tion is opposed to registration" and that "it is not
necessary to impose this burden on our nation and
its youth."
But senior military officers, noting that the
Army, National Guard and Reserve are below
strength and in large part are unprepared for early
deployment, have said it could be fatal to U.S.
security if the country lacked some effective
standby draft machinery in the event the Soviets
launched an attack on Western Europe.
Gold, silver prices take a tumble
New York — The giddying rise in gold prices
came to a crashing halt yesterday as the price of
the metal plummeted both in Europe and New
York, closing down $143 to $683 an ounce here.
The gold collapse came as the Chicago Board of
Trade put a halt to all new futures trading in silver
for the next three months, a day after New York's
Commodity Exchange virtually shut down its en
tire silver futures operation.
Both exchanges acted because they are afraid
there is not enough silver around to satisfy all the
customers who might demand delivery of the pre
cious metal when their futures contracts expire:
during February in Chicago and during March in
New York.
The price of silver fell $10, closing at $34 an
ounce.
Public support of defense grows
New York — Faced with American hostages in
Iran and Soviet troops marching into Afghanistan,
public support for spending more on U.S. defense
and the military has jumped dramatically to the
highest level in a decade, the Associated Press-
NBC News Poll says.
The objective of more defense spending is to
gain military superiority over the Soviet Union, the
public says.
The strong support for a bigger military budget
is a historic change in American opinion. From the
early 1970s and the Vietnam war until a month ago,
there has been a consistent sentiment for cutting
defense spending. That sentiment has now been
decisively reversed.
Sixty-three percent of those questions Thursday
and Friday said they back increasing the U.S. de
fense budget. Twenty-one percent advocated
keeping defense spending at its current level and
only 8 percent called for a decrease. Another 8

percent of the 1595 adults interviewed nationwide
by telephone were not sure.
Affirmative action fails in court
Sacramento — In a ruling that could end minority
admissions programs at University of California
professional schools, a state appeals court says it is
unconstitutional to give any preference to applic
ants on the basis of race.
The 2-1 decision Monday at the 3rd District
Court of Appeal goes much further than the U.S.
Supreme Coutrt's 1978 Bakke decision in attacking
so-called affirmative action programs.
The state appeals court said race may not be
considered, with or without quotas.
"A policy of preference for certain ethnic or
racial groups unrelated to merit' . . . injects into
our professions an element of calculated medioc
rity," said the majority opinion by justice George
Paras, endorsed by Presiding Justice Robert Pug
lia.
In dissent, justice Cruz Reynoso said the major
ity opinion turns constitutional rules designed to
promote equality "into swords to be used against
those whom the constitution seeks 'o protect."
UC lawyer Donald Reidhaar said yesterday that
the decision would be appealed to the state Sup
reme Court.
Search begun for escaped spy
Lompoc — Christopher Boyce, one of two young
Californians convicted in 1977 of delivering copies
of classified U.S. defense documents to Soviet
agents, has escaped from the federal maximum
security prison here, a prison spokesman said yes
terday.
Milt Edman, executive assistant to the warden at
Lompoc, said that "escape paraphernalia" includ
ing tinships and a makeshift ladder were found at
the rear fence of the maximum-security prison 150
miles northwest of Los Angeles. The search of the
grounds was conducted after Boyce was missing at
the 10 p.m. prisoner count Monday.
Andrew Lee, sentenced to life in prison in the
same case, remained in custody at Lompoc today.
Boyce, the son of a former FBI agent, was serving
40 years for his part in the case.

Affirmative action fails in court
Sacramento — In a ruling that could end minority
admissions programs at University of California
professional schools, a state appeals court says it is
unconstitutional to give any preference to applic
ants on the basis of race.
The 2-1 decision Monday at the 3rd District
Court of Appeal goes much further than the U.S.
Supreme Coutrt's 1978 Bakke decision in attacking
so-called affirmative action programs.
The state appeals court said race may not be
considered, with or without quotas.
"A policy of preference for certain ethnic or
racial groups unrelated to merit' . . . injects into
our professions an element of calculated medioc
rity," said the majority opinion by justice George
Paras, endorsed by Presiding Justice Robert Pug
lia.
In dissent, justice Cruz Reynoso said the major
ity opinion turns constitutional rules designed to
promote equality "into swords to be used against
those whom the constitution seeks 'o protect."
UC lawyer Donald Reidhaar said yesterday that
the decision would be appealed to the state Sup
reme Court.
Search begun for escaped spy
Lompoc — Christopher Boyce, one of two young
Californians convicted in 1977 of delivering copies
of classified U.S. defense documents to Soviet
agents, has escaped from the federal maximum
security prison here, a prison spokesman said yes
terday.
Milt Edman, executive assistant to the warden at
Lompoc, said that "escape paraphernalia" includ
ing tinships and a makeshift ladder were found at
the rear fence of the maximum-security prison 150
miles northwest of Los Angeles. The search of the
grounds was conducted after Boyce was missing at
the 10 p.m. prisoner count Monday.
Andrew Lee, sentenced to life in prison in the
same case, remained in custody at Lompoc today.
Boyce, the son of a former FBI agent, was serving
40 years for his part in the case.
The story of how Boyce and Lee obtained and
delivered U.S. satellite secrets to Russian agents
was the subject of a 1979 book The Falcon and the
Snowman by Robert Lindsey, a New York Times
reporter.
Boyce, 26, was imprisoned june 20, 1977, for
communicating and transmitting information to a
foreign government, after a Los Angeles federal
court jury deliberated three hours.

Soviets banish Nobel Laureate
Moscow — In a stunning new blow to East-West
detente that also effectively throttles the tiny but
vocal Soviet dissident movement, the Kremlin yes
terday sent Nobel Laureate Andrei Sakharov and
his wife into internal exile in the closed regional
city of Gorky and left hanging the threat of even
tual expulsion from Russia or arrest.
The noted physicist — considered a hero by the
Kremlin for his work on the hydrogen bomb, then
an enemy when he joined the dissidents in the
1960s —was accused of "subversive work" against
the state and stripped of all honors.
Family members permitted to accompany
Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner to
Domodedovo airport in a police van said they saw
the Sakharovs board a TU-134 aircraft and the
plane take off for Gorky, on the Volga River 250
miles from Moscow.
The decision to silence Sakharov and his wife,
Elena Bonner, also an activist, comes amidst the
world crisis set off by the Russian invasion of Af
ghanistan, and achieves two leadership aims: to
insult President Jimmy Carter for his retaliations in
the aftermath of the Soviet invasion and for his
personal support of Sakharov and the dissidents'
cause, and to further suppress dissent prior to the
opening next July of the Moscow summer Olym
pics. However, the move may result in other world
leaders joining Carter's call for an Olympic
boycott.
In several recent interviews with Western
newsmen, Sakharov has supported an Olympic
boycott and called on the world to take steps to
force Russia to withdraw its troops from Afghanis
tan. The government newspaper Izvestia indicated
in its brief announcement that these interviews
had brought the reprisals against him, which indi
cates how deeply stung Moscow is over the bitter
world reaction to its intervention.
"Sakharov lately embarked on the road of open
calls to reactionary circles of imperialist states to
interfere in the USSR's internal affairs," Izvestia
said.
Although stripped of the honors he garnered as
the "wunderkind" of Soviet science in the 19505,
and early 19605, Sakharov apparently retains
membership in the powerful Academy of Sci
ences, to which he has belonged for more than 20
years. His membership until now had protected
him from direct reprisals from the Kremlin.
Such blunt and crude handling of an Academi
cian, a revered title in Russia, is being interpreted
here as yet another sign of the toughened internal
policies of the KGB secret police against liberal
voices.
His exile also marks the virtual end of the era of
strong dissident activity in the country, which was
fostered by the 1970s U.S.-Soviet detente. In the
past three months, more than 40 less well-known
activists have been rounded up, including human
rights dissidents Tatyana Velikanova and Viktor
Nekipelov and dissident Russian Orthodox priests
Gleb Yakunin and Dmitri Dudko.
Pakistan requests 'credible' aid
Islamabad, Pakistan — Pakistan is asking "several
billion dollars" in military aid from the United
States as well as a binding, long-term defense tre
aty, a senior Pakistan government official said yes
terday.
President /ia ul-Haq and his foreign affairs ad
viser and de facto foreign minister, Agha Shahi,
had earlier expressed displeasure with the present
U.S.-Pakistan defense treaty, which dates from
1959, and had described President limmy Carter's
offer of $400 million as "peanuts" in Zia's word,
and "inadequate" in Shahi's. Neither had put a
figure on what they really wanted, however.
"Theassistance must becommensurate with the
size of the threat," Shahi said. He also said that it
should be "credible military and economic assis
tance which should be durable and serve to
strengthen (Pakistan's) security vis-a-vis the threat
developing on its western frontier."
Shahi made it clear that although Pakistan ex
pected continued military aid from China, follow

ing just-concluded talks with Chinese Foreign
Minister Huang Hua, it could only modernize its
forces with equipment from the United States and
other Western countries.
Shahi appeared upset by widespread reports
that a trilateral joint strategic arrangement bet
ween the United States, China and Pakistan was
emerging in the face of the Soviet incursion into
Afghanistan.
"Our relations with the People's Republic of
China are strictly bilateral and nothing has hap
pened to give it a trilateral configuration," he said.
"There is no question of any Washington-
Islamabad-Peking axis."
Shahi also said that the Soviets had indicated a
readiness for dialogue with Pakistan. He did not
elaborate.
Carter considers draft proposal
Washington — President Jimmy Carter is consid
ering a proposal that he ask Congress to authorize
a peacetime registration of draft-age youths, ad
ministration sources said yesterday.
The sources said they were uncertain who made
the proposal but added that they believed it came
from within the White House staff.
The sources, who asked not to be identified,
also said they were uncertain whether Carter
would accept the proposal and whether he would
include such a request to Congress in his State of
the Union address tonight.
If he does so, Carter will be changing his ad
ministration's position on the question of a
peacetime registration. White House spokesmen
declined comment on the issue last night.
In July, the White House said, "The administra
tion is opposed to registration" and that "it is not
necessary to impose this burden on our nation and
its youth."
But senior military officers, noting that the
Army, National Guard and Reserve are below
strength and in large part are unprepared for early
deployment, have said it could be fatal to U.S.
security if the country lacked some effective
standby draft machinery in the event the Soviets
launched an attack on Western Europe.
Gold, silver prices take a tumble
New York — The giddying rise in gold prices
came to a crashing halt yesterday as the price of
the metal plummeted both in Europe and New
York, closing down $143 to $683 an ounce here.
The gold collapse came as the Chicago Board of
Trade put a halt to all new futures trading in silver
for the next three months, a day after New York's
Commodity Exchange virtually shut down its en
tire silver futures operation.
Both exchanges acted because they are afraid
there is not enough silver around to satisfy all the
customers who might demand delivery of the pre
cious metal when their futures contracts expire:
during February in Chicago and during March in
New York.
The price of silver fell $10, closing at $34 an
ounce.
Public support of defense grows
New York — Faced with American hostages in
Iran and Soviet troops marching into Afghanistan,
public support for spending more on U.S. defense
and the military has jumped dramatically to the
highest level in a decade, the Associated Press-
NBC News Poll says.
The objective of more defense spending is to
gain military superiority over the Soviet Union, the
public says.
The strong support for a bigger military budget
is a historic change in American opinion. From the
early 1970s and the Vietnam war until a month ago,
there has been a consistent sentiment for cutting
defense spending. That sentiment has now been
decisively reversed.
Sixty-three percent of those questions Thursday
and Friday said they back increasing the U.S. de
fense budget. Twenty-one percent advocated
keeping defense spending at its current level and
only 8 percent called for a decrease. Another 8

percent of the 1595 adults interviewed nationwide

tion is opposed to registration" and that "it is not
necessary to impose this burden on our nation and
its youth."
But senior military officers, noting that the
Army, National Guard and Reserve are below
strength and in large part are unprepared for early
deployment, have said it could be fatal to U.S.
security if the country lacked some effective
standby draft machinery in the event the Soviets
launched an attack on Western Europe.
Gold, silver prices take a tumble
New York — The giddying rise in gold prices
came to a crashing halt yesterday as the price of
the metal plummeted both in Europe and New
York, closing down $143 to $683 an ounce here.
The gold collapse came as the Chicago Board of
Trade put a halt to all new futures trading in silver
for the next three months, a day after New York's
Commodity Exchange virtually shut down its en
tire silver futures operation.
Both exchanges acted because they are afraid
there is not enough silver around to satisfy all the
customers who might demand delivery of the pre
cious metal when their futures contracts expire:
during February in Chicago and during March in
New York.
The price of silver fell $10, closing at $34 an
ounce.
Public support of defense grows
New York — Faced with American hostages in
Iran and Soviet troops marching into Afghanistan,
public support for spending more on U.S. defense
and the military has jumped dramatically to the
highest level in a decade, the Associated Press-
NBC News Poll says.
The objective of more defense spending is to
gain military superiority over the Soviet Union, the
public says.
The strong support for a bigger military budget
is a historic change in American opinion. From the
early 1970s and the Vietnam war until a month ago,
there has been a consistent sentiment for cutting
defense spending. That sentiment has now been
decisively reversed.
Sixty-three percent of those questions Thursday
and Friday said they back increasing the U.S. de
fense budget. Twenty-one percent advocated
keeping defense spending at its current level and
only 8 percent called for a decrease. Another 8

percent of the 1595 adults interviewed nationwide
by telephone were not sure.
Affirmative action fails in court
Sacramento — In a ruling that could end minority
admissions programs at University of California
professional schools, a state appeals court says it is
unconstitutional to give any preference to applic
ants on the basis of race.
The 2-1 decision Monday at the 3rd District
Court of Appeal goes much further than the U.S.
Supreme Coutrt's 1978 Bakke decision in attacking
so-called affirmative action programs.
The state appeals court said race may not be
considered, with or without quotas.
"A policy of preference for certain ethnic or
racial groups unrelated to merit' . . . injects into
our professions an element of calculated medioc
rity," said the majority opinion by justice George
Paras, endorsed by Presiding Justice Robert Pug
lia.
In dissent, justice Cruz Reynoso said the major
ity opinion turns constitutional rules designed to
promote equality "into swords to be used against
those whom the constitution seeks 'o protect."
UC lawyer Donald Reidhaar said yesterday that
the decision would be appealed to the state Sup
reme Court.
Search begun for escaped spy
Lompoc — Christopher Boyce, one of two young
Californians convicted in 1977 of delivering copies
of classified U.S. defense documents to Soviet
agents, has escaped from the federal maximum
security prison here, a prison spokesman said yes
terday.
Milt Edman, executive assistant to the warden at
Lompoc, said that "escape paraphernalia" includ
ing tinships and a makeshift ladder were found at
the rear fence of the maximum-security prison 150
miles northwest of Los Angeles. The search of the
grounds was conducted after Boyce was missing at
the 10 p.m. prisoner count Monday.
Andrew Lee, sentenced to life in prison in the
same case, remained in custody at Lompoc today.
Boyce, the son of a former FBI agent, was serving
40 years for his part in the case.
The story of how Boyce and Lee obtained and
delivered U.S. satellite secrets to Russian agents
was the subject of a 1979 book The Falcon and the
Snowman by Robert Lindsey, a New York Times
reporter.
Boyce, 26, was imprisoned june 20, 1977, for
communicating and transmitting information to a
foreign government, after a Los Angeles federal
court jury deliberated three hours.
