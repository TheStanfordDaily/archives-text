"The key word in Nicaragua today
is reconstruction," said Richard Fa
gan, professor of political science
here, in a lecture at Bechtel Interna
tional Center yesterday.
In an "update" on the progress of
the Sandinista government, Fagan
said, "the implications ot the whole
question of reform, armed struggle
and the Third World extend far
beyond Latin America."
The slogan used by the Saninistas
during their successful campaign to
oust former President Anastasio
Somoza last summer declared "We
are implacable in battle and gener
ous in victory." The subsequent
leadership, called the Government
of National Reconstruction, has been
consistent with that promise, accord
ing to Fagan who returned here in
November from a visit to Nicaragua.
The Sandinistas want "to do jus
tice, to reintegrate — not to tear at
the society. They are inventing a kind
of politics that makes sense," he
said.
"The only policy (the majority of
Nicaraguans have) known is the
Somozan dynasty. It's their sole trad
ition," Fagan said. After 46 years of
"plunder" the new government
must instruct the citizenry to trust
policies. This is a new epoch in
Nicaraguan history," said Fagan.
First group leadership
"There is actually a collective lead
ership in Nicaragua, and it is unpre
cedented," he continued. "They are
attempting to construct a socialism in
the hemisphere which is other than
Cuban socialism. This is extremely
rare, if not non-existant, in the Third
World, and if it succeeds, it will have
contributed to the legitimation that
socialism can deliver goods to the
impoverished but can be humane in
its policies," he concluded.
Fagan was in Managua last summer
during the most critical and decisive
fighting. He spoke of the "incredible
legitimacy" gained by the Sandinista
forces during that time as they
"spearheaded the liberation drive."

Fagan described the phenomena
of popular resistance as "a common
core of hatred directed toward
Somoza," motivating a "unity that
was forced."
At least 75 percent of the popula
tion was "actively engaged in some
form of anti-Somoza opposition," he
said. "Every time Somoza and the Na
tional Guard escalated the attacks it
brought whole new concentric cir
cles of the population into opposi
tion."
Fagan has been affiliated with
numerous Latin American Studies
Committees, authored several arti
cles and been a professor here since
1970.
