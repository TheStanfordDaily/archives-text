# In 1939, liberals called him 'reactionary'
## Douglas: 40 years as justice

(Last of a three-part series)
Arnong the politically liberal of
1939, there was some concern that
the appointment of William O.
Douglas to the United States Sup
reme Court was a mistake.
"A reactionary tool of Wall Street"
was their label for Douglas, the then
40 year-old Chairman of the Sec
urities Exchange Commission (SEC).
Little did they realize that Douglas
would become one of the court's
most outspoken champions of indi
vidual liberty . . . but then again,
neither did anyone else.
"At the time, nobody knew that
civil rights and civil liberties would
become the big issues," said Stan
ford law professor William Cohen.
Cohen, a former law clerk for the late
justice Douglas, spoke recently
about the factors which led to Doug
las' appointment to the high court.
Douglas played a major role in
President Franklin Roosevelt's New
Deal by heading the SEC. According
to Cohen, Douglas was the administ
ration's "strongest, brightest person
in the field of corporate finance."
His work on the SEC was a definite
plus to the Roosevelt administration,
and led to a close friendship between
Douglas and the President, accord
ing to Cohen.
"He (Douglas) had an enormous
reputation as the whiz kid â€” he was

lonly in his 30s during the New Deal
'program," Cohen said.
"When (justice Louis) Brandeis re
tired, Brandeis was known as the
court's expert on financial affairs,"
and so Douglas was a logical re
placement because of his expertise
in corporate organization and fi
nance," Cohen said.
Douglas' friendly relationship with
the President also included participa
tion in Roosevelt's weekly poker
games. "How much those poker
games had to do with the appoint
ment, I really can't say," Cohen
laughed.
Douglas' relationships with the
other U.S. Presidents under which
he worked, howevei, were not al
ways so close. For instance, Douglas
and john F. Kennedy were not espe
cially friendly, said the justice's
former clerk.
"After his inauguration, Kennedy
had appointed Douglas honorary,
honorary," Cohen emphasizes,
"chairman of the Peace Corps. The
Peace Corps in fact really was Doug
las' idea. He (designed) what became
the Peace Corps in the 19505. One of
the reasons Kennedy appointed him
was really more of an apology,"
Cohen said.
Douglas and Lyndon Johnson were
very close friends, Cohen said. In
fact, rumors spread during the 1960
Democratic Convention (which

eventually nominated John Kennedy
for president) that Douglas was
working behind the scenes for
Johnson. But Douglas denied this
and in reality did not support
Johnson because, Cohen quoted
Douglas as saying, "Lyndon Johnson
just doesn't have the knowledge;
he's ignorant of foreign affairs."
"When Douglas and Johnson
would sit down and havedinnerafter
Douglas returned from a trip some
where, he would be telling Johnson
something about Afghanistan or
wherever he had gone, and Johnson
would say, 'why the same thing hap
pened to me in Austin last week.'"
Needless to say, Douglas' relation
ship with Richard Nixon was, at best,
resentful. Douglas believed that
Nixon was the force behind the
then-Rep.Gerald Ford's unsuccess
ful attempt in 1970 to impeach the
justice, Cohen said.
Douglas sat on the bench for 36
years, through the administrations of
six presidents. He wrote more than
1500 opinions, side-by-side with
one-third of the men who ever
served on the court.
Douglas once said "My real claim
to distinction is that I have visited 30
different countries in my life and
never travelled at government ex
pense."
Vet, that is surely not the way that
