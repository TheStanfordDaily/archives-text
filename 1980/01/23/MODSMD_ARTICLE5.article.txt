# Remodeling begun on Medical Center neonatal nursery
## 
### Mary Haber 
The remodeling of the Stanford
Medical Center's Neonatal Inten
sive Care Unit (NICU) has begun
after a lengthy search for a plan
that would satisfy the Santa Clara
Licensing Bureau.
The original plan, submitted in
August 1978, did not provide
enough floor area per baby.
Stanford is one of the few hos
pitals in Northern Calfornia to
have such a unit.
R.C. Benson and Sons started
remodeling Oct. 1.
They originally expected to
finish at the end of May, but have
since asked for a 35-day delay due
to electrical and mechanical prob
lems. Associate Director of
Facilities Gary Rotzin said he ex
pects the project to be completed
in early July, though further de
lays are possible.
The estimated cost of the NICU
is $900,000. Simultaneous renova
tion of the clinical research and
neurosurgery units will bring the
total cost to $1.6 million. There
has been no problem sticking to
the budget, Rotzin said.
The babies have been moved
into temporary quarters for the
duration of the project. The heal
thy newborns are in modified

adult rooms, and the sick infants
are in what used to be the "well
baby" nursery.
Construction noise is the only
problem that has arisen, said Pro
ject Manager Betty Rose and Clin
ical Nursery Coordinator Cecele
Quaintance. Work has been
stopped periodically when the
noise disturbs the patients
nearby.
Quaintance was a head nurse in
the fall of '78 when 40 nurses in
the neonate section threatened to
strike because of a shortage of
space and doctors. She said the
nurses are enthusiastic about the
remodeling and are pleased with
their temporary quarters. Though
the space is overcrowded, it is
better than the conditions were
last fall, she added.
Once the unit is complete, the
center will be licensed to care for
25 infants, Rose said. However
they will be able to take a few
more in case of emergencies.
New features in the unit will be
a treatment room and a special
room for mothers to learn to care
for their child. The intensive care
unit will serve infants from all over
Northern California because Stan
ford is the dispatching center for
units in this part of the state.
