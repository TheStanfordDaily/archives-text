# As elections near in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia
## Sithole rally draws small crowd

The Los Angeles Times
Salisbury, Zimbabwe-Rhodesia
— The Rev. Ndabaningi
Sithole, regarded as one of the
most prominent black political
leaders in Rhodesia, drew only
about 10,000 followers to an
opening rally Sunday in his
campaign to become prime
minister in next month's elec
tions leading to a representa
tive black government.
The Sithole audience con
sisted mainly of his supporters
who were bused to the site in a
park in a nearby black town
ship. It compared to an esti
mated crowd ot 100,000 who
turned out in the same place a
week ago for guerilla leader
Joshua Nkomo, recently re
turned from abroad, and about
40,000 the week before for
former Prime Minister Abel
Muzorewa, a moderate black
leader.
Both Nkomo and Muzorewa
also provided free bus trans
portation for supporters —
with Nkomo also chartering
two trains to bring in additional
throngs. Consequently, the
crowd figures are regarded by
political observers as a mean

ingful indication of popularity
for the three men.
Their political parties, and
that of guerrilla leader Robert
Mugabe, who has yet to return
from exile, are considered the
principal contenders in the
parliamentary elections to be
held under British supervision
during the last three days of
February.
Si thole's relatively small
turnout indicated that his Zim
babwe African National Union
— a name identical to that of
Mugabe's party, save that this
one is called /ANU-Sithole to
show the difference — had lost
some popular support since
winning 12 seats in a par
liamentary election last April.
That mixed black-white gov
ernment headed by
Muzorewa, a bishop in the
Methodist Church, held power
for onlysix months.
The new elections follow a
British-negotiated cease-fire in
the seven-year civil war bet
ween two separate guerrilla
forces and Rhodesian govern
ment troops. The truce is still in
a Iragile state, with a reported
daily average of eight clashes

or other truce violations involv
ing guerrillas and government
soldiers.
Despite the uncertain
cease-fire, the indications of
widespread intimidation ot
black voters by all the groups
seeking their support, Lord
Soames, the interim British
governor, hopes that
Rhodesia, returned to its status
as a British colony after a 14-
year period of self-declared in
dependence, can be granted
its legal independence in early
March.
This act is scheduled to fol
low British-pledged "fair and
free'' elections. The hoped-for
result is that a black govern
ment will be installed with the
capability of restoring stability
and ending black-white fric
tion.
Sithole, 59, appeared undis
turbed by the size of his audi
ence. In his address he called
upon Soames to confine
Rhodesian army auxiliaries to
their camps. Sithole claimed
that the irregulars — estimated
at about 16,000 men — are
mostly former members of

Muzorewa's private army.
Sithole's seventh-hour rally
included hours of music by a
rock band and tribal dancing
by professional troupes. There
were also well-known "spirit
mediums," who went into
frenzied trances and uttered
chants which, translated from
the Shona tribal language, in
cluded pro-Sithole endorse
ments.
Both Nkomo and Muzorewa
were campaigning outside of
Salisbury Sunday.
