The Los Angeles Times
Philippines — Vietnam has rejected informa
tion supplied by a U.S. congressional delegation
which it was hoped would shed new light on the
fate of several hundred Americans missing in
action during the Vietnam war.
Rep. Lester L. Wolff (D-N.Y.), chairman of the
delegation, said he received a message from
Hanoi Sunday not only rejecting the information
but charging that it was a "Chinese plot."
Asked if the Chinese had anything to do with
supplying the information, Wolff said:
"Hell, no. The information came from several
different independent sources and was checked
and rechecked before we gave it to the Viet
namese."
The congressmen turned the information
over to Vietnamese officials during a visit to
Hanoi last week. The Vietnamese promised to
investigate and give a reply, which they have
now done.
Wolff refused to disclose the nature of the
information, which was said to be embarrassing

to Hanoi. He said Hanoi's rejection was unfor
tunate "because it could have cleared up the
whereabouts of the remains of several hundred
Americans."
He added that the nature of the information
"can be released only after we return to the
States and talk with the families of the missing
men."
C)ne source said the information was supplied
by Vietnamese refugees now in the United
States and concerns "a lot of people known to
have been in the hands of the Vietnamese
Communists" who are now dead.
U.S. military officials currently list 2500
Americans, nearly all of them pilots and crew
men, still unaccounted for in Indochina. Almost
90 percent of those shot down in North Viet
nam, Laos and Cambodia have not been ac
counted for. About 500 vanished in Laos.
The Vietnamese have repeatedly stated there
are no living Americans in Indochina, but some
American skeptics say they are "morally con
vinced" there are.
