# Panel urges understanding of Iran

Americans must learn to
view the Iranian crisis from the
"other side of the hill" or from
the perspective of the average
Iranian, Middle East specialist
Dwight Simpson of San Fran
cisco State University said at a
panel discussion on the Iranian
crisis last week.
Lack of information about
"exotic" countries such as
Iran, the ethnocentric bias of
American education and an
inward looking press make it
difficult for Americans to con
sider another point of view,
Simpson said in the discussion
sponsored by the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau.
Americans must "think
beyond the mindless
sloganeering of U.S. politi
cians," Bob Saibel, Stanford
graduate and journalist cover
ing the Iranian revolution ad
ded.
Most Americans believe the
U.S. has been victimized by
Iran and are unaware of detri

mental U.S. government and
corporate activities in Iran, he
said.
Such imperialist interests
and activities are not compati
ble with the interests of the av
erage citizen, Saibel said.
Americans should try to un
derstand the "rage and dis
gust" that Iranians feel toward
U.S. support of the shah's re
gime in the past and present
protection of his safety and
wealth, Simpson said.
For the mass of the Iranian

people, the holding of the hos
tages is the only way to exert
pressure to insure that the U.S.
government will consider their
interests, he said. The crisis
points out the need for "true
diplomacy" based on a clearly
formulated foreign policy,
rather than a policy of reacting
to crisis events, he added.
Ralph Magnuson, former
State Department official and
Mideast expert, disagreed say
ing that Iranian officials are

simply "playing politics with
the embassy situation," hop
ing to regain the revolution's
vitality and popular fervor.
The hostages will be re
leased when factional strug
gles are resolved within Iran,
"regardless of any action the
U.S. will take," he said.
Nevertheless, the present re
gi me is too unstable to become
successfully consolidated, and
a second round of revolution is
soon Id come in Iran, he said.
