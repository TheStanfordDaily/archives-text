# Football coach Dowhower resigns to go to Denver Broncos
## 
### Chris Haft Ivan Maisel 
In a sudden and totally unexpected
move, Rod Dowhower resigned yes
terday after only one year as head
football coach at the University to
become offensive coordinator of the
NFL's Denver Broncos.
The 39-year-old Nebraska native
was elevated to Stanford's head
coaching job last |an. 9 after serving
as an assistant coach for two years
under Bill Walsh, who left to become
head coach ot the San Francisco
49ers. He will report to Denver im
mediately to assume his duties with
the American Football Conference
Western Division team under head
coach Red Miller.
Dowhower, who was unavailable
for comment yesterday, handed his
letter ol resignation to Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger around 9 a.m. yes
terday.
Associate Athletic Director Doug
Single has been named interim head
coach. Single's primary duty will be
to maintain continuity in Stanford's
tootball recruiting until Feb. 20, the
letter-of-intent signing date for re
cruits.
In something ot a coincidence, de
fensive backtield coach George
Seifert announced his resignation
yesterday to join Walsh in a similar
capacity tor the 49ers. Seifert
coached here from 1972-74, took a

head coaching job at Cornell Univer
sity tor two years and returned here
under Walsh three years ago.
Single, Geiger, Associate Athletic
Director Gary Cavalli and Stanford
Athletic Board members Joe Mell and
Frank Lodato met yesterday after
noon to begin organizing a search for
> Dowhower's replacement.
"I've got a lot of first ideas," Geiger
; said concerning a new coach. "There
are a lot ot people in this country that
would be fine football coaches at
i Stanford." Geiger added that the
search would include both the col
legiate and professional ranks.
Dowhower secretive
Dowhower had apparently kept
his intentions to leave a secret.
• Single, who has maintained a close
relationship with Dowhower tor sev
eral years, knew nothing of
Dowhower's intentions.
"Rod and I have been good friends
; for a long time," Single said. "But as
I for his confiding in me . ..he didn't.
■ I had no indication he would be leav
, ing today."
Apparently the only people who
had any indication he was leaving
were in Denver. Despite the sud
denness o112 Dowhower's announce
; ment, he had secretly been talking
i with Bronco officials for almost two
r weeks.
t Although Bronco General Man
i ager Fred Gehrke refused to be

specific, he did say that Miller prob
ably contacted Dowhower during
practice for the East-West Shrine
Game held here Jan. 6, when many
pro football scouts were on campus.
As to how Gehrke learned of
Dowhower's availability, he said
only, "I really can't say how that hap
pened."
Denver could well use a revitalized
offense. Though one of the best de
fensive squad in the NFL, the Bron
cos were saddled with a lackluster
offensive attack. Gehrke said he
thinks that problem will be solved by
Dowhower.
'Experience pro-wise'
"We narrowed it down to three
candidates. He was a logical choice.
He had experience pro-wise, having
worked with (Don) Coryell at St.
Louis (in 1973) and under Walsh at
Stanford. We were basically looking
for an offensive-minded coach,''
Gehrke said.
Dowhower thus makes the sixth
stop in a coaching career that has
lasted 14 years. He entered the field
as an assistant coach under Coryell at
San Diego State in 1966, moving up to
offensive coordinator in 1968.
When Coryell became head coach
of the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals,
Dowhower followed, staying as
quarterback and receiver coach for
one season before returning to the
college ranks as offensive coor

dinator for UCLA in 1974-75.
He then traveled to Boise State, di
recting the offense there tor one sea
son before coming to Stanford under
Walsh.
A major task facing Geiger, Single
and the football staff is to prevent
Dowhower's departure from disrupt
ing recruiting as it enters its final and
most crucial stages.
With the letter-of-intent signing
date less than a month away,
Dowhower's resignation might be
regarded as poorly-timed. No school
wants to be caught in the position of
trying to "sell" itself in the midst of a
coaching change — when the new
coach might be new or unknown or
even non-existent.
Single, however, believes there
will be little or no problem with re
cruiting.
"There will always be an athlete or
two disenchanted because you don't
have a football coach right now,"
Single said. "But there are others
who will say, 'It doesn't make any
difference to me.' "
Geiger said he felt the timing of
Dowhower's move was perfectly un
derstandable.
No hard feelings
"It's silly to feel rancorous about
it ( "theathleticdirectorsaid. "He has
to think about his own welfare. I
don't have a bad taste in my mouth
