# Brodie Lockard at Valley Med
## Gymnast remains paralyzed after December accident 
### Allison Stone 
Eight weeks ago he fell.
Stanford students were busy
thinking of fall quarter finals
and Christmas at home with
their families. Then it hap
pened. At age 19, Brodie Loc
kard found himself paralyzed
from the neck down. Nothing
could have prepared him for
the life that he has been forced
to slowly rebuild.
Brodie, a gymnast here, suf
fered his injury during a prac
tice on the trampoline. He
landed on his neck in the foam
pit and didn't move. He had
displaced his second and third
vertebrae and had tractured his
fifth and sixth. He damaged his

spinal chord and several
nerves, and had problems bre
athing.
Brodie hasn't moved since.
Atter an initial four-day stay
at Stanford Medical Center,
where surgery put the verteb
rae back in place, Brodie was
moved to Santa Clara Valley
Medical Center for special care
in spinal rehabilitation. There
he remains, learning and work
ing to adapt to his changed
body.
"No one can picture what it's
like being there," says janice
"Wes" Vu, a close friend,
"Emotionally, it's really incred
ible."
Recently taken oft a Stryker

frame, which rotated him 180
degrees every two or three
hours and which Brodii him
self describes as "a cross bet
vu • i a bed and the rack," he is
ci. ntly in a hospital bed
eqi ipped with all the neces
sary equipment to • istain him.
"The helplessness of so
much all at once is hard," exp
lains Dr. Dorothy Lockard,
Brodie's mother. "What kind
of activities can you do?"
Vet Brodie has recently made
considerable progress. This
week, doctors were able to get
him in a wheelchair for the lirst
time, where he remained for3o
minutes.
"It was kind of scary," admits

Brodie. "I was very dis
oriented."
He has also learned to hold a
pen in his mouth and draw pic
tures with it. His first drawing
was of a boy in a wheelchair.
This is a skill that Brodie hopes
to perfect soon.
Brodie cannot eat solid food,
and has been ted intravenously
tor the past two weeks. He has
lost 38 pounds, but his mother
notes, "A few days ago, the
doctors told him that he could
have clear liquids. Brodie
turned to me and asked if that
meant Slurpies from 7-11."
Since then, Brodie can't seem
to get enough of them.
Brodie has received over 300
cards and letters from friends
and well-wishers.
"The support of the Stanford
community is what Brodie
needs more than anything, to
help him cope, fight and gain
encouragement," says Dr.
Lockard.
Many students across cam
pus have become involved in
activities to help Brodie. Senior
)ohn Kozlowski, Brodie's
roommate this year in Toyon
Hall, says "You can't be sup
portive once, and then give up.
It's an ongoing thing."
Kozlowski has organized a
"ride board" in Toyon for stu
dents all over campus who
wish to visit Brodie.
In addition, a campus-wide
donation drive has been un
dertaken by Kozlowski and
Toyon to pay for a stereo sys
tem that Brodie could learn to
operate with his chin.
Toyon, where Brodie lived

tor four quarters, isplanningto
show a big-name movie on
campus later this quarter and
use the proceeds to help him
adjust.
Yet the main body of sup
port, outside his parents and
close friends, has been the
Stanford Gymnastics Team.
Gymnast Bob Daniel, a junior
and Brodie's roommate last
year, explains, "For the first
four days, we (the gymnasts)
were at the Stanford Medical

tends to graduate at some time
in the future.
]im Lyons, dean of student
affairs here, says the University
"has given some thought to
taping course lectures in the
future for Brodie, when he's
ready. We've dealt with parap
legics and quadraplegics at
Stanford before. We alter
things to deal with different in
dividuals," he said.
Brodie's parents say they are
pleased with the care that

'He doesn't ever want pity. I know Brodie will
come back to school and get his degree some
day. I just know it/
-A friend

Center's Intensive Care Unit
for at least 16 of every 34 hours.
We went in shifts and usually
two-thirds of the team was al
ways there."
Daniel says that different
gymnasts take several trips a
week to visit with Brodie now.
"It can happen to anyone,"
Daniel said.
Although Brodie is originally
trom Tucson, Arizona, both
parents decided to keep him at
a spinal center here in the Bay
Area.
"Stanford is home. He has
lived here three years, and this
is where he belongs. He needs
the students and gymnasts
more than any medicine," exp
lains Dr. Lockard.
Brodie is on a medical leave
of absence from Stanford for
this winter quarter, but fully in-

Brodie has been given, and are
dealing with the situation one
day at a time.
"Someone can always take
care of your body, but no one
can do anything if you damage
your head. We are grateful that
Brodie still has a good, sharp
mind that he can put to good
use in the future," explains Dr.
Lockard.
Both parents say that visitors
are Brodie's best medicine. But
most new visitors don't know
what to expect or how they
should act when they see him.
Many wonder if he's changed,
and this frightens them, ac
cording to Dr. Lockard.
"I thought that Brodie would
shut down the
emotional end of things when
dealing with people, but he

hasn't. We've become better
friends, because he isn't afraid
to keep developing friend
ships," Yu said.
"It's still Brodie. We didn't
know what to expect, but it was
still Brodie," adds Kozlowski.
He has problems speaking
because he's attached to a re
spirator machine, but "he'sgot
infinite patience. He'll spell
words to you if you have prob
lems understanding him.
Don't be afraid of him, just talk
to him," says Yu.
Visitors are welcome from
noon to 8 p.m. Both students
who know Brodie and well
wishers have stopped by.
This last week, members of
the lapanese Olympic Gym
nastic Team, who were in the
area, made a surprise visit to
wish him well.
Brodie is striving to make his
body work well enough so that
he can get involved back in the
world outside his hospital
room.
He enjoys listening to some
one read his mail or talk with
him during visiting hours.
"Now is the time that Brodie
needs his friends. It's a rough
time for him. People can help
by writing, visiting and just
keeping their thoughts with
him," says Kozlowski.
Brodie seems to be ready to
face the challenges ahead o
him, but he knows that it will
take time. Yu explains, "His pa
rents want him to be indepen
dent. He doesn't ever want
pity. I know Brodie will come
back to school and get his de
gree someday. I just know it."
