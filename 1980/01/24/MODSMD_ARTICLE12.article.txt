# Nuke controversy hits Idaho

The Los Angeles Times
Idaho Falls, Idaho — At the
height of the Korean War, as
the United States rushed
rapidly into the atomic age, the
federal government selected a
900-square-mile site in the de
solate sagebrush desert of
southeastern Idaho to build,
test and tinker with nuclear
reactors.
Reactor research and opera
tions invariably produce
radioactive wastes, and the
government developed vari
ous methods of disposing of
them. Some of the wastes were
solidified and stored in under
ground tanks, some were ven
ted into the air, some were
pumped into ponds to evapo
rate.
And, beginning in
some were routinely flushed
into the Snake River Aquifer, a
vast underground lake that is
Idaho's most important source
of irrigation and drinking wa
ter. Through the years, the
existence and use of the injec
tion well at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory — or
INEL, as the site 50 miles west
of here became known — was

described in government re
ports, studies and environ
mental impact statements —
but no one paid much atten
tion.
Then, a few months ago, the
Lewiston (Idaho) Tribune pub
lished an article based on a
1974 U.S. Geological Survey
study of the practice. The re
port noted that only small por

tions of the aquifer had been
affected*
But because some radioac
tive elements can remain
dangerous for millions of
years, the article touched off a
mushrooming controversy
which for weeks made tront
page news in Idaho and, as it
reverberated to the nation's
capital, brought a major con
frontation between state and
federal officials.
Gov. lohn Evans appointed a
task force that found no im
mediate danger to public
health but urged a halt to the
injection ot radioactive waste
into the aquifier. Federal offi
cials promised to study alterna
tives but warned that an im
mediate end to the practice
would cause an eventual shut
down of the facility, which,
with 9000 workers, is Idaho's

third-largest employer.
The controversy offers an il
lustration of how changing
public attitudes can suddenly
make accepted scientific prac
tices politically unacceptable.
"There's a new set of rules
ever since Three Mile Island,"
a U.S. Department of Energy
official said with a sigh as he
surveyed the Idaho con
troversy. Last spring's accident
at the Pennsylvania nuclear
power plant, he added,
heightened public concern
about "all things nuclear, and
that means what once was OK

isn't anymore."
The controversy also under
scores the slow progress being
made by the government re
garding the perplexing prob
lem of how fo cope with one
legacy of the nuclear era — the
millions of pounds of radioac
tive wastes, some of which will
be dangerous for millions of
vears.
