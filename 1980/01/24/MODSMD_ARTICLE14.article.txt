## Pass curriculum proposal 
### 
Two important curriculum change proposals
are scheduled to come before the Faculty Se
nate today.
The Daily favors passage of both.
This faculty action marks a watershed, we be
lieve, and will likely guide the evolution of un
dergraduate education at Stanford for a long
time to come. This is the first such curriculum
change since the three-category distribution
system was established 11 years ago, following
the demands for greater self-determination of
studies.
Throughout the '70s students were at liberty
to structure their courses of study as they chose.
Career-oriented students could follow
academic programs geared solely to further fu
ture job prospects. Educators theorized that
leaving students to their own devices would fos
ter creativity and enthusiasm.
Unquestionably, many curriculum innova
tions that were developed during this period of
student self-determination — including student
evaluations of faculty and Structured Liberal
Education —are good and should be preserved.
However, in the opinions of many — includ
ing many graduating Stanford seniors polled
each year — the essence of a liberal education
was not obtained here.
The two current faculty proposals, although
only an initial step toward a revamped cur
riculum, are an effort to redress this inequity.
The first proposal would make a three-quarter
sequence in Western Culture mandatory for all
students beginning with the class entering in the
fall of 1980. Six three-course sequences would
be offered, and could be completed at any time
during the undergraduate years. Pilot courses in
Western Culture offered the past two years have
received a favorable response from students.
We live in a Western culture, and a review of
the roots of that culture, the social, political and
literary forces that have shaped it, we believe,
should be part of a Western education.
The second proposal — which the Daily feels
has greater import than the first — would re
quire students to take one course in each of
seven subject areas. This contrasts with the cur
rent three broad categories of courses and the
requirement that students take three courses in
each category.
Completion of the requirements, as under the
old system, would not have to take place in
sequence, nor even in the same academic year.
Thus, students would continue to be afforded
the flexibility they have come to cherish.
The aim of the second proposal is to accom
modate the added units of the Western Culture
proposed requirement, ajid to guide students
more precisely in the selection ot an array of
courses which will expose them to the principal

academic disciplines of today's world. The
seven categories in the second proposal are:
— Literature and the tine arts;
— Philosophical, social and religious
thought;
' — Human development, behavior and lan
guage;
— Social processes and institutions;
— Mathematical sciences;
—Natural sciences and
—Technology and applied sciences.
The total number of required courses would
be 10 — three Western Culture and the various
seven — an increase of only one from the cur
rent three-courses-in-three-categories ar
rangement. One of the courses chosen would
have to focus on a non-Western culture. The
redefined distribution requirements, when
fleshed out with courses yet to be specified by
interdisciplinary faculty panels, should, in our
opinion, assure a more liberally educated Stan
ford student with a minimal increase in work
load.
The crucial phase of the second proposal
would be a faculty scrutinizing and overhaul of
the more than 2000 courses which apply to pre
sent distribution requirements. Under current
plans, a faculty committee would pare down the
list of acceptable courses to several hundred.
The process of deciding what courses, both new
and existing, would apply to the specific re
quirement strands has yet to take place.
The Daily feels that the student body should
play an important role in deciding what existing
or new courses would meetthe newdistribution
requirements. This decisi6n-making process
should be a dialogue between those who teach
the courses, and those who have, and are, tak
ing them.
More students here seem to be clamoring for
added academic direction and guidance, par
ticularly during the uncertain first year of col
lege. The new requirements appear to us to be a
happy medium between educational spoon
feeding and aimless liberty to choose.
Those who may benefit most from the new
program are students locked into a one
dimensional, pre-professional track , who would
be hesitant or hostile to exploring a varied cur
riculum unless compelled. For such students,
the program may awaken interests that other
wise would have remained dormant.
In an ideal world, students would recognize
the importance of a well-rounded background,
and would not need the compulsion of re
quirements. But until that elusive time, when
outside prodding is unnecessary, some struc
ture is beneficial. Without that structure the
Stanford diploma loses its merit as a symbol of
academic well-roundedness.

added academic direction and guidance, par
ticularly during the uncertain first year of col
lege. The new requirements appear to us to be a
happy medium between educational spoon
feeding and aimless liberty to choose.
Those who may benefit most from the new
program are students locked into a one
dimensional, pre-professional track , who would
be hesitant or hostile to exploring a varied cur
riculum unless compelled. For such students,
the program may awaken interests that other
wise would have remained dormant.
In an ideal world, students would recognize
the importance of a well-rounded background,
and would not need the compulsion of re
quirements. But until that elusive time, when
outside prodding is unnecessary, some struc
ture is beneficial. Without that structure the
Stanford diploma loses its merit as a symbol of
academic well-roundedness.
Two important curriculum change proposals
are scheduled to come before the Faculty Se
nate today.
The Daily favors passage of both.
This faculty action marks a watershed, we be
lieve, and will likely guide the evolution of un
dergraduate education at Stanford for a long
time to come. This is the first such curriculum
change since the three-category distribution
system was established 11 years ago, following
the demands for greater self-determination of
studies.
Throughout the '70s students were at liberty
to structure their courses of study as they chose.
Career-oriented students could follow
academic programs geared solely to further fu
ture job prospects. Educators theorized that
leaving students to their own devices would fos
ter creativity and enthusiasm.
Unquestionably, many curriculum innova
tions that were developed during this period of
student self-determination — including student
evaluations of faculty and Structured Liberal
Education —are good and should be preserved.
However, in the opinions of many — includ
ing many graduating Stanford seniors polled
each year — the essence of a liberal education
was not obtained here.
The two current faculty proposals, although
only an initial step toward a revamped cur
riculum, are an effort to redress this inequity.
The first proposal would make a three-quarter
sequence in Western Culture mandatory for all
students beginning with the class entering in the
fall of 1980. Six three-course sequences would
be offered, and could be completed at any time
during the undergraduate years. Pilot courses in
Western Culture offered the past two years have
received a favorable response from students.
We live in a Western culture, and a review of
the roots of that culture, the social, political and
literary forces that have shaped it, we believe,
should be part of a Western education.
The second proposal — which the Daily feels
has greater import than the first — would re
quire students to take one course in each of
seven subject areas. This contrasts with the cur
rent three broad categories of courses and the
requirement that students take three courses in
each category.
Completion of the requirements, as under the
old system, would not have to take place in
sequence, nor even in the same academic year.
Thus, students would continue to be afforded
the flexibility they have come to cherish.
The aim of the second proposal is to accom
modate the added units of the Western Culture
proposed requirement, ajid to guide students
more precisely in the selection ot an array of
courses which will expose them to the principal

academic disciplines of today's world. The
seven categories in the second proposal are:
— Literature and the tine arts;
— Philosophical, social and religious
thought;
' — Human development, behavior and lan
guage;
— Social processes and institutions;
— Mathematical sciences;
—Natural sciences and
—Technology and applied sciences.
The total number of required courses would
be 10 — three Western Culture and the various
seven — an increase of only one from the cur
rent three-courses-in-three-categories ar
rangement. One of the courses chosen would
have to focus on a non-Western culture. The
redefined distribution requirements, when
fleshed out with courses yet to be specified by
interdisciplinary faculty panels, should, in our
opinion, assure a more liberally educated Stan
ford student with a minimal increase in work
load.
The crucial phase of the second proposal
would be a faculty scrutinizing and overhaul of
the more than 2000 courses which apply to pre
sent distribution requirements. Under current
plans, a faculty committee would pare down the
list of acceptable courses to several hundred.
The process of deciding what courses, both new
and existing, would apply to the specific re
quirement strands has yet to take place.
The Daily feels that the student body should
play an important role in deciding what existing
or new courses would meetthe newdistribution
requirements. This decisi6n-making process
should be a dialogue between those who teach
the courses, and those who have, and are, tak
ing them.
