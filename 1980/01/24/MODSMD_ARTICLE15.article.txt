# Minority edit: Defer decision
## 
### 
We support the Western Culture proposal
now before the Faculty Senate. This proposal is
the result ot long and largely fruitful discussion
â€” a dialogue in which many responsible groups
wore allowed to present their input fully and
completely.
We also agree that the proposed revamping of
the distribution requirements.is the more im
portant of the two proposals the Faculty Senate
laces. At present, 2200 existing courses fulfill
one or more of the distribution requirements.
I he purpose of the distribution requirements
ought to be to help assure a well-rounded liberal
arts education. But the huge number of courses
makes something ot a mockery of the require
ment.
A reduction of this 2200 courses is planned,
but just how the selection will be accomplished
has vet to be decided. The process will be a
difficult, but absolutely necessary task it the new
requirements are to mean anything in terms of
aiding a student in receiving a broad general
education here.
We feel that without concrete, specific prop
osals in both areas, the University will suffer in

both the short and long run. Until the current
curriculum examination is complete, no really
coherent program can be presented.
Because of its importance, we believe it is
imperative the Faculty Senate consider a revised
distribution requirement as well thought-out as
the Western Culture series. An ill-prepared new
set of applicable courses would do little to im
prove the quality of liberal arts education here.
Since that is certainly the intention of the Faculty
Senate and others who support the Western
Culture requirement as well as a new distribu
tion requirement, we urge that the senate vote
only when it knows in advance what the con
sequences of its action will be.
We therefore recommend that the Faculty Se
nate defer its decision on both the Western Cul
ture requirement and the general change in the
distribution requirement until the course re
view is completed and the narrowing down ot
applicable courses is complete. Without a cohe
rent program in both areas, no change is better
than piecemeal change.
