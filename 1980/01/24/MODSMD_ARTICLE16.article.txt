## Resist U.S. 'first-strike' 
### 
A front page story in last Fri
day's Los Angeles Times re
ports that "White House and
other national security offi
cials" feel that in the event of a
Soviet move into Pakistan or
Iran, "the United States would
have littlechoice but tooppose
it militarily." Such a conflict,
they believe, "would almost
certainly become a nuclear
war."
Although I am (sadly) no
longer innocent enough to be
lieve this is the first time it has
happened, I am alarmed and
upset that my government is so
clearly willing to consider the
"first-strike" use of nuclear
weapons.
There is a popular belief in
this country, one which allows
us to countenance our build
ing offensive nuclear weapons,
that we will never be the coun
try to initiate a nuclear ex
change. Our offensive capabil
ity is thought to be solely for
the deterrence of a nuclear at
tack on us.
It is this popular attitude
concerning the purpose of our
nuclear arsenal and the public
outrage and sense of betrayal
which violating it would have
created which have held in
check the natural military in
clination to use the bigges,
guns we have.
The current anxiety over
Soviet "expansion" and "ambi
tions" and over the security of
"our" oil supplies have pro
vided an opportunity for the
nuclear hawks to try to per
suade the public that our using
nuclear weapons against
Soviet forces is not out of the
question.
Saner minds, and Stanford

has provided many of these in
the past, need to counter the
currently popular shortsigh
ted, militaristic rhetoric and in
sist that we will not have our
planet irradiated by anyone for
any reason. We cannot afford
to let policy makers even talk
about inviting and invoking
such a disaster without letting
them hear a chorus of unfailing
opposition.
According to DanielEllsberg
one of the best informed civi
lians on U.S. nuclear "de
fense" policy, the main reason
President Nixon didn't "diop
the big one" on Vietnam was
that the public's demonstrated
opposition to his already ag
gressive military policy con
vinced him that it would be
politically disastrous. This
same message must be ur
gently communicated to those

who are now testing (and
agitating) the waters of U.S.
public opinion.
The Times article's
sources say that it is time to
begin public discussion of the
possibility of U.S. military op
tions in the Middle East, since
such discussion is needed to
build a consensus of support
for major policies.
If this is the beginning of a
public debate on U.S. military
and nuclear intervention in
that region, we must argue it
vigorously in congressional
mail boxes, on opinions pages,
in classes, and in the streets,
and if it is a trial balloon, we
must fill it with enough holes
that (at least for several years)
no one will want to fly it again.
