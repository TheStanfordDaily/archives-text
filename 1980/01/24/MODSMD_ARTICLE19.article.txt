# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Seth Zuckerman The 						specter of forced culture is back

I am deeply concerned by
the proposed Western Culture
requirements before the Fa
culty Senate today, both be
cause they represent a step
backward from the progress
achieved 10 years ago in educa
tion when college require
ments were relaxed and be
cause of the Western
ethnocentric attitude they de
note.
Make no mistake — I believe
the Western Culture sequ
ences developed over the past
three years are very thorough,
very sound and certainly very
valuable to those who take
them. It is undeniably impor
tant for students to be exposed
to Sigmund Freud, Plato or St.
Augustine.
But requiring students to
take these courses is essen
tially to say that the University,
not the student, should decide
what the student should take.
Heretical though it may sound,
President Richard Lyman may
not be our Daddy who knows
what is best for us all.
Students who enter a large
university like this one assume
a responsibility to themselves

to make the most ot their ex
perience here. There are no
requirements in the university
of life.
It the function of the Univer
sity is to coddle students and
select what they should take,
bring on the requirement. But
it it purports to educate us for
life and the outside world, let
the Western Culture series re
main optional.
It is admittedly unfortunate
that students emerge from
Stanford without an acquain
tance with the philosophies of
John Locke or )ean-)acques
Rousseau. But requiring
courses to remedy that defi
ciency attacks the symptom,
not the cause. The cause is that
students don't study these
works voluntarily.
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon made a positive stab
at this cause in the letter on
preparatory curricula he sent
to more than 17,000 high
schools.
Forcing 18-, 19- or 20-year
olds to take a sequence, how
ever, would be counter
productive in many ways —
people are less willint; to studv

what is presented to them in
arm-twisting fashion.
We should be trying to fit the
education to the individual,
not the student to the uniform,
standardized education.
And why, for that matter,
should we decree that the
civilization of Aristotle, Moses
or Karl Marx is any more impor
tant than that of Confucius,
Buddha or Lao-Tze> If any re
quirement is to be imposed,
why should it be a Western
Culture requirement and not a
human culture one? The
European-based civilization we
have would do well to take a
leaf from the thinkers of the
Orient.
An ignorance of the most
basic elements of Eastern
civilization is at least as
dangerous as a very partial
view of both culture.
It would be ideal for students
to design their own majors and
programs in conjunction with
their advisers, deciding to
gether how to achieve a broad
education. The distribution
requirements, however, are so
firmly entrenched that their
existence is a moot point.

The Western Culture series
could be incorporated into the
present system. As an incen
tive for students to take the
series, it could satisfy both the
humanities and social sciences
requirements, fulfilling what
would otherwise constitute at
least 18 units in 15 units of
coherent study.
Some people have explained
away my views because I am a
science major. I appeal to you
not to pigeonhole me that way.
It is this sort of cross
disciplinary distrust that feeds
the misguided desire to avoid
departments other than our
own — that same distrust that
makes our elders think they
should impose requirements
on us.
In Western Culture, we have
a sequence of courses that
would throw people into a|
compulsory melting pot that
presents a lopsided, woefully
incomplete picture of human
civilization. But that's alright.
That is, after all, Western cul
ture.
