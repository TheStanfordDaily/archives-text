## Carter showing U.S. weakness 
### 
President Jimmy Carter's re
sponses to the recent events in
Central Asia lend credence to
the subjective view that Ameri
can might and prestige are now
in serious decline.
The seizure of the embassy
in Tehran and the subsequent
drama involving the hostages
have evoked an image ot
American debility which may
or may not reflect our actual
might.
Our immediate disavowal of
a military response, the fruit
less attempts by our envoys
and by other parties to inter
cede on our behalf, and the in
creasing vehemence of the
hand-wringing and saber
rattling by the President in a
context ot palpable impotence
have constituted, at best, a
series ot distasteful and embar
rassing necessities or, at worst,
a confirmation of our status as
a "helpless giant."
Certainly, aggravation sim
mers among the American
people. The paradox of over
whelming power without
leverage contuses and angers.
Apparently, the responses
which elicit the most gut level
public empathy are vile carica
tures of the Ayatollah and the
proliferation of "Nuke Kho
meini" bumper stickers.
One cannot help feeling that
a national catharsis similar to
that which accompanied the
armed treeing of the U.S.S,
Mayague/ or a period of rejoic
ing like that which prevailed in
Israel after the raid on Entebbe
would ensue upon the resolute
liberation of the hostages. The
objective circumstances in Iran
may be vastly different from
those which prevailed in Cam
bodia and Uganda, and the use
of armed force in Tehran might
have disastrous consequ
ences, but the subjective
American mind makes, it only
unconsciously, an unfavorable
comparison between those in

stances of glory in the past and
America's seeming moribun
dity now.
Our response to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan ap
pears similarly to foster an
image of ineffectiveness. Our
cartoons and political prop
aganda depict an inexorable
Russian bear intent on outward
expansion in utter disregard of
the protests made by a trembl
ing, 97-lb. Uncle Sam.
There is something laugha
bly empty about the American
support tor the retaliatory
measures announced by Presi
dent Carter. While our gov
ernment self-righteously an
nounces a partial grain em
bargo on the U.S.S.R. farmers
grumble about their enforced
and disproportionate burden.
The administration moves to
institute other economic sanc
tions while the disappointing
results of similar strategies
against Rhodesia and South Af
rica remain fresh in the collec
tive international memory. The
US may well divert its indigna
tion into a petulant boycott of
the Moscow Olympics.
American officials express
delight with the overwhelming
condemnation of the Soviet
aggression by the United Na
tions General Assembly, a
body which they regarded with
disdain as a mere forum for
anti-Americanism just a short
while ago.
That our newspapers blare
with headlines proclaiming our
great "moral victory" in the UN
is an almost hilarious commen
tary on the dearth of genuinely
effective devices available to
President Carter in response to
the Soviet actions.
The subjective evidence of
American feebleness has ac
cumulated steadily. Our Viet
nam debacle, our perceived
passivity in the face of Cuban
adventurism, and the fall of

friendly governments across
the globe have contributed to a
self-diagnosed national
malaise. If "leadership" is an
issue in 1980, then a significant
reason is the apparent diminu
tion ot our international status.
A few years ago, Henry Kis
singer was criticized for al
legedly remarking that his job
was to guide the United States
in its decline from power. The
objective truth of this "de
tline" is open to debate. What
is not in dispute is that Ameri
cans appear either tacitly or
explicitly to believe that sue h a
decline is occurring. President
Carter's recent actions, how

ever merited they may be, only
add to this perception.
