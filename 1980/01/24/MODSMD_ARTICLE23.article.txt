# Olympics 'on hold'
## Big money down the tubes

The Washington Post
Washington â€” Stanford Blum, the man who
tied up exclusive rights to merchandise the
Moscow Olympics in the Western Hemisphere,
sat by his phone in Los Angeles this week listen
ing to the sound of $100 million going down the
drain and dreaming of actress Bo Derek.
Ihe running shorts manufacturer from New
York called to tell him J.C. Penney was canceling
its order for Olympic skivvies. They gym bag
maker in Pennsylvania had already stopped its
assembly line. I evi Strauss was starting to worry
about what to do with 6000 Olympic outfits,
specially sized to fit weight lifters and gymnasts.
Many of the 58 companies that Blum signed
up to make Moscow Olympic items were cancel
ing orders and cutting their losses without wait
ing for the Soviet response to President jimmy
Carter's ultimatum: Either get the Soviet troops
out of Afghanistan within 30 days or get the
Olympics out ot Russia.
"Everything is on hold," said Blum as he as
sessed the likelihood of losing his Olympic gold
mine. "But I'll survive, I've got Bo Derek."
The right to plaster the picture of the star of
the movie "10" all over America is some conso
lation for Blum. But most businesses would be
hard pressed to make up for Ihe hundreds of
millions they will lose if the games are called off
or the United States pulls out.
Multimillion dollar advertising campaigns
would have to be canceled and costly commeri
cals thrown away. Merchandise marred by the
image of Mischa, the Moscow Olympic bear,
will have to be dumped at a discount. Most of

the 11,000 sports tans who've made reservations
tor Russia probably will stay home.
The biggest loser would be the NBC television
network and its affiliated stations. NBC paid $87
million for the rights and facilities to broadcast
the games from Moscow.
A Lloyds of London insurance policy would
pick up 90 percent of the network's costs'if the
games are canceled or the United States pulls
out, the network said.
But the insurance doesn't cover the estimated
$150 million in advertising revenue NBC could
lose. Charging prices that were sometimes twice
as high as its usual rates, the network already
had sold 87 percent of its Olympic commercials.
All the advertising orders can be canceled if
the Olympics are called off, Madison Avenue
admen said.
If the games are moved out of Russia or some
substitute sports event is set up for teams that
boycott Moscow, the network says it will switch
its coverage.
Anything but a genuine Olympiad will be dif
ficult to sell to sponsors, advertising executives
say. Companies willing to pay huge premiums
for ads on Olympic programs could demand
discounts if their commercials are broadcast to a
smaller audience. NBC's whole fall program
ming plan could be thrown into chaos if the
games are canceled. NBC president Fred Sil
verman planned to use the network's Olympic
coverage as a springboard to vault NBC into first
place in the ratings race. New fall shows were to
be previewed and plugged during t!ie Olympic
coverage.
