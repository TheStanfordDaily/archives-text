Former President Gerald
Ford, in San Francisco
Saturday, blasted the cur
rent administration for its
defense policies and for its
handling of the economic
and energy situations, then
urged the country to stand
together in the wake of the
Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan.
Before an audience of
more than 2000, Ford ad
dressed the Middle East
situation and called on the
American people to "stand
up shoulder to shoulder,
arm and arm" to show the
Soviets how strong the Un
ited States is. Fie em
phasized that 50 years ago
foreign policy was bi
partisan and the country
was one.
"National unity is essen
tial as we face the crisis in
Iran and the growing threat
of the Soviet Union in Af
ghanistan and the surround
ing area," he said.
Olympics
Earlier in the day, Ford
expressed his views of the
proposed Olympic boycott
as one of the possible re
taliatory measures to be
taken against the Soviet
Union for the invasion of
Afghanistan.
"Certainly that is a possi
bility," he said. "But there are
othei solutions. I feel per
sonally that a move of the
games to Montreal would
be the best solution."
He also commented on
Carter's handling of the
world situation.
"I think what he's done so
far is good. We have to be

prepared to do more. I just
hope the President can
keep firm, can keep strong,
because it will be a long
time before it's over."
Ford criticized Carter and
his administration for can
celing the B-1 bomber pro
ject and for delaying the
MX-Missile system, sayinu

that these acts weakened
U.S. military capabilities.
"The Soviet Union, I can
tell you from personal ex
perience, respects only
strength," Ford said. "And
therefore, the United
States, if we are to meet this
current challenge, will not

only have to rebuild our
military capabilities but for
tify our will."
Laying it on the line
After stating, yet another
time, his intentions not to
campaign for the Republi
can nomination, Ford main
tained that he had "a little

leeway to lay it on the line."
Responding to quotes by
former Secretary of the
Treasury Michael Blument
hal and Carter's chief infla
tion fighter Altred Kahn,
who have predicted a bad
economic future for the Un
ited States, Ford contended

that "there is a way out" of
America's economic woes.
He cited the economic
troubles at the time he took
office and the relatively
healthy economy when he
left.
He said that the most im
portant action he took dur
ing his term in office was to
reduce inflation and the
high interest rate by cutting
down government spend
ing trom 11 percent a year to
5 Vi percent.
He compared that record
with Carter's projected rate
of growth next year â€” 10
percent.
Ford also commented on
Carter's failure to draw up a
comprehensive energy pol
icy, accusing Congress of
not responding to the need
for such a policy and then
blaming it for making only
half of one. He urged the
administration to decontrol
gas and oil prices, thereby
triggering the increased
production of domestic oil.
Ford urged the govern
ment to support research
on nuclear energy and exo
tic fuels such as solar,
geothermal and synfuels.
"We will get a break
through at some point, but
don't be misled," he said.
"The answer to any one of
these won't come tomor
row."
As for the race for the Re
publican nomination, he re
fused to make a commit
ment to any of the candi
dates until after the nomina
tion has been made.
