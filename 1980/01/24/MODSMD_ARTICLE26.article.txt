## Francesco Trio is superb 
### 
The Francesco Trio treated
an appreciative audience to an
evening of exquisite chamber
music last Saturday night in
Kresge Auditorium. The trio —
David Abel, violin; Bonnie
Hampton, cello; and Nathan
Schwartz, piano — was joined
by soprano Marie Gibson in a
program of Classical, Late
Romantic and French Impre
ssionistic music.
The program opened with
Mozart's Trio in C Major K. 548,
a classical delight, especially
when offered by talented
musicians such as the Fran
cesco Trio. The first move
ment, Allegro, is characterized
by numerous scale passages
linking its melodic ideas. These
passages were delicately exe
cuted, with full value given to
each note, while the melodic
themes were presented with
care and then handed off
among the Trio members as
though they were pieces of
fine china — vulnerable and ol
great value.
The final movement of the
Mozart trio was an Allegro
dressed up as a folk dance
melody. The dotted rhythms
skipped along under the nim
ble fingers of the players. The
accompaniment, based largely
in the piano voice, was the
most technically demanding
section of the piece, and was
ably performed with lightness
and poise by Schwartz.
The second piece ol the
evening featured Gibson
and Schwartz in Proses
Lyriques, a set ot four French
songs. This piece is somewhat
unusual in that the text and the
music were written by the
same person, the French Im

pressionist composer, Claude
Debussy.
The first song A Dream, pro
vided Schwartz an oppor
tunity to do much shaping of
the accompaniment. In the soft
passages, he seemed to play as
it painting with a line brush,
while the forte sections were
painted with the broad, sweep
ing strokes ol a thick brush.
Above this shone Gibson's
voice with a ringing, full
bodied tone, although in the
torte passages she was occa
sionally covered by her en
thusiastic accompanist.
The third song, Flowers, was
very similar in dynamic struc
ture to the second, The Shore.
Starting softly, it reached a
climax and then returned to a
resigned quietness. The piano
accompaniment consisted ot
the rich pentatonic chords by
which Debussy is known.
Considering the melancholy
drilt of the previous songs, the
fourth, Evening, was surpris
ingly good-natured. This was
expressed musically and lyri
cally by light, short phrases,
and enhanced by the crisp,
clear consonants and soft vow
els "112 the French language.
Gibson's French was impecca
ble, and a reprieve for ears ac
customed to the more banal
sounds of the American ton
gue.
The tinal selection of the
evening, Trio in B Major, Opus
8, by Johannes Brahms, began
with an inspired exposition of a
thoroughly Romantic theme by
Hampton. Rich sonorites
were pulled trom the depths ot
her cello by her full-bow
technique, and were then
joined in harmony at full

strength by the violin.
Throughout this movement,
the musical repoire between
Hampton and Abel was
in evidence as the cello
and violin carried the melodic
line, often beginning in unison
and growing into a satisfying
two-part theme.
The bouncing bows of the
violin and cello introduced a
vigorous and demanding
"hunt-song" theme in the sec
ond movement, Scherzo: Al
legro molto. A second, con
trasting theme was reminiscent
ol the opening of the piece,
and again Hampton's cello
soared in melody.
The following Adagio
movement provided a surprise
in composition, but no sur
prise in quality of perfor
mance. The opening of this
movement is a piano solo of
open-spaced, thinly textured
notes in contrasting motion,
but in close harmony. These in
teresting phrases were sensi
tively played, with much atten
tion given to the details of
phrasing and dynamics. This
was followed by each instru
ment serving as solo voice in
turn, with each savoring the
solo melodies.
In the fourth movement, Al
legro, the instruments take
turns playing duets with each
other, always accompanied by
the third voice. Here again
Schwartz's piano was the tech
nical workhorse, executing
with flair a difficult, arpeg
giated accompaniment. The
trio came together for a rhyth
mically unison ending, finish
ing the concert with a strong
and enthusiastic finale.

Nathan Schwartz, Bonnie Hampton, David Alh*l of the Francesco Trio.
The Francesco Trio treated
an appreciative audience to an
evening of exquisite chamber
music last Saturday night in
Kresge Auditorium. The trio —
David Abel, violin; Bonnie
Hampton, cello; and Nathan
Schwartz, piano — was joined
by soprano Marie Gibson in a
program of Classical, Late
Romantic and French Impre
ssionistic music.
The program opened with
Mozart's Trio in C Major K. 548,
a classical delight, especially
when offered by talented
musicians such as the Fran
cesco Trio. The first move
ment, Allegro, is characterized
by numerous scale passages
linking its melodic ideas. These
passages were delicately exe
cuted, with full value given to
each note, while the melodic
themes were presented with
care and then handed off
among the Trio members as
though they were pieces of
fine china — vulnerable and ol
great value.
The final movement of the
Mozart trio was an Allegro
dressed up as a folk dance
melody. The dotted rhythms
skipped along under the nim
ble fingers of the players. The
accompaniment, based largely
in the piano voice, was the
most technically demanding
section of the piece, and was
ably performed with lightness
and poise by Schwartz.
The second piece ol the
evening featured Gibson
and Schwartz in Proses
Lyriques, a set ot four French
songs. This piece is somewhat
unusual in that the text and the
music were written by the
same person, the French Im

pressionist composer, Claude
Debussy.
The first song A Dream, pro
vided Schwartz an oppor
tunity to do much shaping of
the accompaniment. In the soft
passages, he seemed to play as
it painting with a line brush,
while the forte sections were
painted with the broad, sweep
ing strokes ol a thick brush.
Above this shone Gibson's
voice with a ringing, full
bodied tone, although in the
torte passages she was occa
sionally covered by her en
thusiastic accompanist.
The third song, Flowers, was
very similar in dynamic struc
ture to the second, The Shore.
Starting softly, it reached a
climax and then returned to a
resigned quietness. The piano
accompaniment consisted ot
the rich pentatonic chords by
which Debussy is known.
Considering the melancholy
drilt of the previous songs, the
fourth, Evening, was surpris
ingly good-natured. This was
expressed musically and lyri
cally by light, short phrases,
and enhanced by the crisp,
clear consonants and soft vow
els "112 the French language.
Gibson's French was impecca
ble, and a reprieve for ears ac
customed to the more banal
sounds of the American ton
gue.
The tinal selection of the
evening, Trio in B Major, Opus
8, by Johannes Brahms, began
with an inspired exposition of a
thoroughly Romantic theme by
Hampton. Rich sonorites
were pulled trom the depths ot
her cello by her full-bow
technique, and were then
joined in harmony at full

strength by the violin.
Throughout this movement,
the musical repoire between
Hampton and Abel was
in evidence as the cello
and violin carried the melodic
line, often beginning in unison
and growing into a satisfying
two-part theme.
The bouncing bows of the
violin and cello introduced a
vigorous and demanding
"hunt-song" theme in the sec
ond movement, Scherzo: Al
legro molto. A second, con
trasting theme was reminiscent
ol the opening of the piece,
and again Hampton's cello
soared in melody.
The following Adagio
movement provided a surprise
in composition, but no sur
prise in quality of perfor
mance. The opening of this
movement is a piano solo of
open-spaced, thinly textured
notes in contrasting motion,
but in close harmony. These in
teresting phrases were sensi
tively played, with much atten
tion given to the details of
phrasing and dynamics. This
was followed by each instru
ment serving as solo voice in
turn, with each savoring the
solo melodies.
In the fourth movement, Al
legro, the instruments take
turns playing duets with each
other, always accompanied by
the third voice. Here again
Schwartz's piano was the tech
nical workhorse, executing
with flair a difficult, arpeg
giated accompaniment. The
trio came together for a rhyth
mically unison ending, finish
ing the concert with a strong
and enthusiastic finale.
