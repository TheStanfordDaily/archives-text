# Joffrey II shows talent and youth
## 
### 
There was not a day without
a dance performance or lec
ture in the Stanford area last
week. It the dance boom hasn't
hit everywhere, there is little
doubt that the Peninsula is hav
ing its own renaissance.
In addition to the San Fran
cisco and Oakland Ballets and
the Peninsula Ballet Theatre,
the area supports dozens of
smaller companies and schools
such as Palo Alto's Pacific
Dance Center and its affiliate
company. At Stanford, dancers
and dance lovers are breaking
out of their former confines
within the Athletic Department
and filling department, VMCA
and student organized classes
offering everything from ballet
and modern technique to bal
lroom to Swedish folkdancing.
The Stanford Dance Quorum
was started only last year and
has already supported several
performances by Stanford
dancers. The Lively Arts Dance
Series is consistently filling
Memorial Auditorium. Over 70
percent of the seats were al
ready sold to subscribers be
fore ticket office sales opened
last fall.
The Joffrey 11 Dancer's stay at
Stanford was probably one of
the nicer stops on their
nation-wide tour. Instead of a
one-night stand, they were
here for three days (with a
fourth in San Jose). Instead of a
high-school gym they used
Memorial Auditorium with
wooden floors, decent lighting
and real stage wings. And they
had an appreciative audience
of patrons, students and fellow
dancers.
The Joffrey II is a training
company for the New York Jof
frey Ballet. Its members, aged
18-21, are chosen from top stu
dents at the American Dance
Center, the Joffrey's official
school, to learn repertory, the
ways of the theater and the
road tour, and the art of danc
ing as a member of a company.
Most of them join the Joffrey or
other well-respected com
panies within a couple of years.
The company also considers
itself a vehicle for rising young
choreographers. Half of the
pieces on Thursday's program
were first performed last year.
No other piece performed

on Thursday evening showed
up the company as well as
"Random Dances." The four
women and three men were
dressed in jazzy variations on a
theme of white gauze, ac
cented with pale reds, greens
and blues. Jonathan Hancock's
piano music "Variations on a
Secret Theme" is wonderfully
danceable — very melodic, in
tricate and flowing. The com
pany proved to be very compe
tent. In Margorie Mussman's
choreography each dancer
dances alone as well as with a
partner or as a member of a
corps. Given this isolation ot
the individual, the piece wasn't
really hurt when the dancers
weren't quite together.
Lynne Chervony and Eric
Dirk danced a very sweet
"Kermesse in Bruges." The pic
ture of a pretty peasant couple
shyly flirting is rather passe.
But it was a good example of a
classical 19th century pas de
deux.
The Joffrey II did not quite
live up to all challenges. In
other staging of Frederick
Ashton's "Monotones II"
much is made of the contact
between the two men and the
woman of the pas de trois. The
dancers always worked as a
unit —whether in unison oras
necessary and inseparable
components. Joffrey ll's
"Monotones II" unfortunately
lacked much of this contact.
Much of thegymnastic partner
ing was choreographed out.
The threesome spaced them
selves too well and were not
consistently together or in con
trol.
"Ladder for Escape" and "To
a Point" were both striking
modern pieces. "Ladder for
Escape's" theme of water,
earth, fire and air was easy to
lose and one wondered if the
dancers themselves had any
sense of the metaphors.
Whether purposely or not,
Edward Morgan's black skin
stood in contrast to Daniel
Quinn's paler in Steward Jar
rett's "To a Point," adding
another variable to the dance's
expression of the bonds and
struggles between two men.
The classical tutu finally ap
peared, white, silver, and
stark, in the evening's finale. In

"Septet" the classical style was
there — with a futuristic twist.
The ballerinas seemed a little
too liberated, the men not
quite solicitous enough. Pr
inces wouldn't have held their
princesses upside down.
Dancers and dance watchers
today have very high stan
dards. But there is a tendency
to be overwhelmed (and un
derstandably so) by technical
perfection. A dancer must be
able to do more than dazzle. A

great piece of choreography is
compromised it il is not per
formed by performers who
have succeeded in understand
ing the choreographers pur
pose and internalizing it. That
is not an easy task. The loffrey
II Dancers gave some fine per
formances. One can blame
their youth and inexperience
lor leaving us, at times, with
only the steps.
