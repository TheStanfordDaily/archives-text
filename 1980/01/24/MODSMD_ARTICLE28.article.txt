"I love playing in Berzer
ifceley again."
All we saw was Dan, a piano,
■and his 12-string. The band was
s)nissing, but this just
heightened the genius of the
star. "I didn't bring my band
3Vith me. I want you to hear the
songs the way they were writ
fen, without six million guitar
Tpverdubs and six million voc
als."
M
Dan was right, he no longer
.Reeds a band. Fogelberg has
jjrome of age.
, All it took was the first chord
of the phenomenal title-cut
to hype Ber
keley Community Theatre for
an amazing 2Vi hour interplay
between artist and audience.
Throughout the December 7
performance, Fogelberg ap
peared to be as excited as the
2000-person audience. He
several times between
to try out new jokes, in
♦ellectualize on Greek mythol
ogy, or list his favorite funny
people. His energy was non
stop, sparked by the dixie cup
of Tullamore Dew in hand, "I
had a tough time in Dallas once
with this stuff."
' He showed his diverse ta
lent, playing songs from each
of his six albums, jumpingfrom
soft rock to down-home coun
ty to just pure mellow. A sam
pling of his piano magic, "To
the Morning," was definitely

an audience-acclaimed favo
rite. "This is a song tor all of
you people, who for some
reason or another, still get up
before noon, or for those of
you who don't go to bed until
sunrise,"
Another starred song, "re
corded with an aging flute
player a while ago," was
"Guitar Etude No. 3" taken
from his recent album Twin
Sons of Different Mothers, cut
with his good friend and in
credible flutist Tim Weisberg.
Dan played his usual excep
tional guitar part and covered
up tor Weisberg'% absence by
singing the flute part with as
sorted dooby-doo's.
The audience was drugged
by the intensity of "Stars,"
"Once Upon a Time, " and
"Captured Angel," but Dan
encouraged all to "smoke 'em
if you got 'em." Fogelberg also
added some surprisingly excel
lent pieces not on any of his
albums, including "Plastered
in Paris," which was a "weird
song written by one of Ihe
three funniest people in the
world behind Hunter
Thompson and Gerry Garcia,"
and "Full Moon Mansion,"
written "back in 1969 when I
should've been going to col
lege."
Don Rifkin, one of the many
clued-in Stanford students at
the concert, exhorted Fogel
berg's talent, "Seeing and

hearing him perform is one of
those things in life which is to
tally good. A bonus which I
lucked into. He's got such a
beautiful voice, and his songs
always hit a special chord. I re
ally get off on it. I've been in a
good mood ever since."
The whole audience enjoyed
"same Auld Lang Syne," a
story song ready for his next
release, "We would've put it

on the last one but we ran out
of time, space and drugs." His
finale of "The Gambler," com
plete with audience participa
tion, just wasn't enough. The
applause persisted but was
immediately hushed when Dan
encored with "Along the
Road," a super song from his
new album Phoenix.

in Paris," which was a "weird
song written by one of Ihe
three funniest people in the
world behind Hunter
Thompson and Gerry Garcia,"
and "Full Moon Mansion,"
written "back in 1969 when I
should've been going to col
lege."
Don Rifkin, one of the many
clued-in Stanford students at
the concert, exhorted Fogel
berg's talent, "Seeing and

hearing him perform is one of
those things in life which is to
tally good. A bonus which I
lucked into. He's got such a
beautiful voice, and his songs
always hit a special chord. I re
ally get off on it. I've been in a
good mood ever since."
The whole audience enjoyed
"same Auld Lang Syne," a
story song ready for his next
release, "We would've put it

on the last one but we ran out
of time, space and drugs." His
finale of "The Gambler," com
plete with audience participa
tion, just wasn't enough. The
applause persisted but was
immediately hushed when Dan
encored with "Along the
Road," a super song from his
new album Phoenix.
