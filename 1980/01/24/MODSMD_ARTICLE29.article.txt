# Arnott puts Aeschylus on strings
## 
### 
• Peter Arnott, whose
Marionette Theater performed
Aeschylus' Agamemnon Tues
day night at the University of
Santa Clara, has been conduct
ing a crusade tor more than 25
years to convince audiences in
Europe and America that the
use ot puppets and the aims ot
serious drama do not exclude
each other.
Vou may judge lor yourse
lves tonight at eight when lie
presents Oedipus the King in
Annenberg Auditorium.
All theater is illusion, but
seldom more so than when Ar
nott mounts the stage. The
lights dim, but Arnott is only

halt lost to view: Iromnowon,
his head and hands are always
visible. This split, initially up
setting, between the space of
the play and that of the sole
player, becomes a source of
delight, for there is a secon
dary choreography in the
abstract flourishes and swoops
Arnott's hands describe as they
skim from character to charac
ter. The contrast forces atten
tion to the artificiality of the
proceedings below, and it's a
clever way of creating that dis
tance from ordinary lite that in
the Greek theater was accom
panied by diction, by dance,
and by music.
Arnott is the only human on

stage, fulfilling virtuosic de
mands as he animates up to
live marionettes at once; yet
on the way home, I found my
self talking about how good
"the Kassandra" had been, and
even the three old men of the
chorus are given distinct per
sonalities.
That Arnott can achieve such
effects is all the more notewor
thy since he is playing to an
audience raised on movies and
TV, where the face is an actor's
main tool. Arnott's figures are
virtually faceless (like Creek
tragedians, they wear masks),
and posture, gesture and
movement create their per

sonalities. All these resources
are used sparingly, yet at mo
ments, they are ultimately af
fecting.
Such a moment comes when
Kassandra, the play's only in
nocent, leave the stage to meet
the slaughter she knows waits
for her within the palace. In the
throes of prophecy that pre
cede, she had seems almost
jointless, twisted by her god
into contortions of anguish.
But as she mounts the ramp to
the palace, for an instant she is
erect, her foot raised in stiff de
termination to make her end
an unflinching one.
