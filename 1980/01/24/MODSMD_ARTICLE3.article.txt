# Registration prompts strong reactions
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff 
President limmy Carter's an
nouncement last night that he will
call for compulsory registration for
the draft has elicited reactions in the
Stanford community ranging from
strong opposition to approval as a
"sign of solidarity."
A torch lit march involving about
100 students was held at Stanford last
night in protest against the plan for
registration. Today at noon David
Harris will speak on the steps of Old
Union at a rally organized by People
Against the Draft.
Monday at noon, anti-war activist
Daniel Ellsberg will be one of the
speakers at a "Stop the War Before it
Starts" rally, to be held on the steps
of Old Union.
"Registration is in effect conscrip
tion and if the United States thinks it
will solve its strategic insecurity by
imposing conscription on the youth
in this country it is sadly mistaken,"
said anti-draft activist Harris.
"Our security depends on a
lifeline that stretches halfway around
the world and is held by people who
don't have our best interests at hand.
I don't think he (Carter) ought to
have a generation of Americans at his
disposal; so far he's only had 50, and
look at what happened to them," he
added.
Scott Olmsted, coordinator of
Stanford Libertarians, expressed
similar opposition to the announce
ment.
"We will absolutely oppose the
reinstatement of registration or con
scription and call for a mass resis
tance to such actions. Every person
owns their own life and the choice is
simple: it belongs to you or the
state*" he said.
Olmsted plans to organize active
resistance including efforts to block
entrances to induction centers and
will ask the University not to cooper

ate in any manner with the proce
dures. "The law means less to us than
human rights," he stated.
One effect of recreating a selective
service system, according to some, is
to demonstrate that the United
States is organizing its military
strategy.
"I don't think that President Carter
wants to intervene; it's a part of sig
nalling toughness to the Russians
and will stimulate developments that
they'd rather not see take place,"
commented Alexander George, pro
fessor of political science here.
"The psychological impact is tre
mendous. If the administration
wants to signal that the Cold War is
back, they've certainly done it in a
dramatic way," said Paul Seaver, as
sistant professor of history here.
Seaver predicted there would be "a
lot of anxiety on college campuses in
this country," with the announce
ment.
On this campus the reaction is be
ginning and it is swift and definite.
"I don't think it's necessary. I think
it's jumping the gun a little too
soon," said senior Rasha
Drachkovitch.
Senior Andy Barkin, however, said
"the draft registration doesn't bother
meat all. It's the draft that will bother
me.
"I see registration as a sign of sol
idarity," he added.
"I feel it's time all Americans — not
just poor persons and blacks — take
an active role in the defense of our
nation," said Sloane Citron, a busi
ness student here.
"I 'm sick of hearing people comp
laining that the draft is slavery," said
Gary Fremerman, junior. "People
seem to forget what it is that fighting
is all about — to protect the free
doms we've got. Political freedom is
not something man has naturally,"
he added.

Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall addressed the question of arms
escalation, saying that "if the Soviets
invade Western Europe it would be a
nuclear war very quickly and we
don't need a draft for that kind of
war."
Marshall is concerned about
"starting the machinery of compul
sory military service without an ar
ticulated foreign policy. It is very un
clear that we intend to land one to
two million men in Iran or Pakistan.
Those countries are so chaotic that it
is not clear that the local people
would even be on our side," he ad

ded.
Terrance Culliman of SRI-
International echoed Marshall's
hesitation about intervention as a
motive for revitalizing the selective
service.
"I find it hard to conceive that the
Soviet Union will be marching from
country tocountry. I thinkthedraft is
the president's way of having a con
tingency plan; he is trying to apply as
many types of pro-active vs. reactive
pressures," said Culliman.
An advocate of Pete McCloskey's
(R-Menlo Park) national service plan,
he said he hopes that if the draft is
reinstated, it will include "nonmilit
ary provisions as part of the pac
kage."
McCloskey was unavailable for
comment but a staff member said the
representative would support regist
ration.
Jn response to Carter's an
nouncement last night, students at
one UC-Berkeley dormitory opened
their windows and chanted, "Hell
no, we won't go," according to Daily
Californian reporters.
