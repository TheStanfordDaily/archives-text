# Quadrophenia and the Who
## A
						release of fashion and passion 
### 
There are certain fields in which Europeans
simply surpass Americans: they build better
cars, grow better wines, and, in the present
case, they make far better films about grow
ing up. Franc Roddam, directing his first
major film, brings a distinctly European touch
to the Who's 1972 rock opera, "Quad
rophenia." Roddam's spare and sensitive
style makes "Tommy," the Hollywood ex
travaganza based on the Who's first rock op
era, look like the celluloid equivalent of a
velvet painting.
Unlike "Tommy," "Quadrophenia" uses
the Who's songs as a beginning rather than
an end. The film is faithful to songwriter Peter
Townshend's original plot, but the music
stays primarily in the background.
Quadrophenia" is set in the mid-60's
London, where the Mod movement was
sweeping the young people and shocking the
old. At the center of the drama is Jimmy, an
alienated late-teenager superbly played by
Phil Daniels.
Be different
"If you can't be different, you might as well
jump into the sea and drown," Jimmy says
early on. The first half of the film traces Jim
my's growing frustration with conventional
British values, countered by his growing at
traction to the glittery Mods.
The backbone of "Quadrophenia" is Rod
dam's detailed evocation of British working
class life. Jimmy's daily routine is achingly
dreary; he works as an errand boy in an ad
agency, then tramps home through the grey
London mist to his narrow row house and his
equally narrow parents, who struggle in vain
to understand their unhappy son.
The Mod lifestyle offers Jimmy an easy
identity. Garbed in oversize parkas, flashy
sportcoats and skinny ties, they roam the
streets with their girlfriends on multi
mirrored Lambretta motor scooters. The
Mod credo embraces drug use, sexual free
dom and the explosive new rock n roll being
introduced by, in particular, the Who.
But Jimmy and his friends are more endear
ing than degenerate. Their nightly misadven
tures have an irresistible humor, as well as a
fierce, sometimes violent energy.
These scenes shed light not only on the
Mods, but on a more recent phenomenon,
Britain's punk movement. Punk bands like
the Sex Pistols and the Clash, while more
explicitly political than the 60's Mods, have
sprung up from the same soil.
Riots
The first hour of "Quadrophenia" trades in
small but revealing moments, often capable
of daring intimacy. The film then turns to a
broad re-creation of the Bank Holiday riots
which took place when the Mods traveled to
the beach resort town ot Brighton. The initial

contrast between claustrophobic London
and the airy Atlantic shores is stunning, but
Roddam's delicate pacing is upset at this
point. He never quite regains control.
The marathon riot scene, whatever its ex
cesses, is extraordinary. Jimmy and his
friends join up with an army of compatriots
led by the modest of the Mods, Ace (played
by Sting, of the British band, the Police). The
Mods' wild three-day weekend boils into
bloody violence in a spectacular battle with
the Rockers, a band of leather-jacketed street
toughs.
The Mods fight not out of hostility, but out
of a crude need for physical expression. In
the middle of the fray, Jimmy drags his
girlfriend into an alley for a quick but
exhilarating rendezvous. The Mods' urges for
sex and for violence are inextricably linked.
Returning to London, Jimmy is profoundly
unhappy. He senses that the search for thrills
can escalate no higher than Brighton. Into
lerably belligerent, Jimmy is locked out by his
parents, dumped by his girlfriend, and fired
from his job. In a fit of anger he smashes up
his prized Lambretta.
Brighton
Jimmy travels back to Brighton, living on
cigarettes, Speed and desperation. Unfortu
nately, Roddam defers to the original opera
in the film's final scenes. The Who's songs
narrate this section, revealing that Jimmy is
losing the will to live as his personality dissol
ves. The film's careful attention to social
conditions gives way to a cheap psychologi
cal solution. There is no drama or interaction
of any kind; only Daniel's marvelously ex
pressive face keeps the plot afloat.
The ending of the film is visually stunning
but otherwise suspect. Thorougly disil
lusioned with the Mod lifestyle, Jimmy runs a
stolen motor scooter off the mile-high cliffs
of Dover. The scene's editing makes it un
clear whether Jimmy dies or slides off before
the fall. But the film's brief opening scene,
which showed Jimmy returning from the
cliffs, indicates that he lives on.
Aside from the fact that this is a second
hand ending — "Harold and Maude" origi
nated it — it poses far more questions than it
resolves. Where will Jimmy turn, having re
jected both the conventional and Mod lifes
tyles? Is he a true rebel or just a disturbed
adolescent?
Despite these ambiguities, "Quad
rophenia" remains a powerful and often
moving film. It is the most serious effort to
date to understand what rock 'n roll means to
rock 'n rollers. In thefilm'sfinest moments, it
captures the Mods' untamed voltage — a
tightly wound mixture of fashion and pas
sion, constantly seeking release.
