Earlier, the ayatollah's doctors issued a bulletin

Panama denies shah is in custody
Panama City, Panama — The official spokesman
of the Panamanian government last night formally
denied that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
had been arrested, as had been announced by the
Iranian Foreign Ministry.
Word of the alleged arrest came from the Iranian
news agency Pars, which reported a personal tele
phone call from Panamanian President Aristides
Royo to Foreign Minister Sadegh Gotbzadeh, a
candidate for the Iranian presidency.
In Panama, a government television station and
Panamanian radio stations said the deposed shah
was "doing what he does every day"and there
were no signs that he was under arrest on the
resort island of Contadora, 35 miles southeast of
Panama City.
Panama's U.S. Ambassador, Carlos Lopez
Guevara, said he was authorized to "categorically
deny" the Iranian statements.
Earlier Panama said it would consider any Ira
nian request for the shah's extradition. But Royo
made clear that Iranian authorities would have to
comply with requirements of Panamanian legisla
tion on extradition.
House acts on Olympic transfer
Washington — Acting with unusual speed, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday ap
proved with only one dissent a resolution support
ing President |immy Carter's request that the Un
ited States not participate in the 1980 Summer
Olympics Games unless they are transferred from
Moscow.
After listening to nearly five hours of testimony
from United States Olympic Committee (USOC)
President Robert Kane and Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, the committee took
only minutes to approve the resolution by a voice
vote.
The resolution, introduced by Chairman Cle
ment /ablocki (D-Wis.) and 31 others, calls for the
USOC to honor the request that it propose to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the
Moscow games be shifted to an alternative site or
canceled in repudiation of the Soviet invasion of

Afghanistan.
It further urges the lOC to adopt the proposal,
which lOC President Lord Killanin has adamantly
insisted it will not do. If the lOC rejects the prop
osal, the resolution urges that the USOC and the
Olympic committees ot other countries not par
ticipate in the 1980 Summer Olympics and instead
conduct "alternative games of their own."
The House Rules Committee agreed to meet in
special session on the resolution this morning and
is expected to clear the way for it to be brought to
the House floor this afternoon. It is expected to be
approved there swiftly and go immediately to the
Senate, where approval is also expected.
Barring an unforeseen snag, the resolution
should thus have the overwhelming endorsement
of both houses of Congress by the time the 86-
person USOC Executive Board meets in Colorado
Springs this weekend to consider the president's
request, as expressed in a letter to Kane last Sun
day.
Security council to meet on Iran
New Delhi — United Nations Secretary General
Kurt Waldheim cut short his Asian tour yesterday
to head back to New York to consult with the
Security Council today on a "package arrange
ment" to free the 50 American hostages in Iran.
Before leaving the area, though, he stopped in
the Pakistani capital of Islamabad yesterday morn
ing to meet with President Mohammed /ia ul-Haq
about the Soviet takeover of neighboring Af
ghanistan, which the Security Council also will be
taking up.
Waldheim told correspondents at the airport
here as he left lor Islamabad that he had worked
out a package during his |an. 2 visit to Tehran that
calls for an international commission to investi
gate alleged crimes of the deposed shah in return
tor the release of 50 American hostages taken Nov.
4 when Iranian militant students seized the U.S.
Embassy.
Setting up the commission would meet some of
the grievances of the Iranians, though the stu
dents still insist the hostages will not be freed until
the shah is returned to Iran.
Waldheim said the United States wants the hos
tages released "simultaneously" with the setting
up of the international commission. Iran, how
ever, said it will free the hostages only after the
commission finishes its investigation.
Israel completes Sinai pullback
Refidim, Sinai — With a bittersweet mixture of
nostalgic sadness and a celebration of peace, Is
rael's army yesterday completed a pullback from
two-thirds of the Sinai peninsula, where more
than 2255 of its soldiers fell in three decades of
struggle with Egypt.
In yielding an irregularly shaped 7000-square
mile section of the desert — the largest portion to
be returned to Egypt since the Camp David peace
treaty was signed last year — Israel gave up the
most topographically valuable portion ot the Sinai
and surrendered much of the strategic depth it has
relied upon to defend its original southern border.
But in doing so, Israel put into motion the long
awaited process of normalizing relations with
Egypt, its most powerful adversary in four wars.
While another, symbolic, withdrawal ceremony
will be held here tomorrow, virtually the entire
Sinai army command was moved last night behind
a line stretching from El Arish in the north and Ras
Muhammed in the south. The remaining third of
the Sinai will be returned to Egypt in two years.
As if offering tangible evidence that the Sinai
withdrawal was not in vain, the government an
nounced last night it had located a site for its
embassy in Cairo — the first in an Arab state —

which will begin functioning temporarily in hotel
rooms on Sunday.
Grocery strike negotiations begin
San Francisco — Both sides in the strike against
some San Francisco Bay area supermarkets pre
pared yesterday tor a meeting with federal
mediators as the dispute moved into its fourth day.
The mediation session was scheduled for today
in San Francisco.
David Selvin, spokesman for the United Food
and Commercial workers union, said that "if the
employers are prepared to move, we may be able
to get on with realistic negotiations."
A lockout of clerks at four supermarket chains
which were not being struck went into effect yes
terday, leaving stores to operate with manage
ment and temporary personnel. Picketing con
tinued at Safeway stores in eight Northern Califor
nia counties, and at three Raley's stores in Vallejo,
Antioch and Pittsburgh.
Selvin said the main issue in the strike, which
began after clerks voted overwhelmingly Sunday
to reject a contract offer, is not money, but rather
what he termed "takeaways" in the food council's
offer.
"They want to increase by manyfold the number
of apprentices, starting at 55 percent of the experi
enced salary, and they want to increase the
number of part-time employees.
"This is an attack on full-time employees," said
Selvin. "They (employers) are driving to make it a
part-time industry."
Voters to decide oil company tax
Sacramento — An initiative to impose a new state
surtax on oil company profits qualified yesterday
for California's )une 3 ballot, but a measure to
change the rules for California's winner-take-all
Republican primary was headed for defeat.
The failure of the winner-take-all initiative —
sponsored by Republican foes of front-runner
Ronald Reagan — won't be official until today,
which is the deadline for placing initiatives on the
lune ballot.
But as soon as rejection is official, backers of the
initiative say they will go to court to attempt to get
that decision overturned.
At stake in that dispute is a revision of election
rules which could take 60 to 100 California dele
gates away from Reagan and give them to George
Bush, |ohn Connally and other COP candidates.
But even if the winner-take-all appeal plan fails,
the ]une } ballot will be loaded with controversial
propositions.
Stocks rise, gold drop continues
New York — The stock market staged a sharp
rally today, rebounding from Tuesday's setback.
The price of gold, which started the week above
$tfooan ounce, plunged below $600 in early trading
in Europe yesterday. But then it attracted a surge of
new buying, and recovered to the neighborhood
of $695.
The Dow lones average of 30 industrials jumped
11.35 to H77.56, a 3'/i-month high.
Today's weather
Fair through Friday with patchy fog night and
morning, mainly north Bay Area. Continued warm
days and cool nights. Lows in the 40s in urban areas
and the 30s in the suburbs. Highs in the upper 50s
and 60s. Variable winds to 15 mph. Saturday
through Monday: mostly fair and dry weather with
patchy morning valley fog. Temperatures ranging
near to a little below seasonal normals. Most highs
in the 40s to mid 50s. Lows in the 30s to low 40s at
low elevations.

resort island of Contadora, 35 miles southeast of
Panama City.
Panama's U.S. Ambassador, Carlos Lopez
Guevara, said he was authorized to "categorically
deny" the Iranian statements.
Earlier Panama said it would consider any Ira
nian request for the shah's extradition. But Royo
made clear that Iranian authorities would have to
comply with requirements of Panamanian legisla
tion on extradition.
House acts on Olympic transfer
Washington — Acting with unusual speed, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday ap
proved with only one dissent a resolution support
ing President |immy Carter's request that the Un
ited States not participate in the 1980 Summer
Olympics Games unless they are transferred from
Moscow.
After listening to nearly five hours of testimony
from United States Olympic Committee (USOC)
President Robert Kane and Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, the committee took
only minutes to approve the resolution by a voice
vote.
The resolution, introduced by Chairman Cle
ment /ablocki (D-Wis.) and 31 others, calls for the
USOC to honor the request that it propose to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the
Moscow games be shifted to an alternative site or
canceled in repudiation of the Soviet invasion of

Afghanistan.
It further urges the lOC to adopt the proposal,
which lOC President Lord Killanin has adamantly
insisted it will not do. If the lOC rejects the prop
osal, the resolution urges that the USOC and the
Olympic committees ot other countries not par
ticipate in the 1980 Summer Olympics and instead
conduct "alternative games of their own."
The House Rules Committee agreed to meet in
special session on the resolution this morning and
is expected to clear the way for it to be brought to
the House floor this afternoon. It is expected to be
approved there swiftly and go immediately to the
Senate, where approval is also expected.
Barring an unforeseen snag, the resolution
should thus have the overwhelming endorsement
of both houses of Congress by the time the 86-
person USOC Executive Board meets in Colorado
Springs this weekend to consider the president's
request, as expressed in a letter to Kane last Sun
day.
Security council to meet on Iran
New Delhi — United Nations Secretary General
Kurt Waldheim cut short his Asian tour yesterday
to head back to New York to consult with the
Security Council today on a "package arrange
ment" to free the 50 American hostages in Iran.
Before leaving the area, though, he stopped in
the Pakistani capital of Islamabad yesterday morn
ing to meet with President Mohammed /ia ul-Haq
about the Soviet takeover of neighboring Af
ghanistan, which the Security Council also will be
taking up.
Waldheim told correspondents at the airport
here as he left lor Islamabad that he had worked
out a package during his |an. 2 visit to Tehran that
calls for an international commission to investi
gate alleged crimes of the deposed shah in return
tor the release of 50 American hostages taken Nov.
4 when Iranian militant students seized the U.S.
Embassy.
Setting up the commission would meet some of
the grievances of the Iranians, though the stu
dents still insist the hostages will not be freed until
the shah is returned to Iran.
Waldheim said the United States wants the hos
tages released "simultaneously" with the setting
up of the international commission. Iran, how
ever, said it will free the hostages only after the
commission finishes its investigation.
Israel completes Sinai pullback
Refidim, Sinai — With a bittersweet mixture of
nostalgic sadness and a celebration of peace, Is
rael's army yesterday completed a pullback from
two-thirds of the Sinai peninsula, where more
than 2255 of its soldiers fell in three decades of
struggle with Egypt.
In yielding an irregularly shaped 7000-square
mile section of the desert — the largest portion to
be returned to Egypt since the Camp David peace
treaty was signed last year — Israel gave up the
most topographically valuable portion ot the Sinai
and surrendered much of the strategic depth it has
relied upon to defend its original southern border.
But in doing so, Israel put into motion the long
awaited process of normalizing relations with
Egypt, its most powerful adversary in four wars.
While another, symbolic, withdrawal ceremony
will be held here tomorrow, virtually the entire
Sinai army command was moved last night behind
a line stretching from El Arish in the north and Ras
Muhammed in the south. The remaining third of
the Sinai will be returned to Egypt in two years.
As if offering tangible evidence that the Sinai
withdrawal was not in vain, the government an
nounced last night it had located a site for its
embassy in Cairo — the first in an Arab state —

which will begin functioning temporarily in hotel
rooms on Sunday.
Grocery strike negotiations begin
San Francisco — Both sides in the strike against
some San Francisco Bay area supermarkets pre
pared yesterday tor a meeting with federal
mediators as the dispute moved into its fourth day.
The mediation session was scheduled for today
in San Francisco.
David Selvin, spokesman for the United Food
and Commercial workers union, said that "if the
employers are prepared to move, we may be able
to get on with realistic negotiations."
A lockout of clerks at four supermarket chains
which were not being struck went into effect yes
terday, leaving stores to operate with manage
ment and temporary personnel. Picketing con
tinued at Safeway stores in eight Northern Califor
nia counties, and at three Raley's stores in Vallejo,
Antioch and Pittsburgh.
Selvin said the main issue in the strike, which
began after clerks voted overwhelmingly Sunday
to reject a contract offer, is not money, but rather
what he termed "takeaways" in the food council's
offer.
"They want to increase by manyfold the number
of apprentices, starting at 55 percent of the experi
enced salary, and they want to increase the
number of part-time employees.
"This is an attack on full-time employees," said
Selvin. "They (employers) are driving to make it a
part-time industry."
Voters to decide oil company tax
Sacramento — An initiative to impose a new state
surtax on oil company profits qualified yesterday
for California's )une 3 ballot, but a measure to
change the rules for California's winner-take-all
Republican primary was headed for defeat.
The failure of the winner-take-all initiative —
sponsored by Republican foes of front-runner
Ronald Reagan — won't be official until today,
which is the deadline for placing initiatives on the
lune ballot.
But as soon as rejection is official, backers of the
initiative say they will go to court to attempt to get
that decision overturned.
At stake in that dispute is a revision of election
rules which could take 60 to 100 California dele
gates away from Reagan and give them to George
Bush, |ohn Connally and other COP candidates.
But even if the winner-take-all appeal plan fails,
the ]une } ballot will be loaded with controversial
propositions.

Panama City, Panama — The official spokesman
of the Panamanian government last night formally
denied that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi

Security council to meet on Iran
New Delhi — United Nations Secretary General
Kurt Waldheim cut short his Asian tour yesterday
to head back to New York to consult with the
Security Council today on a "package arrange
ment" to free the 50 American hostages in Iran.
Before leaving the area, though, he stopped in
the Pakistani capital of Islamabad yesterday morn
ing to meet with President Mohammed /ia ul-Haq
about the Soviet takeover of neighboring Af
ghanistan, which the Security Council also will be
taking up.
Waldheim told correspondents at the airport
here as he left lor Islamabad that he had worked
out a package during his |an. 2 visit to Tehran that
calls for an international commission to investi
gate alleged crimes of the deposed shah in return
tor the release of 50 American hostages taken Nov.
4 when Iranian militant students seized the U.S.
Embassy.
Setting up the commission would meet some of
the grievances of the Iranians, though the stu
dents still insist the hostages will not be freed until
the shah is returned to Iran.
Waldheim said the United States wants the hos
tages released "simultaneously" with the setting
up of the international commission. Iran, how
ever, said it will free the hostages only after the
commission finishes its investigation.
Israel completes Sinai pullback
Refidim, Sinai — With a bittersweet mixture of
nostalgic sadness and a celebration of peace, Is
rael's army yesterday completed a pullback from
two-thirds of the Sinai peninsula, where more
than 2255 of its soldiers fell in three decades of
struggle with Egypt.
In yielding an irregularly shaped 7000-square
mile section of the desert — the largest portion to
be returned to Egypt since the Camp David peace
treaty was signed last year — Israel gave up the
most topographically valuable portion ot the Sinai
and surrendered much of the strategic depth it has
relied upon to defend its original southern border.
But in doing so, Israel put into motion the long
awaited process of normalizing relations with
Egypt, its most powerful adversary in four wars.
While another, symbolic, withdrawal ceremony
will be held here tomorrow, virtually the entire
Sinai army command was moved last night behind
a line stretching from El Arish in the north and Ras
Muhammed in the south. The remaining third of
the Sinai will be returned to Egypt in two years.
As if offering tangible evidence that the Sinai
withdrawal was not in vain, the government an
nounced last night it had located a site for its
embassy in Cairo — the first in an Arab state —

which will begin functioning temporarily in hotel
rooms on Sunday.
Grocery strike negotiations begin
San Francisco — Both sides in the strike against
some San Francisco Bay area supermarkets pre
pared yesterday tor a meeting with federal
mediators as the dispute moved into its fourth day.
The mediation session was scheduled for today
in San Francisco.
David Selvin, spokesman for the United Food
and Commercial workers union, said that "if the
employers are prepared to move, we may be able
to get on with realistic negotiations."
A lockout of clerks at four supermarket chains
which were not being struck went into effect yes
terday, leaving stores to operate with manage
ment and temporary personnel. Picketing con
tinued at Safeway stores in eight Northern Califor
nia counties, and at three Raley's stores in Vallejo,
Antioch and Pittsburgh.
Selvin said the main issue in the strike, which
began after clerks voted overwhelmingly Sunday
to reject a contract offer, is not money, but rather
what he termed "takeaways" in the food council's
offer.
"They want to increase by manyfold the number
of apprentices, starting at 55 percent of the experi
enced salary, and they want to increase the
number of part-time employees.
"This is an attack on full-time employees," said
Selvin. "They (employers) are driving to make it a
part-time industry."
Voters to decide oil company tax
Sacramento — An initiative to impose a new state
surtax on oil company profits qualified yesterday
for California's )une 3 ballot, but a measure to
change the rules for California's winner-take-all
Republican primary was headed for defeat.
The failure of the winner-take-all initiative —
sponsored by Republican foes of front-runner
Ronald Reagan — won't be official until today,
which is the deadline for placing initiatives on the
lune ballot.
But as soon as rejection is official, backers of the
initiative say they will go to court to attempt to get
that decision overturned.
At stake in that dispute is a revision of election
rules which could take 60 to 100 California dele
gates away from Reagan and give them to George
Bush, |ohn Connally and other COP candidates.
But even if the winner-take-all appeal plan fails,
the ]une } ballot will be loaded with controversial
propositions.

Khomeini hospitalized in Tehran
Tehran, Iran — Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini entered the Me/do Rezai Cardiology
Hospital here last night, his office in the holy city
of Qom announced.
The office said the ayatollah travelled from Qom
to the hospital in Tehran's northern suburbs yes
terday evening. He reportedly flew by helicopter
the % miles to the Iranian capital.
Earlier, the ayatollah's doctors issued a bulletin
stating that Iran's "revolutionary guide" was "in
good health."
But Khomeini's office announced he was suffer
ing from a slight illness. It said the ayatollah's "re
treat" from day-to-day activity announced )an. 11
would be extended to Feb. 9.
A spokesman at Mezdi Rezai hospital refused to
comment late last night.
Islamic students holding 50 Americans hostage
at the U.S. Embassy here yesterday announced
collective prayers at the embassy later today "for
the health of the imam."
Throughout yesterday, rumors that the ayatol
lah was seriously ill circulated here.
According to some reports, heart specialists had
been called to his bedside. The ayatollah's office in
Qom denied the reports, saying he was suffering
from a cold.
Doubts about Khomeini's health began last year
when he canceled all appointments for a three
week period from Nov. 16 to Dec. 5.
Panama denies shah is in custody
Panama City, Panama — The official spokesman
of the Panamanian government last night formally
denied that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
had been arrested, as had been announced by the
Iranian Foreign Ministry.
Word of the alleged arrest came from the Iranian
news agency Pars, which reported a personal tele
phone call from Panamanian President Aristides
Royo to Foreign Minister Sadegh Gotbzadeh, a
candidate for the Iranian presidency.
In Panama, a government television station and
Panamanian radio stations said the deposed shah
was "doing what he does every day"and there
were no signs that he was under arrest on the
resort island of Contadora, 35 miles southeast of
Panama City.
Panama's U.S. Ambassador, Carlos Lopez
Guevara, said he was authorized to "categorically
deny" the Iranian statements.
Earlier Panama said it would consider any Ira
nian request for the shah's extradition. But Royo
made clear that Iranian authorities would have to
comply with requirements of Panamanian legisla
tion on extradition.
House acts on Olympic transfer
Washington — Acting with unusual speed, the
House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday ap
proved with only one dissent a resolution support
ing President |immy Carter's request that the Un
ited States not participate in the 1980 Summer
Olympics Games unless they are transferred from
Moscow.
After listening to nearly five hours of testimony
from United States Olympic Committee (USOC)
President Robert Kane and Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, the committee took
only minutes to approve the resolution by a voice
vote.
The resolution, introduced by Chairman Cle
ment /ablocki (D-Wis.) and 31 others, calls for the
USOC to honor the request that it propose to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the
Moscow games be shifted to an alternative site or
canceled in repudiation of the Soviet invasion of

Afghanistan.
It further urges the lOC to adopt the proposal,
which lOC President Lord Killanin has adamantly
insisted it will not do. If the lOC rejects the prop
osal, the resolution urges that the USOC and the
Olympic committees ot other countries not par
ticipate in the 1980 Summer Olympics and instead
conduct "alternative games of their own."
The House Rules Committee agreed to meet in
special session on the resolution this morning and
is expected to clear the way for it to be brought to
the House floor this afternoon. It is expected to be
approved there swiftly and go immediately to the
Senate, where approval is also expected.
Barring an unforeseen snag, the resolution
should thus have the overwhelming endorsement
of both houses of Congress by the time the 86-
person USOC Executive Board meets in Colorado
Springs this weekend to consider the president's
request, as expressed in a letter to Kane last Sun
day.
