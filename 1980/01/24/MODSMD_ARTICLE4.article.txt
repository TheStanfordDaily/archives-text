From Daily wire services
Washington — President limmy
Carter called last night for the re
sumption of registration for the
military draft and declared that he is
prepared to use military force to pro
tect U.S. "vital interests" in the Per
sian Gulf.
In a sober State of the Union ad
dress to a joint session of Congress
and a national television audience,
Carter said the seizure of American
hostages in Iran and Soviet interven
tion in Afghanistan confront the Un
ited States with a broad challenge
that must be met in cooperation with
other nations.
The president denounced the
Soviet Union's "radical and aggres
sive" step of invading Afghanistan,
and warned the Soviets against milit
ary moves in the oil-rich Persian Gulf
region.
"An attempt by any outside force
to gain control of the Persian Gulf
region will be regarded as an assault
on the vital interests of the United
States," Carter said. "It will be repel
led by use of any means necessary,

including military force."
The president said he hoped that
military conscription through the
draft will not be necessary. But he
said he will send legislation and
budget proposals to Congress next
month to "revitalize" the Selective
Service System "so that we can begin
registration and then meet future
mobilization needs rapidly if they
arise."
Strengthen CIA
In response to the threat posed by
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
Carter also called for the removal of
"unwarranted restraints" on U.S. In
telligence agencies, and said the ad
ministration is now "making ar
rangements for key naval and air
facilities to be used by our forces in
the region of Northwest Africa and
the Persian Gulf."
He reiterated the U.S. pledge to
"assist Pakistan in resisting any out
side aggression" and to provide ad
ditional military and economic aid to
Pakistan, and said in the weeks ahead
"we will further strengthen political
and military ties with other nations in

the region."
Iran warned
Although Carter warned Iran again
that "if the American hostages are
harmed, a severe price will be paid,"
he said he will try "to persuade the
Iranian leaders that the real danger to
their nation lies to the north irom
Soviet troops in Afghanistan, and
that the unwarranted Iranian quarrel
with us hampers their response to
this greater danger."
Administration officials said the
draft registration legislation that the
president will send to Capitol Hill
next month will call for appropriation
of about $10 million tor the acceler
ated purchase of computers and for
the training of personnel to serve in
the moribund Selective Service Sys
tem.
But officials said the actual regist
ration of young Americans could not
begin until several months after pas
sage of the legislation.
Women to register?
They said it had not been decided
whether to require women to regis
ter for the draft — which would re
quire additional legislation — and
that decisions on the ages at which
young people would be required to
register had not been reached.
Of all the measures Carter has
taken in response to the Iranian crisis
and the invasion of Afghanistan, the
most politically risky was clearly his
call last night for renewed registra
tion for the draft. Earlier measures to
counter the Soviet invasion — the
partial embargo of grain shipments
and the threat to boycott this sum
mer's Olympic games in Moscow, for
example — touched relatively nar
row segments of American society
most deeply.
But registration is bound to raise
fears of later conscription, affecting
millions of Americans from the
young people who might be drafted
to their parents who remember the

experience of earlier drafts and war
time crises.
Threat
In keeping with the experience of
the last two months, the president
devoted about two-thirds of his
speech to foreign policy issues, par
ticularly the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan, which he said "could
pose the most serious threat to world
peace since the Second World War."
And his discussion of domestic is
sues dealt almost exclusively with a
demand for passage of energy legis
lation, which he said is necessary to
free the United States from "our de
pendence on foreign oil (that) is a
clear and present danger to our na
tional security."
Carter said he will hold U.S. oil
imports this year below 8.2 million
barrels a day, and will enforce that
policy with the imposition of an im
port fee if necessary. If serious oil
shortages arise this year, he said, "I
will not hesitate to impose mandat
ory gasoline rationing."
Carter reserved his toughest
rhetoric for the Soviet Union, which
he accused of using "its great military
power against a relatively defense
less nation."
'Pay a price'
"Verbal condemnation is not
enough," the president said. "The
Soviet Union must pay a concrete
price for its aggression. . . . The
Soviet Union must realize that its de
cision to use military force in Af
ghanistan will be costly to every polit
ical and economic relationship it val
ues."
In that connection, Carter reaf
firmed his belief that, "with Soviet
invading forces in Afghanistan,
neither the American people nor I
will support sending an Olympic
team to Moscow" this summer. On
Sunday, the president asked the U.S.
Olympic Committee to boycott the
Moscow games if Soviet troops are
not withdrawn from Afghanistan by
Feb. 20 and if the International
Olympic Committee refuses to move
or postpone the games.
Carter promised that the effort to
control nuclear weapons "will not be
abandoned," saying that "prevent
ing nuclear war is the foremost re
sponsibility of the two superpow
ers."
Declaring that "the 19f50s have
been born in turmoil and change,"
Carter said "it has never been more
clear that the state of our union de
pends on the state of the world.
"And tonight," he added, "as
throughout our generation, freedom
and peace in the world depend on
the state of the American union."
