# Sakharov denounced as threat to security
## 
### 
From wire and staff reports
The Soviet government newspaper
yesterday accused dissident leader
Andrei Sakharov of having "blurted
out" state secrets to Westerners and
said he had been banished from
Moscow for reasons of national sec
urity.
Izvestia's toughly worded denun
ciation of Sakharov was the fullest
authoritative explanation of the gov
ernment's action against the Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who was picked
up by police Tuesday, stripped of his
state honors and exiled from Mos
cow.
Before flying off, Sakharov told
family members he and his wife,
Yelena Bonner, were being sent to
Gorky, 250 miles east of here, an in
dustrial center closed to foreign re
porters. Friends and relatives said
yesterday they had received no new
word from Sakharov, and they made
a public demand for official confir
mation of his whereabouts.
The incident sparked immediate
reaction and criticism from profes

sors and students here, including
formation of a Stanford Committee
for Sakharov to help organize oppos
ition.
The Hillel foundation, in coopera
tion with other schools and organiza
tions in the Bay Area, is coordinating
a rally Friday at noon at the Soviet
consulate in San Francisco.
Brian Rosman, a member of the
committee for Sakharov, sent a letter
to President Richard Lyman and the
Council of Presidents asking them to
make a statement on the situation.
'Desolated'
Dr. Paul Flory, a Nobel prize win
ner and professor emeritus of
chemistry here, said "we were de
solated by the news, as were many
other people," but added that he was
not surprised by the Soviet move.
"In a way it's amazing that
Sakharov and his wife have remained
free so long. It's their high prestige in
the world that has kept them free
until now," he said.
Flory also said this action "calls for
strong responses" in the United

States.
The only way to effectively react to
the Soviets "is to deprive them of
what they want," which is technolog
ical information, he said. According
to Flory, "boycotting of official scien
tific meetings in the Soviet Union is
necessary."
Flory said he would like to main
tain contact with those Russian scien
tists "who eagerly want to have an
exchange of information and close
contacts with the West for their own
personal reasons," but that U.S. sci
entists must also avoid being
exploited by the Soviet hierarchy.
"There is no quick action that one
can take. It will require a long and
steady process," Flory added.
International protest
Meanwhile, international protests
over the punishment of the human
rights activist mounted.
Besides condemnations from
Western governments, the Com
munist parties of France, Spain and
Italy announced their opposition.
Communist Poland's government

media sounded a lone note of sup
port for the Kremlin.
The president of the French Na
tional Assembly, Jacques Chaban-
Delmas, cut short a visit to Moscow
in protest.
Spain's Communist Party, which
takes an independent line from Mos
cow, also joined in the growing con
demnation of the Soviets by saying,
"These arbitrary methods are a viola
tion of human rights and of democra
tic liberty." The party had also re
cently condemned the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan.
Attacks
The French and Spanish attacks fol
lowed a stinging editorial against the
Soviet move in the Italian Com
munist newspaper L'Unita and a
British denunciation on Tuesday.
The 58-year-old Sakharov, a nuc
lear physicist and winner of the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize, had become the
strongest voice of dissent in the
Soviet Union in recent years, meet
ing frequently with American and
other Western journalists to pub
licize alleged human rights viola
tions.
The lengthy Izvestia article came
close to calling him a traitor. It said
he had "stepped onto the path of
direct betrayal of the interests of our
motherland," and claimed in a later
passage he had "overstepped the
bounds of the law."
'Blurted out things'
At another point, the article said
that in meetings with foreigners
Sakharov — a key developer of the
Soviet Union's hydrogen bomb —
had often "blurted out things that
any government guards as an impor
tant secret."
An announcement Tuesday said
only that Sakharov's public honors
had been taken from him because of
his "subversive work."
"These measures were essential
for reasons including the fact that he
began to be used as a channel for
intelligence services of imperialist
powers to worm out important state
secrets of the Soviet Union," Izvestia
said.
It remains unclear whether Soviet
authorities plan to put Sakharov on
trial or will consider the summary
banishment and stripping of honors
to be sufficient punishment. Two
years ago another leading dissident,
Anatoly Shcharansky, was tried and
convicted of treasonable espionage
as a result of his contacts with Wes
terners.
