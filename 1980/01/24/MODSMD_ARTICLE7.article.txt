# Young, long-lasting blood given to anemia victims

The Washington Post
Washington — Thousands of persons with se
vere, life-shortening blood diseases may have
their lives extended by a new kind of blood
transfusion that gives them only young, long
lasting red cells.
Thirteen patients at Boston Children's Hospi
tal and one at the National Institute ot Health in
Bethesda, Md., are already getting these trans
fusions.
All have thalassemia, also known as Cooley's
anemia, a grim blood disorder of people of
Greek and Italian descent.
Within a year, NIH doctors hope to be treating
eight more thalassemia patients. Next month,
Boston doctors expect to start treating five pa
tients — mainly children — with severe sickle
cell anemia, a disease that affects one black in
400.
Hospitals in Chicago, Pittsburgh and Oakland
are about to begin treatment programs, and -
"soon there will be many others," Dr. Richard
Propper of Boston Children's predicted this
week.
Among other patients who could benefit are
those who need regular transfusions for
leukemfa, tor some lymphomas lymph system
cancers — or for other forms of anemia, espe
cially deadly aplastic anemia.
In all these, the new method could c ut in halt
the number of transfusions a patient needs.
"The big problem in repeated transfusions is
buildup of iron in the body," NlH's Dr. Harvey
Klein said yesterday. "We can remove some by a
chemical, a chelating agent. But over time the
iron buildup can lead to serious heart disease or
other disorders.
"Most thalassemia patients, without treat

ment, die very young. But cutting their transfu
sions in half, we should be able to diminish the
hazards very greatly, and extend the good the
transfusions can do."
The new treatment was demonstrated at NIH
this week by doctors who staff the blood bank
and hematology — blood disease — unit of
NlH's Clinical Center or research hospital.
The human body constantly makes new blood
cells, they explained. Each red cell lives about
120 days, then is replaced.
This means that when you get an ordinary
blood transfusion, you get a mix of old blood
cells and new. And if you have a chronic blood
disease, and need constant transfusions to keep
you well and alive, you may need a transfusion
every two to three weeks so you'll have enough
fresh, new red cells.
What the NIH and Boston doctors have
learned to do is separate new red cells, or neoc
ytes, from old ones. They do it bycentrifugingor
whirling the blood to separate the new cells,
which are lighter and larger than old ones.
The current NIH patient is Greek-descended
|udy lambis, 25, ot Washington. Two months
ago her brother, Nicholas, 27, died of thalas
semia.
lor one year now, she has been getting a red
cell transfusion every four to six weeks — three
pints ot packed cells from four to six donors.
"Right now I'm doing fine," she said at the
NIH hospital. "I got a transfusion last night, and
it perked me up. Next month I expect to be
going home."
Altogether, said Propper, "10,(X)0 to 15,000
persons in this country" could be given a better
chance for life.
