# Urban League head charges more poverty, unemployment
## Blacks fared worse than whites in 1970s 
### 
The Washington Post
Washington — National
Urban League President Ver
non Jordan said Tuesday that,
instead ol making the con
tinued progress they expected
at the start of the 19705, blacks
in America lost ground to
whites economically over the
last 10 years.
A decade ago, according to a
report released by the Urban
League in "The State of Black
America," black family income
averaged about b1 percent that
ot whites.
By 1978, however, it had
dropped to about 59 percent,
Census Bureau reports show.
The report said there are
more blacks in poverty today
than at the start of the 19705.
And black unemployment
(11.3 percent) is not only more
than twice as high as white un
employment (5.1 percent in
1979), but is actually higher
than it was in the 1960s and
much higher than at the start of
the 19705, when it was only 8.2
percent, the report continued.
"For some, a few," )ordan
told a news conference in re
leasing the report, "it's a little
better. But for the vast majority
of black people, they're all the
boat people without boats, cut
adrift on an ocean of discrimi
nation, poverty" and other so
cial ills.

Moreover, said )ordan in a
gloomy presentation, the in
ternational situation and"the
spirit of Proposition 13" have
led to a situation in which the
nation's attention and money
are being "focused on infla
tion, energy and defense to the
neglect of racial equality, full
employment and urban re
vitalization."
lordan said: "the same
people who charged that social
problems couldn't be solved
by throwing money at them are
anxious to try to solve interna
tional problems by throwing
money at the Pentagon."
The Urban League report
was issued just before Carter's
Budget Message to Congress,
in which program levels for all
the key anti-povertv programs
favored by the league will be
recommended by the presi
dent.
lordan made clear that the
report is intended to escalate
pressures on Carter and Con
gress not to abandon social

programs that will help blacks
because of the pressure of de
fense needs. Jordan, citing
President Truman, said na
tional security is as much a mat
ter of domestic strength as
military.
lordan also said the time has
come to put an end to any rift
between the U.S. black and
Jewish communities over Israel
policy and affirmative action.
"Blacks and Jews have too
much in common with one
another to remain at odds," he
said. He called on Jewish
groups, some of which have
resisted affirmative action
programs for blacks for fear
they will lead to quota systems,
to accept Supreme Court deci
sions in the Weber and Bakke
cases upholding certain types
of affirmative action.
In New York, a spokesman
for the American Jewish Con
gress and Union of American
Hebrew Congregations called
Jordan's remarks encouraging
and quoted Rabbi Alexander

Schindler, of the UAHC as say
ing "we must work together to
win the war on poverty . . .and
make real the promise of full
employment."
Although the Urban
League's 297-page report de
tailed progress here and there
for blacks, the section which
led it off, and which Jordan
emphasized, said blacks had
made very few economic gains
in the 1970s.
Figures cited by Dr. Bernard
Anderson, who did the
economic analysis for the re
port, or made available by the
Census Bureau, showed that in
real purchasing power, mea
sured in terms of constant 1978
dollars, the median family in
come of blacks in 1970 was
$10,544 and rose only to
$10,879 in 1978 (3.1) percent).
Whites, by contrast, had a $17
189 median in 1970 which rose
to $18,368 in 1978 (about (>.8
percent).
In 1969, there were 7,095,000

blacks below the poverty line,
and in 1978 the figure was
7,625,(KM) (a poverty rate of 30.6
percent), according to the Cen
sus Bureau. By contrast, the
number of whites below the
poverty line dropped from
16,659,000 to 16,259,000 bet
ween 1970 and 1978. The white
poverty rate was only 8.7 per
cent.
lordan said the picture in the
1970s wasn't all dismal — there
was an opening of job oppor
tunities for some, and new
educational opportunities. But
for the majority, facing a heavy
loss of jobs from the big un
employment crisis of the mid
70s and a softening of govern
ment efforts as a result of the
spirit of "benign neglect," he
said, "the 1970s were not a time
for progress within black
America," which suffered "a
mood of disappointment,
frustration and bitterness at
promises made and promises
unkept."

16,659,000 to 16,259,000 bet
ween 1970 and 1978. The white
poverty rate was only 8.7 per
cent.
lordan said the picture in the
1970s wasn't all dismal — there
was an opening of job oppor
tunities for some, and new
educational opportunities. But
for the majority, facing a heavy
loss of jobs from the big un
employment crisis of the mid
70s and a softening of govern
ment efforts as a result of the
spirit of "benign neglect," he
said, "the 1970s were not a time
for progress within black
America," which suffered "a
mood of disappointment,
frustration and bitterness at
promises made and promises
unkept."
The Washington Post
Washington — National
Urban League President Ver
non Jordan said Tuesday that,
instead ol making the con
tinued progress they expected
at the start of the 19705, blacks
in America lost ground to
whites economically over the
last 10 years.
A decade ago, according to a
report released by the Urban
League in "The State of Black
America," black family income
averaged about b1 percent that
ot whites.
By 1978, however, it had
dropped to about 59 percent,
Census Bureau reports show.
The report said there are
more blacks in poverty today
than at the start of the 19705.
And black unemployment
(11.3 percent) is not only more
than twice as high as white un
employment (5.1 percent in
1979), but is actually higher
than it was in the 1960s and
much higher than at the start of
the 19705, when it was only 8.2
percent, the report continued.
"For some, a few," )ordan
told a news conference in re
leasing the report, "it's a little
better. But for the vast majority
of black people, they're all the
boat people without boats, cut
adrift on an ocean of discrimi
nation, poverty" and other so
cial ills.

Moreover, said )ordan in a
gloomy presentation, the in
ternational situation and"the
spirit of Proposition 13" have
led to a situation in which the
nation's attention and money
are being "focused on infla
tion, energy and defense to the
neglect of racial equality, full
employment and urban re
vitalization."
lordan said: "the same
people who charged that social
problems couldn't be solved
by throwing money at them are
anxious to try to solve interna
tional problems by throwing
money at the Pentagon."
The Urban League report
was issued just before Carter's
Budget Message to Congress,
in which program levels for all
the key anti-povertv programs
favored by the league will be
recommended by the presi
dent.
lordan made clear that the
report is intended to escalate
pressures on Carter and Con
gress not to abandon social

programs that will help blacks
because of the pressure of de
fense needs. Jordan, citing
President Truman, said na
tional security is as much a mat
ter of domestic strength as
military.
lordan also said the time has
come to put an end to any rift
between the U.S. black and
Jewish communities over Israel
policy and affirmative action.
"Blacks and Jews have too
much in common with one
another to remain at odds," he
said. He called on Jewish
groups, some of which have
resisted affirmative action
programs for blacks for fear
they will lead to quota systems,
to accept Supreme Court deci
sions in the Weber and Bakke
cases upholding certain types
of affirmative action.
In New York, a spokesman
for the American Jewish Con
gress and Union of American
Hebrew Congregations called
Jordan's remarks encouraging
and quoted Rabbi Alexander

Schindler, of the UAHC as say
ing "we must work together to
win the war on poverty . . .and
make real the promise of full
employment."
Although the Urban
League's 297-page report de
tailed progress here and there
for blacks, the section which
led it off, and which Jordan
emphasized, said blacks had
made very few economic gains
in the 1970s.
Figures cited by Dr. Bernard
Anderson, who did the
economic analysis for the re
port, or made available by the
Census Bureau, showed that in
real purchasing power, mea
sured in terms of constant 1978
dollars, the median family in
come of blacks in 1970 was
$10,544 and rose only to
$10,879 in 1978 (3.1) percent).
Whites, by contrast, had a $17
189 median in 1970 which rose
to $18,368 in 1978 (about (>.8
percent).
In 1969, there were 7,095,000

blacks below the poverty line,
and in 1978 the figure was
7,625,(KM) (a poverty rate of 30.6
percent), according to the Cen
sus Bureau. By contrast, the
number of whites below the
poverty line dropped from
16,659,000 to 16,259,000 bet
ween 1970 and 1978. The white
poverty rate was only 8.7 per
