# Old Union rally draws 600
## Harris blasts Carter registration order 
### Jill Liscom 
President Jimmy Carter's move to
renew registration for the draft is in
tended to boost his re-election
chances, not to meet current U.S.
military needs, former Stanford
student-body president David Harris
told a noon anti-draft rally of 600 per
sons at White Plaza yesterday.
Although Carter has said he hopes
a draft will not be necessary, Harris
told the crowd not to be misled.
"The nature of the conscription
system is such that registration is in
and of itself the enactment of con
scription," he said.
"It's not simply a question of put
ting your name down," he con
tinued. "It's a question of enacting
an entire system."
Harris also attacked the argument
that registration is a necessary ele
ment of U.S. policy in the Middle
East.
"Suspending your liberties does
nothing for the Afghans; it does no
thing to bring our hostages home
from Iran; it does nothing to put (he
Soviet Union on notice that has not
already been done," Harris said.
"Our strategic problem in the
Middle East has nothing to do with
military affairs. We are not weak in
the Middle East because we only
have better than two million people
under arms," he said.
"Our weakness is right out there
on the freeway — go look at it."
"We are 'strung over a barrel' be
cause of our dependence on oil ex
ports, and this dependence has "put
us in a political situation where we
have little or no options to defend

what are the true interests of the Un
ited States," Harris said.
Because of its addiction to pet
roleum, America spends its diploma
tic and economic energy "trying to
supply our habit," he added. "Enact
gas rationing tomorrow and the
Middle East will be more stable than
it has been in 20 years. If we are un
willing to do that, we can quadruple
the sizeof our military, station half of
them on the Persian Gulf, and there
will be no more stability than be
fore."
Harris warned students that Carter
is sacrificing their liberties for his
own re-election.
"He's no fool," Harris said. Carter
has realized that "the more you wave
your sword, the higher you go" in
popularity polls, and has chosen
"the politically expedient thing to
do."
"If you act like a man who's going
to kill Arabs, you're going to be a very
popular person in this country for
awhile; it doesn't matter that you're
leading us over a precipice from
which we may never crawl qut."
Harris, .54, spent 20 months in fed
eral prison for draft evasion during
the Vietnam war. According to him,
the draft "is a suspension of the liber
ties guaranteed to everyone under
the age of 26 by the United States
Constitution."
Harris claimed Carter "has asked
to be given control of an entire gen
eration of young people.
According to Harris, enacting con
scription is only justifiable under a
national emergency. "But where is
the national emergency? If indeed it

is a national emergency, then why is
it a national emergency only for
people under 26?" he questioned.
Harris charged that the govern
ment is making young people
"shoulder everybody else's macho
notions of how )ohn Wayne ought to
behave in the present situaton."
Harris also stressed that young
people need to take themselves and
their Constitution seriously, because
"you don't have anything else but
that. Vou give that up, and the only
thing that's left is gas stations."

If Congress enacts Carter's prop
osal, Harris said the day Carter gave
his State of the Union speech will be
"the last day that any of you, until you
reach the age of 26, make a free, un
fettered decision about your life and
the way it will be pursued."
The government "will not take
your life any more seriously than you
take it yourself," Harris told the stu
dents, adding that they should
"make Jimmy Carter pay a price" for

taking their lives too lightly.
"There may be a day when you
look up from a rice paddy and wish to
God you had gotten a hold of things
before it got this far," Harris warned.
If young people don't speak out
before Congress enacts draft legisla
tion, he concluded, "it's going to be
shoved down your throats and you
will find yourselves gagging."
Following Harris' 20-minute
speech, representatives from other
organizations such as the Stanford
Libertarians, Students Against Con
scription, and People Against Milit
ary Intervention in Iran, spoke
briefly.
To conclude the rally, a large imita
tion draft card was set on fire as stu
dents stood chanting "hell no, we
won't go" and "peace plus draft
equals war."
The rally, sponsored by People
Against the Draft, was the second
anti-draft demonstration held here
since Carter made his State of the
Union address. Wednesday night
about 100 students marched around
campus with candles chanting anti
draft slogans. Another rally is
scheduled here for Monday af noon,
featuring anti-war activist Daniel
Ellsbergand Assoc.History Prof. Bar
ton Bernstein.

organizations such as the Stanford
Libertarians, Students Against Con
scription, and People Against Milit
ary Intervention in Iran, spoke
briefly.
To conclude the rally, a large imita
tion draft card was set on fire as stu
dents stood chanting "hell no, we
won't go" and "peace plus draft
equals war."
The rally, sponsored by People
Against the Draft, was the second
anti-draft demonstration held here
since Carter made his State of the
Union address. Wednesday night
about 100 students marched around
campus with candles chanting anti
draft slogans. Another rally is
scheduled here for Monday af noon,
featuring anti-war activist Daniel
Ellsbergand Assoc.History Prof. Bar
ton Bernstein.
President Jimmy Carter's move to
renew registration for the draft is in
tended to boost his re-election
chances, not to meet current U.S.
military needs, former Stanford
student-body president David Harris
told a noon anti-draft rally of 600 per
sons at White Plaza yesterday.
Although Carter has said he hopes
a draft will not be necessary, Harris
told the crowd not to be misled.
"The nature of the conscription
system is such that registration is in
and of itself the enactment of con
scription," he said.
"It's not simply a question of put
ting your name down," he con
tinued. "It's a question of enacting
an entire system."
Harris also attacked the argument
that registration is a necessary ele
ment of U.S. policy in the Middle
East.
"Suspending your liberties does
nothing for the Afghans; it does no
thing to bring our hostages home
from Iran; it does nothing to put (he
Soviet Union on notice that has not
already been done," Harris said.
"Our strategic problem in the
Middle East has nothing to do with
military affairs. We are not weak in
the Middle East because we only
have better than two million people
under arms," he said.
"Our weakness is right out there
on the freeway — go look at it."
"We are 'strung over a barrel' be
cause of our dependence on oil ex
ports, and this dependence has "put
us in a political situation where we
have little or no options to defend

what are the true interests of the Un
ited States," Harris said.
Because of its addiction to pet
roleum, America spends its diploma
tic and economic energy "trying to
supply our habit," he added. "Enact
gas rationing tomorrow and the
Middle East will be more stable than
it has been in 20 years. If we are un
willing to do that, we can quadruple
the sizeof our military, station half of
them on the Persian Gulf, and there
will be no more stability than be
fore."
Harris warned students that Carter
is sacrificing their liberties for his
own re-election.
"He's no fool," Harris said. Carter
has realized that "the more you wave
your sword, the higher you go" in
popularity polls, and has chosen
"the politically expedient thing to
do."
"If you act like a man who's going
to kill Arabs, you're going to be a very
popular person in this country for
awhile; it doesn't matter that you're
leading us over a precipice from
which we may never crawl qut."
Harris, .54, spent 20 months in fed
eral prison for draft evasion during
the Vietnam war. According to him,
the draft "is a suspension of the liber
ties guaranteed to everyone under
the age of 26 by the United States
Constitution."
Harris claimed Carter "has asked
to be given control of an entire gen
eration of young people.
According to Harris, enacting con
scription is only justifiable under a
national emergency. "But where is
the national emergency? If indeed it

is a national emergency, then why is
it a national emergency only for
people under 26?" he questioned.
Harris charged that the govern
ment is making young people
"shoulder everybody else's macho
notions of how )ohn Wayne ought to
behave in the present situaton."
Harris also stressed that young
people need to take themselves and
their Constitution seriously, because
"you don't have anything else but
that. Vou give that up, and the only
thing that's left is gas stations."

If Congress enacts Carter's prop
osal, Harris said the day Carter gave
his State of the Union speech will be
"the last day that any of you, until you
reach the age of 26, make a free, un
fettered decision about your life and
the way it will be pursued."
The government "will not take
your life any more seriously than you
take it yourself," Harris told the stu
dents, adding that they should
"make Jimmy Carter pay a price" for

taking their lives too lightly.
"There may be a day when you
look up from a rice paddy and wish to
God you had gotten a hold of things
before it got this far," Harris warned.
If young people don't speak out
before Congress enacts draft legisla
tion, he concluded, "it's going to be
shoved down your throats and you
will find yourselves gagging."
