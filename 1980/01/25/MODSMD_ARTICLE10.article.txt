"If a plane travels from
Washington, D.C. to Boston in
80 minutes and returns in one
hour and 20 minutes, how do
you explain the time differ
ence?"
"Which of Napoleon's gen
erals had a name that sounded
like a herbivorous mammal?"
Although these and other
similar questions may not

stump you, the time factor in
volved in answering them
might be crucial if you're a par
ticipant in the annual College
Bowl.
Cited as "the varsity sport of
the mind," the College Bowl is
an intellectual competition be
tween four-man teams from
participating schools who play
at regional, national and inter
national levels.

Stanford had been active in
the College Bowl for the past
two years. In 1978, the Stanford
team won the National Champ
ionship, bringing back a prize
of $7500 in scholarship funds.
Sponsored by Student Arts at
Stanford (STARTS), this year's
campus tournament should
prove to be an exciting battle
between 20 teams, each hop

ing to represent Stanford in the
regional competition at UCLA
in February.
Steve Poizner, coordinator
of the STARTS effort, described
the campus contest. The teams
will receivepoints for each cor
rectly answered question in a
20-minute single elimination
round. The contestants are
quizzed on history, literature
and the sciences.
At the campus tournament,
emphasis will be mainly on re
call and speed of response, he
said.
Peter Friedland, who headed
the 1978 Championship team
and is now prime organizer of
the campus tournament, esti
mated that 75 to 80 percent of
the questions at the local tour
nament will be answered cor
rectly, and that the fastest team
will probably win.
The questions are much
more specific in the higher
levels of competition, and a
team that has a balanced know
ledge of the humanities and
sciences will have a better
chance of winning.
The campus tournament will
be held at 10 a.m. tomorrow in
rooms 270 and 271 atTresidder.
Poizner described the compet
ition as "an extremely lively
event"and invited the public
to attend.
Who knows, you may even
learn something. Can you
name the halogen elements?
What about listing all the coun
tries in Africa?
And by the way, there's no
time difference between 80
minutes and one hour and 20
minutes, and Napoleon's gen
eral's name was Michael Ney.
