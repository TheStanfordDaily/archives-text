# Dorm runs beginning this weekend
## Students start deli delivery 
### Dianne Cahoon 
You've just been hit by an
excruciating case of the late
night hunger pangs, and
you're in a bit of a quandary.
Your roommate has the car for
the evening, so you can't make a
lack's run. Furthermore,
you re pizza'd out after five
straight nights of that staple.
What's to be done to al
leviate your pain! 1 Just say hello
to Deli.
Beginning Sunday night,
employees of a student-run,
after-hours, delicatessen
sandwich delivery service, cal
led Hello Deli, will be roaming
dorm halls from 10 to 11:30
with delectable tidbits for the
starving masses. For $1.90 a fix,
one will be able to purchase a
roast beef, turkey, ham and
»swiss or vegetarian special
mouthful.
In searching for an interest
ing avocation, enterprising and
business-oriented juniors
Craig Foster and Jonathon Sla
ter decided to start the busi
ness of Hello Deli last quarter.
Getting off the ground toward
the end of the quarter by using
an off-campus catering service,
the two discovered that the

operation was "kind of shaky
because deliveries from off
campus were unstable," Foster
said. "We were ordering all the
meats and ingredients ourse
lves and telling them how to
make the sandwiches," said
senior Hans Fredericks, who
joined the outfit this quarter
with junior Brad Heinz when
Slater went overseas.
Profit spread
Still, Hello Deli managed to
sell around 90 sandwiches per
night at a profit of about 30
cents per sandwich, Foster es
timated. "Actually, the price is
pretty reasonable," he
claimed. "By the time we pay
everyone, we don't make
much, and if we don't sell ev
erything, that's a loss of at least
$1 a sandwich," he added.
"This quarter we know our
problems and plan to be a lot
more organized than last quar
ter," Foster said. Striving for a
regular schedule, the Hello
Deli managers will order pre

pared sandwiches from the
same caterer and send out six
people laden with sandwich
packed straw baskets to the
student residences each Sun
day through Thursday night.
"We hope that each deli
verer will spend a set 15 mi
nutes in each house of a com
plex," Foster said.
Favorable reaction
Fredericks said they adver
tised in the Daily for help, and
"Now we have a professor who
wants to work for us every
night."
Student reaction to the
sandwich venture was favora
ble last quarter, according to
Foster. "For the most part, they
were pretty nice and even gave
us little ideas," he said. He said
heand Fredericks are currently
attempting to establish a pri
vate Hello Deli hotline to ena
ble interested parties to tele
phone with queries and
suggestions.
