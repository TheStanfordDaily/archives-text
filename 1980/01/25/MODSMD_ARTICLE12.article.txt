# BUG ME
## 
### Andrew Rich 
Here's an interesting statistic for you: only
one out of every five questions ! receive is from
somebody who's bugged by something â€” the
rest are just for information. Maybe I should
have a different name. "Ask Me Anything" is too
boring. "Fun Facts to Know and Tell" has been
used. Any other suggestions?
While you're pondering possible appellations
for this column, I'll take care of some of my mail.
Dear Bug Me,
I'm very interested in the status of women
professors at Stanford. Could you please give
me the statistical breakdown of women here in
such categories as tenured, untenured, and by
departments?
Sincerely, M.A.
I can do it by school, and I'll even tell you how
many of them are minority women. Humanities
and Sciences has 55 women on the faculty, 22 of
whom are tenured, and six of whom are
minorities. The Medical School has 36 women:
one-fourth have tenure, and none are
minorities.
After these two schools, there are just a smat
tering of female faculty here. Business has two,
Education has five, Law and Engineering have
three each, and Earth Sciences has two. In the
"miscellaneous" department there is one other
woman, making a grand total of 107. Thirty-five
of these women are tenured, or roughly 33 per
cent; eight are minorities (Asian or Black).
Compare this to the 1106 male faculty, 68 per
cent of whom are tenured, and draw your own
conclusions.
By the way, Valerie Veronin at the Academic
Planning Office, to whom I am greatly indebted
for this info, has the statistics for individual de
partments within each school.
Bugger:
I find myself going home along Palm Drive in
the wee hours of the night depressingly often.
Every time I get to the Arboretum Rd. traffic light
just as it turns red, I while away the time by
re-explaining to myself that the University has
more important things to do with its money than

to install sensors in the road that would enable
the light to act in a rational manner. Recently, I
have found myself rebutting with the argument
that the long cycle time could be shortened in
the late evening, thereby giving those who get
caught only enough time to enter the second
stage of sleep, rather than REM. An even better
alternative would be to have the light blink after
Worll p.m., just as those in Palo Alto do. I can't
imagine why the appropriate authorities have
not implemented one of these ideas already;
perhaps the police get a kick out of ticketing
those who choose not to wait for a green light.
No, they haven't nabbed me, but just think of all
the time and gas that could be saved!
I remain, etc., D.F.
"It's an old signal," said Captain William
Wullschleger of Police Services, "and I'm not
sure whether it has the capability to be altered."
Wullschleger added that Police Services would
get involved if it was decided to change the light,
but that Service Operations would be the place
to inquire as to the feasibility of change.
Al Cenevro, Coordinator at Service Opera
tions, said that the University has a traffic com
mittee which would have to decide such an is
sue. He added that Bruce Wiggins, Manager of
Operations, would be the person to whom D.F.
should present his suggestion.
At one time Service Operations was thinking
of having the signal blink at night, Cenevro said,
but Palo Alto and the State of California told the
University that they would prefer that it didn't.
Here's an interesting question to think about as
you walk to class today:
Dear Bug Me,
Maybe all the threats of nuclearwar are getting
to me, but isn't it true that the Defense Depart
ment is building silos for the MX missile system
in White Plaza?
Nearly Nuked in Naranja
Defense Department spokesmen could not
be reached for comment.
As for your comments, send them to the
Daily, Storke Publications Building, Stanford.
