# THE STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Miller Aid to Afghan resistance needed 
### 
The people of America have been out
raged by the ongoing Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. Unfortunately, President
Jimmy Carter's response to that invasion
has exhibited the ineffectuality and lack of
imagination that we have come to expect
from this administration.
This attempted conquest of another
country by the Soviet Union should sur
prise no one.
In socialist states such as the U.S.S.R.,
the ruling political elite has total control
over economic resources and production.
The state and the economy are fused into
one. The geographical extent of the
socialist economy is therefore rigidly li
mited by the boundaries of the socialist
state.
Under a regime of pure laissez-faire
capitalism, a world market exists which
makes access to goods and resources in
dependent of national boundaries.
Capitalism provides a peaceful
mechanism for international economic in
tegration.
Under socialism, on the other hand, ac
cess to and control of resources and rigidly
limited by national boundaries. For a
socialist state, the only effective way to
expand the economy geographically and
to gain access to new resources is to ex
pand the boundaries of the state.
The time-honored method of expanding
the boundaries of the state is, of course,
military conquest.
War and imperialist expansionism are,
therefore, natural results of the dynamics
of socialist society. Under socialism, the
only effective method of international in
tegration is military domination.
The U.S.S.R. and other members of the
socialist bloc have demonstrated this fact
repeatedly: the Soviet conquest of the Bal

tic republics; the Soviet invasions of Fin
land and Poland when the Soviet socialists
were allied with the German National
Socialists; the Soviet conquest of Eastern
Europe; the Soviet-imposed counter
revolutions in Hungary in 1956 and in
Czechoslovakia in 1968; the Sino-Soviet
clashes; the recent Sino-Vietnamese war;
the Vietnamese conquest of Cambodia,
etc.
Of course, after conquering Eastern
Europe, the Soviets engaged in massive
economic exploitation of the resources
and people of the captive nations. The ul
timate economic goal of the current Soviet
actions in Afghanistan is control of the oil
resources of the Persian Gulf region.
But how should we Americans react to
this latest act of Soviet socialist aggres
sion?
Carter's grain emgargo, the centerpiece
of his response to the U.S.S.R., is a joke.
The embargo in no way harms the Soviet
ruling class, reduces Soviet military power
or deters Soviet aggression. Its only effect
on the U.S.S.R. is to reduce the quality of
the food doled out to the Soviet masses.
Furthermore, Carter has no right to re
strict the right of American farmers to
trade with whomever they wish.
Military intervention by the United
States in Afghanistan is out of the ques
tion. Such action would produce censure
by much of the world, higher taxes for
Americans, a resumption of the draft and
most important, the risk of nuclear con
frontation with the Soviet Union.
While we should not intervene directly,
we should be concerned that the Afghan
resistance fighters receive adequate arms
and supplies to sustain their struggle
against the Soviet socialist imperialists.
Needed weapons, ammunition and

supplies could be provided directly by the
U.S. government. However, there is a risk
that such direct government aid might be
the beginning of an ever-widening U.S.
military involvement: remember how we
slid into Vietnam.
Also, U.S. government aid would in
volve all American taxpayers, including
those who are pacifists or who are for
other reasons opposed to aiding the Af
ghan freedom-fighters.
For these reasons, it would be best to
allow and encourage non-governmental
aid from private American citizens and or
ganizations.
To this end, Congress should im
mediately suspend any laws or regulations
which impede the transfer of arms to the
Afghans. Congress should also establish a
100 percent tax credit for any contribu
tions to the Afghan cause.
Such a program would encourage
Americans who are sincerely concerned
about Soviet aggression and Afghan free
dom to back up their rhetoric with action.
By voluntarily contributing their time,
effort and money to provide aid to the
Afghan resistance, Americans could — if
this program were enacted — de
monstrate to the Soviets and to the world
that we do not accept the extension of
totalitarian tyranny.
The present Congress and administra
tion are not likely to create such a program
during the current crisis. But this crisis will
surely be repeated in the future: the appe
tite of the Russian bear is far from sated.
And by considering the type of innova
tive program suggested here, we will be
better prepared to deal with future Af
ghanistans when they occur.
