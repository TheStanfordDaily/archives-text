## Misunderstanding prompted attacks 
### 
I would like to respond to
some of the attacks that were
made against me and my col
umn, "America is oppressor in
Iran" (Daily, |an. 9). I believe
that some of those attacks were
the results of innocent misun
derstanding of what I said and
that some are the result of a
misunderstanding of the
whole crisis and its possible
implications.
The column by Michael
Economides (Daily, Jan. 14) is
an example of the latter. Aside
from his crude and rude lan
guage, and aside from his un
concealed suspicion and dis
like for anything Islamic (both
privileges of which he is enti
tled to), Economides' basic
thesis is that the embassy crisis
will result in "something that
the U.S. military-industrial
complex and the CIA were un
able to do in 35 years: a resurge
of American militarism and im
perialistic interventionism."
May I remind Economides that
the Iranian Revolution is the
hardest blow the M-l-C has re
ceived in 35 years.
Not only have the Iranian re
volutionaries cancelled arms
purchases from the United
States, they have actually asked
the U.S. government to "buy
back" weapons the M-l-C had
previously sold to the shah.
The U.S. government refused
to take the arms back and these
are now rusting away in Iranian
storehouses.
Economides believes that
the embassy take-over will give
the United States what it was
"seeking for years and the shah
could not deliver: a dynamic
presence in the Middle East."
This is a very naive statement.
When did the United States
lack a dynamic presence in the
Middle East? What were 50,000
American "experts" doing in
the shah's Iran? What is Sadat,
if not a U.S. "dynamic" pre
sence in the Middle East? What
are the U.S. military bases in
Turkey if they are not a
"dynamic" presence in the
Middle East? How more
dynamic can the U.S. presence
in the Middle East be if you re
member that Israel is in the
very heart of the Middle East?
Alex Dragnich (Daily, Jan. 16)
seems to have an intellectual
bent for the law or, at least,,
some sides of the law. He
quotes Articles 22, 29 and 31 of
the Vienna Convention of 1961
which provide that "the pre
mises of the mission shall be

inviolable," that "the person of
a diplomatic agent should be
inviolable" and that "a dip
lomatic agent shall enjoy im
munity from criminal persecu
tion of the receiving state . . ."
consecutively.
I would like to remind Drag
nich that, first, Iran was not
one of the signatories of the
Vienna Convention. Second,
assuming that the Convention
was somehow holy law and
mystically binding to the Ira
nian students, Dragnich, for
the sake of academic honesty,
should have read in the Con
vention itself some articles that
would have made his argument
against the students' action ir
relevant.
For example, Paragraph 1 of
Article 3 of the same Vienna
Convention lists the functions
of a diplomatic mission and
none of these functions jus
tifies the subversive activities
the Iranian students accuse the
U.S. mission of having en
gaged in.
Paragraph 1 of Article 41
states that "it is the duty of all
persons enjoying such (dip
lomatic) privileges and im
munities to respect the laws
and regulations of the receiv
ing State. They also have a duty
not to interfere in the internal
affairs of that State."
Paragraph 3 of Article 41
states that the premises of the
mission must not be used in
any manner incompatible with
the functions of the mission as
laid down in the present Con
vention." As I mentioned in my
column, the Iranian students
accuse some of the American
embassy's personnel of having
trained the SAVAK agents, of
having cooperated with the
shah's regime against his op
ponents, and of having used
the embassy compound for
espionage.
Needless to say, when the
Iranian students decided to
occupy the U.S. embassy they
did not consult law books to
see whether these books were
or were not in their favor. They
acted in anger and frustration.
And although they have the
sympathy and understanding
of the Revolutionary Govern
ment in Iran, they aid not act
on orders or encouragement
from it.
International conventions
are made with the purpose of
preserving world order. But,
who benefits from the world
order? Unfortunately for hu
manity, there are many groups
in the world who are cruelly
victimized forthe sakeofworld
order, an order that is often
based on injustice.
International agreements
and conventions may be sac
red in the eyes of those who
benefit from them. To those
who are downtrodden and
tyrannized by all or one of the
signatories, or as a result, of

these conventions and agree
ments, the latterare symbols of
crime and injustice and they
must be broken and ridiculed.
Stop, for a while, and think
of how much injustice has
been inflicted as a result of
some of the world's most
celebrated treaties, agree
ments and documents. Do you
think, forexample, that the fact
that South Africa's racist gov
ernment is recognized by all of
the West and many other states
has any effect in convincing
South Africa's blacks that that
government is legitimate?
World recognition of South Af
rica's government means no
thing but injustice to South Af
rica's blacks.
I do not see the seizure of
foreign embassies as a solution
to international injustices but I
have to be sympathetic when a
downtrodden group of people
seizes the embassy of an op
pressive government in order
to make their injustices known
to the world. It is important,
though, to remember that that
is exactly what the Iranian stu
dents are doing. They have not
mistreated their hostages.
By the testimony of Ameri
can witnesses, the hostages are
well-fed, are allowed to exer
cise daily, to read and write,
receive presents and watch
football games.
On the other hand, in the
peace - and - order - loving
America, where international
law is so sacred, at least a
dozen Iranians have been
murdered. Thousands of Ira
nian nationals and Iranian-
Americans have been fired
from their jobs. Tens of
thousands of Iranian students
and citizens have been ter
rorized and intimidated by
both the American public and
the U.S. government.
On a less serious level, I do
not understand why Brett
Kingstone (Daily, Jan. 14) was
"stunned and shocked" by my
column. I don't know what
gave him the impression that I
hate his country. I certainly
don't. But, if his country is
wrong I think even he should
admit that and try to correct it.
I don't understand why
Rosemary Ciernick (Daily, Jan.
14) was so angry either. I never
"ate (her) food and insulted
(her) at (her) table." "I have
never cost the American tax

payer a single penny.
I don't understand why she
feels "very betrayed" by me
and the Iranians. I don't recall
her doing me any favors for
which I should be grateful.
I am not Iranian, but I
checked with some Iranian
students and they told me they
don't recall being done any
favors by Ciernick or being
treated with the "warm and
generous hospitality" she says
she has given them. Further
more, I asked them if they
"lack personal pride" as she
charged in her letters. They
said they don't lack personal
pride.

I don't understand why she

her doing me any favors for

I am not Iranian, but I
checked with some Iranian
students and they told me they
don't recall being done any
favors by Ciernick or being
treated with the "warm and
generous hospitality" she says
she has given them. Further
more, I asked them if they
"lack personal pride" as she

said they don't lack personal

I would like to respond to
some of the attacks that were
made against me and my col
umn, "America is oppressor in
Iran" (Daily, |an. 9). I believe
that some of those attacks were
the results of innocent misun
derstanding of what I said and
that some are the result of a
misunderstanding of the
whole crisis and its possible
implications.
The column by Michael
Economides (Daily, Jan. 14) is
an example of the latter. Aside
from his crude and rude lan
guage, and aside from his un
concealed suspicion and dis
like for anything Islamic (both
privileges of which he is enti
tled to), Economides' basic
thesis is that the embassy crisis
will result in "something that
the U.S. military-industrial
complex and the CIA were un
able to do in 35 years: a resurge
of American militarism and im
perialistic interventionism."
May I remind Economides that
the Iranian Revolution is the
hardest blow the M-l-C has re
ceived in 35 years.
Not only have the Iranian re
volutionaries cancelled arms
purchases from the United
States, they have actually asked
the U.S. government to "buy
back" weapons the M-l-C had
previously sold to the shah.
The U.S. government refused
to take the arms back and these
are now rusting away in Iranian
storehouses.
Economides believes that
the embassy take-over will give
the United States what it was
"seeking for years and the shah
could not deliver: a dynamic
presence in the Middle East."
This is a very naive statement.
When did the United States
lack a dynamic presence in the
Middle East? What were 50,000
American "experts" doing in
the shah's Iran? What is Sadat,
if not a U.S. "dynamic" pre
sence in the Middle East? What
are the U.S. military bases in
Turkey if they are not a
"dynamic" presence in the
Middle East? How more
dynamic can the U.S. presence
in the Middle East be if you re
member that Israel is in the
very heart of the Middle East?
Alex Dragnich (Daily, Jan. 16)
seems to have an intellectual
bent for the law or, at least,,
some sides of the law. He
quotes Articles 22, 29 and 31 of
the Vienna Convention of 1961
which provide that "the pre
mises of the mission shall be

inviolable," that "the person of
a diplomatic agent should be
inviolable" and that "a dip
lomatic agent shall enjoy im
munity from criminal persecu
tion of the receiving state . . ."
consecutively.
I would like to remind Drag
nich that, first, Iran was not
one of the signatories of the
Vienna Convention. Second,
assuming that the Convention
was somehow holy law and
mystically binding to the Ira
nian students, Dragnich, for
the sake of academic honesty,
should have read in the Con
vention itself some articles that
would have made his argument
against the students' action ir
relevant.
For example, Paragraph 1 of
Article 3 of the same Vienna
Convention lists the functions
of a diplomatic mission and
none of these functions jus
tifies the subversive activities
the Iranian students accuse the
U.S. mission of having en
gaged in.
Paragraph 1 of Article 41
states that "it is the duty of all
persons enjoying such (dip
lomatic) privileges and im
munities to respect the laws
and regulations of the receiv
ing State. They also have a duty
not to interfere in the internal
affairs of that State."
Paragraph 3 of Article 41
states that the premises of the
mission must not be used in
any manner incompatible with
the functions of the mission as
laid down in the present Con
vention." As I mentioned in my
column, the Iranian students
accuse some of the American
embassy's personnel of having
trained the SAVAK agents, of
having cooperated with the
shah's regime against his op
ponents, and of having used
the embassy compound for
espionage.
Needless to say, when the
Iranian students decided to
occupy the U.S. embassy they
did not consult law books to
see whether these books were
or were not in their favor. They
acted in anger and frustration.
And although they have the
sympathy and understanding
of the Revolutionary Govern
ment in Iran, they aid not act
on orders or encouragement
from it.
International conventions
are made with the purpose of
preserving world order. But,
who benefits from the world
order? Unfortunately for hu
manity, there are many groups
in the world who are cruelly
victimized forthe sakeofworld
order, an order that is often
based on injustice.
International agreements
and conventions may be sac
red in the eyes of those who
benefit from them. To those
who are downtrodden and
tyrannized by all or one of the
signatories, or as a result, of

these conventions and agree
ments, the latterare symbols of
crime and injustice and they
must be broken and ridiculed.
Stop, for a while, and think
of how much injustice has
been inflicted as a result of
some of the world's most
celebrated treaties, agree
ments and documents. Do you
think, forexample, that the fact
that South Africa's racist gov
ernment is recognized by all of
the West and many other states
has any effect in convincing
South Africa's blacks that that
government is legitimate?
World recognition of South Af
rica's government means no
thing but injustice to South Af
rica's blacks.
I do not see the seizure of
foreign embassies as a solution
to international injustices but I
have to be sympathetic when a
downtrodden group of people
seizes the embassy of an op
pressive government in order
to make their injustices known
to the world. It is important,
though, to remember that that
is exactly what the Iranian stu
dents are doing. They have not
mistreated their hostages.
By the testimony of Ameri
can witnesses, the hostages are
well-fed, are allowed to exer
cise daily, to read and write,
receive presents and watch
football games.
On the other hand, in the
peace - and - order - loving
America, where international
law is so sacred, at least a
dozen Iranians have been
murdered. Thousands of Ira
nian nationals and Iranian-
Americans have been fired
from their jobs. Tens of
thousands of Iranian students
and citizens have been ter
rorized and intimidated by
both the American public and
the U.S. government.
On a less serious level, I do
not understand why Brett
Kingstone (Daily, Jan. 14) was
"stunned and shocked" by my
column. I don't know what
gave him the impression that I
hate his country. I certainly
don't. But, if his country is
wrong I think even he should
admit that and try to correct it.
I don't understand why
Rosemary Ciernick (Daily, Jan.
14) was so angry either. I never
"ate (her) food and insulted
(her) at (her) table." "I have
never cost the American tax

payer a single penny.

On a less serious level, I do
not understand why Brett
Kingstone (Daily, Jan. 14) was
"stunned and shocked" by my
column. I don't know what
gave him the impression that I
hate his country. I certainly
don't. But, if his country is
wrong I think even he should
admit that and try to correct it.
I don't understand why
Rosemary Ciernick (Daily, Jan.
14) was so angry either. I never
"ate (her) food and insulted
(her) at (her) table." "I have
never cost the American tax

payer a single penny.
I don't understand why she
feels "very betrayed" by me
and the Iranians. I don't recall
her doing me any favors for
which I should be grateful.
I am not Iranian, but I
checked with some Iranian
students and they told me they
don't recall being done any
favors by Ciernick or being
treated with the "warm and
generous hospitality" she says
she has given them. Further
more, I asked them if they
"lack personal pride" as she
charged in her letters. They
said they don't lack personal
pride.

I would like to respond to
some of the attacks that were
made against me and my col
umn, "America is oppressor in
Iran" (Daily, |an. 9). I believe
that some of those attacks were
the results of innocent misun
derstanding of what I said and
that some are the result of a
misunderstanding of the
whole crisis and its possible
implications.
The column by Michael
Economides (Daily, Jan. 14) is
an example of the latter. Aside
from his crude and rude lan
guage, and aside from his un
concealed suspicion and dis
like for anything Islamic (both
privileges of which he is enti
tled to), Economides' basic
thesis is that the embassy crisis
will result in "something that
the U.S. military-industrial
complex and the CIA were un
able to do in 35 years: a resurge
of American militarism and im
perialistic interventionism."
May I remind Economides that
the Iranian Revolution is the
hardest blow the M-l-C has re
ceived in 35 years.
Not only have the Iranian re
volutionaries cancelled arms
purchases from the United
States, they have actually asked
the U.S. government to "buy
back" weapons the M-l-C had
previously sold to the shah.
The U.S. government refused
to take the arms back and these
are now rusting away in Iranian
storehouses.
Economides believes that
the embassy take-over will give
the United States what it was
"seeking for years and the shah
could not deliver: a dynamic
presence in the Middle East."
This is a very naive statement.
When did the United States
lack a dynamic presence in the
Middle East? What were 50,000
American "experts" doing in
the shah's Iran? What is Sadat,
if not a U.S. "dynamic" pre
sence in the Middle East? What
are the U.S. military bases in
Turkey if they are not a
"dynamic" presence in the
Middle East? How more
dynamic can the U.S. presence
in the Middle East be if you re
member that Israel is in the
very heart of the Middle East?
Alex Dragnich (Daily, Jan. 16)
seems to have an intellectual
bent for the law or, at least,,
some sides of the law. He
quotes Articles 22, 29 and 31 of
the Vienna Convention of 1961
which provide that "the pre
mises of the mission shall be

inviolable," that "the person of
a diplomatic agent should be
inviolable" and that "a dip
lomatic agent shall enjoy im
munity from criminal persecu
tion of the receiving state . . ."
consecutively.
I would like to remind Drag
nich that, first, Iran was not
one of the signatories of the
Vienna Convention. Second,
assuming that the Convention
was somehow holy law and
mystically binding to the Ira
nian students, Dragnich, for
the sake of academic honesty,
should have read in the Con
vention itself some articles that
would have made his argument
against the students' action ir
relevant.
For example, Paragraph 1 of
Article 3 of the same Vienna
Convention lists the functions
of a diplomatic mission and
none of these functions jus
tifies the subversive activities
the Iranian students accuse the
U.S. mission of having en
gaged in.
Paragraph 1 of Article 41
states that "it is the duty of all
persons enjoying such (dip
lomatic) privileges and im
munities to respect the laws
and regulations of the receiv
ing State. They also have a duty
not to interfere in the internal
affairs of that State."
Paragraph 3 of Article 41
states that the premises of the
mission must not be used in
any manner incompatible with
the functions of the mission as
laid down in the present Con
vention." As I mentioned in my
column, the Iranian students
accuse some of the American
embassy's personnel of having
trained the SAVAK agents, of
having cooperated with the
shah's regime against his op
ponents, and of having used
the embassy compound for
espionage.
Needless to say, when the
Iranian students decided to
occupy the U.S. embassy they
did not consult law books to
see whether these books were
or were not in their favor. They
acted in anger and frustration.
And although they have the
sympathy and understanding
of the Revolutionary Govern
ment in Iran, they aid not act
on orders or encouragement
from it.
International conventions
are made with the purpose of
preserving world order. But,
who benefits from the world
order? Unfortunately for hu
manity, there are many groups
in the world who are cruelly
victimized forthe sakeofworld
order, an order that is often
based on injustice.
International agreements
and conventions may be sac
red in the eyes of those who
benefit from them. To those
who are downtrodden and
tyrannized by all or one of the
signatories, or as a result, of

these conventions and agree
ments, the latterare symbols of
crime and injustice and they
must be broken and ridiculed.
Stop, for a while, and think
of how much injustice has
been inflicted as a result of
some of the world's most
celebrated treaties, agree
ments and documents. Do you
think, forexample, that the fact
that South Africa's racist gov
ernment is recognized by all of
the West and many other states
has any effect in convincing
South Africa's blacks that that
government is legitimate?
World recognition of South Af
rica's government means no
thing but injustice to South Af
rica's blacks.
I do not see the seizure of
foreign embassies as a solution
to international injustices but I
have to be sympathetic when a
downtrodden group of people
seizes the embassy of an op
pressive government in order
to make their injustices known
to the world. It is important,
though, to remember that that
is exactly what the Iranian stu
dents are doing. They have not
mistreated their hostages.
By the testimony of Ameri
can witnesses, the hostages are
well-fed, are allowed to exer
cise daily, to read and write,
receive presents and watch
football games.
On the other hand, in the
peace - and - order - loving
America, where international
law is so sacred, at least a
dozen Iranians have been
murdered. Thousands of Ira
nian nationals and Iranian-
Americans have been fired
from their jobs. Tens of
thousands of Iranian students
and citizens have been ter
rorized and intimidated by
both the American public and
the U.S. government.
On a less serious level, I do
not understand why Brett
Kingstone (Daily, Jan. 14) was
"stunned and shocked" by my
column. I don't know what
gave him the impression that I
hate his country. I certainly
don't. But, if his country is
