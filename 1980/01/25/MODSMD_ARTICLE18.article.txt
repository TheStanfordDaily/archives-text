## Try new approach to Islam 
### 
Both the Democratic and Republican presi
dential contenders have criticized President
Jimmy Carter for the lack of a coherent long
term foreign policy which would put an end to
the present non-policy of convulsive reaction to
the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan, the sei
zure of the U.S. Embassy in Iran or anti-
American mob actions in Moslem countries
from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Libya.
But none of them has suggested a genuinely
new strategy.
Meanwhile, such a new strategy is powerfully
knocking at our door, asking to be recognized.
The key to this strategy is the resurgence of
fundamentalist Moslems throughout the world
under the green banner of Islam.
Admittedly, much of this "green" resurgence
has been directed against the United States and
the West in general. But potentially it consti
tutes far a greater threat to the Soviet Union
than to the United States.
For one thing, as long as a Moslem country
remains committed to the faith of Islam, there is
no danger of this country's going communist or
becoming a reliable Soviet satellite: Witness the
failure of Soviet penetration in Egypt, Sudan,
Somalia and Indonesia, and its near-failure in
Syria and Iraq. In spite of the current expression
in vogue, "Islamic Marxist," it is a contradiction
in terms, for Islam and Marxism are entirely in
compatible with each other.
Second, even a quick look at the map would
suffice to show that the Moslem countries con
stitute a most formidable natural anti
communist cordon sanitaire along the southern
tier of the Soviet Union and may serve as a bar
rier to Soviet penetration to Africa and Asia.
Thirdly, the U.S.S.R. itself is vulnerable to the
"green" resurgence, for it contains in its bor
ders some 50 million people of Moslem
background whose national and religious aspi
rations were first betrayed, then brutally
crushed, by the Communist revolution of 1917.
Oppressed and isolated from their Moslem
brethren asthey are, the Moslems of the
U.S.S.R. cannot be forever banned from making
a hegira to Mecca, going to a mosque, reading
the Koran, observing their customs or returning
to their historical homelands. As a part of the
dissident movement in the U.S.S.R., feeble as it
is, the Moslem reawakening is irreversible.
Fourthly, the oil-rich Soviet Union is a natural
exporting competitor of the oil-rich Moslem
countries.
The United States, on the other hand, has no
inherent differences, either religious or
economic, with the Moslem countries. Al
though the Moslem population of the United
States is negligible, there are more mosques
here than in the U.S.S.R., and no one is banned
from going on a hegira, from reading the Koran,
or worshipping Allah.
The United States, like the industrial West
European countries and Japan, is and ought to
be a natural partner of the Moslem countries in
trading technology and know-how for oil and
other raw materials. (Hopefully, Carter will now
ban the sale of oil-drilling technology to the
U.S.S.R.) On top of it all, our born-again Christ
ian president ought to have some affinity for the
born-again Moslems, at least insofar as both
claim the Bible, not Marx, as a source of inspira
tion.
In spite of the above, the atheist rulers in the
Kremlin have been able successfully to manipu
late Christian, Jewish and Moslem believers
against each other to the detriment of all. The
major reason for their success at this foul play is
our present policy toward the Arab-Israeli con
flict which has remained rather inflexible since
W.W. 11. And that is where a major reversal of
our strategy is required if we are to prevent a
triumph of Communism over the time-honored
religions of Moses, Christ and Mohammed.

tfesently, the Arab-Israeli conflict remains
the main thorn which lacerates and poisons our
relations with Arabic and Moslem countries, in
cluding our allies like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Jordan. Unless the thorn is extracted, it will pre
clude an improvement in our strategic position
not only in the Middle East, but throughout the
Third World. Currently, this thorn renders im
potent our efforts to extricate our hostages from
Iran, and more ominously, to check the Soviet
march across Afghanistan and possibly to the
shores of the Arabian Sea.
I certainly do not suggest an abolition of the
state of Israel. Quite to the contrary, I envision
an even greater commitment of the United
States and the West to the security of Israel,
possibly through a defense treaty with the Un
ited States. However, the United States should
take initiative and:
1) Admit that an injustice has been done to
the Palestinian people deprived of their home
land;
2) Agree in principle to the creation of a
sovereign Palestinian state with the provision
that its independence from the Soviet Union is
guaranteed;
3) Make amends for the past injustices to the
Palestinians by massive monetary and technical
assistance to their new-found state;
4) As a gesture of goodwill and reconciliation
with all Moslems, institute a tri-partite Judaic,
Christian and Moslem religious administration
of Jerusalem, which should be declared an in
ternational city;
5) Encourage the creation ofa military alliance
of such Moslem countries as Egypt, Somalia,
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman and Pakistan for the
defense of the Persian Gulf against Soviet inter
vention, and provide this alliance with the
necessary arms. Ultimately, such an alliance
should embrace all Moslem countries which
feel threatened by Communism.
Obviously, the fifth step can hardly be effec
tive, or even attempted, without an expression
of willingness on our part to seriously consider
the first four steps. But the emergency of the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan dictates taking
the fifth step first. A speedy creation of such a
defensive alliance under the green banner of
Islam would provide the best formula for our
participation in countering the Soviet threat to
this area short of our direct confrontation with
Soviet troops.
First of all, this green alliance would serve the
purpose of funneling arms to the guerrillas of
the Afghan national liberation movement by giv
ing control over it to their Moslem allies. Prefer
ably, they should be armed with the Soviet
made light arms from the Egyptian and Somalian
stockpiles, and bolstered by the more sophisti
cated weaponry from the United States.
Secondly, it would allay the fears of some
Moslems, and of the Soviets, that the objective
of the Afghan rebels is the creation of an Ameri
can puppet regime on the borders of the
U.S.S.R.
Thirdly, it would take much steam away from
the current anti-Americanism of the Iranian re
volution and encourage moderates among
Khomeini's .supporters, possibly even the
ayatollah himself, to realize that the greatest
threat to the Islamic Republic comes from the
Soviets.
If promptly initiated and executed with the
utmost diplomatic skill, our new strategy toward
the green Islamic resurgence will not only help
us find new friends in the Third World, but may
change decisively the correlation of forces
throughout the world to our advantage.

religions of Moses, Christ and Mohammed.

tfesently, the Arab-Israeli conflict remains
the main thorn which lacerates and poisons our
relations with Arabic and Moslem countries, in
cluding our allies like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Jordan. Unless the thorn is extracted, it will pre
clude an improvement in our strategic position
not only in the Middle East, but throughout the
Third World. Currently, this thorn renders im
potent our efforts to extricate our hostages from
Iran, and more ominously, to check the Soviet
march across Afghanistan and possibly to the
shores of the Arabian Sea.
I certainly do not suggest an abolition of the
state of Israel. Quite to the contrary, I envision
an even greater commitment of the United
States and the West to the security of Israel,
possibly through a defense treaty with the Un
ited States. However, the United States should
take initiative and:
1) Admit that an injustice has been done to
the Palestinian people deprived of their home
land;
2) Agree in principle to the creation of a
sovereign Palestinian state with the provision
that its independence from the Soviet Union is
guaranteed;
3) Make amends for the past injustices to the
Palestinians by massive monetary and technical
assistance to their new-found state;
4) As a gesture of goodwill and reconciliation
with all Moslems, institute a tri-partite Judaic,
Christian and Moslem religious administration
of Jerusalem, which should be declared an in
ternational city;
5) Encourage the creation ofa military alliance
of such Moslem countries as Egypt, Somalia,
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman and Pakistan for the
defense of the Persian Gulf against Soviet inter
vention, and provide this alliance with the
necessary arms. Ultimately, such an alliance
should embrace all Moslem countries which
feel threatened by Communism.
Obviously, the fifth step can hardly be effec
tive, or even attempted, without an expression
of willingness on our part to seriously consider
the first four steps. But the emergency of the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan dictates taking
the fifth step first. A speedy creation of such a
defensive alliance under the green banner of
Islam would provide the best formula for our
participation in countering the Soviet threat to
this area short of our direct confrontation with
Soviet troops.
First of all, this green alliance would serve the
purpose of funneling arms to the guerrillas of
the Afghan national liberation movement by giv
ing control over it to their Moslem allies. Prefer
ably, they should be armed with the Soviet
made light arms from the Egyptian and Somalian
stockpiles, and bolstered by the more sophisti
cated weaponry from the United States.
Secondly, it would allay the fears of some
Moslems, and of the Soviets, that the objective
of the Afghan rebels is the creation of an Ameri
can puppet regime on the borders of the
U.S.S.R.
Thirdly, it would take much steam away from
the current anti-Americanism of the Iranian re
volution and encourage moderates among
Khomeini's .supporters, possibly even the
ayatollah himself, to realize that the greatest
threat to the Islamic Republic comes from the
Soviets.
If promptly initiated and executed with the
utmost diplomatic skill, our new strategy toward
the green Islamic resurgence will not only help
us find new friends in the Third World, but may
change decisively the correlation of forces
throughout the world to our advantage.

Both the Democratic and Republican presi
dential contenders have criticized President
Jimmy Carter for the lack of a coherent long
term foreign policy which would put an end to
the present non-policy of convulsive reaction to
the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan, the sei
zure of the U.S. Embassy in Iran or anti-
American mob actions in Moslem countries
from Pakistan to Bangladesh to Libya.
But none of them has suggested a genuinely
new strategy.
Meanwhile, such a new strategy is powerfully
knocking at our door, asking to be recognized.
The key to this strategy is the resurgence of
fundamentalist Moslems throughout the world
under the green banner of Islam.
Admittedly, much of this "green" resurgence
has been directed against the United States and
the West in general. But potentially it consti
tutes far a greater threat to the Soviet Union
than to the United States.
For one thing, as long as a Moslem country
remains committed to the faith of Islam, there is
no danger of this country's going communist or
becoming a reliable Soviet satellite: Witness the
failure of Soviet penetration in Egypt, Sudan,
Somalia and Indonesia, and its near-failure in
Syria and Iraq. In spite of the current expression
in vogue, "Islamic Marxist," it is a contradiction
in terms, for Islam and Marxism are entirely in
compatible with each other.
Second, even a quick look at the map would
suffice to show that the Moslem countries con
stitute a most formidable natural anti
communist cordon sanitaire along the southern
tier of the Soviet Union and may serve as a bar
rier to Soviet penetration to Africa and Asia.
Thirdly, the U.S.S.R. itself is vulnerable to the
"green" resurgence, for it contains in its bor
ders some 50 million people of Moslem
background whose national and religious aspi
rations were first betrayed, then brutally
crushed, by the Communist revolution of 1917.
Oppressed and isolated from their Moslem
brethren asthey are, the Moslems of the
U.S.S.R. cannot be forever banned from making
a hegira to Mecca, going to a mosque, reading
the Koran, observing their customs or returning
to their historical homelands. As a part of the
dissident movement in the U.S.S.R., feeble as it
is, the Moslem reawakening is irreversible.
Fourthly, the oil-rich Soviet Union is a natural
exporting competitor of the oil-rich Moslem
countries.
The United States, on the other hand, has no
inherent differences, either religious or
economic, with the Moslem countries. Al
though the Moslem population of the United
States is negligible, there are more mosques
here than in the U.S.S.R., and no one is banned
from going on a hegira, from reading the Koran,
or worshipping Allah.
The United States, like the industrial West
European countries and Japan, is and ought to
be a natural partner of the Moslem countries in
trading technology and know-how for oil and
other raw materials. (Hopefully, Carter will now
ban the sale of oil-drilling technology to the
U.S.S.R.) On top of it all, our born-again Christ
ian president ought to have some affinity for the
born-again Moslems, at least insofar as both
claim the Bible, not Marx, as a source of inspira
tion.
In spite of the above, the atheist rulers in the
Kremlin have been able successfully to manipu
late Christian, Jewish and Moslem believers
against each other to the detriment of all. The
major reason for their success at this foul play is
our present policy toward the Arab-Israeli con
flict which has remained rather inflexible since
W.W. 11. And that is where a major reversal of
our strategy is required if we are to prevent a
triumph of Communism over the time-honored
religions of Moses, Christ and Mohammed.
