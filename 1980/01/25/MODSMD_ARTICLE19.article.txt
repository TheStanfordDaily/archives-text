## When in Italy, beware the 'papagalli'

Overseas Studies. The office
prepares the student venturing
across the Atlantic for his
foreign experience in many
areas: types of clothing, travel
tips, culture shocks and favo
rite train stations equipped
with showers are all mentioned
in the manual you read nerv
ously before your departure.
After cramming the advice,
information and crurial ad
dresses into the ol' backpack,
one feels prepared to part from
the Farm to the wilds of
Europe. But forthe prospective
female going to Florence, one
vital exclusion must be
cautioned against: the Italian
Papagalli.
This rare breed of male has
perfected methods of mass
swarm around innocent
American women. No street is
vacant of them; no bus ride
complete without that familiar
leer accompanied by "How are
you?"
Small cafes are lined with
their hungry eyes and street
corners are their prime hang
outs. Here they sit, perched at
shoulder level, within reach so
to speak, of desirable body
parts and purses. Others
choose to lounge on monu
ment steps so the curious cul
ture seekercan be viewed from
all angles as she examines the
art form trying frantically to ig

nore the obscene orchestra
tion of whistles, snickers and
very vocal chuckling.
Papagallo is Italian for parrot
and the description could not
be more fitting. Though even
tually their lines, strutsand hair
tonic becomes one irritating
pattern, the papagalli can not
be classified by age, profession
or looks.
The attire is usually a pair of
skintight polyester pants,
loose sweater with a week-old
undershirt peeking out from
the V-neck, two gold chains
and some virile hair curled up
towards the neck indicating
their mammal masculinity. The
bulk of the papagalli are bet
ween 18 and 25 — perfect for
the bulk of American women
minding their own business.
Your first mistake, however,
is to let a little gray hair fool
you; don't let a senile, older
face deceive you. "Once a
papagallo, always a papagallo"
was my motto after I was ac
costed by a guide at Pompeii
who couldn't see me from the
mosaic in front of his nose yet
managed a few blocked tackles
as he ushered me through the
ruins.
Favorite targets are women
looking confused, especially
with a map and Italian dictio
nary in hand. By some remark
able coincidence, the
papagallo invariably seems to
be going exactly where you
are. Unfortunately, they only
know the streets leading
through dark and deserted al
leys.
Those famous Italian
gelaterias are another potential
papagalli pickup. Slurping ice
cream never worked as an ap
hrodisiac for me, but sure
enough, you take one messy
lick and your dream escort ap
pears at your arm with the orig
inal question: "Americana?"
"Si, buddy, get lost."

ril admit it. Sometimes, it is
rather flattering. To be fol
lowed in the pouring rain for
seven blocks by two suave Sly
Stallone look-alikes does won
ders for the ego — until you
spot the comic books in their
back pockets. And, when it fi
nally gets old, there are a few
tactics to be employed by the
crafty studentessa.
1) When approached, feign
muteness. If you can't speak
they aren't interested.
2) If you can't pull that off,
don't shower for a week. That
usually keeps them at shouting
distance. Unfortunately you'll

lose some friends in the pro
cess.
3) Or, be industrious and
learn Italian — half their fun
results from making comments
about you that you don't un
derstand. Of course you run
the risk of meeting an ambiti
ous fellow who would like no
thing more than your under
standing,:?// of his suggestions
Or, justgiveinand pickouta
couple decent ones. Whoeve'
said Sly baby was anything to
complain about. Look whr
happened to Adrian.
