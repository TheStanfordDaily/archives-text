# ASSU committees review housing
## 
### Fran Miller 
Assistant Dean of Students and Director of the Hous
ing Center Roger Whitney and Associate Dean of Resi
dential Education Norman Robinson discussed their
current evaluations of the housing system before ASSU
Senate committees Wednesday night.
Whitney, who has been at Stanford since August, said
that the Housing Center is trying to take a "systematic
view of policies and procedures" of the increasingly
complex and popular on-campus housing organization.
He cited diversity, flexibility and equity as essential ele
ments in a housing system which is responsive to stu
dents.
Whitney said that among the issues under scrutiny are
returning residence priorities and fraternities in relation
to the housing draw. He said that although continuity in
housing, part of the concept of residential education, is
achieved through the use of returning residence prior
ity, that policy does not give many students the chance
to move within the system.
He added that calendar changes and the abolishment
of the residence priority during students' unguaranteed
years are possibilities under consideration for this
spnng.
Only minor changes in the system would be made this
spring, however, he said, because any major alterations
would involve restructuring the existing computer prog
ram and then checking and rechecking for accuracy and
efficiency.
Confusion?
The Center is further questioning the objectivity of
special priority categories, wait list procedures and the
number of choices on the draw card itself, he said. One
important query, he said, is "Does the possibility for
eight choices increase complexity and create confu
sion?"
With regard to fraternities, Whitney said adminis

trators are researching the reasons behind membership
to determine it men join fraternities simply to gain hous
ing.
Robinson was asked to comment on the University's
recent decision to deny official recognition to sororities
and replied that the relationships between local frater
nities and sororities and their respective national chap
ters appear to be very different. He said that national
sororities have exerted much more control over local
chapters than have their fraternity counterparts, and
that practice is inconsistent with University policy.
Fraternity review
The constitutions of all fraternities are now being re
viewed, Robinson said, as were the constitutions of the
sororities. Problem areas of the constitutions are being
highlighted, he added. Although "it is not under con
sideration, it is not out of the realm of possibility" for
fraternities to be kicked off-campus should major unre
solvable constitutional difficulties be found.
Robinson said he did not know why guidelines allow
ing for the existence of fraternities here (which began in
the 1890s) wore not written before the recent resurging
interest in sororities on campus.
In other areas, senators voiced concerns over the lack
of off-campus housing for students and suggested pos
sibilities to provide for a mixture of graduate and under
graduate housing, as well as for a seniority system.
Contention
Robinson claimed that a seniority system was not very
feasible here because of the "tremendous amount of
movement making it difficult to define student status."
When asked why upperclassmen are required to take
food service in dorms, Robinson replied that "we would
more closely approach UCLA's system if we just wanted
to supply students with a place to sleep and a place
where they could eat as cheaply as possible.
It is important to residential education to have a
sense of community," he said.
