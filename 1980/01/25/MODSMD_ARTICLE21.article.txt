# Visiting Chinese prof offers comparisons
## 
### Suzi Alexander 
Imagineyourself in acountry
focused almost exclusively on
agriculture, where people tell
you in their fast, sing-song
tongue that their first concern
is not for themselves but for
the common good. Perhaps
then you can empathize with
the culture shock being ex
perienced by visiting Chinese
professor Bison Lu.
Lu, head of the First Foreign
Students Department of the
Peking Language Institute (PLI)
is struck every day by new con
cepts and ideas. He has the
ability to make comparisons
between the United States and
China on anything from their
differing forms of government
to the cost of a good meal.
Lu's unfamiliarity with the
highly technological U.S. soci
ety was illustrated by his un
familiarity with the workings of
a tape recorder. When the re
wind button was pushed, he
worried that he was being re
corded and said, "Please turn
it off." After an explanation
and assurance that the tape
was for reporters' ears only, he
acquiesced to its use.
Still, the idea of an interview
was not communicated so eas
ily. Lu first asked hesitatingly,
"Say anything what I like?" But
as discussion shifted to what
he affectionately termed "my
institute," the cultural barrier
was dissolved, leaving only a
language problem.
Lu explained that he is not
sure he understands "the
American accent." It is much
faster than he is used to, and in
the word fast, he found an
example of our different vowel
pronunciations. He says the a
in fast as we would say the o in
Tom.

Staying in Palo Alto, Lu said
he has found living conditions
"quite different from China.''
Transportation stood out in his
mind as very distinct in the two
countries. "In China, when
you walk in the streets, you
may find that most of the
people are going by bicycle,
and too much people."
Further, Lu finds the stan
dard of living here higher than
in China. For example, while
he surmises that in the United
States "when you have a meal
at a restaurant, I think at least
you must spend $5; but in
China, I think usually $1 is
enough."
Housing costs also surprised
Lu, who is used to paying four
yuan ($2.50) a month for his
two-bedroom house. He was
quick to add, however, that vis

itors may expect to pay "much
more." He explained that stu
dents at the PL I have to pay as
much as $20 or even $25 a
month for their rooms.
Lu describes American
people as "polite, enthusiastic
and very friendly," a pleasant
change from the traditional
view of the "ugly American" as
pushy, aggressive and insensi
tive. Also, he reports a very
favorable impression of the
American students he has seen
here studying Chinese. "They
work very hard."
Asked about direct results of
the different type of govern
ment on his lifestyle, Lu
explained that he "can't tell
now; the time is too short since
I've been here."
Lu was invited to come here

by the Asian Languages de-l
partment, the Linguistics de
partment, and the U.S.-China)
relations program. While here,'
he is teaching first-year
Chinese, and doing research
for his institute where between
four and five hundred students!
a year come from "almost 70
countries" to study Chinese
language. The government ex
change students study from
one to four years, depending
on the extent of their goals.
Lu explains that other prog
rams, such as natural science,
do exist, pointing out that in
the main "those who study
natural sciences come from
Asia and Africa; those who
come from western countries]
mainly study arts, Chinese lan
guage, Chinese literature,
Chinese history and Chinese
economy."
Lu describes the PLI campus
as similar to Stanford's with "a
post-office, barber shop" and
virtually all the comforts of
home. All students live on the
campus, including those
Chinese students who are
studying other languages
taught at the school: English,|
French, German, Spanish,
Arabic and Japanese. Clearly,
the institute shares Stanford's
interest in stressing residential
education as an invaluable
learning experience; with such
a breadth of backgrounds at
PLI, dormitories and the dining
halls must be educational in
deed.

perienced by visiting Chinese
professor Bison Lu.
Lu, head of the First Foreign
Students Department of the
Peking Language Institute (PLI)
is struck every day by new con
cepts and ideas. He has the
ability to make comparisons
between the United States and
China on anything from their
differing forms of government
to the cost of a good meal.
Lu's unfamiliarity with the
highly technological U.S. soci
ety was illustrated by his un
familiarity with the workings of
a tape recorder. When the re
wind button was pushed, he
worried that he was being re
corded and said, "Please turn
it off." After an explanation
and assurance that the tape
was for reporters' ears only, he
acquiesced to its use.
Still, the idea of an interview
was not communicated so eas
ily. Lu first asked hesitatingly,
"Say anything what I like?" But
as discussion shifted to what
he affectionately termed "my
institute," the cultural barrier
was dissolved, leaving only a
language problem.
Lu explained that he is not
sure he understands "the
American accent." It is much
faster than he is used to, and in
the word fast, he found an
example of our different vowel
pronunciations. He says the a
in fast as we would say the o in
Tom.

Staying in Palo Alto, Lu said
he has found living conditions
"quite different from China.''
Transportation stood out in his
mind as very distinct in the two
countries. "In China, when
you walk in the streets, you
may find that most of the
people are going by bicycle,
and too much people."
Further, Lu finds the stan
dard of living here higher than
in China. For example, while
he surmises that in the United
States "when you have a meal
at a restaurant, I think at least
you must spend $5; but in
China, I think usually $1 is
enough."
Housing costs also surprised
Lu, who is used to paying four
yuan ($2.50) a month for his
two-bedroom house. He was
quick to add, however, that vis

itors may expect to pay "much
more." He explained that stu
dents at the PL I have to pay as
much as $20 or even $25 a
month for their rooms.
Lu describes American
people as "polite, enthusiastic
and very friendly," a pleasant
change from the traditional
view of the "ugly American" as
pushy, aggressive and insensi
tive. Also, he reports a very
favorable impression of the
American students he has seen
here studying Chinese. "They
work very hard."
Asked about direct results of
the different type of govern
ment on his lifestyle, Lu
explained that he "can't tell
now; the time is too short since
I've been here."
Lu was invited to come here

by the Asian Languages de-l
partment, the Linguistics de
partment, and the U.S.-China)
relations program. While here,'
he is teaching first-year
Chinese, and doing research
for his institute where between
four and five hundred students!
a year come from "almost 70
countries" to study Chinese
language. The government ex
change students study from
one to four years, depending
on the extent of their goals.
Lu explains that other prog
rams, such as natural science,
do exist, pointing out that in
the main "those who study
natural sciences come from
Asia and Africa; those who
come from western countries]
mainly study arts, Chinese lan
guage, Chinese literature,
Chinese history and Chinese
economy."
Lu describes the PLI campus
as similar to Stanford's with "a
post-office, barber shop" and
virtually all the comforts of
home. All students live on the
campus, including those
Chinese students who are
studying other languages
taught at the school: English,|
French, German, Spanish,
Arabic and Japanese. Clearly,
the institute shares Stanford's
interest in stressing residential
education as an invaluable
learning experience; with such
a breadth of backgrounds at
PLI, dormitories and the dining
halls must be educational in
deed.

Imagineyourself in acountry
focused almost exclusively on
agriculture, where people tell
you in their fast, sing-song
tongue that their first concern
is not for themselves but for
the common good. Perhaps
then you can empathize with
the culture shock being ex
perienced by visiting Chinese
