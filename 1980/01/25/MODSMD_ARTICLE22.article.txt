### Dianne Cahoon 
Today I'm going to try to answer a few ques
tions which, I understand, pertain to problems
plaguing many of you lately. Don't ask me how I
discover these obscure trends. Suffice it to say
that my little friends keep me informed.
Frankly, I have been quite concerned by the
recent mice epidemic skittering across campus. I
shuddered in unbounded horror and disgust
when I read of one of those filthy rodents scam
pering over the bared arm of an innocent fellow
collegian. I live in constant fear of a similarly ugly
incident happening to me. What caused this
hideous outbreak of crawling creatures, and
what types of dangers do they pose to the
human population?

Dear Stagnant Soul,
Vou can descend from your table-top perch
because I have it on good authority that my small
acquaintances do not present any serious health
threat to the hominid race.
According to Dr. Armand Celpi of Cowell
Student Health Center, the only disease known
to be carried by mice in the United States is a
rare infirmity known as rickettsial pox. The
reason that you are probably unfamiliar with
that medical term is that its sole occurrence
struck JO years ago in New York. Thus, while the
pitter-pat of little feet on your floor or under
your bed at night may be bothersome and un
nerving, the hungry mites will not inflict terrify
ing malaise upon your body.
Actually, you may be inadvertently confusing
mice with their more menacing relatives, rats.
Rats were the infamously invidious spreaders of
the Black Death or bubonic plague in 17th- and
18th-century Europe. These more gargantuan
rodents are known as sources of typhus and
rabies. Certain types today are even recognized
as common harborers for pernicious carcino
gens.
On your preliminary query, you and your
grimy compatriots were most likely the cause of
your own suffering. Dr. Celpi said that mice are
attracted by uncovered food and generally un
sanitary habits. So, my advice to you is to clean
up your act. In all fairness, how can you blame
the innocuous little scavengers for searching for
their just desserts? I hope that you feel duly

guilty when you see their tiny, wretched corpses
wracked by unsavory Food Service scraps and
locked in cold, cruel traps.
The latest spell of inclement weather has had
me under wraps with the Cold of the Decade for
the past week. Has modern science discovered a
sure-fire cure for my ailment?
-All Choked Up
Dear Chronic Complaint,
As of this writing, the person who develops a
.fail-proof remedy for the basic cold will be a
highly revered and immensely wealthy indi
vidual. Authorities on the subject at Cowell in
formed me that nothing new has emerged on
this front for some time. Colds are viruses,
which usually last for seven to 10 days, and can
not be treated by antibiotics. The influenza vac
cine will not prevent colds, they said.
Now that you have already contracted a nag
ging cold, here's a list of combatants you could
employ.
Use of an over-the-counter decongestant is
recommended to clear head congestion, and
gargling a pinch of salt in one-half glass of warm
water should ameliorate the condition of your
sore throat. For your wracking cough, take
cough syrup with expectorant to promote the
discharge of mucus from your respiratory tract.
Laryngitis and chest congestion demand
steam inhalation techniques, which can be
produced even in the lacking environment
of a dorm, by throwing a towel over your head as
you breathe into a functioning hot pot. Loss of
voice or rasping signifies a need for rest. In
other words, no talking, whispering or yelling
contests.
To borrow from the well-known adage or pre
scription, ingest aspirin to reduce body temper
atures and aches, and always drink a lot of fluids
when battling a persistent cold.
Vou should seek professional help at Cowell if
you experience pain in your ears, notice spots
on your tonsils (just say aah in front of the mir
ror) or if your temperature dwells above 101
degrees Fahrenheit for a prolonged period of
time in which aspirin does not help.
Now that I'm off the hook for another week, I
suggest that you take your problems to my furry
friends. They really can be quite responsive and
congenial.
