# The 						disillusioning Dowhower era
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Nine years ago, the sudden
resignation of Stanford head
coach John Ralston to accept
the head coaching job with the
Denver Broncos was over
shadowed by the dismissal of
professor-revolutionary Bruce
Franklin because of his inciting
violence in campus protesting
of the Vietnam War.
Two days ago, the sudden
resignation of Stanford head
coach Rod Dowhower to ac
cept a coaching job with the
Denver Broncos was over
shadowed by President Jimmy
Carter's call for resuming
Selective Service registration
and the subsequent campus
reaction.
The more things change, the
more they stay the same. For
the third time in four years,
Stanford is looking for a head
football coach.
As heads quit buzzing over
the news of Dowhower's de
parture, the question everyone
asks is "Why?" Why leave a
head coaching position at the
top collegiate passing school in
the country, as well as the one
of the most prestigious schools
in the nation?
The only man who can ans
wer these questions has been
in hiding since his announce
ment. But he has left some
clues as to why he left in his
wake.
Many Stanford football ob
servers felt that Dowhower

seemed lost in the bright lights
of collegiate head coaching.
Not that he was not qualified to
coach; when hired, there was
no question but that he was
able to coach.
But the final step up the lad
der from assistant coach to
hpad coach involves more than
x's and o's. There is constant
attention from all sides. Vou
are the representative of Stan
ford football to the world.
There is incessant questioning
from the media. There is
gladhanding with the alumni.
And there are 60 football
players to worry about, not j ust
the half-dozen or so that are
the responsibility of an assis
tant coach.
Rod Dowhower surely did
not realize all of this when he
replaced Bill Walsh. There is no
way he should have. But when
the time came to adjust to that
new-found fame, Dowhower
did not adjust well.
He always seemed ill at ease
when the inevitable mic
rophones were shoved in his
face. Ihough always courte
ous, he was never personable.
One may venture his responsi
bility was to coach the players
and that there was a Sports In
formation Department for ev
erything else, but that is not
the case.
I he players themselves were
stunned, but not emotional
about Dowhower's leaving.

His relationship with the team,
though never as bad as was
made out to sound, was more
business-like than personal. He
was close with some, particu
larly the quarterbacks and re
ceivers he had coached for
three years. Wide receiver Ken
Margerum and quarterback
John Elway visited Dowhower
at his home Wednesday night
to personally say goodbye. But
he was not close to the team
like Walsh was.
Dowhower was not anything
like Walsh was, and perhaps
that was his biggest dilemma.
Everyone knew what an offen
sive genius Stanford was los
ing, but no one realized what
was in the rest of the package.
Walsh was articulate and open;
Dowhower was succinct and
close-mouthed. Walsh took
the majority of a very experi
enced staff with him to the San
Francisco 49ers and left
Dowhower to assemble his
own staff.
Maybe Dowhower was just

a victim of bad timing. Maybe
he just realized he was not cut
out to be a head coach. Maybe
he wanted a higher echelon ot
football; but for whatever
reason, there is no doubt that
he is gone.
Left in his wake is another
victim of bad timing: the Stan
ford recruiting effort. Taking
up the slack left by
Dowhower's departure is As
sociate Athletic Director Doug
Single, who will try to minimize
the damage done and be able
to present a fine crop of
rookies to the next head coach.
As to who that will be, no
one is close to knowing, Athle
tic Director Andy Geiger in
cluded. A search committee of
alumni, Athletic Department
officials and players will be
formed in the next day or two
to begin looking and there is a
wealth of candidates. Some are
perennial, some have come up
for the first time.
There is I'aul Hackett, quar
terba< k coach at USC and

former quarterback coach at
California; Marv Coux, defen
sive line coach at USC and an
applicant for the job when
Walsh was hired; DaveCurrey,
head coach at Long Beach State
and a five year assistant here
under Jack Christiansen . . .
those are the names that have
come up before.
Names that have not been
mentioned at Stanford before
are Lavell Edwards, head coach
at Brigham Young, which along
with Stanford is a school
synonomous with collegiate
passing; Dick Coury of the
Philadelphia Eagles and Ron
Meyer, the flamboyant head
coach of SMU. Even George Al
len's name has popped up a
couple of times, but it is always
followed with a snicker.
We shall know in about three
weeks, according to Ceiger.
Whoever it is shall have an
easier time of adjusting than
did his predecessor. Rod
Dowhower has left, at best, a
legacy of disillusionment.
