# He told me cocaine was good for arthritis.'
## Fear and loathing before the Super Bowl 
### Sally Jenkins 
Fhere are those who say that
the game is the low point of
Super Bowl weekend. It most
certainly was this year, if you
happened to he hanging out in
the right places at the right
time. I he right places tended
to be Beverly Hills bars and re
staurants. The right time was
usually about 2 a.m.
Thursday night: if you hap
pened to wander into
Dominic's restaurant, you
would have seen Dean Martin
slumped in the back booth,
working on a steak and a drink.
Between bites he could be
heard singing "scooby dooby
da da do." For dessert he
worked on a very pretty blfcnde
girl's neck.
later in the evening a CBS
executive was seen taking off
his pants in Carroll O'Connor's
bar, The Ginger Man. It was ru
mored that the man worked in
the public relations depart
ment.
Friday afternoon: the Be
verly Hills Hotel pool is a great
hangout for lunch, both for the
food and the scenery. In gen
eral it looks more like Studio
54: spandex pants, designer
sweat suits and bikinis small
enough to tit in your pocket.

Overheard remarks are what
the pool is most famous for.
One man said as he was pick
ing up a telephone, "Hey,
Label Babe!"
One woman said to a tennis
pro, "I met this doctor, and he
told me cocaine was very good
for arthritis."
Friday night: Martin Balsam
could be seen in his hotel bar
slumped in the back booth,
saying something like
"Gaaaaaahh mmmm subber
blaaaah n udder drink
ZZZ7777ZZZZ."
Saturday night: Chasen's
Restaurant established itself as
headquarters early in the even
ing. A drunk, long- and grey
haired Lee Majors never took
his arm from around O.J.
Simpson's shoulders. O.j.
Simpson never took his arm
from around a blonde model's
waist.
Georgia Rosenbloom was
seen off and on throughout the
evening, mostly in a glazed
eyed stupor.
The MVP of the night, and
probably the weekend, was los
Angeles Rams' General Man
ager Don Klosterman. Klos
terman maintained an unflag
ging conviction that his team
was going to win. "This is a

four-stage team," he said.
"And we have reached the
fourth stage." What about
Bradshaw? "Ferry will throw
tunny on you sometimes," he
replied. As anyone who
watched the game knows,
Bradshaw threw funny exactly
three times.
Klosterman is already the
owner of one Super Bowl ring,
from the 1970 Baltimore Colts.
I le spent most of his time talk
ing into the ring as if it were a
microphone. As he stood with
O.J. Simpson, Klosterman
said, "Hel-10. What's that?
Rams are gonna win? Got it.
Come again? Buffalo never
made it to the playoffs? That's
right. Huh? Individual records
don't mean shit? Hear that
0.J.?"
Klosterman stumbled home
at about 3 a.m. He was not
stumbling because he was
drunk, but because he once
broke bis back in a skiing acci
dent. He claims that when he
woke up on the slope he was
calling audibles. When the
doctor told him he would
never walk again, Klosterman
threw a vase at his head.
As he climbed the step to his
apartment building, he tripped
a little. When he reached the

top step he broke into a tap
dance. As he sank into a dining
room chair he said, "How
many more hours is it now?"
Someone asked him if they
were keeping him up. "God,
no," he laughed. Pretty soon
he started reminiscing. Some
one asked him about his acci
dent. It seems that a woman
cut in front of him as he was
coming down a slope. He
swerved to avoid her, and
crashed.
"Where is the woman now?"
someone asked. "Tehran,
probably," he laughed again.
The last time anyone heard
from Klosterman, he was going

to bed at 5:30 Monday night.
One conversation in particu
lar sums up the essence of the
week, and of Beverly Hills in
general. Nancy Dowd, author
of the screenplays Slapshot
and Coming Home, stepped
out of a limousine in front of
the Beverly Hills Hotel and saw
Lauren Bacall waiting for a car.
Two mutual friends started to
introduce them. The conversa
tion went something like this:
Dowd: We've already met.
How are you?
Bacall: We've met?
Dowd: Sure. You gave me
my Oscar last year.

I le spent most of his time talk
ing into the ring as if it were a
microphone. As he stood with
O.J. Simpson, Klosterman
said, "Hel-10. What's that?
Rams are gonna win? Got it.
Come again? Buffalo never
made it to the playoffs? That's
right. Huh? Individual records
don't mean shit? Hear that
0.J.?"
Klosterman stumbled home
at about 3 a.m. He was not
stumbling because he was
drunk, but because he once
broke bis back in a skiing acci
dent. He claims that when he
woke up on the slope he was
calling audibles. When the
doctor told him he would
never walk again, Klosterman
threw a vase at his head.
As he climbed the step to his
apartment building, he tripped
a little. When he reached the

top step he broke into a tap
dance. As he sank into a dining
room chair he said, "How
many more hours is it now?"
Someone asked him if they
were keeping him up. "God,
no," he laughed. Pretty soon
he started reminiscing. Some
one asked him about his acci
dent. It seems that a woman
cut in front of him as he was
coming down a slope. He
swerved to avoid her, and
crashed.
"Where is the woman now?"
someone asked. "Tehran,
probably," he laughed again.
The last time anyone heard
from Klosterman, he was going

to bed at 5:30 Monday night.
One conversation in particu
lar sums up the essence of the
week, and of Beverly Hills in
general. Nancy Dowd, author
of the screenplays Slapshot
and Coming Home, stepped
out of a limousine in front of
the Beverly Hills Hotel and saw
Lauren Bacall waiting for a car.
Two mutual friends started to
introduce them. The conversa
tion went something like this:
Dowd: We've already met.
How are you?
Bacall: We've met?
Dowd: Sure. You gave me
my Oscar last year.
Fhere are those who say that
the game is the low point of
Super Bowl weekend. It most
certainly was this year, if you
happened to he hanging out in
the right places at the right
time. I he right places tended
to be Beverly Hills bars and re
staurants. The right time was
usually about 2 a.m.
Thursday night: if you hap
pened to wander into
Dominic's restaurant, you
would have seen Dean Martin
slumped in the back booth,
working on a steak and a drink.
Between bites he could be
heard singing "scooby dooby
da da do." For dessert he
worked on a very pretty blfcnde
girl's neck.
later in the evening a CBS
executive was seen taking off
his pants in Carroll O'Connor's
bar, The Ginger Man. It was ru
mored that the man worked in
the public relations depart
ment.
Friday afternoon: the Be
verly Hills Hotel pool is a great
hangout for lunch, both for the
food and the scenery. In gen
eral it looks more like Studio
54: spandex pants, designer
sweat suits and bikinis small
enough to tit in your pocket.

Overheard remarks are what
the pool is most famous for.
One man said as he was pick
ing up a telephone, "Hey,
Label Babe!"
One woman said to a tennis
pro, "I met this doctor, and he
told me cocaine was very good
for arthritis."
Friday night: Martin Balsam
could be seen in his hotel bar
slumped in the back booth,
saying something like
"Gaaaaaahh mmmm subber
blaaaah n udder drink
ZZZ7777ZZZZ."
Saturday night: Chasen's
Restaurant established itself as
headquarters early in the even
ing. A drunk, long- and grey
haired Lee Majors never took
his arm from around O.J.
Simpson's shoulders. O.j.
Simpson never took his arm
from around a blonde model's
waist.
Georgia Rosenbloom was
seen off and on throughout the
evening, mostly in a glazed
eyed stupor.
The MVP of the night, and
probably the weekend, was los
Angeles Rams' General Man
ager Don Klosterman. Klos
terman maintained an unflag
ging conviction that his team
was going to win. "This is a

four-stage team," he said.
"And we have reached the
fourth stage." What about
Bradshaw? "Ferry will throw
tunny on you sometimes," he
replied. As anyone who
watched the game knows,
Bradshaw threw funny exactly
three times.
Klosterman is already the
owner of one Super Bowl ring,
from the 1970 Baltimore Colts.
