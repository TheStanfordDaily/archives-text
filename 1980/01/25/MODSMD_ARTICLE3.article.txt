# Faculty Senate passes Western Culture and distribution proposals
## 
### Andrea James 
In two separate actions, the Faculty
Senate voted to re-implement a
year-long Western Culture require
ment for next year's freshmen and to
revamp University distribution re
quirements.
There was little debate on the
Western Culture proposal, and this
measure passed unanimously.
But the senate discussed the prop
osed change of the distribution re
quirements for more than an hour
before voting in favor of the move.
About half a dozen faculty mem
bers voted no on the issue. Voting
was done by hand count; no roll call
vote was taken.
Next year's freshmen will now be
required to take one course in each
of the following seven areas:
— Literature and the fine arts;
— Philosophical, social and religi
ous thought;
— Human development, behavior
and language;
— Social processes and institu
tions;
— Mathematical sciences;
— Natural sciences;
— Technology and applied sci
ences.
In the past, students have had to
take three courses from each of the
general areas of social science,
humanities and math/natural
science/technology.
New system
Under the system passed yester
day, the total number of required
courses would be 10 — three West
ern Culture and the various seven —
an increase of one from the current
three-courses-in-three-categories
arrangement. One of the courses
would have to focus on a non-
Western culture.
University President Richard
Lyman supported the new distribu
tion requirement proposals at the
meeting, calling the old program a
"leaky sieve."

The tripartide system was so broad
that "students had to try hard not to
fulfill the requirements," he said.
More of a blend
The faculty members who voted
no did not express disapproval of the
overall revision, but wanted to see
more of a blend in the math, science
and technology requirement.
One dissenter, math Prof. Paul
Berg had introduced an amendment
to the motion. It allowed for a con
nected sequence of two courses in
one, and one course in another, of
the three areas of math, science and
technology.
The amendment also did not de
lineate the other four subject areas,
but simply stated that the student
must take "one course in each of
four other subject areas."
Berg and amendment co-author
Physics Prof. J. Dirk Walecka, said
the amendment would have allowed
students to take continuing two
quarter physics and math courses
and fulfill two distribution require
ments in the process.
Opposed
But the majority of faculty mem
bers opposed this philosophy.
"The proposal for the new (un
amended) distribution requirements
is a plea for assuring some breadth in a
student's undergraduate cur
riculum," said Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Fred Harga
don.
"It seems to me that we're heading
on a 180-degree path away from this
if we accept the Berg amendment."
A starting point
University provost Donald Ken
nedy stressed that these new dis
tribution requirements are only a
starting point and that as they go into
practice, revisions can be made.
The Faculty Senate's move yester
day is similar to Harvard's recent de
cision to strengthen its general edu
cation core.
