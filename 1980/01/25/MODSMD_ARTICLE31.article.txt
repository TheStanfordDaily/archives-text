# Stanford seeks escape from Pac-10 cellar
## Lowly Ducks, No. 2 OSU meet Cards 
### Chris Haft 
The only thing that the Ore
gon and Oregon State men's
basketball teams have in com
mon is that they come from the
same state.
Otherwise, the Ducks, who
face Stanford at Maples Pavil
ion tomorrow night, and the
Beavers, who play the Cardi
nals Monday evening, are as
dissimilar as Billy Graham and
Billy Sims.
The Oregon squad has re
sembled the crew of the
H.M.S. Bounty more than a
basketball team. Second-year
coach Jim Haney, following the
great fictional tradition of Cap
tain Bligh, suspended forward
Phil Barner and guard Stu Lyon
before the season even began
and expelled guard Paul Bain
and starting 6-foot-10 center
Dan Hartshorne in December.
Oregon State, meanwhile,
has become the Pacific-10 Con
ference's dominant force.
With a 17-1 overall record and a
7-0 first-place conference
mark, the Beavers are ranked
No. 2 nationally behind only
DePaul.
Though Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso recognizes the differ
ences in talent between the
two schools, he states that he
won't make any major
strategic changes, except to
stress a more assertive on
court attitude.
"We're too far into the sea

son to make adjustments," Di-
Biaso said, adding later, "We'll
go into the games with the
hope of being mentally aggres
sive right from the beginning."
Dißiaso also believes that the
lack of this frame of mind ham
pered the Cards, now 3-12
overall and 1-6 in conference,
in their 77-69 loss to California
last Saturday.
"I would like to think that it
(the loss), again, emphasized
the fact that we have to be in
tense and defensively aware
and aggressive for an entire
game," Dißiaso said.
Another aspect of their game
that the Cards must improve
upon is their scoring contribu
tion from the bench. In the
past two games Stanford's sub
stitutes have scored only six
points, a meager total.
Saturday's loss to Cal pro
vided a good example of this
drought. Guards Doug Marty
and Doug Barnes had career
scoring bests and forwards
Kimberly Belton and Brian
Welch combined for 37 points,
but Stanford's bench managed
only two more points.
Dißiaso is fully aware that
some improvement is neces
sary.
"We're just trying to build
confidence in practice —
which is hard to do," Dißiaso
said, explaining how he is at
tempting to revitalize his
bench. "We try to encourage

the players. When they do
something well, we say, Hey,
nice going,' or something . . .
if they make a mistake doing
something they usually do
well, we don't worry about it."
If any Pac-10 team has been
less impressive than Stanford,
which has lost 11 of its last 12
games, it is Oregon.
No longer the collection of
fiery, froth-at-the-mouth
ballplayers it was under fiery,
froth-at-the-mouth coach Dick
Harter, Oregon does not have
a single player among the con
ference leaders in any offen
sive or defensive category.
Before last night's game at
Cal, the Ducks were tied with
Stanford and the Golden Bears
for last place in the Pac-10 at
1-6.
Still, Oregon has a smatter
ing of respectability. Starting
6-9 forward Mike Clark, averag
ing 10.8 points and 6.7 re
bounds a game, is a strong
player who battled Belton well
in Eugene last year.
Guards Felton Sealey and
)ohn Murray will hustle until
the lights in the gymnasium are
turned off, and 7-0 freshman
center Ron Burns and 6-7
freshman forward Ray Whiting
have shown promise.
Oregon State, however, has
got a lot more than just prom
ise on its side. The Beavers are
first in Pac-10 scoring, tallying
an average of 83.6 points a

game, and third in defense,
giving up 69.0 points per out
ing.
Naturally, these statistics
stem from blazing shooting
(OSU is tops in the conference
with a 55.5 team field goal per
centage) and tight defense
(gifted with quick players at
every position, the Beavers run
a skin-tight full-court press).
In the face of all this excel
lence, OSU coach Ralph Miller
has remained humble.
"It just makes life tougher,"
Miller said of his club's high
national ranking. "It's nice to
be accorded this honor — I
don't know that it's accurate.
You can't order the top 10 or 15
teams in the country."
The Beavers' most notice
able player is 6-10 junior center
Steve Johnson, the Pac-10's
leading scorer with a 75.3 per
centage.
Though he has been averag
ing 17.9 points (fourth in the
conference), Johnson has not
had a consistent season, ac
cording to Miller.
"Steve has been a yo-yo so
far," Miller said. "He's had
some outstanding games,
some bad games and some in
between games. He's had only
one good conference game. I
didn't start him against
Washington, and maybe I
won't against California (to
morrow) either." In Johnson's
absence, 6-8 Tony Martin, a

fine passer, would play.
OSU is also gifted with one
of the nation's top backcourt
tandems in juniors Ray Blume
and Mark Radford. Blume is
seventh in the conference in
scoring (16.6), fourth in assists
(4.7), sixth in steals (2.0), sec
ond in free throw percentage
(81.3) and sixth in field goal
percentage (58.0).
As for Radtord, he is 17th in
Pac-10 scoring, ninth in assists,
fourth in steals, sixth in free
throw percentage and 10th in
field goal percentage.
Miller has his choice of three
equally-dangerous forwards:
left Stoutt, averaging 12.1
points per game (including a
big 23-point effort against
UCLA), Rob Holbrook (8.8
points a game) and Dwayne
Allen (second in the Pac-10
with 5.7 assists per game).
Stopping OSU, according to
Dißiaso, is a complex problem.
"Naturally, the first thing
you have to do is keep Johnson
from getting the ball in the
post," Dißiaso said "The sec
ond thing you have to do is
break their press, and the third
thing is not to turn it over in
your half-court offense."
The Cards managed this in
last year's meeting with the
Beavers at Maples, upsetting
OSU 79-76 in the last home
game of the season.

pered the Cards, now 3-12
overall and 1-6 in conference,
in their 77-69 loss to California
last Saturday.
"I would like to think that it
(the loss), again, emphasized
the fact that we have to be in
tense and defensively aware
and aggressive for an entire
game," Dißiaso said.
Another aspect of their game
that the Cards must improve
upon is their scoring contribu
tion from the bench. In the
past two games Stanford's sub
stitutes have scored only six
points, a meager total.
Saturday's loss to Cal pro
vided a good example of this
drought. Guards Doug Marty
and Doug Barnes had career
scoring bests and forwards
Kimberly Belton and Brian
Welch combined for 37 points,
but Stanford's bench managed
only two more points.
Dißiaso is fully aware that
some improvement is neces
sary.
"We're just trying to build
confidence in practice —
which is hard to do," Dißiaso
said, explaining how he is at
tempting to revitalize his
bench. "We try to encourage

the players. When they do
something well, we say, Hey,
nice going,' or something . . .
if they make a mistake doing
something they usually do
well, we don't worry about it."
If any Pac-10 team has been
less impressive than Stanford,
which has lost 11 of its last 12
games, it is Oregon.
No longer the collection of
fiery, froth-at-the-mouth
ballplayers it was under fiery,
froth-at-the-mouth coach Dick
Harter, Oregon does not have
a single player among the con
ference leaders in any offen
sive or defensive category.
Before last night's game at
Cal, the Ducks were tied with
Stanford and the Golden Bears
for last place in the Pac-10 at
1-6.
Still, Oregon has a smatter
ing of respectability. Starting
6-9 forward Mike Clark, averag
ing 10.8 points and 6.7 re
bounds a game, is a strong
player who battled Belton well
in Eugene last year.
Guards Felton Sealey and
)ohn Murray will hustle until
the lights in the gymnasium are
turned off, and 7-0 freshman
center Ron Burns and 6-7
freshman forward Ray Whiting
have shown promise.
Oregon State, however, has
got a lot more than just prom
ise on its side. The Beavers are
first in Pac-10 scoring, tallying
an average of 83.6 points a

game, and third in defense,
giving up 69.0 points per out
ing.
Naturally, these statistics
stem from blazing shooting
(OSU is tops in the conference
with a 55.5 team field goal per
centage) and tight defense
(gifted with quick players at
every position, the Beavers run
a skin-tight full-court press).
In the face of all this excel
lence, OSU coach Ralph Miller
has remained humble.
"It just makes life tougher,"
Miller said of his club's high
national ranking. "It's nice to
be accorded this honor — I
don't know that it's accurate.
You can't order the top 10 or 15
teams in the country."
The Beavers' most notice
able player is 6-10 junior center
Steve Johnson, the Pac-10's
leading scorer with a 75.3 per
centage.
Though he has been averag
ing 17.9 points (fourth in the
conference), Johnson has not
had a consistent season, ac
cording to Miller.
"Steve has been a yo-yo so
far," Miller said. "He's had
some outstanding games,
some bad games and some in
between games. He's had only
one good conference game. I
didn't start him against
Washington, and maybe I
won't against California (to
morrow) either." In Johnson's
absence, 6-8 Tony Martin, a

fine passer, would play.
OSU is also gifted with one
of the nation's top backcourt
tandems in juniors Ray Blume
and Mark Radford. Blume is
seventh in the conference in
scoring (16.6), fourth in assists
(4.7), sixth in steals (2.0), sec
ond in free throw percentage
(81.3) and sixth in field goal
percentage (58.0).
As for Radtord, he is 17th in
Pac-10 scoring, ninth in assists,
fourth in steals, sixth in free
throw percentage and 10th in
field goal percentage.
Miller has his choice of three
equally-dangerous forwards:
left Stoutt, averaging 12.1
points per game (including a
big 23-point effort against
UCLA), Rob Holbrook (8.8
points a game) and Dwayne
Allen (second in the Pac-10
with 5.7 assists per game).
Stopping OSU, according to
Dißiaso, is a complex problem.
"Naturally, the first thing
you have to do is keep Johnson
from getting the ball in the
post," Dißiaso said "The sec
ond thing you have to do is
break their press, and the third
thing is not to turn it over in
your half-court offense."
The Cards managed this in
last year's meeting with the
Beavers at Maples, upsetting
OSU 79-76 in the last home
game of the season.

Orlando Ward (42) launches a jumper in last Saturday's 77-69 loss to
California as Golden Bear John Ritchie (30) watches. Ward and his
teammates take on Oregon tomorrow night and Oregon State,
ranked no. 2 in the nation, Monday night, with both games at Maples
Pavilion.
The only thing that the Ore
gon and Oregon State men's
basketball teams have in com
mon is that they come from the
same state.
Otherwise, the Ducks, who
face Stanford at Maples Pavil
ion tomorrow night, and the
Beavers, who play the Cardi
nals Monday evening, are as
dissimilar as Billy Graham and
Billy Sims.
The Oregon squad has re
sembled the crew of the
H.M.S. Bounty more than a
basketball team. Second-year
coach Jim Haney, following the
great fictional tradition of Cap
tain Bligh, suspended forward
Phil Barner and guard Stu Lyon
before the season even began
and expelled guard Paul Bain
and starting 6-foot-10 center
Dan Hartshorne in December.
Oregon State, meanwhile,
has become the Pacific-10 Con
ference's dominant force.
With a 17-1 overall record and a
7-0 first-place conference
mark, the Beavers are ranked
No. 2 nationally behind only
DePaul.
Though Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso recognizes the differ
ences in talent between the
two schools, he states that he
won't make any major
strategic changes, except to
stress a more assertive on
court attitude.
"We're too far into the sea

froth-at-the-mouth coach Dick
Harter, Oregon does not have
a single player among the con
ference leaders in any offen
sive or defensive category.
Before last night's game at
Cal, the Ducks were tied with
Stanford and the Golden Bears
for last place in the Pac-10 at
1-6.
Still, Oregon has a smatter
ing of respectability. Starting
6-9 forward Mike Clark, averag
ing 10.8 points and 6.7 re
bounds a game, is a strong
player who battled Belton well
in Eugene last year.
Guards Felton Sealey and
)ohn Murray will hustle until
the lights in the gymnasium are
turned off, and 7-0 freshman
center Ron Burns and 6-7
freshman forward Ray Whiting
have shown promise.
Oregon State, however, has
got a lot more than just prom
ise on its side. The Beavers are
first in Pac-10 scoring, tallying
an average of 83.6 points a

game, and third in defense,
giving up 69.0 points per out
ing.
Naturally, these statistics
stem from blazing shooting
(OSU is tops in the conference
with a 55.5 team field goal per
centage) and tight defense
(gifted with quick players at
every position, the Beavers run
a skin-tight full-court press).
In the face of all this excel
lence, OSU coach Ralph Miller
has remained humble.
"It just makes life tougher,"
Miller said of his club's high
national ranking. "It's nice to
be accorded this honor — I
don't know that it's accurate.
You can't order the top 10 or 15
teams in the country."
The Beavers' most notice
able player is 6-10 junior center
Steve Johnson, the Pac-10's
leading scorer with a 75.3 per
centage.
Though he has been averag
ing 17.9 points (fourth in the
conference), Johnson has not
had a consistent season, ac
cording to Miller.
"Steve has been a yo-yo so
far," Miller said. "He's had
some outstanding games,
some bad games and some in
between games. He's had only
one good conference game. I
didn't start him against
Washington, and maybe I
won't against California (to
morrow) either." In Johnson's
absence, 6-8 Tony Martin, a

fine passer, would play.
OSU is also gifted with one
of the nation's top backcourt
tandems in juniors Ray Blume
and Mark Radford. Blume is
seventh in the conference in
scoring (16.6), fourth in assists
(4.7), sixth in steals (2.0), sec
ond in free throw percentage
(81.3) and sixth in field goal
percentage (58.0).
As for Radtord, he is 17th in
Pac-10 scoring, ninth in assists,
fourth in steals, sixth in free
throw percentage and 10th in
field goal percentage.
Miller has his choice of three
equally-dangerous forwards:
left Stoutt, averaging 12.1
points per game (including a
big 23-point effort against
UCLA), Rob Holbrook (8.8
points a game) and Dwayne
Allen (second in the Pac-10
with 5.7 assists per game).
Stopping OSU, according to
Dißiaso, is a complex problem.
"Naturally, the first thing
you have to do is keep Johnson
from getting the ball in the
post," Dißiaso said "The sec
ond thing you have to do is
break their press, and the third
thing is not to turn it over in
your half-court offense."
The Cards managed this in
last year's meeting with the
Beavers at Maples, upsetting
OSU 79-76 in the last home
game of the season.
