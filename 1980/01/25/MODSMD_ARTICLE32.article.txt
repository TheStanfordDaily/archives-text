Despite President jimmy Carter's call for
a possible American withdrawal from the
Summer Olympics in Moscow, sports con
tacts between the United States and the
Soviet Union are continuing.
A United States boxing team left Tues
day night for a three-city exhibition tour of
the Soviet Union, joining a team of Ameri
can wrestlers already there for a tourna
ment beginning later this week.
The 20-man boxing squad was delayed
for nearly three hours before taking off
from Dulles International Airport in
Washington when ground personnel
balked at servicing the flight as a protest to

the Soviets military intervention in Af
ghanistan.
Finally, after Soviet Aeroflot employees
took over baggage handling and ticketing
tasks which members of a local Teamsters
union had refused to handle, the flight was
able to leave.
"I feel I want to go because politics
shouldn't mix with sports," said Alex
Ramos, a 156-pounder from New York.
Early today, a team of track and field
athletes from the Soviet Union was
scheduled to arrive in Portland, Ore.,
where they will compete Saturday, begin
ning a five-meet tour of the United States.
Another Soviet track and tield team is

scheduled to compete in Los Angeles, Al
burquerque, N.M., Louisville, Ky., and
Houston from Feb. 1-16. A Soviet hockey
team is supposed to travel to Denver next
week to begin training with exhibition
games scheduled against Erie of the East
ern Hockey League Feb. 7 and the U.S.
Olympic hockey team in New York Feb. 9.
The American wrestlers will compete in
a tournament against the Russians Friday
through Sunday at Tbilisi. A Canadian
team was withdrawn from that event, al
though Pierre Trudeau, leader of Canada's
Liberal party, said he does not support the
boycott movement.
