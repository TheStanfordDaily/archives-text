# Men gymnasts visit Arizona
## 
### Dean Eyre 
While Stanford's women
gymnasts take the weekend off
to heal the young season's in
juries, Sadao Hamada and his
squad will make its first ap
pearance in Arizona.
The Cardinals travel to the
Grand Canyon State to take on
Arizona State tonight and
Arizona tomorrow night, both
meets being 7:30 p.m. affairs.
According to Hamada, both
Arizona teams can score "ab
out 262 points, 10 points ahead

of us."
Asked whether Stanford can
cut that lead, he replied, "I
think so. If the guys all hit, we
should do pretty well."
While posting a 1-4 record
overall, the men's team
has probably faced its
toughest opposition ever
in Oklahoma, Michigan,
UCLA and California. After fac
ing these powers, all ranked
high in the top 20, the Cards
won't have much vacation time
while out of the state.

Based on their scores so far
this season, the Arizona
schools place about 12th or
13th in the country according
to Hamada. While Stanford's
team score of 251 in the dual
meet with the Bruins and Wol
verines a couple of weeks ago
ranks about 18th in the nation,
highest in recent Farm history,
the Cards will have their work
cut out for them this weekend.
Going into the pair of meets,
Stanford is progressing at
about the level projected by

Hamada.
"The guys are in very good
shape and they are putting
their routines together,"
Hamada said. "We just have a
few minor injuries, nothing
serious."
Against the Sun Devils and
Wildcats, Stanford will stick
with the lineup used in past
meets. Ted Bostick, Mike Lee,
|eff Chung and David Hyde are
tentatively listed for the all
around competition.
