# Men meet Gauchos, women travel to Cal
## Easy tune-ups for swimmers 
### Dianne Cahoon 
The men's and women's
teams face UC-Santa Barbara
and California respectively to
morrow in meets not expected
to be overly challenging.
The women initiate the ac
tion tomorrow morning at
Cal's Harmon Pool against a
team "not to be taken lightly,"
in the words of coach Claudia
Thomas. Still, she acknow
ledged, "We should have no
problem beating them."
Divers Carol Noonan, Ann
Southworth and Alisa Bush are
overwhelming favorites to
sweep the springboard com
petition, while the swimmers
will be "pretty much swimming
those events that they have no
chance to swim in other
meets," Thomas promised.

"We're working hard now
and still have a lot of colds and
flu virus on the team," she
said.
Although the men's team is
definitely superior to its com
petition, the outcome of its 1
p.m. test at deGuerre is not so
assured as the womens'.
Coach Skip Kenney sum
marized the Cards' situation
succinctly: "If they shave, we
lose. If not, we win."
In a sport as dependent
upon physical conditioning
and mental preparation as
swimming, the edge provided
by a week's rest from overly
strenuous practice, as well as
the psychological boost and
epidermic sensitivity gained
from shaving body hair, may be
extremely significant.

Just as a shaved and rested'
squad from lowa defeated
strong but tired teams from
Berkeley, Indiana and Stanford
earlier this season, the Santa
Barbarans may pull the same
ploy. "When teams like that
have the chance to do that,
they sometimes will boost their
morale and gain early season
national recognition," Thomas
explained.
In fact, "We've been told
that they're making their sea
son off our meet," Kenney said
of Santa Barbara. "To beat a
team in our conference, which
is the best in the nation, would
be a real ego trip and build up
their confidence," he said.
"And I can understand that."
Vet, "I think our athletes are
too good to be beaten by Santa

' Barbara," he countered. "The
most exciting thing about our
team is theirdedication toeach
other. Enthusiasm is easy when
you're winning every week,
but it takes a special person to
display that enthusiasm even
when not winning," Kenney
said in respect for his swim
mers.
"We've had a lack of depth in
meets throughout theyear, but
I think that against Santa Bar
bara, we will see a lot of depth
we haven't seen before," he
asserted.
