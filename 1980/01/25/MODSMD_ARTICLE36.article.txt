When faced with the pros
pect of visiting another sea
food restaurant in San Fran
cisco, our immediate tendency
was to be less than enthusias
tic. After all, how many unique
ways are there to decorate a
semi-dark room, dip some fish
in a batter full of "secret" in
gredients, fry it and declare the
doors open for business?
Our skepticism rapidly dis
appeared upon arrival at
CONNIE'S? Why Not?, how
ever. For one thing, the loca
tion alone — the Mission Dis
trict — is interesting, and sec
ond, this restaurant proudly
claims its New Orleans style
seafood to be the best food in
the West. Thus our interest was
piqued, and the rest of the
evening proved to be no dis
appointment.
A small, unpretentious
place, CONNIE'S? is not what
we've come to expect from
seafood restaurants in the Bay
Area. To start with, the minute
we passed through the doors,
we were greeted and seated by
Ken Roberts, the owner.
A veteran of twenty-five
years at sea, Ken was one of the
highlights of the evening. A
proud man and self-styled
philosopher, Ken and his
wife/cook, Connie, have taken
it upon themselves to provide
San Francisco with authentic
Southern style seafood. He
started by explaining that
"Good cooking is Southern
cooking," and encouraged us
to try two classic Southern re
cipes as appetizers — the oys
ter loaf and the Creole gumbo.

With these two dishes,
CONNIE'S? successfully sup
ported its claim of authenticity.
The oyster loaf was a delicious
layering of lettuce., pickle and
large fried oysters inside a
french bread shell. It exhibited
none of the dryness to which
oyster loaf is susceptible and
was excellent.
The real achievement,
though, was the gumbo. With
her version of this dish, Connie
just may have proven Ken's
contention that the best cooks
in the world come from the

swamps of Louisiana. Now, as
the experienced among you
know, the basis of a good
gumbo is the herb "roue." It
requires just the right season
ing and after long hours of
cooking becomes the basis for
the broth. Hot sausage, okra,
rice and chicken complete the
mixture, resulting in a flavorful
black concoction the likes of
which is seldom seen north of
the Mason-Dixon line.
While either the oyster loaf
or the gumbo would have
made the visit worthwhile, the
dinner that followed was also
excellent. From choices such
as Oysters Rockefeller, Pan
Fried or Grilled Rainbow Trout,
Prawns, Oysters and Louisiana
Catfish, we chose the Seafood
Platter and Shrimp Creole.
The platter was unique in
that the oysters, scallops,
prawns and red snapper were
not buried in batter as is typi

cal. Instead the light coating of
corn meal preserved the deli
cate flavor of the seafood. The
generous helpings and the ac
companying salad and
cornbread muffins were suffi
cient for the hearty appetite.
The shrimp Creole was also
excellent. It possessed just the
right amount of spice and
shrimp to make this dish dis
tinctive.
Perhaps the only minor dis
appointment of the evening
was the limiting of the wine
selection to the house wine
(jug wines by Cribari). When
queried about this, however,
Ken pointed out that he prefer
red to have his efforts concen
trated in food preparation. In
addition he allows patrons to
bring their own wine if they so
choose.
All in all, we found Ken to be
accommodating in every way
and felt the entire evening was
fantastic. So, if you've got a
hankerin' fer some good ol'
Southern style cookin' or are
just interested in one of the
most unique seafood restaur
ants in the Bay Area, go see Ken
and Connie.

gumbo is the herb "roue." It
requires just the right season
ing and after long hours of
cooking becomes the basis for
the broth. Hot sausage, okra,
rice and chicken complete the
mixture, resulting in a flavorful
black concoction the likes of
which is seldom seen north of
the Mason-Dixon line.
While either the oyster loaf
or the gumbo would have
made the visit worthwhile, the
dinner that followed was also
excellent. From choices such
as Oysters Rockefeller, Pan
Fried or Grilled Rainbow Trout,
Prawns, Oysters and Louisiana
Catfish, we chose the Seafood
Platter and Shrimp Creole.
The platter was unique in
that the oysters, scallops,
prawns and red snapper were
not buried in batter as is typi

cal. Instead the light coating of
corn meal preserved the deli
cate flavor of the seafood. The
generous helpings and the ac
companying salad and
cornbread muffins were suffi
cient for the hearty appetite.
The shrimp Creole was also
excellent. It possessed just the
right amount of spice and
shrimp to make this dish dis
tinctive.
Perhaps the only minor dis
appointment of the evening
was the limiting of the wine
selection to the house wine
(jug wines by Cribari). When
queried about this, however,
Ken pointed out that he prefer
red to have his efforts concen
trated in food preparation. In
addition he allows patrons to
bring their own wine if they so
choose.
All in all, we found Ken to be
accommodating in every way
and felt the entire evening was
fantastic. So, if you've got a
hankerin' fer some good ol'
Southern style cookin' or are
just interested in one of the
most unique seafood restaur
ants in the Bay Area, go see Ken
and Connie.

CONNIE'S WHY NOT?
878 Valencia St.
San Francisco
647-9765
11 a.m.-l 1 p.m. Tues. thru
Sat.
2 p.m.-t 1 p.m. Sun.
When faced with the pros
pect of visiting another sea
food restaurant in San Fran
cisco, our immediate tendency
was to be less than enthusias
tic. After all, how many unique
ways are there to decorate a
semi-dark room, dip some fish
in a batter full of "secret" in
gredients, fry it and declare the
doors open for business?
Our skepticism rapidly dis
appeared upon arrival at
CONNIE'S? Why Not?, how
ever. For one thing, the loca
tion alone — the Mission Dis
trict — is interesting, and sec
ond, this restaurant proudly
claims its New Orleans style
seafood to be the best food in
the West. Thus our interest was
piqued, and the rest of the
evening proved to be no dis
appointment.
A small, unpretentious
place, CONNIE'S? is not what
we've come to expect from
seafood restaurants in the Bay
Area. To start with, the minute
we passed through the doors,
we were greeted and seated by
Ken Roberts, the owner.
A veteran of twenty-five
years at sea, Ken was one of the
highlights of the evening. A
proud man and self-styled
philosopher, Ken and his
wife/cook, Connie, have taken
it upon themselves to provide
San Francisco with authentic
Southern style seafood. He
started by explaining that
"Good cooking is Southern
cooking," and encouraged us
to try two classic Southern re
cipes as appetizers — the oys
ter loaf and the Creole gumbo.

With these two dishes,
CONNIE'S? successfully sup
ported its claim of authenticity.
The oyster loaf was a delicious
layering of lettuce., pickle and
large fried oysters inside a
french bread shell. It exhibited
none of the dryness to which
oyster loaf is susceptible and
was excellent.
The real achievement,
though, was the gumbo. With
her version of this dish, Connie
just may have proven Ken's
contention that the best cooks
in the world come from the

swamps of Louisiana. Now, as
the experienced among you
know, the basis of a good
gumbo is the herb "roue." It
requires just the right season
ing and after long hours of
cooking becomes the basis for
the broth. Hot sausage, okra,
rice and chicken complete the
mixture, resulting in a flavorful
black concoction the likes of
which is seldom seen north of
the Mason-Dixon line.
While either the oyster loaf
or the gumbo would have
made the visit worthwhile, the
dinner that followed was also
excellent. From choices such
as Oysters Rockefeller, Pan
Fried or Grilled Rainbow Trout,
Prawns, Oysters and Louisiana
Catfish, we chose the Seafood
Platter and Shrimp Creole.
