YAMATO
717 California St.

Never before have I known
such success with chopsticks,
both literally and figuratively
speaking. YAMATO is a
Japanese restaurant in San
Francisco, just on the edge of
Chinatown, on California St. It
is an excellent place to go if you
are looking for authentic
Japanese surroundings and
cuisine.
Upon being ushered into
our particular dining room, my
friends and I were asked to re
move our shoes and follow our
hostess into a room where the
floor was covered with the
traditional straw matting. The
tables stood only knee high —
this was authentic. We sat on
cushionswith ourlegsand feet
hanging over into a well un
derneath the table. Uncom
mon to us, but actually very
comfortable.
Our dining room was spar
ingly decorated and immacu
late. The hanging wall panels in
the room were recreations of
paintings borrowed from the
doors of ancient castles; the
garden was designed after the
famous temple gardens of
meditation. Japanese music
played in the background.
Tea is steeped at your table

while you are choosing your
appetizer. Other drinks be
sides green tea are imported
Japanese beers, imported teas
and special mixed drinks, all
averaging $3.25.
Appetizing choices can be
madefrom four kinds of soups,
seafoods, hibachi specialties
or salads. Our choice was from
the hibachi, sesame chicken
fried in a light batter and mari
nated in sweet sake wine — a
mouth-watering treat. Just the
right preparation for the meal.
There are two five-course
dinners, the Gourmet Dinner
and the Imperial Dinner (fit for
royalty, as the names imply) for
$13.75. These include soup of
the day, gourmet salad, shrimp
tempura (shrimpdipped in bat
ter and delicately fried) and
two other dishes, equally sue

culent.
The other dinner choices in
clude soup of the day and
salad, and range from $7.00 for
the Chicken Teriyaki to $12.75
for Steak Teriyaki. Tempura,
Beef and Chicken Sukiyaki and
Yaki Tori are available as well.

For a special experience, you
can order dinners which are
prepared at your table. This is a
novelty that is hard to beat. The
prices for these dinners range
from $7.75 to $9.75 and include
rice, soup of the day and green

tea. The meals are predomin
antly seafood, beef or chicken,
seasoned magnificently and
served with a wide variety of
vegetables.
Although the prices are a bit
steep for a student's budget, it
is definitely worthwhile for
those who choose to indulge.
The quality and quantity (the
servings are more than gener
ous) of the food make a combi
nation that is not easily surpas
sed.
For those who don't frequent
the City, the parking can be a
problem unless you choose
one of the underground park
ing lots. You can expect to pay
up to $2.50 an hour for this.
YAMATO is conveniently found
near one of these lots.
