Saturday, Cubberley 7:30 & 9:30
p.m.
This 1951 John Huston movie is
thoroughly entertaining, and you
won't find a more inspired bit of
casting than the pairing of Hum
phrey Bogart and Katharine Hep
burn. Bogart's the crusty river
boat captain and Hepburn's the
untouchable spinster; it's basi
cally a magical matchup, and it
features all the elements — ad
venture, comedy, charm and fi
nally love. Huston, lames Agee
and |ohn Collier wrote the script;
Robert Morely co-stars.

A Clockwork Orange
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the sc
reen by making a gruelingly vis
ual movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near fu
ture; the issue at stake is whether
individuality is more important
than the society that must deal
with the individual. Malcolm
McDowell stars as a man whose
joy comes mainly from commit
ting acts of violence; he is ar
rested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this
singularly disturbing film.

The Black Hole *
Guild Theatre, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion pic
ture space race with a brilliant
plunge into the world of outer
space special effects, and falls flat
on its face. The effects are fun in
the beginning but the wires soon
become obnoxiously visible and
people start breathing in space.
The best acting is done by a tin
can named V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that
looks like a cross between Star
Wars' R2-D2 and a beer keg. The
movie plays like Captain Nemo in
space and the religious over
tones probably have Dante spin
ning in his grave.
—Simon Labov
The General * * * *
Monday, Cubberley 7 p.m.
The deadpan visage of Buster
Keaton may just be the most de
ceptively expressive in movie his
tory; he captures you, but you're
never quite sure how he does it.
This 1926 movie is one of
Keaton's very best; in an almost
epic comedy, Keaton is once
again in the wrong place at the
wrong time — all against the
backdrop of the Civil War. lean
Renoir's Grand Illusion will be
shown as the second half of
Monday's double bill.
— R.L.
Going In Style * * *
Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie,
that, because of its slower pacing

and lack of ribald comedy, has
been unjustly criticized. George
Burns, Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to
watch, and in his movie debut,
28-year old Martin Brest makes
up for his lack of plot ideas with a
compassionate and gentle touch.
Much of the movie's comedy is
contained in the opening sequ
ences, where the elderly trio rob
a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, more emotionally
wrenching. Well worth seeing, if
only to watch actors who don't
need to trample you to be effec
tive.
—R.L.
Grand Illusion W * ★ *
Monday, Cubberley
lean Renoir made this classic
anti-war movie two years before
WW II started. There's a heavy
sense of defeated inevitability
imbued in the movie's "grand il
lusion,'' and this somehow
makes its message even more
powerful. Erich von Stroheim
plays the German commandant,
and Pierre Fresney portrays the
French captain, lean Gabin and
Dalio co-star.
— R.L.
The jerk * *
Old Mill
Look, I love Steve Mar
tin, but this is more an attempt
to cash in on his present status
than an effort to face tougher
creative challenges. Steve's born
a "poor black child," and several
of the skits in this rags to riches
to rags story revel so wildly in
their dumbness that they simply
must be inspired, but this is sim
ply not the movie that's going to
make Martin a memorable movie
comedian. He's got the unique
moves and he's perhaps got the
mind, but doesn't yet have the
material — The jerk's more a str
inging together of sketches than
a movie. Maybe next time, okay?
—R.L.
Quadrophenia ♦ * »
Old Mill
This interpretation of The
Who's 1973 album may or may
not be what you expected, but
there's a live-wire energy here
that surely does the world's
greatest rock band proud. Music
is of fundamental importance to
the kids populating this gritty,
realistic look at the British
Mods-Rockers conflict of the
mid-'6os; if anything else, this
movie makes the. recent punk
and "new wave" movements in
England much more understand
able.
—R.L.
Bonnie and Clyde * * * *
Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:30 p.m.
Arthur Penn's look at the
notorious bank-robbing couple
combines violence, lust, thrills,
horror and a perhaps spellbind
ing beauty — in short, this is a
great movie. Even Faye Dunaway
gives a stirring performance in

this remarkable evocation of the
Dust-Bowl era, and Warren
Beatty and Gene Hackman are
unforgettable.
— R.L.
Kramer vs. Kramer * • Vi
Old Mill
In most respects, writer
director Robert Benton's movie
is an astonishing one. With the
interplay between a brilliant
Dustin Hoffman and a youngster
of almost frighteningly correct
instincts named lustin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton con
structs a moving, compassion
ate, almost Truffaut-like charac
ter study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his
son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of

the film. After all the care and
honesty Benton's invested
throughout, why does he have
to load the dice against the
female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
as much merit as Hoffman's, but
instead of taking things head on,
Benton backs off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity, lane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb

composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen
dros.

The Return of the Pink Panther
« WIT
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9:15 p.m.
This superbcomedy is the third
effort in the Panther series, and
probably the best. Certainly,
Peter Sellers is in top form as In
spector Closeau, the confused,
endearing bumbler. The Pink
Panther diamond has again been
stolen, and — watch out —
Closeau's been put on the case.
Blake Edwards' direction is tight

Co-starring Herbert Lorn and
Christopher Plummer; the
cinematography is the work of
the late Geoffrey Unsworth.

Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false
melodramatics; almtost con
structed as-the equivalent
of a Willie Nelsorr song. The fact
that Nelson's one yi the co-stars
only enhances the"warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
houghtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-Jane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver
tises breakfast cereal for a de
humanizing-conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set

the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford tall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoid
ing overt messages and, despite
the prefab elements, maintain
ing its charm and good natured
nass throughout. A completely
amiable movie, and there's no
thing much wrong with that.

Casque d'Or tv t V
Wednesday, Bishop 7rto p.m.
Jacques Becker's movie is a

Star Trek * *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of
greed — Paramount Pictures. A
mechanical creation of man
comes back to haunt him as the
darling creature's quest for
knowledge leads it to finally
search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where
one of the Enterprise's crew

members saves civilization by
gleefully agreeing to some cos
mic sex — is unintentionally
hilarious. Shatner, Nimoy and
the rest were much better on
TV; on the 70mm screen they're
almost unbelievably wooden.
The rest of the movie is like a
greatest hits of Douglas Trum
bull and |ohn Dykstra's previous
special effects set out in lengthly
detail.

Apocalypse Mow * ★ ★ *
Old Mill
Century, San )ose
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this just-ended de
cade. It has almost untenable
ambitions, but the profound
questions that it confronts you
with justify the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind.
Starring Marlon Brando, Martin
Sheen and Robert Duvall.

The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion of Star is Born except this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character
vaguely based on Janis loplin.
But the movie only makes threw
references to 1969, and without
those you'd probably just as
sume the movie was set in the
present. And the music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than
as Janis Joplin's form of blues
and rock. The performances at
times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ
ences. When teamed with either
Frederic Forrest or Alan Bates,
Midler comes off much better,
but it's too little too late.

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directorial perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as an ex
pression of visual and Howard
Hawks-style comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennetor Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is
generally not of the lasting vari
ety. That may partially explain
the very harsh reaction of most
critics to this movie; also, such
completely physical, frenzied
comedic action may be horribly
out of place now.
Despite all that, l like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working better than
John Belushi, and Dan Aykroyd,
Treat Williams, Toshiro Mifune
and Slim Pickens are all fine
here. But Robert Stack as Gen
eral "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell
quietly steals the show as he
tearfully watches Disney's
Dumbo as a full-scale riot goes
on outside the theater.

Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie,
that, because of its slower pacing

and lack of ribald comedy, has
been unjustly criticized. George
Burns, Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to
watch, and in his movie debut,
28-year old Martin Brest makes
up for his lack of plot ideas with a
compassionate and gentle touch.
Much of the movie's comedy is
contained in the opening sequ
ences, where the elderly trio rob
a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, more emotionally
wrenching. Well worth seeing, if
only to watch actors who don't
need to trample you to be effec

Old Mill
In most respects, writer
director Robert Benton's movie
is an astonishing one. With the
interplay between a brilliant
Dustin Hoffman and a youngster
of almost frighteningly correct
instincts named lustin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton con
structs a moving, compassion
ate, almost Truffaut-like charac
ter study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his
son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of

the film. After all the care and
honesty Benton's invested
throughout, why does he have
to load the dice against the
female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
as much merit as Hoffman's, but
instead of taking things head on,
Benton backs off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity, lane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb

composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen
dros.

A Capra film without the false

that Nelson's one yi the co-stars
only enhances the"warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
houghtful feeling on this Robert

Faded rodeo star Redford adver

rebels by stealing the corpora

million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the

the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford tall in love.
The performances, especially

An amazing work of mad

Producer-director Francis Cop

Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit

stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri

It would be easy to get worked

vaguely based on Janis loplin.
But the movie only makes threw
references to 1969, and without
those you'd probably just as
sume the movie was set in the
present. And the music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than
as Janis Joplin's form of blues
and rock. The performances at
times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi

Although it's a decided regres

dramatic tension, but as an ex

the very harsh reaction of most

Kramer vs. Kramer * • Vi
Old Mill
In most respects, writer
director Robert Benton's movie
is an astonishing one. With the
interplay between a brilliant
Dustin Hoffman and a youngster
of almost frighteningly correct
instincts named lustin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton con
structs a moving, compassion
ate, almost Truffaut-like charac
ter study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his
son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of

the film. After all the care and
honesty Benton's invested
throughout, why does he have
to load the dice against the
female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
as much merit as Hoffman's, but
instead of taking things head on,
Benton backs off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity, lane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb

composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen
dros.

Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false

of a Willie Nelsorr song. The fact
that Nelson's one yi the co-stars
only enhances the"warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
houghtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-Jane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver
tises breakfast cereal for a de

rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set

the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford tall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol

An amazing work of mad

Producer-director Francis Cop

intelligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit

stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this just-ended de

nihilistic, vision of mankind.

It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother. Really just another ver

one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character
vaguely based on Janis loplin.
But the movie only makes threw
references to 1969, and without
those you'd probably just as
sume the movie was set in the
present. And the music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than
as Janis Joplin's form of blues
and rock. The performances at
times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ

Frederic Forrest or Alan Bates,
Midler comes off much better,

Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directorial perfor

suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as an ex
pression of visual and Howard
Hawks-style comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennetor Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is
generally not of the lasting vari
ety. That may partially explain
the very harsh reaction of most
critics to this movie; also, such
completely physical, frenzied
comedic action may be horribly
out of place now.
Despite all that, l like this

comedian working better than

Kramer vs. Kramer * • Vi
Old Mill
In most respects, writer
director Robert Benton's movie
is an astonishing one. With the
interplay between a brilliant
Dustin Hoffman and a youngster
of almost frighteningly correct
instincts named lustin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton con
structs a moving, compassion
ate, almost Truffaut-like charac
ter study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his
son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me
at least) flaw in the treatment of
the custody case at the end of

the film. After all the care and
honesty Benton's invested
throughout, why does he have
to load the dice against the
female character (Meryl Streep)?
Her case seems to have at least
as much merit as Hoffman's, but
instead of taking things head on,
Benton backs off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity, lane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb

composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen
dros.

Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false
melodramatics; almtost con
structed as-the equivalent
of a Willie Nelsorr song. The fact
that Nelson's one yi the co-stars
only enhances the"warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
houghtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-Jane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver
tises breakfast cereal for a de
humanizing-conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set

the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford tall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoid
ing overt messages and, despite
the prefab elements, maintain

Empty apocalyptic rumblings

the seeming epic grandeur of its

An amazing work of mad

Producer-director Francis Cop

intelligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit

stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this just-ended de

nihilistic, vision of mankind.

It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion of Star is Born except this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character
vaguely based on Janis loplin.
But the movie only makes threw
references to 1969, and without
those you'd probably just as
sume the movie was set in the
present. And the music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than
as Janis Joplin's form of blues
and rock. The performances at
times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ

Frederic Forrest or Alan Bates,
Midler comes off much better,

1941 * * *

Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directorial perfor

suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as an ex
pression of visual and Howard
Hawks-style comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennetor Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is
generally not of the lasting vari
ety. That may partially explain
the very harsh reaction of most
critics to this movie; also, such
completely physical, frenzied
comedic action may be horribly
out of place now.
Despite all that, l like this

instead of taking things head on,
Benton backs off and retreats
into an ending that is a little too
neat for its own good. Streep's
extraordinary performance only
accentuates the deficiencies in
how her character is written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking
slender movie material and
creating a movie of surprising
depth and complexity, lane Ale
xander co-stars, and the superb

composition is the work of
cinematographer Nestor Almen
dros.

The Return of the Pink Panther
« WIT
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9:15 p.m.
This superbcomedy is the third
effort in the Panther series, and
probably the best. Certainly,
Peter Sellers is in top form as In
spector Closeau, the confused,
endearing bumbler. The Pink
Panther diamond has again been
stolen, and — watch out —
Closeau's been put on the case.
Blake Edwards' direction is tight
and inspired — as is his script.
Co-starring Herbert Lorn and
Christopher Plummer; the
cinematography is the work of
the late Geoffrey Unsworth.

Electric Horseman * * *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
A Capra film without the false
melodramatics; almtost con
structed as-the equivalent
of a Willie Nelsorr song. The fact
that Nelson's one yi the co-stars
only enhances the"warm, nearly
uneventful, yet somehow quietly
houghtful feeling on this Robert
Redford-Jane Fonda star vehicle.
Faded rodeo star Redford adver
tises breakfast cereal for a de
humanizing-conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corpora
tion's mistreated symbol — a $12
million dollar thoroughbred.
TV newswoman Fonda doggedly
pursues Redford across the
Southwest as he prepares to set

the horse free; and, of course,
Fonda and Redford tall in love.
The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoid
ing overt messages and, despite
the prefab elements, maintain
ing its charm and good natured
nass throughout. A completely
amiable movie, and there's no
thing much wrong with that.

Casque d'Or tv t V
Wednesday, Bishop 7rto p.m.
Jacques Becker's movie is a
brilliant one; but the film is so
emotionally tortuous that you
probably won't leave the theater
in exultation. Simone Signoret,
in one of her strongest roles,

stars as the gigolette. Serge Reg
giani and Claude Dauphin co
star.

Star Trek * *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of
greed — Paramount Pictures. A
mechanical creation of man
comes back to haunt him as the
darling creature's quest for
knowledge leads it to finally
search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where
one of the Enterprise's crew

members saves civilization by
gleefully agreeing to some cos
mic sex — is unintentionally
hilarious. Shatner, Nimoy and
the rest were much better on
TV; on the 70mm screen they're
almost unbelievably wooden.
The rest of the movie is like a
greatest hits of Douglas Trum
bull and |ohn Dykstra's previous
special effects set out in lengthly
detail.

Apocalypse Mow * ★ ★ *
Old Mill
Century, San )ose
An amazing work of mad
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam that
combine frightening energy and
intensity with humor, sensuality
and overwhelming evil. Coppola
structures a journey into almost
literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse
Now is, I think, the best Ameri
can movie of this just-ended de
cade. It has almost untenable
ambitions, but the profound
questions that it confronts you
with justify the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind.
Starring Marlon Brando, Martin
Sheen and Robert Duvall.

Breaking Away * * *
Friday-Saturday, New Varsity
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
Away may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his ta
lent on a bicycle.

10 * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The sexist ad campaign has
misled many people to this
movie; if you're looking for a
semi-pornographic turn-on, 10
may not be right for you.
Writer-director Blake Edwards'
values are, for lack of a better
word, straight, and this comedy
about male mid-life crisis proba
bly won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwri
ter, Dudley Moore is an ingratiat
ing bumbler, and Edwards gives
the remainder of the cast more
than enough depth to get by. Ex
cept for Bo Derek, that is. This
poster-star just may have found
her "niche" as the vacuous "10"
the title refers to
—R.L.

The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion of Star is Born except this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character
vaguely based on Janis loplin.
But the movie only makes threw
references to 1969, and without
those you'd probably just as
sume the movie was set in the
present. And the music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than
as Janis Joplin's form of blues
and rock. The performances at
times manage to obscure some
of the movie's hollowness, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ
ences. When teamed with either
Frederic Forrest or Alan Bates,
Midler comes off much better,
but it's too little too late.
—R.L.
The Paper Chase ** *
Friday-Saturday, New Varsity
lames Bridges (The China Syn
drome) wrote and directed this
sensitive examination of the hor
rors of being a first-year student
at Harvard Law School. The
movie has almost become a cult
film for pre-law majors. Bridges'
meandering style is a distraction,
but the confrontations between
professor John Houseman and
student Timothy Bottoms are
hypnotic. Lindsay Wagner co
stars.
— R.L.
1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directorial perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as an ex
pression of visual and Howard
Hawks-style comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennetor Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is
generally not of the lasting vari
ety. That may partially explain
the very harsh reaction of most
critics to this movie; also, such
completely physical, frenzied
comedic action may be horribly
out of place now.
Despite all that, l like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working better than
John Belushi, and Dan Aykroyd,
Treat Williams, Toshiro Mifune
and Slim Pickens are all fine
here. But Robert Stack as Gen
eral "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell
quietly steals the show as he
tearfully watches Disney's
Dumbo as a full-scale riot goes
on outside the theater.
