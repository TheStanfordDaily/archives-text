Delta jetliner hijacked to Cuba
Atlanta — A Delta Air Lines flight bound from
Atlanta to New York was hijacked early today
over North Carolina by a man who ordered the
pilot to fly to Cuba, spokesmen for the Federal
Aviation Administration and Delta said.
The jetliner carried 49 passengers and 15
crew members, the FAA said.
Delta Flight 1116, was hijacked over
Greensboro, N.C., Delta spokesman Jim
Ewing said.
The flight, which originated in Los Angeles
yesterday and made a stop in Dallas, left At
lanta at 1 a.m. en route to Kennedy Interna
tional Airport in New York. It was hijacked at
1:51 a.m. EST, Ewing said.
An FAA spokesman said the plane, an L-1011,
was commandeered by a man who demanded
to be flown to Havana. The spokesman said he
had no further information on the man or what
weapon he produced.
The spokesman said the plane was en route
to Cuba with an estimated time of arrival of
3:44 a.m. EST.
Draft registration outlined
Washington — President jimmy Carter will
decide by Feb. 9 whether to propose the re
gistration of women as well as men for the
military draft, White House officials said yes
terday.
Responding to a torrent of questions raised
by the president's call for the resumption of
registration in his State of the Union address
Wednesday night, the officials described a
planned registration system that initially would
be only a shadow of the complex Selective
Service System that was ended in )une 1973.
John White, deputy director of the Office ot
Management and Budget, said the registration
would be handled by the Postal Service. Young
men — and women if Congress includes them,
as Carter is considered likely to recommend —
would, be required to fill out a "simple form"
at their local post office, with the information
to be stored in Selective Service System com
puters, he said.
But draft cards would not be issued, there
would be no physical examinations and no
classification of registrants according to mari
tal or other status under the maze of exemp
tions used in the past by the Selective Service
System, White said.
He said local draft boards wo.;ld not im
mediately become active, but will be reconsti
tuted and held in "a reserve status."
Among the major unanswered questions
facing the administration Thursday was the age
range during which registration will be re
quired. Currently, the Selective Service Sys
tem law authorizes the registration of men be
tween the ages of 18 and 26, a group that num
bers some 16 million Americans. But White
said this age range may be narrowed under the
new registration system, depending on the
size of the manpower pool sought by the gov
ernment.
White said if will be "several months" before

the registration of men begins, and that regist
ration of women, if they are included, will take
longer because it will require legislation and
undoubtedly set off a sharp debate in Con
gress.
House urges Olympic boycott
Washington — By a vote of 386-12, the House
yesterday joined President (immy Carter in
urging the transfer, cancellation or boycott of
the 1980 Olympics scheduled this summer for
Moscow.
The action came four days after Carter first
called on the independent U.S. Olympic
Committee to push the proposal as part of his
policy of retaliation against the Soviet Union
for its invasion of Afghanistan.
Although many House members said they
did not believe that taking the Olympics from
Moscow, or boycotting the games there,
would lead to a Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan, they expressed the hope that
punitive action would sabotage a Soviet prop
aganda campaign based on the Olympics and
would hurt the Kremlin's relations with its citi
zens.
Khomeini ailment feeds anxiety
Iranian physicians ministered to the stricken
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the intensive
care unit of a Tehran hospital yesterday but he
and his doctors sought to reassure anxious
Iranians that his heart ailment posed no im
mediate danger.
But its precise nature was not disclosed and
his sudden hospitalization came on the eve of
what could be a crucially significant presiden
tial election in Iran. Tensions already were
running high because of reports reaching
Tehran that "mercenaries" had infiltrated from
Iraq to "make trouble" during the election.
The ruling Revolutionary Council ordered
the revolutionary guard militia on alert
nationwide.
Supermarket strike continues
San Francisco — Striking grocery clerks and
San Francisco Bay area supermarket represen
tatives met yesterday afternoon with federal
mediators in an attempt to settle the four
day-old strike-lockout which has affected
thousands of workers in eight counties.
David Selvin, spokesman for the United
Food and Commercial Workers union, an
nounced that eight more stores signed interim
agreements with the union, bringing to 11 the
number of chains splintering off from the 28-
member Food Employers Council.
Brentwood Markets, BigC Super, Cal-Mart,
Food Fair, Food Villa, PW Supermarkets, Park
and Shop, Sutro Super and Westlake Foods all
signed individual agreements with the union
Wednesday. Calla Foods, Fry's and Campos
Food Fair had signed earlier.
Food council spokesman John Haering said
the signings have not weakened the council's
position.
Wages and benefits are the central issues in
the strike. The unions have rejected a prop

osed hourly wage increase of $1.73 on the cur
rent wage for experienced clerks of $8.79. The
total wage benefit package would have in
creased $3.97 hourly.
The union seeks a wage increase ot $1.81
hourly and a combined wage-benefit increase
of $4.58 hourly.
UK seeks to punish Soviets
London — Britain announced yesterday a
comprehensive package of actions intended to
punish the Soviet Union for its invasion of Af
ghanistan. The British expect most of these
steps to be matched by many of the other
European allies.
Britain is canceling high-level ministerial,
military and cultural contacts with the Rus
sians, ending a preferential commercial credit
agreement and cooperating with the United
States and other allies to restrict strategic
high-technology exports to the Soviet Union,
according to the British Foreign Secretary,
Lord Carrington.
He said Britain also will continue to press the
other eight members of the European
Economic Community to stop the subsidized
sale of surplus Common Market butter, poul
try and sugar to the Russians. The Common
Market countries already have agreed to sup
port the U.S. embargo on grain sales to the
Soviet Union by ending their small sales to the
Russians and limiting their grain exports to
Eastern European countries to present levels.
Finally, Carrington made clear that Britain is
considering with the United States and other
allies economic and possibly military assis
tance to countries around Afghanistan to help
protect them from Soviet attacks or subversion
and to protect "the stability and integrity of the
(Persian) Gulf and the Straits ot Hormuz,"
through which is shipped much of the oil pro
duced in the Middle East.
But the British are not reducing their present
trade with the Soviet Union or banning any
future trade that can be secured with non
preferential credit arrangements.
The British government saw no point,
explained one official, in banning British trade
with the Soviets that would only be substituted
for by other European allies, notably France.
More CIA secrecy proposed
Washington — Encouraged by President
jimmy Carter's call for removal of "unwar
ranted restraints" on U.S. intelligence ac
tivities, some of the ClA's friends on Capitol
Hill yesterday proposed legislation to make it
easier for the agency to keep its operations
secret.
With maximum fanfare, seven senators led
by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), announced
introduction of a bill to make it a crime to
reveal the name of an overseas CIA operative,
to exempt most intelligence activities from the
Freedom of Information Act and to sharply re
strict the number ot members of Congress
who must be informed about secret opera
tions.
A few hours before the Moynihan group ap

peared at a press conference, Rep. Robert
McClory (R-lll.), introduced a companion bill
that would reduce from eight to two the
number ol Congressional committees that
must be informed about clandestine efforts to
manipulate events in foreign countries.
Moynihan said that as a result of investiga
tions in 1974 and 1975 into CIA assassination
plots, drug tests and other abuses, many
Americans had come to believe that intelli
gence activities were generated at the whim of
the U.S. government. Instead, he said, the CIA
has no choice but to counter Soviet intelli
gence activities if the United States hopes to
compete for world influence.
Kennedy plans policy speech
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) canceled a four-day campaign swing
info New England yesterday and announced
he would stay in Washington to deliver a major
policy speech Monday.
the abrupt change of plans and a seeming
uncertainty about the campaign's immediate
future fueled speculation that Kennedy was
considering withdrawing trom his race against
President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
Tom Southwick, Kennedy's press secretary,
denied that there was any plan tor the senator
to retire from the race. "He is not withdrawing,
absolutely," Southwick said. "He just ain't."
Speculation that Kennedy would attack Car
ter on sensitive foreign policy issues was en
couraged by the fact that Kennedy left the
Capitol after Carter's State of the Union mes
sage Wednesday night without making any
substantive comment on the president's ad
dress, which dealt mainly with foreign policy
and U.S.-Soviet relations.
At the same time, campaign officials said that
paid members of the national campaign staff in
Washington would forego their paychecks
next week so that the money could be rushed
into the New England campaign.

Delta Flight 1116, was hijacked over
Greensboro, N.C., Delta spokesman Jim
Ewing said.
The flight, which originated in Los Angeles
yesterday and made a stop in Dallas, left At
lanta at 1 a.m. en route to Kennedy Interna
tional Airport in New York. It was hijacked at
1:51 a.m. EST, Ewing said.
An FAA spokesman said the plane, an L-1011,
was commandeered by a man who demanded
to be flown to Havana. The spokesman said he
had no further information on the man or what
weapon he produced.
The spokesman said the plane was en route
to Cuba with an estimated time of arrival of
3:44 a.m. EST.
Draft registration outlined
Washington — President jimmy Carter will
decide by Feb. 9 whether to propose the re
gistration of women as well as men for the
military draft, White House officials said yes
terday.
Responding to a torrent of questions raised
by the president's call for the resumption of
registration in his State of the Union address
Wednesday night, the officials described a
planned registration system that initially would
be only a shadow of the complex Selective
Service System that was ended in )une 1973.
John White, deputy director of the Office ot
Management and Budget, said the registration
would be handled by the Postal Service. Young
men — and women if Congress includes them,
as Carter is considered likely to recommend —
would, be required to fill out a "simple form"
at their local post office, with the information
to be stored in Selective Service System com
puters, he said.
But draft cards would not be issued, there
would be no physical examinations and no
classification of registrants according to mari
tal or other status under the maze of exemp
tions used in the past by the Selective Service
System, White said.
He said local draft boards wo.;ld not im
mediately become active, but will be reconsti
tuted and held in "a reserve status."
Among the major unanswered questions
facing the administration Thursday was the age
range during which registration will be re
quired. Currently, the Selective Service Sys
tem law authorizes the registration of men be
tween the ages of 18 and 26, a group that num
bers some 16 million Americans. But White
said this age range may be narrowed under the
new registration system, depending on the
size of the manpower pool sought by the gov
ernment.
White said if will be "several months" before

the registration of men begins, and that regist
ration of women, if they are included, will take
longer because it will require legislation and
undoubtedly set off a sharp debate in Con
gress.
House urges Olympic boycott
Washington — By a vote of 386-12, the House
yesterday joined President (immy Carter in
urging the transfer, cancellation or boycott of
the 1980 Olympics scheduled this summer for
Moscow.
The action came four days after Carter first
called on the independent U.S. Olympic
Committee to push the proposal as part of his
policy of retaliation against the Soviet Union
for its invasion of Afghanistan.
Although many House members said they
did not believe that taking the Olympics from
Moscow, or boycotting the games there,
would lead to a Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan, they expressed the hope that
punitive action would sabotage a Soviet prop
aganda campaign based on the Olympics and
would hurt the Kremlin's relations with its citi
zens.
Khomeini ailment feeds anxiety
Iranian physicians ministered to the stricken
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the intensive
care unit of a Tehran hospital yesterday but he
and his doctors sought to reassure anxious
Iranians that his heart ailment posed no im
mediate danger.
But its precise nature was not disclosed and
his sudden hospitalization came on the eve of
what could be a crucially significant presiden
tial election in Iran. Tensions already were
running high because of reports reaching
Tehran that "mercenaries" had infiltrated from
Iraq to "make trouble" during the election.
The ruling Revolutionary Council ordered
the revolutionary guard militia on alert
nationwide.
Supermarket strike continues
San Francisco — Striking grocery clerks and
San Francisco Bay area supermarket represen
tatives met yesterday afternoon with federal
mediators in an attempt to settle the four
day-old strike-lockout which has affected
thousands of workers in eight counties.
David Selvin, spokesman for the United
Food and Commercial Workers union, an
nounced that eight more stores signed interim
agreements with the union, bringing to 11 the
number of chains splintering off from the 28-
member Food Employers Council.
Brentwood Markets, BigC Super, Cal-Mart,
Food Fair, Food Villa, PW Supermarkets, Park
and Shop, Sutro Super and Westlake Foods all
signed individual agreements with the union
Wednesday. Calla Foods, Fry's and Campos
Food Fair had signed earlier.
Food council spokesman John Haering said
the signings have not weakened the council's
position.
Wages and benefits are the central issues in
the strike. The unions have rejected a prop

osed hourly wage increase of $1.73 on the cur
rent wage for experienced clerks of $8.79. The
total wage benefit package would have in
creased $3.97 hourly.
The union seeks a wage increase ot $1.81
hourly and a combined wage-benefit increase
of $4.58 hourly.
UK seeks to punish Soviets
London — Britain announced yesterday a
comprehensive package of actions intended to
punish the Soviet Union for its invasion of Af
ghanistan. The British expect most of these
steps to be matched by many of the other
European allies.
Britain is canceling high-level ministerial,
military and cultural contacts with the Rus
sians, ending a preferential commercial credit
agreement and cooperating with the United
States and other allies to restrict strategic
high-technology exports to the Soviet Union,
according to the British Foreign Secretary,
Lord Carrington.
He said Britain also will continue to press the
other eight members of the European
Economic Community to stop the subsidized
sale of surplus Common Market butter, poul
try and sugar to the Russians. The Common
Market countries already have agreed to sup
port the U.S. embargo on grain sales to the
Soviet Union by ending their small sales to the
Russians and limiting their grain exports to
Eastern European countries to present levels.
Finally, Carrington made clear that Britain is
considering with the United States and other
allies economic and possibly military assis
tance to countries around Afghanistan to help
protect them from Soviet attacks or subversion
and to protect "the stability and integrity of the
(Persian) Gulf and the Straits ot Hormuz,"
through which is shipped much of the oil pro
duced in the Middle East.
But the British are not reducing their present
trade with the Soviet Union or banning any
future trade that can be secured with non
preferential credit arrangements.
The British government saw no point,
explained one official, in banning British trade
with the Soviets that would only be substituted
for by other European allies, notably France.
More CIA secrecy proposed
Washington — Encouraged by President
jimmy Carter's call for removal of "unwar
ranted restraints" on U.S. intelligence ac
tivities, some of the ClA's friends on Capitol
Hill yesterday proposed legislation to make it
easier for the agency to keep its operations
secret.
With maximum fanfare, seven senators led
by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), announced
introduction of a bill to make it a crime to
reveal the name of an overseas CIA operative,
to exempt most intelligence activities from the
Freedom of Information Act and to sharply re
strict the number ot members of Congress
who must be informed about secret opera
tions.
A few hours before the Moynihan group ap

peared at a press conference, Rep. Robert
McClory (R-lll.), introduced a companion bill
that would reduce from eight to two the
number ol Congressional committees that
must be informed about clandestine efforts to
manipulate events in foreign countries.
Moynihan said that as a result of investiga
tions in 1974 and 1975 into CIA assassination
plots, drug tests and other abuses, many
Americans had come to believe that intelli
gence activities were generated at the whim of
the U.S. government. Instead, he said, the CIA
has no choice but to counter Soviet intelli
gence activities if the United States hopes to
compete for world influence.
Kennedy plans policy speech
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) canceled a four-day campaign swing
info New England yesterday and announced
he would stay in Washington to deliver a major
policy speech Monday.
the abrupt change of plans and a seeming
uncertainty about the campaign's immediate
future fueled speculation that Kennedy was
considering withdrawing trom his race against
President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
Tom Southwick, Kennedy's press secretary,
denied that there was any plan tor the senator
to retire from the race. "He is not withdrawing,
absolutely," Southwick said. "He just ain't."
Speculation that Kennedy would attack Car
ter on sensitive foreign policy issues was en
couraged by the fact that Kennedy left the
Capitol after Carter's State of the Union mes
sage Wednesday night without making any
substantive comment on the president's ad
dress, which dealt mainly with foreign policy
and U.S.-Soviet relations.
At the same time, campaign officials said that
paid members of the national campaign staff in
Washington would forego their paychecks
next week so that the money could be rushed
into the New England campaign.

An FAA spokesman said the plane, an L-1011,
was commandeered by a man who demanded
to be flown to Havana. The spokesman said he
had no further information on the man or what
weapon he produced.
The spokesman said the plane was en route
to Cuba with an estimated time of arrival of

Draft registration outlined
Washington — President jimmy Carter will
decide by Feb. 9 whether to propose the re
gistration of women as well as men for the
military draft, White House officials said yes
terday.
Responding to a torrent of questions raised
by the president's call for the resumption of
registration in his State of the Union address
Wednesday night, the officials described a
planned registration system that initially would
be only a shadow of the complex Selective
Service System that was ended in )une 1973.
John White, deputy director of the Office ot
Management and Budget, said the registration
would be handled by the Postal Service. Young
men — and women if Congress includes them,
as Carter is considered likely to recommend —
would, be required to fill out a "simple form"
at their local post office, with the information
to be stored in Selective Service System com
puters, he said.
But draft cards would not be issued, there
would be no physical examinations and no
classification of registrants according to mari
tal or other status under the maze of exemp
tions used in the past by the Selective Service
System, White said.
He said local draft boards wo.;ld not im
mediately become active, but will be reconsti
tuted and held in "a reserve status."
Among the major unanswered questions
facing the administration Thursday was the age
range during which registration will be re
quired. Currently, the Selective Service Sys
tem law authorizes the registration of men be
tween the ages of 18 and 26, a group that num
bers some 16 million Americans. But White
said this age range may be narrowed under the
new registration system, depending on the
size of the manpower pool sought by the gov
ernment.
White said if will be "several months" before

the registration of men begins, and that regist
ration of women, if they are included, will take
longer because it will require legislation and
undoubtedly set off a sharp debate in Con
gress.
House urges Olympic boycott
Washington — By a vote of 386-12, the House
yesterday joined President (immy Carter in
urging the transfer, cancellation or boycott of
the 1980 Olympics scheduled this summer for
Moscow.
The action came four days after Carter first
called on the independent U.S. Olympic
Committee to push the proposal as part of his
policy of retaliation against the Soviet Union
for its invasion of Afghanistan.
Although many House members said they
did not believe that taking the Olympics from
Moscow, or boycotting the games there,
would lead to a Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan, they expressed the hope that
punitive action would sabotage a Soviet prop
aganda campaign based on the Olympics and
would hurt the Kremlin's relations with its citi
zens.
Khomeini ailment feeds anxiety
Iranian physicians ministered to the stricken
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the intensive
care unit of a Tehran hospital yesterday but he
and his doctors sought to reassure anxious
Iranians that his heart ailment posed no im
mediate danger.
But its precise nature was not disclosed and
his sudden hospitalization came on the eve of
what could be a crucially significant presiden
tial election in Iran. Tensions already were
running high because of reports reaching
Tehran that "mercenaries" had infiltrated from
Iraq to "make trouble" during the election.
The ruling Revolutionary Council ordered
the revolutionary guard militia on alert
nationwide.
Supermarket strike continues
San Francisco — Striking grocery clerks and
San Francisco Bay area supermarket represen
tatives met yesterday afternoon with federal
mediators in an attempt to settle the four
day-old strike-lockout which has affected
thousands of workers in eight counties.
David Selvin, spokesman for the United
Food and Commercial Workers union, an
nounced that eight more stores signed interim
agreements with the union, bringing to 11 the
number of chains splintering off from the 28-
member Food Employers Council.
Brentwood Markets, BigC Super, Cal-Mart,
Food Fair, Food Villa, PW Supermarkets, Park
and Shop, Sutro Super and Westlake Foods all
signed individual agreements with the union
Wednesday. Calla Foods, Fry's and Campos
Food Fair had signed earlier.
Food council spokesman John Haering said
the signings have not weakened the council's
position.
Wages and benefits are the central issues in
the strike. The unions have rejected a prop

osed hourly wage increase of $1.73 on the cur
rent wage for experienced clerks of $8.79. The
total wage benefit package would have in
creased $3.97 hourly.
The union seeks a wage increase ot $1.81
hourly and a combined wage-benefit increase
of $4.58 hourly.
UK seeks to punish Soviets
London — Britain announced yesterday a
comprehensive package of actions intended to
punish the Soviet Union for its invasion of Af
ghanistan. The British expect most of these
steps to be matched by many of the other
European allies.
Britain is canceling high-level ministerial,
military and cultural contacts with the Rus
sians, ending a preferential commercial credit
agreement and cooperating with the United
States and other allies to restrict strategic
high-technology exports to the Soviet Union,
according to the British Foreign Secretary,
Lord Carrington.
He said Britain also will continue to press the
other eight members of the European
Economic Community to stop the subsidized
sale of surplus Common Market butter, poul
try and sugar to the Russians. The Common
Market countries already have agreed to sup
port the U.S. embargo on grain sales to the
Soviet Union by ending their small sales to the
Russians and limiting their grain exports to
Eastern European countries to present levels.
Finally, Carrington made clear that Britain is
considering with the United States and other
allies economic and possibly military assis
tance to countries around Afghanistan to help
protect them from Soviet attacks or subversion
and to protect "the stability and integrity of the
(Persian) Gulf and the Straits ot Hormuz,"
through which is shipped much of the oil pro
duced in the Middle East.
But the British are not reducing their present
trade with the Soviet Union or banning any
future trade that can be secured with non
preferential credit arrangements.
The British government saw no point,
explained one official, in banning British trade
with the Soviets that would only be substituted
for by other European allies, notably France.
More CIA secrecy proposed
Washington — Encouraged by President
jimmy Carter's call for removal of "unwar
ranted restraints" on U.S. intelligence ac
tivities, some of the ClA's friends on Capitol
Hill yesterday proposed legislation to make it
easier for the agency to keep its operations
secret.
With maximum fanfare, seven senators led
by Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), announced
introduction of a bill to make it a crime to
reveal the name of an overseas CIA operative,
to exempt most intelligence activities from the
Freedom of Information Act and to sharply re
strict the number ot members of Congress
who must be informed about secret opera
tions.
A few hours before the Moynihan group ap

peared at a press conference, Rep. Robert
McClory (R-lll.), introduced a companion bill
that would reduce from eight to two the
number ol Congressional committees that
must be informed about clandestine efforts to
manipulate events in foreign countries.
Moynihan said that as a result of investiga
tions in 1974 and 1975 into CIA assassination
plots, drug tests and other abuses, many
Americans had come to believe that intelli
gence activities were generated at the whim of
the U.S. government. Instead, he said, the CIA
has no choice but to counter Soviet intelli
gence activities if the United States hopes to
compete for world influence.
Kennedy plans policy speech
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) canceled a four-day campaign swing
info New England yesterday and announced
he would stay in Washington to deliver a major
policy speech Monday.
the abrupt change of plans and a seeming
uncertainty about the campaign's immediate
future fueled speculation that Kennedy was
considering withdrawing trom his race against
President Jimmy Carter for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
Tom Southwick, Kennedy's press secretary,
denied that there was any plan tor the senator
to retire from the race. "He is not withdrawing,
absolutely," Southwick said. "He just ain't."
Speculation that Kennedy would attack Car
ter on sensitive foreign policy issues was en
couraged by the fact that Kennedy left the
Capitol after Carter's State of the Union mes
sage Wednesday night without making any
substantive comment on the president's ad
dress, which dealt mainly with foreign policy
and U.S.-Soviet relations.
At the same time, campaign officials said that
paid members of the national campaign staff in
Washington would forego their paychecks
next week so that the money could be rushed
into the New England campaign.
