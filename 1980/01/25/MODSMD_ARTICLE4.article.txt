# 'Rolling' earthquake jolts N. California

The Los Angeles Times
San Francisco â€” A powerful ear
thquake shook a large area of North
ern California yesterday swaying
high-rise buildings in downtown San
Francisco and causing at least 24
minor injuries at the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory 40 miles east of
here, near the epicenter.
Extensive damage probably was
averted because the quake produced
more of a gentle, rolling motion than
a sharp jolt.
No damage was reported on cam
pus according to the facilities opera
tions and maintenance department.
Most of the 7000 workers at the
Lawrence Lab, a nuclear research
facility operated by the University of
California for the U.S. Department of
Energy, were sent home when
natural gas began leaking from dam
aged pipes. Officials said there was

no damage to the lab's nuclear reac
tor and no danger from radioactivity.
"It was very, very strong here," Jeff
Carberson, the lab's public informa
tion officer, said. "We've had dam
age to the building I'm in and I'm not
supposed to be in it."
Hundreds of other persons were
evacuated from schools and office
buildings when cracks appeared in
the buildings or when gas lines
-oroke.
Interstate 580, the principal artery
between the San Francisco Bay Area
and the San Joaquin Valley, was
tlosed for a time when an overpass
sank several inches, but apparently
sustained no structural damage.
Seismologists at UC-Berkeley es
timated the magnitude of the quake,
which occurred at 11 a.m., at 5.5 on
the Richter scale, and placed the epi
center about 12 miles northwest of
Livermore, at the southern end of
the Antioch Fault. It lasted about 30
seconds and was felt as far away as
Reno, Nev., 250 miles to the east.
Two aftershocks followed closely
after the initial quake and measured
5.2 and 4.8, respectively.
Most of the injuries at the lab in
volved sprains or bruises and occur
red when people fell or were tossed
about in mobile trailers that are used
as temporary offices. One employee

was admitted to a Livermore hospital
complaining of chest pains.
Elsewhere in the city, a roofer suf
fered burns to his hands when hot tar
spilled over them and several other
minor injuries were reported.
"I saw one person hit by a file
cabinet that fell over," an employee
at the lab said. "It was very scary."
The quake, however, was not as
severe as one which struck in two
sharp, rocking jolts last Aug. 6 and
registered 5.9 on the Richter scale,
the strongest quake to hit Northern
California in 53 years.
The epicenter of the August quake
was in a lightly populated area of
rugged ranchland and hill country
along the Calavares Fault near Hollis
ter, Calif.
A spokesman at the state Office of
Emergency Services in Sacramento,
Calif., said he was "reluctant" to say
the Lawrence lab had been
evacuated but conceded that
"nonessential people were sent
home." He also said minor water and
gas leaks were reported throughout
the city of Livermore, which has a
population of about 50,000, and tele
phone and electrical services were
temporarily interrupted.
One of the hardest hit areas was a
mobile home park, where 133 homes
were shaken from their foundations
and their owners evacuated.

In San Francisco, plaster fell from
the ornate moldings between the
ceilings and walls on the second floor
of City Hall but there was no signific
ant damage reported and no injuries.
Buildings also swayed in Sacramento
and Oakland, and 100 tenants of an
aging downtown hotel in Stockton
were evacuated when the walls
began to crack.
"Everything with legs fell over,"
Andrew Amate said from his home in
Walnut Creek, Calif., about 25 miles
north of Livermore. "There are 20
gallons of water on the floor from
two fish tanks. We lost an expensive
collection of decanters."
The Bay Area Rapid Transit District
shut down service for about 40 mi
nutes to check for structural damage
to its tracks and tunnels, including
the transbay tube connecting San
Francisco and Oakland, but trains re
sumed running shortly before noon.
Every increase of a number of the
Richter scale, a measure of ground
motion as recorded on seismog
raphs, means a tenfold increase in
magnitude. The 1971 San Fernando
earthquake in Southern California,
by way of comparison, was recorded
as 6.4. The great San Francisco ear
thquake of 1906, before the advent of
sophisticated measuring devices,
has been estimated at 7.9.
