## Lyman opposes draft deferments 
### Julie Kaufmann 
In a KZSU Campus Conference in
terview last night, University Presi
dent Richard Lyman said that he
thinks deferments for college stu
dents should not be part of a selec
tive service program and that there
are differences between the current
situation and the Vietnam conflict.
"I feel very strongly that there
should not be college deferments,"
Lyman said. "I think that it's inequit
able. I don't think it's defensible in
terms of training people for man
power needs, and I think it's a provo
cation to bitterness between classes
of people, between people who
enjoy the privilege of going on to
college and university and people
who, for whatever reason, felt that it
was impossible.
"The point is, I think many more
Americans will find it easy to see

maintaining access to Middle Eastern
oil as a vital American interest than
found it easy to see why the war in
Southeast Asia made any sense,"
Lyman continued.
"I think it was very hard to argue
the proposition that the war in
Southeast Asia involved vital Ameri
can interests. You don't have to look
any distance down the road at all to
see that access to that oil. . . is a vital
interest," he said.
"People will be making a mistake if
they assume that the country's re
sponse to college protests on this
issue at this time will be as sympathe
tic as it often was to Vietnam pro
tests. Even then the public reaction
was not always sympathetic."
Not welcoming draft
Although Lyman said that the ar
guments that fueled the "wide
spread and effective" protest against

the Vietnam conflict will not be as
effective today," he added, "that
doesn't mean that I just welcome the
draft and think it's a wonderful idea. I
am not an enthusiast of the draft."
Concerning other matters, Lyman
said that a committee will probably
be named within a day or two to find
a replacement for University football
coach Rod Dowhower, who resigned
Wednesday. Interim head coach
Doug Single will not be a candidate
for the job, at his own request.
If the relative cost of attending
Stanford keeps increasing and the
quality of secondary schooling keeps
declining, Lyman said that it is "en-
Irely conceivable" that the Univer
ty might not continue to draw
lough qualified applicants.
