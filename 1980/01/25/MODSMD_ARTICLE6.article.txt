## French communists back Soviet invasion Eurocommunism movement falters 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
Paris — Whatever price in
world opinion and reprisals the
Soviet Union pays for its inva
sion of Afghanistan, the Krem
lin leadership can probably be
sure of one peripheral gain,
and that is the effective end of
Eurocommunism.
Eurocommunism has never
been encouraged by Moscow,
which has done everything that
it could to quash any indepen
dence in the Communist
movement anywhere.
Throughout the 19705, Mos
cow had to put up with increas
ing assertions of indepen
dence from the Communist
parties of Western Europe — in
Italy, France and Spain in par
ticular — on such issues as
human rights and support for
the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization.
There were regular and re
peated growls of disapproval
and irritation from the Kremlin.
But now Moscow's worries
about Eurocommunism are
largely over.
Prodigal son
The French Communist Party
has come to the vigorous sup
port ot Moscow's thrust into
Afghanistan, and party leader
Georges Marchais has re
turned to Moscow like a prodi
gal son for a bear-hug reunion
with Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev after years of es
trangement.
Italian Communist leader
Enrico Berlinguer and Spanish
party leader Santiago Carrillo
.ire still independently oppos
ing the invasion, but there is no
longer any pretext of a united
Communist front in Western

Europe.
When Marchais flew to Mos
cow for his reunion wifh
Brezhnev two weeks ago, it
was his first trip to the Soviet
Union since 1974. Moreover,
he went first to Rome for a
meeting with Berlinguer. The
two argued at length over their
differing positions on the inva
sion.
The Italian Communists,
with more than 29 percent of
the popular vote in the country
and yet another government
crisis in the offing, are a great
deal closer to power-sharing
than the French Communists
have ever been. Berlinguer is
not about to fly in the face of
Italian public opinion by en
dorsing Soviet aggression.
Cracking whip
Nevertheless, the collapse of
any agreed position with the
French is no help to Berlin
guer, and the Kremlin has lost
no time in trying to crack the
whip against "bourgeois ar
guments and misunderstand
ings which undermine interna
tional Communist solidarity."
An article in Moscow's New
Times avoided naming the par
ties that have come out against
the Afghan aggression (Italy,
Spain, Britain and Yugoslavia),
but admonished them for
"biased commentaries which
ignore the basic difference in
foreign-policy objectives of
socialism and imperialism."
With the French party back
in the fold, Moscow's fear that
the Eu rocommunists would
grow stronger and refuse to
toe the Moscow line is clearly
past.

Marchais, in a Soviet televi
sion appearance that was also
seen by French viewers,
seemed almost jubilant at
being back in the fold.
The French Communists
began shifting back to their old
pro-Moscow stance when they
broke their election alliance
with the Socialists in advance
of the National Assembly elec
tion in March 1978, thus paving
the way for a sweeping victory
by the Gaullists and supporters
of President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing. Since then, Socialist
leader Francois Mitterrand has
maneuvered almost pitifully to
try to patch up another alliance
for the presidential elections of
1981, when he expects to make
a third bid for the Elysee
Palace.
Marchais has been contemp
tuous of these overtures. And,
in lining up with the Soviets on
Afghanistan, he has slammed
the door so hard in the
Socialist's faces that perhaps
even Mitterrand may hear the
noise. Marchais' strategy is to
drive the Socialist party back
into second place on the left in
French politics, where it was
when the two parties joined
forces in their first election ag
reement in 1972.
Now that there is no con
ceivable possibility of a united
leftist front in the presidential
election, Giscard d'Estaing is
virtually assured of a second
seven-year term. Since the
Kremlin openly showed its
support for Giscard d'Estaing
in his first election campaign

against Mitterrand in 1974, and
backed the government coali
tion forces in the National As
sembly elections of 1978, it
would be consistent for it to be
happy with anything that Mar
chais can do to ensure defeat
for the left and a victory for
Giscard d'Estaing in 1981.
The Kremlin does not want
— has never wanted — to see
Communists in power in
Western Europe wearing the
garments of bourgeois democ
racy and taking positions on
world issues that are at odds
with Moscow's. From the
Kremlin's point of view, a
French president such as Gis
card d'Estaing is preferable —
as demonstrated by French re
luctance to get mixed up in any
hard-line response to the Af
ghan invasion.
So Marchais, having
marched out of the fold in
1972, has marched back in to
start the new decade. There are
those in the party who don't
like it, but they are the same
kind of unhappy intellectual
dissidents who have been reg
ularly disciplined or purged by
the party leadership for 35
years.
