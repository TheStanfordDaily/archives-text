Fort Victoria, Zimbabwe —
Rhodesian military and gov
ernment authorities here
acknowledged Wednesday
that 4500 semi-trained army
auxiliaries in this region are
fully deployed "educating"
rural blacks against "socialism
and communism."
Political observers said the
auxiliaries' activities provided
tacit support of moderate
politicians such as former
Prime Minister Abel Muzorewa
and worked against avowed
Marxist guerrilla leader Robert
Mogabe and socialist-leaning
Joshua Nkomo. It is occurring
despite a British-monitored
cease-fire under which politi
cal activity by armed soldiers of
either the government or the
guerrillas is-forbidden.
In a candid explanation to
correspondents on the role of
the controversial auxiliaries —
also known in Rhodesia as

"ptumo re vanuh" (meaning
"spear of the nation" in the
Shona language of the region)
— Maj. Nick Fawcett said one
of the missions of the grass
roots auxiliaries is to "set out to
achieve normality" by educat
ing people on the value of the
"national ideology to replace
that being jammed down the
people's throats by guerrillas."
The chief civilian official
here in Rhodesia's limited
martial-1 aw admi ni strati on,
Provincial Commissioner
Robert Menzie, said it is neces
sary to "counter the ideology
of socialism and communism"
if the country is to be restored
to a condition that will allow
rural reconstruction to begin
after seven years of guerrilla
war.
Maj. Fawcett, Menzie and
the chief auxiliary in the area,
Amen Mpofu, denied that the
auxiliaries were advocating the
election of any specific candi

date.
Correspondents were taken
by armored car deep into a tri
bal area to the hamlet of
70 miles southeast of Fort Vic
toria to observe the "pfumo re
vanhu" in action. They saw a
smartly turned-out group of
about 30 local blacks in
chocolate-brown uniforms.
They drilled well and sang a
song that praised Muzorewa,
who is a bishop in the
Methodist Church, the chief
moderate candidate in coming
elections to create a represen
tative black majority govern
ment. "The bishop is blessed
for drawing this country away
from bloodshed," a black
sergeant translated at the re
quest of the white district
commissioner, Neil Lawton.
The auxiliaries have im
plemented since 1978 the
"grass roots" of the Salisbury
government's plan for defeat
ing guerrillas in rural areas.
