# Sakharov's dissent finally silenced
## 
### 
The Washington Post
Washington — Andrei Dmitrivich
Sakharov made his first great reputation by
inventing a hydrogen bomb, and his sec
ond by inventing a role for himself as a
one-man defense force for the protection
of human rights and human dignity in the
Soviet Union.
"Force" is surely the right word, al
though no personal encounter with
Sakharov would hint at its aptness. In per
son he is the mildest of absent-minded
professors, a gentle man who likes to
drink his tea out of the saucer rather than
the cup.
In action, he was a genuine force to be
dealt with — a dedicated, sometimes
fanatic advocate for Soviet citizens who
wanted to speak their minds but found
that the regime's political police would not
permit it. Sakharov's function, as he has
seen it, was to serve as a witness for these
Soviet citizens, and to do all he could to
make known their plight.
The best evidence of this effectiveness,
probably, was his arrest in Moscow Tues
day by agents of that same political police
force. The police could only act with au
thorization from the ruling Politburo itself,
for that was the level on which the
Sakharov problem aggravated the Soviet
leadership. For a dozen years, he has
eaten away at the official mythology about
Soviet society like acid in a soft container.
Until Tuesday, when the authorities he
so annoyed sent him off to a silent internal
exile in the grimy industrial city of Corki,
where no foreigners are permitted,
Sakharov enjoyed special protection. The
leadership didn't know what to do with
him.
He was, after all, a legitimate national

here, winner of the Stalin Prize, the Lenin
Prize, and three times names a Hero of
Socialist Labor. (He was stripped of all
these Tiresday.) No living Soviet citizen
outsidp of the mutually self
congratulatory Politburo had received
such honors.
In his tape-recorded oral "memoirs"
Nikita Khruschev said of Sakharov: "I
knew him and was profoundly impressed
by him. Everyone was. He was, as they say,
a crystal of morality among our scientists."
Not only that, he gave the Soviet Union the
hydrogen bomb at a moment when Stalin
was desperate to have it. He did not win
those state prizes for being "a crystal of
morality."
Sakharov became known in the West for
his 1968 essay, "Progress, Coexistence and
Intellectual Freedom," a plea for liberal,
humane principles, and the eventual con
vergence of communism and capitalism in
a system of universal democracy. Many
years before he wrote this essay — which
he knew was a dangerous act, likely to
transform his life as a Soviet scientist —
Sakharov had begun to agitate inside the
system, particularly for control of nuclear
weapons.
Though always extremely modest — for
example, Khruschev credits him as the
father of the hydrogep bomb, but
Sakharov always shares the credit — he
acknowledges believing that he had sorrn
influence in 1962 on the test-ban treaty.
Soviet officials were hung up on t! e
problem of the undetectability of undi r
ground nuclear tests. Sakhaiov propo'ed
ignoring them, and drafting a treaty con
trolling only atmospheric testing. This was
the idea incorporated in the 196T treaty.
In 1968, after publication in the West of
his essay on coexistence, Sakharov was

removed from his secret positions, and his
career as a research scientist effectively
ended. His career as a political activist had
just begun.
Characteristically, he drifted into it
slowly. As late as 1971 it was unusual for
Sakharov to meet with a western corres
pondent in Moscow, a form of behavior
that was still unthinkable to most mem
bers of his generation. His role was trans
formed during the early 19705, and by 1973
he was holding press conferences on a
regular basis in the small Moscow flat he
shared with his second wife and her
mother.
Sakharov's contest with the Committee
for State Security, the KGB, was an excit
ing spectacle — one man against a gigantic
police force, one spirit against a system.
And for a time, Sakharov seemed to be
winning.
Inside the Soviet Union, millions of citi
zens learned about Sakharov's views and
activities. (Information about them was
broadcast into the country by Western
radio stations.*
He won the Nobel peace Prize. He
helped countless Soviet citizens in dis
tress.
In the long run it was an unequal con
test. The KGB had too many resources.
They put enormous pressure on Sakharov
and his wife, and they both aged quickly.
Sakharov lost his ebullient optimism. Still
the Politburo was afraid to arrest him, fear
ing the repercussions among Soviet scien
tists and in the West, where scientists of
many lands have stood up for Sakharov.
Now, after a Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan and the collapse of Soviet-American
detente, the inhibitions have apparently
disappeared, and Andrei Sakharov has
been silenced, at least for a time.

exile in the grimy industrial city of Corki,
where no foreigners are permitted,
Sakharov enjoyed special protection. The
leadership didn't know what to do with
him.
He was, after all, a legitimate national

here, winner of the Stalin Prize, the Lenin
Prize, and three times names a Hero of
Socialist Labor. (He was stripped of all
these Tiresday.) No living Soviet citizen
outsidp of the mutually self
congratulatory Politburo had received
such honors.
In his tape-recorded oral "memoirs"
Nikita Khruschev said of Sakharov: "I
knew him and was profoundly impressed
by him. Everyone was. He was, as they say,
a crystal of morality among our scientists."
Not only that, he gave the Soviet Union the
hydrogen bomb at a moment when Stalin
was desperate to have it. He did not win
those state prizes for being "a crystal of
morality."
Sakharov became known in the West for
his 1968 essay, "Progress, Coexistence and
Intellectual Freedom," a plea for liberal,
humane principles, and the eventual con
vergence of communism and capitalism in
a system of universal democracy. Many
years before he wrote this essay — which
he knew was a dangerous act, likely to
transform his life as a Soviet scientist —
Sakharov had begun to agitate inside the
system, particularly for control of nuclear
weapons.
Though always extremely modest — for
example, Khruschev credits him as the
father of the hydrogep bomb, but
Sakharov always shares the credit — he
acknowledges believing that he had sorrn
influence in 1962 on the test-ban treaty.
Soviet officials were hung up on t! e
problem of the undetectability of undi r
ground nuclear tests. Sakhaiov propo'ed
ignoring them, and drafting a treaty con
trolling only atmospheric testing. This was
the idea incorporated in the 196T treaty.
In 1968, after publication in the West of
his essay on coexistence, Sakharov was

removed from his secret positions, and his
career as a research scientist effectively
ended. His career as a political activist had
just begun.
Characteristically, he drifted into it
slowly. As late as 1971 it was unusual for
Sakharov to meet with a western corres
pondent in Moscow, a form of behavior
that was still unthinkable to most mem
bers of his generation. His role was trans
formed during the early 19705, and by 1973
he was holding press conferences on a
regular basis in the small Moscow flat he
shared with his second wife and her
mother.
Sakharov's contest with the Committee
for State Security, the KGB, was an excit
ing spectacle — one man against a gigantic
police force, one spirit against a system.
And for a time, Sakharov seemed to be
winning.
Inside the Soviet Union, millions of citi
zens learned about Sakharov's views and
activities. (Information about them was
broadcast into the country by Western
radio stations.*
He won the Nobel peace Prize. He
helped countless Soviet citizens in dis
tress.
In the long run it was an unequal con
test. The KGB had too many resources.
They put enormous pressure on Sakharov
and his wife, and they both aged quickly.
Sakharov lost his ebullient optimism. Still
the Politburo was afraid to arrest him, fear
ing the repercussions among Soviet scien
tists and in the West, where scientists of
many lands have stood up for Sakharov.
Now, after a Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan and the collapse of Soviet-American
detente, the inhibitions have apparently
disappeared, and Andrei Sakharov has
been silenced, at least for a time.
The Washington Post
Washington — Andrei Dmitrivich
Sakharov made his first great reputation by
inventing a hydrogen bomb, and his sec
ond by inventing a role for himself as a
one-man defense force for the protection
of human rights and human dignity in the
Soviet Union.
"Force" is surely the right word, al
though no personal encounter with
Sakharov would hint at its aptness. In per
son he is the mildest of absent-minded
professors, a gentle man who likes to
drink his tea out of the saucer rather than
the cup.
In action, he was a genuine force to be
dealt with — a dedicated, sometimes
fanatic advocate for Soviet citizens who
wanted to speak their minds but found
that the regime's political police would not
permit it. Sakharov's function, as he has
seen it, was to serve as a witness for these
Soviet citizens, and to do all he could to
make known their plight.
The best evidence of this effectiveness,
probably, was his arrest in Moscow Tues
day by agents of that same political police
force. The police could only act with au
thorization from the ruling Politburo itself,
for that was the level on which the
Sakharov problem aggravated the Soviet
leadership. For a dozen years, he has
eaten away at the official mythology about
Soviet society like acid in a soft container.
