# Lyman to resign; accepts top Rockefeller post
## Successor will face key issues 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
Strengthening of undergraduate
programs and coping with financial
problems will be two of the key tasks
awaiting the successor to President
Richard Lyman, according to key fa
culty members and administrators
contacted yesterday.
In general, however, an administ
ration shake-up or major changes in
the academic or fiscal policy of the
University is unlikely.
Lyman announced Saturday that
he would resign as president effec
tive this summer, to assume the post
as president of the Rockefeller
Foundation.

"An institution of Stanford's
strength and character has a tre
mendous momentum of its own,"
said Joel Smith, vice president for
development.
While a new president "will surely
try to change things as a matter of
emphasis," Smith said appointment
of a new president will not mean the
University will be an entirely diffe
rent place.
Others agreed.
"All of us in the senior administra
tion share some basic values and go
als, and we fully expect these to carry
on," said William Massy, vice presi
dent for business and finance.
He added that he considers it un
likely that a new president would ask
for the resignations of other senior
administrators in order to allow him a
free reign in appointing "his own
staff."
Inevitably, the new president will
have different priorities than Lyman
has, but any changes will have to be
made in the context of the Universi
ty's "relentlessly difficult" budget
problems, Smith said.

"There are a great many oppor
tunities for a new administration,"
Massy said. He looks for a
strengthening of the humanities
along with undergraduate programs,
but he cautioned that this needs to
be accomplished without injury to
the strong graduate programs. He
added, though, "I think it can be
done."
Not unrelated to finances and
program is the issue of faculty re
cruitment which Law School Dean
Charles Meyers sees as the key issue
the next president will face.
"The only thing that's been lacking
in the last 10 years is money, and
(Lyman) has been doing all he can to
improve that. He has been able to
preserve top quality despite the fi
nancial constraints.
"But the problem of erosion of fa
culty salaries and the extremely at
tractive options in the private sector,
especially for professional school fa
culty, are going to confront the new

president with very serious chal
lenges," Meyer said.
The relationship of the Medical
Center to the rest of the University is
another key issue which will con
front the next president, Smith said.
Every phase of the relationship
must be examined, he said. This,
combined with concerns of budget
and quality ot undergraduate educa
tion, point up the complexity of the
president's job, he added.
According to Robert Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president for trustee
affairs, appointment of the president
is a matter for the Board of Trustees,
but the bylaws of the University do
not specify a mechanism by which
the new president is to be chosen.
Board President Peter Bing said the
board will discuss the issue at its
meeting Feb. 11 and 12. As to likely
successors, there was an almost uni
versal unwillingness to speculate.
The most oft-mentioned name is
that of Provost Donald Kennedy who

returned to the University last year
after heading the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for two years.
At the time of Kennedy's appoint
ment, Lyman had just been passed
over for the top job with the Ford
Foundation, and speculation then
was that Lyman was ready to leave.
The Kennedy appointment, it was
thought, was a way of getting Ken
nedy primed to assume the presi
dency quickly should Lyman resign.
Kennedy, Lyman and Bing all de
nied that there was any link in Ken
nedy's appointment as provost and a
subsequent appointment to the pres-l
idency, and Bing reiterated his denial
yesterday.
"Certainly Donald Kennedy is one
of a number of persons who are pos
sible successors to Dick," he said.
But he emphasized that thare are
many other candidates and the first
issue is forthe "board todecidewhat
procedures will be used to make this 1
choice."

lenges," Meyer said.
The relationship of the Medical
Center to the rest of the University is
another key issue which will con
front the next president, Smith said.
Every phase of the relationship
must be examined, he said. This,
combined with concerns of budget
and quality ot undergraduate educa
tion, point up the complexity of the
president's job, he added.
According to Robert Hamrdla, as
sistant to the president for trustee
affairs, appointment of the president
is a matter for the Board of Trustees,
but the bylaws of the University do
not specify a mechanism by which
the new president is to be chosen.
Board President Peter Bing said the
board will discuss the issue at its
meeting Feb. 11 and 12. As to likely
successors, there was an almost uni
versal unwillingness to speculate.
The most oft-mentioned name is
that of Provost Donald Kennedy who

returned to the University last year
after heading the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for two years.
At the time of Kennedy's appoint
ment, Lyman had just been passed
over for the top job with the Ford
Foundation, and speculation then
was that Lyman was ready to leave.
The Kennedy appointment, it was
thought, was a way of getting Ken
nedy primed to assume the presi
dency quickly should Lyman resign.
Kennedy, Lyman and Bing all de
nied that there was any link in Ken
nedy's appointment as provost and a
subsequent appointment to the pres-l
idency, and Bing reiterated his denial
yesterday.
"Certainly Donald Kennedy is one
of a number of persons who are pos
sible successors to Dick," he said.
But he emphasized that thare are
many other candidates and the first
issue is forthe "board todecidewhat
procedures will be used to make this 1
choice."
Strengthening of undergraduate
programs and coping with financial
problems will be two of the key tasks
awaiting the successor to President
Richard Lyman, according to key fa
culty members and administrators
contacted yesterday.
In general, however, an administ
ration shake-up or major changes in
the academic or fiscal policy of the
University is unlikely.
Lyman announced Saturday that
he would resign as president effec
tive this summer, to assume the post
as president of the Rockefeller
Foundation.

"An institution of Stanford's
strength and character has a tre
mendous momentum of its own,"
said Joel Smith, vice president for
development.
While a new president "will surely
try to change things as a matter of
emphasis," Smith said appointment
of a new president will not mean the
University will be an entirely diffe
rent place.
Others agreed.
"All of us in the senior administra
tion share some basic values and go
als, and we fully expect these to carry
on," said William Massy, vice presi
dent for business and finance.
He added that he considers it un
likely that a new president would ask
for the resignations of other senior
administrators in order to allow him a
free reign in appointing "his own
staff."
Inevitably, the new president will
have different priorities than Lyman
has, but any changes will have to be
made in the context of the Universi
ty's "relentlessly difficult" budget
problems, Smith said.

"There are a great many oppor
tunities for a new administration,"
Massy said. He looks for a
strengthening of the humanities
along with undergraduate programs,
but he cautioned that this needs to
be accomplished without injury to
the strong graduate programs. He
added, though, "I think it can be
done."
Not unrelated to finances and
program is the issue of faculty re
cruitment which Law School Dean
Charles Meyers sees as the key issue
the next president will face.
"The only thing that's been lacking
in the last 10 years is money, and
(Lyman) has been doing all he can to
improve that. He has been able to
preserve top quality despite the fi
nancial constraints.
"But the problem of erosion of fa
culty salaries and the extremely at
tractive options in the private sector,
especially for professional school fa
culty, are going to confront the new

president with very serious chal
lenges," Meyer said.
