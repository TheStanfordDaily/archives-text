# Lyman to resign; accepts top Rockefeller post
## Successor will face key issues 
### Mike Charlson Senior staff writer 
Strengthening of undergraduate
programs and coping with financial
problems will be two of the key tasks
awaiting the successor to President
Richard Lyman, according to key fa
culty members and administrators
contacted yesterday.
In general, however, an administ
ration shake-up or major changes in
the academic or fiscal policy of the
University is unlikely.
Lyman announced Saturday that
he would resign as president effec
tive this summer, to assume the post
as president of the Rockefeller
Foundation.

"An institution of Stanford's
strength and character has a tre
mendous momentum of its own,"
said Joel Smith, vice president for
development.
While a new president "will surely
try to change things as a matter of
emphasis," Smith said appointment
of a new president will not mean the
University will be an entirely diffe
rent place.
Others agreed.
"All of us in the senior administra
tion share some basic values and go
als, and we fully expect these to carry
on," said William Massy, vice presi
dent for business and finance.
He added that he considers it un
likely that a new president would ask
for the resignations of other senior
administrators in order to allow him a
free reign in appointing "his own
staff."
Inevitably, the new president will
have different priorities than Lyman
has, but any changes will have to be
made in the context of the Universi
ty's "relentlessly difficult" budget
problems, Smith said.
