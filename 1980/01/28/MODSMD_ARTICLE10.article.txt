# Carter's call faces Arab suspicion

The Washington Post
Beirut — President Jimmy
Carter's call for a Middle East
ern "security framework"
faces strong suspicion across
most of the Arab world, ab
sorbed by its conflict with Is
rael and reluctant to be seen
cooperating with the jewish
state's chief ally.
The massive Soviet military
intervention in Moslem Af
ghanistan has got many Arabs
looking nervously to the north
and some checking the ac
tivities of Soviet-backed fac
tions within their own coun
tries. But the idea of cooperat
ing with the United States has

been embraced only by Egypt
under President Anwar Sadat
and the tiny Persian Gulf sulta
nate of Oman.
As a result, the promise of
regional coordination with the
United States against the threat
of further Soviet moves toward
the gulf seems likely to follow
the current of Arab-U.S. rela
tions on other issues, Arab
analysts say.
Chief among them is the ef
fort to set up acceptable Pales
tinian autonomy in Gaza and
the West Bank, they add. The
way Arab leaders view U.S. pol
icy in the autonomy
negotiations will in large mea
sure determine their willing
ness to cooperate, even dis
cretely, with the United States
in regional security planning,
according to these sources.
Saudi Arabia — conser
vative, zealously Moslem
and eager to remain
Washington's friend — is
considered by observers here
as a litmus test of whether Car
ter's doctrine for the Middle
East can move from a slogan to
practical security arrange
ments.
"The Saudis have a real prob
lem," said an Arab analyst.
"They are really afraid of the
Russians and also are worried
about what is going on in their
own country. But at the same
time they can't be seen to be
cooperating with the United
States'' because of their oppos
ition to the Camp David ag

reements sponsored by
Washington for Egypt and Is
rael.
Kuwait, a Saudi neighbor,
announced Thursday its prop
osals for this weekend's Is
lamic conference in Pakistan in
what some observers here in
terpreted as a reflection of the
Saudi position. Kuwait will
urge a resolution calling on the
Soviet Union to withdraw from
Afghanistan, a spokesman
said, but also calling on Israel
to withdraw from occupied
Arab territories.
Although they made no di
rect response to Carter's ap
peal Thursday, Saudi rulers
previously have declared they
will allow no U.S. bases or
other military facilities on
Saudi soil. Some reports
suggest the Saudis also have
made clear to the Carter ad
ministration privately the link
they intend to maintain bet
ween progress in Palestinian
demands for a homeland and
U.S. aims for regional security.
The Saudi leadership is ex
pected to underline these con
cerns again in discussions next
week with Sol Linowitz, Car
ter's special Middle East
negotiator who is scheduled to
visit the kingdom after a new
round of Egyptian-Israeli au
tonomy talks in Israel.
Linowitz and Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance already have
responded indirectly to the
Saudis, telling Israel that the
best contribution it could

make now to counter the
Soviets in the Middle East
would be progress in the au
tonomy talks.
Another major gulf nation,
Iraq, previously has rejected
attempts by Oman to enlist
support tor a gulf security ag
reement taking into account
U.S. and European interests in
the vital waterway. Its response
to Carter's new appeal was ex
pected to be even more nega
tive.
Syria, however, has reacted
to the Soviet moves in Af
ghanistan with reaffirmations
of friendship for Moscow.
Similarly, the Palestine Lib
eration Organization Thursday
condemned Carter's appeal as
an attempt to extend American
"hegemony" throughout the
Middle East. A PLO spokes
man, Majed Abu Sharar,
charged the United States with
trying to use concern over the
Soviet Union to distract Arab
states from opposition to the
Camp David agreements.
A PLO official said the guer
rilla leadership feels the Carter
administration is too preoc
cupied with the crises in Iran
and Afghanistan — and too
concerned about presidential
elections — to make a major
effort now on the autonomy
talks.
"They are not in a mood to
deal with us now," he said.
"They are going to try to blud
geon the Saudis into accepting
the security idea."

intervention in Moslem Af
ghanistan has got many Arabs
looking nervously to the north
and some checking the ac
tivities of Soviet-backed fac
tions within their own coun
tries. But the idea of cooperat
ing with the United States has

been embraced only by Egypt
under President Anwar Sadat
and the tiny Persian Gulf sulta
nate of Oman.
As a result, the promise of
regional coordination with the
United States against the threat
of further Soviet moves toward
the gulf seems likely to follow
the current of Arab-U.S. rela
tions on other issues, Arab
analysts say.
Chief among them is the ef
fort to set up acceptable Pales
tinian autonomy in Gaza and
the West Bank, they add. The
way Arab leaders view U.S. pol
icy in the autonomy
negotiations will in large mea
sure determine their willing
ness to cooperate, even dis
cretely, with the United States
in regional security planning,
according to these sources.
Saudi Arabia — conser
vative, zealously Moslem
and eager to remain
Washington's friend — is
considered by observers here
as a litmus test of whether Car
ter's doctrine for the Middle
East can move from a slogan to
practical security arrange
ments.
"The Saudis have a real prob
lem," said an Arab analyst.
"They are really afraid of the
Russians and also are worried
about what is going on in their
own country. But at the same
time they can't be seen to be
cooperating with the United
States'' because of their oppos
ition to the Camp David ag

reements sponsored by
Washington for Egypt and Is
rael.
Kuwait, a Saudi neighbor,
announced Thursday its prop
osals for this weekend's Is
lamic conference in Pakistan in
what some observers here in
terpreted as a reflection of the
Saudi position. Kuwait will
urge a resolution calling on the
Soviet Union to withdraw from
Afghanistan, a spokesman
said, but also calling on Israel
to withdraw from occupied
Arab territories.
Although they made no di
rect response to Carter's ap
peal Thursday, Saudi rulers
previously have declared they
will allow no U.S. bases or
other military facilities on
Saudi soil. Some reports
suggest the Saudis also have
made clear to the Carter ad
ministration privately the link
they intend to maintain bet
ween progress in Palestinian
demands for a homeland and
U.S. aims for regional security.
The Saudi leadership is ex
pected to underline these con
cerns again in discussions next
week with Sol Linowitz, Car
ter's special Middle East
negotiator who is scheduled to
visit the kingdom after a new
round of Egyptian-Israeli au
tonomy talks in Israel.
Linowitz and Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance already have
responded indirectly to the
Saudis, telling Israel that the
best contribution it could

make now to counter the
Soviets in the Middle East
would be progress in the au
tonomy talks.
Another major gulf nation,
Iraq, previously has rejected
attempts by Oman to enlist
support tor a gulf security ag
reement taking into account
U.S. and European interests in
the vital waterway. Its response
to Carter's new appeal was ex
pected to be even more nega
tive.
Syria, however, has reacted
to the Soviet moves in Af
ghanistan with reaffirmations
of friendship for Moscow.
Similarly, the Palestine Lib
eration Organization Thursday
condemned Carter's appeal as
an attempt to extend American
"hegemony" throughout the
Middle East. A PLO spokes
man, Majed Abu Sharar,
charged the United States with
trying to use concern over the
Soviet Union to distract Arab
states from opposition to the
Camp David agreements.
A PLO official said the guer
rilla leadership feels the Carter
administration is too preoc
cupied with the crises in Iran
and Afghanistan — and too
concerned about presidential
elections — to make a major
effort now on the autonomy
talks.
"They are not in a mood to
deal with us now," he said.
"They are going to try to blud
geon the Saudis into accepting
the security idea."
The Washington Post
Beirut — President Jimmy
Carter's call for a Middle East
ern "security framework"
faces strong suspicion across
most of the Arab world, ab
sorbed by its conflict with Is
rael and reluctant to be seen
cooperating with the jewish
state's chief ally.

intervention in Moslem Af
ghanistan has got many Arabs
