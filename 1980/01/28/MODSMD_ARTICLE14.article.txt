# Cancer-fighting compound
## Researchers duplicate interferon 
### 
The Washington Post and staff writers
Swiss and Finnish genetic
engineers have learned to
make a close copy of the
human body's scarcest, most
important substances — a
natural disease-fighting,
cancer-fighting compound cal
led interferon — they said last
week
The scientists have induced
extracts of human genes to
duplicate the human interfe
ron gene in laboratory bac
teria, thus turning the bacteria
into factories to make a sub
stance very close in nature to
human interferon.
These bacterial factories, the
scientists said, should soon
begin to produce the first sub
stantial quantities of an
interferon-like substance.
And, in the words of Dr. Walter
Gilbert of Harvard University,
one of the world's leading
molecular biologists, the new
substance might "knock out"
some important virus diseases,
as well as attacking cancer.
The new work was done
partly at the Finnish Red Cross
Center in Helsinki and partly at
the University of Zurich by sci
entists working in behalf of
Biogen Sa, a small, largely
European firm in the new busi-

ness of combining DNA or
genetic material to try to make
commercial products.
The work was announced in
Boston by Dr. Charles
Weissmann of the University of
Zurich; Robert Cawthorn, the
firm's president, and Gilvers, a
Harvard biologist who heads
Biogen's scientific advisory
board.
Researchers at the Stanford
Medical Center are currently
testing interferon as a treat
ment for various diseases, ac
cording to Dr. Thomas Meri
gan, head of the division of in
fectious diseases.
In 1973, they found that in
terferon can prevent the com
mon cold. It has also been used
successfully both to reduce
tumors of the lymphatic system
and to treat chronic hepatitis B
virus infection.
Biogen is partly owned by In
ternational Nickel Co. (Inco) of
Toronto and in smaller part by
Schering-Plough, a major
American pharmaceutical firm.
A Schering-Plough official ar
ranged the Boston news con
ference.
Interferon is a compound re
leased by some of the body's
cells when they are attacked by
viruses, toxic chemicals or
other enemies, including
cancer. It is being tried with

such promising results in such
a wide variety of human virus
infections — and several kinds
of cancer — that many scien
tists believe that it may prove to
be almost a "universal drug,"
much like penicillin.
Based on optimistic though
early reports in treatment of
some kinds of cancer, the gov
ernment's National Cancer In
stitute is about to spend ar
ound $4 million to make
enough interferon — by cum
bersome present methods —
to treat 400 cancer patients.
The Biogen scientists are still
making interferon only in
speck-like quantities. But they
are confident, Weissmann
said, that they c?r, increase the
yield.
Gilbert called the work very
much like the early develop
ment of antiobiotics in its po
tential.
"It's a very important dis
covery" if it bears out its prom
ise, Dr. Frank Rauscher —
senior vice president of the
American Cancer Society and
former National Cancer Insti
tute director — said in New
York.
Still, Rauscher said, the sub
stance must be purified and
prove non-toxic, then must
prove to be as effective as
natural interferon.

Interferon has been known
to scientists for nearly 25 years.
Only recently, however, has
enough been concentrated to
try in even small groups.
Most ot the current supply is
made by the Finnish Red Cross
by isolating it from human
white blood cells.
There are two other equally
sjow manufacturing methods,
both involving collecting in
terferon from human cells
grown in laboratory cultures.
But the chemical's current
price — in the neighborhood
of $10,000 to $15,000 for
enough to treat one patient —
has made large-scale studies
almost prohibitively expen
sive.
Just the same, the drug has
been tried with promising re
sults in small numbers of pa
tients with hepatitis, genital
herpes (a common venereal
disease), chicken pox, re
spiratory infections and the
grim cytomegalovirus infec
tion of the brain.
Whether interferon will ac
tually cure cancer — or other
diseases — still must be
proved. But other scientists are
also trying to duplicate natural
interferon, and many believe
that before the 1980s are ended
science will have a new class ot
drugs.
