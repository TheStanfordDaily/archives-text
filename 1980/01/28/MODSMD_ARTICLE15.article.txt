# New warnings about DES

The Washington Post
Washington — The daughters of women who
took the drug DES during pregnancy face an
increased risk of miscarriage or premature de
livery when they themselves become pregnant.
The new finding of researchers at the Univer
sity of California at San Diego, the University of
Chicago and other medical centers is an ironic
twist in the history of DES — diethylstilbestrol, a
synthetic hormone taken during pregnancy by
as many as 1.5 million American women because
doctors mistakenly believed it prevented mis
carriage.
Dr. Larry Cousins and co-workers at UC-San
Diego studied the pregnancies of 71 women
who had been exposed to the drug because
their own mothers took it while pregnant.
Comparing these "DES daughters" to a group
of unexposed women, Cousins found that 40
percent of their babies died. The unexposed
group had no premature births or infant deaths.
Thirty-five DES-exposed women had visible ab
normalities of the vagina and cervix; among
them, the figures were even higher: 71 percent
delivered prematurely, and 43 percent of their
babies died.
While the San Diego researchers' results may
be artificially high because of the way they chose

patients — most women were reterred to the
medical school for treatment by their own doc
tors — other DES experts also are finding that
DES daughters have a higher risk of losing their
pregnancies or delivering premature babies.
Dr. Arthur Herbst, the gynecologist who dis
covered in 1971 that DES has triggered cases of a
previously rare vaginal cancer in young women
exposed to it before birth, now believes the
drug has caused an increase in premature de
liveries, pregnancy loss and possibly infertility
among other DES daughters.
In a study at the University of Chicago due to
be published next month, Herbst found that
only 47 percent of DES-exposed women deli
vered full-term, live babies, compared toBs per
cent of women not exposed to the drug.
Twenty-two percent of the DES-exposed
women delivered prematurely (compared to
seven percent of unexposed women) and 31
percent of the DES daughters miscarried during
their first pregnancy or lost their babies, com
pared with only eight percent of the unexposed
women. Herbst said the reason why DES
daughters may have problem pregnancies is urf
known, but recommended that a woman whose
mother took DES "should have increased medi
cal surveillance" during her own pregnancy.
