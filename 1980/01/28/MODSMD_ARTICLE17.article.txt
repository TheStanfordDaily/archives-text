## Sorry to see Lyman go 
### 
President Richard Lyman's announcement
that he will leave the University this summer
to head the Rockefeller Foundation was no
particular surprise. Still it was an announce
ment which was met with the almost univer
sal response, "We're sorry to see him go."
We must agree.
As journalists we preter to remember Ly
man'*. years in terms ot headlines. Tuition
saw .1 162 percent increase, students watched
as 294 of their brethren were arrested tor
sitting in at Old Union in protest ot University
investment policy, and H. Bruce Franklin was
tired. But in total, these incidents do not
begin to match the many significant, more
subtle accomplishments ot the past 9'm years.
The University is now an undisputed
member ot the select club of academically
superb institutions. Growth has been steady,
.md programs have been strengthened.
Many ot the University's programs are re
garded as among the best in the world. While
not an individual effort, certainly, this could
not have been accomplished without the
leadership of a strong president who consi
dered "academic excellence" his number
one priority.
What makes this achievement even more
significant is that Lyman cemented the Uni
versity's position as a world-class institution
during a period of unrest — both financial
and emotional. Combatting these obstacles
was not easy. Today, few would deny that
Lyman's guidance ot the University through
tough budget-cutting programs like the
Budget Adjustment Program and the Budget
Equilibrium Program, was masterful.
During those periods, literally millions ot
dollars were cut from the budget, but the
cutbacks wer-e thoughtful — in no way could
they be characterized as arbitrary or caprici
ous. And the desired result — quality educa
tion — was not sacrificed.
Lyman can also be proud of the emotional
state of the University today. Alter 9'/i years
as president and several years before that as a
harried provost, the attitude around the Uni
versity is more positive now than at perhaps
any time since lyman became an adminis
trator. The violence, tear and polarization
which characterized the early 1970s is
gone. Morale is high.
One can argue that this change has been
experienced nationwide. But the specific
change here can at least in part be attributed
to Lyman and his administration's openness
and responsiveness.
Lyman is accessible. He speaks with the
press. He is open with the faculty. He gets out

and sees the students. And though he is
criticized lor being sometimes vague or indi
rect in his responses to questions and con
cerns, he does note the concerns, and his
decisions are made with them in mind. This,
perhaps more than any of his individual ef
forts, has made him a successful president.
When he took office, he pledged to maintain
contact with "all segments of the (Universi
ty) community and many of the community
outside." He certainly has kept his promise.
In the same speech, Lyman said he could
not imagine himself staying as president
more than 10 years. He said:
"Ideally a university president should
serve long enough to accomplish some
thing, and not long enough to make people
think of his accomplishments wholly in the
past tense."
Lyman's wisdom holds, and his departure
at this time seems appropriate. With the
1980s some ol the problems of the 19705, like
tinances, remain, but new problems such as
t-hose ot curriculum development and re
sponse to government intervention in
academics arise.
The University is at a crossroads, and
though we feel Lyman could certainly deal
with these and other problems with the same
intelligence, zeal and determination of those
in the past, it is now, when these difficulties
are first revealing themselves, that any
change in leadership should occur.
Inevitably, people speculate about succes
sors, and this time Provost Donald Kennedy
is the person people are talking about.
We are certain that il Kennedy is appointed
president it will only be because the Board of
Trustees, with the support of the faculty,
statf and students, feel he is the best person
tor the job.
We teel that new blood is one thing that
keeps an institution like the University mov
ing forward. Therefore, we hope the Univer
sity will consider tilling either the vacancy in
the president's office or the possible vac
ancy in the provost's office with someone
trom outside the University.
Above all other considerations, however,
we emphasize the need for leadership which
has shown the responsiveness and commit
ment to ideals that the Lyman administration
has. Only it the high standards set and
achieved by Lyman are maintained or im
proved upon can the University expect to
keep its position in the academic world.
for having the vision to set those high goals
and the sheer ability to achieve them, Richard
Lyman deserves abundant praise.

sors, and this time Provost Donald Kennedy
is the person people are talking about.
We are certain that il Kennedy is appointed
president it will only be because the Board of
Trustees, with the support of the faculty,
statf and students, feel he is the best person
tor the job.
We teel that new blood is one thing that
keeps an institution like the University mov
ing forward. Therefore, we hope the Univer
sity will consider tilling either the vacancy in
the president's office or the possible vac
ancy in the provost's office with someone
trom outside the University.
Above all other considerations, however,
we emphasize the need for leadership which
has shown the responsiveness and commit
ment to ideals that the Lyman administration
has. Only it the high standards set and
achieved by Lyman are maintained or im
proved upon can the University expect to
keep its position in the academic world.
for having the vision to set those high goals
and the sheer ability to achieve them, Richard
Lyman deserves abundant praise.
President Richard Lyman's announcement
that he will leave the University this summer
to head the Rockefeller Foundation was no
particular surprise. Still it was an announce
ment which was met with the almost univer
sal response, "We're sorry to see him go."
We must agree.
As journalists we preter to remember Ly
man'*. years in terms ot headlines. Tuition
saw .1 162 percent increase, students watched
as 294 of their brethren were arrested tor
sitting in at Old Union in protest ot University
investment policy, and H. Bruce Franklin was
tired. But in total, these incidents do not
begin to match the many significant, more
subtle accomplishments ot the past 9'm years.
The University is now an undisputed
member ot the select club of academically
superb institutions. Growth has been steady,
.md programs have been strengthened.
Many ot the University's programs are re
garded as among the best in the world. While
not an individual effort, certainly, this could
not have been accomplished without the
leadership of a strong president who consi
dered "academic excellence" his number
one priority.
What makes this achievement even more
significant is that Lyman cemented the Uni
versity's position as a world-class institution
during a period of unrest — both financial
and emotional. Combatting these obstacles
was not easy. Today, few would deny that
Lyman's guidance ot the University through
tough budget-cutting programs like the
Budget Adjustment Program and the Budget
Equilibrium Program, was masterful.
During those periods, literally millions ot
dollars were cut from the budget, but the
cutbacks wer-e thoughtful — in no way could
they be characterized as arbitrary or caprici
ous. And the desired result — quality educa
tion — was not sacrificed.
Lyman can also be proud of the emotional
state of the University today. Alter 9'/i years
as president and several years before that as a
harried provost, the attitude around the Uni
versity is more positive now than at perhaps
any time since lyman became an adminis
trator. The violence, tear and polarization
which characterized the early 1970s is
gone. Morale is high.
One can argue that this change has been
experienced nationwide. But the specific
change here can at least in part be attributed
to Lyman and his administration's openness
and responsiveness.
Lyman is accessible. He speaks with the
press. He is open with the faculty. He gets out

and sees the students. And though he is
criticized lor being sometimes vague or indi
rect in his responses to questions and con
cerns, he does note the concerns, and his
decisions are made with them in mind. This,
perhaps more than any of his individual ef
forts, has made him a successful president.
When he took office, he pledged to maintain
contact with "all segments of the (Universi
ty) community and many of the community
outside." He certainly has kept his promise.
In the same speech, Lyman said he could
not imagine himself staying as president
more than 10 years. He said:
"Ideally a university president should
serve long enough to accomplish some
thing, and not long enough to make people
think of his accomplishments wholly in the
past tense."
Lyman's wisdom holds, and his departure
at this time seems appropriate. With the
1980s some ol the problems of the 19705, like
tinances, remain, but new problems such as
t-hose ot curriculum development and re
sponse to government intervention in
academics arise.
The University is at a crossroads, and
though we feel Lyman could certainly deal
with these and other problems with the same
intelligence, zeal and determination of those
in the past, it is now, when these difficulties
are first revealing themselves, that any
change in leadership should occur.
