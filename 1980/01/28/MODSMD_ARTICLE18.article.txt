## Sakharov needs anything but silence 
### 
On Jan. 22, 1980, the Soviet
government arrested and sent
into internal exile Dr. Andrei
Sakharov. This produced a
tlurry of planning by human
rights groups and an epidemic
of questions asking "Who is
Sakharov?" It produced a firm
resolve to not let this pass un
noticed, and nagging ques
tions of what could be done.
The first real action in the Bay
Area occurred with a demonst
ration in front of the Soviet
consulate in San Francisco.
But for many people, two
important issue, still have to be
addressed:
1) Why is the arrest of
Sakharov so important? and
2) What effect can American
citizens have?
Sakharov's arrest is so im
portant because Sakharov is so
important and because it was
thought that he was untoucha
ble by the Soviet government.
Sakharov was one of the de
velopers of the H-bomb for
Russia. For this work he re
ceived several state honors.
Later he thought about poli
tics and published an article,
outside the U.S.S.R., advocat
ing a government that was a
mixture of the U.S. and Soviet
forms. The U.S.S.R. de
nounced him for this.
Then Sakharov became
more and more critical of cen

sorship. He eventually became
the spiritual leader for all the
dissidents, including the Hel
sinki Treaty Watch Committee,
the lewish emigration move
ment and others.
He was also a valuable
source of information between
the West and the Soviet dissi
dents.
Two things make Sakharov's
arrest shocking.
First, he was considered to
be untouchable by the Soviet
government. He was interna
tionally recognized, including
having received a Nobel Peace
Prize for his human rights work
in Russia. He was reportedly
protected by Vladmir Kirillin, a
fellow scientist and a Deputy
Prime Minister in the U.S.S.R.
Second, Sakharov is the
father figure for the dissidents,
and his arrest is a major blow to
an already hard-hit human
rights movement.
Why was he arrested now?
Maybe as a vital part of the
Soviet government's
cleaning-up of Moscow for the
Olympics.
Maybe because the U.S.S.R.
no longer had anything to lose
regarding world opinion.
Maybe because of shifts of
power in the Kremlin (Kirillin
resigned). Nobody knows for
sure.
The second main issue is

whether American citizens can
have any effect.
Lately, detente has become a
memory. The U.S.S.R., once
concerned about its image ab
road, now merely blusters and
tells the world to go suck an
egg. Most of the trade and rela
tions between the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. have been severely
restricted or cut off entirely.
What can we do, short of war?
We can protest, as a start.
The governments of the U.S.
and Great Britain, Amnesty In
ternational, the Nobel Com
mittee, and others have al
ready voiced strong protests.
Such protests can ac
complish four things.
First, they can help ready us
for when the United States and
the U.S.S.R. start improving re
lations. I do not believe that
this current drought in rela
tions will continue forever.
And when relations start to im
prove, the Soviet Union may
start to see the dissidents as a
political bargaining tool.
Maybe then they will have a
real interest in upgrading the
situation of the dissidents.
However, this will be possi
ble only if the American, and
world, public let it be known to
the Soviets and to their own
governments that the plight of
the dissidents is important to
them.

Second, it can help keep
alive the issue of human rights
alive in foreign affairs, for the
United States if not the world
in general. As far as I know, the
role human rights plays in
foreign policy today, while still
small, is unparalleled in history.
Granted, statesmen are still
.learning how to deal with it,
but I think it's an important
issue to keep alive. Callous
ness towards the rights of
people by the world in general
helped to create such debacles
as Chile, Iran, and the attemp
ted genocides of the lews,
Gypsies, and the Armenians.
Finally, protesting is better
than keeping silent.
For one thing, demonstra
tions probably do some good
for the dissidents in the
U.S.S.R., even if only to help
keep up their morale.
For another, protesting will
help keep us aware of what is
really going on in Russia.
There is now a Stanford
Committee for Sakharov, and it
will be working on other action
that can be taken. Or write let
ters, telegrams to the U.S.S.R.
on your own. Or whatever.
Anything but silence.
