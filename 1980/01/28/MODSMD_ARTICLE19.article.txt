A Dead' letter
We are quite concerned
about the quality of the music
criticism in the Daily. We refer
specifically to the review by
Tom Campbell and |im Knapp.
First, what the hell does a
"Dead Head" look like? Arewe
really that "noticeable (by our)
distinctive demeanor and
garb?" Gee, we've been trying
tor years to hide it and now
these two guys have blown our
cover.
Second, with thecost of Uni
versity tuition so high, we re
ally can't afford to "follow the
band everywhere on tour"
anymore. You'll have to excuse
us; it's not that we "exude mel
low," we're just broke.
Or, maybe its just from the
"clouds of cannibis smoke"
(boy are these guys hip!) that
seem to follow us and the band
wherever we go.
We didn't notice the Dead
begin "to walk shortly before
midnight. " Does that mean
that they were going out on
strike? Maybe they were enter
taining the thought of not per
forming since they anticipated
the lame reviews to follow.
Okay. Maybe we're being

too harsh on these guys.
Perhaps they haven't been to
too many concerts and don't
have that many experiences to
compare with this one.
But at least they could give
the artists and your readers
enough respect to know what
the names of the songs are!
"Sugar Magnolia" and "Sun
shine Daydream" happen tobe
the same song, guys!
Does one have to follow the
band endlessly from town to
town to know that? Or would a
little more homework do the
trick?
We feel that there are
enough people in and around
this campus who know what
the music is, and what it's ab
out, to write a half-decent re
view. If reviewers (as in days of
old), still get to go for free, we
know of at least two who would
be happy to volunteer their
valuable research time and ta
lents to the cause.

Bush for prez
As a result of the Daily article
on the lowa caususes (Jan. 22) a
number of people seem to be
asking the question,"Who is
George Bush?" This Republi
can who made a stunning vic
tory over the "front-runner"
Reagan in lowa, has a very dis
tinguished background that
might be of interest to the Stan
ford voting public.
Most people remember
George Bush as the director of
the CIA, but he also has wide
experience in public service
and administration. This
lifelong Republican is gener
ally considered to be a moder
ate on social issues and con
servative on the fiscal situa
tion.
Bush is 55 years old, has a
wife, Barbara, and five chil
dren. He was educated in Phil
lips Academy at Andover and
then graduated Phi Beta Kappa
in economics from Yale in
1948. Bush now holds six hon
orary doctorates, is a trustee of
a number of universities and an
adjunct professor of adminis
trative sciences at Rice Univer
sity.
While in college he was the

captain of the Yale NCAA
champion baseball team and is
still active in sports. He was a
Navy pilot who received the
Distinguished Flying Cross in
World War II where he was
shot down in combat and re
scued by a submarine in enemy
territory.
After the war Bush became
involved in business, eventu
ally becoming a co-founder of
the /apata Offshore Company.
Until recently he was the
Chairman of the executive
Committee of the First Interna
tional Bank of Houston and
was a member of the board of
directors of a number of cor
porations. He resigned from
these positions in April 1979 to
run for President.
In 1966 Bush was elected to
Congress from Texas. He was
the first Republican Con
gressman ever elected from
Flouston and had the honor of
being one of the few freshman
legislators to be selected for
the vital Ways and Means
Committee. He served two dis
tinguished terms in the Con
gress until 1970. Bush then be
came the Ambassador to the
United Nations and retained

that position until 1973.
In 1973, in the wake of the
Watergate scandal, he was
asked to become chairman of
the National Republican
Committee and was given the
responsibility of trying to save
the floundering Republican
party. In 1974, Bush became
the chief of the U.S. liaison of
fice in Peking. This meant that
he was the de facto ambas
sador before formal relations
existed between the U.S. and
the People's Republic of
China. Finally, in 1976, Gerald
Ford asked Bush to become the
CIA director so that he could
"clean up" the agency after the
Watergate scandal.
More recently Bush has be
come the chairman of the pro
ject for the future conduct of
American foreign policy. He is
also the recipient of the U.S.
National Security Medal. Of
course a presidential candidate
cannot be judged by
background alone, but after
this victory in lowa, the name
"George Bush" might become
very familiar.
