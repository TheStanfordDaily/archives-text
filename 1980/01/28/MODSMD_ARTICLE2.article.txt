# Stanford's first lady looks to the future
## Jing Lyman leaves with regrets 
### Nancy Koehn 
Her children are happy about their
father's job change. She is not wor
ried about finding a place to live, and
the prospect of culture shock at mov
ing east after 21 years on the West
Coast does not frighten her. She will
stay busy in New York. Overall, Uni
versity President Richard Lyman's
decision to leave Stanford to head
the Rockefeller Foundation is "really
fantastic," according to Lyman's wife
Jing-
Lyman yesterday called her hus
band's appointment to the New
York-based philanthropic organiza

tion "a tremendous opportunity to
deal with world issues, and in this job
you are talking about world issues,
and to approach them in innovative
roles."
Currently chairwoman of Women
and Foundations-Corporate Philan
thropy, Lyman said, she believes in
the importance of philanthropic or
ganizations.
Lyman, who also serves as a lead
ing member of the Foundation
Center, the country's largest non
profit information resource on pri
vate philanthropy, also said that her
husband was quite qualified for the

new post he will assume in midsum
mer.
She noted, "I have some know
ledge of this (foundations' workings)
and he will do a great job. With his
background, he has a lot to offer the
Rockefeller Foundation."
Despite the challenge and excite
ment of her husband's new position,
iLyman expressed sincere regret at
leaving Stanford to move to New York
City.
Leaving Stanford, she said, "is like
cutting off an arm and a leg. We have
loved this institution and this com
munity for 21 years."
Lyman cited the value of living in
several different parts of the country.
Since their marriage in 1947, the Ly
rrians have lived in several Eastern
communities including Boston
where Richard Lyman taught history
at Harvard University and Swar
thmore, Pa. where he taught at Swar
thmore College. They also lived in St.
Louis prior to moving to Stanford in
1958.
"We've had experience in the
Midwest and on both coasts and I
think we have an advantage in living
in several different parts of the coun
try," said the University's first lady.
According to Lyman, "New York is
not the epicenterof the earth. I think
the foundation world needs to hear
this. I believe the breadth of our ex
posure to this country as well as our
international travels will benefit us
(in their new positions)."
"From now on we will be coming
home to either coast," she added.
Commenting on her role as the
wife of the country's fourth largest
private foundation, Lyman said,
"There isn't the kind of (social) role
for a spouse that there is in the Uni
versity presidency. Yet I have very
little concern that I will find some
thing interesting to do."

Currently active in numerous pub
lic and private organizations, Lyman
said she will continue to serve as a
member of the Foundation Center,
although she will resign her chair of
the Rosenberg Foundation, a private
San Francisco organization.
Although she had some influence
on her husband's decision to leave
Stanford, the president's wife said
she "never tells him what to do."
Lyman described her impact on
her husband's decision, saying, "We
always discuss major issues affecting
us. However we don't discuss them
in unilateral terms. He is conscious
this (decision) will have a profound
effect on me and he considered the
decision in that light."
However, she continued, "As for
the job and its specific issues he
makes up his own mind. He doesn't

make decisions in a vacuum. It is a
privilege to be married to someone
like this."
The University's first lady de
scribed the reaction of Lyman's four
children all aged 21 or older as
"enormously supportive. "They are
pleased that the two of us are so ex
cited."
Lyman said she had "absolutely no
idea" about possible successors to
her husband's position as University
president. She noted, "This is not my
territory."
She discounted the possibility of
experiencing extreme culture shock
in moving from Stanford to New
York. "We will have some adjust
ments to make, but we will keep our
home here. We own a house at Stan
ford with the idea of coming back
here for a third career."

ment of her husband's new position,
iLyman expressed sincere regret at
leaving Stanford to move to New York
City.
Leaving Stanford, she said, "is like
cutting off an arm and a leg. We have
loved this institution and this com
munity for 21 years."
Lyman cited the value of living in
several different parts of the country.
Since their marriage in 1947, the Ly
rrians have lived in several Eastern
communities including Boston
where Richard Lyman taught history
at Harvard University and Swar
thmore, Pa. where he taught at Swar
thmore College. They also lived in St.
Louis prior to moving to Stanford in
1958.
"We've had experience in the
Midwest and on both coasts and I
think we have an advantage in living
in several different parts of the coun
try," said the University's first lady.
According to Lyman, "New York is
not the epicenterof the earth. I think
the foundation world needs to hear
this. I believe the breadth of our ex
posure to this country as well as our
international travels will benefit us
(in their new positions)."
"From now on we will be coming
home to either coast," she added.
Commenting on her role as the
wife of the country's fourth largest
private foundation, Lyman said,
"There isn't the kind of (social) role
for a spouse that there is in the Uni
versity presidency. Yet I have very
little concern that I will find some
thing interesting to do."

Currently active in numerous pub
lic and private organizations, Lyman
said she will continue to serve as a
member of the Foundation Center,
although she will resign her chair of
the Rosenberg Foundation, a private
San Francisco organization.
Although she had some influence
on her husband's decision to leave
Stanford, the president's wife said
she "never tells him what to do."
Lyman described her impact on
her husband's decision, saying, "We
always discuss major issues affecting
us. However we don't discuss them
in unilateral terms. He is conscious
this (decision) will have a profound
effect on me and he considered the
decision in that light."
However, she continued, "As for
the job and its specific issues he
makes up his own mind. He doesn't

make decisions in a vacuum. It is a
privilege to be married to someone
like this."
The University's first lady de
scribed the reaction of Lyman's four
children all aged 21 or older as
"enormously supportive. "They are
pleased that the two of us are so ex
cited."
Lyman said she had "absolutely no
idea" about possible successors to
her husband's position as University
president. She noted, "This is not my
territory."
She discounted the possibility of
experiencing extreme culture shock
in moving from Stanford to New
York. "We will have some adjust
ments to make, but we will keep our
home here. We own a house at Stan
ford with the idea of coming back
here for a third career."
Her children are happy about their
father's job change. She is not wor
ried about finding a place to live, and
the prospect of culture shock at mov
ing east after 21 years on the West
Coast does not frighten her. She will
stay busy in New York. Overall, Uni
versity President Richard Lyman's
decision to leave Stanford to head
the Rockefeller Foundation is "really
fantastic," according to Lyman's wife
Jing-
Lyman yesterday called her hus
band's appointment to the New
York-based philanthropic organiza

tion "a tremendous opportunity to
deal with world issues, and in this job
you are talking about world issues,
and to approach them in innovative
roles."
Currently chairwoman of Women
and Foundations-Corporate Philan
thropy, Lyman said, she believes in
the importance of philanthropic or
ganizations.
Lyman, who also serves as a lead
ing member of the Foundation
Center, the country's largest non
profit information resource on pri
vate philanthropy, also said that her
husband was quite qualified for the

new post he will assume in midsum
mer.
She noted, "I have some know
ledge of this (foundations' workings)
and he will do a great job. With his
background, he has a lot to offer the
Rockefeller Foundation."
Despite the challenge and excite
ment of her husband's new position,
iLyman expressed sincere regret at
