## Zarrow and Miethke Foreign influence threatens academia 
### 
University campuses are be
coming the new battleground
in the campaign by foreign en
tities to influence U.S. public
policy and popular opinion.
Given the growing importance
of academia in the decision
making process, this develop
ment is not surprising.
In the short term, academics
are consulted by policymakers
for their analyses of foreign
policy alternatives.
In the longer run, univer

sities shape the opinions of
educated Americans who elect
political decision-makers and
determine how these officials
behave once they are in office.
The atmosphere of relative
seclusion from foreign influ
ence tormerly enjoyed by uni
versities has been shattered by
the financial crisis of rising
costs and diminished re
sources.
New sources of university
tunding have been explored,
and this quest has led to the
bulging bank accounts of
foreign governments.
While this has proven to be
financially profitable for some
institutions, compromises and
sacrifices have been made: a
locus for foreign fundraising is
often required, occasionally
taking the form of a regional
studies program dedicated to
the contributing country.
There is no problem inhe
rent in these programs; quite
to the contrary, foreign studies
are to be encouraged. How
ever, recognizing the poten
tial influence of such study
programs, some countries
award support on a quid pro
quo basis, expecting some
concessions in the form of con
trol over admissions or cur
ricula to be made by the uni
versity.
Compounding this problem
is the intervention of third par
ties such as trustees or
administration/faculty with in
terests in the area in question.
Realizing that university trus
tees are often involved with
corporations with substantial
foreign operations, foreign
governments have utilized
their leverage with these
trustees/businessmen to
further their goal of academic
influence.
One particular case in point
occurred at our friend to the
south, the University of South

ern California. In October of
1978, USC announced the for
mation of a Middle Eastern
Studies Center which would be
a separate financial and ad
ministrative entity from USC,
yet would carry the university
name.
The Center was to be estab
lished at the insistence of ).R.
Fluor, chairman of the board of
both the USC trustees and the
Fluor Corporation, a multina
tional construction firm with
huge financial interests in
Saudi Arabia and other Middle
Eastern countries.
Further investigation by the
Los Angeles Times revealed
that the Center would select its
own faculty and trustees and
raise its own operating funds.
Furthermore, the Times dis
covered the proposed Director
of the Center to be Williard Bel
ing, a former Arab American
Oil Company (ARAMCO) offi
cial and occupant of the
Saudi-endowed professorship
of Arabic studies at USC.
Finally, the Times investiga
tion uncovered aÂ» Saudi
sponsored conference earlier
in the year at which leading
American industrialists were
encouraged to support such
programs with specific
requests, made by Fluor.
Co-hosting the conference
was the Saudi Minister of In
dustry and Electricity and
USC's Beling.
It became clear from the
Times investigation that the
USC Center was being created
to produce propaganda, not
scholarly research, which
would carry the seemingly im
partial label of USC.
Such a Center and its ac
tivities would be out of the
control of normal university
checks and balances and
would be free to further the in
terests of foreign governments

and U.S. corporations at the
expense of academic credibil
ity and the American people as
a whole.
Nor was the situation at USC
an isolated fluke. Similar inci
dents involving foreign funds
have occurred at Georgetown,
the University of Pennsylvania,
Duke and Swarthmore. All are
moderately sized, private, pre
stigious universities which rely
heavily on outside funds for
continued operation.
The issues at stake here are
not the conflict between
foreign nations, nor even
xenophobic paranoia. Rather,
the issues are academic integ
rity and national interests.
It is not what our current
foreign policy happens to be
which is important, but rather
how that policy is formulated
which is at stake here. For that
reason, the argument made by
defenders of biased
academic programs that such
programs serve to right the im
balance of academic pursuit is
clearly unacceptable.
Academic integrity must be
maintained if foreign policy is
to be formulated in the in
terests of the American
people rather than that of
foreign governments or a
handful of multinational cor
porations.
It is clearly in the interest of
the academic community to
develop guidelines for the ac
ceptance of foreign funds.
These guidelines would insure
impartial treatment of faculty
selection, curricula and publi
cations, freeing the university
from any possible stigma or ac
cusations of bias.
But it is also clear that the
government must step in and
formulate these guidelines if
the academic community fails
to do so. The stakes are far too
great to leave current trends
unchecked.
