# Senior Class activities change through the years
## 
### Michelle Vaughen 
In the Titties the seniors
danced to the big band
sound ol Louis Armstrong,
floated on midnight cruises
in San Francisco Bay and
waltzed their way around
country c tub balls.
With the advent of the
Sixties came such senior
class activities as Jefferson
Airplane concerts and Viet
nam blood drives. The tradi
tional senior ball dwindled
in popularity and was re
plac ed one year by an even
ing ot nightclub hopping.
Then came the Seventies,
beginning with anti-war
lundraisers, strawberries
and c hampagne pic nics and
sherry hours, and ending
with a swing back to big
outdoor dances, beer busts
and the old senior ball in
new Gatsby garb.
And now with the arrival
ot the Eighties comes a fresh
set of senior class plans. Set
ting the tone for a new de
cade ot activities, the class
presidents are planning
such events as a "roller
disco/rock n roll pajama
leap year's eve party," a
casino night, a series of "off
the wall" mini-courses, a
ilea market and a freshman
dorm reunion/field day.
On a budget of $5000,
which comes from a $2 as
sessment lee per incoming
freshman, "we try to otter a
variety ot activities to reach
as many people as possi
ble,' said senior class co
president Sandra shanker.
Meeting twice a week, the
tour co-presidents "sit
around and try and think up
ideas; then we bounce
them off people we know,"
said co-president Gray
Boyce.
that was exactly the way
the roller disco/rock n roll
pajama party idea came ab
out. Still in its planning
stages, the party would

most likely be held in the
Quad with either a live
band or a disc jockey, beer
and wine and roller skates
tor rent. Co-president Alan
Alpert added that "every
body has to wear pajamas
for it to be tun."
Judging trom the last tew
years, the "most all around
popular activity," according
to Boyce, may be Senior Ca
sino Night on Feb. 1. Held at
the Menlo Circus Club in
Atherton, Casino Night will
give about 500 seniors a
chance to pit their gambling
skills against the 25 taculty
and administrators manning
the blackjack tables.
Senior brunches, another
popular class activity, are
being held every Sunday
throughout winter and
spring quarters, beginning
Feb. i. Hosted by local
alumni at their homes, the
brunches are limited to 10 to
20 students and a tew taculty
members. Although sign-up
lists have already been fil
led, the Alumni Association
is trying to increase the
brunches to two every Sun
day to provide more open
ings.
"Spectrum: A Series of
I ate Night Quit kies" will be
held Tuesday evenings be
ginning tomorrow from 10
to 11 p.m. A series of mini
courses, the program fea
tures practical classes
"geared toward people who
are leaving college and ha
ven't had much contact with
the 'real world,' " said
Shanker.
Such practical courses in
clude "What to look for in
an apartment contract" and
"How to chose the right in
surance plan."
Then on alternate weeks,
various "off the wall" fun
courses, such as massage,
backpacking tips, stargaz
ing and calligraphy will be
ottered. The classes will be

held in Tresidder room 270.
Looking ahead to spring,
the class presidents are
planninga majoreveningaf
tair, possibly a Catsby Night
at Frost Amphitheatre, Al
pert said.
A freshman reunion/field
day is also in the works,
where "seniors would get
back into their freshman
dorms and compete in
events such as volleyball,
softball and trisbee compet
itions," Alpert said.
He added that a flea mar
ket will be held toward the
end of the year to give
seniors a chance to "sell
their old stuff."
Overall, how does this
year's bill of fare of class ac
tivities compare with those
of past years?
|oe St. Geme, senior class
president in 1953 and pre
sently the chairman of the
pediatrics department at
UCLA Medical School, re
members a senior year that
was fairly "unimaginative
and rather traditional." The
major event, he recalls,
took place during the fall.

"We had a (presidential)
election during the fall of
'52, between Eisenhower
and Stevenson. One ot the
first activities ol our year
was an evening attair at the

Photos courtesy
The Stanford Quad

Chez Yvonne (a Mountain
View restaurant), following
the results of the election."
Fred Fortine, 1957 elass
president, described Ins
senior year as "pretty laid

back," highlighted by "sev
eral dances and campus
wide fund raising." In order
to raise money for class ac
tivities, Fortine remembers
planning a Richard Dyer
concert in the fall.
"Unfortunately, it was
scheduled right during a tlu
epidemic and we lost our
shirts on the whole thing,"
said Fortine, now an ad
ministrator at the University
of Washington.
The most memorable ac
tivities for the class of 1%5,
according to former presi
dent Craig Crockwell, now a
I os Angeles attorney, was a
"dinner-dance kind of thing
in San Francisco with the
Kingston Trio," as well as a
lecture series.
"I'd say (our activities)
were about three-fourths
social tunctions and one
fourth educational," he
said.
Isy 1967 the mood ot the
senior class had become in
creasingly less socially
oriented and more serious
in terms of politics and edu
cation, said class president

Jim Bmns.
According to Binns, who
held office that same year as
anti-war activist David Har
ris held the ASSU presi
dency, it was Harris who
"got a lot of us thinking
about education and what
we were doing at college
other than socializing. The
next step wasn't just Ifath
grade that we were about to
enter.
"As a result, we still had a
social program that looked
back to the traditional era at
Stanford (for example, con
certs and dances), but we
were also concentrating on
some educational ques
tions. We tried to present a
program that looked past
graduation."
Forums and a handbook
dealing with grad schools
and military options were
projects sponsored by their
class, said Binns, who is cur
rently a company president
in Phoenix, Ariz.
"A healthy dose of riot
ing" is what 1970 class pres
ident Dixon Kelley remem
bers about his senior year
activities.
"It was at the height of Ni
xon's power. The war was a
major issue and a lot of us
were tied up in the anti-war
movement," he said.
As the first class to abolish
altogether the traditional
senior prom, the class of
1 970 organized a Cap and
Gown Peace Commence
ment Fund instead. Under
the program, about half the
seniors marched without
cap and gowns and donated
the unused rental lees to
ward the fund. The $5000
raised was then distributed
to "peace candidates" in
the upcoming presidential
election, Kelley said.
"We tried to inject some
political awareness into the
office (of senior class presi
dent) and provide people

with a political outlet," said
Kelley, now a corporate at
torney in the Bay Area.
Senior class social func
tions that year were low
keyed, according to Kelley,
and consisted primarily ot
wine and cheese parties on
Friday afternoons and de
partmental "sherry sip
pings."
So went the early Seven
ties. By 1976 senior class ac
tivity programs were again
undergoing a transition.
Class president Eric
Strandberg remembers that
year as "a pivotal period."
"It was post-heavy pro
testing, but pre-'rah rah' so
cial school lite — at least as I
perceive it has become to
day," said Strandberg.
Class functions did not
include a "whole lot of con
troversial stuff — we we
ren't that political." Yet on
the other hand, "the senior
prom-type idea didn't go
over big at all either."
Happy hours at /ots and in
creased contact with the
Alumni Association set the
pace for mid-seventies class
activities, according to
Strandberg, who is now
finishing up medical school
at the University of
Washington.
The end ot the Seventies
brought back some of the
more traditional interest in
big social activities, but the
events themselves were
new and untraditional. Sold
out evenings tor the lirst
Casino and Catsby nights
were the highlights ol 197H,
according to class president
Clark Sterling. Class partici
pation was also strong at
more minor functions such
as happy hours, a senior
splash and pizza study
breaks.
The mood of the Eighties?
That's tor the Class of 2000
to look back and judge.


Booze has always been a favorite, even in 1967,


The 1950s vintage of Senior Fun was cotillions and cars,


Jeeping in the sun never loses its appeal.
