# FAA exonerates DC-10 pylon design
## 
### 
t "Ih • Washington Host
! Washington — The Federal
Aviation Administration said
laM week it has tound "no fun
damental shortcomings in the
design" of the much-maligned
[JT-10 engine support pylon
and proposed a relaxed inspec
tion schedule for the plane in
volved in the nation's worst av
i.ilion disaster.
112 The linding is one that DC-10
manufacturer McDonnell
Cbuglas has insisted was in
evitable. It adds to the growing
b[)dy of official opinion that
blames an American Airlines
maintenance procedure for a
< fcac k in a load-bearing pylon
bulkhead in the DC-10 that
crashed in Chicago May 25 and
killed 271 people.
*lf the DC-10 pylon "is not

damaged by maintenance or
other causes," the FAA report
said, the airplane should fly
sately tor about 25 years,
longer than it was designed to
last.
The FAA's finding was based
on a study performed by
McDonnell Douglas itself
under the supervision of the
FAA. The results of the study
were reviewed and concurred
in by both the Air Force and a
team ot independent experts.
McDonnell Douglas was cho
sen to do the $1.5 million study
because "they are clearly the
people who know the airplane
best," an FAA official said.
"The FAA doesn't have
enough people who could
have been devoted to this task
to get it done" in a reasonable

period of time, he said.
Also last week, McDonnell
Douglas agreed to pay a
$100,000 tine to the FAA for vio
lations of quality-control re
quirements during the man
ufacture of some DC-10 py
lons. The "quality control
problem" was found on some
DC-10 pylons inspected after
the Chicago accident. Al
though it paid the find,
McDonnell Douglas said that
the "discrepancies . . . are not
violations of" the appropriate
regulations.
McDonnell Douglas and FAA
lawyers reached the settlement
after the pylon study results
were released. Deputy FAA
Counsel Jonathon Howe said
"there is no connection" bet
ween the events.

The (?(SIO was grounded for
morejtlicjh 30 days after the
Chicago accident because of
concerns that the pylon bul
khead might be too fragile.
When it was returned to the air
last July, FAA administrator
Langhorne Bond imposed a
rigorous inspection schedule
on the airlines using the plane,
and promised a review of the
pylon leading to a possible re
quired change in design.
That schedule, which has re
quired about a once-a-week
look at the pylon and its sup
ports, can be relaxed dramati
cally because of the study's
findings, the FAA said. Under
the proposed new inspection
schedule, the pylon and the
points where it is attached to
the wings would be examined

only once a year or once every
five and one-half years, de
pending on the part and its lo
cation.
Some changes in the pylon
itself would be made if, for
some reason, the pylon had to
be removed trom the airplane.
However, an FAA official con
firmed that it is possible that
the DC-10s could fly to the end
of their natural design life
without any of the changes
ever being made because it
might never be necessary to
remove the pylon.
"It seems kind of silly," he
said, "to remove a pylon to fix
something that happens only
when you remove the pylon."
If the pylon does have to be
removed, two bolts on the aft
bulkhead flange will be re

placed with countersunk bolts
whose heads are flush with the
flange. The heads on those two
bolts are believed to have pro
vided the leverage necessary to
have caused the cracks in the
flange that led to the crash.
Furthermore, special tooling
or blocking will be required
during removal and reinstalla
tion of the pylon to prevent
that kind of cracking.
The thrust link, the center
most of the three attach points
between the pylon and the
wing, will either have to be in
spected every year, and re
placed before the airplane
reaches 48,000 flight hours,
about 13 years. Those links
have been replaced on some
planes.
The FAA's proposed rule is

open for comment for 60 days.
A final, binding rule, tailed ail
"airworthiness directive," will
follow and should be in place
by this summer, officials said.
The FAA had earlier required
that the DC-10's stall warning
systems be modified to pro
vide completely redundant
warning systems to both pilot
and copilot. A key finding in
the Chicago crash was that the
crew might have saved the
plane if their single warning
system had not been knocked
out when the pylon fell. That
modification must be made by '
August. j
The FAA also said it saw no
reason to require many other
design changes in the pylon or
in the plane's controls. ■<

blames an American Airlines
maintenance procedure for a
< fcac k in a load-bearing pylon
bulkhead in the DC-10 that
crashed in Chicago May 25 and
killed 271 people.
*lf the DC-10 pylon "is not

damaged by maintenance or
other causes," the FAA report
said, the airplane should fly
sately tor about 25 years,
longer than it was designed to
last.
The FAA's finding was based
on a study performed by
McDonnell Douglas itself
under the supervision of the
FAA. The results of the study
were reviewed and concurred
in by both the Air Force and a
team ot independent experts.
McDonnell Douglas was cho
sen to do the $1.5 million study
because "they are clearly the
people who know the airplane
best," an FAA official said.
"The FAA doesn't have
enough people who could
have been devoted to this task
to get it done" in a reasonable

period of time, he said.
Also last week, McDonnell
Douglas agreed to pay a
$100,000 tine to the FAA for vio
lations of quality-control re
quirements during the man
ufacture of some DC-10 py
lons. The "quality control
problem" was found on some
DC-10 pylons inspected after
the Chicago accident. Al
though it paid the find,
McDonnell Douglas said that
the "discrepancies . . . are not
violations of" the appropriate
regulations.
McDonnell Douglas and FAA
lawyers reached the settlement
after the pylon study results
were released. Deputy FAA
Counsel Jonathon Howe said
"there is no connection" bet
ween the events.

The (?(SIO was grounded for
morejtlicjh 30 days after the
Chicago accident because of
concerns that the pylon bul
khead might be too fragile.
When it was returned to the air
last July, FAA administrator
Langhorne Bond imposed a
rigorous inspection schedule
on the airlines using the plane,
and promised a review of the
pylon leading to a possible re
quired change in design.
That schedule, which has re
quired about a once-a-week
look at the pylon and its sup
ports, can be relaxed dramati
cally because of the study's
findings, the FAA said. Under
the proposed new inspection
schedule, the pylon and the
points where it is attached to
the wings would be examined

only once a year or once every
five and one-half years, de
pending on the part and its lo
cation.
Some changes in the pylon
itself would be made if, for
some reason, the pylon had to
be removed trom the airplane.
However, an FAA official con
firmed that it is possible that
the DC-10s could fly to the end
of their natural design life
without any of the changes
ever being made because it
might never be necessary to
remove the pylon.
"It seems kind of silly," he
said, "to remove a pylon to fix
something that happens only
when you remove the pylon."
If the pylon does have to be
removed, two bolts on the aft
bulkhead flange will be re

placed with countersunk bolts
whose heads are flush with the
flange. The heads on those two
bolts are believed to have pro
vided the leverage necessary to
have caused the cracks in the
flange that led to the crash.
Furthermore, special tooling
or blocking will be required
during removal and reinstalla
tion of the pylon to prevent
that kind of cracking.
The thrust link, the center
most of the three attach points
between the pylon and the
wing, will either have to be in
spected every year, and re
placed before the airplane
reaches 48,000 flight hours,
about 13 years. Those links
have been replaced on some
planes.
The FAA's proposed rule is

open for comment for 60 days.
A final, binding rule, tailed ail
"airworthiness directive," will
follow and should be in place
by this summer, officials said.
The FAA had earlier required
that the DC-10's stall warning
systems be modified to pro
vide completely redundant
warning systems to both pilot
and copilot. A key finding in
the Chicago crash was that the
crew might have saved the
plane if their single warning
system had not been knocked
out when the pylon fell. That
modification must be made by '
August. j
The FAA also said it saw no
reason to require many other
design changes in the pylon or
in the plane's controls. ■<
