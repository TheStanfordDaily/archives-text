# Oregon drops Stanford into Pac-10 cellar, 77-73
## Cards' play inconsistent but results the same 
### Robert Stone 
Prior to Saturday night's
match against Oregon, head
coach Dick Dißiaso said his
Cardinal basketball team
would have to play mentally
aggressive and be defensively
aware to compete with the
Duck team that shared the
Pacific-10 Conference base
ment with them.
Dißiaso's analysis of the situ
ation proved to be correct but
porous defense continued to
plague the hapless Cards in the
first half and gave Oregon the
leeway it needed to secure a
77-73 ticket out ot last place.
The victory leaves Oregon
with a 7-11 overall slate and a
2-7 mark in conference play
while Stanford drops to 3-13

and 1-7 in the Pac-10.
Stanford began the game
with a zone defense that was
scored upon 19 times out of the
25 that Oregon possessed con
trol of the ball in the first half.
Switching to man-to-man in
the second half of play the
Cards were able to outscore
their opponents 44-36, but it
was a case ot too little, too late
as the Ducks' 11-point halftime
lead afforded them with a little
ground to give up.
Explaining the change in de
fenses, a visibly upset Dißiaso
said, "We switched defenses
because we stunk and had no
defense in the first half. It'sthat
simple. The first hall we abso
lutely did not play defense."
The Ducks jumped out to a

quick three-point lead within
the first minute of play after
controlling the tip-off. Stan
ford's sophomore center Or
lando Ward made contact with
the Ducks' 7-foot center Ron
Burns as he hooked in the first
two points of the game. Burns
made the free throw and Ore
gon stayed ahead the rest of
the night.
The Cards were able to come
within two in the first four mi
nutes of the half with Ward and
forwards Kimberly Belton and
Brian Welch providing the
points from underneath.
Oregon, however, soon
blew the lead up to 10 with a
combination of long range
shots by 5-9 junior guard
Richard Wright and strong in

side play by freshman forward
Ray Whiting and junior cor
nerman Mike Clark.
Unlike their counterparts,
the Cards were unable to crack
Oregon's defense and took to
passing outside.
Most of Stanford's scoring
came from Welch who consis
tently hit from 16 feet or more.
Th? 6-7 sophomore from Idaho
led all scorers in the game with
19 points.
The second half brought a
more aggressive Stanford
squad whose man-to-man de
fense Oregon found harder to
penetrate. After a flurry of
fouls by both teams in the first
two minutes Belton and Ward
hit consecutive inside baskets
to move the Cards closer.

Welch continued to gun
from the outside until fouling
out with 7:39 left. His last foul
brought a strong reaction from
the crowd who felt that the
forward was charged into. It
also triggered a loud objection
from Dißiaso, who was warned
by the referee to calm down.
Sophomore guard Doug
Marty displayed both driving
capability and long-shot range
as he scored six points in 2Vi
minutes to help bring the
Cards within three with 3:05
remaining in the game.
Once the Ducks got control
of the ball, however, they suc
cessfully stalled the game and
drew fouls. Accurate foul
shooting enabled the Ducks to
hold off the Cards.
Oregon head coach |im
Haney responded to a ques
tion concerning Stanford's
competitiveness by saying,
"Stanford is competitive. They
showed character in the sec
ond half by not quitting. If they
had quit then I would have said
that they're not competitive."
Haney pointed out that the
man-to-man defense made a
difference in the second half.
"Playing against the man-to
man you tend not to move too
much, you don't get the
movement you need," he
explained.
Haney had praise for Clark,
who he claimed did "an excep
tional iob on Belton."

Senior guard Doug Barnes collects two of his five points on a lay-up in
Saturday night's 77-73 loss to the Oregon Ducks. Once again, the
slow-starting Cards' had the clock run out on them before they couid
catch their opponents, as a rally late in the game fell short.
When Bellon was asked il he
was satisiied with the way he
played, the All-American can
didate responded, "No, not at
all. Vou can never be satisiied
when you lose."
Bel ton played the second
halt ol the game with a but
terlly strip over his right eye
holding together a gash result
ing from an elbow lie received
in the first hall. He ended with
lb points and 10 rebounds to
move closer to the school re
cords in both those categories.

Dißiaso seemed perplexed
as to why the team is not im
proving in the problem areas
thai he has already isolated.
"We were not mentally ag
gressive before the game," he
said. "Il we were aggressive,
we should have played the first
hall like we did the scecond
hall. Vou can be aggressive
playing /one as well as man
to-man."
Tonight the team will have to
play aggressively tor both
halves il they want to prevent a
rout as ihey host No. 2-ranked
Oregon State at 8 p.m.

Haney responded to a ques

competitiveness by saying,
"Stanford is competitive. They
showed character in the sec

had quit then I would have said
that they're not competitive."
Haney pointed out that the
man-to-man defense made a
difference in the second half.
"Playing against the man-to

much, you don't get the
movement you need," he
explained.
Haney had praise for Clark,

Senior guard Doug Barnes collects two of his five points on a lay-up in
Saturday night's 77-73 loss to the Oregon Ducks. Once again, the
slow-starting Cards' had the clock run out on them before they couid
catch their opponents, as a rally late in the game fell short.
When Bellon was asked il he
was satisiied with the way he
played, the All-American can
didate responded, "No, not at
all. Vou can never be satisiied
when you lose."
Bel ton played the second
halt ol the game with a but
terlly strip over his right eye
holding together a gash result
ing from an elbow lie received
in the first hall. He ended with
lb points and 10 rebounds to
move closer to the school re
cords in both those categories.

Dißiaso seemed perplexed
as to why the team is not im
proving in the problem areas
thai he has already isolated.
"We were not mentally ag
gressive before the game," he
said. "Il we were aggressive,
we should have played the first
hall like we did the scecond
hall. Vou can be aggressive
playing /one as well as man
to-man."
Tonight the team will have to
play aggressively tor both
halves il they want to prevent a
rout as ihey host No. 2-ranked
Oregon State at 8 p.m.
Prior to Saturday night's
match against Oregon, head
coach Dick Dißiaso said his
Cardinal basketball team
would have to play mentally
aggressive and be defensively
aware to compete with the
Duck team that shared the
Pacific-10 Conference base
ment with them.
Dißiaso's analysis of the situ
ation proved to be correct but
porous defense continued to
plague the hapless Cards in the
first half and gave Oregon the
leeway it needed to secure a
77-73 ticket out ot last place.
The victory leaves Oregon
with a 7-11 overall slate and a
2-7 mark in conference play
while Stanford drops to 3-13

and 1-7 in the Pac-10.
Stanford began the game
with a zone defense that was
scored upon 19 times out of the
25 that Oregon possessed con
trol of the ball in the first half.
Switching to man-to-man in
the second half of play the
Cards were able to outscore
their opponents 44-36, but it
was a case ot too little, too late
as the Ducks' 11-point halftime
lead afforded them with a little
ground to give up.
Explaining the change in de
fenses, a visibly upset Dißiaso
said, "We switched defenses
because we stunk and had no
defense in the first half. It'sthat
simple. The first hall we abso
lutely did not play defense."
The Ducks jumped out to a

quick three-point lead within
the first minute of play after
controlling the tip-off. Stan
ford's sophomore center Or
lando Ward made contact with
the Ducks' 7-foot center Ron
Burns as he hooked in the first
two points of the game. Burns
made the free throw and Ore
gon stayed ahead the rest of
the night.
The Cards were able to come
within two in the first four mi
nutes of the half with Ward and
forwards Kimberly Belton and
Brian Welch providing the
points from underneath.
Oregon, however, soon
blew the lead up to 10 with a
combination of long range
shots by 5-9 junior guard
Richard Wright and strong in

side play by freshman forward
Ray Whiting and junior cor
nerman Mike Clark.
Unlike their counterparts,
the Cards were unable to crack
Oregon's defense and took to
passing outside.
Most of Stanford's scoring
came from Welch who consis
tently hit from 16 feet or more.
Th? 6-7 sophomore from Idaho
led all scorers in the game with
19 points.
The second half brought a
more aggressive Stanford
squad whose man-to-man de
fense Oregon found harder to
penetrate. After a flurry of
fouls by both teams in the first
two minutes Belton and Ward
hit consecutive inside baskets
to move the Cards closer.

Welch continued to gun
from the outside until fouling
out with 7:39 left. His last foul
brought a strong reaction from
the crowd who felt that the
forward was charged into. It
also triggered a loud objection
from Dißiaso, who was warned
by the referee to calm down.
Sophomore guard Doug
Marty displayed both driving
capability and long-shot range
as he scored six points in 2Vi
minutes to help bring the
Cards within three with 3:05
remaining in the game.
Once the Ducks got control
of the ball, however, they suc
cessfully stalled the game and
drew fouls. Accurate foul
shooting enabled the Ducks to
hold off the Cards.
