# FBI continues collegiate probe
## New Mexico in hot water; USC denies 
### 
San Diego (AP) â€” The TBI has
reportedly widened its gambl
ing and mail fraud probe of col
lege basketball to some teams
in the Western Athletic Con
ference and the University of
Southern California.
The San Diego Union, citing
a variety of "reliable sources,"
also said Saturday that law en
forcement officials anticipate a
perjury indictment of Univer
sity of New Mexico president
William Davis, unless Davis re
cants his testimony before a
federal grand jury.
The testimony concerned al
legations that basketball player
Larry Belin continued to prac
tice with his team after losing
his eligibility, and that Davis
was aware of what was going
on.
The paper also said Bill
Byrne, the new assistant athle
tic director at San Diego State
University, has been sub
poenaed to answer questions
regarding fraudulent athletic
credits there.
Byrne came to San Diego
after resigning as president of
the Lobo Club, UNM's booster
organization, which is being
investigated by another grand

jury for hidden funds al
legedly used to subsidize
athletes.
The complex probe began
when law enforcement agen
cies discovered a sophisticated
gambling operation in the Al
buquerque area had used a
computer at the plant of a gov
ernment defense contractor.
Authorities said a wiretap
then produced evidence that
UNM basketball coach Norm
Ellenberger and his assistant
Manny Goldstein had con
spired to pay $300 for a fraudu
lent transcript that would keep
basketball player Craig Gilbert
eligible.
Ellenberger was sub
sequently fired, Goldstein res
igned and Gilbert was declared
ineligible.
Quoting "reliable law en
forcement sources," the
Union said the probe was
broadened to include the Uni
versity of Southern California.
The paper quoted another
"reliable source in Los
Angeles," as saying "the FBI
has been on campus there (at
USC) for some time."
The FBI in Los Angeles de
clined to confirm that, the

paper said.
The faculty athletic representa
tive at the University of Southern
California issued a statement last
night denying knowledge of any
investigation by the FBI on the
USC campus.
"I personally have not been
contacted by the FBI with re
spect to the academic records
of USC's student-athletes,"
said Dr. E. John Larsen, the
USC faculty athletic represen
tative. "Nor do I know of any
on-campus investigation of
USC by the FBI.
"I assume, because of my
familiarity with the academic
records of all our men and
women athletes, I would be
the first to be informed of any
investigation involving them."
Larsen is in charge of all
transcripts for men and women
taking part in sports at South
ern Cal.
The Union said it also
learned that former San Diego
State basketball coach Tim
Vezie, had been interviewed
by the FBI. He was reportedly
asked about possible point
shaving by UNM in a game with
San Diego.

A National Collegiate Athle
tic Association spokesman said
NCAA policy forbids discus
sion of investigations in prog
ress, but that academic viola
tions take top priority.
The spokesman also said
transcript violations were the
current major activity of NCAA
investigators.
The original investigation re
vealed that seven UNM players
had received credit for an ex
tension course offered at Los
Angeles Valley College by
Ottawa (Kansas) University. Of
ficials said the athletes did not
attend the class or do any
work.
The fake course credit inves
tigation eventually led to
penalties against a number of
schools. New Mexico forfeited
all six of its football victories
last season. Oregon was forced
to forfeit its six football wins
and Utah has forfeited five
basketball wins.
The Union said the probe
has spread to Louisiana State
University and the University
of Nevada-Las Vegas.
