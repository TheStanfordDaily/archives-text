# Schultz shines in triumph
## 
### Richard Martinez 
Sophomore forward Kathy
Schultz turned in the finest
performance of her career Fri
day night as the Stanford wo
men's basketball team beat
Fresno State, 63-55.
Starting in place of the in
jured Ann Miller, Schultz pro
vided an inspired performance
in an otherwise sloppy game.
She hit on eight of 13 shots en
route to a game-high 18 points
while also collecting eight re
bounds.
The only other Cardinal to
score in double figures was
Jeanne Ruark, who added 16
points and 11 rebounds.
Reserve center Kim Kupferer
contributed 10 boards in only
18 minutes of play and point
guards Debi Gore and Denise
McGuire passed off for five as

sists apiece.
The Cards followed the same
script taken from recent
games. They seem to possess
all the necessary power to blow
their opponents right out of
the gym and yet, because of a
lack of concentration or incen
tive, they allow the game to
tighten up again.
Friday night Stanford led
comfortably by 11 points at
halftime but didn't muzzle the
Bulldogs in the second half.
Rather, a cold streak in the final
minutes and Fresno's die-hard
attitude made the contest
closer than it ever should have
been.
Stanford dominated the
boards, outrebounding Fresno
56-42. But while their rebound
ing game has reached its
zenith, the Cards shooting has

plummeted to its nadir. The
team hit on only 26 of 68 shots
for 38 percent from the floor.
Fortunately, the Bulldogs
couldn't find the range either,
making only 21 of 77 attempts
for an abysmal 27 percent.
With the victory, Stanford
moves into a tie for second
place in the Northern Califor
nia Athletic Conference with
San )ose State. The Lady Spar
tans were dealt their first con
ference loss in over two years
of play last week when the Uni
versity of San Francisco
knocked them off.
Stanford faces the unde
feated Dons Wednesday night
at USF. A win will result in a
three-way tie for the league
lead which should make for an
interesting second half of the
season.
