# Lyman: 21 years at Stanford
## 
### 
Stanford University "is not the length and shadow of
one man," President Richard Lyman said in an interview
last March. He rejected the notion that people's perfor
mance and morale would hinge on a decision of "what
Dick Lyman does when he grows up."
But Lyman, who announced his resignation Saturday
to become the head of the Rockefeller Foundation,
clearly has played the central role in the drama of the last
decade of the University.
Appointed only three weeks after the effective resig
nation of former President Kenneth Pitzer, Lyman is the
only top administrator who has stayed in the same posi
tion to witness the changes the 1970s brought.
But he was no stranger to the University before his
appointment. Indeed he has been serving here in some
capacity longer than most of today's undergraduates
have been alive.
Educated at Swarthmore and Harvard, Lyman ac
cepted a tenured appointment to the History Dept. here
in 1958 after several teaching and research positions
around the world.
As a specialist in British Labor history, he published
several books and papers and developed his profes
sional reputation with these as well as several profes
sional honors including Guggenheim and Fulbright fel
lowships and membership on the board of editors of the
Journal of Modern History.

After becoming a full professor here, Lyman began his
move into the administration in 1964 when he served as
associate dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
In 1967 he assumed the duties of vice president and
provost, the number-two position here and chief of the
academic aspects of the University.
Following the departure of I.E. Wallace Sterling as
president, Pitzer began an embattled 19 months as pres
ident in 1969 and 1970 during which Lyman was consi
dered the de facto leader of the University.
During his years as president, Lyman has been able to
de-emphasize the local puhlic relations role of the pres
ident in favor of showing the University colors around
the country.
Lyman has said he spent 40 percent of his time on local
public relations early in his administration, a figure
which is nowhere near his public relations commitment
now.
In fact, he points out that he could not spend that
much time these days because he is "a lot more involved
off campus."
Another understatement. Lyman presently holds at
least half a dozen positions on the boards of national
educational organizations or foundations, not to men
tion membership on a host of other profesional organi
zations.
