### Cathy Dickerson 
Where else could you watch
one ot last year's tirst-round
dratt picks of the major league
baseball dratt compete in one
ot the nation's toughest col
lege baseball conferences? And
where else could you watch a
quarterback demonstrate the
strength and accuracy of his
arm trom the outfield?
Nowhere else but at Sunken
Diamond as Stanford baseball
gets underway. Tomorrow at
2:30 p.m. on Sunken
Diamond, the Cardinals face
University of Pacific in the first
ot 17 ore-season games before

Pacific-10 Conference play be
gins on the last day ot Feb
ruary.
New faces
Much of this team's talent
springs from new members.
Freshman Steve Buechele,
chosen in the first round of last
year's pro baseball draft,
turned down an offer made by
the ailing Oakland A's and will
man third base for the Cardi
nals. And john Elway, last fall's
quarterback sensation, will put
his rifle arm to work in right
field this season.
Others joining the team this
year include an excellent de

fensive catcher, a freshman
tirst baseman and a couple ot
young outfielders.
Bill Warden, a junior college
transfer from Mission College
in the Los Angeles area will fill
the spot behind the plate and
"should add a lot of power to
our game — something we've
lacked the past couple of
years," says Cardinal head
coach Mark Marquess.
Freshman Eric Hardgrave, a
third-round dratt choice of the
Cleveland Indians, will share
the duties at first base with re
turnee Loring Davies. Mike Al
drete, a freshman from Mon

terey, and Mike Dotterer add
depth to the Cards' outtield.
Dotterer, the freshman
halfback who established him
self as a speedster in football,
"poses a definite base-stealing
threat," according to Mar
quess, "and may work his way
into the lineup by the time
league starts."
VVith returnees Paul /uvella,
Stanford's Most Valuable
Player and All Pac-10 second
baseman last year; shortstop
Dave Meier, who batted over
.300 last year and was named
all-league shortstop this sum
mer when he played on a
semi-pro team in Anchorage,
Alaska; sophomore outfielder
Mike Toothman and junior Phil
Wilson, who has been moved
to outfield this year, the Cards
have as strong a club defen
sively as any in the Pac-10.
The aces
Although the defense is
solid, Pac-'IO games are seldom
won on defense alone. Pitch
ing is the key in the Pac-10, and
it has been the downfall of
Stanford teams in the past.
"It's a big problem," admits
Marquess. ")ust getting pitch
ers into school (Stanford) is
hard . . . and the ones that do
get in, sign.
"But I don't want to sound
too discouraging," said Mar
quess. "The pitchers we do
have are good enough to win,
they just haven't done if yet."
Sophomore Brian Mignano
is the only pitcher on this year's
staff that recorded a win in
Pac-10 play last year. Senior
riuht-hander larrv Kuhn is the

Cards' most experienced
pitcher, and Paul Grame re
turns as a junior with two years
of varsity experience.
The fourth probable starter
tor this year is lee Cline, a
junior-college transfer from
Southern Idaho College.
Relievers include Tim Sher
rell, who played one year on
the JV team, took last year off
and now has returned to
school. Mike Sullivan, cur
rently on the injured list, Mike
/boralske and Bob Boatman
are the three other top reliev
ers.
Goinj; places?
One month of pre-season
play is all the team has to pre
pare for opponents like
Arizona, Arizona State,
California and USC. Those four
teams have most ot their pitch
ers returning this year, while
UCLA and Stanford have the
most rebuilding to do after
graduated seniors left last year.
"We're talented, but we're
awfully young," admits Mar
quess. "In the past we've got
ten off to extremely good starts
(in pre-season), but it'll be dif
ferent this year. We'll probably
make some mistakes in the be
ginning. We should get better
as we go along."
The playing field is in great
shape and has a new look to it
this season. The bank along the
third base line has
"Stanford" spelled out in
large red block letters. And
soon a new scoreboard, com
pliments of the Stanford
Diamond Club, will be instal
led.

solid, Pac-'IO games are seldom
won on defense alone. Pitch
ing is the key in the Pac-10, and
it has been the downfall of
Stanford teams in the past.
"It's a big problem," admits
Marquess. ")ust getting pitch
ers into school (Stanford) is
hard . . . and the ones that do
get in, sign.
"But I don't want to sound
too discouraging," said Mar
quess. "The pitchers we do
have are good enough to win,
they just haven't done if yet."
Sophomore Brian Mignano
is the only pitcher on this year's
staff that recorded a win in
Pac-10 play last year. Senior
riuht-hander larrv Kuhn is the

Cards' most experienced
pitcher, and Paul Grame re
turns as a junior with two years
of varsity experience.
The fourth probable starter
tor this year is lee Cline, a
junior-college transfer from
Southern Idaho College.
Relievers include Tim Sher
rell, who played one year on
the JV team, took last year off
and now has returned to
school. Mike Sullivan, cur
rently on the injured list, Mike
/boralske and Bob Boatman
are the three other top reliev
ers.
Goinj; places?
One month of pre-season
play is all the team has to pre
pare for opponents like
Arizona, Arizona State,
California and USC. Those four
teams have most ot their pitch
ers returning this year, while
UCLA and Stanford have the
most rebuilding to do after
graduated seniors left last year.
"We're talented, but we're
awfully young," admits Mar
quess. "In the past we've got
ten off to extremely good starts
(in pre-season), but it'll be dif
ferent this year. We'll probably
make some mistakes in the be
ginning. We should get better
as we go along."
The playing field is in great
shape and has a new look to it
this season. The bank along the
third base line has
"Stanford" spelled out in
large red block letters. And
soon a new scoreboard, com
pliments of the Stanford
Diamond Club, will be instal
led.

Where else could you watch
one ot last year's tirst-round
dratt picks of the major league
baseball dratt compete in one
ot the nation's toughest col
lege baseball conferences? And
where else could you watch a
quarterback demonstrate the
strength and accuracy of his
arm trom the outfield?
Nowhere else but at Sunken
Diamond as Stanford baseball
gets underway. Tomorrow at
2:30 p.m. on Sunken
Diamond, the Cardinals face
University of Pacific in the first
ot 17 ore-season games before

Pacific-10 Conference play be
gins on the last day ot Feb
ruary.
New faces
Much of this team's talent
springs from new members.
Freshman Steve Buechele,
chosen in the first round of last
year's pro baseball draft,
turned down an offer made by
the ailing Oakland A's and will
man third base for the Cardi
nals. And john Elway, last fall's
quarterback sensation, will put
his rifle arm to work in right
field this season.
Others joining the team this
year include an excellent de

fensive catcher, a freshman
tirst baseman and a couple ot
young outfielders.
Bill Warden, a junior college
transfer from Mission College
in the Los Angeles area will fill
the spot behind the plate and
"should add a lot of power to
our game — something we've
lacked the past couple of
years," says Cardinal head
coach Mark Marquess.
Freshman Eric Hardgrave, a
third-round dratt choice of the
Cleveland Indians, will share
the duties at first base with re
turnee Loring Davies. Mike Al
drete, a freshman from Mon

terey, and Mike Dotterer add
depth to the Cards' outtield.
Dotterer, the freshman
halfback who established him
self as a speedster in football,
"poses a definite base-stealing
threat," according to Mar
quess, "and may work his way
into the lineup by the time
league starts."
VVith returnees Paul /uvella,
Stanford's Most Valuable
Player and All Pac-10 second
baseman last year; shortstop
Dave Meier, who batted over
.300 last year and was named
all-league shortstop this sum
mer when he played on a
semi-pro team in Anchorage,
Alaska; sophomore outfielder
Mike Toothman and junior Phil
Wilson, who has been moved
to outfield this year, the Cards
have as strong a club defen
sively as any in the Pac-10.
