## 
### Dean Eyre 
As the saying goes, you can't do any better than your best.
Unfortunately tor Stanford's men gymnasts, their best was not
quite enough to keep pace with the red-hot squads from Arizona
State and Arizona.
Friday night, the Cardinals posted a season high of 254.10, but
the Sun Devils glowed with a 272.20 total, putting the ASU team
among the top tive in the nation, according to Stanford coach
Sadao Hamada.
Among the outstanding performances by the Cards were Tad
Bostick's 52.40 score in all-around competition, good tor third
place. He also received a 9.05 in vaulting and 8.80 on parallel bars.
Jeff Chung totaled 47.60 in all-around including a 9.15 vault
while David Hyde had 48.30 in all-around and tied for second on
high bars with teammate Brian Nelson, both with 9.20. Nelson
also earned an 8.75 on parallel bars ana scored 50.55 in all-around
with several exhibition performances.
Mike Lee put together a 49.20 all-around sum, second highest
of the night for Stanford and Bob Daniel took second in vaulting
with a 9.45 effort.
Hamada said that he was particularly pleased with the team's
vaulting, and noted that the team totals for high bar and parallel
bars were the highest to date. Even in the Cards' weakest event,
pommel horse, the team members combined for a new season
mark.
Saturday night against Arizona, the Cards surpassed their 24-
hour-old record with a 255.50 team performance. However the
Wildcats weren't pussyfooting around, and took the meet with
264.20.
Bostick paced Stanford with a career-high all-around mark of
53.30 to capture first place. He also placed second on pommel
horse with an 8.75, scored 9.10 on high bar, had one of his best
ring routines with a 8.65 judging and won on parallel bars with
8.80. His 9.20 floor exercise routine was good for second place.
Hyde logged an unofficial 49.00 in all-around since the total
included some exhibition routines. But he had thirds on parallel
bars and high bar with 8.65 and 9.20 respectively.
Lee had 50.70 in all-around, took second on parallel bars with
8.70 and scored 9.25 in vaulting. Nelson had 46.90 overall and a
9.20 vaule, 8.75 floor routine and 8.65 on high bar. Chung scored
8.85 in floor, 8.75 in rings, placed second in vaulting with 9.45 and
added up a 47.45 all-around score.
Craig Goldman earned a 9.45 for his rings performance to take
first place and Daniel displayed a 9.55 vault to capture first
place in that event.
Even since the previous night's strong perfoimances, Stanford
improved on its team tallies in parallel bars, floor exercise, rings
and vaulting, bettering the combined scores by one or two
points.
