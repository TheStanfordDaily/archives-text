# Swimmers sink shaved Santa Barbara

### Dianne Cahoon 
The men's swim team snuck
by a better-rested UC-Santa
Barbara team at deGuerre,
62-51, at the same time the
Cardinal women were wallop
mu their cross-Bay rivals at

California's Harmon Pool
Saturday afternoon.
The men's meet was closer
than was merited by talent
and ability because, as Cardi
nal coach Skip Kenney esti
mated, two-thirds of the

Gauchos had shaved their
bodies lor the competition.
Alter all, "they said this was
their goal meet," Kenney said.
The final outcome hinged on
the next-to-last event, the 200-
yard breastslroke, in which the

Cards cleanly swept the top
two official places. Freshman
|ohn Simons culminated a per
sonally demanding feat by
winning comfortably in
2:07.16. Ken Shilling pulled to
second in 2:11.68 in that race.
"(Bari) Weick and Simons
deserve a heck of a lot of credit
for doubling with no rest,"
Kenney said. "We always talk
about reaching down inside for
that extra effort. Boy, we saw
that today, especially from
those two guys."
Simons swam two all-out
races with a mere tive-minute
interlude, placing second in
the 200 freestyle in 1:42.97 and
next winning the 200 individual
medley in 1:56.24.
Weick's effort was perhaps
more astounding, as he
finished the grueling 1000 tree
in a victorious 9:26.56 to jump
right back into the next event,
the 200 tree, in which he edged
teammate Mike Anderson for
third (1:43.J4).
For the second week in a
row, diver Bryan McCleve per
formed superbly. He won both
the 1-meter and 3-meter
springboard events with 262.6
and 270.55 points respectively.
"Bryan was the best I've ever
seen him," Kenney claimed tor
the second consecutive week
as well. McCleve's precise and
poised diving just missed
NCAA qualifications.
"Both team captains really
came through," Kenney con
tinued. Tom O'Brien won his

third straight 200 butterfly in
1:52.87. Monte Brown swam an
extremely demanding triple
and garnered three second
places: 1000 free, 9:29.b5; 200
tly, 1:53.88; 500 tree, 4: tti.ss.
The men recorded no new
records. "Our goal was just to
try to win the meet," Kenney
said. "Switching the lineup
gave us no opportunity to swim
lor time. We just swam lor
place."
"It wasn't at ail close," said
coach Claudia Thomas ol her
team's 9J-48 beating of Cal and
even worse drumming ol Uni
versity ol Pacitic. "In the end, I
pulled people out ol a few
events because we were beat
ing them so badly."
Swimming oil events, the
Cards won everything except a
few Ireestyle events and
finished one-two in most
races. Freshman lanet Buchan
highlighted the meet, winning
ihe 100 and 200 backstrokes
(1:00.4 and 2:07.5) and plac
ing second in the 1000 tree
(10:01.7) to Cal's Margie
McFarland (10:01.4). Thomas
classified those two times as
delinitely among Ihe top 10 in
the nation so tar this year.
Carol Noonan won the
I-meter and 5-meter diving and
qualified for the national pre
qualitying meet in the process.

(1:00.4 and 2:07.5) and plac
ing second in the 1000 tree
(10:01.7) to Cal's Margie
McFarland (10:01.4). Thomas
classified those two times as
delinitely among Ihe top 10 in
the nation so tar this year.
Carol Noonan won the
I-meter and 5-meter diving and
qualified for the national pre
qualitying meet in the process.
The men meet Arizona Fri
day afternoon at deCuerre,
and the women will battle
Texas, one ol their rivals for na
tional honors, Saturday.
The men's swim team snuck
by a better-rested UC-Santa
Barbara team at deGuerre,
62-51, at the same time the
Cardinal women were wallop
mu their cross-Bay rivals at

California's Harmon Pool
Saturday afternoon.
The men's meet was closer
than was merited by talent
and ability because, as Cardi
nal coach Skip Kenney esti
mated, two-thirds of the

Gauchos had shaved their
bodies lor the competition.
Alter all, "they said this was
their goal meet," Kenney said.
The final outcome hinged on
the next-to-last event, the 200-
yard breastslroke, in which the

Cards cleanly swept the top
two official places. Freshman
|ohn Simons culminated a per
sonally demanding feat by
winning comfortably in
2:07.16. Ken Shilling pulled to
second in 2:11.68 in that race.
"(Bari) Weick and Simons
deserve a heck of a lot of credit
for doubling with no rest,"
Kenney said. "We always talk
about reaching down inside for
that extra effort. Boy, we saw
that today, especially from
those two guys."
Simons swam two all-out
races with a mere tive-minute
interlude, placing second in
the 200 freestyle in 1:42.97 and
next winning the 200 individual
medley in 1:56.24.
Weick's effort was perhaps
more astounding, as he
finished the grueling 1000 tree
in a victorious 9:26.56 to jump
right back into the next event,
the 200 tree, in which he edged
teammate Mike Anderson for
third (1:43.J4).
For the second week in a
row, diver Bryan McCleve per
formed superbly. He won both
the 1-meter and 3-meter
springboard events with 262.6
and 270.55 points respectively.
"Bryan was the best I've ever
seen him," Kenney claimed tor
the second consecutive week
as well. McCleve's precise and
poised diving just missed
NCAA qualifications.
"Both team captains really
came through," Kenney con
tinued. Tom O'Brien won his

third straight 200 butterfly in
1:52.87. Monte Brown swam an
extremely demanding triple
and garnered three second
places: 1000 free, 9:29.b5; 200
tly, 1:53.88; 500 tree, 4: tti.ss.
The men recorded no new
records. "Our goal was just to
try to win the meet," Kenney
said. "Switching the lineup
gave us no opportunity to swim
lor time. We just swam lor
place."
"It wasn't at ail close," said
coach Claudia Thomas ol her
team's 9J-48 beating of Cal and
even worse drumming ol Uni
versity ol Pacitic. "In the end, I
pulled people out ol a few
events because we were beat
ing them so badly."
Swimming oil events, the
Cards won everything except a
few Ireestyle events and
finished one-two in most
races. Freshman lanet Buchan
highlighted the meet, winning
ihe 100 and 200 backstrokes
(1:00.4 and 2:07.5) and plac
ing second in the 1000 tree
(10:01.7) to Cal's Margie
McFarland (10:01.4). Thomas
classified those two times as
delinitely among Ihe top 10 in
the nation so tar this year.

qualified for the national pre
qualitying meet in the process.
