# Women's water poloists survive growing pains
## 
### Allison Stone 
For those ol you who cry at
the end of fall quarter because
men's water polo is over, and
your weekends seem dull and
uneventful — you have an al
ternative. As their season ap
proaches in the spring, wo
men's water polo is just begin
ning in anticipation ol a very
successful year.
"I think this year we have a
really good team," said Carol
Turner, co-captain of the Stan
lord women's team. "Many ol
the experienced players have
graduated, but we have many
new players who really round
out the team."
Two new coaches add even
more to the team's optimistic
outlook. Art Courville, a junior
at Stantord and one-time All-
American high school polo
player, has taken over the head
coaching job Irom Brian Koux.
Mike Falco, a one-time assis
tant coach lor the women's
team at UC-Berkeley, will assist
Courville with the team.
"Brian had high expectations
lor us and we needed him to
gel us to really want to win,"
said Turner. "Art sees every
thing we do as an improve
ment. He rounds the team out
and provides an element of
consistency, as he will be able

tocoach torat least two years."
For the Stantord team, con
sistency has not always been
easy. In the winter ot 1977, a
group ot girls who had taken a
class in water polo here at Stan
lord, decided to meet infor
mally just to play the game.
"We went to two tourna
ments during that lirst year,
under the name ol the Stantord
women's water polo team, and
we were terrible!" said Laurie
Foster, a veteran player on the
team.
In 1978, the team became a
club sport and had regular
practices. "We had to pay lor
all ot our expenses for traveling
and equipment," said Foster.
"But, slowly we were becom
ing an outside threat at tour
naments, people were always
wary ot Stanford and what we
could do."
Last year, under coach Roux,
the team made it to the Nation
als in Long Beach. "We were
blown out ol the water in Long
Beach, but finally we were a
team," Foster said. "Two years
ago, we were nothing."
Now in its fourth year, the
team is ready to become one of
Stanford's stronger club
sports. With 10 to 12 returning
players and close to 15 new
players, Courville said, "I think

we can win a lot of tourna
ments and have a lot of tun in
the process." Added Foster,
"We have a lot of new players,
but most of them are good
swimmers — we have some
strong arms out there."
Currently, plans are being
made lor Stanford to host a
women's water polo invita
tional during the third
weekend ol spring quarter.
Teams such as UC-Davis,
Chico, UC-Berkeley, Santa
Barbara, San Diego, Long
Beach, USC and Hayward are
expected to provide the com
petition. "We hope to have a
meet almost every weekend
this spring," Turner said.
Coach Courville, joined by
assistant coach Falco, is run
ning workouts this quarter
Irom } to 5 p.m. on Tuesday
and Thursday evenings. "We
welcome new players with any
range ol experience to drop by
our workouts," Courville said.
"I think our team will be
good, and I think Art and Mike
are good because they're
serious about what they're
doing," Foster said. "It's hard
to imagine how far we've come
in four years, because our only
problem right now is finding a
goalie."

easy. In the winter ot 1977, a
group ot girls who had taken a
class in water polo here at Stan
lord, decided to meet infor
mally just to play the game.
"We went to two tourna
ments during that lirst year,
under the name ol the Stantord
women's water polo team, and
we were terrible!" said Laurie
Foster, a veteran player on the
team.
In 1978, the team became a
club sport and had regular
practices. "We had to pay lor
all ot our expenses for traveling
and equipment," said Foster.
"But, slowly we were becom
ing an outside threat at tour
naments, people were always
wary ot Stanford and what we
could do."
Last year, under coach Roux,
the team made it to the Nation
als in Long Beach. "We were
blown out ol the water in Long
Beach, but finally we were a
team," Foster said. "Two years
ago, we were nothing."
Now in its fourth year, the
team is ready to become one of
Stanford's stronger club
sports. With 10 to 12 returning
players and close to 15 new
players, Courville said, "I think

we can win a lot of tourna
ments and have a lot of tun in
the process." Added Foster,
"We have a lot of new players,
but most of them are good
swimmers — we have some
strong arms out there."
Currently, plans are being
made lor Stanford to host a
women's water polo invita
tional during the third
weekend ol spring quarter.
Teams such as UC-Davis,
Chico, UC-Berkeley, Santa
Barbara, San Diego, Long
Beach, USC and Hayward are
expected to provide the com
petition. "We hope to have a
meet almost every weekend
this spring," Turner said.
Coach Courville, joined by
assistant coach Falco, is run
ning workouts this quarter
Irom } to 5 p.m. on Tuesday
and Thursday evenings. "We
welcome new players with any
range ol experience to drop by
our workouts," Courville said.
"I think our team will be
good, and I think Art and Mike
are good because they're
serious about what they're
doing," Foster said. "It's hard
to imagine how far we've come
in four years, because our only
problem right now is finding a
goalie."
