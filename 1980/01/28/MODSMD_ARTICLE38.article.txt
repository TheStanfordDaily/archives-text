Two more quakes hit over weekend
San Francisco — Two sizable earthquakes rattled the
Livermore Valley of Northern California last weekend,
causing widespread minor damage but no serious in
juries, authorities said.
Scientists warned more quakes can be expected in the
area, about 30 miles east of San Francisco.
Sunday's tremor at 2:08 registered 4.0 on the Rich
ter scale, not so violent as the 5.6 quake that shook the
area at 6:33 p.m. Saturday.
Yesterday's quake was the ninth since Thursday to
register at least 4.0, including six aftershocks that occur
red between Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. In
addition, there have been about 100 minor jolts.
All of the recent quakes occurred along the Greenville
Fault zone, 30 miles southeast of Berkeley.
Mike Browne ot the state Office of Emergency Ser
vices said Saturday's damage was widespread, but
minor, and no injuries were reported.
"There was a lot of broken glass, objects knocked off
shelves, minor cracks at the Greenville Overpass on
Interstate 580, but they were not bad enough to close the
highway," Browne reported Saturday.
Damage of $1 million from Thursday's quake, which
measured 5.5 on the Richter scale, included damage to a
laser complex at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory at
Berkeley.
japan, W. Germany support USOC
Colorado Springs, Colo. — The lapanese and West Ger
man Olympic committees have informed the U.S.
Olympic Committee that they will support its stand for
moving, postponing or canceling the Moscow Olympics
this summer, it was reported yesterday.
USOC executive Director F. Don Miller told USOC
board members meeting here that a Japanese Olympic
Committee official had stated that his country would
join in seeking International Olympic Committee action
when the lOC membership meets in Lake Placid, N.Y.,
on Feb. 10.
Miller also said that Willi Daume, a West German who
is one of the most influential members of the lOC, had
given assurances of West German support for the
American position. Daume reported that the West Ger
man Olympic Committee had adopted a resolution over
the weekend similar to the one adopted Saturday by the
USOC board, calling for moving, postponing or cancel
ing the games in Moscow.
Deputy White House counsel Joseph Onek asked
USOC board members for suggestions on which of the
85 lOC members ought be susceptible to argument from
U.S. government representatives.
USOC President Robert Kane expressed renewed
hope that somehow the crisis over the Moscow Games
will work itself out and no American boycott will prove
necessary. "I'm playing for time" he said, "and I hope
we have the time, that the problem will pass and things
will turn out all right."
Committee plans separate Olympics
Colorado Springs, Colo. — The United States Olympic
Committee, after agreeing to support President Carter's
demands on the Olympics, laid the groundwork yester
day for games of its own if there is a boycott of the
Summer Games in Moscow.
The USOC Executive Board voted to continue training
an Olympic team even if a decision is later made that no
American athletes should be sent to Moscow because of
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Those athletes
could then participate in a sports festival sometime this
year.
The United States would also consider inviting
athletes from an; country that boycotted Moscow to
attend the alternative festival, a sugestion that was made
by Carter.
No site for the sports festival was named although
Colorado Springs, which was host of two previous
summer events and is the home of an Olympic training
center, was the strongest possibility. Montreal, scene of
the 1976 Olympic Games would also be considered as
well as Philadelphia.
The USOC Executive Board voted unanimously Satur
day to support Carter's request to transfer, postpone or
cancel the Moscow Games unless the Soviets withdraw

their troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 20.
If the International Olympic Committee refuses the
request, as USOC President Robert Kane considers likely,
the USOC will meet before May 24 to decide if American
athletes will enter the competition.
Moslem nations denounce Soviets
Islamabad, Pakistan —The Soviet military intervention
in Afghanistan threatens world peace and the security of
small nations everywhere, Pakistan's president warned
yesterday at the start of an emergency three-day meeting
of Islamic Foreign Ministers. Afghanistan boycotted the
session.
"We view this development with the utmost ap
prehension because unless this trend to subjugate small
countries through the use of force is arrested in time,
world peace and the independent existence of small
countries would be endangered," said Gen. Moham
med /Aa ul-Haq, the Pakistani president.
He also told the Kremlin the only way it "can effec
tively restore trust and cooperation (with) the Islamic
world" is to pull its troops from Afghanistan.
Conference sources said the options reportedly being
considered were a call for Islamic nations to break rela
tions with the Soviet Union, economic sanctions, and a
resolution to boycott the 1980 Olympic Games unless
they are moved from Moscow.
Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization, both
usually pro-Soviet, and Iran were among the 35 nations
and organizations attending the meeting of the Organi
zation of Islamic Countries. Syria was one of eight mem
bers of the Moslem group to boycott the Islamabad
meeting, and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
went to Damascus, Syria, yesterday for consultations.
Iran election signals hope for U.S.
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, whose apparent victory in
Iran's first presidential election has been taken as an
encouraging sign for the American hostages in Tehran,
said yesterday a solution to the crisis "becomes attaina
ble" if the United States does not meddle in Iranian
affairs.
At a news conlerence at his campaign headquarters,
the Iranian finance minister, a close associate of Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini, also said foreign reporters
should be allowed unrestricted access to Iran even if
false and distorted reports are sent to the rest ot the
world.
"False reports are better than no reports or reports
from a long distance," he said in an apparent reference
to the expulsion of U.S. journalists from Iran on )an. 18.
Unofficial returns reported Bani Sadr had received a
whopping 75 percent of votes cast in Iran's first presi
dential election. Official returns were expected today.
Iran has 22 million eligible voters.
Rhodesian guerilla leader returns
Salisbury, Rhodesia — Several hundred thousand sh
outing blacks welcomed guerilla leader Robert Mugabe
home trom four years of self-imposed exile yesterday in
what one jubliant supporter called "the victory party of
all time."
Mugabe's return from Mozambique had been delayed
for more than two weeks because of a dispute with the
British rulers ot this once-rebel colony.
The self-avowed Marxist wasted no time in telling
whites they would not be driven from the country it his
party wins the Feb. 27 independence elections, which
are to lead to Rhodesia's legal independence.
He also promised that his rule would bring "a totally
democratic state."
It is unknown whether the tiny but powerful white
minority, many ot whom have said they will leave the
country if Mugabe wins, would be moved by his assur
ances. His guerillas have been telling black tribesmen
for years that white farms and property would be seized
and divided upamong the black majority if he is elected.
