# 75 percent would comply if required
## Most students here oppose draft registration 
### Carl Johnston 
Although most undergraduates here oppose re
gistration of 18-year-olds for the military draft,
most students polled said they would be willing to
comply if such a registration requirement were
enacted.
In a survey of 233 undergraduates randomly
selected at nine locations across campus last
weekend, 58 percent said they do not favor regist
ration for the draft. Three-quarters said, however,
that they would register if the bill presently being
considered by President |immy Carter becomes
law.
Sixteen percent said they would not register for
the draft, and 9 percent were undecided.
About one-third (32 percent) said they favored
Carter's proposal to reinstate registration of 18-
year-olds as announced in his State of the Union
address Jan. 23. Ten percent remained undecided.
The large proportion of students who are willing
to register is disappointing to organizers of Stan
ford's anti-registration movement. But Ron Boyer
of Stanford Against Conscription and the Stanford
Peace Collective, which is staging today's noon
rally with Daniel Ellsberg, remains confident.
Commenting on the results of the poll, he said,
"That may be what people think now. But they
don't have all the information yet, either. . . .
We're going to educate them, and hopefully that

will change their minds."
Both the ASSU Senate and Stanford Against
Conscription have begun plans to increase stu
dent awareness of the issue.
A meeting of Stanford Against Conscription, a
year-old student anti-draft group, drew more than
90 people Friday night to plan future actions on
campus.
Among the actions discussed were a "teach-in"
on the draft proposals and the danger of nuclear
war with the Soviet Union; the formation of an
intercampus network of anti-conscription groups;
an outreach to the community and to high
schools; letter-writing campaigns, draft counsel
ing; and the preparation and distribution of in
formation about registration and the draft.
The group will meet again tomorrow night.
The ASSU Senate will consider a resolution op
posing registration and the draft at its Wednesday
night meeting, according to senate chair Mark
Breier.
The resolution, sponsored by Senator Jeff
Lepape, would be a message to the public of Stan
ford students' views. Therefore, Breier said, the
senate "must be comfortable summarizing stu
dent opinion" if it is to pass the motion.
He added that he doubts the resolution will get
enough support because it is still not clear how
students feel about the issue.

The senate may organize a forum on the draft
where the audience would be able to express its
views in a town-meeting style, he said. Such a
meeting, while still in the early planning stages,
would take place within the next three weeks, he
added. ♦
According to the survey, many students here do
distinguish between registering for the military
draft and being conscripted into one of the U.S.
armed forces to fight a war.
"I will register, but I will not go (to war)," said
Susie Oglesby, a sophomore in Twain House. "At
least, that's how I feel now."
"The only reason I'd register is to show the Rus
sians we mean business," said one co-terminal
communication major. "I wouldn't actually fight."
Among the features of today's noon rally on the
steps of the Old Union will be an opportunity for
students to declare publicly that they will not re
gister for the military draft.
Although registration for the draft has been a
prime subject for discussion and debate among
students here since Carter mentioned it in his ad
dress Wednesday, the idea of actually going to
fight a war seems for many to be an inconceivable
notion. «
As sophomore Victor Graham put it,"I don't
know how it would be. I am thinking 'yes' (I would
go fight). But I just can't imagine what it'd be like."

A meeting of Stanford Against Conscription, a
year-old student anti-draft group, drew more than
90 people Friday night to plan future actions on
campus.
Among the actions discussed were a "teach-in"
on the draft proposals and the danger of nuclear
war with the Soviet Union; the formation of an
intercampus network of anti-conscription groups;
an outreach to the community and to high
schools; letter-writing campaigns, draft counsel
ing; and the preparation and distribution of in
formation about registration and the draft.
The group will meet again tomorrow night.
The ASSU Senate will consider a resolution op
posing registration and the draft at its Wednesday
night meeting, according to senate chair Mark
Breier.
The resolution, sponsored by Senator Jeff
Lepape, would be a message to the public of Stan
ford students' views. Therefore, Breier said, the
senate "must be comfortable summarizing stu
dent opinion" if it is to pass the motion.
He added that he doubts the resolution will get
enough support because it is still not clear how
students feel about the issue.

The senate may organize a forum on the draft
where the audience would be able to express its
views in a town-meeting style, he said. Such a
meeting, while still in the early planning stages,
would take place within the next three weeks, he
added. ♦
According to the survey, many students here do
distinguish between registering for the military
draft and being conscripted into one of the U.S.
armed forces to fight a war.
"I will register, but I will not go (to war)," said
Susie Oglesby, a sophomore in Twain House. "At
least, that's how I feel now."
"The only reason I'd register is to show the Rus
sians we mean business," said one co-terminal
communication major. "I wouldn't actually fight."
Among the features of today's noon rally on the
steps of the Old Union will be an opportunity for
students to declare publicly that they will not re
gister for the military draft.
Although registration for the draft has been a
prime subject for discussion and debate among
students here since Carter mentioned it in his ad
dress Wednesday, the idea of actually going to
fight a war seems for many to be an inconceivable
notion. «
As sophomore Victor Graham put it,"I don't
know how it would be. I am thinking 'yes' (I would
go fight). But I just can't imagine what it'd be like."
