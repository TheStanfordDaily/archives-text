# Lyman's 'ten years' prediction realized

He said he probably wouldn't
serve as president more than 10
years.
He was right. University Pres.
Richard Lyman, elected president of
the prestigious Rockefeller Founda
tion on Saturday, will leave the Uni
versity in mid-summer — just about
10 years after he was named to the
Stanford post on Sept. 24, 1970.
Lyman, 56, was unanimously
elected the ninth president of the
Rockefeller Foundation, one of the
nation's five largest foundations, at a
special meeting of its Board of Trus
tees held in New York. He replaces
Dr. |ohn Knowles, who died last
March.
Lyman said yesterday his reasons
tor leaving the University are a "mix
ot things. Thereare plenty morechal
lenges at Stanford," he said, but "for
me and the University the change
will probably be a good thing."
"Opportunities as intriguing and
challenging as this one don't come
around very often."
Lyman, the University's seventh
president, added "This has been a
difficult decision. I'm greatly chal
lenged by the opportunity at the
Rockefeller Foundation, yet devoted
to Stanford. Jing (Lyman) and I have
been here for more than 21 years.
"They have been years of hard
work, excitement, difficulty and the
satisfaction of seeing a magnificent
institution meet its challenges and
seize its opportunities to become
even stronger."
During Lyman's presidency, the
University has increased its private
financial support at one of the high
est rates of any major private univer
sity. At the graduate level, Stanford is
ranked as one of the top three uni
versities nationwide. The profes
sional schools of business and edu
cation have consistently ranked first
in their fields, while the schools of
law, medicine and engineering are
among the top three in their areas.
Undergraduate applications to the
University reached an all-time high
of 12,000 this month and enrollment
of blacks and chicanos reached a re
cord high in this year's freshman
class. ■
In a move supported by Lyman for
many years, the Faculty Senate last
week adopted a new Western Cul
ture requirement — the most sig
nificant revision of curriculum in 10
years.

Board of Trustees President Peter
Bing said the trustees will discuss the
selection process for Lyman's suc
cessor at their next regular meeting
Feb. 11 and 12.
Lyman refused to speculate on
names of possible successors. Pro
vost Donald Kennedy, who has been
mentioned repeatedly as a candi
date, also said yesterday that he had
no comment.
"Nobody can and should deal with
hypotheticals like that," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy, who resigned his post as
commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration last April to return
here as provost, reportedly had been
considered for the presidencies of
Vale University and the University of
Chicago. Before his work in
Washington, D.C., the biology pro
fessor served as chairman of the
biology department here and as head
of the Human Biology Program he
helped create.
Lyman said the trustees will prob
ably "set up a committee or a series
of committees involving students,
taculty and friends and alumni" of
the University, toaid in the search for
his successor.
A similar procedure was followed
in 1970 before then-provost Lyman
was named University president.
More than 200 applicants were con
sidered by the trustees. Committees
composed of faculty, students and
alumni added their views during the
selection process.
Lyman, who has served as a trustee
of the Rockefeller Foundation since
1976 and is currently chairman of its
commission on the humanities, de
clined to discuss any changes in
programs or directions he hopes to
make in the foundation.
However, Lyman did say he plans
to undertake a review of the founda
tion's programs.
According to the New York Times,
some critics believe the foundation is
seeking to strike a balance between
its traditional concentrations in sci
ence, health and foreign economic
development, and its concern about
support for minority groups, wo
men's rights and environmental
causes. The foundation, with an en
dowment of some $776 million, gives
millions of dollars in grants and scho
larships each year.
"Foundations are always vulnera
ble in the modern world; that is,
