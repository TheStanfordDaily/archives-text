# Baez sings Sakharov's praises

### Brad Crystal 
Folksinger and anti-war activist
Joan Baez called Andrei Sakharov
"one of the bravest human beings
that ever lived," as more than 150
people, including eight Stanford
students, marched across the street
from the Soviet consulate in San
Francisco Friday to protest the inter
nal exile of the dissident Soviet scien
tist.
"There's no government in the
world immune to international pub

lic opinion," Baez told the crowd,
urging citizens to speak out on be
half of Sakharov and the cause of
Soviet dissidents in general.
The marchers, carrying placards
with such slogans as "Move Olym
pics from Moscow," "We support
Sakharov" and "For the sake of hu
manity support Soviet dissidents,"
joined Baez in singing spirituals of
peace and freedom.
Supplementing Baez' singing and
speeches were statements from the
Bay Area Council on Soviet |ewry de
ploring Sakharov's arrest and calling
for a boycott of the 1980 Moscow
Olympics.
"To hold the Olympic Games in
Moscow at this time is to condone
the Soviet government's human
rights violations, both at home and
abroad," the statement read.
The banished dissident leader, a
Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was ar
rested in Moscow last week, and,
along with his wife, was flown 250
miles away to the industrial city of
Corky, whch is closed to foreigners.
Sakharov has been accused by
Russian authorities of disclosing to
Western agents secrets he learned
during his years as mastermind of the
Soviet hydrogen bomb program in
the 1950s and 60s, before he took up
the cause of individual freedoms. In
recent years Sakharov has become
the best-known Soviet dissident.
According to reports from the
Washington Post, Sakharov is
shadowed 24 hours a day by three
plainclothesmen. His Corky apart
ment has no telephone, and the bat
hroom sink can't be used because it
has no drain. He must report every 10
days to the police for a review of his
conduct.
But the 58-year-old Sakharov is re
ported to be "relaxed, in good
humor and staying calm," according
to a Gorky man who visited Sakharov

and hiswifelast Wednesday, thePosf
said.
Although the exile further dam
aged East-West relations, already ag
gravated by the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan, Soviet officials have
stated Sakharov will not be prose
cuted for his alleged espionage ac
tivities.
Reaction in the scientific commun
ity to Sakharov's banishment was
swift.
A statement of protest drafted at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), signed by 230 Stan
ford and University of California
physicists, was read aloud at the Fri
day rally. The petition states:
"This incident, it allowed to stand,
will cause great damage to the coop
eration between U.S. and Soviet sci
entists, which has developed so con
structively in recent years."
Prof. Sidney Drell, Deputy Direc
tor of SLAC and one of the signers of
the petition, said he was "very dis
tressed and outraged" by the arrest
of Sakharov, and he called upon sci
entists both here and in the Soviet
Union to rally to Sakharov's support.
Drell said the moves against
Sakharov may have been spurred by
the overwhelming tide of world pub
lic opinion against the recent Russian
invasion of Afghanistan.
"The price the Soviets pay is not as
great since their image in the West is
already at a low ebb," he said.
Drell said he believes Sakharov's
arrest may hurt prospects for greater
collaboration between Soviet and
Western scientists, although he has
tened to add he opposes a complete
boycott of cooperation.
"Mutual participation in scientific
endeavors has to be examined on a
case-by-case basis," he said, "it's
very hard to make a blanket state
ment."
