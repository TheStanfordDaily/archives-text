## Airline to start direct flights Zambia forges S. African ties 
### 
The Washington Post
Lusaka, Zambia — Zambia's
national airline plans to start
direct flights later this year to
South Africa — the first time an
independent African nation
unfriendly to Pretoria will have
initiated such links with the
white-controlled government.
The move is a major out
growth of the Rhodesia peace
settlement and means that
Zambia, one of the leaders in
(he annual African eftort to im
pose United Nations economic
sanctions against South Africa,
will be expanding commerce
and possibly tourism with
black Africa's most reviled foe.
for South Africa, opening
such links would be a significant
step toward building its "con
stellation of states," an effort
to surround itself with friendly
neighbors in southern Africa
through shared economic in
terests.
The projected air link, which
is expected to begin via Salis
bury by August, is an example
ot how Rhodesia's long-hostile
neighbors are rushing to reap
the benefits ot a peaceful set
tlement.
Ironically, at the same time
they are sharply criticizing Bri
tain's temporary colonial ad
ministration in Rhodesia and
are threatening to ignore the
results of next month's
black-majority-rule elections.
Such a move could lead to a
resumption of hostilities and
the collapse ot the economic
benefits being widely hailed as
the fruit of peace in Rhodesia.
As- has often been the case
since Rhodesia's whites unilat
erally declared independence
in 1965, what the key actors do
is more significant than what
they say.
Rhodesian airspace
The Zambia Airways manag
ing director, Brig. Gen. Enos
Haimbe, disclosing plans for
the Lusaka-Johannesburg
route in an interview last week,
acknowledged that it is only
feasible to operate the flight

over Rhodesian air space, an
impossibility if the war re
sumes.
He said talks are under way
with South Africa to assure
Zambia that its black passen
gers will not suffer discrimina
tion in transit in the apartheid
nation, the only obstacle to
starting flights.
Last week, in a forerunner of
the service, a Zambia Airways
jet flew 14 surprised passen
gers trom Johannesburg to
Lusaka after flying south on a
charter. Just three months ago
President Kenneth Kaunda was
accusing 600 South African
troops of "invading" the
southwestern part ot the coun
try, the site of bases for guerril
las fighting to tree Nambia
from South African control.
Asked if the government
owned airline was putting
commercial concerns ahead of
national interests, Haimbe said
that if sanctions were ever
voted, the airline would aban
don the route. But he indicated
that he did not expect sanc
tions anytime soon, saying,
"We all know we are going to
die, but why stop eating before
you die?"
Put war behind
A senior aide to Kaunda
made it ciear that Zambia was
determined to put the war be
hind it and get on with
economic development.
"Once Rhodesia and
Namibia are free, Zambia will
no longer be a front-line coun
try. Over the last 15 years we
have sacrificed virtually
everything to gain their inde
pendence. Now, we will buy
from the south whatever we
can," he said, adding that
South Atrica was Zambia's
cheapest source of imports.
The official virtually acknow
ledged that the issue of sanc
tions against the South Afri
cans, long blocked by the*
West, was dead. He said, ton
gue in cheek, that Zambia "will
denounce them (the South Af
ricans) morally" but go ahead »

and trade and at the same time
would expect the West toapply
sanctions.
Zambia never had a ban on
trade with South Africa, the of
ticial emphasized, and pointed
out that such commerce had
steadily increased through the
early 1970'5, until the war led to
the closing of the Zambian-
Rhodesian border. Two-way
trade, mainly Zambian im
ports, averaged about $90 mill
ion annually in 1970-72 but had
dropped by about half by
1977-78.
Reciprocal rights?
So tar South Africa has not
asked for reciprocal rights, but
Haimbe expects they will even
tually be granted, a move that
could lead to the end of the
virtual ban on South African
Airways flights over black Af
rica. To fly to Europe, the air
line has to use a circuitous
route, usually refuelling at the
Atlantic islands ot Las Palmas or
llha do Sal.
The only black African coun
tries with air links to South Af
rica are Malawi, the sole Afri
can nation to recognize Pre
toria, and Mozambique, which
is heavily dependent on South
Africa economically.
Both Zambia and Mozam
bique have been quick to
reopen commercial links with
Khodesia,sending a clear mes
sage to the Patriotic Front guer
rillas they supported in the
seven-year war that the two
front-line states prefer a peace
ful settlement of the Rhodesian
issue.
Zambia Airways was the first
airline to expand service to the
new temporary British colony,
even ahead of British Airways.
Twoot the three road crossings
have already been opened,
with the third, the spectacular
Victoria Falls frontier point,
due to open Friday.
Surrounded by eight na
tions, five of which have ex
perienced wars or revolutions
in the last decade, landlocked
Zambia saw its access to the sea
cut off by the Rhodesian war.

steadily increased through the
early 1970'5, until the war led to
the closing of the Zambian-
Rhodesian border. Two-way
trade, mainly Zambian im
ports, averaged about $90 mill
ion annually in 1970-72 but had
dropped by about half by
1977-78.
Reciprocal rights?
So tar South Africa has not
asked for reciprocal rights, but
Haimbe expects they will even
tually be granted, a move that
could lead to the end of the
virtual ban on South African
Airways flights over black Af
rica. To fly to Europe, the air
line has to use a circuitous
route, usually refuelling at the
Atlantic islands ot Las Palmas or
llha do Sal.
The only black African coun
tries with air links to South Af
rica are Malawi, the sole Afri
can nation to recognize Pre
toria, and Mozambique, which
is heavily dependent on South
Africa economically.
Both Zambia and Mozam
bique have been quick to
reopen commercial links with
Khodesia,sending a clear mes
sage to the Patriotic Front guer
rillas they supported in the
seven-year war that the two
front-line states prefer a peace
ful settlement of the Rhodesian
issue.
Zambia Airways was the first
airline to expand service to the
new temporary British colony,
even ahead of British Airways.
Twoot the three road crossings
have already been opened,
with the third, the spectacular
Victoria Falls frontier point,
due to open Friday.
Surrounded by eight na
tions, five of which have ex
perienced wars or revolutions
in the last decade, landlocked
Zambia saw its access to the sea
cut off by the Rhodesian war.
The Washington Post
Lusaka, Zambia — Zambia's
national airline plans to start
direct flights later this year to
South Africa — the first time an
independent African nation
unfriendly to Pretoria will have
initiated such links with the
white-controlled government.
The move is a major out
growth of the Rhodesia peace
settlement and means that
Zambia, one of the leaders in
(he annual African eftort to im
pose United Nations economic
sanctions against South Africa,
will be expanding commerce
and possibly tourism with
black Africa's most reviled foe.
for South Africa, opening
such links would be a significant
step toward building its "con
stellation of states," an effort
to surround itself with friendly
neighbors in southern Africa
through shared economic in
terests.
The projected air link, which
is expected to begin via Salis
bury by August, is an example
ot how Rhodesia's long-hostile
neighbors are rushing to reap
the benefits ot a peaceful set
tlement.
Ironically, at the same time
they are sharply criticizing Bri
tain's temporary colonial ad
ministration in Rhodesia and
are threatening to ignore the
results of next month's
black-majority-rule elections.
Such a move could lead to a
resumption of hostilities and
the collapse ot the economic
benefits being widely hailed as
the fruit of peace in Rhodesia.
As- has often been the case
since Rhodesia's whites unilat
erally declared independence
in 1965, what the key actors do
is more significant than what
they say.
Rhodesian airspace
The Zambia Airways manag
ing director, Brig. Gen. Enos
Haimbe, disclosing plans for
the Lusaka-Johannesburg
route in an interview last week,
acknowledged that it is only
feasible to operate the flight

over Rhodesian air space, an
impossibility if the war re
sumes.
He said talks are under way
with South Africa to assure
Zambia that its black passen
gers will not suffer discrimina
tion in transit in the apartheid
nation, the only obstacle to
starting flights.
Last week, in a forerunner of
the service, a Zambia Airways
jet flew 14 surprised passen
gers trom Johannesburg to
Lusaka after flying south on a
charter. Just three months ago
President Kenneth Kaunda was
accusing 600 South African
troops of "invading" the
southwestern part ot the coun
try, the site of bases for guerril
las fighting to tree Nambia
from South African control.
Asked if the government
owned airline was putting
commercial concerns ahead of
national interests, Haimbe said
that if sanctions were ever
voted, the airline would aban
don the route. But he indicated
that he did not expect sanc
tions anytime soon, saying,
"We all know we are going to
die, but why stop eating before
you die?"
Put war behind
A senior aide to Kaunda
made it ciear that Zambia was
determined to put the war be
hind it and get on with
economic development.
"Once Rhodesia and
Namibia are free, Zambia will
no longer be a front-line coun
try. Over the last 15 years we
have sacrificed virtually
everything to gain their inde
pendence. Now, we will buy
from the south whatever we
can," he said, adding that
South Atrica was Zambia's
cheapest source of imports.
The official virtually acknow
ledged that the issue of sanc
tions against the South Afri
cans, long blocked by the*
West, was dead. He said, ton
gue in cheek, that Zambia "will
denounce them (the South Af
ricans) morally" but go ahead »
