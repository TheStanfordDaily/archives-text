The Los Angeles Times
Taipei, Taiwan â€” Toning
down its longstanding aversion
to communism, Taiwan has
begun to encourage private
trade with the Soviet Union
and other countries in the
Soviet bloc.
Taiwan's Board oi Foreign
Trade has been authorized by
the government of President
Chiang Ching-kuo, a staunch
anti-Communist, to organize
trade delegations to Eastern
Europe and help Taiwan
businessmen break into the
Soviet bloc's state-controlled
markets. Czechoslovakia and
Poland have agreed to estab
lish trade links, but there has
been no answer trom the other

countries in the Soviet orbit.
The government's move,
dubbed "the most significant
trade policy change in 30
years" by a newspaper here,
was approved before the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Despite Taiwan's traditional
deference to the United States,
which has suspended high
technology exports to the
Soviet Union, officials here are
sticking by their decision, ap
parently because they antici
pate only small-scale trading at
the outset in product lines of
no strategic importance to the
Soviets.
An American economist
here estimated this week that
two-way trade with the Soviet

bloc would total no more than
$100 million this year, about .33
percent ot Taiwan's total trade
volume.
Taiwan previously barred
any direct trade with Com
munist nations, although its
products were known to reach
Eastern Europe, the Soviet
Union and even China, its ar
chfoe, through intermediaries
in Hong Kong and Singapore,
H.K. Shao, director general of
the Board of Foreign Trade,
said in an interview this week
that the government had de
cided to adopt a policy of
"separating politics from
trade."
"Let me emphasize that this
is not a political move ana does

not mean that we're going to
approach thesecountries polit
ically or allow government-to
government contacts," Shao
said. "This is a purely
economic decision.''
Shao, Taiwan's chief trade
promoter, also denied that the
overtures to the Communists
of the Soviet bloc might por
tend the establishment of di
rect trade links with the
Chinese Communists, a move
repeatedly urged by the
Chinese government in Pek
ing.
"Trading with the mainland
is an entirely different matter
and remains prohibited," Shao
said. "The Chinese Com
munists are our enemy.
